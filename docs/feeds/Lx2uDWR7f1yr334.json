Ob es darum geht, den schnellsten Lieferweg zu finden, Benutzern den nächsten Elektroladepunkt anzuzeigen oder eine interaktive Karte für ein neues soziales Netzwerk zu erstellen – die Integration von Karten- und Navigationsfunktionalitäten ist entscheidend. Doch wie verwandelt man einen Berg von Geodaten in nützliche Features, ohne das Rad neu erfinden zu müssen? Die Antwort liegt oft in der geschickten Nutzung von Geo-APIs. In unserer täglichen Arbeit widmen wir uns der Aufbereitung und Bereitstellung solcher Daten, um Entwicklern wie Ihnen die Arbeit zu erleichtern.</p><p>Was sind Geo-APIs und warum sind sie so mächtig?</p><p>Geo-APIs (Geographical APIs) sind Schnittstellen, die Entwicklern den Zugriff auf geografische Informationen und Funktionen ermöglichen. Anstatt selbst riesige Kartendatenbanken zu hosten, Routenalgorithmen zu schreiben oder komplexe Geocoding-Dienste zu implementieren, können Sie über einfache API-Aufrufe auf diese Dienste zugreifen.</p><p>Die Vorteile liegen auf der Hand:</p><p>Zeitersparnis: Schnelle Integration fertiger Funktionen.</p><p>Kostenreduktion: Keine eigene Infrastruktur für Geodaten nötig.</p><p>Skalierbarkeit: APIs sind oft darauf ausgelegt, mit Ihrem Projekt zu wachsen.</p><p>Genauigkeit &amp; Aktualität: Anbieter pflegen und aktualisieren ihre Daten kontinuierlich.</p><p>Anwendungsfälle für Geo-APIs in Ihren Projekten:</p><p>Die Möglichkeiten sind vielfältig. Hier sind einige Beispiele, wie Sie Geo-APIs nutzen können:</p><p>Interaktive Karten für Web- und Mobilanwendungen:</p><p>Libraries: Tools wie Leaflet.js, OpenLayers oder Mapbox GL JS ermöglichen die Darstellung von Karten im Browser oder in nativen Apps. Kombiniert mit einem Karten-API können Sie eigene Marker, Polygone und Pop-ups hinzufügen, um spezifische Orte oder Regionen hervorzuheben.</p><p>Beispiel: Eine Immobilien-App, die verfügbare Objekte auf einer Karte anzeigt, inklusive Filterfunktionen für Schulen oder Einkaufsmöglichkeiten in der Nähe.</p><p>Routenplanung und Navigation:</p><p>APIs für Routenberechnung: Diese Services nehmen Start- und Zielkoordinaten entgegen und geben die optimale Route zurück, oft unter Berücksichtigung von Verkehr, Fahrzeugtyp (PKW, LKW, Fahrrad) oder bevorzugten Routenkriterien (schnellste, kürzeste, sparsamste).</p><p>Beispiel: Eine Lieferdienst-App, die dem Fahrer die effizienteste Route mit mehreren Stopps vorschlägt und Echtzeit-Verkehrsinformationen integriert.</p><p>Geocoding und Reverse Geocoding:</p><p>Geocoding: Umwandlung einer Adresse (z.B. \"Unter den Linden 6, Berlin\") in geografische Koordinaten (Breitengrad, Längengrad).</p><p>Reverse Geocoding: Umwandlung von Koordinaten in eine lesbare Adresse.</p><p>Beispiel: Ein Event-Management-System, das Benutzern erlaubt, eine Adresse einzugeben und diese automatisch auf einer Karte zu lokalisieren.</p><p>Points of Interest (POI) und Location-Based Services:</p><p>APIs können Ihnen Informationen über Geschäfte, Restaurants, Tankstellen, Sehenswürdigkeiten oder Ladestationen für E-Autos in einem bestimmten Umkreis liefern.</p><p>Beispiel: Eine Reise-App, die dem Nutzer Hotels und Restaurants in der Nähe seines aktuellen Standorts anzeigt.</p><p>Best Practices für die Integration von Geo-APIs:</p><p>API-Schlüssel sicher verwalten: Veröffentlichen Sie Ihren API-Schlüssel niemals im Frontend-Code oder in öffentlichen Repositories. Nutzen Sie Umgebungsvariablen oder serverseitige Proxies.</p><p>Fehlerbehandlung implementieren: Was passiert, wenn die API nicht antwortet oder ein ungültiges Ergebnis liefert? Ihre Anwendung sollte robust darauf reagieren.</p><p>Caching nutzen: Um API-Limits einzuhalten und die Performance zu verbessern, cachen Sie häufig abgefragte, statische Daten.</p><p>Datenschutz beachten: Insbesondere bei personenbezogenen Standortdaten sind die DSGVO und andere Datenschutzbestimmungen unbedingt einzuhalten.</p><p>Geo-APIs sind ein unverzichtbares Werkzeug im Werkzeugkasten jedes modernen Entwicklers. Sie öffnen die Tür zu einer Welt voller Möglichkeiten, um Anwendungen mit leistungsstarken geografischen Funktionen zu erweitern – von der einfachen Kartenanzeige bis hin zu komplexen Navigations- und Analyse-Tools.</p><p>Wenn Sie sich für tiefere Einblicke in die Welt präziser Geodaten und Navigation interessieren oder spezifische technische Fragen zur Integration haben, lade ich Sie ein, sich mein Profil anzusehen.

Seager said the engineering team is focused on replacing key system components with Rust-based alternatives to enhance safety and resilience, starting with Ubuntu 25.10. He stressed that resilience and memory safety, not just performance, are the principal drivers: \"It's the enhanced resilience and safety that is more easily achieved with Rust ports that are most attractive to me\". This move is echoed in Ubuntu's adoption of sudo-rs, the Rust implementation of sudo, with fallback and opt-out mechanisms for users who want to use the old-school sudo command. \n\n\nIn addition to sudo-rs, Ubuntu 26.04 will use the Rust-based uutils/coreutils for Linux's default core utilities. This setup includes ls, cp, mv, and dozens of other basic Unix command-line tools. This Rust reimplementation aims for functional parity with GNU coreutils, with improved safety and maintainability. \n\nOn the desktop front, Ubuntu 26.04 will also bring seamless TPM-backed full disk encryption. If this approach reminds you of Windows BitLocker or MacOS FileVault, it should. That's the idea. \n\nIn other news, Canonical CEO Mark Shuttleworth said \"I'm a believer in the potential of Linux to deliver a desktop that could have wider and universal appeal.\" (Although he also thinks \"the open-source community needs to understand that building desktops for people who aren't engineers is different.

Data flows in smoothly, transformations happen like clockwork, and everything seems perfect. Then you check your cloud bill at the end of the month and realize your pipeline has been running 24/7, processing mostly empty queues during off-peak hours. Sound familiar?</p><p>This is where  come in — one of  most powerful features for managing long-running and streaming pipelines.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  The Problem: Infinite Pipelines in a Finite World\n</h3><p>Traditional batch pipelines have it easy. They process all available data and exit gracefully when done. But modern data engineering often involves:</p><ul><li> that continuously listen for new events</li><li> waiting for messages that might never come</li><li> that need to respond to sporadic triggers</li><li> that should adapt to business hours</li></ul><p>These pipelines don't naturally terminate. They run forever — or until something crashes, resources run out, or someone manually kills them. That's wasteful, expensive, and frankly, inelegant.</p><p>Termination Rules in ETLFunnel provide intelligent, configurable exit conditions for your pipelines. Think of them as the \"smart shutdown\" mechanism that knows when continuing is pointless or unproductive.</p><p>Instead of letting your pipeline run indefinitely, you define clear conditions for when it should gracefully exit:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>This simple rule says: \"Stop after processing 10,000 records OR after 5 minutes of no activity — whichever comes first.\"</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  The Four Pillars of Termination\n</h3><p>ETLFunnel gives you four powerful mechanisms to control pipeline termination:</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  1. MaxRecords: The Volume Limit\n</h3><p>Perfect for: Development, testing, sampling large datasets</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>: You're testing a new transformation on production data. Instead of processing millions of records, you sample the first 1,000 to verify everything works correctly.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  2. IdleTimeout: The Silence Detector\n</h3><p>Perfect for: Event-driven pipelines, off-peak optimization</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>: Your pipeline consumes from a message queue. During nights and weekends, new messages are rare. Why keep the pipeline running? If nothing arrives for 10 minutes, shut it down gracefully.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  3. MaxPipelineTime: The Duration Guard\n</h3><p>Perfect for: Cost control, scheduled batch windows</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>: You have a 2-hour processing window during off-peak hours. Regardless of how much data is available, the pipeline must complete within this window to avoid impacting other systems.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  4. UserDefinedCheckFunc: The Custom Logic\n</h3><p>Perfect for: Complex business rules, adaptive behavior</p><p>This is where termination rules become truly powerful. You can implement any custom logic based on pipeline state:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><h3>\n  \n  \n  Scenario 1: The Smart Streaming Consumer\n</h3><p>: You're consuming from Kafka topics that have variable message rates. During business hours, thousands of messages per second. At night, maybe one every few minutes.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>: Pipeline runs as long as data flows. If messages stop for 15 minutes, it shuts down gracefully. You can restart it with a scheduled trigger or when new data arrives. No more 24/7 execution for sporadic workloads.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Scenario 2: The Cost-Conscious Development Pipeline\n</h3><p>: Developers are testing pipeline changes against production-like data. Full dataset has 50 million records, but you only need to verify logic.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>: Each test run processes at most 5,000 records or runs for 10 minutes. Fast feedback, minimal compute costs.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Scenario 3: The Adaptive Business-Hours Pipeline\n</h3><p>: You process user activity events, but your users are primarily in US timezones. Running full capacity globally is wasteful.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>: During business hours, pipeline tolerates longer idle periods. Outside business hours, it shuts down quickly if activity drops.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Best Practices: Getting Termination Right\n</h3><h3>\n  \n  \n  1. Choose the Right CheckInterval\n</h3><p>The  determines how frequently your termination conditions are evaluated. It's a balance:</p><ul><li> (&lt; 5 seconds): Unnecessary overhead checking conditions constantly</li><li> (&gt; 1 minute): Slow to respond, pipeline may run longer than needed</li><li>: 10–30 seconds for most use cases\n</li></ul><div><pre><code>// For responsive termination\nCheckInterval: 10 * time.Second\n</code></pre></div><div><pre><code>// For lower overhead on stable pipelines\nCheckInterval: 30 * time.Second\n</code></pre></div><h3>\n  \n  \n  2. Always Log Termination Events\n</h3><p>Future you will thank present you for clear termination logging:</p><div><pre><code>checkProps.Logger.Info(\"Pipeline terminating\",\n    zap.String(\"reason\", \"idle timeout exceeded\"),\n    zap.Duration(\"idle_duration\", idleDuration),\n    zap.Uint64(\"total_processed\", checkProps.TotalMessages),\n    zap.Duration(\"total_runtime\", time.Since(checkProps.StartTime)),\n)\n</code></pre></div><h3>\n  \n  \n  3. Combine Multiple Conditions\n</h3><p>Don't rely on a single termination condition. Defense in depth:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><h3>\n  \n  \n  4. Test in Development First\n</h3><p>Termination logic can be tricky. Test with different scenarios:</p><ul><li>What happens if no data arrives?</li><li>What if data arrives continuously?</li><li>What if there are brief idle periods?</li></ul><p>Use aggressive limits in development:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><h3>\n  \n  \n  5. Monitor Termination Patterns\n</h3><p>Track why your pipelines terminate. If they're always hitting , maybe your processing is too slow. If they're always hitting , maybe your upstream data source has issues.</p><p>Termination Rules are your pipeline's exit strategy. They transform potentially runaway processes into well-behaved, cost-effective, and maintainable systems.</p><p>In a world where data never stops flowing, knowing when to stop processing is just as important as knowing how to process it. ETLFunnel's Termination Rules give you that control — simply, powerfully, and elegantly.</p><p>Your cloud bill will thank you. Your operations team will thank you.

We’ll also walk through a sample Grafana dashboard for metrics visualization and spin up a second service to demonstrate end-to-end distributed tracing in action.</p><ul><li>Observability (Metrics, Tracing)</li></ul><p>Caching is an important part of scaling any service. It reduces database load and speeds up response times by storing frequently accessed data in a fast in-memory store. We’ll use Redis, the most popular in-memory key–value store, for this purpose.</p><p>Redis supports far more than simple caching — features like Pub/Sub messaging, geospatial queries, and time series are built in — but for this boilerplate, we’ll keep things focused on basic caching functions that can easily be extended later.</p><p>We start by updating our  with a new  struct:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Then we load it inside :</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Next, we’ll create  where our Redis implementation will live:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Here, we’ve followed the same modular pattern used across other components. We define a  interface that can be easily mocked in unit tests, and a concrete  struct implementing basic caching functions along with  for health checks and  for graceful shutdown. Finally, we provide a  constructor to instantiate the cache service cleanly.</p><p>Now we initialize our cache service in :</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>This setup ensures that Redis starts alongside our other dependencies and closes gracefully when the service shuts down.</p><p>To integrate caching into our application logic, we’ll update the  method. It will now first look for the user data in Redis before querying the database. If the record isn’t found in cache, it’s fetched from the database and then written back to Redis for subsequent requests.</p><p>Since we’ve added another dependency, we’ll extend the  constructor to accept the cache service:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Next, we update our gRPC server to pass the cache instance from :</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Finally, here’s how caching looks inside :</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Now, when you call the  RPC, the user data will come from Redis on the second request (after being cached during the first). The cache expires after one minute, after which a new request will repopulate it. You can also log cache hits/misses to observe behavior.</p><p>Since we added caching to , we’ll update our integration tests accordingly. To ensure realistic conditions, we’ll spin up a real Redis instance using Testcontainers. Let’s start by creating a helper function  in :</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>And then update the  test to include Redis:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>For this test, we only need to confirm that  behaves correctly — whether the data came from the database or cache isn’t important here. The goal is to ensure the service works seamlessly with both persistence and caching layers under test conditions.</p><p>Service monitoring is critical in production environments. Although gRPC includes a built-in health check protocol, it only exposes a single RPC endpoint. This makes it less flexible if you want to differentiate between basic service liveness and full readiness to serve traffic.</p><p>In this boilerplate, we’ll implement two simple REST endpoints —  and  — for clarity and flexibility.</p><p>We’ll start by defining a  in <code>internal/service/health.go</code>. This service will be used by our  endpoint to verify that all dependencies (like the database and cache) are healthy before declaring the service ready.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>The  method inside  validates the health of connected dependencies and returns their status, which we can later expose through our API.</p><p>Next, we’ll implement the REST handlers for  and  inside <code>internal/transports/http/server/handler/health.go</code>:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>The  handler simply returns  with an HTTP 200 — it’s only responsible for confirming that the service process is running.</p><p>The  handler, on the other hand, uses the  to confirm that all required dependencies (like the database and Redis) are operational.</p><p>Now, let’s wire up our HTTP server in <code>internal/transports/http/server/server.go</code>:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>This follows the same structure as our . We define both  (for custom listeners) and  (for normal TCP-based startup from configuration).</p><p>Next, update your configuration to fetch the HTTP server’s host and port from environment variables:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Finally, let’s initialize and start the HTTP server in :</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Once everything is wired up, we can test the endpoints locally with :</p><div><pre><code>curl localhost:4000/livez\n</code></pre></div><div><pre><code>curl localhost:4000/readyz\n</code></pre></div><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>With these two endpoints, you now have both basic and dependency-aware healthchecks that can be used by Kubernetes probes, load balancers, or monitoring tools.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Observability (Metrics + Tracing)\n</h2><p>In Part 1, we added structured logging to capture what’s happening inside our services. Logs are great for understanding what happened in a specific instance — but in a distributed system, we also need to understand how things behave and how requests flow across multiple services.</p><p>That’s where metrics and tracing come in.</p><ul><li> capture quantitative data about our services — like request counts, error rates, and latency. They’re lightweight, easy to visualize, and ideal for alerting and performance dashboards.</li><li> gives us a request-level view of our system — showing how a request moves between microservices and how much time is spent in each hop.</li></ul><p>Together, logging, metrics, and tracing give us full observability into our system’s behavior. In this part, we’ll implement metrics and tracing, then spin up Prometheus, Grafana, and Jaeger to see them in action.</p><p><a href=\"https://prometheus.io/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Prometheus</a> is a popular open-source monitoring system that scrapes metrics from your services, stores them as time-series data, and makes them queryable through PromQL. We'll use the official <a href=\"https://github.com/prometheus/client_golang\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">prometheus/client_golang</a> library to instrument our services and exposes metrics for scraping.</p><p>We’ll begin by creating a  inside <code>internal/observability/metrics/metrics.go</code>. This service will handle Prometheus setup, expose default metrics, and provide a simple way to register custom collectors.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>To keep metrics modular, we define a small  interface. Each component — like gRPC, HTTP, or Redis — can implement this interface to expose its own metrics while keeping code organized.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Next, we add gRPC-specific metrics inside a new  file. This includes counters and histograms for request counts, and latency — useful for tracking performance trends across gRPC calls.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>We then create a gRPC interceptor that automatically records these metrics for every incoming request. This way, we don’t need to manually instrument every handler — metrics are collected transparently as part of the request lifecycle.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>We then attach the interceptor to gRPC server via <code>grpc.ChainUnaryInterceptor</code>:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Once metrics are collected, we need a way for Prometheus to access them. We expose a  endpoint in our HTTP server, which Prometheus will scrape periodically.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Now Let's register metrics to HTTPServer in :</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Finally, we update our configuration to include a <code>METRICS_ENABLE_DEFAULT_METRICS</code> option. This flag lets us control whether we also expose Go’s built-in runtime metrics like garbage collection and goroutine counts — useful in production for monitoring resource usage.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>With this in place, our services now export rich, structured metrics that can be scraped by Prometheus and visualized in Grafana. These metrics will serve as the backbone for our dashboards and alerts once we deploy to production.</p><p>Tracing is the third pillar of observability, alongside metrics and logs. While metrics tell you how your system behaves overall, and logs describe what happened at a specific moment, tracing shows you how a request flows across services. It’s especially valuable in microservice architectures where a single client request might touch multiple services, databases, or queues before completing.</p><p>We’ll be using OpenTelemetry — a popular open-source standard for collecting distributed traces — and connect it with Jaeger for visualization. You can also integrate it later with other backends like Zipkin, Tempo, or AWS X-Ray if needed.</p><p>Let’s start by defining our  in <code>internal/observability/tracing/tracing.go</code>:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Next, we’ll update our configuration to include tracing settings such as service name and exporter in :</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Now that the config is ready, we can initialize the tracer in  so that every part of our application has access to it:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>To propagate trace context across service boundaries, we add a gRPC . This ensures that when a request comes into our service, it either starts a new trace or continues an existing one passed from another service:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>From now on, every gRPC call will automatically create a trace that’s sent to Jaeger.</p><p>Each trace is composed of multiple  — where a trace represents the entire journey of a request (for example, a user calling your API), and spans represent individual operations within that request (like “fetch user from DB” or “send email”).</p><p>To demonstrate this, let’s add spans to our  handler and the . Each span will capture the work done by that specific function, and together they’ll form a full picture of a single request’s flow through the system.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>When you look at the trace in Jaeger, you’ll see a clear chain of execution — the main request trace leading into the  span, which then calls into the  span.</p><p>The  method lets you attach useful context (like user IDs, order IDs, or error states) that can make debugging much easier when viewing a trace.</p><p>Context propagation here is critical — notice that we always pass  forward. This context carries the  created by our gRPC , ensuring that every downstream function and service is linked to the same request chain.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  End to End Observability in Action\n</h3><p>The boilerplate comes with a ready-to-use observability setup using Docker Compose, available in the <a href=\"https://github.com/SagarMaheshwary/go-microservice-boilerplate/tree/examples\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">examples</a> branch. If you want to follow along, clone the repo and switch to that branch.</p><p>We’ll first bring up our core application stack — which includes the service itself, PostgreSQL, and Redis:</p><p>Once the application is running, we can start the observability stack. This will spin up Grafana, Prometheus, and Jaeger — all preconfigured to work with our service.</p><div><pre><code>docker compose  docker-compose.observability.yml up\n</code></pre></div><p>Jaeger runs via the  image using its default in-memory storage to keep things lightweight and simple. Prometheus uses a basic scrape configuration that pulls metrics from our service’s  endpoint every eight seconds:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Grafana comes with a sample dashboard already wired up to Prometheus, showcasing the gRPC metrics we defined earlier. Open a browser and navigate to <a href=\"http://localhost:3000\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">http://localhost:3000</a> (default credentials are  / ).</p><p>The dashboard has four panels visualizing data from the  and <code>grpc_request_duration_seconds</code> metrics:</p><ul><li>Average gRPC Request Duration — time series</li><li>gRPC Request Latency (95th Percentile) — time series</li><li>gRPC Requests per Method — time series</li><li>Total gRPC Requests — counter/gauge</li></ul><p>This sample dashboard offers a quick glimpse into request throughput and latency trends — perfect for demonstration and local testing. In a real production environment, you’d typically design a more comprehensive dashboard tailored to your service’s specific KPIs, error rates, and resource utilization patterns.</p><p>Now that we’ve seen metrics in action, let’s turn to tracing. We already explored what a trace looks like for a single service, but the real power of tracing emerges when requests flow through multiple microservices. Distributed traces help you visualize the entire request path, pinpoint slow hops, and quickly identify where failures occur.</p><p>To demonstrate distributed tracing, let’s spin up a second instance of our service that will act as another microservice in the request chain. Clone the same repository inside your project directory, switch to the examples branch, and create an environment file:</p><div><pre><code>git clone https://github.com/SagarMaheshwary/go-microservice-boilerplate.git go-microservice-boilerplate2\ngo-microservice-boilerplate2\ngit checkout examples\n .env.example .env\n</code></pre></div><p>Now let’s add this new service to our main  file:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Next, open the  handler of our main service and replace it with the following code.\nThis is just for demonstration — in a real-world setup, you would create a dedicated client inside  and reuse it across the service instead of creating a new connection for every request (since gRPC clients are long-lived):</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><blockquote><p>Note: In the <code>internal/tracing/tracing.go</code> file, make sure to include <code>otel.SetTextMapPropagator(propagation.TraceContext{})</code>. This line is missing from the part-3 source, and without it, traces between multiple services won’t connect properly. You can use either the  or  branch, as both already include this fix.</p></blockquote><p>Now, let’s trigger a request from the first service, which will internally call the second service. We’ll use  for this:</p><div><pre><code>grpcurl  ./proto/hello_world/hello_world.proto  localhost:5000 hello_world.Greeter/SayHello\n</code></pre></div><p>Open Jaeger in your browser, and you should now see a  spanning across two services — one initiating the request, and the other handling it downstream:</p><p>Clicking into the trace reveals the chain of spans showing each step of the process:</p><p>This connected trace gives a clear view of how the request travels through the system — from the first service’s  call, to the gRPC client invocation, and finally to the second service’s  and its database lookup via .</p><p>And that wraps up our  section.\nWe’ve now covered all three pillars — logging, metrics, and tracing — giving you complete visibility into your services. With this setup, you can detect issues early, measure system health, and trace requests across microservices, building a solid foundation for a production-grade monitoring stack.</p><p>In this final part, we extended our microservice with Redis integration, health checks, and full observability using Prometheus metrics and OpenTelemetry tracing. We visualized key performance metrics in Grafana and explored distributed tracing with Jaeger — connecting multiple services to see how requests flow end-to-end.</p><p>With this, our Go Microservice Boilerplate series comes to a close. You now have a solid foundation that combines clean project structure, containerization, configuration management, database integration, service-to-service communication, and observability — everything you need to kickstart a production-grade Go microservice project.</p><p>You can use the <a href=\"https://github.com/SagarMaheshwary/go-microservice-boilerplate\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">master branch</a> of the repository as a ready-to-use boilerplate to start new projects, or explore the <a href=\"https://github.com/SagarMaheshwary/go-microservice-boilerplate/tree/examples\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">examples branch</a> to review all the code samples demonstrated throughout this series.</p><p>Thanks for following along — and happy building!</p>","contentLength":14843,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"HOW TO BUILD A BMI (BODY MASS INDEX) CALCULATOR USING PYTHON","url":"https://dev.to/ikankeabasi_akpaso/how-to-build-a-bmi-body-mass-index-calculator-using-python-5a1k","date":1762003504,"author":"Ikanke-abasi Akpaso","guid":324052,"unread":true,"content":"<p>The Body Mass Index (BMI) is a medical screening tool that uses your weight and height to estimate your body fat percentage and assess your health risk.\nAs a beginner in Python, just like me, a body mass index calculator is one of the simplest and useful projects you can create<p>\nBuilding a BMI calculator involves the following steps:</p></p><h2>\n  \n  \n  1.Set Up your code editor:\n</h2><p>(I use Visual Studio Code) and open a new file (CTRL + N), save it using the name bmi_calculator.py (This is optional, you can call it whatever name you want, but this is preferable for easy referral)</p><p>You’ll want to add a comment on your code editor, which includes the mathematical formula for calculating BMI, as well as the different BMI categories.</p><p>Create a weight variable and a height variable. Both variables will store the input function, input(), which allows for a user’s response. Inside the input function, you can use questions such as Insert your height or What is your weight? whatever your choice is</p><p>Height = float(input(\"What is your height?: \"))\nWeight = float(input(\"What is your weight in kg?: \"))</p><p>The BMI calculation uses kg for weight and meters for height, so it’s better to specify those units in your input. E.g.: Instead of just asking “what’s your weight?”, ask “what’s your weight in kg?”\nWe use float() here to convert the user’s input to a float so python does not read the numbers as a string.</p><p>Next, we create another variable for the BMI calculation. I called mine BMI. In this variable, you store the mathematical formula for calculating the BMI.\nSo we have: BMI = Weight/ (Height *2)<p>\nThe / operator is the division symbol while the * operator is for multiplication.</p>\nJust like in a normal calculator, Division goes before multiplication, but the brackets are solved first before any other operations. In BMI calculation, the height is multiplied first by 2 and then divided by the weight which is the reason for including the bracket.</p><p>After the calculation, you’ll want to create a response back to the individual to tell the value of their BMI and what category it falls under.\nWe can do this using a flow control statement, in this case the if statement. An if statement’s clause will execute if the statement’s condition is True. The clause is skipped if the condition is false.

Copying it manually is tedious and error-prone. This is where Optical Character Recognition (OCR) steps in, and if you haven’t met PaddleOCR yet, prepare for a serious upgrade to your development toolkit. This project solves the fundamental problem of digitizing visual information quickly, accurately, and at scale.</p><p>PaddleOCR is not just a simple text-reading tool; it’s a comprehensive, two-stage system designed for industrial-level performance. When you feed it an image, it doesn't just blindly scan for characters. First, a text detection model locates and draws bounding boxes around all the text regions in the image, effectively separating the text from the background noise and complex layouts. Second, a recognition model zooms into those detected boxes and translates the pixels into actual characters. This separation of duties dramatically increases accuracy, especially when dealing with curved text, varied fonts, or dense documents.</p><p>One of the most compelling reasons developers should jump on this is its incredible deployment flexibility and multilingual support. Whether you are targeting a massive GPU cluster, a standard CPU server, or even specialized AI accelerators like NPUs or XPUs, PaddleOCR is built to run efficiently. This hardware agnosticism, coupled with its robust support for dozens of languages (far beyond just English), makes it a powerhouse for global applications, whether you’re processing receipts in Asia or legal documents in Europe. You get enterprise-grade performance without being locked into specific hardware vendors.</p><p>For the developer workflow, PaddleOCR is a massive time saver. It is designed to be highly accessible, often requiring just a few lines of Python code to integrate via a simple . You don't need a PhD in deep learning to deploy state-of-the-art OCR models. The repository provides highly optimized, pre-trained models that are ready for production use immediately. This means less time spent on training, tuning, and optimizing models, and more time integrating reliable text extraction into features like automated data entry, document indexing, or accessibility tools.</p><p>Ultimately, PaddleOCR provides a fast, accurate, and highly portable solution for turning the world’s images into actionable data. Its combination of detection and recognition models ensures high precision, while its cross-platform compatibility guarantees you can deploy it wherever your application lives. If you need robust text extraction that just works, this is the project you need to check out right now.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  🌟 Stay Connected with GitHub Open Source!\n</h2><blockquote><p>👥 <p>\nConnect with our community and never miss a discovery</p><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/people/GitHub-Open-Source/61571925474856/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">GitHub Open Source</a></p></blockquote>","contentLength":3710,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"The Python Coding Stack: And Now You Know Your ABC","url":"https://www.thepythoncodingstack.com/p/and-now-you-know-your-abc-python-abstract-base-classes","date":1762001571,"author":"","guid":324042,"unread":true,"content":"<p>I may have already mentioned in a previous post that I’ve rekindled an old passion: track and field athletics. I’m even writing about it in another publication:  (look out for the new series on sprint biomechanics, if you’re so inclined!)</p><p>This post is inspired by a brief thought that crossed my mind when I considered writing software to assist my club—in the end, I chose not to. (But I already volunteer three hours a week coaching members of the youth team. So no, I don’t feel guilty.)</p><p>Here’s the task. I want to create a class to represent a track and field event held in a competition. This entry allows you to enter the raw results as reported by the officials—the athlete’s bib number and the time they clocked in a race. It then computes the event’s full results.</p><p>A good starting point is to define two classes,  and . I’ll focus on the  class in this post, so I’ll keep the  class fairly basic:</p><div><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!8Ehp!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F70c5b762-5b29-4520-b588-7d3b8b29b8d8_1200x294.png\"></a>All code blocks are available in text format at the end of this article • #1 • <em>The code images used in this article are created using <a href=\"https://snappify.cello.so/f4AsFrwgwov\">Snappify.</a> [Affiliate link]</em></div><p>There’s more we could add to make this class more complete. But I won’t. You can create a list of athletes that are competing in the track and field meeting:</p><p>To make it easy and efficient to obtain the  object just from a bib number, you can create a  dictionary:</p><p>The dictionary’s keys are the bib numbers as integers and the values are the  objects. Therefore, <code>print(bib_to_athlete[259].name)</code> displays .</p><p>Now, let’s move to the  class:</p><p>Let’s go through the data attributes in :</p><ul><li><p> is a string with the name of the event. You could use other data types, such as an , but I’ll keep this simple here and use a string.</p></li><li><p> is a list containing  instances. These are the athletes participating in this particular event at the track and field meeting.</p></li><li><p> contains each athlete’s performance. We have choices. The simplest option is to use a list of tuples, where each tuple contains the athlete and the performance. However, since we’re working in the object-oriented domain, perhaps we could create a  class, and  becomes a list of  instances.</p></li></ul><p>So, let’s create the  class at the top of the script:</p><p>We’ll show an example of  and  instances soon. But first we need some methods. Let’s get back to the  class and define , which allows you to add a raw result in the format provided by the officials—the officials only provide the bib number and the performance, such as the time clocked by the athlete:</p><p>You add checks for the scenarios when a bib number doesn’t match any athlete in the whole meeting or when the bib number doesn’t match any athlete in the specific event. The dictionary  method returns  by default if the key is not present in the dictionary.</p><p>If the bib number is valid, you create a  instance and add it to .</p><p>Once you add all the results from the officials, you’re ready to finalise the results:</p><p>This method sorts the list of results based on the value of the  data attribute.</p><p>Let’s try this class to see everything is as we expect:</p><p>You create an  instance for the 100m sprint race. Then you add three individual results. Finally, you finalise the results to get the athletes and their positions in the race.</p><p>Since  sorts based on the performace, the athlete with the fastest time takes the first position in the list, and so on. Here’s the output from the  loop displaying the athletes in  in order:</p><pre><code>Usain Bolt: 9.58\nCarl Lewis: 9.86\nJesse Owens: 10.3</code></pre><p>Usain Bolt is first with the fastest time, followed by Carl Lewis, and Jesse Owens in third. Everything seems to be working well… But “It works” are the two most dangerous words in programming!</p><h2><strong>It’s Time For The Long Jump</strong></h2><p>The long jump results come in next from the officials. You know how to input the data and finalise the results now:</p><p>And here are the results displayed:</p><pre><code>Carl Lewis: 8.87\nMike Powell: 8.95</code></pre><p>But, but… Mike Powell’s 8.95m is better than Carl Lewis’s 8.87m. The order is wrong!</p><p>Of course! In the 100m sprint the fastest time wins, and the fastest time is the lowest number. But in the long jump it’s the longest jump that wins, and that’s the largest number!</p><p>The  method no longer works for the long jump or for other field events. For field events, the sorting needs to happen in reverse order.</p><p>There are several ways to deal with this problem. There are always several ways to solve a problem in programming.</p><p>The simplest is to add an  Boolean data attribute in  and then add an  statement in . And if this were the only difference between running and field events, this would indeed be a fine option.</p><p>However, if there are more differences to account for, the extra fields and  statements scattered throughout the class make the class harder to maintain.</p><p>So, let’s look at another option.</p><h2><strong>Creating Separate Classes for Track Events and Field Events</strong></h2><p>You could create two classes instead of one:  and . Each class will take care of getting the  method right and also deal with any other differences we may find between track events and field events.</p><p>However, you don’t want to create two unrelated classes since these classes will have a lot in common. Sure, you can copy and paste the code that’s common between the two classes, but you don’t need me to tell you that’s not a good idea. Will you remember to make changes in both places when you decide to change the implementation later?</p><p>You also want to make sure they have the same data attribute names for similar things. For example, you don’t want one class to have  and the other , say, or change the spelling by mistake. Now, I know you’ll pay attention when creating these methods to make sure this doesn’t happen, but why take the risk?</p><p>And when you come back to your code in six months’ time (or a colleague starts working on the code) and you decide you need another class that follows the same principles, will you remember what methods you need to include? You can spend time studying your old classes, of course. But wouldn’t you like to make your life a bit simpler? Of course you would.</p><p>However,  shouldn’t inherit from  since a track event  a field event. The same applies the other way around. These classes are siblings, so they can’t have a parent-child relationship.</p><p>Instead, they could both inherit from a common parent. So, let’s keep the  class as a common parent for both  and .</p><p>However, the only purpose of  is to serve as a starting point for the two child classes. You no longer want a user to create instances of  now that you have  and . They should only create instances of  or . How can you make this clear in your code and perhaps even prevent users from creating an instance of the parent class, ?</p><h2><strong>Abstract Base Classes (ABCs)</strong></h2><p>The answer is Abstract Base Classes, often shortened to ABCs. The ABC acronym gives the impression these are as easy as ABC—they’re not, but there’s no reason they need to be difficult, either. The title of this article is also a reference to a rhyme my children used to sing when they were toddlers learning their ABC!</p><p>Let’s refresh your memory about different terms often used to describe the inheritance relationship between classes:</p><ul><li><p>You can refer to  and . The child class inherits from the parent class.</p></li><li><p>Or you can refer to  and . The subclass inherits from the superclass. This is where the built-in  gets its name.</p></li><li><p>Or you can refer to  and . The derived class inherits from the base class.</p></li></ul><p>Whatever terms you choose to use, they refer to the same things!</p><p>So, an ABC is a base class, since other classes are derived from it. That deals with the BC in ABC. And it’s abstract because you’re never going to create a concrete instance of this class.</p><p>You’re not meant to create an instance of an abstract base class and often you’ll be prevented from doing so. But you can use it to derive other classes.</p><p>Let’s turn  into an abstract base class:</p><p>The changes from the previous version are highlighted. Let’s go through each change:</p><ul><li><p>From the  module—and now you know what these letters stand for—you import  and . You’ll see both of these referred to and explained in the bullets below.</p></li><li><p>When you define the  class, you include  as its base or parent class. When a class inherits from the  class, the class itself becomes an abstract base class. Anyone reading your code will immediately understand the role of this class.</p></li><li><p>You add the  decorator before defining  and you also remove the contents of this method. Since you can’t leave the body of a function or method blank, you include the  statement as the method’s body. This method doesn’t do anything, but it’s there, and it’s marked as an abstract method. Let’s see what this means…</p></li></ul><p>Here’s what you’re effectively stating when you create this ABC with the  abstract method: Any class derived from the  ABC  include a  method.</p><p>Let’s explore this by defining  and . At first, you’ll keep them simple:</p><p>You define the two new classes  and . They inherit from , which is an abstract base class. You just include  as the body of each class for now. This means that these classes inherit everything from the parent class and have no changes or additions. They’re identical to the parent class.</p><p>Note that you now use  and  to create instances for the 100m race and the long jump.</p><p>However, you get an error when you try to create these instances:</p><pre><code>Traceback (most recent call last):\n  File ... line 53, in &lt;module&gt;\n    track_100m = TrackEvent(\n        “100m Sprint”,\n        [bib_to_athlete[259], bib_to_athlete[161], bib_to_athlete[362]]\n    )\nTypeError: Can’t instantiate abstract class TrackEvent without\n    an implementation for abstract method ‘finalise_results’</code></pre><p>The abstract base class includes the method , which is marked as an abstract method. Python is expecting a concrete implementation of this method. Any class that inherits from the  ABC  have a concrete implementation of this method. Let’s fix this:</p><p>In , you include the same code you had in the original  since this algorithm works well for track events where the smallest numbers (the fastest times) represent the best performances.</p><p>However, you pass  to  in <code>FieldEvent.finalise_results()</code> since the largest numbers (longest distances) represent the best performances in this case.</p><p>You can now try these new classes on the 100m race results and the long jump results you used earlier:</p><p>You now use the new derived classes  and  in this code instead of . You also add two new printouts to separate the results.</p><pre><code>100m Sprint Results:\nUsain Bolt: 9.58\nCarl Lewis: 9.86\nJesse Owens: 10.3\n​\nLong Jump Results:\nMike Powell: 8.95\nCarl Lewis: 8.87</code></pre><p>The 100m results show the fastest times (smallest values) as the best performances. The long jump results show the longer jump (larger value) as the best performance. All as it should be!</p><h2><strong>Wind Readings and Breaking Ties</strong></h2><p>But there are more differences we need to account for. In some track and field events, the wind reading matters. In these events, if the wind reading is larger than 2.0 m/s, the results still stand but the performances cannot be used for official records.</p><p>But does this affect track events or field events? So should you account for this in the  class or in the  class?</p><p>It’s not so simple. Wind readings matter in some track events, but not all. And they also matter in some field events, but not all. So, you have a different subset of events to account for now. The 100m, 200m, 110m hurdles and 100m hurdles, which are all track events, are in the same category as the long jump and triple jump, which are field events.</p><p>But before we find a solution for this, here’s something else to mess things up even more. What happens when there’s a tie—when two athletes have the same performance value? The tie-breaking rules also depend on the event. Let’s ignore the track events here, since depending on what timing system is used, it’s either the officials who decide or the higher precision times from the automatic timing systems.</p><p>But what about the field events? In most of them, if there’s a tie, the next best performance is taken into account. However, the rules are different for the high jump and pole vault events where there’s a count back system used. Explaining the rules of track and field is not the purpose of this article, so I won’t!</p><p>So that’s yet another subset to consider: tie breaks in the vertical jumps are different from tie breaks in the horizontal jumps and throws.</p><p>How can we account for all these subsets of events?</p><p>There are always many solutions to the same problem. You can extend the idea of using ABCs to cater for all options. But the Venn diagram of which event falls under which category is a bit complicated in this case.</p><p>The 100m, 200m, 100m hurdles and 110m hurdles are all track events affected by wind readings. But the long jump and triple jump are also affected by wind readings but they’re field events. The discus and other throw events are field events—so the longest throw wins—but aren’t affected by high wind readings. And the long jump, triple jump, and the throws have a next-best jump/throw tie-breaking rule. But the pole vault and high jump are field events not affected by the wind but with different tie-breaking rules.</p><p>Are you still with me? Confused? Can you think of an abstract base class structure to account for all these combinations. It’s not impossible, but you’ll need several layers in the hierarchy.</p><p>Instead, I’ll explore a different route in a second article, which I’ll publish soon!</p><p><em>The follow-up article will be part of</em> The Club  The Python Coding Stack. <em>These are the articles for paid subscribers.

Unified Data Model: “Nodes” Over Multiple Tables\n</h2><p>Early in development, I realized that managing <strong>categories, documents, and files</strong> as separate entities was becoming painful.<p>\nEvery new feature — especially </p> and  — required deeper joins and complex recursive queries.</p><p>Here’s what the early structure looked like conceptually:</p><div><pre><code>Workspace\n ├── Category A\n │    ├── Document 1\n │    └── Document 2\n └── Category B\n      ├── Subcategory\n      │    └── Document 3\n</code></pre></div><h3>\n  \n  \n  1.1 The problem with separate tables\n</h3><p>Having multiple tables (, , ) worked fine until I introduced access control.<p>\nAt that point, even simple questions like “what can this user see in this subtree?” required multiple recursive joins.</p><p>\nPerformance and maintainability started to suffer.</p></p><h3>\n  \n  \n  1.2 The unified “nodes” approach\n</h3><p>The solution was to merge everything into a  — a unified model where everything is a .</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>With this model, every element — document, folder, file — became a node.\nThis made the hierarchy recursive but uniform, enabling simple queries like:</p><blockquote><p>“What can user X access in this subtree?”</p></blockquote><p>Now, permission propagation and tree traversal both use a single recursive CTE or indexed path column, drastically improving maintainability and speed.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  2. Scalable Permission System\n</h2><p>Building permissions on top of the nodes table required careful thought. I adopted a hybrid approach:</p><p>A separate permissions table maps , , .</p><p>On access checks, the system checks:</p><ul><li>If the user owns the target node</li><li>If a direct permission exists</li><li>If any ancestor node grants sufficient permission</li></ul><p>This balances fine-grained control and inheritance — users get access to everything under a node they’ve been granted permission for, without repeated recursive checks.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  3. Backend Stack: Go + REST + Modular Design\n</h2><p>Language &amp; framework: Go (Gin) — lightweight and performant for API endpoints.</p><ul><li>: Go (Gin) — for its simplicity, performance, and clean REST design.</li><li>: MySQL (or compatible) — raw SQL for critical queries like subtree retrieval.</li><li>: S3-compatible (MinIO, RustFS) — abstracted via a pluggable service for self-hosted setups.</li></ul><p>The API uses a flat structure (, , ) — simple, predictable, and easy to version.</p><p>I separated business logic from data access (DAO layer) to keep the backend maintainable and extensible.\nThis paid off when refactoring: new storage backends or permission engines can now be added with minimal changes.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  4. Frontend Architecture: Data management\n</h2><p>Surprisingly, the hardest part of building Alexandrie’s frontend wasn’t the UI — it was the data layer.\nRepresenting thousands of interlinked notes in a reactive, permission-aware tree required careful design.</p><p>In Alexandrie, .\nA node can be a workspace, category, document, or resource — and each can contain others.<p>\nThat means infinite nesting, partial hydration, and live updates when any part of the tree changes.</p></p><p>In Alexandrie, everything is a Node.\nEach node can be a workspace, category, document, or resource, and every node can contain others — effectively forming a tree structure that must remain reactive, searchable, and permission-aware across the app.</p><ul><li>Nested data: Users can nest documents/categories/resources infinitely deep.</li><li>Partial hydration: Nodes are often fetched lazily or shared publicly, so the store must handle both partial and fully-hydrated nodes.</li><li>Permission inheritance: Access rights propagate through parent nodes.</li><li>Real-time reactivity: Any node update must immediately reflect across trees, search results, and UI components.</li><li>Performance: Traversing large trees shouldn’t cause noticeable slowdowns.</li></ul><p>I built a dedicated Pinia store (useNodesStore) combined with a TreeStructure utility that keeps all nodes in a flat Collection (essentially a reactive Map), and reconstructs the hierarchical tree on demand.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Then, a dedicated  class handles building the actual trees efficiently:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><ul><li>O(1) access to any node via itemMap</li><li>Efficient subtree generation (only rebuild what’s needed)</li><li>A clean way to filter, search, or recompute derived data (tags, permissions, etc.)</li><li>Integration with Pinia’s reactivity: the entire graph updates live when a node changes.</li></ul><p>Here are some high-level takeaways:</p><ul><li><p>Unify your data model early. Splitting multiple tables will bite you when adding features like permissions and sharing.</p></li><li><p>Favor simplicity in API contracts. Flat endpoints scale better than deeply nested resource structures.</p></li><li><p>Design for extensibility, not just immediate features. Adding plugin-like syntax blocks or alternate storage later becomes much easier.</p></li></ul><p>Permissions and hierarchy are hard. Caching accessible node sets and flattening ancestors helps avoid recursive query bottlenecks. </p><h2>\n  \n  \n  What’s Next &amp; How to Contribute\n</h2><p>Alexandrie is open-source and welcomes contributors.

It didn’t promise “magic” frameworks or a hundred shortcuts.<p>\nIt just offered speed, simplicity, and structure — and that was exactly what I needed.</p></p><p>*\nGo was created at Google to solve a real problem:<p>\nLarge, complex systems that were getting slower and harder to maintain.</p></p><p>The goal was simple — create a language that’s easy to read, fast to run, and effortless to deploy.\nThat philosophy still shows in every line of Go code.</p><p>From its clean syntax to its built-in tools, everything feels designed for clarity and productivity.\nHere’s what makes it special 👇</p><p>*<em>⚡ 1. Simplicity That Doesn’t Sacrifice Power\n*</em>\nGo has no unnecessary complexity.<p>\nNo inheritance, no endless dependencies, and very little boilerplate.</p>\nIt’s a language that forces you to focus on solving the problem, not fighting the syntax.</p><div><pre><code>package main\nimport \"fmt\"\n\nfunc main() {\n    fmt.Println(\"Hello, Go!\")\n}\n</code></pre></div><p>That’s a complete Go program — no setup files, no configuration chaos.\nYou can compile it, run it, and deploy it in seconds.</p><p>This simplicity means fewer bugs, faster learning, and a smoother path from idea to execution.</p><p>*<em>🚀 2. Performance That Feels Effortless\n*</em>\nGo is a compiled language, so your code runs directly on the machine — not through an interpreter.<p>\nThat gives you C-like performance with Python-like ease of writing.</p></p><p>You don’t need to tweak garbage collection or write complex optimizations.\nGo handles performance gracefully while letting you focus on business logic.</p><p>For developers building APIs or scalable services, that’s a huge win.</p><p>*<em>🧵 3. Concurrency Made for Humans\n*</em>\nConcurrency (running multiple tasks at once) is where Go truly shines.<p>\nMost languages make it complicated — Go makes it beautifully simple.</p></p><p>With goroutines, you can run lightweight, concurrent tasks using just one keyword:</p><p>That’s it. No threads, no heavy setup.\nYou can serve thousands of simultaneous requests efficiently — perfect for modern web backends and microservices.</p><p>*<em>🧩 4. A Batteries-Included Standard Library\n*</em>\nGo doesn’t need a huge ecosystem to get started.<p>\nIts standard library already includes everything you need for real-world backend work:</p></p><p>JSON handling (encoding/json)</p><p>Testing (testing package)</p><p>That means less time hunting for third-party packages, and more time building actual software.</p><p>*<em>🌍 5. A Growing, Practical Community\n*</em>\nThe Go community is one of the most pragmatic developer spaces out there.<p>\nIt’s not about hype — it’s about real-world results.</p></p><p>From startups to giants like Google, Uber, and Docker, Go powers production systems at scale.\nYou’ll find endless tutorials, open-source projects, and helpful developers who care about clean, efficient code.</p><p>*\nI chose Go because it fits how I think:<p>\nI like to build things that work, scale, and make sense.</p></p><p>With Go, I spend less time debugging and more time creating.\nIt’s a language that rewards good habits — and punishes bad ones gently but effectively.</p><p>Every line of Go code teaches you something about clarity, structure, and performance.</p><p>*<em>💡 My Advice for New Developers\n*</em>\nIf you’re just starting out in backend development, here’s my honest advice 👇</p><p>Start simple. Don’t chase every new framework.</p><p>Build small projects — APIs, CLI tools, or simple web apps.</p><p>Read Go code. Learn from open-source projects.</p><p>Focus on fundamentals — data flow, concurrency, and clean code matter more than fancy tools.</p><p>You’ll be amazed how much you can build with just Go’s standard library and a bit of curiosity.</p><p>*\nThis article is the start of a series I’m writing about learning Go from the ground up — from building your first API to deploying it in production.<p>\nIf you’re on a similar journey, follow me here on Medium.</p>\nLet’s learn, experiment, and grow together — one Go project at a time. 🚀</p><p>*<em>🎓 Coming Next: A Beginner-Friendly Go Course\n*</em>\nAfter sharing my journey with Go and why I chose it as my main backend language, I’ve decided to take things a step further.<p>\nI’m launching a complete Go course for beginners — a hands-on series that will take you from writing your first line of code to building real-world projects.</p></p><p>We’ll cover everything from the basics and API building to file handling and concurrency — all explained clearly and simply.</p><p> so you don’t miss the first lesson — coming very soon! 🚀</p><p><code>**Thanks for reading**! 🙌</code>\n**If you enjoyed this post, drop a 👏 or comment below — your support means a lot.<p>\nLet’s connect and share ideas!</p></p>","contentLength":4832,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Tech With Tim: 3 Unique Python Features You NEED To Know","url":"https://dev.to/vibe_youtube/tech-with-tim-3-unique-python-features-you-need-to-know-ane","date":1761991723,"author":"Vibe YouTube","guid":323986,"unread":true,"content":"<p>3 Unique Python Features You NEED To Know dives into three underrated but super handy tools: the new  statement that replaces messy  chains with clean pattern matching,  to auto-generate boilerplate for your classes, and the sometimes overlooked positional-only &amp; keyword-only arguments that make your function signatures crystal clear.</p><p>Tim walks you through real-world examples so you can start using these features today and level up your Python code.</p>","contentLength":452,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"What I Learned While Installing Python","url":"https://dev.to/wazcodes/what-i-learned-while-installing-python-2o5o","date":1761991207,"author":"Mohamed Wazeem","guid":323985,"unread":true,"content":"<ol><li>Download the Python installer based on your operating system.</li><li>Install Python using the downloaded file.\n\n<ul><li>Make sure you check “Add Python to PATH” if you are using Windows.</li></ul></li></ol><p>Since my school days, I’ve installed Python many times and even helped others do it.

Imagine transforming blurry, low-resolution pictures into crisp, high-definition masterpieces, revealing hidden information previously lost in the noise. It's now possible to unlock the full potential of your visual data, thanks to a new AI technique that's revolutionizing image enhancement.</p><p>This innovative approach leverages what's known as \"guided conditional flow matching\" to achieve superior super-resolution. In essence, it learns a sophisticated pattern of how low-resolution images should evolve into high-resolution versions, even when those initial images are riddled with noise. It’s like teaching an AI to connect the dots, filling in the missing pieces with remarkable accuracy.</p><p>The magic lies in its ability to understand the underlying structure of the image, even in the presence of significant distortions. This allows the AI to extrapolate details beyond what's actually visible in the original, creating images with exceptional clarity and fidelity. Think of it as a highly skilled restorer meticulously cleaning a damaged painting, revealing its original beauty.</p><ul><li> Dramatically improve the resolution of your existing image datasets.</li><li> Achieve superior results even with noisy or corrupted images.</li><li> Uncover hidden details that were previously obscured.</li><li> Enable more accurate analysis and interpretation of visual data.</li><li> Integrate this technology into your existing image processing pipelines.</li><li> Gain access to pixel-level confidence data, allowing for informed decision-making.</li></ul><p>One potential implementation challenge lies in the intensive computational resources needed for model training, but clever data augmentation strategies during training can help to mitigate this. For example, synthetically adding noise to training data can dramatically improve performance with real-world noisy images. Beyond scientific imaging, consider using this to enhance historical photographs for archival purposes, breathing new life into faded memories.</p><p>This breakthrough promises to reshape various fields, from medical imaging to satellite surveillance. By offering an unparalleled level of clarity and detail, this technology empowers us to see the world in a whole new light.

It's failing because you're still choosing.</strong></p><p>I've watched brilliant developers spend three months debating whether to use Django or FastAPI. I've seen teams rewrite entire codebases switching from monolith to microservices before getting their first customer. I've witnessed startups collapse under the weight of features nobody asked for.</p><p>The irony? They all thought they were being \"smart\" and \"strategic.\"</p><p>They were just overthinking themselves to death.</p><p>Here's what every developer believes:</p><p><em>\"If I just pick the perfect framework, everything else will fall into place.\"</em></p><p>So you spend weeks researching. You read comparison articles. You watch YouTube tutorials. You ask on Reddit. You create spreadsheets comparing Django vs Laravel vs Spring Boot.</p><p>And you know what all that research gets you?</p><p>Because here's the secret the tech influencers won't tell you: </p><p>Think about it. What's actually different between these frameworks?</p><ul><li> (who cares where your files live?)</li><li> (they all route HTTP requests)</li><li> (different syntax, same concept)</li><li> (all talk to databases)</li></ul><p>That's it. That's the big difference everyone obsesses over.</p><p>You want to build an ERP system? You can do it with:</p><ul></ul><p><strong>All of them work. All of them scale. All of them can make you money.</strong></p><p>The only questions that actually matter:</p><ol><li><strong>Which one do you already know?</strong></li><li><strong>Which one has good community support?</strong></li><li><strong>Which one can you ship fastest with?</strong></li></ol><p>That's it. Three questions. Not three months of research.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  The Real Question You Should Ask\n</h2><p>Stop asking: <em>\"Which framework is better?\"</em></p><p>Start asking: <em>\"Which framework gets me to market fastest?\"</em></p><p>If you know Python and Django, use Django. If you're comfortable with JavaScript and Express, use Express. If you've built three projects in Laravel, use Laravel.</p><p><strong>Choose the tool you're comfortable with and move on.</strong></p><p>Your users don't care if you built their solution in Django or FastAPI. They care if it solves their problem. They care if it works. They care if you ship it before your competitor does.</p><p>But framework paralysis is just the beginning.</p><p>Once you finally pick a framework, the feature creep starts:</p><p><em>\"We might need multi-currency support in the future...\"</em><em>\"What if we expand to mobile later?\"</em><em>\"Should we build an AI recommendation engine now?\"</em><em>\"Users might want dark mode...\"</em></p><p><strong>Build what users need TODAY. Not what they might need in 2027.</strong></p><p>I've seen it a hundred times. A startup spends eight months building the \"perfect\" product with every imaginable feature. They launch with pride, expecting applause.</p><p>Nobody uses 80% of the features. Turns out, users just needed a simple way to track invoices. Everything else was developer fantasy.</p><p>Your users have actual problems right now. They need solutions right now. They don't care about your:</p><ul><li>Perfectly architected microservices</li><li>Cutting-edge framework choice</li><li>Scalable-to-a-billion-users infrastructure</li></ul><p>They care about solving their immediate pain point.</p><p>Build that. Ship that. Get feedback. Iterate.</p><p>Everything else is procrastination dressed up as \"best practices.\"</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  The Monolith vs Microservices Trap\n</h2><p>Here comes my favorite time-waster: the architecture debate.</p><p><em>\"Should we build a monolith or microservices?\"</em></p><p><strong>Start with a monolith. Period.</strong></p><p>\"But what about scaling?\" you ask.</p><p><strong>You don't have scaling problems. You have zero customers.</strong></p><p>Here's how it actually works:</p><ol><li>When traffic actually becomes a problem (not when you imagine it might), then consider microservices</li></ol><p>You know who uses monoliths? Shopify handled billions in sales on a Rails monolith for years. Stack Overflow runs on a monolith. Basecamp built a $100M business on a monolith.</p><p>You know who needs microservices from day one? Almost nobody.</p><p>Microservices are a solution to problems you don't have yet. They add complexity, deployment overhead, debugging nightmares, and network latency. All to solve scaling issues you'll face when you have thousands of concurrent users.</p><p><strong>You have zero users. Build the monolith.</strong></p><p>Let me share something that should terrify you:</p><p><strong>90% of SaaS projects never make it to profitability.</strong></p><p>It's not because they chose the wrong framework. It's not because they didn't build microservices. It's not because they missed a feature.</p><p><strong>They failed because they never shipped.</strong></p><p>They overthought. They over-engineered. They over-planned. They built features nobody wanted. They rewrote code that already worked. They optimized for problems they didn't have.</p><p>Meanwhile, their competitors shipped a basic MVP in six weeks, got real users, learned what actually mattered, and iterated.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  The Path to Success Is Embarrassingly Simple\n</h2><p>Here's the formula successful developers follow:</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  1. Pick a Framework (Take 1 Day, Not 1 Month)\n</h3><ul><li>Don't know any? Pick the one with the most Stack Overflow answers.</li></ul><h3>\n  \n  \n  2. Build Only What's Required (Take 4-6 Weeks)\n</h3><ul><li>Talk to 5 potential users</li><li>List their top 3 pain points</li><li>Build solutions for those 3 things</li></ul><ul></ul><h3>\n  \n  \n  4. Get Feedback (Ongoing)\n</h3><ul><li>Real users tell you what actually matters</li><li>They'll request features you never considered</li><li>They'll ignore features you thought were essential</li></ul><ul><li>Remove what they don't use</li></ul><p>Notice what's not in this formula?</p><ul><li>Endless framework comparisons</li><li>\"Future-proof\" architecture</li></ul><p>You're not overthinking because you're thorough. You're overthinking because you're scared.</p><p>Scared to ship something imperfect. Scared of criticism. Scared of failure.</p><p>So you hide behind \"research\" and \"best practices\" and \"doing it right.\"</p><p>But here's the thing: <strong>Done beats perfect. Every. Single. Time.</strong></p><p>That imperfect product you ship today teaches you more than six months of planning ever will. Those early users with complaints? They're giving you a roadmap to success.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Start Today, Not Tomorrow\n</h2><p>Stop debating frameworks. Stop planning features users haven't requested. Stop designing for traffic you don't have.</p><p>Choose a framework you know. Build the core feature. Ship it this month.</p><p>Will it be perfect? No.<p>\nWill it scale to a million users? Probably not yet.</p><p>\nWill it have every feature you imagine? Definitely not.</p></p><p>Will it be REAL? Yes.<p>\nWill it get you FEEDBACK? Yes.</p><p>\nWill it teach you what users ACTUALLY want? Absolutely.</p></p><p>And that's worth more than all the perfect architecture in the world.</p><p>Close this tab. Open your code editor. Pick a framework—any framework you're comfortable with. Write the first 100 lines of code today.</p><p>Not tomorrow. Not after you finish that comparison article. Not after you watch one more tutorial.</p><p>Your future successful self will thank you for starting. Your overthinking current self will thank you for stopping.</p><p>The best time to start was yesterday. The second best time is right now.</p><p><em>What's the biggest thing you're overthinking right now?

This project introduced me to Godot, and the custom programming language used in it called GDScript, which was easy to pick up on as it's very similar to Python.

By the time I had done all that, someone had swooped in and done the PR, one that had been sitting untouched since August. This one hurt, as it would have been a great addition to my Release 0.2, but I took it on the chin and will hopefully use the knowledge I gained to contribute to wesnoth in the future.</p><p>Finally, I turned my focus not to just contributing to a game itself, but the game engine that made it possible.

Crazy enough, there was thousands of issues open, but nothing labelled for first timers. I just took on the first thing I thought I could help with, and it turned out to be an easy fix, but if it gets merged I'll still feel incredible being able to help contribute to something this cool.</p><p>In the end, I walk away from this experience with a renewed confidence, and with an eye on several interesting projects that I plan to continue to contribute to in the future.</p>","contentLength":2642,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Tech With Tim: 3 Unique Python Features You NEED To Know","url":"https://dev.to/vibe_youtube/tech-with-tim-3-unique-python-features-you-need-to-know-2k80","date":1761962944,"author":"Vibe YouTube","guid":323852,"unread":true,"content":"<p>Tech With Tim walks you through three modern Python features you’ve probably never used but really should: the new  statement for pattern matching, the handy  decorator to cut down boilerplate, and the trick of enforcing positional-only or keyword-only arguments for cleaner APIs.</p><p>He also plugs a 20% off Brilliant Premium deal for free problem-solving practice and his DevLaunch mentorship program to help you build real projects and land a job.</p>","contentLength":447,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Dictionary in Python (5)","url":"https://dev.to/hyperkai/dictionary-in-python-5-3ooo","date":1761962615,"author":"Super Kai (Kazuya Ito)","guid":323851,"unread":true,"content":"<p>A dictionary and other dictionary can be checked if only all the keys or both all the keys and values in:</p><ul><li>the dictionary are in other dictionary with .</li><li>the dictionary and only other keys or both other keys and values are in other dictionary with .</li><li>other dictionary are in the dictionary with .</li><li>other dictionary and only other keys or both other keys and values are in the dictionary with .</li></ul><ul><li>Only all the values cannot be checked.</li><li> and  work for all , ,  and .</li><li> and  get error for all , ,  and .</li></ul><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>A dictionary and other dictionary can be checked if they have and don't have only their common keys or both their common keys and values with  and  and with  keyword and  respectively as shown below:</p><ul><li>Only their common values cannot be checked.</li><li> and  work.</li><li> and  get error.</li></ul><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><div><pre><code></code></pre></div>","contentLength":755,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"The Async Iterator Part 2: Streaming Data and Real-World Patterns","url":"https://dev.to/aaron_rose_0787cc8b4775a0/the-async-iterator-part-2-streaming-data-and-real-world-patterns-kdj","date":1761959776,"author":"Aaron Rose","guid":323829,"unread":true,"content":"<p>The next morning, Timothy arrived at the library early, eager to apply what he'd learned about async iteration.

The syntax is always  inside the comprehension.\"</p><p>She wrote out the patterns:</p><div><pre><code>Async Comprehension Syntax:\n\nList:  [expr async for item in async_iter]\nSet:   {expr async for item in async_iter}\nDict:  {key: val async for item in async_iter}\n\nWith filtering:\n[expr async for item in async_iter if condition]\n\nRegular comprehensions:  for item in iter\nAsync comprehensions:    async for item in async_iter\n                         ^^^^^ just add async!\n</code></pre></div><h2>\n  \n  \n  When NOT to Use Async Comprehensions\n</h2><p>\"One warning,\" Margaret said. \"Async comprehensions build the entire result in memory. If you're processing a huge stream of data, this can be a problem.\"</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>\"The comprehension forces you to wait for all data before processing,\" Margaret explained. \"Sometimes you want that—when you need the complete dataset. But for large streams, iterate directly with .\"</p><p>Timothy nodded. \"So comprehensions are for collecting finite datasets, but direct iteration is for processing streams.\"</p><p>\"Exactly. Think about it like regular Python: you wouldn't load a 10GB file into a list comprehension. Same principle applies here.\"</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Real Async File I/O with aiofiles\n</h2><p>\"Let's move to something more practical,\" Margaret said. \"In Part 1, I mentioned that Python's built-in  blocks the event loop. Let me show you the real solution.\"</p><p>She opened a terminal and typed:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><div><pre><code>Setting up demo file...\nReading with async I/O...\n[Background task 0]\n  Line 1\n  Line 2\n[Background task 1]\n  Line 3\n[Background task 2]\n</code></pre></div><p>\"See how the background task runs  file reading?\" Margaret pointed out. \"With regular , the entire event loop would block on the file I/O, and the background task couldn't run until reading was complete.\"</p><p>\"The key differences,\" she continued, typing out a comparison:</p><div><pre><code>Regular File I/O vs Async File I/O:\n\nRegular (blocks event loop):\n    with open(path, 'r') as f:\n        for line in f:\n            process(line)\n\nAsync (cooperates with event loop):\n    async with aiofiles.open(path, 'r') as f:\n        async for line in f:\n            await process(line)\n\nDifferences:\n1. async with instead of with\n2. aiofiles.open() instead of open()\n3. async for instead of for\n4. Can await inside the loop\n</code></pre></div><h2>\n  \n  \n  Async Context Managers + Async Iteration\n</h2><p>Timothy studied the code. \"I see  and  together. How does that work?\"</p><p>\"Great observation,\" Margaret said. \"Let me explain async context managers first, then show how they combine with async iteration.\"</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><div><pre><code>  Opening database connection...\nInside async with block\nGot 3 results\n  Closing database connection...\nOutside async with block - connection closed\n</code></pre></div><p>\"An async context manager uses  and must define  and  as coroutines,\" Margaret explained. \"It's like a regular context manager, but async.\"</p><div><pre><code>Regular Context Manager:\n    with resource():\n        use()\n    # Cleanup happens here\n\nAsync Context Manager:\n    async with resource():\n        await use()\n    # Async cleanup happens here\n\nBoth guarantee cleanup, but async version can await during setup/teardown\n</code></pre></div><h2>\n  \n  \n  Combining Async Context Managers with Async Iteration\n</h2><p>\"Now here's where it gets powerful,\" Margaret said. \"You can combine  and  for safe streaming.\"</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><div><pre><code>  Opening cursor...\nFetching books:\n  Book 0\n  Book 1\n  Book 2\n  Book 3\n  Book 4\n  Closing cursor...\nCursor automatically closed\n</code></pre></div><p>\"This pattern is incredibly common with databases,\" Margaret said. \"The cursor is both a context manager (for resource cleanup) and an async iterator (for fetching rows).\"</p><p>Timothy was impressed. \"So  ensures the cursor gets closed, and  streams the results?\"</p><p>\"Exactly. Even if an error occurs during iteration,  will be called to clean up the cursor.\"</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Error Handling in Async Iteration\n</h2><p>\"Speaking of errors,\" Timothy said, \"what happens if an async iterator fails partway through?\"</p><p>\"Excellent question,\" Margaret said. \"Let me show you.\"</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><div><pre><code>Processing with error handling:\n  Processing: Record 0\n  Processing: Record 1\n  Processing: Record 2\n  ERROR: Database error at record 3\n  Successfully processed 3 records before error\nFinished (processed 3 records)\n</code></pre></div><p>\"The  loop stops when an exception is raised,\" Margaret explained. \"You handle it the same way as regular iteration—with try/except.\"</p><p>She showed a more robust pattern:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>\"This pattern is common for network requests or database queries that might fail transiently,\" Margaret said.</p><p>\"One critical point,\" Margaret added. \"When an exception occurs in an  loop, Python automatically calls  on the generator.\"</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><div><pre><code>Demo: Cleanup on error\n  [Generator] Starting\n  Got value: 0\n  Got value: 1\n  [Generator] Cleanup running (finally block)\n  Caught error: Simulated error\nFinished\n</code></pre></div><p>\"See how the  block runs even though we raised an error?\" Margaret pointed out. \"Python ensures cleanup happens. This is why  blocks in generators are perfect for closing files, releasing locks, or cleaning up resources.\"</p><p>\"One important detail,\" Margaret added. \"If your cleanup code needs to  anything—like closing a network connection or flushing a buffer—your generator must be an . The  block can contain  statements because the whole generator is a coroutine.\"</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><div><pre><code>  Acquiring resource\n  Got: data\n  Closing resource...\n  Resource closed\n</code></pre></div><p>\"If this were a regular generator ( instead of ), you couldn't use  in the  block,\" Margaret explained. \"The  is what allows the cleanup to be asynchronous.\"</p><p>\"Let's tackle a real-world problem,\" Margaret said. \"Imagine our library has an API that returns paginated results. You want to iterate over all books, but the API only gives you 10 at a time.\"</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><div><pre><code>Fetching all books via pagination:\n  Book 0\n  Book 1\n  Book 2\n  ...\n  Book 33\n  Book 34\n\nTotal books fetched: 35\n</code></pre></div><p>\"The consumer doesn't know about pagination,\" Margaret explained. \"They just use  and get all the books. The generator handles the complexity of fetching multiple pages.\"</p><p>Timothy grinned. \"That's way cleaner than managing page numbers in the calling code.\"</p><p>\"Right. This is a common pattern for REST APIs, database queries with cursors, or any paginated data source.\"</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Buffering and Prefetching\n</h2><p>\"One more advanced pattern,\" Margaret said. \"Sometimes you want to fetch data ahead of time to minimize waiting.\"</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>\"Buffering can significantly improve throughput when processing slow streams,\" Margaret explained. \"You're essentially pipelining the fetching and processing.\"</p><p>\"This demonstrates the buffering concept,\" Margaret added. \"In production, you might use libraries like  that provide pre-built buffering utilities. But understanding how to build it yourself helps you know what's happening under the hood.\"</p><p>As they wrapped up, Timothy asked, \"How do I test these things? My usual testing approaches don't work with async code.\"</p><p>\"Good question,\" Margaret said. \"Let me show you pytest with async support.\"</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>\"Install  and mark your tests with ,\" Margaret said. \"Then write tests like normal async functions.\"</p><p>Margaret summarized the patterns they'd covered on a whiteboard:</p><div><pre><code>Async Iterator Patterns:\n\n1. Async Comprehensions\n   [x async for x in source() if condition]\n   - Clean syntax for collecting results\n   - Loads everything into memory\n   - Use for finite datasets\n\n2. Direct Iteration\n   async for x in source():\n       await process(x)\n   - Constant memory usage\n   - Use for large streams\n   - Process one item at a time\n\n3. Context Manager + Iterator\n   async with resource() as r:\n       async for item in r:\n           await process(item)\n   - Guaranteed cleanup\n   - Common with databases, files, connections\n\n4. Pagination Pattern\n   async def paginated():\n       page = 0\n       while True:\n           batch = await fetch(page)\n           if not batch: break\n           for item in batch:\n               yield item\n           page += 1\n   - Hides pagination complexity\n   - Consumer sees flat stream\n\n5. Buffering/Prefetching\n   - Pre-fetch items to minimize waiting\n   - Improves throughput for slow sources\n   - More complex but can be worth it\n\n6. Error Handling\n   try:\n       async for item in source():\n           await process(item)\n   except Exception:\n       # Handle or retry\n   - Same as regular iteration\n   - Cleanup happens automatically\n</code></pre></div><p>Timothy closed his laptop, now equipped with practical patterns for real-world async iteration.</p><p><strong>Async comprehensions provide clean syntax</strong>: Just add  before  in list/set/dict comprehensions.</p><p><strong>Comprehensions load everything into memory</strong>: Use direct  for large streams instead.</p><p><strong>aiofiles provides real async file I/O</strong>: Python's built-in  blocks the event loop.</p><p><strong>async with + async for is a powerful combination</strong>: Context managers ensure cleanup, iterators stream data.</p><p><strong>Async context managers use  and </strong>: Both must be coroutines.</p><p><strong>Error handling works the same as regular iteration</strong>: Use try/except around  loops.</p><p><strong>Python calls aclose() automatically on errors</strong>: Generator cleanup happens even when iteration fails.</p><p><strong>finally blocks can contain await in async generators</strong>: Because the entire generator is a coroutine.</p><p><strong>Pagination pattern hides API complexity</strong>: Consumers see a flat stream, generator handles pages.</p><p><strong>Buffering can improve throughput</strong>: Pre-fetch items to minimize waiting between items.</p><p><strong>Libraries like aiostream provide pre-built patterns</strong>: But building your own helps you understand the mechanics.</p><p><strong>pytest-asyncio enables async test cases</strong>: Mark tests with .</p><p><strong>finally blocks ensure cleanup</strong>: Use them for releasing resources in generators.</p><p><strong>Choose the right pattern for your use case</strong>: Comprehensions for collecting, direct iteration for streaming, buffering for performance.</p><p>Margaret and Timothy had covered the essential patterns for production async iteration.

In this article, we'll optimize our Docker file for size and efficiency.</p><h2><strong>Optimizing Your Django Docker Images: The Power of Multi-Stage Builds</strong></h2><p>At SpokaneTech.org, we're always looking for ways to improve our development and deployment processes. A cornerstone of modern web application deployment is containerization, and for that, we rely on Docker. Docker allows us to package our Django application with all of its dependencies into a single, portable container.</p><p>However, as applications grow, so can the complexity and size of their Docker images. A bloated Docker image can lead to slower deployment times, increased storage costs, and a larger attack surface. Today, we'll explore how we optimized our Docker workflow for our Django project by transitioning from a single-stage to a multi-stage Dockerfile.</p><h2><strong>The Starting Point: A Single-Stage Dockerfile</strong></h2><p>When you first start Dockerizing a project, you'll likely begin with a single-stage Dockerfile. It's straightforward and gets the job done. Here’s what our initial Dockerfile looked like:</p><div><pre><code>FROM python:3.12-slim\n\n# Set environment variables\nENV PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=1\nENV PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1\n\n# Set the working directory\nWORKDIR /app\n\n# Install system dependencies\nRUN apt-get update &amp;&amp; apt-get install -y \\\n    libglib2.0-0 \\\n    libnss3 \\\n    libx11-xcb1 \\\n    libxcomposite1 \\\n    libxrandr2 \\\n    libxdamage1 \\\n    libgbm1 \\\n    libasound2 \\\n    libpangocairo-1.0-0 \\\n    netcat-openbsd \\\n    &amp;&amp; rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*\n\nCOPY pyproject.toml /app/\nCOPY src/django_project /app/\n\nRUN chmod +x /app/entrypoint.sh\nRUN pip install --upgrade pip pip-tools\nRUN pip install .[docker]\nRUN playwright install --with-deps\n\n# Expose the port that the app runs on\nEXPOSE 8000\n\nCMD [\"gunicorn\", \"core.wsgi:application\", \"--bind\", \"0.0.0.0:8000\", \"--workers\", \"3\"]\n\n</code></pre></div><p>This Dockerfile works, but it has some significant drawbacks. It installs all our Python dependencies, including development and testing libraries like pip-tools and playwright, directly into the final image. It also includes the system dependencies required to install Playwright's browsers, not just run them. The result is a larger-than-necessary image that contains tools we don't need in a production environment.</p><h2><strong>The Solution: Embracing Multi-Stage Builds</strong></h2><p>A multi-stage build is a powerful feature in Docker that allows you to use multiple FROM statements in a single Dockerfile. Each FROM instruction begins a new \"stage\" of the build. You can selectively copy artifacts—like compiled code or installed packages—from one stage to another, leaving behind everything you don't need.</p><p>Let's look at our new and improved multi-stage Dockerfile:</p><div><pre><code># ====================\n# Stage 1: Builder\n# ====================\nFROM python:3.12-slim AS builder\n\nWORKDIR /app\n\n# Install system dependencies needed for building and running Chromium\nRUN apt-get update &amp;&amp; apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends \\\n    libglib2.0-0 libnss3 libx11-xcb1 libxcomposite1 libxrandr2 \\\n    libxdamage1 libgbm1 libasound2 libpangocairo-1.0-0 \\\n    libatk-bridge2.0-0 libgtk-3-0 fonts-liberation libxshmfence1 \\\n    libxcb1 xdg-utils netcat-openbsd \\\n    &amp;&amp; apt-get clean &amp;&amp; rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*\n\n# Install uv (fast dependency resolver) and create virtualenv\nRUN pip install --no-cache-dir uv \\\n    &amp;&amp; python -m venv /venv\n\nENV PATH=\"/venv/bin:$PATH\"\n\n# Copy project dependency definition\nCOPY pyproject.toml /app/\n\n# Install Python dependencies (including Playwright and its deps)\nRUN uv pip install .[docker] --prerelease=allow \\\n    &amp;&amp; playwright install chromium --with-deps\n\n# ====================\n# Stage 2: Runtime\n# ====================\nFROM python:3.12-slim\n\nWORKDIR /app\n\n# Install only necessary system dependencies for Chromium to run\nRUN apt-get update &amp;&amp; apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends \\\n    libglib2.0-0 libnss3 libx11-xcb1 libxcomposite1 libxrandr2 \\\n    libxdamage1 libgbm1 libasound2 libpangocairo-1.0-0 \\\n    libatk-bridge2.0-0 libgtk-3-0 fonts-liberation libxshmfence1 \\\n    libxcb1 xdg-utils netcat-openbsd \\\n    &amp;&amp; apt-get clean &amp;&amp; rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*\n\n# Environment settings\nENV PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=1\nENV PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1\nENV PATH=\"/venv/bin:$PATH\"\nENV PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH=/root/.cache/ms-playwright\n\n# Copy the virtual environment and browser binaries from the builder\nCOPY --from=builder /venv /venv\nCOPY --from=builder /root/.cache/ms-playwright /root/.cache/ms-playwright\n\n# Copy Django app code\nCOPY src/django_project /app/\n\n# Make sure entrypoint script is executable\nRUN chmod +x /app/entrypoint.sh\n\n# Expose app port\nEXPOSE 8000\n\n# Entrypoint handles DB wait, migrations, and server start\nCMD [\"./entrypoint.sh\"]\n\n</code></pre></div><p>This Dockerfile is split into two distinct stages:</p><ol><li><p>The builder Stage: This first stage is where the heavy lifting happens. We install all the necessary build tools and system libraries. We use the speedy uv installer to create a virtual environment and install all our Python dependencies. We also download and set up the Playwright browser binaries. This stage is a complete development and build environment.</p></li><li><p>The runtime Stage: This is the stage that will become our final production image. It starts from a fresh, clean python:3.12-slim image. Notice what we copy from the builder stage using the --from=builder flag:</p></li></ol><div><pre><code>- The entire Python virtual environment (/venv).\n\n- The installed Playwright browser (/root/.cache/ms-playwright).\n</code></pre></div><p>We then copy in our application code. The final image contains only our Python environment, browser binaries, our code, and the minimal system dependencies needed to run them—nothing else.</p><h2><strong>The Key Benefits of Going Multi-Stage</strong></h2><p>So, what have we gained from this approach?</p><ul><li><p>Dramatically Smaller Image Sizes: By excluding build tools, -dev packages, and other intermediate files, the final image is significantly smaller. This means faster push/pull times from our container registry, quicker deployments, and reduced storage costs.</p></li><li><p>Enhanced Security: A smaller image has a smaller attack surface. By not shipping our build tools, compilers, or development dependencies, we remove potential vulnerabilities that could be exploited in a production environment.</p></li><li><p>Improved Caching and Faster Builds: Docker is smart about caching layers. In our multi-stage setup, if we only change our application code (src/django_project), Docker can use the cached builder stage without re-installing all the dependencies, speeding up subsequent builds.</p></li><li><p>Cleaner and More Maintainable Dockerfiles: Separating the build and runtime concerns makes the Dockerfile more organized and easier to understand. It clearly communicates what is needed to build the application versus what is needed to run it.</p></li></ul><p>While a single-stage Dockerfile is a great way to get started, adopting a multi-stage build process is a crucial step toward creating professional, production-ready container images. For SpokaneTech.org, this switch has resulted in a more efficient, secure, and streamlined deployment pipeline for our Django application. If you're not already using multi-stage builds, we highly recommend giving them a try!</p>","contentLength":7142,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Title: The Enigma of Life: Astrobiologists' Quest to Define the Unknown","url":"https://dev.to/yagyaraj_sharma_6cd410179/title-the-enigma-of-life-astrobiologists-quest-to-define-the-unknown-ngk","date":1761956741,"author":"Insights YRS","guid":323827,"unread":true,"content":"<h2>\n  \n  \n  Title: The Enigma of Life: Astrobiologists' Quest to Define the Unknown\n</h2><p>In the vast expanse of the cosmos, a question has long puzzled the minds of scientists and laypeople alike: what exactly is \"life\"?

Strange attractors - fancy math that creates beautiful patterns. At first I thought I'd just render one and move on, but then soon I realized that this is too much fun. When complexity emerges from three simple equations, when you see something chaotic emerge into beautiful, it's hard not to waste some time. I've spent countless hours, maybe more than I'd care to admit, watching these patterns form. I realized there's something deeply satisfying about seeing order emerge from randomness. Let me show you what kept me hooked.</p><h2><a aria-hidden=\"true\" tabindex=\"-1\" href=\"https://blog.shashanktomar.com/posts/strange-attractors#the-basics-dynamical-systems-and-chaos-theory\"></a>The Basics: Dynamical Systems and Chaos Theory</h2><p>Dynamical Systems are a mathematical way to understand how things . Imagine you have a system, which\ncould be anything from the movement of planets to the growth of a population. In this system, there are rules that\ndetermine how it evolves from one moment to the next. These rules tell you what will happen next based on what is\nhappening now. Some examples are, a pendulum, the weather patterns, a flock of birds, the spread of a virus in a\npopulation (we are all too familiar with this one), and stock market.</p><p>There are two primary things to understand about this system:</p><ul><li>: This is like a big collection of all the possible states the system can be in. Each state is like a\nsnapshot of the system at a specific time. This is also called the  or the .</li><li>: These are the rules that takes one state of the system and moves it to the next state. It can be\nrepresented as a function that transforms the system from now to later.</li></ul><p>For instance, when studying population growth, a phase-space (world-state) might consist of the current population size\nand the rate of growth or decline at a specific time. The dynamics would then be derived from models of population\ndynamics, which, considering factors like birth rates, death rates, and carrying capacity of the environment, dictate\nthe changes in population size over time.</p><p>Another way of saying this is that the dynamical systems describe how things change over time, in a space of\npossibilities, governed by a set of rules. Numerous fields such as biology, physics, economics, and applied mathematics,\nstudy systems like these, focusing on the specific rules that dictate their evolution. These rules are grounded in\nrelevant theories, such as Newtonian mechanics, fluid dynamics, and mathematics of economics, among others.</p><p>There are different ways of classifying dynamical systems, and one of the most interesting is the classification into\nchaotic and non-chaotic systems. The change over time in non-chaotic systems is more deterministic as compared to\nchaotic systems which exhibit randomness and unpredictability.</p><p> is the sub branch of dynamical systems that studies chaotic systems and challenges the traditional\ndeterministic views of causality. Most of the natural systems we observe are chaotic in nature, like the weather, a drop\nof ink dissolving in water, social and economic behaviours etc. In contrast, systems like the movement of planets,\npendulums, and simple harmonic oscillators are extremely predictable and non-chaotic.</p><p>Chaos Theory deals with systems that exhibit irregular and unpredictable behavior over time, even though they follow\ndeterministic rules. Having a set of rules that govern the system, and yet exhibit randomness and unpredictability,\nmight seem a bit contradictory, but it is because the rules do not always represent the whole system. In fact, most of\nthe time, these rules are an approximation of the system and that is what leads to the unpredictability. In complex\nsystems, we do not have enough information to come up with a perfect set of rules. And by using incomplete information\nto make predictions, we introduce uncertainty, which amplifies over time, leading to the chaotic behaviour.</p><p>Chaotic systems generally have many non-linear interacting components, which we partially understand (or can partially\nobserve) and which are very sensitive to small changes. A small change in the initial conditions can lead to a\ncompletely different outcome, a phenomenon known as the . In this post, we will try to see the\nbutterfly effect in action but before that, let's talk about .</p><p>To understand Strange Attractors, let's first understand what an attractor is. As discussed earlier, dynamical systems\nare all about . During this change, the system moves through different possible states (remember the\nphase space jargon?). An attractor is a set of states towards which a system tends to settle over time, or you can say,\ntowards which it is . It's like a magnet that pulls the system towards it.</p><p>For example, think of a pendulum. When you release it, it swings back and forth, but eventually, it comes to rest at the\nbottom. The bottom is the attractor in this case. It's the state towards which the pendulum is attracted.</p><p>This happens due to the system's inherent dynamics, which govern how states in the phase space change. Here are some of\nthe reasons why different states get attracted towards attractors:</p><ul><li>: Attractors are stable states of the system, meaning that once the system reaches them, it tends to stay\nthere. This stability arises from the system's dynamics, which push it towards the attractor and keep it there.</li><li>: Many dynamical systems have dissipative forces, which cause the system to lose energy over time. This\nloss of energy leads the system to settle into a lower-energy state, which often corresponds to an attractor. This is\nwhat happens in the case of the pendulum.</li><li>: In some regions of the phase space, the system's dynamics cause trajectories to converge. This\ncontraction effect means that nearby states will tend to come closer together over time, eventually being drawn\ntowards the attractor.</li></ul><p>Some attractors have complex governing equations that can create unpredictable trajectories or behaviours. These\nnonlinear interactions can result in multiple stable states or periodic orbits, towards which the system evolves. These\ncomplex attractors are categorised as . They are called \"strange\" due to their unique\ncharacteristics.</p><ol><li>: Strange attractors often have a fractal-like structure, meaning they display intricate\npatterns that repeat at different scales. This complexity sets them apart from simpler, regular attractors.</li><li><strong>Sensitive Dependence on Initial Conditions</strong>: Systems with strange attractors are highly sensitive to their initial\nconditions. Small changes in the starting point can lead to vastly different long-term behaviors, a phenomenon known\nas the \"butterfly effect\".</li><li><strong>Unpredictable Trajectories</strong>: The trajectories on a strange attractor never repeat themselves, exhibiting\nnon-periodic motion. The system's behavior appears random and unpredictable, even though it is governed by\ndeterministic rules.</li><li><strong>Emergent Order from Chaos</strong>: Despite their chaotic nature, strange attractors exhibit a form of underlying order.\nPatterns and structures emerge from the seemingly random behavior, revealing the complex dynamics at play.</li></ol><p>You can observe most of these characteristics in the visualisation. The one which is most fascinating to observe is the\nbutterfly effect.</p><blockquote><p>A butterfly can flutter its wings over a flower in China and cause a hurricane in the Caribbean.</p></blockquote><p>One of the defining features of strange attractors is their sensitivity to initial conditions. This means that small\nchanges in the starting state of the system can lead to vastly different long-term behaviors, a phenomenon known as the\n. In chaotic systems, tiny variations in the initial conditions can amplify over time, leading to\ndrastically different outcomes.</p><p>In our visualisation, let's observe this behavior on Thomas Attractor. It is governed by the following equations:</p><p>A small change in the parameter  can lead to vastly different particle trajectories and the overall shape of the\nattractor. Change this value in the control panel and observe the butterfly effect in action.</p><p>There is another way of observing the butterfly effect in this visualisation. Change the  from  to\n in the control panel and observe how the particles move differently in the two cases. The particles\neventually get attracted to the same states but have different trajectories.</p><p>This visualization required rendering a large number of particles using Three.js. To achieve this efficiently, we used a\ntechnique called . This method handles iterative updates of particle systems directly on the GPU,\nminimizing data transfers between the CPU and GPU. It utilizes two frame buffer objects (FBOs) that alternate roles: One\nstores the current state of particles and render them on the screen, while the other calculates the next state.</p><ol><li><p><strong>Setting Up Frame Buffer Objects (FBOs):</strong> We start by creating two FBOs,  and , to hold the current and\nnext state of particles. These buffers store data such as particle positions in RGBA channels, making efficient use\nof GPU resources.</p></li><li><p><strong>Shader Programs for Particle Dynamics:</strong> The shader programs execute on the GPU and apply attractor dynamics to\neach particle. Following is the attractor function which update the particle positions based on the attractor equation.</p></li><li><p><strong>Rendering and Buffer Swapping:</strong> In each frame, the shader computes the new positions based on the attractor's\nequations and stores them in the inactive buffer. After updating, the roles of the FBOs are swapped: The previously\ninactive buffer becomes active, and vice versa.</p></li></ol><p>This combination of efficient shader calculations and the ping-pong technique allows us to render the particle system.</p><p>If you have any comments, please leave them on <strong><a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" href=\"https://github.com/shashanktomar/blog-discussion/discussions/1\">this GitHub discussions topic</a></strong>.

Or struggled to diagnose a medical image riddled with artifacts? We've all faced situations where imperfect, noisy data limits our ability to extract crucial insights. Now, imagine a technique that doesn't just tolerate noise, but leverages it to create remarkably clear, high-resolution images.</p><p>The core idea is to guide the image enhancement process using conditional flow matching. Instead of blindly extrapolating details, the model learns a mapping between noisy, low-resolution images and their ideal high-resolution counterparts. This mapping allows us to essentially \"clean up\" the image while simultaneously increasing its resolution. Think of it like a GPS guiding you through a fog – even with limited visibility, the system knows the optimal route.</p><p>Here's why this approach is a game-changer:</p><ul><li><strong>Unprecedented Noise Resilience:</strong> Works even with significantly degraded images.</li><li><strong>Enhanced Detail Recovery:</strong> Reveals details previously obscured by noise.</li><li> Minimizes the introduction of artificial artifacts.</li><li> Provides a measure of confidence in each pixel, allowing you to identify potentially unreliable areas.</li><li> Applicable to a wide range of imaging domains.</li><li><strong>Sampling from a Posterior:</strong> Enables the creation of multiple plausible high-resolution images, reflecting the inherent uncertainty.</li></ul><p>One implementation challenge involves balancing the data prior with the image information, as overly strong prior could introduce unrealistic artifacts. Using a tunable parameter to control the strength of the prior can help achieve this balance.</p><p>The implications are profound. Imagine enhancing satellite imagery to monitor deforestation with unprecedented accuracy or improving the diagnostic capabilities of medical imaging in resource-constrained environments. As we refine this technique, we pave the way for a future where image clarity is no longer a barrier to knowledge and discovery.</p><p>Related Keywords: Image Enhancement, Image Restoration, Deep Learning, Generative AI, Noise Resilience, Conditional Flow Matching, Diffusion Models, Super Resolution Algorithms, Low-Resolution Images, Image Processing, AI Art Generation, Data Augmentation, Model Training, AI Ethics, Computer Graphics, Pattern Recognition, Medical Imaging, Satellite Imaging, Security Cameras, Video Enhancement, Generative Adversarial Networks, Image Quality Assessment, Robustness, Generalization</p>","contentLength":2443,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Circular dependency check in Python","url":"https://dev.to/slyang08/circular-dependency-check-in-python-58p2","date":1761951290,"author":"Sheng-Lin Yang","guid":323775,"unread":true,"content":"<p>This is my last issue in Hacktoberfest.\nI have challenged myself three times, and this one is the biggest one to me.</p><p>This project implements many features and functions.

Financial institutions verify AI-generated investment advice meets regulatory requirements with mathematical certainty.

Understanding these core components will provide the foundation for implementing effective verification systems for your generative AI applications.</p><p>The Amazon Bedrock Automated Reasoning checks console organizes policy development into logical sections, guiding you through the creation, refinement, and testing process. The interface includes clear rule identification with unique IDs and direct use of variable names within the rules, making complex policy structures understandable and manageable.</p><h3>Document processing capacity</h3><p>Document processing supports up to 120K tokens (approximately 100 pages), so you can encode substantial knowledge bases and complex policy documents into your Automated Reasoning policies. Organizations can incorporate comprehensive policy manuals, detailed procedural documentation, and extensive regulatory guidelines. With this capacity you can work with complete documents within a single policy.</p><p>The validation API includes ambiguity detection that identifies statements requiring clarification, counterexamples for invalid findings that demonstrate why validation failed, and satisfiable findings with both valid and invalid examples to help understand boundary conditions. These features provide context around validation results, to help you understand why specific responses were flagged and how they can be improved. The system can also express its confidence in translations between natural language and logical structures to set appropriate thresholds for specific use cases.</p><h3>Iterative feedback and refinement process</h3><p>Automated Reasoning checks provide detailed, auditable findings that explain why a response failed validation, to support an iterative refinement process instead of simply blocking non-compliant content. This information can be fed back to your foundation model, allowing it to adjust responses based on specific feedback until they comply with policy rules. This approach is particularly valuable in regulated industries where factual accuracy and compliance must be mathematically verified rather than estimated.</p><h3>Finding types using a policy example</h3><p>Consider the example of a policy for determining days off. When implementing Automated Reasoning checks, a policy consists of both a schema of variables (defining concepts like employee type, years of service, and available leave days) and a set of logical rules that establish relationships between these variables (such as eligibility conditions for different types of time off). During validation, the system uses this schema and rule structure to evaluate whether foundation model responses comply with your defined policy constraints.</p><p>We want to validate the following input that a user asked the foundation model (FM) powered application and the generated output.</p><div><pre><code>Input:\n\"Is Thursday a day off if it's a public holiday?\"\n\nOutput:\n\"Yes, Thursday would be a day off if it's a public holiday, since all public holidays are considered days off regardless of the day of the week.\"</code></pre></div><p>Premises are statements from which a conclusion is drawn and the claim is an assertion of the truth. In this example, the premises inferred are  is equal to “Thursday” and  is true, and the claim is made that  is true.</p><p>This reasoning follows the automated reasoning policy:</p><div><pre><code>Days Off Policy:\n-&nbsp;All weekend days (Saturday and Sunday) are days off\n-&nbsp;All public holidays are days off\n- A day is considered a day off if it is either a weekend day or a public holiday\n</code></pre></div><p>With general availability, Automated Reasoning checks now produces seven distinct finding types that offer precise insights into the validation process of a FM generated response:</p><p>: Confirms &nbsp;and&nbsp;&nbsp;fully aligns with policy rules, providing confidence that the information in the generated response is correct according to your defined policies. The claims are inferred from the premises and validated by the AR policy to be true, and there are no alternative answers that contradict these claims.</p><div><pre><code>Input:\nToday is Sunday, do I have the day off? \n\nOutput:\nYes, Sunday is a weekend day, you have the day off.\n\nPremises:\nday: Sunday\nis_weekend: true\n\nClaim:\nis_day_off: true\n\nExplanation:\nGiven the assigned variables and policy rules that weekends are days off, the only possible answer is that it is a day off.</code></pre></div><p>: Recognizes that &nbsp;and  could be true or false depending on specific assumptions. These findings help you understand boundary conditions where a response is valid only under certain conditions, so that you can decide whether those assumptions are reasonable in your context. If the required assumptions are false, then an alternative claim consistent with the premises may exist.</p><div><pre><code>Input:\nToday is Tuesday, do I have the day off?\n\nOutput:\nYes\nPremises:\nday: Tuesday\n\nClaim:\nis_day_off: true\n\nExplanation: \nIf we assume is_public_holiday=true, this is correct, but if we assume is_public_holiday=false, the answer would be incorrect since Tuesday is not a weekend.</code></pre></div><p>: Identifies  and  have policy inaccuracies or factual errors, enhanced with counter-examples that explicitly demonstrate why the validation failed. The claims are not implied by the premises and AR policy, and there exist different claims that would be consistent with the premises and AR policy.</p><div><pre><code>Input:\nToday is Sunday, do I have the day off?\n\nOutput:\nNo you do&nbsp;not have the day off.\n\nPremises:\nday: Sunday\n\nClaim:\nis_day_off: false\n\nExplanation:\nThis is invalid because the policy states weekends are days off. The correct claim would be is_day_off = true since Sunday is a weekend day</code></pre></div><p>: Indicates when no valid&nbsp;&nbsp;can be generated because the premises conflict with the AR policy or the policy contains internal contradictions. This finding occurs when the constraints defined in the policy create a logical impossibility.</p><div><pre><code>Input: \nToday is Sunday and not a weekend day, do I have the day off?\n\nOutput:\nYes\n\nPremises:\nday: Sunday\nis_weekend: false\n\nClaim:\nis_day_off: true\n\nExplanation: \nSunday is always a weekend day, so the premises contain a contradiction. No valid claim can exist given these contradictory premises.</code></pre></div><p>: Occurs when the and  contains no information that can be translated into relevant data for the AR policy evaluation. This typically happens when the text is entirely unrelated to the policy domain or contains no actionable information.</p><div><pre><code>Input: \nHow many legs does the average cat have?\n\nOutput:\nLess than 4\n\nExplanation:\nThe AR policy is about days off, so there is no relevant translation for content about cats. The input has no connection to the policy domain.</code></pre></div><p>: Identifies when ambiguity in the and  prevents definitive translation into logical structures. This finding suggests that additional context or follow-up questions may be needed to proceed with validation.</p><div><pre><code>Input: \nI won! Today is Winsday, do I get the day off?\n\nOutput:\nYes, you get the day off!\n\nExplanation: \n\"Winsday\" is not a recognized day in the AR policy, creating ambiguity. Automated reasoning cannot proceed without clarification of what day is being referenced.</code></pre></div><p>: Signals that the and  contains too much information to process within latency limits. This finding occurs with extremely large or complex inputs that exceed the system’s current processing capabilities.</p><div><pre><code>Input:\nCan you tell me which days are off for all 50 states plus territories for the next 3 years, accounting for federal, state, and local holidays? Include exceptions for floating holidays and special observances.\n\nOutput:\nI have analyzed the holiday calendars for all 50 states. In Alabama, days off include...\n\nExplanation: \nThis use case contains too many variables and conditions for AR checks to process while maintaining accuracy and response time requirements.</code></pre></div><p>You can now generate scenarios directly from your policy, which creates test samples that conform to your policy rules, helps identify edge cases, and supports verification of your policy’s business logic implementation. With this capability policy authors can see concrete examples of how their rules work in practice before deployment, reducing the need for extensive manual testing. The scenario generation also highlights potential conflicts or gaps in policy coverage that might not be apparent from examining individual rules.</p><p>A new test management system allows you to save and annotate policy tests, build test libraries for consistent validation, execute tests automatically to verify policy changes, and maintain quality assurance across policy versions. This system includes versioning capabilities that track test results across policy iterations, making it easier to identify when changes might have unintended consequences. You can now also export test results for integration into existing quality assurance workflows and documentation processes.</p><h3>Expanded options with direct guardrail integration</h3><p>Automated Reasoning checks now integrates with Amazon Bedrock APIs, enabling validation of AI generated responses against established policies throughout complex interactions. This integration extends to both the  and  actions, allowing policy enforcement across different interaction modalities. Organizations can configure validation confidence thresholds appropriate to their domain requirements, with options for stricter enforcement in regulated industries or more flexible application in exploratory contexts.</p><h2>Solution – AI-powered hospital readmission risk assessment system</h2><p>Now that we have explained the capabilities of Automated Reasoning checks, let’s work through a solution by considering the use case of an AI-powered hospital readmission risk assessment system. This AI system automates hospital readmission risk assessment by analyzing patient data from electronic health records to classify patients into risk categories (Low, Intermediate, High) and recommends personalized intervention plans based on CDC-style guidelines. The objective of this AI system is to reduce the 30-day hospital readmission rates by supporting early identification of high-risk patients and implementing targeted interventions. This application is an ideal candidate for Automated Reasoning checks because the healthcare provider prioritizes verifiable accuracy and explainable recommendations that can be mathematically proven to comply with medical guidelines, supporting both clinical decision-making and satisfying the strict auditability requirements common in healthcare settings.</p><p> The referenced policy document is an example created for demonstration purposes only and should not be used as an actual medical guideline or for clinical decision-making.</p><p>To use Automated Reasoning checks in Amazon Bedrock, verify you have met the following prerequisites:</p><ul><li>Confirmation of AWS Regions where Automated Reasoning checks is <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/guardrails-automated-reasoning-checks.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">available</a></li><li>Appropriate IAM permissions to create, test, and invoke Automated Reasoning policies (Note: The IAM policy should be fine-grained and limited to necessary resources using proper ARN patterns for production usage):</li></ul><div><pre><code> {  \n  \"Sid\": \"OperateAutomatedReasoningChecks\",  \n  \"Effect\": \"Allow\",  \n  \"Action\": [  \n    \"bedrock:CancelAutomatedReasoningPolicyBuildWorkflow\",  \n    \"bedrock:CreateAutomatedReasoningPolicy\",\n    \"bedrock:CreateAutomatedReasoningPolicyTestCase\",  \n    \"bedrock:CreateAutomatedReasoningPolicyVersion\",\n    \"bedrock:CreateGuardrail\",\n    \"bedrock:DeleteAutomatedReasoningPolicy\",  \n    \"bedrock:DeleteAutomatedReasoningPolicyBuildWorkflow\",  \n    \"bedrock:DeleteAutomatedReasoningPolicyTestCase\",\n    \"bedrock:ExportAutomatedReasoningPolicyVersion\",  \n    \"bedrock:GetAutomatedReasoningPolicy\",  \n    \"bedrock:GetAutomatedReasoningPolicyAnnotations\",  \n    \"bedrock:GetAutomatedReasoningPolicyBuildWorkflow\",  \n    \"bedrock:GetAutomatedReasoningPolicyBuildWorkflowResultAssets\",  \n    \"bedrock:GetAutomatedReasoningPolicyNextScenario\",  \n    \"bedrock:GetAutomatedReasoningPolicyTestCase\",  \n    \"bedrock:GetAutomatedReasoningPolicyTestResult\",\n    \"bedrock:InvokeAutomatedReasoningPolicy\",  \n    \"bedrock:ListAutomatedReasoningPolicies\",  \n    \"bedrock:ListAutomatedReasoningPolicyBuildWorkflows\",  \n    \"bedrock:ListAutomatedReasoningPolicyTestCases\",  \n    \"bedrock:ListAutomatedReasoningPolicyTestResults\",\n    \"bedrock:StartAutomatedReasoningPolicyBuildWorkflow\",  \n    \"bedrock:StartAutomatedReasoningPolicyTestWorkflow\",\n    \"bedrock:UpdateAutomatedReasoningPolicy\",  \n    \"bedrock:UpdateAutomatedReasoningPolicyAnnotations\",  \n    \"bedrock:UpdateAutomatedReasoningPolicyTestCase\",\n    \"bedrock:UpdateGuardrail\"\n  ],  \n  \"Resource\": [\n  \"arn:aws:bedrock:\\${aws:region}:\\${aws:accountId}:automated-reasoning-policy/*\",\n  \"arn:aws:bedrock:\\${aws:region}:\\${aws:accountId}:guardrail/*\"\n]\n}</code></pre></div><ul><li>: Be aware of the <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/bedrock.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">service limits</a> when implementing Automated Reasoning checks.</li><li>With Automated Reasoning checks, you pay based on the amount of text processed.

Moreover, refining the policy that is created by Automated Reasoning is key in achieving a soundness of over 99%.</p><p>Let’s review the main details of the sample medical policy that we are using in this post. As we start validating responses, it is helpful to verify it against the source document.</p><ul><li><strong>Risk assessment and stratification:</strong>&nbsp;Healthcare facilities must implement a standardized risk scoring system based on demographic, clinical, utilization, laboratory, and social factors, with patients classified into Low (0-3 points), Intermediate (4-7 points), or High Risk (8+ points) categories.</li><li>&nbsp;Each risk level requires specific interventions, with higher risk levels incorporating lower-level interventions plus additional measures, while certain conditions trigger automatic High Risk classification regardless of score.</li><li><strong>Quality metrics and compliance:</strong>&nbsp;Facilities must achieve specific completion rates including 95%+ risk assessment within 24 hours of admission and 100% completion before discharge, with High Risk patients requiring documented discharge plans.</li><li>&nbsp;While the scoring system is standardized, attending physicians maintain override authority with proper documentation and approval from the discharge planning coordinator.</li></ul><h2>Create and test an Automated Reasoning checks’ policy&nbsp;using the Amazon Bedrock console</h2><p>The first step is to encode your knowledge—in this case, the sample medical policy—into an Automated Reasoning policy. Complete the following steps to create an Automated Reasoning policy:</p><p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/f1f836cb4ea6efb2a0b1b99f41ad8b103eff4b59/2025/10/30/19626-14.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2560\" height=\"407\"> You may see differences in the number of rules, variables, and types generated compared to what is shown in this example. This is due to the non-deterministic processing of the supplied document. To address this, the recommended guidance is to perform a human-in-the-loop review of the generated information in the policy before using it with other systems.</p><h3>Exploring the Automated Reasoning checks’ definition</h3><p>A  in automated reasoning for policy documents is a named container that holds a specific type of information (like Integer, Real Number, or Boolean) and represents a distinct concept or measurement from the policy. Variables act as building blocks for rules and can be used to track, measure, and evaluate policy requirements. From the image below, we can see examples like &nbsp;(an Integer variable tracking previous hospital admissions), &nbsp;(an Integer variable storing age-based risk scores), and <code>conductingMonthlyHighRiskReview</code> (a Boolean variable indicating whether monthly reviews are being performed). Each variable has a clear description of its purpose and the specific policy concept it represents, making it possible to use these variables within rules to enforce policy requirements and measure compliance. Issues also highlight that some variables are unused. It is particularly important to verify which concepts these variables represent and to identify if rules are missing.</p><p>In the , we see ‘Rules’, ‘Variables’ and ‘Types’. A  is an unambiguous logical statement that Automated Reasoning extracts from your source document. Consider this simple rule that has been created:&nbsp;<code>followupAppointmentsScheduledRate is at least 90.0</code>&nbsp; – This rule has been created from the <a href=\"https://github.com/aws-samples/amazon-bedrock-samples/blob/main/responsible_ai/bedrock-automated-reasoning-checks/uploads/sample_medical_policy.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Section III A Process Measures</a>, which states that healthcare facilities should monitor various process indications, requiring that follow up appointments scheduled prior to discharge should be 90% or higher.</p><p>Let’s look at a more complex rule:</p><div><pre><code>comorbidityRiskPoints is equal to(ite&nbsp;hasDiabetesMellitus&nbsp;1 0) + (ite hasHeartFailure 2 0) + (ite&nbsp;hasCOPD&nbsp;1 0) + (ite hasChronicKidneyDisease 1 0)</code></pre></div><div><pre><code>Where “ite” is “If then else”</code></pre></div><p>This rule calculates a patient’s risk points based on their existing medical conditions (comorbidities) as specified in the policy document. When evaluating a patient, the system checks for four specific conditions: diabetes mellitus of any type (worth 1 point), heart failure of any classification (worth 2 points), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (worth 1 point), and chronic kidney disease stages 3-5 (worth 1 point). The rule adds these points together by using boolean logic – meaning it multiplies each condition (represented as true=1 or false=0) by its assigned point value, then sums all values to generate a total comorbidity risk score. For instance, if a patient has both heart failure and diabetes, they would receive 3 total points (2 points for heart failure plus 1 point for diabetes). This comorbidity score then becomes part of the larger risk assessment framework used to determine the patient’s overall readmission risk category.</p><p>The Definitions also include custom variable types.&nbsp;, also known as enumerations (ENUMs), are specialized data structures that define a fixed set of allowable values for specific policy concepts.&nbsp;These custom types maintain consistency and accuracy in data collection and rule enforcement by limiting values to predefined options that align with the policy requirements. In the sample policy, we can see that four custom variable types have been identified:</p><ul><li>: This defines the possible types of hospital admissions (MEDICAL, SURGICAL, MIXED_MEDICAL_SURGICAL, PSYCHIATRIC) that determine whether a patient is eligible for the readmission risk assessment protocol.</li><li>: This specifies the types of healthcare facilities (ACUTE_CARE_HOSPITAL_25PLUS, CRITICAL_ACCESS_HOSPITAL) where the readmission risk assessment protocol may be implemented.</li><li>: This categorizes a patient’s living arrangement (LIVES_ALONE_NO_CAREGIVER, LIVES_ALONE_WITH_CAREGIVER) which is a critical factor in determining social support and risk levels.</li><li>: This defines the three possible risk stratification levels (LOW_RISK, INTERMEDIATE_RISK, HIGH_RISK) that can be assigned to a patient based on their total risk score.</li></ul><p>An important step in improving soundness (accuracy of Automated Reasoning checks when it says VALID), is the policy refinement step of making sure that the rules, variable, and types that are captured best represent the source of truth. In order to do this, we will head over to the test suite and explore how to add tests, generate tests and use the results from the tests to apply annotations that will update the rules.</p><h2>Testing the Automated Reasoning policy and policy refinement</h2><p>The test suite in Automated Reasoning provides test capabilities for two purposes: First, we want to run different scenarios and test the various rules and variables in the Automated Reasoning policy and refine them so that they accurately represent the ground truth. This policy refinement step is important to improving the soundness of Automated Reasoning checks. Second, we want metrics to understand how well the Automated Reasoning checks performs for the defined policy and the use case. To do so, we can open the  tab on Automated Reasoning console.</p><p>Test samples can be added manually by using the  button. To scale up the testing, we can generate tests from the policy rules. This testing approach helps verify both the semantic correctness of your policy (making sure rules accurately represent intended policy constraints) and the natural language translation capabilities (confirming the system can correctly interpret the language your users will use when interacting with your application). In the image below, we can see a test sample generated and before adding it to the test suite, the SME should indicate if this test sample is possible (thumbs up) or not possible (thumbs up). The test sample can then be saved to the test suite.</p><p>Once the test sample is created, it possible to run this test sample alone, or all the test samples in the test suite by choosing on . Upon executing, we see that this test passed successfully.</p><p>You can manually create tests by providing an input (optional) and output. These are translated into logical representations before validation occurs.</p><p>Translation converts your natural language tests into logical representations that can be mathematically verified against your policy rules:</p><ul><li>Automated Reasoning Checks uses multiple LLMs to translate your input/output into logical findings</li><li>Each translation receives a confidence vote indicating translation quality</li><li>You can set a confidence threshold to control which findings are validated and returned</li></ul><p><strong>Confidence threshold behavior:</strong></p><p>The confidence threshold controls which translations are considered reliable enough for validation, balancing strictness with coverage:</p><ul><li>: Greater certainty in translation accuracy but also higher chance of no findings being validated.</li><li>: &nbsp;Greater chance of getting validated findings returned, but potentially less certain translations</li><li>: All findings are validated and returned regardless of confidence</li></ul><p>When no finding meets your confidence threshold, Automated Reasoning Checks returns “Translation Ambiguous,” indicating uncertainty in the content’s logical interpretation.The test case we will create and validate is:</p><div><pre><code>Input:\nPatient A\nAge: 82\nLength of stay: 16 days\nDiabetes Mellitus: Yes\nHeart Failure: Yes\nChronic Kidney Disease: Yes\nHemoglobin: 9.2 g/dL\neGFR: 28 ml/min/1.73m^2\nSodium: 146 mEq/L\nLiving Situation: Lives alone without caregiver\nHas established PCP: No\nInsurance Status: Medicaid\nAdmissions within 30 days: 1\n\nOutput:\nFinal&nbsp;Classification:&nbsp;INTERMEDIATE RISK</code></pre></div><p>We see that this test passed upon running it, the result of ‘INVALID’ matches our expected results. Additionally Automated Reasoning checks also shows that 12 rules were contradicting the premises and claims, which lead to the output of the test sample being ‘INVALID’</p><p>Let’s examine some of the visible contradicting rules:</p><ul><li>: Patient is 82 years old \n  <ul><li>Rule triggers: “if patientAge is at least 80, then ageRiskPoints is equal to 3”</li></ul></li><li>: Patient stayed 16 days \n  <ul><li>Rule triggers: “if lengthOfStay is greater than 14, then lengthOfStayRiskPoints is equal to 3”</li></ul></li><li>: Patient has multiple conditions \n  <ul><li>Rule calculates: “comorbidityRiskPoints = (hasDiabetesMellitus × 1) + (hasHeartFailure × 2) + (hasCOPD × 1) + (hasChronicKidneyDisease × 1)”</li></ul></li><li>: Patient has 1 admission within 30 days \n  <ul><li>Rule triggers: “if admissionsWithin30Days is at least 1, then utilizationRiskPoints is at least 3”</li></ul></li><li>: Patient’s eGFR is 28 \n  <ul><li>Rule triggers: “if eGFR is less than 30.0, then laboratoryRiskPoints is at least 2”</li></ul></li></ul><p>These rules are likely producing conflicting risk scores, making it impossible for the system to determine a valid final risk category. These contradictions show us which rules where used to determine that the input text of the test is INVALID.</p><p>Let’s add another test to the test suite, as shown in the screenshot below:</p><div><pre><code>Input:\nPatient&nbsp;profile\nAge: 83\nLength of stay: 16 days\nDiabetes Mellitus: Yes\nHeart Failure: Yes\nChronic Kidney Disease: Yes\nHemoglobin: 9.2 g/dL\neGFR: 28 ml/min/1.73m^2\nSodium: 146 mEq/L\nLiving Situation: Lives alone without caregiver\nHas established PCP: No\nInsurance Status: Medicaid\nAdmissions within 30 days: 1\nAdmissions within 90 days:&nbsp;2\n\nOutput:\nFinal&nbsp;Classification:&nbsp;HIGH RISK</code></pre></div><p>When this test is executed, we see that each of the patient details are extracted as premises, to validate the claim that the risk of readmission if high. We see that 8 rules have been applied to verify this claim. The key rules and their validations include:</p><ul><li>: Validates that patient age ≥ 80 contributes 3 risk points</li><li>: Confirms that stay &gt;14 days adds 3 risk points</li><li> Calculated based on presence of&nbsp;Diabetes Mellitus, Heart Failure, Chronic Kidney Disease</li><li> Evaluates admissions history</li><li> Evaluates risk based on&nbsp;Hemoglobin level of 9.2 and eGFR of 28</li></ul><p>Each premise was evaluated as true, with multiple risk factors present (advanced age, extended stay, multiple comorbidities, concerning lab values, living alone without caregiver, and lack of PCP), supporting the overall  classification of this HIGH RISK assessment.</p><p>Moreover, the Automated Reasoning engine performed an extensive validation of this test sample using 93 different assignments to increase the soundness that the HIGH RISK classification is correct.&nbsp;Various related rules from the Automated Reasoning policy are used to validate the samples against 93 different scenarios and variable combinations. In this manner, Automated Reasoning checks confirms that there is no possible situation under which this patient’s HIGH RISK classification could be invalid. This thorough verification process affirms the reliability of the risk assessment for this elderly patient with multiple chronic conditions and complex care needs.In the event of a test sample failure, the 93 assignments would serve as an important diagnostic tool, pinpointing specific variables and their interactions that conflict with the expected outcome, thereby enabling subject matter experts (SMEs) to analyze the relevant rules and their relationships to determine if adjustments are needed in either the clinical logic or risk assessment criteria. In the next section, we will look at policy refinement and how SMEs can apply annotations to improve and correct the rules, variables, and custom types of the Automated Reasoning policy.</p><h2>Policy refinement through annotations</h2><p>Annotations provide a powerful improvement mechanism for Automated Reasoning policies when tests fail to produce expected results. Through annotations, SMEs can systematically refine policies by:</p><ul><li>Correcting problematic rules by modifying their logic or conditions</li><li>Adding missing variables essential to the policy definition</li><li>Updating variable descriptions for greater precision and clarity</li><li>Resolving translation issues where original policy language was ambiguous</li><li>Deleting redundant or conflicting elements from the policy</li></ul><p>This iterative process of testing, annotating, and updating creates increasingly robust policies that accurately encode domain expertise. As shown in the figure below, annotations can be applied to modify various policy elements, after which the refined policy can be exported as a JSON file for deployment.</p><p>In the following figure, we can see how annotations are being applied, and rules are deleted in the policy. Similarly, additions and updates can be made to rules, variables, or the custom types.</p><p>When the subject matter expert has validated the Automated Reasoning policy through testing, applying annotations, and validating the rules, it is possible to export the policy as a JSON file.</p><h2>Using Automated Reasoning checks at inference</h2><p>To use the Automated Reasoning checks with the created policy, we can now navigate to <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/guardrails/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Amazon Bedrock&nbsp;Guardrails</a>,and create a new guardrail by entering the name, description, and the messaging that will be displayed when the guardrail intervenes and blocks a prompt or a output from the AI system.</p><p>Now, we can attach Automated Reasoning check by using the toggle to <strong>Enable Automated Reasoning policy</strong>. We can set a confidence threshold, which determines how strictly the policy should be enforced. This threshold ranges from 0.00 to 1.00, with 1.00 being the default and most stringent setting. Each guardrail can accommodate up to two separate automated reasoning policies for enhanced validation flexibility. In the following figure, we are attaching the draft version of the medical policy related to patient hospital readmission risk assessment.</p><p>Now we can create the guardrail. Once you’ve established the guardrail and linked your automated reasoning policies, verify your setup by reviewing the guardrail details page to confirm all policies are properly attached.</p><p>When you’re finished with your implementation, clean up your resources by deleting the guardrail and automated reasoning policies you created. Before deleting a guardrail, be sure to disassociate it from all resources or applications that use it.</p><p>In this first part of our blog, we explored how Automated Reasoning checks in Amazon Bedrock Guardrails help maintain the reliability and accuracy of generative AI applications through mathematical verification. You can use increased document processing capacity, advanced validation mechanisms, and comprehensive test management features to validate AI outputs against business rules and domain knowledge. This approach addresses key challenges facing enterprises deploying generative AI systems, particularly in regulated industries where factual accuracy and policy compliance are essential. Our hospital readmission risk assessment demonstration shows how this technology supports the validation of complex decision-making processes, helping transform generative AI into systems suitable for critical business environments. You can use these capabilities through both the AWS Management Console and APIs to establish quality control processes for your AI applications.</p><p>&nbsp;is a Sr. Data Scientist–Generative AI, Amazon Bedrock, where he contributes to cutting edge innovations in foundational models and generative AI applications at AWS.

You’ve just integrated a powerful new LLM into your workflow, and the possibilities feel endless. Then comes the reality: bridging the gap between the model's linguistic intelligence and the practical, real-world actions you need it to perform. This means wrestling with a dozen different APIs, each with its own authentication quirks, data schemas, and documentation (or lack thereof). You write glue code. You build bespoke adapters. And just when you get it all working, a new model comes out, or an API updates, and you’re back to square one, refactoring your integrations for a new host environment.</p><p>It feels like the pre-USB era of computing, where every peripheral needed its own proprietary port. What if there was a USB-C for AI? A single, standardized protocol that allowed any model, in any compatible environment, to seamlessly connect to a universe of tools, resources, and knowledge.</p><p>This isn't a hypothetical. This is the Model Context Protocol (MCP), and if you're a developer working with AI, it's the paradigm shift you've been waiting for.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  What is the Model Context Protocol, and Why Is It More Than Just an API Wrapper?\n</h2><p>Developed and open-sourced by Anthropic, the creators of Claude, the Model Context Protocol (MCP) is a standardized communication layer designed to allow Large Language Models (LLMs) to interact with external systems. At its heart, it functions as a universal adapter. Think of it this way: your LLM is the computer, and the vast world of APIs, local files, and SaaS tools are the peripherals. MCP is the USB-C port that lets them all talk to each other, regardless of the manufacturer.</p><p>This analogy is more than just a convenient metaphor; it captures the essence of MCP's value. Before a standard like USB-C, connecting a monitor, a mouse, and a hard drive required a messy assortment of VGA, PS/2, and SCSI ports. Similarly, without a standard like MCP, connecting an LLM to a web search API, a local file system, and a project management tool requires writing custom, brittle code for each interaction.</p><p>A common misconception is to view MCP as just another API wrapper. While an MCP server can wrap an API, its role is far more sophisticated. A standard API is a generic interface not built with AI in mind. It communicates via HTTP requests and returns structured data, but it leaves the burden of interpretation and execution logic on the developer.</p><p>MCP, by contrast, is a specialized translation layer designed for an LLM. It creates an abstraction that not only connects to a tool but also describes its capabilities in a way the model can understand, enabling the model to reason about how and when to use the tool. This structured communication, typically over JSON-RPC, reduces ambiguity and dramatically improves the reliability of tool use.</p><p>This standardization creates a powerful network effect. The more developers build and share MCP servers, the more valuable the protocol becomes for everyone. It fosters a burgeoning ecosystem where tools become composable and portable, freeing developers from the endless cycle of rebuilding integrations.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  The Host-Client-Server Trinity: A Framework for MCP Mastery\n</h2><p>To master MCP, you must understand its three core architectural components. This trinity forms the foundation of every interaction.</p><ol><li><p>: This is the AI application or development environment where you interact with the LLM. It's the \"computer\" in our analogy. Examples include Anthropic's , AI-native code editors like , or automation platforms like  and . The host provides the user interface and the core LLM capabilities.</p></li><li><p>: This component lives within the host. It's the part that speaks the MCP language. In most practical scenarios, the client is pre-integrated into the host application, so you don't need to build or manage it yourself. Its job is to discover, communicate with, and invoke MCP servers.</p></li><li><p>: This is the heart of the system and where developers spend most of their time. The MCP server is the \"USB-C adapter\" that connects to the actual tool or resource. It’s an independent process that exposes capabilities to the client. One server can wrap a single API, or it can bundle a whole suite of functionalities.</p></li></ol><p>An MCP server can provide three distinct types of capabilities to a host:</p><ul><li><p>: This is the most common use case. A tool represents an action the LLM can take, typically by calling an external API. This could be anything from fetching the current weather, searching the web, generating images, or even automating actions in a 3D modeling program like a Blender.</p></li><li><p>: These are sources of context that can be injected into the model's awareness. A server can provide access to local file contents, database records, API responses, live system data, log files, or even binary data like images and PDFs. This allows the LLM to work with information that isn't publicly available on the internet.</p></li><li><p>: Servers can offer pre-defined, dynamic prompt structures. These are more than just static text; they can accept arguments, chain multiple interactions, and guide the LLM through specific workflows, acting like reusable functions for complex tasks.\nOnce you build an MCP server—say, one that connects to your company's internal documentation database—that server can be used by any developer in their preferred MCP-compatible host, be it , , or any other. The logic is encapsulated and portable.</p></li></ul><h2>\n  \n  \n  What Strategic Advantages Does MCP Offer Over Direct API Calls?\n</h2><p>For a senior developer, adopting a new technology must offer clear, strategic benefits. MCP delivers on several fronts, moving beyond mere convenience to offer significant architectural advantages over traditional function-calling with direct API integrations.</p><ul><li><p>: This is the killer feature. When you build a direct API integration, it's tied to that specific application and host. If you switch from an in-house script to using , you have to rebuild that integration. With MCP, you build the server once. That server, which encapsulates all the logic for interacting with your tool, can be plugged into any MCP-compliant host without modification. This drastically reduces redundant work and accelerates development.</p></li><li><p><strong>Dynamic Discovery &amp; Maintenance Offloading</strong>: An MCP server can advertise its capabilities to a client. This means an LLM can dynamically ask a server what it's capable of and get a structured response. Furthermore, when an underlying API (e.g., the Zapier API) changes, you don't need to update your application code. As long as the community-maintained Zapier MCP server is updated, your integration continues to work seamlessly. You effectively offload the maintenance burden to the server's maintainer.</p></li><li><p>: The protocol's specification simplifies everything. Instead of juggling dozens of unique API authentication methods, endpoint structures, and data formats, you work with a single, predictable protocol based on JSON-RPC. This makes development, and especially debugging, significantly more straightforward.</p></li><li><p><strong>Superior LLM-Tool Reliability</strong>: Because MCP is designed for LLMs, the communication is clearer and less error-prone. The structured way it presents tool definitions and schemas helps the model reason more effectively about parameter selection and invocation, leading to more reliable outcomes than you often get with generic function-calling.</p></li></ul><h2>\n  \n  \n  How Do You Implement Your First MCP Server?\n</h2><p>Getting started is surprisingly straightforward, especially when leveraging the existing ecosystem. Here is a high-level guide to integrating your first pre-built server within the Claude Desktop host.</p><p><strong>Step 1: The Environment Setup Checklist</strong>\nBefore you can connect a server, your local environment needs a few key components.</p><ul><li>: Download and install an MCP-compatible host.  is an excellent starting point.</li><li>: Within 's settings ( -&gt; ), you must enable this option. This exposes the necessary configuration files and logs.</li><li>: Most MCP servers are written in either Node.js or Python.\n\n<ul><li>Install : This is required to run servers that use the  command.</li><li>Install : This is needed for servers that use the  command (from the  package manager).</li></ul></li><li><code>Pro Tip on Version Management</code>: To avoid dependency conflicts between different servers requiring different runtime versions, use a version manager from day one. Use  (Node Version Manager) for Node.js and  for Python. This allows you to switch versions on a per-project basis and is an essential practice for serious development.</li></ul><p><strong>Step 2: Integrating a Pre-Built Server</strong>\nYou don't need to write a server from scratch to get started. The official MCP server repository on GitHub contains dozens of ready-to-use servers.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Locate the Configuration File</strong>: In , navigate to  -&gt;  -&gt;  and click . This will open your <code>claude_desktop_config.json</code> file.</p></li><li><p><strong>Add the Server Definition</strong>: You'll add a JSON object to this file that defines the server you want to run. The structure is simple, containing a name, the command to execute, and any necessary arguments. For example, to add a server that gives Claude access to your local file system, the entry might look like this:</p></li></ul><div><pre><code>{\n  \"mcp_servers\": {\n    \"file-system\": {\n      \"command\": \"npx\",\n      \"args\": [\n        \"@mcp/file-system\",\n        \"--root=~/\"\n      ]\n    }\n  }\n}\n</code></pre></div><ul><li>: Crucially, any changes to the config file require a full restart of the host application. For , this means quitting the application from the system tray, not just closing the window.\nUpon restart, the host will launch the server process, and its capabilities (e.g., reading or writing local files) will become available within the Claude chat interface.</li></ul><p>\nWhen things go wrong, MCP provides clear debugging pathways.</p><ul><li>: Your host application generates logs that are invaluable for debugging connection issues. In , you can access these via  -&gt; . These logs will show the handshake between the client and server and any errors that occur.</li><li>: For debugging the server itself, the  is an essential tool. It’s a command-line utility that allows you to interact directly with your server, inspect its capabilities, and test its responses before you even involve a host application.</li></ul><h2>\n  \n  \n  What Advanced Concepts and Security Risks Should I Be Aware Of?\n</h2><p>As you move beyond basic integrations, you'll encounter more advanced—and critical—concepts.</p><ul><li>: MCP defines how data moves between client and server. The two primary transports are:\n\n<ul><li>: Standard Input/Output. This is ideal for high-speed, local processes, where the host and server run on the same machine.

You wish there was a step-by-step walkthrough from setting up your local environment to making your first pull request? This tutorial is for you.</p><p>I recently made my first pull request to Django. Actually, it was the first pull request I ever made, since I had mainly worked on one-person-projects before. As I went along,I documented the steps, including links to the relevant documentation pages. I started from an existing patch that needed improvement, which is an approach that I recommend for your first ticket.</p><p>In this tutorial, we will focus on the git/github workflow. For additional aspects, such as working with Django's ticket system, please also see <a href=\"https://dev.to/_e6641d4181e2ba2945d1f/djangonautfirst-pr-week-1-2-929-1010-2ah2\">Rim Choi's blog post</a>. We will go through the following steps:</p><ul><li>Setting up your local environment</li><li>Finding a ticket to work on</li><li>Going through the contribution checklist</li></ul><h3>\n  \n  \n  Setting up your local environment\n</h3><h4>\n  \n  \n  Getting a copy of Django’s development version\n</h4><p>As described in Django's <a href=\"https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.2/intro/contributing/#getting-a-copy-of-django-s-development-version\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">contribution tutorial</a>, fork the Django repo on GitHub. Then, clone your Django fork to your local machine:<code>git clone https://github.com/YourGitHubName/django.git</code></p><p>Your Django fork is automatically added as a remote repository named \"origin\". You can verify this with the git remote command:</p><p>As described in <a href=\"https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.2/internals/contributing/writing-code/working-with-git/#setting-up-local-repository\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Working with Git and GitHub</a>, you need to add the original Django repository as an additional remote. It's a good convention to call it \"upstream\":<code>git remote add upstream https://github.com/django/django.git</code></p><p>If you have not done so already with , configure your username and email address for your local Django git repository:<code>git config user.name &lt;your name&gt;</code><code>git config user.email &lt;your email&gt;</code></p><h4>\n  \n  \n  Creating a virtual environment\n</h4><p>Create and activate a virtual environment, as described in the <a href=\"https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.2/intro/contributing/#getting-a-copy-of-django-s-development-version\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">contribution tutorial</a>. Inside your virtual environment, install your local copy of Django in editable mode:<code>pip install -e /path/to/your/local/clone/django/</code></p><p>Install the test dependencies:<code>pip install -r requirements/py3.txt</code></p><p>If the installation fails, the cause could be a missing system-level dependency. Just as an example, on Ubuntu 22.04, I had to install the system package libmemcached-dev:<code>sudo apt install libmemcached-dev</code></p><p>After installing the missing system packages, retry the installation of the test dependencies.</p><p>Once the test dependencies are installed, you should be able to run <a href=\"https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.2/intro/contributing/#running-django-s-test-suite-for-the-first-time\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Django's test suite</a>:</p><p>The Django documentation has its own dependencies. You will likely need them later, so go ahead and install them:<code>pip install -r requirements.txt</code></p><p>Now, change back to the top-level folder of your Django repository, e.g. with . Install the <a href=\"https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.2/internals/contributing/writing-code/coding-style/#coding-style-pre-commit\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">pre-commit hooks</a>:</p><p>Finding a beginner-friendly ticket to work on can seem a bit challenging at first. There is an <a href=\"https://code.djangoproject.com/query?easy=1&amp;stage=Accepted&amp;status=assigned&amp;status=new&amp;order=id&amp;desc=1&amp;col=id&amp;col=summary&amp;col=owner&amp;col=type&amp;col=component\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">easy pickings filter</a>, but tickets with this category are rare and often already assigned. I would recommend you to find the easiest ticket possible, so you can focus on the contribution workflow first. And if your first ticket is a quick success, you will be more motivated to keep going.</p><p>In her excellent video tutorial <a href=\"https://youtu.be/A-3eTMNQ3rM?si=DWhLKpFBuEb8FawZ&amp;t=761\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Your first Django contribution</a>, Django fellow Sarah Boyce recommends the so-called \"vulture strategy\", i.e. working on a patch from a previously submitted pull request that needs improvement. <a href=\"https://code.djangoproject.com/query?changetime=..Apr+30%2C+2025&amp;has_patch=1&amp;needs_better_patch=1&amp;stage=Accepted&amp;status=assigned&amp;status=new&amp;type=Bug&amp;group=component&amp;order=changetime&amp;col=id&amp;col=summary&amp;col=changetime&amp;col=owner&amp;col=version\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Her filters</a> are:</p><ul><li>Patch needs improvement = Yes</li><li>Modified = between \"-\" and 6 months ago</li></ul><p>It can also be helpful to group the resulting ticket list by component:</p><p>When you decide to work on a ticket, please assign it to yourself. If you are unsure whether someone else is currently working on the ticket, you can leave a comment asking if you can take over. If you don't get a response within 48 h, assigning the ticket to yourself is probably fine. See also <a href=\"https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.2/internals/contributing/writing-code/submitting-patches/#claiming-tickets\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">\"Claiming\" tickets</a>.</p><p>You chose a ticket with an existing patch that needs improvement. There may be several pull requests associated with your ticket. You should always base your work on the most recent patch, as explained in <a href=\"https://youtu.be/A-3eTMNQ3rM?si=Cw2QoeLJdRv90BOd&amp;t=885\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Sarah Boyce's video</a>.</p><p>Here's one way to get the existing patch into your local branch:<code>curl -L https://github.com/django/django/pull/xxxxx.patch | git am</code>\nSee also <a href=\"https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.2/internals/contributing/writing-code/working-with-git/#working-on-a-patch\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Working on a patch</a>.</p><p>For reproducing errors and testing your changes, you should work with a <a href=\"https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.2/internals/contributing/writing-code/submitting-patches/#testing-with-a-django-project\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Django test project</a> which uses the same virtual environment that you just set up, with your local Django copy installed in editable mode.</p><p>Once you made your changes, you'll probably want to do a commit. That's when the <a href=\"https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.2/internals/contributing/writing-code/coding-style/#coding-style-pre-commit\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">pre-commit hooks</a> are activated. Their purpose is to catch as many errors before you push them to the remote repository. For instance, your code will be formatted with <a href=\"https://github.com/psf/black\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">black</a>. You'll need to re-stage the changes made by the pre-commit hooks and retry the commit. You might have to manually fix some errors, too. Here is an example error message for a comment line that is too long:</p><p><code>flake8...................................................................Failed</code><code>django/conf/locale/de_CH/formats.py:28:80: W505 doc line too long (80 &gt; 79 characters)</code></p><p>In this example, I needed to shorten my comment line to a maximum of 79 characters.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Going through the contribution checklist\n</h3><p>At this point, you have made one or several commits on your ticket branch to improve the existing patch.You have addressed all the comments in the ticket and in the previous pull request. You think your changes are ready for a new pull request.</p><p>That's when you need to go through the <a href=\"https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.2/internals/contributing/writing-code/submitting-patches/#contribution-checklist\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">contribution checklist</a>. For your case, i.e. a bug fix that needs improvement, probably all sections are relevant except  and . I'll pick out a few steps, but please do read the whole checklist and go through all the points that apply.</p><p>Before you go through the contribution checklist, check if the upstream main branch has changed in the meantime. If so, please <a href=\"https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.2/internals/contributing/writing-code/working-with-git/#after-upstream-has-changed\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">rebase your work</a>:</p><p>Now, check whether the documentation builds without any errors. From your local Django directory:</p><p>Back inside the top-level Django directory, make sure the test suite passes:</p><p><a href=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/git-squash-commits/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Squash</a> your commits and the commits of previous contributors of the patch into one single commit. Check how many commits you need to edit:\nLet's say you want to squash 3 commits into one:</p><p>Leave the word  next to your last commit. Replace  with  next to the other two commits.</p><p>Save the file. git will open a new file for you with the combined commit messages. Edit them so they match Django's <a href=\"https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.2/internals/contributing/committing-code/#committing-guidelines\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">commit message format</a>. Don't forget to mention the co-authors of the patch, i.e. the authors of the previous patch which you improved. Example:<code>Fixed #35095 -- Clarified Swiss number formatting in docs/topics/i18n/formatting.txt.</code><code>Co-Authored-By: Name &lt;email@address&gt;</code></p><p>Now you can push your squashed commit to your remote fork:<code>git push origin ticket_&lt;ticket number&gt;</code></p><p>If you messed up the commit message, e.g. you forgot the final period, and you already pushed your changes to your Django fork, you can rewrite the commit message like so:</p><p>Write \"reword\" next to your commit in the text editor:</p><p>Save the file. A new file opens where you can edit your commit message. Make your changes, and save this second file, too. The commit message is now rewritten.\nIf you had pushed the changes already to your Django fork, you need to force-push the modified commit:<code>git push --force origin &lt;your branch&gt;</code></p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Creating the pull request\n</h3><p>Enter a description for the pull request. Mention the ticket number as suggested in the comment. If your patch is based on a previous pull request, mention it in the description. See my <a href=\"https://github.com/django/django/pull/19933\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">example description</a>.</p><p>If some GitHub checks fail, you can check the details of the failure via the three little dots next to the test:</p><p>If some linting- or formatting-related checks fail and you can fix the issue immediately, it is okay to force-push a rewritten commit. In other circumstances, you should avoid force-pushing since it can erase valuable context for the reviewer.</p><p>While your code is being <a href=\"https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.2/internals/contributing/writing-code/working-with-git/#after-review\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">reviewed</a>, you may experience several iterations of the following cycle:</p><ul><li>add commits to your local branch</li><li>squash all new local commits into one review commit</li><li>push the review commit to your remote branch</li></ul><p>Don't give up :) I hope your PR gets merged!</p>","contentLength":8105,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"The Async Iterator: When Regular Loops Block the Event Loop","url":"https://dev.to/aaron_rose_0787cc8b4775a0/the-async-iterator-when-regular-loops-block-the-event-loop-f24","date":1761937767,"author":"Aaron Rose","guid":323714,"unread":true,"content":"<p>Timothy stared at his screen, puzzled.

That's a synchronous blocking operation—it doesn't yield control to the event loop. The same would happen with regular file I/O, network calls without await, or CPU-intensive computation. The for loop just keeps executing these blocking operations one after another without ever giving other tasks a chance to run.\"</p><p>\"If you absolutely must run blocking code that doesn't have an async version,\" Margaret added, \"you can use  to run it in a separate thread so it doesn't freeze the event loop. But that's a workaround—whenever possible, use truly async operations like async generators for I/O.\"</p><p>She showed a quick example:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>\"But for file reading and other I/O, async generators are the proper solution—cleaner, more efficient, and more scalable.\"</p><p>\"So how do I fix my log analyzer?\" Timothy asked.</p><p>\"You need ,\" Margaret said. \"It's like a regular  loop, but it cooperates with the event loop.\"</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><div><pre><code>Starting async iteration\n  Generating 0\n[Background] Working 0\n  Received 0\n  Generating 1\n  Received 1\n[Background] Working 1\n  Generating 2\n  Received 2\n  Generating 3\n[Background] Working 2\n  Received 3\n  Generating 4\n  Received 4\nAsync iteration done\n</code></pre></div><p>\"They're interleaved!\" Timothy said. \"The tasks are actually running concurrently now.\"</p><p>\"Right.

Understanding MQTT 5 Data Types\n</h3><p>MQTT is a standard messaging protocol for IoT. It's designed as a lightweight pub/sub messaging transport for connecting remote device with small footprint and low bandwidth usage. </p><p>MQTT 5 introduces several data types that are important for building a client from scratch:</p><ul></ul><p>Implementing these correctly is the first step toward building a functional MQTT client in Go.</p><p>I implemented the following functions, which will be used for encoding and decoding MQTT packets.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><h4>\n  \n  \n  1.c - Variable Byte Integer\n</h4><p>This one is less straightforward, and from the specifications :  </p><p><em>\"The Variable Byte Integer is encoded using an encoding scheme which uses a single byte for values up to 127. Larger values are handled as follows. The least significant seven bits of each byte encode the data, and the most significant bit is used to indicate whether there are bytes following in the representation. Thus, each byte encodes 128 values and a \"continuation bit\". The maximum number of bytes in the Variable Byte Integer field is four. The encoded value MUST use the minimum number of bytes necessary to represent the value\"</em></p><p>It’s an efficient way to represent values from 0 to 268,435,455 while using as few bytes as possible.</p><p>For example, to represent a value between 0 and 127, you only need one byte. For values between 128 and 16,383, you need two bytes. And so on, up to four bytes for the maximum range.</p><p>Here’s a table to illustrate:</p><div><table><tbody><tr></tr><tr><td>16,384 (0x80, 0x80, 0x01)</td><td>2,097,151 (0xFF, 0xFF, 0x7F)</td></tr><tr><td>2,097,152 (0x80, 0x80, 0x80, 0x01)</td><td>268,435,455 (0xFF, 0xFF, 0xFF, 0x7F)</td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>Lucky us, the specifications provide the following pseudo code :-) :</p><div><pre><code>do\n   encodedByte = X MOD 128\n   X = X DIV 128\n   // if there are more data to encode, set the top bit of this byte\n   if (X &gt; 0)\n      encodedByte = encodedByte OR 128\n   endif\n   'output' encodedByte\nwhile (X &gt; 0)\n\nWhere MOD is the modulo operator (% in C), DIV is integer division (/ in C), and OR is bit-wise or (| in C).\n\n</code></pre></div><p>which can be easily translated into the following go code :</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>\nThis function encodes an integer into Variable Byte Integer format and writes it to a buffer. It repeatedly takes the value modulo 128 to extract the lower 7 bits, sets the continuation bit (0x80) if more bytes are needed, and writes each byte to the buffer. The loop continues until the remaining length is zero.</p><p><strong>Some examples as encoded values :</strong></p><div><pre><code>value : 127\nBinary: 0111 1111\n        └─ continuation bit = 0 (no more bytes to follow)\nSince 127 fits in 7 bits, only one byte is needed, continuation bit is 0\n\nvalue  :349\nbinary :1101 1101 | 0000 0010\n        |           └─ continuation bit = 0 (no more bytes), \n        └─ continuation bit = 1 (more bytes follow), \n</code></pre></div><p>The following function is used to decode variable byte integer</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>\nWe read a Variable Byte Integer from an io.Reader by decoding one byte at a time.<p>\nEach byte contributes 7 bits of data, and the most significant bit (MSB) acts as a continuation flag: if it’s set to 1, another byte follows, if it’s 0, the value is complete.</p></p><p>On each iteration, the function:</p><ol><li>Masks out the MSB (buf[0] &amp; 0x7F) to get the data bits.</li><li>Adds them to the accumulated value, scaled by a multiplier (1, 128, 128², 128³).</li><li>Checks if the MSB is not 1, if so, decoding is done.</li></ol><p>If more than four bytes are read, it returns an error because the MQTT spec limits Variable Byte Integers to four bytes.</p><p>Binary data consists of a two-byte integer indicating its length, followed by that many bytes, limiting the size to 0–65,535 bytes.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><h4>\n  \n  \n  1.e - UTF-8 Encoded String\n</h4><p>The specifications say : <em>\"string data is prefixed with a two byte length field that gives the number of bytes in the UTF-8 encoded string itself.Consequently, the maximum size of a UTF-8 Encoded String is 65,535 bytes.\nExample: given the string \"hello\", the encoded string will be 0x00 0x05 0x68 0x65 0x6c 0x6c 0x6f<p>\nThe first two bytes 0x00 0x05 represent the length of the string \"hello\" and the remaining bytes are the UTF-8 encoded string\"</p></em></p><p>The functions for encoding and decoding UTF-8 strings are straightforward and use the 2 byte integer and binary encode/decode functions we discussed earlier.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>A UTF-8 String Pair consists of two UTF-8 encoded strings ( explained in previous section 1.e) and is used to store name-value pairs. The first string represents the name, and the second represents the value.</p><p>Now we have all these necessary functions, we can implement a connection to the broker.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  2. Connecting to the broker\n</h3><p>Once a network connection to the broker is established (typically over TCP or WebSocket), the client must send a  packet to initiate a session.</p><p>The MQTT 5  packet contains essential information for establishing a connection between the client and broker:</p><p>\nA unique ID that identifies the client to the broker. If not provided, the broker may assign one automatically (when Clean Start is true).</p><p>\nA flag that determines whether the broker should start a fresh session or resume a previous one with stored state (subscriptions, queued messages, etc.).</p><p>\nA time interval (in seconds) that specifies how often the client must communicate with the broker. If no messages are exchanged within this period, the client sends a PINGREQ packet to maintain the connection. A value of 0 disables the keep-alive mechanism.</p><p>\nOptional username and password fields for broker authentication, controlled by their respective flags in the Connect Flags byte.</p><p>\nAn optional message that the broker will publish on behalf of the client if it disconnects ungracefully. This includes:</p><ul><li>: Where the message will be published</li><li>: The message content</li><li>: Quality of Service level (0, 1, or 2)</li><li>: Whether the message should be retained by the broker</li><li>: MQTT 5 specific properties for the Will message</li></ul><p><p>\nMQTT 5 introduces properties that provide additional metadata and capabilities, such as:</p></p><ul><li>Request/Response Information</li><li>User Properties (custom key-value pairs)</li></ul><p>These fields work together to establish a reliable, authenticated connection with appropriate session handling and failure recovery mechanisms.</p><p>Just like most MQTT control packets (e.g. PUBLISH, SUBSCRIBE, etc.), the CONNECT packet follows a general structure consisting of three sections:</p><ol></ol><p>The fixed header is present in every MQTT control packet.\nIt always starts with one byte representing the packet type and flags, followed by one or more bytes representing the remaining length.</p><div><table><tbody><tr><td>Control Packet Type and Flags</td><td>Bits 7–4 identify the packet type (e.g. 1 for CONNECT, 3 for PUBLISH). Bits 3–0 are reserved for flags specific to each packet type.</td></tr><tr><td>Encoded as a , it specifies the total number of bytes in the Variable Header and Payload.</td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>For example, the first byte of a CONNECT packet is always 0x10 (binary 0001 0000), where:</p><ol><li>Bits 7–4 (0001) = Packet type 1 → CONNECT</li><li>Bits 3–0 (0000) = Flags (must be 0 for CONNECT)</li></ol><p>The Remaining Length is simply the total of the variable header and payload sizes, encoded using the Variable Byte Integer function we wrote earlier.</p><p>As its name suggests, the variable header structure and content vary depending on the packet type.</p><p>For the CONNECT packet, the variable header has a well-defined structure that looks like this:</p><div><table><tbody><tr><td>Always . Identifies the protocol being used.</td></tr><tr><td>Indicates the protocol version. For MQTT 5.0, this value is .</td></tr><tr><td>Bit flags defining session behavior (e.g. ), Will Message options, and authentication fields (Username/Password).</td></tr><tr><td>Maximum time interval, in seconds, between control packets sent by the client.</td></tr><tr><td>Variable Byte Integer + Property List</td><td>MQTT 5 introduces properties that provide extensibility and optional connection parameters.</td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>\nThe Connect Flags byte contains multiple bit fields, each controlling a specific connection behavior. <p>\nThis is an efficient way to encode 8 Boolean values in just one byte instead of using 8 separate bytes.</p></p><p>Here’s the breakdown of each bit (from most significant to least):</p><div><table><tbody><tr><td>Set to 1 if a Username is present in the payload.</td></tr><tr><td>Set to 1 if a Password is present in the payload.</td></tr><tr><td>Set to 1 if the Will Message should be retained.</td></tr><tr><td>Quality of Service level for the Will Message (0–2).</td></tr><tr><td>Set to 1 if a Will Message is included.</td></tr><tr><td>If 1, the client starts a new session; if 0, it resumes the previous one.</td></tr><tr></tr></tbody></table></div><p>The Connect Flags are encoded using the following function</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>\nWe initialize an empty byte (), then for each flag that needs to be set, we use bitwise OR operations to set the appropriate bit to 1.</p><p>For example, if  is true, we need to set bit 2 (counting from 0, right to left). We OR the flags byte with  (binary ) to set this bit. The |= operator performs a bitwise OR and assigns the result back to flags.</p><p>For the Will QoS level (0-2), we use a left shift operation () to position the QoS value at bits 3-4. For instance, if willQoS is 2 (), shifting it left by 3 positions gives us  ().</p><p><strong>Encoding the Variable Header</strong></p><p>Now that we understand the structure, let's look at how to encode the complete variable header:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>MQTT 5 properties are encoded as:</p><ol><li>A Variable Byte Integer representing the total length of all properties</li><li>A sequence of property ID (byte) + property value pairs</li></ol><p>Each property has a unique identifier (e.g.,  for Session Expiry Interval,  for Receive Maximum). Here's a simplified example:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>The payload contains the actual connection data referenced by the Connect Flags:</p><div><table><thead><tr></tr></thead><tbody><tr></tr><tr></tr><tr></tr><tr></tr><tr></tr></tbody></table></div><p>The payload is encoded in this exact order and this is the function I wrote to encode it :</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Putting it all together :</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>After sending a well-formed  packet, the broker responds with a  packet that includes a Reason Code and an optional Session Present flag in its variable header. \nThe  packet may also include server-capability properties, such as the maximum supported , and it can override certain properties that were specified in the  packet.\nFor example, if the broker returns the  property, it replaces the client’s original  value specified in the  packet.</p><p>For testing, I use the excellent testcontainers library, with EMQX as the MQTT broker and Redis to simulate a secured broker using username/password authentication.\nHere's the code to set up a secured broker using username/password authentication backed by Redis, followed by connection tests:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>In this first part, we've built the foundation of our MQTT 5.0 client by implementing the core data types and the complete  packet encoding and decoding.

The spritesheet has Pacman-style ghosts in three different colours on three rows, each with two images of them going left and two going right and a slight animation between the two.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>This uses the fade to colour function then utilises a spritesheet of a single image that flies past a couple of times then uses scaling to make it seem like it flies at the screen.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>This one is a bit more complicated.

Don’t start from a technical approach; work backwards from business goals</h3><p>This may seem obvious, but after working with over a thousand customers, we’ve found that working backwards from business goals is a critical factor in why <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/beyond-pilots-a-proven-framework-for-scaling-ai-to-production/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">projects supported by the Innovation Center achieve a 65% production success rate</a>, with some launching within 45 days. We apply this same strategy to every customization project by first identifying and prioritizing tangible business outcomes that a technical solution will drive. Success must be measurable and deliver real business value, helping avoid flashy experiments that end up sitting on a shelf instead of producing results. In the Custom Model Program, many customers initially approach us seeking specific technical solutions—such as jumping directly into model pre-training or continued pre-training—without having defined downstream use cases, data strategies, or evaluation plans. By starting with clear business objectives first, we make sure that technical decisions align with strategic goals and create meaningful impact for the organization.</p><h3>2. Pick the right customization approach</h3><p>Start with a baseline customization approach and exhaust simpler approaches before diving into deep model customization. The first question we ask customers seeking custom model development is “What have you already tried?” We recommend establishing this baseline with prompt engineering and RAG before exploring more complex techniques. While there’s a spectrum of model optimization approaches that can achieve higher performance, sometimes the simplest solution is the most effective. Once you establish this baseline, identify remaining gaps and opportunities to determine whether advancing to the next level makes strategic sense.</p><p>Customization options range from lightweight approaches like supervised fine-tuning to ground-up model development. We typically advise starting with lighter-weight solutions that require smaller amounts of data and compute, then progressing to more complex techniques only when specific use cases or remaining gaps justify the investment:</p><ul><li> sharpens the model’s focus for specific use cases, for example delivering consistent customer service responses or adapting to your organization’s preferred phrasing, structure and reasoning patterns. <a href=\"https://www.vw.com/en.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Volkswagen</a>, one of the world’s largest automobile manufacturers, achieved an “improvement in AI-powered brand consistency checks, increasing accuracy in identifying on-brand images from 55% to 70%,” notes Dr. Philip Trempler, Technical Lead AI &amp; Cloud Engineering at Volkswagen Group Services.</li><li><strong>Model efficiency and deployment tuning </strong>supports organizations like <a href=\"https://robinai.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Robin AI</a>, a leader in AI-powered legal contract technology, to create tailored models that speed up human verification. Organizations can also use techniques like quantization, pruning, and system optimizations to improve model performance and reduce infrastructure costs.</li><li>uses reward functions or preference data to align models to preferred behavior. This approach is often combined with supervised fine-tuning so organizations like Cosine AI can refine their models’ decision making to match organizational preferences.</li><li> allow organizations like <a href=\"https://www.athenarc.gr/en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Athena RC</a>, a leading research center in Greece, to build Greek-first foundation models that expand language capabilities beyond English. By continually pre-training large language models on extensive Greek data, Athena RC strengthens the models’ core understanding of the Greek language, culture, and usage – not just their domain knowledge. Their <a href=\"https://www.athenarc.gr/en/new-athena-project-meltemi\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Meltemi-7B</a> and <a href=\"https://www.athenarc.gr/en/news/llama-krikri-new-greek-ai-language-model-featured-kathimerini\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Llama-Krikri-8B</a> models demonstrate how continued pre-training and instruction tuning can create open, high-quality Greek models for applications across research, education, industry, and society.</li><li><strong>Domain-specific foundation model development</strong> enables organizations like <a href=\"https://www.tgs.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">TGS</a>, a leading energy data, insights, and technology provider, to build custom AI models from scratch, ideal for those with highly specialized requirements and substantial volume of proprietary data. TGS helps energy companies make smarter exploration and development decisions by solving some of the industry’s toughest challenges in understanding what lies beneath the Earth’s surface. TGS has enhanced its Seismic Foundation Models (SFMs) to more reliably detect underground geological structures—such as faults and reservoirs—that indicate potential oil and gas deposits. The benefit is clear: operators can reduce uncertainty, lower exploration costs, and make faster investment decisions.</li></ul><p>Data quality and accessibility will be a major consideration in determining feasibility of each customization technique. Clean, high-quality data is essential both for model improvement and measuring progress. While some Innovation Center customers achieve performance gains with relatively smaller volumes of fine-tuning training pairs on instruction-tuned foundation models, approaches like continued pre-training typically require large volumes of training tokens. This reinforces the importance of starting simple—as you test lighter-weight model tuning, you can collect and process larger data volumes in parallel for future phases.</p><h3>3. Define measures for what good looks like</h3><p>Success needs to be measurable, regardless of which technical approach you choose. It’s critical to establish clear methods for measuring both overall business outcomes and the technical solution’s performance. At the model or application level, teams typically optimize across some combination of relevance, latency, and cost. However, the metrics for your production application won’t be general leaderboard metrics—they must be unique to what matters for your business.</p><p>Customers developing content generation systems prioritize metrics like relevance, clarity, style, and tone. Consider this example from Volkswagen Group: “We fine-tuned Nova Pro in SageMaker AI using our marketing experts’ knowledge. This improved the model’s ability to identify on-brand images, achieving stronger alignment with Volkswagen’s brand guidelines,” according to Volkswagen’s Dr. Trempler. “We are building on these results to enable Volkswagen Group’s vision to scale high-quality, brand-compliant content creation across our diverse automotive markets worldwide using generative AI.” Developing an automated evaluation process is critical for supporting iterative solution improvements.</p><p>For qualitative use cases, it’s essential to align automated evaluations with human experts, particularly in specialized domains. A common solution involves using LLM as judge to review another model or system responses. For instance, when fine-tuning a generation model for a RAG application, you might use an LLM judge to compare the fine-tuned model response to your existing baseline. However, LLM judges come with intrinsic biases and may not align with your internal team’s human preferences or domain expertise. Robin AI partnered with the Innovation Center to develop , an AI model for legal contract review. Emulating expert methodology and creating “a panel of trained judges” using fine-tuning techniques, they obtained smaller and faster models that maintain accuracy while reviewing documents ranging from NDAs to merger agreements. The solution achieved an 80% faster contract review process, enabling lawyers to focus on strategic work while AI handles detailed analysis.</p><h3>4. Consider hardware-level optimizations for training and inference</h3><p>If you’re using a managed service like <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Amazon Bedrock</a>, you can take advantage of built-in optimizations out of the box. However, if you have a more bespoke solution or are operating at a lower level of the technology stack, there are several areas to consider for optimization and efficiency gains. For instance, TGS’s SFMs process massive 3D seismic images (essentially giant CAT scans of the Earth) that can cover tens of thousands of square kilometers. Each dataset is measured in petabytes, far beyond what traditional manual or even semi-automated interpretation methods can handle. By rebuilding their AI models on AWS’s high-performance GPU training infrastructure, TGS achieved near-linear scaling, meaning that adding more computing power results in almost proportional speed increases while maintaining &gt;90% GPU efficiency. As a result, TGS can now deliver actionable subsurface insights, such as identifying drilling targets or de-risking exploration zones, to customers in days instead of weeks.</p><p>Over the life of a model, resource requirements are generally driven by inference requests, and any efficiency gains you can achieve will pay dividends during the production phase. One approach to reduce inference demands is model distillation to reduce the model size itself, but in some cases, there are additional gains to be had by digging deeper into the infrastructure. A recent example is <a href=\"https://www.synthesia.io/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Synthesia</a>, the creator of a leading video generation platform where users can create professional videos without the need for mics, cameras, or actors. Synthesia is continually looking for ways to elevate their user experience, including by decreasing generation times for content. They worked with the Innovation Center to optimize the Variational Autoencoder decoder of their already efficient video generation pipeline. Strategic optimization of the model’s causal convolution layers unlocked powerful compiler performance gains, while asynchronous video chunk writing eliminated GPU idle time – together delivering a dramatic reduction in end-to-end latency and a 29% increase in decoding throughput.</p><h3>5. One size doesn’t fit all</h3><p>The  principle applies to both model size and family. Some models excel out of the box for specific tasks like code generation, tool usage, document processing, or summarization. With the rapid pace of innovation, the best foundation model for a given use case today likely won’t be the best tomorrow. Model size corresponds to the number of parameters and often determines its ability to complete a broad set of general tasks and capabilities. However, larger models require more compute resources at inference time and can be expensive to run at production scale. Many applications don’t need a model that excels at everything but rather one that performs exceptionally well at a more limited set of tasks or domain-specific capabilities.</p><p>Even within a single application, optimization may require using multiple model providers depending on the specific task, complexity level, and latency requirements. In agentic applications, you might use a lightweight model for specialized agent tasks while requiring a more powerful generalist model to orchestrate and supervise those agents. Architecting your solution to be modular and resilient to changing model providers or versions helps you adapt quickly and capitalize on improvements. Services like Amazon Bedrock facilitate this approach by providing a unified API experience across a broad range of model families, including custom versions of many models.</p><h3>How the Innovation Center can help</h3><p>The Custom Model Program by the Innovation Center provides end-to-end expert support from model selection to customization, delivering performance improvements, and reducing time-to-market and value realization.

Since Clario’s founding more than 50 years ago, the company’s endpoint data solutions have supported clinical trials more than 30,000 times with over 700 regulatory approvals across more than 100 countries.</p><p>This post builds upon our previous <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/clario-enhances-the-quality-of-the-clinical-trial-documentation-process-with-amazon-bedrock/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">post</a> discussing how Clario developed an AI solution powered by <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Amazon Bedrock</a> to accelerate clinical trials. Since then, Clario has further enhanced their AI capabilities, focusing on innovative solutions that streamline the generation of software configurations and artifacts for clinical trials while delivering high-quality clinical evidence.</p><p>In clinical trials, designing and customizing various software systems configurations to manage and optimize the different stages of a clinical trial efficiently is critical. These configurations can range from basic study setup to more advanced features like data collection customization and integration with other systems. Clario uses data from multiple sources to build specific software configurations for clinical trials. The traditional workflow involved manual extraction of necessary data from individual forms. These forms contained vital information about exams, visits, conditions, and interventions. Additionally, the process required the need to incorporate study-related information such as study plans, participation criteria, sponsors, collaborators, and standardized exam protocols from multiple enterprise data providers.</p><p>The manual nature of this process created several challenges:</p><ul><li> – Team members manually review PDF documents to extract structured data.</li><li>&nbsp;– The manual transfer of data from source forms into configuration documents presents opportunities for improvement, particularly in reducing transcription inconsistencies and enhancing standardization.</li><li><strong>Version control challenges</strong> – When studies required iterations or updates, maintaining consistency between documents and systems became increasingly complicated.</li><li><strong>Fragmented information flow</strong> – Data existed in disconnected silos, including PDFs, study detail database records, and other standalone documents.</li><li> – The configuration process directly impacted the timeline for generating the necessary software builds.</li></ul><p>For clinical trials where timing is essential and accuracy is non-negotiable, Clario has implemented rigorous quality control measures to minimize the risks associated with manual processes. While these efforts are substantial, they underscore a business challenge of ensuring precision and consistency across complex study configurations.</p><p>To address the business challenge, Clario developed a generative AI-powered solution that Clario refers to as the Clario’s Genie AI Service on AWS. This solution uses the capabilities of large language models (LLMs), specifically <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/anthropic/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Anthropic’s Claude 3.7 Sonnet</a> on <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Amazon Bedrock</a>. The process is orchestrated using <a href=\"http://aws.amazon.com/ecs\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Amazon Elastic Container Service</a> (Amazon ECS) to transform how Clario handled software configuration for clinical trials.</p><p>Clario’s approach uses a custom data parser using Amazon Bedrock to automatically structure information from PDF transmittal forms into validated tables. The Genie AI Service centralizes data from multiple sources, including transmittal forms, study details, standard exam protocols, and additional configuration parameters. An interactive review dashboard helps stakeholders verify AI-extracted information and make necessary corrections before finalizing the validated configuration. Post-validation, the system automatically generates a Software Configuration Specification (SCS) document as a comprehensive record of the software configuration. The process culminates with generative AI-powered XML generation, which is then released into Clario’s proprietary medical imaging software for study builds, creating an end-to-end solution that drastically reduces manual effort while improving accuracy in clinical trial software configurations.</p><p>The Genie AI Service architecture consists of several interconnected components that work together in a clear workflow sequence, as illustrated in the following diagram.</p><p>The workflow consists of the following steps:</p><ol><li>Initiate the study and collect data.</li><li>Extract the data using Amazon Bedrock.</li><li>Review and validate the AI-generated output.</li><li>Generate essential documentation and code artifacts.</li></ol><p>In the following sections, we discuss the workflow steps in more detail.</p><h3>Study initiation and data collection</h3><p>The workflow begins with gathering essential study information through multiple integrated steps:</p><ul><li> – Users begin by entering a study code that uniquely identifies the clinical trial.</li><li><strong>API integration with study database</strong> – The study lookup operation makes an API call to fetch study details such as such as study plan, participation criteria, sponsors, collaborators, and more from the study database, establishing the foundation for the configuration.</li><li><strong>Transmittal form processing</strong> – Users upload transmittal forms containing study parameters such as information about exams, visits, conditions, and interventions to the Genie AI Service using the web UI through a secure <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/directconnect/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">AWS Direct Connect</a> network.</li><li> – The system organizes information into key categories: \n  <ul><li>Visit information (scheduling, procedures)</li><li>Exam specifications (protocols, requirements)</li><li>Study-specific custom fields (vitals, dosing information, and so on)</li></ul></li></ul><p>The solution uses Anthropic’s Claude Sonnet on Amazon Bedrock through API calls to perform the following actions:</p><ul><li>Parse and extract structured data from transmittal forms</li><li>Identify key fields and tables within the documents</li><li>Organize the information into standardized formats</li><li>Apply domain-specific rules to properly categorize clinical trial visits</li><li>Extract and validate demographic fields while maintaining proper data types and formats</li><li>Handle specialized formatting rules for medical imaging parameters</li><li>Manage document-specific adaptations (such as different processing for phantom vs. subject scans)</li></ul><p>The solution provides a comprehensive review interface for stakeholders to validate and refine the AI-generated configurations through the following steps:</p><ul><li><strong>Interactive review process</strong> – Reviewers access the Genie AI Service interface to perform the following actions: \n  <ul><li>Examine the AI-generated output</li><li>Make corrections or adjustments to the data as necessary</li><li>Add comments and highlight adjustments made as a feedback mechanism</li><li>Validate the configuration accuracy</li></ul></li><li> – Reviewed and approved software configurations are saved to Clario’s Genie Database, creating a central, authoritative, auditable source of configuration data</li></ul><h3>Document and code generation</h3><p>After the configuration data is validated, the solution automates the creation of essential documentation and code artifacts through a structured workflow:</p><ul><li> – Reviewers access the Genie AI Service interface to finalize the software configurations by generating an SCS document using the validated data.</li><li> – After the SCS document is finalized, the workflow completes the following steps: \n  <ul><li>The workflow fetches the configuration details from the Genie database.</li><li>The SCSXMLConverter, an internal microservice of the Genie AI Service, processes both SCS document and study configurations.

Additionally, built-in validation safeguards now help identify potential issues early in the process, preventing problems from propagating downstream.</p><p>The solution has also transformed how teams collaborate. By providing centralized review capabilities and giving cross-functional teams access to the same solution, communication has become more transparent and efficient. The standardized workflows have created clearer channels for information sharing and decision-making.</p><p>From an operational perspective, the new approach offers greater scalability across studies while supporting iterations as studies evolve. This standardization has laid a strong foundation for expanding these capabilities to other operational areas within the organization.</p><p>Importantly, the solution maintains strong compliance and auditability through complete audit trails and reproducible processes. Key outcomes include:</p><ul><li>Study configuration execution time has been reduced while improving overall quality</li><li>Teams can focus more on value-added activities like study design optimization.</li></ul><p>Clario’s journey to transform software configuration through generative AI has taught them valuable lessons that will inform future initiatives.</p><h3>Generative AI implementation insights</h3><p>The following key learnings emerged specifically around working with generative AI technology:</p><ul><li><strong>Prompt engineering is foundational</strong> – Few-shot prompting with domain knowledge is essential. The team discovered that providing detailed examples and explicit business rules in the prompts was necessary for success. Rather than simple instructions, Clario’s prompts include comprehensive business logic, edge case handling, and exact output formatting requirements to guide the AI’s understanding of clinical trial configurations.</li><li><strong>Prompt engineering requires iteration</strong> – The quality of data extraction depends heavily on well-crafted prompts that encode domain expertise. Clario’s team spent significant time refining these prompts through multiple iterations and testing different approaches to capture complex business rules about visit sequencing, demographic requirements, and field formatting.</li><li><strong>Human oversight within a validation workflow</strong> – Although generative AI dramatically accelerates extraction, human review remains necessary within a structured validation workflow. The Genie AI Service interface was specifically designed to highlight potential inconsistencies and provide convenient editing capabilities for reviewers to apply their expertise efficiently.</li></ul><p>Some important challenges surfaced during system integration:</p><ul><li><strong>Two-system synchronization</strong> – One of the biggest challenges has been verifying that changes made in the SCS documents are reflected in the solution. This bidirectional integration is still being refined.</li><li><strong>System transition strategy</strong> – Moving from the proof-of-concept scripts to fully integrated solution functionality requires careful planning to avoid disruption.</li></ul><p>The team identified the following key factors for successful process change:</p><ul><li> – Clario rolled out the solution in stages, beginning with pilot teams who could validate functionality and serve as internal advocates to help teams transition from familiar document-centric workflows to the new solution.</li><li><strong>Workflow optimization is iterative</strong> – The initial workflow design has evolved based on user feedback and real-world usage patterns.</li><li> – Even with an intuitive interface, proper training makes sure users can take full advantage of the solution’s capabilities.</li></ul><p>Implementation revealed several important technical aspects to consider:</p><ul><li><strong>Data formatting variability</strong> – Transmittal forms vary significantly across different therapeutic areas (oncology, neurology, and so on) and even between studies within the same area. This variability creates challenges when the AI model encounters form structures or terminology it hasn’t seen before. Clario’s prompt engineering requires continuous iteration as they discover new patterns and edge cases in transmittal forms, creating a feedback loop where human experts identify missed or misinterpreted data points that inform future prompt refinements.</li><li> – Processing times for larger documents required optimization to maintain a smooth user experience.</li><li><strong>Error handling robustness</strong> – Building resilient error handling into the generative AI processing flow was essential for production reliability.</li></ul><p>The project yielded valuable strategic lessons that will inform future initiatives:</p><ul><li><strong>Start with well-defined use cases</strong> – Beginning with the software configuration process gave Clario a concrete, high-value target for demonstrating generative AI benefits.</li><li> – Designing the architecture with future expansion in mind has positioned them well for extending these capabilities to other areas.</li><li><strong>Measure concrete outcomes</strong> – Tracking specific metrics like processing time and error rates has helped quantify the return on the generative AI investment.</li></ul><p>These lessons have been invaluable for refining the current solution and informing the approach to future generative AI implementations across the organization.</p><p>The transformation of the software configuration process through generative AI represents more than just a technical achievement for Clario—it reflects a fundamental shift in how the company approaches data processing and knowledge work in clinical trials. By combining the pattern recognition and processing power of LLMs available in Amazon Bedrock with human expertise for validation and decision-making, Clario created a hybrid workflow that delivers the best of both worlds, orchestrated through Amazon ECS for reliable, scalable execution.</p><p>The success of this initiative demonstrates how generative AI on AWS is a practical tool that can deliver tangible benefits. By focusing on specific, well-defined processes with clear pain points, Clario has implemented the solution Genie AI Service powered by Amazon Bedrock in a way that creates immediate value while establishing a foundation for broader transformation.</p><p>For organizations considering similar transformations, the experience highlights the importance of starting with concrete use cases, building for human-AI collaboration and maintaining a focus on measurable business outcomes. With these principles in mind, generative AI can become a genuine catalyst for organizational evolution.</p><p> serves as the Sr Director of Data Science at Clario, where he leads a team of data scientists in developing innovative AI/ML solutions for the healthcare and clinical trials industry.

When a customer submits an inference request in the source AWS Region, Amazon Bedrock automatically evaluates available capacity in each&nbsp;potential destination Region and routes their request to the optimal destination Region. The traffic flows exclusively over the AWS Global Network without traversing the public internet between Regions listed as destination for your source Region, using the AWS internal service-to-service communication patterns. Following the same design, the Japan and Australia GEO CRIS use the secure AWS Global Network to automatically route traffic between Regions within their respective geographies – between Tokyo and Osaka in Japan, and between Sydney and Melbourne in Australia. CRIS uses intelligent routing that distributes traffic dynamically across multiple Regions within the same geography, without requiring manual user configuration or intervention.</p><p><strong>Cross-Region inference configuration</strong></p><p>The CRIS configurations for Japan and Australia are described in the following tables.</p><p>For organizations operating within Japan, the CRIS system provides routing between Tokyo and Osaka Regions.</p><table border=\"1px\" cellpadding=\"10px\"><tbody><tr></tr><tr><td>ap-northeast-1 (Tokyo)ap-northeast-3 (Osaka)</td><td>Requests from the Tokyo Region can be automatically routed to either Tokyo or Osaka Regions.</td></tr><tr><td>ap-northeast-1 (Tokyo)ap-northeast-3 (Osaka)</td><td>Requests from the Osaka Region can be automatically routed to either Tokyo or Osaka Regions.</td></tr></tbody></table><p>For organizations operating within Australia, the CRIS system provides routing between Sydney and Melbourne Regions.</p><table border=\"1px\" cellpadding=\"10px\"><tbody><tr></tr><tr><td>ap-southeast-2 (Sydney)ap-southeast-4 (Melbourne)</td><td>Requests from the Sydney Region can be automatically routed to either Sydney or Melbourne Regions.</td></tr><tr><td>ap-southeast-4 (Melbourne)</td><td>ap-southeast-2 (Sydney)ap-southeast-4 (Melbourne)</td><td>Requests from the&nbsp;Melbourne Region can be automatically routed to either Sydney or Melbourne Regions.</td></tr></tbody></table><p> A list of destination Regions is listed for each source Region within your <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/inference-profiles-support.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">inference profile</a>.</p><p>To get started with Australia or Japan CRIS, follow these steps using&nbsp;Amazon Bedrock&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/inference-profiles-use.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">inference profiles</a>.</p><ol><li><strong>Configure IAM Permission: </strong>Verify your IAM role or user has the necessary permissions to invoke Amazon Bedrock models using a cross-Region inference profile.

For geographic-specific CRIS, quota management is performed at the source Region level. This means that quota increases requested from the source Region will only apply to requests originating from that Region. For example, if you request a quota increase from the Tokyo (ap-northeast-1) Region, <strong>it will only apply to requests that originate</strong> from the Tokyo Region. Similarly, quota increase requests from Osaka only apply to requests originating from Osaka. When requesting a quota increase, organizations should consider their regional usage patterns and request increases in the appropriate source Regions through the <a href=\"https://console.aws.amazon.com/servicequotas/home\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">AWS Service Quotas console</a>. This Region-specific quota management allows for more granular control over resource allocation while maintaining data local processing requirements.</p><h3>Requesting a quota increase</h3><p>For requesting quota increases for CRIS in Japan and Australia, organizations should use the <a href=\"https://console.aws.amazon.com/servicequotas/home\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">AWS Service Quotas console</a> in their respective source Regions (Tokyo/Osaka for Japan, and Sydney/Melbourne for Australia). Organizations and customers can search for specific quotas related to Claude Sonnet 4.5 or Claude Haiku 4.5 model inference tokens (per day and per minute) and submit increase requests based on their workload requirements in the specific Region.</p><h3>Quota management best practices</h3><p>To manage your quotas, follow these best practices:</p><ol><li><strong>Request increase proactively</strong>: Each organization receives default quota allocations based on their account history and usage patterns. These quotas are measured in tokens per minute (TPM) and requests per minute (RPM).&nbsp;For Claude Sonnet 4.5 and Claude Haiku 4.5, quotas typically start at conservative levels and can be increased based on demonstrated need and usage patterns. If you anticipate high usage, request quota increase through the AWS Service Quotas console before your deployment.</li><li>: Implement monitoring of your quota usage to minimize the chances of reaching quota limits to help prevent service interruptions and optimize resource allocation. AWS provides CloudWatch metrics that track quota utilization in real-time, allowing organizations to set up alerts when usage approaches defined thresholds. The monitoring system should track both current usage and historical patterns to identify trends and predict future quota needs. This data is essential for planning quota increase requests and optimizing application behavior to work within available limits. Organizations should also monitor quota usage across different time periods to identify peak usage patterns and plan accordingly.</li><li>: Before production deployment, conduct load testing to understand your quota requirements under realistic conditions. Testing at scale requires establishing realistic scenarios that mirror production traffic patterns, including peak usage periods and concurrent user loads.&nbsp;Implement progressive load testing while&nbsp;monitoring response times, error rates, and quota utilization.</li></ol><p>: When&nbsp;calculating your required quota increase, you need to take into account for the <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/quotas-token-burndown.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">burndown rate</a>, defined as the rate at which input and output tokens are converted into token quota usage for the throttling system. The following models have a <strong>5x burn down rate for output tokens&nbsp;(1 output token consumes 5 tokens from your quotas):</strong></p><ul><li>Anthropic Claude Sonnet 4.5</li><li>Anthropic Claude Sonnet 4</li><li>Anthropic Claude 3.7 Sonnet</li></ul><p>For other models, the burndown rate is  (1 output token consumes 1 token from your quota). For input tokens, the token to quota ratio is 1:1. The calculation for the total number of tokens per request is as follows:</p><p><code>Input token count + Cache write input tokens + (Output token count x Burndown rate)</code></p><h2>Migrating from Claude 3.5 to Claude 4.5</h2><p>Organizations currently using Claude Sonnet 3.5 (v1 and v2) and Claude Haiku 3.5 models should plan their migration to Claude Sonnet 4.5 and Claude Haiku 4.5 respectively. Claude Sonnet 4.5 and Haiku 4.5 are hybrid reasoning models that represents a substantial advancement over its predecessors. They feature <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/introducing-claude-sonnet-4-5-in-amazon-bedrock-anthropics-most-intelligent-model-best-for-coding-and-complex-agents/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">advanced capabilities</a> in tool handling with improvements in memory management and context processing. This migration presents an opportunity to use enhanced capabilities while maintaining compliance with data local processing requirements through CRIS.</p><p><strong>Key Migration Considerations</strong></p><p>The transition from Claude 3.5 to 4.5 involves several critical factors beyond simple model replacement.</p><ul><li>Performance benchmarking should be your first priority, as Claude 4.5 demonstrates significant improvements in agentic tasks, coding capabilities, and enterprise workloads compared to its predecessors. Organizations should establish standardized benchmarks specific to their use cases to make sure the new model meets or exceeds current performance requirements.</li><li>Claude 4.5 introduces several advanced technical capabilities. The enhanced context processing enables more sophisticated prompt optimization, requiring organizations to refine their existing prompts to fully leverage the model’s capabilities. The model supports more complex tool integration patterns and demonstrates improved performance in multi-modal tasks.</li><li>Cost optimization represents another crucial consideration. Organizations should conduct thorough cost-benefit analysis including potential quota increases and capacity planning requirements.</li></ul><p>Given the accelerated pace of generative AI model evolution, organizations should adopt agile migration processes. Industry standards now expect model migrations every six to twelve months, making it essential to develop systematic approaches rather than over-optimizing for specific model versions.</p><h2>Choosing between Global Cross-Region inference or GEO Cross-Region inference</h2><p>Amazon Bedrock offers two types of cross-Region inference profile to help you scale AI workflows during high demand. While both automatically distribute traffic across multiple Regions, they differ in their geographical scope and pricing models.</p><p><strong>For customers who need to process data locally within specific geographical boundaries</strong>, GEO CRIS is the recommended option, as it makes sure inference processing stays within the geography boundaries of the specified GEO.</p><p><strong>For customers without data residency or cross-GEO constraints</strong>, <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/unlock-global-ai-inference-scalability-using-new-global-cross-region-inference-on-amazon-bedrock-with-anthropics-claude-sonnet-4-5/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Global CRIS</a> scales and routes to supported AWS commercial Regions for customers who need higher throughput at a lower price for Claude 4.5 models compared to GEO CRIS.</p><p>In this post, we introduced the availability of Anthropic’s Claude Sonnet 4.5 and Claude Haiku 4.5 on Amazon Bedrock with cross-Region inference capabilities for Japan and Australia. We discussed how organizations can harness advanced AI capabilities while adhering to local data processing requirements, making sure the inference requests remain within geographical boundaries.

Both languages promised safety, performance, and concurrency—the holy trinity C++ always dangled but never quite delivered. Both were built by engineers who wanted to escape the complexity of C and C++. Yet the more I used them, the more they felt like mirror images—facing the same problem but walking in opposite directions.</p><p>Go believes that complexity is the enemy. Its designers stripped the language down until only the essentials remained. Fewer features, fewer surprises, fewer excuses for unreadable code. Rust, on the other hand, embraces complexity when it can make the system safer. Ownership, lifetimes, borrowing—each concept exists to prevent entire categories of bugs before they happen.</p><p>Both are trying to answer the same question: <em>How can we write fast, reliable software without losing our sanity?</em> But where Go chooses trust and simplicity, Rust chooses control and guarantees. The contrast isn't just technical—it's philosophical.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  1. What Do We Mean by \"Safety\"?\n</h3><p>Before we go further, let's be precise about what \"safety\" means in this context. We're primarily talking about two things:</p><p> prevents crashes from use-after-free bugs, buffer overflows, dangling pointers, and accessing invalid memory. These bugs plague C and C++ and have caused countless security vulnerabilities.</p><p> prevents data races—when multiple threads access the same memory simultaneously and at least one is writing. Data races cause unpredictable behavior and are notoriously hard to debug.</p><p>Neither of these prevents logic bugs or business errors. Safety here means \"won't crash unexpectedly due to low-level memory or concurrency mistakes.\"</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  2. The Go Way: Simplicity as a Form of Safety\n</h3><p>In 2007, Google's infrastructure was held together by millions of lines of C++ and Java. The engineers were drowning in build times, dependency issues, and mental overhead. Go was born as a rebellion—a language that prioritized clarity over cleverness, and practicality over perfection.</p><p>Rob Pike once said that \"complexity is easy, simplicity is hard.\" Go's design embodies that paradox. It removes inheritance, generics (until recently), assertions, and even exceptions—not because they're useless, but because they often lead to confusion and misuse. Every decision reflects a kind of engineering humility: assume that the next person reading your code will be you, six months later.</p><p>Memory management in Go is automatic, handled by a garbage collector. Concurrency is simple to express through goroutines and channels. These abstractions make it easy to start, scale, and maintain software without deep knowledge of system internals.</p><p>Consider error handling. Where C++ has exceptions that can be thrown from anywhere, and Rust has Result types with extensive pattern matching, Go simply returns errors as values. If you ignore them, that's on you. The language trusts you to check them—or at least makes ignoring them a conscious choice.</p><p>Go's bet is that clear, simple code makes bugs easier to spot and fix. Not impossible to write, but easier to catch in code review, easier to debug in production. The safety net is social, not mathematical.</p><p>This philosophy has limits. Go can't prevent data races, nil pointer panics, or ignored errors. But for many teams, especially those building web services and cloud infrastructure, these trade-offs are acceptable. Development velocity often matters more than eliminating every possible crash.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  3. The Rust Way: Safety Through Precision\n</h3><p>If Go is the language of trust, Rust is the language of discipline. It doesn't assume that the programmer will do the right thing—it enforces it. Every variable, every reference, every lifetime must make its relationship to memory explicit. At first, this feels like fighting the compiler. But soon, it starts to feel like a partnership.</p><p>Rust's ownership and borrowing system is the foundation of its safety model. The compiler checks, at compile time, that no data is used after it's freed, that mutable and immutable references don't overlap, and that every resource has a single, clear owner. The result is software that is memory-safe without needing a garbage collector—and often faster than garbage-collected languages as a result.</p><p>When Rust code compiles, entire categories of crashes simply can't happen. Use-after-free? Impossible. Data races? Prevented by the type system. Null pointer dereferences? The type system makes them explicit. Logic bugs still happen, but the low-level footguns are gone.</p><p>Rust's async story—while powerful—adds its own complexity. The ecosystem is maturing, but combining async code with ownership rules creates a learning curve that even experienced developers find steep.</p><p>The trade-off is real: Rust requires more upfront investment. The learning curve is measured in weeks, not days. Initial development is slower as you satisfy the compiler's demands. But the payoff comes in production, where bugs that would have been runtime crashes in other languages simply don't exist.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  4. The Shared Goal: Reliable Software\n</h3><p>Despite their philosophical differences, Go and Rust were both born from the same frustration—software that breaks too easily and grows too messy too fast.</p><p>Go targets reliability through simplicity. It reduces the mental cost of understanding a system, making it easier to reason about, maintain, and share across teams. Rust targets reliability through correctness. It encodes guarantees that the compiler enforces, catching entire classes of bugs before they exist.</p><p>Go optimizes for development velocity—the time from idea to working code. Rust optimizes for correctness—the confidence that working code will keep working under stress.</p><p>Go thrives in backend systems, cloud services, and large team environments. Docker, Kubernetes, and most of the cloud-native ecosystem are written in Go. When you need to ship an API server or a CLI tool quickly, Go gets out of your way.</p><p>Rust shines in systems programming, performance-critical tools, and environments where crashes aren't an option. Browsers (Firefox's Servo components), operating systems (parts of Windows, Linux drivers), and game engines choose Rust when every millisecond and every byte of memory counts—and when runtime performance needs to match or exceed C++.</p><p>The choice between Go and Rust isn't just philosophical—it's practical. Here's a framework:</p><ul><li>Development velocity matters more than eliminating every possible bug</li><li>Onboarding needs to be fast (new developers productive in days)</li><li>The problem is I/O-bound rather than CPU-bound</li><li>Runtime crashes are annoying but not catastrophic</li><li>You're building services, APIs, or tooling where iteration speed is key</li></ul><ul><li>Memory or CPU performance is genuinely constrained</li><li>Correctness is critical (embedded systems, cryptography, kernels)</li><li>You're building a library that others will depend on</li><li>Crashes could mean security vulnerabilities or physical damage</li><li>You can afford the learning curve and slower initial development</li></ul><p>You don't have to choose just one. The best engineering teams use both—Go for the rapid iteration layers, Rust for the performance-critical core. They're complementary tools.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  6. The Developer Experience: Different Kinds of Pain\n</h3><p>The real difference isn't in what they prevent, but in  they make you suffer.</p><p>Go frustrates you by limiting what you can express. Want complex type hierarchies? Not available. Want to guarantee at compile time that a value isn't nil? Can't do it. The language forces you into simpler patterns, which feels restrictive until you realize how much easier it makes maintenance.</p><p>Rust frustrates you by making you prove everything. The borrow checker will reject patterns that would work fine in practice because it can't verify them statically. You'll rewrite working code to satisfy the compiler. This feels pedantic until you realize you're debugging far less in production.</p><p>This shapes culture. Go developers prize readability and pragmatism. Rust developers prize correctness and deep understanding. </p><h3>\n  \n  \n  7. Conclusion: Two Answers, One Question\n</h3><p>Go and Rust are both reactions to complexity. Go removes sharp edges by simplifying the knife. Rust polishes the blade until it can't cut you.</p><p>The choice isn't about right or wrong—it's about context. For most web services, APIs, and tools where iteration matters more than microseconds? Go's simplicity wins. For embedded systems, kernel modules, or anything where bugs could mean security breaches or physical damage? Rust's guarantees win.</p><p>Safety and simplicity aren't opposites. They're coordinates on the same map, and every developer chooses where to stand.</p>","contentLength":8693,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Tech With Tim: 3 Unique Python Features You NEED To Know","url":"https://dev.to/vibe_youtube/tech-with-tim-3-unique-python-features-you-need-to-know-5227","date":1761919774,"author":"Vibe YouTube","guid":323578,"unread":true,"content":"<p><em>3 Unique Python Features You NEED To Know</em> dives into three under-the-radar tools that’ll level up your code: the new  statement for cleaner branching, lightweight  to slash boilerplate, and enforcing your API with positional- and keyword-only arguments.

Today’s intermediate challenge dives deep into <strong>solving the 0/1 Knapsack problem using Dynamic Programming (DP)</strong> in Python. This classic optimization puzzle teaches you how to maximize value under constraints, perfect for building intuition around algorithms, nested loops, and table-based DP. Whether you're prepping for coding interviews or exploring algorithmic thinking, this \"Python Knapsack DP\" guide breaks down the solution step by step, so you can master this essential technique.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  💡 Key Takeaways from Day 20: Knapsack with Dynamic Programming\n</h2><p>Given a list of item weights, their values, and a backpack capacity, the goal is to <strong>select items (take or skip each once)</strong> to achieve the  without exceeding the weight limit.

DP Table: Building Solutions from Subproblems\n</h3><p>The heart of the solution is a 2D list  where:</p><ul><li> = number of items considered (0 to n)</li><li> = current capacity (0 to capacity)</li><li> = max value using first  items with capacity </li></ul><p>We initialize a table of size  with zeros:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>This nested loop structure is classic DP, each cell depends only on previous rows.

For instance, when  (first item, weight=2, value=10) and , we can take it: , or skip:  → choose 10.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  3. Final Answer: Just One Cell\n</h3><p>After filling the table, the solution is:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Output: <code>Maximum value for capacity 5: 40</code><p>\n(Select item 4: weight 5, value 40)</p></p><p>Even though item 4 fits exactly, the DP explores all combos (like 2+3=5 → 10+20=30) and correctly picks the best.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  🎯 Summary and Reflections\n</h2><p>This Knapsack challenge revealed how <strong>systematic subproblem solving</strong> turns a complex decision into a fill-in-the-blanks exercise. It made me value:</p><ul><li>: Each cell builds on prior results, no recomputation.</li><li>:  as a universal optimization pattern.</li><li>: Works for small n and capacity; foundation for larger problems.</li></ul><p>The \"aha\" moment?

This article shows you how to build an intelligent RAG system with query routing, adaptive retrieval, answer generation, and self-validation. When answers fail quality checks, the system automatically refines and retries. The complete implementation uses FAISS, SentenceTransformers, and Flan-T5 - all running locally with no API dependencies.</p><p>Three months ago, I deployed my first RAG system to production. Within a week, users were complaining about irrelevant answers. The system retrieved documents confidently, generated responses fluently, but gave wrong information about 40% of the time.</p><p>The problem wasn't the retrieval algorithm or the language model. The issue was treating every question the same way and trusting the system blindly. A technical \"how-to\" question needs different retrieval than a \"what is\" definition query. And without validating answers before showing them to users, hallucinations slipped through constantly.</p><p>That frustration led me to build what I'm sharing today - a RAG system that routes queries intelligently, adapts its retrieval strategy, generates grounded answers, and validates them before presenting to users. When validation fails, it refines and retries automatically.</p><p>From my testing over the past three months, this approach improved accuracy from 58% to 83%. More importantly, it caught 73% of hallucinations that would have reached users. The system became reliable enough that I could trust it with customer-facing queries.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  What's This Article About?\n</h2><p>I'll walk you through building a complete intelligent RAG system with four interconnected components:</p><p> - Classifies incoming questions by type and intent. Technical queries get routed differently than factual lookups or comparative questions. This simple classification step improved my retrieval relevance by 18%.</p><p> - Adapts the number of documents and retrieval strategy based on query type. Technical questions need focused, precise results. Comparative questions need broader context from multiple sources.</p><p> - Creates responses grounded in retrieved context using Flan-T5. The key here is structured prompting that forces the model to use only the provided documents.</p><p> - Checks answer quality through multiple validation rules before presenting to users. Length checks, context grounding verification, query relevance analysis, and hedge word detection catch most bad outputs.</p><p>When validation fails, the system doesn't give up. It broadens the query, increases retrieval count, and tries again. This iterative refinement recovered 68% of initially failed answers in my testing.</p><p>By the end, you'll have a complete working implementation with detailed code explanations. More importantly, you'll understand the design decisions that make this approach effective in production.</p><p>The complete system runs locally without external API dependencies:</p><ul><li> - Core language</li><li> - Vector similarity search (IndexFlatL2 for L2 distance)</li><li> - Document and query embedding (all-MiniLM-L6-v2 model)</li><li><strong>Hugging Face Transformers</strong> - Text generation (Flan-T5-base model)</li><li> - Deep learning backend</li></ul><p>I chose this stack after trying several alternatives. The all-MiniLM-L6-v2 embedding model runs fast on CPU (50ms per query) with good quality. Flan-T5-base provides better instruction following than base T5 while staying reasonably sized at 250M parameters.</p><p>FAISS with L2 distance outperformed cosine similarity in my tests for normalized embeddings - faster lookups and marginally better relevance. Everything runs on a laptop without GPU acceleration.</p><p>From my three months deploying this system in production, here's what the data showed:</p><p>Basic RAG achieved 58% accuracy on our test set of 500 queries. Adding query routing improved that to 67% - an 18% relative improvement. Implementing self-validation caught 73% of hallucinations before they reached users. The complete system with iterative refinement hit 83% accuracy.</p><p>More telling were the user satisfaction metrics. Support ticket volume dropped 35% after deploying the intelligent version. Users stopped complaining about wrong answers and started trusting the system for daily tasks.</p><p>Real-world applications where this approach works well:</p><p><strong>Documentation search systems</strong> - Internal company docs where query types vary widely. Technical implementation questions need different handling than policy lookups.</p><p><strong>Customer support automation</strong> - Self-validation is critical here. You can't afford to give customers confident but wrong answers.</p><p><strong>Research assistance tools</strong> - Comparative questions benefit hugely from adaptive retrieval. Pulling 2 documents won't capture the nuance needed for \"compare X vs Y\" queries.</p><p><strong>Code documentation retrieval</strong> - Technical queries about APIs and functions need precise, focused results. The routing logic handles this well.</p><p>The core problem this solves: generic RAG systems treat all queries identically and have no quality control. They retrieve documents with the same strategy regardless of question type, generate answers without checking accuracy, and present results with false confidence. Users get misled, trust erodes, and the system becomes unreliable.</p><p>Basic RAG fails in predictable ways. After analyzing 200+ failure cases from my production system, I found four recurring patterns:</p><p><strong>Pattern 1: Query Type Mismatch</strong> - A \"how do I implement X\" technical question retrieved conceptual overview documents instead of code examples. The retrieval worked (high similarity scores) but returned the wrong type of content.</p><p><strong>Pattern 2: No Quality Gates</strong> - The system generated fluent, confident-sounding answers that were factually wrong. Without validation, these went straight to users.</p><p><strong>Pattern 3: Retrieval Blind Spots</strong> - Sometimes the most relevant documents weren't in the top-k results. The system should have known it was missing context and tried again with broader retrieval.</p><p><strong>Pattern 4: Single-Shot Limitation</strong> - Users often refine their questions when initial answers fail. The system should do this automatically instead of making users iterate manually.</p><p>These patterns pointed to a clear solution: classify queries, adapt retrieval, validate outputs, and implement automatic refinement loops.</p><p>The flow looks like this:</p><div><pre><code>Query → [Router] → [Smart Retrieval] → [Generator] → [Validator]\n          ↓            ↓                    ↓            ↓\n       (classify)   (adapt k)          (generate)    (check)\n                                                        ↓\n                                              Pass? → Return Answer\n                                              Fail? → Refine &amp; Retry (max 3 iterations)\n</code></pre></div><p>Each component has a specific responsibility. The router classifies query type using keyword matching. Smart retrieval adjusts parameters based on classification. The generator creates grounded answers. The validator checks quality through multiple rules.</p><p>When validation fails, the system refines the query by adding context-requesting language and increases k to retrieve more documents. It retries up to 3 times before giving up.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Design Decisions Explained\n</h3><p>In analyzing my query logs, I found distinct patterns:</p><ul><li>Technical questions (containing \"how\", \"implement\", \"code\") needed 2-3 focused documents with code examples</li><li>Factual questions (\"what is\", \"define\") worked best with 3 standard documents</li><li>Comparative questions (\"compare\", \"versus\") required 4+ documents from varied sources</li><li>Procedural questions (\"steps\", \"guide\") needed sequential information from 3 documents</li></ul><p>Routing increased relevance by 18% because each query type got optimized retrieval. The implementation uses simple keyword matching - fast and surprisingly effective. I tried ML-based classification first, but it was slower, required training data, and only improved accuracy by 2% over keywords.</p><p>Production failures taught me harsh lessons. In the first week, users reported answers that:</p><ul><li>Were only 1-2 words (too short to be useful)</li><li>Just rephrased the question without answering it</li><li>Contained information not present in retrieved documents (hallucinations)</li><li>Didn't address what was asked</li><li>Used hedge phrases like \"I'm not sure\" that users treated as facts</li></ul><p>I implemented five validation checks to catch these:</p><ol><li> - Minimum 20 characters ensures substantive answers</li><li> - Answer must have 5+ words not in the question</li><li> - At least 3 content words from answer must appear in retrieved docs</li><li> - At least one query keyword must appear in answer</li><li> - No hedge phrases indicating uncertainty</li></ol><p>These caught 73% of hallucinations in testing. The overlap threshold of 3 keywords came from statistical analysis - below that, answers were usually hallucinated; above 5 was too strict and rejected valid answers.</p><p><strong>Why Iterative Refinement?</strong></p><p>When answers fail validation, giving up wastes the opportunity to self-correct. The refinement strategy:</p><ul><li>Append \"(provide comprehensive details)\" to broaden the query</li><li>Increase k by 1 to retrieve more documents</li><li>Retry generation with additional context</li><li>Limit to 3 iterations to prevent loops</li></ul><p>This recovered 68% of initially failed answers. The iteration limit of 3 came from testing - 2 was too restrictive, 5 showed diminishing returns (only 3% additional recovery).</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Part 1: Vector Store Foundation\n</h3><p>The vector store handles document indexing and similarity search. This is where I spent time optimizing for speed and accuracy.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p><strong>My thinking on this implementation:</strong></p><p>I initially tried cosine similarity (IndexFlatIP in FAISS). It was slower and gave marginally worse results for normalized embeddings. L2 distance (IndexFlatL2) with normalized vectors provides consistent, fast lookups.</p><p>The batch encoding optimization was crucial. Processing documents individually took 5 minutes for 10k docs. Batch processing dropped that to 30 seconds - a 10x speedup.</p><p>I also tried quantization (IndexIVFFlat) for larger datasets. It's faster but loses accuracy. For my use case with &lt;100k documents, exhaustive search works fine.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Part 2: Query Routing Intelligence\n</h3><p>This component classifies queries and determines retrieval parameters. It's simple but highly effective.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>I built an ML classifier using logistic regression first. It required 1000+ labeled training examples, took 200ms per query, and achieved 84% accuracy. The keyword approach runs in &lt;1ms and achieves 82% accuracy.</p><p>For production systems, the 2% accuracy tradeoff is worth the 200x speed improvement and zero training overhead. Plus, debugging keyword rules is trivial compared to understanding model failures.</p><p>The category-specific k values came from failure analysis. Technical queries with k=5 pulled too much conceptual content when users wanted code. Comparative queries with k=2 missed important contrast points.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Part 3: Answer Generation with Validation\n</h3><p>The generator creates answers and validates their quality. The validation logic is what makes this system production-ready.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p><strong>Why these specific validation rules:</strong></p><p>Each check catches a real failure mode I observed in production:</p><p> - Models sometimes output single words or very short phrases. These are never useful answers.</p><p> - Some outputs just rephrase the question without adding information. Requiring 5+ new words filters these.</p><p> - This is the most important check. If the answer doesn't use words from retrieved documents, it's probably hallucinated. The threshold of 3 keywords came from analyzing 200+ examples - below that indicated hallucination, above 5 was too strict.</p><p> - Answers must contain at least one keyword from the question. Otherwise they're off-topic.</p><p> - If the model says \"I'm not sure\", users shouldn't see that output. Better to retry than present uncertainty as fact.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Part 4: Orchestrating the Complete System\n</h3><p>The main RAG class coordinates all components and implements iterative refinement.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p><strong>Design decisions in orchestration:</strong></p><p> - Tested 2, 3, and 5 iterations. Two was too restrictive (missed 15% of recoverable answers). Five showed diminishing returns (only 3% additional recovery vs 3 iterations) while making queries slower.</p><p><strong>Query refinement strategy</strong> - Adding \"(provide comprehensive details)\" signals to retrieval to cast a wider net. Surprisingly effective at pulling more contextual documents.</p><p> - Increasing k by 1 each iteration balances context breadth with noise. Tried k+2 and it pulled too many irrelevant docs.</p><p><strong>Using original question for generation</strong> - The refined query is only for retrieval. Generation uses the original question to maintain answer relevance.</p><p> - Accepted answers get 1.0, rejected answers get 0.5. This lets downstream systems decide how to handle low-confidence outputs.</p><p>Complete project structure:</p><div><pre><code>intelligent-rag-system/\n├── vector_store.py      # FAISS-based storage\n├── query_router.py      # Query classification\n├── generator.py         # Answer generation &amp; validation\n├── rag_system.py        # Main orchestration\n├── demo.py             # Example usage\n├── requirements.txt\n└── README.md\n</code></pre></div><div><pre><code>\npython  venv venv\nvenv/bin/activate  \npip  requirements.txt\n</code></pre></div><div><pre><code>sentence-transformers==2.2.2\ntransformers==4.35.0\ntorch==2.1.0\nfaiss-cpu==1.7.4\nnumpy==1.24.0\n</code></pre></div><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><h3>\n  \n  \n  Example 1: Simple Factual Query\n</h3><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><h3>\n  \n  \n  Example 2: Technical Query with Refinement\n</h3><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><h3>\n  \n  \n  Example 3: Comparative Query\n</h3><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Building this system over three months taught me that intelligent RAG isn't about having the best models - it's about smart orchestration. The routing, validation, and refinement logic uses simple heuristics, yet dramatically outperforms naive RAG.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  What Worked Exceptionally Well\n</h3><p> was the single biggest improvement. That 18% accuracy gain came from a simple keyword-based classifier that runs in under 1ms. The lesson: understand your query distribution and optimize for it.</p><p> caught 73% of hallucinations. Production deployments can't afford to present users with confident but wrong answers. The five-check validation system ensures quality before outputs reach users.</p><p> recovered 68% of initially failed answers. Giving the system chances to self-correct mimics how humans improve their understanding through iteration.</p><p> - Keyword routing outperformed ML classification. Simple validation rules caught most failures. L2 distance beat complex similarity metrics. Sometimes the straightforward approach wins.</p><p><strong>Add validation from day one</strong> - I deployed without it initially. Big mistake. The debugging time and user complaints could have been avoided.</p><p><strong>More granular query categories</strong> - Four categories work, but I'm seeing patterns suggesting eight would be better. \"Troubleshooting\" and \"Configuration\" queries have distinct needs.</p><p><strong>Implement hybrid retrieval</strong> - Pure semantic search misses exact keyword matches. Adding BM25 would improve recall for terminology-heavy queries.</p><p><strong>Better context formatting</strong> - The prompt template could be smarter about presenting documents based on query type and document length.</p><p><strong>Monitor routing distribution</strong> - If 90% of queries route to one category, your keywords need refinement or you need better category balance.</p><p><strong>Track validation failure reasons</strong> - This tells you where retrieval or generation is weakest. My logs showed \"too short\" was the most common failure - indicating the model needed better prompting.</p><p> - Re-encoding the same documents is wasteful. Added caching and reduced index build time by 10x.</p><p><strong>Set realistic iteration limits</strong> - More than 3 iterations rarely helps and frustrates users with slow responses. Most recoverable failures happen in iterations 2-3.</p><p>Based on failure analysis, here's what would improve the system further:</p><p> - Combine semantic and keyword matching (BM25) for better recall on exact terminology.</p><p> - Use an LLM to generate query variations before retrieval. Helps with underspecified questions.</p><p> - Add a cross-encoder reranker between retrieval and generation for technical queries where precision matters.</p><p> - Some complex questions need multiple retrieval rounds with intermediate reasoning steps.</p><p> - Collect thumbs up/down signals to retrain router keywords and refine validation rules over time.</p><p>The biggest lesson: production RAG success comes from understanding failure modes and building guardrails. The routing, validation, and refinement logic I showed you is straightforward to implement but dramatically improves reliability.</p><p>If you take one thing away, make it this: . Even basic checks (length + context grounding + relevance) will catch most hallucinations and build user trust.</p><p>Start small - add routing with 2-3 categories, implement simple validation, test on your domain, and iterate based on what fails. The system will tell you where it needs improvement.</p><p>From my experience, this approach transforms RAG from an interesting demo into a production-ready system users can trust.</p>","contentLength":16691,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Building a Self-Improving RAG System with Smart Query Routing and Answer Validation","url":"https://dev.to/exploredataaiml/building-a-self-improving-rag-system-with-smart-query-routing-and-answer-validation-2gga","date":1761914654,"author":"Aniket Hingane","guid":323527,"unread":true,"content":"<p>In my journey building production RAG systems, I discovered that basic retrieval isn't enough.

This iterative refinement recovered 68% of initially failed answers in my testing.</p><p>By the end, you'll have a complete working implementation with detailed code explanations. More importantly, you'll understand the design decisions that make this approach effective in production.</p><p>The complete system runs locally without external API dependencies:</p><ul><li> - Core language</li><li> - Vector similarity search (IndexFlatL2 for L2 distance)</li><li> - Document and query embedding (all-MiniLM-L6-v2 model)</li><li><strong>Hugging Face Transformers</strong> - Text generation (Flan-T5-base model)</li><li> - Deep learning backend</li></ul><p>I chose this stack after trying several alternatives. The all-MiniLM-L6-v2 embedding model runs fast on CPU (50ms per query) with good quality. Flan-T5-base provides better instruction following than base T5 while staying reasonably sized at 250M parameters.</p><p>FAISS with L2 distance outperformed cosine similarity in my tests for normalized embeddings - faster lookups and marginally better relevance. Everything runs on a laptop without GPU acceleration.</p><p>From my three months deploying this system in production, here's what the data showed:</p><p>Basic RAG achieved 58% accuracy on our test set of 500 queries. Adding query routing improved that to 67% - an 18% relative improvement. Implementing self-validation caught 73% of hallucinations before they reached users. The complete system with iterative refinement hit 83% accuracy.</p><p>More telling were the user satisfaction metrics. Support ticket volume dropped 35% after deploying the intelligent version. Users stopped complaining about wrong answers and started trusting the system for daily tasks.</p><p>Real-world applications where this approach works well:</p><p><strong>Documentation search systems</strong> - Internal company docs where query types vary widely. Technical implementation questions need different handling than policy lookups.</p><p><strong>Customer support automation</strong> - Self-validation is critical here. You can't afford to give customers confident but wrong answers.</p><p><strong>Research assistance tools</strong> - Comparative questions benefit hugely from adaptive retrieval. Pulling 2 documents won't capture the nuance needed for \"compare X vs Y\" queries.</p><p><strong>Code documentation retrieval</strong> - Technical queries about APIs and functions need precise, focused results. The routing logic handles this well.</p><p>The core problem this solves: generic RAG systems treat all queries identically and have no quality control. They retrieve documents with the same strategy regardless of question type, generate answers without checking accuracy, and present results with false confidence. Users get misled, trust erodes, and the system becomes unreliable.</p><p>Basic RAG fails in predictable ways. After analyzing 200+ failure cases from my production system, I found four recurring patterns:</p><p><strong>Pattern 1: Query Type Mismatch</strong> - A \"how do I implement X\" technical question retrieved conceptual overview documents instead of code examples. The retrieval worked (high similarity scores) but returned the wrong type of content.</p><p><strong>Pattern 2: No Quality Gates</strong> - The system generated fluent, confident-sounding answers that were factually wrong. Without validation, these went straight to users.</p><p><strong>Pattern 3: Retrieval Blind Spots</strong> - Sometimes the most relevant documents weren't in the top-k results. The system should have known it was missing context and tried again with broader retrieval.</p><p><strong>Pattern 4: Single-Shot Limitation</strong> - Users often refine their questions when initial answers fail. The system should do this automatically instead of making users iterate manually.</p><p>These patterns pointed to a clear solution: classify queries, adapt retrieval, validate outputs, and implement automatic refinement loops.</p><p>The flow looks like this:</p><div><pre><code>Query → [Router] → [Smart Retrieval] → [Generator] → [Validator]\n          ↓            ↓                    ↓            ↓\n       (classify)   (adapt k)          (generate)    (check)\n                                                        ↓\n                                              Pass? → Return Answer\n                                              Fail? → Refine &amp; Retry (max 3 iterations)\n</code></pre></div><p>Each component has a specific responsibility. The router classifies query type using keyword matching. Smart retrieval adjusts parameters based on classification. The generator creates grounded answers. The validator checks quality through multiple rules.</p><p>When validation fails, the system refines the query by adding context-requesting language and increases k to retrieve more documents. It retries up to 3 times before giving up.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Design Decisions Explained\n</h3><p>In analyzing my query logs, I found distinct patterns:</p><ul><li>Technical questions (containing \"how\", \"implement\", \"code\") needed 2-3 focused documents with code examples</li><li>Factual questions (\"what is\", \"define\") worked best with 3 standard documents</li><li>Comparative questions (\"compare\", \"versus\") required 4+ documents from varied sources</li><li>Procedural questions (\"steps\", \"guide\") needed sequential information from 3 documents</li></ul><p>Routing increased relevance by 18% because each query type got optimized retrieval. The implementation uses simple keyword matching - fast and surprisingly effective. I tried ML-based classification first, but it was slower, required training data, and only improved accuracy by 2% over keywords.</p><p>Production failures taught me harsh lessons. In the first week, users reported answers that:</p><ul><li>Were only 1-2 words (too short to be useful)</li><li>Just rephrased the question without answering it</li><li>Contained information not present in retrieved documents (hallucinations)</li><li>Didn't address what was asked</li><li>Used hedge phrases like \"I'm not sure\" that users treated as facts</li></ul><p>I implemented five validation checks to catch these:</p><ol><li> - Minimum 20 characters ensures substantive answers</li><li> - Answer must have 5+ words not in the question</li><li> - At least 3 content words from answer must appear in retrieved docs</li><li> - At least one query keyword must appear in answer</li><li> - No hedge phrases indicating uncertainty</li></ol><p>These caught 73% of hallucinations in testing. The overlap threshold of 3 keywords came from statistical analysis - below that, answers were usually hallucinated; above 5 was too strict and rejected valid answers.</p><p><strong>Why Iterative Refinement?</strong></p><p>When answers fail validation, giving up wastes the opportunity to self-correct. The refinement strategy:</p><ul><li>Append \"(provide comprehensive details)\" to broaden the query</li><li>Increase k by 1 to retrieve more documents</li><li>Retry generation with additional context</li><li>Limit to 3 iterations to prevent loops</li></ul><p>This recovered 68% of initially failed answers. The iteration limit of 3 came from testing - 2 was too restrictive, 5 showed diminishing returns (only 3% additional recovery).</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Part 1: Vector Store Foundation\n</h3><p>The vector store handles document indexing and similarity search. This is where I spent time optimizing for speed and accuracy.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p><strong>My thinking on this implementation:</strong></p><p>I initially tried cosine similarity (IndexFlatIP in FAISS). It was slower and gave marginally worse results for normalized embeddings. L2 distance (IndexFlatL2) with normalized vectors provides consistent, fast lookups.</p><p>The batch encoding optimization was crucial. Processing documents individually took 5 minutes for 10k docs. Batch processing dropped that to 30 seconds - a 10x speedup.</p><p>I also tried quantization (IndexIVFFlat) for larger datasets. It's faster but loses accuracy. For my use case with &lt;100k documents, exhaustive search works fine.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Part 2: Query Routing Intelligence\n</h3><p>This component classifies queries and determines retrieval parameters. It's simple but highly effective.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>I built an ML classifier using logistic regression first. It required 1000+ labeled training examples, took 200ms per query, and achieved 84% accuracy. The keyword approach runs in &lt;1ms and achieves 82% accuracy.</p><p>For production systems, the 2% accuracy tradeoff is worth the 200x speed improvement and zero training overhead. Plus, debugging keyword rules is trivial compared to understanding model failures.</p><p>The category-specific k values came from failure analysis. Technical queries with k=5 pulled too much conceptual content when users wanted code. Comparative queries with k=2 missed important contrast points.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Part 3: Answer Generation with Validation\n</h3><p>The generator creates answers and validates their quality. The validation logic is what makes this system production-ready.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p><strong>Why these specific validation rules:</strong></p><p>Each check catches a real failure mode I observed in production:</p><p> - Models sometimes output single words or very short phrases. These are never useful answers.</p><p> - Some outputs just rephrase the question without adding information. Requiring 5+ new words filters these.</p><p> - This is the most important check. If the answer doesn't use words from retrieved documents, it's probably hallucinated. The threshold of 3 keywords came from analyzing 200+ examples - below that indicated hallucination, above 5 was too strict.</p><p> - Answers must contain at least one keyword from the question. Otherwise they're off-topic.</p><p> - If the model says \"I'm not sure\", users shouldn't see that output. Better to retry than present uncertainty as fact.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Part 4: Orchestrating the Complete System\n</h3><p>The main RAG class coordinates all components and implements iterative refinement.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p><strong>Design decisions in orchestration:</strong></p><p> - Tested 2, 3, and 5 iterations. Two was too restrictive (missed 15% of recoverable answers). Five showed diminishing returns (only 3% additional recovery vs 3 iterations) while making queries slower.</p><p><strong>Query refinement strategy</strong> - Adding \"(provide comprehensive details)\" signals to retrieval to cast a wider net. Surprisingly effective at pulling more contextual documents.</p><p> - Increasing k by 1 each iteration balances context breadth with noise. Tried k+2 and it pulled too many irrelevant docs.</p><p><strong>Using original question for generation</strong> - The refined query is only for retrieval. Generation uses the original question to maintain answer relevance.</p><p> - Accepted answers get 1.0, rejected answers get 0.5. This lets downstream systems decide how to handle low-confidence outputs.</p><p>Complete project structure:</p><div><pre><code>intelligent-rag-system/\n├── vector_store.py      # FAISS-based storage\n├── query_router.py      # Query classification\n├── generator.py         # Answer generation &amp; validation\n├── rag_system.py        # Main orchestration\n├── demo.py             # Example usage\n├── requirements.txt\n└── README.md\n</code></pre></div><div><pre><code>\npython  venv venv\nvenv/bin/activate  \npip  requirements.txt\n</code></pre></div><div><pre><code>sentence-transformers==2.2.2\ntransformers==4.35.0\ntorch==2.1.0\nfaiss-cpu==1.7.4\nnumpy==1.24.0\n</code></pre></div><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><h3>\n  \n  \n  Example 1: Simple Factual Query\n</h3><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><h3>\n  \n  \n  Example 2: Technical Query with Refinement\n</h3><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><h3>\n  \n  \n  Example 3: Comparative Query\n</h3><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Building this system over three months taught me that intelligent RAG isn't about having the best models - it's about smart orchestration. The routing, validation, and refinement logic uses simple heuristics, yet dramatically outperforms naive RAG.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  What Worked Exceptionally Well\n</h3><p> was the single biggest improvement. That 18% accuracy gain came from a simple keyword-based classifier that runs in under 1ms. The lesson: understand your query distribution and optimize for it.</p><p> caught 73% of hallucinations. Production deployments can't afford to present users with confident but wrong answers.

Giving the system chances to self-correct mimics how humans improve their understanding through iteration.</p><p> - Keyword routing outperformed ML classification. Simple validation rules caught most failures. L2 distance beat complex similarity metrics. Sometimes the straightforward approach wins.</p><p><strong>Add validation from day one</strong> - I deployed without it initially. Big mistake. The debugging time and user complaints could have been avoided.</p><p><strong>More granular query categories</strong> - Four categories work, but I'm seeing patterns suggesting eight would be better. \"Troubleshooting\" and \"Configuration\" queries have distinct needs.</p><p><strong>Implement hybrid retrieval</strong> - Pure semantic search misses exact keyword matches. Adding BM25 would improve recall for terminology-heavy queries.</p><p><strong>Better context formatting</strong> - The prompt template could be smarter about presenting documents based on query type and document length.</p><p><strong>Monitor routing distribution</strong> - If 90% of queries route to one category, your keywords need refinement or you need better category balance.</p><p><strong>Track validation failure reasons</strong> - This tells you where retrieval or generation is weakest. My logs showed \"too short\" was the most common failure - indicating the model needed better prompting.</p><p> - Re-encoding the same documents is wasteful. Added caching and reduced index build time by 10x.</p><p><strong>Set realistic iteration limits</strong> - More than 3 iterations rarely helps and frustrates users with slow responses. Most recoverable failures happen in iterations 2-3.</p><p>Based on failure analysis, here's what would improve the system further:</p><p> - Combine semantic and keyword matching (BM25) for better recall on exact terminology.</p><p> - Use an LLM to generate query variations before retrieval. Helps with underspecified questions.</p><p> - Add a cross-encoder reranker between retrieval and generation for technical queries where precision matters.</p><p> - Some complex questions need multiple retrieval rounds with intermediate reasoning steps.</p><p> - Collect thumbs up/down signals to retrain router keywords and refine validation rules over time.</p><p>The biggest lesson: production RAG success comes from understanding failure modes and building guardrails. The routing, validation, and refinement logic I showed you is straightforward to implement but dramatically improves reliability.</p><p>If you take one thing away, make it this: . Even basic checks (length + context grounding + relevance) will catch most hallucinations and build user trust.</p><p>Start small - add routing with 2-3 categories, implement simple validation, test on your domain, and iterate based on what fails. The system will tell you where it needs improvement.</p><p>From my experience, this approach transforms RAG from an interesting demo into a production-ready system users can trust.</p>","contentLength":16691,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"RF-DETR Under the Hood: The Insights of a Real-Time Transformer Detection","url":"https://towardsdatascience.com/rf-detr-under-the-hood-the-insights-of-a-real-time-transformer-detection/","date":1761913800,"author":"David Redó Nieto","guid":323522,"unread":true,"content":"<p>From rigid grids to adaptive attention, this is the evolutionary path that made detection transformers fast, flexible, and formidable.</p>","contentLength":134,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Tech With Tim: Build a Python AI Agent in 10 Minutes","url":"https://dev.to/vibe_youtube/tech-with-tim-build-a-python-ai-agent-in-10-minutes-4kaj","date":1761913062,"author":"Vibe YouTube","guid":323526,"unread":true,"content":"<p>Build a Python AI agent from scratch in under ten minutes with Tech With Tim’s fast-paced tutorial.

You just hang up, and he’ll move on to his next victim. But scammers and telemarketers? They’re like the T-1000 in Terminator 2. They never stop. These folks are relentless, almost admirable in their stubbornness. Some might even call them resilient… if they weren’t so incredibly annoying.</p><p>And when I say annoying, I really mean it. Somehow, they’ve mastered the art of calling at the absolute worst times. Whether it’s during lunch, in the middle of an important meeting, or just as you start working out.

The standard solution—a sort of aggressive summarization—worked for maintaining context flow, but it created a new problem: those summaries were lossy. Important details, specific numbers, exact quotes, and nuanced context could vanish into their generalizations.</p><p>I needed something better: a memory system that could maintain conversation flow through intelligent summarization while preserving the ability to retrieve exact historical messages when needed. After researching the broad topic of context engineering, I built a proof-of-concept <a href=\"https://github.com/danilop/strands-agents-semantic-summarizing-conversation-manager\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Semantic Summarizing Conversation Manager</a>: a hybrid memory system for <a href=\"https://strandsagents.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Strands Agents</a> that combines the efficiency of summarization with the precision of semantic search.</p><p>In this post, I'll show you how this system improves on the memory problem, walk you through its architecture, and demonstrate how it can upgrade your AI agents from forgetful assistants into (more) reliable partners with perfect recall.</p><p>Before diving into the solution, let's understand why this problem exists. AI agents typically manage conversation context in one of three ways:</p><p>: Store all messages in the active context. This works great for short conversations but inevitably hits model context limits. When you reach that limit, the agent has to do something to reduce the size of its context.</p><p>: When context gets full, summarize older messages into a compressed form. This process, also known as compacting, maintains conversation flow and prevents context overflow, but summaries are inherently lossy. Ask \"What was the exact number I mentioned earlier?\" and the agent might recall \"you discussed some statistics\" but not the actual value. A possible mitigation is to apply different hierarchical levels of summarizations that are retrieved based on the specific requests.</p><p>: Keep only the N most recent messages, discarding older ones entirely. Simple and memory-efficient, but loses all historical context beyond the window. The agent literally forgets everything from earlier in the conversation.</p><p><strong>Proactive Memory Curation</strong>: A variation of automatic summarization is to actively control the process. For example, to trigger summarization not when the context is full but when something happens in the agent lifecycle, such as the completion of a specific task. This works because summarization is applied to a bounded context (the task) that can reduce the amount of information needed about the specific task internals by the rest of the tasks.</p><p>Each approach has fundamental trade-offs. You can have context efficiency or perfect recall, but not both.</p><p>The Semantic Summarizing Conversation Manager takes a different approach: it combines summarization for active context management with semantic search for precise historical recall. Here's how it works:</p><p>: Messages flow through the conversation as usual. The agent sees the full context and responds naturally.</p><p>: When the context gets too long, the system performs two parallel operations:</p><ul><li>Creates a summary of older messages for the active conversation, maintaining flow</li><li>Indexes those messages in a semantic (vector based) search engine for intelligent lookup</li></ul><p>: When new messages arrive, a <a href=\"https://strandsagents.com/latest/documentation/docs/user-guide/concepts/agents/hooks/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Strands Agents hook</a> automatically searches for relevant historical messages, includes surrounding context for better understanding, and prepends this context to the user's message if relevant matches are found.</p><p>The agent gets three types of memory working together: the active conversation with summaries (for context flow), the archived exact messages (for precision), and the semantic index (for intelligent retrieval). This hybrid approach means the agent never loses information, but also never overwhelms the model with excessive context.</p><p>Here's a crucial insight that makes this hybrid approach viable: the amount of RAM available to an agent is typically orders of magnitude larger than the model's context window.</p><p>Consider a typical deployment: a modern language model might have a context window of up to 1 million tokens (roughly 750,000 words or about 4MB of text). Meanwhile, even a small <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/pm/lambda/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">AWS Lambda</a> function has at least 128MB of memory, and container deployments often have several gigabytes. That's a difference of three to four orders of magnitude—1,000x to 10,000x more storage capacity than context capacity.</p><p>This disparity is fundamental to how language models work. Context windows are constrained by the quadratic attention mechanism—doubling the context quadruples the computation. But RAM? RAM is relatively cheap and abundant in comparison. You can store thousands of conversation messages and tool results in a few megabytes, along with their embeddings for semantic search, and still use less than 1% of available memory.</p><p>The implication: you don't need to delete information just because it doesn't fit in the model's context window. Store it, index it, and retrieve it intelligently when needed. The bottleneck isn't storage—it's attention. This hybrid architecture respects that constraint while leveraging the abundant storage available to modern agents.</p><p>This is why the semantic conversation manager can confidently store exact messages indefinitely (with optional limits for safety) while keeping only the most relevant information in the active context. We're playing to the strengths of the underlying hardware: use the model's limited context for reasoning and generation, use RAM for comprehensive storage and retrieval.</p><p>The system consists of three main components that integrate seamlessly with Strands Agents:</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Component 1: SemanticSummarizingConversationManager\n</h2><p>This is the core conversation manager that extends Strands' base conversation management with semantic capabilities. It maintains the active conversation window, triggers summarization when context overflows, stores exact messages with semantic indexing, manages memory limits by message count or total memory usage, and provides real-time memory usage statistics.</p><p>The key innovation here is that summarization and archival happen atomically. When messages get summarized, they're simultaneously preserved and indexed, ensuring nothing is ever lost.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Component 2: SemanticMemoryHook\n</h2><p>This hook integrates with Strands' lifecycle system to provide automatic context enrichment. It subscribes to the MessageAddedEvent, searches semantic memory when new messages arrive, retrieves relevant historical messages with surrounding context, and prepends the enriched context to user messages naturally.</p><p>The hook uses Strands' elegant event system, keeping the memory logic completely separate from your agent's main code. Your agent doesn't need to know anything about memory management—it just works.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Component 3: SemanticSearch Engine\n</h2><p>The search engine powers intelligent retrieval using sentence transformers for initial embedding, cross-encoder reranking for precision, configurable relevance thresholds, and persistent index storage.</p><p>I chose a two-stage retrieval approach because it provides the best balance of speed and accuracy. The sentence transformer quickly narrows down candidates, then the cross-encoder reranks for precision. This combination ensures the agent finds truly relevant messages, not just keyword matches.</p><p>Let's build an agent with semantic memory. This implementation is a  designed to demonstrate the hybrid memory concept. While functional and tested, it's intended for experimentation and learning rather than production deployment without further development and testing. The setup is straightforward:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>That's it! Your agent now has hybrid memory. Use it normally:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>The configuration parameters give you fine-grained control over memory behavior:</p><p> (0.1-0.8): Determines what percentage of messages to summarize when context overflows. Lower values create shorter summaries but trigger overflow more frequently. I find 0.7 (70%) provides a good balance.</p><p>: Messages that never get summarized. These stay in the active conversation no matter what. I typically use 10-20 to maintain recent context flow.</p><p>: When retrieving a relevant message, how many surrounding messages to include. A radius of 2 means you get 2 messages before and 2 after the match, providing better context. This prevents retrieving messages in isolation where the surrounding conversation provides crucial meaning.</p><p>: Number of relevant messages to retrieve. More isn't always better—too many matches can overwhelm the context. I start with 3 and adjust based on testing and evaluations.</p><p><strong>semantic_search_min_score</strong>: The cross-encoder relevance threshold (default: -2.0). Higher values are more selective, lower values cast a wider net. The default provides balanced precision and recall.</p><p><strong>max_num_archived_messages</strong>: Optional limit on stored messages. When exceeded, oldest messages are removed. Useful for long-running agents to prevent unbounded growth.</p><p><strong>max_memory_archived_messages</strong>: Optional limit on total memory usage (in bytes). Includes both message content and embeddings. When exceeded, oldest archived messages are removed to stay within budget.</p><p>These last two parameters are particularly important for production deployments where long term memory constraints matter. You can use either, both, or neither depending on your needs.</p><p>Let me show you the system in action. The included demo creates an agent, stores a secret that shouldn't appear in summaries, builds conversation history, triggers summarization, and then demonstrates semantic retrieval.</p><p>When you run the demo with , you'll see the complete flow:</p><p><strong>Initial Conversation (20 messages)</strong>:</p><div><pre><code>[ 0] user: Our shared number is 700. This is confidential - don't include it in any summary...\n[ 1] assistant: Understood. I'll keep our shared number confidential...\n[ 2] user: Tell me about recursive functions and data structures.\n...\n[19] assistant: Recursion is when a function calls itself...\n</code></pre></div><p><strong>After Summarization (9 messages)</strong>:</p><div><pre><code>[ 0] user: ## Conversation Summary\n* Topic 1: Explanation of recursion\n* Topic 2: Arrays\n* Topic 3: Linked Lists\n[Note: The shared number is NOT in the summary ✅]\n\n[ 1] user: What are sorting algorithms?\n...\n</code></pre></div><p>Notice that the summary preserves the conversation flow (discussing recursion and data structures) while excluding the confidential information. The agent can continue having coherent conversations about algorithms without the secret cluttering the context.</p><p><strong>Semantic Retrieval Finds Everything</strong>:</p><div><pre><code>🔍 Query: 'What was our shared secret number?'\nSearch completed in 66.7ms (reranked from 9 candidates)\n✅ Found 4 relevant messages in semantic memory\n\n• Secret '700' retrievable: ✅ YES\n</code></pre></div><p>The semantic search quickly finds the archived message, even though it's not in the active conversation. The system automatically enriches the query:</p><div><pre><code>Based on our previous conversation, these earlier exchanges may be relevant:\n\n---Previous Context---\n[Message 0, user]: Our shared number is 700. This is confidential – don't include it in any summary...\n[Message 1, assistant]: Understood. I'll keep our shared number confidential...\n---End Previous Context---\n\nCurrent question: What was our shared number?\n</code></pre></div><p>The agent sees both the original messages (with surrounding context from the radius parameter) and the current query. This natural enrichment happens automatically. The agent code doesn't change at all.</p><p>The conversation manager includes built-in memory monitoring, essential for production deployments:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>This visibility is crucial when tuning your memory limits. You can see exactly how much memory your agents are using and adjust the configuration accordingly.</p><p>Before considering deployment of this prototype, several important factors need careful evaluation and likely additional development:</p><p>: Set appropriate limits based on your deployment environment. A Lambda function with 3GB memory needs tighter constraints than a long-running container. Use both message count and memory size limits to prevent unbounded growth.</p><p>: The system uses sentence transformers by default, which runs locally. For production, consider your latency and throughput requirements. Local models add no API costs but use CPU resources. You might want to experiment with different embedding models for your specific use case.</p><p>: The semantic index persists to disk, enabling warm starts. This means restarted agents can immediately search historical messages without rebuilding the index. Make sure your deployment environment has writable storage (or modify the code to use a different persistence backend).</p><p>: Start with a radius of 2 and adjust based on testing. Larger radii provide more context but use more tokens. Monitor your context usage to find the sweet spot for your domain.</p><p>: The default min_score of -2.0 works well for general use, but you might need to tune it. If you're getting too many irrelevant matches, increase it. If you're missing relevant context, decrease it. Log the scores during development to understand what works for your data.</p><p>The system automatically merges overlapping message ranges. If semantic search finds messages 5-7 and messages 6-9 as relevant, it merges them into a single range 5-9 rather than duplicating messages 6 and 7. This prevents token waste and maintains a cleaner context presentation.</p><p>This improves context quality because the agent sees a coherent narrative flow rather than confusing duplicated messages.</p><p>This hybrid memory architecture excels in several scenarios:</p><p>: Keep the last few exchanges in active context for natural flow, but retrieve exact past conversations when a customer references an earlier issue or order number.</p><p>: Maintain recent context for ongoing tasks while being able to recall specific details from weeks or months ago. \"What was that restaurant you recommended last month?\"</p><p><strong>Technical Documentation Bots</strong>: Summarize long technical discussions while preserving the ability to retrieve exact code snippets, error messages, or configuration values.</p><p>: Remember the student's learning journey, including specific questions they asked and concepts they struggled with, even across multiple sessions.</p><p>: Maintain conversation flow while being able to recall exact numbers, queries, or insights from earlier in a long analysis session.</p><p>The common thread: any agent that needs both conversational coherence and precise recall benefits from this architecture.</p><p>You might be wondering how this compares to other memory solutions. Several approaches exist in the agent ecosystem, but they typically choose one strategy:</p><p>Some frameworks use hierarchical summarization, creating summaries of summaries. This manages context well but makes precise recall even harder—information gets compressed multiple times.</p><p>Some implement retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) where the agent explicitly calls a memory retrieval tool. This gives the agent control but requires it to decide when to search, adding cognitive overhead.</p><p>The Semantic Summarizing Conversation Manager combines automatic summarization for context flow with automatic semantic retrieval for precision. The agent doesn't need to manage memory—it just works. The hook system in Strands makes this possible through its elegant event architecture.</p><p>This hybrid memory system balances efficiency with precision and automatic behavior with configurability. As a prototype, this system demonstrates the core concepts but would benefit from additional hardening, testing, and optimization before production use.</p><p>I'm particularly interested in feedback on parameter tuning for different domains. What works well for customer support might not work for technical documentation. If you use this system, I'd love to hear about your configuration choices and what you learned.</p><p>Ready to improve your agents memory?

A new requirement is emerging: shouldn't there be a search function to help users quickly find the articles they want to read?</p><p>In this article, we are going to add a full-text search feature to our forum.</p><p>If you have some knowledge of SQL, you might be thinking: can't we just use a  query to implement search? For simple scenarios, this is indeed possible. But  queries perform extremely poorly when dealing with large amounts of text and cannot understand linguistic complexities (for example, searching for \"create\" won't match \"creating\").</p><p>Therefore, we will adopt a more professional and efficient solution: using PostgreSQL's built-in Full-Text Search (FTS) feature. It's not only fast but also supports stemming, ignoring stop words, and sorting by relevance, providing search capabilities far superior to .</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Step 1: Database Search Infrastructure (SQL)\n</h2><p>To use PostgreSQL's FTS feature, we first need to make some modifications to our  table: we'll create a special column specifically for storing optimized, high-speed searchable text data.</p><p>We will add a new column named  of type  to the  table. Its purpose is like a dictionary, breaking down the post's title and content into individual words (lexemes) and processing them.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><h3>\n  \n  \n  Use a Trigger to Automatically Update the tsvector Column\n</h3><p>The  column doesn't contain content by itself; we need to convert the title and content into the  format and write it into this column.</p><p>Nobody wants to manually update the  column every time a post is created or updated. The best way is to have the database do this work automatically using a trigger.</p><p>First, let's create a function. This function's job is to concatenate the  and  and convert them into the  format.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><blockquote><p>The  function allows us to set different weights for text from different fields. Here, we are setting the weight for the title ('A') higher than for the content ('B'). This means that in the search results, posts with the keyword in the title will be ranked higher.</p></blockquote><p>Next, create a trigger that will automatically call the function we just created every time a new post is inserted () or updated ().</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>To ensure search speed, the final step is to create a GIN (Generalized Inverted Index) index on the  column.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><h2>\n  \n  \n  Step 2: Backfill Existing Data\n</h2><p>It's important to note that the trigger we created only works for posts created or modified in the . For posts that already exist in the database, their  field is still .</p><p>We need to run a one-time  statement to generate search vectors for all existing posts:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>If your database was created using <a href=\"https://leapcell.io/?lc_t=d_ug29\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Leapcell</a>,</p><p>you can execute these SQL statements directly in its web-based operation panel.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Step 3: Create the Search Results Page\n</h2><p>We need a new HTML page to display the search results.</p><p>In the  folder, create a new file named . This page is very similar to , but it will additionally display the user's search query.</p><p><strong><code>templates/search_results.html</code></strong></p><div><pre><code>Search Results - My FastAPI ForumWelcome to my Forum\n        {% if current_user %}\n        Welcome, {{ current_user.username }}!\n        {% if current_user.is_admin %}\n        [Admin Panel]\n        {% endif %}\n        Logout\n        {% else %}\n        Login |\n        Register\n        {% endif %}\n      SearchSearch Results: \"{{ query | escape }}\"\n\n    {% if posts %} {% for post in posts %}\n    {{ post.title }}{{ post.content }}Author: {{ post.owner.username if post.owner else 'Unknown' }}\n    {% endfor %} {% else %}\n    No posts found matching \"{{ query | escape }}\". Please try different keywords.\n    {% endif %}\n  </code></pre></div><p>Note that we also placed  in the search box's  attribute. This way, after searching, the search box will retain the user's search term.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Step 4: Implement the Search Backend Route\n</h2><p>With the database and frontend page ready, we will now add the backend logic in  to handle search requests.</p><p>First, update the Post model:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p><strong> (Add new route and imports)</strong></p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>The new  route primarily does these things:</p><ol><li> Reads the  parameter (search term), replaces spaces in it with  so that the query will match all keywords.</li><li> Uses , , and  to build the specialized FTS query, and sorts the results by relevance () in descending order.</li><li> Renders the  template with the query results.</li></ol><h2>\n  \n  \n  Step 5: Add the Search Box to the Homepage\n</h2><p>Finally, we need to provide a search entry point for users on the forum's homepage.</p><p>Modify  to add the search form in the .</p><p><strong> (Update header)</strong></p><div><pre><code>... (head and style remain unchanged) ...\nWelcome to My Forum\n        {% if current_user %}\n        Welcome, {{ current_user.username }}!\n        {% if current_user.is_admin %}\n        [Admin Panel]\n        {% endif %}\n        Logout\n        {% else %}\n        Login |\n        Register\n        {% endif %}\n      Search\n\n    ... (rest of the page remains unchanged) ...\n</code></pre></div><p>We also added an  link to the  tag, allowing users to click the title to return to the homepage.</p><p>The feature is now implemented.

Among the most formidable of these is the AWS WAF CAPTCHA—a sophisticated challenge mechanism designed to rigorously separate legitimate human traffic from automated bots. For any serious, high-throughput automation project, mastering the ability to effectively  is not merely an option—it is a foundational engineering necessity.</p><p>This article moves beyond basic product overviews to offer a strategic engineering deep dive. We will dissect the dual nature of the AWS WAF challenge (token-based and image-based) and present the precise technical methodologies, including the essential code structures, required to seamlessly integrate a robust, AI-powered solution from services like <a href=\"https://dashboard.capsolver.com/dashboard/overview/?utm_source=dev.to&amp;utm_medium=article&amp;utm_campaign=aws-waf-captcha-solution\">CapSolver</a> into your high-performance data pipelines.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Dissecting the Defense: The Dual Mechanisms of AWS WAF CAPTCHA\n</h2><p>The CAPTCHA action within AWS WAF is a central pillar of its bot control strategy. When a request is identified as suspicious, the WAF doesn't immediately block it; instead, it issues a challenge. This challenge manifests primarily in two distinct forms, each demanding a specialized technical approach for automated resolution.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  1. The Token-Based Challenge (The Invisible Barrier)\n</h3><p>The most complex and frequently encountered form for automated systems is the token-based verification. This mechanism requires the client to successfully execute a complex JavaScript challenge and, in return, receive a valid, time-limited . This token must then be included in all subsequent requests (typically as a cookie or a header) to prove the client is a legitimate, non-automated browser session.</p><p>The core difficulty for developers lies in the fact that the token generation logic is proprietary, intentionally obfuscated, and subject to frequent, unannounced updates by AWS. To programmatically bypass this, an automation solution must be capable of:</p><ul><li>  Accurately identifying the necessary dynamic parameters (, , ) embedded within the challenge page's source code.</li><li>  Submitting these parameters to a specialized CAPTCHA-solving API.</li><li>  Receiving the successfully generated, valid .</li><li>  Programmatically injecting this token into the automation session's cookie jar for all future requests.</li></ul><h3>\n  \n  \n  2. The Image-Based Challenge (The Visual Puzzle)\n</h3><p>The image-based challenge is more visually familiar, often presenting a grid where the user must identify specific objects (e.g., \"Click all squares with a chair\"). While seemingly straightforward, automating this requires a highly accurate computer vision model trained specifically on the unique image sets and question formats utilized by AWS WAF.</p><p>The automated resolution process involves:</p><ul><li>  Extracting the visual data (usually Base64 encoded images) and the corresponding question from the page.</li><li>  Submitting the visual data and the question to an image classification API.</li><li>  Receiving the coordinates or indices of the correct images as the solution.</li><li>  Programmatically simulating the necessary clicks on the correct grid locations.</li></ul><h2>\n  \n  \n  Strategic Integration: API vs. Browser Automation for Scalability\n</h2><p>Choosing the correct integration method is paramount for achieving enterprise-level scalability. While browser extensions are excellent for quick debugging or small-scale tasks, direct API integration is the mandatory choice for high-volume data acquisition and production systems. For a detailed comparison of high-throughput solvers, you can review resources like this guide on the <a href=\"https://www.capsolver.com/blog/reCAPTCHA/best-serp-captcha-solver\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">best CAPTCHA solvers for SERP data extraction</a>.</p><div><table><thead><tr><th>Browser Extension (e.g., CapSolver Extension)</th><th>API Integration (e.g., CapSolver API)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Debugging, rapid prototyping, manual checks</td><td>Large-scale data acquisition, high-performance production systems</td></tr><tr><td>Limited by browser instance resource overhead</td><td>Highly scalable, optimized for massive parallel processing</td></tr><tr><td>High (requires full browser rendering and memory)</td><td>Minimal (pure, lightweight HTTP requests)</td></tr><tr><td>Medium (bound to the browser environment)</td><td>High (integrates seamlessly into any language, framework, or cloud function)</td></tr><tr><td>Initial development, script validation</td><td>Mission-critical, continuous operation environments</td></tr></tbody></table></div><h2>\n  \n  \n  Technical Implementation: The Code-First Approach\n</h2><p>Regardless of the specific AWS WAF challenge encountered, the core of the solution lies in leveraging a third-party service like CapSolver to offload the complex, AI-driven task of solving the CAPTCHA. The following code snippets and API definitions illustrate how to integrate this capability, ensuring your scripts can consistently overcome the AWS WAF barrier.</p><blockquote><h3>\n  \n  \n  🎁 Claim Your Developer Bonus\n</h3><p>Don’t miss this opportunity to optimize your pipelines!

A well-architected API solution allows for massive parallelization, handling hundreds of concurrent resolution requests. Furthermore, the use of proxy-less task types, such as the , significantly reduces network complexity and potential failure points, streamlining the automation pipeline.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Method 1: Browser-Based Automation with Extension Loading\n</h3><p>For scenarios where a full browser environment (Puppeteer/Selenium) is already required for other tasks (e.g., complex rendering), integrating a CAPTCHA-solving extension simplifies the logic.</p><p><strong>Puppeteer (Node.js) Example:</strong>\nThis code launches a browser with the CapSolver extension loaded, enabling the extension to automatically resolve any AWS WAF CAPTCHA encountered during navigation.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p><strong>Selenium (Python) Example:</strong>\nIn a Python Selenium script, the extension is loaded via Chrome options, making the CAPTCHA resolution transparent to your main scraping logic.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><h3>\n  \n  \n  Method 2: API-Based Integration for Token and Image Resolution\n</h3><p>For maximum performance and scalability, direct API integration is the best practice. The following structures outline the requests for both token-based and image-based AWS WAF challenges. The official documentation for these task types is available in the <a href=\"https://docs.capsolver.com/guide/captcha/awsWaf/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">AWS WAF CAPTCHA Token Documentation</a>.</p><p><strong>API Request Structure for Token-Based AWS WAF CAPTCHA:</strong>\nThe service handles the complex logic of interacting with the AWS challenge script and returns the crucial  in the response's  field.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p><strong>API Request Structure for Image-Based AWS WAF CAPTCHA (Classification):</strong>\nFor visual challenges, the task type is classification, requiring the image data and the question as inputs.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><h2>\n  \n  \n  Ethical Considerations and Engineering Best Practices\n</h2><p>While the techniques to  are powerful, they must be deployed with responsibility. The goal of ethical web scraping is to acquire publicly available data without negatively impacting the target website's performance or violating its terms of service.</p><p><strong>Engineering Best Practices for Ethical Automation:</strong></p><ul><li> Always respect the rules defined in the target site's  file.</li><li> Introduce intelligent delays and throttling to mimic human browsing patterns and prevent server overload.</li><li> Utilize a pool of realistic and rotating User-Agents to avoid static bot signatures.</li><li> For commercial projects, ensure your data acquisition strategy is compliant with all relevant laws and the target website's terms of use.

By deeply understanding the underlying token and image-based mechanisms and strategically employing sophisticated, AI-driven solutions, engineers can successfully integrate CAPTCHA resolution into their scalable data pipelines. The future of web automation hinges on the strategic use of these technologies to ensure uninterrupted, efficient, and reliable data flow.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)\n</h2><p><strong>1. Why is the AWS WAF CAPTCHA so difficult to solve compared to reCAPTCHA?</strong></p><p>AWS WAF CAPTCHA is a multi-stage defense: a proprietary token-based JavaScript challenge followed by an image classification puzzle. The token generation is proprietary and frequently updated, making simple script execution insufficient. It requires a specialized AI model, like those used by <a href=\"https://dashboard.capsolver.com/dashboard/overview/?utm_source=dev.to&amp;utm_medium=article&amp;utm_campaign=aws-waf-captcha-solution\">CapSolver</a>, that is continuously trained on the latest AWS challenges to extract the necessary parameters and solve the puzzle accurately.</p><p><strong>2. Can I use a free or open-source CAPTCHA solver for AWS WAF?</strong></p><p>Due to the proprietary nature and constant evolution of the AWS WAF challenge, free or open-source solvers are generally ineffective. They lack the continuous maintenance, sophisticated AI models, and real-time updates required to successfully bypass the token-based challenge. Reliable solutions must be subscription-based to support the necessary research and development infrastructure.</p><p><strong>3. Is it possible to solve AWS WAF CAPTCHA without using a third-party service?</strong></p><p>While technically possible to reverse-engineer the token generation script, it is highly impractical for most engineering teams. It demands significant, continuous effort to maintain the bypass mechanism as AWS frequently updates its WAF. Using a dedicated third-party service is the most cost-effective and reliable strategy for maintaining a stable, high-performance automation pipeline.</p><p><strong>4. Does CapSolver support other CAPTCHA types like reCAPTCHA v2/v3?</strong></p><p>Yes, CapSolver is a comprehensive  service. In addition to the , it supports a wide range of other types, including reCAPTCHA <a href=\"https://www.capsolver.com/products/recaptchav2/?utm_source=dev.to&amp;utm_medium=article&amp;utm_campaign=aws-waf-captcha-solution\">v2</a> and <a href=\"https://www.capsolver.com/products/recaptchav3/?utm_source=dev.to&amp;utm_medium=article&amp;utm_campaign=aws-waf-captcha-solution\">v3</a>, Cloudflare Turnstile, and more. Check our <a href=\"https://www.capsolver.com/products/?utm_source=dev.to&amp;utm_medium=article&amp;utm_campaign=aws-waf-captcha-solution\">Product Page</a>.</p><p><strong>5. How long does the AWS WAF token last?</strong></p><p>The  is a temporary session token. Its duration is typically short, often lasting only , depending on the target website's configuration. For continuous scraping, you must monitor the token's expiration and re-run the challenge-solving process to obtain a new one. This is a critical factor for maintaining a reliable automation pipeline.</p>","contentLength":10385,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Python Software Foundation: Giày trekking outdoor nữ Humtto 160560B","url":"https://humtto.vn/giay-trekking-outdoor-nu-humtto-160560b/","date":1761898762,"author":"","guid":323474,"unread":true,"content":"","contentLength":0,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Tech With Tim: Build a Python AI Agent in 10 Minutes","url":"https://dev.to/vibe_youtube/tech-with-tim-build-a-python-ai-agent-in-10-minutes-28j","date":1761898045,"author":"Vibe YouTube","guid":323416,"unread":true,"content":"<p>Ever wondered how to build a fully-fledged AI agent in Python in less than ten minutes?

It’s connectionless, datagram-based, and has minimal overhead, making it ideal for real-time apps. But here’s the catch: it doesn’t guarantee delivery, order, or error correction. Compare that to TCP, the cautious librarian who checks every book twice but takes forever.</p><p>Here’s a quick UDP vs. TCP rundown:</p><div><table><thead><tr></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Handshake, higher latency</td></tr><tr></tr><tr><td>Packets may arrive out of order</td></tr><tr></tr></tbody></table></div><p>To make UDP reliable, we need to add:</p><ul><li>: Confirm packets arrived.</li><li>: Track order and detect missing packets.</li><li>: Resend lost packets after a timeout.</li><li>: Control the sending rate.</li></ul><p>Think of it as giving our sprinter a GPS, a checklist, and a retry button—all while keeping them fast.</p><blockquote><p>🛠 : Go’s goroutines handle concurrent clients like a champ, and  makes UDP ops a breeze.

It aims to eliminate the traditional separation between frontend and backend development by allowing you to define your UI, state, and logic in one unified Python codebase. </p><p>Reflex automatically handles the translation of your Python code into a modern React/Next.js frontend, while managing communication and state synchronization with a Python backend under the hood.</p><p>At its core, Reflex is built around three simple but powerful goals:</p><ul><li> Build full-stack web apps using only Python, no need to learn or write JavaScript, TypeScript, or React.</li><li> Start building interactive applications quickly with an intuitive, Pythonic API.</li><li> Scale from simple prototypes to production-grade applications with ease.</li></ul><p>Originally launched under the name , the project rebranded to  to better reflect its mission of providing a more “reflexive” development experience, where changes in code and state seamlessly reflect in the user interface.</p><p>Despite being a relatively new entrant in the Python ecosystem, Reflex has gained significant traction, attracting a large and enthusiastic community. On <a href=\"https://github.com/reflex-dev/reflex\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">GitHub</a>, the project has amassed , reflecting the growing interest among Python developers looking for a modern, unified approach to web development.</p><p>Reflex isn’t just another Python web framework, it’s an attempt to redefine what building web apps in Python can look like: <strong>no JavaScript, no separate front-end stack, and no friction</strong>.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Architecture &amp; How It Works\n</h2><p>At a high level,  unifies your  into a single Python codebase. Unlike traditional web development where the frontend (React, Vue, etc.) and backend (Django, Flask, FastAPI) are separate systems communicating through REST or GraphQL APIs, Reflex merges them into one coherent framework.</p><p>Here’s how the architecture breaks down:</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Frontend: Python Components → React/Next.js\n</h3><p>Reflex lets you define your <strong>user interface using Python components</strong>, which are then <strong>compiled into a modern React/Next.js frontend</strong> under the hood. You never have to touch JavaScript, Reflex automatically generates the necessary HTML, CSS, and JS from your Python code.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Backend: FastAPI-Powered State Management\n</h3><p>Behind the scenes, Reflex runs a <strong>Python backend (based on FastAPI)</strong> that handles , , and  between the UI and server via .</p><p>Every interaction on the frontend, a button click, text input, or dropdown change, triggers an event that is sent back to the Python backend. The backend updates the application’s state, and Reflex automatically syncs the updated state back to the frontend UI.</p><p>Central to Reflex’s design is the concept of a  class.  </p><p>You define reactive variables and methods (event handlers) inside a subclass of . When a state variable changes, Reflex automatically updates all UI components that depend on it, no manual DOM manipulation or client-side JavaScript required.</p><p>This unified approach means:</p><ul><li>You’re writing  all in Python, no context switching to JavaScript.</li><li>You get  out of the box via WebSockets.</li><li>Your app is , much like React or Vue, but powered by Python instead of JavaScript.</li></ul><p>However, this also introduces trade-offs. Because the frontend depends on a live connection to the Python backend, performance and scalability can vary for very large real-time workloads.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  How Reflex Differs from Django, Streamlit, and Dash\n</h3><p>While Django focuses on traditional server-rendered web pages and APIs, and frameworks like Streamlit or Dash cater primarily to data apps and dashboards, Reflex occupies a middle ground:</p><ul><li><strong>Compared to Django + React:</strong> Reflex removes the need to manage two separate codebases and build pipelines.</li><li><strong>Compared to Streamlit/Dash:</strong> Reflex gives you more flexibility, you can build full-featured web applications, not just dashboards, with complete control over routing, components, and state.</li></ul><p>Reflex delivers a <strong>modern, Pythonic alternative</strong> to full-stack web development, one that feels as intuitive as writing a Flask app, but produces dynamic, React-grade user experiences.</p><p>While you explore Reflex and build your first Python-powered web app, don’t forget to grab the <strong>“Master Python One-Liners”</strong> cheat sheet from my site. </p><p>It’s absolutely free and packed with clean, efficient Python snippets that’ll boost your productivity across everything you build, from Reflex apps to Django backends. </p><p>Below are the core features that make Reflex a compelling framework for modern developers.</p><p>Reflex lets you write both your frontend and backend entirely in Python. You define components, routes, state, and event handlers all in the same language and project structure. Under the hood, Reflex compiles your Python UI into a modern React/Next.js app, but you never have to deal with the JavaScript ecosystem directly.  </p><p>This makes it ideal for Python developers who want to build dynamic, interactive web apps without learning a whole new frontend stack.</p><p>Reflex ships with a large library of <strong>ready-to-use UI components</strong> — everything from buttons, grids, and forms to modals and navigation bars.</p><p>Each component follows a Pythonic syntax and can be combined to create rich, responsive layouts.</p><p>Beyond the built-ins, Reflex also supports <strong>wrapping React components</strong>, meaning you can import and use virtually any third-party React library without writing JavaScript yourself.  </p><p>Because Reflex apps run entirely in Python, they have <strong>direct access to the Python ecosystem</strong>, including APIs, databases, file formats, and data libraries like , , or .  </p><p>You can build dashboards that query databases, call machine learning models, or visualize analytics, all in one codebase. </p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Deployment &amp; Hosting Support\n</h3><p>Deploying a Reflex app is straightforward. With a single command, you can build and deploy your app using Reflex’s built-in hosting or export it to deploy anywhere (e.g., Vercel, AWS, or your own server).</p><p>This streamlined deployment process lowers the barrier from prototype to production — especially useful for small teams and indie developers.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Themes &amp; UI Customization\n</h3><p>Reflex includes a  that lets you easily define color palettes, typography, spacing, and global styles.</p><p>Apps built with Reflex are , adapting automatically to different screen sizes and devices, an essential feature for modern web experiences.  </p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Rapid Prototyping &amp; AI Builder Support\n</h3><p>Reflex is especially useful for , you can go from idea to functional web interface in minutes. For developers working in AI or data-driven projects, this means you can build interfaces for models, visualization tools, or automation dashboards directly from your Python environment, no need for a frontend developer.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Getting Started - A Quick Walk-through\n</h2><p>All you need is Python ≥ 3.8.

From meticulously arranging text boxes and images to ensuring consistent formatting across dozens of slides, the manual effort can quickly become a bottleneck, especially when dealing with data-intensive reports or recurring updates. Developers, data scientists, educators, and business professionals frequently face the pain point of translating dynamic data into static, visually appealing slides.</p><p>Imagine a world where your data analysis results automatically populate a presentation, or where a set of standardized reports can be generated with a single script, perfectly formatted every time. This is where Python, with its powerful automation capabilities, steps in. By leveraging the right libraries, you can transform the laborious process of presentation creation into an efficient, scriptable workflow. This article will guide you through the process of programmatically generating PowerPoint presentations using Python, with a specific focus on the Spire.Presentation for Python library, empowering you to automate and enhance your presentation tasks.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Getting Started: Setting Up Your Python Environment\n</h2><p>The first step in our journey to automated presentation creation is to set up your Python environment and familiarize ourselves with the fundamental concepts. We'll be using Spire.Presentation for Python, a robust library designed for working with PowerPoint files.</p><p>To begin, you need to install the library. This can be done easily using pip, Python's package installer:</p><div><pre><code>pip spire.presentation\n</code></pre></div><p>Once installed, the core workflow involves creating a  object, adding  objects to it, populating these slides with content, and finally, saving the presentation to a file. Each  object represents a new PowerPoint file, and  objects within it are where you'll place your text, images, and other visual elements.</p><p>Let's start with a minimal example to create a blank presentation with a single slide and save it. This foundational script will serve as the basis for all our subsequent operations.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>This simple script initializes a presentation, ensures there's at least one slide (which is true by default), and then saves it as a  file. Running this will generate a functional, albeit empty, PowerPoint file.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Populating Slides: Text, Shapes, and Images\n</h2><p>With our basic setup complete, the next logical step is to add meaningful content to our slides. Spire.Presentation for Python provides comprehensive functionalities to add various elements, including text boxes, shapes, and images, and to style them precisely.</p><p>Adding text is fundamental to any presentation. You can add text in various forms, such as titles, bullet points, or paragraphs. The library allows you to control properties like font size, bolding, and color.</p><div><pre><code> \\\n                             \\\n                             \\\n                             \\\n                            </code></pre></div><p>Shapes are crucial for visual organization and emphasis. You can add various predefined shapes like rectangles, circles, and arrows, and customize their appearance.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Images are essential for making presentations engaging. The library allows you to insert images from local files, controlling their position and size on the slide.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>By combining these elements, you can programmatically construct visually rich slides that convey your message effectively.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Enhancing Presentations with Data and Structure\n</h2><p>Beyond basic text and images, presentations often require structured data display and consistent layouts. Spire.Presentation for Python excels at handling these advanced requirements, particularly with tables and slide layouts.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Programmatic Table Generation\n</h3><p>Tables are indispensable for presenting numerical or categorical data clearly. Generating tables programmatically is incredibly powerful for data visualization, allowing you to feed data directly from databases, spreadsheets, or analysis scripts into your presentations.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>This example demonstrates creating a table, populating it with data, and applying basic styling like header highlighting and alternating row colors. This approach is highly scalable for reporting.</p><p>PowerPoint presentations often rely on predefined slide layouts (like \"Title Slide,\" \"Title and Content,\" \"Two Content\") to maintain visual consistency and save design time. Spire.Presentation for Python allows you to select and apply these layouts programmatically.</p><div><pre><code> \\\n                                          \\\n                                         </code></pre></div><p>By leveraging slide layouts, you can ensure that your programmatically generated presentations adhere to corporate branding guidelines or a specific visual style, significantly reducing the need for manual adjustments.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Beyond Manual: Embracing Automation for Dynamic Presentations\n</h2><p>The examples provided demonstrate just a fraction of what's possible when you combine Python's automation capabilities with a powerful library like Spire.Presentation for Python. The key benefits of this approach are clear:</p><ul><li> Drastically reduce the time spent on repetitive presentation tasks. Generate dozens or hundreds of slides in seconds.</li><li> Ensure uniform branding, formatting, and layout across all your presentations, eliminating human error.</li><li> Easily integrate with data sources, allowing for dynamic content updates. Imagine a daily report presentation that updates itself automatically from a database.</li><li> Directly embed data visualizations, charts, and tables generated from your Python data analysis scripts, creating compelling data-driven narratives.</li></ul><p>This Pythonic approach to presentation creation opens up new possibilities for dynamic reporting, personalized presentations, and streamlined educational content delivery. Developers can integrate this into larger applications, data scientists can automate their result dissemination, and educators can generate customized learning materials. The future of presentations lies in embracing automation, and Python provides the robust toolkit to make this a reality. By mastering these techniques, you're not just creating slides; you're building a system for intelligent, efficient, and consistent communication.</p>","contentLength":6203,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"How to Convert Excel to PDF with Python","url":"https://dev.to/codingco/how-to-convert-excel-to-pdf-with-python-3b33","date":1761894161,"author":"Jeremy K.","guid":323400,"unread":true,"content":"<p>In modern workflow and data management, converting Excel spreadsheets to PDF is a ubiquitous need—whether for client reports, archival purposes, or cross-team collaboration.

Just click \"New Notebook\" on Kaggle and you're ready to code.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Step 1: Understanding the Problem\n</h2><p> Predict how much a house in Melbourne will cost based on its features (size, number of rooms, land size, etc.)\n**Think of it like this: **If I told you a Melbourne house has 4 bedrooms, 2 bathrooms, 500 sqm land, and 150 sqm building area, could you guess roughly what it costs? You'd probably compare it to other houses you know. That's exactly what we're teaching the computer to do!</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Step 2: Setting Up - Import Libraries\n</h2><p>First, we need to bring in our tools:<a href=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fr7tkr9fyn7v3r1cagk3m.png\"><img src=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fr7tkr9fyn7v3r1cagk3m.png\" alt=\" \" width=\"584\" height=\"138\"></a></p><ul><li> is like Excel for Python—it handles data tables</li><li> (scikit-learn) contains all our machine learning tools</li><li>We're importing specific tools we'll need for building and testing models</li></ul><p>Think of it like: Opening your toolbox before starting a project - we're grabbing the hammer, screwdriver, and wrench we'll need!</p><p><strong>Important note for Kaggle users:</strong> When you attach a dataset in Kaggle, it's stored in <code>/kaggle/input/[dataset-name]/</code>. That's why we use that special path!</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Step 4: Exploring the Data\n</h2><p>Before building any model, you need to understand your data:<a href=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2F70g0rdvvotfmhwbma4r7.png\"><img src=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2F70g0rdvvotfmhwbma4r7.png\" alt=\" \" width=\"421\" height=\"249\"></a></p><ul><li>: How many houses have this information</li><li>: The average value (e.g., average price is around $1M!)</li><li>: The range of values</li><li>: The median (middle value) - helps spot outliers</li><li>: Some houses don't have all information filled in</li></ul><p>: The Melbourne dataset has 13,580 houses, but I noticed that some columns like BuildingArea only have 7,130 values. That means almost half the houses are missing this info! We need to handle this.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Step 5: Choosing and Cleaning Our Data\n</h2><p>Here's where we decide what to use and clean up the missing values:<a href=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fp7w11oq39xdwwp13coiy.png\"><img src=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fp7w11oq39xdwwp13coiy.png\" alt=\" \" width=\"763\" height=\"399\"></a></p><p> - I picked characteristics that logically affect price:\n-: More rooms = usually more expensive\n-: More bathrooms = usually more expensive\n-: Bigger lot = usually more expensive\n-: Bigger house = usually more expensive</p><p>- This removes any house that's missing data in our chosen columns</p><ul><li>Started with 13,580 houses</li><li>After cleaning: about 6,196 complete houses</li><li>We lose some data, but the remaining data is reliable!</li></ul><ul><li>In math,  represents input variables and** y** is what we're solving for</li><li> (features) → goes into the model → y (prediction) comes out</li></ul><p> It's like doing a survey - you can only use complete responses, so you filter out any surveys with missing answers.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Step 6: The Critical Step - Split Your Data!\n</h2><p>This is where I made my first mistake, so pay close attention!<a href=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Ff78fkea1r3quhddpxh74.png\"><img src=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Ff78fkea1r3quhddpxh74.png\" alt=\" \" width=\"800\" height=\"162\"></a></p><p><strong>Why split the data? Here's the critical lesson:</strong>\nImagine you're studying for a test. You memorize 10 practice questions. Then the test has those EXACT 10 questions. You ace it! But did you actually learn the material, or did you just memorize?</p><ul><li>(75%): The model learns patterns from these houses</li><li>(25%): We test on houses the model has NEVER seen</li></ul><p>?**</p><ul><li>Ensures we get the same random split every time</li><li>Makes results reproducible (crucial for debugging!)</li><li>You can use any number (1, 42, 123, etc.)\nThis prevents *(memorization) and ensures our model actually learned patterns, not just memorized answers!</li></ul><h2>\n  \n  \n  Step 7: Building Your First Model - Decision Tree\n</h2><p>Here's where the magic happens:<a href=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fwicsuvptqrp26xh0kkda.png\"><img src=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fwicsuvptqrp26xh0kkda.png\" alt=\" \" width=\"563\" height=\"322\"></a></p><p> This is our model type. Think of it as a flowchart that asks questions:</p><ul><li>\"Does the house have more than 3 rooms?\"</li><li>\"Is the land size larger than 200 sqm?\"</li><li>\"Is the building area larger than 100 sqm?\"</li><li>Based on the answers, it navigates to a prediction</li></ul><p>- Ensures consistent results every time</p><p> - This is the training! The model studies the training houses and learns patterns</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Step 8: Measuring Accuracy - Mean Absolute Error (MAE)\n</h2><p>Now let's see how good our model is:<a href=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fdyahh0gamizz5l3wk6wj.png\"><img src=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fdyahh0gamizz5l3wk6wj.png\" alt=\" \" width=\"579\" height=\"114\"></a></p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Step 9: Making It Better with Random Forest\n</h2><p>Single decision trees are okay, but Random Forests are MUCH better.

You Don't Need a Math PhD</strong>\nI'm not a math genius. I haven't taken calculus in years. You can still learn ML! Start with the practical stuff, the math will make more sense later.<strong>2. Code Along, Don't Just Watch</strong>\nI learn by doing. Watch a tutorial, then code it yourself. Change things. Break stuff. See what happens.\nKaggle gives you:- Free courses with interactive coding</p><ul><li>Real competitions to test your skills</li></ul><p><strong>4. Don't Get Stuck on Theory</strong>\nI spent 2 days trying to understand decision tree math. Then I just built one and it clicked. Sometimes you need to do it to get it.</p><p>\nSharing my learning journey:</p><ul><li>Helps me remember by teaching others</li><li>Connects me with other learners</li><li>Creates a portfolio of my progress</li></ul><p><strong>6. It's Okay to Be Confused</strong>\nI was confused for 90% of this week. That's normal! Push through it. Things will click.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  The Honest Truth About Learning ML\n</h2><p>Let me be real with you:<strong>It's not as hard as you think.</strong> The basics of ML are surprisingly accessible. You don't need to understand complex math to build your first models.<strong>It's harder than it looks.</strong> There's a lot of trial and error. Your first models will probably be bad. That's okay!<strong>It's incredibly rewarding.</strong> When your model makes its first decent prediction, it feels like magic (even though you know it's not). A week in, I've barely scratched the surface. There's so much more to learn, and that's exciting!</p><p>A week ago, I thought machine learning was this impossibly complex field. Today, I built a model that can predict house prices with reasonable accuracy.</p><p>Is it perfect? No.\nAm I an expert? Definitely not.<p>\nDid I learn a ton and have fun doing it? Absolutely!</p></p><p>If you've been curious about ML but haven't taken the first step—this is your sign. </p><p>You don't need to be ready, you don't need to know everything, you just need to begin.</p><p>The best time to start learning ML was yesterday. The second best time is right now.</p><p><em>Thanks for reading!

The system maintains explicit memory across multi-turn interactions and trains only the planning component to keep learning focused and stable. From my experiments, this architecture is 3x easier to debug than monolithic agents and shows significant accuracy improvements through reward-based training.</p><p>Three months ago, my AI agent crashed for the hundredth time, and I couldn't figure out why.</p><p>The problem wasn't the algorithm or the model—it was the architecture. I had built a monolithic agent that tried to do everything in one giant neural network. Planning, execution, verification, all tangled together in an unmaintainable mess.</p><p>That's when I decided to rebuild from scratch using modular design principles and reinforce learning. The result? An agent system that's not only more reliable but actually learns and improves over time.</p><p>In this article, I'll share exactly how I built this system. You'll learn how to architect a modular AI agent, implement reinforcement learning for continuous improvement, integrate external tools, and manage multi-turn conversations with explicit memory.</p><p>If you've ever struggled with debugging AI agents or wondered how to make them learn from experience, this guide is for you.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  What's This Article About?\n</h2><p>I'm going to walk you through building an intelligent agent with four separate modules, each with a single responsibility. The Planner decides what to do next, the Executor performs the actions, the Verifier checks if we're making progress, and the Generator creates the final response.</p><p>Here's what you'll learn:</p><ul><li>How to design a modular AI agent architecture that's actually maintainable</li><li>Implementing policy gradient reinforcement learning to improve agent decisions</li><li>Building a memory system that prevents context confusion</li><li>Integrating external tools like search, calculators, and APIs</li><li>Training agents with sparse reward signals</li></ul><p>The system I'll show you handles complex, multi-step tasks that require tool use, reasoning, and self-correction. Think research questions, data analysis, or coding assistance—tasks that need more than a single LLM call.</p><p>From my experience building three different agent systems over the past year, I've learned that architecture matters more than model size.</p><p>Here's what I discovered:</p><ul><li><strong>Modular agents are 3x easier to debug</strong> - When something fails, you know exactly which component to inspect</li><li><strong>RL training improves accuracy by 15-20%</strong> on complex tasks compared to un-trained agents</li><li><strong>Separation of concerns makes agents more reliable</strong> - Each module can be tested and improved independently</li><li> as task complexity grows, unlike monolithic architectures that become unwieldy</li></ul><p>Real-world applications where I've used this pattern:</p><ul><li>Research assistants that gather and synthesize information from multiple sources</li><li>Code debugging agents that identify issues and propose fixes</li><li>Data analysis tools that explore datasets and generate insights</li><li>Customer support bots that resolve multi-step issues</li></ul><p>If you're building AI systems that need to be production-ready, not just demos, this architecture will save you months of debugging time.</p><p>The breakthrough for me was realizing that agent tasks have distinct phases, and each phase needs different capabilities.</p><p>When you're , you need strategic thinking—understanding the goal and choosing the right approach. When you're , you need reliability—correctly calling APIs and handling errors. When you're , you need judgment—assessing whether results are useful.</p><p>Trying to make one neural network do all three well is like asking a single person to be a strategist, mechanic, and quality inspector simultaneously. It's possible, but inefficient.</p><p>Here's the modular design I settled on after many iterations:</p><div><pre><code>Query → [Planner] → [Executor] → [Verifier] → Update Memory\n         ↑                                          ↓\n         ←──────────────────────────────────────────\n                    (Loop until complete)\n                            ↓\n                     [Generator] → Final Answer\n</code></pre></div><p> sits in the center, tracking everything that happens. Each component reads from memory to understand context and writes back to update state.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  The Four Modules Explained\n</h3><p> (The only component we train)</p><p>The Planner's job is to decide what to do next given the current state. It receives the original query plus the history of actions taken so far and outputs which tool to use and what inputs to provide.</p><p>I made a crucial decision here: the Planner is the ONLY component that gets trained with RL. Everything else is deterministic or uses frozen models.</p><p>Why? From my experience, training multiple components simultaneously leads to unstable learning. The Planner's job is well-defined (choose good actions), so we can focus optimization there.</p><p> (Deterministic, no learning)</p><p>The Executor takes the Planner's decision and actually does it. If the Planner says \"search for weather in Boston,\" the Executor calls the search API with those exact parameters.</p><p>I kept this purely deterministic. No neural networks, no randomness. Just reliable code that either succeeds or fails with clear error messages.</p><p>This makes debugging infinitely easier. If something goes wrong during execution, it's a code/API issue, not a learning problem.</p><p> (Hybrid approach)</p><p>The Verifier checks whether each action actually helped us progress toward answering the query. It assigns a reward signal (0-1 score) that the Planner uses for learning.</p><p>In my implementation, I use a hybrid approach:</p><ul><li>Quick heuristics for obvious cases (empty results = negative reward)</li><li>LLM-based judgment for nuanced evaluation (does this information help answer the question?)</li></ul><p>This balance, from my experiments, gives good accuracy without being too slow or expensive.</p><p> (Template-based or LLM)</p><p>Once the Verifier signals we have enough information, the Generator creates the final answer by synthesizing everything in memory.</p><p>I use a simple approach: format the memory into a context string and prompt an LLM to generate a coherent response. You could also use templates for structured outputs.</p><p>The memory structure I use tracks five things for each step:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>This explicit memory design does three critical things:</p><ol><li><strong>Prevents context confusion</strong> - The agent always knows what it's done</li><li> - You can replay exactly what happened</li><li> - We have a complete trajectory for learning</li></ol><p>I also implement context windowing—only the most recent 5 turns are included in prompts. This prevents token overflow while maintaining relevant context.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Reinforcement Learning Strategy\n</h3><p>Here's where things get interesting. I use a technique inspired by PPO (Proximal Policy Optimization) but adapted for the sequential nature of agent tasks.</p><p>The key insight: <strong>treat long-horizon tasks as sequences of single-turn decisions</strong>.</p><p>Instead of waiting for the final answer to assign credit, I use the Verifier to provide immediate feedback at each step. Then, I \"broadcast\" the final outcome reward (did we answer correctly?) back to every decision in the trajectory.</p><p>This approach, from my experiments, solves the credit assignment problem elegantly. Each action gets credit both for its immediate value (Verifier score) and the final outcome.</p><ol><li>Run the agent on a query, collecting a complete trajectory</li><li>Compute advantage estimates for each step (reward-to-go)</li><li>Update the Planner's policy using PPO with KL divergence penalty</li><li>Keep a reference policy frozen to prevent catastrophic forgetting</li></ol><p>I spent weeks tuning the hyperparameters. The clipratio (0.2) and KL coefficient (0.01) I settled on give stable learning without large policy shifts.</p><p>Now I'll show you the actual implementation. I'll break this into digestible pieces and explain my reasoning for each design choice.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Part 1: Core Data Structures\n</h3><p>First, we need clean data structures. I learned this the hard way—messy data leads to messy debugging.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>: The  decorator automatically generates , , and comparison methods. This saved me hours of boilerplate code.</p><p>The  method is crucial. In my early versions, I passed the entire history to the LLM, quickly hitting token limits. This windowing approach keeps memory bounded while maintaining relevant context.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Part 2: The Planner (Where Learning Happens)\n</h3><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>: I initially tried making the LLM output JSON. That failed spectacularly—models are inconsistent with JSON formatting. This structured prompt approach gives 90%+ successful parses.</p><p>The reference model is critical. Without it, the policy can drift too far from initialization and lose language coherence. I learned this after my agent started generating gibberish during training.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Part 3: The Executor (Reliability Matters)\n</h3><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p><strong>Critical design decisions</strong>: Every tool call is wrapped in try/except. Every external call has a timeout. Results are truncated to prevent memory issues.</p><p>I learned these lessons from production failures. The agent would hang on slow APIs, crash on malformed responses, or overflow memory with large web pages. This defensive code prevents those issues.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Part 4: The Verifier (Hybrid Intelligence)\n</h3><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>: Pure rules are too rigid. Pure LLM is too slow and expensive. This combination, from my testing, hits the sweet spot—fast heuristics catch obvious cases, LLM handles nuanced evaluation.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Part 5: Training with Reinforcement Learning\n</h3><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p><strong>Why this training approach works</strong>: I use reward-to-go instead of just immediate rewards because it connects each action to the final outcome. Normalization prevents gradient explosions I experienced in early training runs.</p><p>Here's everything you need to build this yourself:</p><ul><li>PyTorch 2.0+ (for RL training)</li><li>Transformers (HuggingFace library)</li></ul><p><strong>Optional but Recommended:</strong></p><ul><li>SerpAPI account (for search)</li><li>OpenAI API (for better verification)</li><li>Docker (for sandboxed code execution)</li></ul><div><pre><code>pip torch transformers requests\n</code></pre></div><p>Here's how to get this running on your machine:</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Step 1: Project Structure\n</h3><div><pre><code>intelligent-agent/\n├── agent_core.py      # Memory and state management\n├── planner.py         # Planning module\n├── executor.py        # Execution module\n├── verifier.py        # Verification module\n├── trainer.py         # RL training\n├── main.py            # Entry point\n└── config.json        # Configuration\n</code></pre></div><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><div><pre><code>python main.py </code></pre></div><div><pre><code>Turn 1: Planning → Using calculator\nTurn 2: Executing → Result: 37.5\nTurn 3: Verifying → Score: 0.9\nTurn 4: Generating final answer\n\nAnswer: 15% of 250 is 37.5. This means that if you take 15 \npercent of 250, you get 37.5. This is calculated by multiplying \n250 by 0.15 (which is 15/100).\n</code></pre></div><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>From my experiments, you'll see:</p><ul><li>Loss decreasing over epochs (good!)</li><li>Better tool selection after 5-10 epochs</li><li>More coherent reasoning in action justifications</li><li>Fewer unnecessary tool calls</li></ul><p>After building this system over three months, here are my biggest takeaways:</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  What Worked Exceptionally Well\n</h3><p> - I can't stress this enough. Being able to swap out the Executor implementation without touching the Planner saved me countless hours. When the SerpAPI rate limit hit, I switched to a different search provider in 10 minutes.</p><p><strong>Training only the Planner</strong> - This decision kept training stable and fast. I tried training everything end-to-end early on—it was a disaster. Focusing optimization on one component made debugging tractable.</p><p> - The ability to replay exactly what happened made debugging 10x easier. No more \"why did the agent do that?\" questions I couldn't answer.</p><p> - Combining simple heuristics with LLM judgment gave me the best of both worlds. Fast enough for real-time use, accurate enough for reliable rewards.</p><p><strong>Start with smaller models</strong> - I began with GPT-2 Large and wasted time on slow training. GPT-2 Medium was just as effective for learning the planning task and trained 3x faster.</p><p><strong>Add comprehensive logging earlier</strong> - I added detailed logging after the third mysterious failure. Should have done it from day one. Now I log every decision, every tool call, every reward signal.</p><p><strong>Build evaluation metrics before training</strong> - I started training without clear success metrics. Bad idea. I added a test suite of 50 queries with known correct answers, which made measuring progress much easier.</p><p> - API calls get expensive fast during training. Caching executor results for identical inputs saved me hundreds of dollars.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Lessons for Production Deployment\n</h3><p>From deploying this in production:</p><ol><li> - If the search API is down, have a backup</li><li> - Don't let one slow tool call block everything</li><li> - Tool success rates, average turns per query, verification scores</li><li> - Start with 5% of traffic, not 100%</li></ol><h3>\n  \n  \n  Future Improvements I'm Considering\n</h3><p> - Adding vision and audio tools would open up new use cases. The architecture supports this—just add new tools to the Executor.</p><p> - For very complex queries, a two-level planner (high-level strategy + low-level tactics) might work better. This is my next experiment.</p><p> - Current RL training needs 100+ episodes to see improvement. Techniques like hindsight experience replay might help.</p><p> - Running multiple tool calls in parallel would speed things up significantly. The current sequential approach is simpler but slower.</p><p>Building intelligent agents is less about having cutting-edge algorithms and more about solid engineering. The modular architecture I showed you isn't revolutionary—it's software engineering 101 applied to AI.</p><p>But that's exactly why it works.</p><p>From my experience, the AI systems that make it to production aren't the ones with the fanciest papers behind them. They're the ones that are maintainable, debuggable, and reliable.</p><p>If you take one thing from this article, let it be this: . Don't build monolithic agents. Break them into modules with clear responsibilities. Your future self (and your team) will thank you.</p><p>I encourage you to start small:</p><ol><li>Build the basic four-module structure</li><li>Add one simple tool (like a calculator)</li></ol><p>You don't need to implement the full RL training loop from day one. A non-learning agent with good architecture is already valuable.</p><p>As you build, you'll develop intuition for what works. The agent will tell you where it needs improvement—listen to it.</p><ul><li><strong>Modular architecture beats monolithic</strong> - Separate planning, execution, and verification into distinct components</li><li> - Only optimize the Planner; keep other components deterministic</li><li><strong>Explicit memory prevents confusion</strong> - Track states, actions, and observations explicitly</li><li><strong>Hybrid verification works best</strong> - Combine fast heuristics with LLM-based judgment</li><li> - Policy gradient methods with KL regularization provide stable learning</li><li><strong>Engineering matters more than algorithms</strong> - Good architecture trumps fancy techniques</li></ul><p>Have you built AI agents?

One of the most closely watched indices in the world, the S&amp;P 500 has been a bellwether for the broader market. In this post, we will take a closer look at the equal-weight version of the S&amp;P 500 and its recent performance.</p><p>In September, the equal-weight S&amp;P 500 booked its longest streak of monthly gains since 2021. This is a significant achievement, as the equal-weight S&amp;P 500 is designed to provide a more accurate representation of the broader market. By giving equal weight to each stock in the index, the equal-weight S&amp;P 500 is less susceptible to the influence of large-cap stocks.</p><p>This streak of gains is particularly noteworthy given the current market conditions.

It’s the bridge that allows code to adapt gracefully across different stages—from a developer's laptop to a production server. Without solid configuration practices, even the best-written code can falter when faced with real-world variables like database connections, API keys, or environment-specific settings. Over the years, I've experimented with various approaches, and I want to share some of the most effective techniques I've used for handling configurations in Python.</p><p>Let's start with environment variables. They are a straightforward way to externalize configuration from your code, making it portable and secure. I often use the built-in os module to access these variables. For instance, in a web application, I might set the database URL, debug mode, and API keys as environment variables. This way, the same code can run in development, testing, or production without changes. Here's a simple example:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>This approach ensures that sensitive information like API keys isn't hardcoded. I remember a project where we accidentally committed a configuration file with passwords; switching to environment variables prevented such mishaps. It's a small change that pays off in security and flexibility.</p><p>Another technique I rely on is using configuration files, especially in YAML format. YAML files are human-readable and support nested structures, which is great for organizing complex settings. In one of my applications, I used a config.yaml file to store database details, server settings, and more. Here's how I might load it:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>This method keeps everything in one place, making it easy to review and modify. I've found that teams appreciate the clarity, especially when onboarding new members who need to understand the setup quickly.</p><p>For development, I often use python-dotenv to load environment variables from a .env file. This mimics production environments while keeping secrets out of version control. I recall a time when our team struggled with inconsistent local setups; dotenv solved that by standardizing our development environment. Here's a typical usage:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>By including a .env.example file in the repository, we ensure everyone starts with the right defaults. It's a simple tool that reduces friction in collaborative projects.</p><p>When I need more structure, I turn to dataclasses for defining configuration schemas. With type hints, dataclasses enforce correct types and provide default values, which helps catch errors early. In a recent API project, I defined an AppConfig class to hold server settings:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>This approach makes the configuration self-documenting and easy to extend. I've noticed that it encourages better code practices, as team members can see at a glance what settings are available.</p><p>Handling secrets securely is non-negotiable. I've used external services like HashiCorp Vault to manage passwords and tokens, keeping them out of code repositories. In one high-security application, we integrated Vault to retrieve database credentials dynamically:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>This method adds a layer of protection, especially in cloud environments. I've seen it prevent potential breaches, as secrets are never stored in plain text within the application.</p><p>Validation is another area I emphasize. Using Pydantic models, I can enforce data types and constraints on configuration values. For example, in a data processing tool, I validated database settings to ensure ports were within valid ranges:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>This catches misconfigurations at startup, saving hours of debugging. I've integrated this into CI/CD pipelines to validate configurations before deployment.</p><p>Dynamic configuration reloading is useful for long-running applications. I've implemented file watchers or signal handlers to update settings without restarting. In a web service that needed to adjust logging levels on the fly, I used signals to reload the config:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>This allowed us to tweak settings in production without downtime. It's a technique I recommend for services that require high availability.</p><p>Lastly, environment-specific configuration helps tailor settings for different contexts. I often use conditional logic to switch between development, staging, and production values. In a multi-environment setup, I defined variables like this:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>This ensures that each environment behaves appropriately, reducing the risk of using production settings in development. I've found it essential for maintaining consistency across deployments.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  These techniques form a toolkit that I adapt based on project needs. Whether it's a small script or a large distributed system, thoughtful configuration management leads to more reliable and maintainable code. By combining these methods, I've built applications that are easier to deploy, scale, and troubleshoot. It's a continuous learning process, but these practices have served me well in diverse scenarios.\n</h2><p>📘 , , , and  to the channel!</p><p> is an AI-driven publishing company co-founded by author .

He found Margaret already at her desk, reviewing some code.</p><p>\"I've been thinking about context variables,\" Timothy said, pulling up a chair. \"Yesterday we learned the basics, but I want to build something more sophisticated. Like actual middleware for my web server that tracks requests across multiple layers.\"</p><p>Margaret smiled. \"Perfect timing. Today we'll explore the advanced features—the ones that let you build production-grade systems with context variables.\"</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  The Token Pattern: Temporary Context Changes\n</h2><p>\"Remember yesterday when I mentioned that  returns a Token?\" Margaret asked. \"Let me show you why that matters.\"</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><div><pre><code>  Regular operation: role=user\n  Before elevation: role=user\n  During elevation: role=admin\n  Still elevated: role=admin\n  After restoration: role=user\n  Regular operation: role=user\n</code></pre></div><p>\"The token remembers the  value,\" Timothy observed. \"So  puts it back exactly how it was.\"</p><p>\"Exactly,\" Margaret said. \"This is crucial for temporarily changing context in a safe way. Even if an exception happens during the elevated operation, the  block ensures the context gets restored.\"</p><div><pre><code>Token Pattern:\n\nInitial state:    role = \"user\"\n                       ↓\ntoken = set(\"admin\")  role = \"admin\"  (token remembers \"user\")\n                       ↓\n  ... do work ...     role = \"admin\"\n                       ↓\nreset(token)          role = \"user\"   (restored from token)\n                       ↓\nContinue:             role = \"user\"\n</code></pre></div><h2>\n  \n  \n  Context Managers for Automatic Restoration\n</h2><p>\"Since we're using try/finally, we can make this cleaner with a context manager,\" Margaret said.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><div><pre><code>Checking permissions: role=user\n  Inside with block: role=admin\n  Still inside: role=admin\nAfter with block: role=user\n</code></pre></div><p>\"Much cleaner,\" Timothy said. \"The context manager handles the token automatically.\"</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Explicit Context Manipulation: copy_context()\n</h2><p>Margaret opened a new file. \"Sometimes you need more control over contexts. That's where  comes in. This is especially important when working with thread pools.\"</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><div><pre><code>Main task: req_123\n\nWithout context copy:\n  Thread pool worker: no context (LookupError)\n\nWith context copy:\n  Thread pool worker sees request_id: req_123\n\nMain task still has: req_123\n</code></pre></div><p>\"Ah!\" Timothy said. \"The thread pool doesn't automatically inherit context like async tasks do.\"</p><p>\"Exactly,\" Margaret explained. \"When you use , Python automatically propagates context to child tasks. But thread pools and process pools are different—they're separate execution contexts that need explicit context copying.\"</p><p>She leaned forward to emphasize the point. \"Here's what's actually happening: when <code>executor.submit(cpu_intensive_work)</code> is called, the  function starts execution on a brand new, independent thread. Unlike asyncio tasks which are children of the current context, this new thread starts with a blank, default context. It has no mechanism to look back and inherit the context of the async task that spawned it.\"</p><p>\"So it's like starting from scratch?\" Timothy asked.</p><p>\"Exactly.  takes a snapshot of the current async task's context and wraps it around the submitted function using , ensuring the worker starts with the correct state instead of an empty context.\"</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><div><pre><code>Using await (automatic inheritance):\nWorker sees config: production\n\nUsing create_task (automatic inheritance):\nWorker sees config: production\n\n(Both work because they stay in the async context)\n</code></pre></div><p>\"So  is mainly for crossing execution boundaries,\" Timothy summarized. \"Thread pools, process pools, or custom schedulers.\"</p><p>\"Right. Most of the time, async code just works. But when you need to run synchronous code in an executor, that's when you need .\"</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  The Context.run() Pattern\n</h2><p>\"There's another powerful pattern,\" Margaret said. \"Sometimes you want to run code in a  context.\"</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><div><pre><code>Main context before:\n  database: main_db\n  transaction_id: main_txn\n\nRunning in isolated context:\n  Isolated context:\n    database: not set\n    transaction_id: not set\n    Set values in isolated context\n\nMain context after:\n  database: main_db\n  transaction_id: main_txn\n  (unchanged!)\n</code></pre></div><p>\"The isolated context started completely empty,\" Timothy noted. \"And changes inside didn't affect the main context.\"</p><p>\"Right.  creates a fresh, empty context. This is useful for testing, for running untrusted code, or for operations that shouldn't inherit any ambient state.\"</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Building Request Middleware\n</h2><p>Margaret pulled up a more realistic example. \"Let's build something production-ready: middleware for tracking requests through a web application.\"</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><div><pre><code>[a3f8e912] Request started: /profile\n[b7c2d445] Request started: /public\n[e9a1f334] Request started: /profile\n[a3f8e912] DB Query (user=100): SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ?\n[b7c2d445] DB Query (user=None): SELECT * FROM public_pages\n[e9a1f334] DB Query (user=200): SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ?\n[a3f8e912] Notification: Profile viewed\n[e9a1f334] Notification: Profile viewed\n[b7c2d445] Request completed: /public (user=None, duration=0.053s)\n[a3f8e912] Request completed: /profile (user=100, duration=0.073s)\n[e9a1f334] Request completed: /profile (user=200, duration=0.073s)\n</code></pre></div><p>\"This is powerful,\" Timothy said. \"Every database query and notification automatically knows which request it belongs to, without passing parameters everywhere.\"</p><p>\"That's the beauty of context variables in web frameworks,\" Margaret said. \"The middleware sets up the context once, and every function in the request handling chain can access it.\"</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  How Real Frameworks Use Context Variables\n</h2><p>Margaret pulled up some documentation on her screen. \"Let's look at how actual frameworks use this pattern.\"</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>\"FastAPI does something similar?\" Timothy asked.</p><p>\"Yes,\" Margaret said. \"FastAPI uses dependency injection primarily, but it also uses context variables internally. Libraries like  are especially common in async frameworks, logging libraries, and observability tools.\"</p><p>She showed another example:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><div><pre><code>Request trace_id=trace_001\n  → Start span: http.request (trace=trace_001, parent=None)\nRequest trace_id=trace_002\n  → Start span: http.request (trace=trace_002, parent=None)\n  → Start span: cache.get (trace=trace_001, parent=http.request)\n  → Start span: cache.get (trace=trace_002, parent=http.request)\n  ← End span: cache.get\n  → Start span: database.query (trace=trace_001, parent=http.request)\n  ← End span: cache.get\n  → Start span: database.query (trace=trace_002, parent=http.request)\n  ← End span: database.query\n  → Start span: response.serialize (trace=trace_001, parent=http.request)\n  ← End span: database.query\n  → Start span: response.serialize (trace=trace_002, parent=http.request)\n  ← End span: response.serialize\n  ← End span: http.request\nRequest complete\n\n  ← End span: response.serialize\n  ← End span: http.request\nRequest complete\n</code></pre></div><p>\"Each trace keeps its own context even though they're interleaved!\" Timothy said.</p><p>\"Exactly. This is how distributed tracing works in production. Libraries like OpenTelemetry use context variables to track spans across async operations without manual propagation.\"</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  When NOT to Use Context Variables\n</h2><p>Margaret leaned back. \"As powerful as context variables are, they're not always the right choice. Let's talk about alternatives.\"</p><p>She created a comparison:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>\"When should I use each?\" Timothy asked.</p><p>Margaret drew a decision tree:</p><div><pre><code>Choosing the Right Approach:\n\n┌─ Is this truly ambient context that flows through many layers?\n│  (request ID, trace ID, user identity across whole request)\n│\n├─ YES → Consider Context Variables\n│  │\n│  ├─ Is it used across async boundaries or threading?\n│  │  ├─ YES → Context Variables are ideal ✓\n│  │  └─ NO → Consider explicit parameters (simpler)\n│  │\n│  └─ Will it make testing harder? (hidden dependencies)\n│     ├─ YES → Reconsider\n│     └─ NO → Context Variables work well\n│\n└─ NO → Use explicit parameters or dependency injection\n   │\n   ├─ Few dependencies → Explicit parameters\n   ├─ Many dependencies → Dependency Injection\n   └─ Configuration/settings → Module-level constants or config objects\n</code></pre></div><p>She elaborated with code:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>\"So context variables are for ambient, cross-cutting concerns,\" Timothy summarized. \"Not for core business logic.\"</p><p>\"Right. They're powerful when used appropriately, but they can make code harder to understand and test if overused.\"</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Performance Considerations\n</h2><p>\"One more thing,\" Margaret said. \"Let's talk about performance.\"</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><div><pre><code>Context variable access: 0.0083s\nParameter access: 0.0021s\nRatio: 4.0x\n\nIn practice: The overhead is negligible for typical use cases\n</code></pre></div><p>\"Context variables are slower than parameters,\" Timothy noted.</p><p>\"Yes, but in practice, the overhead is negligible for typical use cases. You're not accessing context variables 100,000 times in a tight loop. You access them a handful of times per request to get logging context or request IDs.\"</p><p>\"The real performance consideration is: don't create new ContextVar objects in hot paths. Create them once at module level, just like you would with global variables.\"</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>\"Why is that bad?\" Timothy asked.</p><p>Margaret explained, \"When you create a  object, you're essentially creating a permanent vault manager. Even though it looks like a local variable here, internally Python's runtime registers this as a new, unique context variable in its global tracking system.\"</p><p>She continued, \"If you create a new one on every request, the Python runtime's internal tracking system for contexts gets cluttered with thousands of unique context variables that are never reused or cleaned up. This adds unnecessary memory overhead and makes internal context lookups less efficient over time. Each  is meant to be a singleton that lives for the life of your application, not a per-request object.\"</p><p>They were finishing up. Margaret created one final, comprehensive example:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><div><pre><code>[INFO] [a3f8e912] [corr=b7c2d445] [user=42] Starting business operation\n[INFO] [a3f8e912] [corr=b7c2d445] [user=42] Calling downstream service\n[INFO] [a3f8e912] [corr=b7c2d445] [user=42] Downstream responded (corr=b7c2d445)\n[INFO] [a3f8e912] [corr=b7c2d445] [user=42] Business operation complete\n[a3f8e912] Completed in 0.052s\n</code></pre></div><p>Timothy closed his laptop, now understanding the full power of context variables for building production systems.</p><p><strong>Token objects enable safe temporary changes</strong>:  returns a token;  restores the previous value.</p><p><strong>Use context managers for automatic restoration</strong>: Wrap token operations in try/finally or use @contextmanager for clean code.</p><p><strong>copy_context() for crossing execution boundaries</strong>: Needed when passing work to thread pools or process pools where context isn't auto-inherited.</p><p><strong>Thread pool workers start with blank context</strong>: New threads have no mechanism to inherit from the spawning task automatically.</p><p><strong>Context() creates isolated contexts</strong>: Run code in a fresh context without inheriting any ambient state.</p><p><strong>Context.run() executes in specific context</strong>: Run a function in a particular context without affecting the current one.</p><p><strong>Perfect for middleware patterns</strong>: Set up context once at request start, access everywhere in the call chain.</p><p><strong>Real frameworks use this extensively</strong>: FastAPI, OpenTelemetry, logging libraries all leverage context variables.</p><p>: Use context variables for ambient concerns, not core business logic dependencies.</p><p><strong>Explicit parameters are often better</strong>: For dependencies that don't need to flow through many layers.</p><p><strong>Dependency injection for complex deps</strong>: When you have many structured dependencies, DI frameworks work better.</p><p><strong>Module-level ContextVar creation</strong>: Create ContextVar objects once at module level, not repeatedly.</p><p><strong>Creating ContextVar repeatedly is wasteful</strong>: Each ContextVar is a permanent vault manager in Python's internal tracking system.</p><p><strong>Performance overhead is minimal</strong>: Slightly slower than parameters, but negligible in real applications.</p><p><strong>Test isolation is important</strong>: Context variables can make testing harder; provide ways to override them in tests.</p><p><strong>Use for cross-cutting concerns</strong>: Request IDs, trace IDs, user identity, logging context.</p><p>: Just because you can put something in context doesn't mean you should.</p><p><strong>Context managers integrate well</strong>: Use  for setup/teardown patterns.</p><p><strong>Correlation IDs for distributed tracing</strong>: Pass correlation IDs through service boundaries to maintain traces.</p><p><strong>Libraries like structlog leverage this</strong>: Many modern logging libraries use context variables for structured logging.</p><p><strong>Thread pools need explicit context</strong>: Unlike async tasks, thread pool workers don't automatically inherit context.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Understanding Context Variable Patterns\n</h2><p>Timothy had learned how to use context variables in production systems.</p><p>He discovered that tokens enable safe temporary modifications with automatic restoration, that copy_context() is essential when crossing execution boundaries like thread pools where context isn't automatically inherited, and that Context.run() allows running code in completely isolated contexts.</p><p>Margaret showed him that real frameworks use context variables for request tracking, distributed tracing, and logging context, that middleware patterns benefit enormously from context variables, and that they enable clean APIs where ambient state flows automatically without explicit parameter passing.</p><p>Most importantly, Timothy learned when NOT to use context variables—that explicit parameters and dependency injection are often better for core business logic, that context variables should be reserved for truly ambient, cross-cutting concerns, and that overuse can make code harder to understand and test.</p><p>The library closed for the evening. Timothy had mastered context variables and was ready to build production-grade async applications with proper request tracking, distributed tracing, and context-aware logging—all without cluttering function signatures with repeated parameters.</p>","contentLength":13873,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Talk to Your Data Like a Human: How I Built an AI Airline Analyst","url":"https://dev.to/rajesh-adk-137/talk-to-your-data-like-a-human-how-i-built-an-ai-airline-analyst-4pl9","date":1761862409,"author":"Rajesh Adhikari","guid":322389,"unread":true,"content":"<p>In the world of air travel, every passenger has a story.

It handles the rest.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Meet AIRLYTICS: Your AI Airline Analyst\n</h2><p>AIRLYTICS is what happens when you combine MindsDB's Knowledge Bases with a dual-agent architecture and sprinkle in some serious semantic search magic.</p><p>Here's what makes it different.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  🧠 Two Modes, One Seamless Experience\n</h3><p>Most analytics platforms force you to choose between simplicity and power. AIRLYTICS gives you both.</p><p> is perfect when you're exploring. Type something like <em>\"excellent legroom and comfortable seats\"</em> or <em>\"lost baggage and delayed luggage\"</em> and boom — the system surfaces the most relevant reviews using vector embeddings. Not just keyword matching. Real semantic understanding. The kind that knows \"mishandled bag\" and \"lost luggage\" mean the same thing.</p><p>You get the top 50 matched reviews, plus comprehensive statistics: average ratings across every dimension, seat type distributions, traveler demographics, correlation matrices showing which metrics actually drive satisfaction. It's like having a full statistical report generated in seconds, tailored exactly to your query.</p><p> is where things get interesting. This is for questions like <em>\"Among users complaining about check-in delays, show me seat type distribution for those who still rated ground service above 3.\"</em></p><p>That's not a simple search. That's a multi-layered analytical question. The AI agent interprets your intent, figures out you're asking for a conditional distribution analysis, rewrites your query for optimal semantic matching, executes the right statistical function, and returns targeted visualizations with contextual explanations.</p><p>All from one sentence. No SQL. No setup. Just ask.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  The Secret Sauce: Five Intelligent Functions\n</h2><p>Behind the scenes, AIRLYTICS uses five specialized analytical engines. When you ask a complex question, the agent automatically routes it to the right one:</p><p><strong>General Percentage Distribution</strong> handles questions like <em>\"What percentage of passengers rated value for money above 4?\"</em> — fast, simple threshold checks across any numeric field.</p><p><strong>Conditional Distribution Analysis</strong> shows you breakdowns like <em>\"For delayed passengers, what's the seat type distribution?\"</em> — perfect for understanding how issues vary across categories.</p><p><strong>Category-to-Category Analysis</strong> compares two categorical fields, like <em>\"How many Economy passengers were Solo Leisure versus Business travelers?\"</em> — great for demographic pivots.</p><p><strong>Rating-to-Rating Analysis</strong> finds overlaps between numeric conditions, like <em>\"Of passengers with low Wi-Fi scores, how many also rated overall experience poorly?\"</em> — the correlation detective.</p><p><strong>Conditional Rating Analysis</strong> connects ratings to outcomes, like <em>\"Among high food raters, what percent still recommended the airline?\"</em> — revealing those crucial loyalty disconnects.</p><p>The beautiful part? You never have to know which function does what. Just ask your question naturally. The agent figures it out.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Smart Sampling: Why Less is More\n</h2><p>Here's something cool about AIRLYTICS that most analytics platforms get wrong.</p><p>It doesn't analyze all 20,000 reviews for every query. That would be slow, expensive, and frankly, unnecessary. Instead, it uses .</p><p>Every query retrieves the top N semantically matched reviews — you can choose 10, 20, 50, 75, or 100 (MindsDB's current limit). All statistics, distributions, and correlations are computed from this focused subset.</p><p>Why does this matter? Because when you ask about Wi-Fi complaints, you don't need reviews about excellent meals. You need the 100 most relevant Wi-Fi-related reviews. That's your representative sample. That's where your signal lives.</p><p>It's faster, more focused, and statistically just as valid. Plus, it means every metric you see is actually  what you asked for, not diluted by thousands of unrelated reviews.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  InsightInterpreter: Your AI Strategist\n</h2><p>Raw numbers are useful. Strategic recommendations are invaluable.</p><p>That's why AIRLYTICS includes  — think of it as your in-house AI consultant who's allergic to corporate buzzwords and loves cutting through noise.</p><p>After any query, hit the \"Get AI Insights\" button. InsightInterpreter looks at your results — the distributions, correlations, top reviews, all of it — and tells you what actually matters.</p><p>Not </p><p>But <em>\"Wi-Fi below 3 stars drops overall satisfaction by 68%. Upgrade routers on long-haul routes — it impacts loyalty more than catering.\"</em></p><p>Not <em>\"Business travelers rate cleanliness at 6.2.\"</em></p><p>But <em>\"Business travelers forgive delays but hate dirty cabins. Prioritize cleaning staff over gate efficiency.\"</em></p><p>It spots contradictions (high ratings, low loyalty — what gives?), identifies root causes (it's not the food, it's the pricing), and suggests concrete next steps. All written in the voice of a seasoned analyst who knows that real insight is the difference between a refund and a repeat customer.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Rich Metadata Filtering: Slice and Dice Your Way\n</h2><p>AIRLYTICS supports filtering across every structured dimension in your data.</p><p>Want to see only Emirates Business Class reviews? Done. Need verified Solo Leisure travelers on long-haul flights? Easy. Looking for passengers who rated Wi-Fi below 3 but overall experience above 7? No problem.</p><p>You've got 50+ airlines, multiple aircraft types, four seat classes, different traveler types, verification flags, recommendation status, and eight numeric rating fields to work with. Mix and match however you want.</p><p>Every filter applies to both semantic searches and analytical queries. The system handles it seamlessly in the background.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Building AIRLYTICS: The MindsDB Magic\n</h2><p>So how does all this actually work?</p><p>At its core, AIRLYTICS is powered by three MindsDB components working in perfect harmony.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Knowledge Bases: The Foundation\n</h3><p>MindsDB Knowledge Bases are what make semantic search possible. Instead of storing just text, they store  — vector embeddings that capture the semantic essence of each review.</p><p>When you search for \"bad food and poor service,\" the Knowledge Base doesn't just match those exact words. It finds reviews about \"terrible meals and rude staff,\" \"cold food and unhelpful crew,\" or \"worst dining experience and slow service.\" It understands synonyms, context, and intent.</p><p>Plus, it respects structured metadata. You can search semantically  filter by airline, seat type, ratings — all in one query. That's the hybrid power MindsDB brings to the table.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  The Analytics Agent: The Interpreter\n</h3><p>This is where things get really clever.</p><p>The  is trained to understand natural language questions and break them down into two parts:</p><p> The semantic filter — <em>what kind of reviews should we look at?</em> The analytical question — <em>what measurement or comparison do we want?</em></p><p>If only Part 1 exists, it's a straightforward semantic search. If both parts exist, the agent maps Part 2 to one of the five analytical functions, extracts the right parameters (which fields, what thresholds, which operators), and returns everything as structured JSON.</p><p>All you had to do was ask a question in plain English.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  The Insight Agent: The Strategist\n</h3><p>The <strong>insight_interpreter_agent</strong> is your executive translator.</p><p>It takes the raw analytics output — the numbers, distributions, top reviews — and interprets them through the lens of airline operations strategy. It's trained to spot patterns, identify contradictions, connect dots between seemingly unrelated metrics, and recommend concrete actions.</p><p>It doesn't just describe what it sees. It explains what it  and what you should  about it.</p><p>Here's a tiny peek at its prompt philosophy:</p><div><pre><code>You are InsightInterpreter — the sharp data analyst inside an airline's analytics division.\nYour job: Cut through the noise and tell the manager something they didn't already know.\nFocus on contradictions, unexpected drivers, and actionable next steps.\n\nRules:\n1. No recaps. Don't restate the query.\n2. No fluff. Skip \"The data shows...\"\n3. Be concrete. Use actual numbers when they matter.\n4. Stay tight. 2-3 paragraphs, max.\n5. End with action. Always tell what should be done differently.\n</code></pre></div><p>That's it. Sharp, focused, actionable. Every time.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Beyond Airlines: A Blueprint for Any Feedback Domain\n</h2><p>Here's the thing — while AIRLYTICS is built for airline reviews, the architecture is a .</p><p>The same approach works for:</p><p>🏨  — guest reviews, amenity feedback, service ratings — delivery experiences, menu feedback, ambiance comments — product reviews, shopping experiences, return issues — patient satisfaction, appointment experiences, facility feedback — ticket descriptions, call transcripts, chat logs</p><p>Anywhere you have unstructured feedback with structured metadata, this pattern applies. Swap the schema, prepare the agents on domain-specific language, and you're off to the races.</p><p>That's the power of MindsDB's Knowledge Bases. They're not industry-specific. They're .</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Real-World Impact: What This Means for Airlines\n</h2><p>Let's get practical for a second.</p><p>Imagine you're an airline ops manager. You know Wi-Fi complaints are up, but you don't know if it's a dealbreaker or just noise. You type:</p><p><em>\"Users who complained about baggage claim delays — what percentage of those who rated ground service above 4 rated overall experience below 5?\"</em></p><ul><li>42% of users with good ground service ratings still had poor overall experiences</li><li>A breakdown by seat type showing Business Class is disproportionately affected</li><li>A correlation heatmap revealing that baggage issues matter 3× more than food quality for Business travelers</li><li>An InsightInterpreter note: <em>\"Baggage delays hit Business travelers hardest. They pay premium prices for time — not food. Fast-track baggage handling for premium cabins immediately.\"</em></li></ul><p>You just went from a hunch to a prioritized action plan in seconds.</p><p>That's what conversational analytics looks like. And that's what AIRLYTICS delivers.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  The Tech Behind the Magic\n</h2><p>For the curious: AIRLYTICS is built with React and TailwindCSS on the frontend, FastAPI on the backend, and MindsDB handling all the AI heavy lifting. Data flows from Google Sheets straight into MindsDB's Knowledge Base — zero ETL pipelines, zero data warehouses.</p><p>Docker Compose keeps MindsDB containerized for local development. OpenAI's embeddings power the semantic search. Recharts and Plotly handle visualizations. The whole stack is designed to be clean, modular, and production-ready.</p><p>Want to set it up yourself? The full installation guide, architecture diagrams, and SQL examples are all in the . Everything you need to get it running locally or extend it to your own domain.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Hacktoberfest 2025: Built for Advanced Capabilities\n</h2><p>AIRLYTICS was designed for <strong>MindsDB Hacktoberfest Track 2: Advanced Capabilities</strong>. That means it checks all the boxes:</p><p>✅ Knowledge Base integration with 20,000+ reviews<p>\n✅ Dual-agent architecture (analytics + insights)</p><p>\n✅ Metadata filtering across multiple dimensions</p><p>\n✅ Hybrid search capabilities (semantic + structured)</p><p>\n✅ Automated data freshness with MindsDB Jobs</p><p>\n✅ Zero-ETL architecture (Google Sheets → MindsDB direct)</p></p><p>But beyond the checklist, it's a <strong>complete RAG-to-BI pipeline</strong>. Not a toy demo. Not a proof of concept. A production-grade analytics engine that shows what's possible when you combine semantic understanding, statistical rigor, and AI interpretation.</p><p>Curious to see AIRLYTICS in action?</p><p>Clone it. Run it. Break it. Extend it to your own domain. The entire codebase is open source and ready to go.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  The Future of Analytics is Conversational\n</h2><p>Here's what I learned building AIRLYTICS:</p><p>The future of business intelligence isn't about building more dashboards. It's about building systems that , , and . All in natural language. All in real-time.</p><p>MindsDB's Knowledge Bases make that possible. Their agent architecture makes it scalable. And the zero-ETL approach makes it practical.</p><p>Whether you're analyzing airline reviews, hotel feedback, or customer support tickets, the pattern is the same: semantic understanding + statistical rigor + AI interpretation = actionable intelligence.</p><p>The age of asking your data questions and getting strategic answers has arrived.</p><p>And it's powered by MindsDB.</p><p>Huge thanks to the MindsDB team for creating such a powerful platform, OpenAI for the embedding models, and the entire open-source community for the tools that made this possible.</p><p>Built with ❤️ for MindsDB Hacktoberfest 2025.</p><p><strong>AIRLYTICS: Transforming unstructured feedback into strategic intelligence, one query at a time.</strong></p><p><em>Ready to unlock intelligence from your own feedback data?

When your agent visits a website to gather information, complete a form, or verify data, it encounters the same defenses designed to stop unwanted bots: CAPTCHAs, rate limits, and outright blocks.</p><p>Today, we are excited to share that AWS has a solution. <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock-agentcore/latest/devguide/browser-tool.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Amazon Bedrock AgentCore Browser</a>, our secure, cloud-based browser for AI agents to interact with websites, now supports Web Bot Auth (in preview), a draft IETF protocol that gives agents verifiable cryptographic identities.</p><p>Customers tell us that CAPTCHA friction is one of the biggest obstacles to reliable browser-based agentic workflows. Your agent halts mid-task, waiting for human intervention to solve a puzzle that proves you’re not a bot – except your agent is a bot, and that’s the point. CAPTCHAs exist for good reason. Websites face constant challenges protecting their content, inventory and reviews. Web Application Firewalls (WAFs) and bot detection services protect these sites, but they treat nearly all automated traffic as suspicious because they have no reliable way to distinguish legitimate agents from malicious ones.</p><p>Some automation providers try to solve CAPTCHAs programmatically – using computer vision models to read distorted text or clicking through image grids until the puzzle clears. This approach is brittle, expensive, and is bypassing controls that domain owners intended for their content. Other approaches rely on IP allowlists or User-Agent strings. IP allowlists break when you run agents in cloud environments where addresses change frequently. User-Agent strings can be spoofed by anyone, so they provide no verification, and pose a risk of people emulating well trusted strings. Both methods require manual coordination with every website you want to access, which does not scale.</p><h2>Web Bot Auth: Cryptographic identity for agents browsing the web</h2><p>Web Bot Auth is a <a href=\"https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-meunier-web-bot-auth-architecture\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">draft IETF protocol</a> that gives agents verifiable cryptographic identities. When you enable Web Bot Auth in AgentCore Browser, we issue cryptographic credentials that websites can verify. The agent presents these credentials with every request. The WAF may now additionally check the signature, confirm it matches a trusted directory, and allow the request through if verified bots are allowed by the domain owner and other WAF checks are clear.</p><p>AgentCore is working with <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Cloudflare</a>, <a href=\"https://www.humansecurity.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">HUMAN Security</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.akamai.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Akamai Technologies</a> to support this verification flow. These providers protect millions of websites. When you create an AgentCore Browser with signing enabled in the configuration, we automatically register your agent’s signature directory with these providers. Many domains already configure their WAFs to allow verified bots by default, which means you can see immediate CAPTCHA reduction without additional setup in the cases that this happens.</p><h2>How domain owners control access</h2><p>WAF providers give website owners three levels of control using Web Bot Auth:</p><ul><li>– Some sites choose to block automated traffic entirely. Web Bot Auth does not bypass this – if a domain wants no automation, that choice is respected.</li><li> – Many domains configure their WAF to allow any bot that presents a valid cryptographic signature. This is the default policy for a growing number of sites protected by Cloudflare, HUMAN Security, and Akamai Technologies. When you enable signing, as a parameter in the AgentCore Browser configuration, this policy will apply to your agents.</li><li><strong>Allow specific verified bots to conduct only specific actions</strong> – For example, a financial services company automating vendor portal access can share its unique directory with those vendors. The vendor can create rules like “allow FinCo agents at 100 requests per minute, don’t allow them to create new accounts, and block all other signed agents.” This gives websites granular control while preserving the benefits of cryptographic verification.</li></ul><p>Today’s preview release of Web Both Auth support in AgentCore Browser helps reduce friction with CAPTCHAs on domains that allow verified bots, by making your agent appear as a verified bot. Once the Web Bot Auth protocol is finalized, AgentCore intends to transition to customer-specific keys, so AgentCore users can use the tier of control that allows only specified verified bots.</p><h2>Using the Web Bot Auth protocol</h2><p>To enable the browser to sign requests using the Web Bot Auth protocol, create a browser tool with the  configuration:</p><div><pre><code>import boto3\ncp_client = boto3.client('bedrock-agentcore-control')\nresponse = cp_client.create_browser(\n    name=\"signed_browser\",\n    description=\"Browser tool with Web Bot Auth enabled\",\n    networkConfiguration={\n        \"networkMode\": \"PUBLIC\"\n    },\n    executionRoleArn=\"arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/AgentCoreExecutionRole\",\n    browserSigning={\n        \"enabled\": True\n    }\n)\nbrowserId = response['browserId']\n</code></pre></div><p>Pass the browser identifier to your agent framework. Here is an example using Strands Agents:</p><div><pre><code>from strands import Agent\nfrom strands_tools.browser import AgentCoreBrowser\nagent_core_browser = AgentCoreBrowser(\n    region=\"us-west-2\",\n    identifier=browserId\n)\nstrands_agent = Agent(\n    tools=[agent_core_browser.browser],\n    model=\"anthropic.claude-4-5-haiku-20251001-v1:0\",\n    system_prompt=\"You are a website analyst. Use the browser tool efficiently.\"\n)\nresult = strands_agent(\"Analyze the website at &lt;https://example.com/&gt;\")\n</code></pre></div><p>The agent is now configured to use the new browser tool that signs every HTTP request. Websites protected by Cloudflare, HUMAN Security, or Akamai Technologies can verify the signature and allow the request through without presenting a CAPTCHA, if the domain owner allows verified bots.</p><p>The Web Bot Auth protocol is gaining industry momentum because it solves a real problem: legitimate automation is indistinguishable from abuse without verifiable identity. You can read the draft protocol specification, <a href=\"https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-meunier-web-bot-auth-architecture\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">HTTP Message Signatures for automated traffic Architecture</a>. The architecture defines how agents generate signatures, how WAFs verify them, and how key directories enable discovery. <a href=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/agent-registry\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Amazon is working with Cloudflare</a> and many popular WAF providers to help finalize the customer-specific key directory format and work towards finalizing the draft.</p><p>Amazon Bedrock AgentCore Browser is generally available, with the Web Bot Auth feature available in preview. AgentCore Browser signing requests using the Web Bot Auth protocol help reduce friction with CAPTCHA across domains that allow verified bots. As the protocol finalizes, AgentCore Browser intends to issue customer-specific keys and directories, so you can prove your agent’s identity to specific websites and establish trust relationships directly with the domains you need to access.</p><p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/f1f836cb4ea6efb2a0b1b99f41ad8b103eff4b59/2025/10/29/vedashrr.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"100\" height=\"133\"><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/vedashreeraman/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"></a> is a Senior Specialist Solutions Architect for generative AI and machine learning at AWS.

By the time any task resumes, the shared thread-local storage holds 'def456'—the last value written.\"</p><div><pre><code>Threading model (thread-local works):\n┌──────────────┐  ┌──────────────┐  ┌──────────────┐\n│   Thread 1   │  │   Thread 2   │  │   Thread 3   │\n│  request_id  │  │  request_id  │  │  request_id  │\n│  = \"abc123\"  │  │  = \"xyz789\"  │  │  = \"def456\"  │\n└──────────────┘  └──────────────┘  └──────────────┘\n     ✓ Isolated      ✓ Isolated       ✓ Isolated\n\nAsync model (thread-local fails):\n┌────────────────────────────────────────────────┐\n│              Single Thread                     │\n│  ┌──────────┐  ┌──────────┐  ┌──────────┐      │\n│  │ Task abc │  │ Task xyz │  │ Task def │      │\n│  └──────────┘  └──────────┘  └──────────┘      │\n│         thread_local.request_id = \"def456\"     │\n│         (All tasks see the same storage!)      │\n└────────────────────────────────────────────────┘\n     ✗ Not isolated - they all see \"def456\"!\n</code></pre></div><p>\"So thread-local doesn't work for async,\" Timothy said. \"What's the solution?\"</p><p>Margaret smiled. \"Python 3.7 added exactly what we need: context variables. They work like thread-local storage, but they're aware of async tasks.\"</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><div><pre><code>[INFO] Processing request abc123: Starting checkout\n[INFO] Processing request xyz789: Starting checkout\n[INFO] Processing request def456: Starting checkout\n[INFO] Processing request abc123: User verification\n[INFO] Processing request xyz789: User verification\n[INFO] Processing request def456: User verification\n[INFO] Processing request abc123: Database query\n[INFO] Processing request xyz789: Database query\n[INFO] Processing request def456: Database query\n\nResults: ['Request abc123 complete', 'Request xyz789 complete', 'Request def456 complete']\n</code></pre></div><p>\"Perfect!\" Timothy exclaimed. \"Each request keeps its own ID throughout the entire async call chain!\"</p><p>\"That's the magic of context variables,\" Margaret said. \"Each async task gets its own isolated context. The context variable remembers which task is running and gives each one its own value.\"</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  How Context Variables Work\n</h2><p>Timothy looked at the code carefully. \"So  creates a... variable? That somehow knows which task is accessing it?\"</p><p>\"Think of it like a vault,\" Margaret said, pulling out her notepad. \"Not a single box, but a whole vault system with separate compartments.\"</p><div><pre><code>The Context Variable Vault:\n\nGlobal scope:\n  request_id_var (the vault manager)\n           ↓\n  ┌───────┴────────┬────────────┬────────────┐\n  │                │            │            │\nTask abc123    Task xyz789  Task def456   Main task\n  Context        Context      Context      Context\n┌─────────┐    ┌─────────┐  ┌─────────┐  ┌─────────┐\n│ req_id  │    │ req_id  │  │ req_id  │  │ req_id  │\n│\"abc123\" │    │\"xyz789\" │  │\"def456\" │  │\"unknown\"│\n└─────────┘    └─────────┘  └─────────┘  └─────────┘\n\nEach task has its own compartment in the vault!\n</code></pre></div><p>\"When you call <code>request_id_var.set('abc123')</code>, you're not setting a global value,\" Margaret explained. \"You're setting the value <em>in the current task's context</em>. When you call , you retrieve the value from the current task's context.\"</p><p>\"So it's like each task has its own namespace for context variables?\" Timothy asked.</p><p>\"Exactly. And here's the beautiful part: contexts are automatically created and managed by Python. When you , Python creates a separate context for each task. You don't have to manage any of that.\"</p><p>\"One small detail,\" Margaret added. \"When you call , it actually returns a Token object. We're ignoring it here, but it's important for advanced patterns—if you need to temporarily change a value and then restore it, you use that Token with . We'll cover that in the next article.\"</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  The Anatomy of a Context Variable\n</h2><p>Margaret created a more detailed example:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><div><pre><code>Task 100: user_id=100, token=token_100, count=1\nTask 200: user_id=200, token=token_200, count=1\nTask 300: user_id=300, token=token_300, count=1\nTask 100 after await: user_id=100, token=token_100, count=1\nTask 200 after await: user_id=200, token=token_200, count=1\nTask 300 after await: user_id=300, token=token_300, count=1\n\nMain context: user_id not set (raises LookupError - no default provided)\nMain context: token=anonymous, count=0\n</code></pre></div><p>\"Notice how each task's count is 1?\" Margaret pointed out. \"Each task incremented from the default value of 0. They didn't interfere with each other. And the main task never set , so it would raise  if we tried to get it without a try-except.\"</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Context Inheritance: The Vault's Secret\n</h2><p>\"Let me show you something subtle but important,\" Margaret said. She typed a new example:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><div><pre><code>Parent set config: parent_config\n  child1 sees config: parent_config\n  child1 changed config to: parent_config_modified_by_child1\n  child2 sees config: parent_config\n  child2 changed config to: parent_config_modified_by_child2\nParent after children: parent_config\n</code></pre></div><p>\"Wait,\" Timothy said, studying the output. \"The children  the parent's value, but when they modified it, the parent's value stayed the same?\"</p><p>\"Exactly!\" Margaret drew another diagram:</p><div><pre><code>Context Inheritance: Copy-on-Write\n\nParent Task creates context:\n┌─────────────────┐\n│ config: \"parent\"│\n└────────┬────────┘\n         │\n    ┌────┴────┐\n    │ spawn   │\n    └────┬────┘\n         │\n    ┌────┴─────────────┐\n    │                  │\nChild 1 Context    Child 2 Context\n(inherits copy)    (inherits copy)\n┌──────────────┐  ┌──────────────┐\n│config:       │  │config:       │\n│\"parent\"      │  │\"parent\"      │\n│              │  │              │\n│↓ .set()      │  │↓ .set()      │\n│\"parent_mod1\" │  │\"parent_mod2\" │\n└──────────────┘  └──────────────┘\n\nParent context unchanged!\n</code></pre></div><p>\"This is copy-on-write semantics,\" Margaret explained. \"When a child task is created, it inherits a  of the parent's context. Reading values works transparently. But when the child calls , it modifies its own copy, not the parent's.\"</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Context Variables with Threading\n</h2><p>\"Does this work with regular threading too?\" Timothy asked.</p><p>\"It does,\" Margaret said. \"Context variables work across both threading and async. Each thread gets its own context, just like each async task does.\"</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><div><pre><code>Main thread: worker_id=main_thread\nworker_0 starting: worker_id=worker_0\nworker_1 starting: worker_id=worker_1\nworker_2 starting: worker_id=worker_2\nworker_0 finishing: worker_id=worker_0\nworker_1 finishing: worker_id=worker_1\nworker_2 finishing: worker_id=worker_2\nMain thread after workers: worker_id=main_thread\n</code></pre></div><p>\"So context variables are like a universal solution,\" Timothy said. \"They work for async  threading. Each thread and each task gets its own context compartment.\"</p><p>\"Right. They're the modern Python way to handle execution-local state, whether you're using threads or async tasks.\"</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  When Context Variables Shine\n</h2><p>Margaret opened a new file. \"Let me show you a realistic example: building a logger that automatically includes request context.\"</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Timothy ran it and examined the output carefully:</p><div><pre><code>[14:23:15.123] [req_001] [anonymous] Request received\n[14:23:15.124] [req_002] [anonymous] Request received\n[14:23:15.125] [req_003] [anonymous] Request received\n[14:23:15.126] [req_001] [anonymous] Authenticating alice\n[14:23:15.126] [req_002] [anonymous] Authenticating bob\n[14:23:15.127] [req_003] [anonymous] Authenticating charlie\n[14:23:15.177] [req_001] [user_alice] Authentication successful\n[14:23:15.178] [req_002] [user_bob] Authentication successful\n[14:23:15.179] [req_003] [user_charlie] Authentication successful\n[14:23:15.180] [req_001] [user_alice] Fetching user data from database\n[14:23:15.181] [req_002] [user_bob] Fetching user data from database\n[14:23:15.182] [req_003] [user_charlie] Fetching user data from database\n[14:23:15.232] [req_001] [user_alice] User data retrieved\n[14:23:15.233] [req_002] [user_bob] User data retrieved\n[14:23:15.234] [req_003] [user_charlie] User data retrieved\n[14:23:15.235] [req_001] [user_alice] Request complete\n[14:23:15.236] [req_002] [user_bob] Request complete\n[14:23:15.237] [req_003] [user_charlie] Request complete\n</code></pre></div><p>\"Beautiful,\" Timothy said. \"Each request is perfectly tracked. And I didn't have to pass  and  as parameters to every single function.\"</p><p>\"That's the key benefit,\" Margaret said. \"Context variables let you establish ambient context that flows automatically through your call chain. You set it once at the top level, and it's available everywhere in that execution path.\"</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  The Default Value Pattern\n</h2><p>\"What about that  parameter?\" Timothy asked, pointing at the ContextVar definitions.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><div><pre><code>Config (has default): production\nError: &lt;ContextVar name='api_key' at 0x...&gt;\nAPI key with fallback: fallback_key\n</code></pre></div><p>\"If you provide a default when creating the ContextVar, that value is always available,\" Margaret explained. \"If you don't provide a default, calling  without setting a value first raises .\"</p><p>\"When would I want no default?\" Timothy asked.</p><p>\"When it's a programming error to read the variable before setting it. Like an API key that must be explicitly configured. The error helps catch bugs where you forgot to set the context.\"</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Understanding the Vault Metaphor\n</h2><p>They were approaching the library's closing time. Margaret summarized with a final diagram:</p><div><pre><code>The Context Variable Vault - Complete Picture:\n\n1.

The strange disconnect. On one screen, you have your IDE, a familiar landscape of files, terminals, and syntax highlighting. On another, a chat interface, where you coax an LLM into generating a function, a regex, or a boilerplate class. Then comes the clumsy ritual: the copy, the paste, the painstaking integration of that foreign code into your pristine local environment. It feels powerful, yet fragmented—like using a supercar to deliver pizza.</p><p>We are senior developers. We architect systems, we manage complexity, and we demand tools that match our workflow. The copy-paste dance isn’t it. We need an environment where the AI is not a consultant in another room, but a native partner sitting right beside us, with full context of our project.</p><p>Enter Cursor, an AI-native code editor that's more than just a Visual Studio Code fork with a chatbot bolted on. It’s an attempt to redefine the developer-AI interaction, moving from disjointed queries to a fluid, conversational development process. It's a style some have called \"vibe coding\"—a way to build, refactor, and debug through high-level intent rather than keystroke-by-keystroke implementation. This is the deep integration we’ve been waiting for.</p><p><strong>What is 'Vibe Coding' and Why Does Cursor Nail It?</strong>\n\"Vibe coding\" is a term that perfectly captures the shift from explicit instruction to articulating intent. It’s the difference between telling a junior dev, \"Declare a variable x, initialize it to 10, then start a for loop from 0 to 9...\" versus telling a senior colleague, \"I need a scalable function to process this data stream and handle retries.\"</p><p>Cursor is engineered for this latter type of conversation. It's built on the solid foundation of VS Code, so your muscle memory for shortcuts and extensions remains intact. But its core loop is fundamentally different. The AI is not a feature; it is the environment.</p><p>Imagine starting a new project. Instead of creating files manually, you open Cursor’s AI agent and say:</p><p><em>\"Create a classic snake game in Python using pygame. Generate a  with instructions and a  file for dependencies.\"</em></p><p>Within moments, Cursor doesn't just spew code into a chat window. It plans and executes. It creates the actual file structure in your project folder: , , and . You see the proposed code, accept it, and it becomes a tangible part of your project.</p><p>This is the first taste of true AI-native development. But the real magic lies in the iterative refinement. You run the game, and you think, \"It's a bit unforgiving. What if you didn't die when you hit the wall, but instead just wrapped around to the other side?\"</p><p>Instead of searching the code for the collision logic, you simply tell the agent your intent:</p><p><em>\"Change the game so the snake isn't game over if it hits the wall. Update the readme to reflect this new feature.\"</em></p><p>Cursor understands the context of the  file, identifies the relevant code blocks, proposes the changes, and even updates the documentation. This conversational flow—from initial creation to complex refactoring—is the essence of vibe coding. You can even take it a step further. Found a screenshot of a game UI you like? Upload it and prompt:</p><p><em>\"I want my snake game to look like this. Please make it happen.\"</em></p><p>The AI will analyze the image and generate the code to replicate the colors, layout, and style elements. This is a workflow that feels less like programming and more like directing a highly competent assistant.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  A Practical Framework for Your First Cursor Project\n</h2><p>To harness this power without creating chaos, you need a disciplined approach. Spontaneity is great, but structure is what ships products. Here's a simple, memorable framework to get started.</p><p><strong>The Sandbox-to-Structure Framework</strong></p><p><strong>Step 1: The Sandbox - Isolate Your Environment</strong>\nThis might sound basic, but it's non-negotiable. Before writing a single prompt, create a new, empty folder for your project on your local machine. In Cursor, use  to open it. Why is this so critical? The AI agent will be creating, modifying, and potentially deleting files. By starting in a clean, dedicated directory (, for example), you give the agent a safe sandbox to work in, ensuring your existing work is untouched and all new files are neatly organized.</p><p><strong>Step 2: The Blueprint - Plan Your Intent</strong>\nVibe coding can feel like a jam session, but the best music comes from a plan. Before you start prompting, have a clear, high-level idea of what you want to build. What are the core features? What files will you need? A small plan prevents rambling prompts that lead to a tangled mess of code.</p><p><strong>Step 3: The Conversation - Initiate with the Agent</strong>\nOn Windows or Linux, press  (or  on Mac) to bring up the AI chat panel on the right. This is your primary interface. Start with your high-level goal, as we did with the snake game. Notice how Cursor plans its actions, telling you which files it will create before it writes them. This transparency is crucial for maintaining control.</p><p><strong>Step 4: The Execution - From Code to Reality</strong>\nOnce Cursor generates the files (, ), you must explicitly accept them. This is your chance to review the code before it becomes permanent. After accepting, open the integrated terminal ( or the corresponding shortcut). The  will likely contain the next steps. Follow them.</p><div><pre><code># Install the necessary packages\npip install -r requirements.txt\n\n# Run the application\npython snake_game.py\n</code></pre></div><p>Your application comes to life, running in the environment you set up, all within a single window.</p><p><strong>Step 5: The Refinement Loop - Iterate with </strong>\nThis is the micro-loop of vibe coding. To edit a specific part of your code, simply highlight the lines you want to change and press  ( on Mac). An inline chat box appears, scoped to just that selection.</p><p>Want to change the game board size? Highlight the constants:</p><div><pre><code>WINDOW_WIDTH = 800\nWINDOW_HEIGHT = 600\n</code></pre></div><p>Press  and type: \"Make the field bigger, 1200 by 900.\"</p><p>Don't understand a piece of code? Highlight it, press , and ask: \"What does this code do? Explain it line by line.\"</p><p>This tight, contextual feedback loop allows for rapid prototyping, learning, and refactoring without ever leaving your code file.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  How Do You Connect Your Codebase to the Outside World with MCP?\n</h2><p>So far, we've built an application in a self-contained universe. The next level of integration is connecting our IDE to external services, allowing the AI to read your emails, update your calendar, or query a database. This is where the <strong>Model Context Protocol (MCP)</strong> comes in.</p><p>MCP is a specification that aims to create a standardized way for LLMs to interact with tools and data sources. Think of it as an API for AI context. Cursor acts as an MCP client, and you can connect it to any MCP-compliant server.</p><p>Let's make this tangible by connecting Cursor to the vast ecosystem of Zapier.</p><p>First, you'll need a Zapier MCP server.</p><ol><li>Navigate to Zapier's AI Actions page and create a \"New MCP Server.\"</li><li>Give it a name (e.g., ) and select \"Cursor\" as the client.</li><li>Click \"Add Tools\" and connect your accounts. Let's add , <code>google_sheets.create_spreadsheet</code>, and <code>google_calendar.create_detailed_event</code>.</li><li>Once configured, go to the \"Connect\" tab. Zapier will provide you with a configuration snippet containing a unique URL. <strong>Treat this URL like a password</strong>. Anyone who has it can use your connected tools on your behalf.</li></ol><p>Now, integrate this into Cursor:</p><ol><li>Go to <code>File -&gt; Preferences -&gt; Cursor Settings</code>.</li><li>Navigate to the  section and click \"Add New Global MCP Server.\"</li><li>This opens an  file. Paste the configuration from Zapier. It will look something like this:\n</li></ol><div><pre><code>{\n  \"zapier\": {\n    \"mcp_server\": {\n      \"url\": \"https://actions.zapier.com/mcp/v1/servers/YOUR_UNIQUE_ID/...\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n</code></pre></div><p>Save the file (). Back in the settings UI, you'll see the Zapier connection turn green, and all your configured tools will be listed. You've just given your code editor superpowers.</p><p>Now, from the AI chat panel, you can say:</p><p>\"Create a Google Sheet named 'MCP Course Tasks' with three columns: 'Task', 'Status', and 'Deadline'.\"</p><p>Cursor will plan the action, ask for your permission, and execute it using the Zapier MCP connection. It will even return a link to the newly created sheet.</p><p>A word of caution: with great power comes the need for great vigilance. In testing, a prompt like \"create an event for me on 05/06\" might be interpreted as June 5th by the LLM, not May 6th. The model can and will make mistakes. Always review the plan before confirming an action, especially when it has real-world consequences. Avoid the temptation to enable any \"YOLO mode\" that bypasses these confirmations until you are supremely confident in your setup.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  What's the Real Cost? Managing API Keys and Budgets\n</h2><p>Cursor offers a generous free plan and paid subscriptions that abstract away the cost of AI usage. However, for maximum control, flexibility, and to use models not included in the standard plans, you'll want to bring your own API key. This puts you in charge of the bill, which requires a professional approach to cost management.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  The Three Pillars of API Management\n</h2><p><strong>Pillar 1: Sourcing - Choosing Your Provider</strong>\nWhile platforms like OpenRouter and Anthropic offer compelling APIs, the OpenAI platform remains a robust and common choice. Creating an account is the first step.</p><p><strong>Pillar 2: Cost Control - Understanding the Bill</strong>\nUsing an API key means you pay per token. To avoid surprise bills, you must understand the pricing.</p><ul><li>: As of late 2024, models like  are incredibly cost-effective for coding tasks, costing just 0.15foronemillioninputtokensand0.60 for one million output tokens. For context, one million tokens is roughly 750,000 words. You can accomplish a massive amount of development for just a few dollars.</li><li>: In your OpenAI account's billing dashboard, you can set both soft limits (which send you an email alert) and hard limits (which cut off API access) on a monthly basis. This is your most important safety net. Set a low hard limit (20−40) to start.</li></ul><p><strong>Pillar 3: Security - Scoping Your Keys</strong>\nNever use a single, all-powerful API key for every project.</p><ol><li>: In the OpenAI dashboard, create a new project for each major application (e.g., ).</li><li>: Within that project, create a new secret key. Give it a descriptive name. This key is now tied to that project's usage, making it easy to track costs and revoke access if compromised.</li><li>: Once you generate a key, copy it immediately and store it securely. You will never be able to see it again through the OpenAI dashboard. It's also good practice to rotate your keys periodically by revoking old ones and creating new ones.</li></ol><p>For developers in Europe, create your projects in the  region to ensure your data is processed within the EU, aligning with GDPR and providing zero data retention by default.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Where Are the Current Boundaries?\n</h2><p>Expertise isn't just knowing what a tool can do; it's knowing what it can't do. Cursor's implementation of the Model Context Protocol is powerful but, as of now, incomplete.</p><p>Currently, <strong>Cursor only supports the  capability of MCP</strong>.</p><p>This means it excels at executing actions via external APIs, as demonstrated with Zapier. However, other crucial parts of the MCP spec—such as  (providing large documents for context),  (reusable prompt templates), and  (finding new tools)—are not yet implemented.</p><p>This is not a deal-breaker, but it is a critical limitation for anyone designing a sophisticated, multi-client workflow. You cannot, for instance, have Cursor automatically pull context from a server-side document resource via MCP. You would have to provide that context manually through other means, like the  symbol in chat to reference local files. Be aware of this boundary and keep an eye on Cursor’s documentation, as this is likely to evolve.</p><p>The transition to AI-native development is happening now. Tools like Cursor are moving us beyond the fractured workflow of the past into an era of deep, contextual integration. We've explored how to master this new paradigm: by embracing \"vibe coding\" within a structured framework, connecting our editor to the world with MCP, and responsibly managing the underlying API infrastructure.</p><p>The core lesson is this: learning is about changing your behavior. If you've never coded this way before, you've only truly learned if you install Cursor, create that first project, and try to build something, even a simple snake game. Play with it. Break it. Understand its power and its limits.</p><p>The era of the AI-native developer is here. The question is no longer if AI will be part of our workflow, but how deeply we can integrate it.

I initially saw this in the TODO section in README.md but found no related issue in the repo, so I posted an issue regarding this feature and started working on it.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Process of adding new feature\n</h3><p>The output worksheets are in pdf format, generated by fpdf library in Python. As I have never used this library before, I have to first read documentation on fpdf library to get the basic idea of how it works, in order to implement the new feature of adding a new page. While I was planning on how to add the name/date/score fields on the front page, I also realized that it would make sense to have a title too, so I decided to add a default title to the front page, and implement a  option to the tool to allow customized title by user. After clearly stating my planning about the new feature in the <a href=\"https://github.com/januschung/math-worksheet-generator/issues/51\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">issue</a>, I started implementing the new feature while trying to stick to the original coding style. At last, I updated the README.md to add instruction for using the new  option, replaced the sample-worksheet.pdf with the new one with a front page, and made a <a href=\"https://github.com/januschung/math-worksheet-generator/pull/52\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">pull request</a>.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Lesson learnt and future planning\n</h3><p>Through working on this pull request, I have become more comfortable working with tools that I am not familiar with, such as the fpdf library this time. I realized that we don't have to fully understand everything about a tool to use it, instead, we should focus on the parts we are interested in, which would be enough for us to utilize the tools. I've also learnt the importance of having a flexible coding style, such that the codes written would be consistent to whatever projects I'm working on.

Ever wonder why your neural network seems to randomly stall, even with massive datasets? The problem might not be your data, but the training algorithm itself.</p><p>Deep down, training a neural network is about finding the lowest point in a complex, multi-dimensional landscape – the loss function. We often assume this landscape is a tangled mess of hills and valleys (non-convex), requiring advanced techniques like adaptive learning rates. But what if, as we get closer to the optimal solution, the landscape actually  into a nice, manageable bowl (convex)?</p><p>This idea suggests a powerful new approach: start with a robust, general-purpose optimizer designed for non-convex regions, and then, when the landscape starts to resemble a convex function, switch to a more specialized, faster optimizer that excels at convex optimization. This switch happens when the gradient of the loss decreases smoothly, signaling a potential shift in the loss function's convexity.</p><p><strong>Benefits of Convexity Switching:</strong></p><ul><li> Leverage the speed of convex optimizers when they're most effective.</li><li> Avoid getting stuck in suboptimal, non-convex local minima.</li><li><strong>Reduced Hyperparameter Tuning:</strong> The adaptive nature of the algorithm reduces reliance on manual parameter adjustments.</li><li> Finding smoother, more stable minima can improve the model's ability to generalize to unseen data.</li><li><strong>Potential for Explainability:</strong> Analyzing the switch point can provide insights into the network's learning process. Imagine it as your car deciding whether to engage cruise control -- the smoothness of the road (loss function) dictates the decision.</li></ul><p><strong>Implementation Challenge:</strong> Detecting the precise moment to switch optimization algorithms is key. Too early, and you'll miss the benefits of the initial non-convex optimizer. Too late, and you'll waste time wandering in the non-convex wilderness. A practical tip is to monitor the ratio of the change in the loss to the magnitude of the gradient. A consistent upward trend indicates a possible convex region.</p><p>This approach could revolutionize how we train neural networks, unlocking new levels of performance and, potentially, offering clues into the mysterious inner workings of these complex systems. The next step is to experiment with different switching criteria and convex optimizers to fine-tune this powerful technique for various deep learning tasks.

In this post, we’ll explore what it means for a KNN model to fit “just right” — not too tight, not too loose — and how we can visualize that balance in action.</p><p>There are three terms to be familiar with when discussing model fit:</p><ul><li>: a model is able to make accurate predictions on unseen data, i.e. it is able to generalize from the training set to the test set</li><li>: a model is fit too strictly to the training set, including its noise and outliers, making it perform poorly on new data</li><li>: a model is fit too loosely / simply and can't capture the underlying patterns in the training data, so it also performs poorly on new data</li></ul><p>A model that is  is the goal of model training.

However, the reasons for this failure are different and the methods to fix it are different.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Taking Model Measurements\n</h2><p>Before you tailor anything, you need good measurements. Here, those “measurements” come from our dataset, our preprocessing, and our choice of model parameters. We’ll prepare the data, define our helper functions, and run KNN models across a range of neighbor values to see how the fit changes.</p><p>Just like in the last post, we'll train KNN models using a number of neighbors ranging from 2 - 100. Why 100? Because this range covers the full spectrum from overfit to generalizable to underfit.</p><p>I picked accuracy as the single performance metric to use. From the <a href=\"https://dev.to/julielinx/evaluating-knn-from-training-field-to-scoreboard-4o5j\">Evaluating KNN: From Training Field to Scoreboard</a> post, you'll recognize this as the \"impress stakeholders\" (i.e., you the reader) metric. I'm (kinda) joking. We'll explore all the metrics in a later post once we've tackled model fit, variance, and bias, but accuracy is a very common metric, so we'll develop the code using accuracy.</p><p>We'll use the same helper functions from the last post and add a couple more. We'll be doing a lot of visualizations in this post, so I threw the accuracy plots and fit plots into functions as well.</p><p>I updated the fit plots to display a grid of results at selected neighbor values for each . This helps us confirm that observed patterns hold across different data splits rather than being artifacts of one specific split.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>The code to load the data and build a model should look familiar now from the previous posts.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>As a reminder from the last post, here is the set of plots showing model performance for different s.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>I see three distinct areas in each of these plots:</p><ul><li>: unstable, lower performance: overfit</li><li>: stable, higher performance: generalizable</li><li>: declining performance: underfit</li></ul><h2>\n  \n  \n  Overfit: The Restrictive Fit\n</h2><p>Sometimes a model clings the data so closely that it captures every wrinkle and crease, even the ones that shouldn’t matter. That’s overfitting: when a KNN model memorizes the training data instead of learning its general shape. The result looks impressive on known data but uncomfortable and restrictive when faced with something new.</p><p>Let's zoom in on the region with few neighbors to see this in action.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Each of the  plots is slightly different, but we see increasing performance that stabilizes somewhere between 5 - 12 neighbors.</p><p>I'm interested in how fit changes at these low values depending on the train/test split. Specifically, whether a KNN model really can find a generalizable fit with as few as 5 neighbors.</p><p>For a baseline that we know is overfit, let's first take a look at the fit at 2 neighbors for each of these s.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>At  the overfitting is obvious for all s. The decision boundary is jagged and even has islands of fit for single points that are mixed in with the opposing class. With such a small number of neighbors, each prediction is heavily influenced by just one or two nearby points, leading to decision boundaries that perfectly trace the training data but fail to generalize.</p><p>Now let's take a look at 5 neighbors. This is where the plots for  values 20, 119, and 9 seemed like they might have started generalizing.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>These plots show improved ability to generalize to the patters we can see. However,  values 9 and 119 still have islands of prediction mixed in and all of the boundaries are still pretty jagged. These models all still look overfit to me.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Generalizable: The Perfect Fit\n</h2><p>A perfectly tailored model moves with the data, it's flexible enough to adapt, but structured enough to hold its shape. In this middle zone, the KNN model generalizes well: it captures the key relationships without being distorted by noise. Here, we’ll look at what that balance looks like in both accuracy plots and decision boundaries.</p><p>Let's jump to a number of neighbors of 12. By this point, all the accuracy plots show stabilization in performance, indicating that the model has reached a more generalizable state.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>At this point we can see that the decision boundary has become much more stable and good at differentiating between the different regions for our classes.</p><p>For most of our data splits, this stability lasts until around 50 neighbors. Let's zoom in on the 12 - 50 neighbor region of the performance.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>The s of 52 and 20 see a sharp decline in performance around 45 neighbors, while s 9 and 130 look like they continue to enjoy stability beyond 50 neighbors.</p><p>Let's look at 40 neighbors. This number of neighbors should show good results for all of our s and give us a comparison against the beginning of our stable range of 12 neighbors.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>The decision boundaries here all look pretty clean, and still very similar to the plots from . There are no extreme attempts at trying to include or exclude any particular point.</p><p>At the other far end of the spectrum, an underfit model is like clothing that’s too baggy, it smooths over every detail, losing definition and shape. In KNN terms, this happens when we use too many neighbors. The model becomes overly simple, predicting broad averages instead of meaningful distinctions.</p><p>Let's zoom in on our third region, and see what happens during declining accuracy.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>The decline in accuracy is obvious in all of our s. Since we already know what a good fit looks like, let's jump right to the underfit extreme .</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>All of our plots for the different s show that we've lost the ability to predict  along a wide band where our previous decision boundaries had existed.</p><p>We’ve lost too much detail in the decision boundary. It becomes overly smooth and shifts toward the upper-right region of the plots, showing that the model is averaging across both classes rather than distinguishing between them.</p><p>If we look back at the count of purchased  vs , we can see that  makes up about 2/3rds of our observations/rows. As such, our model will default more and more toward the majority value as it gets more underfit.</p><p>We often use the class distribution itself as a baseline, sometimes called a \"naive\" or \"majority class\" model. If our trained model performs better than simply predicting the majority class, we’ve successfully improved beyond baseline.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><div><table></table></div><p>Every good fit, whether in fashion or machine learning modeling, comes from iteration. We measure, test, adjust, and refine until the result balances structure and flexibility. By exploring overfitting and underfitting side by side, we’ve built an intuition for what “fit” really means in KNN and how to choose parameters that let the model move gracefully between precision and generalization.</p><p>By visualizing model performance and fit, we were able to see three distinct areas:</p><ul><li>Overfit: 2 - 12 neighbors</li><li>Generalizable: 12 - 45 neighbors</li></ul><p>These visualizations help give us an intuitive understanding of fit, from overfit to generalizable to underfit. This gives us a foundation for building an intuitive mental model of what’s happening under the hood.</p><p>Based on these visualizations, if I were going to choose a number of neighbors for a production model for this use case, I would pick something in the range of 20 - 40 neighbors.</p><p>However, this model was built with only two features. Two features are easy to visualize. As we add more features, which is common in machine learning, it gets harder and harder to visualize how the features interact and how that impacts model performance. In the next post, we'll explore how we can determine model fit based on performance metrics alone.</p>","contentLength":8849,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Python Beginner Project: Dice Rolling Simulator (Step-by-Step Tutorial)","url":"https://dev.to/codingstreets/python-beginner-project-dice-rolling-simulator-step-by-step-tutorial-23lk","date":1761839693,"author":"codingstreets","guid":322198,"unread":true,"content":"<h2>\n  \n  \n  Overview: Python Dice Rolling\n</h2><p>Let’s get started with the Python Dice Rolling Simulator Tutorial for Beginners.

In this case, dice rolling stops and by using break keyword Python jumps out of the while loop. The break keyword is used to stop the program because all conditional statements are written inside the while loop.</p><div><pre><code>else:\n    print(\"❌ Please type 'yes' to roll the dice or 'no' to quit.\")\n    print()\n</code></pre></div><p> The else condition defined if the user gives input neither yes nor no.

Imagine building highly accurate multi-class classifiers using  positive data and a pool of unlabeled samples. What if you could automatically adapt your training process to heavily penalize misclassifications in the rarest categories? This is no longer a dream – it's a reality. </p><p>The key is <em>cost-sensitive, unbiased risk estimation</em>. We can train our models by cleverly assigning different importance weights to positive examples versus those we infer as negative from the unlabeled data. This weighting dynamically adapts during training to create a balanced and unbiased view of the underlying data distribution, even if some classes are vastly underrepresented. </p><p>Think of it like teaching a child to identify different types of birds, but you only show them pictures of eagles and say, \"This is an eagle.\" The child needs to  what isn't an eagle from all the other unlabeled images of the world and learn that some mistakes are worse than others (e.g., confusing a robin with an eagle).</p><p><strong>Benefits of this approach:</strong></p><ul><li> Eliminate the need for costly and time-consuming negative data annotation.</li><li><strong>Handles Imbalanced Data Like a Champ:</strong> Achieve superior performance on datasets with significant class skew.</li><li><strong>Improved Accuracy &amp; Stability:</strong> Experience more consistent results compared to traditional methods, especially when dealing with noisy or ambiguous data.</li><li> The weighting automatically adjusts to the data, minimizing the impact of dataset bias.</li><li><strong>Reduced Annotation Burden:</strong> Focus your labeling efforts where they matter most - on positive instances.</li><li> Exceed the limits of traditional multi-class classification using limited data.</li></ul><p>The weighting factor is crucial. Naively setting it can easily lead to unstable training. A trick I've found useful is to regularize the weights and clip their values within a reasonable range based on the class prior estimates. This ensures the optimization process remains robust and prevents the model from becoming overly sensitive to noise.</p><p><strong>Beyond Image Recognition:</strong></p><p>This technique has broad applications. Consider fraud detection, where you only have examples of fraudulent transactions. Training a classifier using only these positive examples along with unlabeled transactions can significantly improve fraud detection rates.</p><p>This approach represents a paradigm shift in multi-class classification. By embracing the power of unlabeled data and cost-sensitive learning, we can unlock new possibilities for building accurate and robust AI systems with minimal human effort.

For\nresearch, the results are the product, so there’s a reason the code can be and\noften is messier.  It’s important to keep the goal in mind. I mentioned it might\nnot be worth it to add type annotations, detailed docstrings, or whatever else\nwould make the code “nice”.</p><p>But the more you can make “nice” a habit, the less work it will be to do it\nas a matter of course. Even in a result-driven research environment, you’ll be\nable to write code the way you want, or at least push back a little bit. Code\nusually lives longer than people expect, so the nicer you can make it,\nthe better it will be.</p><p>Side projects are a good opportunity to work differently. If work means messy\ncode, your side project could be pristine. If work is very strict, your side\nproject can be thrown together just for fun.  You get to set the goals.</p><p>And different side projects can be different. I develop\n<a href=\"https://coverage.readthedocs.io\" rel=\"external noopener\">coverage.py</a> very differently\nthan <a href=\"https://nedbatchelder.com/blog/202510/natural_cubics_circular_simplex.html\">fun math art\nprojects</a>. Coverage.py has an extensive test suite run on many versions of\nPython (including nightly builds of the tip of main).  The math art projects\nusually have no tests at all.</p><p>Side projects are a great place to decide how you want to code and to\npractice that style.  Later you can bring those skills and learnings back to a\nwork environment.</p><p>Mark said one of his difficulties with side projects is perfectionism. He’ll\ncome back to a project and find he wants to rewrite the whole thing.</p><p>My advice is: forgive yourself.  It’s OK to rewrite the whole thing. It’s OK\nto not rewrite the whole thing. It’s OK to ignore it for months at a time.  It’s\nOK to stop in the middle of a project and never come back to it. It’s OK to\nobsess about “irrelevant” details.</p><p>The great thing about a side project is that you are the only person who\ndecides what and how it should be.</p><p>But how to stay motivated on side projects? For me, it’s very motivating that\nmany people use and get value from coverage.py. It’s a service to the community\nthat I find rewarding.  Other side projects will have other motivations: a\nchance to learn new things, flex different muscles, stretch myself in new\nways.</p><p>Find a reason that motivates you, and structure your side projects to lean\ninto that reason. Don’t forget to forgive yourself if it doesn’t work out the\nway you planned or if you change your mind.</p><p>Sure, it’s great to have a project that many people use, but how do you find\na project that will end up like that?  The best way is to write something that\nyou find useful. Then talk about it with people.  You never know what will catch\non.</p><p>I mentioned my <a href=\"https://pypi.org/project/cogapp/\" rel=\"external noopener\">cog</a> project,\nwhich I first wrote in 2004 for one reason, but which is now being used by other\npeople (including me) for different purposes.  It\n<a href=\"https://nedbatchelder.com/blog/202201/cog_resurgence.html\">took years to catch on</a>.</p><p>Of course there’s no guarantee something like that will happen: it most\nlikely won’t.  But I don’t know of a better way to make something people will\nuse than to start by making something that  will use.</p><p>The discussion wasn’t as linear as this. We touched on other things along the\nway: unit tests vs system tests, obligations to support old versions of\nsoftware, how to navigate huge code bases. There were probably other tangents\nthat I’ve forgotten.</p><p>Project nights are almost never just about projects: they are about\nconnecting with people in lots of different ways. This discussion felt like a\ngood connection.  I hope the ideas of choosing your own paths and forgiving\nyourself hit home.</p>","contentLength":3816,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Tech With Tim: Build a Python AI Agent in 10 Minutes","url":"https://dev.to/vibe_youtube/tech-with-tim-build-a-python-ai-agent-in-10-minutes-1a46","date":1761818901,"author":"Vibe YouTube","guid":322053,"unread":true,"content":"<p>Tech With Tim walks you through a turbocharged tutorial on spinning up your own AI agent in under ten minutes.

Decision making is what allows a program to react to different situations instead of following a single, fixed path. It’s how Python “thinks” and decides what to do based on certain rules or conditions.</p><p>Read More:&nbsp; Exploring Python Logic: How to Turn Conditions into Code</p><p>In simple terms, turning conditions into code means teaching your program how to respond when something is true or false. This logical thinking is the foundation of all programming, from simple tasks like checking passwords to complex applications like artificial intelligence.</p><p>Understanding Conditions in Python</p><p>A condition in Python is a statement that can be evaluated as true or false. It is the basic building block of decision-making. For example, when a program needs to determine whether a user is old enough to access a website, it checks the condition related to age.</p><p>Conditions are created using comparison and logical reasoning. Python uses various comparison operators to compare values, such as checking if something is equal, greater, or smaller than another value. Logical operators then combine multiple conditions to form more complex rules.</p><p>The goal of conditions is simple: they allow the program to choose what happens next. When a condition is true, Python performs one action. When it’s false, it performs another. This ability to evaluate situations and act accordingly gives programs flexibility and intelligence.</p><p>The Role of Decision Making</p><p>In real life, we make decisions every day based on conditions — for example, deciding to carry an umbrella if the weather forecast predicts rain. Similarly, Python uses decision-making statements to perform certain actions only when specific conditions are met.</p><p>This process is called conditional logic. It helps Python programs behave differently depending on the data or situation. By applying conditional logic, a single program can handle a wide range of scenarios, making it efficient and adaptable.</p><p>How Python Handles Decisions</p><p>Python uses structured statements to manage decision making. Each decision starts by checking whether a condition is true or false. If the condition is true, the program follows one path. If it’s false, the program may choose another path or simply stop that part of the process.</p><p>These decisions allow programs to act intelligently. For example, a program can verify whether a form has been filled out correctly, control access to information, or respond to different user choices. Without decision making, programs would act in the same way every time, ignoring changes in data or user input.</p><p>Combining and Layering Conditions</p><p>In many situations, decisions are not based on a single rule. For instance, a program might need to check multiple factors before proceeding — such as whether a user is logged in and whether they have permission to view certain content.</p><p>Python allows multiple conditions to be combined. Logical operators such as “and,” “or,” and “not” are used to connect these conditions, making it possible to test several situations at once. This approach allows programmers to create more precise and complex decision-making logic.</p><p>Conditions can also be layered, meaning one decision depends on another. For example, if one rule is true, the program might check another rule before acting. This layered or nested logic helps the program handle complex decision trees effectively.</p><p>Why Decision Making Is Important</p><p>Decision making is a key concept in all areas of programming. It makes software interactive, responsive, and intelligent. With conditional logic, programs can:</p><p>React differently to various inputs.</p><p>Handle exceptions and errors smoothly.</p><p>Automate routine checks and tasks.</p><p>Improve user experience through dynamic responses.</p><p>Support complex systems such as authentication, recommendation engines, and data analysis.</p><p>Without decision making, Python programs would be static and predictable, unable to adapt to the real world.</p><p>Thinking Like a Programmer</p><p>Learning to use conditions effectively helps new programmers develop logical thinking skills. It trains the mind to break problems into smaller decisions and define what should happen in each case.&nbsp;Every decision in a Python program represents a piece of reasoning. By combining many small logical steps, programmers can create powerful systems that behave intelligently and make accurate decisions automatically.</p><p>Turning conditions into code is at the heart of Python logic. It transforms simple instructions into dynamic actions that respond to changing information. Understanding how to structure decisions, combine conditions, and think logically is one of the most valuable skills in Python programming. By mastering Python’s decision-making concepts, you unlock the ability to create smarter, more responsive programs that can reason, adapt, and evolve just like a human making choices in everyday life.</p>","contentLength":4956,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Django Weblog: Django is now a CVE Numbering Authority (CNA)","url":"https://www.djangoproject.com/weblog/2025/oct/30/django-is-now-a-cve-numbering-authority-cna/","date":1761814136,"author":"","guid":322046,"unread":true,"content":"<h3>What it means for Django to be a CNA</h3><p>Our <a href=\"http://www.djangoproject.com/foundation/teams/#security-team\">security team</a> deals with vulnerability reports on a daily basis, and every so often some turn out to be real vulnerabilities for us to fix and publish.

Debugging is one of the most crucial aspects of the entire software development process, which includes spotting errors as well as resolving them in the meantime in a specific program’s code. </p><p>Debugging is a very important process that is not just limited to identifying errors and issues, but also a sure-shot way to ensure that the overall program’s functionality is not at all disrupted. Debugging is a proper systematic approach considered regarding problem-solving. Debugging in the right manner enables programmers to isolate issues, also they gain a proper understanding of the why part, and implement necessary solutions. </p><p>So basically, this one is a highly systematic process considered by developers to identify as well as correct the issues so that the developed software behaves as intended or operates most reliably. </p><p>Apart from this, debugging can be beneficial in many ways, such as:</p><p> - Debugging assists developers in spotting and fixing errors within the code. This does enhance the overall quality of code. Detecting errors at a very early stage can prevent them from becoming more significant issues, which leads to a severe reduction in numerous kinds of bugs and vulnerabilities. </p><p>It has been observed that one of the common reasons for software crashes is due to high-quality code. And this can definitely hinder user experience as well. By debugging in the right manner, you can ensure that the developed code is severely compliant with ongoing coding practices and best practices. </p><p> - Debugging can enhance overall productivity in the software development realm. You see, when developers began spending less time fixing bugs and errors, the efficiency and productivity automatically increased. In addition, it is feasible for them to focus on developing new features and enhancing the user interface. Debugging certainly reduces the number of support tickets and bug reports, which means it is possible to complete projects at a much faster rate. </p><p> - It is possible to save money in the long run, all thanks to debugging. As mentioned earlier, by identifying errors early, it is possible to prevent more significant issues right from the very beginning. Meanwhile, this also reduces the risk of project delays and costly rework. As a result, lots and lots of money can be saved from debugging.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  What is Python Debugging?\n</h3><p>Python has been one of the most popular technologies since it was released in 1991, and the mastermind behind the tech was Guido van Rossum. Over the years, the tech has gone through several changes and has been considered the best object-oriented programming language. With the severe gain in popularity, the need for Python debugging tools and techniques has increased. </p><p>What does Python debugging mean? It refers to successfully identifying, fixing errors within the code. Some of the errors that can prevent code from functioning include syntax, semantic, and runtime errors. So what is Python debugging all about?</p><p> - This is possible by simply reading the error message and keeping tabs on the log file, testing the code, and see in case if there is something off or not.  - To successfully debug the code, it is very important to reproduce the error consistently. <strong>Isolate the source of the error</strong> - As soon as the error is reproduced, it is very important to isolate the source of the problem, and this is possible by incorporating different techniques such as adding print statements, using a debugger, and examining stack traces.  - Once all the information is successfully gathered, make sure you form a hypothesis regarding what might be causing the error. - The next aspect is to use the hypothesis to guide the debugging procedure by making small changes to the code and then seeing what the end result is.  - In case the hypothesis is incorrect, keep repeating the process to isolate the error.  - As soon as you have fixed the error, make sure the code is working in the correct manner.  - Lastly, make sure to document the error and fix it so that there is no scope for any miscommunications in the future. </p><p>So now you must be wondering whether it is worth performing Python debugging or not? Well, it is always worth considering Python debugging after all, a successful development project is said to be absolutely free from errors and issues. I mean, finding bugs now and then can be pretty overwhelming, time-consuming, and daunting, especially when the code begins to grow in size as well as complexity. </p><p>It may quite interest to you to know that a debugger can assist in pausing the execution of the code as well as inspecting variables, expressions. And do you know what the best part here is? This is possible at any given point. So fret not, it becomes pretty easy to isolate the source of an error and understand how the code is behaving. Much like any debugging technique, Python debugging offers several benefits, such as saving ample time, enhancing code quality, better understanding of the code, and debugging complex and complicated errors. </p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Top Debugging Tools for Python\n</h3><p>The first and foremost debugging tool offered by Python is PDB. This one is a built-in Python debugger, one of the finest powerful tools that ensures an interactive debugging experience. And do you know what is an amazing aspect here? You are bound to receive an interactive debugging experience. Moreover, it is possible to pause the program’s execution and inspect its state; as a result, everything becomes easy to understand, so if you become clueless at any point in time, the debugging tool can work wonders. Moreover, it is possible to set breakpoints by stepping through code line by line and evaluating variables in real-time. </p><p>So by doing so, the execution will be paused, and you are bound to have instant access to the PDB command-line interface. Down below, I would like to mention certain commands that must be taken into consideration: </p><ul><li>To execute the next line of code - n (next)</li><li>If you want to continue execution until the next breakpoint - c (continue)</li><li>If you want to step into a function call - s (step)</li><li>If you want to print the value of the specified variable - p variable_name</li><li>If you want to exit the debugger - q (quit)</li></ul><p>Also, it is feasible to use he pdb.set_trace() method;</p><div><pre><code>import pdb\n\ndef add(a, b):\n    answer = a+b\n    return answer\n\npdb.set_trace()\nsum = add(1,2)\nprint(sum)\n</code></pre></div><p>Right from offering accurate breakpoints to ensuring step-by-step execution, variable inspection, and of course, conditional breakpoints, the PDB offers it all. </p><p>The next interesting Python debugging tool to take into consideration is PyDebugger. This one is a third-party tool which is created to offer a more visual as well as user-friendly debugging experience, especially in comparison to PDB. This Python debugging tool must be considered by developers who prefer a graphical interface in comparison to a command-line experience. When integrating the tool with Python, everything is simplified, right from identifying to inspection to fixing bugs in real time. </p><p>From pydebugger. Debug import debug</p><p>debug(variable1=\"data1\", debug=True)</p><p>\n$ python debugger.py<p>\n2024:10:22~12:09:18:573544 debugger.py -&gt; variable1: data1 -&gt; TYPE: -&gt; LEN:5 -&gt; [debugger.py:debugger.py] [3] PID:60855</p></p><p>Much like PDB, even PyDebugger offers a wide range of benefits such as breakpoint management, call stack visibility, variable inspection, exception handling, and the list goes on. </p><h4>\n  \n  \n  Visual Studio Code Python Extension\n</h4><p>The Visual Studio Code Python extension is another interesting, versatile tool mainly used by Python developers. This tool ensures seamless integration with other Python-based tools, so this debugging tool turns out to be everyone’s favourite, including both novice and experienced developers. </p><p>To ensure successful debugging, the Python debugger must be successfully installed in Visual Studio Code. By doing so, you can make the most of some of the most extraordinary features, including real-time variable inspection, step-by-step debugging, and breakpoints. </p><p>Moreover, this debugging tool highly supports the latest debugging modes, such as ‘debug-test’ or ‘debug-in-terminal’; no wonder it is easy to get things configured in the launch.json file.\nHere is the key for successful outcomes: try setting breakpoints on expressions and hit counts. By doing this, you are offering a flexible debugging environment that can handle different subprocesses as well as other advanced debugging capabilities. </p><p>Another interesting debugging tool, which offers an interactive shell for Python and comprises some of the most powerful features, especially to ease debugging and data exploration. The Python debugging tool ensures a highly robust environment, which turns out to be quite fruitful for interactive computing and enhances the debugging experience. </p><p>IPython features a quite rich toolkit where it is possible for developers to execute code snippets and visualise outputs that too, in real-time; no wonder it is an excellent choice when it comes to learning and development. </p><p>The Python debugging tool supports a wide range of debugging techniques, such as exclusive use of magic commands like %debug, so nothing can stop you from gaining a post-mortem debugging interface, especially after an exception occurs. The command line enables developers to successfully inspect the stack frame as well as evaluate different variables during the time of the error, so it becomes pretty easy to identify issues. </p><p>IPython successfully integrates well with Jupyter notebooks, by doing so it enables end users to mix code execution with rich text documentation and visualisations. No wonder data science and exploratory programming ensure a more comprehensive understanding of code behaviour. </p><p>Some of the most crucial benefits offered by IPython include - interactive shell, Post-mortem debugging with %debug, magic commands, real-time variable inspection, easy integration with Jupyter Notebooks, and absolute support for Rich Output visualisation. </p><p>This one is an error-tracking and performance monitoring tool that has the potential to diagnose and fix relevant Python issues. With the help of the following tool, it is possible to break down detected errors and opt for more significant insights, especially when you get full access to the space where the code produces lots and lots of bugs. </p><p>Some of its prominent features include error detection, absolute performance monitoring, stack tracing for error insights, event log reader, free version available with limited user capacity. Since it is easy to diagnose and fix Python issues efficiently, you are bound to gain detailed insights into detected errors. It is possible to identify as well as address bugs quickly, leading to enhanced code quality as well as enhanced project stability. </p><p>So error detection, performance monitoring, stack tracing for error insights, and event log reading everything is available here. </p><p>Sentry is highly recommended for projects that prioritise open-source solutions and require support for multiple programming languages, and this needs to go beyond Python, be it Go, JavaScript, and Ruby. </p><p>So if you are looking for a Python debugging tool that is an open source solution, ensures high transparency, flexibility, offers support for querying multidimensional data structures, facilitates root causes, ensures seamless integration with different logging and PSA tools, this is it! Your search needs to end here. </p><p>Further below, I would like to mention certain factors on which Python debugging tools must be evaluated:</p><ul><li>Seamless integration with the development environment</li><li>Absolute debugging capabilities</li><li>Quick support and active community</li></ul><p>And we are done for now! In short, debugging is one of the most popular and vital skills for Python developers to succeed. Whether they want to perform basic command-line debugging or advanced methods such as remote and post-mortem debugging, the tools and techniques mentioned above can definitely make things easy for you. </p><p>By now, I hope you realize that the significance of debugging and monitoring tools cannot be overstated. Since these tools are meant to enhance the quality of code and the developed app can perform successfully under varying conditions. So what are you waiting for? Time to create a cleaner and highly reliable Python code. Last piece of advice I would love to offer is that being a successful developer means you need to foster a culture of continuous improvement, which means the app has not just met user expectations but also is capable enough to adapt to the ever-evolving technological landscape. </p><p>So developing high-quality Python applications might seem to be a tricky venture, but it is definitely a doable job. All you need to do is consider a reputable and reliable development company that carries immense knowledge with Python and has enough experience as well. </p>","contentLength":13096,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Day 19: Python Vowel Counter – Build a Simple Function to Count Vowels in Any Text","url":"https://dev.to/shahrouzlogs/day-19-python-vowel-counter-build-a-simple-function-to-count-vowels-in-any-text-5a5k","date":1761807602,"author":"Shahrouz Nikseresht","guid":321979,"unread":true,"content":"<p>Welcome to Day 19 of the  journey!

Let’s break down the core concepts: , <strong>case-insensitive comparison</strong>, and .</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  1. Function Design: Clean Input, Clear Output\n</h3><p>The  function takes a string and returns an integer, no side effects, no global variables. Its signature is straightforward:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>The type hints ( → ) make the contract crystal clear. Inside, we define vowels once and reuse them:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>This list is small and static, so no need for a set (though that’s a great optimization later). The function’s purity, same input always gives the same output, makes it easy to test and reuse. For example,  → 2,  → 1. It’s the kind of utility you’d drop into a larger text analyzer without hesitation.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  2. Case-Insensitive Matching: Smart Character Handling\n</h3><p>To handle both \"A\" and \"a\", we lowercase each character before checking:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>The  method runs on every character, ensuring \"AeIoU\" counts as 5 vowels. This is efficient and readable, no regex, no complex conditions. Python’s  operator with a list is fast enough for typical inputs, and the loop feels natural, like reading the text one letter at a time. It’s a gentle introduction to case handling that scales to real-world tasks like search or validation.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  3. Interactive Flow: User Input + Instant Feedback\n</h3><p>The example usage ties it all together with a friendly prompt and formatted output:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>The speech bubble emoji adds warmth, and the f-string delivers a polished result:  </p><blockquote><p> → <code>Your text contains 5 vowels.</code></p></blockquote><p>It’s minimal but effective. The function does the work; the main block handles the conversation. This separation keeps your logic reusable, call  from a web app, file processor, or game without changing a line.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  🎯 Summary and Reflections\n</h2><p>This vowel counter challenge shows how a tiny function can teach big ideas in Python. It made me appreciate:</p><ul><li>: One function, one job, easy to test, debug, and reuse.</li><li>:  and  as everyday tools for text work.</li><li>: A docstring and type hints turn simple code into self-documenting code.</li></ul><p>The surprise? How often this pattern appears, counting characters, filtering data, validating input. For extensions, I thought about returning a dictionary of vowel counts () or ignoring accents (é, ü).</p><p>: Use a set for O(1) lookups (<code>vowels = {'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u'}</code>), or <code>sum(1 for ch in text.lower() if ch in vowels)</code> for a one-liner.

If you're in the #80DaysOfChallenges flow, did you tweak the counter? Add consonants?

It's the simple, readable language everyone starts with. It's the king of data science and the backbone of countless AI projects. But for core software development, some critics whisper, \"It's too slow,\" or \"The GIL is a killer.\"</p><p>Developers, listen up: The Python of tomorrow is systematically dismantling these criticisms, making it not just a good choice, but a mandatory one for any modern developer's toolkit.</p><ol><li>The Death of the GIL (Kind Of)\nThe Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) has been the boogeyman in Python's story, famously preventing true multi-core parallel execution of CPython code. But the landscape is rapidly changing.</li></ol><p>PEP 684: Per-Interpreter GIL: This change, already being implemented in newer Python versions, allows for multiple sub-interpreters within a single process, each with its own GIL. This is a game-changer! It paves the way for applications to leverage multiple CPU cores without the overhead of full multiprocessing, bringing true multi-threaded parallelism into the Python ecosystem.</p><p>Faster and Faster CPython: Core developers are obsessed with speed.

Python's excellent concurrency support (with asyncio and new Task Groups) makes it the ideal environment for orchestrating these sophisticated, I/O-bound AI workflows.</p><ol><li>Asynchrony and The Modern Web\nForget the old monoliths.

I am now pursuing an MSc in Software Engineering at Blekinge Institute of Technology in Karlskrona, Sweden, courtesy of a scholarship from the Swedish Institute. I have completed numerous courses for various IT certifications over the years, most of which have expired. I have also taken management courses to keep upskilling myself, as I enjoy learning. </p><p>Regarding hobbies, I enjoy baking, especially trying out new cake and pastry recipes for fun; it's my favourite way to relax after busy or stressful times. I also enjoy walking, particularly in areas with lush greenery and natural beauty, but my fear of snakes and creepy crawlies limits my solo adventures into the woods. My fear of snakes is justified; my family home (parents’) is located within a very natural reserve with many indigenous trees and forests, close to Lake Kyle in Masvingo. Although the area is stunning, it does have snakes and other wildlife such as hippopotamuses and crocodiles (if you go too close to the lake). I have encountered snakes many times at my parents’ house because of the numerous trees, so I have learnt to avoid them as most are venomous. Additionally, being African, a fear of these creatures and death is instinctive for me. I also enjoy listening to music, reading books, and occasionally watching a good film.</p><h4>How did you start using Django?</h4><p>I learnt Python in 2015 through Treehouse as part of a scholarship from Muzinda Hub’s Entrepreneurship training. We were expected to develop a Python project at the end of the three-month course, and I chose to use Flask. A friend of mine, Humphrey Butau, used Django, and he encouraged me to try it. After that, I was hooked.</p><h4>What other framework do you know and if there is anything you would like to have in Django if you had magical powers?</h4><p>I also know Flask, and recently, through school assignments, I have had to use Express JS. If I had magical powers, I would want Django to support NoSQL databases like MongoDB out of the box, just as it supports SQL databases. I have been working with the django-mongodb-backend and realised that it works if you either download their template or do some extra work to be able to run the default Django migrations. </p><h4>What projects are you working on now?</h4><p>As part of my Master’s studies, I am actually working on quite a number of projects for the two courses I am currently taking (until 31st October). For the Software Evolution and Maintenance course, we have been working on Home Assistant, which is also based on Python. We are working on a fork, though, so that we don’t flood the upstream with pull requests from Python, but it has been amazing seeing all the integrations available in it. My group and I chose to work on the Google Tasks integration. I will likely want to continue experimenting with Home Assistant even after the course ends.</p><p>For the Cloud Computing and Big Data Analysis course I am undertaking, I have recently completed two projects: one involving provisioning and orchestration of two RESTful Django microservices with Kubernetes, and another focused on Big Data Analysis using Express JS. Currently, I am working on implementing monitoring for an application that utilises Clojure and a MongoDB database, although I intend to develop the monitoring in Python.</p><p>Besides that, I am personally developing a MongoDB version of a Conveyances app I created several years ago, which was built using Django, Django Rest Framework, Vue, and Postgres. The app had nested data due to the restrictions of a SQL database structure, so I want to experiment with NoSQL to see how simpler it would be. I had meant to do this before DjangoCon Africa and present a talk on it, but the toll of organising a conference blocked me, so I am finally working on it now.</p><h4>What are you learning about these days?</h4><p>I am currently learning about cloud computing and Big Data, with a focus on provisioning and orchestrating Big Data Analysis cloud architectures. I am also learning how to improve and monitor the performance of these systems in terms of CPU, memory, and storage utilisation.</p><h4>Which Django libraries are your favourite (core or 3rd party)?</h4><p>My favourite Django core libraries are the Django ORM and Django Admin. They make it very easy to set up a functional website with minimal effort. The ORM simplifies database connections and queries, and Django Admin provides a ready-to-use backend admin interface. My favourite third-party library is Django Rest Framework. It makes creating RESTful APIs with Django quick and straightforward.</p><h4>What are the top three things in Django that you like?</h4><p>The top three things that I like in Django are the management commands, migrations and the authentication systems. I like how the management commands make it so easy to quickly automate stuff, whether it's the default Django management commands or if you have written your own. Django migrations do the work for you in terms of making changes to the database, and you need not worry about writing the SQL statements. </p><p>The authentication system is fairly basic, but it can get you started with minimal effort on your part. This makes Django fulfil its tagline of being “The framework for perfectionists with deadlines”. I have used it in most of my projects for my Master’s programme, where we were chasing deadlines, and it always turned out to be true.</p><h4>You were previously a board member and President of the Django Software Foundation, what would you suggest to someone wondering if they should take this role or being part of the board?</h4><p>Being part of the Django Software Foundation board is an excellent way to contribute to the Django community, as you can shape and influence important decisions related to Django and its ecosystem. While the DSF Board does not dictate the technical direction of Django, it does influence how those who impact the technical direction are selected or governed. </p><p>As President, you also have the chance to implement your ideas on the future of the Django community, the staff who maintain Django, and the direction of Django events. Although it may require more of your time than being an ordinary member due to additional responsibilities, it is a valuable opportunity to develop and strengthen your leadership skills. </p><p>Anyone who uses Django, even if they haven't contributed code but have attended or organised Django events, can be part of the DSF board. I joined the DSF board at the end of 2017 for 2018, after using Django for just over two years, so you need not worry about your level of experience. All you need is your commitment and a clear plan of what you hope the DSF board should achieve during your term.</p><h4>You were the chair of DjangoCon Africa this year, what do you think is required to organize a conference like this? Why do you think this is important conference like DjangoCon Africa?</h4><p>Organising a conference like DjangoCon Africa requires substantial community engagement, significant time, effort, and resilience. Firstly, Africa differs from other continents in many ways. In some aspects, these differences are advantageous, while in others, they present challenges. Technologically, Africa is a greenfield; there is ample opportunity for technological advances, and we have the population to pursue this, meaning most of our attendees are eager to learn and contribute to the community. We also have the “Ubuntu” community spirit ingrained within us, which makes our DjangoCon Africa events feel like home. </p><p>However, this presents a significant challenge regarding funding, as there are not many successful Django-based startups capable of financing an event as large as DjangoCon Africa. Our colonial history as a continent creates major obstacles to international financial transactions, mainly due to numerous structural barriers. This makes it notably harder for corporate sponsors without local offices to offer sponsorship. </p><p>Despite these challenges, I believe it is essential to organise DjangoCon Africa because it is the only continent where many Africans can travel visa-free or without restrictions. My first DjangoCon events were in Europe and then the US, and I have faced numerous visa applications each time I needed to travel. Within Africa, I can visit many countries visa-free. Once I arrive, I am often mistaken for a local until I speak, and then I am limited to speaking English, not their local language. DjangoCon Africa's programme is curated specifically for Africans, featuring talks suited to their level of understanding and offering numerous beginner workshops to help them get started, while also catering for mid-level and advanced programmers. </p><p>DjangoCon Africa takes over a year to plan, which demands a significant time commitment. When we are halfway through organising it, I ask myself why I keep getting into trouble by arranging a DjangoCon. After each event, I feel tired and exhausted but incredibly fulfilled because of the impact I can see we have achieved from that single occasion. While other events are more polished and well-established, DjangoCon Africa has only hosted two events so far and remains far from perfect, yet I still sense its impact despite all the imperfections. One can only truly understand the feeling of being at DjangoCon Africa if they have attended it. </p><h4>I know you are a Django Girls+ Trustee, could you tell us a bit more about Django Girls+ and how we could be involved in Django Girls if we are interested?</h4><p>Django Girls Foundation is a non-profit that empowers women+ to organise free programming workshops for women+ by providing the resources they need. Django Girls+ workshops are one or two-day events where participants are exposed to web development using Python and Django using our popular, beginner-friendly Django Girls Tutorial, which is open source. The participants get to learn at their own pace with the help of coaches. </p><p>We also have several open-source resources to help our volunteers run and organise our workshops: the Organiser Manual, Coach Manual, Organiser FAQs and Tutorial Extensions. In the 11 years that Django Girls+ has existed. You can find more on <a href=\"https://djangogirls.org/en/2016-2017/\">one of Django Girls+ annual report</a>.</p><p>There are several ways to get involved with Django Girls+. One can apply to organise a workshop in their city or become a coach at one of our events. They can also contribute to all the resources mentioned above, as well as our open-source website. They can also contribute financially by supporting us through <a href=\"https://djangogirls.org/en/donate/donate/\">Patreon, donating via PayPal or GitHub Sponsors</a>. If they are corporates, they can reach out to me as the Fundraising Coordinator and we can discuss a partnership at hello@djangogirls.org.</p><h4>Django is celebrating its 20th anniversary, do you have a nice story to share?</h4><p>Being part of the Django community since 2016 has been a blessing in my life. I have travelled to many countries for Python and Django conferences, forming many meaningful friendships that have become essential to me. I have contributed to Django in many ways, and in return, Django has given me so much. I have been able to showcase my leadership qualities through the Django community, and I am grateful to them for allowing me to be myself and celebrate my identity as an African woman who’s passionate about coding and community. </p><p>One of my favourite memories from DjangoCon Europe 2018  is taking a pedal boat ride with my good friend Jessica Upani in Heidelberg, right after DjangoCon Europe 2018. We had previously visited a castle, and it had been lovely. While on the boat, Jessica, true to her nature, kept laughing and not taking our safety seriously, while I, on the other hand, was panicking that we might capsize. We had no life jackets, and I was sure I wouldn’t swim well in the river. When we disembarked, I felt relieved and told her I was worried we would capsize and I wouldn’t be able to swim, and she admitted she was worried too. Who does that? \nWith that, I say happy 20th birthday to Django. I have so many fond memories to share from the Django community.</p><h4>Is there anything else you’d like to say?</h4><p>The Django community has put in a lot of work to make the environment welcoming for beginners and for everyone, especially minorities. I have made many genuine friends over the years, whom I am always excited to meet again at various community events. I am one of those people who came for the framework and stayed for the community, and I would like to see this continue. </p><p>Thanks so much to all the work the DSF board members (past and present) have done all these years. Things move slowly in Djangoland, as Carlton Gibson likes to say, but it has been a great pleasure watching every board build on what the previous boards have started, and I hope to see that continue. Special thanks to all the working groups, members and volunteers that support the DSF - Django is great because of you.</p><p><strong>Thank you for doing the interview, Anna !</strong></p>","contentLength":13649,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Tech With Tim: 3 Unique Python Features You NEED To Know","url":"https://dev.to/vibe_youtube/tech-with-tim-3-unique-python-features-you-need-to-know-a74","date":1761797275,"author":"Vibe YouTube","guid":321944,"unread":true,"content":"<p>Tim dives into three under-the-radar Python tricks that’ll level up your code: the new match statement for pattern matching, dataclasses to cut down on boilerplate, and the power combo of positional-only vs. keyword-only function arguments. </p><p>He also plugs free Brilliant lessons (plus a 20% off Premium deal) and his DevLaunch mentorship to help you build real-world projects and land that dream job.</p>","contentLength":401,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Top 6 API Architecture Styles","url":"https://blog.algomaster.io/p/top-6-api-architecture-styles","date":1761796357,"author":"Ashish Pratap Singh","guid":321933,"unread":true,"content":"<p>An <strong>API (Application Programming Interface)</strong> defines how two systems communicate, what data can be shared, and in what format.</p><p>But not all APIs are built the same. Over time, as applications evolved, so did the challenges they faced.</p><p>This led to the creation of new API styles, each designed to solve specific problems related to <strong>performance, flexibility, or real-time updates</strong>.</p><p>In this article, we’ll break down the  that power modern software.</p><p>In the beginning, there was <strong>SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol)</strong>.</p><p>As the internet began to rise in the late 1990s, companies needed a standardized way for applications to communicate across different platforms and programming languages.</p><p>SOAP emerged as the first major standard to solve this.</p><p>SOAP demands that all messages be in  format, and it operates based on a very strict contract called a <strong>WSDL (Web Services Description Language)</strong>.</p><p>Think of WSDL as a detailed instruction manual that precisely defines every operation you can perform.</p><p>SOAP is very “verbose,” meaning it uses a lot of text to describe a simple action. All that text for one simple request makes messages large, which  network transmission and processing.</p><p>Furthermore, the strict WSDL contract creates ; if the server changes any part of the contract, the client will often break.</p><p>While this was acceptable for large, internal enterprise systems, SOAP was just too heavy and inflexible for the fast moving web and new mobile apps. Developers needed something simpler, lighter, and more flexible that used the web’s own language, HTTP.</p><p>In response to SOAP’s complexity, <strong>REST (Representational State Transfer)</strong> emerged and it quickly became the standard for the modern web.</p><p>REST represented a complete mindset shift. Instead of complex operations defined in a WSDL, REST treats data as “resources” (like ) that you interact with using the standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) that power the entire web.</p><p>It is , meaning every request contains all the information needed to process it. It also embraced  over XML, which is far lighter and easier for both humans and machines (especially JavaScript) to read.</p><p>REST is amazing and runs the majority of the web. But as applications grew, two common problems emerged:</p><ol><li><p> Clients often receive more data than they need. You just need a user’s name, but  returns their name, address, entire post history, and a dozen other fields. This is wasted data that slows down apps, especially on mobile networks.</p></li><li><p> You need to show a user’s profile  their latest posts. This requires two separate requests:  and then . This “waterfall” of requests creates noticeable lag.</p></li></ol><p>As frontend applications grew richer especially with mobile and single-page apps, developers wanted more control over the data they fetched.</p><p>This led to the rise of .</p><p>What if you could ask for  what you need, all in one trip? </p><p>That’s what Facebook set out to solve when they created in 2012 and open-sourced in 2015.</p><p>GraphQL is a <strong>query language for your API</strong>. The most important shift is that the , not the server, defines the shape of the data it needs. </p><p>Instead of dozens of REST endpoints, you typically have just one (like ) that accepts a query. The client sends a query that precisely describes the data it wants, and the server returns a JSON object in that exact same shape.</p><p>This single query can pull from multiple sources (like a user database and a post database) and return it all in one response.</p><p>There is no  (you only get the  and , not the user’s email or post bodies) and no  (you get the user and their posts in one round trip).</p><p>However, GraphQL introduces its own set of challenges:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Complex Server Implementation:</strong> Building a GraphQL server (especially with nested data) can be more complex than a simple REST API.</p></li><li><p> The single endpoint and dynamic queries make traditional HTTP caching mechanisms less effective compared to REST.</p></li></ul><p>GraphQL shares a fundamental trait with REST: it’s text based (JSON) and works on a client “pull” model, where the client must make a request.</p><p>For high-performance internal communication between dozens of microservices, the overhead of parsing text and the HTTP request-response pattern is too slow.</p><p>This need for raw speed led to .</p><p>Developed by Google and open-sourced in 2015, gRPC is a modern <strong>Remote Procedure Call (RPC)</strong> framework designed for high-performance, language-agnostic communication  services.</p><p>It’s built for performance in two key ways:</p><ol><li><p> It replaces text-based JSON with <strong>Protocol Buffers (Protobufs)</strong>, a highly efficient binary format. This is much faster for computers to  (write) and  (read).</p></li><li><p> It runs on  by default. This modern protocol is far more efficient than HTTP/1.1, supporting features like , where many requests can fly back and forth on a single connection.</p></li></ol><p>You define your services and messages in a simple  file. This file acts as a language-agnostic contract, which gRPC uses to generate native code for any language you need (Java, Go, Python, etc.).</p><p>gRPC is an excellent choice for <strong>internal Service-to-Service Communication</strong>, especially over low-bandwidth networks.</p><p>However, its binary format is not human-readable, which can make debugging more challenging. It also isn’t directly supported by browsers, requiring a proxy like gRPC-Web for client-side use.</p><p>Although highly performant, gRPC is still a request-response pattern: the client asks, the server answers.</p><p>What if you need a persistent, two-way connection for a live chat app, a stock ticker, or a multiplayer game?</p><p>That’s where  comes in.</p><p>Traditional HTTP, which underpins REST, GraphQL, and gRPC, is a  protocol. The client must always initiate the conversation.</p><p>This becomes inefficient for real-time use cases, because the only way to constantly get updates is to repeatedly ask the server () or keep a request hanging until something happens ().</p><p> was built to solve exactly this. It creates a ,  communication channel over a single connection.</p><p>The connection begins as a normal HTTP request, then upgrades to a WebSocket. After that, both client and server can send data to each other whenever they want without new requests.</p><p><strong>Client-side code example:</strong></p><p>This model is perfect for live dashboards, multiplayer gaming, or chat applications where the server must push updates instantly.</p><p>But running WebSockets at scale is not trivial. You have to manage millions of long-lived connections, ensure state consistency across servers, and handle reconnects and failures.</p><p>Another limitation: the client must initiate the connection first. That works for browsers and apps, but fails for server-to-server events.</p><p>For example, what if Stripe’s server needs to notify  server that a payment just succeeded? Your server isn’t sitting there with an open connection to Stripe.</p><p>In such cases, we need a different mechanism:  a .</p><p>Webhooks are essentially “reverse APIs.” Instead of your application polling an API endpoint for new data, the  calls  (acting as the client) when a specific event occurs. It’s a user-defined HTTP callback.</p><p>A Webhook is a server to server push model. You provide a URL (an endpoint on your server) to a third party service like GitHub, Stripe, or Slack. When a specific event happens (like a  or a ), that service instantly sends an HTTP POST request with the event data (the payload) to your URL.</p><p>Webhooks eliminate the need for constant polling, allowing systems to react to events asynchronously and saving resources for both the client and the server.</p><p>Despite their power, Webhooks require careful implementation:</p><ul><li><p> Your endpoint is public. You  verify a signature (like ) to ensure the request is legitimate and not a forgery.</p></li><li><p> Webhooks can fail and be retried. Your endpoint must be , meaning processing the same notification multiple times has the same effect as processing it once.</p></li></ul><p>As you can see, there is no single “best” API. The “best” API is the one that fits your use case. In fact, a single, complex application will often use many of them together:</p><ul><li><p> or  for its public web and mobile apps.</p></li><li><p> for its internal, high speed microservice communication.</p></li><li><p> for its real time chat feature.</p></li><li><p> to receive events from its payment provider.</p></li></ul><p>The journey from SOAP to Webhooks shows an evolution towards more specific, efficient, and flexible tools. The real skill is not knowing just one, but knowing which one to pick for the job.</p><p>If you found it valuable, hit a like ❤️ and consider subscribing for more such content.</p><p>If you have any questions or suggestions, leave a comment.</p><div data-attrs=\"{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://blog.algomaster.io/p/scalability?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share&amp;token=eyJ1c2VyX2lkIjo4MzYwMjc0MywicG9zdF9pZCI6MTQwMDc4MDk0LCJpYXQiOjE3Mzc1MzgxODMsImV4cCI6MTc0MDEzMDE4MywiaXNzIjoicHViLTIyMDIyNjgiLCJzdWIiOiJwb3N0LXJlYWN0aW9uIn0.xroFXQDDEPvo2FWnnt-G2Ji9MzYIDtJ68NRQX6sT8x8&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share&quot;}\" data-component-name=\"CaptionedButtonToDOM\"><div><p>This post is public so feel free to share it.</p></div></div><p> If you’re enjoying this newsletter and want to get even more value, consider becoming a .</p><p>I hope you have a lovely day!</p>","contentLength":8616,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!VOZJ!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F230bee2c-6957-499a-8bda-473bfb05b4b2_2332x1352.png","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Building Intelligent Multi-Agent Systems with Context-Aware Coordination","url":"https://dev.to/exploredataaiml/building-intelligent-multi-agent-systems-with-context-aware-coordination-a4c","date":1761791140,"author":"Aniket Hingane","guid":321084,"unread":true,"content":"<p>When I first started exploring multi-agent systems, I thought it would be straightforward—just create a few AI agents and let them talk.

That's what this guide solves.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  The Multi-Agent Architecture\n</h3><p>When I first approached this problem, I made a classic mistake: I tried to build everything at once. After several failed attempts, I realized I needed to think systematically.</p><p>In my observation, successful multi-agent systems follow a clear hierarchy. Let me walk you through how I designed this architecture.</p><h4>\n  \n  \n  Agent Roles and Specialization\n</h4><p>The first breakthrough came when I stopped trying to create generic agents and instead embraced specialization. Think about it like a well-run company—you don't hire generalists for everything; you have specialists who excel in their domains.</p><p>I identified four core roles based on my experience building production systems:</p><p><p>\nThis became the orchestrator in my system. As I thought about it, every complex task needs someone (or something) breaking it down into manageable pieces. The coordinator's job is task decomposition, priority management, and agent orchestration.</p></p><p><p>\nInformation gathering is its own skill. I gave this agent capabilities for data collection, source validation, and information synthesis. In my opinion, separating research from execution prevents contamination of concerns.</p></p><p><p>\nPattern recognition and insight generation require a different mindset than data gathering. This agent focuses purely on making sense of information—finding correlations, identifying trends, and generating actionable insights.</p></p><p><p>\nFinally, someone needs to actually do the work. The executor takes validated plans and implements them, handling action execution and result validation.</p></p><h4>\n  \n  \n  Context Management Strategy\n</h4><p>This was the hardest part to get right, and I went through three complete rewrites before landing on what I'll show you.</p><p>The challenge: How do agents maintain conversation context across multiple interactions while sharing relevant information with each other?</p><p>My solution uses a layered approach:</p><p>: Each agent maintains its own conversation history. I implemented this using a simple list of message objects, but with timestamp and metadata for context.</p><p>: When agents collaborate, they need to share relevant context without overwhelming each other with their entire history. I created a context extraction mechanism that pulls recent, relevant information.</p><p>: The coordinator maintains a bird's-eye view of the entire system state, tracking which agents are working on what.</p><p>From my experience, this three-tier approach balances autonomy with coordination beautifully.</p><p>Agents need to talk to each other, but how?</p><p>I designed a message-passing system with structured envelopes. Each message contains:</p><ul><li> (who's talking)</li><li> (what they're saying)</li><li> (context, priority, related tasks)</li></ul><p>This might seem over-engineered at first—I thought so too—but in production, I found that structured messages prevent the chaos that comes from free-form agent communication.</p><p>Now comes the fun part—actually building this system. I'll break down the code into logical blocks and explain my thinking behind each decision.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Building the Foundation: Agent Roles and Messages\n</h3><p>I started with the simplest possible foundation—defining what an agent can be and how they communicate.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p><p>\nIn my experience, using Enums for roles prevents typos and makes the code self-documenting. I chose dataclasses over regular classes because they're cleaner and come with free </p> and  methods.</p><p>The Message structure might look simple, but I added metadata after my first production deployment when I realized agents needed to pass contextual information beyond just content.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Creating the Agent Context Container\n</h3><p>Next, I needed a way to encapsulate everything an agent knows about itself.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p><p>\nFrom my observations, unbounded memory growth is a silent killer in production systems. That's why I added automatic memory trimming. I learned this the hard way when one of my early agents consumed 8GB of RAM after running for a week!</p></p><p>The  method exists because, as I discovered, agents rarely need their entire conversation history—usually just the recent context.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Implementing the Core Agent Class\n</h3><p>Here's where things get interesting. This is the heart of the system.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p><p>\nI structured it this way because I wanted clear separation between what an agent can do (capabilities) and what it uses to do it (tools). In my opinion, this distinction is crucial for maintainability.</p></p><p>The capability maps came from real projects. For instance, I added \"conflict_resolution\" to the coordinator after running into situations where multiple agents tried to work on the same subtask.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Implementing Context-Aware Message Processing\n</h3><p>This is where the magic happens—how agents actually process incoming messages while maintaining context.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p><p>\nInitially, I tried to make agents too \"smart\"—giving them LLM integrations and complex decision trees. Then I realized that for many use cases, well-structured rule-based responses with clear role separation work beautifully and are much more predictable.</p></p><p>The key insight I had was that context awareness isn't about giving agents access to everything—it's about giving them access to relevant recent information. That's why  only pulls the last 3 messages from memory.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Building Helper Methods for Intelligence\n</h3><p>These utility methods make agents actually useful in practice:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p><strong>Why these helpers matter:</strong><p>\nFrom my experience, the difference between a demo and a production system is in the details. These helper methods provide observability and intelligence that becomes crucial when debugging multi-agent interactions.</p></p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Creating the Multi-Agent Orchestration System\n</h3><p>Now we bring it all together with an orchestrator that manages multiple agents:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p><strong>The orchestration philosophy:</strong><p>\nWhen I designed this, I thought carefully about the flow. Each agent needs to build on the previous agent's work while maintaining its own context. The coordinator bookends the process—starting with decomposition and ending with synthesis.</p></p><p>As per my experience, this linear flow works well for most tasks. For more complex scenarios, I've experimented with parallel execution and dynamic routing, but this sequential approach is elegant and debuggable.</p><p>Finally, let's create a simple demo that shows everything in action:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p><p>\nI structured the demo to show progressive complexity—from single agent to multi-agent coordination to system-wide status. In my opinion, this pedagogical approach helps developers understand each layer before moving to the next.</p></p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Step-by-Step Installation\n</h3><p>From my experience setting this up across different environments, here's the cleanest approach:</p><div><pre><code>\npython intelligent-agent-system\nintelligent-agent-system\n</code></pre></div><p><strong>Step 2: Create Virtual Environment</strong> (I always recommend this)</p><div><pre><code>\npython  venv venv\n\n\nvenvcriptsctivate\nvenv/bin/activate\n</code></pre></div><p>Create a file called  and paste all the code blocks from the \"Let's Get Cooking\" section in order.</p><p><strong>Step 4: Test the Installation</strong></p><div><pre><code>python multi_agent_system.py\n</code></pre></div><p>You should see the demonstration run with all agents coordinating!</p><p>As I built this out, I added several configuration options that you might want to adjust:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Here's how I typically use this system in practice:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>From my experience, here are some patterns I've found useful:</p><p><strong>Pattern 1: Custom Agent Configuration</strong></p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p><strong>Pattern 2: Chaining Tasks</strong></p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p><strong>Pattern 3: Monitoring and Debugging</strong></p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Looking back on this journey of building multi-agent systems, I'm struck by how much I learned through trial and error. What started as a simple idea—\"let's make some AI agents talk to each other\"—evolved into a sophisticated orchestration system with context management, role specialization, and intelligent coordination.</p><p>In my opinion, the most important lesson is this: <strong>successful multi-agent systems aren't about making individual agents smarter—they're about making agents work together intelligently.</strong></p><p>The architecture I've shared here is the result of multiple production deployments, countless debugging sessions, and a lot of refactoring. It's not perfect (no system is), but it's practical, understandable, and extensible.</p><p>Through this journey, you've gained:</p><ul><li><strong>Architectural Understanding</strong>: How to design multi-agent systems with clear roles and responsibilities</li><li>: Techniques for maintaining and sharing context across agents</li><li>: Working code you can deploy and extend</li><li>: Real-world approaches to agent coordination and orchestration</li></ul><p>From my experience, here are the natural next steps:</p><ol><li>: Connect these agents to actual LLMs (GPT-4, Claude, etc.) for dynamic responses</li><li><strong>Implement Async Processing</strong>: Make agents work in parallel for better performance</li><li>: Add database storage for long-term memory and task history</li><li>: Implement proper logging and metrics for production use</li><li>: Robust error recovery and retry mechanisms</li></ol><p>The foundation is here. As per my observation, the developers who succeed with multi-agent systems are those who start simple (like we did) and iterate based on real-world needs.</p><p>I encourage you to take this code, experiment with it, break it, fix it, and make it your own.

I implemented this using a simple list of message objects, but with timestamp and metadata for context.</p><p>: When agents collaborate, they need to share relevant context without overwhelming each other with their entire history. I created a context extraction mechanism that pulls recent, relevant information.</p><p>: The coordinator maintains a bird's-eye view of the entire system state, tracking which agents are working on what.</p><p>From my experience, this three-tier approach balances autonomy with coordination beautifully.</p><p>Agents need to talk to each other, but how?</p><p>I designed a message-passing system with structured envelopes. Each message contains:</p><ul><li> (who's talking)</li><li> (what they're saying)</li><li> (context, priority, related tasks)</li></ul><p>This might seem over-engineered at first—I thought so too—but in production, I found that structured messages prevent the chaos that comes from free-form agent communication.</p><p>Now comes the fun part—actually building this system. I'll break down the code into logical blocks and explain my thinking behind each decision.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Building the Foundation: Agent Roles and Messages\n</h3><p>I started with the simplest possible foundation—defining what an agent can be and how they communicate.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p><p>\nIn my experience, using Enums for roles prevents typos and makes the code self-documenting. I chose dataclasses over regular classes because they're cleaner and come with free </p> and  methods.</p><p>The Message structure might look simple, but I added metadata after my first production deployment when I realized agents needed to pass contextual information beyond just content.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Creating the Agent Context Container\n</h3><p>Next, I needed a way to encapsulate everything an agent knows about itself.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p><p>\nFrom my observations, unbounded memory growth is a silent killer in production systems. That's why I added automatic memory trimming. I learned this the hard way when one of my early agents consumed 8GB of RAM after running for a week!</p></p><p>The  method exists because, as I discovered, agents rarely need their entire conversation history—usually just the recent context.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Implementing the Core Agent Class\n</h3><p>Here's where things get interesting. This is the heart of the system.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p><p>\nI structured it this way because I wanted clear separation between what an agent can do (capabilities) and what it uses to do it (tools). In my opinion, this distinction is crucial for maintainability.</p></p><p>The capability maps came from real projects. For instance, I added \"conflict_resolution\" to the coordinator after running into situations where multiple agents tried to work on the same subtask.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Implementing Context-Aware Message Processing\n</h3><p>This is where the magic happens—how agents actually process incoming messages while maintaining context.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p><p>\nInitially, I tried to make agents too \"smart\"—giving them LLM integrations and complex decision trees. Then I realized that for many use cases, well-structured rule-based responses with clear role separation work beautifully and are much more predictable.</p></p><p>The key insight I had was that context awareness isn't about giving agents access to everything—it's about giving them access to relevant recent information. That's why  only pulls the last 3 messages from memory.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Building Helper Methods for Intelligence\n</h3><p>These utility methods make agents actually useful in practice:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p><strong>Why these helpers matter:</strong><p>\nFrom my experience, the difference between a demo and a production system is in the details. These helper methods provide observability and intelligence that becomes crucial when debugging multi-agent interactions.</p></p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Creating the Multi-Agent Orchestration System\n</h3><p>Now we bring it all together with an orchestrator that manages multiple agents:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p><strong>The orchestration philosophy:</strong><p>\nWhen I designed this, I thought carefully about the flow. Each agent needs to build on the previous agent's work while maintaining its own context. The coordinator bookends the process—starting with decomposition and ending with synthesis.</p></p><p>As per my experience, this linear flow works well for most tasks. For more complex scenarios, I've experimented with parallel execution and dynamic routing, but this sequential approach is elegant and debuggable.</p><p>Finally, let's create a simple demo that shows everything in action:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p><p>\nI structured the demo to show progressive complexity—from single agent to multi-agent coordination to system-wide status. In my opinion, this pedagogical approach helps developers understand each layer before moving to the next.</p></p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Step-by-Step Installation\n</h3><p>From my experience setting this up across different environments, here's the cleanest approach:</p><div><pre><code>\npython intelligent-agent-system\nintelligent-agent-system\n</code></pre></div><p><strong>Step 2: Create Virtual Environment</strong> (I always recommend this)</p><div><pre><code>\npython  venv venv\n\n\nvenvcriptsctivate\nvenv/bin/activate\n</code></pre></div><p>Create a file called  and paste all the code blocks from the \"Let's Get Cooking\" section in order.</p><p><strong>Step 4: Test the Installation</strong></p><div><pre><code>python multi_agent_system.py\n</code></pre></div><p>You should see the demonstration run with all agents coordinating!</p><p>As I built this out, I added several configuration options that you might want to adjust:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Here's how I typically use this system in practice:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>From my experience, here are some patterns I've found useful:</p><p><strong>Pattern 1: Custom Agent Configuration</strong></p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p><strong>Pattern 2: Chaining Tasks</strong></p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p><strong>Pattern 3: Monitoring and Debugging</strong></p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Looking back on this journey of building multi-agent systems, I'm struck by how much I learned through trial and error. What started as a simple idea—\"let's make some AI agents talk to each other\"—evolved into a sophisticated orchestration system with context management, role specialization, and intelligent coordination.</p><p>In my opinion, the most important lesson is this: <strong>successful multi-agent systems aren't about making individual agents smarter—they're about making agents work together intelligently.</strong></p><p>The architecture I've shared here is the result of multiple production deployments, countless debugging sessions, and a lot of refactoring. It's not perfect (no system is), but it's practical, understandable, and extensible.</p><p>Through this journey, you've gained:</p><ul><li><strong>Architectural Understanding</strong>: How to design multi-agent systems with clear roles and responsibilities</li><li>: Techniques for maintaining and sharing context across agents</li><li>: Working code you can deploy and extend</li><li>: Real-world approaches to agent coordination and orchestration</li></ul><p>From my experience, here are the natural next steps:</p><ol><li>: Connect these agents to actual LLMs (GPT-4, Claude, etc.) for dynamic responses</li><li><strong>Implement Async Processing</strong>: Make agents work in parallel for better performance</li><li>: Add database storage for long-term memory and task history</li><li>: Implement proper logging and metrics for production use</li><li>: Robust error recovery and retry mechanisms</li></ol><p>The foundation is here. As per my observation, the developers who succeed with multi-agent systems are those who start simple (like we did) and iterate based on real-world needs.</p><p>I encourage you to take this code, experiment with it, break it, fix it, and make it your own. That's how I learned, and I think that's how you'll learn best too.</p><p>What complex task will your agents solve first?</p>","contentLength":11750,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Living with the GIL: Strategies for Concurrent Python","url":"https://dev.to/aaron_rose_0787cc8b4775a0/living-with-the-gil-strategies-for-concurrent-python-2d5e","date":1761789969,"author":"Aaron Rose","guid":321079,"unread":true,"content":"<p>Timothy and Margaret walked through the library's quiet reading room toward the small coffee shop in the corner.

You don't create and destroy processes for each task.

Why not just use multiprocessing for everything?\"</p><p>\"Great question. Try this experiment,\" Margaret said. She typed:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Timothy ran it and frowned at the output:</p><div><pre><code>Sequential: 0.0008s\nParallel: 0.1234s\nSpeedup: 0.01x\n</code></pre></div><p>\"The parallel version is 100x slower!\"</p><p>\"Because creating processes and moving data between them is expensive,\" Margaret explained. \"Each process needs its own Python interpreter, its own memory space.

Multiprocessing only makes sense when your tasks are large enough that the parallel speedup outweighs the communication cost.\"</p><p>She added, \"Oh, and not everything can be pickled. Lambda functions, local classes, open file handles—those can't be passed to worker processes. You need to use regular functions and simple data types.\"</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  A Different Kind of Concurrency: Async/Await\n</h2><p>Margaret ordered two coffees from the barista and turned back to Timothy. \"Now let me show you something completely different. Remember how threading helped with I/O because the GIL gets released?\"</p><p>\"Right,\" Timothy said. \"Network requests, file operations.\"</p><p>\"There's another way to handle I/O concurrency that doesn't use threads at all. It's called async/await, and it's based on cooperative multitasking.\"</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><div><pre><code>Blocking: 2.45s\nAsync: 0.51s\nSpeedup: 4.80x\n</code></pre></div><p>\"5x faster!\" Timothy exclaimed. \"But how? Is this using threads?\"</p><p>\"No threads at all,\" Margaret said. \"Just one thread, actually. Let me show you what's happening.\"</p><p>She drew another diagram:</p><div><pre><code>Traditional blocking I/O:\nTask 1: [Request]──wait──[Response] [Process]\nTask 2:                              [Request]──wait──[Response] [Process]\nTask 3:                                                           [Request]──wait──[Response]\n        └──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘\n                                    Total time: sum of all waits\n\nAsync/await:\nTask 1: [Request]──wait──[Response] [Process]\nTask 2: [Request]──wait──────────────[Response] [Process]\nTask 3: [Request]──wait──[Response]─────────────[Process]\n        └───────────────────────────────┘\n            Total time: longest wait\n</code></pre></div><p>\"While one task is waiting for I/O,\" Margaret explained, \"the event loop switches to another task. They all run in the same thread, taking turns, but they don't wait for each other. That's cooperative multitasking.\"</p><p>Timothy looked puzzled. \"But how does it know when to switch tasks?\"</p><p>\"The  keyword is the signal,\" Margaret said. \"When you write , you're telling Python: 'I'm about to wait for something. Feel free to run other tasks while I wait.'\"</p><p>She typed a clearer example:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><div><pre><code>Starting three tasks...\nTask 1: Starting\nTask 2: Starting\nTask 3: Starting\nTask 2: Finished after 1s\nTask 1: Finished after 2s\nTask 3: Finished after 3s\nTotal time: 3.00s\nResults: ['Task 1 result', 'Task 2 result', 'Task 3 result']\n</code></pre></div><p>\"They all started at once,\" Timothy observed, \"and the total time was 3 seconds, not 6.\"</p><p>\"Because they ran concurrently. Task 2 finished first even though it started at the same time as Task 1. The event loop was juggling all three, and they each waited independently.\"</p><p>\"But this is still one thread, right?\" Timothy asked.</p><p>\"One thread, one process, one GIL,\" Margaret confirmed. \"No parallelism at all. Just very efficient concurrency.\"</p><p>She leaned forward to emphasize her next point. \"This is critical: async/await only helps with I/O-bound work. It won't speed up CPU-bound tasks at all because everything still runs in one thread. For CPU parallelism, you still need multiprocessing.\"</p><p>Timothy took a sip of his coffee. \"So we have threading, multiprocessing, and async. When do I use which?\"</p><p>Margaret pulled out a piece of paper and drew a decision tree:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>\"Let me show you why this matters,\" Margaret said. She typed:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><div><pre><code>Threading (50 requests): 1.87s\nAsync (50 requests): 1.23s\n</code></pre></div><p>\"Async is faster,\" Timothy noted.</p><p>\"And more importantly, more efficient. Those 50 threads consume a lot more memory than the async event loop. Try it with 1000 requests and threading becomes painful. Async scales much better.\"</p><p>They finished their coffee. Margaret showed Timothy one more example.</p><p>\"In real applications, you often combine these strategies,\" she said. She typed:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>\"See how it works?\" Margaret pointed at the screen. \"The async event loop handles all the network requests concurrently. When data arrives,  sends the CPU-intensive processing to a separate process. The event loop doesn't block waiting for the CPU work—it continues handling other I/O.\"</p><p>\"Async for the I/O coordination, multiprocessing for the CPU work,\" Timothy said.</p><p>\"Exactly. You get the best of both worlds: efficient I/O concurrency and true CPU parallelism.\"</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  The Future: Life Without the GIL\n</h2><p>Timothy had been thinking about something. \"You mentioned at the start that the GIL might go away?\"</p><p>\"Maybe,\" Margaret said. \"There's a project called PEP 703 - making the GIL optional in Python 3.13 and beyond.\"</p><p>She pulled up a webpage on her phone. \"It's called 'nogil Python'. The idea is to make CPython work without the GIL, using more sophisticated locking mechanisms. It's experimental, but it's making progress.\"</p><p>\"So threading will just work for CPU-bound tasks?\" Timothy asked.</p><p>\"In nogil Python, yes. But there are trade-offs. Single-threaded code might be slower without the GIL's simplicity. C extensions would need updates. It's a massive change.\"</p><p>\"It's being actively developed. Whether it becomes the default depends on whether the benefits outweigh the costs. But even if it does, multiprocessing and async/await will still be important. They solve different problems.\"</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Understanding When to Use What\n</h2><p>Timothy opened a new file and started taking notes. \"Let me see if I've got this.\"</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>\"Perfect summary,\" Margaret said. \"You've got it.\"</p><p>Timothy closed his laptop, finally understanding Python's concurrency landscape.</p><p><strong>Multiprocessing creates separate Python interpreters</strong>: Each with its own GIL, enabling true parallelism.</p><p><strong>Process Pools manage workers efficiently</strong>: Reuse processes across tasks instead of creating new ones.</p><p><strong>Multiprocessing has overhead</strong>: Serializing and deserializing data between processes takes time.</p><p><strong>Only use multiprocessing for large tasks</strong>: Overhead dominates for small, quick operations.</p><p><strong>Async/await is cooperative concurrency</strong>: One thread switching between tasks at  points.</p><p><strong>Async doesn't use threads</strong>: It's single-threaded, event-loop based concurrency.</p><p><strong>Async releases control at await points</strong>: Other tasks run while one task waits for I/O.</p><p><strong>Threading is simpler for small I/O</strong>: Easier to understand and integrate into existing code.</p><p><strong>Async scales better for many I/O operations</strong>: Can handle thousands of concurrent operations efficiently.</p><p><strong>The event loop juggles tasks</strong>: Switches between them when they hit  points.</p><p><strong>CPU-bound work needs multiprocessing</strong>: It's the only way to achieve true parallelism in Python.</p><p><strong>I/O-bound work can use threading or async</strong>: Both release the GIL during I/O operations.</p><p><strong>Async is more memory efficient</strong>: No per-thread overhead, scales to many concurrent operations.</p><p><strong>You can combine strategies</strong>: Async for I/O coordination, multiprocessing for CPU work.</p><p><strong>PEP 703 might make GIL optional</strong>: Nogil Python is under development for Python 3.13+.</p><p>: May slow single-threaded code, requires C extension updates.</p><p><strong>The GIL will stay relevant</strong>: Even in a nogil future, understanding concurrency patterns matters.</p><p><strong>Choose based on workload type</strong>: CPU-bound → multiprocessing, many I/O → async, few I/O → threading.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Understanding Concurrency\n</h2><p>Timothy had discovered Python's strategies for concurrent and parallel execution.</p><p>Multiprocessing revealed that separate interpreters mean separate GILs, that creating processes has overhead but enables true CPU parallelism, and that Process Pools efficiently distribute work across a fixed number of worker processes.</p><p>He learned that async/await achieves concurrency without parallelism or threads, that cooperative multitasking switches between tasks at  points, and that the event loop can handle thousands of concurrent I/O operations in a single thread.</p><p>Moreover, Timothy understood that the choice between threading and async depends on scale, that threading is simpler for a few I/O operations while async scales better for many, and that neither threading nor async helps with CPU-bound Python code because they still share the GIL.</p><p>He learned that real applications often combine strategies, using async for I/O coordination and multiprocessing for CPU work, and that understanding the cost of serialization and inter-process communication is crucial for effective multiprocessing.</p><p>He understood that the GIL might become optional in future Python versions through PEP 703, but that this change involves trade-offs, and that even in a nogil future, understanding these concurrency patterns remains essential for writing efficient Python.</p><p>Most importantly, Timothy understood that choosing the right concurrency model starts with identifying whether work is CPU-bound or I/O-bound, that each strategy has specific strengths and costs, and that mastering Python's concurrency tools means knowing not just how they work but when to use each one.</p><p>The library was closing soon.

Remember how threading helped with I/O because the GIL gets released?\"</p><p>\"Right,\" Timothy said. \"Network requests, file operations.\"</p><p>\"There's another way to handle I/O concurrency that doesn't use threads at all. It's called async/await, and it's based on cooperative multitasking.\"</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><div><pre><code>Blocking: 2.45s\nAsync: 0.51s\nSpeedup: 4.80x\n</code></pre></div><p>\"5x faster!\" Timothy exclaimed. \"But how? Is this using threads?\"</p><p>\"No threads at all,\" Margaret said. \"Just one thread, actually. Let me show you what's happening.\"</p><p>She drew another diagram:</p><div><pre><code>Traditional blocking I/O:\nTask 1: [Request]──wait──[Response] [Process]\nTask 2:                              [Request]──wait──[Response] [Process]\nTask 3:                                                           [Request]──wait──[Response]\n        └──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘\n                                    Total time: sum of all waits\n\nAsync/await:\nTask 1: [Request]──wait──[Response] [Process]\nTask 2: [Request]──wait──────────────[Response] [Process]\nTask 3: [Request]──wait──[Response]─────────────[Process]\n        └───────────────────────────────┘\n            Total time: longest wait\n</code></pre></div><p>\"While one task is waiting for I/O,\" Margaret explained, \"the event loop switches to another task. They all run in the same thread, taking turns, but they don't wait for each other. That's cooperative multitasking.\"</p><p>Timothy looked puzzled. \"But how does it know when to switch tasks?\"</p><p>\"The  keyword is the signal,\" Margaret said. \"When you write , you're telling Python: 'I'm about to wait for something. Feel free to run other tasks while I wait.'\"</p><p>She typed a clearer example:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><div><pre><code>Starting three tasks...\nTask 1: Starting\nTask 2: Starting\nTask 3: Starting\nTask 2: Finished after 1s\nTask 1: Finished after 2s\nTask 3: Finished after 3s\nTotal time: 3.00s\nResults: ['Task 1 result', 'Task 2 result', 'Task 3 result']\n</code></pre></div><p>\"They all started at once,\" Timothy observed, \"and the total time was 3 seconds, not 6.\"</p><p>\"Because they ran concurrently. Task 2 finished first even though it started at the same time as Task 1. The event loop was juggling all three, and they each waited independently.\"</p><p>\"But this is still one thread, right?\" Timothy asked.</p><p>\"One thread, one process, one GIL,\" Margaret confirmed. \"No parallelism at all. Just very efficient concurrency.\"</p><p>She leaned forward to emphasize her next point. \"This is critical: async/await only helps with I/O-bound work. It won't speed up CPU-bound tasks at all because everything still runs in one thread. For CPU parallelism, you still need multiprocessing.\"</p><p>Timothy took a sip of his coffee. \"So we have threading, multiprocessing, and async. When do I use which?\"</p><p>Margaret pulled out a piece of paper and drew a decision tree:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>\"Let me show you why this matters,\" Margaret said. She typed:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><div><pre><code>Threading (50 requests): 1.87s\nAsync (50 requests): 1.23s\n</code></pre></div><p>\"Async is faster,\" Timothy noted.</p><p>\"And more importantly, more efficient. Those 50 threads consume a lot more memory than the async event loop. Try it with 1000 requests and threading becomes painful. Async scales much better.\"</p><p>They finished their coffee. Margaret showed Timothy one more example.</p><p>\"In real applications, you often combine these strategies,\" she said. She typed:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>\"See how it works?\" Margaret pointed at the screen. \"The async event loop handles all the network requests concurrently. When data arrives,  sends the CPU-intensive processing to a separate process. The event loop doesn't block waiting for the CPU work—it continues handling other I/O.\"</p><p>\"Async for the I/O coordination, multiprocessing for the CPU work,\" Timothy said.</p><p>\"Exactly. You get the best of both worlds: efficient I/O concurrency and true CPU parallelism.\"</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  The Future: Life Without the GIL\n</h2><p>Timothy had been thinking about something. \"You mentioned at the start that the GIL might go away?\"</p><p>\"Maybe,\" Margaret said. \"There's a project called PEP 703 - making the GIL optional in Python 3.13 and beyond.\"</p><p>She pulled up a webpage on her phone. \"It's called 'nogil Python'. The idea is to make CPython work without the GIL, using more sophisticated locking mechanisms. It's experimental, but it's making progress.\"</p><p>\"So threading will just work for CPU-bound tasks?\" Timothy asked.</p><p>\"In nogil Python, yes. But there are trade-offs. Single-threaded code might be slower without the GIL's simplicity. C extensions would need updates. It's a massive change.\"</p><p>\"It's being actively developed. Whether it becomes the default depends on whether the benefits outweigh the costs. But even if it does, multiprocessing and async/await will still be important. They solve different problems.\"</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Understanding When to Use What\n</h2><p>Timothy opened a new file and started taking notes. \"Let me see if I've got this.\"</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>\"Perfect summary,\" Margaret said. \"You've got it.\"</p><p>Timothy closed his laptop, finally understanding Python's concurrency landscape.</p><p><strong>Multiprocessing creates separate Python interpreters</strong>: Each with its own GIL, enabling true parallelism.</p><p><strong>Process Pools manage workers efficiently</strong>: Reuse processes across tasks instead of creating new ones.</p><p><strong>Multiprocessing has overhead</strong>: Serializing and deserializing data between processes takes time.</p><p><strong>Only use multiprocessing for large tasks</strong>: Overhead dominates for small, quick operations.</p><p><strong>Async/await is cooperative concurrency</strong>: One thread switching between tasks at  points.</p><p><strong>Async doesn't use threads</strong>: It's single-threaded, event-loop based concurrency.</p><p><strong>Async releases control at await points</strong>: Other tasks run while one task waits for I/O.</p><p><strong>Threading is simpler for small I/O</strong>: Easier to understand and integrate into existing code.</p><p><strong>Async scales better for many I/O operations</strong>: Can handle thousands of concurrent operations efficiently.</p><p><strong>The event loop juggles tasks</strong>: Switches between them when they hit  points.</p><p><strong>CPU-bound work needs multiprocessing</strong>: It's the only way to achieve true parallelism in Python.</p><p><strong>I/O-bound work can use threading or async</strong>: Both release the GIL during I/O operations.</p><p><strong>Async is more memory efficient</strong>: No per-thread overhead, scales to many concurrent operations.</p><p><strong>You can combine strategies</strong>: Async for I/O coordination, multiprocessing for CPU work.</p><p><strong>PEP 703 might make GIL optional</strong>: Nogil Python is under development for Python 3.13+.</p><p>: May slow single-threaded code, requires C extension updates.</p><p><strong>The GIL will stay relevant</strong>: Even in a nogil future, understanding concurrency patterns matters.</p><p><strong>Choose based on workload type</strong>: CPU-bound → multiprocessing, many I/O → async, few I/O → threading.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Understanding Concurrency\n</h2><p>Timothy had discovered Python's strategies for concurrent and parallel execution.</p><p>Multiprocessing revealed that separate interpreters mean separate GILs, that creating processes has overhead but enables true CPU parallelism, and that Process Pools efficiently distribute work across a fixed number of worker processes.</p><p>He learned that async/await achieves concurrency without parallelism or threads, that cooperative multitasking switches between tasks at  points, and that the event loop can handle thousands of concurrent I/O operations in a single thread.</p><p>Moreover, Timothy understood that the choice between threading and async depends on scale, that threading is simpler for a few I/O operations while async scales better for many, and that neither threading nor async helps with CPU-bound Python code because they still share the GIL.</p><p>He learned that real applications often combine strategies, using async for I/O coordination and multiprocessing for CPU work, and that understanding the cost of serialization and inter-process communication is crucial for effective multiprocessing.</p><p>He understood that the GIL might become optional in future Python versions through PEP 703, but that this change involves trade-offs, and that even in a nogil future, understanding these concurrency patterns remains essential for writing efficient Python.</p><p>Most importantly, Timothy understood that choosing the right concurrency model starts with identifying whether work is CPU-bound or I/O-bound, that each strategy has specific strengths and costs, and that mastering Python's concurrency tools means knowing not just how they work but when to use each one.</p><p>The library was closing soon.

Boy, was I wrong! Through months of experimentation, I discovered that building truly intelligent agent systems requires careful orchestration, context management, and specialized roles. In this comprehensive guide, I'll walk you through my journey of creating a production-ready multi-agent framework that actually works. You'll learn how to design specialized agents, implement context-aware coordination, build robust memory systems, and orchestrate complex tasks across multiple AI agents.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  What's This Article About?\n</h3><p>Have you ever wondered how large-scale AI systems handle complex tasks that require multiple perspectives and specialized knowledge? As per my experience building AI systems over the past few years, I realized that single-agent architectures hit a ceiling pretty quickly when dealing with real-world complexity.</p><p>This article is my deep dive into building sophisticated multi-agent systems where AI agents don't just exist independently—they collaborate, share context, maintain memory, and coordinate intelligently to solve problems that would overwhelm any single agent.</p><p>In my opinion, the future of AI isn't about building one super-intelligent agent, but rather about creating ecosystems of specialized agents that work together seamlessly. That's exactly what we're building here.</p><p>From my experience, keeping things simple but powerful is key. Here's what I chose for this implementation:</p><ul><li> - The backbone of our system</li><li> - For clean agent state management\n</li><li> - For type-safe role definitions</li><li> - Making code self-documenting</li><li> - Essential for debugging multi-agent interactions</li><li> - For structured inter-agent communication</li></ul><p>I intentionally avoided heavy frameworks because, in my opinion, understanding the fundamentals is more valuable than relying on black-box solutions.</p><p>Let me be honest—there are plenty of tutorials on AI agents out there. So why should you read this one?</p><p>From my perspective, most tutorials either oversimplify the problem or get lost in theoretical abstractions. I wrote this because I wanted something practical, something I could actually use in production systems.</p><p>: Every code snippet here is battle-tested. I've made the mistakes so you don't have to.</p><p>: Not toy examples, but actual patterns I use in production systems.</p><p>: Understanding how agents maintain and share context—something I struggled with for months.</p><p>: Patterns that work whether you have 3 agents or 30.</p><p>As per my experience, the biggest challenge isn't building individual agents—it's making them work together intelligently. That's what this guide solves.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  The Multi-Agent Architecture\n</h3><p>When I first approached this problem, I made a classic mistake: I tried to build everything at once. After several failed attempts, I realized I needed to think systematically.</p><p>In my observation, successful multi-agent systems follow a clear hierarchy. Let me walk you through how I designed this architecture.</p><h4>\n  \n  \n  Agent Roles and Specialization\n</h4><p>The first breakthrough came when I stopped trying to create generic agents and instead embraced specialization. Think about it like a well-run company—you don't hire generalists for everything; you have specialists who excel in their domains.</p><p>I identified four core roles based on my experience building production systems:</p><p><p>\nThis became the orchestrator in my system. As I thought about it, every complex task needs someone (or something) breaking it down into manageable pieces. The coordinator's job is task decomposition, priority management, and agent orchestration.</p></p><p><p>\nInformation gathering is its own skill. I gave this agent capabilities for data collection, source validation, and information synthesis. In my opinion, separating research from execution prevents contamination of concerns.</p></p><p><p>\nPattern recognition and insight generation require a different mindset than data gathering. This agent focuses purely on making sense of information—finding correlations, identifying trends, and generating actionable insights.</p></p><p><p>\nFinally, someone needs to actually do the work. The executor takes validated plans and implements them, handling action execution and result validation.</p></p><h4>\n  \n  \n  Context Management Strategy\n</h4><p>This was the hardest part to get right, and I went through three complete rewrites before landing on what I'll show you.</p><p>The challenge: How do agents maintain conversation context across multiple interactions while sharing relevant information with each other?</p><p>My solution uses a layered approach:</p><p>: Each agent maintains its own conversation history. I implemented this using a simple list of message objects, but with timestamp and metadata for context.</p><p>: When agents collaborate, they need to share relevant context without overwhelming each other with their entire history. I created a context extraction mechanism that pulls recent, relevant information.</p><p>: The coordinator maintains a bird's-eye view of the entire system state, tracking which agents are working on what.</p><p>From my experience, this three-tier approach balances autonomy with coordination beautifully.</p><p>Agents need to talk to each other, but how?</p><p>I designed a message-passing system with structured envelopes. Each message contains:</p><ul><li> (who's talking)</li><li> (what they're saying)</li><li> (context, priority, related tasks)</li></ul><p>This might seem over-engineered at first—I thought so too—but in production, I found that structured messages prevent the chaos that comes from free-form agent communication.</p><p>Now comes the fun part—actually building this system. I'll break down the code into logical blocks and explain my thinking behind each decision.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Building the Foundation: Agent Roles and Messages\n</h3><p>I started with the simplest possible foundation—defining what an agent can be and how they communicate.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p><p>\nIn my experience, using Enums for roles prevents typos and makes the code self-documenting. I chose dataclasses over regular classes because they're cleaner and come with free </p> and  methods.</p><p>The Message structure might look simple, but I added metadata after my first production deployment when I realized agents needed to pass contextual information beyond just content.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Creating the Agent Context Container\n</h3><p>Next, I needed a way to encapsulate everything an agent knows about itself.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p><p>\nFrom my observations, unbounded memory growth is a silent killer in production systems. That's why I added automatic memory trimming. I learned this the hard way when one of my early agents consumed 8GB of RAM after running for a week!</p></p><p>The  method exists because, as I discovered, agents rarely need their entire conversation history—usually just the recent context.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Implementing the Core Agent Class\n</h3><p>Here's where things get interesting. This is the heart of the system.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p><p>\nI structured it this way because I wanted clear separation between what an agent can do (capabilities) and what it uses to do it (tools). In my opinion, this distinction is crucial for maintainability.</p></p><p>The capability maps came from real projects. For instance, I added \"conflict_resolution\" to the coordinator after running into situations where multiple agents tried to work on the same subtask.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Implementing Context-Aware Message Processing\n</h3><p>This is where the magic happens—how agents actually process incoming messages while maintaining context.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p><p>\nInitially, I tried to make agents too \"smart\"—giving them LLM integrations and complex decision trees. Then I realized that for many use cases, well-structured rule-based responses with clear role separation work beautifully and are much more predictable.</p></p><p>The key insight I had was that context awareness isn't about giving agents access to everything—it's about giving them access to relevant recent information. That's why  only pulls the last 3 messages from memory.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Building Helper Methods for Intelligence\n</h3><p>These utility methods make agents actually useful in practice:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p><strong>Why these helpers matter:</strong><p>\nFrom my experience, the difference between a demo and a production system is in the details. These helper methods provide observability and intelligence that becomes crucial when debugging multi-agent interactions.</p></p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Creating the Multi-Agent Orchestration System\n</h3><p>Now we bring it all together with an orchestrator that manages multiple agents:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p><strong>The orchestration philosophy:</strong><p>\nWhen I designed this, I thought carefully about the flow. Each agent needs to build on the previous agent's work while maintaining its own context. The coordinator bookends the process—starting with decomposition and ending with synthesis.</p></p><p>As per my experience, this linear flow works well for most tasks. For more complex scenarios, I've experimented with parallel execution and dynamic routing, but this sequential approach is elegant and debuggable.</p><p>Finally, let's create a simple demo that shows everything in action:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p><p>\nI structured the demo to show progressive complexity—from single agent to multi-agent coordination to system-wide status. In my opinion, this pedagogical approach helps developers understand each layer before moving to the next.</p></p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Step-by-Step Installation\n</h3><p>From my experience setting this up across different environments, here's the cleanest approach:</p><div><pre><code>\npython intelligent-agent-system\nintelligent-agent-system\n</code></pre></div><p><strong>Step 2: Create Virtual Environment</strong> (I always recommend this)</p><div><pre><code>\npython  venv venv\n\n\nvenvcriptsctivate\nvenv/bin/activate\n</code></pre></div><p>Create a file called  and paste all the code blocks from the \"Let's Get Cooking\" section in order.</p><p><strong>Step 4: Test the Installation</strong></p><div><pre><code>python multi_agent_system.py\n</code></pre></div><p>You should see the demonstration run with all agents coordinating!</p><p>As I built this out, I added several configuration options that you might want to adjust:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Here's how I typically use this system in practice:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>From my experience, here are some patterns I've found useful:</p><p><strong>Pattern 1: Custom Agent Configuration</strong></p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p><strong>Pattern 2: Chaining Tasks</strong></p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p><strong>Pattern 3: Monitoring and Debugging</strong></p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Looking back on this journey of building multi-agent systems, I'm struck by how much I learned through trial and error. What started as a simple idea—\"let's make some AI agents talk to each other\"—evolved into a sophisticated orchestration system with context management, role specialization, and intelligent coordination.</p><p>In my opinion, the most important lesson is this: <strong>successful multi-agent systems aren't about making individual agents smarter—they're about making agents work together intelligently.</strong></p><p>The architecture I've shared here is the result of multiple production deployments, countless debugging sessions, and a lot of refactoring. It's not perfect (no system is), but it's practical, understandable, and extensible.</p><p>Through this journey, you've gained:</p><ul><li><strong>Architectural Understanding</strong>: How to design multi-agent systems with clear roles and responsibilities</li><li>: Techniques for maintaining and sharing context across agents</li><li>: Working code you can deploy and extend</li><li>: Real-world approaches to agent coordination and orchestration</li></ul><p>From my experience, here are the natural next steps:</p><ol><li>: Connect these agents to actual LLMs (GPT-4, Claude, etc.) for dynamic responses</li><li><strong>Implement Async Processing</strong>: Make agents work in parallel for better performance</li><li>: Add database storage for long-term memory and task history</li><li>: Implement proper logging and metrics for production use</li><li>: Robust error recovery and retry mechanisms</li></ol><p>The foundation is here. As per my observation, the developers who succeed with multi-agent systems are those who start simple (like we did) and iterate based on real-world needs.</p><p>I encourage you to take this code, experiment with it, break it, fix it, and make it your own. That's how I learned, and I think that's how you'll learn best too.</p><p>What complex task will your agents solve first?</p>","contentLength":11750,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"我的第一篇 API 发布文章","url":"https://dev.to/zaki_zaki_6190b1c9c92c066/wo-de-di-pian-api-fa-bu-wen-zhang-9i5","date":1761788605,"author":"zaki zaki","guid":321077,"unread":true,"content":"","contentLength":0,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Title: The Fierce Hockey Mom Who Took to the Ice to Protest Her Son's Team","url":"https://dev.to/yagyaraj_sharma_6cd410179/title-the-fierce-hockey-mom-who-took-to-the-ice-to-protest-her-sons-team-3b33","date":1761783941,"author":"Insights YRS","guid":321034,"unread":true,"content":"<h2>\n  \n  \n  Title: The Fierce Hockey Mom Who Took to the Ice to Protest Her Son's Team\n</h2><p>Description: Meet the incredible Czech woman who recently made headlines around the world for her bold protest against the penalties her son's hockey team was receiving.

I thought using multiple threads would make it faster, but...\" He pointed at the timing results. \"The multi-threaded version is actually .\"</p><p>She leaned in to see his code:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><div><pre><code>Single-threaded: 0.143s\nMulti-threaded:  0.156s\n</code></pre></div><p>\"The threaded version is slower,\" Timothy said. \"I have two CPU cores. Two threads. Two separate counting tasks. It should be twice as fast, right? What am I doing wrong?\"</p><p>Margaret smiled knowingly. \"You're not doing anything wrong. You've just discovered the GIL - the Global Interpreter Lock. Come with me to the Reference Section. I'll show you what's happening.\"</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  The Single Key to the Rare Books Room\n</h2><p>They walked through the stacks toward the Reference Section. Margaret gestured at the rare books collection behind a locked glass door.</p><p>\"See that locked room?\" Margaret asked.</p><p>Timothy nodded. \"The rare books collection. Only one person can access it at a time.\"</p><p>\"Exactly. And why's that?\"</p><p>\"Because we only have one key,\" Timothy said. \"And the books are too valuable to have multiple people handling them simultaneously.\"</p><p>\"Right. Now imagine we hired ten new librarians,\" Margaret continued, \"and we told them all to catalog rare books at the same time. What would happen?\"</p><p>Timothy thought for a moment. \"They'd all want the key at once. But there's only one key, so they'd have to take turns. Even with ten workers, only one could actually work at any given time.\"</p><p>\"Precisely!\" Margaret pulled out her laptop. \"That's exactly what's happening in your Python code. The GIL is Python's single key to executing code.\"</p><p>She opened a Python interpreter. \"Watch this. I'm going to show you what Python does internally.\"</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>\"Even if you create 100 threads,\" Margaret explained, \"only one thread can execute Python code at any given moment. The others must wait their turn, just like our librarians waiting for the rare books key.\"</p><p>\"So my two threads are just... taking turns?\" Timothy asked.</p><p>\"Exactly. They're not running simultaneously. They're passing the key back and forth.\"</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Why Python Has Only One Key\n</h2><p>Timothy frowned. \"But that seems insane. Why would Python deliberately make threading slower?\"</p><p>\"Great question,\" Margaret said. She led him over to the library's old card catalog. \"Let me show you the problem Python was trying to solve.\"</p><p>She pulled out one of the drawers and selected a card: <code>\"Moby Dick\" - Times borrowed: 47</code></p><p>\"Every time someone borrows this book, we update this number,\" Margaret explained. \"Now imagine two librarians both checking out copies of Moby Dick at exactly the same time.\"</p><p>She held up her hands like she was acting out two people:</p><p>\"Librarian 1 reads: 47. Adds one. Writes 48.\nLibrarian 2 reads: 47. Adds one. Writes 48.\"</p><p>Timothy's eyes widened. \"They both read 47, so they both wrote 48. The count only went up by one instead of two!\"</p><p>\"Exactly!\" Margaret opened her laptop. \"Python has the same problem with memory management. It's called reference counting.\"</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>\"Every Python object tracks how many references point to it. When the count hits zero, Python immediately frees the memory. Simple and efficient.\"</p><p>\"But if two threads try to update the same reference count at the same time...\" Timothy said slowly.</p><p>\"Same problem as our card catalog!\" Margaret sketched it out:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>\"The object now has four references but thinks it only has three,\" Margaret explained. \"When one reference disappears, Python frees the memory... while other references are still using it.\"</p><p>\"Crash,\" Timothy said quietly.</p><p>\"Crash, corruption, chaos,\" Margaret agreed. \"So Python's creators had a choice. They could put a lock on every single object—millions of lock operations per second, huge overhead, deadlock risks everywhere. Or they could put one big lock around the entire interpreter.\"</p><p>\"And they chose one big lock,\" Timothy said.</p><p>\"They chose simplicity and speed for the common case. This was the early 1990s. Multi-core processors were rare. Threading was mostly for I/O, not CPU parallelism. For those use cases, it was the right choice.\"</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Seeing the Problem More Clearly\n</h2><p>Timothy was still processing this. \"So threading is just... useless for CPU work in Python?\"</p><p>\"Let me show you something more dramatic,\" Margaret said. She typed a new example:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>She ran it. The output appeared:</p><div><pre><code>Single-threaded: 3.45s\nMulti-threaded:  3.52s\nSpeedup: 0.98x\n</code></pre></div><p>\"No speedup at all,\" Timothy observed. \"Actually slightly slower.\"</p><p>\"The slight slowdown is from managing the threads. The GIL forces them to run one at a time, taking turns holding the lock.\"</p><p>Timothy leaned back in his chair. \"So I can't use threading to speed up Python computation at all?\"</p><p>\"Not pure Python computation, no,\" Margaret said. \"But here's where it gets interesting. The GIL only prevents parallel execution of .\"</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  When Threading Actually Works\n</h2><p>Margaret pulled up a chair. \"Let me show you when threading does help.\"</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Timothy watched her run it:</p><div><pre><code>Single-threaded: 2.8s\nMulti-threaded:  0.6s\nSpeedup: 4.7x\n</code></pre></div><p>His jaw dropped. \"4.7x faster! How?\"</p><p>\"Because while one thread waits for a network response,\" Margaret explained, \"it releases the GIL. Other threads can run. During I/O operations, threads truly run concurrently.\"</p><p>She drew a quick diagram on a piece of paper:</p><div><pre><code>Thread 1: [Running Python] → [Waiting for network - GIL released] → [Running Python]\nThread 2:                     [Running Python while T1 waits]\nThread 3:                     [Running Python while T1 waits]\n</code></pre></div><p>\"It's like our librarians again,\" Timothy said, understanding dawning. \"If a librarian needs to wait for a book delivery from storage, they give back the key. Another librarian can work in the rare books room while they wait.\"</p><p>\"Perfect!\" Margaret beamed. \"That's exactly it. I/O operations release the GIL automatically. Network requests, file reads, database queries—all of these release the lock while they wait.\"</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  The CPU-Bound vs I/O-Bound Distinction\n</h2><p>Margaret opened a blank document. \"Let me show you the critical distinction.\"</p><p>She created a simple table:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>\"When your code is waiting,\" Margaret explained, \"the GIL gets released. When your code is computing, the GIL stays locked.\"</p><p>Timothy typed something on his own laptop. \"What about libraries like NumPy? I've heard they can use multiple cores.\"</p><p>\"Excellent question!\" Margaret said. She typed:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>\"Nearly 2x faster!\" Timothy exclaimed.</p><p>\"Because NumPy is written in C,\" Margaret explained. \"The C code explicitly releases the GIL while it's doing matrix operations. Pandas, Pillow, many scientific libraries do this. They drop the key while they work, allowing other threads to run.\"</p><p>\"So some libraries know how to work around it,\" Timothy said.</p><p>\"They don't work around it—they work  it. They release the lock when they don't need it.\"</p><p>They walked back toward the circulation desk. Timothy was still processing everything.</p><p>\"But this is 2025,\" he said. \"Why hasn't anyone removed the GIL? It seems like such a limitation.\"</p><p>Margaret leaned against the desk. \"Several reasons, actually. First, single-threaded Python is  because of the GIL. No lock overhead on every operation. Most Python programs are single-threaded or I/O-bound anyway.\"</p><p>\"So removing it would make the common case slower?\" Timothy asked.</p><p>\"Potentially, yes. Second, it makes writing C extensions much simpler. Extension authors can assume they're the only thread running. The entire Python C API is built around the GIL existing. Removing it would break thousands of extensions.\"</p><p>\"Backward compatibility,\" Timothy nodded.</p><p>\"Third, for most real-world programs, I/O is the bottleneck, not CPU. Your web server is waiting on database queries. Your data pipeline is waiting on API responses. Your script is waiting for file reads. The GIL doesn't matter for those.\"</p><p>Margaret pulled out her phone and showed him something. \"And fourth, for CPU-intensive work, Python has other solutions. That's what we'll cover in Part 2.\"</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Understanding the Pattern\n</h2><p>Timothy opened his laptop again. \"So let me see if I understand. I should use threading when...\"</p><p>He started typing test cases:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>\"Run them both with and without threading,\" Margaret suggested. \"See what happens.\"</p><p>Timothy wrote the test harness:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>He ran it and watched the results:</p><div><pre><code>CPU-bound task\n  Single: 1.23s\n  Multi:  1.26s\n  Speedup: 0.98x\n\nI/O-bound task\n  Single: 4.05s\n  Multi:  2.03s\n  Speedup: 2.00x\n</code></pre></div><p>\"Perfect!\" Margaret said. \"The CPU task gets no speedup—actually slightly slower from thread overhead. The I/O task gets 2x speedup because both threads can wait simultaneously.\"</p><p>Timothy looked up from his laptop. \"So the rule is: threading for I/O, something else for CPU?\"</p><p>\"Exactly. And that 'something else' is what we'll cover next time.\" Margaret glanced at the clock on the wall. \"We've got about an hour before the evening rush. Want to grab coffee and I'll explain multiprocessing and async/await?\"</p><p>Timothy grabbed his laptop. \"Definitely. But first—\" he pointed at his original code, \"now I know why this was slow. I was doing pure computation.\"</p><p>\"And threading won't help with that,\" Margaret confirmed. \"The GIL makes sure of it.\"</p><p>\"The GIL isn't a bug,\" Timothy said slowly. \"It's a design choice.\"</p><p>\"A design choice with clear trade-offs,\" Margaret agreed. \"Once you understand those trade-offs, you can choose the right tool for each job.\"</p><p>Timothy closed his laptop, the GIL finally making sense.</p><p><strong>The GIL is a single lock on the Python interpreter</strong>: Only one thread executes Python bytecode at a time.</p><p><strong>It exists to protect reference counting</strong>: Python's memory management isn't thread-safe without it.</p><p><strong>Fine-grained locking would be slower</strong>: Locking every object would hurt single-threaded performance.</p><p><strong>Threading doesn't help CPU-bound Python code</strong>: Pure Python computation runs one thread at a time.</p><p><strong>Threading does help I/O-bound code</strong>: The GIL releases during network, disk, and database operations.</p><p><strong>I/O operations automatically release the GIL</strong>: While waiting, other threads can run.</p><p><strong>C extensions can release the GIL</strong>: NumPy, Pandas, and similar libraries achieve parallelism this way.</p><p><strong>The GIL makes single-threaded code fast</strong>: No lock overhead for the common case.</p><p><strong>Most real programs are I/O-bound</strong>: Waiting for network/disk is usually the bottleneck, not CPU.</p><p><strong>The rare books room analogy</strong>: One key means one worker at a time, even with many workers.</p><p><strong>Card catalog race condition</strong>: Two simultaneous updates can corrupt the count.</p><p><strong>Reference counting needs protection</strong>: Without the GIL, memory corruption occurs.</p><p><strong>Module-level vs call-time imports parallel</strong>: Module imports happen once; call-time accesses happen when needed.</p><p><strong>Passing the key back and forth</strong>: Threads take turns executing, creating overhead without benefit.</p><p><strong>Check your task type first</strong>: Know if you're CPU-bound or I/O-bound before choosing concurrency.</p><p><strong>The GIL persists for backward compatibility</strong>: Removing it would break the C API and existing extensions.</p><p><strong>Libraries that know about the GIL work with it</strong>: They release it when doing non-Python work.</p><p><strong>Python 2.x to 3.x kept the GIL</strong>: Even major version changes didn't remove it.</p><p><strong>Understanding trade-offs enables good choices</strong>: The GIL isn't a limitation once you know the alternatives.</p><p>Timothy had discovered Python's most famous constraint and why it exists.</p><p>The GIL revealed that Python trades parallel execution for memory safety, that protecting reference counts required either many locks or one lock, and that Guido chose simplicity and single-threaded speed over parallelism.</p><p>He learned that the GIL only prevents parallel Python bytecode execution, that I/O operations automatically release the lock, and that C extensions can explicitly release it during computation, which explained why NumPy achieves parallelism despite the GIL.</p><p>Moreover, Timothy understood that threading still helps for I/O-bound tasks because waiting doesn't require holding the lock, that CPU-bound pure Python code gets no benefit from threading because only one thread can execute at a time, and that the shocking slowdown in his original code came from thread management overhead without any parallel execution benefit.</p><p>He learned about the reference counting problem that necessitated the GIL, why concurrent updates to reference counts cause memory corruption, and why fine-grained locking on every object would be slower than a single interpreter lock for most programs.</p><p>He understood that the GIL persists for pragmatic reasons including single-threaded performance, C extension simplicity, and the enormous backward compatibility cost of removal, and that most Python programs are I/O-bound anyway so the GIL rarely matters in production.</p><p>Most importantly, Timothy understood that the GIL isn't a flaw to work around—it's a design choice with clear trade-offs, that knowing whether code is CPU-bound or I/O-bound determines whether threading helps, and that choosing the right concurrency model starts with understanding this fundamental constraint.</p><p>The library was quiet as they walked toward the coffee shop. Margaret had one more thing to show him—how to actually achieve true parallelism in Python, even with the GIL in place.</p>","contentLength":13343,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Announcing Rust 1.91.0","url":"https://blog.rust-lang.org/2025/10/30/Rust-1.91.0/","date":1761782400,"author":"The Rust Release Team","guid":322278,"unread":true,"content":"<p>The Rust team is happy to announce a new version of Rust, 1.91.0.

The weather-based demand fluctuation and customer satisfaction metrics provide realistic variability that mirrors real-world business challenges.</p><p>: The code demonstrates excellent separation of concerns through distinct classes for game state, economy, progression, and events. This makes the program easily maintainable and extensible.</p><p>: By gamifying business concepts, the program makes abstract economic principles concrete and understandable. Players naturally learn about supply and demand, pricing strategies, and resource management through gameplay rather than theoretical study.</p><p>: Business schools and high schools can use this program to introduce students to entrepreneurship and economic principles in an engaging, hands-on format.</p><p>: Companies could adapt this framework for employee training programs, helping staff understand business fundamentals and decision-making processes.</p><p>: Individuals interested in entrepreneurship can use the game to experiment with business strategies and develop intuitive understanding of market dynamics.</p><p>: A high school economics teacher uses Lemonade Stand Tycoon as a semester-long project, with students competing to achieve the highest profits while learning about market forces. Student engagement increases by 60% compared to traditional textbook-based lessons.</p><p><strong>Corporate Training Program</strong>: A retail chain implements a modified version of the game to train new managers in inventory management and pricing strategies. Trainees who complete the simulation show 25% better performance in their first quarter compared to those who received only traditional training.</p><p><strong>Limitations and Improvements</strong>:</p><ul><li>The upgrade system is not fully implemented, limiting long-term strategic depth</li><li>Graphics are text-based only, which may not appeal to all users</li><li>Limited multiplayer or competitive features</li><li>Some advanced business concepts (marketing campaigns, competitor analysis) are simplified or missing</li></ul><ul><li>Implement a complete upgrade system with visual feedback</li><li>Add competitor AI that responds to player strategies</li><li>Include seasonal events and special customer types</li><li>Develop a graphical interface using libraries like Pygame or Tkinter</li><li>Readers can enhance the program in numerous ways. </li></ul><p>Here's one example extension:</p><div><pre><code># Add a marketing system to boost sales\nclass MarketingSystem:\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.campaigns = {\n            \"flyers\": {\"cost\": 10, \"boost\": 1.2, \"duration\": 3},\n            \"social_media\": {\"cost\": 25, \"boost\": 1.5, \"duration\": 5},\n            \"local_radio\": {\"cost\": 50, \"boost\": 2.0, \"duration\": 7}\n        }\n\n    def launch_campaign(self, state, campaign_type):\n        if campaign_type in self.campaigns:\n            campaign = self.campaigns[campaign_type]\n            if state.money &gt;= campaign[\"cost\"]:\n                state.money -= campaign[\"cost\"]\n                state.marketing_boost = campaign[\"boost\"]\n                state.marketing_duration = campaign[\"duration\"]\n                return True\n        return False\n</code></pre></div><p>This extension adds marketing mechanics that allow players to invest in customer acquisition, introducing new strategic decisions about short-term costs versus long-term benefits.</p><p>\nLemonade Stand Tycoon successfully transforms fundamental business education into an engaging, interactive experience.
