It has to do with conditionals when selecting between two results in the GPUs. Unfortunately there are a couple of educational websites out there that are spreading some misinformation, and it would be nice correcting that. I tried contacting the authors without success, so without further ado, here goes my attempt to fix things up a little:\nSo, say I have this code, which I actually published the other day:<div> snap45(  v )\n{\n     s = (v);\n     x = (v.x);\n     x&gt;?(s.x,):\n           x&gt;?s*():\n                      (,s.y);\n}</div>\nThe exact details of what it does don't matter for this discussion. All we care about is the two ternary operations deciding what's the final value this function should return. Indeed, depending on the value of the variable , the function will return one of three results, which are simple to compute. I could also have implemented this function with regular  statements, and all that I'm going to say in this article stays true.<p>\nNow, here's the problem - when seeing code like this, somebody somewhere will step up and invariably propose the following \"optimization\", which replaces what they believe (erroneously) are \"conditional branches\" in the code, by arithmetic operations. They will suggest something like this:</p><div> snap45(  v )\n{\n     s = (v);\n     x = (v.x);\n\n     w0 = (,x);\n     w1 = (,x)*(-w0);\n     w2 = -w0-w1;\n\n     res0 = (s.x,);\n     res1 = (s.x,s.y)*();\n     res2 = (,s.y);\n\n     w0*res0 + w1*res1 + w2*res2;\n}</div>\nThere are two things wrong with this practice. The first one shows an incorrect understanding of how the GPU works. In particular, the original shader code had no conditional branching in it. Selecting between a few registers with a ternary operator or with a plain  statement does not lead to conditional branching; all it involves is a conditional move (a.k.a. \"select\"), which is a simple instruction to route the correct bits to the destination register. You can think of it as a bitwise AND+NAND+OR on the source registers, which is a simple combinational circuit. I'll repeat it again - there is no branching, the instruction pointer isn't manipulated, there's no prediction involved, no pipe to flush, no instruction cache to invalidation, no nothing.<p>\nFor the record, of course GPUs can do real branching, and those are fine and fast and totally worth it when big chunks of code and computation are to be skipped given a condition. As with all things computing, always check the generated machine code to know what is happening exactly and when. But one thing you can safely assume without having to check any generated code - when moving simple values or computations like in my original example, you are guaranteed to not branch. This has been true for decades at this point, with GPUs. And while I'm not an expert in CPUs, I am pretty sure this is true for them as well.</p><p>\nThe second wrong thing with the supposedly optimized version is that it actually runs much slower than the original version. You can measure it in a variety of hardware. I can only assume that's because the </p> function is probably implemented with some sort of conditional move or subtract + bit propagation + AND.<div> step(  x,  y )\n{\n     x &lt; y ?  : ;\n}</div>\nEither way, using the step() \"optimization\" are either using the ternary operation anyways, which produces the  or  which they will use to mask in and out the different potential outputs with a series of arithmetic multiplications and additions. Which is wasteful, the values could have been conditionally moved directly, which is what the original shader code did.<p>\nBut don't take my word for it, let's look at the generated machine code for the original code I published:</p><div><div>\nGLSL<div> x&gt;?(s.x,):\n       x&gt;?s*():\n                  (,s.y);</div></div><div>\nAMD Compiler<div>     s0,      v3, , v1\n     v4, , v0\n     s1,   vcc, (v2), s0\n v3, 0, v3, vcc\n v0, v0, v4, vcc\n vcc, (v2), s1\n v1, v1, v3, vcc\n v0, 0, v0, vcc</div></div><div>\nMicrosoft Compiler<div>   r0.xy, l(, ), v0.xy\n   r0.zw, v0.xy, l(, )\n r0.xy, -r0.xyxx, r0.zwzz\n r0.xy, r0.xyxx\n  r1.xyzw, r0.xyxy, l4()\n   r2.xy, l(,), v0.xx  r0.z, l()\n r1.xyzw, r2.yyyy, r1.xyzw, r0.zyzy\n o0.xyzw, r2.xxxx, r0.xzxz, r1.xyzw</div></div></div>\nHere we can confirm that the GPU is not branching, as I explained. Instead, according to the AMD compiler, it's performing the required comparisons ( and  - cmp=compare, gt=greater than, ngt=not greated than), and then using the result to mask the results with the bitwise operations mentioned earlier ( - cnd=conditional).<p>\nThe Microsoft compiler has expressed the same idea/implementation in a different format, but you can still see the comparison (</p> - \"lt\"=less than) and the masking or conditional move ( - mov=move, c=conditionally).<p>\nThere are no jump/branch instructions in these listings.</p><p>\nSomething not related to the discussion but interesting, is that some of the </p> GLSL calls I had in my shader before the ternary operator we are discussing, didn't become GPU instructions but rather instruction modifiers, which is the reason you see them in the listing. This means you can think of abs() calls as being free.\nSo, if you ever see somebody proposing this<div> a = ( b, c, ( y, x ) );</div>\nas an optimization to\nthen please correct them for me.","contentLength":5296,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/1iq2z4j/dont_optimize_conditional_moves_in_shaders_with/"},{"title":"GitHub - yaitoo/xun: Xun is an HTTP web framework built on Go's built-in html/template and net/http package’s router (1.22).","url":"https://github.com/yaitoo/xun","date":1739628954,"author":"/u/imlangzi","guid":321,"unread":true,"content":"","contentLength":0,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1iq28it/github_yaitooxun_xun_is_an_http_web_framework/"},{"title":"What is Event Sourcing?","url":"https://newsletter.scalablethread.com/p/what-is-event-sourcing","date":1739628306,"author":"/u/scalablethread","guid":306,"unread":true,"content":"<p>Traditional data storage typically focuses on the current state of an entity. For example, in an e-commerce system, you might store the current state of a customer's order: items, quantities, shipping address, etc. Event sourcing takes a different approach. Instead of storing the current state directly, it stores the events that led to that state. Each event represents a fact that happened in the past. Think of it as a detailed log of transactions on your bank statement. These events are immutable and stored in an append-only event store. The core idea is that an application's state can be derived by replaying events in the order they occurred, just like you can get your current bank balance by replaying all the transactions from the beginning. This makes Event Sourcing particularly useful for applications that require a high degree of audibility and traceability.</p><p>Every change to the application state is captured as an event object in an Event Sourcing system. These events are then stored in an event store, a database optimized for handling event data. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how Event Sourcing works:</p><ol></ol><p>Reconstructing the state from events involves reading all the events related to an entity from the event store and applying them in sequence to reconstruct the current state. It's like simulating all the changes that have occurred to construct the current state. For example, consider an e-commerce application where an order goes through various states like \"Created,\" \"Paid,\" and \"Shipped.\" To determine the current state of an order, you would:</p><ol><li><p>Retrieve all events related to the order from the event store.</p></li><li><p>Initialize an empty order object.</p></li><li><p>Apply each event to the order object in the order in which they were stored.</p></li></ol><p>By the end of this process, the order object will reflect the current state of the order.</p><p>As the number of events grows, replaying the entire event stream to reconstruct the state can become slow and inefficient. This is where snapshots come in. A snapshot is a saved state of an entity at a specific point in time. Instead of replaying all events from the beginning, the application can load the latest snapshot and then replay only the events that occurred after the snapshot was taken. </p><ul></ul><ul></ul><p><em>If you enjoyed this article, please hit the ❤️ like button.</em></p><p><em>If you think someone else will benefit from this, then please 🔁 share this post.</em></p>","contentLength":2380,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/1iq20v8/what_is_event_sourcing/"},{"title":"Built a cli tool for generating .gitignore files","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1iq1ivv/built_a_cli_tool_for_generating_gitignore_files/","date":1739626739,"author":"/u/SoaringSignificant","guid":319,"unread":true,"content":"<p>I built this mostly as an excuse to play around with Charmbracelet’s libraries like Bubble Tea and make a nice TUI, but it also solves the annoying problem of constantly looking up .gitignore templates.

He’s perhaps best known for the groundbreaking TV series <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twin_Peaks\">Twin Peaks</a>, which inspired countless shows, including The X-Files, The Sopranos, and Lost.</p><p>Lynch was genuinely a good human being who cared deeply for his actors and crew. He discovered extraordinary talent like Naomi Watts, who had struggled to land a major role in a Hollywood movie after 10 years of auditioning. From the interviews he gave, it quickly becomes apparent that he respected people of all kinds and never put anyone down – even those who truly deserved it.</p><p>Lynch is famous for refusing to explain his movies. Although not a fan of his previous work, the great film critic Roger Ebert once wrote that <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mulholland_Drive_(film)\">Mulholland Drive</a> remained compulsively watchable while refusing to yield to interpretation.</p><p>While Lynch offered very little in terms of what his movies meant, he was generous in sharing his views on creativity, work, and life in general. As a tribute to Lynch, I’d like to share my perspective on his life lessons from a software developer’s viewpoint.</p><blockquote><p>Ideas are like fish. If you want to catch little fish, you can stay in the shallow water. But if you want to catch the big fish, you’ve got to go deeper.</p></blockquote><p>We’ve all got hundreds or even thousands of ideas floating around in our brains. But the really big ones are few and far between. Once you catch a good one –because they’re so rare– write it down immediately, says Lynch. From there, ideas attract other ideas and start to grow from their initial seed state. The final job is to translate those ideas into a medium, whether it’s a film, a painting, or software.</p><blockquote><p>The idea is the whole thing. If you stay true to the idea, it tells you everything you need to know, really. You just keep working to make it look like that idea looked, feel like it felt, sound like it sounded, and be the way it was.</p></blockquote><p>Software development is part art, part engineering. We don’t build the same software over and over again – virtually all software is crafted by hand, sometimes with help from AI. If you ask two developers to create a non-trivial program, it’s very likely that the programs they produce will be different, even if the functionality is the same. Under the hood, the programming language, data structures, and overall architecture may be completely different. And on the surface, the user interfaces may look nothing alike.</p><p>It’s a good habit to listen to what users have to say, but they often can only describe their problems – they rarely come up with good ideas to solve them. And that’s OK. It’s our job to find the right ideas, implement them well, and solve tricky problems in a way we, and hopefully the users, will love.</p><blockquote><p>My friend Bushnell Keeler, who was really responsible for me wanting to be a painter, said you need four hours of uninterrupted time to get one hour of good painting in, and that is really true.</p></blockquote><p>Like other creative fields, writing code requires deep concentration. We need to hold complex structures in our minds while working through problems. Switching between coding and other tasks disrupts  – that magical state of mind where we lose track of time and produce code effortlessly. That’s why many developers hate meetings – they are toxic to our productivity.</p><blockquote><p>I believe you need technical knowledge. And also, it’s really, really great to learn by doing. So, you should make a film.</p></blockquote><p>Software development is one of those rare fields where a college degree isn’t required to succeed. Yes, we should all know the basics, but in my experience, new college graduates often lack the practical knowledge to be effective developers.</p><p>The real learning happens through hands-on experience: building real projects, debugging tricky problems, collaborating with teams, and maintaining code over time. It’s crucial to never stop learning, experimenting, and iterating on our craft.</p><blockquote><p>Happy accidents are real gifts, and they can open the door to a future that didn’t even exist.</p></blockquote><p>Tim Berners-Lee invented the web in 1989, while working at CERN, the European Organization for Nuclear Research. Originally conceived to meet the demand for information sharing between scientists around the world, the web went mainstream within just a few years.</p><p>Linus Torvalds created Git due to a licensing dispute over BitKeeper, the original version control system used for Linux development. The need for a new tool led to Git becoming the most widely used version control system today.</p><blockquote><p>I feel that a set should be like a happy family.

I am fortunate enough to work and develop with these technologies every day as a machine learning engineer!</p><p>In this article, I will walk you through my journey to becoming a machine learning engineer, shedding some light and advice on how you can become one yourself!</p><p>In one of my previous articles, I extensively wrote about my journey from school to securing my first <a href=\"https://towardsdatascience.com/tag/data-science/\" title=\"Data Science\">Data Science</a> job. I recommend you <a href=\"https://medium.com/towards-data-science/how-i-became-a-data-scientist-no-cs-degree-no-bootcamp-82c321904986\">check out that article</a>, but I will summarise the key timeline here.</p><p>Pretty much everyone in my family studied some sort of STEM subject. My great-grandad was an engineer, both my grandparents studied physics, and my mum is a maths teacher.</p><p><em>So, my path was always paved for me.</em></p><p>I chose to study physics at university after watching The Big Bang Theory at age 12; it’s fair to say everyone was very proud!</p><p>At school, I wasn’t dumb by any means. I was actually relatively bright, but I didn’t fully apply myself. I got decent grades, but definitely not what I was fully capable of.</p><p>I was very arrogant and thought I would do well with zero work.</p><p>I applied to top universities like Oxford and Imperial College, but given my work ethic, I was delusional thinking I had a chance. On results day, I ended up in clearing as I missed my offers. This was probably one of the saddest days of my life.</p><p>Clearing in the UK is where universities offer places to students on certain courses where they have space. It’s mainly for students who don’t have a university offer.</p><p>I was lucky enough to be offered a chance to study physics at the University of Surrey, and I went on to earn a first-class master’s degree in physics!</p><p>There is genuinely no substitute for hard work. It is a cringy cliche, but it is true!</p><p>My original plan was to do a PhD and be a full-time researcher or professor, but during my degree, I did a research year, and I just felt a career in research was not for me. Everything moved so slowly, and it didn’t seem there was much opportunity in the space.</p><p>During this time, DeepMind released their<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXuK6gekU1Y&amp;t=1539s\"></a>documentary on YouTube, which popped up on my home feed.</p><p>From the video, I started to understand how AI worked and learn about neural networks, reinforcement learning, and deep learning. To be honest, to this day I am still not an expert in these areas.</p><p>Naturally, I dug deeper and found that a data scientist uses AI and machine learning algorithms to solve problems. I immediately wanted in and started applying for data science graduate roles.</p><p>I spent countless hours coding, taking courses, and working on projects. I applied to and eventually landed my first data science graduate scheme in September 2021.</p><p><em>You can hear more about my journey from a <a href=\"https://tobeadatascientist.substack.com/p/overcoming-rejection-lessons-from-egor-howell\">podcast</a>.</em></p><p>I started my career in an insurance company, where I built various supervised learning models, mainly using gradient boosted tree packages like CatBoost, XGBoost, and<a href=\"https://medium.com/towards-data-science/breaking-down-generalized-linear-models-d9212526e51d?sk=fda0298cebcb8e9e0c20cb6af8ed4f06\"> generalised linear models (GLMs)</a>.</p><p>I built models to predict:</p><ul><li> — Did someone fraudulently make a claim to profit.</li><li>— What’s the premium we should give someone.</li><li>— How many claims will someone have.</li><li> — What’s the average claim value someone will have.</li></ul><p>I made around six models spanning the regression and classification space. I learned so much here, especially in statistics, as I worked very closely with Actuaries, so my maths knowledge was excellent.</p><p>However, due to the company’s structure and setup, it was difficult for my models to advance past the PoC stage, so I felt I lacked the “tech” side of my toolkit and understanding of how companies use machine learning in production.</p><p>After a year, my previous employer reached out to me asking if I wanted to apply to a junior data scientist role that specialises in<a href=\"https://medium.com/@egorhowell/list/time-series-00bbfb9f5359\"> time series forecasting</a> and<a href=\"https://medium.com/@egorhowell/list/optimisation-algorithms-069bf9c6c8d5\"> optimisation</a> problems. I really liked the company, and after a few interviews, I was offered the job!</p><p>I worked at this company for about 2.5 years, where I became an expert in forecasting and combinatorial optimisation problems.</p><p>I developed many algorithms and deployed my models to production through AWS using software engineering best practices, such as unit testing, lower environment, shadow system, CI/CD pipelines, and much more.</p><p><em>Fair to say I learned a lot.&nbsp;</em></p><p>I worked very closely with software engineers, so I picked up a lot of engineering knowledge and continued self-studying machine learning and statistics on the side.</p><p>Over time, I realised the actual value of data science is using it to make live decisions. There is a good quote by<a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/posts/pau-labarta-bajo-4432074b_machinelearning-mlops-realworldml-activity-7195694289178214400-gZyw\"> Pau Labarta Bajo</a></p><p>ML models inside Jupyter notebooks have a business value of $0</p><p>There is no point in building a really complex and sophisticated model if it will not produce results. Seeking out that extra 0.1% accuracy by staking multiple models is often not worth it.</p><p>You are better off building something simple that you can deploy, and that will bring real financial benefit to the company.</p><p>With this in mind, I started thinking about the future of data science. In my head, there are two avenues:</p><ul><li> -&gt; You work primarily to gain insight into what the business should be doing and what it should be looking into to boost its performance.</li><li> -&gt; You ship solutions (models, decision algorithms, etc.) that bring business value.</li></ul><p>I feel the data scientist who analyses and builds PoC models will become extinct in the next few years because, as we said above, they don’t provide tangible value to a business.</p><p>That’s not to say they are entirely useless; you have to think of it from the business perspective of their return on investment. Ideally, the value you bring in should be more than your salary.</p><p>You want to say that you did “X that produced Y”, which the above two avenues allow you to do.</p><p>The engineering side was the most interesting and enjoyable for me. I genuinely enjoy coding and building stuff that benefits people, and that they can use, so naturally, that’s where I gravitated towards.</p><p>To move to the ML engineering side, I asked my line manager if I could deploy the algorithms and ML models I was building myself. I would get help from software engineers, but I would write all the production code, do my own system design, and set up the deployment process independently.</p><p><em>And that’s exactly what I did.</em></p><p>Coincidentally, my current employer contacted me around this time and asked if I wanted to apply for a machine learning engineer role that specialises in general ML and optimisation at their company!</p><p>Call it luck, but clearly, the universe was telling me something. After several interview rounds, I was offered the role, and I am now a fully fledged machine learning engineer!</p><p>Fortunately, a role kind of “fell to me,” but I created my own luck through up-skilling and documenting my learning. That is why I always tell people to show their work — you don’t know what may come from it.</p><p>I want to share the main bits of advice that helped me transition from a machine learning engineer to a data scientist.</p><ul><li> — A machine learning engineer is  an entry-level position in my opinion. You need to be well-versed in data science, machine learning, software engineering, etc. You don’t need to be an expert in all of them, but have good fundamentals across the board. That’s why I recommend having a couple of years of experience as either a software engineer or data scientist and self-study other areas.</li><li> — If you are from data science, you must learn to write good, well-tested production code. You must know things like typing, linting, unit tests, formatting, mocking and CI/CD. It’s not too difficult, but it just requires some practice. I recommend asking your current company to work with software engineers to gain this knowledge, it worked for me!</li><li> — Most companies nowadays deploy many of their architecture and systems on the cloud, and machine learning models are no exception. So, it’s best to get practice with these tools and understand how they enable models to go live. I learned most of this on the job, to be honest, but there are courses you can take.</li><li> — I am sure most of you know this already, but every tech professional should be proficient in the command line. You will use it extensively when deploying and writing production code. I have a basic guide you can checkout<a href=\"https://medium.com/towards-data-science/an-introduction-to-the-shell-676ee5b899df?sk=0c6e101165b4314b98ab39d11525366c\"> here</a>.</li><li><strong>Data Structures &amp; Algorithms </strong>— Understanding the fundamental algorithms in computer science are very useful for MLE roles. Mainly because you will likely be asked about it in interviews. It’s not too hard to learn compared to machine learning; it just takes time. Any course will do the trick.</li><li> — Again, most tech professionals should know Git, but as an MLE, it is essential. How to squash commits, do code reviews, and write outstanding pull requests are musts.</li><li> — Many MLE roles I saw required you to have some specialisation in a particular area. I specialise in time series forecasting, optimisation, and general ML based on my previous experience. This helps you stand out in the market, and most companies are looking for specialists nowadays.</li></ul><p>The main theme here is that I basically up-skilled my software engineering abilities. This makes sense as I already had all the math, stats, and machine learning knowledge from being a data scientist.</p><p>If I were a software engineer, the transition would likely be the reverse. This is why securing a machine learning engineer role can be quite challenging, as it requires proficiency across a wide range of skills.</p><h3><strong>Summary &amp; Further Thoughts</strong></h3><p>I have a free newsletter, <a href=\"https://dishingthedata.substack.com/\"></a>, where I share weekly tips and advice as a practising data scientist.

Every image you hover over isn’t just a visual placeholder; it’s a critical data point that fuels our sophisticated personalization engine. At Netflix, we call these images ‘impressions,’ and they play a pivotal role in transforming your interaction from simple browsing into an immersive binge-watching experience, all tailored to your unique&nbsp;tastes.</p><p>Capturing these moments and turning them into a personalized journey is no simple feat. It requires a state-of-the-art system that can track and process these impressions while maintaining a detailed history of each profile’s exposure. This nuanced integration of data and technology empowers us to offer bespoke content recommendations.</p><p>In this multi-part blog series, we take you behind the scenes of our system that processes billions of impressions daily. We will explore the challenges we encounter and unveil how we are building a resilient solution that transforms these client-side impressions into a personalized content discovery experience for every Netflix&nbsp;viewer.</p><h3>Why do we need impression history?</h3><p>To tailor recommendations more effectively, it’s crucial to track what content a user has already encountered. Having impression history helps us achieve this by allowing us to identify content that has been displayed on the homepage but not engaged with, helping us deliver fresh, engaging recommendations.</p><p>By maintaining a history of impressions, we can implement frequency capping to prevent over-exposure to the same content. This ensures users aren’t repeatedly shown identical options, keeping the viewing experience vibrant and reducing the risk of frustration or disengagement.</p><h4>Highlighting New&nbsp;Releases</h4><p>For new content, impression history helps us monitor initial user interactions and adjust our merchandising efforts accordingly. We can experiment with different content placements or promotional strategies to boost visibility and engagement.</p><p>Additionally, impression history offers insightful information for addressing a number of platform-related analytics queries. Analyzing impression history, for example, might help determine how well a specific row on the home page is functioning or assess the effectiveness of a merchandising strategy.</p><p>The first pivotal step in managing impressions begins with the creation of a Source-of-Truth (SOT) dataset. This foundational dataset is essential, as it supports various downstream workflows and enables a multitude of use&nbsp;cases.</p><h4>Collecting Raw Impression Events</h4><p>As Netflix members explore our platform, their interactions with the user interface spark a vast array of raw events. These events are promptly relayed from the client side to our servers, entering a centralized event processing queue. This queue ensures we are consistently capturing raw events from our global user&nbsp;base.</p><p>After raw events are collected into a centralized queue, a custom event extractor processes this data to identify and extract all impression events. These extracted events are then routed to an Apache Kafka topic for immediate processing needs and simultaneously stored in an Apache Iceberg table for long-term retention and historical analysis. This dual-path approach leverages Kafka’s capability for low-latency streaming and Iceberg’s efficient management of large-scale, immutable datasets, ensuring both real-time responsiveness and comprehensive historical data availability.</p><h4>Filtering &amp; Enriching Raw Impressions</h4><p>Once the raw impression events are queued, a stateless Apache Flink job takes charge, meticulously processing this data. It filters out any invalid entries and enriches the valid ones with additional metadata, such as show or movie title details, and the specific page and row location where each impression was presented to users. This refined output is then structured using an Avro schema, establishing a definitive source of truth for Netflix’s impression data. The enriched data is seamlessly accessible for both real-time applications via Kafka and historical analysis through storage in an Apache Iceberg table. This dual availability ensures immediate processing capabilities alongside comprehensive long-term data retention.</p><h4>Ensuring High Quality Impressions</h4><p>Maintaining the highest quality of impressions is a top priority. We accomplish this by gathering detailed column-level metrics that offer insights into the state and quality of each impression. These metrics include everything from validating identifiers to checking that essential columns are properly filled. The data collected feeds into a comprehensive quality dashboard and supports a tiered threshold-based alerting system. These alerts promptly notify us of any potential issues, enabling us to swiftly address regressions. Additionally, while enriching the data, we ensure that all columns are in agreement with each other, offering in-place corrections wherever possible to deliver accurate&nbsp;data.</p><p>We handle a staggering volume of 1 to 1.5 million impression events globally every second, with each event approximately 1.2KB in size. To efficiently process this massive influx in real-time, we employ Apache Flink for its low-latency stream processing capabilities, which seamlessly integrates both batch and stream processing to facilitate efficient backfilling of historical data and ensure consistency across real-time and historical analyses. Our Flink configuration includes 8 task managers per region, each equipped with 8 CPU cores and 32GB of memory, operating at a parallelism of 48, allowing us to handle the necessary scale and speed for seamless performance delivery. The Flink job’s sink is equipped with a data mesh connector, as detailed in our <a href=\"https://netflixtechblog.com/data-mesh-a-data-movement-and-processing-platform-netflix-1288bcab2873\">Data Mesh platform</a> which has two outputs: Kafka and Iceberg. This setup allows for efficient streaming of real-time data through Kafka and the preservation of historical data in Iceberg, providing a comprehensive and flexible data processing and storage solution.</p><p>We utilize the ‘island model’ for deploying our Flink jobs, where all dependencies for a given application reside within a single region. This approach ensures high availability by isolating regions, so if one becomes degraded, others remain unaffected, allowing traffic to be shifted between regions to maintain service continuity. Thus, all data in one region is processed by the Flink job deployed within that&nbsp;region.</p><h4>Addressing the Challenge of Unschematized Events</h4><p>Allowing raw events to land on our centralized processing queue unschematized offers significant flexibility, but it also introduces challenges. Without a defined schema, it can be difficult to determine whether missing data was intentional or due to a logging error. We are investigating solutions to introduce schema management that maintains flexibility while providing clarity.</p><h4>Automating Performance Tuning with Autoscalers</h4><p>Tuning the performance of our Apache Flink jobs is currently a manual process. The next step is to integrate with autoscalers, which can dynamically adjust resources based on workload demands. This integration will not only optimize performance but also ensure more efficient resource utilization.</p><h4>Improving Data Quality&nbsp;Alerts</h4><p>Right now, there’s a lot of business rules dictating when a data quality alert needs to be fired. This leads to a lot of false positives that require manual judgement. A lot of times it is difficult to track changes leading to regression due to inadequate data lineage information. We are investing in building a comprehensive data quality platform that more intelligently identifies anomalies in our impression stream, keeps track of data lineage and data governance, and also, generates alerts notifying producers of any regressions. This approach will enhance efficiency, reduce manual oversight, and ensure a higher standard of data integrity.</p><p>Creating a reliable source of truth for impressions is a complex but essential task that enhances personalization and discovery experience. Stay tuned for the next part of this series, where we’ll delve into how we use this SOT dataset to create a microservice that provides impression histories.

All the approaches featured in this post will be using this flow:</p> Expr IR --&gt; LLVM IR --&gt; Execution\" /&gt; Expr IR --&gt; LLVM IR --&gt; Execution\" class=\"align-center\" src=\"https://eli.thegreenplace.net/images/2025/decjit-python.png\" /&gt;\n<p>These are the steps that happen when a Python function wrapped with\nour educational  decorator is called:</p><ol><li>The function is translated to an \"expression IR\" - .</li><li>This expression IR is converted to LLVM IR.</li><li>Finally, the LLVM IR is JIT-executed.</li></ol><p>First, let's look at the  IR. Here we'll make a big simplification -\nonly supporting functions that define a single expression, e.g.:</p><div><pre></pre></div><p>Naturally, this can be easily generalized - after all, LLVM IR can be used to\nexpress fully general computations.</p><p>Here are the  data structures:</p><div><pre></pre></div><p>To convert an  into LLVM IR and JIT-execute it, we'll use this function:</p><div><pre></pre></div><p>It uses the  class to actually generate LLVM IR from .\nThis process is straightforward and covered extensively in the resources I\nlinked to earlier; take a look at <a href=\"https://github.com/eliben/code-for-blog/blob/main/2025/decjit/exprcode.py\">the full code here</a>.</p><p>My goal with this architecture is to make things simple, but .\nOn one hand - there are several simplifications: only single expressions are\nsupported, very limited set of operators, etc. It's very easy to extend this!\nOn the other hand, we could have just trivially evaluated the \nwithout resorting to LLVM IR; I do want to show a more complete compilation\npipeline, though, to demonstrate that an arbitrary amount of complexity can\nbe hidden behind these simple interfaces.</p><p>With these building blocks in hand, we can review the strategies used by\n decorators to convert Python functions into s.</p></div><div><p>Python comes with powerful code reflection and introspection capabilities out\nof the box. Here's the  decorator:</p><div><pre></pre></div><p>This is a standard Python decorator. It takes a function and returns another\nfunction that will be used in its place ( ensures that\nfunction attributes like the name and docstring of the wrapper match the\nwrapped function).</p><div><pre></pre></div><p>After  is applied to , what  holds is the\nwrapper. When  is called, the wrapper is invoked with\n.</p><p>The wrapper obtains the AST of the wrapped function, and then uses\n to convert this AST into an :</p><div><pre></pre></div><p>When  finishes visiting the AST it's given, its\n field will contain the  representing the function's\nreturn value. The wrapper then invokes  with this .</p><p>Note how our decorator interjects into the regular Python execution process.\nWhen  is called, instead of the standard Python compilation and\nexecution process (code is compiled into bytecode, which is then executed\nby the VM), we translate its code to our own representation and emit LLVM from\nit, and then JIT execute the LLVM IR. While it seems kinda pointless in this\nartificial example, in reality this means we can execute the function's code\nin any way we like.</p><div><h3>AST JIT case study: Triton</h3><p>This approach is almost exactly how the Triton language works. The body of a\nfunction decorated with  gets parsed to a Python AST, which then\n- through a series of internal IRs - ends up in LLVM IR; this in turn is lowered\nto <a href=\"https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/\">PTX</a> by the\n<a href=\"https://llvm.org/docs/NVPTXUsage.html\">NVPTX LLVM backend</a>.\nThen, the code runs on a GPU using a standard CUDA pipeline.</p><p>Naturally, the subset of Python that can be compiled down to a GPU is limited;\nbut it's sufficient to run performant kernels, in a language that's much\nfriendlier than CUDA and - more importantly - lives in the same file with the\n\"host\" part written in regular Python. For example, if you want testing and\ndebugging, you can run Triton in \"interpreter mode\" which will just run the\nsame kernels locally on a CPU.</p><p>Note that Triton lets us import names from the  package\nand use them inside kernels; these serve as the  for the language\n- special calls the compiler handles directly.</p></div></div><div><p>Python is a fairly complicated language with  of features. Therefore,\nif our JIT has to support some large portion of Python semantics, it may make\nsense to leverage more of Python's own compiler. Concretely, we can have it\ncompile the wrapped function all the way <a href=\"https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/main/InternalDocs/interpreter.md\">to bytecode</a>,\nand start our translation from there.</p><p>Here's the  decorator that does just this :</p><div><pre></pre></div><p>The Python VM is a stack machine; so we emulate a stack to convert the\nfunction's bytecode to  IR (a bit like an <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_Polish_notation\">RPN evaluator</a>).\nAs before, we then use our  utility function to lower\n to LLVM IR and JIT execute it.</p><p>Using this JIT is as simple as the previous one - just swap \nfor :</p><div><pre></pre></div><div><h3>Bytecode JIT case study: Numba</h3><p><a href=\"https://numba.pydata.org/\">Numba</a> is a compiler for Python itself. The idea\nis that you can speed up specific functions in your code by slapping a\n decorator on them. What happens next is similar in spirit to\nour simple , but of course much more complicated because it\nsupports a very large portion of Python semantics.</p><p>Numba uses the Python compiler to emit bytecode, just as we did; it then\nconverts it into its own IR, and then to LLVM using .</p><p>By starting with the bytecode, Numba makes its life easier (no need to rewrite\nthe entire Python compiler). On the other hand, it also makes some analyses\n, because by the time we're in bytecode, a lot of semantic information\nexisting in higher-level representations is lost. For example, Numba has to\nsweat a bit to recover control flow information from the bytecode (by\nrunning it through a special interpreter first).</p></div></div><div><p>The two approaches we've seen so far are similar in many ways - both rely on\nPython's introspection capabilities to compile the source code of the JIT-ed\nfunction to some extent (one to AST, the other all the way to bytecode), and\nthen work on this lowered representation.</p><p>The tracing strategy is very different. It doesn't analyze the source code of\nthe wrapped function at all - instead, it  its execution by means of\nspecially-boxed arguments, leveraging overloaded operators and functions, and\nthen works on the generated trace.</p><p>The code implementing this for our smile demo is surprisingly compact:</p><div><pre></pre></div><p>Each runtime argument of the wrapped function is assigned a , and\nthat is placed in a , a placeholder class which lets us\ndo operator overloading:</p><div><pre></pre></div><p>The remaining key function is :</p><div><pre></pre></div><p>To understand how this works, consider this trivial example:</p><div><pre></pre></div><p>After the decorated function is defined,  holds the wrapper function\ndefined inside . When  is called, the wrapper runs:</p><ol><li>For each argument of  itself (that is  and ), it creates\na new  holding a . This denotes a named variable in\nthe  IR.</li><li>It then calls the wrapped function, passing it the boxes as runtime\nparameters.</li><li>When (the wrapped)  runs, it invokes . This is caught by the overloaded\n operator of , and it creates a new  with\nthe s representing  and  as children. This\n is then returned .</li><li>The wrapper unboxes the returned  and passes it to\n to emit LLVM IR from it and JIT execute it with the\nactual runtime arguments of the call: .</li></ol><p>This might be a little mind-bending at first, because there are two different\nexecutions that happen:</p><ul><li>The first is calling the wrapped  function itself, letting the Python\ninterpreter run it as usual, but with special arguments that build up the IR\ninstead of doing any computations. This is the .</li><li>The second is lowering this IR our tracing step built into LLVM IR and then\nJIT executing it with the actual runtime argument values ; this is\nthe .</li></ul><p>This tracing approach has some interesting characteristics. Since we don't\nhave to analyze the source of the wrapped functions but only trace through\nthe execution, we can \"magically\" support a much richer set of programs, e.g.:</p><div><pre></pre></div><p>This  with our basic . Since Python variables are\nplaceholders (references) for values, our tracing step is oblivious to them - it\nfollows the flow of values. Another example:</p><div><pre></pre></div><p>This also just works! The created  will be a long chain of \nadditions of 's runtime values through the loop, added to the \nfor .</p><p>This last example also leads us to a limitation of the tracing approach; the\nloop cannot be  - it cannot depend on the function's arguments,\nbecause the tracing step has no concept of runtime values and wouldn't know\nhow many iterations to run through; or at least, it doesn't know this unless\nwe want to perform the tracing run for every runtime execution .</p><div><h3>Tracing JIT case study: JAX</h3><p>The <a href=\"https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/\">JAX ML framework</a> uses a tracing\napproach very similar to the one described here. The first code sample in this\npost shows the JAX notation. JAX cleverly wraps Numpy with its own version which\nis traced (similar to our , but JAX calls these boxes \"tracers\"),\nletting you write regular-feeling Numpy code that can be JIT optimized and\nexecuted on accelerators like GPUs and TPUs via <a href=\"https://github.com/openxla\">XLA</a>. JAX's tracer builds up an underlying IR (called\n<a href=\"https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/jaxpr.html\">jaxpr</a>) which can then be\nemitted to XLA ops and passed to XLA for further lowering and execution.</p><p>For a fairly deep overview of how JAX works, I recommend reading the\n<a href=\"https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/autodidax.html\">autodidax doc</a>.</p><p>As mentioned earlier, JAX has <a href=\"https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/jit-compilation.html\">some limitations</a>\nwith things like data-dependent control flow in native Python. This won't work,\nbecause there's control flow\nthat depends on a runtime value ():</p><div><pre></pre></div><p>When  is executed, JAX will throw an exception, saying something\nlike:</p><blockquote>\nThis concrete value was not available in Python because it depends on the\nvalue of the argument count.</blockquote><p>As a remedy, JAX has its\nown built-in intrinsics from the <a href=\"https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/jax.lax.html\">jax.lax package</a>.\nHere's the example rewritten in a way that actually works:</p><div><pre></pre></div><p> (and many other built-ins in the  package) is something JAX\ncan trace through, generating a corresponding XLA operation (XLA has support for\n<a href=\"https://openxla.org/xla/operation_semantics\">While loops</a>, to which this\n can be lowered).</p><p>The tracing approach has clear benefits for JAX as well; because it only cares\nabout the flow of values, it can handle arbitrarily complicated Python code,\nas long as the flow of values can be traced. Just like the local variables and\ndata-independent loops shown earlier, but also things like closures. This makes\nmeta-programming and templating easy .</p></div></div><div><p>The full code for this post is available <a href=\"https://github.com/eliben/code-for-blog/tree/main/2025/decjit\">on GitHub</a>.</p></div>","contentLength":10514,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"An art exhibit in Japan where a chained robot dog will try to attack you to showcase the need for AI safety.","url":"https://v.redd.it/sglstazd96je1","date":1739568243,"author":"/u/eternviking","guid":328,"unread":true,"content":"","contentLength":0,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/1iple9t/an_art_exhibit_in_japan_where_a_chained_robot_dog/"},{"title":"OpenAI: The Age of AI Is Here!","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97kQRYwL3P0","date":1739557087,"author":"Two Minute Papers","guid":357,"unread":true,"content":"<article>❤️ Check out Lambda here and sign up for their GPU Cloud: https://lambdalabs.com/papers\n\n📝 The paper \"Competitive Programming with Large Reasoning Models\" is available here:\nhttps://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06807\n\n📝 My paper on simulations that look almost like reality is available for free here:\nhttps://rdcu.be/cWPfD \n\nOr this is the orig.

Instead of directly listing specific competencies to develop and the motivation behind mastering them, I will briefly outline the most important approaches, presenting them in chronological order as they have been developed and used over the past decades in machine learning.</p><p>The reason is that I believe it is crucial to study these algorithms from the very beginning. In machine learning, many new methods are built upon older approaches, which is especially true for <a href=\"https://towardsdatascience.com/tag/nlp/\" title=\"NLP\">NLP</a> and computer vision.</p><p>For example, jumping directly into the implementation details of modern&nbsp;large language models (LLMs)&nbsp;without any preliminary knowledge may make it very difficult for beginners to grasp the motivation and underlying ideas of specific mechanisms.</p><p><em>Given this, in the next two sections, I will highlight in&nbsp;</em><em>&nbsp;the key concepts that should be studied.</em></p><p><strong>Natural language processing (NLP)</strong>&nbsp;is a broad field that focuses on processing textual information. Machine learning algorithms cannot work directly with raw text, which is why text is usually preprocessed and converted into numerical vectors that are then fed into neural networks.</p><p>Before being converted into vectors, words undergo&nbsp;, which includes simple techniques such as&nbsp;,&nbsp;<strong>stemming, lemmatization, normalization</strong>, or removing&nbsp;. After preprocessing, the resulting text is encoded into&nbsp;. Tokens represent the smallest textual elements in a collection of documents. Generally, a token can be a part of a word, a sequence of symbols, or an individual symbol. Ultimately, tokens are converted into numerical vectors.</p><p>The&nbsp;&nbsp;method is the most basic way to encode tokens, focusing on counting the frequency of tokens in each document. However, in practice, this is usually not sufficient, as it is also necessary to account for token importance — a concept introduced in the&nbsp;&nbsp;and&nbsp;&nbsp;methods. While TF-IDF improves upon the naive counting approach of bag of words, researchers have developed a completely new approach called embeddings.</p><p>&nbsp;are numerical vectors whose components preserve the semantic meanings of words. Because of this, embeddings play a crucial role in NLP, enabling input data to be trained or used for model inference. Additionally, embeddings can be used to compare text similarity, allowing for the retrieval of the most relevant documents from a collection.</p><blockquote><p><em>Embeddings can also be used to encode other unstructured data, including images, audio, and videos.</em></p></blockquote><p>As a field, NLP has been evolving rapidly over the last 10–20 years to efficiently solve various text-related problems. Complex tasks like text translation and text generation were initially addressed using&nbsp;<strong>recurrent neural networks (RNNs)</strong>, which introduced the concept of memory, allowing neural networks to capture and retain key contextual information in long documents.</p><p>Although RNN performance gradually improved, it remained suboptimal for certain tasks. Moreover, RNNs are relatively slow, and their sequential prediction process does not allow for parallelization during training and inference, making them less efficient.</p><p>Additionally, the original Transformer architecture can be decomposed into two separate modules:&nbsp;&nbsp;and&nbsp;. Both of these form the foundation of the most state-of-the-art models used today to solve various NLP problems. Understanding their principles is valuable knowledge that will help learners advance further when studying or working with other&nbsp;<strong>large language models (LLMs)</strong>.</p><p>When it comes to LLMs, I strongly recommend studying the evolution of at least the first three GPT models, as they have had a significant impact on the AI world we know today. In particular, I would like to highlight the concepts of&nbsp;&nbsp;and&nbsp;, introduced in&nbsp;GPT-2, which enable LLMs to solve text generation tasks without explicitly receiving any training examples for them.</p><p>Another important technique developed in recent years is&nbsp;<strong>retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)</strong>.&nbsp;<em>The main limitation of LLMs is that they are only aware of the context used during their training.</em>&nbsp;As a result, they lack knowledge of any information beyond their training data.</p><p>The retriever converts the input prompt into an embedding, which is then used to query a vector database. The database returns the most relevant context based on the similarity to the embedding. This retrieved context is then combined with the original prompt and passed to a generative model. The model processes both the initial prompt and the additional context to generate a more informed and contextually accurate response.</p><blockquote><p><em>A good example of this limitation is the first version of the ChatGPT model, which was trained on data up to the year 2022 and had no knowledge of events that occurred from 2023 onward.</em></p></blockquote><p>To address this limitation, OpenAI researchers developed a RAG pipeline, which includes a constantly updated database containing new information from external sources. When ChatGPT is given a task that requires external knowledge, it queries the database to retrieve the most relevant context and integrates it into the final prompt sent to the machine learning model.</p><p>The goal of distillation is to create a smaller model that can imitate a larger one. In practice, this means that if a large model makes a prediction, the smaller model is expected to produce a similar result.</p><p>In the modern era, LLM development has led to models with millions or even billions of parameters. As a consequence, the overall size of these models may exceed the hardware limitations of standard computers or small portable devices, which come with many constraints.</p><p>Quantization is the process of reducing the memory required to store numerical values representing a model’s weights.</p><p>This is where optimization techniques become particularly useful, allowing LLMs to be compressed without significantly compromising their performance. The most commonly used techniques today include&nbsp;,, and&nbsp;.</p><p>Pruning refers to discarding the least important weights of a model.</p><p>Regardless of the area in which you wish to specialize, knowledge of&nbsp;&nbsp;is a must-have skill! Fine-tuning is a powerful concept that allows you to efficiently adapt a pre-trained model to a new task.</p><p>Fine-tuning is especially useful when working with very large models. For example, imagine you want to use BERT to perform semantic analysis on a specific dataset. While BERT is trained on general data, it might not fully understand the context of your dataset. At the same time, training BERT from scratch for your specific task would require a massive amount of resources.</p><p>Here is where fine-tuning comes in: it involves taking a pre-trained BERT (or another model) and freezing some of its layers (usually those at the beginning). As a result, BERT is retrained, but this time only on the new dataset provided. Since BERT updates only a subset of its weights and the new dataset is likely much smaller than the original one BERT was trained on, fine-tuning becomes a very efficient technique for adapting BERT’s rich knowledge to a specific domain.</p><blockquote><p><em>Fine-tuning is widely used not only in NLP but also across many other domains.</em></p></blockquote><p>As the name suggests,&nbsp;&nbsp;involves analyzing images and videos using machine learning. The most common tasks include image classification, object detection, image segmentation, and generation.</p><p>Most CV algorithms are based on neural networks, so it is essential to understand how they work in detail. In particular, CV uses a special type of network called&nbsp;<strong>convolutional neural networks (CNNs)</strong>. These are similar to fully connected networks, except that they typically begin with a set of specialized mathematical operations called&nbsp;.</p><blockquote><p><em>In simple terms, convolutions act as filters, enabling the model to extract the most important features from an image, which are then passed to fully connected layers for further analysis.</em></p></blockquote><p>The next step is to study the most popular CNN architectures for classification tasks, such as&nbsp;<strong>AlexNet, VGG, Inception, ImageNet</strong>, and&nbsp;.</p><p>Speaking of the object detection task, the&nbsp;&nbsp;algorithm is a clear winner. It is not necessary to study all of the dozens of versions of YOLO. In reality, going through the original paper of the first YOLO should be sufficient to understand how a relatively difficult problem like object detection is elegantly transformed into both classification and regression problems. This approach in YOLO also provides a nice intuition on how more complex CV tasks can be reformulated in simpler terms.</p><p>While there are many architectures for performing image segmentation, I would strongly recommend learning about&nbsp;, which introduces an encoder-decoder architecture.</p><p>Finally, image generation is probably one of the most challenging tasks in CV. Personally, I consider it an optional topic for learners, as it involves many advanced concepts. Nevertheless, gaining a high-level intuition of how&nbsp;<strong>generative adversial networks (GAN)</strong>&nbsp;function to generate images is a good way to broaden one’s horizons.</p><blockquote><p><em>In some problems, the training data might not be enough to build a performant model. In such cases, the data augmentation technique is commonly used. It involves the artificial generation of training data from already existing data (images). By feeding the model more diverse data, it becomes capable of learning and recognizing more patterns.</em></p></blockquote><p>It would be very hard to present in detail the <a href=\"https://towardsdatascience.com/tag/roadmaps/\" title=\"Roadmaps\">Roadmaps</a> for all existing machine learning domains in a single article. That is why, in this section, I would like to briefly list and explain some of the other most popular areas in data science worth exploring.</p><p>First of all,&nbsp;<strong>recommender systems (RecSys)</strong>&nbsp;have gained a lot of popularity in recent years. They are increasingly implemented in online shops, social networks, and streaming services. The key idea of most algorithms is to take a large initial matrix of all users and items and decompose it into a product of several matrices in a way that associates every user and every item with a high-dimensional embedding. This approach is very flexible, as it then allows different types of comparison operations on embeddings to find the most relevant items for a given user. Moreover, it is much more rapid to perform analysis on small matrices rather than the original, which usually tends to have huge dimensions.</p><p> often goes hand in hand with RecSys. When a RecSys has identified a set of the most relevant items for the user, ranking algorithms are used to sort them to determine the order in which they will be shown or proposed to the user. A good example of their usage is search engines, which filter query results from top to bottom on a web page.</p><p>Closely related to ranking, there is also a&nbsp;&nbsp;problem that aims to optimally map objects from two sets, A and B, in a way that, on average, every object pair&nbsp;is mapped “well” according to a matching criterion. A use case example might include distributing a group of students to different university disciplines, where the number of spots in each class is limited.</p><p>&nbsp;is an unsupervised machine learning task whose objective is to split a dataset into several regions (clusters), with each dataset object belonging to one of these clusters. The splitting criteria can vary depending on the task. Clustering is useful because it allows for grouping similar objects together. Moreover, further analysis can be applied to treat objects in each cluster separately.</p><p>The goal of clustering is to group dataset objects (on the left) into several categories (on the right) based on their similarity.</p><p>&nbsp;is another unsupervised problem, where the goal is to compress an input dataset. When the dimensionality of the dataset is large, it takes more time and resources for machine learning algorithms to analyze it. By identifying and removing noisy dataset features or those that do not provide much valuable information, the data analysis process becomes considerably easier.</p><p>&nbsp;is an area that focuses on designing algorithms and data structures (indexes) to optimize searches in a large database of embeddings (vector database). More precisely, given an input embedding and a vector database, the goal is to&nbsp;&nbsp;find the most similar embedding in the database relative to the input embedding.</p><p>The goal of similarity search is to approximately find the most similar embedding in a vector database relative to a query embedding.</p><p>The word “approximately” means that the search is not guaranteed to be 100% precise. Nevertheless, this is the main idea behind similarity search algorithms — sacrificing a bit of accuracy in exchange for significant gains in prediction speed or data compression.</p><p>&nbsp;involves studying the behavior of a target variable over time. This problem can be solved using classical tabular algorithms. However, the presence of time introduces new factors that cannot be captured by standard algorithms. For instance:</p><ul><li>the target variable can have an overall&nbsp;, where in the long term its values increase or decrease&nbsp;<em>(e.g., the average yearly temperature rising due to global warming)</em>.</li><li>the target variable can have a&nbsp;&nbsp;which makes its values change based on the currently given period&nbsp;<em>(e.g. temperature is lower in winter and higher in summer)</em>.</li></ul><p>Most of the time series models take both of these factors into account. In general, time series models are mainly used a lot in financial, stock or demographic analysis.</p><p>Another advanced area I would recommend exploring is&nbsp;, which fundamentally changes the algorithm design compared to classical machine learning.&nbsp;In simple terms, its goal is to train an agent in an environment to make optimal decisions based on a reward system (also known as the&nbsp;<em>“trial and error approach”</em>).&nbsp;By taking an action, the agent receives a reward, which helps it understand whether the chosen action had a positive or negative effect.&nbsp;After that, the agent slightly adjusts its strategy, and the entire cycle repeats.</p><p>Reinforcement learning is particularly popular in complex environments where classical algorithms are not capable of solving a problem.&nbsp;Given the complexity of reinforcement learning algorithms and the computational resources they require, this area is not yet fully mature, but it has high potential to gain even more popularity in the future.</p><p>Currently the most popular applications are:</p><ul><li>.&nbsp;Existing approaches can design optimal game strategies and outperform humans.&nbsp;The most well-known examples are chess and Go.</li><li>.&nbsp;Advanced algorithms can be incorporated into robots to help them move, carry objects or complete routine tasks at home.</li><li>.&nbsp;Reinforcement learning methods can be developed to automatically drive cars, control helicopters or drones.</li></ul><p>This article was a logical continuation of the previous part and expanded the skill set needed to become a data scientist.

All the facets that describe the shape and meaning of interesting data are not always captured in a handful of pre-generated figures. While we have powerful technologies available for presenting interactive figures — where a viewer can rotate, filter, zoom, and generally explore complex data  —  they always come with tradeoffs.</p><p>Here I present my experience using a recently released Python library — <a href=\"https://marimo.io\">marimo</a> — which opens up exciting new opportunities for publishing interactive visualizations across the entire field of data science.</p><h2>Interactive Data Visualization</h2><p>The tradeoffs to consider when selecting an approach for presenting data visualizations can be broken into three categories:</p><ul><li> — what visualizations and interactivity am I able to present to the user?</li><li> — what are the resources needed for displaying this visualization to users (e.g. running servers, hosting websites)?</li><li> – how much of a new skillset / codebase do I need to learn upfront?</li></ul><p> is the foundation of portable interactivity. Every user has a web browser installed on their computer and there are many different frameworks available for displaying any degree of interactivity or visualization you might imagine (for example, this <a href=\"https://threejs.org/\">gallery of amazing things people have made with three.js</a>). Since the application is running on the user’s computer, no costly servers are needed. However, a significant drawback for the data science community is ease of use, as JS does not have many of the high-level (i.e. easy-to-use) libraries that data scientists use for data manipulation, plotting, and interactivity.</p><p> provides a useful point of comparison. Because of its <a href=\"https://flatironschool.com/blog/python-popularity-the-rise-of-a-global-programming-language/\">continually growing popularity</a>, some have called this the <a href=\"https://towardsdatascience.com/we-are-living-in-the-era-of-python-bc032d595f6a\">“Era of Python”</a>. For data scientists in particular, Python stands alongside R as one of the foundational languages for quickly and effectively wielding complex data. While Python may be easier to use than Javascript, there are fewer options for presenting interactive visualizations. Some popular projects providing interactivity and visualization have been <a href=\"https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/stable/\">Flask</a>, <a href=\"https://dash.plotly.com/\">Dash</a>, and <a href=\"https://streamlit.io/\">Streamlit</a> (also worth mentioning — <a href=\"https://docs.bokeh.org/en/latest/docs/gallery.html\">bokeh</a>, <a href=\"https://holoviews.org/\">HoloViews</a>, <a href=\"https://altair-viz.github.io/altair-tutorial/README.html\">altair</a>, and <a href=\"https://plotly.com/python/\">plotly</a>). The biggest tradeoff for using Python has been the cost for publishing – delivering the tool to users. In the same way that <a href=\"https://www.shinyapps.io/\">shinyapps</a> require a running computer to serve up the visualization, these Python-based frameworks have exclusively been server-based. This is by no means prohibitive for authors with a budget to spend, but it does limit the number of users who can take advantage of a particular project.</p><p><a href=\"https://pyodide.org/en/stable/\"></a> is an intriguing middle ground — Python code running directly in the web browser using <a href=\"https://webassembly.org/\">WebAssembly</a> (WASM). There are resource limitations (only 1 thread and 2GB memory) that make this impractical for doing the heavy lifting of data science. , this can be more than sufficient for building visualizations and updating based on user input. Because it runs in the browser, no servers are required for hosting. Tools that use Pyodide as a foundation are interesting to explore because they give data scientists an opportunity to write Python code which runs directly on users’ computers without their having to install or run anything outside of the web browser.</p><p>As an aside, <a href=\"https://towardsdatascience.com/python-based-data-viz-with-no-installation-required-aaf2358c881\">I’ve been interested previously in</a> one project that has tried this approach: <a href=\"https://github.com/whitphx/stlite\">stlite</a>, <a href=\"https://edit.share.stlite.net/\">an in-browser implementation of Streamlit</a> that lets you deploy these flexible and powerful apps to a broad range of users. However, a core limitation is that Streamlit itself is distinct from stlite (the port of Streamlit to WASM), which means that not all features are supported and that advancement of the project is dependent on two separate groups working along compatible lines.</p><ul><li>The interface resembles a Jupyter , which will be familiar to users.</li><li>Execution of cells is , so that updating one cell will rerun all cells which depend on its output.</li><li> can be captured with a flexible set of UI components.</li><li>Notebooks can be quickly converted into , hiding the code and showing only the input/output elements.</li><li>Apps can be run locally or converted into using WASM/Pyodide.</li></ul><p>marimo balances the tradeoffs of technology in a way that is well suited to the skill set of the typical data scientists:</p><ul><li> — user input and visual display features are rather extensive, <a href=\"https://docs.marimo.io/guides/working_with_data/plotting/#reactive-plots\">supporting user input</a> via Altair and Plotly plots.</li><li> — deploying as static webpages is basically free — no servers required</li><li> — for users familiar with Python notebooks, marimo will feel very familiar and be easy to pick up.</li></ul><h2>Publishing Marimo Apps on the Web</h2><p>As a simple example of the type of display that can be useful in data science, consisting of explanatory text interspersed with interactive displays, I have created a barebones <a href=\"https://github.com/FredHutch/marimo-publication\">GitHub repository</a>. Try it out yourself <a href=\"https://fredhutch.github.io/marimo-publication/\">here</a>.</p><p>Using just a little bit of code, users can:</p><ul><li>Generate visualizations with flexible interactivity</li><li>Write narrative text describing their findings</li><li>Publish to the web for free (i.e. using GitHub Pages)</li></ul><h2>Public App / Private Data</h2><p>This new technology offers an exciting new opportunity for collaboration — publish the app publicly to the world, but users can only see specific datasets that they have permission to access.</p><p>Rather than building a dedicated data backend for every app, user data can be stored in a generic backend which can be securely authenticated and accessed using a Python client library — all contained within the user’s web browser. For example, the user is given an OAuth login link that will authenticate them with the backend and allow the app to temporarily access input data.</p><p>As a proof of concept, I built a simple visualization app which connects to <a href=\"https://cirro.bio\">the Cirro data platform</a>, which is used at my institution to manage scientific data. Full disclosure: I was part of the team that built this platform before it spun out as an independent company. In this manner users can:</p><ul><li>Load the public visualization app — hosted on GitHub Pages</li><li>Connect securely to their private data store</li><li>Load the appropriate dataset for display</li><li>Share a link which will direct authorized collaborators to the same data</li></ul><p>As a data scientist, this approach of publishing free and open-source visualization apps which can be used to interact with private datasets is extremely exciting. Building and publishing a new app can take hours and days instead of weeks and years, letting researchers quickly share their insights with collaborators and then publish them to the wider world.</p>","contentLength":6594,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Hugo van Kemenade: Improving licence metadata","url":"https://hugovk.dev/blog/2025/improving-licence-metadata/","date":1739545860,"author":"","guid":162,"unread":true,"content":"<p><a href=\"https://peps.python.org/pep-0639/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">PEP 639</a> defines a spec on how to document licences\nused in Python projects.</p><p>Change  as follows.</p><p>I usually use Hatchling as a build backend, and support was added in 1.27:</p><div><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code></code></pre></div><p>Replace the freeform  field with a valid SPDX license expression, and add\n which points to the licence files in the repo.

But what is data engineering, and why is it so important? In this blog post, we will discuss the essential components of a functioning data engineering practice and why data engineering is becoming increasingly critical for businesses today, and how you can build your very own Data Engineering Center of Excellence!</p><p>I’ve had the privilege to build, manage, lead, and foster a sizeable high-performing team of data warehouse &amp; ELT engineers for many years. With the help of my team, I have spent a considerable amount of time every year consciously planning and preparing to manage the growth of our data month-over-month and address the changing reporting and analytics needs for our&nbsp;<em>20000+ global data consumers</em>. We built many data warehouses to store and centralize massive amounts of data generated from many OLTP sources. We’ve implemented Kimball methodology by creating star schemas both within our on-premise data warehouses and in the ones in the cloud.</p><p>The objective is to enable our user-base to perform fast analytics and reporting on the data; so our analysts’ community and business users can make accurate data-driven decisions.</p><p>It took me about three years to transform&nbsp;&nbsp;() of data warehouse and ETL programmers into one cohesive Data Engineering team.</p><p><em>I have compiled some of my learnings building a global data engineering team in this post in hopes that Data professionals and leaders of all levels of technical proficiency can benefit.</em></p><h2>Evolution of the Data Engineer</h2><p>It has never been a better time to be a data engineer. Over the last decade, we have seen a massive awakening of enterprises now recognizing their data as the company’s heartbeat, making data engineering the job function that ensures accurate, current, and quality data flow to the solutions that depend on it.</p><p>Historically, the role of Data Engineers has evolved from that of&nbsp;<strong><em>data warehouse developers&nbsp;</em></strong>and the&nbsp;&nbsp;(extract, transform and load).</p><p>The data warehouse developers are responsible for designing, building, developing, administering, and maintaining data warehouses to meet an enterprise’s reporting needs. This is done primarily via extracting data from operational and transactional systems and piping it using extract transform load methodology (ETL/ ELT) to a storage layer like a data warehouse or a data lake. The data warehouse or the data lake is where data analysts, data scientists, and business users consume data. The developers also perform transformations to conform the ingested data to a data model with aggregated data for easy analysis.</p><blockquote><p>A data engineer’s prime responsibility is to produce and make data securely available for multiple consumers.</p></blockquote><p>Data engineers oversee the ingestion, transformation, modeling, delivery, and movement of data through every part of an organization. Data extraction happens from many different data sources &amp; applications. Data Engineers load the data into data warehouses and data lakes, which are transformed not just for the <a href=\"https://towardsdatascience.com/tag/data-science/\" title=\"Data Science\">Data Science</a> &amp; predictive analytics initiatives (as everyone likes to talk about) but primarily for data analysts. Data analysts &amp; data scientists perform operational reporting, exploratory analytics, service-level agreement (SLA) based business intelligence reports and dashboards on the catered data. In this book, we will address all of these job functions.</p><p>The role of a data engineer is to acquire, store, and aggregate data from both cloud and on-premise, new, and existing systems, with data modeling and feasible data architecture. Without the data engineers, analysts and data scientists won’t have valuable data to work with, and hence, data engineers are the first to be hired at the inception of every new data team. Based on the data and analytics tools available within an enterprise, data engineering teams’ role profiles, constructs, and approaches have several options for what should be included in their responsibilities which we will discuss in this chapter.</p><p>Software is increasingly automating the historically manual and tedious tasks of data engineers. Data processing tools and technologies have evolved massively over several years and will continue to grow. For example, cloud-based data warehouses (Snowflake, for instance) have made data storage and processing affordable and fast. Data pipeline services (like&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.informatica.com/blogs/welcome-to-informatica-intelligent-cloud-services.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Informatica IICS</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://airflow.apache.org/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Apache Airflow</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.matillion.com/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Matillion</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://fivetran.com/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Fivetran</a>) have turned data extraction into work that can be completed quickly and efficiently. The data engineering team should be leveraging such technologies as force multipliers, taking a consistent and cohesive approach to integration and management of enterprise data, not just relying on legacy siloed approaches to building custom data pipelines with fragile, non-performant, hard to maintain code. Continuing with the latter approach will stifle the pace of innovation within the said enterprise and force the future focus to be around managing data infrastructure issues rather than how to help generate value for your business.</p><p>The primary role of an enterprise Data Engineering team should be to&nbsp;&nbsp;into a shape that’s ready for analysis — laying the foundation for real-world analytics and data science application.</p><p>The Data Engineering team should serve as the&nbsp;&nbsp;for enterprise-level data with the responsibility to curate the organization’s data and act as a resource for those who want to make use of it, such as Reporting &amp; Analytics teams, Data Science teams, and other groups that are doing more self-service or business group driven analytics leveraging the enterprise data platform. This team should serve as the&nbsp;&nbsp;of organizational knowledge, managing and refining the catalog so that analysis can be done more effectively. Let’s look at the essential responsibilities of a well-functioning Data Engineering team.</p><h2>Responsibilities of a Data Engineering Team</h2><p>The Data Engineering team should provide a&nbsp;&nbsp;within the enterprise that cuts across to support both the Reporting/Analytics and Data Science capabilities to provide access to clean, transformed, formatted, scalable, and secure data ready for analysis. The Data Engineering teams’ core responsibilities should include:</p><blockquote><p>· Build, manage, and optimize the core data platform infrastructure</p><p>· Build and maintain custom and off-the-shelf data integrations and ingestion pipelines from a variety of structured and unstructured sources</p><p>· Manage overall data pipeline orchestration</p><p>· Manage transformation of data either before or after load of raw data through both technical processes and business logic</p><p>· Support analytics teams with design and performance optimizations of data warehouses</p></blockquote><p><strong><em>Data is an Enterprise Asset.</em></strong></p><p><strong><em>Data as an Asset should be shared and protected.</em></strong></p><p>Data should be valued as an Enterprise asset, leveraged across all Business Units to enhance the company’s value to its respective customer base by accelerating decision making, and improving competitive advantage with the help of data. Good data stewardship, legal and regulatory requirements dictate that we protect the data owned from unauthorized access and disclosure.</p><p>In other words,&nbsp;<strong><em>managing Security is a crucial responsibility.</em></strong></p><h2>Why Create a Centralized Data Engineering Team?</h2><p>Treating Data Engineering as a standard and core capability that underpins both the Analytics and Data Science capabilities will help an enterprise evolve how to approach Data and Analytics. The enterprise needs to stop vertically treating data based on the technology stack involved as we tend to see often and move to more of a horizontal approach of managing a&nbsp;&nbsp;or&nbsp;&nbsp;that cuts across the organization and can connect to various technologies as needed drive analytic initiatives. This is a new way of thinking and working, but it can drive efficiency as the various data organizations look to scale. Additionally — there is value in creating a dedicated structure and career path for Data Engineering resources. Data engineering skill sets are in high demand in the market; therefore, hiring outside the company can be costly. Companies must enable programmers, database administrators, and software developers with a career path to gain the needed experience with the above-defined skillsets by working across technologies. Usually, forming a data engineering center of excellence or a capability center would be the first step for making such progression possible.</p><h2>Challenges for creating a centralized Data Engineering Team</h2><p>The centralization of the Data Engineering team as a service approach is different from how Reporting &amp; Analytics and Data Science teams operate. It does, in principle, mean&nbsp;<strong><em>giving up some level of control of resources</em></strong>&nbsp;and establishing new processes for how these teams will collaborate and work together to deliver initiatives.</p><p>The Data Engineering team will need to demonstrate that it can effectively support the needs of both Reporting &amp; Analytics and Data Science teams, no matter how large these teams are. Data Engineering teams must&nbsp;<strong><em>effectively prioritize workloads&nbsp;</em></strong>while ensuring they can bring the right skillsets and experience to assigned projects.</p><p>Data engineering is essential because it serves as the backbone of data-driven companies. It enables analysts to work with clean and well-organized data, necessary for deriving insights and making sound decisions. To build a functioning data engineering practice, you need the following critical components:</p><p>The Data Engineering team should be a core capability within the enterprise, but it should effectively serve as a support function involved in almost everything data-related. It should interact with the Reporting and Analytics and Data Science teams in a collaborative support role to make the entire team successful.</p><p>The&nbsp;<em>Data Engineering team doesn’t create direct business value</em>&nbsp;— but the value should come in making the Reporting and Analytics, and Data Science teams more productive and efficient to ensure delivery of maximum value to business stakeholders through Data &amp; Analytics initiatives. To make that possible, the six key responsibilities within the data engineering capability center would be as follow –</p><p>Let’s review the&nbsp;<strong><em>6 pillars of responsibilities</em></strong>:</p><p><strong>1. Determine Central Data Location for Collation and Wrangling</strong></p><p>Understanding and having a strategy for a&nbsp;(<em>a centralized data repository or data warehouse for the mass consumption of data for analysis</em>). Defining requisite data tables and where they will be joined in the context of data engineering and subsequently converting raw data into digestible and valuable formats.</p><p><strong>2. Data Ingestion and Transformation</strong></p><p>Moving data from one or more sources to a new destination (<em>your data lake or cloud data warehouse)&nbsp;</em>where it can be stored and further analyzed and then converting data from the format of the source system to that of the destination</p><p>Extracting, transforming, and loading data from one or more sources into a destination system to represent the data in a new context or style.</p><p>Data modeling is an essential function of a data engineering team, granted not all data engineers excel with this capability. Formalizing relationships between data objects and business rules into a conceptual representation through understanding information system workflows, modeling required queries, designing tables, determining primary keys, and effectively utilizing data to create informed output.</p><p>I’ve seen engineers in interviews mess up more with this than coding in technical discussions. It’s essential to understand the differences between Dimensions, Facts, Aggregate tables.</p><p>Ensuring that sensitive data is protected and implementing proper authentication and authorization to reduce the risk of a data breach</p><p><strong>6.

We raised money to do that, and to place some bets; one of them: GPU-enabling our customers. A progress report: GPUs aren’t going anywhere, but: GPUs aren’t going anywhere.</p></div><p>A Fly Machine is a <a href=\"https://fly.io/blog/docker-without-docker/\">Docker/OCI container</a> running inside a hardware-virtualized virtual machine somewhere on our global fleet of bare-metal worker servers. A GPU Machine is a Fly Machine with a hardware-mapped Nvidia GPU. It’s a Fly Machine that can do fast CUDA.</p><p>Like everybody else in our industry, we were right about the importance of AI/ML. If anything, we underestimated its importance. But the product we came up with probably doesn’t fit the moment. It’s a bet that doesn’t feel like it’s paying off.</p><p><strong>If you’re using Fly GPU Machines, don’t freak out; we’re not getting rid of them.</strong> But if you’re waiting for us to do something bigger with them, a v2 of the product, you’ll probably be waiting awhile.</p><p>GPU Machines were not a small project for us. Fly Machines run on an idiosyncratically small hypervisor (normally Firecracker, but for GPU Machines <a href=\"https://github.com/cloud-hypervisor/cloud-hypervisor\">Intel’s Cloud Hypervisor</a>, a very similar Rust codebase that supports PCI passthrough). The Nvidia ecosystem is not geared to supporting micro-VM hypervisors.</p><p>GPUs <a href=\"https://googleprojectzero.blogspot.com/2020/09/attacking-qualcomm-adreno-gpu.html\">terrified our security team</a>. A GPU is just about the worst case hardware peripheral: intense multi-directional direct memory transfers</p><div><p>(not even bidirectional: in common configurations, GPUs talk to each other)</p></div><p>with arbitrary, end-user controlled computation, all operating outside our normal security boundary.</p><p>We did a couple expensive things to mitigate the risk. We shipped GPUs on dedicated server hardware, so that GPU- and non-GPU workloads weren’t mixed. Because of that, the only reason for a Fly Machine to be scheduled on a GPU machine was that it needed a PCI BDF for an Nvidia GPU, and there’s a limited number of those available on any box. Those GPU servers were drastically less utilized and thus less cost-effective than our ordinary servers.</p><p>We funded two very large security assessments, from <a href=\"https://www.atredis.com/\">Atredis</a> and <a href=\"https://tetrelsec.com/\">Tetrel</a>, to evaluate our GPU deployment. Matt Braun is writing up those assessments now. They were not cheap, and they took time.</p><p>Security wasn’t directly the biggest cost we had to deal with, but it was an indirect cause for a subtle reason.</p><p>We could have shipped GPUs very quickly by doing what Nvidia recommended: standing up a standard K8s cluster to schedule GPU jobs on. Had we taken that path, and let our GPU users share a single Linux kernel, we’d have been on Nvidia’s driver happy-path.</p><p>Alternatively, we could have used a conventional hypervisor. Nvidia suggested VMware (heh). But they could have gotten things working had we used QEMU. We like QEMU fine, and could have talked ourselves into a security story for it, but the whole point of Fly Machines is that they take milliseconds to start. We could not have offered our desired Developer Experience on the Nvidia happy-path.</p><p>Instead, we burned months trying (and ultimately failing) to get Nvidia’s host drivers working to map <a href=\"https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/virtual-solutions/\">virtualized GPUs</a> into Intel Cloud Hypervisor. At one point, we hex-edited the closed-source drivers to trick them into thinking our hypervisor was QEMU.</p><p>I’m not sure any of this really mattered in the end. There’s a segment of the market we weren’t ever really able to explore because Nvidia’s driver support kept us from thin-slicing GPUs. We’d have been able to put together a really cheap offering for developers if we hadn’t run up against that, and developers love “cheap”, but I can’t prove that those customers are real.</p><p>On the other hand, we’re committed to delivering the Fly Machine DX for GPU workloads. Beyond the PCI/IOMMU drama, just getting an entire hardware GPU working in a Fly Machine was a lift. We needed Fly Machines that would come up with the right Nvidia drivers; our stack was built assuming that the customer’s OCI container almost entirely defined the root filesystem for a Machine. We had to engineer around that in our  orchestrator. And almost everything people want to do with GPUs involves efficiently grabbing huge files full of model weights. Also annoying!</p><p>And, of course, we bought GPUs. A lot of GPUs. Expensive GPUs.</p><p>The biggest problem: developers don’t want GPUs. They don’t even want AI/ML models. They want LLMs.  may have smart, fussy opinions on how to get their models loaded with CUDA, and what the best GPU is. But  don’t care about any of that. When a software developer shipping an app comes looking for a way for their app to deliver prompts to an LLM, you can’t just give them a GPU.</p><p>For those developers, who probably make up most of the market, it doesn’t seem plausible for an insurgent public cloud to compete with OpenAI and Anthropic. Their APIs are fast enough, and developers thinking about performance in terms of “tokens per second” aren’t counting milliseconds.</p><div><p>(you should all feel sympathy for us)</p></div><p>This makes us sad because we really like the point in the solution space we found. Developers shipping apps on Amazon will outsource to other public clouds to get cost-effective access to GPUs. But then they’ll faceplant trying to handle data and model weights, backhauling gigabytes (at significant expense) from S3. We have app servers, GPUs, and object storage all under the same top-of-rack switch. But inference latency just doesn’t seem to matter yet, so the market doesn’t care.</p><p>Past that, and just considering the system engineers who do care about GPUs rather than LLMs: the hardware product/market fit here is really rough.</p><p>People doing serious AI work want galactically huge amounts of GPU compute. A whole enterprise A100 is a compromise position for them; they want an SXM cluster of H100s.</p><div><p>Near as we can tell, MIG gives you a UUID to talk to the host driver, not a PCI device.</p></div><p>We think there’s probably a market for users doing lightweight ML work getting tiny GPUs. <a href=\"https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/technologies/multi-instance-gpu/\">This is what Nvidia MIG does</a>, slicing a big GPU into arbitrarily small virtual GPUs. But for fully-virtualized workloads, it’s not baked; we can’t use it. And I’m not sure how many of those customers there are, or whether we’d get the density of customers per server that we need.</p><p><a href=\"https://fly.io/blog/cutting-prices-for-l40s-gpus-in-half\">That leaves the L40S customers</a>. There are a bunch of these! We dropped L40S prices last year, not because we were sour on GPUs but because they’re the one part we have in our inventory people seem to get a lot of use out of. We’re happy with them. But they’re just another kind of compute that some apps need; they’re not a driver of our core business. They’re not the GPU bet paying off.</p><p>Really, all of this is just a long way of saying that for most software developers, “AI-enabling” their app is best done with API calls to things like Claude and GPT, Replicate and RunPod.</p><p>A very useful way to look at a startup is that it’s a race to learn stuff. So, what’s our report card?</p><p>First off, when we embarked down this path in 2022, we were (like many other companies) operating in a sort of phlogiston era of AI/ML. The industry attention to AI had not yet collapsed around a small number of foundational LLM models. We expected there to be a diversity of  models, the world <a href=\"https://github.com/elixir-nx/bumblebee\" title=\"\">Elixir Bumblebee</a> looks forward to, where people pull different AI workloads off the shelf the same way they do Ruby gems.</p><p>But <a href=\"https://www.cursor.com/\" title=\"\">Cursor happened</a>, and, as they say, how are you going to keep ‘em down on the farm once they’ve seen Karl Hungus? It seems much clearer where things are heading.</p><p>GPUs were a test of a Fly.io company credo: as we think about core features, we design for 10,000 developers, not for 5-6. It took a minute, but the credo wins here: GPU workloads for the 10,001st developer are a niche thing.</p><p>Another way to look at a startup is as a series of bets. We put a lot of chips down here. But the buy-in for this tournament gave us a lot of chips to play with. Never making a big bet of any sort isn’t a winning strategy. I’d rather we’d flopped the nut straight, but I think going in on this hand was the right call.</p><p>A really important thing to keep in mind here, and something I think a lot of startup thinkers sleep on, is the extent to which this bet involved acquiring assets. Obviously, some of our <a href=\"https://fly.io/blog/the-exit-interview-jp/\" title=\"\">costs here aren’t recoverable</a>. But the hardware parts that aren’t generating revenue will ultimately get liquidated; like with <a href=\"https://fly.io/blog/32-bit-real-estate/\" title=\"\">our portfolio of IPv4 addresses</a>, I’m even more comfortable making bets backed by tradable assets with durable value.</p><p>In the end, I don’t think GPU Fly Machines were going to be a hit for us no matter what we did. Because of that, one thing I’m very happy about is that we didn’t compromise the rest of the product for them. Security concerns slowed us down to where we probably learned what we needed to learn a couple months later than we could have otherwise, but we’re scaling back our GPU ambitions without having sacrificed <a href=\"https://fly.io/blog/sandboxing-and-workload-isolation/\" title=\"\">any of our isolation story</a>, and, ironically, GPUs  are making that story a lot more important. The same thing goes for our Fly Machine developer experience.</p><p>We started this company building a Javascript runtime for edge computing. We learned that our customers didn’t want a new Javascript runtime; they just wanted their native code to work. <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=22616857\" title=\"\">We shipped containers</a>, and no convincing was needed. We were wrong about Javascript edge functions, and I think we were wrong about GPUs. That’s usually how we figure out the right answers:  by being wrong about a lot of stuff.</p>","contentLength":9514,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Show HN: SQL Noir – Learn SQL by solving crimes","url":"https://www.sqlnoir.com/","date":1739483356,"author":"chrisBHappy","guid":243,"unread":true,"content":"<!DOCTYPE html>","contentLength":0,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43041827"},{"title":"Bojan Mihelac: Prefixed Parameters for Django querystring tag","url":"http://code.informatikamihelac.com/en/query-string-with-prefixed-parameters/","date":1739482638,"author":"","guid":160,"unread":true,"content":"<article>An overview of Django 5.1's new querystring tag and how to add support for prefixed parameters.</article>","contentLength":95,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Learnings from a Machine Learning Engineer — Part 5: The Training","url":"https://towardsdatascience.com/learnings-from-a-machine-learning-engineer-part-5-the-training/","date":1739480672,"author":"David Martin","guid":6,"unread":true,"content":"<p>In this fifth part of my series, I will outline the steps for creating a Docker container for training your image classification model, evaluating performance, and preparing for deployment.</p><p>AI/ML engineers would prefer to focus on model training and data engineering, but the reality is that we also need to understand the infrastructure and mechanics behind the scenes.</p><p>I hope to share some tips, not only to get your training run running, but how to streamline the process in a cost efficient manner on cloud resources such as Kubernetes.</p><p>I will reference elements from my previous articles for getting the best model performance, so be sure to check out&nbsp;<a href=\"https://towardsdatascience.com/learnings-from-a-machine-learning-engineer-part-1-the-data/\">Part 1</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://towardsdatascience.com/learnings-from-a-machine-learning-engineer-part-2-the-data-sets/\">Part 2</a>&nbsp;on the data sets, as well as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://towardsdatascience.com/learnings-from-a-machine-learning-engineer-part-3-the-evaluation/\">Part 3</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://towardsdatascience.com/learnings-from-a-machine-learning-engineer-part-4-the-model/\">Part 4</a>&nbsp;on model evaluation.</p><p>Here are the learnings that I will share with you, once we lay the groundwork on the infrastructure:</p><ul><li>Building your Docker container</li><li>Executing your training run</li></ul><p>First, let me provide a brief description of the setup that I created, specifically around Kubernetes. Your setup may be entirely different, and that is just fine. I simply want to set the stage on the infrastructure so that the rest of the discussion makes sense.</p><p>This is a server you deploy that provides a user interface to for your subject matter experts to label and evaluate images for the image classification application. The server can run as a pod on your Kubernetes cluster, but you may find that running a dedicated server with faster disk may be better.</p><p>Image files are stored in a directory structure like the following, which is self-documenting and easily modified.</p><pre><code>Image_Library/\n  - cats/\n    - image1001.png\n  - dogs/\n    - image2001.png</code></pre><p>Ideally, these files would reside on local server storage (instead of cloud or cluster storage) for better performance. The reason for this will become clear as we see what happens as the image library grows.</p><p><a href=\"https://towardsdatascience.com/tag/cloud-storage/\" title=\"Cloud Storage\">Cloud Storage</a> allows for a virtually limitless and convenient way to share files between systems. In this case, the image library on your management system could access the same files as your Kubernetes cluster or Docker engine.</p><p>However, the downside of cloud storage is the latency to open a file. Your image library will have&nbsp;&nbsp;of images, and the latency to read each file will have a significant impact on your training run time. Longer training runs means more cost for using the expensive GPU processors!</p><p>The way that I found to speed things up is to create a&nbsp;&nbsp;file of your image library on your management system and copy them to cloud storage. Even better would be to create multiple tar files&nbsp;, each containing 10,000 to 20,000 images.</p><p>This way you only have network latency on a handful of files (which contain thousands, once extracted) and you start your training run much sooner.</p><h3>Kubernetes or Docker engine</h3><p>A Kubernetes cluster, with proper configuration, will allow you to dynamically scale up/down nodes, so you can perform your model training on GPU hardware as needed. Kubernetes is a rather heavy setup, and there are other container engines that will work.</p><blockquote><p>The technology options change constantly!</p></blockquote><p>The main idea is that you want to spin up the resources you need — for only as long as you need them — then scale down to reduce your time (and therefore cost) of running expensive GPU resources.</p><p>Once your GPU node is started and your <a href=\"https://towardsdatascience.com/tag/docker/\" title=\"Docker\">Docker</a> container is running, you can extract the&nbsp;&nbsp;files above to&nbsp;&nbsp;storage, such as an&nbsp;, on your node. The node typically has high-speed SSD disk, ideal for this type of workload. There is one caveat — the storage capacity on your node must be able to handle your image library.</p><p>Assuming we are good, let’s talk about building your Docker container so that you can train your model on your image library.</p><h2>Building your Docker container</h2><p>Being able to execute a training run in a consistent manner lends itself perfectly to building a Docker container. You can “pin” the version of libraries so you know exactly how your scripts will run every time. You can version control your containers as well, and revert to a known good image in a pinch. What is really nice about Docker is you can run the container pretty much anywhere.</p><p>The tradeoff when running in a container, especially with an <a href=\"https://towardsdatascience.com/tag/image-classification/\" title=\"Image Classification\">Image Classification</a> model, is the speed of file storage. You can attach any number of volumes to your container, but they are usually&nbsp;&nbsp;attached, so there is latency on each file read. This may not be a problem if you have a small number of files. But when dealing with hundreds of thousands of files like image data, that latency adds up!</p><p>This is why using the&nbsp;&nbsp;file method outlined above can be beneficial.</p><p>Also, keep in mind that Docker containers could be terminated unexpectedly, so you should make sure to store important information outside the container, on cloud storage or a database. I’ll show you how below.</p><p>Knowing that you will need to run on GPU hardware (here I will assume Nvidia), be sure to select the right base image for your Dockerfile, such as&nbsp;&nbsp;with the “devel&nbsp;flavor that will contain the right drivers.</p><p>Next, you will add the script files to your container, along with a “batch” script to coordinate the execution. Here is an example Dockerfile, and then I’ll describe what each of the scripts will be doing.</p><pre><code>#####   Dockerfile   #####\nFROM nvidia/cuda:12.8.0-devel-ubuntu24.04\n\n# Install system software\nRUN apt-get -y update &amp;&amp; apg-get -y upgrade\nRUN apt-get install -y python3-pip python3-dev\n\n# Setup python\nWORKDIR /app\nCOPY requirements.txt\nRUN python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip\nRUN python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt\n\n# Pythong and batch scripts\nCOPY ExtractImageLibrary.py .\nCOPY Training.py .\nCOPY Evaluation.py .\nCOPY ScorePerformance.py .\nCOPY ExportModel.py .\nCOPY BulkIdentification.py .\nCOPY BatchControl.sh .\n\n# Allow for interactive shell\nCMD tail -f /dev/null</code></pre><p>Dockerfiles are declarative, almost like a cookbook for building a small server — you know what you’ll get every time. Python libraries benefit, too, from this declarative approach. Here is a sample&nbsp;&nbsp;file that loads the TensorFlow libraries with CUDA support for GPU acceleration.</p><pre><code>#####   requirements.txt   #####\nnumpy==1.26.3\npandas==2.1.4\nscipy==1.11.4\nkeras==2.15.0\ntensorflow[and-cuda]</code></pre><h3>Extract Image Library script</h3><p>In <a href=\"https://towardsdatascience.com/tag/kubernetes/\" title=\"Kubernetes\">Kubernetes</a>, the Docker container can access local, high speed storage on the physical node. This can be achieved via the&nbsp;&nbsp;volume type. As mentioned before, this will only work if the local storage on your node can handle the size of your library.</p><pre><code>#####   sample 25GB emptyDir volume in Kubernetes   #####\ncontainers:\n  - name: training-container\n    volumeMounts:\n      - name: image-library\n        mountPath: /mnt/image-library\nvolumes:\n  - name: image-library\n    emptyDir:\n      sizeLimit: 25Gi</code></pre><p>You would want to have another&nbsp;&nbsp;to your cloud storage where you have the&nbsp;&nbsp;files. What this looks like will depend on your provider, or if you are using a persistent volume claim, so I won’t go into detail here.</p><p>Now you can extract the&nbsp;&nbsp;files — ideally in parallel for an added performance boost — to the local mount point.</p><p>As AI/ML engineers, the model training is where we want to spend most of our time.</p><blockquote><p>This is where the magic happens!</p></blockquote><p>With your image library now extracted, we can create our train-validation-test sets, load a pre-trained model or build a new one, fit the model, and save the results.</p><p>One key technique that has served me well is to load the most recently trained model as my base. I discuss this in more detail in&nbsp;<a href=\"https://towardsdatascience.com/learnings-from-a-machine-learning-engineer-part-4-the-model/\">Part 4</a>&nbsp;under “Fine tuning”, this results in faster training time and significantly improved model performance.</p><p>Be sure to take advantage of the local storage to checkpoint your model during training since the models are quite large and you are paying for the GPU even while it sits idle writing to disk.</p><p>This of course raises a concern about what happens if the Docker container dies part-way though the training. The risk is (hopefully) low from a cloud provider, and you may not want an incomplete training anyway. But if that does happen, you will at least want to understand&nbsp;, and this is where saving the main log file to cloud storage (described below) or to a package like MLflow comes in handy.</p><p>After your training run has completed and you have taken proper precaution on saving your work, it is time to see how well it performed.</p><p>Normally this evaluation script will pick up on the model that just finished. But you may decide to point it at a previous model version through an interactive session. This is why have the script as stand-alone.</p><p>With it being a separate script, that means it will need to read the completed model from disk — ideally local disk for speed. I like having two separate scripts (training and evaluation), but you might find it better to combine these to avoid reloading the model.</p><p>Now that the model is loaded, the evaluation script should generate predictions on&nbsp;&nbsp;image in the training, validation, test, and benchmark sets. I save the results as a&nbsp;&nbsp;matrix with the softmax confidence score for each class label. So, if there are 1,000 classes and 100,000 images, that’s a table with 100 million scores!</p><p>I save these results in&nbsp;&nbsp;files that are then used in the score generation next.</p><p>Taking the matrix of scores produced by the evaluation script above, we can now create various metrics of model performance. Again, this process could be combined with the evaluation script above, but my preference is for independent scripts. For example, I might want to regenerate scores on previous training runs. See what works for you.</p><p>Here are some of the&nbsp;&nbsp;functions that produce useful insights like F1, log loss, AUC-ROC, Matthews correlation coefficient.</p><pre><code>from sklearn.metrics import average_precision_score, classification_report\nfrom sklearn.metrics import log_loss, matthews_corrcoef, roc_auc_score</code></pre><p>Aside from these basic statistical analyses for each dataset (train, validation, test, and benchmark), it is also useful to identify:</p><ul><li>Which&nbsp;&nbsp;labels get the most number of errors?</li><li>Which&nbsp;&nbsp;labels get the most number of incorrect guesses?</li><li>How many&nbsp;<strong>ground-truth-to-predicted</strong>&nbsp;label pairs are there? In other words, which classes are easily confused?</li><li>What is the&nbsp;&nbsp;when applying a minimum softmax confidence score threshold?</li><li>What is the&nbsp;&nbsp;above that softmax threshold?</li><li>For the “difficult” benchmark sets, do you get a sufficiently&nbsp;&nbsp;score?</li><li>For the “out-of-scope” benchmark sets, do you get a sufficiently&nbsp;&nbsp;score?</li></ul><p>As you can see, there are multiple calculations and it’s not easy to come up with a single evaluation to decide if the trained model is good enough to be moved to production.</p><p>In fact, for an image classification model, it is helpful to manually review the images that the model got wrong, as well as the ones that got a low softmax confidence score. Use the scores from this script to create a list of images to manually review, and then get a&nbsp;&nbsp;for how well the model performs.</p><p>Check out&nbsp;<a href=\"https://towardsdatascience.com/learnings-from-a-machine-learning-engineer-part-3-the-evaluation/\">Part 3</a>&nbsp;for more in-depth discussion on evaluation and scoring.</p><p>All of the heavy lifting is done by this point. Since your Docker container will be shutdown soon, now is the time to copy the model artifacts to cloud storage and prepare them for being put to use.</p><p>The example Python code snippet below is more geared to Keras and TensorFlow. This will take the trained model and export it as a&nbsp;. Later, I will show how this is used by TensorFlow Serving in the&nbsp;&nbsp;section below.</p><pre><code># Increment current version of model and create new directory\nnext_version_dir, version_number = create_new_version_folder()\n\n# Copy model artifacts to the new directory\ncopy_model_artifacts(next_version_dir)\n\n# Create the directory to save the model export\nsaved_model_dir = os.path.join(next_version_dir, str(version_number))\n\n# Save the model export for use with TensorFlow Serving\ntf.keras.backend.set_learning_phase(0)\nmodel = tf.keras.models.load_model(keras_model_file)\ntf.saved_model.save(model, export_dir=saved_model_dir)</code></pre><p>This script also copies the other training run artifacts such as the model evaluation results, score summaries, and log files generated from model training. Don’t forget about your label map so you can give human readable names to your classes!</p><h3>Bulk identification script</h3><p>Your training run is complete, your model has been scored, and a new version is exported and ready to be served. Now is the time to use this latest model to assist you on trying to identify unlabeled images.</p><p>As I described in&nbsp;<a href=\"https://towardsdatascience.com/learnings-from-a-machine-learning-engineer-part-4-the-model/\">Part 4</a>, you may have a collection of “unknowns” — really good pictures, but no idea what they are. Let your new model provide a best guess on these and record the results to a file or a database. Now you can create filters based on closest match and by high/low scores. This allows your subject matter experts to leverage these filters to find new image classes, add to existing classes, or to remove images that have very low scores and are no good.</p><p>By the way, I put this step inside the GPU container since you may have thousands of “unknown” images to process and the accelerated hardware will make light work of it. However, if you are not in a hurry, you could perform this step on a separate CPU node, and shutdown your GPU node sooner to save cost. This would especially make sense if your “unknowns” folder is on slower cloud storage.</p><p>All of the scripts described above perform a specific task — from extracting your image library, executing model training, performing evaluation and scoring, exporting the model artifacts for deployment, and perhaps even bulk identification.</p><blockquote><p>One script to rule them all</p></blockquote><p>To coordinate the entire show, this batch script gives you the entry point for your container and an easy way to trigger everything. Be sure to produce a log file in case you need to analyze any failures along the way. Also, be sure to write the log to your cloud storage in case the container dies unexpectedly.</p><pre><code>#!/bin/bash\n# Main batch control script\n\n# Redirect standard output and standard error to a log file\nexec &gt; /cloud_storage/batch-logfile.txt 2&gt;&amp;1\n\n/app/ExtractImageLibrary.py\n/app/Training.py\n/app/Evaluation.py\n/app/ScorePerformance.py\n/app/ExportModel.py\n/app/BulkIdentification.py</code></pre><h2>Executing your training run</h2><p>So, now it’s time to put everything in motion…</p><p>Let’s go through the steps to prepare your image library, fire up your Docker container to train your model, and then examine the results.</p><h3>Image library ‘tar’ files</h3><p>Your image management system should now create a&nbsp;&nbsp;file backup of your data. Since&nbsp;&nbsp;is a single-threaded function, you will get significant speed improvement by creating multiple tar files in parallel, each with a portion of you data.</p><p>Now these files can be copied to your shared cloud storage for the next step.</p><p>All the hard work you put into creating your container (described above) will be put to the test. If you are running Kubernetes, you can create a Job that will execute the&nbsp;&nbsp;script.</p><p>Inside the Kubernetes Job definition, you can pass environment variables to adjust the execution of your script. For example, the batch size and number of epochs are set here and then pulled into your Python scripts, so you can alter the behavior without changing your code.</p><pre><code>#####   sample Job in Kubernetes   #####\ncontainers:\n  - name: training-job\n    env:\n      - name: BATCH_SIZE\n        value: 50\n      - name: NUM_EPOCHS\n        value: 30\n    command: [\"/app/BatchControl.sh\"]</code></pre><p>Once the Job is completed, be sure to verify that the GPU node properly scales back down to zero according to your scaling configuration in Kubernetes — you don’t want to be saddled with a huge bill over a simple configuration error.</p><p>With the training run complete, you should now have model artifacts saved and can examine the performance. Look through the metrics, such as F1 and log loss, and benchmark accuracy for high softmax confidence scores.</p><p>As mentioned earlier, the reports only tell part of the story. It is worth the time and effort to manually review the images that the model got wrong or where it produced a low confidence score.</p><p>Don’t forget about the bulk identification. Be sure to leverage these to locate new images to fill out your data set, or to find new classes.</p><p>Once you have reviewed your model performance and are satisfied with the results, it is time to modify your TensorFlow Serving container to put the new model into production.</p><p>TensorFlow Serving is available as a Docker container and provides a very quick and convenient way to serve your model. This container can listen and respond to API calls for your model.</p><p>Let’s say your new model is version 7, and your&nbsp;&nbsp;script (see above) has saved the model in your cloud share as&nbsp;<em>/image_application/models/007</em>. You can start the TensorFlow Serving container with that volume mount. In this example, the&nbsp;&nbsp;points to folder for version 007.</p><pre><code>#####   sample TensorFlow pod in Kubernetes   #####\ncontainers:\n  - name: tensorflow-serving\n    image: bitnami/tensorflow-serving:2.18.0\n    ports:\n      - containerPort: 8501\n    env:\n      - name: TENSORFLOW_SERVING_MODEL_NAME\n        value: \"image_application\"\n    volumeMounts:\n      - name: models-subfolder\n        mountPath: \"/bitnami/model-data\"\n\nvolumes:\n  - name: models-subfolder\n    azureFile:\n      shareName: \"image_application/models/007\"</code></pre><p>A subtle note here — the export script should create a sub-folder, named 007 (same as the base folder), with the saved model export. This may seem a little confusing, but TensorFlow Serving will mount this share folder as&nbsp;&nbsp;and detect the numbered sub-folder inside it for the version to serve. This will allow you to query the API for the model version as well as the identification.</p><p>As I mentioned at the start of this article, this setup has worked for my situation. This is certainly not the only way to approach this challenge, and I invite you to customize your own solution.</p><p>I wanted to share my hard-fought learnings as I embraced cloud services in Kubernetes, with the desire to keep costs under control. Of course, doing all this while maintaining a high level of model performance is an added challenge, but one that you can achieve.</p><p>I hope I have provided enough information here to help you with your own endeavors.

We will see the difference between evaluation of a&nbsp;&nbsp;model (one not yet in production), and evaluation of a&nbsp;&nbsp;model (one making real-world predictions).</p><p>In&nbsp;<a href=\"https://towardsdatascience.com/learnings-from-a-machine-learning-engineer-part-1-the-data/\">Part 1</a>, I discussed the process of labelling your image data that you use in your <a href=\"https://towardsdatascience.com/tag/image-classification/\" title=\"Image Classification\">Image Classification</a> project. I showed how to define “good” images and create sub-classes. In&nbsp;<a href=\"https://towardsdatascience.com/learnings-from-a-machine-learning-engineer-part-2-the-data-sets/\">Part 2</a>, I went over various data sets, beyond the usual train-validation-test sets, such as benchmark sets, plus how to handle synthetic data and duplicate images.</p><h2><strong>Evaluation of the trained model</strong></h2><p>As machine learning engineers we look at accuracy, F1, log loss, and other metrics to decide if a model is ready to move to production. These are all important measures, but from my experience, these scores can be deceiving especially as the number of classes grows.</p><p>Although it can be time consuming, I find it very important to manually review the images that the model gets&nbsp;, as well as the images that the model gives a&nbsp;&nbsp;softmax “confidence” score to. This means adding a step immediately after your training run completes to calculate scores for&nbsp;&nbsp;images — training, validation, test, and the benchmark sets. You only need to bring up for manual review the ones that the model had problems with. This should only be a small percentage of the total number of images. See the Double-check process below</p><p>What you do during the manual evaluation is to put yourself in a “” to ensure that the labelling standards are being followed that you setup in <a href=\"https://towardsdatascience.com/learnings-from-a-machine-learning-engineer-part-1-the-data/\">Part 1</a>. Ask yourself:</p><ul><li>“Is this a good image?” Is the subject front and center, and can you clearly see all the features?</li><li>“Is this the correct label?” Don’t be surprised if you find wrong labels.</li></ul><p>You can either remove the bad images or fix the labels if they are wrong. Otherwise you can keep them in the data set and force the model to do better next time. Other questions I ask are:</p><ul><li>“Why did the model get this wrong?”</li><li>“Why did this image get a low score?”</li><li>“What is it about the image that caused confusion?”</li></ul><p>Sometimes the answer has nothing to do with&nbsp;&nbsp;specific image. Frequently, it has to do with the&nbsp;&nbsp;images, either in the ground truth class or in the predicted class. It is worth the effort to Double-check all images in both sets if you see a consistently bad guess. Again, don’t be surprised if you find poor images or wrong labels.</p><p>When doing the evaluation of the trained model (above), we apply a lot of subjective analysis — “Why did the model get this wrong?” and “Is this a good image?” From these, you may only get a&nbsp;.</p><p>Frequently, I will decide to hold off moving a model forward to production based on that gut feel. But how can you justify to your manager that you want to hit the brakes? This is where putting a more&nbsp;&nbsp;analysis comes in by creating a weighted average of the softmax “confidence” scores.</p><p>In order to apply a weighted evaluation, we need to identify sets of classes that deserve adjustments to the score. Here is where I create a list of “commonly confused” classes.</p><h2><strong>Commonly confused classes</strong></h2><p>Certain animals at our zoo can easily be mistaken. For example, African elephants and Asian elephants have different ear shapes. If your model gets these two mixed up, that is not as bad as guessing a giraffe! So perhaps you give partial credit here. You and your subject matter experts (SMEs) can come up with a list of these pairs and a weighted adjustment for each.</p><p>This weight can be factored into a modified cross-entropy loss function in the equation below. The back half of this equation will reduce the impact of being wrong for specific pairs of ground truth and prediction by using the “weight” function as a lookup. By default, the weighted adjustment would be 1 for all pairings, and the commonly confused classes would get something like 0.5.</p><p>In other words, it’s better to be unsure (have a&nbsp;&nbsp;confidence score) when you are wrong, compared to being super confident and wrong.</p><p>Once this weighted log loss is calculated, I can compare to previous training runs to see if the new model is ready for production.</p><h2><strong>Confidence threshold report</strong></h2><p>Another valuable measure that incorporates the confidence threshold (in my example, 95) is to report on accuracy and false positive rates. Recall that when we apply the confidence threshold before presenting results, we help reduce false positives from being shown to the end user.</p><p>In this table, we look at the breakdown of “true positive above 95” for each data set. We get a sense that when a “good” picture comes through (like the ones from our train-validation-test set) it is very likely to surpass the threshold, thus the user is “happy” with the outcome. Conversely, the “false positive above 95” is extremely low for good pictures, thus only a small number of our users will be “sad” about the results.</p><p>We expect the train-validation-test set results to be exceptional since our data is curated. So, as long as people take “good” pictures, the model should do very well. But to get a sense of how it does on extreme situations, let’s take a look at our benchmarks.</p><p>The “difficult” benchmark has more modest true positive and false positive rates, which reflects the fact that the images are more challenging. These values are much easier to compare across training runs, so that lets me set a min/max target. So for example, if I target a minimum of 80% for true positive, and maximum of 5% for false positive on this benchmark, then I can feel confident moving this to production.</p><p>The “out-of-scope” benchmark has no true positive rate because&nbsp;&nbsp;of the images belong to any class the model can identify. Remember, we picked things like a bag of popcorn, etc., that are not zoo animals, so there cannot be any true positives. But we do get a false positive rate, which means the model gave a confident score to that bag of popcorn as some animal. And if we set a target maximum of 10% for this benchmark, then we may not want to move it to production.</p><p>Right now, you may be thinking, “Well, what animal did it pick for the bag of popcorn?” Excellent question! Now you understand the importance of doing a manual review of the images that get bad results.</p><h2><strong>Evaluation of the deployed model</strong></h2><p>The evaluation that I described above applies to a model immediately after&nbsp;. Now, you want to evaluate how your model is doing in the&nbsp;. The process is similar, but requires you to shift to a “” and asking yourself, “Did the model get this correct?” and “Should it have gotten this correct?” and “Did we tell the user the right thing?”</p><p>So, imagine that you are logging in for the morning — after sipping on your&nbsp;<a href=\"https://medium.com/@dmartin0409/cold-brew-coffee-0aabd53a1f3e\">cold brew coffee</a>, of course — and are presented with 500 images that your zoo guests took yesterday of different animals. Your job is to determine how satisfied the guests were using your model to identify the zoo animals.</p><p>Using the softmax “confidence” score for each image, we have a threshold before presenting results. Above the threshold, we tell the guest what the model predicted. I’ll call this the “happy path”. And below the threshold is the “sad path” where we ask them to try again.</p><p>Your review interface will first show you all the “happy path” images one at a time. This is where you ask yourself, “Did we get this right?” Hopefully, yes!</p><p>But if not, this is where things get tricky. So now you have to ask, “Why not?” Here are some things that it could be:</p><ul><li>“Bad” picture — Poor lighting, bad angle, zoomed out, etc — refer to your labelling standards.</li><li>Out-of-scope — It’s a zoo animal, but unfortunately one that isn’t found in&nbsp;&nbsp;zoo. Maybe it belongs to another zoo (your guest likes to travel and try out your app). Consider adding these to your data set.</li><li>Out-of-scope — It’s not a zoo animal. It could be an animal in your zoo, but not one typically&nbsp;&nbsp;there, like a neighborhood sparrow or mallard duck. This might be a candidate to add.</li><li>Out-of-scope — It’s something found in the zoo. A zoo usually has interesting trees and shrubs, so people might try to identify those. Another candidate to add.</li><li>Prankster — Completely out-of-scope. Because people like to play with technology, there’s the possibility you have a prankster that took a picture of a bag of popcorn, or a soft drink cup, or even a selfie. These are hard to prevent, but hopefully get a low enough score (below the threshold) so the model did not identify it as a zoo animal. If you see enough pattern in these, consider creating a class with special handling on the front-end.</li></ul><p>After reviewing the “happy path” images, you move on to the “sad path” images — the ones that got a low confidence score and the app gave a “sorry, try again” message. This time you ask yourself, “&nbsp;the model have given this image a higher score?” which would have put it in the “happy path”. If so, then you want to ensure these images are added to the training set so next time it will do better. But most of time, the low score reflects many of the “bad” or out-of-scope situations mentioned above.</p><p>Perhaps your model performance is suffering and it has nothing to do with your model. Maybe it is the ways you users interacting with the app. Keep an eye out of non-technical problems and share your observations with the rest of your team. For example:</p><ul><li>Are your users using the application in the ways you expected?</li><li>Are they not following the instructions?</li><li>Do the instructions need to be stated more clearly?</li><li>Is there anything you can do to improve the experience?</li></ul><h2><strong>Collect statistics and new images</strong></h2><p>Both of the manual evaluations above open a gold mine of data. So, be sure to collect these statistics and feed them into a dashboard — your manager and your future self will thank you!</p><p>Keep track of these stats and generate reports that you and your can reference:</p><ul><li>How often the model is being called?</li><li>What times of the day, what days of the week is it used?</li><li>Are your system resources able to handle the peak load?</li><li>What classes are the most common?</li><li>After evaluation, what is the accuracy for each class?</li><li>What is the breakdown for confidence scores?</li><li>How many scores are above and below the confidence threshold?</li></ul><p>The single best thing you get from a deployed model is the additional real-world images! You can add these now images to improve coverage of your existing zoo animals. But more importantly, they provide you insight on&nbsp;&nbsp;classes to add. For example, let’s say people enjoy taking a picture of the large walrus statue at the gate. Some of these may make sense to incorporate into your data set to provide a better user experience.</p><p>Creating a new class, like the walrus statue, is not a huge effort, and it avoids the false positive responses. It would be more embarrassing to identify a walrus statue as an elephant! As for the prankster and the bag of popcorn, you can configure your front-end to quietly handle these. You might even get creative and have fun with it like, “Thank you for visiting the food court.”</p><p>It is a good idea to double-check your image set when you suspect there may be problems with your data. I’m not suggesting a top-to-bottom check, because that would a monumental effort! Rather specific classes that you suspect could contain bad data that is degrading your model performance.</p><p>Immediately after my training run completes, I have a script that will use this new model to generate predictions for my&nbsp;&nbsp;data set. When this is complete, it will take the list of incorrect identifications, as well as the low scoring predictions, and automatically feed that list into the Double-check interface.</p><p>This interface will show, one at a time, the image in question, alongside an example image of the ground truth and an example image of what the model predicted. I can visually compare the three, side-by-side. The first thing I do is ensure the original image is a “good” picture, following my labelling standards. Then I check if the ground-truth label is indeed correct, or if there is something that made the model think it was the predicted label.</p><ul><li>Remove the original image if the image quality is poor.</li><li>Relabel the image if it belongs in a different class.</li></ul><p>During this manual evaluation, you might notice dozens of the same wrong prediction. Ask yourself why the model made this mistake when the images seem perfectly fine. The answer may be some incorrect labels on images in the ground truth, or even in the predicted class!</p><p>Don’t hesitate to add those classes and sub-classes back into the Double-check interface and step through them all. You may have 100–200 pictures to review, but there is a good chance that one or two of the images will stand out as being the culprit.</p><p>With a different mindset for a trained model versus a deployed model, we can now evaluate performances to decide which models are ready for production, and how well a production model is going to serve the public. This relies on a solid Double-check process and a critical eye on your data. And beyond the “gut feel” of your model, we can rely on the benchmark scores to support us.</p><p>In&nbsp;<a href=\"https://towardsdatascience.com/learnings-from-a-machine-learning-engineer-part-4-the-model/\">Part 4</a>, we kick off the training run, but there are some subtle techniques to get the most out of the process and even ways to leverage throw-away models to expand your library image data.<a href=\"https://medium.com/tag/machine-learning?source=post_page-----e4a8dbb035e0---------------------------------------\"></a></p>","contentLength":13463,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Build a dynamic, role-based AI agent using Amazon Bedrock inline agents","url":"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/build-a-dynamic-role-based-ai-agent-using-amazon-bedrock-inline-agents/","date":1739480188,"author":"Ishan Singh","guid":113,"unread":true,"content":"<p>AI agents continue to gain momentum, as businesses use the power of generative AI to reinvent customer experiences and automate complex workflows. We are seeing <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/agents/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Amazon Bedrock Agents</a> applied in investment research, insurance claims processing, root cause analysis, advertising campaigns, and much more. Agents use the reasoning capability of foundation models (FMs) to break down user-requested tasks into multiple steps. They use developer-provided instructions to create an orchestration plan and carry out that plan by securely invoking company APIs and accessing knowledge bases using Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) to accurately handle the user’s request.</p><p>Although organizations see the benefit of agents that are defined, configured, and tested as managed resources, we have increasingly seen the need for an additional, more dynamic way to invoke agents. Organizations need solutions that adjust on the fly—whether to test new approaches, respond to changing business rules, or customize solutions for different clients. This is where the new <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/agents-create-inline.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">inline agents</a> capability in Amazon Bedrock Agents becomes transformative. It allows you to dynamically adjust your agent’s behavior at runtime by changing its instructions, tools, guardrails, knowledge bases, prompts, and even the FMs it uses—all without redeploying your application.</p><p>In this post, we explore how to build an application using Amazon Bedrock inline agents, demonstrating how a single AI assistant can adapt its capabilities dynamically based on user roles.</p><h2>Inline agents in Amazon Bedrock Agents</h2><p>This runtime flexibility enabled by inline agents opens powerful new possibilities, such as:</p><ul><li> – Inline agents minimize the time-consuming create/update/prepare cycles traditionally required for agent configuration changes. Developers can instantly test different combinations of models, tools, and knowledge bases, dramatically accelerating the development process.</li><li><strong>A/B testing and experimentation</strong> – Data science teams can systematically evaluate different model-tool combinations, measure performance metrics, and analyze response patterns in controlled environments. This empirical approach enables quantitative comparison of configurations before production deployment.</li><li><strong>Subscription-based personalization</strong> – Software companies can adapt features based on each customer’s subscription level, providing more advanced tools for premium users.</li><li><strong>Persona-based data source integration</strong> – Institutions can adjust content complexity and tone based on the user’s profile, providing persona-appropriate explanations and resources by changing the knowledge bases associated to the agent on the fly.</li><li> – Developers can create applications with hundreds of APIs, and quickly and accurately carry out tasks by dynamically choosing a small subset of APIs for the agent to consider for a given request. This is particularly helpful for large software as a service (SaaS) platforms needing multi-tenant scaling.</li></ul><p>Inline agents expand your options for building and deploying agentic solutions with Amazon Bedrock Agents. For workloads needing managed and versioned agent resources with a pre-determined and tested configuration (specific model, instructions, tools, and so on), developers can continue to use InvokeAgent on resources created with CreateAgent. For workloads that need dynamic runtime behavior changes for each agent invocation, you can use the new <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/APIReference/API_agent-runtime_InvokeInlineAgent.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">InvokeInlineAgent API</a>. With either approach, your agents will be secure and scalable, with configurable guardrails, a flexible set of model inference options, native access to knowledge bases, code interpretation, session memory, and more.</p><p>Our HR assistant example shows how to build a single AI assistant that adapts to different user roles using the new inline agent capabilities in Amazon Bedrock Agents. When users interact with the assistant, the assistant dynamically configures agent capabilities (such as model, instructions, knowledge bases, action groups, and guardrails) based on the user’s role and their specific selections. This approach creates a flexible system that adjusts its functionality in real time, making it more efficient than creating separate agents for each user role or tool combination. The complete code for this HR assistant example is available on our <a href=\"https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-bedrock-agent-samples/tree/main/examples/agents_ux/inline-agent-hr-assistant\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">GitHub repo</a>.</p><p>This dynamic tool selection enables a personalized experience. When an employee logs in without direct reports, they see a set of tools that they have access to based on their role. They can select from options like requesting vacation time, checking company policies using the knowledge base, using a code interpreter for data analysis, or submitting expense reports. The inline agent assistant is then configured with only these selected tools, allowing it to assist the employee with their chosen tasks. In a real-world example, the user would not need to make the selection, because the application would make that decision and automatically configure the agent invocation at runtime. We make it explicit in this application so that you can demonstrate the impact.</p><p>Similarly, when a manager logs in to the same system, they see an extended set of tools reflecting their additional permissions. In addition to the employee-level tools, managers have access to capabilities like running performance reviews. They can select which tools they want to use for their current session, instantly configuring the inline agent with their choices.</p><p>The inclusion of knowledge bases is also adjusted based on the user’s role. Employees and managers see different levels of company policy information, with managers getting additional access to confidential data like performance review and compensation details. For this demo, we’ve implemented <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/amazon-bedrock-knowledge-bases-now-supports-metadata-filtering-to-improve-retrieval-accuracy/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">metadata filtering</a> to retrieve only the appropriate level of documents based on the user’s access level, further enhancing efficiency and security.</p><p>Let’s look at how the interface adapts to different user roles.</p><p>The employee view provides access to essential HR functions like vacation requests, expense submissions, and company policy lookups. Users can select which of these tools they want to use for their current session.</p><p>The manager view extends these options to include supervisory functions like compensation management, demonstrating how the inline agent can be configured with a broader set of tools based on user permissions.</p><p>The manager view extends these capabilities to include supervisory functions like compensation management, demonstrating how the inline agent dynamically adjusts its available tools based on user permissions. Without inline agents, we would need to build and maintain two separate agents.</p><p>As shown in the preceding screenshots, the same HR assistant offers different tool selections based on the user’s role. An employee sees options like Knowledge Base, Apply Vacation Tool, and Submit Expense, whereas a manager has additional options like Performance Evaluation. Users can select which tools they want to add to the agent for their current interaction.</p><p>This flexibility allows for quick adaptation to user needs and preferences. For instance, if the company introduces a new policy for creating business travel requests, the tool catalog can be quickly updated to include a Create Business Travel Reservation tool. Employees can then choose to add this new tool to their agent configuration when they need to plan a business trip, or the application could automatically do so based on their role.</p><p>With Amazon Bedrock inline agents, you can create a catalog of actions that is dynamically selected by the application or by users of the application. This increases the level of flexibility and adaptability of your solutions, making them a perfect fit for navigating the complex, ever-changing landscape of modern business operations. Users have more control over their AI assistant’s capabilities, and the system remains efficient by only loading the necessary tools for each interaction.</p><h2>Technical foundation: Dynamic configuration and action selection</h2><p>Inline agents allow dynamic configuration at runtime, enabling a single agent to effectively perform the work of many. By specifying action groups and modifying instructions on the fly, even within the same session, you can create versatile AI applications that adapt to various scenarios without multiple agent deployments.</p><p>The following are key points about inline agents:</p><ul><li> – Change the agent’s configuration, including its FM, at runtime. This enables rapid experimentation and adaptation without redeploying the application, reducing development cycles.</li><li> – Apply governance and access control at the tool level. With agents changing dynamically at runtime, tool-level governance helps maintain security and compliance regardless of the agent’s configuration.</li><li> – Provide only necessary tools and instructions at runtime to reduce token usage and improve the agent accuracy. With fewer tools to choose from, it’s less complicated for the agent to select the right one, reducing hallucinations in the tool selection process. This approach can also lead to lower costs and improved latency compared to static agents because removing unnecessary tools, knowledge bases, and instructions reduces the number of input and output tokens being processed by the agent’s large language model (LLM).</li><li> – Create reusable actions for dynamic selection based on specific needs. This modular approach simplifies maintenance, updates, and scalability of your AI applications.</li></ul><p>The following are examples of reusable actions:</p><ul><li><strong>Enterprise system integration</strong> – Connect with systems like Salesforce, GitHub, or databases</li><li> – Perform common tasks such as sending emails or managing calendars</li><li> – Interact with specialized internal tools and services</li><li> – Analyze text, structured data, or other information</li><li> – Fetch weather updates, stock prices, or perform web searches</li><li> – Use specific machine learning (ML) models for targeted tasks</li></ul><p>When using inline agents, you configure parameters for the following:</p><ul><li>Contextual tool selection based on user intent or conversation flow</li><li>Adaptation to different user roles and permissions</li><li>Switching between communication styles or personas</li><li>Model selection based on task complexity</li></ul><p>The inline agent uses the configuration you provide at runtime, allowing for highly flexible AI assistants that efficiently handle various tasks across different business contexts.</p><h2>Building an HR assistant using inline agents</h2><p>Let’s look at how we built our HR Assistant using Amazon Bedrock inline agents:</p><ol><li> – We developed a demo catalog of HR-related tools, including: \n  <ul type=\"a\"><li> – Using <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/knowledge-bases/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases</a> for accessing company policies and guidelines based on the role of the application user. In order to filter the knowledge base content based on the user’s role, you also need to provide a metadata file specifying the type of employee’s roles that can access each file</li><li>– For requesting and tracking time off.</li><li>– For submitting and managing expense reports.</li><li> – For performing calculations and data analysis.</li><li>– for conducting and reviewing employee compensation assessments (manager only access).</li></ul></li><li> – We defined multiple conversation tones to suit different interaction styles: \n  <ul><li> – For formal, business-like interactions.</li><li> – For friendly, everyday support.</li><li> – For upbeat, encouraging assistance.</li></ul></li><li> – We implemented role-based access control. The application backend checks the user’s role (employee or manager) and provides access to appropriate tools and information and passes this information to the inline agent. The role information is also used to configure metadata filtering in the knowledge bases to generate relevant responses. The system allows for dynamic tool use at runtime.

While this is true (and pretty much obvious), it is extremely difficult to define, build, and sustain good data. Let me share with you the unique processes that I have learned over several years building an ever-growing image classification system and how you can apply these techniques to your own application.</p><p>With persistence and diligence, you can avoid the classic “garbage in, garbage out”, maximize your model accuracy, and demonstrate real business value.</p><p>In this series of articles, I will dive into the care and feeding of a multi-class, single-label image classification app and what it takes to reach the highest level of performance. I won’t get into any coding or specific user interfaces, just the main concepts that you can incorporate to suit your needs with the tools at your disposal.</p><p>Here is a brief description of the articles. You will notice that the model is last on the list since we need to focus on curating the data first and foremost:</p><p>Over the past six years, I have been primarily focused on building and maintaining an image classification application for a manufacturing company. Back when I started, most of the software did not exist or was too expensive, so I created these from scratch. In this time, I have deployed two identifier applications, the largest handles 1,500 classes and achieves 97–98% accuracy.</p><p>It was about eight years ago that I started online studies for <a href=\"https://towardsdatascience.com/tag/data-science/\" title=\"Data Science\">Data Science</a> and machine learning. So, when the exciting opportunity to create an AI application presented itself, I was prepared to build the tools I needed to leverage the latest advancements. I jumped in with both feet!</p><p>I quickly found that building and deploying a model is probably the easiest part of the job. Feeding high quality data into the model is the best way to improve performance, and that requires focus and patience. Attention to detail is what I do best, so this was a perfect fit.</p><h2><strong>It all starts with the data</strong></h2><p>I feel that so much attention is given to the model selection (deciding which neural network is best) and that the data is just an afterthought. I have found the hard way that even one or two pieces of bad data can significantly impact model performance, so that is where we need to focus.</p><p>For example, let’s say you train the classic cat versus dog image classifier. You have 50 pictures of cats and 50 pictures of dogs, however one of the “cats” is clearly (objectively) a picture of a dog. The computer doesn’t have the luxury of ignoring the mislabelled image, and instead adjusts the model weights to make it fit. Square peg meets round hole.</p><p>Another example would be a picture of a cat that climbed up into a tree. But when you take a wholistic view of it, you would describe it as a picture of a tree (first) with a cat (second). Again, the computer doesn’t know to ignore the big tree and focus on the cat — it will start to identify trees as cats, even if there is a dog. You can think of these pictures as outliers and should be removed.</p><p>It doesn’t matter if you have the best neural network in the world, you can count on the model making poor predictions when it is trained on “bad” data. I’ve learned that any time I see the model make mistakes, it’s time to review the data.</p><h2><strong>Example Application — Zoo animals</strong></h2><p>For the rest of this write-up, I will use an example of identifying zoo animals. Let’s assume your goal is to create a mobile app where guests at the zoo can take pictures of the animals they see and have the app identify them. Specifically, this is a multi-class, single-label application.</p><ul><li>&nbsp;— There are a lot of different animals at the zoo and many of them look very similar.</li><li>&nbsp;— Guests using the app don’t always take good pictures (zoomed out, blurry, too dark), so we don’t want to provide an answer if the image is poor.</li><li>&nbsp;— The zoo keeps expanding and adding new species all the time.</li><li>&nbsp;— Occasionally you might find that people take pictures of the sparrows near the food court grabbing some dropped popcorn.</li><li>&nbsp;— Just for fun, guests may take a picture of the bag of popcorn just to see what it comes back with.</li></ul><p>These are all real challenges — being able to tell the subtle differences between animals, handling out-of-scope cases, and just plain poor images.</p><p>Before we get there, let’s start from the beginning.</p><p>There are a lot of tools these days to help you with this part of the process, but the challenge remains the same — collecting, labelling, and curating the data.</p><p>Having data to collect is challenge #1. Without images, you have nothing to train. You may need to get creative on sourcing the data, or even creating synthetic data. More on that later.</p><p>A quick note about image pre-processing. I convert all my images to the input size of my neural network and save them as PNG. Inside this square PNG, I preserve the aspect ratio of the original picture and fill the background black. I don’t stretch the image nor crop any features out. This also helps center the subject.</p><p>Challenge #2 is to establish standards for data quality…and ensure that these standards are followed! These standards will guide you toward that “good” data. And this assumes, of course, correct labels. Having both is much easier said than done!</p><p>I hope to show how “good” and “correct” actually go hand-in-hand, and how important it is to apply these standards to every image.</p><p>First, I want to point out that the image data discussed here is for the training set. What qualifies as a good image for&nbsp;&nbsp;is a bit different than what qualifies as a good image for&nbsp;. More on that in <a href=\"https://towardsdatascience.com/learnings-from-a-machine-learning-engineer-part-3-the-evaluation/\">Part 3</a>.</p><p>So, what is “good” data when talking about images? “A picture is worth a thousand words”, and if the&nbsp;&nbsp;you use to describe the picture do not include the subject you are trying to label, then it is not good and you need remove it from your training set.</p><p>For example, let’s say you are shown a picture of a zebra and (removing bias toward your application) you describe it as an “open field with a zebra in the distance”. In other words, if “open field” is the first thing you notice, then you likely do&nbsp;&nbsp;want to use that image. The opposite is also true — if the picture is way too close, you would described it as “zebra pattern”.</p><p>What you want is a description like, “a zebra, front and center”. This would have your subject taking up about 80–90% of the total frame. Sometimes I will take the time to crop the original image so the subject is framed properly.</p><p>Keep in mind the use of image augmentation at the time of training. Having that buffer around the edges will allow “zoom in” augmentation. And “zoom out” augmentation will simulate smaller subjects, so don’t start out less than 50% of the total frame for your subject since you lose detail.</p><p>Another aspect of a “good” image relates to the label. If you can only see the back side of your zoo animal, can you really tell, for example, that it is a cheetah versus a leopard? The key identifying features need to be visible. If a human struggles to identify it, you can’t expect the computer to learn anything.</p><p>What does a “bad” image look like? Here is what I frequently watch out for:</p><ul><li>Wide angle lens stretching</li><li>High contrast or dark shadows</li><li>“Doctored” images, drawn lines and arrows</li><li>“Unusual” angles or situations</li><li>Picture of a mobile device that has a picture of your subject</li></ul><p>If you have a team of subject matter experts (SMEs) on hand to label the images, you are in a good starting position. Animal trainers at the zoo know the various species, and can spot the differences between, for example, a chimpanzee and a bonobo.</p><p>To a <a href=\"https://towardsdatascience.com/tag/machine-learning-engineer/\" title=\"Machine Learning Engineer\">Machine Learning Engineer</a>, it is easy for you to assume all labels from your SMEs are correct and move right on to training the model. However, even experts make mistakes, so if you can get a second opinion on the labels, your error rate should go down.</p><p>In reality, it can be prohibitively expensive to get one, let alone two, subject matter experts to review image labels. The SME usually has years of experience that make them more valuable to the business in other areas of work. My experience is that the machine learning engineer (that’s you and me) becomes the second opinion, and often the first opinion as well.</p><p>Over time, you can become pretty adept at labelling, but certainly not an SME. If you do have the luxury of access to an expert, explain to them the labelling standards and how these are required for the application to be successful. Emphasize “quality over quantity”.</p><p>It goes without saying that having a&nbsp;&nbsp;label is so important. However, all it takes is one or two mislabelled images to degrade performance. These can easily slip into your data set with careless or hasty labelling. So, take the time to get it right.</p><p>Ultimately, we as the ML engineer are responsible for model performance. So, if we take the approach of only working on model training and deployment, we will find ourselves wondering why performance is falling short.</p><p>A lot of times, you will come across a really good picture of a very interesting subject, but have no idea what it is! It would be a shame to simply dispose of it. What you can do is assign it a generic label, like “Unknown Bird” or “Random Plant” that are&nbsp;&nbsp;included in your training set. Later in <a href=\"https://towardsdatascience.com/learnings-from-a-machine-learning-engineer-part-4-the-model/\">Part 4</a>, you’ll see how to come back to these images at a later date when you have a better idea what they are, and you’ll be glad you saved them.</p><p>If you have done any image labelling, then you know how time consuming and difficult it can be. But this is where having a model, even a less-than-perfect model, can help you.</p><p>Typically, you have a large collection of unlabelled image and you need to go through them one at a time to assign labels. Simply having the model offer a best guess and display the top 3 results lets you step through each image in a matter of seconds!</p><p>Even if the top 3 results are wrong, this can help you narrow down your search. Over time, newer models will get better, and the labelling process can even be somewhat fun!</p><p>In <a href=\"https://towardsdatascience.com/learnings-from-a-machine-learning-engineer-part-4-the-model/\">Part 4</a>, I will show how you can bulk identify images and take this to the next level for faster labelling.</p><p>I mentioned the example above of two species that look very similar, the chimpanzee and the bonobo. When you start out building your data set, you may have very sparse coverage of one or both of these species. In machine learning terms, we these “classes”. One option is to roll with what you have and hope that the model picks up on the differences with only a handful of example images.</p><p>The option that I have used is to merge two or more classes into one, at least temporarily. So, in this case I would create a class called “chimp-bonobo”, which is composed of the limited example pictures of chimpanzee and bonobo species classes. Combined, these may give me enough to train the model on “chimp-bonobo”, with the trade-off that it’s a more generic identification.</p><p>Sub-classes can even be normal variations. For example,&nbsp;&nbsp;pink flamingos are grey instead of pink. Or, male and female orangutans have distinct facial features. You wan to have a fairly balanced number of images for these normal variations, and keeping sub-classes will allow you to accomplish this.</p><p>Don’t be concerned that you are merging completely different looking classes — the neural network does a nice job of applying the “OR” operator. This works both ways — it can help you identify male or female variations as one species, but it can hurt you when “bad” outlier images sneak in like the example “open field with a zebra in the distance.”</p><p>Over time, you will (hopefully) be able to collect more images of the sub-classes and then be able to successfully split them apart (if necessary) and train the model to identify them separately. This process has worked very well for me. Just be sure to double-check all the images when you split them to ensure the labels didn’t get accidentally mixed up — it will be time well spent.</p><p>All of this certainly depends on your user requirements, and you can handle this in different ways either by creating a unique class label like “chimp-bonobo”, or at the front-end presentation layer where you notify the user that you have intentionally merged these classes and provide guidance on further refining the results. Even after you decide to split the two classes, you may want to caution the user that the model could be wrong since the two classes are so similar.</p><p>I realize this was a long write-up for something that on the surface seems intuitive, but these are all areas that I have tripped me up in the past because I didn’t give them enough attention. Once you have a solid understanding of these principles, you can go on to build a successful application.</p><p>In&nbsp;<a href=\"https://towardsdatascience.com/learnings-from-a-machine-learning-engineer-part-2-the-data-sets/\">Part 2</a>, we will take the curated data we collected here to create the classic data sets, with a custom benchmark set that will further enhance your data. Then we will see how best to evaluate our trained model using a specific “training mindset”, and switch to a “production mindset” when evaluating a deployed model.</p>","contentLength":13198,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Learnings from a Machine Learning Engineer — Part 4: The Model","url":"https://towardsdatascience.com/learnings-from-a-machine-learning-engineer-part-4-the-model/","date":1739480022,"author":"David Martin","guid":3,"unread":true,"content":"<p>In this latest part of my series, I will share what I have learned on selecting a model for <a href=\"https://towardsdatascience.com/tag/image-classification/\" title=\"Image Classification\">Image Classification</a> and how to fine tune that model. I will also show how you can leverage the model to accelerate your labelling process, and finally how to justify your efforts by generating usage and performance statistics.</p><p>In&nbsp;<a href=\"https://towardsdatascience.com/learnings-from-a-machine-learning-engineer-part-1-the-data/\">Part 1</a>, I discussed the process of labelling your image data that you use in your image classification project. I showed how define “good” images and create sub-classes. In&nbsp;<a href=\"https://towardsdatascience.com/learnings-from-a-machine-learning-engineer-part-2-the-data-sets/\">Part 2</a>, I went over various data sets, beyond the usual train-validation-test sets, with benchmark sets, plus how to handle synthetic data and duplicate images. In <a href=\"https://towardsdatascience.com/learnings-from-a-machine-learning-engineer-part-3-the-evaluation/\">Part 3</a>, I explained how to apply different evaluation criteria to a trained model versus a deployed model, and using benchmarks to determine when to deploy a model.</p><p>So far I have focused a lot of time on labelling and curating the set of images, and also evaluating model performance, which is like putting the cart before the horse. I’m not trying to minimize what it takes to design a massive neural network — this is a very important part of the application you are building. In my case, I spent a few weeks experimenting with different available models before settling on one that fit the bill.</p><p>Once you pick a model structure, you usually don’t make any major changes to it. For me, six years into deployment, I’m still using the same one. Specifically, I chose Inception V4 because it has a large input image size and an adequate number of layers to pick up on subtle image features. It also performs inference fast enough on CPU, so I don’t need to run expensive hardware to serve the model.</p><p>Your mileage may vary. But again, the main takeaway is that focusing on your data will pay dividends versus searching for the best model.</p><p>I will share a process that I found to work extremely well. Once I decided on the model to use, I randomly initialized the weights and let the model train for about 120 epoch before improvements plateau at a fairly modest accuracy, like 93%. At this point, I performed the evaluation of the trained model (see <a href=\"https://towardsdatascience.com/learnings-from-a-machine-learning-engineer-part-3-the-evaluation/\">Part 3</a>) to clean up the data set. I also incorporated new images as part of the data pipeline (see <a href=\"https://towardsdatascience.com/learnings-from-a-machine-learning-engineer-part-1-the-data/\">Part 1</a>) and prepared the data sets for the next training run.</p><p>Before starting the next training run, I simply take the last trained model, pop the output layer, and add it back in with random weights. Since the number of output classes are constantly increasing in my case, I have to pop that layer anyway to account for the new number of classes. Importantly, I leave the rest of the trained weights as they were and allow them to continue updating for the new classes.</p><p>This allows the model to train much faster before improvements stall. After repeating this process dozens of times, the training reaches plateau after about 20 epochs, and the test accuracy can reach 99%! The model is building upon the low-level features that it established from the previous runs while re-learning the output weights to prevent overfitting.</p><p>It took me a while to trust this process, and for a few years I would train from scratch every time. But after I attempted this and saw the training time (not to mention the cost of cloud GPU) go down while the accuracy continued to go up, I started to embrace the process. More importantly, I continue to see the evaluation metrics of the deployed model return solid performances.</p><p>During training, you can apply transformations on your images (called “augmentation”) to give you more diversity from you data set. With our zoo animals, it is fairly safe to apply left-right flop, slight rotations clockwise and counterclockwise, and slight resize that will zoom in and out.</p><p>With these transformations in mind, make sure your images are still able to act as good training images. In other words, an image where the subject is already small will be even smaller with a zoom out, so you probably want to discard the original. Also, some of your original pictures may need to be re-oriented by 90 degrees to be upright since a further rotation would make them look unusual.</p><p>As I mentioned in <a href=\"https://towardsdatascience.com/learnings-from-a-machine-learning-engineer-part-1-the-data/\">Part 1</a>, you can use the trained model to assist you in labelling images one at a time. But the way to take this even further is to have your newly trained model identify hundreds at a time while building a list of the results that you can then filter.</p><p>Typically, we have large collections of&nbsp;&nbsp;images that have come in either through regular usage of the application or some other means. Recall from <a href=\"https://towardsdatascience.com/learnings-from-a-machine-learning-engineer-part-1-the-data/\">Part 1</a> assigning “unknown” labels to interesting pictures but you have no clue what it is. By using the bulk identification method, we can sift through the collections quickly to target the labelling once we know what they are.</p><p>By combining your current image counts with the bulk identification results, you can target classes that need expanded coverage. Here are a few ways you can leverage bulk identification:</p><ul><li><strong>Increase low image counts</strong>&nbsp;— Some of your classes may have just barely made the cutoff to be included in the training set, which means you need more examples to improve coverage. Filter for images that have low counts.</li><li><strong>Replace staged or synthetic images</strong>&nbsp;— Some classes may be built entirely using non-real-world images. These pictures may be good enough to get started with, but may cause performance issues down the road because they look different than what typically comes through. Filter for classes that depend on staged images.</li><li>&nbsp;— A class in your data set may look like another one. For example, let’s say your model can identify an antelope, and that looks like a gazelle which your model cannot identify yet. Setting a filter for antelope and a lower confidence score may reveal gazelle images that you can label.</li><li>&nbsp;— You may not have known how to identify the dozens of cute wallaby pictures, so you saved them under “Unknown” because it was a good image. Now that you know what it is, you can filter for its look-alike kangaroo and quickly add a new class.</li><li><strong>Mass removal of low scores</strong>&nbsp;— As a way to clean out your large collection of unlabelled images that have nothing worth labelling, set a filter for lowest scores.</li></ul><p>Recall the decision I made to have image cutoffs from <a href=\"https://towardsdatascience.com/learnings-from-a-machine-learning-engineer-part-2-the-data-sets/\">Part 2</a>, which allows us to ensure an adequate number of example images of a class before we train and server a model to the public. The problem is that you may have a number of classes that are&nbsp;&nbsp;below your cutoff (in my case, 40) and don’t make it into the model.</p><p>The way I approach this is with a “throw-away” training run that I do not intend to move to production. I will decrease the lower cutoff from 40 to perhaps 35, build my train-validation-test sets, then train and evaluate like I normally do. The most important part of this is the bulk identification at the end!</p><p>There is a chance that somewhere in the large collection of unlabelled images I will find the few that I need. Doing the bulk identification with this throw-away model helps find them.</p><p>One very important aspect of any machine learning application is being able to show usage and performance reports. Your manager will likely want to see how many times the application is being used to justify the expense, and you as the ML engineer will want to see how the latest model is performing compared to the previous one.</p><p>You should build logging into your model serving to record every transaction going through the system. Also, the manual evaluations from <a href=\"https://towardsdatascience.com/learnings-from-a-machine-learning-engineer-part-3-the-evaluation/\">Part 3</a> should be recorded so you can report on performance for such things as accuracy over time, by model version, by confidence scores, by class, etc. You will be able to detect trends and make adjustments to improve the overall solution.</p><p>There are a lot of reporting tools, so I won’t recommend one over the other. Just make sure you are collecting as much information as you can to build these dashboards. This will justify the time, effort, and cost associated with maintaining the application.</p><p>We covered a lot of ground across this four-part series on building an image classification project and deploying it in the real world. It all starts with the data, and by investing the time and effort into maintaining the highest quality image library, you can reach impressive levels of model performance that will gain the trust and confidence of your business partners.</p><p>As a <a href=\"https://towardsdatascience.com/tag/machine-learning-engineer/\" title=\"Machine Learning Engineer\">Machine Learning Engineer</a>, you are primarily responsible for building and deploying your model.

For this post, we use the <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/cohere-command-embed/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Cohere v3 Embed</a> model on Amazon Bedrock to create our language embeddings.</p><p>To demonstrate some of the possible uses of these language embeddings, we developed an RSS aggregator website. RSS is a web feed that allows publications to publish updates in a standardized, computer-readable way. On our website, users can subscribe to an RSS feed and have an aggregated, categorized list of the new articles. We use embeddings to add the following functionalities:</p><p>This post uses this application as a reference point to discuss the technical implementation of the semantic search and zero-shot classification features.</p><p>This solution uses the following services:</p><p>The following diagram illustrates the solution architecture.</p><p>This section offers a quick primer on what embeddings are and how they can be used.</p><p>Embeddings are numerical representations of concepts or objects, such as language or images. In this post, we discuss language embeddings. By reducing these concepts to numerical representations, we can then use them in a way that a computer can understand and operate on.</p><p>Let’s take Berlin and Paris as an example. As humans, we understand the conceptual links between these two words. Berlin and Paris are both cities, they’re capitals of their respective countries, and they’re both in Europe. We understand their conceptual similarities almost instinctively, because we can create a model of the world in our head. However, computers have no built-in way of representing these concepts.</p><p>To represent these concepts in a way a computer can understand, we convert them into language embeddings. Language embeddings are high dimensional vectors that learn their relationships with each other through the training of a neural network. During training, the neural network is exposed to enormous amounts of text and learns patterns based on how words are colocated and relate to each other in different contexts.</p><p>Embedding vectors allow computers to model the world from language. For instance, if we embed “Berlin” and “Paris,” we can now perform mathematical operations on these embeddings. We can then observe some fairly interesting relationships. For instance, we could do the following: Paris – France + Germany ~= Berlin. This is because the embeddings capture the relationships between the words “Paris” and “France” and between “Germany” and “Berlin”—specifically, that Paris and Berlin are both capital cities of their respective countries.</p><p>The following graph shows the word vector distance between countries and their respective capitals.</p><p>Subtracting “France” from “Paris” removes the country semantics, leaving a vector representing the concept of a capital city. Adding “Germany” to this vector, we are left with something closely resembling “Berlin,” the capital of Germany. The vectors for this relationship are shown in the following graph.</p><p>For our use case, we use the pre-trained Cohere Embeddings model in Amazon Bedrock, which embeds entire texts rather than a single word. The embeddings represent the meaning of the text and can be operated on using mathematical operations. This property can be useful to map relationships such as similarity between texts.</p><p>One way in which we use language embeddings is by using their properties to calculate how similar an article is to one of the topics.</p><p>To do this, we break down a topic into a series of different and related embeddings. For instance, for culture, we have a set of embeddings for sports, TV programs, music, books, and so on. We then embed the incoming title and description of the RSS articles, and calculate the similarity against the topic embeddings. From this, we can assign topic labels to an article.</p><p>The following figure illustrates how this works. The embeddings that Cohere generates are highly dimensional, containing 1,024 values (or dimensions). However, to demonstrate how this system works, we use an algorithm designed to reduce the dimensionality of the embeddings, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T-distributed_stochastic_neighbor_embedding\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE)</a>, so that we can view them in two dimensions. The following image uses these embeddings to visualize how topics are clustered based on similarity and meaning.</p><p>You can use the embedding of an article and check the similarity of the article against the preceding embeddings. You can then say that if an article is clustered closely to one of these embeddings, it can be classified with the associated topic.</p><p>This is the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-nearest_neighbors_algorithm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) algorithm</a>. This algorithm is used to perform classification and regression tasks. In k-NN, you can make assumptions around a data point based on its proximity to other data points. For instance, you can say that an article that has proximity to the music topic shown in the preceding diagram can be tagged with the culture topic.</p><p>The following figure demonstrates this with an <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/07/the-climate-is-changing-so-fast-that-we-havent-seen-how-bad-extreme-weather-could-get/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">ArsTechnica article</a>. We plot against the embedding of an article’s title and description: (The climate is changing so fast that we haven’t seen how bad extreme weather could get: Decades-old statistics no longer represent what is possible in the present day).</p><p>The advantage of this approach is that you can add custom, user-generated topics. You can create a topic by first creating a series of embeddings of conceptually related items. For instance, an AI topic would be similar to the embeddings for AI, Generative AI, LLM, and Anthropic, as shown in the following screenshot.</p><p>In a traditional classification system, we’d be required to train a classifier—a supervised learning task where we’d need to provide a series of examples to establish whether an article belongs to its respective topic. Doing so can be quite an intensive task, requiring labeled data and training the model. For our use case, we can provide examples, create a cluster, and tag articles without having to provide labeled examples or train additional models. This is shown in the following screenshot of results page of our website.</p><p>In our application, we ingest new articles on a schedule. We use EventBridge schedules to periodically call a Lambda function, which checks if there are new articles. If there are, it creates an embedding from them using Amazon Bedrock and Cohere.</p><p>We calculate the article’s distance to the different topic embeddings, and can then determine whether the article belongs to that category. This is done with Aurora PostgreSQL with pgvector. We store the embeddings of the topics and then calculate their distance using the following SQL query:</p><div><pre><code>const topics = await sqlClient.then(it=&gt; it.query(\n    `SELECT name, embedding_description, similarity\n     FROM (SELECT topic_id as name, embedding_description, (1- ABS( 1 –(embed.embedding &lt;-&gt; $1))) AS \"similarity\" FROM topic_embedding_link embed)  topics\n     ORDER BY similarity desc`,\n    [toSql(articleEmbedding)]\n  ))\n</code></pre></div><p>The &lt;-&gt; operator in the preceding code calculates the Euclidean distance between the article and the topic embedding. This number allows us to understand how close an article is to one of the topics. We can then determine the appropriateness of a topic based on this ranking.</p><p>We then tag the article with the topic. We do this so that the subsequent request for a topic is as computationally as light as possible; we do a simple join rather than calculating the Euclidean distance.</p><div><div><pre><code>const formattedTopicInsert = pgformat(\n    `INSERT INTO feed_article_topic_link(topic_id, feed_article_id) VALUES %L ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING`,\n    topicLinks\n  )</code></pre></div></div><p>We also cache a specific topic/feed combination because these are calculated hourly and aren’t expected to change in the interim.</p><p>As previously discussed, the embeddings produced by Cohere contain a multitude of features; they embed the meanings and semantics of a word of phrase. We’ve also found that we can perform mathematical operations on these embeddings to do things such as calculate the similarity between two phrases or words.</p><p>We can use these embeddings and calculate the similarity between a search term and an embedding of an article with the k-NN algorithm to find articles that have similar semantics and meanings to the search term we’ve provided.</p><p>For example, in one of our RSS feeds, we have a lot of different articles that rate products. In a traditional search system, we’d rely on keyword matches to provide relevant results. Although it might be simple to find a specific article (for example, by searching “best digital notebooks”), we would need a different method to capture multiple product list articles.</p><p>In a semantic search system, we first transform the term “Product list” in an embedding. We can then use the properties of this embedding to perform a search within our embedding space. Using the k-NN algorithm, we can find articles that are semantically similar. As shown in the following screenshot, despite not containing the text “Product list” in either the title or description, we’ve been able to find articles that contain a product list. This is because we were able to capture the semantics of the query and match it to the existing embeddings we have for each article.</p><p>In our application, we store these embeddings using pgvector on Aurora PostgreSQL. pgvector is an open source extension that enables vector similarity search in PostgreSQL. We transform our search term into an embedding using Amazon Bedrock and Cohere v3 Embed.</p><p>After we’ve converted the search term to an embedding, we can compare it with the embeddings on the article that have been saved during the ingestion process. We can then use pgvector to find articles that are clustered together. The SQL code for that is as follows:</p><div><pre><code>SELECT *\nFROM (\n    SELECT feed_articles.id as id, title, feed_articles.feed_id as feed, feedName, slug, description, url, author, image, published_at as published, 1 - ABS(1 - (embedding &lt;-&gt; $2)) AS \"similarity\"\n    FROM feed_articles\n    INNER JOIN (select feed_id, name as feedName from feed_user_subscription fus where fus.user_id=$1) sub on feed_articles.feed_id=sub.feed_id\n    ${feedId != undefined ? `WHERE feed_articles.feed_id = $4` : \"\"}\n)\nWHERE similarity &gt; 0.95\nORDER BY similarity desc\nLIMIT $3;\n</code></pre></div><p>This code calculates the distance between the topics, and the embedding of this article as “similarity.” If this distance is close, then we can assume that the topic of the article is related, and we therefore attach the topic to the article.</p><p>To deploy this application in your own account, you need the following prerequisites:</p><ul><li>Model access for Cohere Embed English.

Also, we talked about classes and sub-classes of your data. These may seem pretty straight forward concepts, but it’s important to have a solid understanding going forward. So, if you haven’t, please check it out.</p><p>Now we will discuss how to build the various data sets and the techniques that have worked well for my application. Then in the <a href=\"https://towardsdatascience.com/learnings-from-a-machine-learning-engineer-part-3-the-evaluation/\">next part</a>, we will dive into the evaluation of your models, beyond simple accuracy.</p><p>I will again use the example zoo animals image classification app.</p><p>As machine learning engineers, we are all familiar with the train-validation-test sets, but when we include the concept of sub-classes discussed in <a href=\"https://towardsdatascience.com/learnings-from-a-machine-learning-engineer-part-1-the-data/\">Part 1</a>, and incorporate to concepts discussed below to set a minimum and maximum image count per class, as well as staged and synthetic data to the mix, the process gets a bit more complicated. I had to create a custom script to handle these options.</p><p>I will walk you through these concepts before we split the data for training:</p><ul><li>&nbsp;— Too few images and your model performance will suffer. Too many and you spend more time training than it’s worth.</li><li>&nbsp;— Your model indicates how confident it is in the predictions. Let’s use that to decide when to present results to the user.</li><li>&nbsp;— Real-world data is messy and the benchmark sets should reflect that. These need to stretch the model to the limit and help us decide when it is ready for production.</li><li><strong>Staged and synthetic data</strong>&nbsp;— Real-world data is king, but sometimes you need to produce the your own or even generate data to get off the ground. Be careful it doesn’t hurt performance.</li><li>&nbsp;— Repeat data can skew your results and give you a false sense of performance. Make sure your data is diverse.</li><li>&nbsp;— Combine sub-classes, apply cutoffs, and create your train-validation-test sets. Now we are ready to get the show started.</li></ul><p>In my experience, using a minimum of 40 images per class provides descent performance. Since I like to use 10% each for the test set and validation set, that means at least 4 images will be used to check the training set, which feels just barely adequate. Using fewer than 40 images per class, I notice my model evaluation tends to suffer.</p><p>On the other end, I set a maximum of about 125 images per class. I have found that the performance gains tend to plateau beyond this, so having more data will slow down the training run with little to show for it. Having more than the maximum is fine, and these “overflow” can be added to the test set, so they don’t go to waste.</p><p>There are times when I will drop the minimum cutoff to, say 35, with no intention of moving the trained model to production. Instead, the purpose is to leverage this throw-away model to find more images from my unlabelled set. This is a technique that I will go into more detail in <a href=\"https://towardsdatascience.com/learnings-from-a-machine-learning-engineer-part-3-the-evaluation/\">Part 3</a>.</p><p>You are likely familiar with the softmax score. As a reminder, softmax is the probability assigned to each label. I like to think of it as a confidence score, and we are interested in the class that receives the highest confidence. Softmax is a value between zero and one, but I find it easier to interpret confidence scores between zero and 100, like a percentage.</p><p>In order to decide if the model is confident enough with its prediction, I have chosen a threshold of 95. I use this threshold when determining if I want to present results to the user.</p><p>Scores above the threshold have a better changes of being right, so I can confidently provide the results. Scores below the threshold may not be right — in fact it could be “out-of-scope”, meaning it’s something the model doesn’t know how to identify. So, instead of taking the risk of presenting incorrect results, I instead prompt the user to try again and offer suggestions on how to take a “good” picture.</p><p>Admittedly this is somewhat arbitrary cutoff, and you should decide for your use-case what is appropriate. In fact, this score could probably be adjusted for each trained model, but this would make it harder to compare performance across models.</p><p>I will refer to this confidence score frequently in the evaluations section in <a href=\"https://towardsdatascience.com/learnings-from-a-machine-learning-engineer-part-3-the-evaluation/\">Part 3</a>.</p><p>Let me introduce what I call the benchmark sets, which you can think of as extended test sets. These are hand-picked images designed to stretch the limits of your model, and provide a measure for specific classes of your data. Use these benchmarks to justify moving your model to production, and for an objective measure to show to your manager.</p><ul><li>&nbsp;— These are the “extra credit” images, like the bonus questions a professor would add to the quiz to see which students are paying attention. You need a keen eye to spot the difference between the ground truth and a similar looking class. For example, a cheetah sleeping in the shade that could pass as a leopard if you don’t look closely.</li><li>&nbsp;— These are the “trick question” images. Our model is trained on zoo animals, but people are known for not following the rules. For example, a zoo guest takes a picture of their child wearing cheetah face paint.</li><li>&nbsp;— These are your “bread and butter” classes that need to get near perfect scores and zero errors. This would be a make-or-break benchmark for moving to production.</li><li>&nbsp;— These are your “rare but exceptional” classes that again need to be correct, but reach a minimum score like the confidence threshold.</li></ul><p>When looking for images to add to the benchmarks, you can likely find them in real-world images from your deployed model. See the evaluation in <a href=\"https://towardsdatascience.com/learnings-from-a-machine-learning-engineer-part-3-the-evaluation/\">Part 3</a>.</p><p>For each benchmark, calculate the min, max, median, and mean scores, and also how many images get scores above and below the confidence threshold. Now you can compare these measures against what is currently in production, and against your minimum requirements, to help decide if the new model is production worthy.</p><p>Perhaps the biggest hurdle to any supervised machine learning application is having data to train the model. Clearly, “real-world” data that comes from actual users of the application is ideal. However you can’t really collect these until the model is deployed. Chicken and egg problem.</p><p>One way to get started to is to have volunteers collect “staged” images for you, trying to act like real users. So, let’s have our zoo staff go around taking pictures of the animals. This is a good start, but there will be a certain level of bias introduced in these images. For example, the staff may take the photos over a few days, so you may not get the year-round weather conditions.</p><p>Another way to get pictures is use computer-generated “synthetic” images. I would avoid these at all costs, to be honest. Based on my experience, the model struggles with these because they look…different. The lighting is not natural, the subject may superimposed on a background and so the edges look too sharp, etc. Granted, some of the AI generated images look very realistic, but if you look closely you may spot something unusual. The neural network in your model will notice these, so be careful.</p><p>The way that I handle these staged or synthetic images is as a sub-class that gets merged into the training set, but only&nbsp;&nbsp;giving preference to the real-world images. I cap the number of staged images to 60, so if I have 10 real-world, I now only need 50 staged. Eventually, these staged and synthetic images are phased out completely, and I rely entirely on real-world.</p><p>One problem that can creep into your image set are duplicate images. These can be exact copies of pictures, or they can be extremely similar. You may think that this is harmless, but imagine having 100 pictures of an elephant that are exactly the same — your model will not know what to do with a different angle of the elephant.</p><p>Now, let’s say you have only&nbsp;&nbsp;pictures that are nearly the same. Not so bad, right? Well, here is what can happen to them:</p><ul><li>Both pictures go in the training set — The model doesn’t learn anything from the repeated image and it wastes time processing them.</li><li>One goes into the training set, the other goes into the test set — Your test score will be higher, but it is not an accurate evaluation.</li><li>Both are in the test set — Your test score will be compounded either higher or lower than it should be.</li></ul><p>None of these will help your model.</p><p>There are a few ways to find duplicates. The approach I have taken is to calculate a hamming distance on all the pictures and identify the ones that are very close. I have an interface that displays the duplicates and I decide which one I like best, and remove the other.</p><p>Another way (I haven’t tried this yet) is to create a vector representation of your images. Store these a vector database, and you can do a similarity search to find nearly identical images.</p><p>Whatever method you use, it is important to clean up the duplicates.</p><p>Now we are ready to build the traditional training, validation, and test sets. This is no longer a straight forward task since I want to:</p><ol><li>Merge sub-classes into a main class.</li><li>Prioritize real-world images over staged or synthetic images.</li><li>Apply a minimum number of images per class.</li><li>Apply a maximum number of images per class, sending the “overflow” to the test set.</li></ol><p>This process is somewhat complicated and depends on how you manage your image library. First, I would recommend keeping your images in a folder structure that has sub-class folders. You can get image counts by using a script to simply read the folders. Second is to keep a configuration of how the sub-classes are merged. To really set yourself up for success, put these image counts and merge rules in a database for faster lookups.</p><p>My train-validation-test set splits are usually 90–10–0. I originally started out using 80–10–10, but with diligence on keeping the entire data set clean, I noticed validation and test scores became pretty even. This allowed me to increase the training set size, and use “overflow” to become the test set, as well as using the benchmark sets.</p><p>In this part, we’ve built our data sets by merging sub-classes and using the image count cutoffs. Plus we handle staged and synthetic data as well as cleaning up duplicate images. We also created benchmark sets and defined confidence thresholds, which help us decide when to move a model to production.</p><p>In&nbsp;<a href=\"https://towardsdatascience.com/learnings-from-a-machine-learning-engineer-part-3-the-evaluation/\">Part 3</a>, we will discuss how we are going to evaluate the different model performances. And then finally we will get to the actual model training and the techniques to enhance accuracy.<a href=\"https://medium.com/tag/machine-learning?source=post_page-----1948daf60483---------------------------------------\"></a></p>","contentLength":10545,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Coding Interviews were HARD Until I Learned These 20 Tips","url":"https://blog.algomaster.io/p/20-coding-interviews-tips","date":1739467827,"author":"Ashish Pratap Singh","guid":431,"unread":true,"content":"<p>I gave my first  in 2016—and failed.

We can call the function again.\nres, _ = fn.Call(ctx, api.EncodeI32(b), api.EncodeI32(c))\nfmt.Printf(\"add(%d, %d) = %d\\n\", b, c, api.DecodeI32(res[0]))\n</code></pre><p>The  directive and the reactor build mode allow applications to\nbe extended by calling into Go-based Wasm code.\nThis is particularly valuable for applications that have adopted Wasm as a\nplugin or extension mechanism with well-defined interfaces.\nBy exporting Go functions, applications can leverage the Go Wasm modules to\nprovide functionality without needing to recompile the entire application.\nFurthermore, building as a reactor ensures that the exported functions can be\ncalled multiple times without requiring reinitialization, making it suitable\nfor long-running applications or services.</p><h2>Supporting rich types between the host and the client</h2><p>Go 1.24 also relaxes the constraints on types that can be used as input and\nresult parameters with  functions.\nFor example, one can pass a bool, a string, a pointer to an , or a\npointer to a struct which embeds  and contains supported\nfield types\n(see the <a href=\"https://go.dev/cmd/compile#hdr-WebAssembly_Directives\">documentation</a> for detail).\nThis allows Go Wasm applications to be written in a more natural and ergonomic\nway, and removes some unnecessary type conversions.</p><p>While Go 1.24 has made significant enhancements to its Wasm capabilities,\nthere are still some notable limitations.</p><p>Wasm is a single-threaded architecture with no parallelism.\nA  function can spawn new goroutines.\nBut if a function creates a background goroutine, it will not continue\nexecuting when the  function returns, until calling back into\nthe Go-based Wasm module.</p><p>While some type restrictions have been relaxed in Go 1.24, there are still\nlimitations on the types that can be used with  and\n functions.\nDue to the unfortunate mismatch between the 64-bit architecture of the client\nand the 32-bit architecture of the host, it is not possible to pass pointers in\nmemory.\nFor example, a  function cannot take a pointer to a struct that\ncontains a pointer-typed field.</p><p>The addition of the ability to build a WASI reactor and export Go functions to\nWasm in Go 1.24 represent a significant step forward for Go’s WebAssembly\ncapabilities.\nThese features empower developers to create more versatile and powerful Go-based\nWasm applications, opening up new possibilities for Go in the Wasm ecosystem.</p>","contentLength":5777,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"2024 State of Rust Survey Results","url":"https://blog.rust-lang.org/2025/02/13/2024-State-Of-Rust-Survey-results.html","date":1739404800,"author":"The Rust Survey Team","guid":130,"unread":true,"content":"<p>The Rust Survey Team is excited to share the results of our <a href=\"https://blog.rust-lang.org/2024/12/05/annual-survey-2024-launch.html\">2024 survey on the Rust Programming language</a>, conducted between December 5, 2024 and December 23, 2024.\nAs in previous years, the 2024 State of Rust Survey was focused on gathering insights and feedback from Rust users, and all those who are interested in the future of Rust more generally.</p><p>This ninth edition of the survey surfaced new insights and learning opportunities straight from the global Rust language community, which we will summarize below. In addition to this blog post,  containing charts with aggregated results of all questions in the survey.</p><p><strong>Our sincerest thanks to every community member who took the time to express their opinions and experiences with Rust over the past year. Your participation will help us make Rust better for everyone.</strong></p><p>There's a lot of data to go through, so strap in and enjoy!</p><table><thead><tr></tr></thead><tbody><tr></tr><tr></tr></tbody></table><p>As shown above, in 2024, we have received fewer survey views than in the previous year. This was likely caused simply by the fact that the survey ran only for two weeks, while in the previous year it ran for almost a month. However, the completion rate has also dropped, which seems to suggest that the survey might be a bit too long. We will take this into consideration for the next edition of the survey.</p><p>The State of Rust survey not only gives us excellent insight into how many Rust users around the world are using and experiencing the language but also gives us insight into the makeup of our global community. This information gives us a sense of where the language is being used and where access gaps might exist for us to address over time. We hope that this data and our related analysis help further important discussions about how we can continue to prioritize global access and inclusivity in the Rust community.</p><p>Same as every year, we asked our respondents in which country they live in. The top 10 countries represented were, in order: United States (22%), Germany (14%), United Kingdom (6%), France (6%), China (5%), Canada (3%), Netherlands (3%), Russia (3%), Australia (2%), and Sweden (2%). We are happy to see that Rust is enjoyed by users from all around the world! You can try to find your country in the chart below:</p><p>We also asked whether respondents consider themselves members of a marginalized community. Out of those who answered, 74.5% selected no, 15.5% selected yes, and 10% preferred not to say.</p><p>We have asked the group that selected “yes” which specific groups they identified as being a member of. The majority of those who consider themselves a member of an underrepresented or marginalized group in technology identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual, or otherwise non-heterosexual. The second most selected option was neurodivergent at 46% followed by trans at 35%.</p><p>Each year, we must acknowledge the diversity, equity, and inclusivity (DEI) related gaps in the Rust community and open source as a whole. We believe that excellent work is underway at the Rust Foundation to advance global access to Rust community gatherings and distribute grants to a diverse pool of maintainers each cycle, which you can learn more about <a href=\"https://rustfoundation.org/community\">here</a>. Even so, global inclusion and access is just one element of DEI, and the survey working group will continue to advocate for progress in this domain.</p><p>The number of respondents that self-identify as a Rust user was quite similar to last year, around 92%. This high number is not surprising, since we primarily target existing Rust developers with this survey.</p><p>Similarly as last year, around 31% of those who did not identify as Rust users cited the perception of difficulty as the primary reason for not using Rust. The most common reason for not using Rust was that the respondents simply haven’t had the chance to try it yet.</p><p>Of the former Rust users who participated in the 2024 survey, 36% cited factors outside their control as a reason why they no longer use Rust, which is a 10pp decrease from last year. This year, we also asked respondents if they would consider using Rust again if an opportunity comes up, which turns out to be true for a large fraction of the respondents (63%). That is good to hear!</p><blockquote><p>Closed answers marked with N/A were not present in the previous version(s) of the survey.</p></blockquote><p>Those not using Rust anymore told us that it is because they don't really need it (or the goals of their company changed) or because it was not the right tool for the job. A few reported being overwhelmed by the language or its ecosystem in general or that switching to or introducing Rust would have been too expensive in terms of human effort.</p><p>Of those who used Rust in 2024, 53% did so on a daily (or nearly daily) basis — an increase of 4pp from the previous year. We can observe an upward trend in the frequency of Rust usage over the past few years, which suggests that Rust is being increasingly used at work. This is also confirmed by other answers mentioned in the Rust at Work section later below.</p><p>Rust expertise is also continually increasing amongst our respondents! 20% of respondents can write (only) simple programs in Rust (a decrease of 3pp from 2023), while 53% consider themselves productive using Rust — up from 47% in 2023. While the survey is just one tool to measure the changes in Rust expertise overall, these numbers are heartening as they represent knowledge growth for many Rustaceans returning to the survey year over year.</p><p>Unsurprisingly, the most popular version of Rust is , either the most recent one or whichever comes with the users' Linux distribution. Almost a third of users also use the latest nightly release, due to various reasons (see below). However, it seems that the beta toolchain is not used much, which is a bit unfortunate. We would like to encourage Rust users to use the beta toolchain more (e.g. in CI environments) to help test soon-to-be stabilized versions of Rust.</p><p>People that use the nightly toolchain mostly do it to gain access to specific unstable language features. Several users have also mentioned that rustfmt works better for them on nightly or that they use the nightly compiler because of faster compilation times.</p><p>To use Rust, programmers first have to learn it, so we are always interested in finding out how do they approach that. Based on the survey results, it seems that most users learn from Rust documentation and also from <a href=\"https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/\">The Rust Programming Language</a> book, which has been a favourite learning resource of new Rustaceans for a long time. Many people also seem to learn by reading the source code of Rust crates. The fact that both the documentation and source code of tens of thousands of Rust crates is available on <a href=\"https://docs.rs\">docs.rs</a> and GitHub makes this easier.</p><p>In terms of answers belonging to the \"Other\" category, they can be clustered into three categories: people using LLM (large language model) assistants (Copilot, ChatGPT, Claude, etc.), reading the official Rust forums (Discord, <a href=\"https://users.rust-lang.org/\">URLO</a>) or being mentored while contributing to Rust projects. We would like to extend a big thank you to those making our spaces friendly and welcoming for newcomers, as it is important work and it pays off. Interestingly, a non-trivial number of people \"learned by doing\" and used rustc error messages and clippy as a guide, which is a good indicator of the quality of Rust diagnostics.</p><p>In terms of formal education, it seems that Rust has not yet penetrated university curriculums, as this is typically a very slowly moving area. Only a very small number of respondents (around 3%) have taken a university Rust course or used university learning materials.</p><p>In terms of operating systems used by Rustaceans, Linux was the most popular choice, and it seems that it is getting increasingly popular year after year. It is followed by macOS and Windows, which have a very similar share of usage.</p><blockquote><p>As you can see in the <a href=\"https://blog.rust-lang.org/images/2025-02-13-rust-survey-2024/which-os-do-you-use-wordcloud.png\">wordcloud</a>, there are also a few users that prefer Arch, btw.</p></blockquote><p>Rust programmers target a diverse set of platforms with their Rust programs. We saw a slight uptick in users targeting embedded and mobile platforms, but otherwise the distribution of platforms stayed mostly the same as last year. Since the WebAssembly target is quite diverse, we have split it into two separate categories this time. Based on the results it is clear that when using WebAssembly, it is mostly in the context of browsers (23%) rather than other use-cases (7%).</p><p>We cannot of course forget the favourite topic of many programmers: which IDE (developer environment) they use. Although Visual Studio Code still remains the most popular option, its share has dropped by 5pp this year. On the other hand, the Zed editor seems to have gained considerable traction recently. The small percentage of those who selected \"Other\" are using a wide range of different tools: from CursorAI to classics like Kate or Notepad++. Special mention to the 3 people using \"ed\", that's quite an achievement.</p><blockquote><p>You can also take a look at the linked <a href=\"https://blog.rust-lang.org/images/2025-02-13-rust-survey-2024/what-ide-do-you-use-wordcloud.png\">wordcloud</a> that summarizes open answers to this question (the \"Other\" category), to see what other editors are also popular.</p></blockquote><p>We were excited to see that more and more people use Rust at work for the majority of their coding, 38% vs 34% from last year. There is a clear upward trend in this metric over the past few years.</p><p>The usage of Rust within companies also seems to be rising, as 45% of respondents answered that their organisation makes non-trivial use of Rust, which is a 7pp increase from 2023.</p><p>Once again, the top reason employers of our survey respondents invested in Rust was the ability to build relatively correct and bug-free software. The second most popular reason was Rust’s performance characteristics. 21% of respondents that use Rust at work do so because they already know it, and it's thus their default choice, an uptick of 5pp from 2023. This seems to suggest that Rust is becoming one of the baseline languages of choice for more and more companies.</p><p>Similarly to the previous year, a large percentage of respondents (82%) report that Rust helped their company achieve its goals. In general, it seems that programmers and companies are quite happy with their usage of Rust, which is great!</p><p>In terms of technology domains, the situation is quite similar to the previous year. Rust seems to be especially popular for creating server backends, web and networking services and cloud technologies. It also seems to be gaining more traction for embedded use-cases.</p><blockquote><p>You can scroll the chart to the right to see more domains. Note that the Automotive domain was not offered as a closed answer in the 2023 survey (it was merely entered through open answers), which might explain the large jump.</p></blockquote><p>It is exciting to see the continued growth of professional Rust usage and the confidence so many users feel in its performance, control, security and safety, enjoyability, and more!</p><p>As always, one of the main goals of the State of Rust survey is to shed light on challenges, concerns, and priorities on Rustaceans’ minds over the past year.</p><p>We have asked our users about aspects of Rust that limit their productivity. Perhaps unsurprisingly, slow compilation was at the top of the list, as it seems to be a perennial concern of Rust users. As always, there are efforts underway to improve the speed of the compiler, such as enabling the <a href=\"https://blog.rust-lang.org/2023/11/09/parallel-rustc.html\">parallel frontend</a> or switching to a <a href=\"https://blog.rust-lang.org/2024/05/17/enabling-rust-lld-on-linux.html\">faster linker by default</a>. We invite you to test these improvements and let us know if you encounter any issues.</p><p>Other challenges included subpar support for debugging Rust and high disk usage of Rust compiler artifacts. On the other hand, most Rust users seem to be very happy with its runtime performance, the correctness and stability of the compiler and also Rust's documentation.</p><p>In terms of specific unstable (or missing) features that Rust users want to be stabilized (or implemented), the most desired ones were async closures and if/let while chains. Well, we have good news! Async closures will be stabilized in the next version of Rust (1.85), and if/let while chains will hopefully follow <a href=\"https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/132833\">soon after</a>, once Edition 2024 is released (which will also happen in Rust 1.85).</p><p>Other coveted features are generators (both sync and async) and more powerful generic const expressions. You can follow the <a href=\"https://rust-lang.github.io/rust-project-goals/2025h1/goals.html\">Rust Project Goals</a> to track the progress of these (and other) features.</p><p>In the open answers to this question, people were really helpful and tried hard to describe the most notable issues limiting their productivity. We have seen mentions of struggles with async programming (an all-time favourite), debuggability of errors (which people generally love, but they are not perfect for everyone) or Rust tooling being slow or resource intensive (rust-analyzer and rustfmt). Some users also want a better IDE story and improved interoperability with other languages.</p><p>This year, we have also included a new question about the speed of Rust's evolution. While most people seem to be content with the status quo, more than a quarter of people who responded to this question would like Rust to stabilize and/or add features more quickly, and only 7% of respondents would prefer Rust to slow down or completely stop adding new features.</p><p>Interestingly, when we asked respondents about their main worries for the future of Rust, one of the top answers remained the worry that Rust will become too complex. This seems to be in contrast with the answers to the previous question. Perhaps Rust users still seem to consider the complexity of Rust to be manageable, but they worry that one day it might become too much.</p><p>We are happy to see that the amount of respondents concerned about Rust Project governance and lacking support of the Rust Foundation has dropped by about 6pp from 2023.</p><p>Each year, the results of the State of Rust survey help reveal the areas that need improvement in many areas across the Rust Project and ecosystem, as well as the aspects that are working well for our community.</p><p>If you have any suggestions for the Rust Annual survey, please <a href=\"https://github.com/rust-lang/surveys/issues\">let us know</a>!</p><p>We are immensely grateful to those who participated in the 2024 State of Rust Survey and facilitated its creation. While there are always challenges associated with developing and maintaining a programming language, this year we were pleased to see a high level of survey participation and candid feedback that will truly help us make Rust work better for everyone.</p><p>If you’d like to dig into more details, we recommend you to browse through the full <a href=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rust-lang/surveys/main/surveys/2024-annual-survey/report/annual-survey-2024-report.pdf\">survey report</a>.</p>","contentLength":14399,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Giampaolo Rodola: psutil: drop Python 2.7 support","url":"https://gmpy.dev/blog/2025/psutil-drop-python-27-support","date":1739401200,"author":"","guid":156,"unread":true,"content":"<p>About dropping Python 2.7 support in psutil, 3 years ago\n<a href=\"https://github.com/giampaolo/psutil/issues/2014#issuecomment-969263432\">I stated</a>:</p><blockquote><p>Not a chance, for many years to come.

Not on Windows though,\nfor which I had to use a separate service (Appveyor). Still, the amount of\nhacks in psutil source code necessary to support Python 2.7 piled up over the\nyears, and became quite big. Some disadvantages that come to mind:</p><ul><li>Having to maintain a Python compatibility layers like\n  <a href=\"https://github.com/giampaolo/psutil/blob/fbb6d9ce98f930d3d101b7df5a4f4d0f1d2b35a3/psutil/_compat.py\">psutil/_compat.py</a>.\n  This translated in extra extra code and extra imports.</li><li>The C compatibility layer to differentiate between Python 2 and 3 (<code>#if\n  PY_MAJOR_VERSION &lt;= 3</code>, etc.).</li><li>Dealing with the string vs. unicode differences, both in Python and in C.</li><li>Inability to use modern language features, especially f-strings.</li><li>Inability to freely use s, which created a difference on how CONSTANTS\n  were exposed in terms of API.</li><li>Having to install a specific version of  and other (outdated)\n  <a href=\"https://github.com/giampaolo/psutil/blob/fbb6d9ce98f930d3d101b7df5a4f4d0f1d2b35a3/setup.py#L76-L85\">deps</a>.</li><li>Relying on the third-party Appveyor CI service to run tests and produce 2.7\n  wheels.</li><li>Running 4 extra CI jobs on every commit (Linux, macOS, Windows 32-bit,\n  Windows 64-bit) making the CI slower and more subject to failures (we have\n  quite a bit of flaky tests).</li><li>The distribution of 7 wheels specific for Python 2.7.
