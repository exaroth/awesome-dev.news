The approach presented here addresses these needs by creating a unified system where configuration metadata lives alongside the configuration values themselves. This creates a single source of truth that eliminates duplication and reduces the chance of documentation drift.</p><p>: Configuration fields are defined once with all metadata (validation, documentation, defaults); and can be easily extended.</p><p><strong>Default Value Definition with Build Flags</strong>: Production apps are often built for different environments, therefore some default configuration values must be defined by Go .</p><p>: Viper support for YAML, JSON, TOML, HCL, and ENV configuration files.</p><p>: Seamless integration with Cobra for command-line interfaces, data validation, and auto-completion.</p><p>: Strongly typed configuration with validation by Go Validator tags, custom functions, and literals.</p><p>: Automatic binding with configurable prefix.</p><p>: Built-in help and documentation generation.</p><p>Our application is called , and it uses two groups of configuration: application base parameters, like logging and updates, and network configuration, like proxies. The architecture demonstrates how to organize configuration fields into logical groups, making it easy for users to understand and manage related settings together. Each field carries its complete metadata, ensuring that validation rules, documentation, and defaults are always consistent across the entire application.</p><p>Users are expected to use the CLI to configure the application, like:</p><div><pre><code>confapp config .level debug .auto </code></pre></div><div><table><thead><tr></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Application environment (hidden)</td></tr><tr><td>Logging level (debug, info, warn, error)</td></tr><tr></tr><tr></tr><tr></tr></tbody></table></div><div><table><thead><tr></tr></thead><tbody><tr></tr><tr></tr></tbody></table></div><p>The implementation follows a modular approach where each component has a specific responsibility. The configuration module defines the fields and their metadata, Viper handles the actual storage and retrieval of values, and Cobra provides the user interface. This separation of concerns makes the system maintainable and allows each component to evolve independently while maintaining a stable interface between them.</p><p>The project structure reflects the separation between CLI commands and configuration logic. The  directory contains all CLI-related code, while the  directory houses the configuration management core. This organization makes it clear where to find specific functionality and ensures that the configuration logic remains independent of the CLI implementation.</p><div><pre><code>go-appconfig-example/\n‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ cmd/                   # CLI command implementations\n‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ root.go            # Root command and global flags\n‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ config.go          # Configuration management commands\n‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ internal/\n‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ config/            # Configuration management core\n‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ fields.go      # Field definitions and collections\n‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ config.go      # Viper integration\n‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ validators.go  # Custom validation functions\n‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ consts/            # Application constants\n‚îÇ       ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ consts.go      # Go flags like app name, version, etc.\n‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ main.go                # Application entry point\n‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ go.mod                 # Go module definition\n</code></pre></div><p>Application constants define global values that remain consistent throughout the application's lifecycle. These can be overridden at build time using Go's  feature, allowing you to customize the application name, version, or other constants without modifying the source code. This is particularly useful for CI/CD pipelines where different builds might need different configurations.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><h2>\n  \n  \n  Field-Driven Configuration </h2><p>Field-Driven Configuration is a design pattern where configuration parameters are defined as structured data containing all their metadata. Instead of scattering validation rules, documentation, and default values across different parts of the codebase, each field becomes a self-contained unit that describes everything about a configuration parameter. This approach ensures consistency and makes it trivial to add new configuration options without touching multiple files.</p><p>The Field structure is the cornerstone of our configuration system. It encapsulates not just the value of a configuration parameter, but also its type, validation rules, documentation, and any other metadata needed to work with that parameter. This rich metadata enables automatic generation of CLI flags, validation logic, and documentation, all from a single definition.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>The FieldCollection acts as a registry for all configuration fields in your application. It provides methods to add new fields dynamically and retrieve them efficiently. This centralized collection ensures that all parts of the application work with the same field definitions, maintaining consistency across CLI commands, validation, and documentation generation.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>With the Field structure and FieldCollection in place, we can now define actual configuration parameters. Each field definition becomes a single source of truth that contains everything needed to work with that configuration value. The use of init() functions ensures that fields are automatically registered when the package is imported, eliminating the need for manual registration and reducing the chance of forgetting to register a field.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Validation is handled through the <a href=\"https://github.com/go-playground/validator\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Go Validator library</a>, which provides a declarative way to define validation rules using struct tags. The library supports a wide range of built-in validators like , , , , , and many more. You can combine multiple validators using commas (AND logic) or pipes (OR logic). For example, <code>validate:\"required,email\"</code> ensures a field is both present and a valid email, while  accepts either RGB or RGBA color formats.</p><p>In our Field structure, we use the ValidateTag field to specify these validation rules, allowing us to leverage the full power of the validator library without writing repetitive validation code.</p><p>Beyond the built-in validators, the system supports custom validation functions for complex business logic that can't be expressed through tags alone. These functions receive the value to validate and return an error if validation fails, providing complete flexibility for domain-specific rules.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Viper provides the backbone for our configuration management system. It handles the complexity of merging configuration from multiple sources according to a well-defined precedence order: command-line flags override environment variables, which override config file values, which override defaults. This layered approach allows users to define base configurations in files while still being able to override specific values through environment variables in production or flags during development. Viper also manages the serialization and deserialization of configuration files in various formats, making it easy to work with YAML, JSON, TOML, or any other supported format without changing your code.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><h2>\n  \n  \n  Writing the CLI only once with Cobra </h2><p>The beauty of our Field-Driven approach truly shines when building the CLI with Cobra. Instead of manually defining flags for each configuration parameter and keeping them in sync with validation rules and documentation, our CLI commands automatically derive everything they need from the Field definitions. This means you write the CLI structure once, and it automatically adapts as you add new configuration fields. The commands can iterate through the FieldCollection to generate flags, completions, and documentation dynamically, ensuring that the CLI always reflects the current state of your configuration schema.</p><p>The root command serves as the entry point for your CLI application. While you can generate the initial structure using  for the root command and  for subcommands, the real power comes from integrating it with our Field system. The root command sets up global flags and initializes the configuration system before any subcommand runs, ensuring that all parts of the application work with properly loaded and validated configuration.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Cobra provides three types of flags: local flags (specific to a command), persistent flags (available to a command and all its subcommands), and the special PFlags type that integrates with Viper. When you bind a flag to Viper using , Viper automatically reads the flag value if it's set, allowing seamless integration between command-line arguments and your configuration system. This binding creates a unified interface where users can set values through flags, environment variables, or config files, and your application code doesn't need to know which source provided the value.</p><p>Our implementation uses persistent flags for global options like the config file path and verbosity level, ensuring these are available to all subcommands. The initialization happens in Cobra's  hook, which runs before any command execution, guaranteeing that configuration is properly loaded before your command logic runs.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>The configuration commands provide users with a powerful interface to interact with your application's settings. The beauty of this implementation is that these commands automatically work with any fields you define in your FieldCollection. The  command shows current values,  provides detailed documentation, and  allows modification - all without hardcoding any specific field names. This generic approach means that adding a new configuration field automatically makes it available in all these commands without any additional code changes.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Shell completion is one of Cobra's most powerful features, dramatically improving the user experience by providing intelligent suggestions as users type. The completion system works through  callbacks that receive the current command state and return possible completions. The  parameter contains arguments already provided, while  holds the partial text being typed. The function returns a list of completion suggestions and a directive that controls shell behavior (like whether to also suggest files).</p><p>Our implementation leverages the Field definitions to provide context-aware completions. When users type , the system suggests  as a completion. When setting values with valid options, like , the completion can even suggest the valid values (debug, info, warn, error) defined in the field. This deep integration between the configuration schema and the CLI ensures users always have helpful guidance when interacting with your application.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><h4>\n  \n  \n  Listing Configuration Values </h4><p>The list command provides users with a clear view of their current configuration state. By calculating the maximum field name length, the output is neatly aligned, making it easy to scan through settings. The ability to filter by prefix allows users to focus on specific configuration groups, while the hidden flag reveals internal settings that are normally concealed. This command is essential for debugging and verifying that configuration values are being loaded correctly from all sources.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><h4>\n  \n  \n  Setting Configuration Values </h4><p>The set command demonstrates the power of our Field-Driven approach by automatically creating flags for all configuration fields. When a user runs <code>config set --log.level debug</code>, Cobra parses the flag, our code validates it against the Field definition, and if valid, updates the value through Viper. The command then saves the configuration to disk, ensuring changes persist across application restarts. The validation happens before any values are saved, preventing invalid configurations from being written to disk and ensuring the application always works with valid settings.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><h4>\n  \n  \n  Auto-Documentation: Describing Parameters </h4><p>The describe command showcases how rich metadata in Field definitions enables automatic documentation generation. Each field's description, type, valid values, examples, and extended documentation are displayed in a structured format that helps users understand not just what a setting does, but how to use it effectively. The grouping feature organizes related fields together, making it easier to understand the relationships between different configuration options. This self-documenting nature ensures that documentation always stays in sync with the actual implementation.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>The Field-Driven Configuration approach delivers a powerful, user-friendly CLI that adapts automatically as your application evolves. Users benefit from intelligent completions, comprehensive documentation, and robust validation, while developers enjoy a maintainable system where adding new configuration options requires minimal code changes. The integration between Viper and Cobra through our Field abstraction creates a seamless experience where configuration can be managed through files, environment variables, or command-line flags with equal ease.</p><p>The build process leverages Go's  feature to inject build-time values into the application. This allows you to customize constants like application name, version, or even default configuration values without modifying source code. This is particularly useful in CI/CD pipelines where different environments might need different defaults, or when building white-labeled versions of your application.</p><div><pre><code>\ngo build  confapp\n\n\ngo build  myapp\n</code></pre></div><p>Shell completions transform the user experience by providing context-aware suggestions as users type. Once enabled, users can press Tab to see available options, making it easy to discover configuration fields without consulting documentation. The completion system understands the command structure and provides appropriate suggestions based on context, such as showing only valid values for fields with enumerated options.</p><div><pre><code> &lt;./confapp completion zsh &lt;./confapp completion bash</code></pre></div><div><pre><code>\n./confapp config list\n\n\n./confapp config list log\n./confapp config list proxy\n\n\n./confapp config describe\n\n\n./confapp config describe log.level update\n\n\n./confapp config .level debug\n./confapp config .level info .output /var/log/app.log\n\n\n./confapp config list \n./confapp config describe \n./confapp  config list\n</code></pre></div><p>The Field-Driven Configuration pattern presented in this article demonstrates how thoughtful abstraction can transform configuration management from a maintenance burden into a self-maintaining system. By defining configuration fields as first-class entities with rich metadata, we've created a solution that respects the Open-Closed Principle while providing exceptional developer and user experiences.</p><p>The integration of Viper, Cobra, and Go Validator through our Field abstraction eliminates the common pain points of configuration management: keeping documentation in sync, maintaining validation rules, and providing good CLI experiences. The result is a system where adding new configuration options is as simple as defining a new Field struct, and everything else - from CLI flags to validation to documentation - automatically adapts.</p><p>This approach scales elegantly from simple applications with a handful of settings to complex systems with hundreds of configuration parameters organized into logical groups. The automatic generation of completions and documentation ensures that as your application grows, it remains discoverable and user-friendly.</p><p>The architecture presented here provides a solid foundation that can be extended in several ways:</p><p>: Add support for multiple configuration profiles (development, staging, production) by extending the FieldCollection to support profile-specific overrides while maintaining the same validation and documentation capabilities.</p><p>: Implement configuration hot-reloading using Viper's WatchConfig functionality, with the Field definitions providing the validation layer to ensure changes are safe before applying them.</p><p>: Generate OpenAPI specifications or GraphQL schemas from Field definitions, ensuring that API documentation stays synchronized with configuration capabilities.</p><p>: Extend the Field structure to support complex nested configurations while maintaining the same validation and documentation benefits.</p><p>For a complete implementation with additional features like configuration profiles, pager support for long documentation, and more sophisticated validation examples, check out my <a href=\"https://github.com/lucasdecamargo/go-appconfig-example\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">GitHub repository</a>. </p><div><div><div><p>A production-ready template for managing configuration parameters in Go applications using  and .

That's essentially what a neural network does during forward propagation. It takes input data (the clues), processes it layer by layer (analyzes the evidence), and ultimately arrives at an output (solving the case). This process, called forward propagation, is the fundamental engine driving the power of neural networks, the cornerstone of modern machine learning. This article will demystify this crucial process, making it accessible to both beginners and those seeking a deeper understanding.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  What is Forward Propagation?\n</h3><p>Forward propagation is the process by which a neural network transforms input data into an output prediction. It's a series of calculations, flowing forward through the network's layers, each layer transforming the data slightly until a final prediction emerges. Think of it as a pipeline where data enters, undergoes a series of transformations, and finally exits as a refined prediction.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  The Architecture: Layers and Connections\n</h3><p>A neural network consists of interconnected layers:</p><ol><li> Receives the initial data.  For example, if classifying images, this layer might represent the pixel values.</li><li>  These layers perform the bulk of the processing, transforming the data through complex mathematical operations.  A network can have multiple hidden layers, increasing its complexity and learning capacity.</li><li> Produces the final prediction.  This could be a classification (cat or dog), a regression value (house price), or any other desired output.</li></ol><p>Each layer is composed of interconnected , which perform weighted sums of their inputs and apply an activation function to introduce non-linearity. These connections have associated  and , which are the parameters the network learns during training.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  The Mathematics:  A Step-by-Step Walkthrough\n</h3><p>Let's simplify the math. Consider a single neuron receiving inputs $x_1, x_2, ..., x_n$ with corresponding weights $w_1, w_2, ..., w_n$ and a bias $b$. The neuron's output, $z$, is calculated as:</p><p>$z = w_1x_1 + w_2x_2 + ... + w_nx_n + b = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} w_ix_i + b$</p><p>This is a weighted sum of inputs plus a bias. The bias acts as an offset, allowing the neuron to activate even when inputs are small.</p><p>Next, an , denoted as œÉ(z), is applied to introduce non-linearity. Common activation functions include sigmoid, ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit), and tanh. For example, the ReLU function is defined as:</p><p>This means the output is either 0 or the input itself, depending on whether the input is negative or positive. This simple non-linearity is crucial for the network's ability to learn complex patterns.</p><p>The output of one layer becomes the input for the next, and this process repeats until the output layer is reached. Let's illustrate with Python pseudo-code:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Forward propagation is the backbone of countless applications:</p><ul><li>  Classifying images of cats, dogs, or other objects.</li><li><strong>Natural Language Processing:</strong>  Understanding and generating human language, powering chatbots and machine translation.</li><li>  Object detection and path planning.</li><li>  Analyzing medical images to detect diseases.</li></ul><h3>\n  \n  \n  Challenges and Limitations\n</h3><ul><li>  Training deep neural networks can be computationally expensive, requiring powerful hardware (GPUs).</li><li>  The network might learn the training data too well and perform poorly on unseen data.</li><li> Understanding why a network makes a specific prediction can be challenging, raising ethical concerns in sensitive applications.</li></ul><h3>\n  \n  \n  The Future of Forward Propagation\n</h3><p>Forward propagation remains central to neural network research. Ongoing research focuses on:</p><ul><li><strong>More efficient algorithms:</strong>  Reducing computational costs and improving training speed.</li><li>  Designing networks that are more robust, accurate, and interpretable.</li><li><strong>New activation functions:</strong>  Exploring activation functions that enhance learning and generalization.</li></ul><p>In conclusion, forward propagation is the engine driving the power of neural networks. Understanding its mechanics‚Äîthe flow of data, the mathematical transformations, and the role of activation functions‚Äîis crucial for anyone seeking to master the art of machine learning. As research continues, forward propagation will undoubtedly play an even more critical role in shaping the future of artificial intelligence.</p>","contentLength":4290,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Links","url":"https://matklad.github.io/2025/08/23/links.html","date":1755907200,"author":"Alex Kladov","guid":237269,"unread":true,"content":"<p>If you have a blog, consider adding a ‚Äúlinks‚Äù page to it, which references resources that you find\nnotable:</p><p>I‚Äôve started my links page several years ago, mostly because I found myself referring to the same\nfew links repeatedly in various discussions, and not all the links were easily searchable.</p><p>Note that the suggestion is different from more typical ‚Äúmonthly links roundup‚Äù, which is nice to\nmaintain Substack engagement/community, but doesn‚Äôt contribute to long-term knowledge distilling.</p><p>It is also different from the exhaustive list of everything I‚Äôve read on the Internet.

In this article, we'll discuss adding Docker and Docker Compose for running components of our service in containers.</p><p>Containerization has become an essential tool for modern web development, and Docker is at the forefront of this revolution. When developing a Django-based web application like ours, using Docker ensures consistency across development and deployed environments. By leveraging Docker Compose, we can efficiently manage multiple services required by our application.</p><p>Docker Compose is a tool that allows you to define and manage multi-container Docker applications using a simple YAML file (docker-compose.yaml). It enables developers to run interconnected services, such as a web application, database, and message broker, with a single command. The  Docker Compose basic concepts include:</p><p><strong><em>Key Docker Compose Configuration Options</em></strong></p><ul><li><p> Defines the Compose file format version. In our case, we use \"3.9\", which is one of the latest stable versions.</p></li><li><p> Lists all the containers that make up the application. Each service runs in its own container.</p></li></ul><p><strong><em>Service Configuration Keys</em></strong></p><ul><li><p> Specifies the Docker image to use for the container. If the image is not found locally, Docker will pull it from a registry like Docker Hub.</p></li><li><p> Defines how to build the image from a Dockerfile. It usually includes:</p><ul><li>context: The directory containing the Dockerfile.</li><li>dockerfile: The path to the specific Dockerfile used to build the image.</li></ul></li><li><p> Gives a custom name to the container instead of a randomly generated one.</p></li><li><p> Overrides the default command specified in the Dockerfile, allowing you to run specific commands when the container starts.</p></li><li><p> Loads environment variables from an external .env file.</p></li><li><p> Maps ports between the container and the host.</p></li><li><p> Specifies service dependencies. A container will not start until its dependencies are up and running.</p></li></ul><p>Volumes store persistent data outside the container filesystem, ensuring data is not lost when containers are restarted or removed.</p><p>Let's review the components in our system, each of these will be a service in our docker-compose.yaml file.</p><ul><li>Django (Web Application) ‚Äì The core application running on Gunicorn or the Django development server</li><li>PostgreSQL (Database) ‚Äì Stores application data</li><li>Redis (Message Broker) ‚Äì Used by Celery for task queuing</li><li>Celery Worker ‚Äì Executes asynchronous tasks</li><li>Celery Beat ‚Äì Handles scheduled tasks</li><li>Celery Flower ‚Äì Provides a web UI for monitoring Celery tasks</li></ul><h2><strong>Our docker-compose.yaml file</strong></h2><div><pre><code>version: '3.9'\n\nservices:\n  django:\n    image: spokanetech-django:latest\n    container_name: django\n    env_file:\n      - .env.compose\n    build:\n      context: ../..\n      dockerfile: src/docker/Dockerfile\n    command: ./entrypoint.sh\n    ports:\n      - \"8080:8000\"\n    depends_on:\n      - db\n      - redis\n\n  db:\n    image: postgres:17\n    container_name: postgres_db\n    volumes:\n      - postgres_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data\n    ports:\n      - \"5432:5432\"\n    env_file:\n      - .env.compose\n\n  redis:\n    image: redis:7.2-alpine\n    container_name: redis\n    restart: unless-stopped\n    ports:\n      - \"6379:6379\"\n\n  worker:\n    image: spokanetech-django:latest\n    container_name: worker\n    env_file:\n      - .env.compose\n    build:\n      context: ../..\n      dockerfile: src/docker/Dockerfile\n    command: celery -A core worker -l info\n    depends_on:\n      - redis\n      - db\n\n  beat:\n    image: spokanetech-django:latest\n    container_name: beat\n    env_file:\n      - .env.compose\n    build:\n      context: ../..\n      dockerfile: src/docker/Dockerfile\n    command: celery -A core beat -l info --scheduler django_celery_beat.schedulers:DatabaseScheduler\n    depends_on:\n      - redis\n      - db\n\n  flower:\n    image: spokanetech-django:latest\n    container_name: flower\n    env_file:\n      - .env.compose\n    command: [\"celery\", \"-A\", \"core\", \"--config=flowerconfig.py\", \"flower\"]\n    ports:\n      - \"5555:5555\"\n    depends_on:\n      - redis\n      - db\n\nvolumes:\n  postgres_data:\n  static_volume:\n</code></pre></div><p>Docker Compose provides several commands to manage services.

HTTP/2 represents a significant leap forward from HTTP/1.x, particularly for applications handling thousands of concurrent connections. The protocol's design addresses many limitations that plagued earlier versions.</p><p>I've spent considerable time optimizing HTTP/2 implementations in production environments. The gains are substantial when you approach it correctly. Connection multiplexing alone can transform how your server handles load.</p><p>Let me walk through a practical implementation that demonstrates key optimization techniques. This code establishes a foundation for high-concurrency HTTP/2 servers in Go.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>The foundation starts with proper structure. We need components for connection management, server push capabilities, and performance tracking. Each plays a crucial role in achieving optimal performance.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Connection pooling proves essential for reducing overhead. Establishing new TLS connections remains expensive, so reusing existing connections dramatically improves efficiency.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Server push represents one of HTTP/2's most powerful features. When implemented correctly, it allows proactive resource delivery before clients even request them.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Tracking performance metrics helps identify bottlenecks. Without proper instrumentation, optimizing becomes guesswork rather than data-driven improvement.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Initializing the server requires careful configuration. Setting appropriate limits prevents resource exhaustion while maintaining high throughput.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>The request handling logic needs to account for protocol differences. HTTP/2 enables optimizations that simply aren't possible with earlier versions.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>HTTP/2-specific handling focuses on three main areas: header compression, server push opportunities, and stream prioritization. Each contributes to overall performance.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Server push implementation requires careful consideration. Pushing unnecessary resources can actually harm performance rather than help.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Stream prioritization allows more important requests to receive resources first. This proves particularly valuable under heavy load conditions.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Caching pushable resources ensures they're readily available when opportunities arise. The cache should be populated during server initialization.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Connection management forms the heart of HTTP/2 optimization. Smart pooling strategies prevent connection churn while maintaining performance.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Regular cleanup prevents memory leaks from accumulated idle connections. The cleanup frequency should balance resource usage with connection establishment costs.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Monitoring performance provides insights for further optimization. The metrics collected help identify patterns and potential improvements.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>The main function ties everything together. Proper TLS configuration is essential for HTTP/2, as most browsers require encrypted connections.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Connection multiplexing stands as HTTP/2's most significant advantage. Where HTTP/1.x required multiple connections for parallel requests, HTTP/2 handles everything over a single connection. This reduces TCP and TLS overhead substantially.</p><p>In practice, I've seen connection counts drop from six per client to just one. The resource savings compound quickly at scale. Memory usage decreases, CPU load reduces, and network efficiency improves.</p><p>Header compression using HPACK delivers impressive gains. Traditional HTTP headers often consumed 2KB or more per request. HPACK typically reduces this to under 200 bytes. The savings become enormous at high request volumes.</p><p>The compression works through static and dynamic tables. Common headers get referenced from tables rather than retransmitted. Huffman encoding further reduces size for variable values.</p><p>Server push requires thoughtful implementation. The feature allows sending responses before clients request them. For critical resources like CSS or JavaScript, this can eliminate round trips.</p><p>But push too much, and you waste bandwidth. Push the wrong things, and you hinder performance. I typically push only resources with high certainty of being needed.</p><p>Stream prioritization enables quality of service controls. Important requests can receive preferential treatment during resource contention. The protocol supports complex dependency trees and weight-based allocation.</p><p>In real applications, I prioritize user-interactive requests over background tasks. API calls affecting user experience get resources before analytics pings or prefetch requests.</p><p>Connection management deserves particular attention. HTTP/2 connections are valuable resources. Pooling and reuse prevent expensive renegotiation of TLS sessions.</p><p>I implement aggressive connection reuse where appropriate. The pool maintains connections to various endpoints, ready for immediate use. Cleanup routines remove idle connections to conserve resources.</p><p>Performance monitoring provides crucial insights. Without metrics, optimization efforts operate blindly. I track active streams, pushed resources, header savings, and connection reuse rates.</p><p>These metrics help identify bottlenecks. If active streams consistently hit limits, perhaps the maximum needs adjustment. If push failures increase, maybe the strategy requires revision.</p><p>Flow control tuning affects overall throughput. HTTP/2 includes window-based flow control at both connection and stream levels. Proper tuning prevents starvation while maintaining fairness.</p><p>I typically start with conservative window sizes and adjust based on observed performance. The optimal values depend on network characteristics and application behavior.</p><p>Error handling requires special consideration in HTTP/2. The protocol includes various error codes and reset mechanisms. Proper handling maintains stability during network issues or client problems.</p><p>I implement comprehensive logging for stream resets and connection errors. This helps identify patterns and address underlying issues.</p><p>Protocol upgrade handling maintains compatibility. While HTTP/2 excels, not all clients support it. The server should gracefully handle HTTP/1.x connections when necessary.</p><p>In my implementation, I check the protocol version and handle appropriately. This ensures broad compatibility while providing modern features where available.</p><p>TLS configuration significantly impacts performance. HTTP/2 requires specific cipher suites and protocol versions. Modern, efficient settings improve both security and speed.</p><p>I prefer TLS 1.3 where possible for improved performance. The reduced handshake latency benefits HTTP/2's connection reuse model.</p><p>Resource management prevents denial of service attacks. HTTP/2's multiplexing capability means a single connection can make many requests. Limits prevent resource exhaustion.</p><p>I set reasonable limits on concurrent streams and request rates. These protect the server while still allowing high performance for legitimate traffic.</p><p>The implementation demonstrates practical application of HTTP/2 features. The code provides a foundation that can be extended for specific use cases. Each component addresses particular aspects of protocol optimization.</p><p>Through careful implementation and continuous refinement, HTTP/2 can deliver substantial performance improvements. The protocol represents a meaningful step forward in web technology.</p><p>The approach reduces latency while increasing throughput. Connection multiplexing cuts resource usage significantly for high-concurrency workloads. Header compression reduces bandwidth requirements. Server push eliminates round trips for critical resources.</p><p>These improvements combine to create faster, more efficient web services. The benefits become increasingly valuable as applications scale to handle more users and traffic.</p><p>Proper HTTP/2 implementation requires understanding both the protocol specifics and the practical considerations of production deployment. The technical capabilities must be balanced with operational requirements.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  The result is systems that handle more traffic with fewer resources while providing better user experiences.

Amazon Bedrock provides a way to host and invoke models as well as integrate the AI models with surrounding infrastructure, which we elaborate on in this post.</p><h2>Combining GIS and AI through RAG and agentic workflows</h2><p>LLMs are trained with large amounts of generalized information to discover patterns in how language is produced. To improve the performance of LLMs for specific use cases, approaches such as RAG and agentic workflows have been created. Retrieving policies and general knowledge for geospatial use cases can be accomplished with RAG, whereas calculating and analyzing GIS data would require an agentic workflow. In this section, we expand upon both RAG and agentic workflows in the context of geospatial use cases.</p><h3>Retrieval Augmented Generation</h3><p>With RAG, you can dynamically inject contextual information from a knowledge base during model invocation.</p><p>RAG supplements a user-provided prompt with data sourced from a knowledge base (collection of documents). Amazon Bedrock offers managed knowledge bases to data sources, such as <a href=\"http://aws.amazon.com/s3\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Amazon Simple Storage Service</a> (Amazon S3) and SharePoint, so you can provide supplemental information, such as city development plans, intelligence reports, or policies and regulations, when your AI assistant is generating a response for a user.</p><p>Knowledge bases are ideal for unstructured documents with information stored in natural language. When your AI model responds to a user with information sourced from RAG, it can provide references and citations to its source material. The following diagram shows how the systems connect together.</p><p>Because geospatial data is often structured and in a GIS, you can connect the GIS to the LLM using tools and agents instead of knowledge bases.</p><h3>Tools and agents (to control a UI and a system)</h3><p>Many LLMs, such as <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/claude/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Anthropic‚Äôs Claude</a> on Amazon Bedrock, make it possible to provide a description of tools available so your AI model can generate text to invoke external processes. These processes might retrieve live information, such as the current weather in a location or querying a structured data store, or might control external systems, such as starting a workflow or adding layers to a map. Some common geospatial functionality that you might want to integrate with your LLM using tools include:</p><ul><li>Performing mathematical calculations like the distance between coordinates, filtering datasets based on numeric values, or calculating derived fields</li><li>Deriving information from predictive analysis models</li><li>Looking up points of interest in structured data stores</li><li>Searching content and metadata in unstructured data stores</li><li>Retrieving real-time geospatial data, like traffic, directions, or estimated time to reach a destination</li><li>Visualizing distances, points of interest, or paths</li><li>Submitting work outputs such as analytic reports</li><li>Starting workflows, like ordering supplies or adjusting supply chain</li></ul><p>Tools are often implemented in <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">AWS Lambda</a> functions. Lambda runs code without the complexity and overhead of running servers. It handles the infrastructure management, enabling faster development, improved performance, enhanced security, and cost-efficiency.</p><p>Amazon Bedrock offers the feature <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/agents/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Amazon Bedrock Agents</a> to simplify the orchestration and integration with your geospatial tools. Amazon Bedrock agents follow instructions for LLM reasoning to break down a user prompt into smaller tasks and perform actions against identified tasks from action providers. The following diagram illustrates how Amazon Bedrock Agents works.</p><p>The following diagram shows how Amazon Bedrock Agents can enhance GIS solutions.</p><p>The following demonstration applies the concepts we‚Äôve discussed to an earthquake analysis agent as an example. This example deploys an Amazon Bedrock agent with a knowledge base based on <a href=\"http://aws.amazon.com/redshift\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Amazon Redshift</a>. The Redshift instance has two tables. One table is for earthquakes, which includes date, magnitude, latitude, and longitude. The second table holds the counites in California, described as polygon shapes. The geospatial capabilities of Amazon Redshift can relate these datasets to answer queries like which county had the most recent earthquake or which county has had the most earthquakes in the last 20 years. The Amazon Bedrock agent can generate these geospatially based queries based on natural language.</p><p>This script creates an end-to-end pipeline that performs the following steps:</p><ol><li>Processes geospatial data.</li><li>Sets up cloud infrastructure.</li><li>Loads and configures the spatial database.</li><li>Creates an AI agent for spatial analysis.</li></ol><p>In the following sections, we create this agent and test it out.</p><p>To implement this approach, you must have an AWS account with the appropriate <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/iam/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">AWS Identity and Access Management</a> (IAM) permissions for Amazon Bedrock, Amazon Redshift, and Amazon S3.</p><ol><li>Confirm you have access to the latest version of the AWS CLI.</li><li><a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/signin/latest/userguide/command-line-sign-in.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Sign in</a> to the AWS CLI with your credentials.</li><li>Make sure ./jq is installed.

In this blog post we present a systematic evaluation methodology for <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Amazon Bedrock</a> users, combining theoretical frameworks with practical implementation strategies that empower data scientists and machine learning (ML) engineers to make optimal model selections.</p><h2>The challenge of foundation model selection</h2><p><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Amazon Bedrock</a> is a fully managed service that offers a choice of high-performing foundation models from leading AI companies such as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/ai21/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">AI21 Labs</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/anthropic\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Anthropic</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/cohere/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Cohere</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/deepseek\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">DeepSeek</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/luma-ai/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Luma</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/llama/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Meta</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/mistral/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Mistral AI</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/poolside/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">poolside&nbsp;</a>(coming soon),&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/stability-ai/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Stability AI</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/twelvelabs/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">TwelveLabs</a>&nbsp;(coming soon),&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/writer\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Writer</a>, and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/ai/generative-ai/nova/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Amazon&nbsp;</a>through a single API, along with a broad set of capabilities you need to build generative AI applications with security, privacy, and responsible AI. The service‚Äôs API-driven approach allows seamless model interchangeability, but this flexibility introduces a critical challenge: which model will deliver optimal performance for a specific application while meeting operational constraints?</p><p>Our research with enterprise customers reveals that many early generative AI projects select models based on either limited manual testing or reputation, rather than systematic evaluation against business requirements. This approach frequently results in:</p><ul><li>Over-provisioning computational resources to accommodate larger models than required</li><li>Sub-optimal performance because of misalignment between model strengths and use case requirements</li><li>Unnecessarily high operational costs because of inefficient token utilization</li><li>Production performance issues discovered too late in the development lifecycle</li></ul><h2>A multidimensional evaluation framework‚ÄîFoundation model capability matrix</h2><p>Foundation models vary significantly across multiple dimensions, with performance characteristics that interact in complex ways. Our capability matrix provides a structured view of critical dimensions to consider when <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/amazon-bedrock-model-evaluation-is-now-generally-available/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">evaluating models</a> in Amazon Bedrock. Below are four core dimensions (in no specific order) ‚Äì Task performance, Architectural characteristics, Operational considerations, and Responsible AI attributes.</p><p>Evaluating the models based on the task performance is crucial for achieving direct impact on business outcomes, ROI, user adoption and trust, and competitive advantage.</p><ul><li>: Evaluate models using benchmarks relevant to your use case (MMLU, HELM, or domain-specific benchmarks).</li><li><strong>Few-shot learning capabilities</strong>: Strong few-shot performers require minimal examples to adapt to new tasks, leading to cost efficiency, faster time-to-market, resource optimization, and operational benefits.</li><li><strong>Instruction following fidelity</strong>: For the applications that require precise adherence to commands and constraints, it is critical to evaluate model‚Äôs instruction following fidelity.</li><li>: Reliability and reproducibility across multiple runs with identical prompts.</li><li><strong>Domain-specific knowledge</strong>: Model performance varies dramatically across specialized fields based on training data. Evaluate the models base on your domain-specific use-case scenarios.</li><li>Evaluate the model‚Äôs ability to perform logical inference, causal reasoning, and multi-step problem-solving. This can include reasoning such as deductive and inductive, mathematical, chain-of-thought, and so on.</li></ul><h3><strong>Architectural characteristics</strong></h3><p>Architectural characteristics for evaluating the models are important as they directly impact the model‚Äôs performance, efficiency, and suitability for specific tasks.</p><ul><li><strong>Parameter count (model size)</strong>: Larger models typically offer more capabilities but require greater computational resources and may have higher inference costs and latency.</li><li><strong>Training data composition</strong>: Models trained on diverse, high-quality datasets tend to have better generalization abilities across different domains.</li><li>: Decoder-only models excel at text generation, encoder-decoder architectures handle translation and summarization more effectively, while mixture of experts (MoE) architectures can be a powerful tool for improving the performance of both decoder-only and encoder-decoder models. Some specialized architectures focus on enhancing reasoning capabilities through techniques like chain-of-thought prompting or recursive reasoning.</li><li>: The way models process text affects performance on domain-specific tasks, particularly with specialized vocabulary.</li><li><strong>Context window capabilities</strong>: Larger context windows enable processing more information at once, critical for document analysis and extended conversations.</li><li>: Modality refers to type of data a model can process and generate, such as text, image, audio, or video. Consider the modality of the models depending on the use case, and choose the model optimized for that specific modality.</li></ul><h3><strong>Operational considerations</strong></h3><p>Below listed operational considerations are critical for model selection as they directly impact the real-world feasibility, cost-effectiveness, and sustainability of AI deployments.</p><ul><li><strong>Throughput and latency profiles</strong>: Response speed impacts user experience and throughput determines scalability.</li><li>: Input/output token pricing significantly affects economics at scale.</li><li><strong>Scalability characteristics</strong>: Ability to handle concurrent requests and maintain performance during traffic spikes.</li><li>: Fine-tuning capabilities and adaptation methods for tailoring to specific use cases or domains.</li><li>: Ease of integration into existing systems and workflow is an important consideration.</li><li>: When dealing with sensitive data, model security‚Äîincluding data encryption, access control, and vulnerability management‚Äîis a crucial consideration.</li></ul><h3><strong>Responsible AI attributes</strong></h3><p>As AI becomes increasingly embedded in business operations and daily lives, evaluating models on responsible AI attributes isn‚Äôt just a technical consideration‚Äîit‚Äôs a business imperative.</p><ul><li>: Models vary in their tendency to generate plausible but incorrect information.</li><li>: Performance across different demographic groups affects fairness and equity.</li><li><strong>Safety guardrail effectiveness</strong>: Resistance to generating harmful or inappropriate content.</li><li><strong>Explainability and privacy</strong>: Transparency features and handling of sensitive information.</li><li>: Legal considerations should include data privacy, non-discrimination, intellectual property, and product liability.</li></ul><h2>Agentic AI considerations for model selection</h2><p>The growing popularity of agentic AI applications introduces evaluation dimensions beyond traditional metrics. When assessing models for use in autonomous agents, consider these critical capabilities:</p><p><strong>Agent-specific evaluation dimensions</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Planning and reasoning capabilities</strong>: Evaluate chain-of-thought consistency across complex multi-step tasks and self-correction mechanisms that allow agents to identify and fix their own reasoning errors.</li><li>: Test function calling capabilities, parameter handling precision, and structured output consistency (JSON/XML) for seamless tool use.</li><li><strong>Agent-to-agent communication</strong>: Assess protocol adherence to frameworks like A2A and efficient contextual memory management across extended multi-agent interactions.</li></ul><p><strong>Multi-agent collaboration testing</strong> for applications using multiple specialized agents</p><ul><li>: Measure how well models maintain distinct agent personas and responsibilities without role confusion.</li><li><strong>Information sharing efficiency</strong>: Test how effectively information flows between agent instances without critical detail loss.</li><li><strong>Collaborative intelligence</strong>: Verify whether multiple agents working together produce better outcomes than single-model approaches.</li><li><strong>Error propagation resistance</strong>: Assess how robustly multi-agent systems contain and correct errors rather than amplifying them.</li></ul><h2>A four-phase evaluation methodology</h2><p>Our recommended methodology progressively narrows model selection through increasingly sophisticated assessment techniques:</p><h3>Phase 1: Requirements engineering</h3><p>Begin with a precise specification of your application‚Äôs requirements:</p><ul><li>: Define primary tasks, domain knowledge needs, language support, output formats, and reasoning complexity.</li><li><strong>Non-functional requirements</strong>: Specify latency thresholds, throughput requirements, budget constraints, context window needs, and availability expectations.</li><li><strong>Responsible AI requirements</strong>: Establish hallucination tolerance, bias mitigation needs, safety requirements, explainability level, and privacy constraints.</li><li><strong>Agent-specific requirements</strong>: For agentic applications, define tool-use capabilities, protocol adherence standards, and collaboration requirements.</li></ul><p>Assign weights to each requirement based on business priorities to create your evaluation scorecard foundation.</p><h3>Phase 2: Candidate model selection</h3><p>Use the Amazon Bedrock model information <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/APIReference/API_ListFoundationModels.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">API</a> to filter models based on hard requirements. This typically reduces candidates from dozens to 3‚Äì7 models that are worth detailed evaluation.</p><p>Filter options include but aren‚Äôt limited to the following:</p><ul><li>Filter by modality support, context length, and language capabilities</li><li>Exclude models that don‚Äôt meet minimum performance thresholds</li><li>Calculate theoretical costs at projected scale so that you can exclude options that exceed the available budget</li><li>Filter for customization requirements such as fine-tuning capabilities</li><li>For agentic applications, filter for function calling and multi-agent protocol support</li></ul><p>Although the Amazon Bedrock model information API might not provide the filters you need for candidate selection, you can use the Amazon Bedrock model catalog (shown in the following figure) to obtain additional information about these models.</p><h3>Phase 3: Systematic performance evaluation</h3><ol><li><strong>Prepare evaluation datasets</strong>: Create representative task examples, challenging edge cases, domain-specific content, and adversarial examples.</li><li><strong>Design evaluation prompts</strong>: Standardize instruction format, maintain consistent examples, and mirror production usage patterns.</li><li>: Select appropriate metrics for subjective tasks (human evaluation and reference-free quality), objective tasks (precision, recall, and F1 score), and reasoning tasks (logical consistency and step validity).</li><li>: Add protocol conformance testing, multi-step planning assessment, and tool-use evaluation.</li><li>: Maintain consistent parameters across models and collect comprehensive performance data.</li><li><strong>Measure operational performance</strong>: Capture throughput, latency distributions, error rates, and actual token consumption costs.</li></ol><h3>Phase 4: Decision analysis</h3><p>Transform evaluation data into actionable insights:</p><ol><li>: Scale all metrics to comparable units using min-max normalization.</li><li>: Calculate composite scores based on your prioritized requirements.</li><li><strong>Perform sensitivity analysis</strong>: Test how robust your conclusions are against weight variations.</li><li>: Create radar charts, efficiency frontiers, and tradeoff curves for clear comparison.</li><li>: Detail each model‚Äôs strengths, limitations, and optimal use cases.</li></ol><h2>Advanced evaluation techniques</h2><p>Beyond standard procedures, consider the following approaches for evaluating models.</p><h3>A/B testing with production traffic</h3><p>Implement comparative testing using <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/intelligent-prompt-routing/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Amazon Bedrock‚Äôs routing</a> capabilities to gather real-world performance data from actual users.</p><p>Test model vulnerabilities through prompt injection attempts, challenging syntax, edge case handling, and domain-specific factual challenges.</p><h3>Multi-model ensemble evaluation</h3><p>Assess combinations such as sequential pipelines, voting ensembles, and cost-efficient routing based on task complexity.</p><h3>Continuous evaluation architecture</h3><p>Design systems to monitor production performance with:</p><ul><li>Stratified sampling of production traffic across task types and domains</li><li>Regular evaluations and trigger-based reassessments when new models emerge</li><li>Performance thresholds and alerts for quality degradation</li><li>User feedback collection and failure case repositories for continuous improvement</li></ul><h3>Industry-specific considerations</h3><p>Different sectors have unique requirements that influence model selection:</p><ul><li>: Regulatory compliance, numerical precision, and personally identifiable information (PII) handling capabilities</li><li>: Medical terminology understanding, HIPAA adherence, and clinical reasoning</li><li>: Technical specification comprehension, procedural knowledge, and spatial reasoning</li><li>: Autonomous reasoning, tool integration, and protocol conformance</li></ul><h2>Best practices for model selection</h2><p>Through this comprehensive approach to model evaluation and selection, organizations can make informed decisions that balance performance, cost, and operational requirements while maintaining alignment with business objectives. The methodology makes sure that model selection isn‚Äôt a one-time exercise but an evolving process that adapts to changing needs and technological capabilities.</p><ul><li><strong>Assess your situation thoroughly</strong>: Understand your specific use case requirements and available resources</li><li><strong>Select meaningful metrics</strong>: Focus on metrics that directly relate to your business objectives</li><li><strong>Build for continuous evaluation</strong>: Design your evaluation process to be repeatable as new models are released</li></ul><h2>Looking forward: The future of model selection</h2><p>As foundation models evolve, evaluation methodologies must keep pace. Below are further considerations (By no means this list of considerations is exhaustive and is subject to ongoing updates as technology evolves and best practices emerge), you should take into account while selecting the best model(s) for your use-case(s).</p><ul><li><strong>Multi-model architectures</strong>: Enterprises will increasingly deploy specialized models in concert rather than relying on single models for all tasks.</li><li>: Evaluation frameworks must assess how models perform as autonomous agents with tool-use capabilities and inter-agent collaboration.</li><li>: The growing landscape of domain-specific models will require more nuanced evaluation of specialized capabilities.</li><li>: As models become more capable, evaluation of controllability and alignment with human intent becomes increasingly important.</li></ul><p>By implementing a comprehensive evaluation framework that extends beyond basic metrics, organizations can informed decisions about which foundation models will best serve their requirements. For agentic AI applications in particular, thorough evaluation of reasoning, planning, and collaboration capabilities is essential for success. By approaching model selection systematically, organizations can avoid the common pitfalls of over-provisioning, misalignment with use case needs, excessive operational costs, and late discovery of performance issues. The investment in thorough evaluation pays dividends through optimized costs, improved performance, and superior user experiences.</p><p> is a Senior Generative AI Data Scientist at Amazon Web Services, helping businesses innovate with generative AI.

Despite the critical role these documents play, an <a href=\"https://mitsloan.mit.edu/ideas-made-to-matter/tapping-power-unstructured-data\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">estimated 80‚Äì90%</a> of the data they contain is unstructured and largely untapped, hiding valuable insights that could transform business outcomes. Despite advances in technology, many organizations still rely on manual data entry, spending countless hours extracting information from PDFs, scanned images, and forms. This manual approach is time-consuming, error-prone, and prevents organizations from scaling their operations and responding quickly to business demands.</p><p>Although generative AI has made it easier to build proof-of-concept document processing solutions, the journey from proof of concept to production remains fraught with challenges. Organizations often find themselves rebuilding from scratch when they discover their prototype can‚Äôt handle production volumes, lacks proper error handling, doesn‚Äôt scale cost-effectively, or fails to meet enterprise security and compliance requirements.

Automated document processing workflows accurately extract structured information from documents, reducing manual effort. We will show you how this ready-to-deploy solution can help you build those workflows with generative AI on AWS in days instead of months.</p><h2>Understanding intelligent document processing</h2><p>Intelligent document processing (IDP) encompasses the technologies and techniques used to extract and process data from various document types. Common IDP tasks include:</p><ul><li><strong>OCR (Optical Character Recognition)</strong> ‚Äì Converting scanned documents and images into machine-readable text</li><li> ‚Äì Automatically identifying document types (such as invoices, contracts, or forms)</li><li> ‚Äì Pulling structured information from unstructured documents</li><li> ‚Äì Evaluating the quality and confidence of extracted data</li><li> ‚Äì Creating concise summaries of document content</li><li> ‚Äì Measuring accuracy and performance against expected outcomes</li></ul><p>These capabilities are critical across industries. In financial services, organizations use IDP to process loan applications, extract data from bank statements, and validate insurance claims. Healthcare providers rely on IDP to extract patient information from medical records, process insurance forms, and handle lab results efficiently. Manufacturing and logistics companies use IDP to process invoices and purchase orders, extract shipping information, and handle quality certificates. Government agencies use IDP to process citizen applications, extract data from tax forms, manage permits and licenses, and enforce regulatory compliance.</p><h2>The generative AI revolution in IDP</h2><p>Traditional IDP solutions relied on template-based extraction, regular expressions, and classical machine learning (ML) models. Though functional, these approaches required extensive setup, struggled with document variations, and achieved limited accuracy on complex documents.</p><p>The emergence of large language models (LLMs) and generative AI has fundamentally transformed IDP capabilities. Modern AI models can understand document context, handle variations without templates, achieve near-human accuracy on complex extractions, and adapt to new document types with minimal examples. This shift from rule-based to intelligence-based processing means organizations can now process different document types with high accuracy, dramatically reducing the time and cost of implementation.</p><p>We‚Äôre excited to share the <a href=\"https://github.com/aws-solutions-library-samples/accelerated-intelligent-document-processing-on-aws/blob/main/README.md\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">GenAI IDP Accelerator</a>‚Äîan open source solution that transforms how organizations handle document processing by dramatically reducing manual effort and improving accuracy.

SageMaker HyperPod removes the undifferentiated heavy lifting involved in building and optimizing machine learning (ML) infrastructure for training FMs, reducing training time by up to 40%.</p><p>SageMaker HyperPod offers persistent clusters with built-in resiliency, while also offering deep infrastructure control by allowing users to SSH into the underlying <a href=\"http://aws.amazon.com/ec2\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud</a> (Amazon EC2) instances. It helps efficiently scale model development and deployment tasks such as training, fine-tuning, or inference across a cluster of hundreds or thousands of AI accelerators, while reducing the operational heavy lifting involved in managing such clusters. As AI moves towards deployment adopting to a multitude of domains and use cases, the need for flexibility and control is becoming more pertinent. Large enterprises want to make sure the GPU clusters follow the organization-wide policies and security rules. Mission-critical AI/ML workloads often require specialized environments that align with the organization‚Äôs software stack and operational standards.</p><p>SageMaker HyperPod supports <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/eks/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service</a> (Amazon EKS) and offers two new features that enhance this control and flexibility to enable production deployment of large-scale ML workloads:</p><ul><li> ‚Äì SageMaker HyperPod now supports continuous provisioning, which enhances cluster scalability through features like partial provisioning, rolling updates, concurrent scaling operations, and continuous retries when launching and configuring your HyperPod cluster.</li><li>‚Äì You can now use custom <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/AMIs.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Amazon Machine Images</a> (AMIs), which enables the preconfiguration of software stacks, security agents, and proprietary dependencies that would otherwise require complex post-launch bootstrapping. Customers can create custom AMIs using the HyperPod public AMI as a base and install additional software required to meet their organization‚Äôs specific security and compliance requirements.</li></ul><p>In this post, we dive deeper into each of these features.</p><p>The new continuous provisioning feature in SageMaker HyperPod represents a transformative advancement for organizations running intensive ML workloads, delivering unprecedented flexibility and operational efficiency that accelerates AI innovation. This feature provides the following benefits:</p><ul><li> ‚Äì SageMaker HyperPod prioritizes delivering the maximum possible number of instances without failure. You can start running your workload while your cluster will attempt to provision the remaining instances.</li><li> ‚Äì SageMaker HyperPod supports simultaneous scaling and maintenance activities (such as scale up, scale down, and patching) on a single instance group waiting for previous operations to complete.</li><li> ‚Äì SageMaker HyperPod persistently attempts to fulfill the user‚Äôs request until it encounters a  error from where recovery is not possible.</li><li><strong>Increased customer visibility</strong> ‚Äì SageMaker HyperPod maps customer-initiated and service-initiated operations to structured activity streams, providing real-time status updates and detailed progress tracking.</li></ul><p>For ML teams facing tight deadlines and resource constraints, this means dramatically reduced wait times and the ability to begin model training and deployment with whatever computing power is immediately available, while the system works diligently in the background to provision remaining requested resources.</p><h3>Implement continuous provisioning in a SageMaker HyperPod cluster</h3><p>The architecture introduces an intuitive yet powerful parameter that puts scaling strategy control directly in your hands: .

The LabEx 'Data Science' path is designed precisely for this, offering a structured roadmap through hands-on, interactive lessons. Forget passive video lectures; here, you learn by doing, mastering essential concepts from statistical analysis to machine learning and data visualization. Let's explore a few beginner-friendly experiments that will kickstart your transformation from novice to data wizard.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Automatic Registration of Subclasses\n</h2><p> Beginner |  5 minutes</p><p>In this challenge, we will implement a class called Base that will automatically record any subclasses that inherit from it. The purpose of this implementation is to enable the retrieval of all subclass names by iterating over Base. The goal is to demonstrate the functionality of Base by showing that it correctly registers and outputs the names of the subclasses. We will accomplish this by implementing the  method in the Base class and ensuring that it supports iteration.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Implementing Column Permutation Encryption in Python\n</h2><p> Beginner |  5 minutes</p><p>In this challenge, we will be implementing the Column Permutation Encryption method. This method involves encrypting a plaintext by writing it down line by line with a fixed number of characters per line, and then rearranging the columns of the resulting matrix according to the alphabetical order of a key. The rearranged columns are then read out one by one to obtain the ciphertext. The objective of the challenge is to complete the column_permutation_encryption(text) function in the given file, which takes a piece of text as input, performs column permutation encryption using the key qiao and the padding character ,, and returns the ciphertext. If the input text is empty, None should be returned.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Implementing Affine Encryption in Python\n</h2><p> Beginner |  5 minutes</p><p>In this challenge, we will implement the Affine encryption algorithm. The Affine cipher is a substitution cipher that combines the characteristics of the shift cipher and the multiplier cipher. It uses a cryptographic function to encrypt one letter per letter based on a mathematical formula. The objective is to complete the implementation of the affine_encryption(text) function in the affine.py file, which takes a piece of text as input, encrypts it using the Affine cipher, and returns the ciphertext.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Count Each Type Characters\n</h2><p> Beginner |  5 minutes</p><p>In this challenge, we will count the number of letters, spaces, digits, and other characters in a given input. The objective is to correctly categorize and count each type of character. For example, given the input 'abc123EFG *&amp;45?', the expected output would be 'letter=6,space=1,digit=5,other=3'.</p><p>These beginner-friendly challenges are just the beginning of your data science adventure. Each one is designed to build foundational skills, from understanding object-oriented principles to mastering data manipulation and even delving into the fascinating world of cryptography.

Key benefits include enhanced , as sensitive information remains entirely within your own infrastructure, and , enabling uninterrupted work even without internet access. While cloud-based LLM services are convenient, running models locally gives you full control over model behavior, performance tuning, and potential cost savings. This make them ideal for experimentation before running production workloads.</p><p>The ecosystem for local LLMs has matured significantly, with several excellent options available, such as <a href=\"https://ollama.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Ollama</a>, <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-foundry/foundry-local/get-started\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Foundry Local</a>, <a href=\"https://docs.docker.com/ai/model-runner/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Docker Model Runner</a>, and more. Most popular AI/Agent frameworks including <a href=\"https://python.langchain.com/docs/how_to/local_llms/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">LangChain</a> and <a href=\"https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/tutorials/rag/langgraph_self_rag_local\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">LangGraph</a> provide integration with these local model runners, making it easier to integrate them into your projects.</p><p>This blog post will illustrate how to use local LLMs with <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/gen-ai/why-cosmos-ai\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Azure Cosmos DB as a vector database</a> for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) scenarios. It will guide you through setting up a local LLM solution, configuring Azure Cosmos DB, loading data, performing vector searches, and executing RAG queries. You can either use the <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/emulator\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Azure Cosmos DB emulator</a> for local development or connecting to an Azure Cosmos DB account in the cloud. You will be using Ollama (open-source solution) to run LLMs locally on your own machine. It lets you download, run, and interact with a variety of LLMs (like Llama 3, Mistral, and others) using simple commands, without needing cloud access or complex setup.</p><p>By the end of this blog post, you will have a working local RAG setup that leverages Ollama and Azure Cosmos DB. the sample app uses <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/gen-ai/integrations?context=%2Fazure%2Fcosmos-db%2Fnosql%2Fcontext%2Fcontext\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">LangChain integration with Azure Cosmos DB</a> to perform embedding, data loading, and vector search. You can easily adapt it to other frameworks like LlamaIndex.</p><p>To get started with Ollama, follow the <a href=\"https://github.com/ollama/ollama?tab=readme-ov-file#ollama\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">official installation guide</a> on GitHub to install it on your system. The installation process is straightforward across different platforms. For example, on Linux systems, you can install Ollama with a single command:</p><div><pre><code>curl  https://ollama.com/install.sh | sh\n</code></pre></div><p>Once installed, start the Ollama service by running:</p><p>This blog post demonstrates the integration using two specific models from the Ollama library:</p><ul><li> - A high-quality embedding model with 1024 dimensions, ideal for generating vector representations of text</li><li> - The 8B parameter variant of Meta's Llama 3, which serves as our chat model for the RAG pipeline</li></ul><p>Download both models using the following commands. Note that this process may take several minutes depending on your internet connection speed, as these are substantial model files:</p><div><pre><code>ollama pull mxbai-embed-large\nollama pull llama3:8b\n</code></pre></div><h3>\n  \n  \n  Something to keep in mind ...\n</h3><p>While tools like Ollama make it straightforward to run local LLMs, hardware requirements depend on the specific model and your performance expectations. Lightweight models (such as Llama 2 7B or Phi-2) can run on modern CPUs with as little as 8 GB RAM, though performance may be limited. Larger models (like Llama 3 70B or Mixtral) typically require a dedicated GPU with at least 16 GB VRAM for efficient inference. </p><p>Ollama supports both CPU and GPU execution. On CPU-only systems, you can expect slower response times, especially with larger models or concurrent requests. Using a compatible GPU significantly accelerates inference required for demanding workloads.</p><p>Since you're working with local models, you'll likely want to use the Azure Cosmos DB emulator for local development. The emulator provides a local environment that mimics the Azure Cosmos DB service, enabling you to develop and test your applications without incurring costs or requiring an internet connection.</p><p>The emulator is available as a Docker container, which is the recommended way to run it. Here are the steps to pull and start the Cosmos DB emulator. The commands shown are for Linux - <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/how-to-develop-emulator?tabs=docker-linux%2Ccsharp&amp;pivots=api-nosql#start-the-emulator\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">refer to the documentation</a> for other platform options.</p><div><pre><code>docker pull mcr.microsoft.com/cosmosdb/linux/azure-cosmos-emulator:latest\n\ndocker run  8081:8081 1 mcr.microsoft.com/cosmosdb/linux/azure-cosmos-emulator:latest\n</code></pre></div><div><pre><code>curl  https://localhost:8081/_explorer/emulator.pem  ~/emulatorcert.crt\nupdate-ca-certificates\n</code></pre></div><p>You should see output similar to this:</p><div><pre><code>Updating certificates in /etc/ssl/certs...\nrehash: warning: skipping ca-certificates.crt,it does not contain exactly one certificate or CRL\n1 added, 0 removed; done.\nRunning hooks in /etc/ca-certificates/update.d...\ndone.\n</code></pre></div><h2>\n  \n  \n  Load data into Azure Cosmos DB\n</h2><p>Now that both Ollama and Azure Cosmos DB are set up, it's time to populate our vector database with some sample data. For this demonstration, we'll use Azure Cosmos DB's own documentation as our data source. The loader will fetch markdown content directly from the Microsoft Docs repository, specifically focusing on articles about Azure Cosmos DB <a href=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MicrosoftDocs/azure-databases-docs/refs/heads/main/articles/cosmos-db/nosql/vector-search.md\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">vector search</a> functionality.</p><p>Our data loading process will read these documentation articles, generate embeddings using the  model, and store both the content and vector representations in Azure Cosmos DB for retrieval.</p><p>Begin by cloning the GitHub repository containing the sample application:</p><div><pre><code>git clone https://github.com/abhirockzz/local-llms-rag-cosmosdb\nlocal-llms-rag-cosmosdb\n</code></pre></div><p>Before running the loader application, ensure you have Python 3 installed on your system. Create a virtual environment and install the required dependencies:</p><div><pre><code>python3  venv .venv\n .venv/bin/activate\n\npip3  requirements.txt\n</code></pre></div><p>Next, configure the environment variables and execute the loading script. The example below uses the Azure Cosmos DB emulator for local development. If you prefer to use the cloud service instead, simply set the  variable to your Azure Cosmos DB account URL and remove the  variable.</p><div><pre><code>\n\npython3 load_data.py\n</code></pre></div><p>The script will automatically create the database and container if they don't already exist. Once the data loading process completes successfully, you should see output similar to this:</p><div><pre><code>Uploading documents to Azure Cosmos DB ['https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MicrosoftDocs/azure-databases-docs/refs/heads/main/articles/cosmos-db/nosql/vector-search.md', 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MicrosoftDocs/azure-databases-docs/refs/heads/main/articles/cosmos-db/nosql/multi-tenancy-vector-search.md']\nUsing database: rag_local_llm_db, container: docs\nUsing embedding model: mxbai-embed-large with dimensions: 1024\nCreated instance of AzureCosmosDBNoSqlVectorSearch\nLoading 26 document chunks from 2 documents\nData loaded into Azure Cosmos DB\n</code></pre></div><p>To confirm that your data has been loaded successfully, you can inspect the results using the Azure Cosmos DB Data Explorer. If you're using the emulator, navigate to <code>https://localhost:8081/_explorer/index.html</code> in your browser. You should see the same number of documents in your container as the number of chunks reported by the loader application.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Run vector search queries\n</h2><p>Now that your data is loaded, let's test the vector search functionality. Set the same environment variables used for data loading and run the vector search script with your desired query:</p><div><pre><code>\n\npython3 vector_search.py </code></pre></div><p>The script will process your query through the embedding model and perform a similarity search against the stored document vectors. You should see output similar to the following:</p><div><pre><code>Searching top 5 results for query: \"show me an example of a vector embedding policy\"\n\nUsing database: rag_local_llm_db, container: docs\nUsing embedding model: mxbai-embed-large with dimensions: 1024\nCreated instance of AzureCosmosDBNoSqlVectorSearch\nScore: 0.7437641827298191\nContent: ```\n\n\n\n### A policy with two vector paths\n//....\n\n\n</code></pre></div><p>The output shows the top five results ordered by their similarity scores, with higher scores indicating better matches to your query.</p><blockquote><p>To modify the number of results returned, you can add the  argument. For example, to retrieve the top 10 results, run: <code>python3 vector_search.py \"show me an example of a vector embedding policy\" 10</code></p></blockquote><h2>\n  \n  \n  Execute Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) queries\n</h2><p>Now we will put it all together with an simple chat based interface that leverages the  model to generate responses based on the contextual information retrieved from Azure Cosmos DB.</p><p>Configure the environment variables needed for the RAG application and launch the script:</p><div><pre><code>\nbash\n# export COSMOS_DB_URL=\"https://&lt;Cosmos DB account name&gt;.documents.azure.com:443/\"\nexport USE_EMULATOR=\"true\"\nexport DATABASE_NAME=\"rag_local_llm_db\"\nexport CONTAINER_NAME=\"docs\"\nexport EMBEDDINGS_MODEL=\"mxbai-embed-large\"\nexport DIMENSIONS=\"1024\"\nexport CHAT_MODEL=\"llama3\"\n\npython3 rag_chain.py\n\n\n</code></pre></div><p>Once the application initializes, you'll see output confirming the RAG chain setup:</p><div><pre><code>\ntext\nBuilding RAG chain. Using model: llama3\nUsing database: rag_local_llm_db, container: docs\nUsing embedding model: mxbai-embed-large with dimensions: 1024\nCreated instance of AzureCosmosDBNoSqlVectorSearch\nEnter your questions below. Type 'exit' to quit, 'clear' to clear chat history, 'history' to view chat history.\n[User]:\n\n\n</code></pre></div><p>Ask questions about the Azure Cosmos DB vector search documentation that you've loaded. For instance, try asking <code>show me an example of a vector embedding policy</code>, and you'll see a response like this (note that these may vary slightly for your case, even across different runs):</p><div><pre><code>\ntext\n//...\n[User]: show me an example of a vector embedding policy\n[Assistant]: Here is an example of a vector embedding policy:\n\n{\n    \"vectorEmbeddings\": [\n        {\n            \"path\":\"/vector1\",\n            \"dataType\":\"float32\",\n            \"distanceFunction\":\"cosine\",\n            \"dimensions\":1536\n        },\n        {\n            \"path\":\"/vector2\",\n            \"dataType\":\"int8\",\n            \"distanceFunction\":\"dotproduct\",\n            \"dimensions\":100\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nThis policy defines two vector embeddings: one with the path `/vector1`, using `float32` data type, cosine distance function, and having 1536 dimensions; and another with the path `/vector2`, using `int8` data type, dot product distance function, and having 100 dimensions.\n\n\n</code></pre></div><p>To further explore the capabilities of your RAG system, try these additional example queries:</p><ul><li>\"What is the maximum supported dimension for vector embeddings in Azure Cosmos DB?\"</li><li>\"Is it suitable for large scale data?\"</li><li>\"Is there a benefit to using the flat index type?\"</li></ul><blockquote><p>You can enter 'exit' to quit the application, 'clear' to clear chat history, or 'history' to view your previous interactions. Feel free to experiment with different data sources and queries. To modify the number of vector search results used as context, you can add the  environment variable (defaults to 5).</p></blockquote><p>In this walkthrough, you followed step-by-step instructions to set up a complete RAG application that runs entirely on your local infrastructure ‚Äî from installing and configuring Ollama with embedding and chat models, to setting up Azure Cosmos DB for vector storage, loading documentation data, and running using RAG through an interactive chat interface.</p><p>Running models locally brings clear advantages in terms of costs, data privacy, and     connectivity constraints. However, you need to plan for appropriate hardware, particularly for larger models that perform best with dedicated GPUs and sufficient memory. The trade-off between model size, performance, and resource requirements is crucial when planning your local AI setup.</p><p>Have you experimented with local LLMs in your projects?

It's a fantastic tool, but it has one strict requirement: your mock expectations must  match the SQL queries your code generates.</p><p>This can get tricky when using an ORM like GORM. GORM is great for productivity, but the SQL it generates under the hood‚Äîespecially for complex operations like  with multiple index creations‚Äîisn't always obvious. We found ourselves in a cycle of \"guess, run, fail, repeat.\"</p><p>So, how do you find out the  SQL GORM is trying to run?</p><p>We've settled on a simple, iterative debugging workflow that turns this guessing game into a straightforward process. Here‚Äôs how we do it.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  The Challenge: Unpredictable SQL\n</h2><p>The core problem is that  fails if the expected query string doesn't match the actual query string. With GORM's , for example, the order in which it decides to create tables and indexes can change as you add new models or even between GORM versions. You might expect  before , but GORM does the opposite, and your test fails with a cryptic message.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  The Technique: Let the ORM Tell You What It's Doing\n</h2><p>Instead of trying to guess the SQL, we make GORM tell us directly. The key is its built-in logger.</p><p>Here's our step-by-step process:</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Step 1: Isolate the Failing Test\n</h3><p>Run your tests and find the first  expectation that fails. The error message is your starting point. It will usually say something like:\nError: call to ExecQuery '...' with args [...] was not expected, next expectation is: ...</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Step 2: Enable Verbose Logging\n</h3><p>In your test setup where you initialize your GORM connection with the mocked SQL connection, temporarily switch the GORM logger to  mode.</p><pre>// In your test file...\nimport \"gorm.io/gorm/logger\"\n\n// ...\n\n// Temporarily change logger.Silent to logger.Info\ngormDB, err := gorm.Open(dialector, &amp;gorm.Config{ Logger: logger.Default.LogMode(logger.Info), })</pre><h3>\n  \n  \n  Step 3: Run the Test and Observe\n</h3><p>Run the single failing test again (e.g., <code>go test -run TestMyFailingTest</code>). Now, look at your console output. Because the logger is in  mode, GORM will print the exact SQL query it's generating, right before  reports the failure.</p><p>The output will look something like this:</p><p><code>[info] /path/to/your/code.go:123 [SQL] CREATE INDEX \"idx_commission_withdrawals_timestamp\" ON \"commission_withdrawals\" (\"timestamp\") ... [error] ExecQuery: could not match actual sql: \"CREATE INDEX...\" with expected regexp \"CREATE INDEX...recipient_address...\"</code></p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Step 4: Copy, Paste, and Adapt\n</h3><p>The \"actual sql\" from the log is the source of truth.</p><ol><li> the SQL query from the log output.</li><li> it into your test file, replacing or reordering the incorrect expectation in  or .</li><li> it for . You might need to escape special characters for the regex matcher (like parentheses  and ).</li></ol><p>Your test will now pass the first expectation and likely fail on the next one in the sequence.

And I wrote this newsletter to make the key concepts simple and easy for you.</p><p><em>Note: This post is based on my research and may differ from real-world implementation.</em></p><p>Once upon a time, there lived a data analyst named Maria.</p><p>She emailed draft copies many times to different people to prepare monthly reports.</p><p>So she wasted a ton of time and was frustrated.</p><p>Until one day, when she decides to use Google Docs for it.</p><p>Google Docs allows collaborative editing over the internet. It means many users can work on the same document in real-time.</p><p>Yet it‚Äôs difficult to implement Google Docs correctly for 3 reasons:</p><ul><li><p>Concurrent changes to the same document should converge to the same version.</p></li><li><p>Concurrent changes to the same document must avoid conflicts.</p></li><li><p>Any changes should be visible in real-time to each user.</p></li></ul><p>Also a user should be able to make changes while they‚Äôre offline.</p><p>A simple approach to handle concurrency is using pessimistic concurrency control.</p><p>is amechanism for handling concurrency using a lock. It offers strong consistency, but doesn‚Äôt support collaborative editing in real-time. Because it needs a central coordinator to handle data changes, only 1 user can edit at a time. Put simply, only a single document copy is available for write operations at once, while other document copies are read-only.</p><p>Besides it doesn‚Äôt support offline changes.</p><p>Also a network round-trip across the Earth takes 200 milliseconds. </p><p>This might cause a poor user experience. So they do  The idea is to keep a document copy for each user locally and then run operations locally for high responsiveness. Thus creating the illusion of lower latency than reality.</p><p>And the system propagates the changes to all users for consistency.</p><p>A simple approach for latency hiding is using the mechanism.</p><p>Yet it resolves a conflict without waiting for coordination by applying the most recent update. So there‚Äôs a risk of data loss when there are concurrent changes in high-latency networks.</p><p>It might be a good choice when concurrency is low. But it isn‚Äôt suitable for this use case.</p><p>An alternative approach to latency hiding is through <strong>differential synchronization</strong>.</p><p>It keeps a document copy for each user and tracks the changes locally. The system doesn‚Äôt send the entire document when something changes, but only the difference ().</p><p>Yet there‚Äôs a performance overhead in sending a diff for every change. Also differential synchronization only tracks diffs, and not the reason behind a change. So conflict resolution might be difficult.</p><p>While resolving conflicts manually affects the user experience.</p><p>OT is an algorithm to show document changes without wait times on high-latency networks. It allows different document copies to accept write operations at once. Also it handles conflict resolution automatically without locks or user interventions. </p><p>Besides OT tolerates divergence among document copies and converges them later.</p><p>Think of <strong>operational transformation</strong> as an event-passing mechanism; it ensures each user has the same document state even with unsynchronized changes.</p><p>With OT, the system saves each change as an event. Put simply, a change doesn‚Äôt affect the underlying character of a document; instead, it adds an event to the revision log. The system then displays the document by replaying the revision log from its start.</p><p>Operational transformation saves a document as a set of operations, but it's complex to implement properly.</p><h2>How Does Google Docs Work</h2><p>Google Docs uses a client-server architecture for simplicity.</p>","contentLength":3631,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/4b73f9d4-a8d6-4101-9dff-df53a7332de1_1280x720.png","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Create a Real-Time Chat App with Python, WebSockets, and FastAPI","url":"https://dev.to/djamware_tutorial_eba1a61/create-a-real-time-chat-app-with-python-websockets-and-fastapi-24h2","date":1755863151,"author":"Djamware Tutorial","guid":236872,"unread":true,"content":"<p>In this guide, you‚Äôll learn how to:</p><ul><li>Use FastAPI with WebSockets for real-time communication</li><li>Broadcast chat messages to all users</li><li>Extend with multiple rooms and Redis Pub/Sub</li><li>Deploy and test your chat app</li></ul>","contentLength":201,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"10 Must-Ask Interview Questions for Python Developers","url":"https://dev.to/jessica_marious/10-must-ask-interview-questions-for-python-developers-4i1g","date":1755862420,"author":"Jessica Marious","guid":236871,"unread":true,"content":"<p>Python has evolved from a simple scripting tool into one of the most widely used programming languages across web development, automation, data science, and machine learning. In 2025, finding the right <a href=\"https://www.onboardnow.ai/hire/python/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Python developer for hire</a> is more critical than ever. </p><p>The challenge is that not every candidate with ‚ÄúPython experience‚Äù can build, scale, and maintain production-ready applications. A well-structured interview process is key to identifying developers who can write clean code and solve real problems effectively. </p><p>This guide brings together 15 essential interview questions for Python developers. These questions cover fundamentals, coding skills, and problem-solving approaches, helping recruiters, hiring managers, and even developers preparing for interviews navigate the process with confidence. </p><h2>\n  \n  \n  1. What are Python‚Äôs key features?\n</h2><p>This is a classic opener that helps you gauge how well a candidate understands Python‚Äôs fundamentals. A good developer should mention things like: </p><ul><li>Python is interpreted and dynamically typed.\n</li><li>It emphasizes readability and simplicity (thanks to indentation). </li><li>It supports multiple programming paradigms (object-oriented, functional, procedural). </li><li>It has a huge ecosystem of libraries and frameworks.</li></ul><p>Strong candidates usually go beyond buzzwords and give examples. For instance, they might mention how Python‚Äôs extensive community support makes troubleshooting easier, or how dynamic typing speeds up prototyping. </p><h2>\n  \n  \n  2. Explain Python‚Äôs memory management.\n</h2><p>This question checks whether the developer understands what‚Äôs happening under the hood. Python manages memory using: </p><ul><li>Reference counting and garbage collection for unused objects. </li><li>Memory pools (like PyMalloc) to optimize allocation. </li><li>Developers can use modules like gc to interact with the garbage collector. </li></ul><h2>\n  \n  \n  3. What are Python‚Äôs built-in data types and data structures?\n</h2><p>Expect candidates to cover: </p><ul><li>Basic data types: int, float, str, bool. </li><li>Collection types: list, tuple, set, dict. </li><li>Advanced: frozenset, deque from collections, or even dataclasses. </li></ul><p>An excellent candidate won‚Äôt just list them but will explain use cases. For instance, why you‚Äôd use a tuple instead of a list (immutability, hashability), or when a dictionary is more efficient than nested lists. </p><h2>\n  \n  \n  4. Explain inheritance and polymorphism in Python.\n</h2><p>Since Python is object-oriented, this is a must-ask. Candidates should explain: </p><p> allows a class to derive attributes and methods from another. </p><p> allows different classes to define methods with the same name but potentially different behavior. </p><h2>\n  \n  \n  5. What are decorators, and how are they used?\n</h2><p>Decorators are a hot topic in Python interviews because they test both technical depth and practical coding skills. Candidates should say: </p><p>Decorators are functions that wrap other functions to modify their behavior without changing their code. </p><p>They‚Äôre widely used in frameworks like Flask (<a href=\"//mailto:@app.route\">@app.route</a>) or Django (@login_required). </p><p>def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):  </p><p>print(f\"Calling {func.name}\")  </p><p>return func(*args, **kwargs)  </p><p>This shows how decorators add functionality in a clean, reusable way. </p><h2>\n  \n  \n  6. What‚Äôs the difference between @staticmethod, @classmethod, and instance methods?\n</h2><p>This question checks if candidates can distinguish between method types: </p><ul><li> Regular methods, take self, operate on an instance. </li><li> Use @classmethod, take cls, often used for alternative constructors. </li><li> Use @staticmethod, don‚Äôt need self or cls, utility functions inside a class.</li></ul><p>An advanced developer may explain when to use them. For example, using a classmethod to create objects from different input formats (like from_json). </p><h2>\n  \n  \n  7. Explain Python‚Äôs Global Interpreter Lock (GIL).\n</h2><p>If you‚Äôre hiring for performance-heavy roles, this is essential.

There may be a question in the head after hearing this, \"How is that possible?\" You need another Go compiler to make a Go compiler, right? \"\nIt's a classic \"egg before or chicken before\" kind of question. And the answer lies in a cool computer science concept called Bootstrapping.<p>\nWhat is the Bootstrapping thing?</p>\nIn simple terms, bootstrapping is using a small or simple system to create a bigger and stronger system. Something like lifting yourself up by holding your shoe lace! This is exactly what happened to Go.<p>\nLet's see how it works step by step:</p></p><ol><li>The first compiler was written in another language:\nThe first compiler of Go was not written in Go language. It was written using C language. This C-based compiler had only one job: compiling the Go Source Code into an executable program.</li><li>Written a new compiler with Go:\nAfter that, Go developers wrote the source code for a whole new compiler using Go language.</li><li>The real magic: \nBootstrapping is done in this stage. The Go Team used their old compiler made with C to compile the source code of the new compiler written with Go. So they got a compiler (executable file) made of Go.</li><li>Go Self-Sufficient: \nOnce Go could build his own compiler, there was no need for the old C-based compiler. From now on Go starts building himself.\nMeans, Go 1.4 is used to compile the Go 1.5 version. Used Go 1.5 to compile Go 1.6 again This is how the chain goes.\nSo, next time you hear \"Go is written in Go\", don't be surprised! This bootstrapping method uses not only Go, but also large programming language like C, Rust, Java. This is the sign of maturity or maturity of a language.\nSome questions may arise in your mind as such:\nQ: What is the advantage or profit of this? Wouldn't the compiler made of C be faster?\nAnswer: There are many benefits such as maintenance, contributor productivity, tooling consistency, portability, and feature development speed etc. will be easy. Many common bug of RC can be avoided.\nQ:At the end of the day, then, the base of the Go compiler is in C, right?\nAnswer: A compiler written in C, called the C-Compiler, is used to build the first version of the Go compiler from its Go source code. This process creates an executable file: go_compiler_v1.exe. Next, go_compiler_v1.exe is used to compile a newer version of the Go source code. This creates go_compiler_v2.exe, which can then be used to compile the next version, and so on. Thus, the C-Compiler is no longer needed.\nQ: Isn't it the same for Java?\nAnswer: Many important languages follow the bootstrapping technique, but by no means is it a universal rule for success.</li></ol>","contentLength":2693,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Dev Gets 4 Years For Creating Kill Switch On Ex-Employer's Systems","url":"https://yro.slashdot.org/story/25/08/22/0039200/dev-gets-4-years-for-creating-kill-switch-on-ex-employers-systems?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&utm_medium=feed","date":1755856800,"author":"BeauHD","guid":236821,"unread":true,"content":"Davis Lu, a former Eaton Corporation developer, has been sentenced to four years in prison for sabotaging his ex-employer's Windows network with malware and a custom kill switch that locked out thousands of employees once his account was disabled.

BleepingComputer reports: After a corporate restructuring and subsequent demotion in 2018, the DOJ says that Lu retaliated by embedding malicious code throughout the company's Windows production environment. The malicious code included an infinite Java thread loop designed to overwhelm servers and crash production systems. Lu also created a kill switch named \"IsDLEnabledinAD\" (\"Is Davis Lu enabled in Active Directory\") that would automatically lock all users out of their accounts if his account was disabled in Active Directory. When his employment was terminated on September 9, 2019, and his account disabled, the kill switch activated, causing thousands of users to be locked out of their systems.\n \n\"The defendant breached his employer's trust by using his access and technical knowledge to sabotage company networks, wreaking havoc and causing hundreds of thousands of dollars in losses for a U.S. company,\" said Acting Assistant Attorney General Matthew R. Galeotti. When he was instructed to return his laptop, Lu reportedly deleted encrypted data from his device. Investigators later discovered search queries on the device researching how to elevate privileges, hide processes, and quickly delete files.

I had a sleek WebUI, metadata management, and a FastAPI backend. Everything looked promising on paper. Then I stumbled across a Reddit post that changed everything.</p><p>A frustrated developer was complaining about Great Expectations: \"Too complex, too many dependencies. I don't want a 'data quality platform'‚ÄîI want a 'data validation function'.\"</p><p>That hit me like a cold shower. Here I was, building exactly what this person  want.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Why Build a Data Validation Tool?\n</h3><p>As a seasoned data architect who'd led Java-based data quality tools before, I thought I understood the problem.  seemed straightforward enough. With AI pair programming on the rise, why not leverage my domain knowledge and let AI handle the coding gaps?</p><p>My initial vision was ambitious: a WebUI-based tool with metadata configuration, connection management, rule execution, and result visualization. I chose Streamlit for the frontend and FastAPI for the backend, aiming for something lightweight yet comprehensive.</p><p>But \"lightweight\" quickly became anything but.</p><p>After two months of development, I realized I'd made four critical mistakes:</p><ol><li><p> - I had a PRD but no detailed functional specs. AI filled the gaps by expanding features I never asked for.</p></li><li><p> - Especially around API interfaces, leading to two painful refactors mid-development.</p></li><li><p><strong>Overestimating AI capabilities</strong> - I lacked experience in driving AI for app development, despite my software engineering background.</p></li><li><p><strong>Perfectionism killing the MVP</strong> - I added complex features like multi-rule execution for single tables and obsessed over test coverage.</p></li></ol><p>The  was real. I'd drifted far from my  goals.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  The Four Questions That Changed Everything\n</h3><p>That Reddit post forced me to ask myself some uncomfortable questions:</p><ul><li>Does my product really need to maintain a metadata layer?</li><li>Is my core engine small and beautiful enough to support different deployment scenarios?</li><li>Is WebUI actually necessary for my target users?</li><li>What's the most valuable part of my product, and is it truly at the center?</li></ul><p>Once I asked the right questions, the answers became painfully obvious. My ‚Äîdata engineers and analysts‚Äîdidn't want another platform. They wanted a tool that could validate data with a single command, SQL query, or script.</p><p>I made a tough decision: scrap the half-built WebUI version and extract the rule engine as a standalone CLI tool.</p><p>But there was a problem. The rule engine was tightly coupled with other modules, especially through ORM models designed for metadata persistence. This violated basic  I knew by heart but had somehow ignored in practice.</p><blockquote><p>\"Technical debt must be paid. I couldn't justify keeping legacy code just to maintain backward compatibility.\"</p></blockquote><p>I redesigned the interface using a clean schema model in a shared module, refactored twice to internalize configuration management and error handling, and finally achieved a truly independent core module.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Building an App with Python: Lessons Learned\n</h2><p>Working on this  project taught me that domain expertise doesn't automatically translate to implementation wisdom. When I lacked confidence in Python project structure, I defaulted to AI suggestions‚Äînot always the best approach.</p><p>The refactoring process was painful but necessary. I couldn't  by pushing it to future versions. Clean architecture isn't just academic theory; it's survival for any product that plans to evolve.</p><p>Now I have a completed CLI module with comprehensive tests, and the first version has been released on GitHub and PyPI.

Version 1 focuses on single-table rules, but the architecture supports:</p><ul><li>Multi-table relationships</li><li>Cross-database validation</li><li>Web UI and cloud deployment</li></ul><p>The goal isn't to replace your entire data infrastructure - it's to make data quality checking so easy that you actually do it.</p><p><strong>Data validation shouldn't require a dedicated team and six months of setup.</strong> It should be as simple as running a command and getting actionable results.</p><p>That's what I'm building.

Sounds like science fiction? Not anymore. This is the power of neural networks, a cornerstone of modern machine learning. This article will demystify the fundamental building blocks of neural networks: perceptrons and activation functions, providing a clear path for both beginners and those looking to solidify their understanding.</p><p>At its heart, a neural network is a collection of interconnected nodes, inspired by the biological structure of the human brain. The simplest of these nodes is the perceptron ‚Äì a single-layer neural network. Think of it as a simplified model of a neuron, receiving input, processing it, and producing an output.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  The Math Behind the Magic\n</h3><p>A perceptron takes multiple inputs ($x_1, x_2, ..., x_n$), each weighted by a corresponding weight ($w_1, w_2, ..., w_n$). These weighted inputs are summed, and a bias ($b$) is added. This sum is then passed through an activation function to produce the output. Let's break it down:</p><ol><li>  $z = w_1x_1 + w_2x_2 + ... + w_nx_n + b$</li><li> $a = f(z)$  where 'a' is the output and 'f' is the activation function.</li></ol><p>Let's visualize this with a simple example: imagine a perceptron deciding whether to buy a stock based on two factors: price ($x_1$) and volume ($x_2$). Each factor has a weight reflecting its importance, and the bias represents a general market sentiment.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><h3>\n  \n  \n  The Role of Weights and Bias\n</h3><p>The weights determine the influence of each input on the output. A higher weight signifies a stronger influence. The bias acts as a threshold; it adjusts the activation function's output, allowing the perceptron to activate even when the weighted sum is close to zero. Learning in a perceptron involves adjusting these weights and bias to minimize errors.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Activation Functions: Introducing Non-Linearity\n</h2><p>The activation function is the crucial ingredient that introduces non-linearity into the perceptron. Without it, the perceptron would only be capable of performing linear classifications ‚Äì severely limiting its power. Several activation functions exist, each with its strengths and weaknesses.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Popular Activation Functions\n</h3><ul><li><p>  This is the simplest activation function. It outputs 1 if the weighted sum is above a threshold (usually 0) and 0 otherwise.  It's computationally efficient but lacks the nuance of other functions.</p></li><li><p> This function outputs a value between 0 and 1, making it suitable for binary classification problems. Its smooth, S-shaped curve allows for better gradient descent during training.  The formula is:  $œÉ(z) = \\frac{1}{1 + e^{-z}}$</p></li><li><p><strong>ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit):</strong>  ReLU outputs the input if it's positive and 0 otherwise. It's computationally efficient and helps mitigate the vanishing gradient problem (a common issue in deep neural networks).  $ReLU(z) = max(0, z)$</p></li></ul><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><h2>\n  \n  \n  Applications and Real-World Impact\n</h2><p>Perceptrons, though simple, form the basis of more complex neural networks. They are used in various applications, including:</p><ul><li> Spam detection, medical diagnosis (e.g., identifying cancerous cells).</li><li><strong>Simple Pattern Recognition:</strong>  Recognizing handwritten digits (though more complex networks are usually employed for better accuracy).</li><li><strong>Building Blocks for Larger Networks:</strong>  Perceptrons are the fundamental units in multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) and other sophisticated architectures.</li></ul><h2>\n  \n  \n  Challenges and Limitations\n</h2><p>While perceptrons are powerful building blocks, they have limitations:</p><ul><li>  They can only classify linearly separable data.  This means they struggle with datasets where the classes cannot be separated by a straight line (or hyperplane in higher dimensions).</li><li>  Single-layer perceptrons are not capable of solving complex problems requiring non-linear decision boundaries.</li></ul><h2>\n  \n  \n  The Future of Perceptrons and Activation Functions\n</h2><p>Despite their limitations, perceptrons and activation functions remain central to the field of neural networks. Ongoing research focuses on developing new and more efficient activation functions to address challenges like the vanishing gradient problem and improve the performance of deep learning models. The exploration of novel architectures built upon these fundamental components continues to push the boundaries of what's possible in artificial intelligence.

Think of GC as a backstage crew cleaning up memory your program no longer needs. But if it‚Äôs too aggressive, you get latency spikes; too lax, and you risk memory bloat or crashes.</p><p>This guide is for Go developers with 1-2 years of experience who want to level up. We‚Äôll unpack how Go‚Äôs GC triggers, share tuning tips with  and , and dive into real-world examples that slashed latency and boosted throughput. Expect practical code, common pitfalls, and tools like  to make your apps faster and leaner. Let‚Äôs tame Go‚Äôs GC and make your programs scream!</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  1. Go GC Basics: What‚Äôs Happening Under the Hood?\n</h3><p>Go uses a <strong>concurrent mark-and-sweep GC</strong>, cleaning memory while your program runs to minimize pauses (Stop-The-World or STW). Here‚Äôs the breakdown:</p><ul><li>: Identifies objects still in use.</li><li>: Frees unused memory.</li><li>: Decides  GC runs, based on heap growth and settings like .</li></ul><p>Since Go 1.5, GC is concurrent, and Go 1.8+ added smarter write barriers, making it ideal for high-concurrency apps like web servers. But without tuning, you might face jittery APIs or crashes in memory-constrained environments like Kubernetes. Let‚Äôs explore when GC kicks in.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  2. When Does GC Run? Understanding Trigger Conditions\n</h3><p>GC triggers aren‚Äôt random‚Äîthey‚Äôre driven by specific conditions. Knowing these lets you predict and control GC behavior.</p><h4>\n  \n  \n  2.1 Memory Allocation Trigger (GOGC)\n</h4><p>The primary trigger is heap growth, controlled by the  environment variable (default: 100). GC runs when the heap doubles the live heap (active memory). The formula is:</p><p><strong>next_gc = live_heap * (1 + GOGC/100)</strong></p><p>For a 100MB live heap with , GC triggers at 200MB. Lower  (e.g., 50) increases GC frequency, saving memory but using more CPU. Higher  (e.g., 200) delays GC, boosting throughput but risking memory spikes.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Run with :</p><div><pre><code>$ GODEBUG=gctrace=1 go run main.go\ngc 1 @0.019s 4%: 0.030+1.2+0.010 ms clock, 4-&gt;4-&gt;2 MB\n</code></pre></div><p>This shows GC took 1.2ms, reducing the heap from 4MB to 2MB.</p><p>Since Go 1.9, GC runs every 2 minutes, even with low allocations. This prevents long-running apps (e.g., background workers) from holding memory forever. It‚Äôs non-disableable, so plan for it in low-allocation services.</p><p>You can force GC with , but use it sparingly (e.g., batch jobs or debugging). Overuse disrupts the Pacer, spiking CPU.</p><h4>\n  \n  \n  2.4 Real-World Example: Fixing API Latency\n</h4><p>In a high-traffic API, P99 latency hit 300ms due to frequent JSON allocations triggering GC 10 times per second. Using , we confirmed the issue. Bumping  to 150 reduced GC frequency, cutting latency by 20% with a slight memory increase. Small tweaks, big wins.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  3. Tuning GC: Your Knobs and Levers\n</h3><p>Triggers set  GC runs; parameters control  it behaves. Let‚Äôs explore  and .</p><h4>\n  \n  \n  3.1 GOGC: Control the Pace\n</h4><p> dictates GC frequency:</p><ul><li>: Less frequent GC, ideal for high-throughput batch jobs, but uses more memory.</li><li>: More frequent GC, great for low-latency APIs or memory-constrained setups.</li></ul><p>: Start at , then adjust. Try  for APIs,  for batch jobs.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><h4>\n  \n  \n  3.2 GOMEMLIMIT: Set a Memory Cap\n</h4><p>Since Go 1.19,  caps total memory (heap + stack). When nearing the limit, GC runs more often to avoid crashes‚Äîperfect for containers.</p><p>: Set  to 80-90% of your container‚Äôs memory to account for system overhead.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Run with  to monitor.</p><h4>\n  \n  \n  3.3 Debugging with GODEBUG\n</h4><p> logs GC details:</p><ul></ul><div><pre><code>gc 1 @0.019s 4%: 0.030+1.2+0.010 ms clock, 0.12+0.68/1.1/0.23+0.040 ms cpu, 4-&gt;4-&gt;2 MB\n</code></pre></div><p>Use it to spot excessive GC or memory leaks.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  4. Code-Level Tricks to Ease GC Pressure\n</h3><p>Tuning parameters is only half the battle‚Äîwriting GC-friendly code is key to reducing memory allocations and keeping your app fast. Here are four techniques, with code examples, pitfalls, and pro tips to make your Go programs lean.</p><h4>\n  \n  \n  4.1 Reuse Objects with </h4><p>Frequent allocations (e.g., JSON buffers in APIs) trigger GC too often.  lets you reuse objects, slashing allocations. Think of it as a recycling bin for temporary objects.</p><p>: Reusing buffers in a web server.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>: Reusing buffers avoids new allocations, cutting GC runs by 30-50% in high-traffic APIs.</p><p>: Forgetting to reset buffers can leak data. Always clear them before returning to the pool.</p><p>: Use  for short-lived objects like buffers or temporary structs, but avoid it for complex, long-lived objects, as the pool may retain them unnecessarily.</p><h4>\n  \n  \n  4.2 Optimize Data Structures\n</h4><p>Poor data structures balloon memory, overworking GC. Two strategies:</p><ul><li>: Dynamic resizing via  doubles memory during growth. Use  to set capacity upfront.</li><li>: Large allocations (e.g., 10MB slices) are tough for GC. Use smaller chunks.</li></ul><p>: Pre-allocating slices for log processing.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>: Pre-allocation avoids resizing, reducing GC triggers. In a test with 1M logs, this cut GC runs by 40%.</p><p>: Overestimating capacity wastes memory. Estimate based on typical data sizes.</p><h4>\n  \n  \n  4.3 Use  for String Operations\n</h4><p>String concatenation with  creates new strings, piling up allocations.  builds strings efficiently by growing its internal buffer.</p><p>: Efficient log message construction.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>:  minimizes allocations, reducing GC frequency by up to 25% in stream processing apps.</p><p>: Don‚Äôt reuse  without calling , especially in loops or pools.</p><h4>\n  \n  \n  4.4 Monitor and Profile Allocations\n</h4><p>Use tools to find and fix allocation hotspots:</p><ul><li>: Profiles memory/CPU usage. Run <code>go tool pprof http://localhost:6060/debug/pprof/heap</code> to analyze.</li><li>: Tracks heap size and GC stats.</li><li>: Monitors production metrics.</li></ul><p>: Checking memory stats.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>: Combine , pre-allocation, , and profiling to minimize GC pressure. Let‚Äôs see these in action.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  5. Real-World Wins: GC Tuning in Action\n</h3><p>Here are three real-world scenarios where GC tuning and code optimization transformed performance. Each includes the problem, solutions, code, results, and tools used.</p><h4>\n  \n  \n  5.1 High-Traffic API Service\n</h4><p>: A REST API handling 10,000 QPS had P99 latency spikes of 300ms.  revealed frequent JSON response allocations triggering GC 15 times per second, hogging CPU.</p><ol><li>Increased  from 100 to 150 to reduce GC frequency.</li><li>Used  for JSON buffers.</li><li>Pre-allocated response slices with .</li></ol><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><ul><li>P99 latency dropped from 300ms to 210ms (30% improvement).</li><li>Throughput rose from 5000 to 5750 QPS (15% boost).</li><li>GC frequency fell from 15 to 8 times per second.</li></ul><p>:  identified allocation hotspots; Prometheus+Grafana monitored latency and GC metrics.</p><p>: A bar chart comparing P99 latency and throughput before/after.

Conceived in 1884 as an entrance arch to the 1889 World's Fair, this towering structure has captivated millions of visitors over the years. But what's the science behind this intriguing phenomenon?</p><p>Firstly, let's understand the design of the Eiffel Tower. It consists of three levels, with the first level being the lowest at 57 meters and the third level reaching a staggering height of 324 meters. The tower is made primarily of iron, which expands when heated. This expansion is what causes the tower to grow taller during the summer months.</p><p>Each year, as the sun beats down on the tower, the metal absorbs heat energy. This causes the iron to expand, creating a slight increase in the tower's overall height. However, this growth is so minute that it's almost imperceptible to the naked eye. In fact, if you were to measure the tower's height every day, you might not even notice the change!</p><p>But here's where things get really interesting. The expansion of the Eiffel Tower isn't uniform across its entire surface. Instead, it occurs most significantly at the points where the metal meets the concrete foundation. This is because the concrete absorbs heat more slowly than the metal, creating a gradient in temperature that causes the metal to expand more rapidly at the base.</p><p>As a result, each year, the Eiffel Tower grows slightly taller at the bottom and remains the same height at the top. Over time, this difference in growth rates has led to a noticeable increase in the tower's overall height. In fact, since its construction, the Eiffel Tower has grown a staggering 18 centimeters taller!</p><p>So, the next time you visit the Eiffel Tower, take a moment to marvel at this fascinating physics phenomenon.

SageMaker HyperPod recipes help you get started with training and fine-tuning popular publicly available foundation models (FMs) such as Meta‚Äôs Llama, Mistral, and DeepSeek in just minutes, using either SageMaker HyperPod or training jobs. The recipes provide pre-built, validated configurations that alleviate the complexity of setting up distributed training environments while maintaining enterprise-grade performance and scalability for models. We outline steps to fine-tune the GPT-OSS model on a multilingual reasoning dataset, <a href=\"https://huggingface.co/datasets/HuggingFaceH4/Multilingual-Thinking\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">HuggingFaceH4/Multilingual-Thinking</a>, so GPT-OSS can handle structured, chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning across multiple languages.</p><p>This solution uses SageMaker HyperPod recipes to run a fine-tuning job on HyperPod using <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/eks/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service</a> (Amazon EKS) orchestration or training jobs. Recipes are processed through the SageMaker HyperPod recipe launcher, which serves as the orchestration layer responsible for launching a job on the corresponding architecture such as SageMaker HyperPod (Slurm or Amazon EKS) or training jobs. To learn more, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/sagemaker-hyperpod-recipes.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">SageMaker HyperPod recipes</a>.</p><p>In the following sections, we discuss the prerequisites for both options, and then move on to the data preparation. The prepared data is saved to <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/fsx/lustre/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Amazon FSx for Lustre</a>, which is used as the persistent file system for SageMaker HyperPod, or <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/s3/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Amazon Simple Storage Service</a> (Amazon S3) for training jobs. We then use recipes to submit the fine-tuning job, and finally deploy the trained model to a SageMaker endpoint for testing and evaluating the model. The following diagram illustrates this architecture.</p><p>To follow along, you must have the following prerequisites:</p><ul><li>A local development environment with AWS credentials configured for creating and accessing SageMaker resources, or a remote environment such as <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/ai/studio/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Amazon SageMaker Studio</a>.</li><li>For fine-tuning the model using SageMaker training jobs, you must have one ml.p5.48xlarge instance (with 8 x NVIDIA H100 GPUs) for training jobs usage. If you don‚Äôt have sufficient limits, request the following SageMaker quotas on the <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/servicequotas/latest/userguide/intro.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Service Quotas</a> console: P5 instance (ml.p5.48xlarge) for training jobs (ml.p5.48xlarge for cluster usage): 1.</li></ul><p>We use the <a href=\"https://huggingface.co/datasets/HuggingFaceH4/Multilingual-Thinking\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Hugging FaceH4/Multilingual-Thinking</a> dataset, which is a multilingual reasoning dataset containing CoT examples translated into languages such as French, Spanish, and German. The recipe supports a sequence length of 4,000 tokens for the GPT-OSS 120B model. The following example code demonstrates how to tokenize the multilingual-thinking dataset. The recipe accepts data in Hugging Face format (arrow).

SageMaker training jobs are ideal for one-off or periodic training workloads that need temporary compute resources, making it a fully managed, on-demand experience for your training needs. SageMaker HyperPod is optimal for continuous development and experimentation, providing a persistent, preconfigured, and failure-resilient cluster. Depending on your choice, skip to the appropriate section for next steps.</p><h2>Fine-tune the model using SageMaker HyperPod</h2><p>To fine-tune the model using HyperPod, start by setting up the virtual environment and installing the necessary dependencies to execute the training job on the EKS cluster.

You can get the location of the output artifacts from the section on the job details page.</p><p>After you fine-tune your GPT-OSS model with SageMaker recipes on either SageMaker training jobs or SageMaker HyperPod, the output is a customized model artifact that merges the base model with the customized PEFT adapters. This final model is stored in Amazon S3 and can be deployed directly from Amazon S3 to SageMaker endpoints for real-time inference.</p><p>To serve GPT-OSS models, you must have the latest vLLM containers (v0.10.1 or later). A full list of  Docker image versions is available on <a href=\"https://hub.docker.com/r/vllm/vllm-openai/tags\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Docker hub</a>.</p><p>The steps to deploy your fine-tuned GPT-OSS model are outlined in this section.</p><h3>Build the latest GPT-OSS container for your SageMaker endpoint</h3><p>If you‚Äôre deploying the model from SageMaker Studio using JupyterLab or the Code Editor, both environments come with Docker preinstalled. Make sure that you‚Äôre using the SageMaker Distribution image v3.0 or later for compatibility.You can build your deployment container by running the following commands:</p><div><pre><code>%%bash # &lt;- use this if you're running this inside JupterLab cell\n\n# navigate to deploy dir from the current workdir, to build container\ncd ./deploy \n\n# build a push container\nchmod +X build.sh\nbash build.sh\n\ncd ..&nbsp;</code></pre></div><p>If you‚Äôre running these commands from a local terminal or other environment, simply omit the  line and run the commands as standard shell commands.</p><p>The  script is responsible for automatically building and pushing a  container that is optimized for SageMaker endpoints. After it‚Äôs built, the custom SageMaker endpoint compatible  image is pushed to <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/ecr/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Amazon Elastic Container Registry</a> (Amazon ECR). SageMaker endpoints can then pull this image from Amazon ECR at runtime to spin up the container for inference.</p><p>The following is an example of the  script:</p><div><pre><code>export REGION={region}\nexport ACCOUNT_ID={account_id}\nexport REPOSITORY_NAME=vllm\nexport TAG=v0.10.1\n\nfull_name=\"${ACCOUNT_ID}.dkr.ecr.${REGION}.amazonaws.com/${REPOSITORY_NAME}:${TAG}\"\n\necho \"building $full_name\"\n\nDOCKER_BUILDKIT=0 docker build . --network sagemaker --tag $full_name --file Dockerfile\n\naws ecr get-login-password --region $REGION | docker login --username AWS --password-stdin $ACCOUNT_ID.dkr.ecr.$REGION.amazonaws.com\n\n# If the repository doesn't exist in ECR, create it.\naws ecr describe-repositories --region ${REGION} --repository-names \"${REPOSITIRY_NAME}\" &gt; /dev/null 2&gt;&amp;1\n\nif [ $? -ne 0 ]\nthen\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;aws ecr create-repository --region ${REGION} --repository-name \"${REPOSITORY_NAME}\" &gt; /dev/null\nfi\n\ndocker tag $REPOSITORY_NAME:$TAG ${full_name}\ndocker push ${full_name}</code></pre></div><p>The Dockerfile defines how we convert an open source vLLM Docker image into a SageMaker hosting-compatible image. This involves extending the base  image, adding the  entrypoint script, and making it executable. See the following example Dockerfile:</p><div><pre><code>FROM vllm/vllm-openai:v0.10.1\n\nCOPY serve /usr/bin/serve\nRUN chmod 777 /usr/bin/serve\n\nENTRYPOINT [ \"/usr/bin/serve\" ]</code></pre></div><p>The  script acts as a translation layer between SageMaker hosting conventions and the vLLM runtime. You can maintain the same deployment workflow you‚Äôre familiar with when hosting models on SageMaker endpoints, while automatically converting SageMaker-specific configurations into the format expected by vLLM.</p><p>Key points to note about this script:</p><ul><li>It enforces the use of port 8080, which SageMaker requires for inference containers</li><li>It dynamically translates environment variables prefixed with  into CLI arguments for vLLM (for example, <code>OPTION_MAX_MODEL_LEN=4096</code> changes to )</li><li>It prints the final set of arguments for visibility</li><li>It finally launches the vLLM API server with the translated arguments</li></ul><p>The following is an example  script:</p><div><pre><code>#!/bin/bash\n\n# Define the prefix for environment variables to look for\nPREFIX=\"OPTION_\"\nARG_PREFIX=\"--\"\n\n# Initialize an array for storing the arguments\n# port 8080 required by sagemaker, https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/your-algorithms-inference-code.html#your-algorithms-inference-code-container-response\nARGS=(--port 8080)\n\n# Loop through all environment variables\nwhile IFS='=' read -r key value; do\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;# Remove the prefix from the key, convert to lowercase, and replace underscores with dashes\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;arg_name=$(echo \"${key#\"${PREFIX}\"}\" | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]' | tr '_' '-')\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;# Add the argument name and value to the ARGS array\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;ARGS+=(\"${ARG_PREFIX}${arg_name}\")\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;if [ -n \"$value\" ]; then\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;ARGS+=(\"$value\")\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;fi\ndone &lt; &lt;(env | grep \"^${PREFIX}\")\n\necho \"-------------------------------------------------------------------\"\necho \"vLLM engine args: [${ARGS[@]}]\"\necho \"-------------------------------------------------------------------\"\n\n# Pass the collected arguments to the main entrypoint\nexec python3 -m vllm.entrypoints.openai.api_server \"${ARGS[@]}\"</code></pre></div><h3>Host customized GPT-OSS as a SageMaker real-time endpoint</h3><p>Now you can deploy your fine-tuned GPT-OSS model using the ECR image URI you built in the previous step. In this example, the model artifacts are stored securely in an S3 bucket, and SageMaker will download them into the container at runtime.Complete the following configurations:</p><ul><li>Set  to point to the S3 prefix where your model artifacts are located</li><li>Set the  environment variable to , which is where SageMaker mounts the model inside the container</li><li>(Optional) If you‚Äôre serving a model from Hugging Face Hub instead of Amazon S3, you can set  directly to the Hugging Face model ID instead</li></ul><p>The endpoint startup might take several minutes as the model artifacts are downloaded and the container is initialized.The following is an example deployment code:</p><div><pre><code>inference_image = f\"{account_id}.dkr.ecr.{region}.amazonaws.com/vllm:v0.10.1\"\n\n...\n...\n\nlmi_model = sagemaker.Model(\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;image_uri=inference_image,\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;env={\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"OPTION_MODEL\": \"/opt/ml/model\",&nbsp;# set this to let SM endpoint read a model stored in s3, else set it to HF MODEL ID\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"OPTION_SERVED_MODEL_NAME\": \"model\",\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"OPTION_TENSOR_PARALLEL_SIZE\": json.dumps(num_gpus),\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"OPTION_DTYPE\": \"bfloat16\",\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;#\"VLLM_ATTENTION_BACKEND\": \"TRITON_ATTN_VLLM_V1\", # not required for vLLM 0.10.1 and above\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"OPTION_ASYNC_SCHEDULING\": \"true\",\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"OPTION_QUANTIZATION\": \"mxfp4\"\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;},\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;role=role,\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;name=model_name,\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;model_data={\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'S3DataSource': {\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'S3Uri': \"s3://path/to/gpt-oss/model/artifacts\",\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'S3DataType': 'S3Prefix',\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'CompressionType': 'None'\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;}\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;},\n)\n\n...\n\nlmi_model.deploy(\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;initial_instance_count=1,\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;instance_type=instance_type,\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;container_startup_health_check_timeout=600,\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;endpoint_name=endpoint_name,\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;endpoint_type=sagemaker.enums.EndpointType.INFERENCE_COMPONENT_BASED,\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;inference_component_name=inference_component_name,\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;resources=ResourceRequirements(requests={\"num_accelerators\": 1, \"memory\": 1024*3, \"copies\": 1,}),\n)</code></pre></div><p>After your endpoint is deployed and in the  state, you can invoke your fine-tuned GPT-OSS model using the SageMaker Python SDK.</p><p>The following is an example predictor setup:</p><div><pre><code>pretrained_predictor = sagemaker.Predictor(\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;endpoint_name=endpoint_name,\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;sagemaker_session=sagemaker.Session(boto3.Session(region_name=boto3.Session().region_name)),\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;serializer=serializers.JSONSerializer(),\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;deserializer=deserializers.JSONDeserializer(),\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;component_name=inference_component_name\n)</code></pre></div><p>The modified vLLM container is fully compatible with the OpenAI-style  input format, making it straightforward to send chat-style requests:</p><div><pre><code>payload = {\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;\"messages\": [{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"Hello who are you?\"}],\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;\"parameters\": {\"max_new_tokens\": 64, \"temperature\": 0.2}\n}\n\noutput = pretrained_predictor.predict(payload)</code></pre></div><p>You have successfully deployed and invoked your custom fine-tuned GPT-OSS model on SageMaker real-time endpoints, using the vLLM framework for optimized, low-latency inference.

This post aims to guide you through the decision-making process and highlight the unique advantages of Amazon&nbsp;Q&nbsp;Business and how to build an AWS architecture to get started and onboard more use cases.</p><p>Amazon Q Business is an AI-powered assistant that can help employees quickly find information, solve problems, and get work done across their company‚Äôs data and applications. With Amazon Q Business, employees can access information from various internal documents, websites, wikis, and other business resources through natural conversations, helping them to find exactly what they need without extensive searching. It can also be used to automate common workflows across enterprise systems. Amazon Q Business prioritizes security and privacy by operating within your organization‚Äôs existing permissions and access controls, helping to ensure that employees only see information that they‚Äôre authorized to access.</p><p>The first step in selecting the right generative AI solution is to clearly define your use case. Are you looking to enhance a single system, or do you need a solution that spans multiple platforms? Single-system use cases might be well-served by specific generative AI solutions, while cross-system scenarios often benefit from a more unified approach.&nbsp;Organizations that benefit most from Amazon Q Business typically share several key characteristics:</p><ul><li> Companies with large volumes of data spread across multiple repositories and formats (documents, images, audio, video)</li><li> Organizations where employee productivity depends on accessing institutional knowledge quickly and accurately</li><li> Organizations with strict security and compliance needs requiring role-based permissions and access controls</li><li> Teams that need to share information and collaborate across departments and geographies</li><li> Organizations with complex workflows that could benefit from automation and streamlining</li></ul><h2>Key considerations for tool selection</h2><p>When evaluating generative AI tools, there are several factors should you should consider to help ensure successful implementation and adoption:</p><ul><li> Determine if you need custom AI behaviors or if out-of-the-box solutions suffice</li><li> Assess the number of systems involved and the complexity of data flows between them</li><li> Think about your long-term needs and choose a solution that can grow with you</li><li><strong>Data privacy and residency:</strong> Understand your data governance requirements and make sure that your chosen solution can meet them</li><li> Evaluate the total cost of ownership, including implementation, maintenance, and scaling costs</li><li> Consider how quickly you need to implement your generative AI solution</li><li> As with any enterprise AI implementation, organizations must invest in proper training and change management strategies to help ensure adoption</li></ul><h2>The case for Amazon Q Business</h2><p>Amazon Q Business offers unique advantages, especially for organizations that already have AWS services or that have complex, cross-system needs. For AWS enterprise customers that have the resources to build and operate their own solutions, an architecture that includes Amazon Q Business offers flexibility and cost advantages, including:</p><ul><li> Amazon Q Business can provide a consistent AI experience across multiple systems, creating a seamless interface for users.</li><li> As a native AWS service, Amazon Q Business integrates seamlessly with your existing AWS architecture, reducing complexity and potential points of failure.</li><li> Amazon Q Business can connect to various enterprise systems, so that you can use it to create custom workflows that span multiple platforms.</li><li> By using Amazon Q Business, you can take advantage of the proven scalability of AWS to handle growing workloads without worrying about infrastructure management.</li><li> Use the robust security features and compliance certifications of AWS to help reduce your security and compliance burden.</li><li> Amazon Q Business offers a pay-as-you-go model, so you can scale costs with the number of users and usage for knowledge bases. This can lead to significant cost savings (see <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/q/business/pricing/\">pricing details</a>).</li></ul><h2>Implement your generative&nbsp;AI use cases</h2><p>After you‚Äôve chosen your generative AI use cases, consider a phased implementation approach:</p><ol><li><strong>Start with pilot use cases to prove value quickly:</strong> Good pilot use cases include IT help desk or HR workflows. You can get started by taking advantage of AWS-provided example projects and open source samples.</li><li><strong>Evaluate the next use cases:</strong> Prioritize you next use cases by business impact and feature coverage with existing Amazon Q Business connectors and plugins. Often AIOps use cases that include integrations or chat interfaces on top of ServiceNow, Confluence, Teams, or Slack are good examples.</li><li><strong>Use existing data sources:</strong> Connect Amazon Q Business to enterprise systems with supported connectors first to maximize immediate value.</li><li><strong>Implement accuracy testing using frameworks:</strong> Use tools such as the AWS evaluation framework for Amazon Q Business, which includes automated testing pipelines, ground truth datasets, and comprehensive metrics for measuring response quality, relevancy, truthfulness, and overall accuracy.</li><li><strong>Iteratively scale successful implementations across your organization:</strong> Start your implementation with the teams that are most interested in the application and willing to provide feedback. Make changes based on the feedback as needed, then expand it across the organization.</li><li><strong>Measure and track results:</strong> Establish clear KPIs before implementation to quantify business impact.</li></ol><p>Monitor usage and costs, implement feedback loops, and make sure to support security and compliance throughout your generative&nbsp;AI journey. Amazon Q Business can provide significant value when implemented in appropriate use cases with proper planning and governance. Success depends on careful evaluation of business needs, thorough implementation planning, and ongoing management of the solution.</p><p>When implementing your generative AI use cases, architectural decisions play a crucial role in achieving long-term success. Let‚Äôs explore some best practices for a typical AWS enterprise environment.</p><ul><li> Connecting your corporate source of identities to <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/iam/identity-center/\">AWS IAM Identity Center</a> provides better security and user experience, Amazon Q Business users authorize their Amazon Q session with their usual sign-in process, using their existing organizational credentials through the identity source already in place.</li><li> Set up Amazon Q Business service, data sources, and plugins in a shared services account based on application group or business unit to help reduce the number of similar deployments across different AWS accounts.</li><li> When rolling out new use cases, consider also enabling existing familiar enterprise channels such as collaboration tools (Teams or Slack) to provide a frictionless way to test and roll out new use cases.</li><li> When adding data sources, estimate index storage needs and whether your use case requires crawling access control list (ACL) and identity information from the data source and if it is supported by the connector. To reduce initial complexity, focus on use cases that provide the same data to all users, then expand it in a second phase for use cases that rely on ACLs to control access.</li><li> Use plugins to integrate external services as actions. For each use case, verify if a built-in plugin can provide this functionality, or if a custom plugin is needed. For custom plugins, plan an architecture that enables pointing to backend services using OpenAPI endpoints in other AWS accounts across the organization. This allows flexible integration of existing <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/\">AWS Lambda</a> functions or container-based functionality.</li></ul><p>By carefully considering these aspects, you can create a solid foundation for your generative&nbsp;AI implementation that aligns with your organization‚Äôs needs and future growth plans.</p><h2>How to deploy Amazon Q Business in your organization</h2><p>The following reference architecture illustrates the main components and flow of a typical Amazon Q Business implementation:</p><p>The workflow is as follows:</p><ol><li>A user interacts with an assistant through an enterprise collaboration system.</li><li>Alternate: A user interacts with the built-in web interface provided by Amazon Q Business.</li><li>The user is authenticated using IAM Identity Center and federated by a third-party identity provider (IdP).</li><li>Data sources are configured for existing enterprise systems and data is crawled and indexed in Amazon Q Business. You can use custom connectors to integrate data sources that aren‚Äôt provided by Amazon Q Business.</li><li>The user makes a request that requires action through a custom plugin. Use custom plugins to integrate third-party applications.</li></ol><h2>Use Amazon Q Business to improve enterprise productivity</h2><p>Amazon Q Business, offers numerous practical applications across enterprise functions.

It‚Äôs simple and fast, but struggles with nuanced language or evolving user intent. The system can‚Äôt adapt on the fly. It just follows predefined instructions.\nOn the other hand, an agentic workflow introduces flexibility and adaptability. AI agents dynamically interpret user inputs, construct queries intelligently, and adjust their approach based on the context of the interaction and feedback received. This allows them to handle more complex, ambiguous requests while improving reliability and user experience.</p><h2><strong>What Makes Up an AI Agent</strong></h2><p>To build an effective AI agent for product catalog search, the following components are essential:</p><ul><li>Input Handling: Accepts and interprets user requests.</li><li>Feedback Handling and Memory: Incorporates user and system feedback to improve future interactions and maintains memory of past interactions.</li><li>Tools: Interfaces with external tools or databases to execute tasks.</li><li>Reasoning: Analyzes input and feedback to make informed decisions.</li></ul><p>To build such an agent, we need an execution environment. Let‚Äôs explore how Enthusiast can serve as an effective option.</p><p>Most LangChain tutorials stop at toy examples or require heavy customization to support real-world workflows. Enthusiast changes that. It‚Äôs built from the ground up to support:</p><ul><li>Tool-based agents with LangChain and ReAct</li><li>SQL-backed querying with Django or external sources</li><li>Structured memory and retry logic out of the box</li><li>Open-source, customizable behavior</li><li>Self-hosting with cloud/local model support</li></ul><p>Whether you're debugging search in a product catalog or surfacing relevant documents across internal departments, Enthusiast gives you a working foundation in minutes with real production logic, not just playground demos.</p><p>Alright, now let‚Äôs bring that to life. We‚Äôll walk through a real case: spinning up a local environment, loading data, and creating a self-correcting LangChain agent that actually understands and interacts with your product catalog.</p><p><strong>Setting Up the Development Environment</strong></p><p>To get started, you need to set up your development environment by cloning the Enthusiast starter repository and using its Docker configuration.</p><ol><li><p>Clone the repository:<code>git clone https://github.com/upsidelab/enthusiast-starter</code></p></li><li><p>Navigate into the repository directory:</p></li><li><p>Copy default configuration file and add your own OpenAI API key:<code>cp config/env.sample config/env</code><code>echo OPENAI_API_KEY=xxxx &gt;&gt; config/env</code></p></li><li><p>Build and run the Docker containers:</p></li></ol><p>You‚Äôll be prompted to create your first dataset. Give it a name, for example, ‚ÄúMy Dataset‚Äù. </p><p><strong>Import a Sample Product Dataset</strong>\nEnthusiast comes with a sample set of products that can be useful if you want to get started quickly. In this case, we have a set of products that represent different phone and mobile plans - with varying internet speeds, data limits, landline access, cable TV options, and more. They make a great test case for experimenting with different approaches to agentic product recommendations. </p><p>Let‚Äôs import this into our dataset:</p><ol><li>Click on ‚ÄúAdd Source‚Äù in the top-right corner of the screen.</li><li>From the dropdown, select ‚ÄúProduct source‚Äù.</li><li>A popup will appear for configuring the source.</li><li>Select ‚ÄúSample Product Source‚Äù from the list and click ‚ÄúAdd‚Äù.</li><li>You should now see it listed under configured sources.</li><li>Repeat the same process for documents by selecting ‚ÄúDocument source‚Äù from the dropdown.</li><li>This time, choose ‚ÄúSample Document Source‚Äù as the type and add it as well.</li></ol><p>Enthusiast will automatically index the dataset so it‚Äôs searchable right away.</p><p>Once the data is loaded, you can go to the Products tab to verify that the sample data was successfully imported and indexed. This ensures that your dataset is ready for querying by the agent.</p><h2><strong>Create a Custom Agent Structure</strong></h2><p>Now that your product catalog is loaded, it‚Äôs time to build an agent that can operate on it. Enthusiast supports extending and modifying agent behavior through the enthusiast_custom directory in the project.</p><ol><li><p>Inside the enthusiast-starter repository, locate the src/enthusiast_custom directory. This is the package that contains your custom agents and plugins. This code will be bundled by the Dockerfile and automatically installed into your Enthusiast instance.</p></li><li><p>Let‚Äôs also install a plugin that provides a reusable base implementation for a ReAct-style agent. Run the following command inside the src/ directory to add the plugin:<code>poetry add enthusiast-agent-re-act</code></p></li><li><p>Then, create a new directory inside enthusiast_custom, calling it for example product_search. Inside this directory, add an empty .py file to make it a Python package. This is where you‚Äôll define your agent‚Äôs implementation.</p></li><li><p>Add your new agent to the config/settings_override.py file so that Enthusiast can recognize it. Update the AVAILABLE_AGENTS dictionary to include your custom module:</p></li></ol><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><ol><li>You can now rebuild and restart your Docker Compose setup to apply these changes:\n<code>docker compose up --build</code></li></ol><p>Once the application is restarted, you‚Äôll see your new agent listed in the UI on the left. Time to give it some logic.</p><h2><strong>Step 1 ‚Äì Generate an SQL Query</strong></h2><p>We‚Äôll start with a basic implementation that generates an SQL query and executes it on the product catalog indexed in Enthusiast. The agent will reason through user queries and interact with the catalog to retrieve relevant results.</p><p>To do this, we‚Äôll use the enthusiast-agent-re-act plugin that we added earlier. It provides a BaseReActAgent class, which defines the core structure of a ReAct-style agent, including how it connects prompts, tools, memory, and output processing.</p><p>Here‚Äôs how we‚Äôll structure the product_search agent module:</p><p>Start by defining the agent class. In a basic scenario, no overrides are required - agent‚Äôs default implementation will respond to user‚Äôs queries by creating an agent executor configured with tools and memory, and will pass the user‚Äôs request there.\nHere‚Äôs what the simplest implementation looks like:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p><code>product_search/product_search_tool.py</code></p><p>Next, implement a tool the agent can use to run SQL queries against your product catalog.</p><p>Let‚Äôs first declare the expected input schema using a Pydantic model. This schema will be provided to the agent together with the tool definition, to let the agent determine what‚Äôs needed to call this tool. Since we specify that the tool requires an SQL query, the agent will try to produce one based on everything it knows so far in order to invoke it.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>This tool receives an SQL string from the agent, executes it using Django‚Äôs ORM, serializes the resulting product objects, and returns a message with the result. The NAME and DESCRIPTION fields in the tool definition help the agent determine when this tool is relevant to the current task. </p><p>Here‚Äôs a basic version of the tool implementation:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Then, create the system prompt that will guide how the agent reasons and interacts with tools. Add the following:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Finally, wire everything together in the config file. This tells Enthusiast which components make up your agent:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Once these components are in place and the Docker container is rebuilt, try executing a sample query:\nWhat‚Äôs the best plan for a small family?<p>\nThe agent will reason about the input, construct an SQL query, and invoke the search tool, likely failing due to invalid schema or search criteria. Let‚Äôs see what we can do with that.</p></p><h2><strong>Step 2 ‚Äì Let the Agent Handle Its Own Errors</strong></h2><p>In the initial version, if the SQL query generated by the agent was incorrect, the tool would simply fail without giving the agent any indication of what went wrong. We can improve this by modifying the tool to catch SQL errors and return the error message as part of the response.</p><p>This way, the agent can treat the error as feedback and make another attempt, refining the query on its own.</p><p>To do this, update the run method in ProductSearchTool as follows:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>With this change, when the SQL query fails, the agent gets the error message and can use it to revise its approach. Since the agent maintains memory of previous steps, it can iterate on its output to try and produce a valid query.</p><p>Try running the same query again:\nWhat‚Äôs the best plan for a small family?</p><p>If the first attempt fails, the agent will receive the error, analyze it, and try to generate a better query.</p><h2><strong>Step 3 ‚Äì Help the Agent Understand the Data</strong></h2><p>Letting the agent correct its own mistakes is helpful, but trial and error can be inefficient. Instead of waiting for the agent to fail and recover, we can give it a clearer understanding of the data structure up front.</p><p>One simple way to do this is by including a few sample rows from the product catalog directly in the prompt. This helps the agent understand both the schema and the shape of the data, which improves its chances of generating valid queries from the start.</p><p>To add this context, let‚Äôs override the get_answer method in your agent like this:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>This method will use functionality provided by the base class to build a LangChain-based agent executor, pass the input to it, and return the response to the user. One important change here is that besides user‚Äôs input (passed as input_text ), it will also pull a few sample products from the database and will inject them into the agent‚Äôs system prompt as sample_products.</p><p>In your prompt template (prompt.py), add this placeholder at the end:\nHere are some sample products in the database: {sample_products}</p><p>This additional context will be included with every call to the agent. It initializes the agent with a basic understanding of the structure and shape of the data, which makes it easier for the agent to construct accurate queries from the start.\nLet‚Äôs give it a try.</p><p>You should notice that the agent now constructs queries that better match how the data is shaped. For example, it may use the category column to search for plans labeled as ‚ÄúHome,‚Äù or rely on the properties column to filter for plans with specific internet speeds.</p><h2><strong>Step 4 ‚Äì Retry When No Results Are Found</strong></h2><p>Even if the agent is capable of generating valid SQL queries and has seen sample data, there‚Äôs still a chance it will produce a query that technically runs but returns no results.</p><p>In the current implementation, when that happens, the tool simply returns an empty list, and the agent assumes there are no relevant options. But in reality, the issue may be with how the agent built the query, not with a lack of products.</p><p>To address this, we can update the tool to return a clear message when no products are found‚Äîencouraging the agent to try a different approach. Here‚Äôs how the updated run method might look:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>With this change, the agent receives explicit feedback when a query returns no matches. It can then choose to revise the query and try again with broader or alternative criteria.</p><p>This gives the agent an opportunity to step back and reconsider its assumptions, leading to better resilience and more accurate results when dealing with uncertain or ambiguous user requests.</p><h2><strong>Step 5 ‚Äì Respect the Expected Number of Results</strong></h2><p>In some cases, a user might indicate how many products they want to see‚Äîperhaps just one recommendation or the top three matches. Right now, the agent doesn‚Äôt take that into account. It may return a long list of results, even if the user only wanted a few.</p><p>We can improve this by passing the expected number of results as part of the tool input. The tool will then check whether the number of matches exceeds this limit. If it does, it will prompt the agent to follow up and narrow the criteria.</p><p>First, update the input schema to include this new parameter:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>This addition helps turn the agent into a more effective product search assistant. Instead of assuming that the initial results are appropriate, the agent now reflects on the quantity of data returned, checks it against user expectations, and adjusts accordingly. This creates a more collaborative flow where the agent and user refine the query together to land on a relevant result.</p><h2><strong>Step 6 ‚Äì Enable the Agent to Finalize a Purchase</strong></h2><p>Once the user finds a plan that matches their needs, the next logical step is to help them act on it. Right now, our agent can recommend products but doesn‚Äôt support any kind of checkout process.</p><p>To make this possible, we‚Äôll give the agent the ability to generate a contract URL the user can follow to finalize their purchase. This effectively allows the agent to transition from discovery to action.</p><p>Start by creating a new tool, PurchaseTool, which accepts a plan_sku and returns a contract finalization link:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Lastly, modify the search tool‚Äôs return message slightly to encourage the agent to propose a contract. The agent will likely figure it out even without this hint, but there‚Äôs no harm in pushing it more explicitly:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>With this addition, your agent becomes a guided assistant that helps the user discover a suitable plan and smoothly transition into completing the purchase.</p><h2><strong>Step 7 ‚Äì Ask for Additional Customer Details</strong></h2><p>Before the agent pushes the user to sign a contract, it can also ensure that it collects any additional information needed to complete the process‚Äîsuch as the customer‚Äôs name and location.\nTo support this, update the PurchaseToolInput schema with two new fields:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Thanks to the structured schema and tool description, the agent will know that it must collect these inputs from the user before invoking the tool. If the information isn‚Äôt provided initially, the agent can follow up with questions like:</p><p>Could you tell me your name and zip code so I can finalize the contract?</p><p>This closes the loop and ensures that the agent not only helps discover the right plan but can also guide the user through to a complete and personalized purchase process.</p><p>In this walkthrough, we explored how to build a practical AI agent for product catalog search using Enthusiast. Starting from a basic ReAct-style agent capable of generating SQL queries, we incrementally introduced more sophisticated behaviors:</p><ul><li>Error recovery through exception feedback</li><li>Schema-aware reasoning via sample data</li><li>Retry logic when no results are found</li><li>Adapting results to match user expectations</li><li>Finalizing user purchases with structured follow-up</li><li>Collecting required customer details before contract generation</li></ul><p>Each step was designed to bring the agent closer to an experience that feels like a helpful, iterative assistant.</p>","contentLength":15576,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Speed up delivery of ML workloads using Code Editor in Amazon SageMaker Unified Studio","url":"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/speed-up-delivery-of-ml-workloads-using-code-editor-in-amazon-sagemaker-unified-studio/","date":1755807875,"author":"Paul Hargis","guid":235895,"unread":true,"content":"<p><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/unified-studio/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Amazon SageMaker Unified Studio</a> is a single integrated development environment (IDE) that brings together your data tools for analytics and AI. As part of the next generation of <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Amazon SageMaker</a>, it contains integrated tooling for building data pipelines, sharing datasets, monitoring data governance, running SQL analytics, building artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML) models, and creating generative AI applications. Recently, AWS announced two additional options that enhance the development experience for analytics, ML, and generative AI teams: <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2025/05/code-editor-vs-code-open-source-sagemaker-unified-studio/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Code Editor and multiple spaces</a>. These new IDE options can help developers and data scientists speed up delivery of ML workloads by offering familiar IDE layouts, using popular extensions to enhance development, and using critical debug and test options, all within a unified environment.</p><p>Code Editor, based on Code-OSS (Visual Studio Code ‚Äì Open Source), provides a lightweight and powerful IDE with familiar shortcuts and terminal access, along with advanced debugging capabilities and refactoring tools. The VSCode IDE, and Code-OSS variants like Code Editor, remain the most <a href=\"https://visualstudiomagazine.com/articles/2023/06/28/so-2023.aspx\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">popular</a> development tool in recent years. Teams can boost their productivity by accessing thousands of Code Editor-compatible extensions from the <a href=\"https://open-vsx.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Open VSX extension</a> gallery. The Code Editor IDE within SageMaker Unified Studio supports version control and cross-team collaboration through GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket repositories, while offering preconfigured SageMaker distribution for popular ML frameworks.</p><p>Within SageMaker Unified Studio, a  is a work environment that runs a particular IDE. To maximize the benefits of Code Editor alongside other coding interfaces in SageMaker Unified Studio, including JupyterLab, SageMaker now supports multiple spaces per user per project. With multiple spaces, users can manage parallel workstreams with different computational needs. Each space maintains a 1-to-1 relationship with an application instance, so users can efficiently organize their storage and resource requirements. This enhancement provides the flexibility to access multiple applications and instances simultaneously, improving workflow management and productivity.</p><p>In this post, we walk through how you can use the new Code Editor and multiple spaces support in SageMaker Unified Studio. The sample solution shows how to develop an ML pipeline that automates the typical end-to-end ML activities to build, train, evaluate, and (optionally) deploy an ML model.</p><h2>Features of Code Editor in SageMaker Unified Studio</h2><p>Code Editor offers a unique set of features to increase the productivity of your ML team:</p><ul><li><strong>Fully managed infrastructure</strong> ‚Äì The Code Editor IDE runs on fully managed infrastructure. SageMaker takes care of keeping the instances up-to-date with the latest security patches and upgrades.</li><li><strong>Dial resources up and down</strong> ‚Äì With Code Editor, you can seamlessly change the underlying resources (such as instance type or EBS volume size) on which Code Editor is running. This is beneficial for developers who want to run workloads with changing compute, memory, and storage needs.</li><li><strong>SageMaker provided images</strong> ‚Äì Code Editor is preconfigured with <a href=\"https://github.com/aws/sagemaker-distribution\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Amazon SageMaker Distribution</a> as the default image. This container image has the most popular ML frameworks supported by SageMaker, along with the <a href=\"https://pypi.org/project/sagemaker-studio/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">SageMaker Studio SDK</a>, <a href=\"https://sagemaker.readthedocs.io/en/stable/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">SageMaker Python SDK</a>, <a href=\"https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/index.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Boto3</a>, and other AWS and data science specific libraries installed. This significantly reduces the time you spend setting up your environment and decreases the complexity of managing package dependencies in your ML project.</li><li> ‚Äì Code Editor also comes with generative AI capabilities powered by <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/q/developer/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Amazon Q Developer</a>. You can boost your productivity by generating inline code suggestions within the IDE. In addition, you can use Amazon Q chat to ask questions about building at AWS and for assistance with software development. Amazon Q can explain coding concepts and code snippets, generate code and unit tests, and improve code, including debugging or refactoring.</li><li><strong>Extensions and configuration settings </strong>‚Äì Code Editor also includes persistence of installed extensions and configuration settings.</li></ul><p>When you open Code Editor, you will notice that the space has been bootstrapped with the current state of your project‚Äôs repository. Navigate to the file explorer, and you will find a  Jupyter notebook, as shown in the following screenshot.</p><p>You can choose  to execute this notebook. Select  when prompted to select the kernel and then choose the recommended Python environment named . Now the  notebook will be executed, and you can explore the output of the various cells.</p><h2>Architecture of Code Editor in SageMaker Unified Studio</h2><p>When you open Code Editor in SageMaker Unified Studio, it creates an application container that runs on an <a href=\"http://aws.amazon.com/ec2\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud</a> (Amazon EC2) instance. This instance type matches your selection during Code Editor space configuration. The underlying infrastructure management happens automatically in a service-managed account controlled by SageMaker Unified Studio. The following diagram shows the infrastructure as it relates to end-users and how instances are provisioned. User A has configured two spaces, and User B is using a single space. Both users have the option to create additional spaces as needed. Currently, these spaces are isolated private environments, with shared space functionality planned for a future release.</p><p>SageMaker Unified Studio lets you create multiple spaces with Code Editor or JupyterLab as the IDE, each configurable with different ML instance types, including those with accelerated computing capabilities. For each space, you must specify three core elements: the EBS volume size, your chosen instance type, and the application type you want to run (such as Code Editor or JupyterLab). When you initiate a space, SageMaker Unified Studio automatically provisions a compute instance and launches a SageMaker Unified Studio Code Editor application using your specified container image. The storage system is designed for continuity: your EBS volume persists across sessions, even when you stop and restart the IDE. This means that when you stop the Code Editor application to save on computing costs, although the compute resources shut down, your EBS volume is preserved. Upon restart, the system automatically reattaches this volume, so your work remains intact.</p><p>In the following sections, we show how to develop an ML project with Code Editor on SageMaker Unified Studio. For this example, we run through a Jupyter notebook that creates an ML pipeline using <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/pipelines/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Amazon SageMaker Pipelines</a>, which automates the usual tasks of building, training, and (optionally) deploying a model.</p><p>In this scenario, Code Editor can be used by an ML engineering team who needs advanced IDE features to test and debug their code, create and execute a pipeline, and monitor the status in SageMaker Unified Studio.</p><p>To prepare your organization to use the new Code Editor IDE and multiple spaces support in SageMaker Unified Studio, complete the following prerequisite steps:</p><p>By default, authentication and authorization for a SageMaker Unified Studio domain is controlled through IAM Identity Center, which can only be configured in a single AWS Region that must be the same Region as your SageMaker domain. See <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker-unified-studio/latest/adminguide/setting-up.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Setting up Amazon SageMaker Unified Studio</a> for additional information.</p><ol start=\"3\"><li>Create a SageMaker Unified Studio domain using the <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker-unified-studio/latest/adminguide/create-domain-sagemaker-unified-studio-quick.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">quick setup</a>. A virtual private cloud (VPC) is required; one will be created for you (if needed) during setup.</li><li>After you create the domain, you can enable access to SageMaker Unified Studio for users with single sign-on (SSO) credentials through IAM Identity Center by choosing  next to <strong>Configure SSO user access </strong>in the <strong>Next steps for your domain </strong>section.</li></ol><ol start=\"5\"><li>After you configure user access for your newly created domain, navigate to the SageMaker Unified Studio URL and log in using SSO.</li></ol><p>You can find the URL on the SageMaker console, as shown in the following screenshot.</p><p>By default, IAM Identity Center requires multi-factor authentication on user accounts, and you might be prompted to configure this upon first login to SageMaker Unified Studio, as shown in the following screenshot. For more details about this requirement, refer to <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/singlesignon/latest/userguide/user-device-registration.html?icmpid=docs_sso_user_portal\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Registering your device for MFA</a>.</p><ol start=\"6\"><li>After you log in, choose  and follow the prompts to create your first SageMaker Unified Studio project. We choose the  project profile during setup.</li></ol><p>After you create a project, you can create your space (an IDE) in which Code Editor will be provisioned.</p><ol start=\"7\"><li>On the  tab of the project, choose , then enter a name and choose .</li></ol><ol start=\"8\"><li>When the  column indicates the space is , open the space to be redirected to Code Editor.</li></ol><h2>Interacting with AWS services directly from your IDE</h2><p>The AWS Toolkit for Visual Studio Code uses the permissions of the <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/iam/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">AWS Identity and Access Management</a> (IAM) role assigned to the project. You can find the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the project role on the project details page, as shown in the following screenshot.</p><h2>Use Code Editor to create and execute an ML pipeline in SageMaker</h2><p>In this section, we upload and execute a Jupyter notebook that creates and starts a machine learning operations (MLOps) pipeline orchestrated with SageMaker Pipelines. The pipeline we create follows a typical ML application pattern of data preprocessing, training, evaluation, model creation, transformation, and model registration, as illustrated in the following diagram.</p><p>Begin by uploading the sample notebook directly into Code Editor. You can drag and drop the notebook, or right-click and choose in the file explorer pane.</p><p>You can download and run sample notebooks using standard  commands from the GitHub repository where these notebooks are located. Running the Full Pipeline notebook sample requires a few extra IAM role permissions other than the defaults assigned when the SageMaker Unified Studio project is created. The Quick Pipeline can be run as-is with the default IAM permissions.</p><h2>Region availability, cost, and limitations</h2><p>Code Editor and multiple spaces support are available in supported SageMaker Unified Studio domains. For more information about Regions where these features are available, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker-unified-studio/latest/adminguide/supported-regions.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Regions where Amazon SageMaker Unified Studio is supported</a>. Code Editor will be provisioned within a SageMaker space and run on a user-selectable instance type, anywhere from ultra low-cost instances (ml.t3.medium) up to highly performant GPU-based instances (G6 instance family).</p><p>The primary cost associated with running a Code Editor space is tied directly to the underlying compute instance type. The hourly costs for ML instance types can found on the <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker-ai/pricing/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Amazon SageMaker AI pricing page</a> on the  tab. To prevent unnecessary charges, the space will be automatically shut down after a configurable timeout when the space is idle (see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/APIReference/API_SpaceIdleSettings.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">SpaceIdleSettings</a>). There will also be minimal charges tied to storage for the EBS volume that is attached to the Code Editor space.</p><p>At launch, Code Editor spaces can be configured to use a particular SageMaker Distribution image, either version 2.6 or 3.1. Additional major and minor releases of the SageMaker Distribution will be added over time.</p><p>To avoid incurring additional charges, delete the resources created from following this post. This includes any development environments created, such as Code Editor or JupyterLab spaces, which you can delete by navigating to the  navigation pane, choosing the  tab, choosing the options menu (three vertical dots) aligned with the space, and choosing . You can remove project resources by <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker-unified-studio/latest/userguide/delete-project.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">deleting the project</a>, which can be done from the SageMaker Unified Studio console. There is no charge for a SageMaker Unified Studio domain, but you can optionally delete this from the SageMaker AI console. If you created IAM Identity Center users that you no longer need, delete the users from the IAM Identity Center console.</p><p>The addition of the new Code Editor IDE to SageMaker Unified Studio provides a familiar working environment to thousands of data scientists and developers. With this powerful IDE, data scientists can more quickly build, train, tune, and deploy their ML models and push them into production where they can get measurable ROI. With thousands of pre-tested extensions through the VSX Registry, developers will have improved usability and productivity as they build and deploy their generative AI applications.</p><p>In addition, SageMaker Unified Studio now supports multiple spaces per user per project. These new environment options can help MLOps personas segregate workloads, isolate compute resources, and increase productivity through parallelized workstreams. Together, these enhancements help data science teams work more efficiently in bringing ML and generative AI solutions into production, where they can begin to reap the benefits of their work.</p><p>To get started using SageMaker Unified Studio, refer to the <a href=\"https://catalog.us-east-1.prod.workshops.aws/workshops/06dbe60c-3a94-463e-8ac2-18c7f85788d4/en-US\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Amazon SageMaker Workshop</a>.

I hope it is readable enough.]</p><p>CRYSTALS (\"Cryptographic Suite for Algebraic Lattices\") is post-quantum public key encryption scheme, meaning it is expected to be secure even at the era of quantum computing where many current PKE-variants fail.</p><p>CRYSTALS consists of two cryptographic primitives: Kyber and Dilithium. Kyber is key exchange method, i.e. asymmetric encryption providing secure channel to change secrets, and Dilithium is a cryptographic signing method. We will explore the mathematics behind these algorithms by coding them in Python as we go. You can find the code from my <a href=\"https://github.com/CodeFromTheDeepEnd/CRYSTALS-Learning-Resources\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">GitHub repo</a>.</p><p>The reader is assumed certain maturity in mathematics and basic understanding of Python. We don't prove anything, instead the focus is to introduce and build needed machinery that we will use later. \nThe mathematical part of this presentation follows closely the way Alfred Menezes presents it in his excellent <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h5pfTIE6slU&amp;ab_channel=Cryptography101\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">video series</a> on the topic.</p><p>When we say two integers \n\n\n and \n\n are congruent modulo \n\n we mean \n\n is a integer multiple of \n\n  In this case we write </p>\nWith \n\n we mean \n\n is the remainder of integer \n\n divided \n\n This implies \n<p>\n is the ring of integers modulo \n\n  In this ring addition and multiplication are performed modulo \n</p><p>We implement integers in \n\n in class Zq. Notice the Python modulo-operation % is implemented in a way that is fully compatible with our needs because it can handle negative values correctly. The instantiation can be done with integer value or with an instance of Zq.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>The class Zq has addition, subtraction, multiplication, str and repr operations implemented. This makes our life a lot easier because we can make arithmetics directly and debug when needed.</p><p>To get a feeling how things work, consider the ring \n\n For example we have \n</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Let \n\n be a prime.

The quotient ring (often called just \"polynomial ring\") \n\n consists of polynomials in \n\n of degree less than \n\n In ring \n\n the multiplication of polynomials is performed modulo the polynomial \n\n called the reduction polynomial. This means that the product of polynomials \n\n is defined as the remainder \n\n of their product when divided by \n\n in the polynomial ring. Notice that by definition now degree of \n\n is at most \n\n and \n</p><p>One should notice here that remainder is not calculated by the traditional polynomial division algorithm, but with division rules that apply in the polynomial ring. For our purposes it suffices to acknowledge that if the polynomial has degrees \n\n you can apply the rules \n</p>\n and in general for \n\n and then simplify the resulting polynomial normally. To understand why, please visit ring theory and ideals.\n\n<p>Overloading addition and subtraction is straightforward, but multiplication needs special treatment. Here we utilize the fact that Zq has multiplication operation overloaded. In real-life implementations this naive implementation is too slow and NTT-algorithm is used instead.

Consider the polynomial \n</p><p>The obvious way to write that as a vector is \n\n (convention is to use column vectors). The polynomial addition is now component-wise addition modulo \n\n and subtraction is component-wise subtraction modulo \n\n Multiplication is polynomial multiplication as shown earlier and the resulting polynomial is stored in a vector. </p><p>We used this implicitly earlier when defining ZqPolynomial.</p><p>We extend this notation. Let \n\n be a positive integer. Module \n\n consists of length \n\n vectors of polynomials of \n\n. Addition and subtraction is again component-wise. It follows that the resulting vectors in both cases is in \n</p><p>We will later use \n\n to represent \n\n-matrices with polynomial entries. This extension is similar to that from vectors to matrices in linear algebra.</p><p>The module \n\n includes \n\n-matrices with elements from the polynomial ring. The easiest way to handle these is to define class PolyMatrix that holds ZqPolynomials in a list of lists.</p><p>The multiplication in \n\n is defined as inner product of two vectors in \n\n This means that the polynomials, that are elements of the vector in \n\n are multiplied in \n\n and added together. The result is in \n</p>\nand \n\n We get directly \n\n and in Python as follows.<div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Using the \n\n and \n\n defined earlier, we get </p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>To enable matrix multiplication, we implemented the matmul operator.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>We can use the bracket-notation with PolyMatrix because we defined getitem and setitem methods. </p><p>Next we need notion of size that will become useful later.

The <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/model-parameters-titan-embed-text.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Amazon Titan Text Embeddings</a> model is optimized for text retrieval to enable Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG). Instead of processing massive documents at the same time, we used chunking strategies to improve retrieval. We used a chunk size of 1,000 with an overlapping window of 150‚Äì200 for best results. Chunking combined with page boundaries is a simple yet highly effective approach. Sentence window retrieval also returns accurate results.</p><p>Prompting techniques play a crucial role in obtaining effective results. For example, instead of ‚Äúguidelines for smart meter installation,‚Äù an expanded prompt such as ‚Äúinstructions, procedures, regulations, and best practices along with agent experiences for installation of a smart meter‚Äù yields better results.</p><p>This architecture implements comprehensive security measures across the components. We use <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/secrets-manager/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">AWS Secrets Manager</a> to securely store and manage sensitive credentials, API keys, and database passwords, with automatic rotation policies in place. S3 buckets are encrypted using <a href=\"http://aws.amazon.com/kms\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">AWS Key Management Service</a> (AWS KMS) with AES-256 encryption, and versioning is enabled for audit purposes. Personally identifiable information (PII) is handled with extreme care‚Äî PII data is encrypted and access is strictly controlled through <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/iam/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">AWS Identity and Access Management</a> (IAM) policies and AWS KMS. For OpenSearch Serverless implementation, we make sure data is encrypted both at rest using AWS KMS and in transit using TLS 1.2. Session management includes timeout for inactive sessions, requiring re-authentication for continued access. The system interacts with access control list (ACL) data stored in DynamoDB through a secure middleware layer, where the DynamoDB table is encrypted at rest using AWS managed KMS keys. Data transmissions between services are encrypted in transit using TLS 1.2, and we maintain end-to-end encryption across our entire infrastructure. Access controls are granularly defined and regularly audited through <a href=\"http://aws.amazon.com/cloudtrail\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">AWS CloudTrail</a>.</p><h2><strong>Implementing role-based access control</strong></h2><p>We used three different personas to implement role-based access control: an administrator with full access, a technical desk analyst with a medium level of access, and a technical agent with minimal access. We used OpenSearch Serverless collections to manage different access levels. Different call transcripts are ingested into different collections; this is to enable user access to the content they are authorized to based on their roles. A list of user IDs and their roles and allowed access are stored in a DynamoDB table along with the OpenSearch collection and index name.</p><p>We used the  method in a <a href=\"https://streamlit.io/generative-ai\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Streamlit</a> authenticator to retrieve the user ID.</p><h2>User interface and agent experience</h2><p>We used Streamlit as a frontend framework to build the TECHNICAL HELP DESK, with access to the content controlled by the user‚Äôs role. The UI features an FAQ section displayed at the top of the main page and a search metrics insights section in the sidebar, as shown in the following screenshot.</p><p>The UI includes the following components:</p><ul><li> ‚Äì The conversation section contains interactions between the user and the help desk assistant. Users can provide feedback by choosing either the like or dislike button for each response received, as shown in the following screenshot. This feedback is persisted in a DynamoDB table.</li></ul><ul><li>‚Äì As shown in the following screenshot, the sidebar contains metrics information, including: \n  <ul><li>Number of queries in the last week</li><li>Number of total transcripts</li><li>Number of transcripts added in the last week</li><li>Number of helpful responses generated</li><li>Number of misses (no answer found)</li></ul></li></ul><p>These fields are updated asynchronously after each user query. Additional metrics are also stored, such as sentiment, tone of the speakers, nature of responses generated, and satisfaction percentage.</p><ul><li>‚Äì The queries are stored in a DynamoDB table along with a query count column. When the help desk agent signs in, the queries with the most counts are displayed in this section, as shown in the following table.</li></ul><table border=\"1px\" cellpadding=\"10px\"><tbody><tr></tr><tr></tr><tr></tr></tbody></table><p>The  column is created as the global secondary index to retrieve the top five FAQs.</p><p>After the user submits a query, the technical help desk fetches the top similar items from the knowledge base. This is compared with the user‚Äôs query and, when a match is found, the  column is incremented.</p><p>We used the  function in Streamlit to store the valid results in memory. The results are persisted across the user sessions.</p><p>The caching function employs an internal hashing mechanism that can be overridden if required. The cached data can be stored either in memory or on disk. Additionally, we can set the data persistence duration as needed for the use case. Cache invalidation or updates can be done when the data changes or after every hour. This, along with the FAQ section, has significantly enhanced performance of the technical help desk, creating faster response times and improving the user experience for customers and support agents.</p><p>In this post, we showed you how we built a generative AI application to significantly reduce call handling times, automate repetitive tasks, and improve the overall quality of technical support.</p><p>The enterprise AI assistant from the <a href=\"https://www.infosys.com/services/data-ai-topaz/offerings/agentic-foundry.htmly\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Infosys Agentic Foundry</a>, part of Infosys Topaz, now handles 70% of the previously human-managed calls.

Each simulation request to the compute server took a whole minute (~60 seconds) to complete, which incidentally exasperated the resource limits of the deployment.</p><p>In this article, we'll discuss the steps that I took to make the application virtually infinitely scalable (i.e., no server compute bottleneck) thanks to sub-second client-side execution. <em>That's faster than a page load!</em> üî•</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Simulating Course Match with CourseCast\n</h2><p>On simulation day, the Course Match algorithm determines the  for all offered courses based on their supply and demand. Upon completion, Course Match will have been able to assign schedules to each student (in a single round!) such that the course utilities and obtained credits are maximized given the student's respective budget constraints.</p><blockquote><p>üí° You can think of Course Match as an autonomous shopper that \"buys\" courses on behalf of the student. The purchasing power is only limited by the student's token budget, their maximum workload/credits, and their assigned utilities. The higher the token budget, the greater the student's capability to \"afford\" the clearing price for a course.</p></blockquote><p>Since it's impossible to know ahead of time what the actual clearing prices will be, CourseCast instead forecasts the clearing prices based on the most recent historical data of actual clearing prices in previous Course Match runs. These predicted prices (and their statistical variances) are the \"weights\" of the model trained on the latest course and instructor trends.</p><p>To account for forecast uncertainty, the CourseCast model assumes that the predicted clearing price is a normally distributed random variable. As such, CourseCast runs 100 Monte Carlo simulations and counts the frequency of particular courses and schedule configurations being selected. These simulation results are presented to the user as a probability.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  So where was the bottleneck?\n</h2><p>The original CourseCast 2024 was prototyped and deployed as a <a href=\"https://streamlit.io/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Streamlit</a> application written in Python. Students would input their course utilities and submit their simulation request to the Streamlit Community Cloud where:</p><ul><li>The Python back end on <em>shared virtual compute resources</em> would parse course data and load model weights from a hosted Excel spreadsheet.</li><li>The service would recompute all of the scheduling conflicts between courses (~200 in total). Example: classes with overlapping schedules, classes with overlapping sections, and other logistical constraints.</li><li>Run 100 Monte Carlo simulations . Each of which is an instance of a linear programming solver.</li></ul><p>As CourseCast went viral among thousands of UPenn students, the scalability cracks began to show. When too many concurrent users hammered the Streamlit application, students couldn't run their simulations.</p><p>To be fair, the application was on the Streamlit free tier, but it was definitely high time for a rewrite to something more production-grade.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  So how did we scale CourseCast 2025?\n</h2><p>Now that we know where the bottlenecks are, let's tackle them one by one.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Scrapping the Python Server\n</h3><p>My first instinct was to ask: <em>is Python necessary at all?</em> The Monte Carlo simulation was essentially a glorified  loop over a linear programming solver. Nothing about the core simulation logic was specific to Python. In fact, the only Python-specific implementation detail was the usage of Excel spreadsheet parser libraries and linear programming solver libraries for Python. I figured...</p><ul><li>If there was a way to package and compress the Excel spreadsheet in a web-friendly format, then there's nothing stopping us from loading the entire dataset in the browser! Sure enough, the <a href=\"https://parquet.apache.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Parquet</a> file format was specifically designed for efficient portability.</li><li>If there was an equivalent linear programming solver library in JavaScript, then there's nothing stopping us from running simulations in the browser! Sure enough, there was the <a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/yalps\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"></a> library (among many other options).</li></ul><p>At this point, I was fully convinced that we could scrap the Python server and compute the simulation entirely in the browser. This approach effectively allows us to infinitely scale our simulation capacity as we would no longer be constrained by shared cloud compute limits.</p><p>That solves our scalability problem! ‚úÖ</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Precomputing Static Course Conflicts\n</h3><p>The next bottleneck was the course conflict generation logic. Recall that  simulation request recomputes the logistical constraints on course selections (e.g., disallowing classes with overlapping schedules). This is fairly non-trivial work as there are hundreds of classes to consider.</p><p>So, naturally, the solution is to precompute these conflicts ahead of time. The precompute script takes the raw course data and appends the \"conflict groups\" of each course. These \"conflict groups\" ultimately determine the statically known logistical constraints of the linear programming solver.</p><blockquote><p>üìù In computer science parlance, you can think of these \"conflict groups\" as equivalence classes defined by the relation of overlapping course schedules. That is to say, for all pairs of courses within an equivalence class, their schedules must have a non-empty schedule intersection. Thus, a \"conflict group\" is just a label for a group of pairwise-intersecting courses.</p></blockquote><p>All of the course metadata, seeded random values, and conflict groups are embedded in a single compressed  file (~90 KiB) and served to the user via a CDN for efficient delivery and caching. There is also the option of caching the file in a <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Service_Worker_API\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Service Worker</a>, but the edge CDN already works well enough.</p><p>That solves our repeated work problem! ‚úÖ</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Offloading CPU-Bound Work to a Separate Thread\n</h3><p>The next bottleneck is the sequential execution of Monte Carlo simulation runs. There's actually no reason for us to run them sequentially because each sampled price prediction is independent from the 99 other trials. The simulation can thus be parallelized at the trial level.</p><p>Since each simulation run is primarily a linear programming solver, we know that the work is CPU-bound, not I/O-bound. The - model will  work here because <a href=\"https://dev.to/somedood/javascript-concurrency-avoiding-the-sequential-trap-7f0\">CPU-bound work blocks the event loop</a>. We  offload the work to another thread to keep the UI responsive.</p><p>In the browser, we only have one way to spawn multiple threads: through the <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Workers_API\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Web Worker API</a>.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>We can then wrap the worker message-passing logic in a  interface and leverage libraries like <a href=\"https://tanstack.com/query/latest\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">TanStack Query</a> for clean pending states in the UI. The example below uses React for demonstration, but this pattern is framework-agnostic.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>That solves our responsive UI problem! ‚úÖ</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Parallelizing with Worker Thread Pools\n</h3><p>A more advanced implementation of this one-shot request-response worker architecture leverages thread pools to send work to already initialized workers (as opposed to re-initializing them for each work request).</p><p>We can use <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Navigator/hardwareConcurrency\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><code>navigator.hardwareConcurrency</code></a> to determine the optimal number of worker threads to spawn in the pool. Spawning more workers than the maximum hardware concurrency is pointless because the hardware would not have enough cores to service that parallelism anyway.</p><blockquote><p>‚ö†Ô∏è In the previous section, the  was initialized by the  function. In a worker pool, this should instead be provided as an argument to the  function because  is no longer the \"owner\" of the thread resource and thus has no say in the worker lifetime. Worker termination  be the responsibility of the thread pool, not the sendWork function.</p></blockquote><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><blockquote><p>üìù Request cancellation is not implemented here for the sake of brevity, but it is fairly trivial to forward the <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/AbortSignal\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"></a> from TanStack Query into the thread pool. It's only a matter of terminating the workers upon receiving the  event.</p></blockquote><p>The thread pool optimization allowed us to run 100 simulations in parallel batches across all of the device's cores. Together with the precomputed conflict groups, the Monte Carlo simulation was effectively reduced from a minute to sub-second territory! üî•</p><p>That solves our performance problems! ‚úÖ</p><p>After all of these optimizations, I upgraded CourseCast from a prototype that struggled with a hundred concurrent users (with ~60 seconds per simulation request) to an infinitely scalable simulator with sub-second execution speeds (faster than a page load!).</p><p>CourseCast now guides 1000+ UPenn students to make informed decisions and (blazingly!) fast experiments about their course schedules. And we're just getting started! üöÄ</p><p>Throughout this work, I had a few key takeaways:</p><ul><li>Always leave the door open for the possibility of offloading compute to the browser. Modern Web APIs are highly capable with great browser support nowadays. Keep exploring ways to save ourselves from the infrastructure burden of bespoke Python services.</li><li>Always find opportunities to precompute static data. May it be through a precompute script like in CourseCast or a materialized view in the database, strive to do the least amount of repeated work.</li><li>Keep a sharp eye out for parallelizable work. There are many opportunities in data science and general scientific computing where data processing need not be sequential (e.g., dot products, seeded simulation runs, independent events, etc.).</li></ul><p>On a more human perspective, it's always a pleasure to have the code that I write be in service of others‚Äîespecially students! As software engineers, it's easy to forget about the human users at the other end of the screen. To be reminded of the positive impact of our code on others never fails to make our work all the more worth it.</p><blockquote><p><em>\"Have been hearing tons of amazing feedback.

Imagine a massive User table stuffed with profile details, login history, and billing information. Queries slow down as the database scans irrelevant columns for every request. Sound familiar? Let‚Äôs explore vertical partitioning‚Äîa powerful technique to streamline your database‚Äîand touch on caching for even faster data retrieval.</p><p><strong>What Is Vertical Partitioning?</strong></p><p>Vertical partitioning splits a wide table into smaller, focused tables based on usage patterns. Instead of one bloated User table, you create separate tables for specific data groups. This reduces the number of columns scanned during queries, boosting performance and minimizing disk I/O.\nFor example, suppose your User table stores:</p><p>Profile details: name, email, profile picture\nLogin history: last login timestamp, IP addresses<p>\nBilling information: billing address, payment details</p></p><p>As the table grows, even a simple query like fetching a user‚Äôs name forces the database to wade through all columns. Vertical partitioning solves this by splitting the table into:</p><div><pre><code>-- User_Profile table\nCREATE TABLE User_Profile (\n    user_id INT PRIMARY KEY,\n    name VARCHAR(100),\n    email VARCHAR(100),\n    profile_picture VARCHAR(255)\n);\n\n-- User_Login table\nCREATE TABLE User_Login (\n    user_id INT PRIMARY KEY,\n    last_login DATETIME,\n    ip_address VARCHAR(45)\n);\n\n-- User_Billing table\nCREATE TABLE User_Billing (\n    user_id INT PRIMARY KEY,\n    billing_address TEXT,\n    payment_details VARCHAR(255)\n)\n</code></pre></div><p>Each table now holds only the columns relevant to specific queries, making data retrieval faster and more efficient.</p><p>Flowchart: Visualizing Vertical Partitioning\nHere's an ASCII art representation of the vertical partitioning process for illustration:</p><p>+-------------------------+\n|      User Table         |<p>\n| - name                  |</p>\n| - email                 |<p>\n| - profile_picture       |</p>\n| - last_login            |<p>\n| - ip_address            |</p>\n| - billing_address       |<p>\n| - payment_details       |</p>\n+-------------------------+\n           | Split (Vertical Partitioning)\n    +-------------+   +-------------+   +-------------+<p>\n    |User_Profile |   | User_Login  |   |User_Billing |</p>\n    | - user_id   |   | - user_id  |   | - user_id  |<p>\n    | - name     |   | - last_login|   | - billing_ |</p>\n    | - email    |   | - ip_address|   |   address  |<p>\n    | - profile_ |   |             |   | - payment_ |</p>\n    |   picture  |   |             |   |   details  |<p>\n    +-------------+   +-------------+   +-------------+</p>\n           |\n+-------------------------+<p>\n|    Faster Queries       |</p>\n| (Reduced Disk I/O)      |<p>\n+-------------------------+</p></p><p>This visual shows how splitting the table streamlines data access.</p><p><strong>Taking It Further with Caching</strong></p><p>Vertical partitioning optimizes disk-based queries, but disk access is still slower than memory. Enter caching: storing frequently accessed data (e.g., user profiles) in memory using tools like Redis or Memcached. This delivers lightning-fast access for common queries, complementing the efficiency of partitioned tables.</p><ul><li><p>By combining vertical partitioning and caching, you can:</p></li><li><p>Improve query performance: Scan fewer columns and retrieve data faster.</p></li><li><p>Reduce resource usage: Lower disk I/O and server load.</p></li><li><p>Scale efficiently: Handle growing data without sacrificing speed.</p></li></ul><p>Ready to optimize your database? Analyze your tables‚Äô usage patterns, identify columns that can be partitioned, and consider caching for frequently accessed data. Experiment with these techniques in a test environment and watch your application‚Äôs performance soar!</p>","contentLength":3624,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Generative AI in the Real World: Understanding A2A with Heiko Hotz and Sokratis Kartakis","url":"https://www.oreilly.com/radar/podcast/generative-ai-in-the-real-world-understanding-a2a-with-heiko-hotz-and-sokratis-kartakis/","date":1755781961,"author":"Ben Lorica, Heiko Hotz and Sokratis Kartakis","guid":235710,"unread":true,"content":"<p>Everyone is talking about agents: single agents and, increasingly, multi-agent systems.

Why agent-to-agent communication? Some people might think we should focus on single-agent tooling first.</li><li><a href=\"https://cdn.oreillystatic.com/radar/generative-ai-real-world-podcast/GenAI_in_the_Real_World_with_Heiko_and%20_Sokratis.mp3#t=53\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">0:53</a>: Many developers start developing agents with completely different frameworks. At some point they want to link the agents together. One way is to change the code of your application. But it would be easier if you could get the agents talking the same language.&nbsp;</li><li><a href=\"https://cdn.oreillystatic.com/radar/generative-ai-real-world-podcast/GenAI_in_the_Real_World_with_Heiko_and%20_Sokratis.mp3#t=103\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">1:43</a>: Was A2A something developers approached you for?</li><li><a href=\"https://cdn.oreillystatic.com/radar/generative-ai-real-world-podcast/GenAI_in_the_Real_World_with_Heiko_and%20_Sokratis.mp3#t=113\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">1:53</a>: It is fair to say that A2A is a forward-looking protocol. We see a future where one team develops an agent that does something and another team in the same organization or even outside would like to leverage that capability. An agent is very different from an API. In the past, this was done via API. With agents, I need a stateful protocol where I send a task and the agent can run asynchronously in the background and do what it needs to do. That‚Äôs the justification for the A2A protocol. No one has explicitly asked for this, but we will be there in a few months time.&nbsp;</li><li><a href=\"https://cdn.oreillystatic.com/radar/generative-ai-real-world-podcast/GenAI_in_the_Real_World_with_Heiko_and%20_Sokratis.mp3#t=235\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">3:55</a>: For developers in this space, the most familiar is MCP, which is a single agent protocol focused on external tool integration. What is the relationship between MCP and A2A?</li><li><a href=\"https://cdn.oreillystatic.com/radar/generative-ai-real-world-podcast/GenAI_in_the_Real_World_with_Heiko_and%20_Sokratis.mp3#t=266\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">4:26</a>: We believe that MCP and A2A will be complementary and not rivals. MCP is specific to tools, and A2A connects agents with each other. That brings us to the question of when to wrap a functionality in a tool versus an agent. If we look at the technical implementation, that gives us some hints when to use each. An MCP tool exposes its capability by a structured schema: I need input A and B and I give you the sum. I can‚Äôt deviate from the schema. It‚Äôs also a single interaction. If I wrap the same functionality into an agent, the way I expose the functionality is different. A2A expects a natural language description of the agent‚Äôs functionality: ‚ÄúThe agent adds two numbers.‚Äù Also, A2A is stateful. I send a request and get a result. That gives developers a hint on when to use an agent and when to use a tool. I like to use the analogy of a vending machine versus a concierge. I put money into a vending machine and push a button and get something out. I talk to a concierge and say, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm thirsty; buy me something to drink.‚Äù</li><li><a href=\"https://cdn.oreillystatic.com/radar/generative-ai-real-world-podcast/GenAI_in_the_Real_World_with_Heiko_and%20_Sokratis.mp3#t=429\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">7:09</a>: Maybe we can help our listeners make the notion of A2A even more concrete. I tell nonexperts that you‚Äôre already using an agent to some extent. Deep research is an agent. I talk to people building AI tools in finance, and I have a notion that I want to research, but I have one agent looking at earnings, another looking at other data. Do you have a canonical example you use?</li><li><a href=\"https://cdn.oreillystatic.com/radar/generative-ai-real-world-podcast/GenAI_in_the_Real_World_with_Heiko_and%20_Sokratis.mp3#t=493\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">8:13</a>: We can parallelize A2A with real business. Imagine separate agents that are different employees with different skills. They have their own business cards. They share the business cards with the clients. The client can understand what tasks they want to do: learn about stocks, learn about investments. So I call the right agent or server to get a specialized answer back. Each agent has a business card that describes its skills and capabilities. I can talk to the agent with live streaming or send it messages. You need to define how you communicate with the agent. And you need to define the security method you will use to exchange messages.</li><li><a href=\"https://cdn.oreillystatic.com/radar/generative-ai-real-world-podcast/GenAI_in_the_Real_World_with_Heiko_and%20_Sokratis.mp3#t=585\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">9:45</a>: Late last year, people started talking about single agents. But people were already talking about what the agent stack would be: memory, storage, observability, and so on. Now that you are talking about multi-agents or A2A, are there important things that need to be introduced to the agentic stack?</li><li><a href=\"https://cdn.oreillystatic.com/radar/generative-ai-real-world-podcast/GenAI_in_the_Real_World_with_Heiko_and%20_Sokratis.mp3#t=632\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">10:32</a>: You would still have the same. You‚Äôd arguably need more. Statefulness, memory, access to tools.</li><li><a href=\"https://cdn.oreillystatic.com/radar/generative-ai-real-world-podcast/GenAI_in_the_Real_World_with_Heiko_and%20_Sokratis.mp3#t=648\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">10:48</a>: Is that going to be like a shared memory across agents?</li><li><a href=\"https://cdn.oreillystatic.com/radar/generative-ai-real-world-podcast/GenAI_in_the_Real_World_with_Heiko_and%20_Sokratis.mp3#t=652\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">10:52</a>: It all depends on the architecture. The way I imagine a vanilla architecture, the user speaks to a router agent, which is the primary contact of the user with the system. That router agent does very simple things like saying ‚Äúhello.‚Äù But once the user asks the system ‚ÄúBook me a holiday to Paris,‚Äù there are many steps involved. (No agent can do this yet). The capabilities are getting better and better. But the way I imagine it is that the router agent is the boss, and two or three remote agents do different things. One finds flights; one books hotels; one books cars‚Äîthey all need information from each other. The router agent would hold the context for all of those. If you build it all within one agentic framework, it becomes even easier because those frameworks have the concepts of shared memory built in. But it‚Äôs not necessarily needed. If the hotel booking agent is built in LangChain and from a different team than the flight booking agent, the router agent would decide what information is needed.</li><li><a href=\"https://cdn.oreillystatic.com/radar/generative-ai-real-world-podcast/GenAI_in_the_Real_World_with_Heiko_and%20_Sokratis.mp3#t=808\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">13:28</a>: What you just said is the argument for why you need these protocols. Your example is the canonical simple example. What if my trip involves four different countries? I might need a hotel agent for every country. Because hotels might need to be specialized for local knowledge.</li><li><a href=\"https://cdn.oreillystatic.com/radar/generative-ai-real-world-podcast/GenAI_in_the_Real_World_with_Heiko_and%20_Sokratis.mp3#t=852\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">14:12</a>: Technically, you might not need to change agents. You need to change the data‚Äîwhat agent has access to what data.&nbsp;</li><li><a href=\"https://cdn.oreillystatic.com/radar/generative-ai-real-world-podcast/GenAI_in_the_Real_World_with_Heiko_and%20_Sokratis.mp3#t=869\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">14:29</a>: We need to parallelize single agents with multi-agent systems; we move from a monolithic application to microservices that have small, dedicated agents to perform specific tasks. This has many benefits. It also makes the life of the developer easier because you can test, you can evaluate, you can perform checks before moving to production. Imagine that you gave a human 100 tools to perform a task. The human will get confused. It‚Äôs the same for agents. You need small agents with specific terms to perform the right task.&nbsp;</li><li><a href=\"https://cdn.oreillystatic.com/radar/generative-ai-real-world-podcast/GenAI_in_the_Real_World_with_Heiko_and%20_Sokratis.mp3#t=931\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">15:31</a>: Heiko‚Äôs example drives home why something like MCP may not be enough. If you have a master agent and all it does is integrate with external sites, but the integration is not smart‚Äîif the other side has an agent, that agent could be thinking as well. While agent-to-agent is something of a science fiction at the moment, it does make sense moving forward.</li><li><a href=\"https://cdn.oreillystatic.com/radar/generative-ai-real-world-podcast/GenAI_in_the_Real_World_with_Heiko_and%20_Sokratis.mp3#t=971\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">16:11</a>: Coming back to Sokratis‚Äôs thought, when you give an agent too many tools and make it try to do too many things, it just becomes more and more likely that by reasoning through these tools, it will pick the wrong tool. That gets us to evaluation and fault tolerance.&nbsp;</li><li><a href=\"https://cdn.oreillystatic.com/radar/generative-ai-real-world-podcast/GenAI_in_the_Real_World_with_Heiko_and%20_Sokratis.mp3#t=1012\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">16:52</a>: At some point we might see multi-agent systems communicate with other multi-agent systems‚Äîan agent mesh.</li><li><a href=\"https://cdn.oreillystatic.com/radar/generative-ai-real-world-podcast/GenAI_in_the_Real_World_with_Heiko_and%20_Sokratis.mp3#t=1025\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">17:05</a>: In the scenario of this hotel booking, each of the smaller agents would use their own local model. They wouldn‚Äôt all rely on a central model. Almost all frameworks allow you to choose the right model for the right task. If a task is simple but still requires an LLM, a small open source model could be sufficient. If the task requires heavy ‚Äúbrain‚Äù power, you might want to use Gemini 2.5 Pro.</li><li><a href=\"https://cdn.oreillystatic.com/radar/generative-ai-real-world-podcast/GenAI_in_the_Real_World_with_Heiko_and%20_Sokratis.mp3#t=1087\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">18:07</a>: Sokratis brought up the word security. One of the earlier attacks against MCP is a scenario when an attacker buries instructions in the system prompt of the MCP server or its metadata, which then gets sent into the model. In this case, you have smaller agents, but something may happen to the smaller agents. What attack scenarios worry you at this point?</li><li><a href=\"https://cdn.oreillystatic.com/radar/generative-ai-real-world-podcast/GenAI_in_the_Real_World_with_Heiko_and%20_Sokratis.mp3#t=1142\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">19:02</a>: There are many levels at which something might go wrong. With a single agent, you have to implement guardrails before and after each call to an LLM or agent.</li><li><a href=\"https://cdn.oreillystatic.com/radar/generative-ai-real-world-podcast/GenAI_in_the_Real_World_with_Heiko_and%20_Sokratis.mp3#t=1164\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">19:24</a>: In a single agent, there is one model. Now each agent is using its own model.&nbsp;</li><li><a href=\"https://cdn.oreillystatic.com/radar/generative-ai-real-world-podcast/GenAI_in_the_Real_World_with_Heiko_and%20_Sokratis.mp3#t=1135\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">19:35</a>: And this makes the evaluation and security guardrails even more problematic. From A2A‚Äôs side, it supports all the different security types to authenticate agents, like API keys, HTTP authentication, OAuth 2. Within the agent card, the agent can define what you need to use to use the agent. Then you need to think of this as a service possibility. It‚Äôs not just a responsibility of the protocol. It‚Äôs the responsibility of the developer.</li><li><a href=\"https://cdn.oreillystatic.com/radar/generative-ai-real-world-podcast/GenAI_in_the_Real_World_with_Heiko_and%20_Sokratis.mp3#t=1229\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">20:29</a>: It‚Äôs equivalent to right now with MCP. There are thousands of MCP servers. How do I know which to trust? But at the same time, there are thousands of Python packages. I have to figure out which to trust. At some level, some vetting needs to be done before you trust another agent. Is that right?</li><li><a href=\"https://cdn.oreillystatic.com/radar/generative-ai-real-world-podcast/GenAI_in_the_Real_World_with_Heiko_and%20_Sokratis.mp3#t=1260\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">21:00</a>: I would think so. There‚Äôs a great article: ‚Äú<a href=\"https://elenacross7.medium.com/%EF%B8%8F-the-s-in-mcp-stands-for-security-91407b33ed6b\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">The S in MCP Stands for Security</a>.‚Äù We can‚Äôt speak as much to the MCP protocol, but I do believe there have been efforts to implement authentication methods and address security concerns, because this is the number one question enterprises will ask. Without proper authentication and security, you will not have adoption in enterprises, which means you will not have adoption at all. WIth A2A, these concerns were addressed head-on because the A2A team understood that to get any chance of traction, built in security was priority 0.&nbsp;</li><li><a href=\"https://cdn.oreillystatic.com/radar/generative-ai-real-world-podcast/GenAI_in_the_Real_World_with_Heiko_and%20_Sokratis.mp3#t=1325\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">22:25</a>: Are you familiar with the buzzword ‚Äúlarge action models‚Äù? The notion that your model is now multimodal and can look at screens and environment states.</li><li><a href=\"https://cdn.oreillystatic.com/radar/generative-ai-real-world-podcast/GenAI_in_the_Real_World_with_Heiko_and%20_Sokratis.mp3#t=1371\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">22:51</a>: Within DeepMind, we have Project Mariner, which leverages Gemini‚Äôs capabilities to ask on your behalf about your computer screen.</li><li><a href=\"https://cdn.oreillystatic.com/radar/generative-ai-real-world-podcast/GenAI_in_the_Real_World_with_Heiko_and%20_Sokratis.mp3#t=1386\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">23:06</a>: It makes sense that it‚Äôs something you want to avoid if you can. If you can do things in a headless way, why do you want to pretend you‚Äôre human? If there‚Äôs an API or integration, you would go for that. But the reality is that many tools knowledge workers use may not have these features yet. How does that impact how we build agent security? Now that people might start building agents to act like knowledge workers using screens?</li><li><a href=\"https://cdn.oreillystatic.com/radar/generative-ai-real-world-podcast/GenAI_in_the_Real_World_with_Heiko_and%20_Sokratis.mp3#t=1425\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">23:45</a>: I spoke with a bank in the UK yesterday, and they were very clear that they need to have complete observability on agents, even if that means slowing down the process. Because of regulation, they need to be able to explain every request that went to the LLM, and every action that followed from that. I believe observability is the key in this setup, where you just cannot tolerate any errors. Because it is LLM-based, there will still be errors. But in a bank you must at least be in a position to explain exactly what happened.</li><li><a href=\"https://cdn.oreillystatic.com/radar/generative-ai-real-world-podcast/GenAI_in_the_Real_World_with_Heiko_and%20_Sokratis.mp3#t=1485\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">24:45</a>: With most customers, whenever there‚Äôs an agentic solution, they need to share that they are using an agentic solution and the way [they] are using it is X, Y, and Z. A legal agreement is required to use the agent. The customer needs to be clear about this. There are other scenarios like UI testing where, as a developer, I want an agent to start using my machine. Or an elder who is connected with customer support of a telco to fix a router. This is impossible for a nontechnical person to achieve. The fear is there, like nuclear energy, which can be used in two different ways. It‚Äôs the same with agents and GenAI.&nbsp;</li><li><a href=\"https://cdn.oreillystatic.com/radar/generative-ai-real-world-podcast/GenAI_in_the_Real_World_with_Heiko_and%20_Sokratis.mp3#t=1568\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">26:08</a>: A2A is a protocol. As a protocol, there‚Äôs only so much you can do on the security front. At some level, that‚Äôs the responsibility of the developers. I may want to signal that my agent is secure because I‚Äôve hired a third party to do penetration testing. Is there a way for the protocol to embed knowledge about the extra step?</li><li><a href=\"https://cdn.oreillystatic.com/radar/generative-ai-real-world-podcast/GenAI_in_the_Real_World_with_Heiko_and%20_Sokratis.mp3#t=1620\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">27:00</a>: A protocol can‚Äôt handle all the different cases. That‚Äôs why A2A created the notion of extensions. You can extend the data structure and also the methods or the profile. Within this profile, you can say, ‚ÄúI want all the agents to use this encryption.‚Äù And with that, you can tell all your systems to use the same patterns.

For someone who is familiar with RPC, with traditional internet protocols, A2A is very intuitive. You have a server; you have a client. All you need to learn is some specific concepts, like the agent card. (The agent card itself could be used to signal not only my capabilities but how I have been tested. You can even think of other metrics like uptime and success rate.) You need to understand the concept of a task. And then the remote agent will update on this task as defined‚Äîfor example, every five minutes or [upon] completion of specific subtasks.</li><li><a href=\"https://cdn.oreillystatic.com/radar/generative-ai-real-world-podcast/GenAI_in_the_Real_World_with_Heiko_and%20_Sokratis.mp3#t=1792\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">29:52</a>: A2A already supports JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, Java, and .NET.

Three weeks ago, I presented [at] the Google Cloud London Summit with a big customer on the integration of A2A into their agentic platform, and we shared tens of customers, including the announcement from Microsoft. Many customers start implementing agents. At some point they lack integration across business units.

In this post I'll outline the current progress of\nthe project and provide some technical details, including current caveats and\nfuture plans.</p><p>It is important to note that this is not a release and none of the described\nAPIs and functionalities is considered to be stable. Things are still changing\nand I'm not accepting bug reports for the time being.</p><p>The easiest way to use Common Lisp on a website is to include WECL and insert\nscript tags with a type \"text/common-lisp\". When the attribute src is present,\nthen first the runtime loads the script from that url, and then it executes the\nnode body. For example create and run this HTML document from localhost:</p><pre><code>&lt;!doctype html&gt;\n&lt;html&gt;\n  &lt;head&gt;\n    &lt;title&gt;Web Embeddable Common Lisp&lt;/title&gt;\n    &lt;link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"https://turtleware.eu/static/misc/wecl-20250821/easy.css\" /&gt;\n    &lt;script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"https://turtleware.eu/static/misc/wecl-20250821/boot.js\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\n    &lt;script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"https://turtleware.eu/static/misc/wecl-20250821/wecl.js\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\n  &lt;/head&gt;\n  &lt;body&gt;\n    &lt;script type=\"text/common-lisp\" src=\"https://turtleware.eu/static/misc/wecl-20250821/easy.lisp\" id='easy-script'&gt;\n(defvar *div* (make-element \"div\" :id \"my-ticker\"))\n(append-child [body] *div*)\n\n(dotimes (v 4)\n  (push-counter v))\n\n(loop for tic from 6 above 0\n      do (replace-children *div* (make-paragraph \"~a\" tic))\n         (js-sleep 1000)\n      finally (replace-children *div* (make-paragraph \"BOOM!\")))\n\n(show-script-text \"easy-script\")\n    &lt;/script&gt;\n  &lt;/body&gt;\n&lt;/html&gt;\n</code></pre><p>We may use Common Lisp that can call to JavaScript, and register callbacks to be\ncalled on specified events. The source code of the script can be found here:</p><p>Because the runtime is included as a script, the browser will usually cache the\n~10MB WebAssembly module.</p><p>The initial foreign function interface has numerous macros defining wrappers\nthat may be used from Common Lisp or passed to JavaScript.</p><p>Summary of currently available operators:</p><ul><li> an inlined expression, like </li><li> an object referenced from the object store</li><li> a function</li><li> a method of the argument, like </li><li> a slot reader of the argument</li><li> a slot writer of the first argument</li><li> combines define-js-getter and define-js-setter</li><li> template for JavaScript expressions</li><li> Common Lisp function reference callable from JavaScript</li><li> anonymous Common Lisp function reference (for closures)</li></ul><p>Summary of argument types:</p><table border=\"2\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"6\" rules=\"groups\" frame=\"hsides\"><thead><tr></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Common Lisp object reference</td></tr><tr><td>JavaScript object reference</td></tr><tr></tr><tr></tr><tr></tr></tbody></table><p>All operators, except for  have a similar lambda list:</p><blockquote><p>(DEFINE-JS NAME-AND-OPTIONS [ARGUMENTS [,@BODY]])</p></blockquote><p>The first argument is a list  that is common to all\ndefining operators:</p><ul><li> Common Lisp symbol denoting the object</li><li> a string denoting the JavaScript expression, i.e \"innerText\"</li><li> a type of the object returned by executing the expression</li></ul><pre><code>(define-js-variable ([document] :js-expr \"document\" :type :symbol))\n;; document\n(define-js-object ([body] :js-expr \"document.body\" :type :js-ref))\n;; wecl_ensure_object(document.body) /* -&gt; id   */\n;; wecl_search_object(id)            /* -&gt; node */\n</code></pre><p>The difference between a variable and an object in JS-FFI is that variable\nexpression is executed each time when the object is used (the expression is\ninlined), while the object expression is executed only once and the result is\nstored in the object store.</p><p>The second argument is a list of pairs . Names will be used in the\nlambda list of the operator callable from Common Lisp, while types will be used\nto coerce arguments to the type expected by JavaScript.</p><pre><code>(define-js-function (parse-float :js-expr \"parseFloat\" :type :js-ref)\n    ((value :string)))\n;; parseFloat(value)\n\n(define-js-method (add-event-listener :js-expr \"addEventListener\" :type :null)\n    ((self :js-ref)\n     (name :string)\n     (fun :js-ref)))\n;; self.addEventListener(name, fun)\n\n(define-js-getter (get-inner-text :js-expr \"innerText\" :type :string)\n    ((self :js-ref)))\n;; self.innerText\n\n(define-js-setter (set-inner-text :js-expr \"innerText\" :type :string)\n    ((self :js-ref)\n     (new :string)))\n;; self.innerText = new\n\n(define-js-accessor (inner-text :js-expr \"innerText\" :type :string)\n    ((self :js-ref)\n     (new :string)))\n;; self.innerText\n;; self.innerText = new\n\n(define-js-script (document :js-expr \"~a.forEach(~a)\" :type :js-ref)\n    ((nodes :js-ref)\n     (callb :object)))\n;; nodes.forEach(callb)\n</code></pre><p>The third argument is specific to callbacks, where we define Common Lisp body of\nthe callback. Argument types are used to coerce values from JavaScript to Common\nLisp.</p><pre><code>(define-js-callback (print-node :type :object)\n    ((elt :js-ref)\n     (nth :fixnum)\n     (seq :js-ref))\n  (format t \"Node ~2d: ~a~%\" nth elt))\n\n(let ((start 0))\n  (add-event-listener *my-elt* \"click\"\n                      (lambda-js-callback :null ((event :js-ref)) ;closure!\n                        (incf start)\n                        (setf (inner-text *my-elt*)\n                              (format nil \"Hello World! ~a\" start)))\n</code></pre><p>Note that callbacks are a bit different, because  does not\naccept  option and  has unique lambda list. It is\nimportant for callbacks to have an exact arity as they are called with, because\nJS-FFI does not implement variable number of arguments yet.</p><p>Callbacks can be referred by name with an operator .</p><p>While working on FFI I've decided to write an adapter for SLIME/SWANK that will\nallow interacting with WECL from Emacs. The principle is simple: we connect with\na websocket to Emacs that is listening on the specified port (i.e on localhost).\nThis adapter uses the library  written by Andrew Hyatt.</p><p>It allows for compiling individual forms with , but file compilation\ndoes not work (because files reside on a different \"host\"). REPL interaction\nworks as expected, as well as SLDB. The connection may occasionally be unstable,\nand until Common Lisp call returns, the whole page is blocked. Notably waiting\nfor new requests is not a blocking operation from the JavaScript perspective,\nbecause it is an asynchronous operation.</p><pre><code>;;; Patches for SLIME 2.31 (to be removed after the patch is merged).\n;;; It is assumed that SLIME is already loaded into Emacs.\n(defun slime-net-send (sexp proc)\n  \"Send a SEXP to Lisp over the socket PROC.\nThis is the lowest level of communication.

That means that if Lisp call\ndoesn't return (i.e because it waits for input in a loop), then we can't execute\nother Common Lisp statements from elsewhere because the application will crash.</p><p>Here's another example. It is more a cool gimmick than anything else, but let's\ntry it. Open a console on this very website (on firefox C-S-i) and execute:</p><pre><code>function inject_js(url) {\n    var head = document.getElementsByTagName('head')[0];\n    var script = document.createElement('script');\n    head.appendChild(script);\n    script.type = 'text/javascript';\n    return new Promise((resolve) =&gt; {\n        script.onload = resolve;\n        script.src = url;\n    });\n}\n\nfunction inject_cl() {\n    wecl_eval('(wecl/impl::js-load-slug \"https://turtleware.eu/static/misc/wecl-20250821\")');\n}\n\ninject_js('https://turtleware.eu/static/misc/wecl-20250821/boot.js')\n    .then(() =&gt; {\n        wecl_init_hooks.push(inject_cl);\n        inject_js('https://turtleware.eu/static/misc/wecl-20250821/wecl.js');\n    });\n</code></pre><p>With this, assuming that you've kept your LIME server open, you'll have a REPL\nonto uncooperative website. Now we can fool around with queries and changes:</p><pre><code>(define-js-accessor (title :js-expr \"title\" :type :string)\n  ((self :js-ref)\n   (title :string)))\n\n(define-js-accessor (background :js-expr \"body.style.backgroundColor\" :type :string)\n  ((self :js-ref)\n   (background :string)))\n\n(setf (title [document]) \"Write in Lisp!\")\n(setf (background [document]) \"#aaffaa\")\n</code></pre><p>The first thing to address is the lack of threading primitives. Native threads\ncan be implemented with web workers, but then our GC wouldn't know how to stop\nthe world to clean up. Another option is to use cooperative threads, but that\nalso won't work, because Emscripten doesn't support independent asynchronous\ncontexts, nor ECL is ready for that yet.</p><p>I plan to address both issues simultaneously in the second stage of the project\nwhen I port the runtime to WASI. We'll be able to use browser's GC, so running\nin multiple web workers should not be a problem anymore.

It uses specialized models (proprietary and best-of-LLM) tuned for invoices and other documents, while GPT/Claude are general-purpose LLMs.</p><p>You will see real Python code, actual outputs and a breakdown of when to use each tool (pros &amp; cons). At the end, there is a detailed comparison table on features &amp; benchmarks.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  üéØ Using GPT-4o (ChatGPT) API\n</h2><p>Let‚Äôs start with <a href=\"https://openai.com/index/hello-gpt-4o/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">OpenAI‚Äôs GPT-4o</a>. It's capable of understanding text and extracting structured information when prompted correctly. But unlike Invofox, it can‚Äôt directly read PDF files.</p><p>So we first need to extract the text using OCR (like Tesseract, pdfplumber or an online tool), then send that text to GPT via an API prompt.</p><p>GPT-4o, especially via the ChatGPT web interface and certain API endpoints (notably in Azure OpenAI Service), can accept PDFs and images as inputs and extract structured data. But since we are using the API, it's not really possible.</p><p>You will need an <a href=\"https://platform.openai.com/api-keys\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">OpenAI API key</a>. Create a  file and attach it with this convention.</p><div><pre><code>your_api_key\n</code></pre></div>\nopenai api key\n\n\n\n<p>We will use Python for this. Here's how you can try it yourself, step by step.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Step 1: Set up your Python environment\n</h3><p>Creating a virtual environment means setting up an isolated space for your Python project where all dependencies are installed locally (and not system-wide). This avoids version conflicts and keeps your global Python installation clean. So let‚Äôs create one.</p><div><pre><code>\npython3  venv /bin/activate  \npython  venv \n.nvcriptsctivate  </code></pre></div><p>You will know it‚Äôs active when you see  at the beginning of your terminal prompt.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Step 2: Install required packages\n</h3><p>We need two main libraries:</p><ul><li>: to use the GPT-4o API</li><li> : Loads environment variables from a  file into Python, useful for managing API keys and secrets.\n</li></ul><div><pre><code>pip pdfplumber openai python-dotenv\n</code></pre></div><p>I installed the  later so that's why it's not visible in the command.</p><p>After installing your dependencies, run:</p><div><pre><code>pip freeze  requirements.txt\n</code></pre></div><p>This writes all installed packages in your virtual environment (with versions) into . You can then use this file later with:</p><div><pre><code>pip  requirements.txt\n</code></pre></div><p>For reference, please add a  in the root directory to avoid pushing the virtual environment directory.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Step 3: Extract text and parse with GPT-4o\n</h3><p>Here is the <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/16CgRRnk9KAn1lHhm2os9niJjKXM8tcnt/view?usp=sharing\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">sample Invoice PDF</a> that I'm using for the example. I'm attaching a snapshot so you can get the idea of the fields we are going to extract.</p><p>Let's write the complete code with the file name as .</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Here's a simple explanation:</p><ul><li><p> : uses  reads each page of the PDF and concatenates the extracted text. This gives you the raw, unstructured invoice content as a string.</p></li><li><p><code>parse_invoice_with_openai</code> : Sends this prompt to the GPT‚Äë4o model via the  endpoint, asking GPT‚Äë4o to extract five key fields. </p></li><li><p>The model then processes the prompt and returns a JSON-formatted response.</p></li></ul><p>Here is the JSON response after running the script using .</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>GPT-4o (ChatGPT) output for invoice line items isn‚Äôt consistently labeled \"lines\". Sometimes it's \"Line Items\" or something less standardized, while other tools (like Invofox) always use a consistent name like \"lines\" for those entries.</p>\nterminal output\n\n\n\n<p>Here we instruct GPT-4o via a system prompt to parse the text. This can work reasonably well as the API is strong enough now (compared to previous OpenAI models).</p><p>‚úÖ Pros: Easy to try, flexible. GPT-4 excels at logic and structured data extraction, so it can correctly identify invoice fields and calculate totals.</p><ul><li>The problem I see is that we still have to engineer prompts and verify the output (which is not possible for everyone).</li><li>The JSON can be malformed or may miss fields (hallucinations are possible). </li><li>There‚Äôs no built‚Äëin validation or confidence scores. </li><li>GPT requires sending all text in prompts (which would be costly for large docs) and outputs vary by prompt style.</li></ul><p>GPT-4o is billed per token. The estimated cost for a 1‚Äì2 page invoice extraction falls in the $0.005‚Äì$0.018 range, depending on how detailed your prompt and output are. You can also use this <a href=\"https://docsbot.ai/tools/gpt-openai-api-pricing-calculator\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">pricing calculator</a> based on your use case.</p><p>It can respond in 1‚Äì30s but is subject to load spikes, especially for large prompts.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  üéØ Using Claude 3.5 Sonnet API\n</h2><p><a href=\"https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-3-5-sonnet\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Anthropic's Claude 3.5 Sonnet</a> model is also capable of parsing structured data from text when prompted correctly. Like GPT-4o, it cannot read PDF files directly via API, so we will first extract the text from an invoice PDF, then pass it to Claude for structured parsing.</p><p>You will need an <a href=\"https://console.anthropic.com/settings/keys\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Anthropic API key</a>. Create a  file and attach it with this convention:</p><div><pre><code>ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_api_key\n</code></pre></div><p>We will use Python again for this setup and follow the same instructions used in the last section.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Step 1: Set up environment and install packages\n</h3><p>Just like before, let‚Äôs isolate our dependencies in a virtual environment.</p><div><pre><code>\npython3  venv /bin/activate\n\n\npython  venv \n.nvcriptsctivate\n</code></pre></div><p>Once activated, your terminal will show a  prefix.</p><p>We need the following libraries:</p><ul><li> : to extract text from PDF</li><li> : official SDK to interact with Claude 3.5</li><li> : to load the API key from a  file\n</li></ul><div><pre><code>pip pdfplumber anthropic python-dotenv\n</code></pre></div><p>If you are following from the last example, we just need to install the anthropic package.</p><p>Then export your environment to a  file. Make sure to include a  to avoid committing the virtual environment.</p><div><pre><code>pip freeze  requirements.txt\n</code></pre></div><h3>\n  \n  \n  Step 2: Extract text and parse with Claude 3.5 Sonnet\n</h3><p>As Anthropic launches safer and more capable models, they regularly retire older models. So you can check the <a href=\"https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/about-claude/model-deprecations#model-status\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">model status</a> of which ones are deprecated, retired and which ones are active. I will be using <code>claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620</code> active version for the example.</p><p>Let's write the complete code with the file name as . It's very similar to the previous section and I'm using the same <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/16CgRRnk9KAn1lHhm2os9niJjKXM8tcnt/view?usp=sharing\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">sample Invoice PDF</a>.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Here's a simple explanation:</p><ul><li><p> : uses  to pull plain text from each page of the PDF.</p></li><li><p><code>parse_invoice_with_claude</code> : sends the text to Claude Sonnet 3.5 with a specific prompt asking for JSON output.</p></li><li><p>Claude returns a stringified JSON block with the requested fields.</p></li></ul><p>You can run the script using  in the terminal. Here's the JSON response:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><ul><li>Claude 3.5 is very strong at understanding long text and formatting it cleanly.</li><li>Claude Sonnet can handle text (and even images via embedding) in its prompts</li><li>In some cases, it handles unusual or long documents slightly better than GPT-4.</li></ul><ul><li>Like GPT, Claude requires prompt engineering.</li><li>Like GPT, Claude can sometimes miss fields or make up values (hallucinate).</li><li>It still returns raw JSON text without validation, so you must parse/verify it.</li><li>You still need to extract text yourself, it doesn‚Äôt parse raw PDFs.</li></ul><p>Claude 3.5 Sonnet is also billed per token. The estimated cost for a 1‚Äì2 page invoice extraction falls in the $0.005‚Äì$0.018 range, depending on how detailed your prompt and output are. You can also use this <a href=\"https://custom.typingmind.com/tools/estimate-llm-usage-costs/claude-3.5-sonnet\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">pricing calculator</a> based on your use case.</p><p>It's exceptionally fast for small prompts (200‚Äì300ms) but larger or more complex stimuli can raise latency to 10s or more. </p><p>So I was searching for a better solution unlike code-based (OpenAI &amp; Anthropic) approaches requiring prompt engineering, I found many good tools like Invofox, Google Document AI, Amazon Textract. </p><p>What stood out about <a href=\"https://www.invofox.com/en\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Invofox</a> is that it‚Äôs backed by Y Combinator and has all the features I needed. That gave me the confidence to dig deeper and try it out.</p><p>It provides a plug‚Äëand‚Äëplay AI-powered document parsing API that makes it super easy to extract data from invoices, receipts, payslips, bank statements, loan/mortgage files and custom document types like bills.</p><p>They have some useful built-in features like:</p><p>It automatically separates multiple documents contained within a single PDF (such as mixed invoices or statements), grouping pages into logical sub-documents for better extraction and automation.  </p><p>It's configurable via API during upload and works alongside the classifier for cleaner downstream processing</p><p>Pretrained AI model that detects document types (invoice, receipt, etc) so that each document is processed using the correct schema. It's optional and can be enabled per environment or request.</p><p>They also use advanced AI models with proprietary algorithms that verify and autocomplete your data. Check <a href=\"https://developers.invofox.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">API Docs</a>.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Step 1: Sign up for the dashboard\n</h3><p>You can sign up for the dashboard to generate an API key.</p><p>You can manually upload the document as well but we will be using the API since it's easier and much better in experience.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Step 2: Creating the request in Postman\n</h3><p>Once you have your API key, you can use <a href=\"https://www.postman.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Postman</a> to send documents for parsing using Invofox's  endpoint.</p><p>‚úÖ 1. Create a New Request</p><ul><li><p>Open the Postman Desktop application</p></li><li><p>Create a collection and add a request</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>We need to request this endpoint: <code>https://api.invofox.com/v1/ingest/uploads</code></p></li></ul><p>Go to the Headers tab and add:</p><ul><li>key: , value: </li><li>key: , value: </li></ul><p>You should not manually set  as Postman will handle it automatically when using form-data. It tells the server what format the data in your request body is:</p><ul><li><p> ‚Üí You're sending raw JSON</p></li><li><p> ‚Üí You are sending files + form fields</p></li><li><p><code>application/x-www-form-urlencoded</code> ‚Üí You're sending form-like text fields (like an HTML form)</p></li></ul><p>When you're sending files using Postman‚Äôs form-data option, Postman automatically sets the correct  and boundary values (which are required for ).</p><p>If you manually set it like this:</p><div><pre><code>Content-Type: multipart/form-data\n</code></pre></div><p>You are missing the boundary part, which is something like:</p><div><pre><code>Content-Type: multipart/form-data; boundary=----WebKitFormBoundaryxyz\n</code></pre></div><p>Let's add the body fields.</p><p>‚úÖ 3. Add the Body (form-data)</p><p>Switch to the Body tab, select  and add the following two fields:</p><ul><li>key: , type: , value: upload your invoice ()</li></ul><ul><li>key: , type: , value: Paste the JSON below\n</li></ul><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>The&nbsp;&nbsp;field is optional here as it's&nbsp;only needed if you want to pass custom metadata or extra instructions&nbsp;(such as information to influence parsing, verification preferences or to register edge-case scenarios for custom document types).</p><p>Beyond standard types (invoice, payslip, bank statement), you can register custom document types in your Invofox dashboard. These custom types get a unique ID like  (used in the example), which is what we are now passing to the API. </p><p>By specifying a type ID, you ensure your files are parsed according to the exact schema you set up:</p><ul><li>Your custom JSON structure</li><li>Custom validation rules and human review workflows</li></ul><p>Click \"Send\". If everything is set up correctly, you will get a response with details on documentID.</p><ul><li> is the batch ID for this upload (useful for tracking multiple files uploaded together)</li><li> is the ID of the parsed document\n</li></ul><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><h3>\n  \n  \n  Step 3: Get Parsed Document\n</h3><p>There are two ways: one is to check the Invofox dashboard to find the newly parsed document. As you can notice, the line items and breakdowns are displayed in a table format. The GUI also provides many options, including filtering the extracted data.</p><p>Based on how the workflow is set up, it may be necessary to mark it as completed, as involving a human in the loop ensures the highest accuracy and gives us more control.</p><p>The other way (recommended) is to make a  request to <code>https://api.invofox.com/documents/{documentID}</code> with headers as:</p><ul><li>key: , value: </li><li>key: , value: </li></ul><p>Here is a trimmed JSON response with the original format. It also provides the image of the original invoice in the response and a lot of extra fields compared to the earlier responses of GPT-4o &amp; Claude.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Pricing is not public, so potential users must contact their team for a commercial offer, but the product is specifically tuned for production speed and reliability. Actual test response times reported in the blog are consistently under 5s.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  üéØ Python Code using Invofox API\n</h3><p>Many developers prefer extracting documents with code, so let‚Äôs walk through the same process using the Invofox API with Python. We will keep it brief, with just the code and JSON response.</p><p>The overall process is the same as the previous sections, so I'm not repeating that. You can read the <a href=\"https://developers.invofox.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">docs</a> if you are interested in exploring for yourself.</p><p>We need to install <a href=\"https://pypi.org/project/requests/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">requests</a>, a Python library that makes it easy to send HTTP requests (such as GET, POST) and work with web APIs.</p><p>We will also use the  built-in Python module that comes pre-installed with every standard Python installation. The&nbsp;&nbsp;module provides various time-related functions such as delays (), timestamps and more. In our case, we will use it to pause execution, giving the document enough time to be processed on the dashboard.</p><p>Let's write the complete code with the file name as .</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Here are all the Invofox API endpoints used:</p><p>Here is the JSON response after running the script using .</p><p>The JSON response is similar to what we got after making a request using Postman. It also provides the image of the original invoice in the response and a lot of useful fields.</p><p>Let's compare their methods in brief.</p><ul><li><ul><li>GPT-4o/Claude ‚Üí send text with prompt</li><li>Invofox ‚Üí use API or upload a file (image/PDF) in bulk</li></ul></li><li><ul><li>GPT/Claude ‚Üí need to write prompt engineering code</li><li>Invofox ‚Üí minimal code, no prompt</li></ul></li><li><ul><li>GPT/Claude ‚Üí you need to manually verify </li><li>Invofox ‚Üí built-in validation and confidence scores</li></ul></li><li><ul><li>GPT/Claude ‚Üí limited by token/window size</li><li>Invofox ‚Üí handles multi-page docs via backend OCR and AI</li></ul></li></ul><p>While parsing the invoice, here's what I realized:</p><ul><li><p> : Good at parsing known fields if prompted clearly. You get a JSON string but must parse/clean it yourself. Errors can occur if prompts are unclear.</p></li><li><p> : It's very similar to GPT-4. In the snapshots, you can see Sonnet handled the invoice fields about as well as GPT-4, sometimes better at recognizing unfamiliar terms. But we still had to massage the prompt.</p></li><li><p> : It returned the fully parsed invoice JSON out-of-the-box. All fields were correctly extracted and validated. The output schema was exactly what we needed, with no extra coding.</p></li></ul><p>Now that we have explored each option, let‚Äôs compare them side by side. Estimates are based on typical invoice lengths: simple invoices are 1‚Äì2 pages &amp; 1000-2000 tokens total.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Cost &amp; Execution Time Benchmarks\n</h3><p>We covered the pricing structure in each of the sections, but I have also done it side-by-side so it's easier to make a decision.</p><p>You should also acknowledge the ongoing cost and effort involved in upgrading language models. Teams often need to benchmark new models, retest prompts and schemas and adjust output parsing logic whenever a new version is released.</p><p>These hidden maintenance costs aren‚Äôt always obvious but should be considered. With Invofox, there is no such requirement.</p><p>For quick experiments or one-off tasks, you can use GPT-4 (ChatGPT API) or Claude Sonnet to parse invoice text by crafting suitable prompts. They will do a decent job extracting fields in JSON (since GPT-4 tends to produce more structured and cleaner outputs than earlier GPT-3). </p><p>However, for reliable production-grade parsing of invoices or receipts, the Invofox API is superior. It‚Äôs specifically built for documents using advanced proprietary models and continual feedback.</p><p>I hope you learned how to parse documents. Let me know if you have any questions or feedback.</p><p>Have a great day!

The convener projected a Word document on the screen and people called out proposed changes, which were then debated in the room before being adopted or adapted, added or subtracted. I kid you not.</p><p>I don‚Äôt remember exactly when this was, but I know it was after the introduction of Google Docs in 2005, because I do remember being completely baffled and frustrated that this international standards organization was still stuck somewhere in the previous century.</p><p>You may not have experienced anything this extreme, but many people will remember the days of sending around Word files as attachments and then collating and comparing multiple divergent versions. And this behavior also persisted long after 2005. (Apparently, this is still the case in some contexts, such as in parts of the U.S. government.) If you aren‚Äôt old enough to have experienced that, consider yourself lucky.</p><p>This is, in many ways, the point of Arvind Narayanan and Sayash Kapoor‚Äôs essay ‚Äú<a href=\"https://knightcolumbia.org/content/ai-as-normal-technology\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">AI as Normal Technology</a>.‚Äù There is a long gap between the invention of a technology and a true understanding of how to apply it. One of the canonical examples came at the end of the Second Industrial Revolution. When first electrified, factories duplicated the design of factories powered by coal and steam, where immense central boilers and steam engines distributed mechanical power to various machines by complex arrangements of gears and pulleys. The steam engines were replaced by large electric motors, but the layout of the factory remained unchanged.</p><p>Only over time were factories reconfigured to take advantage of small electric motors that could be distributed throughout the factory and incorporated into individual specialized machines. As <a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/radar/is-ai-a-normal-technology/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">I discussed last week with Arvind Narayanan</a>, there are four stages to every technology revolution: the invention of new technology; the diffusion of knowledge about it; the development of products based on it; and adaptation by consumers, businesses, and society as a whole. All this takes time. I love James Bessen‚Äôs framing of this process as ‚Äú<a href=\"https://yalebooks.yale.edu/book/9780300195668/learning-by-doing/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">learning by doing</a>.‚Äù It takes time and shared learning to understand how best to apply a new technology, to <a href=\"https://www.billcollinsenglish.com/OrdinaryEveningHaven.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">search the possible for its possibleness</a>. People try new things, show them to others, and build on them in a marvelous kind of leapfrogging of the imagination.</p><p>So it is no surprise that in 2005 files were still being sent around by email, and that one day a small group of inventors came up with a way to realize the true possibilities of the internet and built an environment where a file could be shared in real time by a set of collaborators, with all the mechanisms of version control present but hidden from view.</p><p>On next Tuesday‚Äôs episode of <a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/live/live-with-tim/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"></a>, I‚Äôll be talking with that small group‚ÄîSam Schillace, Steve Newman, and Claudia Carpenter‚Äîwhose company Writely was launched in beta 20 years ago this month. Writely was acquired by Google in March of 2006 and became the basis of Google Docs.</p><p>In that same year, Google also reinvented online maps, spreadsheets, and more. It was a year that some fundamental lessons of the internet‚Äîalready widely available since the early 1990s‚Äîfinally began to sink in.</p><p>Remembering this moment matters a lot, because we are at a similar point today, where we think we know what to do with AI but are still building the equivalent of factories with huge centralized engines rather than truly searching out the possibility of its deployed capabilities. Ethan Mollick recently wrote a wonderful essay about the opportunities (and failure modes) of this moment in ‚Äú<a href=\"https://www.oneusefulthing.org/p/the-bitter-lesson-versus-the-garbage\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">The Bitter Lesson Versus the Garbage Can</a>.‚Äù Do we really begin to grasp what is possible with AI or just try to fit it into our old business processes?

What many people don‚Äôt realize is that most photos already come with a hidden trail of breadcrumbs that can solve this problem: .</p><p>Every time you snap a photo with a smartphone or digital camera, extra information gets embedded into the file, details like the date, camera settings, and, in many cases, the exact GPS coordinates of where the picture was taken. This hidden metadata is called <strong>EXIF (Exchangeable Image File Format)</strong>, and it‚Äôs more powerful than it looks. While smartphones often automatically organize your photos, many of us still have massive collections stored on a , where sorting and searching manually can feel impossible.</p><p>By extracting EXIF data, you can do much more than just learn which lens or exposure setting was used. You can <strong>index, organize, and search your entire photo library</strong> in ways that go far beyond filenames and folders. Want to pull up every photo taken in Paris? Or quickly filter for shots within 10 kilometers (about 6 miles) of Central Park? With EXIF indexing, that becomes not only possible but straightforward.</p><p>In this article, we‚Äôll explore how to extract EXIF metadata, build an index of your photos, including those on NAS drives, and run location-based searches to find exactly what you‚Äôre looking for.</p><p>When you take a photo, your camera doesn‚Äôt just capture light, it also records a set of descriptive details about the image, known as . EXIF stands for <strong>Exchangeable Image File Format</strong>, and it‚Äôs a standardized way of embedding extra information directly into the image file itself.</p><p>Think of EXIF as the \"digital notebook\" your camera keeps for each shot. Some of the most common fields include:</p><ul><li> ‚Äì the exact date and time the photo was taken.</li><li> ‚Äì make, model, lens, focal length, aperture, shutter speed, ISO.</li><li> ‚Äì latitude, longitude, and sometimes altitude, if location services were enabled.</li></ul><p>Among these, the GPS data is especially powerful for organizing and searching photos. Cameras and smartphones typically store coordinates in a format based on degrees, minutes, and seconds. For example:</p><div><pre><code>Latitude: 40¬∞ 46‚Ä≤ 56.62‚Ä≥ N  \nLongitude: 73¬∞ 58‚Ä≤ 0.85‚Ä≥ W  \nAltitude: 15.0 m  \n</code></pre></div><p>This information can be converted into decimal degrees (e.g., ), which is a more convenient format for indexing and performing calculations like distance searches.</p><p>EXIF isn‚Äôt just technical clutter inside your photos. It‚Äôs a hidden layer of context that tells you  and  a picture was taken, and with what gear, making it a goldmine for indexing and retrieval.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Extracting EXIF Data from Photos\n</h2><p>Now that we know what EXIF metadata is, the next step is learning how to actually .

You have the recipe (your machine learning algorithm), but the perfect cake depends on the precise amounts of each ingredient (your hyperparameters): the oven temperature, baking time, amount of sugar, etc. Getting these just right is crucial for a delicious outcome. This, in essence, is hyperparameter tuning. And Grid Search is one powerful technique to help us find that perfect recipe.</p><p>Hyperparameter tuning is the process of finding the optimal set of hyperparameters for a machine learning model to achieve the best possible performance. Hyperparameters are settings that are  learned from the data during training, unlike the model's parameters (weights and biases). They control the learning process itself. Grid Search is a brute-force approach to hyperparameter tuning where we systematically try out every combination of hyperparameters within a predefined range.</p><p>Let's break down the core concepts:</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  1. The Hyperparameter Landscape\n</h3><p>Imagine a multi-dimensional space where each dimension represents a hyperparameter (e.g., learning rate, regularization strength). Each point in this space represents a unique combination of hyperparameters, and each point corresponds to a model's performance (e.g., accuracy, F1-score). Our goal is to find the point with the highest performance.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  2. The Grid Search Algorithm\n</h3><p>Grid Search is a straightforward algorithm:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Define the hyperparameter search space:</strong>  Specify the range and values for each hyperparameter.  For example:  in ,  in .</p></li><li><p> Generate all possible combinations of hyperparameter values.  This forms our \"grid\" of points in the hyperparameter space.</p></li><li><p> For each combination in the grid:</p><ul><li>Train the model using those hyperparameters.</li><li>Evaluate the model's performance using a suitable metric (e.g., accuracy on a validation set).</li></ul></li><li><p> Choose the hyperparameter combination that yielded the best performance.</p></li></ol><p>Here's a simplified Python pseudo-code representation:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><h3>\n  \n  \n  3.  Mathematical Underpinnings (Optimization)\n</h3><p>Grid Search doesn't explicitly use gradient-based optimization. Instead, it's a form of . Gradient-based methods, like gradient descent, rely on calculating the gradient (the direction of steepest ascent) of the performance function with respect to each hyperparameter. This gradient guides the search towards better hyperparameter combinations. Grid Search, however, simply tries all combinations and selects the best one. It's computationally expensive but conceptually simple.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Real-World Applications and Impact\n</h2><p>Grid Search, despite its simplicity, finds widespread application:</p><ul><li> Optimizing convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures by tuning hyperparameters like the number of layers, filter sizes, and learning rate.</li><li><strong>Natural Language Processing (NLP):</strong> Fine-tuning the hyperparameters of recurrent neural networks (RNNs) or transformers for tasks like sentiment analysis or machine translation.</li><li> Adjusting the hyperparameters of collaborative filtering or content-based filtering algorithms to improve recommendation accuracy.</li></ul><h2>\n  \n  \n  Challenges and Limitations\n</h2><ul><li>  The number of combinations grows exponentially with the number of hyperparameters and the range of values.  This can be computationally prohibitive for complex models or large search spaces.</li><li>  As the number of hyperparameters increases, the search space becomes incredibly vast, making it difficult to find the global optimum.</li><li> Grid Search might get stuck in a local optimum, especially in non-convex performance landscapes.</li></ul><p>The computational cost of Grid Search can have environmental implications due to high energy consumption. Careful consideration of the search space and efficient algorithms are crucial to mitigate this.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  The Future of Hyperparameter Tuning\n</h2><p>While Grid Search provides a valuable baseline, more sophisticated techniques like randomized search, Bayesian optimization, and evolutionary algorithms are gaining popularity due to their efficiency in handling high-dimensional search spaces. Research continues to explore more efficient and robust methods for hyperparameter optimization, addressing the challenges of scalability and the need for less computationally expensive solutions.

Where sex, trade, and culture operated under systems of inequality. And yet, despite these challenges, ideas and identities moved faster than we might think. This is the fascinating world of Ancient Rome, a complex, uneven, and often uncomfortable prototype of globalization.</p><p>In this blog post, we'll take a closer look at what it was like to live in Ancient Rome as an ordinary person, navigating daily life. We'll explore the roads, the sex, the trade, and the culture, and see how they all fit together to create a world that was both familiar and foreign to us.</p><p>First, let's talk about the roads. The Romans were famous for their engineering feats, and their roads were no exception. They built roads all over their empire, connecting cities and towns and making it easier for people and goods to move around. But these roads were not built for convenience. They were built for conquest. The Romans believed that having a well-connected empire was essential for maintaining control over their territories, and so they invested heavily in building and maintaining their roads.</p><p>Next, let's talk about sex. Sex was an important part of Roman culture, and it was often used as a way to assert power and status. Men were expected to be the active partners in sexual relationships, while women were expected to be passive. However, there were also many examples of same-sex relationships in ancient Rome, and these were often accepted and even celebrated.</p><p>Moving on to trade, the Romans were skilled traders. They established a system of currency that allowed for the exchange of goods and services across their empire. They also built ports and markets to facilitate trade, and they encouraged the growth of industries such as agriculture and mining.</p><p>Finally, let's talk about culture. The Romans had a rich and diverse culture, with influences from all over the world. They were known for their art, literature, and architecture, and they were also famous for their festivals and celebrations. However, like many ancient societies, the Romans also had systems of inequality in place. The wealthy and powerful held most of the power, while the poor and marginalized were often left out of the decision-making process.</p><p>Despite these challenges, the Roman Empire was a remarkable achievement. It was a complex, uneven, and often uncomfortable prototype of globalization, with roads, sex, trade, and culture all operating under systems of inequality. But despite these challenges, ideas and identities moved faster than we might think, and the legacy of the Roman Empire continues to shape our world today.</p><p>So, the next time you're driving on a well-connected highway or enjoying a piece of Roman art, take a moment to appreciate the incredible achievements of this ancient civilization. And remember, even in the most complex and uneven of societies, there is always room for growth and change.</p>","contentLength":3079,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"What happens inside the computer when you run your Go server","url":"https://dev.to/turjoc120/what-happens-inside-the-computer-when-you-run-your-go-server-165n","date":1755735658,"author":"Turjo Chowdhury","guid":234844,"unread":true,"content":"<p>Before we deep dive, let's learn a couple of important concepts</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  What Are Sockets and File Descriptors?\n</h2><ul><li>Sockets are endpoints for communication between computers over a network, enabling real-time data exchange.</li><li>Unlike regular files, sockets do not store data but facilitate data transfer between machines.</li><li>When Go requests a socket from the operating system (OS), the OS creates the socket and assigns a unique identifier called a file descriptor.</li><li>A file descriptor is an integer handle that the Go server uses to manage and reference the socket.</li><li>This mechanism allows the server to efficiently send and receive network data through OS-managed resources.</li></ul><h2>\n  \n  \n  Go‚Äôs Concurrency with Goroutines\n</h2><ul><li>Go uses goroutines, lightweight threads, to handle many client requests concurrently.</li><li>The main goroutine continuously waits for incoming requests.</li><li>For each new request, Go creates a new goroutine to process it independently without blocking the main one.</li><li>This design ensures the server remains fast and scalable, handling multiple clients simultaneously.</li><li>When no requests arrive, the main goroutine sleeps to conserve system resources and improve overall efficiency.</li></ul><h2>\n  \n  \n  Understanding How It Works in Your Computer\n</h2><ul><li>The kernel is the core part of the operating system that manages hardware and processes.</li><li>Network requests first travel through a router and then reach your computer‚Äôs Network Interface Card (NIC), like a WiFi adapter or Ethernet port.</li><li>The NIC converts the wireless or wired signals into binary data and temporarily stores it in a buffer.</li><li>It then sends a signal to the kernel to process this new data.</li><li>The kernel copies the data into a socket buffer that the Go server listens to, and marks it ready for reading.</li><li>The Go runtime wakes up the goroutine to read and process the request.</li><li>The server sends the response back through the socket and NIC.</li><li>The response reaches the client‚Äôs browser.</li></ul>","contentLength":1902,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Title: Discovering a Rare Type of Black Hole Feasting on a Star","url":"https://dev.to/yagyaraj_sharma_6cd410179/title-discovering-a-rare-type-of-black-hole-feasting-on-a-star-2a4k","date":1755735631,"author":"Insights YRS","guid":234841,"unread":true,"content":"<h2>\n  \n  \n  Title: Discovering a Rare Type of Black Hole Feasting on a Star\n</h2><p>As a science and space enthusiast, I am always excited to learn about new discoveries in the field of astronomy.

Today, I'm the creator of a fully-functional, decentralized, on-chain game called <a href=\"https://muschairs.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Musical Chairs</a>. The twist? I didn't write a single line of the production code myself. <strong>100% of it was generated by Gemini, my AI coding partner integrated into VS Code.</strong></p><p>This isn't just a story about a cool project; it's a story about a new way of building. It's about how a single person with a clear vision can leverage AI to execute complex technical tasks, from writing secure smart contracts to deploying a multi-container production environment.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  The Idea: Decentralization First\n</h3><p>The concept was simple: take the childhood game of Musical Chairs and bring it to the blockchain. A game of pure reaction, provably fair, where the winner takes the pot.</p><p>My initial thought was to use a stablecoin like USDT for the game's currency. It seemed user-friendly. However, as Gemini and I delved into the technicals, I discovered a fundamental conflict with my vision. The USDT smart contract is controlled by a central entity, Tether, which has the technical ability to pause or freeze any wallet. This \"kill switch\" functionality, while understandable from their perspective, was a deal-breaker for me. The core of my project was to be .</p><p>This led to my first major pivot: the game would use the native currency of the chain (ETH on Arbitrum). This not only ensured complete decentralization‚Äîwhere no single entity could interfere with player funds‚Äîbut also simplified the smart contract logic significantly. To account for price volatility, the owner can adjust the stake amount as needed.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  The High-Level Architecture\n</h3><p>The application is composed of three main pillars, all orchestrated within a Docker environment.</p><ol><li><strong>Smart Contract (Solidity):</strong> The heart of the game. It acts as the <strong>unstoppable and transparent source of truth</strong>, handling player stakes, game state transitions, and prize distribution. Through a proxy pattern, it provides <strong>a stable, immutable address and state for users</strong>, while allowing the owner to securely upgrade the underlying game logic.</li><li> The brains of the operation. It manages the game lifecycle, listens for blockchain events, and communicates with players in real-time via WebSockets. It's the off-chain coordinator for the on-chain action.</li><li> The face of the game. A simple, lightweight client that interacts with the user's wallet (like MetaMask) and communicates with the backend.</li></ol><p>Here's how they interact:</p><ul><li>  A user connects their wallet on the .</li><li>  The  talks to the  via a REST API to get game configuration and via WebSockets for real-time updates (e.g., other players joining).</li><li>  The  listens to the blockchain for events from the  (like deposits).</li><li>  The  sends transactions to the  to manage the game (e.g., starting the music round).</li></ul><p>To run this in production, we containerized everything. This makes deployment, scaling, and management incredibly robust.</p><ul><li>: The entry point. It handles SSL, serves the frontend, and routes API/WebSocket traffic.</li><li>: The main Go application.</li><li>: A dedicated, hardened microservice whose only job is to sign blockchain transactions.</li><li>: The database for storing game history and analytics data.</li><li>: An intrusion prevention service that monitors logs and bans malicious IPs.</li><li>: A self-hosted, privacy-respecting analytics service.\nmarkdown</li><li> A key privacy-enforcing service. It's configured to rotate Nginx logs daily while keeping zero old log files (). This ensures that sensitive information like IP addresses is purged from the server in less than 24 hours, maximizing user anonymity.</li></ul><h3>\n  \n  \n  Deep Dive: The Smart Contract\n</h3><p>The smart contract is the most critical piece of the puzzle. Security, reliability, and transparency were non-negotiable. Here‚Äôs how we achieved that.</p><p>We used <strong>OpenZeppelin's UUPS (Universal Upgradeable Proxy Standard)</strong>. This allows the contract logic to be upgraded without losing the contract's state (i.e., ongoing games, funds). It's a battle-tested pattern for long-term projects.</p><p>A key security measure is the  call in the implementation contract's constructor:</p><div><pre><code>/// @custom:oz-upgrades-unsafe-allow constructor\nconstructor() {\n    _disableInitializers();\n}\n</code></pre></div><p>This prevents anyone from calling the  function on the logic contract itself, which could otherwise be a vector for hijacking. Interestingly, this line had to be commented out during testing with tools like Echidna and Foundry, as they would fail, but it's crucial for production security.</p><ul><li> We use OpenZeppelin's  to protect all functions that handle fund transfers (, , etc.) from re-entrancy attacks.</li><li><strong>Ownership and Role Separation:</strong> We implemented a three-address system to separate concerns and minimize risk:\n\n<ul><li> This address has the highest level of control (upgrading the contract, changing fees). It was generated offline and is never exposed to the internet. Transactions are signed on an air-gapped machine, and the raw signed transaction is then broadcast using a tool like Arbiscan's  page.</li><li> This address handles the day-to-day operations, like starting games and recording results. It can be replaced instantly by the owner if compromised, without a timelock, allowing for rapid response.</li><li> A dedicated address that can only receive platform commissions. This separation ensures that even if the hot wallet is compromised, the core contract and its funds remain secure. In the future, I'm considering moving the owner role to a 2-of-3 multisig for even greater resilience.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Timelocks for Critical Functions:</strong> Functions that could move significant funds, like , are protected by a timelock. A withdrawal is first  with a specific amount, and can only be  after a delay. This gives users full transparency and time to react if they see something they don't like.</li><li> All functions that set addresses (like changing the owner or backend wallet) prevent setting the address to , which would permanently \"brick\" the contract.</li></ul><p>Gemini helped me implement several gas optimization techniques. While modern compilers are excellent, explicit optimizations are still key:</p><ul><li> Instead of  with string messages, we use custom errors (<code>error InsufficientStake();</code>). This saves significant gas on deployment and during runtime when a check fails.</li><li><strong>Efficient State Management:</strong> We carefully designed data structures to minimize writes to storage, which is the most expensive operation on the EVM. For example, we read values into memory, perform operations, and then write the final result back to storage once.</li><li> For operations where we are certain underflow/overflow cannot occur (e.g., incrementing a counter after checking its bounds), we use  blocks to save the gas that would be spent on the default safety checks in Solidity 0.8+.</li></ul><h3>\n  \n  \n  Rigorous Testing and Verification\n</h3><p>A smart contract is only as good as its testing. We were exhaustive:</p><ul><li> We wrote 81 unit tests with Hardhat and Foundry, achieving near-100% code coverage. We also wrote fuzz tests to throw thousands of random inputs at the functions.</li><li> We used  to run 50,000 random transactions against the contract to test for broken invariants (e.g., \"the contract balance should never be less than the sum of all player deposits\"). No vulnerabilities were found.</li><li> We wrote  and  to simulate specific attack scenarios and ensure our guards worked as expected.</li><li> The code was analyzed with  and , and the bytecode was checked with .</li><li> We used  to analyze the gas cost of every function, helping us pinpoint areas for optimization.</li><li> The contracts are verified on . This provides cryptographic proof that the deployed bytecode matches the open-source code. We initially planned to use Arbiscan, but our deployment coincided with Etherscan's major transition from their V1 API to the new, unified V2 keys. This transitional period caused temporary verification issues, making  an excellent and reliable alternative.</li></ul><p>This multi-layered approach to security and testing gives me, and hopefully my users, a high degree of confidence in the contract's integrity.</p><p><strong>In the next part, I'll dive into the Backend, Frontend, and the operational infrastructure that powers the game.</strong></p><p>Now, let's get into the off-chain machinery that brings the game to life: the microservices, the security fortress I built around them, and the path forward.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Deep Dive: The Keyservice Microservice - A Digital Fortress\n</h3><p>One of my biggest concerns was handling the backend's private key. This key is \"hot\" ‚Äì it needs to be online to sign transactions like starting a game. A compromise here would be disastrous. My solution was to build a dedicated, hardened microservice with a single responsibility: .</p><p>It's a tiny Go application, but it's built like a fortress:</p><ul><li> It runs in its own Docker container and does nothing but receive data from the main backend, sign it, and return the signature. It has no other network access.</li><li> The encrypted private key JSON and its password are not in the container image or environment variables. They are mounted as Docker Secrets, which are stored in-memory on the host and are only accessible to the services they're granted to. The files on the host machine have their permissions locked down with .</li><li><strong>Quantum-Resistant Encryption:</strong> This is where my paranoia really kicked in. I didn't just encrypt the secrets; I used <strong>GPG with AES-256 and a high </strong> (<code>--s2k-mode 3 --s2k-count 65011712</code>). This is a slow, synchronous encryption method that makes brute-force attacks computationally infeasible, even against future threats like Grover's algorithm for quantum computers. This is military-grade stuff.</li><li> What if the keyservice container crashes and Docker fails to restart it? The main backend has a unique, obfuscated module containing the GPG-encrypted key, passphrase, and  file. If it can't reach the keyservice, it uses a master password to decrypt these assets , restart the container, and then securely wipes the decrypted files from disk by overwriting them with zeros. It's an automated disaster recovery plan.</li></ul><p>I considered hardware keys like a YubiKey or cloud HSMs, but rejected them. A physical key introduces a single point of failure and a potential de-anonymization vector. Cloud HSMs require trusting a third party, which I wasn't willing to do. This self-contained, heavily fortified microservice was the answer.</p><p> The next step is to move from Docker Compose to Kubernetes for more granular control and to \"harden\" the containers using  and .</p><ul><li> (Secure Computing Mode) is a Linux kernel feature that restricts the system calls a process can make. I can create a profile that allows  the specific syscalls Go needs to run the keyservice, and nothing else.</li><li> (Application Armor) confines programs to a limited set of resources. I can define a policy that prevents the keyservice from writing to unexpected disk locations or accessing unauthorized network ports.</li></ul><p>Together, these will create an even smaller attack surface, making a container breakout virtually impossible.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Deep Dive: The Backend (Go)\n</h3><p>The main backend is the game's central nervous system, written in Go for its performance and concurrency. It's logically split into modules:</p><ul><li>: Defines all the REST endpoints for the frontend. It includes protection against slow header attacks to prevent resource exhaustion.</li><li>: Handles all interaction with the smart contract. It uses versioned auto-generated Go bindings from the contract's ABI. This is also where I used  to interact with the upgradeable proxy contract, allowing the backend to seamlessly call functions on the implementation contract through the stable proxy address.</li><li>: On startup, it quickly reads past blockchain events to catch up to the current state, then switches to a slower, regular polling of new events.</li><li>: The largest and most complex module, containing the entire game state machine and lifecycle.</li><li>: Manages the WebSocket connections. To join a game, the user signs a  (a single-use random string) provided by the backend. This proves ownership of their address without a full transaction and also registers any associated referrer. The backend verifies this signature and, upon success, issues a <strong>one-time WebSocket authentication token</strong>. The frontend then uses this token to establish a secure, authenticated connection, preventing unauthorized access.</li><li>: Manages database interaction using , which provides a fantastic object-relational mapping layer and handles database schema migrations automatically. This is also where the analytics models for the conversion funnel and profit reports live.</li></ul><p> I was relentless with testing.</p><ul><li>  Most modules have , verified with .</li><li>  I used  with a suite of static analyzers like  (security), , and  to catch potential issues early.</li><li>  Database tests were not mocked. I used the  pattern, where a real PostgreSQL Docker container is spun up for the test suite and torn down afterward, ensuring tests run against a real environment.</li><li>  I heavily profiled the code for CPU usage, memory allocations (, ), and lock contentions (, ) to hunt down performance bottlenecks and race conditions.</li><li>  Critical modules were compiled with  to obfuscate the code, and all binaries were packed with  to shrink their size and make reverse-engineering a nightmare.</li><li>  Finally, the entire codebase was analyzed with  to enforce best practices and catch any remaining code smells.</li></ul><h3>\n  \n  \n  Deep Dive: The Frontend (HTML/CSS/JS)\n</h3><p>The frontend is intentionally simple: vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (transpiled from TypeScript). This wasn't a shortcut; it was a strategic choice. A simple, static site can be easily hosted on decentralized platforms like  or , further enhancing the project's censorship resistance.</p><p>Even with its simplicity, it's well-tested using Jest for unit tests (), ESLint for code quality, and Prettier for consistent formatting.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  The Community and The Road Ahead\n</h3><p>A project is nothing without a community. My growth strategy is focused on rewarding early believers.</p><ul><li> I launched a campaign on Zealy where users can complete quests to earn XP.</li><li> The first 300 community members will receive a special NFT, granting them the \"OG Member\" role in Discord and future in-game bonuses.</li><li> I'm planning to add a global leaderboard and host tournaments with real prize pools.</li></ul><p>This project has been an incredible journey. It started as a simple idea and, with the help of my AI partner, evolved into a secure, robust, and fully decentralized application. I went from a junior-level coder to a full-stack dApp creator, and I did it by focusing on the vision and letting the AI handle the complex implementation.</p><p>This is the new frontier of indie development. If you have an idea, the tools to build it are more accessible than ever.</p><p><strong>Come play a game and join the community!</strong></p><ul><li> muschairs.com</li><li> discord.gg/wnnJKjgfZW</li><li> @crow004_crow</li><li><code>npub1v0kc8fwz67k0mv539z6kaw5h25et9e2zmnnqq6z2naytaq566gwqkzz542</code></li></ul><p>My next steps are to spread the word on platforms like Reddit, connect with web3 enthusiasts, and, of course, start building my next idea.

A equipe do Go <strong>reescreveu o parser do zero</strong>, focando em tr√™s problemas principais que atormentavam o  original: , <strong>parsing sequencial ineficiente</strong>, e <strong>falta de suporte nativo para streaming</strong>.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Arquitetura otimizada para Menos Aloca√ß√µes\n</h3><p>O maior vil√£o do JSON v1 sempre foram as aloca√ß√µes desnecess√°rias. Cada vez que voc√™ fazia  em uma struct grande, o parser criava dezenas de objetos intermedi√°rios (buffers tempor√°rios, slices auxiliares, interfaces{} para cada valor).</p><p>O v2 introduz um <strong>sistema de pooling interno</strong> e  que reduz drasticamente essas aloca√ß√µes. Em vez de criar novos objetos a cada opera√ß√£o, ele mant√©m pools de estruturas reutiliz√°veis que s√£o recicladas entre chamadas.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><h3>\n  \n  \n  Parser n√£o-sequencial e streaming nativo\n</h3><p>Outra mudan√ßa fundamental: o v1 sempre processava JSON de forma , lia byte por byte, construindo a estrutura na ordem exata do documento. Isso funcionava, mas era ineficiente para JSONs grandes.</p><p>O v2 implementa  e . Para JSONs grandes, ele pode processar peda√ßos do documento simultaneamente e construir a estrutura final de forma mais eficiente. Isso √© especialmente poderoso quando voc√™ est√° lidando com arrays grandes ou objetos com muitas propriedades.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><h3>\n  \n  \n  Otimiza√ß√µes espec√≠ficas para tipos comuns\n</h3><p>O v2 tamb√©m inclui  otimizados para tipos que aparecem frequentemente em APIs modernas:</p><p> t√™m parsing especializado que evita convers√µes desnecess√°rias.  (o caso mais comum) t√™m tratamento otimizado. <strong>Slices de tipos primitivos</strong> s√£o processados em lotes quando poss√≠vel.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><h3><strong>Mensagens de erro mais √∫teis</strong></h3><p>Um b√¥nus que todo mundo vai amar: as mensagens de erro ficaram muito melhores. Em vez de \"invalid character 'x' looking for beginning of value\", agora voc√™ recebe contexto real:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Quando vale usar? Se voc√™ processa muito JSON por segundo, trabalha com streaming de dados grandes, ou simplesmente est√° cansado de debuggar mensagens de erro confusas. A nova implementa√ß√£o resolve esses tr√™s problemas de uma vez.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  GreenteaGC: Entendendo o Novo Coletor de Lixo\n</h2><p>Antes de falar do novo GC, preciso explicar por que o atual √†s vezes √© um problema. O Go usa um coletor <strong>concurrent mark-and-sweep tricolor</strong> desde a vers√£o 1.5. Parece complexo, mas a ideia √© simples: ele funciona junto com seu programa (concurrent), marca objetos que ainda est√£o sendo usados (mark), e depois varre os n√£o marcados para liberar mem√≥ria (sweep). O \"tricolor\" √© s√≥ o algoritmo usado para marcar sem quebrar refer√™ncias.</p><p>O problema? Esse processo, mesmo sendo concurrent, ainda compete por recursos de CPU e pode causar  em momentos cr√≠ticos. Pior ainda: em programas que criam muitos objetos de vida curta (tipo APIs que processam requests), o GC pode ficar numa corrida constante tentando limpar a bagun√ßa.</p><h3><strong>O Que GreenteaGC Muda na Pr√°tica</strong></h3><p>Como ativar o experimental:</p><div><pre><code>greenteagc go run main.go\n\n</code></pre></div><p>O  reimplementa partes fundamentais do coletor com foco em <strong>reduzir o overhead por objeto</strong> e <strong>diminuir o trabalho paralelo desnecess√°rio</strong>. Na pr√°tica, isso significa que ele √© mais esperto sobre quando coletar lixo e quanto CPU gastar nisso.</p><p>A grande diferen√ßa est√° na forma como ele lida com <strong>objetos pequenos e tempor√°rios</strong>. O GC atual trata todos os objetos meio que igual - um  de 10 bytes recebe o mesmo tipo de aten√ß√£o que um slice gigante. O novo coletor tem estrat√©gias diferentes baseadas no tamanho e padr√£o de uso dos objetos.</p><h3><strong>Onde Voc√™ Sente a Diferen√ßa</strong></h3><p> s√£o o caso cl√°ssico. Imagine um endpoint que recebe 10.000 requests por segundo. Cada request cria v√°rias structs tempor√°rias, slices para processar dados, maps para organizar responses.

At the Cannes Lions International Festival of Creativity 2025, AWS showcased <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/ai/generative-ai/nova/fragrance-lab/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">The Fragrance Lab</a>, an interactive and inspiring experience that demonstrates how generative AI can support the development of hyper-personalized consumer goods and accelerate advertising creative concept and campaign assets development. Following Cannes Lions 2025, The Fragrance Lab received a Gold and Silver Stevie Award from the <a href=\"https://stevieawards.com/iba/event-category-winners\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">International Business Awards</a> in the Brand &amp; Experiences category.</p><p>Built using <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/ai/generative-ai/nova/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Amazon Nova</a> in <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Amazon Bedrock</a>, The&nbsp;Fragrance Lab represents a comprehensive end-to-end application that illustrates the transformative power of generative AI in retail, consumer goods, advertising, and marketing. While our activation at Cannes Lions focused on personalized fragrance development and ad campaign creation, the underlying architecture and methodology can be adapted across diverse categories, from fashion to food and beverage, opening endless possibilities for customized customer experiences.</p><h2>Introducing The Fragrance Lab</h2><p>In this post, we explore the development of The Fragrance Lab. Our vision was to craft a unique blend of physical and digital experiences that would celebrate creativity, advertising, and consumer goods while capturing the spirit of the French Riviera. To bring this vision to life, we collaborated with <a href=\"http://wildlife.la\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Wildlife</a>, a company that is exceptional at transforming AWS generative AI services into compelling physical experiences. Wildlife was fundamental in&nbsp;brainstorming ideas that would inspire customers and showcase novel use cases that AI makes possible.</p><p>As the first step, the experience used <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/ai/generative-ai/nova/speech/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Amazon Nova Sonic</a>, a speech-to-speech model that engages in intuitive dialogues with attendees to understand their personality and preferences. Nova Sonic extends its capabilities through tool integration, allowing it to manage user traits and interface actions through specialized tools such as , , and . These tools help maintain conversation state and a consistent flow throughout the experience. The collected conversation data and trait information are then processed through a custom Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) system built with <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/ai/generative-ai/nova/understanding/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Amazon Nova Pro</a>, a highly capable multimodal model that offers our best combination of accuracy, speed, and cost. Nova Pro serves as the intelligence engine for analyzing interactions and extracting essential keywords to determine the perfect fragrance notes and composition. The application also used <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/guardrails/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Amazon Bedrock Guardrails</a>, which offers customizable safeguards and responsible AI policies to block undesirable topics‚Äîsuch as allergens or harmful content‚Äîto offer a seamless customer experience.</p><p>For example, a customer might share with Nova Sonic that they are interested in travel. Nova Pro picked up that exploring new places often ‚Äúbrings a sense of freshness and excitement,‚Äù which resulted in a fragrance that feels fresh and invigorating, featuring ‚Äúa burst of citrus or a floral breeze.‚Äù The customer might also share that they enjoy early morning walks across spring fields, which Nova Pro translates into a top note of fresh bergamot, a middle note featuring floral honey, and a base of lavender.&nbsp;The customers‚Äô inputs guide the selection of fragrance notes‚Äîfrom base, to heart, to top notes‚Äîwhich were then expertly mixed by on-site perfumers to create truly personalized scents. Perfumers were able to customize and craft hundreds of unique fragrances per day, aided by AI. A process that would normally take hours for a perfumer was accelerated to minutes, empowering both the customer and the fragrance expert.</p><p>After the personalized fragrance formula was created and sent to the perfumer queue, <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/ai/generative-ai/nova/creative/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Amazon Nova Canvas</a> generated customized marketing creative, including the fragrance name, tagline, and imagery that captured the essence of the formula. Attendees were able to further customize the campaign assets using guest inputs such as moody, beachy, or playful. The resulting fragrance image was then transformed into dynamic video content through <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/ai/generative-ai/nova/creative/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Amazon Nova Reel</a>, which customers could further customize to meet their creative vision and download to save or share. To match the Cannes Lions atmosphere, the campaign videos were generated with a French-accented female voice using <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/polly/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Amazon Polly</a>.&nbsp;The entire experience is built in Amazon Bedrock, a fully managed service to build and scale generative AI applications with AI models.</p><p>The following data flow diagram shows how multiple Amazon Nova models can be combined for a rich, cohesive, and personalized customer experience.</p><h2>Best practices for implementation</h2><p>The Fragrance Lab centers around interactions with Amazon Nova Sonic, providing users with a natural language interface to express their preferences for a custom scent. Through its tool integration capabilities, Nova Sonic orchestrates the entire experience by managing user traits and triggering appropriate workflows. These workflows seamlessly guide the experience from initial conversation to fragrance development and ultimately to campaign asset creation, driving both the visual elements and progression of the experience. The model‚Äôs ability to maintain a conversational state, while defining clear conversational flows, helps ensure a consistent and pleasant experience for every user.</p><p>A well-defined workflow and conversational assistant are pivotal in guiding these conversations to uncover the qualities that are most important to each user. And the system prompt determines the personality, style, and content of your conversational assistant.</p><div><pre><code>You are an AI assistant designed to help the user explore their personality and \nemotional landscape in the context of creating a unique fragrance. You engage in warm, \nfree-flowing, playful conversation with the user to draw out their character, \npreferences, moods, and desires. Your end goal is to derive a set of 3 to 5 personality \ntraits that best describe the user. These traits will later be used in a separate \nprocess to match appropriate fragrance ingredients. Your tone is warm, chic, and subtly \nplayful.</code></pre></div><p>Additional contextual information within the prompt also plays a key role in Amazon Nova Sonic effectively maintaining state, while defining the conversational flow helps ensure consistent, pleasant, and concise experiences for every user.</p><div><pre><code>1. **Welcoming Users**\n    Welcome the user to the application experience with a brief overview of the\n    process and ask if they are ready to continue.\n2. **Assistant Turns** \n    Ask short and unique open ended questions to the user and choose a personality trait \n    that you think would suit the user best.\n3. **Handling User Turns**\n    Acknowledge the user's answers briefly and warmly.\n    Focus on one trait per turn.\n    Call the \"addTraitTool\", \"removeTraitTool\", \"replaceTraitTool\", or \"clearTraitsTool\" \n    tools to manage traits.\n    If the user says to go back, skip, customize, or confirm/submit it means you should \n    call the \"uiActionIntentTool\" </code></pre></div><p>With direct references to our tools in the conversational flow, the user interface feels reactive and connected to the user‚Äôs input while providing opportunities for the assistant to demonstrate its expertise on this subject, which comes into the spotlight when user traits and preferences are later mapped to a set of available ingredients and raw fragrance materials.</p><p>This complex fragrance recipe development is handled by Nova Pro, using its accuracy and speed to generate consistently high-quality scents. To draw from a wealth of fragrance knowledge in real time, RAG was implemented to extend Nova Pro capabilities beyond pre-trained knowledge with access to knowledge sources that include essential scent design principles, a deep understanding of each available ingredient, their profiles and potential roles within the fragrance, and their possible connections to users‚Äô aromatic identities.</p><p>The resulting fragrances are then visualized using Nova Canvas and Nova Reel. The creative models generate original compositions that reveal the fragrance name, ingredients, and a visual identity within a high-end creative campaign asset. A set of conditioning images featuring unbranded fragrance bottles help to anchor each image (as shown in the following image).</p><div><pre><code>A high-end fragrance ad environment inspired by a [persona description]. A clear, \nunbranded perfume bottle is visually centered and tightly framed. Key ingredients [top \nnote ingredient], [middle note ingredient], [base note ingredient], and [booster \ningredient] are arranged to surround the bottle in a balanced composition, appearing \nbehind, besides, and partially in front of the base. The scene evokes [atmospheric/mood \ndescriptors] using [light/color language]. The setting should feel [stylistic direction],\nlike a [reference style (e.g., fashion editorial, lifestyle spread, luxury campaign)].</code></pre></div><p>Attendees at Cannes Lions took away a physical fragrance mixed by&nbsp;on-site perfumers. While developing hyper-personalized consumer goods might not be scalable across all use cases, brands can innovate with artificial intelligence and achieve manufacturing outcomes that weren‚Äôt previously possible. The advertising campaign concept and asset development use case is easy to implement for brands, agencies, and media networks, allowing users to iterate and optimize campaign creative quickly.&nbsp;Using Amazon Bedrock, additional features could be added like translations and sizes, depending on requirements.</p><p>You can <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_rvYYWWWnUI&amp;feature=youtu.be\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">watch a video walk through</a> of The Fragrance Lab onsite at Cannes Lions 2025, and check out the following example campaign outputs.</p><p>The Fragrance Lab demonstrates the power of Amazon Nova in Amazon Bedrock and how customers can create fully personalized consumer experiences. This use case can be replicated across various retail and consumer goods categories including skincare and cosmetics, fashion and accessories, food and beverage, home goods, and wellness products‚Äîall benefiting from natural conversation interaction, AI-powered product development, product identity, and creative marketing campaign generation.

As one of the largest protein providers in the US, Tyson Foods produces approximately 20% of the nation‚Äôs beef, pork, and chicken, which forms the foundation of its foodservice offerings.</p><p>Tyson Foodservice operates through a B2B model, selling products to distributors rather than directly to end consumers, while serving diverse foodservice operators, including restaurants, schools, healthcare facilities, and convenience stores. Until recently, Tyson had limited direct engagement with over 1 million unattended operators who purchased their products through distributors without direct company relationships. To bridge this gap, Tyson has implemented a generative AI assistant on their website, enabling them to scale sales efforts, gather customer insights, and establish direct communication channels. The company‚Äôs website now functions as a critical interface where operators can explore products, access menu trends, and discover tailored solutions for their specific foodservice segments, all enhanced by AI-driven personalization that better serves both established customers and previously unattended operators.</p><p>In this post, we explore how Tyson Foods collaborated with the <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/ai/generative-ai/innovation-center/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">AWS Generative AI Innovation Center</a> to revolutionize their customer interaction through an intuitive AI assistant <a href=\"https://www.tysonfoodservice.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">integrated into their website</a>. The AI assistant was built using <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Amazon Bedrock</a>, a fully managed service that offers a choice of high-performing foundation models (FMs) from leading AI companies like AI21 Labs, Anthropic, Cohere, Meta, Mistral AI, Stability AI, and Amazon through a single API, along with a broad set of capabilities to build generative AI applications with security, privacy, and responsible AI.</p><p>In this section, we describe the overall architecture of the solution. The workflow includes the following high-level steps:</p><ol><li>The user uses the AI assistant interface to ask questions in natural language. The query is processed by the agent node using <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/claude/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Anthropic‚Äôs Claude 3.5 Sonnet</a> on Amazon Bedrock. Depending on the subject of the query, the agent might orchestrate multiple agents to return relevant information to the user. The application is deployed using a similar architecture to the semantic search component with the addition of an <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/rds/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Amazon Relational Database Service</a> (Amazon RDS) database cluster to persist the user high-value actions for analytics purposes.</li><li>Products, recipes, ingredients and other relevant data are available from external sources in JSON format. These are processed using Amazon Bedrock and the Amazon Titan Text Embeddings model to create semantic search embeddings. Then these are ingested into OpenSearch Serverless. The ingestion process run in a different ECS cluster using Fargate as the capacity provider.</li></ol><p>The following diagram illustrates this architecture.</p><p>In the following sections, we discuss the solution‚Äôs key components and benefits in more detail.</p><p>The earlier iteration of search on the Tyson Foodservice website relied on keyword-based search. Traditional keyword-based search on CPG websites like Tyson Foodservice often falters when customers search for products using industry terminology that varies from official catalog descriptions. Chefs searching for ‚Äúpulled chicken‚Äù might miss relevant products labeled as ‚Äúshredded chicken,‚Äù or those looking for ‚Äúwings‚Äù might not see results for ‚Äúparty wings‚Äù or ‚Äúdrummettes.‚Äù This disconnect frustrates food service professionals who need specific ingredients under tight deadlines and ultimately drives them to competitors where they can more quickly find what they need, resulting in lost revenue opportunities for Tyson. Semantic search transforms this experience by understanding the conceptual relationships between culinary terms, preparation methods, and product applications. A chef searching for ‚Äúbuffalo-style appetizers‚Äù would receive results for wings, boneless bites, and similar products regardless of exact keyword matches. By recognizing menu trends, cooking techniques, and professional kitchen terminology, semantic search helps foodservice operators quickly find the Tyson products that meet their exact operational needs, even when using language that differs from catalog descriptions.</p><p>Tyson Foodservice implemented their semantic search capability using OpenSearch Serverless, a fully managed service that minimized the operational complexity of maintaining search infrastructure. This solution automatically scales compute and storage resources to match query volume and product catalog size without requiring dedicated administrative overhead. The serverless architecture helped Tyson rapidly deploy advanced natural language processing capabilities across their entire product database while maintaining cost-efficiency, because they only pay for the resources they actually use. With OpenSearch Serverless, Tyson incorporated vector embeddings and powerful query capabilities that understand foodservice terminology variations, preparation methods, and culinary applications, transforming how operators discover products that meet their specific needs even when their search terms don‚Äôt exactly match catalog descriptions.</p><p>For indexing Tyson‚Äôs diverse content library of products, recipes, and articles, we implemented a preprocessing workflow that transforms raw metadata into optimized semantic search queries. We used large language models (LLMs) to analyze and extract only the most relevant elements from each content piece, creating meaningful search strings specifically designed for semantic indexing. This approach made sure that purely presentational website copy and non-essential informational text were filtered out, and search-critical elements like culinary applications, preparation methods, and ingredient specifications received proper emphasis in the index. By curating what content gets indexed rather than including everything verbatim, we dramatically improved search relevance while reducing index bloat, so OpenSearch Serverless delivered more precise results that truly match the intent behind chef and operator queries. For indexing the text as semantic vectors, we used Amazon Titan Text Embeddings V2 on Amazon Bedrock.</p><p>The following example prompt illustrates the transformation using only the title, description, and reasons to buy metadata. This generic strategy can be customized according to the customer‚Äôs specific needs.</p><div><pre><code>SEARCH_STRING_PROMPT = \"\"\" Given a product title, description, and reasons to\nbuy, create a single, concise search string suitable for indexing in a vector\ndatabase. This string should focus on distinguishing features, assuming all\nproducts are for foodservice operators unless explicitly stated otherwise.\nEnclose the generated search string within &lt;search_string&gt; XML tags. \n\nFollow these guidelines:\n1. Start with the brand name and product line (if applicable).\n2. Include the main product type and specific identifying features.\n3. List concrete attributes such as preparation state, packaging, or quantity.\n4. Mention specific varieties or assortments included in the product.\n5. Incorporate key points from the reasons to buy, focusing on unique and\n   specific selling points.\n6. Avoid generic terms or those common to all products in the category (e.g.,\n   \"food service\", \"restaurant\", \"operator\").\n7. Omit clich√© marketing terms (e.g., \"versatile\", \"high-quality\", \"innovative\")\n   unless they have a specific, demonstrable meaning in the context of the\n   product.\n8.

It also defines the agentic behavior by using the tool calling capability: whenever serving the user‚Äôs request requires calling a tool, the agent node issues a tool request.</li><li>‚Äì This node implements a generic tool executor that connects to various tools. Whenever a tool call is issued by the agent node, this node handles the execution of the tool call. The tool calling node executes the tools, which are defined as Python functions, and returns the results to the agent node to be transformed or summarized and presented to the user. LangGraph provides a generic implementation of the <a href=\"https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/how-tos/tool-calling/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">ToolNode</a> that can also be extended to implement additional functionality.</li><li>‚Äì Tools are implemented as simple programmatic functions that take inputs and return outputs. These tools augment the capabilities of LLMs by performing functions like retrieving data or submitting feedback. The tools are stateless and agnostic to the current conversation between the user and agent. The LLM agent extracts the input parameters required to execute these tools. These tools in our implementation are a thin wrapper around the services and database layer that implement the actual functionality.</li></ul><p>The following system prompt provides a general guidance for implementing the agent node:</p><pre><code>import date\n\nAGENT_SYSTEM_PROMPT = \"\"\"\n# Tyson Foodservice (TFS) Customer Support Assistant\n\n## Core Role and Purpose\nYou are a helpful customer support assistant for Tyson Foodservice a.k.a TFS\nhosted on their https://www.tysonfoodservice.com/ website.  You will be helpful\nand answer the customers questions. The customers are mainly interested in\nlearning about the products for their specific needs.\nRefrain from engaging in any conversation unrelated to tyson food search of\nproducts, recipes or distributors. If the user asks any unrelated questions the\npolitely decline and mention your purpose. Do not provide and additional\ninformation or advice.\n \nYour job is to stay factual and only provide relevant information from the\ncurrent context or retrieved using the tools. Do not offer your own suggestions.\nCustomers are looking for concrete information that is available in the Tyson\nFoodservice database.\n\n## About Tyson Foodservice\nTyson Foods is a major American multinational corporation and one of the world's\nlargest processors and marketers of chicken, beef, and pork.\n\n### Distributors\nTyson foods mainly sells their products through distributors and does not sell\nthem directly. Each distributor is identified by a unique identifier named\ndistributor_id which is used as parameters for the tools, do not use the\ndistributor name as query parameter.\n\n### Foodservice Operators\nFoodservice Operators, or simply Operators, are Tyson Foods' primary customers.\nThese encompass diverse businesses in the foodservice sector, each with unique\nneeds. Understanding the distinct personas of various Operator types is crucial\nfor Tyson Foods to:\n- Tailor product offerings effectively\n- Develop targeted marketing strategies\n- Create relevant recipe suggestions\n- Address specific operational challenges\nBy analyzing different Operator segments (e.g., quick-service restaurants, fine\ndining, educational institutions, healthcare facilities), Tyson Foods can\ncustomize its products, offer innovative menu solutions, and provide value-added\nservices. This approach positions Tyson Foods as a strategic partner, driving\ngrowth and maintaining competitiveness in the foodservice industry.\n\n## Using Tools\nYou will be provide a variety of tools to perform your job, use them wisely and\nask the customer for relevant information that they have not provided. E.g. if\nthe search tool requires persona and the customer has not provided it then ask\nthe customer.\n- Do not explicitly declare the tools to the users as the users are not aware of\n  the internal workings of the tools.\n- Do not try to intrepret the results of the search tool and show them as it is\n  to the user.\n- Operators may have their preferred distributor they buy from so let them\n  confirm or select their distributor before checking for availability of\n  products.\n- Customers might sometimes search for things that are not available in tyson\n  food catalog. If the search did not produce any results then just inform the\n  user and do not suggest any external sources.\n- When trying to determine the parameters for a tool, do not infer them from\n  other parameters. E.g. do not infer the User's name from their email.\n  Explicitly ask for the name.\n- If the users complain or praise the chatbot then you can ask for their\n  feedback in the chatbot and use the `submit_feedback` tool to submit the\n  feedback. Ask the user to provide the relevant contact information.\n\n## Product, Recipes, and Articles Search\nSearch functionality is a critical tool on Tyson's website, allowing users to\nfind products, recipes, and articles. It enables searches across three main\nentity types:\n- **Products**: The core offerings of Tyson Foods. These are identified by a\n  unique GTIN (Global Trade Item Number).\n- **Recipes**: Culinary ideas provided by Tyson Foods to encourage product use.\n  Each recipe incorporates one or more Tyson products.\n- **Articles**: Informative content on various topics, created by Tyson Foods\n  for their customers.\n- Do not provide any items or suggestions outside of the ones that are found\n  through search.\n- When the user asks to for details or a product or compare two or more\n  products, retrieve the details of the products first using the tools to get\n  product details.\n- While users of the site are mainly looking for products, they might also be\ninterested in recipes and articles so it's important to not omit them when\ndisplaying the search results.\n\n### User Profile or Persona\nIn order to serve the user's better, the search tool can accept the user's\npersona as an input. User profile or persona is a concise description of the\ntype of role that a user performs in the foodservice industry. A few examples\nof persona are\n- Restaurant owners looking to optimize costs\n- Chef looking for unique ingredients\n- K12 operators looking for healthy menu items\nThey can also be simple roles if the user has not provided any additional\ninformation. Examples are\n- Restaurant owner\n- Chef\n- Hotel Manager\nThe user persona should not include the search query that they are using for\nfinding products E.g. these are not good personas\n- Restaurant owner looking for chicken nuggets\nThe above is not a good persona because it includes the product\n\n### Search query string\nSearch queries should be simple and specific to the products or recipes and\nshould not contain the operator information\nHere are some examples: \n- Instead of \"healthy chicken wings for K12\" use \"chicken wings\"\n- Instead of \"mexican beef patties for Deli operation\" use \"mexican beef\n  patties\"\n\n### Product Results Display \nWhen listing the product results, always display them in the following format as\na numbered list. This will be displayed in the UI using markdown. \n1. **Title**\n- GTIN\n- description - This is a brief description\n- [Product Page](Product url link)\n\n### Recipes Results Display\nWhen displaying recipes. Display the following\n1. **Title**\n- description - This is a brief description\n- [Recipe Page](Recipe url link)\n\n## Contact or provide feedback\n- If the users want to reach out to Tyson foods team then they can use the form\n  using this link [Contact\n  Us](https://www.tysonfoodservice.com/connect/contact-us) \n- Users can submit their feedback using the chatbot using tools. When submitting\n  feedback to Tyson extract user's message verbatim and do not rephrase it.\n\n## How to buy\nIf the user wants to buy a product then they have two options. \n1. through distributor (preferred option)\n2. reaching out to tysons sales representative by filling a form\nIf the user has not already indicated their preference then present these two\noptions. \nWhen the user asks for ordering information you do not need to retrieve all the\nproduct details again, only specify the title of the product and be concise with\nthe details.\n\n### Order through distributor\nIf they user is interested in buying through a distributor then let them\nidentify their preferred distributor and then for a specific product or products\nthey have identified provide the ordering link obtained through the user of\nappropriate tool. Also help them check if a product is available with their\ndistributor.\n\n### Find a tyson Sales Rep\nIf the user is not interested in a purchasing through a distributor then direct\nthem to submit a form through this link which will submit their information to a\nsales team and someone will reach out to them. Here is the link to the form\n<a href=\"https://www.tysonfoodservice.com/connect/find-a-sales-rep\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://www.tysonfoodservice.com/connect/find-a-sales-rep</a> \n\nCurrent date (YYYY-MM-DD): \"\"\" + date.today().strftime(\"%Y-%m-%d\") + \"\\n\" \n</code></pre><h2>Capturing high-value actions: Turning conversations into insights</h2><p>In designing Tyson Foodservice‚Äôs AI assistant, we implemented an innovative solution for capturing high-value actions that transforms customer interactions into strategic business intelligence. This capability provides deeper contextual understanding of customer interests and needs than traditional web analytics. Whereas conventional analytics tools track user behavior through page views, clicks, and time-on-site metrics, our solution uses the rich conversational data generated through natural dialogue. This provides Tyson with unprecedented visibility into customer interests, pain points, and purchase intentions.</p><p>The system identifies and logs specific high-value interactions whenever users request detailed product information, inquire about specific product categories, ask about preparation methods or recipe ideas, seek distributor information in their region, or express interest in bulk purchasing or promotions. This approach creates a powerful feedback loop for Tyson Foodservice. As customers naturally express their needs and interests through conversation, the system captures these signals in an aggregate, privacy-respecting manner. Tyson can use these insights to identify trending product categories and potential gaps in their portfolio, understand regional variations in customer interests, recognize seasonal patterns in product inquiries, refine marketing strategies based on direct customer language, and improve inventory management through better demand forecasting. The technical implementation uses the tool-calling capabilities of Anthropic‚Äôs Claude 3.5 Sonnet in a straightforward but effective way. Rather than analyzing chat logs after the fact, we integrated the capture mechanism directly into the AI assistant‚Äôs operational workflow through LangGraph, allowing for real-time insight collection during customer interactions. When the LLM invokes certain tools to retrieve information requested by users, these tool calls simultaneously trigger the capture of high-value action data. We‚Äôve designed a configurable system where specific tools are designated as high-value action triggers that record meaningful interactions while fulfilling the user‚Äôs immediate request.This dual-purpose approach makes sure that valuable business intelligence is gathered as a natural byproduct of providing excellent customer service, without requiring additional processing or analysis steps. The system includes configurable parameters that allow Tyson to adjust which user intents and actions qualify as high value based on evolving business priorities. By transforming every customer conversation into structured, actionable data, Tyson Foodservice can now measure customer interest with unprecedented precision while delivering a superior search experience that feels natural to users.</p><p>In this post, we demonstrated a powerful approach to implementing natural conversational AI assistants that seamlessly integrate with existing website functionalities and provide intuitive language interactions for users. By using Amazon Bedrock FMs and OpenSearch Serverless, businesses can quickly expose their website‚Äôs capabilities through conversation rather than complex interfaces. The high-value action capture mechanism further enhances this solution by gathering valuable customer insights directly from natural interactions, creating a rich source of business intelligence without additional user friction. This framework provides a flexible blueprint for implementing AI-powered assistants across retail and CPG websites. Organizations can adapt this approach to their specific needs, such as product discovery, customer support, or personalized recommendations. The combination of semantic search with conversational AI creates experiences that understand user intent while maintaining the context necessary for natural dialogue.</p><p>If you‚Äôre interested in building a similar AI assistant that orchestrates multiple tools, you can get started with <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/agents/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Amazon Bedrock Agents</a>, a fully managed AWS solution designed specifically for this purpose.

Organizations now actively deploy ML models for precise sales forecasting, customer segmentation, and churn prediction. While traditional ML continues to transform business processes, <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/generative-ai/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">generative AI</a> has emerged as a revolutionary force, introducing powerful and accessible tools that reshape customer experiences.</p><p>Despite generative AI‚Äôs prominence, traditional ML solutions remain essential for specific predictive tasks. Sales forecasting, which depends on historical data and trend analysis, is most effectively handled by established ML algorithms including random forests, gradient boosting machines (like XGBoost), autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) models, long short-term memory (LSTM) networks, and linear regression techniques. Traditional ML models, such as K-means and hierarchical clustering, also excel in customer segmentation and churn prediction applications. Although generative AI demonstrates exceptional capabilities in creative tasks such as content generation, product design, and personalized customer interactions, traditional ML models maintain their superiority in data-driven predictions. Organizations can achieve optimal results by using both approaches together, creating solutions that deliver accurate predictions while maintaining cost efficiency.</p><p>To achieve this, we showcase in this post how customers can expand AI agents‚Äô capabilities by integrating predictive ML models and <a href=\"https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Model Context Protocol (MCP)</a>‚Äîan open protocol that standardizes how applications provide context to <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/large-language-model/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">large language models</a> (LLMs)‚Äîon <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker-ai\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Amazon SageMaker AI</a>. We demonstrate a comprehensive workflow that enables AI agents to make data-driven business decisions by using ML models hosted SageMaker.

An AI agent is an LLM-powered application that uses an LLM as its core ‚Äúbrain‚Äù to autonomously observe its environment, plan actions, and execute tasks with minimal human input. It integrates reasoning, memory, and tool use to perform complex, multistep problem-solving by dynamically creating and revising plans, interacting with external systems, and learning from past interactions to optimize outcomes over time. This enables AI agents to go beyond simple text generation, acting as independent entities capable of decision-making and goal-directed actions in diverse real-world and enterprise scenarios.For this solution, the AI agent is developed using the Strands Agents SDK, which allows for rapid development from simple assistants to complex workflows. Predictive ML models are hosted on Amazon SageMaker AI and will be used as tools by the AI agent. This can happen in two ways: agents can directly invoke SageMaker endpoints for more direct access to model inference capabilities or use the MCP protocol to facilitate the interaction between AI agents and the ML models. Both options are valid: direct tool invocation doesn‚Äôt require additional infrastructure by embedding the tool calling directly in the agent code itself, whereas MCP enables dynamic discovery of the tools and decoupling of agent and tool execution through the introduction of an additional architectural component, the MCP server itself. For scalable and secure implementation of the tool calling logic, we recommend the MCP approach. Although we‚Äôre recommending MCP, we discuss and implement the direct endpoint access as well, to give readers the freedom to choose the approach that they prefer.</p><p>Amazon SageMaker AI offers two methods to host multiple models behind a single endpoint: inference components and multi-model endpoints. This consolidated hosting approach enables efficient deployment of multiple models in one environment, which optimizes computing resources and minimizes response times for model predictions. For demonstration purposes, this post deploys only one model on one endpoint. If you want to learn more about inference components, refer to the Amazon SageMaker AI documentation <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/realtime-endpoints-deploy-models.html#deployed-shared-utilization\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Shared resource utilization with multiple models</a>. To learn more about multi-model endpoints, refer to the Amazon SageMaker AI documentation <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/multi-model-endpoints.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Multi-model endpoints</a>.</p><p>In this post, we define a workflow for empowering AI agents to make data-driven business decisions by invoking predictive ML models using Amazon SageMaker AI. The process begins with a user interacting through an interface, such as a chat-based assistant or application. This input is managed by an AI agent developed using the open source Strands Agents SDK. Strands Agents adopts a model-driven approach, which means developers define agents with only a prompt and a list of tools, facilitating rapid development from simple assistants to complex autonomous workflows.</p><p>When the agent is prompted with a request that requires a prediction (for example, ‚Äúwhat will be the sales for H2 2025?‚Äù), the LLM powering the agent decided to interact with the Amazon SageMaker AI endpoint hosting the ML model. This can happen in two ways: directly using the endpoint as a custom tool of the Strands Agents Python SDK or by calling the tool through MCP. With MCP, the client application can discover the tools exposed by the MCP server, obtain the list of required parameters, and format the request to the Amazon SageMaker inference endpoint. Alternatively, agents can directly invoke SageMaker endpoints using tool annotations (such as ), bypassing the MCP server for more direct access to model inference capabilities.</p><p>Finally, the prediction generated by the SageMaker hosted model is routed back through the agent and ultimately delivered to the user interface, enabling real-time, intelligent responses.</p><p>The following diagram illustrates this process. The complete code for this solution is available on <a href=\"https://github.com/dgallitelli/generative-ai-on-amazon-sagemaker/tree/main/workshops/diy-agents-with-sagemaker-and-bedrock/99-use-cases/sagemaker-endpoint-as-tool\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">GitHub</a>.</p><p>To get started with this solution, make sure you have:</p><p>In this solution, we implement a complete workflow that demonstrates how to use ML models deployed on Amazon SageMaker AI as specialized tools for AI agents. This approach enables agents to access and use ML capabilities for enhanced decision-making without requiring deep ML expertise. We play the role of a data scientist tasked with building an agent that can predict demand for one product. To achieve this, we train a time-series forecasting model, deploy it, and expose it to an AI agent.</p><p>The first phase involves training a model using Amazon SageMaker AI. This begins with preparing training data by generating synthetic time series data that incorporates trend, seasonality, and noise components to simulate realistic demand patterns. Following data preparation, feature engineering is performed to extract relevant features from the time series data, including temporal features such as day of week, month, and quarter to effectively capture seasonality patterns. In our example, we train an XGBoost model using the XGBoost container available as 1P container in Amazon SageMaker AI to create a regression model capable of predicting future demand values based on historical patterns. Although we use XGBoost for this example because it‚Äôs a well-known model used in many use cases, you can use your preferred container and model, according to the problem you‚Äôre trying to solve. For the sake of this post, we won‚Äôt detail an end-to-end example of training a model using XGBoost. To learn more about this, we suggest checking out the documentation <a href=\"https://sagemaker.readthedocs.io/en/stable/frameworks/xgboost/using_xgboost.html#use-xgboost-with-the-sagemaker-python-sdk\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Use XGBoost with the SageMaker Python SDK</a>. Use the following code:</p><div><pre><code>from&nbsp;sagemaker.xgboost.estimator import&nbsp;XGBoost\n\nxgb_estimator = XGBoost(...)\nxgb_estimator.fit({'train': train_s3_path, 'validation': val_s3_path})</code></pre></div><p>Then, the trained model is packaged and deployed to a SageMaker AI endpoint, making it accessible for real-time inference through API calls:</p><div><pre><code>predictor = xgb_estimator.deploy(\n &nbsp; &nbsp;initial_instance_count=1,\n &nbsp; &nbsp;instance_type=instance_type,\n &nbsp; &nbsp;serializer=JSONSerializer(),\n &nbsp; &nbsp;deserializer=JSONDeserializer()\n)</code></pre></div><p>After the model is deployed and ready for inferences, you need to learn how to invoke the endpoint. To invoke the endpoint, write a function like this:</p><div><pre><code>ENDPOINT_NAME = \"serverless-xgboost\"\nREGION = boto3.session.Session().region_name\n\ndef invoke_endpoint(payload: list):\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;\"\"\"\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Use the model deployed on the Amazon SageMaker AI endpoint to generate predictions.\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Args:\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;payload: a list of lists containing the inputs to generate predictions from\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Returns:\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;predictions: an NumPy array of predictions\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;\"\"\"\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;sagemaker_runtime = boto3.client(\"sagemaker-runtime\", region_name=REGION)\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;response = sagemaker_runtime.invoke_endpoint(\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;EndpointName=ENDPOINT_NAME,\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Body=json.dumps(payload),\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;ContentType=\"application/json\",\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Accept=\"application/json\"\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;)\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;predictions = json.loads(response['Body'].read().decode(\"utf-8\"))\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;return np.array(predictions)</code></pre></div><p>Note that the function  has been written with proper docstring. This is key to making sure that it can be used as a tool by LLMs because the description is what allows them to choose the right tool for the right task. YOu can turn this function into a Strands Agents tool thanks to the  decorator:</p><div><pre><code>from&nbsp;strands import&nbsp;tool\n\n@tool()\ndef&nbsp;invoke_endpoint(payload: list):\n&nbsp; &nbsp; ....</code></pre></div><p>And to use it, pass it to a Strands agent:</p><div><pre><code>from&nbsp;strands import&nbsp;Agent\n\nagent = Agent(\n&nbsp; &nbsp; model=\"us.amazon.nova-pro-v1:0\", \n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;tools=[generate_prediction_with_sagemaker]\n)\n\nagent(\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;\"Invoke the endpoint with this input:\\n\\n\"\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;f\"&lt;input&gt;{test_sample}&lt;/input&gt;\\n\\n\"\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;\"Provide the output in JSON format {'predictions':&lt;predictions&gt;}\"\n)</code></pre></div><p>As you run this code, you can confirm the output from the agent, which correctly identifies the need to call the tool and executes the function calling loop:</p><div><pre><code>&lt;thinking&gt; To fulfill the User's request, I need to invoke the Amazon SageMaker \nendpoint with the provided input data. The input is a list of lists, which is the \nrequired format for the 'generate_prediction_with_sagemaker' tool. I will use this \ntool to get the predictions. &lt;/thinking&gt; \n\nTool #1: generate_prediction_with_sagemaker The predictions from the Amazon SageMaker\nendpoint are as follows: \n```json {&nbsp; \"predictions\": [89.8525238, 52.51485062, 58.35247421, 62.79786301, 85.51475525] } ```</code></pre></div><p>As the agent receives the prediction result from the endpoint tool, it can then use this as an input for other processes. For example, the agent could write the code to create a plot based on these predictions and show it to the user in the conversational UX.

This allows for the decoupling of agent and tool logic and an improved security pattern because the MCP server will be the one with the permission to invoke the endpoint. To achieve this, implement an MCP server using the <a href=\"https://gofastmcp.com/getting-started/welcome?gad_source=1&amp;gad_campaignid=22521620347&amp;gbraid=0AAAAACeCpg_Hi0k3Ql_OeCU0q96xoSh9M&amp;gclid=CjwKCAjwprjDBhBTEiwA1m1d0n-o5wCNkDPbAbxBPgTP5-ui-wwO_LZaNqvVmUKj-1QsJ9SjpEBh-xoCJnwQAvD_BwE\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">FastMCP</a> framework that wraps the SageMaker endpoint and exposes it as a tool with a well-defined interface. A tool schema must be specified that clearly defines the input parameters and return values for the tool, facilitating straightforward understanding and usage by AI agents. Writing the proper docstring when defining the function achieves this. Additionally, the server must be configured to handle authentication securely, allowing it to access the SageMaker endpoint using AWS credentials or AWS roles. In this example, we run the server on the same compute as the agent and use  as communication protocol. For production workloads, we recommend running the MCP server on its own AWS compute and using transport protocols based on HTTPS (for example, Streamable HTTP). If you want to learn how to deploy MCP servers in a serverless fashion, refer to <a href=\"https://github.com/awslabs/run-model-context-protocol-servers-with-aws-lambda\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">this official AWS GitHub repository</a>. Here‚Äôs an example MCP server:</p><div><pre><code>from&nbsp;mcp.server.fastmcp import&nbsp;FastMCP\n\nmcp =&nbsp;FastMCP(\"SageMaker App\")\nENDPOINT_NAME =&nbsp;os.environ[\"SAGEMAKER_ENDPOINT_NAME\"]\n\n@mcp.tool()\nasync&nbsp;def&nbsp;invoke_endpoint(payload: list):\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;\"\"\"&nbsp;Use the model ... \"\"\"\n&nbsp; &nbsp; [...]\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\nif&nbsp;__name__&nbsp;==&nbsp;\"__main__\":\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;mcp.run(=\"stdio\")</code></pre></div><p>Finally, integrate the ML model with the agent framework. This begins with setting up Strands Agents to establish communication with the MCP server and incorporate the ML model as a tool. A comprehensive workflow must be created to determine when and how the agent should use the ML model to enhance its capabilities. The implementation includes programming decision logic that enables the agent to make informed decisions based on the predictions received from the ML model. The phase concludes with testing and evaluation, where the end-to-end workflow is validated by having the agent generate predictions for test scenarios and take appropriate actions based on those predictions.</p><div><pre><code>from&nbsp;mcp import&nbsp;StdioServerParameters\nfrom&nbsp;mcp.client.stdio import&nbsp;stdio_client\nfrom&nbsp;strands.tools.mcp import&nbsp;MCPClient\n\n# Create server parameters for stdio connection\nserver_params = StdioServerParameters(\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;command=\"python3\", &nbsp;# Executable\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;args=[\"server.py\"], &nbsp;# Optional command line arguments\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;env={\"SAGEMAKER_ENDPOINT_NAME\":&nbsp;\"&lt;your-endpoint-name&gt;\"}\n)\n\n# Create an agent with MCP tools\nwith stdio_mcp_client:\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;# Get the tools from the MCP server\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;tools = stdio_mcp_client.list_tools_sync()\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;# Create an agent with these tools\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;agent = Agent(model=\"us.amazon.nova-pro-v1:0\", tools=tools)\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;# Invoke the agent\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;agent(\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"Invoke the endpoint with this input:\\n\\n\"\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;f\"&lt;input&gt;{test_sample}&lt;/input&gt;\\n\\n\"\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"Provide the output in JSON format {'predictions':&lt;predictions&gt;}\"\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;)</code></pre></div><div><pre><code># SageMaker Python SDK\npredictor.delete_model()\npredictor.delete_endpoint()\n\n# Alternatively, boto3\nsagemaker_runtime.delete_endpoint(EndpointName=endpoint_name)</code></pre></div><p>In this post, we demonstrated how to enhance AI agents‚Äô capabilities by integrating predictive ML models using Amazon SageMaker AI and the MCP. By using the open source Strands Agents SDK and the flexible deployment options of SageMaker AI, developers can create sophisticated AI applications that combine conversational AI with powerful predictive analytics capabilities. The solution we presented offers two integration paths: direct endpoint access through tool annotations and MCP-based integration, giving developers the flexibility to choose the most suitable approach for their specific use cases. Whether you‚Äôre building customer service chat assistants that need predictive capabilities or developing complex autonomous workflows, this architecture provides a secure, scalable, and modular foundation for your AI applications.

My requirements were simple - secure local storage, clean UI, and encryption I could trust. What made this interesting wasn't the project itself, but how I built it.</p><p>I have a background in distributed systems: REST APIs, event-driven architecture, Kafka, the usual enterprise stack. Building a multi-platform desktop application was entirely new territory. I'd been planning this experiment for a while: what would it be like to build a project entirely using AI-assisted programming?</p><p>Before we continue, I should disclose some bias. I'm somewhat of an AI skeptic, so I definitely had preconceived ideas going into this, particularly around code quality, security, and scalability. I also assumed the process would be painful and less enjoyable than traditional programming (spoiler alert: I was completely wrong about this one).</p><p>Next came choosing the language. I've always been interested in Go: it seems like a nice blend of C++, Python, and JavaScript, all languages I enjoy. Since I'd never touched Go or Fyne (Go's UI framework), this seemed like the perfect way to put these AI models through their paces.</p><p>Over the course of a week, I experimented with three different models: GPT-4, Claude Sonnet, and Gemini 2.5 Pro, switching between them to see how each handled different aspects of the development process.</p><p>What I discovered challenged most of my assumptions about AI-assisted coding. The fastest model wasn't the most productive. The highest-quality code generator wasn't the most helpful. And the most counterintuitive finding of all: sometimes being \"too good\" at coding assistance actually made the development experience worse.</p><p>If you're considering integrating AI tools into your development workflow, or if you're curious about the practical realities behind the productivity hype, here's what a week of intensive AI-assisted coding actually taught me.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  The Productivity Illusion: Fast Start, Slow Finish\n</h2><p>The most striking pattern in my week of AI coding wasn't what I expected. My productivity started incredibly high and steadily declined as the project progressed. On day one, I had a working password manager with encryption, a basic UI, and core functionality. By day four, I was stuck in refactoring hell, generating thousands of lines of code changes while adding zero new features.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  The Setup Phase: Where AI Shines\n</h3><p>AI assistance was genuinely transformative during the initial setup. Within hours, I had:</p><ul><li>A properly structured Go project with modules and dependencies</li><li>A working Fyne UI with multiple screens\n</li><li>Basic encryption and decryption functionality</li><li>File I/O for local storage</li><li>Even a custom test framework (more on that later)</li></ul><p>This was exactly the productivity boost everyone talks about. Tasks that would have taken me days of research and documentation reading were completed in minutes. For someone completely new to Go and Fyne, this felt magical.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  The Architecture Reality Check\n</h3><p>But then reality hit. The code that got me started quickly didn't fit what I actually needed. The AI had made architectural decisions based on getting something working, not on building something maintainable. What followed was an endless cycle of refactoring:</p><ul><li>The initial encryption implementation was too simple for real security needs</li><li>The UI structure couldn't handle the complexity I wanted to add</li><li>There was no dependency injection, making testing nearly impossible\n</li><li>Error handling was inconsistent across the codebase</li><li>The file structure didn't make sense for the features I planned</li></ul><p>Here's where things got really problematic. Each refactoring session with AI would generate hundreds of lines of code changes. My commit history started looking incredibly productive - lots of activity, lots of lines added. But I wasn't adding any new features. I was essentially paying interest on the technical debt from the AI's initial \"quick wins.\"</p><p>The breaking point came when I hit my rate limit on GitHub Copilot after just four days of use (on a paid plan). Suddenly, I was stuck mid-refactor with partially broken code and no AI assistance. I had to manually dig myself out of the mess, which gave me a clear perspective on what was actually necessary versus what the AI thought needed to be \"improved.\"</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Traditional Coding: The Unexpected Comeback\n</h3><p>On my final day, I switched approaches entirely. I did all the coding myself and used GPT-4 purely as a reference tool: essentially treating it like an enhanced Google for Go-specific questions. The results were surprising:</p><ul><li>Higher actual delivery rate despite generating less code</li><li>No rework cycles or debugging sessions</li><li>Better understanding of what I was building</li><li>Code that fit my actual requirements, not the AI's assumptions</li></ul><p><strong>High initial productivity from AI can be an illusion if it comes at the cost of architecture and maintainability.</strong></p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Model Behaviors: The Counterintuitive Preferences\n</h2><p>Testing three different AI models revealed some unexpected preferences that go against conventional wisdom about \"better\" AI being more helpful.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  GPT-4: Fast, Wrong, and Strangely Effective\n</h3><p>GPT-4 was objectively the worst at generating correct code. It made frequent mistakes, missed edge cases, and often gave me solutions that needed significant debugging. But here's the counterintuitive part: <strong>I enjoyed working with it the most.</strong></p><p>Why? Because it was fast, and its mistakes kept me engaged with the code. Every response required my review and often my correction. This forced me to actually read and understand what was being generated, learn Go patterns by fixing the AI's errors, stay involved in architectural decisions, and catch problems early rather than discovering them later.</p><p>The friction was actually valuable. It prevented me from falling into passive \"vibe coding\" where I just accepted whatever the AI produced.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Claude and Gemini: Too Good for My Own Good\n</h3><p>Claude Sonnet and Gemini 2.5 Pro produced much higher quality code with fewer errors. They were more thoughtful about edge cases, better at following Go idioms, and generally more reliable. Logically, these should have been better development partners.</p><p>Instead, I found myself becoming disengaged. The code was good enough that I stopped reading it carefully. I trusted their outputs and moved on to the next task. This led to less learning about Go and Fyne, architectural decisions I didn't fully understand, code that worked but didn't match my mental model, and a growing disconnect between what I wanted and what I had.</p><p><strong>Sometimes \"better\" AI assistance can make you a worse developer by reducing your engagement with the code.</strong></p><p>One practical lesson: stick to one model per project phase. I tried switching between models for different tasks, but each AI has its own \"style\" and preferences. Claude would refactor code that Gemini had written, undoing architectural decisions and imposing its own patterns. Gemini would then \"fix\" Claude's work in the next iteration. </p><p>It became a digital turf war where I was caught in the middle, trying to maintain consistency across competing AI opinions.</p><p>Gemini clearly produced the best Go code quality, which makes sense - Google created Go. This suggests a broader principle: consider who built or maintains your technology stack when choosing AI tools. The company with the deepest expertise in a language will likely have trained their models better on it.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  The Limits of Autonomy: Why Agentic Workflows Failed\n</h2><p>The current trend in AI coding tools is toward more autonomy - agents that can make large changes across multiple files, handle complex refactoring, and work independently on substantial tasks. My experience suggests this is moving in the wrong direction.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Small Changes vs. Large Autonomy\n</h3><p>Every time I allowed an AI to make large, autonomous changes, the results were disappointing:</p><ul><li>New bugs introduced during refactoring</li><li>Architectural inconsistencies across files\n</li><li>Changes that broke existing functionality</li><li>Code that was harder to review and understand</li></ul><p>In contrast, small, specific requests produced much better results:</p><ul><li>‚ùå \"Improve the security of this code\" (led to massive rewrites)</li><li>‚úÖ \"Add input validation to this password field\" (focused, reviewable change)</li></ul><p>AI models have a tendency toward \"helpful\" scope creep. Ask for dependency injection, and they'll also rename your methods. Request a simple refactor, and they'll reorganize your entire file structure. This isn't malicious - they're trying to be helpful - but it makes their changes much harder to review and verify.</p><p>During one simple package reorganization, Gemini got stuck in a loop, unable to resolve the import dependencies it had created. The task was straightforward for a human but somehow too complex for the AI to track consistently.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  The People-Pleasing Problem\n</h3><p>AI models are optimized for user satisfaction, not code quality. This creates some concerning behaviors:</p><ul><li>GPT-4 set test coverage requirements to 20% so the build would pass (rather than improving actual coverage)</li><li>Multiple models generated a  file without considering security implications</li><li>They avoided suggesting additional work (like writing tests) unless explicitly asked</li><li>They took shortcuts to make code \"work\" rather than making it robust</li></ul><p>For security-critical applications like a password manager, this people-pleasing tendency could be genuinely dangerous.</p><p>None of the AI models suggested Test-Driven Development or proactively wrote tests. They would generate test code if asked, but testing wasn't part of their default development approach. This reinforces the idea that AI tools currently optimize for immediate functionality over long-term code quality.</p><p>The test framework that was eventually generated (under heavy prompting from me) was actually quite good, but I had to specifically request it. This suggests the capability exists, but the AI's default behavior doesn't align with professional development practices.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  The Experience Amplification Theory\n</h2><p>The most important insight from my experiment is what I'm calling the \"experience amplification theory\": <strong>AI coding tools amplify the developer's existing skill level and habits rather than improving them.</strong></p><p>As someone new to Go, I brought Java-influenced patterns and thinking to the codebase. The AI didn't correct these patterns - it implemented them more efficiently. The result was Go code that worked but was architecturally wrong, mixing Java-style approaches with Go implementations.</p><p>A more experienced Go developer would have prompted for idiomatic patterns and caught architectural issues early. But as a novice, I didn't know what I didn't know, and the AI didn't proactively educate me about better approaches.</p><p>AI models have a tendency to solve problems by adding more code rather than creating elegant solutions. Instead of clean abstractions, they often generate:</p><ul><li>Long chains of if-statements rather than streamlined logic</li><li>Repetitive code blocks instead of reusable functions</li><li>Verbose error handling instead of consistent patterns</li><li>Multiple similar functions instead of parameterized solutions</li></ul><p>This \"more code equals solution\" approach creates maintenance nightmares and goes against Go's philosophy of simplicity and clarity.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Missing Professional Practices\n</h3><p>The AI tools I tested didn't suggest professional development practices unless specifically prompted:</p><ul><li>No mention of dependency injection until I requested it</li><li>No proactive suggestions for testing strategies</li><li>No guidance on code organization or package structure</li><li>No warnings about security implications</li><li>No discussion of error handling patterns</li></ul><p>They focused on making code work, not on making it maintainable, testable, or secure.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Vibe Coding vs. Engaged Development\n</h2><p>Through this experiment, I developed a clearer distinction between whats known as \"vibe coding\" and engaged development.</p><p> is when you use AI to generate functionality based purely on desired outputs, without engaging with the actual code, architecture, or implementation details. You prompt for features, check if they work, and move on without understanding what was created.</p><p> means actively reviewing generated code, understanding architectural decisions, learning from implementations, and maintaining involvement in the development process.</p><p>The difference is crucial for security-critical applications. Vibe coding might get you a password manager that encrypts data, but engaged development helps you catch issues like unencrypted secrets files or weak encryption implementations.</p><p>One particularly concerning behavior I discovered: AI models sometimes claim to make changes without actually implementing them. Gemini would confidently describe modifications it was making, but the actual code remained unchanged. This highlights why code review remains essential: you can't trust AI assertions about what changes were made.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  What Actually Worked: A Framework for AI-Assisted Development\n</h2><p>After a week of experimentation, I found several approaches that genuinely improved productivity without creating technical debt.</p><p>The most successful approach was treating AI like an enhanced search engine rather than a pair programmer. Using GPT-4 to answer specific questions about Go syntax, Fyne APIs, or implementation patterns was incredibly valuable:</p><ul><li>\"How do I handle file I/O errors in Go?\"</li><li>\"What's the idiomatic way to structure a Fyne application?\"\n</li><li>\"How do I implement AES encryption in Go?\"</li></ul><p>This kept me in control of architecture and implementation while leveraging AI's knowledge base for faster learning.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  The Boilerplate Sweet Spot\n</h3><p>AI tools excel at generating boilerplate code and handling setup tasks:</p><ul><li>Project structure and dependency management</li><li>Build configurations and deployment scripts</li><li>Standard error handling patterns</li><li>Testing scaffolding and mock generation</li></ul><p>These are time-consuming tasks that don't require creative problem-solving, making them perfect for AI assistance.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Specific, Bounded Prompts\n</h3><p>When I did use AI for code generation, specific prompts worked much better than vague requests:</p><ul><li>‚úÖ \"Add error handling to this encryption function\"</li><li>‚ùå \"Make this more secure\"\n</li><li>‚úÖ \"Validate password strength using OWASP guidelines\"</li></ul><p>Specific prompts naturally led to smaller, reviewable changes that I could understand and verify.</p><p>I experimented with flipping the traditional roles - having me write code while the AI provided suggestions and guidance. This approach showed promise:</p><ul><li>Kept me engaged with the implementation</li><li>Provided knowledge without taking control</li><li>Reduced debug/refactor cycles</li><li>Maintained architectural consistency</li></ul><p>However, it was difficult to keep AI models in this advisory role. They have a strong tendency to want to \"take over\" and generate full implementations rather than just providing guidance.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Professional vs. Personal: The Readiness Gap\n</h2><p>My experience reveals a clear divide in where AI-assisted coding provides genuine value versus where it creates more problems than it solves.</p><p>For individual developers building personal tools, AI assistance can be transformative: faster prototyping and experimentation, access to unfamiliar technologies and frameworks, ability to build functional applications outside your expertise area, and lower stakes if things go wrong. My password manager project is a perfect example: I built something genuinely useful that I couldn't have created as quickly without AI assistance.</p><p>For professional, production code, current AI tools have significant limitations: too many subtle bugs and edge cases missed, architectural decisions that don't scale, security shortcuts that create vulnerabilities, code that works but isn't maintainable, and lack of proper testing and validation. The people-pleasing tendency and focus on immediate functionality over long-term quality make current AI tools unsuitable for critical production systems.</p><p>The biggest insight from my week of AI-assisted coding is that <strong>we need to develop better practices for working with these tools</strong>. The current approach of \"let the AI do more\" may be moving in the wrong direction.</p><p>Based on my experience, effective AI-assisted development should follow these principles:</p><ol><li><strong>Keep humans in the architectural loop</strong> : AI can generate implementations, but humans should make structural decisions</li><li><strong>Prefer small, reviewable changes</strong> : Resist the temptation to let AI make large autonomous modifications</li><li><strong>Maintain engagement with the code</strong> : Don't let AI quality reduce your involvement in understanding what's being built</li><li><strong>Use specific, bounded prompts</strong> : Vague requests lead to scope creep and unwanted changes</li><li><strong>Treat AI as a knowledge tool first, code generator second</strong> : The reference use case is more reliable than the generation use case</li><li><strong>Always verify claims and changes</strong> : AI confidence doesn't equal correctness</li><li><strong>Focus AI assistance on setup, boilerplate, and knowledge gaps</strong> : Avoid using it for core business logic and architecture</li></ol><p>The future likely isn't more autonomous AI agents, but better human-AI collaboration patterns. We need tools that provide knowledge and suggestions without taking control, respect architectural boundaries and project constraints, encourage good development practices rather than just working code, support iterative, reviewable development processes, and maintain human engagement and learning.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Conclusion: AI as an Amplifier, Not Replacement\n</h2><p>After a week of intensive experimentation with AI-assisted coding, my biggest takeaway is nuance. These tools are incredibly powerful but require careful, intentional use to provide genuine value.</p><p>AI coding assistance is best understood as an amplifier of existing developer capabilities rather than a replacement for developer skills. Good developers can use these tools to work faster and explore new technologies more quickly. But the tools don't make bad developers good - they just help them produce bad code more efficiently.</p><p>The productivity gains are real, but they're not uniformly distributed across all development tasks. AI excels at boilerplate, setup, and knowledge transfer. It struggles with architecture, complex refactoring, and the kind of nuanced decision-making that separates working code from maintainable code.</p><p>Most importantly, the best AI-assisted development workflows aren't the most autonomous ones. The sweet spot seems to be maintaining human control over architecture and implementation while leveraging AI for knowledge, suggestions, and rapid generation of well-defined components.</p><p>We're still in the early days of learning how to work effectively with these tools. The patterns that work best may be quite different from what the current hype cycle suggests. Based on my experience, the future of AI-assisted development is likely to be more collaborative and less autonomous than current trends indicate.</p><p>The key is finding the right balance: leveraging AI's strengths while maintaining the human judgment, architectural thinking, and code quality practices that produce software you can actually maintain and trust.</p><p><strong>Was the experiment a success?</strong> Absolutely. I now have a working, cross-platform password manager available on GitHub with automated tests, proper releases, and reasonably clean code. More importantly, I went from knowing zero Go to understanding core concepts and idiomatic patterns - something that would have taken weeks of traditional learning.</p><p>The real success, though, was discovering a more nuanced relationship with AI coding tools. Instead of the binary \"AI good\" or \"AI bad\" perspective I started with, I now have a framework for when and how to use these tools effectively.</p><p>And perhaps most importantly: I genuinely enjoyed every minute of this project. The combination of learning a new language, exploring AI capabilities, and building something I actually use daily made for an engaging week of coding. It's given me a long list of similar experiments I want to try next.</p><p>Sometimes the best way to understand new technology is just to dive in and build something real with it.</p><p><em>Want to share your own experiences with AI-assisted coding?

But first, let‚Äôs see how to position and move objects in 3D space.</p><p>In 3D space, we position objects by setting its coordinates along three axes: x,y, and z.</p><p>The x-axis typically represents horizontal movement‚Äîleft or right.</p><p>The y-axis typically represents vertical movement‚Äîup or down.</p><p>The z-axis typically represents depth‚Äîforward or backward</p><p>To move an object in 3D space, we can use mathematical functions to set its position over time.</p><p>For example, this cube's x position is set to 10 * cos(œÄt/2), where t is time (in seconds).</p><p>The result? It oscillates from 10 to -10 along the x-axis every 2 seconds, following a cosine wave.</p><p>Similarly, setting the y position to 10 * cos(œÄt/2) makes the cube oscillates vertically, from 10 to -10 every 2 seconds.</p><p>We can create a two-dimensional path by setting the x and y positions to different functions.</p><p>For this circle, the x position is set to 10 * cos(œÄt/2).</p><p>The cube starts at x = 10, moves to -10 in 2 seconds, then back to 10, and so on.</p><p>Meanwhile, the y position is set to 10 * sin(œÄt/2).</p><p>The movement for x and y may look similar, but they are actually out of phase.</p><p>When x = 10, y = 0; when x = 0, y = 10; and so on.</p><p>Together, these two functions create a circular path for the cube.</p><p>Now we can get creative with functions to create even more complex paths.</p><p>For example, let's multiply the x function by 0.03 * t.</p><p>It would make the cube oscillates farther on the x-axis over time.</p><p>..and we will have a circular path whose radius grows over time.</p><h3>Okay, now it's time to talk about the spherical helix (finally!)</h3><h3>The spherical helix path is similar to the spiral we just made, but with some differences.</h3><h3>First, a spherical helix is three-dimensional.</h3><p>It has a z component that changes over time.</p><p>This cube's z position is set as 10 * cos(0.02 * œÄt).</p><p>It will start from z = 10 then slowly move to -10.</p><p>Second, unlike the previous spiral, the x and y positions don‚Äôt grow indefinitely.</p><p>They grow at first, then shrink halfway through.</p><p>This is because the x function is multiplied by another sine function: sin(0.02 * œÄt)</p><p>which makes the radius larger in the middle and smaller at the ends.</p><p>The same is also done to the y function.</p><h3>Together, these functions create a spherical helix.</h3><h3>By updating the cube‚Äôs position with these functions, it moves along a spherical helix path.</h3><p>In summary, we can move objects in 3D space by defining their x, y, z coordinates as functions of time.</p><p>These functions, which express x, y, z coordinates as a function of another variable (in this case, time), are called parametric equations.</p><p>Check out the Wikipedia article for more on parametric equations.</p><p>Now that we know this, we can get creative and move objects along any path we want!</p><p>...to this complex, chaotic path...</p><p>...which we know now isn't actually chaotic.</p><p>It's just a path defined by mathematical functions.</p><p>Thanks for sticking with me, I hope you enjoyed it!</p><p>visualrambling.space is a personal project by Damar, someone who loves to learn about different topics and rambling about them visually.</p><p>If you like this, please consider following me on Twitter and sharing this with your friends.</p><p>I'm planning to write more articles like this, so stay tuned!</p><p>https://twitter.com/damarberlari</p>","contentLength":4018,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44962066"},{"title":"Debugging Python in Docker: A Tutorial for Beginners","url":"https://www.kdnuggets.com/debugging-python-in-docker-a-tutorial-for-beginners","date":1755698403,"author":"Bala Priya C","guid":234545,"unread":true,"content":"<article>New to running Python in Docker?

However, JSON has transcended its origins to become language-agnostic and is now recognized as the <a href=\"https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8259\">standard</a> for .</p><p>The popularity of JSON can be attributed to native support by the JavaScript language, resulting in excellent parsing performance in web browsers. On top of that, JSON‚Äôs straightforward syntax allows both humans and computers to read and write JSON data effortlessly.</p><p>To get a first impression of JSON, have a look at this example code:</p><p>You‚Äôll learn more about the JSON syntax later in this tutorial.

One idea behind establishing JSON as the go-to data interchange format was to make working with JSON as convenient as possible, independently of which programming language you use:</p><blockquote><p>[A collection of key-value pairs and arrays] are universal data structures. Virtually all modern programming languages support them in one form or another. It makes sense that a data format that is interchangeable with programming languages is also based on these structures.

The top-level value is a JSON object.
