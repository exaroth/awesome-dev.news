One of the key challenges in modern agriculture is the accurate classification of agricultural products, which directly impacts quality control, pricing, and supply chain management. Traditional methods of classification often rely on manual inspection, which can be time-consuming and prone to errors.</p><p>With the rise of data-driven technologies, Machine Learning (ML) offers a powerful alternative to automate and enhance agricultural product classification. By analyzing dimensional and shape factors, ML algorithms can accurately classify various agricultural products, reducing manual labor and increasing efficiency. This project explores how machine learning techniques can be applied to classify agricultural products using real-world data, leading to smarter agricultural practices and better decision-making.</p><p>üìä Project Overview\nThis project focuses on classifying agricultural products based on dimensional and shape factors using machine learning.

No entanto, dependendo do contexto, o uso de regex pode ser menos eficiente do que alternativas mais simples. Em sistemas de alta performance, como os que lidam com grandes volumes de dados ou que precisam ser executados em ambientes com recursos limitados, √© importante considerar o impacto de cada escolha de implementa√ß√£o.</p><p>Embora regex seja uma ferramenta poderosa, sua utiliza√ß√£o indiscriminada pode resultar em impactos de performance, principalmente em Go, onde cada opera√ß√£o √© otimizada ao m√°ximo para garantir alta efici√™ncia. Neste post, vamos abordar um exemplo simples de valida√ß√£o de strings alfanum√©ricas, comparando o uso de regex com uma abordagem baseada em Unicode e explicando como otimizar o uso de regex no Go para obter melhores resultados.</p><p>O que acontece por tr√°s das cortinas: Regex vs Unicode\nA biblioteca  √© bastante √∫til, mas pode ser mais lenta do que valida√ß√µes feitas manualmente usando fun√ß√µes da biblioteca unicode. Isso ocorre porque o Go precisa compilar o regex e avaliar sua express√£o toda vez que √© usado dentro de um m√©todo. Isso consome mais tempo de CPU e mem√≥ria, especialmente em valida√ß√µes simples, como a checagem, se uma string cont√©m apenas caracteres alfanum√©ricos.</p><p>A alternativa, mais eficiente, √© iterar sobre a string e validar cada caractere individualmente, utilizando fun√ß√µes como unicode.IsLetter e unicode.IsDigit. Isso evita a sobrecarga de compilar o regex toda vez que a fun√ß√£o √© chamada e pode ser muito mais r√°pido para cen√°rios simples.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Exemplo pr√°tico: Comparando as abordagens\n</h2><p>Aqui est√° um exemplo em Go para comparar as duas abordagens: uma usando regex e outra utilizando Unicode diretamente.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><h3>\n  \n  \n  Implementa√ß√£o usando Unicode:\n</h3><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><h2>\n  \n  \n  Compara√ß√£o de Performance\n</h2><p>Vamos rodar alguns benchmarks para comparar a performance das duas abordagens.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Como voc√™ pode observar nos benchmarks acima, a vers√£o que usa Unicode √© significativamente mais r√°pida do que a vers√£o com regex. A vers√£o com Unicode realiza cerca de 18 milh√µes de opera√ß√µes por segundo, enquanto a vers√£o com regex realiza apenas cerca de 3 milh√µes.</p><p>Quando usamos regex, estamos criando e compilando uma express√£o regular toda vez que chamamos a fun√ß√£o. O processo de compila√ß√£o e execu√ß√£o da express√£o regular envolve mais passos do que simplesmente iterar sobre os caracteres da string com fun√ß√µes do unicode. Isso faz com que a execu√ß√£o com regex consuma mais tempo de CPU e mem√≥ria.</p><p>Isso n√£o significa que voc√™ deve parar de usar regex. Em casos mais complexos, onde voc√™ precisa de valida√ß√µes mais sofisticadas, regex pode ser a melhor escolha. No entanto, em valida√ß√µes simples, como a checagem de caracteres alfanum√©ricos, o uso de Unicode diretamente √© muito mais eficiente.</p><p>Dica de Performance: Compile Regex fora do m√©todo\nSe voc√™ optar por usar regex, uma boa pr√°tica √© compilar a express√£o regular fora do m√©todo, para que ela n√£o precise ser recompilada a cada chamada.

Once you have the token, you can save it as an environment variable in a  file (You might need to install  to use it).</p><p>We'll start small.

It would be really nice if our dashboard could display this sequential flow instead of showing both the calls as separate (like we saw before). We can do this using tracing. </p><p>For tracing to work, context has to be propagated across services. This \"context\" helps keep track of the parent trace/span of a new span/log so that they can be viewed in tandem.  Thankfully logfire gives us an easy way to do this. Since we're using  to use the  service, we'll install the associated library from logfire.</p><div><pre><code>pip </code></pre></div><p>We'll update the code in  to add <code>logfire.instrument_requests()</code></p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>We don't need to update  (the shipping one) because we aren't sending any requests in that server for now.</p><p> will make sure that the traceparent header is automatically set when making requests.  makes sure that the  header is extracted correctly from incoming requests.

But we won't sit and configure our routers every time, we need a better solution.</p><p>But if we're not forwarding the port, then how can an external packet enter our private network without getting chocked by firewalls? </p><p>Here's where the concept of <a href=\"https://qbee.io/misc/reverse-ssh-tunneling-the-ultimate-guide/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Reverse Tunneling</a> comes into the picture. Reverse Tunneling is a technique used to establish a secure connection from a remote server back to a local machine. Portsicle beautifully manipulates this same technique to route traffic to local machine.</p><p>The idea is to have an intermediary remote (relay) server which will act as a bridge between local machine and the internet traffic. Anyone who wants to access someone's local server, will first visit to the remote server, which will then route the request to the local machine.</p><p>To achieve this, Portsicle provides a client CLI which connects to the remote server. The user can use the CLI command to initiate the tunnel. This means that the connection is now outbound (established by the local machine) and the firewall will just ignore it. This connection is then upgraded to a secure and persistent websocket tunnel.</p><p>Once a tunnel is established, the relay server provides a 'Public URL' for that session. Anyone on the internet can now access that particular local server with this public URL and the URL is only valid as long as the client is running along.</p><p>Steps to get the public url:</p><blockquote><p>note that 3000 has to be the port of the local server you wanted to expose.</p></blockquote><ul><li>You'll then receive the URL:\n</li></ul><div><pre><code>‚ùØ ./portsicle http -p 3000\n2025/02/23 00:26:33 Connected to remote server.\n2025/02/23 00:26:33 Your public url: https://portsicle.koyeb.app/a355bf62-f7c4-46e9-9d9b-1125d6343b3d\n</code></pre></div><p>Your local server is accessible with this link!</p><p>But how the traffic is \"forwarded\"??? Well, we simply convert the HTTP/HTTPS requests and responses into websocket messages and forward them between local client and the remote server.</p><p>We handle this forwarding for two cycles:</p><p>Take plain HTTP request =&gt; Convert it to a message object =&gt; send it across wire =&gt; reconstruct an HTTP request =&gt; send it to local server. </p><p>Client gets a response from local server =&gt; convert it to a response object =&gt; send it across wire =&gt; construct a response.  </p>","contentLength":2538,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Estudos em Python - Objeto iter√°vel","url":"https://dev.to/douglasamarelo/estudos-em-python-objeto-iteravel-4a98","date":1740250549,"author":"Douglas \"Amarelo\" Lopes","guid":9267,"unread":true,"content":"<h2>\n  \n  \n  1.

For newcomers, Dynamic Programming is a method for solving complex problems by breaking them down into simpler subproblems.</p><p>Let's see how the dynamic programming concept applies to Dynamic Data Tables, which is the solution we're trying to achieve in this article. </p><p>Data Tables represent a structured way of organizing and displaying data in rows and columns with built-in functionality for managing large datasets. Think of it as an enhanced table that provides:</p><ul><li>Breaking down large datasets into smaller, manageable pages</li><li>Allows users to navigate through data without loading everything at once</li><li>Typically shows X records per page (e.g., 10, 25, 50 entries)</li></ul><ul><li>Rows represent individual records</li><li>Columns represent attributes or fields</li><li>Headers define the structure and can enable sorting</li></ul><ul><li>Suitable for small datasets</li><li>All records are pulled once on the client side</li><li>Data is processed locally in the browser or phone application</li></ul><ul><li>Database queries fetch only the required records</li><li>Reduces memory usage and improves performance</li><li>Handles large datasets efficiently</li></ul><p>The goal of our research is to provide the above features out of the box using a minimal configuration and only the dynamic features of Python that can detect and manipulate data at runtime. Let's break down the task into smaller pieces and start applying the dynamic programming principles to our specific use case. </p><p>Users should be able to activate the dynamic pattern for any model using a simple and intuitive syntax. For this, we can use a map that uses the URL as the key, and the target model as value.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>The above definition will use the routing \"products\" to build the dynamic table for the Product Model defined in the apps/models.py</p><p>The path for the model is now used to load the model class and analyze the fields and the type. </p><p>The model can be analyzed using the  and  helpers as showcased below:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>If we call the  with the  input, we should get the  returned by the  helper.</p><p>Having the class is the first step. Next is to get all fields, the associated types, and also all the foreign keys mapped to external types we don't know yet.   </p><p>The ordinary fields can be pulled from the class definition using this code:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>The above snippet will return all fields defined using ordinary types like Integer, String, DateTime, and Text. </p><p>For the Foreign key discovery, the code needs to use the model metadata that saves the distant relationships with other Models. The code that provides all associated FKs is the one below:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>After solving the FKs case, the next challenge is to detect the ENUMS used by the model for mapping the information into combos. Without this detection, the ENUMS will be mapped to input fields and we might have issues during creation or update.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>The above code snippet iterates on the model fields and saves all values for each field detected as ENUM. </p><p>At this point, we've achieved the following:</p><ul><li>The model is automatically discovered using the URI segment and the configuration mapping</li><li>Fields information (name and type) covers all cases: simple types, ENUMS, foreign keys</li><li>The information is injected into the Jinja files to be presented to the user</li></ul><p>The page provided by the dynamic data table provides the usual controls like search, show hide columns control, filters and export in CSV format.</p><p>The item creation page is displayed with as below:</p><p>For more inputs regarding the concept feel free to contact the team in support or simply download and inspect the code in your local system:</p>","contentLength":3604,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"COMMON MANUAL TESTING TECHNIQUES","url":"https://dev.to/saikiran_r_63247e3b241a8e/common-manual-testing-techniques-1ngh","date":1740240275,"author":"SAIKIRAN R","guid":9212,"unread":true,"content":"<p>Hi everyone we will look at the common manual testing techniques</p><p>The client will approach the service provider with some requirements and a plan.

Once a step is completed, it triggers the next step in the sequence. If any step fails, the saga executes compensating updates to undo the changes made by the previous steps, ensuring that the system returns to its initial state.</p><p>There are two main approaches to implementing the Saga Pattern: Orchestration and Choreography.</p><p>In this approach, a central orchestrator service coordinates the saga steps. The orchestrator tells each service when to execute its local transaction. It maintains the state of the saga and handles any failures by invoking compensating transactions. The orchestrator knows the entire saga flow.</p><p>The client initiates the saga by communicating with the orchestrator. The orchestrator then invokes the first service. Upon successful completion, the orchestrator moves to the next step, invoking the corresponding service. If a service fails, the orchestrator triggers compensating transactions in reverse order.</p><p>In the Choreography approach, there is no central coordinator. Instead, each service involved in the saga knows its role and communicates with the other services through events or messages. Each service listens for specific events and performs local transactions when the appropriate event is received. The saga flow is distributed across the services.</p><p>The client initiates the saga by communicating with the first service. This service performs its transaction and publishes an event. Other services, listening for this event, perform their respective transactions and publish their events. This chain reaction continues until the saga is complete. If a service fails, it publishes a compensating event, triggering other services to execute compensating transactions.</p><ul><li><p>Choreography has no single point of failure, as each service manages its part of the saga.</p></li><li><p>Orchestration provides simplified error handling and monitoring with centralized control. In contrast, each service needs to handle its errors in Choreography, which can lead to complex error-handling logic.</p></li><li><p>In Orchestration, the coordinator needs to know about all the services involved in the saga, which can lead to tight coupling. In contrast, in Choreography, services need to agree on the events and the order of transactions, which can lead to overhead in coordination.</p></li></ul><ul></ul><ul></ul><p><em>If you enjoyed this article, please hit the ‚ù§Ô∏è like button.</em></p><p><em>If you think someone else will benefit from this, then please üîÅ share this post.</em></p>","contentLength":2718,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/1ivk7x9/what_is_saga_pattern_in_distributed_systems/"},{"title":"[R] Calculating costs of fine tuning an Vision Language Model","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1ivjrwi/r_calculating_costs_of_fine_tuning_an_vision/","date":1740234081,"author":"/u/thekarthikprasad","guid":9235,"unread":true,"content":"<p>Hello guys, I need help in calculating the cost of fine-tuning a VL model.<p> My image dataset is of size 80+gb (</p><a href=\"https://huggingface.co/datasets/RussRobin/SpatialQA\">https://huggingface.co/datasets/RussRobin/SpatialQA</a>) The VL model is InternVL's 2B model<p> I am confused about whether to do a full parameter/QLoRA Finetuning.</p> I can't spend more on this, but wish to check the results.</p><p>If so I could, what would be the cost estimate, also how to estimate cost in general Can I sample the dataset, if it breaks my cost bound and still see the results?<p> Also do suggest the best and cheapest compute platform for my case.</p> Thanks in advance.</p>","contentLength":577,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Show HN: I Built a Visual Workflow Automation Platform ‚Äì FlowRipple","url":"https://flowripple.com/","date":1740234004,"author":"shivsarthak34","guid":9228,"unread":true,"content":"<p data-svelte-h=\"svelte-kr32c4\">Watch how easy it is to build powerful automation workflows using our visual builder.

It is a tool library provided by Google with an efficient protocol data exchange format, possessing the characteristics of flexible, efficient, and automated structured data serialization mechanisms.</p><p>Compared with XML, the size of data encoded by Protobuf is smaller, and the encoding and decoding speed is faster. Compared with Json, Protobuf performs more excellently in conversion efficiency, with both its time efficiency and space efficiency reaching 3 to 5 times that of JSON.</p><p>As the official description states: ‚ÄúProtocol buffers are Google's language-neutral, platform-neutral, extensible mechanism for serializing structured data ‚Äì think XML, but smaller, faster, and simpler. You define how you want your data to be structured once, then you can use special generated source code to easily write and read your structured data to and from a variety of data streams and using a variety of languages.‚Äù</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Comparison of Data Formats\n</h2><p>Suppose we have a  object, represented by JSON, XML, and Protobuf respectively, and let's see their differences.</p><div><pre><code>John24</code></pre></div><p>Protobuf directly represents data in binary format, which is not as intuitive as XML and JSON formats. For example:</p><div><pre><code>[10 6 69 108 108 122 111 116 16 24]\n</code></pre></div><h3>\n  \n  \n  Good Performance/High Efficiency\n</h3><ul><li>: The overhead of XML formatting (serialization) is acceptable, but the overhead of XML parsing (deserialization) is relatively large. Protobuf has optimized this aspect and can significantly reduce the time overhead of serialization and deserialization.</li><li>: Protobuf also greatly reduces the space occupation.</li></ul><h3>\n  \n  \n  Code Generation Mechanism\n</h3><p>For example, write the following content similar to a structure:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Protobuf can automatically generate the corresponding  file and  file, and encapsulate the operations on the structure  into a class.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Support for Backward Compatibility and Forward Compatibility\n</h3><p>When the client and the server use a protocol simultaneously, if the client adds a byte in the protocol, it will not affect the normal use of the client.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Support for Multiple Programming Languages\n</h3><p>In the source code officially released by Google, it includes support for multiple programming languages, such as:</p><ul></ul><h2>\n  \n  \n  Disadvantages of Protobuf\n</h2><h3>\n  \n  \n  Poor Readability Due to Binary Format\n</h3><p>To improve performance, Protobuf uses a binary format for encoding, which makes the data less readable and will affect the efficiency during the development and testing phase. However, under normal circumstances, Protobuf performs very reliably, and serious problems generally do not occur.</p><p>Generally, XML is self-descriptive, while the Protobuf format is not. It is a piece of binary format protocol content, and it is difficult to know its function without matching it with a pre-written structure.</p><p>Although Protobuf supports serialization and deserialization in multiple languages, it is not a universal transmission standard across platforms and languages. In scenarios of multi-platform message passing, its compatibility with other projects is not good, and corresponding adaptation and transformation work is often required. Compared with json and XML, its universality is slightly insufficient.</p><p>Proto message type files generally end with . In a  file, one or more message types can be defined.</p><p>The following is an example of defining a message type for a search query. The  at the beginning of the file is used to describe the version information. Currently, there are two versions of proto, proto2 and proto3.</p><p>Explicitly set the syntax format to proto3. If the  is not set, it defaults to proto2.  represents the content to be queried,  represents the page number of the query, and  represents the number of items per page.  must be located on the first line of the  file excluding comments and blank lines.</p><p>The following message contains 3 fields (, , ), and each field has a corresponding type, field name, and field number. The field type can be , , , or a composite type.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Each field in the message type needs to be defined with a unique number, and this number is used to identify the field in the binary data. Numbers in the range of [1,15] can be encoded and represented with one byte; in the range of [16,2047], they need to be encoded and represented with two bytes. Therefore, leaving the numbers within 15 for frequently occurring fields can save space. The minimum value of the number is 1, and the maximum value is 2^29 - 1 = 536870911. Numbers in the range of [19000, 19999] cannot be used because these numbers are used internally by the proto compiler. Similarly, other pre-reserved numbers cannot be used either.</p><p>Each field can be modified by  or . In the proto3 syntax, if the modification type is not specified, the default value is .</p><ul><li>: It means that the modified field appears at most once, that is, it appears 0 or 1 time.</li><li>: It means that the modified field can appear any number of times, including 0 times. In the proto3 syntax, fields modified by  use the  encoding by default.</li></ul><p>You can add comments to the  file. The comment syntax is the same as the C/C++ style, using  or .</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>When deleting or commenting out a field in a , other developers in the future may reuse the previous field number when updating the  definition. If they accidentally load the old version of the  file, it may lead to serious problems, such as data corruption. To avoid such problems, you can specify the reserved field numbers and field names. If someone uses these field numbers in the future, an error will be generated when compiling the proto, thus reminding that there is a problem with the proto.</p><p>Note: Do not mix the use of field names and field numbers for the same field.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><h3>\n  \n  \n  Mapping between Field Types and Language Types\n</h3><p>The defined  file can generate Go language code through a generator. For example, the Go file generated from the  file is the  file.</p><p>The mapping between basic types in proto and Go language types is shown in the following table (here only the type mapping between Go and C/C++ is listed, and for other languages, refer to <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/proto3):\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/proto3):</a>\n|.proto Type | Go Type | C++ Type |\n| double | float64 | double |<p>\n| float | float32 | float |</p>\n| int32 | int32 | int32 |<p>\n| int64 | int64 | int64 |</p>\n| uint32 | uint32 | uint32 |<p>\n| uint64 | uint64 | uint64 |</p>\n| sint32 | int32 | int32 |<p>\n| sint64 | int64 | int64 |</p>\n| fixed32 | uint32 | uint32 |<p>\n| fixed64 | uint64 | uint64 |</p>\n| sfixed32 | int32 | int32 |<p>\n| sfixed64 | int64 | int64 |</p>\n| bool | bool | bool |<p>\n| string | string | string |</p>\n| bytes | []byte | string |</p><div><table><tbody><tr></tr></tbody></table></div><p>When defining a message, if you want the value of a field to be only one of the expected values, you can use the enum type.</p><p>For example, now add the  field to , and its value can only be one of , , , , , , and . This can be achieved by adding an enum to the message definition and adding a constant for each possible enum value.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>The first constant of the  enum must be mapped to 0, and all enum definitions need to include a constant mapped to 0, and this value is the first line content of the enum definition. This is because 0 is used as the default value of the enum. In the proto2 syntax, the enum value on the first line is always the default value. For the sake of compatibility, the value 0 must be the first line of the definition.</p><p>Other  files can be imported in a  file, so as to use the message types defined in the imported file.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>By default, only the message types defined in the directly imported  file can be used. But sometimes it may be necessary to move the  file to a new location. At this time, a virtual  file can be placed in the old location, and the  syntax can be used to forward all imports to the new location, instead of directly moving the  file and updating all call points at once. Any place that imports a proto file containing the  statement can pass on the public dependencies of the imported dependencies.</p><p>For example, there are  and  files in the current folder, and  is imported in the  file, that is, the  file has the following content:</p><p>Suppose now we want to put the messages in  into the  file for use in other places. We can modify  and import  in it. Note that we need to use  because a single  can only use the messages defined in  and cannot use the message types in the proto file imported in .</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>When using  for compilation, the option  or  needs to be used to notify  where to find the imported files. If the search path is not specified,  will look for it in the current directory (the path where  is called).</p><p>Message types in the proto2 version can be imported into a proto3 file for use, and message types in the proto3 version can also be imported into a proto2 file. But the enum types in proto2 cannot be directly applied to the proto3 syntax.</p><p>Message types can be defined inside another message type, that is, nested definitions. For example, the  type is defined inside , and it supports multiple levels of nesting.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>When an outer message type uses a message inside another message, such as the  type using , it can use .</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Unknown fields are fields that the proto compiler cannot recognize. For example, when an old binary file parses the data sent by a new binary file with new fields, these new fields will become unknown fields in the old binary file. In the initial version of proto3, unknown fields were discarded when the message was parsed, but in version 3.5, the retention of unknown fields was reintroduced. Unknown fields are retained during parsing and are included in the serialized output.</p><p>The key to the high efficiency of Protobuf lies in its TLV (tag-length-value) encoding format. Each field has a unique  value as an identifier,  represents the length of the  data (for a  with a fixed length, there is no ), and  is the content of the data itself.</p><p>For the  value, it is composed of two parts:  and .  is the number given to each field in the  earlier, and  represents the type (fixed length or variable length). The  currently has 6 values from 0 to 5, and these 6 values can be represented by 3 bits.</p><p>The values of  are shown in the following table, where 3 and 4 have been deprecated, and we only need to pay attention to the remaining 4 types. For data encoded with Varint, there is no need to store the byte length , and at this time, the TLV encoding format degenerates into TV encoding. For 64-bit and 32-bit data, there is also no need for  because the  value already indicates whether the length is 8 bytes or 4 bytes.</p><div><table><thead><tr></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>int32 int64 uint32 uint64 bool enum</td></tr><tr></tr><tr></tr><tr><td>string bytes packed repeated fields embedded</td></tr><tr></tr><tr></tr><tr></tr></tbody></table></div><h3>\n  \n  \n  Varint Encoding Principle\n</h3><p>Varint is a variable-length int, which is a variable-length encoding method. It can make smaller numbers use fewer bytes to represent, and achieve data compression by reducing the number of bytes used to represent numbers. For an int32 type number, it usually requires 4 bytes to represent, but with Varint encoding, an int32 type number less than 128 can be represented with 1 byte. For larger numbers, it may require 5 bytes to represent, but in most messages, very large numbers usually do not appear, so using Varint encoding can use fewer bytes to represent numbers.</p><p>Varint is a variable-length encoding, and it distinguishes each field through the highest bit of each byte. If the highest bit of a byte is 1, it means that the subsequent byte is also part of the number; if it is 0, it means that this is the last byte, and the remaining 7 bits are all used to represent the number. Although each byte will waste 1 bit of space (that is, 1/8 = 12.5% waste), if there are many numbers that do not need to be fixed as 4 bytes for representation, a large amount of space can still be saved.</p><p>For example, for an int32 type number 65, its Varint encoding process is as follows, and the 65 that originally occupied 4 bytes only occupies 1 byte after encoding.</p><p>For an int32 type number 128, it occupies 2 bytes after encoding.</p><p>Varint decoding is the reverse process of encoding, which is relatively simple, and no example is given here.</p><p>numbers to unsigned numbers, and then use Varint encoding to reduce the number of bytes after encoding.</p><p>Zigzag uses unsigned numbers to represent signed numbers, enabling numbers with smaller absolute values to be represented with fewer bytes. Before understanding Zigzag encoding, let's first understand a few concepts:</p><ul><li>: The highest bit is the sign bit, and the remaining bits represent the absolute value.</li><li>: Except for the sign bit, invert the remaining bits of the original code one by one.</li><li>: For positive numbers, the two's complement is itself; for negative numbers, except for the sign bit, invert the remaining bits of the original code one by one and then add 1.</li></ul><p>Take the int32 type number -2 as an example, and its encoding process is as follows.</p><p>In summary, for negative numbers, perform arithmetic operations on their two's complement. For a number , if it is of the  type, perform the operation ; if it is of the  type, perform the operation . Through this operation, the negative number is changed to a positive number, and this process is Zigzag encoding. Finally, use Varint encoding.</p><p>Since Varint and Zigzag encoding can self-parse the content length, the length item can be omitted, and the TLV storage is simplified to TV storage, without the need for the  item.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Calculation Methods of tag and value Values\n</h3><p>The  stores the identification information and data type information of the field, that is,  (field data type) +  (identification number). The field number can be obtained through the , corresponding to the defined message field. The calculation formula is <code>tag = field_number&lt;&lt;3 | wire_type</code>, and then perform Varint encoding on it.</p><p>The  is the value of the message field after Varint and Zigzag encoding.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  string Encoding (continued)\n</h3><p>When the field type is the  type, the field value is encoded in UTF-8. For example, there is the following message definition:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>In the Go language, the sample code for encoding this message is as follows:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>The binary content after encoding is as follows:</p><div><pre><code>[10 14 67 104 105 110 97 228 184 173 144 155 189 228 120 186]\n</code></pre></div><p>Nested messages mean that the  is another field message. The outer message is stored using TLV storage, and its  is also a TLV storage structure. The schematic diagram of the entire encoding structure is as follows (it can be imagined as a tree structure, where the outer message is the root node, and the nested message inside it is used as a child node, and each node follows the TLV encoding rule):</p><ol><li>The outermost message has its corresponding ,  (if any), and .</li><li>When the  is a nested message, this nested message has its own independent ,  (if any), and .</li><li>By analogy, if there are nested messages within the nested message, continue to encode according to the TLV rule.</li></ol><h3>\n  \n  \n  repeated Fields with packed\n</h3><p>The fields modified by  can be with  or without it. For multiple field values of the same  field, their  values are all the same, that is, the data type and field sequence number are the same. If multiple  storages are used, there will be redundancy of the .</p><p>If  is set, the storage method of the  field will be optimized. That is, the same  is only stored once, and then the total length  of all values under the  field is added to form a  storage structure. This method can effectively compress the length of the serialized data and save transmission overhead. For example:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>In the above example, the  field does not use , and each  value will have independent  and  storage; while the  field uses , and the  will only be stored once, followed by the total length  of all  values, and then all  values are arranged in sequence. In this way, when the data volume is large, the  field using  can significantly reduce the space occupied by the data and the bandwidth consumption during transmission. </p><p>With its efficiency (in terms of size) and professionalism (professional types), Protobuf should have a higher coverage in the future data transmission field.</p><p>Finally, I would like to introduce to you the most suitable platform for deploying services: </p><h3>\n  \n  \n  1.

I decided to create a project from scratch using Go for the backend and Angular 19 for the frontend. The project is a service for managing feature flags, inspired by great existing solutions. My primary focus was on implementing the principles of Clean Architecture while also improving my SQL skills by working directly with PostgreSQL without an ORM.</p><p>The source code can be found here:</p><p>The idea was to create a dashboard where users can sign in and manage their projects, environments and flags. Then, project's specific flags can be retrieved by user's app using a public api. The first thing that i wasn't sure about is how to implement this public interaction in a secure way, we will dive into that later, but the idea was to create some sort of library that handle this communication using a public key.</p><p>For the dashboard, I aimed to create an intuitive and simple UI for basic operations like creating new projects and flags. My main goal was to clearly display the status of the flags in each environment. This was the initial sketch of the UI.</p><p>I also wanted to implement collaboration, allowing multiple users to access the same project. This necessitates the implementation of a role/permission system, where, for example, only the owner can delete a project.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  First step: Designing the database\n</h2><p>Let's dive into some technical details, starting with database design. I wanted to use a relational database, but at this stage, I didn‚Äôt really care which one to choose. So, as a first step, I started thinking about all the entities and the relationships between them:</p><ul><li>: a person that can sign up and have access to the dashboard</li><li>: represent a container of environment and flags</li><li>: each project can have one or more environments, this is useful for a real world project where multiple test environment can exist.</li><li>: represent a single feature that can be enabled or not</li></ul><p>I started creating many-to-many relationship between users and project, so we can easily implement collaboration as mentioned before.\nThe one-to-many relationship between  and  it's pretty straight forward as one project can have multiple environments.</p><p>Nothing special so far, but things started to get tricky when I encountered the flag table. </p><p>The first idea that came to mind was that each flag should be directly related to an environment. This seemed logical, given that we‚Äôre working in a multi-environment system where the end user needs to request flags for a specific environment. However, I quickly realized that this could introduce some introduce some complexities.</p><p>Imagine you're inside the dashboard for a specific project that has 3 environments (TEST, QA, PROD), and you want to create a new flag called 'dark_mode_experimental'. This means you would need to create 3 new rows in the  table, one for each environment. Then, if you want to update the flag name to 'dark_mode', you would need to update all the rows accordingly. The same applies if you want to delete a flag. Furthermore, if a project already has some flags and you want to add another environment (let's say 'DEV'), you would need to duplicate all the existing flags for this new environment, which can lead to increased complexity and potential maintenance issues.</p><p>The final solution is that flags belong to a project while maintaining a many-to-many relationship with environments through the  table. This table allows us to store the flag status for each specific environment. By doing so, we can easily manage flag updates and deletions without needing to duplicate or update rows across multiple environments.</p><p>What happens when a new environment is created within a project is quite simple: we just add a new row in the  table. The relations in the  table are not created immediately but only after a flag is updated. This ensures that we avoid unnecessary entries for environments where no flags have been modified yet. Once a flag is updated, the corresponding relation in the flag_environment table is established, allowing us to track the flag's status in the new environment. </p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Step two: Implementing Go backend\n</h2><p>As I mentioned, I'm more of a frontend person, but I have a strong interest in learning backend technologies. During my studies, I worked with several different languages, mostly C, Java, and Python. These are great languages, but I wanted to try something new. Recently, I heard a lot of positive things about Go, so I decided to give it a shot.</p><p>There are a couple of things I want to mention before diving into the code. My main goal here was to structure the code by following clean architecture principles. This approach helps ensure that the code remains modular, maintainable, and testable. Additionally, for handling data, I chose not to use any ORM because I believe that for a study project, writing raw SQL is more instructive and provides a deeper understanding of how data is managed at the database level.</p><p>Let's start with folder structure</p><p>In Go, it's common to have a folder called  that contains the entry point of the program, and a folder called  for all the application code. That's what I did ‚Äî I created two subfolders inside : one for the API version and one for the CLI version of the service.</p><p>There are some great articles about clean architecture, and the structure I implemented is quite standard, so I won't go into detail about what each folder represents. I just want to highlight some parts of the code that demonstrate how the principles are applied and how the different components interact with each other in the project.</p><p>As I mentioned, I'm new to the Go world and still getting familiar with the ecosystem. From what I've seen so far, there aren't any major frameworks like those in the .NET or Java ecosystems that handle dependency injection in such a clean way. Therefore, I decided to implement dependency injection in a very 'vanilla' way, without relying on any external frameworks. Here is an example</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>An interactor is a struct with some dependencies that has methods to fulfill some business use cases, e.g.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>There are several aspects that can be improved, such as error handling or using a factory to create entities. However, the key idea is that the 'Create Environment' use case is managed within this method, which does not rely on any concrete implementation.</p><p>In this project, I implemented anemic entities, which is not ideal. For example, all fields are public so they can be serialized using Go's standard library, although I'm not fully convinced this is the best approach.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>The infrastructure folder contains all the implementations related to external dependencies. In this case, it includes the repository implementation for PostgreSQL and the middleware used by the HTTP framework.</p><p>I decided to use PostgreSQL as the database for no particular reason (well, maybe because I already had a Docker image pulled). However, thanks to clean architecture, it's easy to swap the database by simply implementing a new repository that adheres to the same interface. For example:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>In this case, interfaces refer to the components that allow external systems to interact with the application. For a web API, this typically consists of a function that, for example, extracts request parameters or body data, creates a DTO, and calls the interactor.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><h4>\n  \n  \n  Authentication for the admin section\n</h4><p>When dealing with authentication in the real world, it's better to relay on well tested library to improve security. However this for this simple project i decided to implement a username and password authentication that works with JWT tokens from scratch, using this popular library 'github.com/golang-jwt/jwt/v5'.</p><h4>\n  \n  \n  Implementation of the \"public api\"\n</h4><p>To allow the end user to access flags for a certain environment, I decided to implement a public key pattern. Essentially, there is a public REST API protected by a middleware that checks for a specific header containing a key. If the key is valid, it grants read-only access to all the enabled flags for that environment. Even if the public key gets stolen, the impact is limited. Since it only grants read-only, the key cannot be used to modify any data or access sensitive information.</p><p>That's how i implemented the middleware</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Then in the route definition</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>To interact with the public API I wrote a simple typescript SDK that allow to easily communicate with the service. It provides basic caching and types, and can be used by any javascript app.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><h3>\n  \n  \n  Admin dashboard in Angular 19\n</h3><p>Once I completed the backend, I wanted to interact with my service through a comfortable UI. Angular 19 had just come out with stable signals and other cool features, so I decided to use it for the frontend. I didn‚Äôt want to spend too much time designing UI components, hence I decided to use a component library that provides pre-built, customizable components. This allowed me to focus more on the core functionality and user experience. The library i choose is <a href=\"https://taiga-ui.dev\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Taiga UI</a>.</p><p>The frontend is quite simple, a bit different from the initial sketch but it provides all the features i need.</p><p>List of user projects<a href=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Frb0w8emw1cc77mmswnh9.png\"><img src=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Frb0w8emw1cc77mmswnh9.png\" alt=\"Ui project list\" width=\"800\" height=\"477\"></a></p><p>An interesting feature I added consists of a section where you can test the payload of the public api for the environment. It works by making an api call to public endpoint using the environment key of the selected environment, and then it shows the response.</p><ul><li>Unit testing: Clean architecture is great and makes things easier to test, but I haven‚Äôt written a single test for my business logic yet. This is definitely something to focus on moving forward.</li><li>Collaboration is supported, but there is currently no way to \"invite\" someone to join a project (just manually on db). In the future, it would be cool to implement an invitation system, allowing users to easily add collaborators and manage team access.</li></ul>","contentLength":9963,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"I created a fairly extensive cheat sheet for scripting Sieve mail filters.

This shutdown barrier makes it such that runtime tasks never outlive TLS data owned by worker threads; this makes every invariant lifetime guaranteed to be valid until no tasks remain.

According to a paper published by a group from the research institute, Epoch <a href=\"https://towardsdatascience.com/the-next-ai-revolution-a-tutorial-using-vaes-to-generate-high-quality-synthetic-data/#[1]\">[1]</a>,<em> we are running out of data</em>.

For example, if a dataset contains many more men than women, our model may be biased towards recognising men and misclassify future female samples as men.&nbsp;</p><p>In this article we show the imbalance in the popular UCI<a href=\"https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/2/adult\"> Adult dataset</a><a href=\"https://towardsdatascience.com/the-next-ai-revolution-a-tutorial-using-vaes-to-generate-high-quality-synthetic-data/#[2]\">[2],</a> and how we can use a  to generate <a href=\"https://towardsdatascience.com/tag/synthetic-data/\" title=\"Synthetic Data\">Synthetic Data</a> to improve classification on this example.&nbsp;</p><p>We first download the Adult dataset. This dataset contains features such as age, education and occupation which can be used to predict the target outcome ‚Äòincome‚Äô.&nbsp;</p><pre><code># Download dataset into a dataframe\nurl = \"https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/adult/adult.data\"\ncolumns = [\n   \"age\", \"workclass\", \"fnlwgt\", \"education\", \"education-num\", \"marital-status\",\n   \"occupation\", \"relationship\", \"race\", \"sex\", \"capital-gain\",\n   \"capital-loss\", \"hours-per-week\", \"native-country\", \"income\"\n]\ndata = pd.read_csv(url, header=None, names=columns, na_values=\" ?\", skipinitialspace=True)\n\n# Drop rows with missing values\ndata = data.dropna()\n\n# Split into features and target\nX = data.drop(columns=[\"income\"])\ny = data['income'].map({'&gt;50K': 1, '&lt;=50K': 0}).values\n\n# Plot distribution of income\nplt.figure(figsize=(8, 6))\nplt.hist(data['income'], bins=2, edgecolor='black')\nplt.title('Distribution of Income')\nplt.xlabel('Income')\nplt.ylabel('Frequency')\nplt.show()</code></pre><p>In the Adult dataset, income is a binary variable, representing individuals who earn above, and below, $50,000. We plot the distribution of income over the entire dataset below. We can see that the dataset is heavily imbalanced with a far larger number of individuals who earn less than $50,000.&nbsp;</p><p>Despite this imbalance we can still train a machine learning classifier on the Adult dataset which we can use to determine whether unseen, or test, individuals should be classified as earning above, or below, 50k.&nbsp;</p><pre><code># Preprocessing: One-hot encode categorical features, scale numerical features\nnumerical_features = [\"age\", \"fnlwgt\", \"education-num\", \"capital-gain\", \"capital-loss\", \"hours-per-week\"]\ncategorical_features = [\n   \"workclass\", \"education\", \"marital-status\", \"occupation\", \"relationship\",\n   \"race\", \"sex\", \"native-country\"\n]\n\npreprocessor = ColumnTransformer(\n   transformers=[\n       (\"num\", StandardScaler(), numerical_features),\n       (\"cat\", OneHotEncoder(), categorical_features)\n   ]\n)\n\nX_processed = preprocessor.fit_transform(X)\n\n# Convert to numpy array for PyTorch compatibility\nX_processed = X_processed.toarray().astype(np.float32)\ny_processed = y.astype(np.float32)\n# Split dataset in train and test sets\nX_model_train, X_model_test, y_model_train, y_model_test = train_test_split(X_processed, y_processed, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)\n\n\nrf_classifier = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)\nrf_classifier.fit(X_model_train, y_model_train)\n\n# Make predictions\ny_pred = rf_classifier.predict(X_model_test)\n\n# Display confusion matrix\nplt.figure(figsize=(6, 4))\nsns.heatmap(cm, annot=True, fmt=\"d\", cmap=\"YlGnBu\", xticklabels=[\"Negative\", \"Positive\"], yticklabels=[\"Negative\", \"Positive\"])\nplt.xlabel(\"Predicted\")\nplt.ylabel(\"Actual\")\nplt.title(\"Confusion Matrix\")\nplt.show()</code></pre><p>Printing out the confusion matrix of our classifier shows that our model performs fairly well despite the imbalance.

The model is frequently incorrectly classifying individuals who earn more than 50k as earning less than 50k.&nbsp;</p><p>Below we show how we can use a <a href=\"https://towardsdatascience.com/tag/variational-autoencoder/\" title=\"Variational Autoencoder\">Variational Autoencoder</a> to generate synthetic data of the positive class to balance this dataset. We then train the same model using the synthetically balanced dataset and reduce model errors on the test set.&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>How can we generate synthetic data?</strong></h2><p>There are lots of different methods for generating synthetic data. These can include more traditional methods such as SMOTE and Gaussian Noise which generate new data by modifying existing data. Alternatively Generative models such as Variational Autoencoders or General Adversarial networks are predisposed to generate new data as their architectures learn the distribution of real data and use these to generate synthetic samples.</p><p><strong>In this tutorial we use a variational autoencoder to generate synthetic data.</strong></p><p>Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) are great for synthetic data generation because they use real data to learn a continuous latent space. We can view this latent space as a magic bucket from which we can sample synthetic data which closely resembles existing data. The continuity of this space is one of their big selling points as it means the model generalises well and doesn‚Äôt just memorise the latent space of specific inputs.</p><p>A VAE consists of an , which maps input data into a probability distribution (mean and variance) and a , which reconstructs the data from the latent space.&nbsp;</p><p>For that continuous latent space, VAEs use a reparameterization trick where a random noise vector is scaled and shifted using the learned mean and variance, ensuring smooth and continuous representations in the latent space.</p><p>Below we construct a  class which implements this process with a simple architecture.</p><ul><li> compresses the input into a smaller, hidden representation, producing both a mean and log variance that define a Gaussian distribution aka creating our magic sampling bucket. Instead of directly sampling, the model applies the reparameterization trick to generate latent variables, which are then passed to the decoder.&nbsp;</li><li> reconstructs the original data from these latent variables, ensuring the generated data maintains characteristics of the original dataset.&nbsp;</li></ul><pre><code>class BasicVAE(nn.Module):\n   def __init__(self, input_dim, latent_dim):\n       super(BasicVAE, self).__init__()\n       # Encoder: Single small layer\n       self.encoder = nn.Sequential(\n           nn.Linear(input_dim, 8),\n           nn.ReLU()\n       )\n       self.fc_mu = nn.Linear(8, latent_dim)\n       self.fc_logvar = nn.Linear(8, latent_dim)\n      \n       # Decoder: Single small layer\n       self.decoder = nn.Sequential(\n           nn.Linear(latent_dim, 8),\n           nn.ReLU(),\n           nn.Linear(8, input_dim),\n           nn.Sigmoid()  # Outputs values in range [0, 1]\n       )\n\n   def encode(self, x):\n       h = self.encoder(x)\n       mu = self.fc_mu(h)\n       logvar = self.fc_logvar(h)\n       return mu, logvar\n\n   def reparameterize(self, mu, logvar):\n       std = torch.exp(0.5 * logvar)\n       eps = torch.randn_like(std)\n       return mu + eps * std\n\n   def decode(self, z):\n       return self.decoder(z)\n\n   def forward(self, x):\n       mu, logvar = self.encode(x)\n       z = self.reparameterize(mu, logvar)\n       return self.decode(z), mu, logvar</code></pre><p>Given our BasicVAE architecture we construct our loss functions and model training below.&nbsp;</p><pre><code>def vae_loss(recon_x, x, mu, logvar, tau=0.5, c=1.0):\n   recon_loss = nn.MSELoss()(recon_x, x)\n \n   # KL Divergence Loss\n   kld_loss = -0.5 * torch.sum(1 + logvar - mu.pow(2) - logvar.exp())\n   return recon_loss + kld_loss / x.size(0)\n\ndef train_vae(model, data_loader, epochs, learning_rate):\n   optimizer = optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=learning_rate)\n   model.train()\n   losses = []\n   reconstruction_mse = []\n\n   for epoch in range(epochs):\n       total_loss = 0\n       total_mse = 0\n       for batch in data_loader:\n           batch_data = batch[0]\n           optimizer.zero_grad()\n           reconstructed, mu, logvar = model(batch_data)\n           loss = vae_loss(reconstructed, batch_data, mu, logvar)\n           loss.backward()\n           optimizer.step()\n           total_loss += loss.item()\n\n           # Compute batch-wise MSE for comparison\n           mse = nn.MSELoss()(reconstructed, batch_data).item()\n           total_mse += mse\n\n       losses.append(total_loss / len(data_loader))\n       reconstruction_mse.append(total_mse / len(data_loader))\n       print(f\"Epoch {epoch+1}/{epochs}, Loss: {total_loss:.4f}, MSE: {total_mse:.4f}\")\n   return losses, reconstruction_mse\n\ncombined_data = np.concatenate([X_model_train.copy(), y_model_train.cop\ny().reshape(26048,1)], axis=1)\n\n# Train-test split\nX_train, X_test = train_test_split(combined_data, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)\n\nbatch_size = 128\n\n# Create DataLoaders\ntrain_loader = DataLoader(TensorDataset(torch.tensor(X_train)), batch_size=batch_size, shuffle=True)\ntest_loader = DataLoader(TensorDataset(torch.tensor(X_test)), batch_size=batch_size, shuffle=False)\n\nbasic_vae = BasicVAE(input_dim=X_train.shape[1], latent_dim=8)\n\nbasic_losses, basic_mse = train_vae(\n   basic_vae, train_loader, epochs=50, learning_rate=0.001,\n)\n\n# Visualize results\nplt.figure(figsize=(12, 6))\nplt.plot(basic_mse, label=\"Basic VAE\")\nplt.ylabel(\"Reconstruction MSE\")\nplt.title(\"Training Reconstruction MSE\")\nplt.legend()\nplt.show()</code></pre><p>consists of two components: , which measures how well the generated data matches the original input using Mean Squared Error (MSE), and , which ensures that the learned latent space follows a normal distribution.</p><p> optimises the VAE using the Adam optimizer over multiple epochs.

All passport applicants should be allowed to select whatever gender markers they feel best fit, including M, F, or X.</p><p>In humans, neither sex nor gender is binary at any level. There are several possible arrangements of sex chromosomes: X, XX, XY, XXY, XYY, XXX, tetrasomies, pentasomies, etc. A single person can contain a mosaic of cells with different genetics: some XX, some XYY. Chromosomes may not align with genitalia: people with XY chromosomes may have a vulva and internal testes. People with XY chromosomes and a small penis may be surgically and socially reassigned female at birth‚Äîand never told what happened. None of these biological dimensions necessarily align with one‚Äôs internal concept of gender, or one‚Äôs social presentation.</p><p>The executive order has no idea how biology works. It defines ‚Äúfemale‚Äù as ‚Äúa person belonging, at conception, to the sex that produces the large reproductive cell‚Äù. Zygotes do not produce reproductive cells at all: under this order none  of us have a sex. Oogenesis doesn‚Äôt start until over a month into embryo development.

You might be one of the roughly two percent of humans born with an uncommon sexual development and not even know it. Moreover, the proposed change fundamentally asks the wrong question: gender markers on passports are used by border control agents, and are expected to align with how those agents read the passport holder‚Äôs gender. A mismatch will create needless intimidation and hardship for travelers.</p><p>Of course most of us will not have our identities challenged under this order. That animus is reserved for trans people, for gender-non-conforming people, for anyone whose genetics, body, dress, voice, or mannerisms don‚Äôt quite fit the mold.

From ancient practices harvesting organic cacao in the Amazon basin, to chocolatiers sculpting edible art in the mountains of Switzerland, and enormous factories in Hershey, Pennsylvania churning out 70 million kisses per day, the nuanced forms and flavors of chocolate have been integrated into many cultures and their customs. While quality can greatly vary across chocolate products, a well-known, shelf-stable, easily shareable form of chocolate are M&amp;Ms. Readily found by convenience store check-out counters and in hotel vending machines, the brightly colored pellets are a popular treat whose packaging is re-branded to fit nearly any commercializable American holiday.</p><p>While living in Denmark in 2022, I heard a concerning claim: M&amp;Ms manufactured in Europe taste different, and arguably ‚Äúbetter,‚Äù than M&amp;Ms produced in the United States. While I recognized that fancy European chocolate is indeed quite tasty and often superior to American chocolate, it was unclear to me if the same claim should hold for M&amp;Ms. I learned that many Europeans perceive an ‚Äúunpleasant‚Äù or ‚Äútangy‚Äù taste in American chocolate, which is largely attributed to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.chemistryworld.com/podcasts/butyric-acid/1017662.article\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">butyric acid</a>, a compound resulting from differences in how milk is treated before incorporation into milk chocolate.</p><p>But honestly, how much of a difference could this make for M&amp;Ms?&nbsp;? I imagined M&amp;Ms would retain a relatively processed/mass-produced/cheap candy flavor wherever they were manufactured. As the lone American visiting a diverse lab of international scientists pursuing cutting-edge research in biosustainability, I was inspired to break out my data science toolbox and investigate this M&amp;M flavor phenomenon.</p><p>To quote a European woman, who shall remain anonymous, after she tasted an American M&amp;M while traveling in New York:</p><blockquote><p>‚ÄúThey taste so gross. Like vomit. I don‚Äôt understand how people can eat this. I threw the rest of the bag away.‚Äù</p></blockquote><p>Vomit? Really? In my experience, children raised in the United States had no qualms about eating M&amp;Ms. Growing up, I was accustomed to bowls of M&amp;Ms strategically placed in high traffic areas around my house to provide readily available sugar. Clearly American M&amp;Ms are edible. But are they significantly different and/or inferior to their European equivalent?</p><p>In response to the anonymous European woman‚Äôs scathing report, myself and two other Americans visiting Denmark sampled M&amp;Ms purchased locally in the Lyngby Storcenter F√∏tex. We hoped to experience the incredible improvement in M&amp;M flavor that was apparently hidden from us throughout our youths. But curiously, we detected no obvious flavor improvements.</p><p>Unfortunately, neither preliminary study was able to conduct a side-by-side taste test with proper controls and randomized M&amp;M sampling. Thus, we turn to science.</p><p>This study seeks to remedy the previous lack of thoroughness and investigate the following questions:</p><ol><li>Is there a&nbsp;&nbsp;that European M&amp;Ms are in fact better than American M&amp;Ms?</li><li><strong>Can Europeans actually detect a difference&nbsp;</strong>between M&amp;Ms purchased in the US vs in Europe when they don‚Äôt know which one they are eating? Or is this a&nbsp;&nbsp;amongst Europeans to make Americans feel embarrassed?</li><li><strong>Are Americans actually taste-blind&nbsp;</strong>to American vs European M&amp;Ms? Or can they taste a difference but simply don‚Äôt describe this difference as ‚Äúan improvement‚Äù in flavor?</li><li>Can these alleged taste differences be&nbsp;<strong>perceived by citizens of other continents</strong>? If so, do they find one flavor obviously superior?</li></ol><h3>2.1 Experimental design and data collection</h3><p>Participants were recruited by luring ‚Äî er,&nbsp;&nbsp;them to a social gathering (with the promise of free food) that was conveniently co-located with the testing site. Once a participant agreed to pause socializing and join the study, they were positioned at a testing station with a trained experimenter who guided them through the following steps:</p><ul><li>Participants sat at a table and received two cups: 1 empty and 1 full of water. With one cup in each hand, the participant was asked to close their eyes, and keep them closed through the remainder of the experiment.</li><li>The experimenter randomly extracted one M&amp;M with a spoon, delivered it to the participant‚Äôs empty cup, and the participant was asked to eat the M&amp;M (eyes still closed).</li><li>After eating each M&amp;M, the experimenter collected the taste response by asking the participant to report if they thought the M&amp;M tasted: Especially Good, Especially Bad, or Normal.</li><li>Each participant received a total of 10 M&amp;Ms (5 European, 5 American), one at a time, in a random sequence determined by random.org.</li><li>Between eating each M&amp;M, the participant was asked to take a sip of water to help ‚Äúcleanse their palate.‚Äù</li><li>: for each participant, the experimenter recorded the participant‚Äôs&nbsp;if this was ambiguous, the participant was asked to list the continent on which they have the strongest memories of eating candy as a child). For each of the 10 M&amp;Ms delivered, the experimenter recorded the&nbsp;&nbsp;(‚ÄúDenmark‚Äù or ‚ÄúUSA‚Äù), the&nbsp;&nbsp;and the participant‚Äôs&nbsp;. Experimenters were also encouraged to jot down any amusing phrases uttered by the participant during the test, recorded under&nbsp;(data available&nbsp;<a href=\"https://github.com/erinhwilson/mnm-taste-test/tree/main/data\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">here</a>).</li></ul><h3>2.2 Sourcing materials and recruiting participants</h3><p>Two bags of M&amp;Ms were purchased for this study. The American-sourced M&amp;Ms (‚ÄúUSA M&amp;M‚Äù) were acquired at the SFO airport and delivered by the author‚Äôs parents, who visited her in Denmark. The European-sourced M&amp;Ms (‚ÄúDenmark M&amp;M‚Äù) were purchased at a local F√∏tex grocery store in Lyngby, a little north of Copenhagen.</p><p>Experiments were conducted at two main time points. The first 14 participants were tested in Lyngby, Denmark in August 2022. They mostly consisted of friends and housemates the author met at the Novo Nordisk Foundation Center for Biosustainability at the Technical University of Denmark (DTU) who came to a ‚Äúgoing away party‚Äù into which the experimental procedure was inserted. A few additional friends and family who visited Denmark were also tested during their travels (e.g. on the train).</p><p>The remaining 37 participants were tested in Seattle, WA, USA in October 2022, primarily during a ‚ÄúTGIF happy hour‚Äù hosted by graduate students in the computer science PhD program at the University of Washington. This second batch mostly consisted of students and staff of the Paul. G. Allen School of Computer Science &amp; Engineering (UW CSE) who responded to the weekly Friday summoning to the Allen Center atrium for free snacks and drinks.</p><p>While this study set out to analyze global trends, unfortunately data was only collected from 51 participants the author was able to lure to the study sites and is not well-balanced nor representative of the 6 inhabited continents of Earth (Figure 1). We hope to improve our recruitment tactics in future work. For now, our analytical power with this dataset is limited to response trends for individuals from North America, Europe, and Asia, highly biased by subcommunities the author happened to engage with in late 2022.</p><p>While we did not acquire formal approval for experimentation with human test subjects, there were minor risks associated with this experiment: participants were warned that they may be subjected to increased levels of sugar and possible ‚Äúunpleasant flavors‚Äù as a result of participating in this study. No other risks were anticipated.</p><p>After the experiment however, we unfortunately observed several cases of deflated pride when a participant learned their taste response was skewed more positively towards the M&amp;M type they were not expecting. This pride deflation seemed most severe among European participants who learned their own or their fianc√©‚Äôs preference skewed towards USA M&amp;Ms, though this was not quantitatively measured and cannot be confirmed beyond anecdotal evidence.</p><h3>3.1 Overall response to ‚ÄúUSA M&amp;Ms‚Äù vs ‚ÄúDenmark M&amp;Ms‚Äù</h3><h4><strong>3.1.1 Categorical response analysis ‚Äî entire dataset</strong></h4><p>In our first analysis, we count the total number of ‚ÄúBad‚Äù, ‚ÄúNormal‚Äù, and ‚ÄúGood‚Äù taste responses and report the percentage of each response received by each M&amp;M type. M&amp;Ms from Denmark more frequently received ‚ÄúGood‚Äù responses than USA M&amp;Ms but also more frequently received ‚ÄúBad‚Äù responses. M&amp;Ms from the USA were most frequently reported to taste ‚ÄúNormal‚Äù (Figure 2). This may result from the elevated number of participants hailing from North America, where the USA M&amp;M is the default and thus more ‚ÄúNormal,‚Äù while the Denmark M&amp;M was more often perceived as better or worse than the baseline.</p><p><sup>Figure 2. Qualitative taste response distribution across the whole dataset. The percentage of taste responses for ‚ÄúBad‚Äù, ‚ÄúNormal‚Äù or ‚ÄúGood‚Äù was calculated for each type of M&amp;M. Figure made with Altair.</sup></p><p>Now let‚Äôs break out some <a href=\"https://towardsdatascience.com/tag/statistics/\" title=\"Statistics\">Statistics</a>, such as a&nbsp;-squared (X2) test to compare our observed distributions of categorical taste responses. Using the scipy.stats&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.stats.chi2_contingency.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">chi2_contingency</a>&nbsp;function, we built contingency tables of the observed counts of ‚ÄúGood,‚Äù ‚ÄúNormal,‚Äù and ‚ÄúBad‚Äù responses to each M&amp;M type. Using the X2 test to evaluate the null hypothesis that there is no difference between the two M&amp;Ms, we found the&nbsp;-value for the test statistic to be 0.0185, which is significant at the common&nbsp;-value cut off of 0.05, but not at 0.01. So a solid ‚Äúmaybe,‚Äù depending on whether you‚Äôd like this result to be significant or not.</p><h4><strong>3.1.2 Quantitative response analysis ‚Äî entire dataset.</strong></h4><p>The X2 test helps evaluate if there is a difference in categorical responses, but next, we want to determine a relative taste&nbsp;&nbsp;between the two M&amp;M types. To do this, we converted taste responses to a quantitative distribution and calculated a&nbsp;Briefly, ‚ÄúBad‚Äù = 1, ‚ÄúNormal‚Äù = 2, ‚ÄúGood‚Äù = 3. For each participant, we averaged the taste scores across the 5 M&amp;Ms they tasted of each type, maintaining separate taste scores for each M&amp;M type.</p><p>With the average taste score for each M&amp;M type in hand, we turn to scipy.stats&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.stats.ttest_ind.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">ttest_ind</a>&nbsp;(‚ÄúT-test‚Äù) to evaluate if the means of the USA and Denmark M&amp;M taste scores are different (the null hypothesis being that the means are identical). If the means are significantly different, it would provide evidence that one M&amp;M is perceived as significantly tastier than the other.</p><p>We found the average taste scores for USA M&amp;Ms and Denmark M&amp;Ms to be quite close (Figure 3), and not significantly different (T-test:&nbsp;= 0.721). Thus, across all participants, we do not observe a difference between the perceived taste of the two M&amp;M types (or if you enjoy parsing triple negatives: ‚Äúwe&nbsp;&nbsp;the null hypothesis that there is&nbsp;&nbsp;a difference‚Äù).</p><p>But does this change if we separate participants by continent of origin?</p><h3>3.2 Continent-specific responses to ‚ÄúUSA M&amp;Ms‚Äù vs ‚ÄúDenmark M&amp;Ms‚Äù</h3><p>We repeated the above X2 and T-test analyses after grouping participants by their continents of origin. The Australia and South America groups were combined as a minimal attempt to preserve data privacy. Due to the relatively small sample size of even the combined Australia/South America group (=3), we will refrain from analyzing trends for this group but include the data in several figures for completeness and enjoyment of the participants who may eventually read this.</p><h4><strong>3.2.1 Categorical response analysis ‚Äî by continent</strong></h4><p>In Figure 4, we display both the taste response counts (upper panel,&nbsp;<em>note the interactive legend</em>) and the response percentages (lower panel) for each continent group. Both North America and Asia follow a similar trend to the whole population dataset: participants report Denmark M&amp;Ms as ‚ÄúGood‚Äù more frequently than USA M&amp;Ms, but also report Denmark M&amp;Ms as ‚ÄúBad‚Äù more frequently. USA M&amp;Ms were most frequently reported as ‚ÄúNormal‚Äù (Figure 4).</p><p>On the contrary, European participants report USA M&amp;Ms as ‚ÄúBad‚Äù nearly 50% of the time and ‚ÄúGood‚Äù only 18% of the time, which is the most negative and least positive response pattern, respectively (when excluding the under-sampled Australia/South America group).</p><p><sup>Figure 4. Qualitative taste response distribution by continent. Upper panel: counts of taste responses ‚Äî click the legend to interactively filter! Lower panel: percentage of taste responses for each type of M&amp;M. Figure made with Altair.</sup></p><p>This appeared striking in bar chart form, however only North America had a significant X2&nbsp;-value () when evaluating each continent‚Äôs difference in taste response profile between the two M&amp;M types. The European&nbsp;-value is perhaps ‚Äúapproaching significance‚Äù in some circles, but we‚Äôre about to accumulate several more hypothesis tests and should be mindful of multiple hypothesis testing (Table 1). A false positive result here would be devastating.</p><p>When comparing the taste response profiles between two continents for the same M&amp;M type, there are a couple interesting notes. First, we observed no major taste discrepancies between all pairs of continents when evaluating Denmark M&amp;Ms ‚Äî the world seems generally consistent in their range of feelings about M&amp;Ms sourced from Europe (right column X2&nbsp;-values, Table 2). To visualize this comparison more easily, we reorganize the bars in Figure 4 to group them by M&amp;M type (Figure 5).</p><p><sup>Figure 5. Qualitative taste response distribution by M&amp;M type, reported as percentages. (Same data as Figure 4 but re-arranged). Figure made with Altair.</sup></p><p>However, when comparing continents to each other in response to USA M&amp;Ms, we see larger discrepancies. We found one pairing to be significantly different: European and North American participants evaluated USA M&amp;Ms very differently () (Table 2). It seems very unlikely that this observed difference is by random chance (left column, Table 2).</p><h4><strong>3.2.2 Quantitative response analysis ‚Äî by continent</strong></h4><p>We again convert the categorical profiles to quantitative distributions to assess continents‚Äô relative preference of M&amp;M types. For North America, we see that the taste score means of the two M&amp;M types are actually quite similar, but there is a higher density around ‚ÄúNormal‚Äù scores for USA M&amp;Ms (Figure 6A). The European distributions maintain a bit more of a separation in their means (though not quite significantly so), with USA M&amp;Ms scoring lower (Figure 6B). The taste score distributions of Asian participants is most similar (Figure 6C).</p><p>Reorienting to compare the quantitative means between continents‚Äô taste scores for the same M&amp;M type, only the comparison between North American and European participants on USA M&amp;Ms is significantly different based on a T-test () (Figure 6D), though now we&nbsp;&nbsp;are in danger of multiple hypothesis testing! Be cautious if you are taking this analysis at all seriously.</p><p>At this point, I feel myself considering that maybe Europeans are not just making this up. I‚Äôm not saying it‚Äôs as dramatic as some of them claim, but perhaps a difference does indeed exist‚Ä¶ To some degree, North American participants also perceive a difference, but the evaluation of Europe-sourced M&amp;Ms is not consistently positive or negative.</p><h3>3.3 M&amp;M taste alignment chart</h3><p>In our analyses thus far, we did not account for the baseline differences in M&amp;M appreciation between participants. For example, say Person 1 scored all Denmark M&amp;Ms as ‚ÄúGood‚Äù and all USA M&amp;Ms as ‚ÄúNormal‚Äù, while Person 2 scored all Denmark M&amp;Ms as ‚ÄúNormal‚Äù and all USA M&amp;Ms as ‚ÄúBad.‚Äù They would have the same relative preference for Denmark M&amp;Ms over USA M&amp;Ms, but Person 2 perhaps just does not enjoy M&amp;Ms as much as Person 1, and the relative preference signal is muddled by averaging the raw scores.</p><p>Inspired by the Lawful/Chaotic x Good/Evil alignment chart used in tabletop role playing games like Dungeons &amp; Dragons¬©<img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/2122.png\" alt=\"‚Ñ¢\">, in Figure 7, we establish an M&amp;M alignment chart to help determine the distribution of participants across M&amp;M enjoyment classes.</p><p>Notably, the upper right quadrant where both M&amp;M types are perceived as ‚ÄúGood‚Äù to ‚ÄúNormal‚Äù is mostly occupied by North American participants and a few Asian participants. All European participants land in the left half of the figure where USA M&amp;Ms are ‚ÄúNormal‚Äù to ‚ÄúBad‚Äù, but Europeans are somewhat split between the upper and lower halves, where perceptions of Denmark M&amp;Ms range from ‚ÄúGood‚Äù to ‚ÄúBad.‚Äù</p><p>An interactive version of Figure 7 is provided below for the reader to explore the counts of various M&amp;M alignment regions.</p><p><sup>Figure 7 (interactive): click and brush your mouse over the scatter plot to see the counts of continents in different M&amp;M enjoyment regions. Figure made with Altair.</sup></p><h3>3.4 Participant taste response ratio</h3><p>Next, to factor out baseline M&amp;M enjoyment and focus on participants‚Äô relative preference between the two M&amp;M types, we took the log ratio of each person‚Äôs&nbsp;<strong>USA M&amp;M taste score average</strong>&nbsp;divided by their&nbsp;<strong>Denmark M&amp;M taste score average</strong>.</p><p>As such, positive scores indicate a preference towards USA M&amp;Ms while negative scores indicate a preference towards Denmark M&amp;Ms.</p><p>On average, European participants had the strongest preference towards Denmark M&amp;Ms, with Asians also exhibiting a slight preference towards Denmark M&amp;Ms (Figure 8). To the two Europeans who exhibited deflated pride upon learning their slight preference towards USA M&amp;Ms, fear not: you did not think USA M&amp;Ms were ‚ÄúGood,‚Äù but simply ranked them as less bad than Denmark M&amp;Ms (see participant_id 4 and 17 in the interactive version of Figure 7). If you assert that M&amp;Ms are a bad American invention not worth replicating and return to consuming artisanal European chocolate, your honor can likely be restored.</p><p>North American participants are pretty split in their preference ratios: some fall quite neutrally around 0, others strongly prefer the familiar USA M&amp;M, while a handful moderately prefer Denmark M&amp;Ms. Anecdotally, North Americans who learned their preference skewed towards European M&amp;Ms displayed signals of inflated pride, as if their results signaled posh refinement.</p><p>Overall, a T-test comparing the distributions of M&amp;M preference ratios shows a possibly significant difference in the means between European and North American participants (), but come on, this is like the 20th p-value I‚Äôve reported ‚Äî this one is probably too close to call.</p><h3>3.5 Taste inconsistency and ‚ÄúPerfect Classifiers‚Äù</h3><p>For each participant, we assessed their taste score consistency by averaging the standard deviations of their responses to each M&amp;M type, and plotting that against their preference ratio (Figure 9).</p><p><sup>Figure 9. Participant taste consistency by preference ratio. The x-axis is a participant‚Äôs relative M&amp;M preference ratio. The y-axis is the average of the standard deviation of their USA M&amp;M scores and the standard deviation of their Denmark M&amp;M scores. A value of 0 on the y-axis indicates perfect consistency in responses, while higher values indicate more inconsistent responses. Figure made with Altair.</sup></p><p>Most participants were somewhat inconsistent in their ratings, ranking the same M&amp;M type differently across the 5 samples. This would be expected if the taste difference between European-sourced and American-sourced M&amp;Ms is not actually all that perceptible. Most inconsistent were participants who gave the same M&amp;M type ‚ÄúGood‚Äù, ‚ÄúNormal‚Äù,&nbsp;&nbsp;‚ÄúBad‚Äù responses (e.g., points high on the y-axis, with wider standard deviations of taste scores), indicating lower taste perception abilities.</p><p>Intriguingly, four participants ‚Äî one from each continent group ‚Äî were perfectly consistent: they reported the same taste response for each of the 5 M&amp;Ms from each M&amp;M type, resulting in an average standard deviation of 0.0 (bottom of Figure 9). Excluding the one of the four who simply rated all 10 M&amp;Ms as ‚ÄúNormal‚Äù, the other three appeared to be ‚ÄúPerfect Classifiers‚Äù ‚Äî either rating all M&amp;Ms of one type ‚ÄúGood‚Äù and the other ‚ÄúNormal‚Äù, or rating all M&amp;Ms of one type ‚ÄúNormal‚Äù and the other ‚ÄúBad.‚Äù Perhaps these folks are ‚Äúsuper tasters.‚Äù</p><p>Another possible explanation for the inconsistency in individual taste responses is that there exists a perceptible taste difference based on the M&amp;M color. Visually, the USA M&amp;Ms were noticeably more smooth and vibrant than the Denmark M&amp;Ms, which were somewhat more ‚Äúsplotchy‚Äù in appearance (Figure 10A). M&amp;M color was recorded during the experiment, and although balanced sampling was not formally built into the experimental design, colors seemed to be sampled roughly evenly, with the exception of Blue USA M&amp;Ms, which were oversampled (Figure 10B).</p><p>We briefly visualized possible differences in taste responses based on color (Figure 11), however we do not believe there are enough data to support firm conclusions. After all, on average each participant would likely only taste 5 of the 6 M&amp;M colors once, and 1 color not at all. We leave further M&amp;M color investigations to future work.</p><p>We assured each participant that there was no ‚Äúright ‚Äúanswer‚Äù in this experiment and that all feelings are valid. While some participants took this to heart and occasionally spent over a minute deeply savoring each M&amp;M and evaluating it as if they were a sommelier, many participants seemed to view the experiment as a competition (which occasionally led to deflated or inflated pride). Experimenters wrote down quotes and notes in conjunction with M&amp;M responses, some of which were a bit ‚Äúcolorful.‚Äù We provide a hastily rendered word cloud for each M&amp;M type for entertainment purposes (Figure 12) though we caution against reading too far into them without diligent sentiment analysis.</p><p>Overall, there does not appear to be a ‚Äúglobal consensus‚Äù that European M&amp;Ms are better than American M&amp;Ms. However, European participants tended to more strongly express negative reactions to USA M&amp;Ms while North American participants seemed relatively split on whether they preferred M&amp;Ms sourced from the USA vs from Europe. The preference trends of Asian participants often fell somewhere between the North Americans and Europeans.</p><p>Therefore, I‚Äôll admit that it‚Äôs probable that Europeans are not engaged in a grand coordinated lie about M&amp;Ms. The skew of most European participants towards Denmark M&amp;Ms is compelling, especially since I was the experimenter who personally collected much of the taste response data. If they found a way to cheat, it was done well enough to exceed my own passive perception such that I didn‚Äôt notice. However, based on this study, it would appear that a strongly negative ‚Äúvomit flavor‚Äù is not universally perceived and does not become apparent to non-Europeans when tasting both M&amp;Ms types side by side.</p><p>We hope this study has been illuminating! We would look forward to extensions of this work with improved participant sampling, additional M&amp;M types sourced from other continents, and deeper investigations into possible taste differences due to color.</p><p>Thank you to everyone who participated and ate M&amp;Ms in the name of science!</p><p><em>Article by Erin H.

However, the concepts used in game theory can be of interest to a wider audience, including data scientists, statisticians, computer scientists or psychologists, to name just a few. This article is the opener to a four-chapter tutorial series on the fundamentals of game theory, so stay tuned for the upcoming articles.&nbsp;</p><p>In this article, I will explain the kinds of problems <a href=\"https://towardsdatascience.com/tag/game-theory/\" title=\"Game Theory\">Game Theory</a> deals with and introduce the main terms and concepts used to describe a game. We will see some examples of games that are typically analysed within game theory and lay the foundation for deeper insights into the capabilities of game theory in the later chapters. But before we go into the details, I want to introduce you to some applications of game theory, that show the multitude of areas game-theoretic concepts can be applied to.&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Applications of game theory</strong></h2><p>Does it make sense to vote for a small party in an election if this party may not have a chance to win anyway? Is it worth starting a price war with your competitor who offers the same goods as you? Do you gain anything if you reduce your catch rate of overfished areas if your competitors simply carry on as before? Should you take out insurance if you believe that the government will pay for the reconstruction after the next hurricane anyway? And how should you behave in the next auction where you are about to bid on your favourite Picasso painting?&nbsp;</p><p>All these questions (and many more) live within the area of applications that can be modelled with game theory. Whenever a situation includes strategic decisions in interaction with others, game-theoretic concepts can be applied to describe this situation formally and search for decisions that are not made intuitively but that are backed by a notion of rationality. Key to all the situations above is that your decisions depend on other people‚Äôs behaviour. If everybody agrees to conserve the overfished areas, you want to play along to preserve nature, but if you think that everybody else will continue fishing, why should you be the only one to stop? Likewise, your voting behaviour in an election might heavily depend on your assumptions about other people‚Äôs votes. If nobody votes for that candidate, your vote will be wasted, but if everybody thinks so, the candidate doesn‚Äôt have a chance at all. Maybe there are many people who say ‚ÄúI would vote for him if others vote for him too‚Äù. </p><p>Similar situations can happen in very different situations. Have you ever thought about having food delivered and everybody said ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt have to order anything because of me, but if you order anyway, I‚Äôd take some french fries‚Äù? All these examples can be applications of game theory, so let‚Äôs start understanding what game theory is all about.&nbsp;</p><p>When you hear the word , you might think of  such as Minecraft,  such as Monopoly, or  such as poker. There are some common principles to all these games: We always have some  who are allowed to do certain things determined by the game‚Äôs . For example, in poker, you can raise, check or give up. In Monopoly, you can buy a property you land on or don‚Äôt buy it. What we also have is some notion of how to  the game. In poker, you have to get the best hand to win and in Monopoly, you have to be the last person standing after everybody went bankrupt. That also means that some actions are better than others in some scenarios. If you have two aces on the hand, staying in the game is better than giving up.&nbsp;</p><p>When we look at games from the perspective of game theory, we use the same concepts, just more formally.</p><p>A game consists of a set of  = {1, .., n}, where each player has a set of  and a . The set of strategies is determined by the rules of the games. For example, it could be S = {check, raise, give-up} and the player would have to decide which of these actions they want to use. The utility function u (also called ) describes how valuable a certain action of a player would be, given the actions of the other players. Every player wants to maximize their utility, but now comes the tricky part: The utility of an action of yours depends on the other players‚Äô actions. But for them, the same applies: Their actions‚Äô utilities depend on the actions of the other players (including yours).&nbsp;</p><p>Let‚Äôs consider a well-known game to illustrate this point. In rock-paper-scissors, we have n=2 players and each player can choose between three actions, hence the strategy set is S={rock, paper, scissors} for each player. But the utility of an action depends on what the other player does. If our opponent chooses rock, the utility of paper is high (1), because paper beats rock. But if your opponent chooses scissors, the utility of paper is low (-1), because you would lose. Finally, if your opponent chooses paper as well, you reach a draw and the utility is 0.&nbsp;</p><p>Instead of writing down the utility function for each case individually, it is common to display games in a matrix like this:</p><p>The first player decides for the row of the matrix by selecting his action and the second player decides for the column. For example, if player 1 chooses paper and player 2 chooses scissors, we end up in the cell in the third column and second row. The value in this cell is the utility for both players, where the first value corresponds to player 1 and the second value corresponds to player 2. (-1,1) means that player 1 has a utility of -1 and player 2 has a utility of 1. Scissors beat paper.&nbsp;</p><p>Now we have understood the main components of a game in game theory. Let me add a few more hints on what game theory is about and what assumptions it uses to describe its scenarios.&nbsp;</p><ul><li>We often assume that the players select their actions at the same time (like in rock-paper-scissors). We call such games  games. There are also  games in which players take turns deciding on their actions (like in chess). We will consider these cases in a later chapter of this tutorial.&nbsp;</li><li>In game theory, it is typically assumed that the players  with each other so they can‚Äôt come to an agreement before deciding on their actions. In rock-paper-scissors, you wouldn‚Äôt want to do that anyway, but there are other games where communication would make it easier to choose an action. However, we will always assume that communication is not possible.&nbsp;</li><li>Game theory is considered a  theory, not a descriptive one. That means we will analyse games concerning the question ‚ÄúWhat would be the rational solution?‚Äù This may not always be what people do in a likewise situation in reality. Such descriptions of real human behaviour are part of the research field of behavioural economics, which is located on the border between <a href=\"https://towardsdatascience.com/tag/psychology/\" title=\"Psychology\">Psychology</a> and economics.&nbsp;</li></ul><p>Let us become more familiar with the main concepts of game theory by looking at some typical games that are often analyzed. Often, such games are derived from are story or scenario that may happen in the real world and require people to decide between some actions. One such story could be as follows:&nbsp;</p><p>Say we have two criminals who are suspected of having committed a crime. The police have some circumstantial evidence, but no actual proof for their guilt. Hence they question the two criminals, who now have to decide if they want to confess or deny the crime. If you are in the situation of one of the criminals, you might think that denying is always better than confessing, but now comes the tricky part: The police propose a deal to you. If you confess while your partner denies, you are considered a crown witness and will not be punished. In this case, you are free to go but your partner will go to jail for six years. Sounds like a good deal, but be aware, that the outcome also depends on your partner‚Äôs action. If you both confess, there is no crown witness anymore and you both go to jail for three years. If you both deny, the police can only use circumstantial evidence against you, which will lead to one year in prison for both you and your partner. But be aware, that your partner is offered the same deal. If you deny and he confesses, he is the crown witness and you go to jail for six years. How do you decide?</p><p>The game derived from this story is called the  and is a typical example of a game in game theory. We can visualize it as a matrix just like we did with rock-paper-scissors before and in this matrix, we easily see the dilemma the players are in. If both deny, they receive a rather low punishment. But if you assume that your partner denies, you might be tempted to confess, which would prevent you from going to jail. But your partner might think the same, and if you both confess, you both go to jail for longer. Such a game can easily make you go round in circles. We will talk about solutions to this problem in the next chapter of this tutorial. First, let‚Äôs consider some more examples.&nbsp;</p><p>You and your friend want to go to a concert together. You are a fan of Bach‚Äôs music but your friend favors the Russian 20th. century composer Igor Stravinsky. However, you both want to avoid being alone in any concert. Although you prefer Bach over Stravinsky, you would rather go to the Stravinsky concert with your friend than go to the Bach concert alone. We can create a matrix for this game:&nbsp;</p><p>You decide for the row by going to the Bach or Stravinsky concert and your friend decides for the column by going to one of the concerts as well. For you, it would be best if you both chose Bach. Your reward would be 2 and your friend would get a reward of 1, which is still better for him than being in the Stravinsky concert all by himself. However, he would be even happier, if you were in the Stravinsky concert together.&nbsp;</p><p>Do you remember, that we said players are not allowed to communicate before making their decision? This example illustrates why. If you could just call each other and decide where to go, this would not be a game to investigate with game theory anymore. But you can‚Äôt call each other so you just have to go to any of the concerts and hope you will meet your friend there. What do you do?&nbsp;</p><p>A third example brings us to the realm of international politics. The world would be a much happier place with fewer firearms, wouldn‚Äôt it? However, if nations think about disarmament, they also have to consider the choices other nations make. If the USA disarms, the Soviet Union might want to rearm, to be able to attack the USA‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääthat was the thinking during the Cold War, at least. Such a scenario could be described with the following matrix:&nbsp;</p><p>As you see, when both nations disarm, they get the highest reward (3 each), because there are fewer firearms in the world and the risk of war is minimized. However, if you disarm, while the opponent upgrades, your opponent is in the better position and gets a reward of 2, while you only get 0. Then again, it might have been better to upgrade yourself, which gives a reward of 1 for both players. That is better than being the only one who disarms, but not as good as it would get if both nations disarmed.&nbsp;</p><p>All these examples have one thing in common: There is no single option that is always the best. Instead, the utility of an action for one player always depends on the other player‚Äôs action, which, in turn, depends on the first player‚Äôs action and so on. Game theory is now interested in finding the optimal solution and deciding what would be the rational action; that is, the action that maximizes the expected reward. Different ideas on how exactly such a solution looks like will be part of the next chapter in this series.&nbsp;</p><p>Before continuing with finding solutions in the next chapter, let us recap what we have learned so far.&nbsp;</p><ul><li>A game consists of , that decide for , which have a  or .&nbsp;</li><li>The utility/reward of an action  on the other players‚Äô actions.&nbsp;</li><li>In  games, players decide for their actions simultaneously. In  games, they take turns.&nbsp;</li><li>The  is a very popular example of a game in game theory.</li><li>Games become increasingly interesting if there is no single action that is better than any other.&nbsp;</li></ul><p>Now that you are familiar with how games are described in game theory, you can check out the next chapter to learn how to find solutions for games in game theory.&nbsp;</p><p>The topics introduced here are typically covered in standard textbooks on game theory.

With the volume of business we do, even small improvements can have a significant impact.</p><p>In this post, we share how we modernized Rocket‚Äôs data science solution on AWS to increase the speed to delivery from eight weeks to under one hour, improve operational stability and support by reducing incident tickets by over 99% in 18 months, power 10 million automated data science and AI decisions made daily, and provide a seamless data science development experience.</p><h2>Rocket‚Äôs legacy data science environment challenges</h2><p>Rocket‚Äôs previous data science solution was built around Apache Spark and combined the use of a legacy version of the Hadoop environment and vendor-provided Data Science Experience development tools. The Hadoop environment was hosted on <a href=\"http://aws.amazon.com/ec2\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud</a> (Amazon EC2) servers, managed in-house by Rocket‚Äôs technology team, while the data science experience infrastructure was hosted on premises. Communication between the two systems was established through Kerberized Apache Livy (HTTPS) connections over <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/privatelink/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">AWS PrivateLink</a>.</p><p>Data exploration and model development were conducted using well-known machine learning (ML) tools such as Jupyter or Apache Zeppelin notebooks. Apache Hive was used to provide a tabular interface to data stored in HDFS, and to integrate with Apache Spark SQL. Apache HBase was employed to offer real-time key-based access to data. Model training and scoring was performed either from Jupyter notebooks or through jobs scheduled by Apache‚Äôs Oozie orchestration tool, which was part of the Hadoop implementation.</p><p>Despite the benefits of this architecture, Rocket faced challenges that limited its effectiveness:</p><ul><li><strong>Accessibility limitations:</strong> The data lake was stored in HDFS and only accessible from the Hadoop environment, hindering integration with other data sources. This also led to a backlog of data that needed to be ingested.</li><li><strong>Steep learning curve for data scientists:</strong> Many of Rocket‚Äôs data scientists did not have experience with Spark, which had a more nuanced programming model compared to other popular ML solutions like scikit-learn. This created a challenge for data scientists to become productive.</li><li><strong>Responsibility for maintenance and troubleshooting:</strong> Rocket‚Äôs DevOps/Technology team was responsible for all upgrades, scaling, and troubleshooting of the Hadoop cluster, which was installed on bare EC2 instances. This resulted in a backlog of issues with both vendors that remained unresolved.</li><li><strong>Balancing development vs. production demands:</strong> Rocket had to manage work queues between development and production, which were always competing for the same resources.</li><li> Rocket sought to support more real-time and streaming inferencing use cases, but this was limited by the capabilities of MLeap for real-time models and Spark Streaming for streaming use cases, which were still experimental at that time.</li><li>Inadequate data security and DevOps support ‚Äì The previous solution lacked robust security measures, and there was limited support for development and operations of the data science work.</li></ul><p>Rocket‚Äôs legacy data science architecture is shown in the following diagram.</p><p>The diagram depicts the flow; the key components are detailed below:</p><ol><li> Data is ingested into the system using Attunity data ingestion in Spark SQL.</li><li><strong>Data Storage and Processing:</strong> All compute is done as Spark jobs inside of a Hadoop cluster using Apache Livy and Spark. Data is stored in HDFS and is accessed via Hive, which provides a tabular interface to the data and integrates with Spark SQL. HBase is employed to offer real-time key-based access to data.</li><li> Data exploration and model development are conducted using tools such as Jupyter or Orchestration, which communicate with the Spark server over Kerberized Livy connection.</li><li><strong>Model Training and Scoring:</strong> Model training and scoring is performed either from Jupyter notebooks or through jobs scheduled by Apache‚Äôs Oozie orchestration tool, which is part of the Hadoop implementation.</li></ol><h2>Rocket‚Äôs migration journey</h2><p>At Rocket, we believe in the power of continuous improvement and constantly seek out new opportunities. One such opportunity is using data science solutions, but to do so, we must have a strong and flexible data science environment.</p><p>To address the legacy data science environment challenges, Rocket decided to migrate its ML workloads to the <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker-ai/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Amazon SageMaker AI</a> suite. This would allow us to deliver more personalized experiences and understand our customers better. To promote the success of this migration, we collaborated with the AWS team to create automated and intelligent digital experiences that demonstrated Rocket‚Äôs understanding of its clients and kept them connected.</p><p>We implemented an AWS multi-account strategy, standing up <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker-ai/studio/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Amazon SageMaker Studio</a> in a build account using a network-isolated Amazon VPC. This allows us to separate development and production environments, while also improving our security stance.</p><p>We moved our new work to SageMaker Studio and our legacy Hadoop workloads to <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/emr/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Amazon EMR</a>, connecting to the old Hadoop cluster using Livy and <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker-ai/notebooks/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">SageMaker notebooks</a> to ease the transition. This gives us access to a wider range of tools and technologies, enabling us to choose the most appropriate ones for each problem we‚Äôre trying to solve.</p><p>SageMaker AI has been instrumental in empowering our data science community with the flexibility to choose the most appropriate tools and technologies for each problem, resulting in faster development cycles and higher model accuracy. With SageMaker Studio, our data scientists can seamlessly develop, train, and deploy models without the need for additional infrastructure management.</p><p>As a result of this modernization effort, SageMaker AI enabled Rocket to scale our data science solution across Rocket Companies and integrate using a hub-and-spoke model. The ability of SageMaker AI to automatically provision and manage instances has allowed us to focus on our data science work rather than infrastructure management, increasing the number of models in production by five times and data scientists‚Äô productivity by 80%.</p><p>Our data scientists are empowered to use the most appropriate technology for the problem at hand, and our security stance has improved. Rocket can now compartmentalize data and compute, as well as compartmentalize development and production. Additionally, we are able to provide model tracking and lineage using <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker-ai/experiments/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Amazon SageMaker Experiments</a> and artifacts discoverable using the SageMaker model registry and <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker-ai/feature-store/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Amazon SageMaker Feature Store</a>. All the data science work has now been migrated onto SageMaker, and all the old Hadoop work has been migrated to Amazon EMR.</p><p>Overall, SageMaker AI has played a critical role in enabling Rocket‚Äôs modernization journey by building a more scalable and flexible ML framework, reducing operational burden, improving model accuracy, and accelerating deployment times.</p><p>The successful modernization allowed Rocket to overcome our previous limitations and better support our data science efforts. We were able to improve our security stance, make work more traceable and discoverable, and give our data scientists the flexibility to choose the most appropriate tools and technologies for each problem. This has helped us better serve our customers and drive business growth.</p><p>Rocket‚Äôs new data science solution architecture on AWS is shown in the following diagram.</p><p>The solution consists of the following components:</p><ol><li>Data is ingested into the data account from on-premises and external sources.</li><li> Raw data is refined into consumable layers (raw, processed, conformed, and analytical) using a combination of <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/glue\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">AWS Glue</a> extract, transform, and load (ETL) jobs and EMR jobs.</li><li> Refined data is registered in the data account‚Äôs AWS Glue Data Catalog and exposed to other accounts via Lake Formation. Analytic data is stored in <a href=\"http://aws.amazon.com/redshift\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Amazon Redshift</a>. Lake Formation makes this data available to both the build and compute accounts. For the build account, access to production data is restricted to read-only.</li><li> Data science development is done using SageMaker Studio. Data engineering development is done using AWS Glue Studio. Both disciplines have access to Amazon EMR for Spark development. Data scientists have access to the entire SageMaker ecosystem in the build account.</li><li>&nbsp;SageMaker trained models developed in the build account are registered with an MLFlow instance. Code artifacts for both data science activities and data engineering activities are stored in Git. Deployment initiation is controlled as part of CI/CD.</li><li>&nbsp;We have a number of workflow triggers. For online scoring, we typically provide an external-facing endpoint using Amazon EKS with Istio. We have numerous jobs that are launched by <a href=\"http://aws.amazon.com/lambda\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">AWS Lambda</a> functions that in turn are triggered by timers or events. Processes that run may include AWS Glue ETL jobs, EMR jobs for additional data transformations or model training and scoring activities, or SageMaker pipelines and jobs performing training or scoring activities.</li></ol><p>We‚Äôve evolved a long way in modernizing our infrastructure and workloads. We started our journey supporting six business channels and 26 models in production, with dozens in development. Deployment times stretched for months and required a team of three system engineers and four ML engineers to keep everything running smoothly. Despite the support of our internal DevOps team, our issue backlog with the vendor was an unenviable 200+.</p><p>Today, we are supporting nine organizations and over 20 business channels, with a whopping 210+ models in production and many more in development. Our average deployment time has gone from months to just weeks‚Äîsometimes even down to mere days! With just one part-time ML engineer for support, our average issue backlog with the vendor is practically non-existent. We now support over 120 data scientists, ML engineers, and analytical roles. Our framework mix has expanded to include 50% SparkML models and a diverse range of other ML frameworks, such as PyTorch and scikit-learn. These advancements have given our data science community the power and flexibility to tackle even more complex and challenging projects with ease.</p><p>The following table compares some of our metrics before and after migration.</p><table border=\"1px\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"10px\"><thead><tr></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>New data ingestion project took 4‚Äì8 weeks</td><td>Data-driven ingestion takes under one hour</td></tr><tr><td>Operation Stability and Supportability</td><td>Over a hundred incidents and tickets in 18 months</td><td>Fewer incidents: one per 18 months</td></tr><tr><td>Data scientists spent 80% of their time waiting on their jobs to run</td><td>Seamless data science development experience</td></tr><tr><td>Powers 10 million automated data science and AI decisions made daily</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Throughout the journey of modernizing our data science solution, we‚Äôve learned valuable lessons that we believe could be of great help to other organizations who are planning to undertake similar endeavors.</p><p>First, we‚Äôve come to realize that managed services can be a game changer in optimizing your data science operations.</p><p>The isolation of development into its own account while providing read-only access to production data is a highly effective way of enabling data scientists to experiment and iterate on their models without putting your production environment at risk. This is something that we‚Äôve achieved through the combination of SageMaker AI and Lake Formation.</p><p>Another lesson we learned is the importance of training and onboarding for teams. This is particularly true for teams that are moving to a new environment like SageMaker AI.

This is the first Gym environment for machine learning (ML) tasks, enabling research on reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms for training such agents. MLGym-bench consists of 13 diverse and open-ended AI research tasks from diverse domains such as computer vision, natural language processing, reinforcement learning, and game theory. Solving these tasks requires real-world AI research skills such as generating new ideas and hypotheses, creating and processing data, implementing ML methods, training models, running experiments, analyzing the results, and iterating through this process to improve on a given task. We evaluate a number of frontier large language models (LLMs) on our benchmarks such as Claude-3.5-Sonnet, Llama-3.1 405B, GPT-4o, o1-preview, and Gemini-1.5 Pro. Our MLGym framework makes it easy to add new tasks, integrate and evaluate models or agents, generate synthetic data at scale, as well as develop new learning algorithms for training agents on AI research tasks. We find that current frontier models can improve on the given baselines, usually by finding better hyperparameters, but do not generate novel hypotheses, algorithms, architectures, or substantial improvements.

While the documentation is comprehensive, it can be overwhelming to navigate, especially when you're trying to build advanced AI agents.</p><p>This guide is my attempt to consolidate the key concepts and practical implementations of LangGraph in one place. Whether you're building a conversational agent that needs to remember context, a multi-step reasoning agent, or a complex workflow that coordinates multiple AI components, LangGraph provides the framework to make it happen. I created this reference for myself but I hope it helps others who want a more straightforward explanation of how to use LangGraph effectively.</p><p>LangGraph is a framework that brings state machines to Large Language Model (LLM) applications. It's particularly useful when you need to build complex, stateful applications with LLMs. The framework allows you to structure your application as a graph, where each node represents a specific task or state, and edges represent transitions between states.</p><p>Let's start with a simple example to understand the core concepts: we are developing a simple agent that collects information and  processes it, the actions  of collecting and processing information are just fixed actions but they can be replaced with more complex actions.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>This example shows the basic structure of a LangGraph application:</p><ol><li>Define your state using TypedDict, it contains the information that the workflow will need to keep track of.</li><li>Create functions for each state, these functions are the actions that the workflow will perform.</li><li>Build a graph with nodes and edges, the nodes are the states and the edges are the transitions between them.</li><li>Compile the graph into a runnable application, this will create a callable object that can be invoked with an initial state.</li><li>I also added a simple way to save the graph visualization as a PNG file, this will work if you are running this example locally and should save a file that will show the graph structure like below.</li></ol><p>The graph is a good way to understand the workflow, it shows the nodes and the edges between them, the entry and finish points and the state of the workflow.</p><p>This particular example is not very useful but it shows the core concepts of LangGraph, you can simply replace the fixed actions with more complex ones and build a useful agent.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Serving LangGraph as a Web Service\n</h2><p>While LangGraph itself doesn't include built-in server capabilities, you can easily create a web service using <a href=\"https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">FastAPI</a> to serve your LangGraph workflows. Below I have modified the previous example to add a simple FastAPI server that allows you to run the workflow from a web interface.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>You can run this locally or using the <a href=\"https://huggingface.co/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Hugging Face</a> space below, this is the URL to access the swagger API for this example <a href=\"https://jstoppa-langgraph-basic-example-api.hf.space/docs\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://jstoppa-langgraph-basic-example-api.hf.space/docs</a>, the API has an end point to run the agent and it returns the messages we've seen in our previous example (see below the results). In simple words, the API has an end point to run the agent and it returns the messages we've seen in our previous example.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Making it all work with a more interesting example\n</h2><p>We are now going to create a more interesting example, an AI agent that does code reviews, this is far from a production-ready agent but it will give us a better understanding of how to use LangGraph.</p><p>The screenshot below shows the interface for the code review agent, the user can enter a code and the agent will return a report with the code analysis. This interface uses the <a href=\"https://www.gradio.app/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Gradio library</a> to create a simple web interface, this saves a lot of time compared to building a full web app.</p><p>The full code is provided after this but the most impportant part of the example is the graph, it shows the nodes and the edges between them, the entry and finish points and the state of the workflow, this is how the graph will look through the code and analyse the code with different agents that are especialised on different aspects. This is a very similar apporach we've seen in the previous example but it contains more actions and the actions do use LLMs to analyse the code.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>the full code for the agent is below and it can also be found in Hugging Face below.<a href=\"https://huggingface.co/spaces/jstoppa/langgraph_agent_code_reviewer\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fimg.shields.io%2Fbadge%2F%25F0%259F%25A4%2597%2520Run%2520in-Hugging%2520Face-blue\" alt=\"Run example in Hugging Face\" width=\"144\" height=\"20\"></a></p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>LangGraph makes it easier to build AI agents that need to manage complex workflows. The graph-based approach keeps things organised and flexible, especially when dealing with multi-step processes or memory.</p><p>Even though LangGraph doesn‚Äôt come with built-in server features, it works well with FastAPI and other frameworks to serve agents as APIs. Whether you‚Äôre building a chatbot, a code reviewer, or something else entirely, it gives you a solid foundation to work with.</p><p>I‚Äôm still experimenting and learning, so I‚Äôll keep updating this post as I find better ways to use LangGraph.

Previously, DXC had explored several existing alternatives but found limitations in each approach ‚Äì from communication constraints to infrastructure requirements that impacted reliability, scalability, and operational costs. DXC and AWS decided to organize a focused hackathon where DXC and AWS Solution Architects collaborated to:</p><ul><li>Define essential requirements for real-time translation</li><li>Establish latency and accuracy benchmarks</li><li>Create seamless integration paths with existing systems</li><li>Develop a phased implementation strategy</li><li>Prepare and test an initial proof of concept setup</li></ul><p>For DXC, this prototype was used as an enabler, allowing technical talent maximization, operational transformation, and cost improvements through:</p><ul><li>Best technical expertise delivery ‚Äì Hiring and matching agents based on technical knowledge rather than spoken language, making sure customers get top technical support regardless of language barriers</li><li>Global operational flexibility ‚Äì Removing geographical and language constraints in hiring, placement, and support delivery while maintaining consistent service quality across all languages</li><li>Cost reduction ‚Äì Eliminating multi-language expertise premiums, specialized language training, and infrastructure costs through pay-per-use translation model</li><li>Similar experience to native speakers ‚Äì Maintaining natural conversation flow with near real-time translation and audio feedback, while delivering premium technical support in customer‚Äôs preferred language</li></ul><p>The Amazon Connect V2V translation prototype uses AWS advanced speech recognition and machine translation technologies to enable real-time conversation translation between agents and customers, allowing them to speak in their preferred languages while having natural conversations. It consists of the following key components:</p><ul><li>Speech recognition ‚Äì The customer‚Äôs spoken language is captured and converted into text using <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/transcribe/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Amazon Transcribe</a>, which serves as the speech recognition engine. The transcript (text) is then fed into the machine translation engine.</li><li>Machine translation ‚Äì <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/translate/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Amazon Translate</a>, the machine translation engine, translates the customer‚Äôs transcript into the agent‚Äôs preferred language in near real time. The translated transcript is converted back into speech using <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/polly/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Amazon Polly</a>, which serves as the text-to-speech engine.</li><li>Bidirectional translation ‚Äì The process is reversed for the agent‚Äôs response, translating their speech into the customer‚Äôs language and delivering the translated audio to the customer.</li><li>Seamless integration ‚Äì The V2V translation sample project integrates with Amazon Connect, enabling agents to handle customer interactions in multiple languages without any additional effort or training, using the <a href=\"https://github.com/amazon-connect/amazon-connect-streams\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Amazon Connect Streams JS</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/aws/connect-rtc-js\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Amazon Connect RTC JS</a> libraries.</li></ul><p>The prototype can be extended with other AWS AI services to further customize the translation capabilities.

However, even with the shortest audio processing time, the user experience still doesn‚Äôt match the experience of a real conversation when both are speaking the same language. This is due to the specific pattern of the customer only hearing the agent‚Äôs translated speech, and the agent only hearing the customer‚Äôs translated speech. The following diagram displays that pattern.</p><p>The example workflow consists of the following steps:</p><ol><li>The customer starts speaking in their own language, and speaks for 10 seconds.</li><li>Because the agent only hears the customer‚Äôs translated speech, the agent first hears 10 seconds of silence.</li><li>When customer finishes speaking, the audio processing time takes 1‚Äì2 seconds, during which time both the customer and agent hear silence.</li><li>The customer‚Äôs translated speech is streamed to the agent. During that time, the customer hears silence.</li><li>When the customer‚Äôs translated speech playback is complete, the agent starts speaking, and speaks for 10 seconds.</li><li>Because customer only hears the agent‚Äôs translated speech, the customer hears 10 seconds of silence.</li><li>When the agent finishes speaking, the audio processing time takes 1‚Äì2 seconds, during which time both the customer and agent hear silence.</li><li>The agent‚Äôs translated speech is streamed to the agent. During that time, the agent hears silence.</li></ol><p>In this scenario, the customer hears a single block of 22‚Äì24 seconds of a complete silence, from the moment they finished speaking until they hear the agent‚Äôs translated voice. This creates a suboptimal experience, because the customer might not be certain what is happening during these 22‚Äì24 seconds‚Äîfor instance, if the agent was able to hear them, or if there was a technical issue.</p><p>In a face-to-face conversation scenario between two people that don‚Äôt speak the same language, they might have another person as a translator or interpreter. An example workflow consists of the following steps:</p><ol><li>Person A speaks in their own language, which is heard by Person B and the translator.</li><li>The translator translates what Person A said to Person B‚Äôs language. The translation is heard by Person B and Person A.</li></ol><p>Essentially, Person A and Person B hear each other speaking their own language, and they also hear the translation (from the translator). There‚Äôs no waiting in silence, which is even more important in non-face-to-face conversations (such as contact center interactions).</p><p>To optimize the customer/agent experience, the Amazon Connect V2V sample project implements audio streaming add-ons to simulate a more natural conversation experience. The following diagram illustrates an example workflow.</p><p>The workflow consists of the following steps:</p><ol><li>The customer starts speaking in their own language, and speaks for 10 seconds.</li><li>The agent hears the customer‚Äôs original voice, at a lower volume (‚ÄúStream Customer Mic to Agent‚Äù enabled).</li><li>When the customer finishes speaking, the audio processing time takes 1‚Äì2 seconds. During that time, the customer and agent hear subtle audio feedback‚Äîcontact center background noise‚Äîat a very low volume (‚ÄúAudio Feedback‚Äù enabled).</li><li>The customer‚Äôs translated speech is then streamed to the agent. During that time, the customer hears their translated speech, at a lower volume (‚ÄúStream Customer Translation to Customer‚Äù enabled).</li><li>When the customer‚Äôs translated speech playback is complete, the agent starts speaking, and speaks for 10 seconds.</li><li>The customer hears the agent‚Äôs original voice, at a lower volume (‚ÄúStream Agent Mic to Customer‚Äù enabled).</li><li>When the agent finishes speaking, the audio processing time takes 1‚Äì2 seconds. During that time, the customer and agent hear subtle audio feedback‚Äîcontact center background noise‚Äîat a very low volume (‚ÄúAudio Feedback‚Äù enabled).</li><li>The agent‚Äôs translated speech is then streamed to the agent. During that time, the agent hears their translated speech, at a lower volume (‚ÄúStream Agent Translation to Agent‚Äù enabled).</li></ol><p>In this scenario, the customer hears two short blocks (1‚Äì2 seconds) of subtle audio feedback, instead of a single block of 22‚Äì24 seconds of complete silence. This pattern is much closer to a face-to-face conversation that includes a translator.</p><p>The audio streaming add-ons provide additional benefits, including:</p><ul><li>Voice characteristics ‚Äì In cases when the agent and customer only hear their translated and synthesized speech, the actual voice characteristics are lost. For instance, the agent can‚Äôt hear if the customer was talking slow or fast, if the customer was upset or calm, and so on. The translated and synthesized speech doesn‚Äôt carry over that information.</li><li>Quality assurance ‚Äì In cases when call recording is enabled, only the customer‚Äôs original voice and the agent‚Äôs synthesized speech are recorded, because the translation and the synthetization are done on the agent (client) side. This makes it difficult for QA teams to properly evaluate and audit the conversations, including the many silent blocks within it. Instead, when the audio streaming add-ons are enabled, there are no silent blocks, and the QA team can hear the agent‚Äôs original voice, the customer‚Äôs original voice, and their respective translated and synthesized speech, all in a single audio file.</li><li>Transcription and translation accuracy ‚Äì Having both the original and translated speech available in the call recording makes it straightforward to detect specific words that would improve transcription accuracy (by using Amazon Transcribe custom vocabularies) or translation accuracy (using Amazon Translate custom terminologies), to make sure that your brand names, character names, model names, and other unique content are transcribed and translated to the desired result.</li></ul><h2>Get started with Amazon Connect V2V</h2><p>Ready to transform your contact center‚Äôs communication?

A\ncommon standard for this is , which ensures a\nconsistent format across endpoints. This method also supports content\nnegotiation between JSON and XML, keeping the structure consistent across\ndifferent formats.</p><p>GraphQL handles errors differently. It always responds with a  status\ncode, even when errors occur. Errors are communicated through an  array,\nwhich allows for partial success. For instance, GitHub's GraphQL API might\nreturn:</p><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code></code></pre><p>This approach allows for returning valid data alongside error details.</p><p>gRPC uses a predefined set of numeric status codes (ranging from 0 to 16) for\nerror handling, aligned with . Errors include structured details\nfor better context. Here's an example:</p><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code></code></pre><table><thead><tr></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Standard HTTP success codes</td></tr><tr></tr><tr></tr></tbody></table><p>Each protocol has its own approach, but they all follow two key principles:\n<strong>machine-readable error codes</strong> and . This ensures\nerrors are both understandable and actionable.</p><p>For cross-protocol APIs, API gateways can simplify error handling. They provide\nunified error schema management and automate transformations between\nprotocol-specific formats. This helps maintain consistency while respecting the\nconventions of each API type.</p><p>Effective error management relies on consistent monitoring and testing to uphold\nusability standards outlined in earlier protocols. This process builds on\nprotocol-specific error conventions to ensure smooth handling across systems.</p><p>A centralized error code system can ensure uniformity across distributed\nservices. For example, Google uses the  format, which\nenforces standardized error structures with both machine-readable codes and\nhuman-readable messages <a href=\"https://google.aip.dev/193\">[4]</a>.</p><p>In multi-service architectures, two main approaches are common:</p><table><thead><tr></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Ensures uniform error codes, Acts as a single source of truth</td><td>Requires strict oversight</td></tr><tr><td>Distributed with Prefixes</td><td>Allows team independence, Enables quicker updates</td><td>Demands thorough documentation</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Many organizations find that combining these methods provides the best results.</p><p>Key metrics to monitor include\n<a href=\"https://raygun.com/blog/best-error-monitoring-tools/\">[2]</a><a href=\"https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/discussions/appsonazure/best-practices-for-api-error-handling-a-comprehensive-guide/4088121\">[3]</a>:</p><ul><li><strong>Mean Time to Acknowledge (MTTA)</strong> errors: Target under 30 minutes.</li><li>: Should remain below 5% after fixes.</li><li><strong>95th percentile error resolution time</strong>: A critical benchmark for resolution\nspeed.</li><li><strong>User-impacting error ratio</strong>: Measured per 10,000 requests.</li></ul><p>Tools like <a href=\"https://sentry.io/\">Sentry</a> support distributed tracing in over 15\nlanguages, while <a href=\"https://raygun.com/\">Raygun</a> offers deployment correlation to\npinpoint issues <a href=\"https://raygun.com/blog/best-error-monitoring-tools/\">[2]</a>.</p><p>Testing ensures compliance with HTTP status codes and response formats covered\nin earlier sections.

It maintains the conversation state and handles the tool use workflow:</p><pre><code># From bedrockutility.py\ndef invoke_bedrock(self, message_list, system_message=[], tool_list=[],\n                  temperature=0, maxTokens=2048, guardrail_config=None):\n    response = self.bedrock.converse(\n        modelId=self.model_id,\n        messages=message_list,\n        system=system_message,\n        inferenceConfig={\n            \"maxTokens\": maxTokens,\n            \"temperature\": temperature\n        },\n        **({\"toolConfig\": {\"tools\": tool_list}} if tool_list else {})\n    )\n</code></pre><p>When the processor receives a document, it initiates a conversation loop with Anthropic‚Äôs Claude 3 Haiku, which analyzes the document and determines which tools to use based on the content. The model acts as an intelligent orchestrator, making decisions about the following:</p><ul><li>Which document processing tools to invoke</li><li>The sequence of processing steps</li><li>How to handle different document types within the same package</li><li>When to summarize and complete the processing</li></ul><p>This orchestration is managed through a continuous conversation loop that processes tool requests and their results until the entire document package has been processed.</p><p>The first key decision in the workflow is initiating the document classification process. Through the  class, the solution uses Anthropic‚Äôs Claude 3.5 Sonnet to analyze and categorize each page of the uploaded document into three main types: intake forms, insurance cards, and doctor‚Äôs notes:</p><pre><code># from document_classifier.py\nclass DocumentClassifier:\n    def __init__(self, file_handler):\n        self.sonnet_3_5_bedrock_utils = BedrockUtils(\n            model_id=ModelIDs.anthropic_claude_3_5_sonnet\n        )\n        \n    def categorize_document(self, file_paths):\n        # Convert documents to binary format for model processing\n        binary_data_array = []\n        for file_path in file_paths:\n            binary_data, media_type = self.file_handler.get_binary_for_file(file_path)\n            binary_data_array.append((binary_data[0], media_type))\n\n        # Prepare message for classification\n        message_content = [\n            {\"image\": {\"format\": media_type, \"source\": {\"bytes\": data}}}\n            for data, media_type in binary_data_array\n        ]\n        \n        # Create classification request\n        message_list = [{\n            \"role\": 'user',\n            \"content\": [\n                *message_content,\n                {\"text\": \"What types of document is in this image?\"}\n            ]\n        }]\n        \n        # Define system message for classification\n        system_message = [{\n            \"text\": '''You are a medical document processing agent. \n                      Categorize images as: INTAKE_FORM, INSURANCE_CARD, or DOC_NOTES'''\n        }]\n        \n        # Get classification from model\n        response = self.sonnet_3_5_bedrock_utils.invoke_bedrock(\n            message_list=message_list,\n            system_message=system_message\n        )\n        return [response['output']['message']]\n</code></pre><p>Based on the classification results, the FM determines the next tool to be invoked. The tool‚Äôs description and input schema define exactly what information needs to be extracted. Following the previous example, let‚Äôs assume the next page to be processed is a consultation note. The workflow will invoke the <code>extract_consultation_notes</code> function. This function processes documents to extract detailed medical information. Like the classification process discussed earlier, it first converts the documents to binary format suitable for model processing. The key to accurate extraction lies in how the images and system message are combined:</p><pre><code>def extract_info(self, file_paths):\n    # Convert documents to binary data\n    # This will follow the same pattern to as in the classification function\n    message_content = [\n        {\"image\": {\"format\": media_type, \"source\": {\"bytes\": data}}}\n        for data, media_type in binary_data_array\n    ]\n\n    message_list = [{\n        \"role\": 'user',\n        \"content\": [\n            *message_content,  # Include the processed document images\n            {\"text\": '''Extract all information from this file\n                       If you find a visualization\n                           - Provide a detailed description in natural language\n                           - Use domain specific language for the description\n                    '''}\n        ]\n    }]\n    \n    system_message = [{\n        \"text\": '''You are a medical consultation agent with expertise in diagnosing and treating various health conditions.\n                   You have a deep understanding of human anatomy, physiology, and medical knowledge across different specialties.\n                   During the consultation, you review the patient's medical records, test results, and documentation provided.\n                   You analyze this information objectively and make associations between the data and potential diagnoses.\nAssociate a confidence score to each extracted information.

Although this is not an independent grading mechanism, the score is directionally indicative of how confident the model is in its own extraction.</li></ul><p>Following the same pattern, the FM will use the other tools in the  definition to save and summarize the results.</p><p>A unique advantage of using a multi-modal FM for the extraction task is its ability to have a deep understanding of the text it is extracting. For example, the following code is an abstract of the data schema we are requesting as input to the  function. Refer to the code in <a href=\"https://github.com/aws-samples/anthropic-on-aws/blob/main/medical-idp/utils/constants.py#L133\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">constants.py</a> for full definition. The model needs to not only extract a transcript, but also understand it to extract such structured data from an unstructured document. This significantly reduces the postprocessing efforts required for the data to be consumed by a downstream application.</p><pre><code>\"consultation\": {\n                            \"type\": \"object\",\n                            \"properties\": {\n                            \"date\": {\"type\": \"string\"},\n                            \"concern\": {\n                                \"type\": \"object\",\n                                \"properties\": {\n                                    \"primaryComplaint\": {\n                                        \"type\": \"string\",\n                                        \"description\": \"Primary medical complaint of the patient.

Although the current implementation performs basic consistency checks through the <a href=\"https://github.com/aws-samples/anthropic-on-aws/blob/main/medical-idp/utils/constants.py#L35\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">summary prompt</a>, organizations can extend the framework by implementing a dedicated validation tool that integrates with their specific business rules and compliance requirements. Such a tool could perform sophisticated validation logic like insurance policy verification, appointment date consistency checks, or any other domain-specific validation requirements, providing complete data integrity across the document package.</p><p>As Amazon Bedrock continues to evolve, several powerful features can be integrated into this document processing workflow to enhance its enterprise readiness, performance, and cost-efficiency. Let‚Äôs explore how these advanced capabilities can take this solution to the next level:</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/inference-profiles.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Inference profiles</a> in Amazon Bedrock define a model and its associated Regions for routing invocation requests, enabling various tasks such as usage tracking, cost monitoring, and cross-Region inference. These profiles help users track metrics through <a href=\"http://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Amazon CloudWatch</a> logs, monitor costs with cost allocation tags, and increase throughput by distributing requests across multiple Regions.</li><li><a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/prompt-caching.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Prompt caching</a> can help when you have workloads with long and repeated contexts that are frequently reused for multiple queries. Instead of reprocessing the entire context for each document, the workflow can reuse cached prompts, which is particularly beneficial when using the same image across different tooling workflows. With support for multiple cache checkpoints, this feature can substantially reduce processing time and inference costs while maintaining the workflow‚Äôs intelligent orchestration capabilities.</li><li><a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/prompt-routing.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Intelligent prompt routing</a> can dynamically select the most appropriate model for each task based on performance and cost requirements. Rather than explicitly assigning Anthropic‚Äôs Claude 3 Haiku for orchestration and Anthropic‚Äôs Claude 3.5 Sonnet for document analysis, the workflow can use intelligent routing to automatically choose the optimal model within the Anthropic family for each request. This approach simplifies model management while providing cost-effective processing of different document types, from simple structured forms to complex handwritten notes, all through a single endpoint.</li></ul><p>This intelligent document processing solution demonstrates the power of combining Amazon Bedrock FMs with tool use capabilities to create sophisticated, self-orchestrating workflows. By using Anthropic‚Äôs Claude 3 Haiku for orchestration and Anthropic‚Äôs Claude 3.5 Sonnet for complex visual tasks, the solution effectively handles structured, semi-structured, and unstructured documents while maintaining high accuracy and compliance standards.</p><p>Key benefits of this approach include:</p><ul><li>Reduced manual processing through intelligent automation</li><li>Improved accuracy through specialized model selection</li><li>Built-in compliance with guardrails for sensitive data</li><li>Flexible architecture that adapts to various document types</li><li>Cost-effective processing through strategic model usage</li></ul><p>As organizations continue to digitize their operations, solutions like this showcase how generative AI can transform traditional document processing workflows.

While these models are trained on vast amounts of generic data, they often lack the organization-specific context and up-to-date information needed for accurate responses in business settings. Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques help address this by grounding LLMs in relevant data during inference, but these models can still generate non-deterministic outputs and occasionally fabricate information even when given accurate source material. For organizations deploying LLMs in production applications‚Äîparticularly in critical domains such as healthcare, finance, or legal services‚Äîthese residual hallucinations pose serious risks, potentially leading to misinformation, liability issues, and loss of user trust.</p><p>To address these challenges, we introduce a practical solution that combines the flexibility of LLMs with the reliability of drafted, curated, verified answers. Our solution uses two key <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Amazon Bedrock</a> services: <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/knowledge-bases/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases</a>, a fully managed service that you can use to store, search, and retrieve organization-specific information for use with LLMs; and <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/agents/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Amazon Bedrock Agents</a>, a fully managed service that you can use to build, test, and deploy AI assistants that can understand user requests, break them down into steps, and execute actions. Similar to how a customer service team maintains a bank of carefully crafted answers to frequently asked questions (FAQs), our solution first checks if a user‚Äôs question matches curated and verified responses before letting the LLM generate a new answer. This approach helps prevent hallucinations by using trusted information whenever possible, while still allowing the LLM to handle new or unique questions. By implementing this technique, organizations can improve response accuracy, reduce response times, and lower costs.&nbsp;Whether you‚Äôre new to AI development or an experienced practitioner, this post provides step-by-step guidance and code examples to help you build more reliable AI applications.</p><p>Our solution implements a verified semantic cache using the <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/APIReference/API_agent-runtime_Retrieve.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases Retrieve API</a> to reduce hallucinations in LLM responses while simultaneously improving latency and reducing costs. This read-only semantic cache acts as an intelligent intermediary layer between the user and Amazon Bedrock Agents, storing curated&nbsp;and&nbsp;verified question-answer pairs.</p><p>When a user submits a query, the solution first evaluates its semantic similarity with existing verified questions in the knowledge base. For highly similar queries (greater than 80% match), the&nbsp;solution bypasses the LLM completely and returns the curated&nbsp;and&nbsp;verified answer directly. When partial matches (60‚Äì80% similarity) are found, the&nbsp;solution uses the verified answers as few-shot examples to guide the LLM‚Äôs response, significantly improving accuracy and consistency. For queries with low similarity (less than 60%) or no match, the&nbsp;solution falls back to standard LLM processing, making sure that user questions receive appropriate responses.</p><p>This approach offers several key benefits:</p><ul><li> By minimizing unnecessary LLM invocations for frequently answered questions, the solution significantly reduces operational costs at scale</li><li> Curated and verified answers minimize the possibility of hallucinations for known user queries, while few-shot prompting enhances accuracy for similar questions.</li><li> Direct retrieval of cached answers provides near-instantaneous responses for known queries, improving the overall user experience.</li></ul><p>The semantic cache serves as a growing repository of trusted responses, continuously improving the&nbsp;solution‚Äôs reliability while maintaining efficiency in handling user queries.</p><p>The solution architecture in the preceding figure consists of the following components and workflow. Let‚Äôs assume that the question ‚ÄúWhat date will AWS re:invent 2024 occur?‚Äù is within the verified semantic cache. The corresponding answer is also input as ‚ÄúAWS re:Invent 2024 takes place on December 2‚Äì6, 2024.‚Äù Let‚Äôs walkthrough an example of how this solution would handle a user‚Äôs question.</p><p>a. User submits a question ‚ÄúWhen is re:Invent happening this year?‚Äù, which is received by the Invoke Agent function.</p><p>b. The function checks the semantic cache (Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases) using the Retrieve API.</p><p>c. Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases performs a semantic search and finds a similar question with an 85% similarity score.</p><p>2. Response paths: (Based on the 85% similarity score in , our solution follows the strong match path)</p><p>a. Strong match (similarity score greater than 80%):</p><p>i. Invoke Agent function returns exactly the verified answer ‚ÄúAWS re:Invent 2024 takes place on December 2‚Äì6, 2024‚Äù directly from the Amazon Bedrock knowledge base, providing a deterministic response.</p><p>ii. No LLM invocation needed, response in less than 1 second.</p><p>b. Partial match (similarity score 60‚Äì80%):</p><p>i. The Invoke Agent function invokes the Amazon Bedrock agent and provides the cached answer as a few-shot example for the agent through Amazon Bedrock Agents <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/agents-session-state.html#prompt-session-attribute-ex\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">promptSessionAttributes</a>.</p><p>ii. If the question was ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the schedule for AWS events in December?‚Äù, our solution would provide the verified re:Invent dates to guide the Amazon Bedrock agent‚Äôs response with additional context.</p><p>iii. Providing the Amazon Bedrock agent with a curated and verified example might help increase accuracy.</p><p>c. No match (similarity score less than 60%):</p><p>i. If the user‚Äôs question isn‚Äôt similar to any of the curated and verified questions in the cache, the Invoke Agent function invokes the Amazon Bedrock agent without providing it any additional context from cache.</p><p>ii. For example, if the question was ‚ÄúWhat hotels are near re:Invent?‚Äù, our solution would invoke the Amazon Bedrock agent directly, and the agent would use the tools at its disposal to formulate a response.</p><p>3. Offline knowledge management:</p><p>a. Verified question-answer pairs are stored in a verified Q&amp;A Amazon S3 bucket (<a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/s3/\">Amazon Simple Storage Service</a>), and must be updated or reviewed periodically to make sure that the cache contains the most recent and accurate information.</p><p>b. The S3 bucket is periodically synchronized with the Amazon Bedrock knowledge base. This offline batch process makes sure that the semantic cache remains up-to-date without impacting real-time operations.</p><p>You need to meet the following prerequisites for the walkthrough:</p><p>Once you have the prerequisites in place, use the following steps to set up the solution in your AWS account.</p><h3>Step 0: Set up the necessary infrastructure</h3><p>Follow the instructions in the <a href=\"https://github.com/aws-samples/Reducing-Hallucinations-in-LLM-Agents-with-a-Verified-Semantic-Cache/blob/main/README.md\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">README</a> of the <a href=\"https://github.com/aws-samples/Reducing-Hallucinations-in-LLM-Agents-with-a-Verified-Semantic-Cache/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Git repository</a> to set up the infrastructure for this solution.

This setup uses the <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-python/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">AWS SDK for Python (Boto3)</a> to interact with AWS services.</p><div><div><pre><code>agent_knowledge_base = BedrockKnowledgeBase(\n    kb_name=agent_knowledge_base_name,\n    kb_description=\"Knowledge base used by Bedrock Agent\",\n    data_bucket_name=agent_bucket_name,\n    chunking_strategy=\"FIXED_SIZE\",\n    suffix=f'{agent_unique_id}-f'\n)\n\ncache_knowledge_base = BedrockKnowledgeBase(\n    kb_name=cache_knowledge_base_name,\n    kb_description=\"Verified cache for Bedrock Agent System\",\n    data_bucket_name=cache_bucket_name,\n    chunking_strategy=\"NONE\",  # We do not want to chunk our question-answer pairs\n    suffix=f'{cache_unique_id}-f'\n)</code></pre></div></div><p>This establishes the foundation for your semantic caching solution, setting up the AWS resources to store the agent‚Äôs knowledge and verified cache entries.</p><h3>Step 2: Populate the agent knowledge base and associate it with an Amazon Bedrock agent</h3><p>For this walkthrough, you will create an LLM Amazon Bedrock agent specialized in answering questions about Amazon Bedrock. For this example, you will ingest Amazon Bedrock documentation in the form of the User Guide PDF into the Amazon Bedrock knowledge base. This will be the primary dataset. After ingesting the data, you create an agent with specific instructions:</p><div><pre><code>agent_instruction = \"\"\"You are the Amazon Bedrock Agent. You have access to a \nknowledge base with information about the Amazon Bedrock service on AWS. \nUse it to answer questions.\"\"\"\n\nagent_id = agents_handler.create_agent(\n    agent_name,\n    agent_description,\n    agent_instruction,\n    [agent_foundation_model],\n    kb_arns=[agent_kb_arn] # Associate agent with our Agent knowledge base\n)</code></pre></div><p>This setup enables the Amazon Bedrock agent to use the ingested knowledge to provide responses about Amazon Bedrock services. To test it, you can ask a question that isn‚Äôt present in the agent‚Äôs knowledge base, making the LLM either refuse to answer or hallucinate.</p><div><pre><code>invoke_agent(\"What are the dates for reinvent 2024?\", session_id=\"test\")\n# Response: Unfortunately, the dates for the AWS re:Invent 2024 conference have not \n# been announced yet by Amazon. The re:Invent conference is typically held in late \n# November or early December each year, but the specific dates for 2024 are not \n# available at this time. AWS usually announces the dates for their upcoming \n# re:Invent event around 6-9 months in advance.</code></pre></div><h3>Step 3: Create a cache dataset with known question-answer pairs and populate the cache knowledge base</h3><p>In this step, you create a raw dataset of verified question-answer pairs that aren‚Äôt present in the agent knowledge base. These curated&nbsp;and&nbsp;verified answers serve as our semantic cache to prevent hallucinations on known topics. Good candidates for inclusion in this cache are:</p><ol><li><strong>Frequently asked questions (FAQs):</strong>&nbsp;Common queries that users often ask, which can be answered consistently and accurately.</li><li><strong>Critical questions requiring deterministic answers:</strong>&nbsp;Topics where precision is crucial, such as pricing information, service limits, or compliance details.</li><li><strong>Time-sensitive information:</strong>&nbsp;Recent updates, announcements, or temporary changes that might not be reflected in the main RAG knowledge base.</li></ol><p>By carefully curating this cache with high-quality, verified answers to such questions, you can significantly improve the accuracy and reliability of your&nbsp;solution‚Äôs responses. For this walkthrough, use the following example pairs for the cache:</p><p><code>Q:&nbsp;'What are the dates for reinvent 2024?'</code><code>A: 'The AWS re:Invent conference was held from December 2-6 in 2024.'</code></p><p><code>Q:&nbsp;'What was the biggest new feature announcement for Bedrock Agents during reinvent 2024?'</code><code>A:&nbsp;'During re:Invent 2024, one of the headline new feature announcements for Bedrock Agents was the custom orchestrator. This key feature allows users to implement their own orchestration strategies through AWS Lambda functions, providing granular control over task planning, completion, and verification while enabling real-time adjustments and reusability across multiple agents.'</code></p><p>You then format these pairs as individual text files with corresponding <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/kb-metadata.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">metadata JSON files</a>, upload them to an S3 bucket, and ingest them into your cache knowledge base. This process makes sure that your semantic cache is populated with accurate, curated, and verified information that can be quickly retrieved to answer user queries or guide the agent‚Äôs responses.</p><h3>Step 4: Implement the verified semantic cache logic</h3><p>In this step, you implement the core logic of your verified semantic cache solution. You create a function that integrates the semantic cache with your Amazon Bedrock agent, enhancing its ability to provide accurate and consistent responses.</p><ol><li>Queries the cache knowledge base for similar entries to the user question.</li><li>If a high similarity match is found (greater than 80%), it returns the cached answer directly.</li><li>For partial matches (60‚Äì80%), it uses the cached answer as a few-shot example for the agent.</li><li>For low similarity (less than 60%), it falls back to standard agent processing.</li></ol><p>This simplified logic forms the core of the semantic caching solution, efficiently using curated&nbsp;and&nbsp;verified information to improve response accuracy and reduce unnecessary LLM invocations.</p><h3>Step 5: Evaluate results and performance</h3><p>This step demonstrates the effectiveness of the verified semantic cache&nbsp;solution by testing it with different scenarios and comparing the results and latency. You‚Äôll use three test cases to showcase the&nbsp;solution‚Äôs behavior:</p><ol><li>Strong semantic match (greater than 80% similarity)</li><li>Partial semantic match (60-80% similarity)</li><li>No semantic match (less than 60% similarity)</li></ol><ol><li>Strong semantic match (greater than 80% similarity) provides the exact curated and verified answer in less than 1 second. \n  <div><pre><code>%%time\ninvoke_agent_with_verified_cache(\"What were some new features announced for Bedrock Agents during reinvent 2024?\")\n\n# Output:\n# Cache semantic similarity log: Strong match with score 0.9176399\n# CPU times: user 20.7 ms, sys: 442 Œºs, total: 21.1 ms\n# Wall time: 440 ms\n\n# During re:Invent 2024, one of the headline new feature announcements for Bedrock \n# Agents was the custom orchestrator.

The Amazon Bedrock agent answers the question correctly using the cached answer even though the information is not present in the agent knowledge base. \n  <div><pre><code>%%time\ninvoke_agent_with_verified_cache(\"What are the newest features for Bedrock Agents?\") \n\n# Output:\n# Cache semantic similarity log: Partial match with score 0.6443664\n# CPU times: user 10.4 ms, sys: 0 ns, total: 10.4 ms\n# Wall time: 12.8 s\n\n# One of the newest and most significant features for Amazon Bedrock Agents \n# announced during re:Invent 2024 was the custom orchestrator.

For this query, the LLM will either refuse to provide the information because it‚Äôs not present in the agent‚Äôs knowledge base, or will hallucinate and provide a response that is plausible but incorrect. \n  <div><pre><code>%%time\ninvoke_agent_with_verified_cache(\"Tell me about a new feature for Amazon Bedrock Agents\")\n\n# Output:\n# Cache semantic similarity log: No match with score 0.532105\n# CPU times: user 22.3 ms, sys: 579 Œºs, total: 22.9 ms\n# Wall time: 13.6 s\n\n# Amazon Bedrock is a service that provides secure and scalable compute capacity \n# for running applications on AWS.

Without \n# being able to consult the Knowledge Base, I cannot provide details on any \n# particular new Bedrock Agent features at this time.</code></pre></div></li></ol><p>These results demonstrate the effectiveness of the semantic caching solution:</p><ol><li>Strong matches provide near-instant, accurate, and deterministic responses without invoking an LLM.</li><li>Partial matches guide the LLM agent to provide a more relevant or accurate answer.</li><li>No matches fall back to standard LLM agent processing, maintaining flexibility.</li></ol><p>The semantic cache significantly reduces latency for known questions and improves accuracy for similar queries, while still allowing the agent to handle unique questions when necessary.</p><h3>Step 6: Resource clean up</h3><p>Make sure that the Amazon Bedrock knowledge bases that you created, along with the underlying Amazon OpenSearch Serverless collections are deleted to avoid incurring unnecessary costs.</p><h2>Production readiness considerations</h2><p>Before deploying this&nbsp;solution in production, address these key considerations:</p><ol><li><strong>Similarity threshold optimization:</strong>&nbsp;Experiment with different thresholds to balance cache hit rates and accuracy. This directly impacts the solution‚Äôs effectiveness in preventing hallucinations while maintaining relevance.</li><li><strong>Feedback loop implementation:</strong>&nbsp;Create a mechanism to continuously update the verified cache with new, accurate responses. This helps prevent cache staleness and maintains the solution‚Äôs integrity as a source of truth for the LLM.</li><li><strong>Cache management and update strategy:</strong>&nbsp;Regularly refresh the semantic cache with current, frequently asked questions to maintain relevance and improve hit rates. Implement a systematic process for reviewing, validating, and incorporating new entries to help ensure cache quality and alignment with evolving user needs.</li><li>&nbsp;Adjust similarity thresholds as your dataset evolves. Treat the semantic cache as a dynamic component, requiring continuous optimization for your specific use case.</li></ol><p>This verified semantic cache approach offers a powerful solution to reduce hallucinations in LLM responses while improving latency and reducing costs. By using Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases, you can implement a&nbsp;solution that can efficiently serve curated&nbsp;and&nbsp;verified answers, guide LLM responses with few-shot examples, and gracefully fall back to full LLM processing when needed.</p><p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/f1f836cb4ea6efb2a0b1b99f41ad8b103eff4b59/2025/02/12/dtoprani-author-photo.jpeg\" alt=\"Dheer Toprani (author photo)\" width=\"100\" height=\"150\"> is a System Development Engineer within the Amazon Worldwide Returns and ReCommerce Data Services team.

It is a continuous process to keep the fine-tuned model accurate and effective in changing environments, to adapt to the data distribution shift (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concept_drift\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">concept drift</a>) and prevent performance degradation over time. Continuous fine-tuning also enables models to integrate human feedback, address errors, and tailor to real-world applications. You can use <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/jumpstart-foundation-models-fine-tuning.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">supervised fine-tuning (SFT)</a> and <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.10792v5\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">instruction tuning</a> to train the LLM to perform better on specific tasks using human-annotated datasets and instructions.

The manual annotation of extensive training data for fine-tuning by human SMEs and collecting user feedback to align LLM responses with human preferences are both resource-heavy and time-intensive. Also, the continuous fine-tuning process requires orchestrating the multiple steps of data generation, LLM training, feedback collection, and preference alignments with scalability, resiliency, and resource efficiency. To address these challenges, we present an innovative continuous self-instruct fine-tuning framework that streamlines the LLM fine-tuning process of training data generation and annotation, model training and evaluation, human feedback collection, and alignment with human preference. This framework is designed as a <a href=\"https://bair.berkeley.edu/blog/2024/02/18/compound-ai-systems/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">compound AI system</a> to drive the fine-tuning workflow for performance improvement, versatility, and reusability.</p><p>In this post, we introduce the continuous self-instruct fine-tuning framework and its pipeline, and present how to drive the continuous fine-tuning process for a question-answer task as a compound AI system. We use <a href=\"https://dspy.ai/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">DSPy</a> (Declarative Self-improving Python) to demonstrate the workflow of <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/retrieval-augmented-generation/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Retrieval Augmented Generation</a> (RAG) optimization, LLM fine-tuning and evaluation, and human preference alignment for performance improvement.</p><h2>Overview of the continuous self-instruct fine-tuning framework</h2><p>The continuous self-instruct fine-tuning framework drives a workflow to customize the foundation model (FM) using human-labeled training samples and human feedback after model inference. This workflow runs on a continuous basis to be adaptive to a changing environment. The following diagram illustrates the workflow.</p><p>The workflow consists of the following steps:</p><ol><li><strong>Self-instruct supervised fine-tuning</strong> ‚Äì First, we use a human-labeled training dataset to adapt the FM to tasks in a specific domain. Instruction tuning is a popular approach in domain-specific LLM fine-tuning, which trains the FM to follow instructions for a specific task rather than generating the next texts. To address the challenges of the lack of human efforts for data labeling, annotation, and validation, we designed a self-instruct fine-tuning method to synthetically generate training labels by the LLM from a small volume of high-quality human-annotated samples. This process scales up the training dataset used for fine-tuning the FM into a custom LLM.</li><li><strong>Human preference alignment </strong>‚Äì After the model is deployed in the production environment, the process moves into the human-in-the-loop workflow, in which we collect user feedback including satisfaction scores and comments on model response. The human feedback data is not only used for model performance and hallucination measurement, but is also used to further fine-tune the custom model in Step 1 through RLHF. Likewise, to address the challenges of lack of human feedback data, we use LLMs to generate AI grades and feedback that scale up the dataset for reinforcement learning from AI feedback (<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.00267\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">RLAIF</a>). There are various techniques of preference alignment, including <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.06347\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">proximal policy optimization</a> (PPO), <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.18290\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">direct preference optimization</a> (DPO), <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/html/2403.07691v2\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">odds ratio policy optimization</a> (ORPO), <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.03300\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">group relative policy optimization</a> (GRPO), and other algorithms, that can be used in this process.</li><li><strong>Evaluation and continuous learning </strong>‚Äì The model customization and preference alignment is not a one-time effort. We need to keep monitoring and evaluating the model performance, and restart the process in case of concept shift or model decay.</li></ol><p>The overall workflow consists of multiple steps of synthetic data generation, LLM training, feedback collection, preference alignment, and evaluation that involves multiple components and multiple LLMs. In the next section, we discuss using a compound AI system to implement this framework to achieve high versatility and reusability.</p><h2>Compound AI system and the DSPy framework</h2><p>With the rise of generative AI, scientists and engineers face a much more complex scenario to develop and maintain AI solutions, compared to classic predictive AI. The paper <a href=\"https://bair.berkeley.edu/blog/2024/02/18/compound-ai-systems/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">The Shift from Models to Compound AI Systems</a> highlights that state-of-the-art AI results are increasingly obtained by compound systems with multiple components, not just monolithic models. Compound AI systems are systems that implement AI tasks by combining multiple interacting components. These components can include multiple calls to models, retrievers, or external tools. The following diagram compares predictive AI to generative AI.</p><p>The concept of a compound AI system enables data scientists and ML engineers to design sophisticated generative AI systems consisting of multiple models and components. You can use a module to incorporate prompt engineering and in-context learning to improve RAG performance, and also design a data architecture with tools to gather external data. You can also build an agentic architecture with multiple LLMs, fine-tune the model to achieve higher performance, and orchestrate the LLM access. Besides the efficiency in system design, the compound AI system also enables you to optimize complex generative AI systems, using a comprehensive evaluation module based on multiple metrics, benchmarking data, and even judgements from other LLMs. The optimization is on the holistic end-to-end solution, rather than on each component separately.</p><p>To efficiently build and optimize compound AI systems, we introduce DSPy, an open source Python framework for developers to build LLM applications using modular and declarative programming, whether you‚Äôre building simple classifiers, sophisticated RAG pipelines, or agentic workflows. It provides algorithms for optimizing LLMs‚Äô prompts and weights, and automates the prompt tuning process, as opposed to the trial-and-error approach performed by humans. DSPy supports iteratively optimizing all prompts involved against defined metrics for the end-to-end compound AI solution.</p><p>The DSPy lifecycle is presented in the following diagram in seven steps. It separates the flow of your program (modules) from the parameters (language model prompts and weights) of each step. These modules define the system behavior in a portable, declarative way. The first four steps cover the DSPy programming stage, including defining your task and its constraints, exploring a few examples, and using that to inform your initial pipeline design. When your system works reasonably well, you can run the DSPy evaluation stage (Steps 5 and 6) to collect an initial development set, define your DSPy metric, and use these to iterate on your system more systematically. Afterwards, DSPy introduces new optimizers (compilers) in Step 7, with language model-driven algorithms to tune LLM prompts and weights, based on predefined evaluation metrics.</p><h2>RAG pipeline with continuous fine-tuning in a compound AI system</h2><p>In this post, we provide an example of a question-answer task, using a RAG pipeline along with the continuous self-instruct fine-tuning framework. We build this as a compound AI system and use DSPy to drive the RAG inference, prompt optimization, LLM fine-tuning, and performance evaluation. The overall workflow is shown in the following diagram.</p><p>The flow starts from a standard RAG pipeline, followed by a few optimizations on the prompts and the RAG retriever. Then we generate the synthetic training dataset from the RAG knowledge base to fine-tune the generator LLM using RAG for performance improvement. Lastly, we use a separate LLM to generate feedback on the fine-tuned model responses, and use it to conduct the preference alignment training by DPO and PPO. The question-answer outputs from each step are measured by the underlying LLM-as-a-judge evaluation module. In this way, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the compound AI system for the continuous optimizing of the pipeline through RAG optimization and the fine-tuning framework.</p><p>In the next sections, we demonstrate how to build this workflow, including the RAG pipeline, optimization, instruction fine-tuning, preference alignment, and model evaluation, into a compound AI system using an <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Amazon SageMaker</a> notebook instance with the DSPy framework and LLMs on <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Amazon Bedrock</a>. The code from this post and more examples are available in the <a href=\"https://github.com/aws-samples/amlc-2024-tutorial-continuous-fine-tuning-compound-ai/tree/main\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">GitHub repository</a>.</p><p>To create and run this compound AI system in your AWS account, complete the following prerequisites:</p><p>For the question-answering task, we use the <a href=\"https://github.com/TheAtticusProject/cuad/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Contract Understanding Atticus Dataset (CUAD)</a>, an open legal contract review dataset created with dozens of legal experts from The Atticus Project, which consists of over 13,000 annotations.

The generated datasets are in the format of question-answer pairs along with the context <code>[context, question, answer]</code> from the document. We use the question to infer the RAG pipeline and use the answer as ground truth to evaluate the inference accuracy. Additionally, the question-answer pairs are used as training samples for the model fine-tuning.

DSPy provides the Optimizer module, an algorithm that can tune the parameters of a DSPy program (the prompts and language model weights) to maximize the metrics you specify. It takes in a training set to bootstrap the selective training examples, and is based on a metric function that measures proximity to or matches against the ground truth. With these, we can compile the RAG pipeline module with a defined optimizer instance to conduct the optimization.</p><p>In this post, we use DSPy Optimizer to learn how to generate the prompt to improve the RAG response accuracy. Because our dataset size is low (fewer than 100 examples), we select the <a href=\"https://dspy.ai/deep-dive/optimizers/bootstrap-fewshot/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">BootstrapFewShot</a> teleprompter to compile the RAG prompts and overall pipeline, and use the synthetic dataset with ground truth and the LLM-as-a-judge metric function we defined in the previous sections:</p><div><pre><code>def validate_context_and_answer(example, pred, trace=None):\n   answer_EM = dspy.evaluate.answer_exact_match(example, pred)\n   answer_PM = dspy.evaluate.answer_passage_match(example, pred)\n   answer_LLMJudge = factuality_metric(example, pred)\n   return answer_LLMJudge or answer_EM or answer_PM\n\nrag_lm = RAG()\nteleprompter = BootstrapFewShot(metric=validate_context_and_answer)\ncompiled_rag = teleprompter.compile(rag_lm, trainset=trainset)</code></pre></div><p>The context retrieval is crucial to the overall RAG accuracy. To evaluate the RAG optimization we‚Äôve described, we create a retriever evaluation by the LLM-as-a-judge to understand how well the retriever is able to pull out the relevant chunks for the incoming user question. The LLM judge is defined in the RetrievalJudge class:</p><div><pre><code>class RetrievalJudge(dspy.Signature):\n   \"\"\"Judge given the question to be answered, check if the groundtruth answer can be derived from the predicted context.&nbsp; Answer either Retrieved[True] or Retrieved[False]\"\"\"\n   context = dspy.InputField(desc=\"Context for the prediction\")\n   question = dspy.InputField(desc=\"Question to be answered\")\n   groundtruth_answer = dspy.InputField(desc=\"groundtruth answer for the question\")\n   retrieval_correctness = dspy.OutputField(desc=\"Can the groundtruth answer be derived from the predicted context?\", prefix=\"Retrieved[True/False]:\")\n\nretrieval_judge = dspy.ChainOfThought(RetrievalJudge)</code></pre></div><p>Then we define the metric to measure the retrieval by using the RetrievalJudge, and use the DSPy Evaluate module to generate the accuracy score for retrieval:</p><div><pre><code>def retrieval_metric(example, pred):\n   retrieval = retrieval_judge(question=example.question, groundtruth_answer=example.answer, context=pred.context)\n   llm_retriever_ans = bool(\"Retrieved[True]\" in retrieval.retrieval_correctness\n                            or '100% True' in retrieval.retrieval_correctness\n                            or '100% retrieved correct' in retrieval.retrieval_correctness\n                            or 'True.' in retrieval.retrieval_correctness)\n   return llm_retriever_ans\n\nrag_retrieval_score = Evaluate(compiled_rag, num_threads = 1, metric=retrieval_metric)</code></pre></div><h3>Configure the continuous fine-tuning framework</h3><p>After the RAG optimization, the compound AI system has the instruction tuning and preference alignment modules, driven by the continuous fine-tuning framework. This includes using the synthetically generated dataset to train the LLM to follow question-answer instructions by SFT, and generating feedback of RAG responses by AI (another LLM) used for RLAIF with PPO and preference alignment with DPO and ORPO. In this step, we use <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.16742\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Parameter Efficient Fine-Tuning</a> (PEFT) with <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.09685\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Low-Rank Adaptation</a> (LoRA) to reduce the requirement of compute resources and accelerate the training process.</p><p>At the time of writing, the DSPy Optimization module supports distillation of a prompt-based DSPy program into LLM weight updates using BootstrapFinetune, and does not yet support the fine-tuning methods we defined in the compound AI system. Therefore, we conducted the fine-tuning (instruction tuning and preference alignment) on a Meta Llama 3 8B model separately; refer to the following <a href=\"https://github.com/aws-samples/kdd-2024-domain-driven-llm-development\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">GitHub repository</a> for more details. With the compound AI system design, we are able to take the fine-tuning results back into the DSPy pipeline, use the LLM-as-a-judge evaluation function to generate the accuracy scores, and benchmark with the standard and optimized RAG inferences. This demonstrates the flexibility and interoperability of the compound AI system, which allows us to seamlessly replace one module with an external component without requiring changes to the entire pipeline.</p><p>The following diagram illustrates the workflow.</p><h3>Define an evaluation approach with DSPy</h3><p>DSPy provides an Evaluate module for evaluating the compound AI system output by using user-defined metrics. In this post, we use LLM-as-a-judge to evaluate the system output and create the corresponding metrics for benchmarking the accuracy of standard RAG, optimized RAG, and fine-tuned models. Complete the following steps:</p><ol><li>Load the dataset for evaluation in the Example data type. Examples are similar to Python dictionaries but with added utilities such as the dspy.Prediction as a return value. For example:</li></ol><div><pre><code>gt_answer = &lt;ground truth of the answer&gt;\npred_answer = &lt;answer from RAG and/or fine-tuned model&gt;\ndspy_data = dspy.Example(gt_answer=gt_answer, pred_answer=pred_answer).with_inputs(\"gt_answer\", \"pred_answer\")</code></pre></div><ol start=\"2\"><li>Define the LLM-as-a-judge class to adjudicate whether the predicted answer semantically matches the ground truth of the answer. For example, the following FactualityJudge_1 class provides a score between 0 and 1; 0 means a complete mismatch and 1 means a perfect match.</li></ol><div><pre><code>class FactualityJudge_1(dspy.Signature):\n   \"\"\"Judge if the predicted answer is semantically match the groundtruth answer. Provide a score between 0 and 1, 0 means completely mismatch and 1 means perfectly match. In the response, only present the score, DO NOT add any preambles.\"\"\"\n   groundtruth_answer = dspy.InputField(desc=\"groundtruth answer\")\n   predicted_answer = dspy.InputField(desc=\"predicted answer\")\n   factually_correct = dspy.OutputField(desc=\"Is the predicted answer factually correct and semantically similar to the groundtruth answer?\"))</code></pre></div><ol start=\"3\"><li>Define the evaluation metrics from the LLM judge, using DSPy metrics, to mark whether the predicted answer is true or not. For example, the following function returns the accuracy score based on the output of FactualityJudge_1:</li></ol><div><pre><code>factualityJudge_1 = dspy.ChainOfThought(FactualityJudge_1)\n\ndef factuality_metric_1(gt_answer, pred_answer):\n   pred_answer = gt_answer.pred_answer\n   gt_answer = gt_answer.gt_answer\n   factual_metrc = factualityJudge_1(groundtruth_answer=gt_answer, predicted_answer=pred_answer)\n   llm_judge_ans = float(factual_metrc[0].factually_correct)\n   print(f\"llm_judge_ans = {llm_judge_ans}\")\n   return llm_judge_ans\n\nmetric_LLM_1 = factuality_metric_1</code></pre></div><ol start=\"4\"><li>Use the  module to generate an accuracy score using the LLM-as-a-judge metrics defined in the previous step:</li></ol><div><pre><code>evaluate_llm_judge = Evaluate(devset= dspy_data, metric=metric_LLM_1, num_threads=1)</code></pre></div><p>This evaluation process should be conducted on a continuous basis in the compound AI system driven by self-instruct fine-tuning, to make sure the overall performance remains stable despite the changes in the environment or the introduction of new data.</p><h3>Benchmark RAG and LLM fine-tuning with DSPy</h3><p>We benchmark the approaches presented in this post using the <a href=\"https://github.com/aws-samples/amlc-2024-tutorial-continuous-fine-tuning-compound-ai/blob/main/notebook/dspy_rag_ft.ipynb\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">LLM-as-a-judge evaluation</a> function defined in the previous section with the following settings.</p><p>The benchmarking is across five methods: standard RAG, optimized RAG, fine-tuning LLMs by instruction tuning, and fine-tuning LLMs by DPO and ORPO trained LLMs based on AIF. For each method, the LLM judge provides a decimal accuracy score in the range of 0 and 1.</p><p>The standard RAG uses Amazon Titan Text Embedding V2 for the embedding model, and Anthropic‚Äôs Claude 3 Haiku model for the generator model. The RAG compilation uses 32 question-answer pairs to optimize the prompts. The same dataset is used for inference. The fine-tuning by SFT, DPO, and ORPO are performed on the Meta Llama 3 8B FM, using training samples synthetically generated from CUAD document.</p><p>The results are presented in the following tables and charts. The different methods demonstrate different levels of improvement. The improvement is calculated in percentage by (accuracy of new method ‚Äì accuracy of standard RAG)/(accuracy of standard RAG)*100%.</p><p>The optimized RAG by DSPy improved the accuracy and reduced the hallucination.</p><table border=\"1px\" width=\"696\" cellpadding=\"10px\"><tbody><tr><td width=\"162\"></td><td width=\"210\"></td></tr><tr><td width=\"162\">Accuracy by LLM Judge (0-1)</td></tr></tbody></table><table border=\"1\" width=\"696\" cellpadding=\"10px\"><tbody><tr><td width=\"162\"></td><td width=\"210\"></td></tr><tr><td width=\"162\">Accuracy by LLM Judge (0-1)</td></tr></tbody></table><p>The custom LLM trained by SFT yielded higher accuracy than the standard RAG.</p><table border=\"1\" width=\"696\" cellpadding=\"10\"><tbody><tr><td width=\"162\"></td><td width=\"192\"></td></tr><tr><td width=\"162\">Accuracy by LLM Judge (0-1)</td></tr></tbody></table><table border=\"1\" width=\"696\" cellpadding=\"10\"><tbody><tr><td width=\"162\"></td><td width=\"192\"></td></tr><tr><td width=\"162\">Accuracy by LLM Judge (0-1)</td></tr></tbody></table><p>The custom LLM through preference alignment from human and AI feedback (DPO and ORPO) further improved the model performance.

While OpenAI‚Äôs GPT models are widely used, many developers want to understand how these models work and even train their own versions from scratch. In this in-depth guide, we will explore how to build a lightweight LLM using Python, train it on Hacker News data, optimize its performance, and deploy it for real-world usage.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  What is a Language Model?\n</h3><p>A Language Model (LM) is a type of artificial intelligence model that predicts the likelihood of a sequence of words in a given language. It learns patterns, grammar, and context from a large corpus of text data, enabling it to generate coherent and contextually relevant text. For example, given the phrase \"I love to code in,\" an LM might predict \"Python\" as the next word, based on patterns observed in its training data.</p><p>LMs are used in various applications, including:</p><ul><li>Text generation: Creating articles, stories, or dialogues.</li><li>Machine translation: Translating text from one language to another.</li><li>Text classification: Sentiment analysis or spam detection.</li><li>Autocomplete: Suggesting words or phrases in search engines or text editors.</li><li>In this article, we'll focus on building a simple autoregressive LM that predicts the next word in a sequence, trained specifically on HackerNews data.</li></ul><ul><li>Understanding how LLMs work</li><li>Collecting and preprocessing Hacker News data</li><li>Tokenizing text and creating structured datasets</li><li>Training a transformer-based model using PyTorch and Hugging Face Transformers</li><li>Fine-tuning and optimizing for better performance</li><li>Evaluating model performance using loss metrics and perplexity</li><li>Deploying the model with FastAPI and making it accessible via an API</li><li>Improving the model with reinforcement learning and knowledge distillation</li><li>Scaling the model with distributed training</li><li>Reducing computational costs through quantization and pruning</li><li>Enhancing model security with adversarial training</li></ul><p>Before we start, install the necessary dependencies:</p><div><pre><code>pip torch transformers datasets tokenizers accelerate fastapi uvicorn matplotlib deepspeed bitsandbytes\n</code></pre></div><ul><li> for deep learning computations</li><li> for leveraging pre-built architectures like GPT-2</li><li> for handling large text corpora efficiently</li><li> for high-speed text processing</li><li> and  for deploying the model as an API</li><li> for visualizing loss curves and performance metrics</li><li> for optimizing large-scale model training</li><li> for quantization to reduce memory footprint</li></ul><h2>\n  \n  \n  Step 1: Understanding Large Language Models\n</h2><p>Before diving into code, it's essential to grasp how LLMs function. At their core, these models are neural networks trained to predict the next word in a sequence given an input context. They use:</p><ul><li> to break text into numerical representations</li><li><strong>Transformer architectures</strong> (such as GPT-2) with attention mechanisms to understand long-range dependencies</li><li> to train on vast amounts of unstructured text data</li><li> to adapt to specific tasks, such as chatbots or code generation</li></ul><h2>\n  \n  \n  Step 2: Collecting Hacker News Data\n</h2><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><h2>\n  \n  \n  Step 3: Preprocessing and Tokenization\n</h2><p>Data cleaning ensures better training results. We remove HTML tags, non-text characters, and normalize text.</p><blockquote><p>Tokenization is the process of breaking down text into smaller units, called tokens, which can be words, subwords or even characters. This step is critical to transforming text into a numerical representation that deep learning models can understand and process.</p></blockquote><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><h2>\n  \n  \n  Step 4: Creating a Dataset and DataLoader\n</h2><p>We format our text for training using PyTorch‚Äôs  class.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><h2>\n  \n  \n  Step 5: Training the Transformer Model\n</h2><p>We fine-tune a pre-trained GPT-2 model on our dataset.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><h2>\n  \n  \n  Step 6: Model Optimization\n</h2><p>Model optimization focuses on improving the efficiency of a trained model by reducing its memory usage and increasing its inference speed. Two key techniques used for optimization are:</p><p>Quantization reduces the precision of model parameters (e.g., converting 32-bit floating point numbers to 8-bit integers). This helps decrease memory consumption and speeds up inference, especially on resource-limited devices.\nIn the code, we achieve this using <code>BitsAndBytesConfig(load_in_8bit=True)</code>, which loads the GPT-2 model in an 8-bit format, reducing its size and computational requirements.</p><p>Pruning removes unnecessary parameters from the model, reducing the number of computations required during inference. While pruning is not explicitly implemented in the code, it can be done by eliminating less significant weights from the neural network.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><h2>\n  \n  \n  Step 7: Deploying as an API\n</h2><p>We use FastAPI to make our model accessible.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>We have successfully built, trained, optimized, and deployed a custom LLM using Hacker News data.

For a list of supported connectors, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonq/latest/qbusiness-ug/connectors-list.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Supported connectors</a>.</p><p>Amazon Q boasts impressive versatility, supporting a wide range of <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonq/latest/qbusiness-ug/doc-types.html#doc-types-supported\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">document types</a> stored at various places in your environment, including Windows Share (FSX for Windows File Server). Amazon Q can ingest and understand common formats like plaintext, PDF, HTML, XML, and JSON to Microsoft formats like Excel, Word, and PowerPoint. This provides a comprehensive search experience for your enterprise users.</p><h3>Secure access with supported authentication types</h3><p>Security is job zero at AWS, and Amazon Q has been built keeping that in mind. It supports a variety of authentication types, seamlessly integrating with your existing identity management systems. Whether you use single sign-on (SSO) or a custom authentication solution, Amazon Q can adapt to your specific needs.</p><h3>Fine-grained control with ACLs and identity crawling</h3><p>For organizations with highly sensitive data, Amazon Q offers an extra layer of security. Amazon Q Business supports crawling <a href=\"https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Access-control_list\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">access control lists (ACLs)</a> for document security by default. When you connect an Amazon FSx (Windows) data source to Amazon Q Business, it crawls ACL information attached to a document (user and group information) from the directory service of the Amazon FSx instance.</p><p>The following diagram shows a high-level architecture of how <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/directoryservice/latest/admin-guide/directory_microsoft_ad.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">AWS Managed Active Directory</a> users, through <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/iam/identity-center/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">AWS IAM Identity Center</a>, can access and interact with an Amazon Q Business application. This enables an authenticated user to securely and privately interact with the application and gain insights from the enterprise data stored in FSx for Windows File Server, using the Amazon Q Business web experience from their web browser.</p><p>In this post, we walk you through the process of integrating Amazon Q Business with FSx for Windows File Server to extract meaningful insights from your file system using natural language processing (NLP).

These two keywords are closely related to defer. They are both built-in functions in the Go language and provide complementary functions.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  I. Basic Functions of panic and recover\n</h2><ul><li>: It can change the control flow of the program. After calling panic, the remaining code of the current function will be immediately stopped from execution, and the defer of the caller will be recursively executed in the current Goroutine.</li><li>: It can stop the program crash caused by panic. It is a function that can only take effect in defer. Calling it in other scopes will not have any effect.</li></ul><h2>\n  \n  \n  II. Phenomena When Using panic and recover\n</h2><h3>\n  \n  \n  (I) panic Only Triggers the defer of the Current Goroutine\n</h3><p>The following code demonstrates this phenomenon:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>The running result is as follows:</p><div><pre><code>$ go run main.go\nin goroutine\npanic:\n...\n</code></pre></div><p>When running this code, it will be found that the defer statement in the main function is not executed, and only the defer in the current Goroutine is executed. Because the runtime.deferproc corresponding to the defer keyword will associate the deferred call function with the Goroutine where the caller is located, so when the program crashes, only the deferred call function of the current Goroutine will be called.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  (II) recover Only Takes Effect When Called in defer\n</h3><p>The following code reflects this feature:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><div><pre><code>$ go run main.go\nin main\npanic: unknown err\ngoroutine 1 [running]:\nmain.main()\n ...\nexit status 2\n</code></pre></div><p>By carefully analyzing this process, it can be known that recover will only take effect when called after a panic occurs. However, in the above control flow, recover is called before panic, which does not meet the conditions for taking effect. Therefore, the recover keyword needs to be used in defer.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  (III) panic Allows Multiple Nested Calls in defer\n</h3><p>The following code shows how to call panic multiple times in a defer function:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>The running result is as follows:</p><div><pre><code>$ go run main.go\nin main\npanic: panic once\n  panic: panic again\n  panic: panic again and again\ngoroutine 1 [running]:\n...\nexit status 2\n</code></pre></div><p>From the output result of the above program, it can be determined that multiple calls to panic in the program will not affect the normal execution of the defer function. Therefore, it is generally safe to use defer for the finalization work.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  III. Data Structure of panic\n</h2><p>The panic keyword in the source code of the Go language is represented by the data structure runtime._panic. Every time panic is called, a data structure like the following will be created to store relevant information:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><ul><li>: It is a pointer to the parameter when defer is called.</li><li>: It is the parameter passed in when panic is called.</li><li>: It points to the earlier called runtime._panic structure.</li><li>: It indicates whether the current runtime._panic has been recovered by recover.</li><li>: It indicates whether the current panic has been forcibly terminated.</li></ul><p>From the link field in the data structure, it can be inferred that the panic function can be called continuously multiple times, and they can form a linked list through the link.</p><p>The three fields pc, sp, and goexit in the structure are all introduced to fix the problems brought by runtime.Goexit. runtime.Goexit can only end the Goroutine that calls this function without affecting other Goroutines. However, this function will be cancelled by the panic and recover in defer. The introduction of these three fields is to ensure that this function will definitely take effect.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  IV. Principle of Program Crash\n</h2><p>The compiler will convert the keyword panic into runtime.gopanic. The execution process of this function includes the following steps:</p><ol><li>Create a new runtime._panic and add it to the front of the _panic linked list of the Goroutine where it is located.</li><li>Continuously obtain runtime._defer from the _defer linked list of the current Goroutine in a loop and call runtime.reflectcall to run the deferred call function.</li><li>Call runtime.fatalpanic to abort the entire program.\n</li></ol><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>It should be noted that three relatively important parts of code are omitted in the above function:</p><ol><li>The code in the recover branch for restoring the program.</li><li>The code for optimizing the performance of the defer call through inlining.</li><li>The code for fixing the abnormal situation of runtime.Goexit.</li></ol><p>In version 1.14, the Go language solved the conflict between recursive panic and recover and runtime.Goexit through the submission of runtime: ensure that Goexit cannot be aborted by a recursive panic/recover.</p><p>runtime.fatalpanic implements a program crash that cannot be recovered. Before aborting the program, it will print out all the panic messages and the parameters passed in during the call through runtime.printpanics:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>After printing the crash message, it will call runtime.exit to exit the current program and return the error code 2. The normal exit of the program is also implemented through runtime.exit.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  V. Principle of Crash Recovery\n</h2><p>The compiler will convert the keyword recover into runtime.gorecover:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>The implementation of this function is very simple. If the current Goroutine has not called panic, then this function will directly return nil, which is also the reason why the crash recovery will fail when called in a non-defer. Under normal circumstances, it will modify the recovered field of runtime._panic, and the recovery of the program is handled by the runtime.gopanic function:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>The above code omits the inlining optimization of defer. It takes out the program counter pc and stack pointer sp from runtime._defer and calls the runtime.recovery function to trigger the scheduling of the Goroutine. Before the scheduling, it will prepare the sp, pc, and the return value of the function:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>When the defer keyword is called, the stack pointer sp and program counter pc at the time of the call have already been stored in the runtime._defer structure. The runtime.gogo function here will jump back to the position where the defer keyword was called.</p><p>runtime.recovery will set the return value of the function to 1 during the scheduling process. From the comments of runtime.deferproc, it can be found that when the return value of the runtime.deferproc function is 1, the code generated by the compiler will directly jump to before the return of the caller function and execute runtime.deferreturn:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>After jumping to the runtime.deferreturn function, the program has been recovered from the panic and executes the normal logic, and the runtime.gorecover function can also take out the arg parameter passed in when calling panic from the runtime._panic structure and return it to the caller.</p><p>Analyzing the crash and recovery process of the program is rather tricky, and the code is not particularly easy to understand. Here is a simple summary of the program crash and recovery process:</p><ol><li>The compiler is responsible for the work of converting keywords. It converts panic and recover into runtime.gopanic and runtime.gorecover respectively, converts defer into the runtime.deferproc function, and calls the runtime.deferreturn function at the end of the function that calls defer.</li><li>When encountering the runtime.gopanic method during the running process, it will successively take out the runtime._defer structure from the linked list of the Goroutine and execute it.</li><li>If runtime.gorecover is encountered when calling the deferred execution function, it will mark _panic.recovered as true and return the parameter of the panic.</li><li>After this call ends, runtime.gopanic will take out the program counter pc and stack pointer sp from the runtime._defer structure and call the runtime.recovery function to restore the program.</li><li>runtime.recovery will jump back to runtime.deferproc according to the passed-in pc and sp.</li><li>The code automatically generated by the compiler will find that the return value of runtime.deferproc is not 0.

Keep in mind, this is focused on Google‚Äôs cloud infrastructure and doesn‚Äôt cover software architecture.</p><p>The training and exam for this certificate are all online (though on-site exams are available) which makes it very flexible. Plus, it‚Äôs pretty cheap (although it‚Äôs the most expensive of the provider-specific options). However, if you go through all the training, it‚Äôs going to take you some time, as it‚Äôs the longest provider-specific course here.</p><p>: Cloud Architects, Solutions Architects, IT Project Managers focused on the cloud, Cloud Engineers, DevOps Engineers, and Enterprise Architects.</p><p>Training: 114.75 hrs, online, self-directed</p><p>Testing: 2-hr test, with two options: an online proctored exam, or an onsite-proctored exam at a testing center.</p><table><thead><tr></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>3+ years of industry experience, including 1+ year of designing and managing solutions with Google Cloud</td></tr></tbody></table><p><strong>Certification expiry &amp; recertification</strong>: The certificate is valid for 2 years.

It dives deep into how various IT infrastructure components in the Microsoft ecosystem (like compute, network, storage, monitoring, and security) interact to generate solutions. Just like the Google certificate above, this is infrastructure-focused, not software-focused, so keep that in mind when considering it.</p><p>The course for the Microsoft certification is shorter than Google‚Äôs by almost 100 hours and can be taken both online at your own pace, or with an online instructor. It‚Äôs also a bit cheaper than Google‚Äôs, making it an easier investment both for hours and dollars spent.</p><p>: Systems Administrators, Network Engineers, IT Managers, Cloud Architects, Computer Systems Analysts and Infrastructure Engineers.</p><p>Training: Self-paced online learning (15.25 hrs), or instructor-led online training (4 days).</p><p>Testing: Online proctored exam.</p><table><thead><tr></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>$165 USD  Self-paced training is free; instructor-led depends on the provider.</td><td>Experience with Azure administration and development, and DevOps processes.

One of the nice things is that RHCA offers tracks in both infrastructure and enterprise applications. So you can choose the option that best matches your goals.</p><p>Red Hat prices its certification differently than most. It‚Äôs a subscription-based model, which allows you to have a little more freedom with how you tackle their training. In fact, their certification offers the most custom options, with a variety of options to get from A (where you are) to B (certified).

Its foundation and advanced certificates offer room for architects to grow.</p><p>This is a two-step program, foundation and advanced, which puts it between the single-step SOA certification and the larger three- or even four-step offerings. Just like TOGAF and ITIL, iSAQB is not a testing or training provider, so there are a lot of options for training. Or, if you‚Äôre confident, you can challenge the exam without, though that‚Äôs not recommended.</p><p>: Software designers, software developers, Software Architects, systems analysts</p><p>\nThough training and testing are performed by independent operators, you have four testing options available, including:</p><ul><li>Exam after classroom training</li></ul><table><thead><tr></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>The cost of training is dependent on training providers.

Depending on your career path, you may choose to get certified by one of the bodies above, or simply study on your own and prove what you can do through practical experience.</p><p>If you‚Äôve decided to pursue the certification path, the options above are all great choices. Of course, each requires a commitment of time and money. While you can‚Äôt warp the space-time continuum to change the time requirement, it may be possible to get your employer to help you cover some, if not all of the cost. If they do, it gives you an even higher ROI on your investment to yourself.</p>","contentLength":20228,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/1iuqdq8/certifications_for_software_architects/"},{"title":"Becoming an Machine Learning Engineer in 2025","url":"https://www.kdnuggets.com/becoming-machine-learning-engineer-2025","date":1740142855,"author":"Nisha Arya","guid":8572,"unread":true,"content":"<article>Read some honest advice on how to become a machine learning engineer.</article>","contentLength":69,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"https://www.kdnuggets.com/wp-content/uploads/8-bit_ninja_2d_platformer_in_an_office_building_2.png","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"This month in Servo: new webview API, relative colors, canvas buffs, and more!","url":"https://servo.org/blog/2025/02/19/this-month-in-servo/","date":1740142406,"author":"/u/wuyuwei-tw","guid":8721,"unread":true,"content":"<p>Servo now supports several new web API features:</p><p>We‚Äôve landed a bunch of  improvements:</p><p> are a lot more useful now, with  now supporting  (<a href=\"https://github.com/Taym95\">@Taym95</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/35040\">#35040</a>), , , and  (<a href=\"https://github.com/Taym95\">@Taym95</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/34958\">#34958</a>).</p><p>Servo aims to be an embeddable web engine, but so far it‚Äôs been a lot harder to embed Servo than it should be.</p><p>For one, configuring and starting Servo is complicated.\nWe found that getting Servo running at all, even without wiring up input or handling resizes correctly, took  of Rust code (<a href=\"https://github.com/delan\">@delan</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/mrobinson\">@mrobinson</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/35118\">#35118</a>).\nEmbedders (apps) could only control Servo by sending and receiving a variety of ‚Äúmessages‚Äù and ‚Äúevents‚Äù, and simple questions like ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs the current URL?‚Äù were impossible to answer without keeping track of extra state in the app.</p><p>Contrast this with <a href=\"https://webkitgtk.org/\">WebKitGTK</a>, where you can write a minimal kiosk app with a fully-functional webview in  of C.\nTo close that gap, we‚Äôve started <strong>reworking our embedding API</strong> towards something more idiomatic and ergonomic, starting with the concept embedders care about most: the .</p><p>Our new webview API is controlled by calling methods on a  (<a href=\"https://github.com/delan\">@delan</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/mrobinson\">@mrobinson</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/35119\">#35119</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/35183\">#35183</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/35192\">#35192</a>), including navigation and user input.\nHandles will eventually represent the lifecycle of the webview itself;

Java is one of the oldest and most robust programming languages. It is also an object-oriented language mainly used for Android application development. This is one of the main reasons it is still used today. However, with the advent of programming languages ‚Äã‚Äãlike Kotlin (also suitable for Android development), Java is becoming less popular.</p><p>However, Java remains one of the most expensive programming languages ‚Äã‚Äãand is in great demand. According to Indeed, software developers are interested in Java developers and pay more than $ 100,000 a year.</p><p>Swift iOS application development is currently very popular. Swift is a very stable programming language and worth studying. It‚Äôs easier to learn than Java. YouTube has a lot of resources to help you learn, and programming with them is fun. If you‚Äôre a freelance developer in Swift now, or if you work for a job related to it, your annual salary can reach $ 115,000.</p><p>SQL or Sequel is a structured search language. Some people think it‚Äôs not really a programming language. SQL is mainly used for data management and interactive. So SQL is an essential skill in programming, and any type of web development (backend or full stack) needs to be learned to manage the data. According to statistics, the average annual income of SQL developers is over $ 90,000.</p><p>This is a mysterious programming language, and some people think it‚Äôs the best. JavaScript is a very popular language. If you check GitHub, you‚Äôll always see new frameworks that support JavaScript. In addition, all browsers support JavaScript. Therefore, learning JavaScript is one of the skills that software development must know.

A Beginner‚Äôs Guide","url":"https://dev.to/kihuni/what-is-a-restful-api-a-beginners-guide-4hdg","date":1740124827,"author":"kihuni","guid":8439,"unread":true,"content":"<p>In today‚Äôs digital world, applications need to communicate seamlessly with each other. Whether you log into a website, check the weather on your phone, or order food online, you're likely interacting with a RESTful API in the background.</p><p>But what exactly is a RESTful API? In this guide, we'll break it down in a simple and digestible way.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  What Does \"RESTful\" Even Mean?\n</h3><p>Let‚Äôs start with the basics.</p><p>An API (Application Programming Interface) is a way for different software applications to communicate with each other. Think of it like a waiter in a restaurant:</p><ul><li>You (the client) place an order.</li><li>The waiter (API) takes your request to the kitchen (server).</li><li>The kitchen prepares the food and the waiter brings it back to you.</li></ul><p>In technical terms, an API allows a client (e.g., a web app or mobile app) to request and receive data from a server.</p><p><em>So, What Are RESTful APIs??</em></p><p>REST stands for Representational State Transfer‚Äîdon‚Äôt worry, it‚Äôs not as complicated as it sounds! It‚Äôs just a set of instructions for how computers and apps should share info over the internet. Think of it like a simple rulebook for keeping their conversations clear and organized.</p><p>A RESTful API is an API that follows these REST rules. It‚Äôs like calling a caf√© ‚Äúspecialty‚Äù because it makes coffee in a certain way. RESTful APIs have their principles which APIs must follow to qualify as \"RESTFUL APIs\".</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  What Makes an API 'RESTful'\n</h3><p>For an API to be RESTful, it must follow these principles:</p><ol><li><p>Client-Server Architecture ‚Äì The client (e.g., a mobile app) and server (e.g., a database) remain separate so they can evolve independently.</p></li><li><p>Statelessness ‚Äì The server does not store client data between requests. Every request contains all the necessary information.</p></li><li><p>Cacheability ‚Äì Responses can be cached to improve performance.</p></li><li><p>Uniform Interface ‚Äì Consistent resource naming and use of HTTP methods.</p></li><li><p>Layered System ‚Äì Requests can pass through intermediaries (e.g., load balancers) without affecting how they function.</p></li></ol><p>RESTful APIs rely on standard HTTP methods to perform actions on resources. Imagine an online payslip system::</p><div><table><thead><tr></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td> (Get payslip with ID 123)</td></tr><tr><td> (Add a new payslip)</td></tr><tr><td> (Update payslip with ID 123)</td></tr><tr><td> (Delete payslip with ID 123)</td></tr></tbody></table></div><p><em>Example API Request (Python)</em></p><p>Here‚Äôs a simple Python example using the requests library to fetch a payslip:</p><div><pre><code>import requests\n\nresponse = requests.get(\"https://api.example.com/payslips/123\")\nif response.status_code == 200:\n    print(response.json())\nelse:\n    print(\"Error fetching data\")\n</code></pre></div><p>This request retrieves a payslip from the API and prints the JSON response.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  RESTful APIs vs. Other API Styles\n</h3><ul><li>REST: Uses lightweight JSON or XML over HTTP.</li><li>SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol): More complex, uses XML, and requires additional protocols like WS-Security.</li></ul><ul><li>REST: Fixed endpoints (/users, /orders).</li><li>GraphQL: Allows flexible queries, fetching only necessary data</li></ul><h3>\n  \n  \n  Authentication in RESTful APIs\n</h3><p>APIs often require authentication to protect sensitive data. Common methods include:</p><ul><li>API Keys ‚Äì Unique keys assigned to users.</li><li>OAuth 2.0 ‚Äì Secure authorization protocol used by platforms like Google and GitHub.</li><li>JWT (JSON Web Tokens) ‚Äì Tokens used for secure authentication between client and server.</li></ul><p>Example authentication using a Bearer Token:</p><div><pre><code>headers = {\"Authorization\": \"Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN\"}\nresponse = requests.get(\"https://api.example.com/payslips/123\", headers=headers)\nprint(response.json())\n</code></pre></div><p>RESTful APIs are a clever and organized way for apps and computers to share stuff over the internet. They use simple ideas like resources (think of them as items they‚Äôre working with), HTTP methods (like ‚Äúget‚Äù or ‚Äúsend‚Äù), and web addresses (called URIs), plus some cool tricks like not remembering past chats (statelessness) and saving info for later (caching).

Guanao is the first author of the Nature Communications review article [1].</em></p><p>Spatially resolved transcriptomics (SRT) is revolutionizing <a href=\"https://towardsdatascience.com/tag/genomics/\" title=\"Genomics\">Genomics</a> by enabling the high-throughput measurement of gene expression while preserving spatial context. Unlike single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), which captures transcriptomes without spatial location information, SRT allows researchers to map gene expression to precise locations within a tissue, providing insights into tissue organization, cellular interactions, and spatially coordinated gene activity. The increasing volume and complexity of SRT data necessitate the development of robust statistical and computational methods, making this field highly relevant to data scientists, statisticians, and machine learning (ML) professionals. Techniques such as spatial statistics, graph-based models, and deep learning have been applied to extract meaningful biological insights from these data.</p><p>A key step in SRT analysis is the detection of spatially variable genes (SVGs)‚Äîgenes whose expression varies non-randomly across spatial locations. Identifying SVGs is crucial for characterizing tissue architecture, functional gene modules, and cellular heterogeneity. However, despite the rapid development of computational methods for SVG detection, these methods vary widely in their definitions and statistical frameworks, leading to inconsistent results and challenges in interpretation.</p><p>In our recent review published in [1], we systematically examined 34 peer-reviewed SVG detection methods and introduced a classification framework that clarifies the biological significance of different SVG types. This article provides an overview of our findings, focusing on the three major categories of SVGs and the statistical principles underlying their detection.</p><p>SVG detection methods aim to uncover genes whose spatial expression reflects biological patterns rather than technical noise. Based on our review of 34 peer-reviewed methods, we categorize SVGs into three groups: Overall SVGs, Cell-Type-Specific SVGs, and Spatial-Domain-Marker SVGs (Figure 2).</p><p>Methods for detecting the three SVG categories serve different purposes (Fig. 3). First, the detection of overall SVGs screens informative genes for downstream analyses, including the identification of spatial domains and functional gene modules. Second, detecting cell-type-specific SVGs aims to reveal spatial variation within a cell type and help identify distinct cell subpopulations or states within cell types. Third, spatial-domain-marker SVG detection is used to find marker genes to annotate and interpret spatial domains already detected. These markers help understand the molecular mechanisms underlying spatial domains and assist in annotating tissue layers in other datasets.</p><p>The relationship among the three SVG categories depends on the detection methods, particularly the null and alternative hypotheses they employ. If an overall SVG detection method uses the null hypothesis that a non-SVG‚Äôs expression is independent of spatial location and the alternative hypothesis that any deviation from this independence indicates an SVG, then its SVGs should theoretically include both cell-type-specific SVGs and spatial-domain-marker SVGs. For example, DESpace [2] is a method that detects both overall SVGs and spatial-domain-marker SVGs, and its detected overall SVGs must be marker genes for some spatial domains. This inclusion relationship holds true except in extreme scenarios, such as when a gene exhibits opposite cell-type-specific spatial patterns that effectively cancel each other out. However, if an overall SVG detection method‚Äôs alternative hypothesis is defined for a specific spatial expression pattern, then its SVGs may not include some cell-type-specific SVGs or spatial-domain-marker SVGs.</p><p>To understand how SVGs are detected, we categorized the statistical approaches into three major types of hypothesis tests:&nbsp;</p><ol><li>Dependence Test ‚Äì Examines the dependence between a gene‚Äôs expression level and the spatial location.&nbsp;</li><li>Regression Fixed-Effect Test ‚Äì Examines whether some or all of the fixed-effect covariates, for instance, spatial location, contribute to the mean of the response variable, i.e., a gene‚Äôs expression.&nbsp;</li><li>Regression Random-Effect Test (Variance Component Test) ‚Äì Examines whether the random-effect covariates, for instance, spatial location, contribute to the variance of the response variable, i.e., a gene‚Äôs expression.</li></ol><p>To further explain how these tests are used for SVG detection, we denote ùëå as gene‚Äôs expression level and ùëÜ as the spatial locations. Dependence test is the most general hypothesis test for SVG detection. For a given gene, it decides whether the gene‚Äôs expression level ùëå is independent of the spatial location ùëÜ, i.e., the null hypothesis is:</p><p>There are two types of regression tests: fixed-effect tests, where the effect of the spatial location is assumed to be fixed, and random-effect tests, which assume the effect of the spatial location as random. To explain these two types of tests, we use a linear mixed model for a given gene as an example:</p><p>\nwhere the response variable \\( Y_i \\) is the gene‚Äôs expression level at spot \\( i \\), \n\\( x_i \\) \\( \\epsilon \\) \\( R^p \\) indicates the fixed-effect covariates of spot \\( i \\), \n\\( z_i \\) \\( \\epsilon \\) \\( R^q \\) denotes the random-effect covariates of spot \\( i \\), \nand \\( \\epsilon_i \\) is the random measurement error at spot \\( i \\) with zero mean. \n\nIn the model parameters, \\( \\beta_0 \\) is the (fixed) intercept, \\( \\beta \\) \\( \\epsilon \\) \\( R^p \\) indicates the fixed effects, and \\( \\gamma \\) \\( \\epsilon \\) \\( R^q \\) denotes the random effects with zero means and the covariance matrix:\n</p><p>In this linear mixed model, independence is assumed between random effect and random errors and among random errors.</p><p>Fixed-effect tests examine whether some or all of the fixed-effect covariates \\( x_i \\) (dependent on spatial locations ) contribute to the mean of the response variable. If all fixed-effect covariates make no contribution, then:</p><p>Random-effect tests examine whether the random-effect covariates \\( z_i \\) (dependent on spatial locations ) contribute to the variance of the response variable Var‚Å°Yi, focusing on the decomposition: </p><p>and testing if the contribution of the random-effect covariates&nbsp;is zero. The null hypothesis:</p><p>Among the 23 methods that use frequentist hypothesis tests, dependence tests and random-effect regression tests have been primarily applied to detect overall SVGs, whereas fixed-effect regression tests have been used across all three SVG categories. Understanding these distinctions is key to selecting the right method for specific research questions.</p><p>Improving SVG detection methods requires balancing detection power, specificity, and scalability while addressing key challenges in spatial transcriptomics analysis. Future developments should focus on adapting methods to different SRT technologies and tissue types, as well as extending support for multi-sample SRT data to enhance biological insights. Additionally, strengthening statistical rigor and validation frameworks will be crucial for ensuring the reliability of SVG detection. Benchmarking studies also need refinement, with clearer evaluation metrics and standardized datasets to provide robust method comparisons.</p><p>[1] Yan, G., Hua, S.H. &amp; Li, J.J. (2025).

Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) are differential equations involving derivatives of multiple variables that can cover a far broader range and more complex systems. Often, ODEs are special cases or special assumptions applied to PDEs.</p><p>PDEs include Maxwell‚Äôs Equations (governing electricity and magnetism), Navier-Stokes equations (governing fluid flow for aircraft, engines, blood, and other cases), and the Boltzman equation for thermodynamics. PDEs can describe systems such as<a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0022247X85900435\"> flexible structures</a>,<a href=\"https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/337292.337359\"> power grids</a>,<a href=\"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4392493\"> manufacturing</a>, or<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/html/2405.12938v3\"> epidemiological</a> models in biology. They can represent highly complex behavior; the Navier Stokes equations describe the eddies of a rushing mountain stream. Their capacity for capturing and revealing more complex behavior of real-world systems makes these equations an important topic for study, both in terms of describing systems and analyzing known equations to make new discoveries about systems. Entire fields (like fluid dynamics, electrodynamics, structural mechanics) can be devoted to study of just a single set of PDEs.</p><p>This increased complexity comes with a cost; the systems captured by PDEs are much more difficult to analyze and control. ODEs are also described as lumped-parameter systems, the various parameters and variables that describe them are ‚Äúlumped‚Äù into a discrete point (or small number of points for a coupled system of ODEs). PDEs are distributed parameter systems that track behavior throughout space and time. In other words, the state space for an ODE is a relatively small number of variables, such as time and a few system measurements at a specific point. For PDE/distributed parameter systems, the state space size can approach infinite dimensions, or discretized for computation into millions of points .&nbsp;A lumped parameter system controls the temperature of an engine based on a small number of sensors. A PDE/distributed parameter system would manage temperature dynamics across the entire engine.&nbsp;</p><p>As with ODEs, many PDEs must be analyzed (aside from special cases) through modelling and simulation. However, due to the higher dimensions, this modelling becomes far more complex. Many ODEs can be solved through straightforward applications of algorithms like MATLAB‚Äôs ODE45 or SciPy‚Äôs .&nbsp;PDEs are modelled across grids or meshes where the PDE is simplified to an algebraic equation (such as through Taylor Series expansion) at each point on the grid. Grid generation is a field, a science and art, on its own and ideal (or usable) grids can vary greatly based on problem geometry and <a href=\"https://towardsdatascience.com/tag/physics/\" title=\"Physics\">Physics</a>. Grids (and hence problem state spaces) can number in the millions of points with computation time running in days or weeks, and PDE solvers are often commercial software costing tens of thousands of dollars.&nbsp;</p><p>Controlling PDEs presents a far greater challenge than ODEs. The Laplace transform that forms the basis of much classical control theory is a one-dimensional transformation. While there has been some progress in PDE control theory, the field is not as comprehensive as for ODE/lumped systems. For PDEs, even basic controllability or observability assessments become difficult as the state space to assess increases by orders of magnitude and fewer PDEs have analytic solutions. By necessity, we run into design questions such as what part of the domain needs to be controlled or observed? Can the rest of the domain be in an arbitrary state?&nbsp;What subset of the domain does the controller need to operate over? With key tools in control theory underdeveloped, and new problems presented, applying machine learning has been a major area of research for understanding and controlling PDE systems.&nbsp;</p><p>Given the importance of PDEs, there has been research into developing control strategies for them. For example, <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Approximate-Controllability-Distributed-Parameter-Systems/dp/0521885728/ref=sr_1_1?crid=3FGUZ2CQYKGYQ&amp;dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.-oRlRZ73sDSnpAcPPbERrs7CUlG0Gr_Aw0V_JYBKkmc.ur8hTlYbid8e3MzQG0RdztW3vwTamw8QFtzQtDCbwHQ&amp;dib_tag=se&amp;keywords=analysis+and+control+of+distributed+parameter+systems+Glowinski&amp;qid=1739749882&amp;sprefix=analysis+and+control+of+distributed+parameter+systems+glowinski+%2Caps%2C88&amp;sr=8-1\">Glowinski et. all</a> developed an analytical adjoint based method from advanced functional analysis relying on simulation of the system. Other approaches, such as discussed by <a href=\"https://uwaterloo.ca/applied-mathematics/sites/default/files/uploads/documents/morris_controlhandbook.pdf\">Kirsten Morris</a>, apply estimations to reduce the order of the PDE to facilitate more traditional control approaches.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15267\">Botteghi and Fasel</a>, have begun to apply machine learning to control of these systems (note, this is only a VERY BRIEF glimpse of the research). Here we will apply reinforcement learning on two PDE control problems. The diffusion equation is a simple, linear, second order PDE with known analytic solution. The Kuramoto‚ÄìSivashinsky (K-S) equation is a much more complex 4 order nonlinear equation that models instabilities in a flame front.&nbsp;</p><p>For both these equations we use a simple, small square domain of grid points. We target a sinusoidal pattern in a target area of a line down the middle of the domain by controlling input along left and right sides. Input parameters for the controls are the values at the target region and the  coordinates of the input control points. Training the algorithm required modelling the system development through time with the control inputs. As discussed above, this requires a grid where the equation is solved at each point then iterated through each time step. I used the <a href=\"https://github.com/zwicker-group/py-pde\">py-pde package</a> to create a training environment for the reinforcement learner (thanks to the developer of this package for his prompt feedback and help!). With the  environment, approach proceeded as usual with reinforcement learning:&nbsp;the particular algorithm develops a guess at a controller strategy. That controller strategy is applied at small, discrete time steps and provides control inputs based on the current state of the system that lead to some reward (in this case, root mean square difference between target and current distribution).&nbsp;</p><p>Unlike previous cases, I only present results from the <a href=\"https://towardsdatascience.com/rl-for-physical-dynamical-systems-an-alternative-approach-8e2269dc1e79/\">genetic-programming</a> controller. I developed code to apply a soft actor critic (SAC) algorithm to execute <a href=\"https://github.com/retter-berkeley/DockerPDE_SAC\">as a container on AWS Sagemaker</a>. However, full execution would take about 50 hours and I didn‚Äôt want to spend the money! I looked for ways to reduce the computation time, but eventually gave up due to time constraints; this article was already taking long enough to get out with my job, military reserve duty, family visits over the holidays, civic and church involvement, and not leaving my wife to take care of our baby boy alone!</p><p>&nbsp;First we will discuss the diffusion equation:</p><p>with x as a two dimensional cartesian vector and ‚àÜ <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laplace_operator\">Laplace operator</a></p><pre><code>from pde import Diffusion, CartesianGrid, ScalarField, DiffusionPDE, pde\ngrid = pde.CartesianGrid([[0, 1], [0, 1]], [20, 20], periodic=[False, True])\nstate = ScalarField.random_uniform(grid, 0.0, 0.2)\nbc_left={\"value\": 0}\nbc_right={\"value\": 0}\nbc_x=[bc_left, bc_right]\nbc_y=\"periodic\"\n#bc_x=\"periodic\"\neq = DiffusionPDE(diffusivity=.1, bc=[bc_x, bc_y])\nsolver=pde.ExplicitSolver(eq, scheme=\"euler\", adaptive = True)\n#result = eq.solve(state, t_range=dt, adaptive=True, tracker=None)\nstepper=solver.make_stepper(state, dt=1e-3)\ntarget = 1.*np.sin(2*grid.axes_coords[1]*3.14159265)</code></pre><p>The problem is sensitive to diffusion coefficient and domain size; mismatch between these two results in washing out control inputs before they can reach the target region unless calculated over a long simulation time. The control input was updated and reward evaluated every 0.1 timestep up to an end time of T=15.&nbsp;</p><p>Due to py-pde package architecture, the control is applied to one column inside the boundary. Structuring the py-pde package to execute with the boundary condition updated each time step resulted in a memory leak, and the py-pde developer advised using a stepper function as a work-around that doesn‚Äôt allow updating the boundary condition. This means the results aren‚Äôt exactly physical, but do display the basic principle of PDE control with reinforcement learning.&nbsp;</p><p>The GP algorithm was able to arrive at a final reward (sum mean square error of all 20 points in the central column) of about 2.0 after about 30 iterations with a 500 tree forest. The results are shown below as target and achieved distributed in the target region.</p><p>Now the more interesting and complex K-S equation:</p><p>Unlike the diffusion equation, the K-S equation displays rich dynamics (as befitting an equation describing flame behavior!). Solutions may include stable equilibria or travelling waves, but with increasing domain size all solutions will eventually become chaotic. The PDE implementation is given by below code:</p><pre><code>grid = pde.CartesianGrid([[0, 10], [0, 10]], [20, 20], periodic=[True, True])\nstate = ScalarField.random_uniform(grid, 0.0, 0.5)\nbc_y=\"periodic\"\nbc_x=\"periodic\"\neq = PDE({\"u\": \"-gradient_squared(u) / 2 - laplace(u + laplace(u))\"}, bc=[bc_x, bc_y])\nsolver=pde.ExplicitSolver(eq, scheme=\"euler\", adaptive = True)\nstepper=solver.make_stepper(state, dt=1e-3)\ntarget=1.*np.sin(0.25*grid.axes_coords[1]*3.14159265)</code></pre><p>Control inputs are capped at +/-5.&nbsp;The K-S equation is naturally unstable; if any point in the domain exceeds +/- 30 the iteration terminates with a large negative reward for causing the system to diverge. Experiments with the K-S equation in  revealed strong sensitivity to domain size and number of grid points. The equation was run for T=35, both with control and reward update at dt=0.1.</p><p>For each, the GP algorithm had more trouble arriving at a solution than in the diffusion equation. I chose to manually stop execution when the solution became visually close; again, we are looking for general principles here. For the more complex system, the controller works better‚Äîlikely because of how dynamic the K-S equation is the controller is able to have a bigger impact. However, when evaluating the solution for different run times, I found it was not stable; the algorithm learned to arrive at the target distribution at a particular time, not to stabilize at that solution. The algorithm converged to the below solution, but, as the successive time steps show, the solution is unstable and begins to diverge with increasing time steps.&nbsp;</p><p>Careful tuning on the reward function would help obtain a solution that would hold longer, reinforcing how vital correct reward function is. Also, in all these cases we aren‚Äôt coming to perfect solutions; but, especially for the K-S equations we are getting decent solutions with comparatively little effort compared to non-RL approaches for tackling these sorts of problems.</p><p>The GP solution is taking longer to solve with more complex problems and has trouble handling large input variable sets. To use larger input sets, the equations it generates become longer which make it less interpretable and slower to compute.&nbsp;Solution equations had scores of terms rather than the dozen or so in ODE systems. Neural network approaches can handle large input variable sets more easily as input variables only directly impact the size of the input layer.&nbsp;Further, I suspect that neural networks will be able to handle more complex and larger problems better for reasons discussed previously in previous posts. Because of that, I did develop <a href=\"https://github.com/retter-berkeley/PhysicsGyms\">gymnasiums for py-pde diffusion</a>, which can easily be adapted to other PDEs per the <a href=\"https://py-pde.readthedocs.io/en/latest/\">py-pde documentation</a>. These gymnasiums can be used with different NN-based reinforcement learning such as the SAC algorithm I developed (which, as discussed, runs but takes time).&nbsp;</p><p>Adjustments could also be made to the genetic <a href=\"https://towardsdatascience.com/tag/programming/\" title=\"Programming\">Programming</a> approach. For example, vector representation of inputs could reduce size of solution equations. Duriez et al. all proposes using Laplace transform to introduce derivatives and integrals into the genetic programming equations, broadening the function spaces they can explore.&nbsp;</p><p>The ability to tackle more complex problems is important. As discussed above, PDEs can describe a wide range of complex phenomena. Currently, controlling these systems usually means lumping parameters. Doing so leaves out dynamics and so we end up working against such systems rather than with them. Efforts to control or manage these means higher control effort, missed efficiencies, and increased risk of failure (small or catastrophic). Better understanding and control alternatives for PDE systems could unlock major gains in engineering fields where marginal improvements have been the standard such as <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/316088790_MODELLING_VEHICLE_TRAFFIC_FLOW_WITH_PARTIAL_DIFFERENTIAL_EQUATIONS\">traffic</a>,<a href=\"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/21642583.2015.1033565\"> supply chains</a>, and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetohydrodynamics\">nuclear fusion</a> as these systems behave as high dimensional distributed parameter systems. They are highly complex with nonlinear and emergent phenomena but have large available data sets‚Äîideal for machine learning to move past current barriers in understanding and optimization.&nbsp;</p><p>For now, I have only taken a very basic look at applying ML to controlling PDEs. Follow ons to the control problem include not just different systems, but optimizing where in the domain the control is applied, experimenting with reduced-order observation space, and optimizing the control for simplicity or control effort. In addition to improved control efficiency, as discussed in Brunton and Kutz, machine learning can also be used to derive data-based models of complex physical systems and to determine reduced order models which reduce state space size and may be more amenable to analysis and control, by traditional or machine learning methods. Machine learning and PDEs is an exciting area of research, and I encourage you to see what the professionals are doing!</p>","contentLength":13472,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"creating your own Docker like what a shiny title and hard work A year ago, I built a minimal container in Go.

I encountered many challenges, especially with aspects like OverlayFS and networking.</p><p>My biggest issue in my first implementation was networking. It was really difficult to isolate the child container and set up its own bridged network.</p><p>To solve network isolation, you need to think clearly ü§î at this stage.</p><p>First, you need to create a bridge on the host with two virtual interfaces:</p><div><pre><code>The first interface remains on the host.\nThe second interface is moved to the child container ü´ô.\n</code></pre></div><p>The real challenge here is managing command signaling between the host and the child container.</p><p>In my approach, I will attempt to create a proof of concept implementation.\nUnderstanding Container Networking</p><p>When we create containers, one of the most crucial aspects is network isolation. Think of it like giving each container its own private network environment, complete with its own network interfaces, IP addresses, and routing rules. Let‚Äôs break down how we achieve this in our container implementation.\nThe Network Setup Process</p><ol><li>Creating the Network Namespace</li></ol><p>First, we create a separate network namespace for our container. This is like giving the container its own private networking room:</p><div><pre><code>const ContainerName = \"mycontainer\"\n\nfunc createNetworkNamespace(name string) error {\n    // Create directory for network namespaces\n    if err := os.MkdirAll(\"/var/run/netns\", 0755); err != nil {\n        return err\n    }\n\n    // Create the namespace file\n    nsFile := filepath.Join(\"/var/run/netns\", name)\n    fd, err := os.Create(nsFile)\n    if err != nil {\n        return err\n    }\n    fd.Close()\n\n    // Bind mount it to make it accessible\n    return syscall.Mount(\"/proc/self/ns/net\", nsFile, \"bind\", syscall.MS_BIND, \"\")\n}\n</code></pre></div><ol><li>Setting Up Virtual Network Interfaces</li></ol><p>We create a virtual network cable (veth pair) to connect our container to the host system:</p><div><pre><code>const (\n    VethHost      = \"veth0\"  // Host end of the cable\n    VethContainer = \"veth1\"  // Container end of the cable\n    ContainerIP   = \"10.0.0.2/24\"\n    HostIP        = \"10.0.0.1/24\"\n    Gateway       = \"10.0.0.1\"\n)\n</code></pre></div><p>The setup happens in two parts:\n1-On the host side:</p><div><pre><code>func setupHostNetwork(pid int) error {\n    // Create the virtual network cable (veth pair)\n    if err := exec.Command(\"ip\", \"link\", \"add\", VethHost, \"type\", \"veth\", \n        \"peer\", \"name\", VethContainer).Run(); err != nil {\n        return fmt.Errorf(\"failed to create veth pair: %v\", err)\n    }\n\n    // Move one end to the container\n    if err := exec.Command(\"ip\", \"link\", \"set\", VethContainer, \n        \"netns\", fmt.Sprintf(\"%d\", pid)).Run(); err != nil {\n        return fmt.Errorf(\"failed to move veth to container: %v\", err)\n    }\n\n    // Configure the host end\n    if err := exec.Command(\"ip\", \"link\", \"set\", VethHost, \"up\").Run(); err != nil {\n        return fmt.Errorf(\"failed to bring up host interface: %v\", err)\n    }\n    if err := exec.Command(\"ip\", \"addr\", \"add\", HostIP, \"dev\", VethHost).Run(); err != nil {\n        return fmt.Errorf(\"failed to assign IP to host interface: %v\", err)\n    }\n}\n</code></pre></div><p>2 ‚Äî Inside the container:</p><div><pre><code>func setupContainerNetwork() error {\n    // Enable the loopback interface\n    if err := exec.Command(\"ip\", \"link\", \"set\", \"lo\", \"up\").Run(); err != nil {\n        return fmt.Errorf(\"failed to bring up lo: %v\", err)\n    }\n\n    // Configure the container's network interface\n    if err := exec.Command(\"ip\", \"link\", \"set\", VethContainer, \"up\").Run(); err != nil {\n        return fmt.Errorf(\"failed to bring up veth: %v\", err)\n    }\n    if err := exec.Command(\"ip\", \"addr\", \"add\", ContainerIP, \n        \"dev\", VethContainer).Run(); err != nil {\n        return fmt.Errorf(\"failed to assign IP to veth: %v\", err)\n    }\n    if err := exec.Command(\"ip\", \"route\", \"add\", \"default\", \n        \"via\", Gateway).Run(); err != nil {\n        return fmt.Errorf(\"failed to add default route: %v\", err)\n    }\n}\n</code></pre></div><p>To allow our container to access the internet, we need to set up NAT (Network Address Translation) rules. This is like setting up a router for our container:</p><div><pre><code>func setupHostNetwork(pid int) error {\n    // Get the host's internet-connected interface\n    iface, err := getDefaultInterface()\n    if err != nil {\n        return fmt.Errorf(\"failed to get default interface: %v\", err)\n    }\n\n    // Set up NAT and forwarding rules\n    cmds := [][]string{\n        {\"sysctl\", \"-w\", \"net.ipv4.ip_forward=1\"},\n        {\"iptables\", \"-t\", \"nat\", \"-A\", \"POSTROUTING\", \n            \"-s\", \"10.0.0.0/24\", \"-o\", iface, \"-j\", \"MASQUERADE\"},\n        {\"iptables\", \"-A\", \"FORWARD\", \"-i\", iface, \n            \"-o\", VethHost, \"-j\", \"ACCEPT\"},\n        {\"iptables\", \"-A\", \"FORWARD\", \"-i\", VethHost, \n            \"-o\", iface, \"-j\", \"ACCEPT\"},\n    }\n\n    for _, cmd := range cmds {\n        if out, err := exec.Command(cmd[0], cmd[1:]...).CombinedOutput(); err != nil {\n            return fmt.Errorf(\"failed %v: %s\\n%s\", cmd, err, out)\n        }\n    }\n}\n</code></pre></div><p><strong>finally , Resource Cleanup</strong></p><p>One often overlooked but crucial aspect is cleaning up network resources when the container stops.

In this tutorial, we‚Äôll guide you through the process of creating a minimal container using Go. The example code provided focuses on essential containerization concepts, including namespaces, chroot, and control groups (cgroups).</p><p>Before getting started, ensure you have the following installed:</p><div><pre><code>Go programming language: Install Go\nBasic understanding of Linux namespaces and control groups\n</code></pre></div><p>introduction\nSo what is Linux namespaces and control groups ?</p><p>Namespaces have been part of the Linux kernel since about 2002, and over time more tooling and namespace types have been added. Real container support was added to the Linux kernel only in 2013, however. This is what made namespaces really useful and brought them to the masses.</p><p>But what are namespaces exactly? Here‚Äôs a wordy definition from Wikipedia:</p><p>‚ÄúNamespaces are a feature of the Linux kernel that partitions kernel resources such that one set of processes sees one set of resources while another set of processes sees a different set of resources.‚Äù</p><p>In other words, the key feature of namespaces is that they isolate processes from each other. On a server where you are running many different services, isolating each service and its associated processes from other services means that there is a smaller blast radius for changes, as well as a smaller footprint for security‚Äërelated concerns. Mostly though, isolating services meets the architectural style of microservices as described by Martin Fowler.\nTypes of Namespaces</p><p>Within the Linux kernel, there are different types of namespaces. Each namespace has its own unique properties:</p><div><pre><code>A user namespace has its own set of user IDs and group IDs for assignment to processes. In particular, this means that a process can have root privilege within its user namespace without having it in other user namespaces.\nA process ID (PID) namespace assigns a set of PIDs to processes that are independent from the set of PIDs in other namespaces. The first process created in a new namespace has PID 1 and child processes are assigned subsequent PIDs. If a child process is created with its own PID namespace, it has PID 1 in that namespace as well as its PID in the parent process‚Äô namespace. See below for an example.\nA network namespace has an independent network stack: its own private routing table, set of IP addresses, socket listing, connection tracking table, firewall, and other network‚Äërelated resources.\nA mount namespace has an independent list of mount points seen by the processes in the namespace. This means that you can mount and unmount filesystems in a mount namespace without affecting the host filesystem.\nAn interprocess communication (IPC) namespace has its own IPC resources, for example POSIX message queues.\nA UNIX Time‚ÄëSharing (UTS) namespace allows a single system to appear to have different host and domain names to different processes.\n\nthe container are fast isolated environment , we will focus on this part many things are involved and my main goal is to Demystifying Containers\n\nassuming that you are on a linux machine (try Power shell Ubuntu image if you are on Windows :-)\n</code></pre></div><div><pre><code>host-machine $ id\n\nuid=1000(mohamed) gid=1000(mohamed) groups=1000(mohamed) context=unconfined_u:unconfined_r:unconfined_t:s0-s0:c0.c.1023\n</code></pre></div><p>Now I run the following unshare command to create a new namespace with its own user and PID namespaces. I map the root user to the new namespace (in other words, I have root privilege within the new namespace), mount a new proc filesystem, and fork my process (in this case, bash) in the newly created namespace.</p><p>unshare --user --pid --map-root-user --mount-proc --fork bash</p><p>Congratulation , you are in isolated name space and some how you are on\nisolated PID in same file system and same network , your entry point /bin/bash</p><p>The ps -ef command shows there are two processes running ‚Äì bash and the ps command itself ‚Äì and the id command confirms that I‚Äôm root in the new namespace (which is also indicated by the changed command prompt):</p><div><pre><code>root # ps -ef\nUID         PID     PPID  C STIME TTY        TIME CMD\nroot          1        0  0 14:46 pts/0  00:00:00 bash\nroot         15        1  0 14:46 pts/0  00:00:00 ps -ef\nroot # id\nuid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root) context=unconfined_u:unconfined_r:unconfined_t:s0-s0:c0.c.1023\n</code></pre></div><p><strong>Namespaces and Containers</strong></p><blockquote><p>Namespaces are one of the technologies that containers are built on, used to enforce segregation of resources. We‚Äôve shown how to create namespaces manually, but container runtimes like Docker, rkt, podman , runC , containerD , and many other container technology\n    one of most unique projects are <a href=\"https://katacontainers.io/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://katacontainers.io/</a> they claim that they are mix between container and VM‚Äôs .\nWhat Are cgroups?</p></blockquote><p>cgroups, or control groups, are a Linux kernel feature that enables the management and limitation of system resources like CPU, memory, and network bandwidth, among others. We can use cgroups to set limits on these resources and distribute them among different groups of processes.</p><p>cgroups have a hierarchical structure with root and child, each with resource limits set by controllers ‚Äî for example, a CPU controller for CPU time or a memory controller for memory.</p><p>We can use cgroups for various purposes, such as controlling resource usage in a multi-tenant environment, providing Quality of Service (QoS) guarantees, and running containers.</p><p>Cgroups provide the following features:</p><div><pre><code>Resource limits ‚Äî You can configure a cgroup to limit how much of a particular resource (memory or CPU, for example) a process can use.\nPrioritization ‚Äî You can control how much of a resource (CPU, disk, or network) a process can use compared to processes in another cgroup when there is resource contention.\nAccounting ‚Äî Resource limits are monitored and reported at the cgroup level.\nControl ‚Äî You can change the status (frozen, stopped, or restarted) of all processes in a cgroup with a single command.\n</code></pre></div><p>The following command creates a v1 cgroup (you can tell by pathname format) called foo and sets the memory limit for it to 50,000,000 bytes (50 MB).</p><div><pre><code>root # mkdir -p /sys/fs/cgroup/memory/foo\nroot # echo 50000000 &gt; /sys/fs/cgroup/memory/foo/memory.limit_in_bytes\n</code></pre></div><p>Now I can assign a process to the cgroup, thus imposing the cgroup‚Äôs memory limit on it. I‚Äôve written a shell script called test.sh, which prints cgroup testing tool to the screen, and then waits doing nothing. For my purposes, it is a process that continues to run until I stop it.</p><p>I start test.sh in the background and its PID is reported as 2428. The script produces its output and then I assign the process to the cgroup by piping its PID into the cgroup file /sys/fs/cgroup/memory/foo/cgroup.procs.</p><div><pre><code>root # ./test.sh &amp;\n[1] 2428\nroot # cgroup testing tool\nroot # echo 2428 &gt; /sys/fs/cgroup/memory/foo/cgroup.procs\n</code></pre></div><p>To validate that my process is in fact subject to the memory limits that I defined for cgroup foo, I run the following ps command. The -o cgroup flag displays the cgroups to which the specified process (2428) belongs. The output confirms that its memory cgroup is foo.</p><div><pre><code>root # ps -o cgroup 2428\nCGROUP\n12:pids:/user.slice/user-0.slice/\\\nsession-13.scope,10:devices:/user.slice,6:memory:/foo,...\n\n</code></pre></div><p>By default, the operating system terminates a process when it exceeds a resource limit defined by its cgroup.</p><p>and this fair amount of information about namespace and cgroup\nyou can read full doc about it by Scott van Kalken of F5<p>\nat this link , also this post Demystifying Containers 101 and this one focus on Docker ecosystem ‚ÄúA Beginner-Friendly Introduction to Containers, VMs and Docker‚Äù</p>\npart 1 : Chroot<p>\ni will not use Namespaces , ‚Äúat this part‚Äù</p></p><p>this may surprise however i will achieve the isolation , we will use Chroot a simple UNIX tool</p><p>chroot, short for \"change root,\" is a Unix system call that changes the root directory of a process to a specified path, effectively creating a new root filesystem for the process and its children. This can be a powerful tool for creating isolated environments or \"chroot jails.\"\nHow Chroot Works:</p><div><pre><code>Setting a New Root Directory: When you execute the chroot system call or the chroot command in the shell, it changes the root directory for the process and its children. The new root directory becomes the / (root) directory for that process, isolating it from the actual root directory of the host system.\nIsolation: After the chroot operation, the process and its children can only access files and directories within the new root directory. They cannot access files outside this new root, providing a level of isolation and containment.\n</code></pre></div><div><pre><code>System Recovery: chroot is commonly used in system recovery scenarios. If your system becomes unbootable or experiences issues, you can boot from a live CD/USB, chroot into the broken system, and make necessary repairs without affecting the rest of the host system.\nEnvironment Isolation: Developers and system administrators may use chroot to create isolated environments for testing or building software. This is especially common in scenarios where different versions of libraries or dependencies are required.\nSecurity: Although chroot provides some level of isolation, it's not foolproof in terms of security. It was not designed as a security feature and should not be solely relied upon for containing malicious processes. Modern containerization technologies, like Docker, utilize more advanced mechanisms, such as Linux namespaces and cgroups, to provide stronger isolation.\n</code></pre></div><p>Consider the following example:</p><div><pre><code>\nmkdir mychroot\ncp -r /bin /lib /lib64 /usr /mychroot\nchroot /mychroot /bin/bash\n</code></pre></div><div><pre><code>We create a directory called mychroot and copy essential binaries and libraries into it.\nWe use chroot to change the root directory to /mychroot.\nAfter the chroot command, executing /bin/bash will run a Bash shell within the isolated environment.\n</code></pre></div><p>Keep in mind that chroot by itself does not provide complete isolation; it is often used in conjunction with other tools and techniques to create more secure and robust containerized environments.\nPrepare the Ubuntu Root Filesystem</p><p>now final this you will need before you start a filesystem .\nwe will use Docker to download Ubuntu filesystem</p><p>you will only need docker to download it , in your project root</p><div><pre><code>$ docker run -d --rm --name ubuntu_fs ubuntu:20.04 sleep 1000\n$ mkdir -p ./ubuntu_fs\n$ docker cp ubuntu_fs:/ ./ubuntu_fs\n$ docker stop ubuntu_fs\n</code></pre></div><p>now we have ubuntu_fs inside our project , inside your main package</p><div><pre><code>package main\n\nimport (\n \"io/ioutil\"\n \"log\"\n \"os\"\n \"os/exec\"\n \"path/filepath\"\n \"strconv\"\n \"syscall\"\n \"strings\"\n \"fmt\"\n \"github.com/vishvananda/netns\"\n\n)\n\n\n\nfunc main() {\n switch os.Args[1] {\n case \"run\":\n  run(os.Args[2:]...)\n case \"child\":\n  child(os.Args[2:]...)\n default:\n  log.Fatal(\"Unknown command.

This boilerplate follows specific structures and patterns that I believe are of high quality. The key question was whether the generated code would follow the same patterns and structure. Based on my findings, it does.</p><p>To recap, here‚Äôs a quick highlight of the Node.js API boilerplate‚Äôs key features:</p><ul><li>Vertical slicing architecture based on&nbsp;&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;&nbsp;principles</li><li>Services input validation using&nbsp;</li><li>Decoupling application components with dependency injection ()</li><li>Integration and&nbsp;&nbsp;testing with Supertest</li><li>Multi-service setup using&nbsp;compose</li></ul><p>Over the past month, I‚Äôve spent my weekends formalizing the solution and implementing the necessary code-generation logic. Below, I‚Äôll share the details.</p><p>Let‚Äôs explore the specifics of the implementation. All <a href=\"https://towardsdatascience.com/tag/code-generation/\" title=\"Code Generation\">Code Generation</a> logic is organized at the project root level, inside the&nbsp;&nbsp;folder, ensuring easy navigation. The Node.js boilerplate code has no dependency on&nbsp;, so it can be used as a regular template without modification.</p><p>It covers the following use cases:</p><ul><li>Generating clean, well-structured code for new module based on input description. The generated module becomes part of the Node.js REST API application.</li><li>Creating database migrations and extending seed scripts with basic data for the new module.</li><li>Generating and fixing E2E tests for the new code and ensuring all tests pass.</li></ul><p>The generated code after the first stage is clean and adheres to vertical slicing architecture principles. It includes only the necessary business logic for CRUD operations. Compared to other code generation approaches, it produces clean, maintainable, and compilable code with valid E2E tests.</p><p>The second use case involves generating DB migration with the appropriate schema and updating the seed script with the necessary data. This task is particularly well-suited for LLM, which handles it exceptionally well.</p><p>The final use case is generating E2E tests, which help confirm that the generated code works correctly. During the running of E2E tests, an SQLite3 database is used for migrations and seeds.</p><p>Mainly supported LLM clients are OpenAI and Claude.</p><p>To get started, navigate to the root folder&nbsp;&nbsp;and install all dependencies by running:</p><p>&nbsp;does not rely on Docker or any other heavy third-party dependencies, making setup and execution easy and straightforward. Before running the tool, ensure that you set at least one&nbsp;&nbsp;environment variable in the&nbsp;&nbsp;file with the appropriate API key for your chosen LLM provider. All supported environment variables are listed in the&nbsp;&nbsp;file (<code>OPENAI_API_KEY, CLAUDE_API_KEY</code>&nbsp;etc.) You can use&nbsp;,&nbsp;, or&nbsp;. As of mid-December,&nbsp;&nbsp;is surprisingly free to use. It‚Äôs possible to register&nbsp;<a href=\"https://openrouter.ai/nousresearch/hermes-3-llama-3.1-405b:free/api\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>&nbsp;and obtain a token for free usage. However, the output quality of this free LLaMA model could be improved, as most of the generated code fails to pass the compilation stage.</p><p>To start&nbsp;, run the following command:</p><p>Next, you‚Äôll be asked to input the module description and name. In the module description, you can specify all necessary requirements, such as entity attributes and required operations. The core remaining work is performed by micro-agents:&nbsp;,&nbsp;, and&nbsp;.</p><p>Here is an example of a successful code generation:</p><p>Below is another example demonstrating how a compilation error was fixed:</p><p>The following is an example of a generated&nbsp;&nbsp;module code:</p><p>A key detail is that you can generate code step by step, starting with one module and adding others until all required APIs are complete. This approach allows you to generate code for all required modules in just a few command runs.</p><p>As mentioned earlier, all work is performed by those micro-agents:&nbsp;,&nbsp;&nbsp;and&nbsp;, controlled by the&nbsp;. They run in the listed order, with the&nbsp;&nbsp;generating most of the codebase. After each code generation step, a check is performed for missing files based on their roles (e.g., routes, controllers, services). If any files are missing, a new code generation attempt is made, including instructions in the prompt about the missing files and examples for each role. Once the&nbsp;&nbsp;completes its work, TypeScript compilation begins. If any errors are found, the&nbsp;&nbsp;takes over, passing the errors to the prompt and waiting for the corrected code. Finally, when the compilation succeeds, E2E tests are run. Whenever a test fails, the&nbsp;&nbsp;steps in with specific prompt instructions, ensuring all tests pass and the code stays clean.</p><p>All micro-agents are derived from the&nbsp;&nbsp;class and actively reuse its base method implementations. Here is the&nbsp;&nbsp;implementation for reference:</p><p>Each agent utilizes its specific prompt. Check out this GitHub&nbsp;<a href=\"https://github.com/vyancharuk/nodejs-todo-api-boilerplate/blob/master/llm-codegen/core/prompts/developer.main.prompt\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">link</a>&nbsp;for the prompt used by the&nbsp;.</p><p>After dedicating significant effort to research and testing, I refined the prompts for all micro-agents, resulting in clean, well-structured code with very few issues.</p><p>During the development and testing, it was used with various module descriptions, ranging from simple to highly detailed. Here are a few examples:</p><pre><code>- The module responsible for library book management must handle endpoints for CRUD operations on books.\n- The module responsible for the orders management. It must provide CRUD operations for handling customer orders. Users can create new orders, read order details, update order statuses or information, and delete orders that are canceled or completed. Order must have next attributes: name, status, placed source, description, image url\n- Asset Management System with an \"Assets\" module offering CRUD operations for company assets. Users can add new assets to the inventory, read asset details, update information such as maintenance schedules or asset locations, and delete records of disposed or sold assets.</code></pre><p>Testing with&nbsp;&nbsp;and&nbsp;<code>claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022</code>&nbsp;showed comparable output code quality, although Sonnet is more expensive. Claude Haiku (<code>claude-3‚Äì5-haiku-20241022</code>), while cheaper and similar in price to&nbsp;, often produces non-compilable code. Overall, with&nbsp;, a single code generation session consumes an average of around 11k input tokens and 15k output tokens. This amounts to a cost of approximately 2 cents per session, based on token pricing of 15 cents per 1M input tokens and 60 cents per 1M output tokens (as of December 2024).</p><p>Below are Anthropic usage logs showing token consumption:</p><p>Based on my experimentation over the past few weeks, I conclude that while there may still be some issues with passing generated tests, 95% of the time generated code is compilable and runnable.</p><p>I hope you found some inspiration here and that it serves as a starting point for your next Node.js API or an upgrade to your current project.

If you're passionate about storytelling and want to bring your ideas to life through a visual medium, learning Ren'Py is a great first step.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.renpy.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Ren'Py</a> is a free and open-source engine that simplifies visual novel development. Whether you're an aspiring writer, artist, or programmer, Ren'Py provides all the tools you need to create professional-quality visual novels without requiring extensive technical knowledge.</p><p>In this article, we'll explore why Ren'Py is the perfect tool for beginners, the key concepts you need to learn, and how you can accelerate your journey with the right resources.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  1. Why Choose Ren'Py for Your Visual Novel Projects?\n</h2><p>Ren'Py has earned its place as the go-to tool for many visual novel developers, and for good reason. Here‚Äôs why it‚Äôs the best option for beginners:</p><p> Ren'Py uses a simple, Python-based scripting language that is easy to learn, even if you have no programming experience. Despite its simplicity, Ren'Py offers a wide range of features, such as branching narratives, interactive elements, character animations, and more. You can easily tweak Ren'Py to suit your needs, whether you‚Äôre a beginner or an advanced user. Ren'Py has a supportive community of developers, writers, and artists who share their knowledge, assets, and advice.\nIf you‚Äôre serious about creating high-quality visual novels, Ren'Py provides the perfect balance of simplicity and flexibility.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  2. Key Concepts to Understand in Ren'Py\n</h2><p>Learning Ren'Py can seem overwhelming at first, but once you break it down, it‚Äôs not as difficult as it seems. Here are some essential concepts you‚Äôll need to grasp to get started:</p><p>Ren'Py‚Äôs scripting language is simple and intuitive. To create a scene, you‚Äôll write commands that define the characters, backgrounds, and dialogue. For example:</p><div><pre><code>label start:\n    scene bg room\n    show char1 happy\n    \"Welcome to my visual novel!\"\n</code></pre></div><p>This basic script shows how easy it is to get started with Ren'Py. The syntax is straightforward, allowing you to focus on writing the story rather than wrestling with complex code.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Creating Characters &amp; Backgrounds\n</h3><p>You‚Äôll need to create character sprites and backgrounds to bring your story to life. Ren'Py makes it easy to display images and manage character emotions or poses:</p><p>This line will show char1 with a sad expression. You can swap out different images, backgrounds, and even animate characters, adding life to your narrative.</p><p>Choice Menus and Branching Narratives\nOne of Ren'Py‚Äôs strongest features is its ability to let players make choices that impact the story. With a simple menu command, you can create branching paths for the player to follow:</p><div><pre><code>menu:\n    \"Go left\":\n        jump left_path\n    \"Go right\":\n        jump right_path\n</code></pre></div><p>This simple choice mechanic adds replayability and depth to your visual novel.</p><p>Ren'Py offers a variety of transitions and visual effects, like fades, wipes, and custom animations. This is where you can start adding some flair to your visual novel, creating smooth scene changes or dramatic visual effects.</p><p>For example, to fade out a scene, you can use:</p><p>This creates a smoother transition between scenes, enhancing the overall experience.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Interactivity &amp; Minigames\n</h3><p>You can also incorporate minigames into your visual novel, providing an interactive element beyond the traditional choices. For example, in my own project, I developed a puzzle mini-game, where players could engage with the game to unlock new parts of the story.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  3. Resources to Accelerate Your Learning\n</h2><p>While Ren'Py is beginner-friendly, the best way to learn is by combining hands-on experience with structured learning. There are many great resources to help you along the way:</p><p> The official Ren'Py Documentation is the best place to start. It covers everything from basic scripting to advanced features. The Ren'Py forums are filled with tips, tutorials, and code snippets from experienced developers.<strong>Tutorial Blogs and YouTube Channels:</strong> There are numerous free tutorials online, many of which provide step-by-step guides to help you create your first visual novel.</p><p>If you‚Äôre looking for a more structured approach, I‚Äôve created a comprehensive Udemy course titled <a href=\"https://www.udemy.com/course/mastering-renpy-create-visual-novels-like-a-pro/?referralCode=9A4732B0C1A919F10AA6&amp;couponCode=ST3MT200225B\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Mastering Ren'Py: Create Visual Novels Like a Pro</a>. In this course, I cover everything from the basics to advanced techniques like creating custom screens, implementing animations, and designing minigames. It's a one-stop resource for anyone serious about mastering Ren'Py.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  4. Common Mistakes Beginners Make (and How to Avoid Them)\n</h2><p>Even the most experienced developers make mistakes, but the good news is that you can avoid common pitfalls by learning from others. Here are a few mistakes beginners often make and how to avoid them:</p><p><strong>Overcomplicating the Story:</strong> While it‚Äôs tempting to have a complex plot with endless branching, it‚Äôs better to start with a simple story. Focus on making each choice meaningful and impactful. It‚Äôs easy to get lost in a pile of code. Make sure to organize your scripts properly and comment on your code to avoid confusion later on. Testing is crucial. Playtest your visual novel frequently to catch bugs or awkward pacing before it‚Äôs too late.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  5. Tips for Creating an Engaging Visual Novel\n</h2><p>Now that you understand the basics, here are a few tips to make your visual novel stand out:</p><p>Great visual novels are driven by compelling stories. Develop deep, relatable characters and create an engaging narrative that keeps the player invested. The power of a visual novel lies in its ability to connect emotionally with players.</p><p>Visual novels rely heavily on artwork and music to set the tone. Good visuals and sound can elevate your storytelling to new heights. Whether you're an artist or working with a team, make sure your assets complement your story.</p><p>Once you have the basic structure of your visual novel, go back and refine it. Customize the user interface, add smooth transitions, and tweak the audio to create a more polished experience.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  6. How Long Does It Take to Learn Ren'Py?\n</h2><p>How long it takes to learn Ren'Py depends on your prior experience and how much time you can dedicate to learning. If you‚Äôre starting from scratch, expect to spend a few weeks getting comfortable with the basics. However, with dedicated effort, you can create a simple visual novel within a month.</p><p>For those who want to accelerate their learning, my <a href=\"https://www.udemy.com/course/mastering-renpy-create-visual-novels-like-a-pro/?referralCode=9A4732B0C1A919F10AA6&amp;couponCode=ST3MT200225B\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Udemy course</a> is designed to help you get up to speed quickly. You‚Äôll learn how to create a visual novel from start to finish, with tons of useful tips along the way.</p><p>Learning Ren'Py opens up a world of possibilities for storytelling and game development. Whether you‚Äôre a writer, artist, or programmer, Ren'Py offers an intuitive and flexible platform for creating visually stunning and interactive stories.</p><p>By combining the resources I‚Äôve shared here with practical experience, you'll be well on your way to creating your very own visual novel!</p>","contentLength":7122,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"[Media] Rust powered flight radar","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1iubs4r/media_rust_powered_flight_radar/","date":1740091662,"author":"/u/Confident-Alarm-6911","guid":7579,"unread":true,"content":"<p>So, consider this mix: I have thing for retro-interfaces with monochromatic displays, I wanted to learn rust and do something with sdr radio, I live next to the airport.

Also GitHub storage is not used, so no extra costs for it.</p><p>The setup has next features:</p><ul><li>Build process is done using IaaC approach with HashiCorp Terraform, so almoast no manual actions are needed from you.

That method might work well but has a significant disadvantage - build process happens on EC2 itself and uses EC2 RAM and CPU. This can be a problem if your EC2 instance is well-loaded without extra free resources. Moreover, low-end EC2 instances have a small amount of RAM and CPU, so build process which involves vite/tsc/etc can be slow or even fail.</p><p>So obviously to solve this problem we need to move the build process to CI, however it introduces new chellenges and we will solve them in this post.</p><p>Quick difference between approaches from previous post and current post:</p><table><thead><tr></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>How and where docker build happens</td><td>Source code is rsync-ed from CI to EC2 and docker build is done there</td><td>Docker build is done on CI and docker image is pushed to registry (in this post we run registry automatically on EC2)</td></tr><tr><td>How Docker build layers are cached</td><td>GitHub actions has no own Docker cache out of the box, so it should be stored in dedicated place (we use self-hosted registry on the EC2 as it is free)</td></tr><tr><td>Simpler setup with less code (we don't need code to run and secure registry, and don't need extra cache setup as is naturally persisted on EC2).</td><td>Build is done on CI, so EC2 server is not overloaded. For most cases CI builds are faster than on EC2. Plus time is saved because we don't need to rsync source code to EC2</td></tr><tr><td>Build on EC2 requires additional server RAM / overloads CPU</td><td>More terraform code is needed. registry cache might require small extra space on EC2</td></tr></tbody></table><h2>Chellenges when you build on CI<a href=\"https://adminforth.dev/blog/compose-ec2-deployment-github-actions-registry/#chellenges-when-you-build-on-ci\" aria-label=\"Direct link to Chellenges when you build on CI\" title=\"Direct link to Chellenges when you build on CI\">‚Äã</a></h2><p>When you move build process to CI you have to solve next chellenges:</p><ol><li>We need to deliver built docker images to EC2 somehow (and only we)</li><li>We need to persist cache between builds</li></ol><h4>Exporing images to tar files<a href=\"https://adminforth.dev/blog/compose-ec2-deployment-github-actions-registry/#exporing-images-to-tar-files\" aria-label=\"Direct link to Exporing images to tar files\" title=\"Direct link to Exporing images to tar files\">‚Äã</a></h4><p>Simplest option which you can find is save docker images to tar files and deliver them to EC2. We can easily do it in terraform (using  command on CI and  command on EC2). However this option has a significant disadvantage - it is slow. Docker images are big (always include all layers, without any options), so it takes infinity to do save/load and another infinity to transfer them to EC2 (via relatively slow rsync/SSH and relatively slow GitHub actions outbound connection).</p><p>Faster, right option which we will use here - involve Docker registry. Registry is a repository which stores docker images. It does it in a smart way - it saves each image as several layers, so if you will update last layer, then only last layer will be pushed to registry and then only last will be pulled to EC2.\nTo give you row compare - whole-layers image might take , but last layer created by  command might take . And most builds you will do only last layer changes, so it will be 20 times faster to push/pull last layer than whole image.\nAnd this is not all, registry uses TLS HTTP protocol so it is faster then SSH/rsync encrypted connection.</p><p>Of course you have to care about a way of registry authentication (so only you and your CI/EC2 can push/pull images).</p><p>What docker registry can you use? Pretty known options:</p><ol><li>Docker Hub - most famous. It is free for public images, so literally every opensource project uses it. However it is not free for private images, and you have to pay for it. In this post we are considering you might do development for commercial project with tight budget, so we will not use it.</li><li>GHCR - Registry from Google. Has free plan but allows to store only 500MB and allows to transfer 1GB of traffic per month. Then you pay for every extra GB in storage and traffic. Probably small images will fit in this plan, but generally even alpine-based docker images are bigger than 500MB, so it is not a good option.</li><li>Self-hosted registry web system. In our software development company, we use Harbor. It is a powerful free open-source registry that can be installed to own server. It allows pushing and pulling without limit. Also, it has internal life-cycle rules that cleanup unnecessary images and layers. The main drawbacks of it are that it is not so fast to install and configure, plus you have to get a domain and another powerfull server to run it. So unless you are a software development company, it is not worth using it.</li><li>Self-hosted minimal CNCF Distribution <a href=\"https://distribution.github.io/distribution/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">registry</a> on EC2 itself. So since we already have EC2, we can run registry on it directly. The  container is pretty light-weight and easy to setup and it will not consume a lot of extra CPU/RAM on server. Plus images will be stored close to application so pull will be fast.</li></ol><p>In the post we will use last (4th way). Our terraform will deploy registry automatically, so you don't have to do anything special.</p><p>Docker builds without layer cache persistence are possible but very slow. Most builds only change a couple of layers, and having no ability to cache them will cause the Docker builder to regenerate all layers from scratch. This can, for example, increase the Docker build time from a minute to ten minutes or even more.</p><p>Out of the box, GitHub Actions can't save Docker layers between builds, so you have to use external storage.</p><blockquote><p>Though some CI systems can persist docker build cache, e.g. open-source self-hosted Woodpecker CI allows it out of the box. However GitHub actions which is pretty popular, reasonably can't allow such free storage to anyone</p></blockquote><p>So when build-in Docker cache can't be used, there is one alternative - Docker BuildKit external cache.\nSo BuildKit allows you to connect external storage. There are several options, but most sweet for us is using Docker registry as cache storage (not only as images storage to deliver them to application server).</p><blockquote><p><em>BuildKit cache in Compose issue</em>\nPreviously we used docker compose to build &amp; run our app, it can be used to both build, push and pull images, but has <a href=\"https://github.com/docker/compose/issues/11072#issuecomment-1848974315\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">issues with external cache connection</a>. While they are not solved we have to use  command to build images. It is not so bad, but is another point of configuration which we will cover in this post.</p></blockquote><h3>Registry authorization and traffic encryption<a href=\"https://adminforth.dev/blog/compose-ec2-deployment-github-actions-registry/#registry-authorization-and-traffic-encryption\" aria-label=\"Direct link to Registry authorization and traffic encryption\" title=\"Direct link to Registry authorization and traffic encryption\">‚Äã</a></h3><p>Hosting custom CNCF registry, from other hand is a security responsibility.</p><p>If you don't protect it right, someone will be able to push any image to your registry and then pull it to your EC2 instance. This is a big security issue, so we have to protect our registry.</p><p>First of all we need to set some authorization to our registry so everyone who will push/pull images will be authorized. Here we have 2 options: HTTP basic auth and Client certificate auth. We will use first one as it is easier to setup.

I wanted to focus on two surveys that have appeared recently, which tell us a bit about languages that many of you probably used in a previous reincarnation cycle, but have already forgotten about.</p><p>Of course, the usual disclaimer at the beginning ‚Äì we know that surveys tend to show what they feel is worth showing and have a certain narrative power.</p><p>Having that in mind, I think we can begin.</p><p>First, let‚Äôs look at the people who filled out the survey ‚Äì demographics tell us a lot about the quality of the results and what we can expect. We have as many as 232 responses, with 75% Software Engineers and 49.6% people in tech-lead or related areas ‚Äì apparently, many of us wear several hats at once (yes, I know that pain too). It turned out that most of them work on closed-source projects (87.5%), although there‚Äôs no shortage of hardcore open-source folks (18.1%). I think that fairly reflects the state of the industry.</p><p>An overwhelming majority of respondents like or love Scala: 49.1% love it, 44% rather like it. The remaining 6.9% are still undecided, and 0.9% (i.e., 2 people) have fallen into Scala-depression. However here we also hit, to some extent, the ‚Äúpeak‚Äù of people interested in the topic - those willing to fill out the Scala Survey.</p><p>The average age of projects is 7 years, with a median of 6 years ‚Äì that‚Äôs quite‚Ä¶ a lot. It also shows that quite a bit of Scala is legacy projects ‚Äì at least in the surveyed group, ‚Äúgreenfields‚Äù are relatively rare.</p><p>Typelevel (41.8%), Akka (35.3%), ZIO (23.3%), and Play (15.5%). And of course, Spark (7.7%) ‚Äì let‚Äôs not forget that big data elephant in the room, though the days when it was synonymous with Data seem to be behind us. These people have a new best friend.</p><p>Moreover, more than half of the projects (53%) combine different ecosystems such as Akka and Cats, indicating that we‚Äôre building increasingly hybrid beasts. 36.2% are ‚Äúmonogamists‚Äù relying entirely on a single library (ZIO, we‚Äôre looking at you), and 10.8% are the brave ones using only the standard library.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/article/edit/7298227473140305920/#\" rel=\"\">VirtusLab</a><a href=\"https://github.com/scalameta/metals\" rel=\"\">project here</a></p><p>SBT beats everyone hands down (87.5%). Scala-CLI (11.2%) is relatively new but has decent traction, and Bazel (7.8%) and Maven (7.3%) also have loyal fans. </p><p>22.4% of commercial projects have already switched to Scala 3, but as many as 37% do not plan to. Why? Because as usual, the ecosystem is (still) not fully ready, there‚Äôs a lack of resources, and management is pushing the topic aside. You know that feeling when a new version of a language tempts you, but there are dozens of ‚Äúwork in progress‚Äù branches piling up in the repo‚Ä¶?</p><p>Talking about the problems, the report shows three major ones:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Fragmentation of the ecosystem and migration issues to Scala 3</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Lack of resources to maintain older projects.</strong></p></li></ul><p><strong>recruiting Scala developers</strong></p><p>Given these recruitment problems, it‚Äôs not surprising that 68.6% allow remote work, which at least somewhat makes life easier for those who have managed to settle in the Bieszczady Mountains or in Bali.</p><ul></ul><p>Despite all these challenges, 88.4% of respondents would still choose Scala for new projects without hesitation. It shows that the JVM community sees great potential in Scala, but also knows that working on its further development and tooling is a marathon, not a sprint.</p><p><a href=\"https://bit.ly/scala-report\" rel=\"\">the report is full of interesting details</a></p><p>Now, let's take a look at the other report I have for you today.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/article/edit/7298227473140305920/#\" rel=\"\">Alex Miller</a><a href=\"https://clojure.org/news/2024/12/02/state-of-clojure-2024\" rel=\"\">State of Clojure</a></p><p>Let‚Äôs start with what warms the hearts of backend folks the most: does Clojure live in real projects and is it more than just a hobby experiment? Definitely yes! 73% of respondents use Clojure at work, mainly in web development, commercial services, and enterprise applications. Their services often end up in the cloud ‚Äì public (58%) or private (26%). So you can say with confidence that the ‚ÄúLispy DSL‚Äù is conquering more and more server rooms and Docker containers.</p><p>What about team size? Most are small teams (up to 10 people), though there are also true giants ‚Äì Nubank, with over a thousand Clojure developers, is a prime example. It‚Äôs no coincidence they‚Äôre now responsible for the development of the language.</p><p>Regarding the adoption of new versions, things look surprisingly good. As many as 58% have already moved to Clojure 1.12, released in September 2024, which indicates that stability and a lack of painful breaking changes are quite a motivator.</p><p>Here we see that Java 21 LTS already has 54% of users, and Java 8 is losing ground in favor of newer versions (only 9% remain with the old-timer, which is better than in Java itself). Probably for this reason, Clojure plans to raise the base version in subsequent releases (much like Scala, but we‚Äôll talk about that next week).</p><p><a href=\"https://babashka.org/\" rel=\"\">Babashka</a></p><p>An example is Babashka ‚Äì a dialect that enjoys huge popularity (93% of respondents who use dialects had dealt with it) because it allows scripts to be run quickly, without the start-up delays of the JVM. ClojureDart, on the other hand, brings Clojure into the Dart ecosystem, opening new perspectives for web and mobile apps. Other projects like Squint, Jank, and Cherry demonstrate the community‚Äôs ongoing creativity ‚Äì each introduces its own modifications, often experimental, allowing the Clojure philosophy to adapt to entirely new conditions.</p><p>Leiningen and deps.edn continues to vie for space among dependency management tools ‚Äì we can see that deps.edn is gaining strength, and nRepl, REBL, and other plugins help make REPL feel like home.</p><p>A special section of the survey examines people who have just started their adventure with Clojure (less than a year of experience). The report has been tracking programmers‚Äô migration paths to Clojure for years. It appears they still largely come from Java, JavaScript, and Python. Ruby and C++ are in decline, whereas C# is starting to gain slightly ‚Äì perhaps thanks to the ‚Äúfunctional awakening‚Äù in the .NET ecosystem.</p><p><strong>Biggest challenges for newcomers?</strong></p><p>If you‚Äôve read this far, you‚Äôre probably as happy as I am to see that Clojure keeps evolving. On one hand ‚Äì a stable, mature platform, and on the other ‚Äì new dialects, a growing community not just in corporate settings but also in open-source projects and even in the gaming industry (yes, yes, I‚Äôve seen it!).

Essentially, it‚Äôs a mutex that ensures only one thread executes Python bytecode at a time, protecting internal data structures‚Äîespecially the reference counting used by the garbage collector‚Äîfrom race conditions. .</p><p>Excitingly, Python 3.13 is the first release featuring an experimental build mode that disables the GIL, opening the door to significant performance improvements for multi-threaded applications.</p><p>Before discussing these new changes, let‚Äôs do a quick recap of the pros and cons of the GIL.</p><p>The GIL offers several advantages, including:</p><ul><li><strong>Simplified Memory Management</strong>: By blocking threads from concurrently modifying an object‚Äôs reference count, the GIL prevents race conditions and ensures the garbage collector doesn‚Äôt free an object while it‚Äôs still referenced, making the core implementation simpler and more robust.</li><li><strong>Ease of C Extension Integration</strong>: Many C libraries and extensions, which are not inherently thread-safe, can be used safely under the GIL‚Äôs protection.</li><li><strong>Single-thread Performance</strong>: Since CPython uses reference counting for memory management, the garbage collector has minimal impact compared to mark-and-sweep algorithms used in languages - ex: Java -, which can be unpredictable and cause pauses.</li></ul><p>But if only one thread can use the interpreter at a given time, how does Python run multiple threads?</p><p>Thread switching is a complex topic; even the interpreter doesn‚Äôt always decide which thread runs next, as the operating system also influences scheduling. In this blog, we will focus solely on the Python side of thread management.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  what happens when a thread holds the GIL?\n</h3><p>When a thread holds the GIL, it may encounter one of the following scenarios:</p><ul><li>If it reaches an I/O task, the thread willingly releases the lock while waiting, allowing other threads to run.</li><li>During CPU-intensive operations, the lock is automatically released after a defined timeout (typically 5ms).</li></ul><p>Now that we understand how thread switching works, it‚Äôs clear that one of the main downsides of the GIL is limited true multi-threaded parallelism in CPU-bound programs. Removing the GIL requires a solution that grants safe, concurrent access to objects and memory management without compromising single-thread performance.</p><p>Sam Gross, the author of <a href=\"https://peps.python.org/pep-0703/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">PEP 703</a>, has proposed an ingenious solution to remove the GIL from CPython while ensuring thread safety. The proposal rethinks CPython‚Äôs memory management and introduces three key techniques:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Biased Reference Counting</strong>:\nMany objects are primarily modified by a single thread, so biased reference counting lets that thread update an object‚Äôs reference count without atomic overhead. If another thread intervenes, the system safely falls back to slower, thread-safe operations‚Äîoptimizing the common single-threaded case.</p></li><li><p><strong>Deferred Reference Counting</strong>:\nFor objects like top-level functions, code objects, modules, and methods that are accessed concurrently, deferred reference counting postpones immediate atomic updates. It batches reference count changes to reduce contention, thereby minimizing overhead for dynamic objects that aren‚Äôt immortal.</p></li><li><p>:\nCertain objects‚Äîsuch as interned strings, small integers, PyTypeObjects, and the True, False, and None‚Äîlive for the duration of the program. These are marked as immortal (their reference count is set to UINT32_MAX), so Py_INCREF and Py_DECREF become no-ops, avoiding contention when accessed by multiple threads.</p></li></ul><p>Together, these techniques pave the way for enhanced parallelism and a more efficient, concurrent CPython.</p><p>From the Steering Council‚Äôs notice about the adoption of PEP 703:</p><blockquote><ul><li>:\nWe will add the no-GIL build as an experimental build mode, presumably in Python 3.13 (if it slips to 3.14, that is not a problem). The build mode is experimental to clarify that, although the core developers support it, we cannot expect the community to adopt it immediately. We need time to determine the necessary changes in API design, packaging, and distribution, and we want to discourage distributors from shipping the experimental no-GIL build as the default interpreter.</li><li>:\nOnce there is sufficient community support for production use of no-GIL, we will support the no-GIL build‚Äîbut not as the default‚Äîwhile setting a target date or Python version for making it the default. This timing will depend on factors such as backward compatibility of API changes (e.g., the stable ABI) and the remaining work identified by the community. We expect this phase to take at least a year or two, possibly more. Some distributors may start shipping no-GIL by default, though this will vary with package support.</li><li>:\nOur goal is for no-GIL to become the default, eventually removing any vestiges of the GIL without unnecessarily breaking backward compatibility. We do not want to maintain two common build modes indefinitely, as this can double testing resources and debugging efforts. However, the transition cannot be rushed and may take as much as five years.</li></ul></blockquote><p>The move to remove the GIL marks a major evolution in CPython‚Äôs design. By rethinking memory management with biased and deferred reference counting, plus immortal objects, PEP 703 offers a practical path to better multi-threaded performance without losing single-thread efficiency. As Python gradually shifts toward a no-GIL future, we can look forward to an interpreter that‚Äôs more capable on today‚Äôs multi-core systems.</p>","contentLength":5509,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Show HN: Immersive Gaussian Splat experience of Sutro Tower, San Francisco","url":"https://vincentwoo.com/3d/sutro_tower/","date":1740087559,"author":"akanet","guid":7456,"unread":true,"content":"<p>Welcome to my 3D model of San Francisco's Sutro Tower.

This is mainly to avoid&nbsp;, where different environments need different versions of the same&nbsp;(a package required to run another package).</p><p>In addition, large, compiled binaries like&nbsp;<a href=\"https://opencv.org/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">OpenCV</a>&nbsp;may require&nbsp;&nbsp;in the environment‚Äôs directory, and each environment requires a copy of the Python interpreter (at 100‚Äì200 MB). All these issues can bloat conda environments to several gigabytes.</p><p>In this&nbsp;<em>Quick Success Data Science</em>&nbsp;project, we‚Äôll look at some techniques for reducing the storage requirements for conda environments, including those stored in default locations and dedicated folders.</p><h2>Memory Management Techniques</h2><p>Below are some <a href=\"https://towardsdatascience.com/tag/memory-management/\" title=\"Memory Management\">Memory Management</a> techniques that will help you reduce conda‚Äôs storage footprint on your machine. We‚Äôll discuss each in turn.</p><ol><li>Sharing task-based environments</li><li>Archiving with environment and specifications files</li><li>Archiving environments with conda-pack</li><li>Storing environments on an external drive</li><li>Relocating the package cache</li><li>Using virtual environments ()</li></ol><h3>1. Cleaning the Package Cache</h3><p>Cleaning the package cache is the first and easiest step for freeing up memory. Even after deleting environments, conda keeps the related package files in the cache. You can free up space by removing these unused packages and their associated&nbsp;&nbsp;(compressed package files), logs,&nbsp;&nbsp;(metadata stored in conda), and temporary files.</p><p>Conda permits an optional ‚Äúdry run‚Äù to see how much memory will be reclaimed. You‚Äôll want to run this from either the terminal or Anaconda Prompt in your&nbsp;&nbsp;environment:</p><pre><code>conda clean --all --dry-run</code></pre><p>Here‚Äôs how this looks on my machine:</p><p>This process trimmed a healthy 6.28 GB and took several minutes to run.</p><h3>2. Sharing Task-based Environments</h3><p>Creating a few environments for&nbsp;&nbsp;‚Äî like computer vision or geospatial work ‚Äî is more memory efficient than using dedicated environments for each&nbsp;. These environments would include basic packages plus ones for the specific task (such as OpenCV, scikit-image, and PIL for computer vision).</p><p>An advantage of this approach is that you can easily keep all the packages up to date and link the environments to multiple projects. However, this won‚Äôt work if some projects require different versions of the shared packages.</p><h3>3. Archiving with Environment and Specifications Files</h3><p>If you don‚Äôt have enough storage sites or want to preserve legacy projects efficiently, consider using&nbsp;&nbsp;or&nbsp;files. These small files record an environment‚Äôs&nbsp;, allowing you to rebuild it later.</p><p>Saving conda environments in this manner reduces their size on disk from gigabytes to a few kilobytes. Of course, you‚Äôll have to recreate the environment to use it. So, you‚Äôll want to avoid this technique if you frequently revisit projects that link to the archived environments.</p><blockquote><p>NOTE: Consider using&nbsp;<a href=\"https://mamba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Mamba</a>, a drop-in replacement for conda, for faster rebuilds. As the docs say, ‚ÄúIf you know conda, you know Mamba!‚Äù</p></blockquote><p>&nbsp;An&nbsp;&nbsp;is a small file that lists all the packages and versions installed in an environment, including those installed using Python‚Äôs package installer (<a href=\"https://pypi.org/project/pip/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">pip</a>). This helps you both restore an environment and share it with others.</p><p>The environment file is written in&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"></a>&nbsp;(), a human-readable data-serialization format for data storage. To generate an environment file, you must activate and then export the environment. Here‚Äôs how to make a file for an environment named&nbsp;:</p><pre><code> conda activate my_env\n conda env export &gt; my_env.yml</code></pre><p>You can name the file any valid filename but be careful as an existing file with the same name will be overwritten.</p><p>By default, the environment file is written to the&nbsp;directory. Here‚Äôs a truncated example of the file‚Äôs contents:</p><pre><code>name: C:\\Users\\hanna\\quick_success\\fed_hikes\\fed_env\nchannels:\n  - defaults\n  - conda-forge\ndependencies:\n  - asttokens=2.0.5=pyhd3eb1b0_0\n  - backcall=0.2.0=pyhd3eb1b0_0\n  - blas=1.0=mkl\n  - bottleneck=1.3.4=py310h9128911_0\n  - brotli=1.0.9=ha925a31_2\n  - bzip2=1.0.8=he774522_0\n  - ca-certificates=2022.4.26=haa95532_0\n  - certifi=2022.5.18.1=py310haa95532_0\n  - colorama=0.4.4=pyhd3eb1b0_0\n  - cycler=0.11.0=pyhd3eb1b0_0\n  - debugpy=1.5.1=py310hd77b12b_0\n  - decorator=5.1.1=pyhd3eb1b0_0\n  - entrypoints=0.4=py310haa95532_0\n\n  ------SNIP------</code></pre><p>You can now remove your conda environment and reproduce it again with this file. To remove an environment, first deactivate it and then run the&nbsp;&nbsp;command (where&nbsp;&nbsp;is the name of your environment):</p><pre><code>conda deactivate\nconda remove -n ENVNAME --all</code></pre><p>If the conda environment exists outside of Anaconda‚Äôs default&nbsp;&nbsp;folder, then include the directory path to the environment, as so:</p><pre><code>conda remove -p PATH\\ENVNAME --all</code></pre><p>Note that this archiving technique will only work perfectly if you continue to use the same operating system, such as Windows or macOS. This is because solving for dependencies can introduce packages that might not be compatible across platforms.</p><p>To restore a conda environment using a file, run the following, where&nbsp;&nbsp;represents your conda environment name and&nbsp;&nbsp;represents your environment file:</p><pre><code> conda env create -n my_env -f \\directory\\path\\to\\environment.yml</code></pre><p>You can also use the environment file to recreate the environment on your D: drive. Just provide the new path when using the file. Here‚Äôs an example:</p><pre><code>conda create --prefix D:\\my_envs\\my_new_env --file environment.yml</code></pre><p>For more on environment files, including how to manually produce them, visit the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">docs</a>.</p><p><strong>Using Specifications Files:&nbsp;</strong>If you haven‚Äôt installed any packages using pip, you can use a&nbsp;&nbsp;to reproduce a conda environment on the same operating system. To create a specification file, activate an environment, such as&nbsp;, and enter the following command:</p><pre><code> conda list --explicit &gt; exp_spec_list.txt</code></pre><p>This produces the following output, truncated for brevity:</p><pre><code> # This file may be used to create an environment using:\n # $ conda create --name &lt;env&gt; --file &lt;this file&gt;\n # platform: win-64\n @EXPLICIT\n https://conda.anaconda.org/conda-forge/win-64/ca-certificates-202x.xx.x-h5b45459_0.tar.bz2\n https://conda.anaconda.org/conda-forge/noarch/tzdata-202xx-he74cb21_0.tar.bz2\n\n------snip------</code></pre><p>Note that the&nbsp;&nbsp;flag ensures that the targeted platform is annotated in the file, in this case,&nbsp;&nbsp;in the third line.</p><p>You can now remove the environment as described in the previous section.</p><p>To re-create&nbsp;&nbsp;using this text file, run the following with a proper directory path:</p><pre><code>conda create -n my_env -f \\directory\\path\\to\\exp_spec_list.txt</code></pre><h3>4. Archiving Environments with conda-pack</h3><p>The&nbsp;&nbsp;command lets you archive a conda environment before removing it. It packs the entire environment into a compressed archive with the extension:&nbsp;. It‚Äôs handy for backing up, sharing, and moving environments without the need to reinstall packages.</p><p>The following command will preserve an environment but remove it from your system (where&nbsp;&nbsp;represents the name of your environment):</p><pre><code>conda install -c conda-forge conda-pack\nconda pack -n my_env -o my_env.tar.gz</code></pre><p>To restore the environment later run this command:</p><pre><code>mkdir my_env &amp;&amp; tar -xzf my_env.tar.gz -C my_env</code></pre><p>This technique won‚Äôt save as much memory as the text file option. However, you won‚Äôt need to re-download packages when restoring an environment, which means it can be used without internet access.</p><h3>5. Storing Environments on an External Drive</h3><p>By default, conda stores all environments in a default location. For Windows, this is under the&nbsp;&nbsp;folder. You can see these environments by running the command&nbsp;&nbsp;in a prompt window or terminal. Here‚Äôs how it looks on my C: drive (this is a truncated view):</p><p><strong>Using a Single Environments Folder:</strong>&nbsp;If your system supports an external or secondary drive, you can configure conda to store environments there to free up space on your primary disk. Here‚Äôs the command; you‚Äôll need to substitute your specific path:</p><pre><code>conda config --set envs_dirs /path/to/external/drive</code></pre><p>If you enter a path to your D drive, such as&nbsp;, conda will create new environments at this location.</p><p>This technique works well when your external drive is a fast SSD and when you‚Äôre storing packages with large dependencies, like TensorFlow. The downside is slower performance. If your OS and notebooks remain on the primary drive, you may experience some read/write latency when running Python.</p><p>In addition, some OS settings may power down idle external drives, adding a delay when they spin back up. Tools like Jupyter may struggle to locate conda environments if the drive letter changes, so you‚Äôll want to use a fixed drive letter and ensure that the correct kernel paths are set.</p><p><strong>Using Multiple Environment Folders:</strong>&nbsp;Instead of using a single&nbsp;&nbsp;directory for&nbsp;&nbsp;environments, you can store each environment inside its respective&nbsp;&nbsp;folder. This lets you store everything related to a project in one place.</p><p>For example, suppose you have a project on your Windows D: drive in a folder called&nbsp;. To place the project‚Äôs conda environment in this folder, loaded with&nbsp;&nbsp;for JupyterLab, you would run:</p><pre><code>conda create -p D:\\projects\\geospatial\\env ipykernel</code></pre><p>Of course, you can call&nbsp;&nbsp;something more descriptive, like&nbsp;.</p><p>As with the previous example, environments stored on a different disk can cause performance issues.</p><p><strong>Special Note on JupyterLab:</strong>&nbsp;Depending on how you launch JupyterLab, its default behavior may be to open in your&nbsp;&nbsp;directory (such as,&nbsp;). Since its file browser is restricted to the directory from which it is launched, you won‚Äôt see directories on other drives like&nbsp;. There are many ways to handle this, but one of the simplest is to launch JupyterLab from the D: drive.</p><p>For example, in Anaconda Prompt, type:</p><p>Now, you will be able to pick from kernels on the D: drive.</p><p>For more options on changing JupyterLab‚Äôs working directory, ask an AI about ‚Äúhow to change Jupyter‚Äôs default working directory‚Äù or ‚Äúhow to create a Symlink to&nbsp;&nbsp;in your user folder.‚Äù</p><p><strong>Moving Existing Environments:</strong>&nbsp;You should never manually move a conda environment, such as by cutting and pasting to a new location. This is because conda relies on internal paths and metadata that can become invalid with location changes.</p><p>Instead, you should&nbsp;existing environments to another drive. This will&nbsp;&nbsp;the environment, so you‚Äôll need to manually remove it from its original location.</p><p>In the following example, we use the&nbsp;&nbsp;flag to produce an exact copy of a C: drive environment (called&nbsp;) on the D: drive:</p><pre><code>conda create -p D:\\new_envs\\my_env --clone C:\\path\\to\\old\\env</code></pre><blockquote><p>&nbsp;Consider exporting your environment to a&nbsp;&nbsp;file (as described in Section 3 above) before cloning. This allows you to recreate the environment if something goes wrong with the clone procedure.</p></blockquote><p>Now, when you run&nbsp;, you‚Äôll see the environment listed in both the C: and D: drives. You can remove the old environment by running the following command in the&nbsp;environment:</p><pre><code>conda remove --name my_env --all -y</code></pre><p>Again, latency issues may affect these setups if you‚Äôre working across two disks.</p><p>You may be wondering, is it better to move a conda environment using an environment (YAML) file or to use? The short answer is that&nbsp;&nbsp;is the best and fastest option for moving an environment to a different drive on the&nbsp;&nbsp;machine. An environment file is best for recreating the same environment on a&nbsp;machine. While the file guarantees a consistent environment across different systems, it can take much longer to run, especially with large environments.</p><h3>6. Relocating the Package Cache</h3><p>If your primary drive is low on space, you can move the package cache to a larger external or secondary drive using this command:</p><pre><code>conda config --set pkgs_dirs D:\\conda_pkgs</code></pre><p>In this example, packages are now stored on the D drive () instead of the default location.</p><p>If you‚Äôre working in your primary drive and both drives are SSD, then latency issues should not be significant. However, if one of the drives is a slower HDD, you can experience slowdowns when creating or updating environments. If D: is an external drive connected by USB, you may see significant slowdowns for large environments.</p><p>You can mitigate some of these issues by keeping the package cache () and frequently used environments on the faster SSD, and other environments on the slower HDD.</p><p>One last thing to consider is&nbsp;. Primary drives may have routine backups scheduled but secondary or external drives may not. This puts you at risk of losing all your environments.</p><h3>7. Using Virtual Environments</h3><p>If your project doesn‚Äôt require conda‚Äôs extensive package management system for handling heavy dependencies (like TensorFlow or GDAL), you can significantly reduce disk usage with a Python&nbsp;&nbsp;(). This represents a lightweight alternative to a conda environment.</p><p>To create a&nbsp;&nbsp;named&nbsp;, run the following command:</p><p>This type of environment has a small base installation. A minimal conda environment takes up about 200 MB and includes multiple utilities, such as&nbsp;,&nbsp;,&nbsp;, and so on. A&nbsp;&nbsp;is much lighter, with a minimum install size of only 5‚Äì10 MB.</p><p>Conda also caches package tarballs in&nbsp;. These tarballs can grow to several GBs over time. Because&nbsp;&nbsp;installs packages directly into the environment, no extra copies are preserved.</p><p>In general, you‚Äôll want to consider&nbsp;&nbsp;when you only need basic Python packages like NumPy, pandas, or Scikit-learn. Packages for which conda is strongly recommended, like Geopandas, should still be placed in a conda environment. If you use lots of environments, you‚Äôll probably want to stick with conda and benefit from its package linking.</p><p>You can find details on how to activate and use Python virtual environments in the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">docs</a>.</p><p>High impact/low disruption memory management techniques for conda environments include cleaning the package cache and storing little-used environments as YAML or text files. These methods can save many gigabytes of memory while retaining Anaconda‚Äôs default directory structure.</p><p>Other high impact methods include moving the package cache and/or conda environments to a secondary or external drive. This will resolve memory problems but may introduce latency issues, especially if the new drive is a slow HDD or uses a USB connection.</p><p>For simple environments, you can use a Python virtual environment () as a lightweight alternative to conda.<a href=\"https://medium.com/@lee_vaughan?source=post_page---post_author_info--3aa2791a7623---------------------------------------\"></a></p>","contentLength":15200,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"[R] Detecting LLM Hallucinations using Information Theory","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1iu9ryi/r_detecting_llm_hallucinations_using_information/","date":1740086564,"author":"/u/meltingwaxcandle","guid":7496,"unread":true,"content":"<p>LLM hallucinations and errors are a major challenge, but what if we could predict when they happen?

The output should look like this:</p><figure><code><pre>$ go get github.com/kr/text\n<samp>go: downloading github.com/kr/text v0.2.0\ngo: added github.com/kr/text v0.2.0</samp>\n$ go run .\n<samp>This is an informational\nmessage that should be\nwrapped.</samp></pre></code></figure><p>Go 1.24 introduces the  flag for , which you can use like this:</p><figure><code><pre>go get -tool import_path@version\n</pre></code></figure><p>This command will download the package specified by the import path (along with any child dependencies), store them in your module cache, and record them in your  file. The  part is optional ‚Äì if you omit it, the latest version will be downloaded.</p><p>Let's use this to add the latest versions of  and  to our module as developer tools, along with  version .</p><figure><code><pre>$ go get -tool golang.org/x/tools/cmd/stringer\n<samp>go: downloading golang.org/x/tools v0.30.0\ngo: downloading golang.org/x/sync v0.11.0\ngo: downloading golang.org/x/mod v0.23.0\ngo: added golang.org/x/mod v0.23.0\ngo: added golang.org/x/sync v0.11.0\ngo: added golang.org/x/tools v0.30.0</samp>\n\n$ go get -tool golang.org/x/vuln/cmd/govulncheck\n<samp>go: downloading golang.org/x/vuln v1.1.4\ngo: downloading golang.org/x/telemetry v0.0.0-20240522233618-39ace7a40ae7\ngo: downloading golang.org/x/sys v0.30.0\ngo: upgraded golang.org/x/telemetry v0.0.0-20240521205824-bda55230c457 =&gt; v0.0.0-20240522233618-39ace7a40ae7\ngo: added golang.org/x/vuln v1.1.4</samp>\n\n$ go get -tool honnef.co/go/tools/cmd/staticcheck@v0.5.1\n<samp>go: downloading honnef.co/go/tools v0.5.1\ngo: downloading golang.org/x/exp/typeparams v0.0.0-20231108232855-2478ac86f678\ngo: downloading github.com/BurntSushi/toml v1.4.1-0.20240526193622-a339e1f7089c\ngo: downloading golang.org/x/exp v0.0.0-20231110203233-9a3e6036ecaa\ngo: added github.com/BurntSushi/toml v1.4.1-0.20240526193622-a339e1f7089c\ngo: added golang.org/x/exp/typeparams v0.0.0-20231108232855-2478ac86f678\ngo: added honnef.co/go/tools v0.5.1</samp></pre></code></figure><p>After running these, your  file will now include a  section listing the tools you've added.

For example, let's say that your application code depends on  version , and is tested and known to work with that version. Then if you add a tool that relies on a  version of , the version number in your  file will be bumped to the newer version and your application code will use that newer version too.</p><p>In theory, this  be a problem so long as all your dependencies and their child dependencies are stable, follow strict semantic versioning, and don't make backwards-incompatible changes without a major version increment. But, of course, the real world is messy and backwards-incompatible changes  happen, which could unexpectedly break your application code.</p><p>It's worth noting that this issue isn't limited to tool dependencies ‚Äì the same thing can happen if your application code and a non-tool dependency both rely on the same package. However, including tools in  increases the risk.</p><p>To reduce this risk, you can use a separate modfile for tool dependencies instead of including them in your main .

I just set up a basic geoblock with Nginx on Debian. This is all stuff you can piece together, but the Maxmind and Nginx docs are a little vague about the details, so I figure it‚Äôs worth an actual writeup. My Nginx expertise is ~15 years out of date, so this might not be The Best Way to do things. YMMV.</p><p>First, register for a free <a href=\"https://www.maxmind.com/en/geolite2/signup\">MaxMind account</a>; you‚Äôll need this to subscribe to their GeoIP database. Then set up a daemon to maintain a copy of the lookup file locally, and Nginx‚Äôs GeoIP2 module:</p><pre><code>apt install geoipupdate libnginx-mod-http-geoip2\n</code></pre><p>Create a license key on the MaxMind site, and download a copy of the config file you‚Äôll need. Drop that in . It‚Äôll look like:</p><pre><code>AccountID XXXX\nLicenseKey XXXX\nEditionIDs GeoLite2-Country\n</code></pre><p>The package sets up a cron job automatically, but we should grab an initial copy of the file. This takes a couple minutes, and writes out <code>/var/lib/GeoIP/GeoLite2-Country-mmdb</code>:</p><p>The GeoIP2 module should already be loaded via <code>/etc/nginx/modules-enabled/50-mod-http-geoip2.conf</code>. Add a new config snippet like <code>/etc/nginx/conf.d/geoblock.conf</code>. The first part tells Nginx where to find the GeoIP database file, and then extracts the two-letter ISO country code for each request as a variable. The  part sets up an  variable, which is set to  for GB, otherwise .</p><pre><code>geoip2 /var/lib/GeoIP/GeoLite2-Country.mmdb {\n  $geoip2_data_country_iso_code country iso_code;\n}\n\nmap $geoip2_data_country_iso_code $osa_geoblocked {\n  GB      1;\n  default 0;\n}\n</code></pre><p>Write an HTML file somewhere like <code>/var/www/custom_errors/osa.html</code>, explaining the block. Then serve that page for HTTP 451 status codes: in <code>/etc/nginx/sites-enabled/whatever</code>, add:</p><pre><code>server {\n  ...\n  # UK OSA error page\n  error_page 451 /osa.html;\n  location /osa.html {\n    internal;\n    root /var/www/custom_errors/;\n  }\n\n  # When geoblocked, return 451\n  location / {\n    if ($osa_geoblocked = 1) {\n      return 451;\n    }\n  }\n}\n</code></pre><p>Test your config with , and then . You can test how things look from the UK using a VPN service, or something like <a href=\"https://www.locabrowser.com/\">locabrowser</a>.</p><p>This is, to be clear, a bad solution. MaxMind‚Äôs free database is not particularly precise, and in general IP lookup tables are chasing a moving target. I know for a fact that there are people in non-UK countries (like Ireland!) who have been inadvertently blocked by these lookup tables. Making those people use Tor or a VPN , but I don‚Äôt know what else to do in the current regulatory environment.</p>","contentLength":2491,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"N19-Crypt and N19-Chain: Development of a cryptographic algorithm,a blockchain prototype inspired by the number 19 from Quran","url":"https://dev.to/inquisitive41/n19-crypt-and-n19-chain-development-of-a-cryptographic-algorithma-blockchain-prototype-inspired-a9h","date":1740080053,"author":"Inquisitive41","guid":7385,"unread":true,"content":"<p>Liquid syntax error: Variable '{{sender, receiver, amount}' was not properly terminated with regexp: /\\}\\}/</p>","contentLength":107,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Rate my photo manipulation tool","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1iu6pch/rate_my_photo_manipulation_tool/","date":1740079001,"author":"/u/tunerhd","guid":7513,"unread":true,"content":"   submitted by   <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/tunerhd\"> /u/tunerhd </a>","contentLength":30,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"AI can fix bugs‚Äîbut can‚Äôt find them: OpenAI‚Äôs study highlights limits of LLMs in software engineering","url":"https://venturebeat.com/ai/ai-can-fix-bugs-but-cant-find-them-openais-study-highlights-limits-of-llms-in-software-engineering/","date":1740078804,"author":"/u/F0urLeafCl0ver","guid":8473,"unread":true,"content":"<div><p><em>Join our daily and weekly newsletters for the latest updates and exclusive content on industry-leading AI coverage. <a href=\"https://venturebeat.com/newsletters/?utm_source=VBsite&amp;utm_medium=desktopNav\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"https://venturebeat.com/newsletters/?utm_source=VBsite&amp;utm_medium=desktopNav\">Learn More</a></em></p></div><p>In a <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.12115\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">new paper</a>, <a href=\"https://openai.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">OpenAI</a> researchers detail how they developed an LLM benchmark called SWE-Lancer to test how much foundation models can earn from real-life freelance software engineering tasks.

While they can help solve bugs, they‚Äôre not quite at the level where they can start earning freelancing cash by themselves.&nbsp;</p><h2>Benchmarking freelancing models</h2><p>The researchers and 100 other professional software engineers identified potential tasks on Upwork and, without changing any words, fed these to a Docker container to create the SWE-Lancer dataset. The container does not have internet access and cannot access GitHub ‚Äúto avoid the possible of models scraping code diffs or pull request details,‚Äù they explained. </p><p>The team identified 764 individual contributor tasks, totaling about $414,775, ranging from 15-minute bug fixes to weeklong feature requests. These tasks, which included reviewing freelancer proposals and job postings, would pay out $585,225.</p><p>The tasks were added to the expensing platform Expensify.&nbsp;</p><p>The researchers generated prompts based on the task title and description and a snapshot of the codebase. If there were additional proposals to resolve the issue, ‚Äúwe also generated a management task using the issue description and list of proposals,‚Äù they explained. </p><p>From here, the researchers moved to end-to-end test development. They wrote Playwright tests for each task that applies these generated patches which were then ‚Äútriple-verified‚Äù by professional software engineers.</p><p>‚ÄúTests simulate real-world user flows, such as logging into the application, performing complex actions (making financial transactions) and verifying that the model‚Äôs solution works as expected,‚Äù the paper explains.&nbsp;</p><p>After running the test, the researchers found that none of the models earned the full $1 million value of the tasks. Claude 3.5 Sonnet, the best-performing model, earned only $208,050 and resolved 26.2% of the individual contributor issues. However, the researchers point out, ‚Äúthe majority of its solutions are incorrect, and higher reliability is needed for trustworthy deployment.‚Äù</p><p>The models performed well across most individual contributor tasks, with Claude 3.5-Sonnet performing best, followed by o1 and GPT-4o.&nbsp;</p><p>‚ÄúAgents excel at localizing, but fail to root cause, resulting in partial or flawed solutions,‚Äù the report explains. ‚ÄúAgents pinpoint the source of an issue remarkably quickly, using keyword searches across the whole repository to quickly locate the relevant file and functions ‚Äî often far faster than a human would. However, they often exhibit a limited understanding of how the issue spans multiple components or files, and fail to address the root cause, leading to solutions that are incorrect or insufficiently comprehensive. We rarely find cases where the agent aims to reproduce the issue or fails due to not finding the right file or location to edit.‚Äù</p><p>Interestingly, the models all performed better on manager tasks that required reasoning to evaluate technical understanding.</p><p>These benchmark tests showed that AI models can solve some ‚Äúlow-level‚Äù coding problems and can‚Äôt replace ‚Äúlow-level‚Äù software engineers yet.

As data demands continue to surge, the emergence of <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/ai/generative-ai/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">generative AI</a> models presents an innovative solution. These <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/large-language-model/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">large language models</a> (LLMs), trained on expansive data corpora, possess the remarkable capability to generate new content across multiple media formats‚Äîtext, audio, and video‚Äîand across various business domains, based on provided prompts and inputs.</p><p>In this post, we explore how you can use these LLMs with advanced <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/retrieval-augmented-generation/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Retrieval Augmented Generation</a> (RAG) to generate high-quality synthetic data for a finance domain use case. You can use the same technique for synthetic data for other business domain use cases as well. For this post, we demonstrate how to generate counterparty risk (CR) data, which would be beneficial for over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives that are traded directly between two parties, without going through a formal exchange.</p><p>OTC derivatives are typically customized contracts between counterparties and include a variety of financial instruments, such as forwards, options, swaps, and other structured products. A counterparty is the other party involved in a financial transaction. In the context of OTC derivatives, the counterparty refers to the entity (such as a bank, financial institution, corporation, or individual) with whom a derivative contract is made.</p><p>For example, in an OTC swap or option contract, one entity agrees to terms with another party, and each entity becomes the counterparty to the other. The responsibilities, obligations, and risks (such as credit risk) are shared between these two entities according to the contract.</p><p>As financial institutions continue to navigate the complex landscape of CR, the need for accurate and reliable risk assessment models has become paramount. For our use case, ABC Bank, a fictional financial services organization, has taken on the challenge of developing an ML model to assess the risk of a given counterparty based on their exposure to OTC derivative data.</p><p>Building such a model presents numerous challenges. Although ABC Bank has gathered a large dataset from various sources and in different formats, the data may be biased, skewed, or lack the diversity needed to train a highly accurate model. The primary challenge lies in collecting and preprocessing the data to make it suitable for training an ML model. Deploying a poorly suited model could result in misinformed decisions and significant financial losses.</p><p>We propose a generative AI solution that uses the RAG approach. RAG is a widely used approach that enhances LLMs by supplying extra information from external data sources not included in their original training. The entire solution can be broadly divided into three steps: indexing, data generation, and validation.</p><p>In the indexing step, we parse, chunk, and convert the representative CR data into vector format using the <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/amazon-models/titan/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Amazon Titan Text Embeddings V2</a> model and store this information in a Chroma vector database. Chroma is an open source vector database known for its ease of use, efficient similarity search, and support for multimodal data and metadata. It offers both in-memory and persistent storage options, integrates well with popular ML frameworks, and is suitable for a wide range of AI applications. It is particularly beneficial for smaller to medium-sized datasets and projects requiring local deployment or low resource usage. The following diagram illustrates this architecture.</p><p>Here are the steps for data indexing:</p><ul><li>The sample CR data is segmented into smaller, manageable chunks to optimize it for embedding generation.</li><li>These segmented data chunks are then passed to a method responsible for both generating embeddings and storing them efficiently.</li><li>The Amazon Titan Text Embeddings V2 API is called upon to generate high-quality embeddings from the prepared data chunks.</li><li>The resulting embeddings are then stored in the Chroma vector database, providing efficient retrieval and similarity searches for future use.</li></ul><p>When the user requests data for a certain scenario, the request is converted into vector format and then looked up in the Chroma database to find matches with the stored data. The retrieved data is augmented with the user request and additional prompts to <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/claude/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Anthropic‚Äôs Claude Haiku</a> on <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/claude/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Amazon Bedrock</a>. Anthropic‚Äôs Claude Haiku was chosen primarily for its speed, processing over 21,000 tokens per second, which significantly outpaces its peers. Moreover, Anthropic‚Äôs Claude Haiku‚Äôs efficiency in data generation is remarkable, with a <a href=\"https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-3-haiku\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">1:5 input-to-output token ratio</a>. This means it can generate a large volume of data from a relatively small amount of input or context. This capability not only enhances the model‚Äôs effectiveness, but also makes it cost-efficient for our application, where we need to generate numerous data samples from a limited set of examples. Anthropic‚Äôs Claude Haiku LLM is invoked iteratively to efficiently manage token consumption and help prevent reaching the maximum token limit. The following diagram illustrates this workflow.</p><p>Here are the steps for data generation:</p><ul><li>The user initiates a request to generate new synthetic counterparty risk data based on specific criteria.</li><li>The Amazon Titan Text Embeddings V2 LLM is employed to create embeddings for the user‚Äôs request prompts, transforming them into a machine-interpretable format.</li><li>These newly generated embeddings are then forwarded to a specialized module designed to identify matching stored data.</li><li>The Chroma vector database, which houses previously stored embeddings, is queried to find data that closely matches the user‚Äôs request.</li><li>The identified matching data and the original user prompts are then passed to a module responsible for generating new synthetic data.</li><li>Anthropic‚Äôs Claude Haiku 3.0 model is invoked, using both the matching embeddings and user prompts as input to create high-quality synthetic data.</li><li>The generated synthetic data is then parsed and formatted into a .csv file using the Pydantic library, providing a structured and validated output.</li><li>To confirm the quality of the generated data, several statistical methods are applied, including quantile-quantile (Q-Q) plots and correlation heat maps of key attributes, providing a comprehensive validation process.</li></ul><p>When validating the synthetic CR data generated by the LLM, we employed Q-Q plots and correlation heat maps focusing on key attributes such as , , and . These statistical tools serve crucial roles in promoting the quality and representativeness of the synthetic data. By using the Q-Q plots, we can assess whether these attributes follow a normal distribution, which is often expected in many clinical and financial variables. By comparing the quantiles of our synthetic data against theoretical normal distributions, we can identify significant deviations that might indicate bias or unrealistic data generation.</p><p>Simultaneously, the correlation heat maps provide a visual representation of the relationships between these attributes and others in the dataset. This is particularly important because it helps verify that the LLM has maintained the complex interdependencies typically observed in real CR data. For instance, we would expect certain correlations between exposure and replacement cost, or between replacement cost and settlement risk. By making sure these correlations are preserved in our synthetic data, we can be more confident that analyses or models built on this data will yield insights that are applicable to real-world scenarios. This rigorous validation process helps to mitigate the risk of introducing artificial patterns or biases, thereby enhancing the reliability and utility of our synthetic CR dataset for subsequent research or modeling tasks.</p><p>We‚Äôve created a Jupyter notebook containing three parts to implement the key components of the solution. We provide code snippets from the notebooks for better understanding.</p><p>To set up the solution and generate test data, you should have the following prerequisites:</p><ul><li>Python 3 must be installed on your machine</li><li>We recommend that an integrated development environment (IDE) that can run Jupyter notebooks be installed</li><li>You can also create a Jupyter notebook instance using Amazon SageMaker from AWS console and develop the code there.</li><li>You need to have an AWS account with access to Amazon Bedrock and the following LLMs enabled (be careful not to share the AWS account credentials): \n  <ul><li>Amazon Titan Text Embeddings V2</li><li>Anthropic‚Äôs Claude 3 Haiku</li></ul></li></ul><p>Here are the steps to setup the environment.</p><pre><code>import sys!{sys.executable} -m pip install -r requirements.txt</code></pre><p>The content of the requirements.txt is given here.</p><pre><code>boto3\nlangchain\nlangchain-community\nstreamlit\nchromadb==0.4.15\nnumpy\njq\nlangchain-aws\nseaborn\nmatplotlib\nscipy</code></pre><p>The following code snippet will perform all the necessary imports.</p><pre><code>from pprint import pprint \nfrom uuid import uuid4 \nimport chromadb \nfrom langchain_community.document_loaders import JSONLoader \nfrom langchain_community.embeddings import BedrockEmbeddings\nfrom langchain_community.vectorstores import Chroma \nfrom langchain_text_splitters import RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter</code></pre><h3>Index data in the Chroma database</h3><p>In this section, we show how indexing of data is done in a Chroma database as a locally maintained open source vector store. This index data is used as context for generating data.</p><p>The following code snippet shows the preprocessing steps of loading the JSON data from a file and splitting it into smaller chunks:</p><pre><code>def load_using_jsonloaer(path):\n    loader = JSONLoader(path,\n                            jq_schema=\".[]\",\n                            text_content=False)\n    documents = loader.load()\n    return documents\n\ndef split_documents(documents):\n    doc_list = [item for item in documents]\n    text_splitter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=1200, chunk_overlap=0)\n    texts = text_splitter.split_documents(doc_list)\n    return texts</code></pre><p>The following snippet shows how an Amazon Bedrock embedding instance is created. We used the Amazon Titan Embeddings V2 model:</p><pre><code>def get_bedrock_embeddings():\n    aws_region = \"us-east-1\"\n    model_id = \"amazon.titan-embed-text-v2:0\" #look for latest version of model\n    bedrock_embeddings = BedrockEmbeddings(model_id=model_id, region_name=aws_region)\n    return bedrock_embeddings</code></pre><p>The following code shows how the embeddings are created and then loaded in the Chroma database:</p><pre><code>persistent_client = chromadb.PersistentClient(path=\"../data/chroma_index\")\ncollection = persistent_client.get_or_create_collection(\"test_124\")\nprint(collection)\n    #     query the database\nvector_store_with_persistent_client = Chroma(collection_name=\"test_124\",\n                                                 persist_directory=\"../data/chroma_index\",\n                                                 embedding_function=get_bedrock_embeddings(),\n                                                 client=persistent_client)\nload_json_and_index(vector_store_with_persistent_client)</code></pre><p>The following code snippet shows the configuration used during the LLM invocation using Amazon Bedrock APIs. The LLM used is Anthropic‚Äôs Claude 3 Haiku:</p><pre><code>config = Config(\n    region_name='us-east-1',\n    signature_version='v4',\n    retries={\n        'max_attempts': 2,\n        'mode': 'standard'\n    }\n)\nbedrock_runtime = boto3.client('bedrock-runtime', config=config)\nmodel_id = \"anthropic.claude-3-haiku-20240307-v1:0\" #look for latest version of model\nmodel_kwrgs = {\n    \"temperature\": 0,\n    \"max_tokens\": 8000,\n    \"top_p\": 1.0,\n    \"top_k\": 25,\n    \"stop_sequences\": [\"company-1000\"],\n}\n# Initialize the language model\nllm = ChatBedrock(\n    model_id=model_id,\n    model_kwargs=model_kwrgs,\n    client=bedrock_runtime,\n)</code></pre><p>The following code shows how the context is fetched by looking up the Chroma database (where data was indexed) for matching embeddings. We use the same Amazon Titan model to generate the embeddings:</p><pre><code>def get_context(scenario):\n    region_name = 'us-east-1'\n    credential_profile_name = \"default\"\n    titan_model_id = \"amazon.titan-embed-text-v2:0\"\n    kb_context = []\n    be = BedrockEmbeddings(region_name=region_name,\n                           credentials_profile_name=credential_profile_name,\n                           model_id=titan_model_id)\n\n    vector_store = Chroma(collection_name=\"test_124\", persist_directory=\"../data/chroma_index\",\n                      embedding_function=be)\n    search_results = vector_store.similarity_search(scenario, k=3)\n    for doc in search_results:\n        kb_context.append(doc.page_content)\n    return json.dumps(kb_context)</code></pre><p>The following snippet shows how we formulated the detailed prompt that was passed to the LLM. We provided examples for the context, scenario, start index, end index, records count, and other parameters. The prompt is subjective and can be adjusted for experimentation.</p><pre><code># Create a prompt template\nprompt_template = ChatPromptTemplate.from_template(\n    \"You are a financial data expert tasked with generating records \"\n    \"representing company OTC derivative data and \"\n    \"should be good enough for investor and lending ML model to take decisions \"\n    \"and data should accurately represent the scenario: {scenario} \\n \"\n    \"and as per examples given in context: \"\n    \"and context is {context} \"\n    \"the examples given in context is for reference only, do not use same values while generating dataset.\"\n    \"generate dataset with the diverse set of samples but record should be able to represent the given scenario accurately.\"\n    \"Please ensure that the generated data meets the following criteria: \"\n    \"The data should be diverse  and realistic, reflecting various industries, \"\n    \"company sizes, financial metrics. \"\n    \"Ensure that the generated data follows logical relationships and correlations between features \"\n    \"(e.g., higher revenue typically corresponds to more employees, \"\n    \"better credit ratings, and lower risk). \"\n    \"And Generate {count} records starting from index {start_index}. \"\n    \"generate just JSON as per schema and do not include any text or message before or after JSON. \"\n    \"{format_instruction} \\n\"\n    \"If continuing, start after this record: {last_record}\\n\"\n    \"If stopping, do not include this record in the output.\"\n    \"Please ensure that the generated data is well-formatted and consistent.\"\n)</code></pre><p>The following code snippet shows the process for generating the synthetic data. You can call this method in an iterative manner to generate more records. The input parameters include , and . The response data is also formatted into CSV format using the instruction provided by the following:</p><pre><code>output_parser.get_format_instructions():\n\n def generate_records(start_index, count, scenario, context, last_record=\"\"):\n    try:\n        response = chain.invoke({\n            \"count\": count,\n            \"start_index\": start_index,\n            \"scenario\": scenario,\n            \"context\": context,\n            \"last_record\": last_record,\n            \"format_instruction\": output_parser.get_format_instructions(),\n            \"data_set_class_schema\": DataSet.schema_json()\n        })\n        \n        return response\n    except Exception as e:\n        print(f\"Error in generate_records: {e}\")\n        raise e</code></pre><p>Parsing the output generated by the LLM and representing it in CSV was quite challenging. We used a Pydantic parser to parse the JSON output generated by the LLM, as shown in the following code snippet:</p><pre><code>class CustomPydanticOutputParser(PydanticOutputParser):\n    def parse(self, text: str) -&gt; BaseModel:\n        # Extract JSON from the text\n        try:\n            # Find the first occurrence of '{'\n            start = text.index('{')\n            # Find the last occurrence of '}'\n            end = text.rindex('}') + 1\n            json_str = text[start:end]\n\n            # Parse the JSON string\n            parsed_json = json.loads(json_str)\n\n            # Use the parent class to convert to Pydantic object\n            return super().parse_with_cls(parsed_json)\n        except (ValueError, json.JSONDecodeError) as e:\n            raise ValueError(f\"Failed to parse output: {e}\")</code></pre><p>The following code snippet shows how the records are generated in an iterative manner with 10 records in each invocation to the LLM:</p><pre><code>def generate_full_dataset(total_records, batch_size, scenario, context):\n    dataset = []\n    total_generated = 0\n    last_record = \"\"\n    batch: DataSet = generate_records(total_generated,\n                                      min(batch_size, total_records - total_generated),\n                                      scenario, context, last_record)\n    # print(f\"batch: {type(batch)}\")\n    total_generated = len(batch.records)\n    dataset.extend(batch.records)\n    while total_generated &lt; total_records:\n        try:\n            batch = generate_records(total_generated,\n                                     min(batch_size, total_records - total_generated),\n                                     scenario, context, batch.records[-1].json())\n            processed_batch = batch.records\n\n            if processed_batch:\n                dataset.extend(processed_batch)\n                total_generated += len(processed_batch)\n                last_record = processed_batch[-1].start_index\n                print(f\"Generated {total_generated} records.\")\n            else:\n                print(\"Generated an empty or invalid batch.

The Q-Q plots compare the quantiles of the data distribution with the quantiles of a normal distribution. If the data isn‚Äôt skewed, the points should approximately follow the diagonal line.</p><p>As the next step of verification, we created a corelation heat map of the following attributes: , , , and . The plot is perfectly balanced with the diagonal elements showing a value of 1. The value of 1 indicates the column is perfectly co-related to itself.

Although synthetic data generation can be a powerful tool, it‚Äôs crucial to make sure that no real customer information is used without proper authorization and thorough anonymization. Organizations must prioritize data protection, implement robust security measures, and adhere to relevant regulations. Additionally, when developing and deploying AI models, it‚Äôs essential to consider ethical implications, potential biases, and the broader societal impact. Responsible AI practices include regular audits, transparency in decision-making processes, and ongoing monitoring to help prevent unintended consequences. By balancing innovation with ethical considerations, financial institutions can harness the benefits of AI while maintaining trust and protecting individual privacy.</p><p>In this post, we showed how to generate a well-balanced synthetic dataset representing various aspects of counterparty data, using RAG-based prompt engineering with LLMs. Counterparty data analysis is imperative for making OTC transactions between two counterparties. Because actual business data in this domain isn‚Äôt easily available, using this approach you can generate synthetic training data for your ML models at minimal cost often within minutes. After you train the model, you can use it to make intelligent decisions before entering into an OTC derivative transaction.</p><p>For more information about this topic, refer to the following resources:</p><p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/f1f836cb4ea6efb2a0b1b99f41ad8b103eff4b59/2025/01/23/kulsant.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"100\" height=\"133\"> is a Senior Moderation Architect with over 16 years of experience, specialized in developing serverless, container-based, and data architectures for clients across various domains.

Throughout the development process, Verisk encountered several considerations, key findings, and decisions that provide valuable insights for any enterprise looking to explore the potential of generative AI.</p><p>When creating an interactive agent using large language models (LLMs), two common approaches are RAG and model fine-tuning. The choice between these methods depends on the specific use case and available data. Verisk PAAS began developing a RAG pipeline for its PAAS AI and has progressively improved this solution. Here are some reasons why continuing with a RAG architecture was beneficial for Verisk:</p><ul><li> ‚Äì The PAAS platform is constantly evolving, adding new business functions and technical capabilities. Verisk needed to make sure its responses are based on the most current information. The RAG approach allows access to continuously updated data, providing responses with the latest information without frequently retraining the model.</li><li> ‚Äì Besides data recency, another crucial aspect is the ability to draw from multiple PAAS resources to acquire relevant context. The ease of expanding the knowledge base without the need for fine-tuning new data sources makes the solution adaptable.</li><li> ‚Äì Retrieval minimizes the risk of hallucinations compared with free-form text generation because responses come directly from the provided excerpts. Verisk developed an evaluation tool to enhance response quality.</li><li> ‚Äì Although appropriate context can be retrieved from enterprise data sources, the underlying LLM manages the linguistics and fluency.</li><li> ‚Äì Verisk aimed to consistently improve the PAAS AI‚Äôs response generation ability. A RAG architecture offered the transparency required in the context retrieval process, which would ultimately be used to generate user responses. This transparency helped Verisk identify areas where document restructuring was needed.</li><li> ‚Äì With diverse users accessing the platform and differing data access permissions, data governance and isolation were critical. Verisk implemented controls within the RAG pipeline to restrict data access based on user permissions, helping to ensure that responses are delivered only to authorized users.</li></ul><p>Although both RAG and fine-tuning have their pros and cons, RAG is the best approach for building a PAAS AI on the PAAS platform, given Verisk‚Äôs needs for real-time accuracy, explainability, and configurability. The pipeline architecture supports iterative enhancement as the use cases for the Verisk PAAS platform develop.</p><p>The following diagram showcases a high-level architectural data flow that highlights various AWS services used in constructing the solution. Verisk‚Äôs system demonstrates a complex AI setup, where multiple components interact and frequently call on the LLM to provide user responses. Employing the PAAS platform to manage these varied components was an intuitive decision.</p><p>The key components are as follows:</p><p>Verisk‚Äôs PAAS team determined that ElastiCache is the ideal solution for storing all chat history. This storage approach allows for seamless integration in conversational chats and enables the display of recent conversations on the website, providing an efficient and responsive user experience.</p><p><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/claude/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Anthropic‚Äôs Claude</a>, available in Amazon Bedrock, played various roles within Verisk‚Äôs solution:</p><ul><li> ‚Äì When building their PAAS AI, Verisk conducted a comprehensive evaluation of leading LLMs, using their extensive dataset to test each model‚Äôs capabilities. Through Amazon Bedrock, Verisk gained streamlined access to multiple best-in-class foundation models (FMs), enabling efficient testing and comparison across key performance criteria. The Amazon Bedrock unified API and robust infrastructure provided the ideal platform to develop, test, and deploy LLM solutions at scale. After this extensive testing, Verisk found Anthropic‚Äôs Claude model consistently outperformed across key criteria. Anthropic‚Äôs Claude demonstrated superior language understanding in Verisk‚Äôs complex business domain, allowing more pertinent responses to user questions. Given the model‚Äôs standout results across Verisk PAAS platform use cases, it was the clear choice to power the PAAS AI‚Äôs natural language capabilities.</li><li><strong>Conversation summarization</strong> ‚Äì When a user asks a follow-up question, the PAAS AI can continue the conversational thread. To enable this, Verisk used Claude to summarize the dialogue to update the context from ElastiCache. The full conversation summary and new excerpts are input to the LLM to generate the next response. This conversational flow allows the PAAS AI to answer user follow-up questions and have a more natural, contextual dialogue, bringing Verisk PAAS closer to having a true AI assistant that can engage in useful, back-and-forth conversations with users.</li><li> ‚Äì Keywords are extracted from user questions and previous conversations to be used for creating the new summarized prompt and to be input to Verisk‚Äôs knowledge base retrievers to perform vector similarity search.</li></ul><h3>Amazon OpenSearch Service</h3><p>Primarily used for the storage of text embeddings, OpenSearch facilitates efficient document retrieval by enabling rapid access to indexed data. These embeddings serve as semantic representations of documents, allowing for advanced search capabilities that go beyond simple keyword matching. This semantic search functionality enhances the system‚Äôs ability to retrieve relevant documents that are contextually similar to the search queries, thereby improving the overall accuracy and speed of data queries. Additionally, OpenSearch functions as a semantic cache for similarity searches, optimizing performance by reducing the computational load and improving response times during data retrieval operations. This makes it an indispensable tool in the larger PAAS ecosystem, where the need for quick and precise information access is paramount.</p><p>The integration of Snowflake in the PAAS AI ecosystem helps provide scalable and real-time access to data, allowing Verisk to promptly address customer concerns and improve its services. By using Snowflake‚Äôs capabilities, Verisk can perform advanced analytics, including sentiment analysis and predictive modeling, to better understand customer needs and enhance user experiences. This continuous feedback loop is vital for refining the PAAS AI and making sure it remains responsive and relevant to user demands.</p><h2>Structuring and retrieving the data</h2><p>An essential element in developing the PAAS AI‚Äôs knowledge base was properly structuring and effectively querying the data to deliver accurate answers. Verisk explored various techniques to optimize both the organization of the content and the methods to extract the most relevant information:</p><ul><li> ‚Äì A key step in preparing the accumulated questions and answers was splitting the data into individual documents to facilitate indexing into OpenSearch Service. Rather than uploading large files containing multiple pages of content, Verisk chunked the data into smaller segments by document section and character lengths. By splitting the data into small, modular chunks focused on a single section of a document, Verisk could more easily index each document and had greater success in pulling back the correct context. Chunking the data also enabled straightforward updating and reindexing of the knowledge base over time.</li><li> ‚Äì When querying the knowledge base, Verisk found that using just standard vector search wasn‚Äôt enough to retrieve all the relevant contexts pertaining to a question. Therefore, a solution was implemented to combine a sparse bm25 search in combination with the dense vector search to create a hybrid search approach, which yielded much better context retrieval results.</li><li><strong>Data separation and filters</strong> ‚Äì Another issue Verisk ran into was that, because of the vast amount of documents and the overlapping content within certain topics, incorrect documents were being retrieved for some questions that asked for specific topics that were present across multiple sources‚Äîsome of these weren‚Äôt needed or appropriate in the context of the user‚Äôs question. Therefore, data separation was implemented to split the documents based on document type and filter by line of business to improve context retrieval within the application.</li></ul><p>By thoroughly experimenting and optimizing both the knowledge base powering the PAAS AI and the queries to extract answers from it, Verisk was able to achieve very high answer accuracy during the proof of concept, paving the way for further development. The techniques explored‚Äîhybrid querying, HTML section chunking, and index filtering‚Äîbecame core elements of Verisk‚Äôs approach for extracting quality contexts.</p><h2>LLM parameters and models</h2><p>Experimenting with prompt structure, length, temperature, role-playing, and context was key to improving the quality and accuracy of the PAAS AI‚Äôs Claude-powered responses. The <a href=\"https://docs.anthropic.com/claude/docs/prompt-engineering\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">prompt design guidelines</a> provided by Anthropic were incredibly helpful.</p><p>Verisk crafted prompts that provided Anthropic‚Äôs Claude with clear context and set roles for answering user questions. Setting the temperature to 0 helped reduce the randomness and indeterministic nature of LLM-generated responses.</p><p>Verisk also experimented with different models to improve the efficiency of the overall solution. For scenarios where latency was more important and less reasoning was required, Anthropic‚Äôs Claude Haiku was the perfect solution. For other scenarios such as question answering using provided contexts where it was more important for the LLM to be able to understand every detail given in the prompt, Anthropic‚Äôs Claude Sonnet was the better choice to balance latency, performance, and cost.</p><p>LLM guardrails were implemented in the PAAS AI project using both the guardrails provided by Amazon Bedrock and specialized sections within the prompt to detect unrelated questions and prompt attack attempts. Amazon Bedrock guardrails can be attached to any Amazon Bedrock model invocation call and automatically detect if the given model input and output are in violation of the language filters that are set (violence, misconduct, sexual, and so on), which helps with screening user inputs. The specialized prompts further improve LLM security by creating a second net that uses the power of the LLMs to catch any inappropriate inputs from the users.</p><p>This allows Verisk to be confident that the model will only answer to its intended purpose surrounding premium auditing services and will not be misused by threat actors.</p><p>After validating several evaluation tools such as <a href=\"https://github.com/confident-ai/deepeval\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Deepeval</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/explodinggradients/ragas\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Ragas</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/truera/trulens\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Trulens</a>, and so on, the Verisk PAAS team realized that there were certain limitations to using these tools for their specific use case. Consequently, the team decided to develop its own evaluation API, shown in the above figure.</p><p>This custom API evaluates the answers based on three major metrics:</p><ul><li> ‚Äì Using LLMs, the process assesses whether the answers provided are relevant to the customer‚Äôs prompt. This helps make sure that the responses are directly addressing the questions posed.</li><li> ‚Äì By using LLMs, the process evaluates whether the context retrieved is appropriate and aligns well with the question. This helps make sure that the LLM has the appropriate and accurate contexts to generate a response.</li><li> ‚Äì Using LLMs, the process checks if the responses are generated based on their retrieved context or if they are hallucinated. This is crucial for maintaining the integrity and reliability of the information provided.</li></ul><p>This custom evaluation approach helps make sure that the answers generated are not only relevant and contextually appropriate but also faithful to the established generative AI knowledge base, minimizing the risk of misinformation. By incorporating these metrics, Verisk has enhanced the robustness and reliability of their PAAS AI, providing customers with accurate and trustworthy responses.</p><p>The Verisk PAAS team has implemented a comprehensive feedback loop mechanism, shown in the above figure, to support continuous improvement and address any issues that might arise.</p><p>This feedback loop is structured around the following key components:</p><ul><li><strong>Customer feedback analysis</strong> ‚Äì The team actively collects and analyzes feedback from customers to identify potential data issues or problems with the generative AI responses. This analysis helps pinpoint specific areas that need improvement.</li><li> ‚Äì After an issue is identified, it‚Äôs categorized based on its nature. If it‚Äôs a data-related issue, it‚Äôs assigned to the internal business team for resolution. If it‚Äôs an application issue, a Jira ticket is automatically created for the PAAS IT team to address and fix the problem.</li><li> ‚Äì The system provides an option to update QA test cases based on the feedback received. This helps make sure that the test scenarios remain relevant and comprehensive, covering a wide range of potential issues.</li><li> ‚Äì Ground truth agreements, which serve as the benchmark for evaluating LLM response quality, are periodically reviewed and updated. This helps make sure that the evaluation metrics remain accurate and reflective of the desired standards.</li><li> ‚Äì Regular evaluations of the LLM responses are conducted using the updated QA test cases and ground truth agreements. This helps in maintaining high-quality responses and quickly addressing any deviations from the expected standards.</li></ul><p>This robust feedback loop mechanism enables Verisk to continuously fine-tune the PAAS AI, making sure that it delivers precise, relevant, and contextually appropriate answers to customer queries. By integrating customer feedback, categorizing issues efficiently, updating test scenarios, and adhering to stringent evaluation protocols, Verisk maintains a high standard of service and drives continuous improvement in its generative AI capabilities.</p><p>Verisk initially rolled out the PAAS AI to one beta customer to demonstrate real-world performance and impact. Supporting a customer in this way is a stark contrast to how Verisk has historically engaged with and supported customers in the past, where Verisk would typically have a team allocated to interact with the customer directly. Verisk‚Äôs PAAS AI has revolutionized the way subject matter experts (SMEs) work and cost-effectively scales while still providing high-quality assistance. What previously took hours of manual review can now be accomplished in minutes, resulting in an extraordinary 96‚Äì98% reduction in processing time per specialist. This dramatic improvement in efficiency not only streamline operations but also allows Verisk‚Äôs experts to focus on more strategic initiatives that drive greater value for the organization.</p><p>In analyzing this early usage data, Verisk uncovered additional areas where it can drive business value for its customers. As Verisk collects additional information, this data will help uncover what will be needed to improve results and prepare to roll out to a wider customer base of approximately 15,000 users.</p><p>Ongoing development will focus on expanding these capabilities, prioritized based on the collected questions. Most exciting, though, are the new possibilities on the horizon with generative AI. Verisk knows this technology is rapidly advancing and is eager to harness innovations to bring even more value to customers. As new models and techniques emerge, Verisk plans to adapt the PAAS AI to take advantage of the latest capabilities. Although the PAAS AI currently focuses on responding to user questions, this is only the starting point. Verisk plans to quickly improve its capabilities to proactively make suggestions and configure functionality directly in the system itself. The Verisk PAAS team is inspired by the challenge of pushing the boundaries of what‚Äôs possible with generative AI and is excited to test those boundaries.</p><p>Verisk‚Äôs development of a PAAS AI for its PAAS platform demonstrates the transformative power of generative AI in customer support and operational efficiency. Through careful data harvesting, structuring, retrieval, and the use of LLMs, semantic search functionalities, and stringent evaluation protocols, Verisk has crafted a robust system that delivers accurate, real-time answers to user questions. By continuing to enhance the PAAS AI‚Äôs features while maintaining ethical and responsible AI practices, Verisk is set to provide increased value to its customers, enable staff to concentrate on innovation, and establish new benchmarks for customer service in the insurance sector.</p><p>For more information, see the following resources:</p><p> is the Director of Software Engineering at Verisk, where he leads the Premium Audit Advisory Service (PAAS) development team.

This works like an  which can also capture values from the local environment, just like the difference between regular closures and functions. This also comes with 3 analogous traits in the standard library prelude: , , and .</p><p>In some cases, you could already approximate this with a regular closure and an asynchronous block, like . However, the future returned by such an inner block is not able to borrow from the closure captures, but this does work with  closures:</p><pre><code>let mut vec: Vec&lt;String&gt; = vec![];\n\nlet closure = async || {\n    vec.push(ready(String::from(\"\")).await);\n};\n</code></pre><p>It also has not been possible to properly express higher-ranked function signatures with the  traits returning a , but you can write this with the  traits:</p><pre><code>use core::future::Future;\nasync fn f&lt;Fut&gt;(_: impl for&lt;'a&gt; Fn(&amp;'a u8) -&gt; Fut)\nwhere\n    Fut: Future&lt;Output = ()&gt;,\n{ todo!() }\n\nasync fn f2(_: impl for&lt;'a&gt; AsyncFn(&amp;'a u8))\n{ todo!() }\n\nasync fn main() {\n    async fn g(_: &amp;u8) { todo!() }\n    f(g).await;\n    //~^ ERROR mismatched types\n    //~| ERROR one type is more general than the other\n\n    f2(g).await; // ok!\n}\n</code></pre><h3><a href=\"https://blog.rust-lang.org/2025/02/20/Rust-1.85.0.html#hiding-trait-implementations-from-diagnostics\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></a>Hiding trait implementations from diagnostics</h3><p>The new <code>#[diagnostic::do_not_recommend]</code> attribute is a hint to the compiler to not show the annotated trait implementation as part of a diagnostic message. For library authors, this is a way to keep the compiler from making suggestions that may be unhelpful or misleading. For example:</p><pre><code>pub trait Foo {}\npub trait Bar {}\n\nimpl&lt;T: Foo&gt; Bar for T {}\n\nstruct MyType;\n\nfn main() {\n    let _object: &amp;dyn Bar = &amp;MyType;\n}\n</code></pre><pre><code>error[E0277]: the trait bound `MyType: Bar` is not satisfied\n --&gt; src/main.rs:9:29\n  |\n9 |     let _object: &amp;dyn Bar = &amp;MyType;\n  |                             ^^^^ the trait `Foo` is not implemented for `MyType`\n  |\nnote: required for `MyType` to implement `Bar`\n --&gt; src/main.rs:4:14\n  |\n4 | impl&lt;T: Foo&gt; Bar for T {}\n  |         ---  ^^^     ^\n  |         |\n  |         unsatisfied trait bound introduced here\n  = note: required for the cast from `&amp;MyType` to `&amp;dyn Bar`\n</code></pre><p>For some APIs, it might make good sense for you to implement , and get  indirectly by that blanket implementation.

Let‚Äôs say, I‚Äôm planning to use this Agent to learn about financial updates, so I can give it a specific tool for that topic, like searching only a finance website instead of the whole web.</p><pre><code>def search_yf(query: str) -&gt; str:\n&nbsp;&nbsp;engine = DuckDuckGoSearchResults(backend=\"news\")\n&nbsp; return engine.run(f\"site:finance.yahoo.com {query}\")\n\ntool_search_yf = {'type':'function', 'function':{\n&nbsp; 'name': 'search_yf',\n&nbsp; 'description': 'Search for specific financial news',\n&nbsp; 'parameters': {'type': 'object',\n&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 'required': ['query'],\n&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 'properties': {\n&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 'query': {'type':'str', 'description':'the financial topic or subject to search'},\n}}}}\n\n## test\nsearch_yf(query=\"nvidia\")</code></pre><p>In my opinion, the most basic Agent should at least be able to choose between one or two Tools and re-elaborate the output of the action to give the user a proper and concise answer.&nbsp;</p><p>First, you need to write a prompt to describe the Agent‚Äôs purpose, the more detailed the better (mine is very generic), and that will be the first message in the chat history with the LLM.&nbsp;</p><pre><code>prompt = '''You are an assistant with access to tools, you must decide when to use tools to answer user message.'''&nbsp;\nmessages = [{\"role\":\"system\", \"content\":prompt}]</code></pre><p>In order to keep the chat with the AI alive, I will use a loop that starts with user‚Äôs input and then the Agent is invoked to respond (which can be a text from the LLM or the activation of a Tool).</p><p>Up to this point, the chat history could look something like this:</p><p>If the model wants to use a Tool, the appropriate function needs to be run with the input parameters suggested by the LLM in its response object:</p><p>So our code needs to get that information and run the Tool function.</p><p>Now, if we run the full code, we can chat with our Agent.</p><p>LLMs know how to code by being exposed to a large corpus of both code and natural language text, where they learn patterns, syntax, and semantics of <a href=\"https://towardsdatascience.com/tag/programming/\" title=\"Programming\">Programming</a> languages. The model learns the relationships between different parts of the code by predicting the next token in a sequence. In short, LLMs can generate Python code but can‚Äôt execute it, Agents can.</p><p>I shall prepare a Tool allowing the Agent to . In Python, you can easily create a shell to run code as a string with the native command .</p><pre><code>import io\nimport contextlib\n\ndef code_exec(code: str) -&gt; str:\\\n&nbsp; &nbsp; output = io.StringIO()\n&nbsp; &nbsp; with contextlib.redirect_stdout(output):\n&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; try:\n&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; exec(code)\n&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; except Exception as e:\n&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; print(f\"Error: {e}\")\n&nbsp; &nbsp; return output.getvalue()\n\ntool_code_exec = {'type':'function', 'function':{\n&nbsp; 'name': 'code_exec',\n&nbsp; 'description': 'execute python code',\n&nbsp; 'parameters': {'type': 'object',\n&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 'required': ['code'],\n&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 'properties': {\n&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 'code': {'type':'str', 'description':'code to execute'},\n}}}}\n\n## test\ncode_exec(\"a=1+1; print(a)\")</code></pre><p>Just like before, I will write a prompt, but this time, at the beginning of the chat-loop, I will ask the user to provide a file path.</p><p>Since coding tasks can be a little trickier for LLMs, I am going to add also . By default, during one session, there isn‚Äôt a true long-term memory. LLMs have access to the chat history, so they can remember information temporarily, and track the context and instructions you‚Äôve given earlier in the conversation. However, memory doesn‚Äôt always work as expected, especially if the LLM is small. Therefore, a good practice is to reinforce the model‚Äôs memory by adding periodic reminders in the chat history.</p><p>Please note that the default memory length in Ollama is 2048 characters. If your machine can handle it, you can increase it by changing the number when the LLM is invoked:</p><pre><code>&nbsp; &nbsp; ## model\n&nbsp; &nbsp; agent_res = ollama.chat(\n&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; model=llm,\n&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; tools=[tool_code_exec],\n&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; options={\"num_ctx\":2048},\n&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; messages=messages)</code></pre><p>In this usecase, the output of the Agent is mostly code and data, so I don‚Äôt want the LLM to re-elaborate the responses.</p><p>Now, if we run the full code, we can chat with our Agent.</p><p>This article has covered the foundational steps of creating Agents from scratch using only .

One is the love of creating\nbeautiful, elegant code ‚Äî making Open Source libraries and APIs that focus\non clear design and reusability.  The other passion is building quick,\npragmatic solutions for real users (who may not even be developers).  The\nlatter usually in a setting of building a product, where the product is\nnot the code.  Here, speed and iteration matter more than beautiful code\nor reusability, because success hinges on shipping something people want.</p><p>Flamework is in service of the latter, and in crass violation of the\nformer.</p><p>Early on, I realized that creating reusable code and directly solving\nproblems for users are often at odds.  My first clue came when I helped\nrun the German\n<a href=\"https://www.ubuntuusers.de/\">ubuntuusers</a> website.  It was powered by\na heavily modified version of phpBB, which despite how messy it was,\nscaled to a large user base when patched properly.  It was messy, but easy\nto adjust.  The abstractions were one layer deep.</p><p>Back then, me and a friend tried to replace it by writing my own bulletin\nboard software, <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20070502223619/http://flying.circus.pocoo.org/\">Pocoo</a>.\nWorking in isolation, without users, led me down a path of\nover-engineering.  While we learned a lot and ended up creating popular\nOpen Source libraries (like Jinja, Werkzeug and Pygments), Pocoo never\nbecame a solid product.  Later, my collaborators and I <a href=\"https://github.com/inyokaproject/inyoka/\">rebuilt\nubuntuusers</a>, without the\ngoal of making it into a reusable product.  That rewrite shipped\nsuccessfully and it lives to this very day.</p><p>But it took me years to fully realize what was happening here: reusability\nis not that important when you‚Äôre building an application, but it‚Äôs\ncrucial when you‚Äôre building a library or framework.</p></div><div><p>If you are unfamiliar with Flamework you should watch a talk that Cal\nHenderson gave in 2008 at DjangoCon (<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6Fr65PFqfk\">Why I hate Django</a>).  He talked about scale\nand how Django didn't solve for it.  He enumerated all the things\nimportant to him: sharding, using custom sequences for primary keys,\nforgoing joins and foreign keys, supporting database replication setups,\ndenormalizing data to the extreme.  This is also were I first learned\nabout the possibility of putting all session data into cookies via\nsigning.  It was a memorable talk for me because it showed me that there\nare shortcomings.  Django (which I used for ubuntuusers) had beautiful\nAPIs but at the time solved for little of that Cal needed.  The talk\nreally stuck with me.</p><p>At the time of the talk, Flamework did not really exist.  It was more of\nan idea and principles of engineering at Flickr.</p><p>A few years later, Flamework appeared on GitHub, not as an open-sourced\npiece of Flickr code but as a reimplementation of those same ideas.  You\ncan explore its repository and see code like this:</p><div><pre></pre></div><p>Instinctively it makes me cringe.  Is that a SQL injection?  Well you were\nsupposed to use the PHP <a href=\"https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.addslashes.php\">addslashes</a> function\nbeforehand.  But notice how it caters to sharding and clustering directly\nin the query function.</p></div><div><p>Code like this often triggers a visceral reaction, especially in engineers\nwho prize clean design.</p><p>How does something like that get created?  Cal Henderson described\nFlickr's principle as ‚Äúdoing the dumbest possible thing that will work.‚Äù\nMaybe ‚Äúdumb‚Äù is too strong ‚Äî ‚Äúsimple‚Äù might be more apt.  Yet simplicity\ncan look messy to someone expecting a meticulously engineered codebase.\nThis is not at all uncommon and I have seen it over and over.  The first\nlarge commercial project that got traction that I ever worked on (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plurk\">Plurk</a>) was also pretty pragmatic and\nmessy inside.  My former colleague Ben Vinegar also <a href=\"https://benv.ca/blog/posts/the-hardest-problem\">recently shared</a> a story of early,\nmessy FreshBooks code and how he came to terms with it.  Same story at\n<a href=\"https://sentry.io/welcome\">Sentry</a>.  We moved fast, we made a mess.</p><p>None of this is surprising in retrospective.  Perfect code doesn't\nguarantee success if you haven't solved a real problem for real people.\nPursuing elegance in a vacuum leads to abandoned side projects or\nframeworks nobody uses.  By contrast, clunky but functional code often\ncomes with just the right compromises for quick iteration.  And that in\nturn means a lot of messy code powers products that people love ‚Äî\nsomething that's a far bigger challenge.</p></div><div><p>I have shown Flamework's code to multiple engineers over the years and it\nusually creates such a visceral response.  It blind sights one by\nseemingly disregarding all rules of good software engineering.</p><p>That makes Flamework serve as a fascinating Rorschach test for engineers.\nAre you <a href=\"https://github.com/exflickr/flamework\">looking at it</a> with\nadmiration for the focus on some critical issues like scale, the built-in\nobservability and debugging tools.  Or are you judging it, and its\ncreators, for manually constructing SQL queries, using global variables,\nnot using classes and looking like messy PHP4 code?  Is it a pragmatic\ntool, intentionally designed to iterate quickly at scale, or is it a naive\nmess made by unskilled developers?</p><p>Would I use Flamework?  Hello no.  But I appreciate the priorities behind\nit.  If these ugly choices help you move faster, attract users and\nvalidate the product, then a rewrite, or large refactorings later are a\nsmall price to pay.</p></div><div><p>At the end of the day, where you stand on ‚Äúshitty code‚Äù depends on your\nprimary goal:</p><ul><li>Are you shipping a product and racing to meet user needs?</li><li>Or are you building a reusable library or framework meant to stand the\ntest of time?</li></ul><p>Both mindsets are valid, but they rarely coexist harmoniously in a single\ncodebase.  Flamework is a reminder that messy, simple solutions can be\npowerful if they solve real problems.  Eventually, when the time is right,\nyou can clean it up or rebuild from the ground up.</p><p>The real challenge is deciding which route to take ‚Äî and when.  Even with\nexperience, it is can be hard to know when to move from quick fixes to\nmore robust foundations.  The principles behind Flamework are also\nreflected in <a href=\"https://develop.sentry.dev/getting-started/philosophy/\">Sentry's development philosophy</a>.  One more\npoignant one being ‚ÄúEmbrace the Duct Tape‚Äù.  Yet as Sentry matured, much\nof our duct tape didn't stand the test of time, and was re-applied at\nmoments when the real solution would have been a solid foundation poured\nwith concrete.</p><p>That's because successful projects eventually grow up.  What let you\niterate fast in the beginning might eventually turn into an unmaintainable\nmess and will be rebuilt from the inside out.</p><p>I personally would never have built Flamework, it repulses me a bit.  At the\nsame time, I have a enormous respect for the people who build it.  Their\nwork and thinking has shaped how I solve problems and think of product\nengineering.</p></div>","contentLength":6780,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/1iu37xs/ugly_code_and_dumb_things/"},{"title":"Python input() Function - Detailed Explanation","url":"https://dev.to/vayolapradeep/python-input-function-detailed-explanation-5b8m","date":1740070101,"author":"vayola pradeep","guid":7292,"unread":true,"content":"<h2>Python input() Function - Detailed Explanation</h2>","contentLength":46,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"üöÄ The Best 100% French Hosting Solution ‚Äì Unlimited & High-Performance! üá´üá∑","url":"https://dev.to/jmegnidro/the-best-100-french-hosting-solution-unlimited-high-performance-1mdm","date":1740068001,"author":"Dominique Megnidro","guid":7291,"unread":true,"content":"<p>If you're looking for a <strong>100% French hosting provider</strong> offering , , and <strong>responsive customer support</strong>, then  is the perfect choice for you! üí°  </p><p>‚úÖ  (storage, databases, emails...)<strong>Powerful and optimized servers</strong><strong>Simple and intuitive interface</strong><strong>Ultra-responsive customer support</strong> üá´üá∑  </p><p>I host several projects with them, and I can assure you their <strong>value for money is unbeatable!</strong> üíØ  </p><p>If you have any questions about hosting or need advice, feel free to reach out! üòä</p>","contentLength":465,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Call Center Wondr by BNI 0821-4448-0002","url":"https://dev.to/vanglevan/call-center-wondr-by-bni-0821-4448-0002-1pjn","date":1740067711,"author":"Vang LE","guid":7293,"unread":true,"content":"<p>Nomor Resmi Call Center Wondr BNI 0821-4448-0002.

That little snippet of code at the top of the script is like a preamble, a clearing of the throat before the real business begins. What purpose does it serve? Well, the header is a kind of introduction, letting the reader know what's to come with some basic information.</p><blockquote><p><em>Let the Code be governed by a singular, mighty function</em></p></blockquote><p>Ah, the main() function - now there's a topic! It's like the heart and soul of your code, the place where everything comes together. See, when you're working on a code project, it's like you're building a big machine, right? And the main() function, well, that's the control panel, the place where you pull all the levers and push all the buttons to make the whole thing rock. In order to use that machine, you gotta follow a certain set of steps right? Turn the key, check the fuel, prime the pump.. Well, that's what the main() function is all about - it's the sequence of events that gets your code up and running.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  The parameters, guardians of function\n</h3><blockquote><p><em>Each one a gatekeeper, ensuring the proper flow of information.</em></p></blockquote><p>Parameters are those little vessels that carry the lifeblood of our functions.\nNow, I know what you're thinkin' - \"But George, how do I know which one to use?\" Well, my friend, it all comes down to the task at hand.<p>\nIf you're dealing with a relatively simple setup like here, them variables-as-parameters might be just the ticket you need. But if you're working on somethin' a little more complex, with all sorts of moving parts and interdependencies, well, them classes, they're the way to go.

Now, I know what you're thinking - \"Docstrings? What in the Sam Hill are those?\" Let me break it down for you.\nThese docstrings, they're like little notes, little snippets of information that you tack on to your code, just to give folks a heads up on what's going on. It's like when you're doing some work around the house, and you leave a little note for the neighbour, just to let ‚Äòem know what you're up to.<p>\nNow, these docstrings, they come in all shapes and sizes. But the way I see it, these docstrings, they're not just about the code, no sir. They're about the people too. So, when you write one of these things, you're not just explaining what the code does, you're telling a story. You're givin' people a little glimpse into your mind and your thought process.

In the realm of the browser, a puppet is forged\n</h3><blockquote><p>Where the mighty browser is bound to our will, as if by sorcery.</p></blockquote><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>First up, we've got this  business. Now, I know what you're thinking - \"George, what in the world is a driver service?\" Well, let me tell you, it's the piece of code that's gonna make this whole Selenium thing work. It's like a bridge between our script and the middleman, I name the ! And after that service is up, the gecko‚Äôs gonna turn our Firefox into a nice .\nAnd where do we get this driver service, you ask? From the , of course! That's the path to the executable that's gonna make Firefox dance to our tune. Do you know what else it's gonna do? It's gonna log everything that's happening, right into the  file. That way, if anything goes sideways, we can take a peek under the hood and see why‚Äôs that.\nNow, the options. See, we're creating a shiny new set of , and we're gonna deck them out with some goodies. First up, we're pointing it to the , making sure we've got the right browser to work with.\nAnd then, if that  variable is set to True, we're gonna add a little  argument to the mix. That means the browser's gonna run without a visible window, stealthier than your average ninja. No need for all the bells and whistles (and windows), we're just here to get the job done, right?\nAnd finally, we're wrapping it all up by returning a brand-spankin' new instance of the , complete with our custom service and options. This one's like a well-oiled machine, and we're the ones behind the wheel.\nJust remember: if you ever find yourself scratching your head, wondering what in the world is going on, just take a peek at that  file. It's like a crystal ball, and it might tell you everything you need to know.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  II. The opening of the file\n</h3><blockquote><p>Like an ancient tome unveiling its secrets.</p></blockquote><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Alright, folks, gather 'round, because we're about to dive into some more of this code. Now, this right here, this is the kind of stuff that separates the wheat from the chaff.\nFirst up, we've got this  block. Now, I know what you're thinking: \"George, what in the world is a  block?\" Well, let me tell you, it's the statement that‚Äôs gonna keep us from running headfirst into a brick wall every time something goes wrong. And trust me, in the universe of programming, something's always going wrong.\nSee, what we're doing here is we're trying to open a file, right? And we're using this fancy-schmancy  function to do it. And that's where the  block comes in.\nIf everything goes according to plan, and the file is there, waiting for us with open arms, we're gonna read the contents and hand 'em back, no problem.  \"But George, what could possibly go wrong?\" Well, my friends, the world is a cruel and unpredictable place ( when you‚Äôre learning software development), and sometimes, those files, they just up and disappear. But don't you worry, we've got a plan and that's where the  block comes in.\nIf that  rears its ugly head, we're gonna print out a nice, friendly message, letting the user know that the file they were looking for is.. not there..\nIt's like a safety net, a way to keep the wheels from falling off even when the road gets a little bumpy. And you know what they say, \"the more you plan for the unexpected, the less unexpected it becomes.\" Or something like that.. I don't know, I'm just making it up as I go along.</p><p>Anyway, the point is when life hands you lemons, you make lemonade. And when life hands you , you just smile ;)</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  III. Sentence splitting action unleashed\n</h3><blockquote><p>The fellowship of words is broken.</p></blockquote><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Okay, listen up, because we're about to dive into some serious sentence-splitting action.\nNow, you might be looking at this line of code and thinking: \"what in the world is going on here?\" Well, let me tell you, it's a thing of beauty: we're taking this text that we've been handed, and we're gonna break it down into its individual sentences.<p>\nAnd how are we doing it, you ask? With the power of regular expressions (</p>) and its  implementation, that's how. \"But George, what's a regular expression?\" Well, my friends, it's a language all its own, a way of describing patterns in ways that would make your head spin. You can tinker with it <a href=\"https://regex101.com/r/rsVgaP/1\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">here</a>.\nBut don't worry, we're not gonna get too deep into the weeds here. All you need to know is that this little regular expression is the key to our success. It's gonna look for those periods, question marks, and exclamation marks, and it's gonna use them as the boundaries to split our text into individual sentences. But careful, this regex has its limits, see, every language is like a delicate little dance, with each word and phrase movin' in perfect harmony. Some Pros, they‚Äôre like aware of that more than us so they built up nice little tools using carefully crafted and more accurate natural language processing (NLP)  formulas (for example you can experiment with the <a href=\"https://www.nltk.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">nltk</a> library). For the sake of simplicity, let‚Äôs stick to the basics with the regex way.</p><p>The next time you find yourself staring at a wall of text, wondering how in the world you're gonna make sense of it all, just remember this little line of code and no more trying to figure out where one sentence ends and the next one begins. And who knows, maybe one day, you'll be the one writing the regular expressions turning chaos of strings into order.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  IV. The forging of the chunks\n</h3><blockquote><p>The awakening of mighty blocks of text.</p></blockquote><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Hmm, we're about to dive into some serious text-chunking action now. You see, we've got this text that we need to translate, but we can't just send the whole thing off to the translation service all at once. Nah, that would be way too easy. Instead, we've gotta break it down into manageable chunks, little bite-sized pieces that the service can handle without breaking a sweat. That's where this  function comes in handy. It's like a master chef, carefully slicing and dicing the text, making sure each piece is the perfect size.\nFirst, we set up a little , a fancy data structure that's gonna help us keeping track of the current chunk.</p><blockquote><p>A , that's just a  way of saying double-ended queue, obviously we deal with small amounts of data here but I wanted to give a try to this exotic thing. Your less sophisticated arrays would work fine there too. Just remember that usual  and  methods don‚Äôt perform fast on items on the opposite side of the line. So Python‚Äôs  module provides that class called deque that‚Äôs specially designed to provide fast and memory-efficient ways to append and pop item from both ends.</p></blockquote><p>And then, we start looping through the sentences of the \"text\" block  (we provided it as an argument when we called the function), and for each sentence, we're gonna figure out its length, -including the space character at the end.\nNow, you might be wondering, \"But George, how do you know when to start a new chunk?\" Well, my friends, it's all about that  variable and the one called  that we use as a counter to keep a running tally of the length of the current chunk. If the current sentence is gonna fit within the chunk size character limit, well, we're just gonna add it on and update the chunk length accordingly. That‚Äôs the normal way to go. Got it?\nNow, if the length of the current sentence, plus the length of the chunk we've got so far, pushes us  the character limit we've set, well, we're gonna do a few things. First, we're gonna take all the sentences in the chunk and join 'em up with spaces, and then we're gonna yield that beasty. That just means we're gonna spit it out and move on to a new chunk.\nMoving on to the next chunk means we're gonna clear out the chunk variable and start fresh, adding the current sentence to it and resetting the chunk length to just the length of that sentence, and then, just like before, we‚Äôll keep rolling until we hit the limit again.<p>\nFinally, after we've gone through all the sentences, we're gonna yield the last chunk, if there is one.</p></p><p>That‚Äôs it for our symphony of text-chunking perfection. And who knows.. maybe you'll even find yourself singing the praises of them deques and character limits soon.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  V. Print statements illuminate the path\n</h3><blockquote><p>The chronicles of progress are Written.</p></blockquote><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Alright, but George, why do we need all these print statements? Isn't the script just supposed to, you know, just work?\"\nWell see, we've got this script that's doing all sorts of stuff, translating text and whatnot. But how are we supposed to know if it's working, huh? That's where these print statements come in, my friends, they're like the canaries in the coal mine. They're the early warning system that's gonna deal us some intel to let us know something's gone awry.<p>\nWe're gonna print out the length of the input text. Because let's be real, how are we supposed to know if this thing is working if we don't know how much text we're dealing with, am I right? It's like trying to bake a cake without knowing how much flour you've got. There's more.. We're also gonna print out the number of chunks that the script has generated. And to top it all off, we're gonna print out the length of each of those chunks. Because, honestly, who doesn't love a good old-fashioned character count? It's like a little treasure hunt, but instead of finding gold, we're finding out how many letters are in each sentence.</p>\nA little  for when you will be contributing to bigger projects: there is that other breed of statements called . They're the quiet ones, they slip in the back door and get the job done without all the fanfare of the print. Just keep in mind they're the ones that keep a careful  when things start to get a little hairy.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  VI. The sorcery of the selectors\n</h3><blockquote><p>Their spell cast the way.</p></blockquote><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Now it‚Äôs time to jump into some serious Selenium wizardry.</p><p><a href=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2F582dkzvjknbphi4nxa9m.png\"><img src=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2F582dkzvjknbphi4nxa9m.png\" title=\"A screenshot showing the input field of deepL's website.\" alt=\"DeepL website's input field\" width=\"800\" height=\"336\"></a><em>The input field our marionette will search for.</em>\nYou see, we've got this input field that we need to find on the web page, and we can't just go barging in there, hoping it'll be there. Instead, we've gotta harness the power of Selenium, which is gonna help us navigate this digital bytescape.<p>\nTo understand this whole pasta here, We need to know more about‚Äôem selectors. See, when you're coding a website, just like a building, you got all sorts of elements fitting together - your headings, your paragraphs, buttons, an' the like. Each one of those elements, it's got its own little personality, just like a set of traits and characteristics. And to identify them, you can use all sorts of different selectors:  element selectors, class selectors, ID selectors, and many more other lads. Find out more </p><a href=\"https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/trysel.php\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">here</a>.</p><p>That's where this <code>get_input_textarea_element()</code> function comes in. It's like a secret agent, carefully scanning the page, looking for that elusive  where you insert the text you want to translate.\nBut there‚Äôs a challenge to it: what's the point of finding the input field if it's not even ready for us to use? So first, we create a  object, and we instruct it to wait for up to  seconds (we've set it at the beginning as a parameter, by the way) for the element to be loaded and clickable thanks to this intriguing <code>EC.element_to_be_clickable()</code> thing that tells Selenium exactly what we're looking for. In this case, we're saying, \"Hey, Selenium, find me an element that's clickable, and it's gotta match this . But.. how did I found that damn selector we've got here? Well, invoke the inspector by hitting  in Firefox. Then try the  combo, point &amp; clic your target and in the inspector you'll be able to right clic the highlighted piece of code and extract its info.</p><p>Concretely we‚Äôre looking to mimic human behavior just like when you paste your first chunk of text. Let‚Äôs break it down again:</p><ul><li>You select the input field by clicking on it (it‚Äôs selected).</li><li>Depending of your laziness level, either you start typing or you just paste some text into that area.</li></ul><p>Well, our driver should be instructed to do the same.\nNow, I know what you're thinking, \"But George, what if the element never becomes clickable? What then?\" Well, friends, that's where the  comes to the rescue. If the element doesn't become clickable within the  period, the whole thing is gonna throw an exception, and we'll know that something's gone wrong. Maybe the website has been updated and our old CSS selector pal is no more, or a networking problem occured somewhere. Whatever.\nIf everything goes according to plan, and Selenium manages to find that input field and confirm that it's ready for us to use, well, that's when the wonder happens. We're gonna return that element, and the rest of the script is gonna be able to work its magic.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  VII. The bridge of translation is crossed\n</h3><blockquote><p>Meaning is conveyed across the void.</p></blockquote><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Alright, friends, gather 'round, because we're about to witness the main event, the grand finale and the moment you've all been waiting for - the translation process! Now, I know what you're thinking, \"But George, how in the world is this script gonna take all those chunks of text and turn them into a beautiful translation?\" Well, my friends, watch out.</p><p>First, we're gonna set up an empty list called . Our little treasure trove of linguistic gold. This is where we're gonna store all the translated chunks.\nAnd then, we're gonna start looping through those chunks, one by one. Now, I know what you're thinking, \"But George, how are we gonna keep track of which chunk we're on?\" Well, that's where the  function comes in, my friends. It's gonna give us the  of each chunk, so we can keep tabs on our progress.\nAs we loop through each chunk, we're gonna print out a little separator, just to let the user know that we're hard at work. And then, we're gonna send that chunk of text to the input field, using the  method. It's like we're typing the text over to the translation service, saying, \"Here, take a look at this! A new text chunk for you to translate.\"\nBut we can't just sit back and wait, oh no, that would be way too easy. Instead, we're gonna print out a little message, letting the user know that we're fetching the translation. And then, we're gonna hit the  function, giving the translation service some time to achieve its task.\nWhen the time is up, we're gonna use Selenium again to find the output area on the web page, and we're gonna grab the text that's been translated by now. We're talking about pure algorithmic alchemy, folks, turning one language into another with the click of a button. The thing there is just that we‚Äôre not behind the wheels anymore.<p>\nSo once we've put our hands on that translated chunk, we're gonna append it to our translation list. And then, just to be on the safe side, we're gonna clear out the input field, making sure we're ready for the next chunk.</p>\nWhen we've gone through all the chunks, and collected all those translated gems, we're gonna return the whole  list  which is the result of all the translations we‚Äôve collected.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  VIII. The file is written\n</h3><blockquote><p>The chronicle of the realm is inscribed.</p></blockquote><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>The last step starts by calling , and let me tell you, it's one of the unsung hero of this whole operation. Because, let's be honest, what's the point of all this translation process if we can't actually, you know, save the results somewhere?\nSo, here's how it works. First, we're gonna open up a file, using that  statement. And let me tell you, that , it's like a handshake that tells Python, \"Hey, I'm about to do some serious file-handling business, so don't you dare interrupt me!\" And what are we gonna do with this file, you ask? Well, my friends, we're gonna write some text to it. But not just any text, oh no, we're talking about the fruits of our labor, the translated chunks that we've been slaving over for who knows how long.\nNow, I know what you're thinking, \"But George, how are we gonna get all those chunks into the file?\" Well, that's where the  function comes in.

This delicate equilibrium influences many of Go‚Äôs core features, including its approach to memory management and data structures. One standout example of this thoughtful design is the implementation of slice growth. Through this approach, Go ensures that slices expand seamlessly, optimizing both performance and memory usage without compromising ease of use.</p><p>In Go, a slice is a lightweight data structure that serves as a window into a contiguous block of memory where elements of a specific type are stored. At its core, a slice doesn‚Äôt directly contain the data itself but instead holds a pointer to an underlying array (know as the backing array.)</p><p>When the Go runtime creates a slice, as in this example, it constructs a small struct under the hood, defined in the runtime as :</p><div><pre> {\n\t unsafe.\n}</pre></div><p>The  type has the following fields:</p><ul><li> holds a pointer to the underlying array.</li><li> stores the number of elements in the slice.</li><li> stores the capacity of the array.</li></ul><p>The  type used for the  field is a generic pointer type that bypasses Go's type safety rules. Since the size of an array in Go is part of the type, the runtime uses  so it can replace the array with a larger one when needed.</p><p>The code in the example above creates a slice that has zero elements with a backing array that can hold 10 elements of type . We can later fill that array with elements by using the  function:</p><p>Here, we append a byte to the empty array represented by the unsigned 8-bit integer .</p><p>When appending elements to a slice, the Go runtime first checks whether the backing array has enough capacity to accommodate the new elements. If it does, the elements are simply added to the existing array. However, if the current array lacks sufficient space, the runtime allocates a larger backing array, copies the existing elements into it, and then appends the new elements.</p><div><pre>([], , )\n\n(, ) (, ) </pre></div><p>The capacity of the newly allocated array is determined by several factors, including the current array‚Äôs capacity, the type of elements it holds, and the number of new elements being appended. These factors influence how much the array grows, ensuring efficient memory usage while minimizing the need for frequent reallocations.</p><p>The runtime begins by attempting to double the existing capacity as the first step in determining the new array size:</p><div><pre></pre></div><p>If the total number of existing and newly appended elements exceeds the doubled capacity, the runtime sets the new capacity to match the required number of elements:</p><div><pre> {\n    \n}</pre></div><p>This ensures that the new capacity is larger than or equals to the number of elements after the appending operation.</p><div><pre>([], , )\n\n(, , , )\n\n.(()) </pre></div><p>In this example, the integer slice initially had a capacity of 1. After adding three elements, the runtime allocated a new backing array with a capacity of 3. This happened because doubling the original capacity (1 * 2) was insufficient to accommodate the new elements, prompting the runtime to adjust the capacity accordingly.</p><p>If doubling the capacity is sufficient, the runtime further evaluates whether allocating such a large array is efficient or merely a waste of memory.</p><p>For small slices, capacity less than 256, the runtime employs a simple doubling strategy (e.g., 2 to 4, 4 to 8, 8 to 16.) This makes sense for small workloads: doubling ensures plenty of headroom for future appends. However, as the slice‚Äôs capacity climbs into more than 256, or beyond, doubling becomes less practical. Doubling a capacity of, say, 10,000 to 20,000 allocates an extra 10,000 elements‚Äô worth of memory (potentially tens or hundreds of kilobytes, depending on the element size) which might sit unused for a long time.</p><p>To address this, the runtime adjusts its growth strategy for larger slices by reducing the growth factor gradually until it reaches 1.25. This slower growth means that if a slice already has a capacity of, say, 512, adding a few elements doesn‚Äôt balloon it to 1024; it might rise to 832 instead (a 62.5% increase). The key insight is that a larger slice can absorb more appends before hitting its capacity limit. For instance, a slice with a capacity of 512 has room for 512 more elements if empty, compared to just 8 for a capacity of 8. This naturally delays the need for reallocation.</p><p>This conservative approach aims to curb excessive memory usage. By growing incrementally rather than exponentially, the runtime avoids reserving vast swaths of memory that might remain idle, which is critical in applications handling large datasets or with limited resources (e.g., embedded systems). However, there‚Äôs a flip side: smaller growth steps mean the slice fills up sooner, triggering reallocation more often. Each reallocation involves CPU work (allocating memory, copying the existing elements, and updating the slice‚Äôs pointer) which can add up if appends are frequent.</p><p>The runtime‚Äôs strategy thus balances these two forces: memory footprint versus CPU overhead. It leans toward saving memory at the cost of potentially more frequent (but smaller) reallocations, betting that the trade-off pays off in most real-world scenarios where slices don‚Äôt grow indefinitely.</p><p>When determining how a slice should grow, the Go runtime takes into account the type of elements stored in the array, as this directly impacts memory allocation. On 64-bit systems, memory is generally allocated in chunks of 8 bytes. Any allocation that does not align with this rule is rounded up to the nearest multiple of 8 to ensure efficient memory usage and alignment.</p><p>Let's say we create a slice of bytes with capacity zero and then append an element to it:</p><div><pre>([], , )\n\n(, )\n\n.(()) </pre></div><p>After the growth, the capacity of the slice becomes 8 (8 bytes). If the element type was a 64-bit integer instead, the growth will increase the capacity to 1 (1 * 64 bits = 8 bytes):</p><div><pre>([], , )\n\n(, )\n\n.(()) </pre></div><p>If the element type was a 32-bit integer, the growth will increase the capacity to 2 (2 * 32 bits = 8 bytes):</p><div><pre>([], , )\n\n(, )\n\n.(()) </pre></div><p>The reason is that modern CPUs, particularly on 64-bit systems, operate most efficiently when data is aligned to their word size (the amount of data they can process in one cycle.) On a 64-bit system, the word size is 64 bits, or 8 bytes. If the runtime allocates, say, 5 bytes, the CPU  and masks off the unused portion. That means, allocating in 8-byte multiples ensures the entire chunk is usable without waste or extra work.</p><p>In addition, CPU caches fetch memory in 64-byte lines (8 words of 8 bytes each.) Multiples of 8 bytes fit neatly into these lines, reducing cache misses and improving locality when accessing sequential data, like a slice‚Äôs backing array.</p><p>In addition to the 8-byte chunk allocation rule, the Go runtime maintains a table of predefined constants to guide its memory allocation decisions. This table categorizes memory allocations into specific size classes, helping the runtime minimize fragmentation and efficiently reuse freed memory blocks.</p><p>The table looks like this:</p><div><pre>+---------+-------+\n| Class   | Value |\n+---------+-------+\n| Class  |      |\n| Class  |     |\n| Class  |     |\n| Class  |     |\n| Class  |     |\n| Class  |     |\n| Class  |     |\n| Class  |     |\n| Class  |    |\n| .     | .   |\n+---------+-------+</pre></div><p>This size class allocation table functions as an efficient lookup mechanism for managing memory allocation and deallocation. When a memory block belonging to a specific size class is freed, the runtime stores it in the table rather than immediately returning it to the operating system. Later, if a request is made for a memory block of the same size class, the system can quickly retrieve and reuse the previously freed block instead of performing an extensive search through physical memory to find a suitable allocation.</p><div><pre>+---------------------------------+\n|  Freed memory  size class X  |\n+---------------------------------+\n        ‚îÇ\n        ‚ñº\n+-------------------+  \n| Memory Block     |  &lt;-- Freed  (Stored in Table)\n+-------------------+  \n| Memory Block     |  &lt;-- Freed  (Stored in Table)\n+-------------------+  \n| Memory Block     |  &lt;-- Freed  (Stored in Table)\n+-------------------+  \n        ‚îÇ\n        ‚ñº\n+-------------------------------------+\n| Incoming Memory Allocation Request  |\n+-------------------------------------+\n        ‚îÇ\n          (Lookup in Table)\n+-------------------------------+\n| Matching Freed Block Found    |\n+-------------------------------+\n        ‚îÇ\n          (Reused Instead of )\n+----------------------------+\n|  Allocated to Application  |\n+----------------------------+</pre></div><p>With that in mind, the runtime not only rounds up to the nearest 8-byte boundary but also rounds up to the nearest size class in the allocation table.</p><p>Consider this slice operation:</p><div><pre>([], , )\n\n(, , , , , )</pre></div><p>Here, the slice starts with zero capacity and we add 5 elements of type . Without considering the size class allocation table, the runtime would allocate 40 bytes for the new backing array:</p><div><pre> *  bits =  bits /  =  bytes</pre></div><p>Instead, the runtime consults the class allocation table and rounds up to the nearest match (48 in this case). As a result, it allocates a backing array with a capacity of 6 (48 bytes / 64 bits), even though the new array would only need to hold 5 elements (that require only 40 bytes).</p><p>This approach significantly improves performance by reducing external fragmentation (where free memory is scattered in small, non-contiguous blocks, making larger allocations difficult.) It also minimizes allocation overhead and speeds up memory access by eliminating the need to repeatedly request new memory from the operating system.</p><p>In summary, the Go runtime takes several key factors into account when growing an array:</p><ol><li>: It starts with a doubling factor (2x) and then gradually winds down to 1.25x.</li><li>: The array is rounded up to the nearest 8-byte boundary.</li><li><strong>The Size Class Allocation Table</strong>: The runtime rounds up to the nearest available class in the table.</li></ol><p>I really admire the thoughtful work the Go team has put into making the language both efficient and flexible. It's clear that a lot of careful consideration went into optimizing performance while maintaining flexibility for developers.</p>","contentLength":10276,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1iu0xjk/slice_internals_in_go_how_the_runtime_expands/"},{"title":"Building Mobile Apps Without a Backend: The Power of Database Gateway API","url":"https://dev.to/muhammetberdi_jepbarov/building-mobile-apps-without-a-backend-the-power-of-database-gateway-api-19m0","date":1740064863,"author":"Muhammetberdi Jepbarov","guid":7267,"unread":true,"content":"<h2>\n  \n  \n  The Pain of Backend Development\n</h2><p>If you've ever built a mobile or web app that interacts with a database, you know the struggle‚Äîdesigning API endpoints, handling authentication, writing business logic, and ensuring scalability.

Just make sure you're pointing the input to something that actually contains text, because that's what this script is built to handle.\nNow, a quick word of warning ‚Äì the script is not perfect - if the output file doesn't exist yet, the script's gonna go ahead and create it for you. But if it does exist, well, buckle up, because the script's gonna overwrite it every time you run it. So, you know, maybe keep an eye on that (and specify a different output each time) if you don‚Äôt want to see your previous achievements disappear..</p><blockquote><p>Wait.. I almost forgot..

The script's gonna take that input file, work its translation-y wonders, and spit out the results into your output file. Fear not, my friend just keep an eye on that output file, and you'll be able to see the fruits of that labor, plain as day.\nWhat are you waiting for?

Whether it's tracking views for articles, videos, or products, most applications rely on a simple  column in their database tables. The challenge arises when you don‚Äôt want to go through the hassle of writing a separate API for each table that needs view tracking, while also ensuring that your system is secure from abuse like DoS (Denial of Service) attacks. This is the problem I encountered and the reason I created the  library.</p><p>In most applications, views are tracked in some form‚Äîwhether it‚Äôs for a blog post, a product listing, or even user profile pages. However, implementing a solution that is both scalable and secure can become cumbersome. You could go the route of writing custom APIs for each of these tables, but that‚Äôs time-consuming and doesn‚Äôt scale well. What if there was a way to track these views without rewriting APIs for every new table? What if there was a more efficient way to integrate this functionality into any app? That‚Äôs when I started working on .</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  The Need for a Unified Solution\n</h3><p>When building any system with views tracking, one of the critical concerns is ensuring that the view count remains authentic. In some cases, malicious users may attempt to artificially inflate the view count through repeated requests‚Äîthis is where preventing DOS (Denial of Service) type increments comes into play. Without a solid solution, your application becomes vulnerable to these types of attacks, undermining the integrity of your view count.</p><p>Thus, the idea for  was born. I wanted a way to seamlessly count organic views across any tables, regardless of the framework, while providing an easy-to-integrate middleware solution that prevents abusive increments. This library is designed to integrate with any Golang web framework, like , , or even basic , and is database-agnostic, supporting PostgreSQL seamlessly.</p><p>When you add  to your application, you can begin tracking views instantly‚Äîwithout having to write separate APIs for each table. Let‚Äôs say you have tables like  or , each with a  column. Instead of building an API specifically to increment the  each time a user views a page, you can use  to track this automatically.</p><p>Here‚Äôs how it works in practice:</p><p>In your database, you simply add the  column to your tables like so:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>The same goes for your other tables. No need for complicated queries or APIs‚Äîjust a simple column to track views. </p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Integrating Viewscount into Your Application\n</h3><p>The best part of  is that it‚Äôs designed to be . Whether you're using , , or even , you can easily integrate it into your application. Here‚Äôs how you can add it as middleware in :</p><p>First, you‚Äôll need to initialize the view tracker in your app:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Once you‚Äôve set up the middleware, you can add it to your routes. Here‚Äôs how you do it:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>This simple setup integrates the  library into your existing app. The middleware will automatically track views on the specified table and increment the  column as needed, while also providing protection against abuse.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  The Benefits of Viewscount\n</h3><ol><li>: With just a few lines of code, you can integrate view counting into any of your existing tables.</li><li>: The library is designed to work with any Golang web framework, making it easy to use in your project regardless of the stack.</li><li><strong>Prevention of DOS Attacks</strong>: By limiting rapid requests that could artificially inflate view counts,  ensures that the data remains reliable and accurate.</li><li>: No need for custom APIs or complex queries‚Äîjust use the library and track views automatically in real time.</li></ol><p> solves a common problem in application development: how to track views across tables securely and efficiently without having to build a separate API for each table. Its easy integration, ability to prevent DOS-style attacks, and framework-agnostic design make it a powerful tool for developers building modern Golang applications.</p><p>Feel free to contribute to the project and raise issues or suggestions via <a href=\"https://github.com/mikebionic/viewscount\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Viewscount GitHub</a>.
