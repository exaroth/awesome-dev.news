You define the  upfront.\"</p><p>\"Right. That's what I did.\"</p><p>\"In Go, we can do it differently. We can define interfaces , not where they are implemented.

This makes testing difficult because mocks must implement every method, even the ones irrelevant to the test.</p><p><strong>Consumer-Defined Interfaces:</strong>\nIn Go, interfaces should be defined by the  (the function calling the code), not the  (the struct implementing the code).</p><ul><li> Export a massive  interface in your  package.</li><li> Define a small  interface in your  package that only includes the method you call.</li></ul><p><strong>\"Accept Interfaces, Return Structs\":</strong>\nA standard Go design pattern.</p><ul><li><strong>Functions should accept interfaces:</strong> This allows you to pass in any implementation (real or mock).</li><li><strong>Functions should return concrete structs:</strong> This gives the consumer the freedom to define their own small interfaces to describe that struct.</li></ul><p>\nA type satisfies an interface if it implements the required methods. No explicit declaration (like ) is required. This allows you to create new, small interfaces that work with existing code without modifying the original structs.</p><p><em>Next chapter: The Defer Statement.

It systematically checks if passing through an intermediate letter 'k' provides a cheaper path between letters 'i' and 'j'.

It’s handling thousands of requests like a champ. But what happens when Black Friday hits, and millions of users flood your app? 😅 Will it scale? Can you spot issues before customers do? This guide will take you from a local Go prototype to a production-ready, battle-tested system that thrives under pressure.</p><p><p>\nIf you’ve got 1–2 years of Go experience, know your way around goroutines and HTTP servers, but feel shaky about large-scale deployment or monitoring, this is for you. We’ll demystify Docker, Kubernetes, CI/CD, and monitoring with real-world code and tips. No fluff—just practical steps to make your Go app shine. 🌟</p></p><p><p>\nGo is the superhero of cloud-native apps. Its goroutines juggle thousands of tasks effortlessly, single-binary deployments are a breeze, and its standard library is like a developer’s Swiss Army knife. Whether you’re building for a global e-commerce surge or a rock-solid payment system, Go’s got your back.</p></p><p><p>\nWe’ll cover Go’s concurrency magic, containerizing with Docker, scaling with Kubernetes, automating with CI/CD, and monitoring like a pro with Prometheus, Zap, and OpenTelemetry. Expect code snippets, real-world pitfalls, and a repo to play with (</p><code>github.com/example/go-large-scale</code>). Let’s dive in! 🏊‍♂️</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Why Go Rocks for Large-Scale Apps\n</h2><p>Go is like a lightweight sports car for network apps—fast, reliable, and built for the cloud. Let’s see why it’s perfect for handling millions of requests daily, using an e-commerce API as our example.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  🧵 Concurrency That Scales\n</h3><p>Go’s goroutines are lightweight threads (just a few KB!) that handle thousands of concurrent requests without breaking a sweat. Channels keep data in sync safely. Compare that to Java’s heavy threads or Python’s async juggling—Go’s concurrency is a game-changer.</p><p>: Our e-commerce API spawns a goroutine per product request, aggregating results via channels. It handled 10,000 requests/second with ease, while Java might choke on thread overhead.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  📦 Single-Binary Simplicity\n</h3><p>Go compiles to a single binary—no runtime dependencies, no mess. Unlike Python’s dependency nightmares or Node.js’s  chaos, Go’s deployment is as easy as copying a file.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  🛠️ Built-In Tools and Ecosystem\n</h3><p>Go’s  and  packages are ready-made for networking. Its ecosystem—think Prometheus for metrics or Zap for logging—integrates like LEGO bricks. 🧱</p><p>Static compilation and efficient garbage collection keep Go apps stable. Our e-commerce API ran for months without restarts, sipping just 500MB of memory.</p><div><table><tbody><tr></tr><tr></tr><tr></tr></tbody></table></div><h3>\n  \n  \n  Segment 2: Deployment Strategies\n</h3><h2>\n  \n  \n  Deploying Go Apps Like a Boss 🏎️\n</h2><p>Deploying a Go app is like prepping a race car: you need a solid base (Docker), smart orchestration (Kubernetes), and automation (CI/CD). Let’s use an e-commerce order service to show how to handle traffic spikes like Black Friday.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  🐳 Docker: Your App’s Shipping Container\n</h3><p>Docker packages your Go app for consistency across environments. Go’s single-binary nature makes Docker images tiny and fast.</p><p>: Use multi-stage Docker builds to keep images lean. Compile with , run with , and set  for a static binary.</p><p>: Our order service once failed due to missing timezone data in Alpine. Adding  fixed it.</p><p>Here’s a slick Dockerfile:</p><div><pre><code>0 linux go build  order-service ./cmd/order-service\n\napk add  tzdata\n</code></pre></div><p>This cut our image size to ~15MB and slashed deployment time by 40%. 🚀</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  ☸️ Kubernetes: Your Traffic Maestro\n</h3><p>Kubernetes (K8s) is like a race engineer, scaling and balancing your app dynamically. Our order service used K8s to handle traffic surges.</p><p>: Set  for redundancy, use  for health checks, and define / to avoid resource hogs.</p><p>: A too-tight  (5s interval, 1s timeout) caused pod restarts during network hiccups. Loosening to 10s initial delay and 3s timeout fixed it.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><h3>\n  \n  \n  🤖 CI/CD: Automate All the Things\n</h3><p>CI/CD is your assembly line, pushing code to production smoothly. We used GitHub Actions to build, test, and deploy Docker images.</p><p>: Split workflows (lint, test, build, push) and secure secrets with environment variables.</p><p>: A missing  broke our CI. Validating env vars saved the day.</p><p>Here’s a GitHub Actions workflow:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>: During Black Friday, our order service handled 100,000 requests/minute. K8s scaled pods dynamically, and CI/CD ensured zero-downtime updates. 🎉</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Segment 3: Monitoring Like a Pro\n</h3><h2>\n  \n  \n  Monitoring Your Go App: Catch Issues Before They Blow Up 💥\n</h2><p>Monitoring is your app’s dashboard, showing its health in real time. For a payment system, you need to spot bottlenecks fast. Let’s cover metrics, logging, tracing, and alerts.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  📊 Key Metrics with Prometheus\n</h3><p>Track latency, error rates, throughput (QPS), goroutine counts, and memory usage. Go’s  makes Prometheus integration a breeze.</p><p>: Use custom metrics like . Use  for latency,  for errors.</p><p>: Generic metric names like “errors” slowed debugging. Specific names like  cut debug time in half.</p><p>Here’s a latency metric setup:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><h3>\n  \n  \n  📝 Structured Logging with Zap\n</h3><p>Logs are your app’s diary. Structured JSON logs (via  or ) are easy to query.</p><p>: Add fields like  and . Sample low-priority logs to save resources.</p><p>: Unthrottled debug logs ate 50GB of disk. A 1GB rolling log strategy fixed it.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><h3>\n  \n  \n  🗺️ Distributed Tracing with OpenTelemetry\n</h3><p>Tracing tracks requests across microservices, like GPS for your app. OpenTelemetry or Jaeger pinpoints slow queries.</p><p>: Use unique s and sample selectively (e.g., 10% for most endpoints, 100% for critical ones).</p><p>: Full tracing overloaded our backend. Sampling 10% balanced observability and performance.</p><p>Here’s an OpenTelemetry example:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><h3>\n  \n  \n  🚨 Visualization and Alerts with Grafana\n</h3><p>Grafana turns metrics into beautiful dashboards. Set alerts (e.g., Slack for 99th percentile latency &gt;1s) to catch issues early.</p><p>: Export dashboards as JSON for reuse. Set thresholds like 5% error rate over 5 minutes.</p><p>: Over-sensitive alerts spammed our team. Adjusting thresholds reduced noise.</p><p>: Grafana caught a 2-second latency spike in our payment system. Tracing revealed a slow DB query, fixed with an index, dropping latency to 200ms. 🙌</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Segment 4: Best Practices and Wrap-Up\n</h3><h2>\n  \n  \n  Best Practices and Gotchas 🛑\n</h2><p>Deploying and monitoring Go apps is like tuning a race car—precision matters. Here’s what we learned:</p><ul><li>: Use multi-stage Docker builds, set K8s resource limits, and add health checks.</li><li>: Track business metrics, use structured logs, and add tracing for microservices.</li><li>: Leverage  for timeouts and  for goroutine leaks.</li></ul><ul><li>: A payment service hit 10GB memory due to a blocked channel.  and timeouts saved us.</li><li>: Bad pool settings caused hangs. Monitoring  and capping connections fixed it.</li><li>: Generic names slowed debugging. Clear names like <code>service_operation_errors_total</code> sped things up.</li></ul><p>: Our order service crashed from goroutine leaks.  and Prometheus traced it to a forgotten channel. Adding  stabilized it.</p><p>Go’s concurrency, simplicity, and ecosystem make it a dream for large-scale apps. With Docker, Kubernetes, and tools like Prometheus and OpenTelemetry, you can build systems that scale and stay observable. Start small: build an API, containerize it, add metrics, and scale with K8s.</p><ul><li>: Go will dominate in Kubernetes and Istio.\n</li><li>: Its fast startup makes it perfect for serverless apps.\n</li><li>: Go’s simplicity lets me focus on code, not config. Its tools make debugging a breeze. Try it—deploy a small service and watch it shine! ✨</li></ul><p>: Clone the repo at <code>github.com/example/go-large-scale</code>, deploy a simple API, and experiment with Prometheus and K8s.

What could go wrong?\"</p><p>Everything. Everything could go wrong.</p><p>That wildcard meant teams could create any auth mount type, not just the standard AppRole we supported. So they did:</p><p>Custom AppRole mounts: auth/my-special-approle/</p><p>Random Kubernetes auth (we don't even use K8s auth)</p><p>LDAP configs that bypassed our central auth</p><p>Experimental mounts nobody remembered creating</p><p>Out of 50+ namespaces, 15% had rogue auth mounts we didn't know existed.</p><p>Why This Actually Mattered\nMonitoring blindspot: Our Splunk dashboards looked for auth/approle/. These custom mounts were invisible.</p><p>Support hell: Teams configured Vault Agents wrong, got auth failures, opened tickets. We couldn't help because their setup didn't match our docs.</p><p>Future nightmare: Try migrating 50 namespaces when everyone's doing their own thing.</p><p>How I Found It\nSimple inventory script:</p><p><code>for namespace in all_namepaces:\n    auth_mounts = vault_client.sys.list_auth_methods()<p>\n    for mount in auth_mounts:</p>\n        if mount not in ['approle/', 'token/']:<p>\n            print(f\"WTF is this: {namespace}/{mount}\")</p></code></p><p>The output was... concerning.</p><p>Checked Splunk to see if anyone was actually using these:</p><p><code>index=vault_audit request.path=\"auth/*/login\"\n| stats count by request.namespace request.path</code></p><p>40% had zero logins in 90 days.

Be explicit. Always.</p><p>Your monitoring only catches what you're looking for. Inventory everything, not just what you expect.</p><p>Standards aren't real until you enforce them. Documentation doesn't count if the system allows chaos.</p><p>Fixing production takes forever. We're still cleaning this up.</p><p>The Bigger Issue\nThis also exposed that our parent/child namespace model was overly complex. We eventually flattened everything - but that's Part 2.</p><p>If You Run Vault\nCheck your policies right now:</p><p>vault policy read your-policy | grep \"*\"</p><p>Every wildcard is a potential problem. Can you be more specific?</p><p>Then actually inventory what exists in your Vault. I bet you'll find surprises.</p><p>Next up: Why we ditched nested namespaces and went flat.

It is well-known to be useful for logs and API calls, among other things. And your favorite AI assistant API is one place you'll probably find it.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.csvpath.org\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">CsvPath Framework</a> supports validating JSONL. (In fact, it supports JSONL for the whole data preboarding lifecycle, but that's a longer story). </p><p>And now <a href=\"https://github.com/csvpath/csvpath\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">CsvPath Validation Language</a> supports JSONPath expressions. Since AI prompts are only kinda sorta JSONL, having JSONPath to dig into them is helpful.</p><p>What I mean by kinda-sorta is that your basic prompt sequence is a series of JSON lines, but the lines are all 1-column wide and arbitrarily deep. That sounds more like a series of JSON \"documents\" than it does like single JSONL stream. Or, anyway, that's my take.</p><p>Let's look at how to use JSONPath to inspect a JSONL file using CsvPath Validation Language in <a href=\"https://www.flightpathdata.com\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">FlightPath Data</a>. For those of you who don't already know, FlightPath Data is the dev and ops frontend to CsvPath Framework. It is a free and open source download from the <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/flightpath-data/id6745823097\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Apple MacOS Store</a> or the <a href=\"https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/9P9PBPKZ4JDF\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Microsoft Store</a>.</p><p>The file is a common example prompt. We'll start by looking at one line.</p><div><pre><code>{\n  \"messages\": [\n    {\n      \"role\": \"system\",\n      \"content\": \"You are a happy assistant that puts a positive spin on everything.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"role\": \"user\",\n      \"content\": \"I'm hungry.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"role\": \"assistant\",\n      \"content\": \"Eat a banana!\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n</code></pre></div><p>From CsvPath Framework's perspective this is a one-header document. The one header is . If you open this in the grid view you see only the one header. <em>(i.e. one column; but with delimited files we try to stick to the word \"header\" because with \"column\" your RDBMS-soaked brain starts to make incorrect assumptions)</em>.</p><p>Here's what it looks like: </p><p>That's not super fun. The reason is that:</p><ol><li>JSONL doesn't present its headers in the grid view (for good reasons)</li><li>The  header is arbitrarily deeply nested, unlike the typical JSONL log line</li></ol><p>Nevertheless, that's what we have. Will it blend? I mean validate? Yes. JSONPath to the rescue. That said I'll pause to admit that I'm not a JSONPath expert.</p><p>Right-click in the project files tree on the left of FlightPath and create a new  file, e.g. . Drop this simple example in it.</p><div><pre><code>$[*][ \n    push(\"roles\", jsonpath(#messages, \"$[?(@.role == 'assistant')].content\") )\n\n    last() -&gt; print(\"See the variables tab for results\")\n]\n</code></pre></div><p>You can see the  function. It is acting on the  header, as we'd want. We're pushing the data pulled by the JSONPath expression into a stack variable named . </p><p>A stack variable is like a Python list or tuple. You create a variable by using it.  is part of the set of zero or more variables that are available throughout the csvpath statement run. They are captured to the Variables tab for a one-off FlightPath Data test run. For a production run they end up in the  file in the run results.</p><p>Put your cursor in the csvpath statement and click  (or  on Windows). The output tabs should open at the bottom-middle of the screen, below your csvpath file. Click to the  tab and have a look.</p><div><pre><code>$[?(@.role == 'assistant')].content\n</code></pre></div><p>picked out the objects in the  array where  equaled . And from those objects it extracted and returned the value of the  key. </p><p>Pretty simple stuff. Tho, I have to admit it took me a few minutes to wrap  my JSONPath-inexperienced head around the context for the JSONPath expression. I was thinking of the whole document or the whole line, but that wasn't right.</p><p>It is obviously the JSON value assigned to the  key, which is an array, in this case. Once I was operating from that correct context, the JSONPath became pretty straightforward. (Those of us with XPath scars need not be as afraid as we might be!)</p><p>The point here is two-part. First, we can deal with AI prompts or any other JSONL that is deeply nested. Hooray! The data may look odd, if you are comparing it to regular tabular data, but that's no reason to not validate. </p><p>Second, this example makes the point that we're doing JSONPath rules-based validation within our CsvPath context. How very Schematron-like, since Schematron does XPath validation within XSLT. </p><p>Maybe this sounds complicated, but really it's not. CsvPath Validation Language is great for all things line-oriented. In this case, there isn't much for it to do, except hand off to JSONPath, which is great at documents (a.k.a. objects). Simple enough.</p><p>If we wanted to create a bunch of JSONPath rules to validate our AI prompt JSONL, we could do that. To just do a quick throw-away second rule as an example try this:</p><div><pre><code>$[*][ \n    push(\"roles\", jsonpath(#messages, \"$[?(@.role == 'assistant')].content\") )\n\n    @stmts = jsonpath(#0, \"$.`len`\")\n    print(\"Line $.csvpath.line_number: $.variables.stmts\")\n    @stmts == 3 \n\n    last.nocontrib() -&gt; print(\"See the variables tab for results\")\n]\n</code></pre></div><p>That new rule will net you 2 lines, which are either valid or failed, depending on how you want to use your csvpath statement. You will see them in the  tab.</p><p>At the same time the expanded csvpath statement will continue to pull in the same data to the variables tab that we got with the first version of the csvpath.</p><p>To clean it up just a little, you can do:</p><div><pre><code>$[*][ \n    push(\"roles\", jsonpath(#messages, \"$[?(@.role == 'assistant')].content\") )\n\n    jsonpath(#0, \"$.`len`\") == 3\n]\n</code></pre></div><p>There you go, a valid 2-rule validation statement using JSONPath on nested JSON in a JSONL document.

For example, the Flutter SDK handles the ingestion stream and retries, acting as a clean interface to the engine.</p>\nTrade-offs &amp; Decisions Redis has geospatial capabilities (GEOADD, GEORADIUS), but it is primarily optimized for \"radius\" (point + distance) queries. My use case required strict Polygon geofencing (complex shapes). While Redis 6.2+ added some shape support, PostGIS remains the gold standard for robust topological operations.<p>\nWhy Serverless? The traffic pattern for logistics is spiky. It peaks during business hours and drops to near zero at night. Cloud Run allows me to pay strictly for the CPU time used during ingestion, rather than provisioning a fixed server.</p>\nOpen Source?<p>\nWhile the core backend engine runs internally for my project (to keep the infrastructure managed), I realized the Client SDKs are valuable on their own as a reference for structuring location ingestion.</p><p>\nI’ve open-sourced the SDKs to share how the protocol works:</p></p><p>I'm currently optimizing the \"State Drift\" issue in Terraform and looking into moving the event bus to Pub/Sub for better decoupling.</p><p>I’d love to hear feedback on the architecture—specifically if anyone has experience scaling PostGIS for high-write workloads!</p>","contentLength":3235,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Selamat Datang Di Sayabet","url":"https://dev.to/cssayabet/selamat-datang-di-sayabet-2oni","date":1769645211,"author":"Sayabet_Gacor","guid":425607,"unread":true,"content":"<p>Situs Resmi Dan Terpercaya Tahun 2026!!

Historically, privacy was relegated to the domain of legal compliance—a passive exercise in drafting Terms of Service, consent forms, and retention policies. In the modern data ecosystem, however, privacy has evolved into a hard engineering constraint. It is no longer sufficient to promise privacy; systems must be architected to enforce it deterministically.</p><p>For senior privacy engineers and data platform architects, the mandate is clear: shift from \"compliance by policy\" to \"compliance by code.\" The ingestion of unstructured data—whether through high-concurrency web scraping, log aggregation, or third-party API consumption—introduces a significant risk vector. Personally Identifiable Information (PII) acts as a contaminant within the data lake, turning valuable datasets into \"toxic assets\" that attract regulatory scrutiny and compromise downstream machine learning models.</p><p>This blog articulates a comprehensive framework for \"Privacy Engineering,\" treating data sanitization as a core software engineering discipline. We explore the architectural failure modes of naive ingestion, the technical supremacy of Microsoft Presidio as a detection standard, and the implementation of robust, privacy-aware pipelines. By integrating Named Entity Recognition (NER), context-aware logic, and advanced cryptographic redaction strategies, engineering teams can dismantle the traditional friction between data utility and data privacy, ensuring alignment with GDPR, CCPA, and emerging AI safety standards.</p><p>Let make our mood light with a pretty funny meme 😊!</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  The Anatomy of a Failure: When \"Public\" Data Becomes a Liability\n</h2><p>To understand the necessity of privacy engineering, one must first analyze the catastrophic failure modes of naive data ingestion. A prevailing misconception among data engineers is that \"public\" data—information accessible without authentication on the open web—is free from privacy constraints. This assumption is legally perilous and technically flawed.</p><p>Consider a hypothetical scenario involving \"FinScrape Analytics,\" a fintech entity developing alternative credit scoring models. The engineering team deploys a distributed scraping architecture using headless browsers (e.g., Playwright or Selenium) to aggregate professional profiles from public social media platforms, industry forums, and corporate \"About Us\" pages. The objective is to extract job titles, employment history, and public endorsements to infer creditworthiness.</p><p> The scraper is designed to extract  and  content based on CSS selectors. However, the unstructured text within these containers often contains unsolicited PII that the scraper is not designed to recognize or filter.</p><ul><li> A forum post scraped for sentiment analysis contains a user pasting their personal phone number and email address to resolve a customer service dispute.</li><li> A scraped corporate biography inadvertently captures a home address listed alongside a business address, or a personal mobile number used for emergency contact.</li><li> The text contains inferred political opinions, trade union membership, or health data (Special Category Data under GDPR Article 9), which requires explicit consent to process, regardless of its public availability.</li></ul><h3>\n  \n  \n  The Regulatory Blast Radius\n</h3><p>Upon ingestion, this raw text is serialized (e.g., JSON or Avro) and dumped into a Data Lake (S3, Azure Blob Storage) and subsequently loaded into a data warehouse like Snowflake. The PII is now \"at rest\" and replicated across multiple environments (development, staging, production).</p><ul><li><strong>GDPR Violation (Article 5 - Data Minimization):</strong> The company collected data irrelevant to the specified purpose. The principle of data minimization dictates that only data strictly necessary for the purpose should be processed.</li><li><strong>GDPR Violation (Article 14 - Notification):</strong> Since the data was not obtained directly from the subject, the company maintains an obligation to notify the individuals—an operational impossibility given the volume of millions of records.</li><li> Regulatory bodies like the French CNIL and Irish DPC have aggressively penalized companies for scraping public data without valid legal bases or sanitization measures. For instance, the French DPA fined a data broker €240,000 for scraping LinkedIn profiles without adequate transparency or legal basis, emphasizing that \"public\" availability does not negate privacy rights. Similarly, Meta (Facebook) faced a €265 million fine related to a scraping leak, underscoring that the failure to implement \"technical and organizational measures\" to prevent PII harvesting is a punishable offense.</li></ul><p> The failure was not in the scraping code’s ability to fetch HTML, but in the pipeline’s lack of a \"Privacy Firewall.\" Privacy Engineering dictates that no unstructured text should land in persistent storage without passing through a decontamination layer.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Privacy Engineering: A Core Discipline\n</h2><p>The transition from legal checkpoints to engineering checkpoints requires a fundamental change in how data pipelines are conceived. Privacy Engineering operationalizes abstract legal principles into concrete code execution, moving the responsibility from the legal department to the DevOps and Data Engineering teams.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  The Privacy-by-Design Pipeline Model\n</h3><p>Traditional ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes often treat privacy as a governance task performed after loading—typically triggered by an audit or a Data Subject Access Request (DSAR). Privacy Engineering moves this to the \"Transform\" phase, or even earlier, to the \"Extraction\" phase, creating a proactive defense mechanism.</p><p><strong>Table 1: The Shift from Compliance to Engineering</strong></p><div><table><thead><tr><th>Legal/Compliance Approach</th><th>Privacy Engineering Approach</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Ingestion event (Real-time/Batch)</td></tr><tr><td>Policy documents &amp; retention schedules</td><td>Code-level filtering &amp; sanitization</td></tr><tr><td>Retroactive deletion/suppression</td><td>Proactive redaction/tokenization</td></tr><tr><td>Spreadsheets, Legal Counsel</td><td>NLP Models, Regex, Vaults, Presidio</td></tr><tr><td>Compliance Certifications (SOC2, ISO)</td><td>Recall/Precision of PII Detection, Latency</td></tr><tr></tr></tbody></table></div><h3>\n  \n  \n  Shift Left: Sanitization at the Edge\n</h3><p>The most effective privacy architecture sanitizes data as close to the source as possible. In a scraping context, this means analyzing the text payload within the scraper’s memory space or immediately upon message queue ingestion (e.g., Kafka, Kinesis), before writing to disk. This aligns with the GDPR principle of <strong>Data Protection by Design and by Default (Article 25)</strong>. By stripping PII from the payload before it enters the data lake, the \"toxic asset\" liability is neutralized immediately. Raw identifiers never spread across logs, backups, or downstream systems, limiting the \"blast radius\" of any potential breach.</p><p>This \"Shift Left\" approach fundamentally changes the economics of data protection. Remediation of PII deep within a data warehouse is computationally expensive and operationally complex (requiring rewrite of immutable partitions). Sanitization at ingestion is a linear cost associated with compute, preventing the compounding debt of privacy risk.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Technical Deep Dive: Microsoft Presidio\n</h2><p>To implement this vision, engineers require a robust, extensible, and production-ready detection engine. Microsoft Presidio has emerged as the industry standard open-source framework for this purpose. Unlike proprietary SaaS solutions that act as black boxes, Presidio offers the transparency, modularity, and on-premises deployment capabilities required for high-stakes engineering.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Architecture: Separation of Concerns\n</h3><p>Presidio’s architecture is bifurcated into two distinct, decoupled services: the  and the . This separation is critical for auditability and flexibility, allowing detection logic to evolve independently of redaction policies.</p><p>\nThe Analyzer is the detection brain. It ingests unstructured text and outputs a list of detected entities with confidence scores and location indices. It is stateless and read-only regarding the text transformation.</p><ul><li> The  coordinates the detection process. It manages a registry of \"Recognizers\" and aggregates their results.</li><li> These are the logic units. Presidio supports multiple types to maximize coverage and accuracy:\n\n<ul><li> Use Regular Expressions (Regex) for structured data like credit card numbers, email addresses, and IP addresses. These are computationally efficient and deterministic.</li><li> Utilize Named Entity Recognition (NER) models (via spaCy, Stanza, or HuggingFace Transformers) to detect context-dependent entities like Person Names (PER), Locations (LOC), and Organizations (ORG). This allows the system to distinguish \"George Washington\" (Person) from \"Washington\" (Location).</li><li> Implement complex validation logic, such as Luhn algorithm checks for credit cards or checksums for national IDs, reducing false positives from random number sequences.</li><li> These components boost the confidence score of a detected entity if specific \"context words\" are found in proximity (e.g., boosting a 9-digit number's score if the word \"SSN\" or \"Social\" appears nearby).</li></ul></li></ul><p>\nThe Anonymizer is the transformation muscle. It accepts the original text and the metadata payload from the Analyzer (the list of  objects) to apply specific operations.</p><ul><li> The Anonymizer executes \"Operators\" on the detected spans. Standard operators include  (substitution),  (deletion),  (e.g., ), and  (SHA-256/512).</li><li> Crucially, the Anonymizer supports encryption operators, allowing for reversible pseudonymization if the engineering team manages the encryption keys securely. This enables specific authorized workflows to decrypt data while keeping it opaque to general analytics.</li></ul><h3>\n  \n  \n  NER vs. Regex: The Precision-Recall Trade-off\n</h3><p>A sophisticated privacy engineer understands when to deploy NER versus Regex, as the choice impacts both accuracy and system latency.</p><p><strong>Regular Expressions (Regex):</strong></p><ul><li> Pattern matching based on character sequences.</li><li> Highly structured identifiers (Email, IPv4/v6, IBAN, SSN, Phone Numbers).</li><li> Extremely low latency, deterministic, high precision for strict formats.</li><li> Fails on unstructured, ambiguous entities. A regex cannot reliably distinguish a person's name from a street name or a common noun. Broad regex patterns (e.g., \\d{9}) suffer from high false-positive rates without context.</li></ul><p><strong>Named Entity Recognition (NER):</strong></p><ul><li> Statistical models (Deep Learning/Transformers) trained on labeled corpora (e.g., OntoNotes) to predict entity tags based on linguistic context and word vectors.</li><li> Unstructured entities (Person Names, Organizations, Geopolitical Entities).</li><li> Context-aware. Can identify \"Apple\" as an Organization in \"Apple released a phone\" and as a fruit in \"I ate an apple.\"</li><li> Higher latency (requires model inference), non-deterministic (probabilistic), requires GPU/TPU for high throughput, larger memory footprint. Evaluation on datasets like CoNLL shows high F1 scores but highlights the computational cost.</li></ul><p> Presidio excels by combining both. It uses NER to find the \"Person\" and Regex to find the \"Email,\" then aggregates the results using a conflict resolution strategy (e.g., prioritizing the match with the higher confidence score). This hybrid approach allows engineers to leverage the speed of regex for structured data while relying on the sophistication of NER for ambiguous text.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Multilingual Support and NLP Engines\n</h3><p>Global scraping operations encounter diverse languages, necessitating a multilingual approach. Presidio’s abstraction layer allows swapping the underlying NLP engine via the .</p><ul><li> The default engine. Fast, production-ready, with models available for dozens of languages (e.g., , , ). It strikes a balance between performance and accuracy.</li><li> A Stanford NLP library that often provides higher accuracy for low-resource languages but comes with a higher latency cost. Presidio supports integration with .</li><li> For state-of-the-art accuracy, engineers can integrate HuggingFace Transformers models (e.g., BERT, RoBERTa) tailored for NER tasks. While computationally intensive, these models offer superior performance on complex, nuanced text.</li></ul><h2>\n  \n  \n  Architecting the Privacy-Aware Scraping Pipeline\n</h2><p>To operationalize Presidio, we propose a \"Privacy Firewall\" architecture. This pipeline ensures that no raw data is persisted without inspection, adhering to the principle of \"Defense in Depth\".</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  The Pipeline Flow: Scrape -&gt; Detect -&gt; Redact -&gt; Audit -&gt; Store\n</h3><h3>\n  \n  \n  Python Integration Workflow\n</h3><p>The following section details the code implementation of this architecture, demonstrating how to integrate Presidio into a Python-based processing worker.</p><p>\nFirst, we establish the environment with the necessary libraries. We initialize the  with a registry containing both pre-defined and custom recognizers.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>4.2.2 The Ingestion and Cleaning Phase\nScraped content is often raw HTML. Analyzing HTML tags directly can confuse NER models (e.g., misinterpreting class names as entities). We must extract visible text while preserving structure where necessary for context.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><h3>\n  \n  \n  The Detection and Redaction Core\n</h3><p>This is the heart of the pipeline. We define a transformation policy: Names are replaced with placeholders, Phones are masked, and specific internal IDs are hashed to allow for referential integrity without exposure.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>This code snippet demonstrates a self-contained, reproducible unit of the Privacy Firewall. In a production environment, the  function would be the entry point for the Kafka consumer worker.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Advanced Redaction Strategies: Beyond Simple Masking\n</h2><p>While simple masking () satisfies basic compliance, it often destroys data utility. Analytics and ML teams typically need to preserve the referential integrity of the data without exposing the identity. For example, knowing that \"User A\" behaved similarly to \"User B\" is valuable, even if we don't know who \"User A\" is. Privacy Engineering offers several advanced strategies to bridge this gap.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Hashing (Deterministic Anonymization)\n</h2><p>Hashing converts PII into a fixed-size string (e.g., SHA-256).</p><ul><li>. Presidio supports this via the  operator.</li><li> Consistent. The same email address always hashes to the same string, allowing for  operations across different datasets and frequency analysis (e.g., \"How many unique users visited?\").</li><li> Vulnerable to Rainbow Table attacks if the input space is small (e.g., phone numbers or 6-digit IDs). To mitigate this, engineers must apply a cryptographic salt (a random string added to the input before hashing). Presidio allows configuration of hash types (, , ).</li></ul><h3>\n  \n  \n  Reversible Tokenization (Vault-Based)\n</h3><p>For scenarios where PII might need to be recovered (e.g., a support ticket scraping pipeline where an agent might need to contact the user later), irreversible hashing is insufficient. We need .</p><p>In a Vault-based architecture, the PII is swapped for a random token (UUID or a format-preserving token). The mapping (Token &lt;-&gt; PII) is stored in a secure, isolated \"Vault\" (e.g., Redis or an encrypted SQL table) with strict access controls.</p><p><strong>Presidio Integration with Vaults:</strong> While Presidio handles the detection and logic, the \"Vault\" interaction usually requires a custom operator or an integration with the  operator using a symmetric key.</p><ul><li> When Presidio detects an entity, it calls a custom function that checks the Vault (e.g., Redis). If the PII exists, it retrieves the token; if not, it generates a new token, saves the pair to the Vault, and returns the token to replace the text.</li><li> This concentrates the risk into the Vault. Securing the Vault (via encryption at rest, strict IAM roles, and network isolation) secures the entire dataset.</li></ul><p><strong>Table 2: Redaction Strategy Comparison</strong></p><div><table><thead><tr></tr></thead><tbody><tr></tr><tr></tr><tr></tr><tr><td>High (Decryption possible)</td></tr><tr><td>High (Referential integrity)</td><td>Highest (Data separation)</td></tr></tbody></table></div><h3>\n  \n  \n  Cryptographic Erasure and Deanonymization\n</h3><p>A profound benefit of encryption-based pseudonymization or vault-based tokenization is \"Cryptographic Erasure.\" To comply with a GDPR \"Right to be Forgotten\" (Article 17) request, one does not need to hunt down every instance of a user's data across petabytes of backups and data lakes. Instead, one simply destroys the encryption key or the Vault mapping associated with that user. The data remains in the lake but is mathematically irretrievable—effectively erased.</p><p>Conversely, authorized systems can use the <strong>Presidio Deanonymize Engine</strong> to revert the process. By providing the encrypted text and the correct key (or token and Vault access), the  restores the original PII for legitimate business purposes.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  GDPR/CCPA Alignment via Code\n</h2><p>Privacy Engineering translates legal articles into software functions, providing demonstrable compliance.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Data Minimization (GDPR Art. 5(1)(c))\n</h3><p>The code in Section 4.2.3 explicitly defines . By detecting only specific types and ignoring others, the system enforces minimization. If the scraper encounters a  but that entity is not in the  list (or is in a configured block-list), it is not processed as PII. Alternatively, if strict minimization is required, the policy can be configured to redact any detected entity type unless explicitly allowed (Allow-list approach).</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Purpose Limitation (GDPR Art. 5(1)(b))\n</h3><p>By segregating the PII into a secure Vault (Tokenization) or hashing it, we technologically enforce purpose limitation. Data Scientists act on the tokenized data for modeling (Purpose A - Analytics). Customer Support accesses the Vault to retrieve the email (Purpose B - Support). Access Control Lists (ACLs) on the Vault enforce the separation, ensuring that analysts cannot accidentally view raw contact details.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Contextual Logic for False Positives\n</h3><p>Presidio allows \"Context Words.\" For example, to reduce false positives for , the recognizer can be configured to require words like \"driver\", \"license\", \"id\", or \"dl\" to appear within a window of N tokens around the match. This is crucial for reducing \"over-redaction,\" where non-PII data (like product serial numbers) is mistakenly redacted, destroying data utility. This tuning directly supports data accuracy principles.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><h2>\n  \n  \n  Operational Excellence: Tuning and Monitoring\n</h2><p>Deploying Presidio in production is an iterative process. Models drift, and scraping targets change structure. Operational excellence requires continuous monitoring and tuning.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Handling False Positives and Negatives\n</h3><ul><li> Do not deploy straight to production with active redaction. Run the pipeline in \"Shadow Mode\" where detection results are logged but not applied (or applied to a shadow copy of the data). A human analyst or a secondary automated system samples the logs to verify recall (Did we miss PII?) and precision (Did we redact valid text?).</li><li> Presidio returns a confidence score (0.0 - 1.0) for each detection.\n\n<ul><li> (e.g., handling medical data/PHI): Set a  (e.g., 0.3-0.4) to prioritize . It is better to redact a harmless number than to leak a patient ID (False Positive &gt; False Negative).</li><li> Set a  (e.g., 0.7-0.8) to prioritize Precision. You want to preserve data utility and avoid corrupting the dataset with aggressive redaction.</li></ul></li><li> Maintain an allow-list for terms that look like PII but aren't (e.g., company support emails , known dummy numbers, or generic addresses). Presidio supports  functionality to bypass specific values.</li></ul><h3>\n  \n  \n  Performance Tuning and Latency\n</h3><ul><li> NER models (spaCy/Transformers) are CPU/GPU intensive. For high-throughput scraping (thousands of pages/sec), Presidio can become a bottleneck. Benchmarks indicate that out-of-the-box spaCy models have a latency of ~15ms per sample, while Transformer-based models can spike to ~50ms+ per sample.\n\n<ul><li> Use  to process texts in bulk, amortizing the overhead of model calls.</li><li> Offload detection to GPU-enabled nodes if using Transformer models.</li><li> Use Regex-based recognizers primarily and reserve NER only for fields where context is ambiguous.</li></ul></li><li> Implementing a Redis cache for repeated text snippets (e.g., common headers/footers in scraped HTML) can drastically reduce inference costs. If the same privacy policy text appears on every scraped page, analyze it once and cache the result.</li></ul><h2>\n  \n  \n  Downstream Benefits: ML and RAG Safety\n</h2><p>The investment in upstream Privacy Engineering pays dividends downstream, particularly in the era of Generative AI and Large Language Models (LLMs).</p><p>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) involves feeding retrieved documents into an LLM context window to generate answers. If the scraped documents contain PII, the LLM might leak it in the generated answer. By sanitizing the ingestion pipeline, the Vector Database (e.g., Pinecone, Milvus) contains only anonymized embeddings. This ensures that the RAG system is \"secure by design\"—even if the LLM is prompted to reveal PII, the source data it retrieves is already clean.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Removing Bias and Memorization\n</h3><p>LLMs trained on datasets containing names and demographics often learn distinct biases associated with those identities (e.g., associating certain names with specific professions). Anonymizing names () and masking demographics helps de-bias the training data. Furthermore, it prevents the model from \"memorizing\" specific individuals, mitigating Model Inversion Attacks where an attacker queries the model to extract training data.</p><p>The era of unrestricted data collection is over. For senior engineers, the adoption of tools like Microsoft Presidio represents a necessary evolution in platform architecture. By embedding privacy controls directly into the ingestion pipeline, we move beyond the fragility of \"compliance checkboxes\" to the robustness of \"Privacy Engineering.\" We do not just protect our users; we protect the future of our data platforms. The code provided herein is your starting block—build your firewall, tune your models, and treat privacy as a first-class citizen in your software stack.

But it’s also an exhaustion game.\n​I recently consulted for a mid-sized agency here in Lagos. Their problem wasn't a lack of leads; it was Lead Fatigue.<p>\nFor every 100 people who messaged them on WhatsApp asking \"How much?\", only about 3 were serious buyers with the budget to proceed.</p>\n​The agents were spending 4 hours a day just answering the same three questions:<p>\n​\"Is it still available?\"</p>\n​\"What is the price?\"\n​They were human FAQs.<p>\n​I proposed a solution: Let’s fire the humans from the 'First Response' layer and hire an AI Agent.</p>\n​Here is how I built a system that not only answers questions but qualifies leads and books inspections automatically.\n​We didn't want a \"dumb\" chatbot that just gives static replies. We needed an Agent that could query their specific database of properties.\n​Brain: OpenAI (GPT-4o) via LangChain.<p>\n​Communication: Twilio (WhatsApp API).</p>\n​Database: Supabase (PostgreSQL + pgvector).<p>\n​Knowledge Base: A live sync of their property listings.</p>\n​Phase 1: The \"RAG\" Knowledge Base<p>\n​The biggest challenge was accuracy. The AI couldn't hallucinate a price.</p>\nWe used RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation).<p>\n​When a user asks, \"Do you have any 3-bedroom flats in Ikeja under N5m?\"</p>\n​The system converts the query into a vector.<p>\n​It searches Supabase for matching properties.</p>\n​It retrieves the exact data (Price, Location, Features).<p>\n​It feeds this to GPT-4o to generate a polite, human-like response.</p>\n​Result: The bot never guesses. It only sells what is in stock.<p>\n​Phase 2: The \"Guardrail\" Qualification</p>\n​We instructed the AI to act like a senior sales agent. Its goal wasn't just to chat; it was to qualify.\n​\"You are a helpful Real Estate Assistant. Your goal is to get the user to book an inspection. Before booking, you must politely ask for their budget and timeline. If they cannot afford the property, politely suggest cheaper alternatives.\"<p>\n​This filter alone saved the human agents hours of driving to inspections with clients who had zero intention of buying.</p>\n​Phase 3: The Handoff<p>\n​If the user is serious and agrees to a time, the AI Agent uses a \"Tool\" (via LangChain) to check the human agent's Google Calendar and book the slot.</p>\nThe human agent gets a notification: \"New Inspection Booked: Mr. Obi, 3 Bedroom, Budget Verified.\"\n​After 30 days of running this pilot:<p>\n​Response Time: Dropped from ~2 hours to &lt;1 minute.</p>\n​Agent Workload: Reduced by ~20 hours/week (no more answering \"How much?\" at 10 PM).<p>\n​Conversion: Inspection bookings increased by 15% because the bot replied instantly while leads were hot.</p>\n​Conclusion<p>\n​We are past the era of \"Chatbots.\" We are in the era of \"AI Agents.\"</p>\nA chatbot follows a script. An Agent uses tools, makes decisions, and performs work.<p>\nFor this agency, it was the difference between being busy and being profitable.</p><p>\n​Hi, I'm Frank Oge.

We have an engineering analysis process that required large amount of inputs to be collected from engineers which contained deeply nested structure with multiple input types. As any sane python developer will do these days, we used pydantic models to both structure our mental model and also to validate this massive input (which comes in the form of a yaml file)</p><p>Even though yaml is a decent format to use for structured input, it's still quite verbose to hand-craft and it can be quite tricky to get all the indents right. So we needed a decent UI which can be used to fill in this input. The thought was, Instead of writing a UI specifically for our data structure, why not infer the structure dynamically from the already existing pydantic model? It can also give us proper (and upfront) validation errors if there are errors in the input. If we can sprinkle a little more customization on top of the existing pydantic model, it can be quite powerful. That's exactly what I ended up doing (with a lot of help from claude opus 4.5).

Python. FastAPI. The technologies AI understands. Now we make sure AI doesn't write garbage.</p><p>Code reviews are a beautiful fantasy we tell ourselves. \"Someone will catch my mistakes.\" No they won't. They're checking Slack. They're thinking about lunch. They're wondering if that meeting could've been an email.</p><p>Meanwhile, your  sits there in async code, waiting to murder production at 3 AM on a Saturday. Nobody will catch it. Nobody ever does.</p><p>So I stopped pretending humans review code. I let robots do it. Robots don't get hungry. Robots don't have feelings. Robots are perfect for this job.</p><p>And here's the kicker: none of this is even testing. Not a single test runs. This is just linting. Glorified spell-check for code. We haven't even  verifying that the code does what it's supposed to do. We're just making sure it's not obviously broken before we bother checking if it works.</p><p>The bar is on the floor. And most codebases still trip over it.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Ruff: Because Life Is Too Short for Slow Linters\n</h2><p>Remember pylint? You'd run it, go make coffee, come back, still running. So everyone disabled it. Problem solved. Also: problems not solved at all.</p><p>Ruff is written in Rust. It runs in milliseconds. You can't even alt-tab fast enough to avoid it.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>That ASYNC rule at the bottom? That's the one that saves your weekends.</p><p>Here's how to tank your server in one line:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>This blocks the entire event loop. Every user. Every request. Everything stops while your code takes a little nap. No error. No warning. Just... silence. And then your phone rings at 3 AM.</p><p>No kidding. You put  in async code.</p><div><pre><code>ASYNC100: blocking call `time.sleep` in async function\n</code></pre></div><p>The fix takes two seconds:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>I make this mistake weekly.

That's the relationship.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  MyPy: Because \"It Works\" Is Not a Type\n</h2><p>Python is dynamically typed. This means you can write this:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>What is ? Could be a string. Could be a list. Could be your hopes and dreams. Python doesn't care. Python will try to call  on anything. Python believes in you.</p><p>Python is wrong to believe in you.</p><p>MyPy strict mode fixes this by being incredibly annoying:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Now you have to actually say what things are:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Is this more typing? Yes. Is this tedious? Also yes. Will this save you from a 4-hour debugging session because you passed a dict to a function expecting a string? Absolutely yes.</p><p>The AI also loves types. Give it typed code and it knows exactly what to generate. Give it untyped code and it hallucinates confidently. Your choice.</p><p>Linters catch a lot. But not everything. Third-party libraries do weird things. Someone's \"async\" wrapper is actually sync. Life is full of disappointments.</p><p>So I run tests with the event loop in paranoid mode:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Anything takes longer than 100ms? Test fails. Loudly. Rudely. Exactly as it should.</p><p>Belt and suspenders. Because I've seen things. Things that work perfectly locally and explode in production. Things that pass every test and still somehow break. Plan accordingly.</p><p>One job per check. When something fails, you know exactly what.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Three jobs. Same stage. Run in parallel. When one fails, you see exactly which one in the pipeline view. No scrolling through logs to find the error.</p><p> —  starts with a dot. GitLab won't run it directly. It's a template. DRY without the copy-paste.</p><p> — Each job inherits the template. Same image, same cache, same rules. Only the script changes.</p><p> — All three jobs run at the same time. Faster feedback. If ruff and mypy both fail, you see both failures immediately. Fix them together instead of playing whack-a-mole.</p><p> — On every job. This isn't a suggestion. Your MR sits there, rejected, until all three pass.</p><p>The pipeline doesn't care that it's Friday at 5 PM. The pipeline doesn't care that \"it works on my machine.\" The pipeline is the most reliable colleague you'll ever have.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Copy, paste, adapt.

Neither is a good idea.</p><p>The reality is: humans forget things. That's not a character flaw—that's human nature. The trick isn't to fight it. The trick is to build systems that work  it.</p><p>I write the rules once. The machines enforce them forever. They never get tired. They never get distracted.

FastAPI. TypeScript. React. PostgreSQL. Nothing exciting. Nothing cutting-edge. Nothing that will impress anyone at a conference.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  The Training Data Advantage\n</h2><p>AI generates code based on training data. More examples = better output. Simple as that.</p><p>You can use that fancy new Rust framework with 200 GitHub stars. AI will hallucinate half the API. You'll spend your evening fixing AI mistakes instead of watching your show.</p><p>Or you can use technologies with millions of examples in the training data. AI gets it right the first time.

No. AI understands Python better than any other language.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>AI generates this correctly every time. Try the same in Scala, Go or Rust. Good luck.</p><p>Flask is fine. Django is fine.

Input types, output types, dependency injection—all explicit. No guessing.</p><p>\"Just write raw SQL, it's simpler.\"</p><p>Sure. And AI will generate SQL injection vulnerabilities, wrong column names, and type mismatches. I've seen it. Multiple times. In one afternoon.</p><p>SQLAlchemy gives AI structure:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>AI can't accidentally concatenate user input. The ORM pattern is type-safe by design.</p><p>I naturally chose relational databases—they enforce typing by design.</p><p>PostgreSQL because it's the industry standard: mature, stable, perfect migrations, unbelievable backward compatibility.</p><p>MySQL/MariaDB could work, but I prefer real open source without Oracle's shadow. And I'm still unable to rename a database without voodoo file manipulation—am I the only one shocked by this?</p><p>NoSQL with MongoDB or Neo4j looks cool, but I'll stick with boring PostgreSQL for type enforcement.

Divirta-se! :)</code></p><p>Quando começamos a aprender a programar, uma das primeiras descobertas que nos deparamos é que: as linguagens de programação são todas em inglês! Bom, pelo menos as que são utilizadas no mercado de trabalho.</p><p>Estatisticamente falando, apenas 5% dos brasileiros entendem inglês em algum nível, enquanto apenas 1% possui fluência. Ou seja, nem todos os falantes de língua portuguesa tem conhecimento do idioma inglês.</p><p>O que faz com que a pessoa aprendiz passa encontrar barreiras que a faça dispor mais esforço para desenvolver várias habilidades ao mesmo tempo (programar e aprender outro idioma concomitantemente). Ela terá dificuldades de lidar com recursos e instruções da linguagem de programação, o que poderá comprometer sua aprendizagem de lógica e algoritmos.</p><p>Aí tem-se a importância de existir uma linguagem como o Pituguês, em que a pessoa nativa em português consiga programar em sua língua mãe, eliminando a barreira idiomática.</p><p>Sua sintaxe é inspirada na da linguagem de programação Python que, embora seu nome faça alusão a uma espécie de cobra e seu símbolo seja composto de duas cobras em Ying &amp; Yang, seus criadores eram muito fãs da série de comédia “Monty Python’s Flying Circus” e batizaram a linguagem com o nome de “Python”.</p><p>Pegando carona até mesmo no nome, se formos traduzir “python”, temos “píton”. Assim, para trazer a ideia de uma linguagem de programação inspirada em Python para a língua portuguesa, uniu-se “píton” + “português” que resultou em: Pituguês!</p><p>E, como comentamos, o Pituguês vai se inspirar e buscar trazer características do Python para português, como…</p><p>Quando lidamos com linguagem de programação, devemos lembrar que existem tipos diferentes de dados, como dados textuais, numéricos, binários e etc.</p><p>Algumas linguagens exigem que o tipo de dado seja declarado como, por exemplo, em Java, declaramos uma variável da seguinte maneira…</p><p>Note que, em Java, indicamos o tipo do dado (int, para números inteiro, e String para tipos textuais), escrevemos o nome da variável e, por fim, damos um valor a ela. Se formos comparar com Python, já possui uma diferença acentuada…</p><p>Como podem ver, já não é necessário indicar o tipo da variável, pois a linguagem irá verificar isso automaticamente, é o que chamamos de “inferir tipo”.</p><p>No Pituguês, não vai ser diferente, a nossa declaração de variáveis também vai inferir o tipo...</p><p>A indentação nada mais é que o aninhamento de trechos de código que, no caso do Python, se dá através da tabulação (4 espaçamentos), ela tem o objetivo de determinar quais linhas de código pertencem a um bloco lógico, definindo a estrutura e hierarquia.</p><p>Ou seja, declaramos uma função, por exemplo, em seguida, escrevemos os dois pontos e, logo abaixo deles, com certo espaçamento, começamos a escrever o que a nossa função irá executar. Dessa forma que definimos o escopo e a hierarquia do código, determinando em que momento o trecho de código é iniciado e finalizado.</p><p>Caso a indentação não seja feita da maneira correta, sem o espaçamento ou com espaçamento excessivo, o próprio Python irá nos sinalizar com uma mensagem de erro.</p><p>Na documentação do Pituguês você consegue ter acesso a exemplos de como a indentação funciona:</p><p>Assim como o Python, o Pituguês também é uma linguagem de Código Livre e está aberta a contribuições e, deste a postagem original deste tutorial e introdução a respeito da linguagem, já aconteceram mudanças bastante significativas...</p><p>Há pouco tempo atrás, Pituguês adicionava a palavra  na declaração de variáveis, o que o distanciava de Python. No entanto, contribuições mais recentes da comunidade fizeram que consigamos declarar variáveis da mesma forma que em Python:</p><p><code>linguagem_de_programacao = \"Pituguês\"</code></p><p>Em resumo, Pituguês existe no repositório de uma outra linguagem de programação em português chamada Delégua e acabou herdando algumas características dela, como a interpolação:</p><p><code>var linguagemDeProgramacao = \"Delégua\"</code><code>escreva(\"Linguagem de programação: ${linguagemDeProgramacao}\")</code></p><p>Este tipo de interpolação também se distanciava do Python, mas contribuições recentes trouxeram proximidade entre Pituguês e Python e, agora, a interpolação segue o padrão f-strings:</p><p><code>linguagem_de_programacao = \"Pituguês\"</code><code>imprima(f\"Linguagem de programação: {linguagemDeProgramacao}\")</code></p><p>Lembrando que estamos atualização a <a href=\"https://github.com/DesignLiquido/pitugues-docs/wiki\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">documentação</a> do Pituguês constantemente e, qualquer dúvida que senha sobre a sintaxe, basta consultá-la!</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Mas como programar em Pituguês?\n</h2><p>Para programar em Pituguês, basta que você instale uma extensão no VS Code. Se na aba de extensões você procurar por \"pitugues\", deve encontrar a extensão da Design Líquido que possui todo um ecossistema de linguagens em português como: linguagem de programação, de marcação, de estilo, de consulta e etc.</p><p><a href=\"https://cumbuca.dev/2025/11/07/vem-com-a-gente-programar-em-portugues/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Nesta postagem</a> você pode encontrar um tutorial semelhante a este, mas que demonstra por imagens como instalar a extensão e como executar seus programar em Pituguês!</p><p>O Pituguês é uma iniciativa feita pela comunidade, para a comunidade e toda contribuição conta! 🐍💜\nÉ uma linguagem que está em constante transformação e vocês podem acompanhar junto com a gente todo esse processo!</p><p>Junte-se a nós e ajude a construir o Pituguês — uma linguagem feita com comunidade, propósito e muito coração. 💜</p>","contentLength":5522,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Building a Semantic Search Knowledge Base with MindsDB","url":"https://dev.to/mindsdb/building-a-semantic-search-knowledge-base-with-mindsdb-5107","date":1769617826,"author":"MindsDB Team","guid":425434,"unread":true,"content":"<p><em>Written by Andriy Burkov, Ph.D. &amp; Author, MindsDB Advisor</em></p><p>What happens when a developer searches for \"how to make async HTTP calls\" but your documentation says \"asynchronous network requests\"?

A sudden fog or thunderstorm can lead to missed connections, frustrated users, or skewed data. The key to mitigation? METAR for current airport conditions and TAF for 24–30-hour forecasts.\nIntegrating these via API enables proactive alerts, rerouting, and better decisions. For small businesses, indie developers, students, and researchers, this means operational continuity without high costs. SkyLink API's endpoints provide raw and decoded data for any ICAO airport, with global coverage, 99.99% uptime, and a free tier (1,000 requests/month) starting at $15.99 for production.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Why METAR/TAF Matter More Than General Weather APIs\n</h2><p>Unlike consumer APIs like OpenWeather, METAR/TAF are aviation-specific. METAR details wind, visibility (in statute miles), cloud layers (in feet), temperature, pressure, and phenomena like mist (BR) or fog (FG). TAF forecasts evolutions with TEMPO (temporary), BECMG (becoming), and PROB (probability) indicators.\nThese are tied to ICAO codes, sourced from official observations—not models—ensuring precision for runway impacts. Studies show adverse weather causes ~50% of delays; TAF integration can cut arrival holds by enabling alternates. For travel/hospitality, it minimizes guest waits; for logistics, predicts cargo delays; for research, provides reliable datasets for simulations or papers.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Core Use Cases: How Integration Delivers Results\n</h2><h3>\n  \n  \n  Travel App / Hospitality Guest Experience\n</h3><p>Users often face fog-induced delays. Poll TAF 12–24 hours ahead and METAR near arrival to trigger notifications: \"Low visibility at LHR 18:00–20:00—consider alternate transport.\" Outcomes: 30–50% fewer complaints, higher ratings.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Student/Research Aviation Tools\n</h3><p>Manual data pulls from NOAA slow studies. API calls for multiple ICAOs feed dashboards or sim plugins, enabling faster prototyping and accurate theses on weather patterns.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Small Logistics / Transportation Dashboard\n</h3><p>Unexpected precipitation disrupts ETAs. Combine TAF with flight status to auto-adjust schedules and notify stakeholders, improving on-time performance and reducing costs.\nTechnical Integration Spotlight: SkyLink METAR/TAF Endpoints<p>\nSkyLink's GET /v2/weather/metar/{icao} or /v2/weather/taf/{icao} returns structured JSON: raw text, airport name, timestamp, and decoded fields.

However, it comes with a catch: the first run is very slow. That warmup delay  can be a drag on development iteration and can lead to slower cold starts in production. If you’ve ever swapped a LoRA or made a small model change, you’ve probably noticed that frustrating pause before things get moving again. But what if you could dramatically reduce, or even eliminate, these warmup delays?</p><p>In this post, we'll dive into two practical techniques, powered by Pruna, to mitigate warmup times. We'll show you how to:</p><ol><li><strong>Using Pruna's portable compilation feature, eliminate the initial model warmup</strong> when deploying or reloading a model on a new machine (with identical hardware).</li><li><strong>Achieve zero warmup when switching LoRAs</strong> (Low-Rank Adaptations) on an already optimized model.</li></ol><p>Get ready to reclaim those precious seconds (or even minutes!) and make your  experience smoother than ever.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  The Challenge: Understanding  Warmup\n</h2><p>Before we dive into the solutions, let's briefly touch upon why  has a warmup phase. When you first invoke a model compiled with , several things happen under the hood. PyTorch needs to:</p><ul><li><strong>Capture the computational graph</strong>: It traces the execution of your model to understand its structure.</li><li><strong>Perform graph optimizations</strong>: The captured graph is then optimized for better performance.</li><li><strong>Detect and fuse operators</strong>: The backend (such as Inductor) identifies which operations can be combined for faster execution.</li><li>: Optimized code (often CUDA kernels for GPUs or efficient CPU code) is generated by the chosen backend (like Inductor).</li><li>: This generated code is then compiled into executable machine instructions.</li></ul><p>This entire process, especially the code generation and compilation steps, can take a noticeable amount of time, ranging from seconds to minutes, depending on the model's complexity and the hardware. While this is a one-time cost for a given model shape and hardware (as the compiled artifacts are cached), it can be disruptive:</p><ul><li>: When a new instance of an application starts (e.g., a serverless function or a new pod in Kubernetes), the first request might experience this long warmup, leading to poor user experience.</li><li>: If you compile a model on one machine and then try to run it on another (even with identical hardware), the cache might not be directly usable, leading to another full warmup.</li><li>: Swapping LoRAs or other adapters can alter the model graph triggering recompilation.</li><li>: Waiting for recompilation after minor code changes or restarting a kernel slows the development cycle.</li></ul><p>Pruna offers elegant ways to mitigate these issues, as we'll see next.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Use Case 1: Eliminating Initial Warmup with Pruna's Portable Compilation\n</h2><p>Traditionally, running a compiled model on a new machine triggers a full compilation warmup, even if the hardware is identical. This can slow down processes, especially when deploying models to production or sharing them with others.</p><p>Pruna makes compilation portable. It saves the required artifacts so they can be easily packaged with your model and reused on another machine (with the same hardware architecture and CUDA drivers) without needing to recompile from scratch. That way, the model will run fast right from the first inference.</p><ul><li>: Skip the first-run delay when deploying pre-compiled models to production servers, especially serverless instances.</li><li>: Share ready-to-run models with your team.</li><li>: Speed up CI/CD by avoiding repeated compilation.</li></ul><h3>\n  \n  \n  How-to Use Pruna’s Portable Compilation\n</h3><p>Let's walk through how to use this feature:</p><ol><li><strong>Load your model as normally</strong>: In our example, we use a Stable Diffusion pipeline from Diffusers.</li><li><strong>Configure Pruna for Portable Compilation</strong>: This is where the magic happens. Create a  object and configure   to be portable.</li><li>: Apply the configuration using .</li><li>: Run your model for the first time trigger compilation process, including the warmup. After that, just save your Pruna-smashed model, and it’ll be ready to use on any other machine.\n</li></ol><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><h2>\n  \n  \n  Use case 2: Zero Warmup for LoRA Switching with Diffusers Hotswap and Pruna () Compatibility\n</h2><p>Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) is a game-changer for efficiently fine-tuning large models. It allows for quick adaptation by training only a small set of parameters.</p><p>A powerful workflow involves dynamically switching between different LoRAs on a base model to change its output on the fly—for instance, altering image styles in a generative model. However, a challenge arises when you combine it with compilation. Every LoRA swap can look like a graph change—triggering a long recompilation and wiping out the speed advantage.</p><p>While Diffusers handles the mechanics of LoRA hotswapping, using Pruna with and leveraging one of its cachers ensures that these Diffusers-driven LoRA swaps are efficient and don't cause recompilation warmups after the initial model compilation.</p><p>With Pruna and Diffusers together, you get flexible LoRA adaptation and high-performance execution with no warmup delays.</p><ul><li>: Serve models that adapt to diverse user inputs by loading different LoRAs or applications requiring rapid switching between LoRA-defined styles or functionalities (e.g., in an image generation UI), without the latency of recompilation.</li><li><strong>Efficient experimentation</strong>: Test multiple LoRAs quickly without waiting for recompiles.</li></ul><h3>\n  \n  \n  How-to <strong>Leverage Diffusers Hotswap with Pruna for Zero Warmup</strong></h3><p>Let's walk through how this works:</p><ol><li><strong>Load the Base Model and Enable Diffusers LoRA Hotswapping.</strong></li><li>: Configure  and enable a cacher. In this example, we will be using the  cacher, but others also maintain compatibility.</li><li>: Apply the configuration using .</li><li>: Run the model for the first time triggering the  warmup for the base model and the current LoRA.

Think of it like building a house: you can't install the roof (OOP) until you’ve laid the foundation (Basics).</p><p>Don’t worry this series is designed for beginners. You don’t need to be a senior dev to get started, but having these few tools in your belt will make the transition to OOP feel like a breeze rather than a climb.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Core Python Basics You Should Know\n</h2><p>To get the most out of this OOP series, ensure you're comfortable with the following three pillars:</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  1. Variables and Data Types\n</h3><p>In OOP, we store data inside \"Objects.\" To do that, you must understand how Python handles data. You should be familiar with:</p><ul><li> For names and descriptions.</li><li> For counts, ages, or prices.</li><li> For \"True/False\" logic (essential for state management).</li><li> For storing collections of objects.</li></ul><p> In OOP, these variables will eventually become Attributes the characteristics that define your objects.</p><p>Functions are the \"actions\" of your code. Before moving to OOP, you should know:</p><ul><li>How to define a function ().</li><li>How to pass arguments (positional and keyword).</li><li>How to return values to use elsewhere.</li></ul><p> In the OOP world, <strong>functions living inside a class are called Methods</strong>. If you can write a function, you’re already 80% of the way to writing a class method.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  3. Working with Dictionaries\n</h3><p>You should understand how Key-Value pairs work because:</p><ul><li>Dictionaries represent structured data.</li><li>Internally, Python actually uses dictionaries to store object attributes.</li></ul><p>If you can pull a value from a dictionary using a key, you'll find the logic of accessing object properties very familiar.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  What You Do NOT Need to Know\n</h2><p>It’s easy to feel overwhelmed by the vast Python ecosystem. You do not need to master these before starting this series:</p><ul><li>Advanced Decorators or Generators: We’ll keep things simple.</li><li>Web Frameworks: No Django or FastAPI knowledge is required.</li><li>Database Management: We won’t be touching SQL or NoSQL in the beginning.</li></ul><p>Our focus is strictly on  step by step.</p><p>Before we write our first class, make sure your environment is ready:</p><ol><li>Python Installed: Ensure you have Python 3.x on your machine.</li><li>Terminal Access: You should be comfortable running a script via . </li><li>Code Editor: Use whatever you like (VS Code, PyCharm, or even a simple text editor). No complex setup or heavy IDE configuration is required.\n</li></ol><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><h2>\n  \n  \n  How to Master This Series\n</h2><p>To truly \"level up\" your skills, don't just be a spectator. Engage with the content:</p><ul><li>Follow the Sequence: Concepts build on each other. Don't skip ahead!</li><li>The \"Type-Along\" Rule: Never just read the code. Type it out. Muscle memory is a real thing in programming.</li><li>Break Things: Change a value, delete a colon, or rename a variable. Seeing how the code breaks is the fastest way to learn how to fix it.</li></ul><p>We believe in Hands-on Learning. To support you:</p><ul><li>All code examples are available on our GitHub repository.</li><li>Links to the code are provided in our YouTube series descriptions.</li><li>Clone it, fork it, or copy it just make sure you practice it.</li></ul><p>Object Oriented Programming isn't just a syntax change; it’s a mindset shift. It will help you write cleaner, reusable, and more professional code. Stay consistent, keep practicing, and don't be afraid to ask questions.</p>","contentLength":3327,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Bliki: Excessive Bold","url":"https://martinfowler.com/bliki/ExcessiveBold.html","date":1769610000,"author":"Martin Fowler","guid":425365,"unread":true,"content":"<p>I'm increasingly seeing a lot of technical and business writing make heavy\n  use of bold font weights, in an attempt to emphasize what the writers think is\n  important. LLMs seem to have picked up and spread this practice widely. But\n  most of this is self-defeating, the more a writer uses typographical emphasis,\n  the less power it has, quickly reaching the point where it loses all its\n  benefits.</p><p>There are various typographical tools that are used to emphasize words and\n  phrases, such as: bold, italic, capitals, and underlines. I find that bold is the one\n  that's getting most of the over-use. Using a lot of capitals is rightly\n  reviled as shouting, and when we see it used widely, it raises our doubts on\n  the quality of the underlying thinking.\n  Underlines have become the signal for hyperlinks, so I rarely see this for\n  emphasis any more. Both capitals and underlines have also been seen as rather\n  cheap forms of highlight, since we could do them with typewriters and\n  handwriting, while bold and italics were only possible after the rise of\n  word-processors. (Although I realize most of my readers are too young to\n  remember when word-processors were novel.)</p><p>Italics are the subtler form of emphasis. When I use them in a paragraph,\n  they don't leap out to the eye. This allows me to use them in long flows of text when\n  I want to set it apart, and when I use it to emphasize a phrase it only makes\n  its presence felt when I'm fully reading the text. For this reason, I prefer\n  to use italics for emphasis, but I only use it rarely, suggesting it's\n   important to put stress on\n  the word should I be speaking the paragraph (and I always try to write in the\n  <a href=\"https://martinfowler.com/bliki/SayYourWriting.html\">way that I speak</a>).</p><p>The greatest value of bold is that draws the eye to the bold text even if the\n  reader isn't reading, but glancing over the page. This is an important\n  property, but one that only works if it's used sparingly. Headings are often\n  done in bold, because the it's important to help the reader navigate a longer\n  document by skimming and looking for headings to find the section I want to read.</p><p>I rarely use bold within a prose paragraph, because of my desire to be\n  parsimonious with bold. One use I do like is to highlight unfamiliar words at\n  the point where I explain them. I got this idea from <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0534981283/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0534981283&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=martinfowlerc-20\">Giarratano and Riley</a>. I noticed that when the\n  unfamiliar term reappeared, I was often unsure what it meant, but glancing\n  back and finding the bold quickly reminded me. The trick here is to place the\n  bold at point of explanation, which is often, but not always, at its first\n  use. \n</p><p>A common idea is to take an important sentence and bold that, so it leaps\n  out while skimming the article. That can be worthwhile, but as ever with this\n  kind of emphasize, its effectiveness is inversely proportional to how often\n  it's used. It's also usually not the best tool for the job. Callouts usually\n  work better. They do a superior job of drawing the eye, and furthermore they don't\n  need to use the same words as in the prose text. This allows me to word the\n  callout better than it could be if it also had to fit in the flow of the\n  prose.</p><p>A marginal case is where I see bold used in first clause of each item in a\n  bulleted list. In some ways this is acting like a heading for the text in the\n  list. But we don't need a heading for every paragraph, and the presence of the\n  bullets does enough to draw the eye to the items. And bullet-lists are over\n  used too - I always try to write such things as a prose paragraph instead, as\n  prose flows much better than bullets and is thus more pleasant to read. It's\n  important to write in such a way to make it an enjoyable experience for the\n  reader - even, indeed especially, when I'm also trying to explain things for them.</p><p>While writing this, I was <b>tempted to illustrate my point</b> by using  in a paragraph,  and hopefully demonstrating\n  <b>why lots of bold loses the power to emphasize</b> and .\n  But I also wanted to <b>explain my position clearly</b>, and I felt that <b>illustrating\n  the problem</b> would thus . So I've  to a\n  .

But reaching the  stage still takes consistent practice because you’re learning both the language itself and how to think like a programmer.</p><p>The following timeline shows how long it typically takes to learn Python basics based on how much time you can practice each week:</p><div><table><thead><tr><th>Typical timeline for basics</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr></tr><tr><td>Realistic pace for busy adults</td></tr><tr><td>Consistent focus and fast feedback</td></tr><tr></tr></tbody></table></div><p>These ranges assume about . If you add a sixth day, you’ll likely land toward the faster end of each range.</p><p>You’ll get better results if you use this table as a planning guide. Don’t think of it as rigid deadlines—your learning pace depends on <a href=\"https://realpython.com/how-long-does-it-take-to-learn-python/#what-factors-influence-your-learning-speed\">many factors</a>. For example, if you already know another programming language, then you can usually move faster. If you’re brand-new to coding, then expect to be at the slower end of each range.</p><p>As a general guideline, many beginners reach the basics in about 2 to 6 months with steady practice.</p><div role=\"alert\"><p> If you’re ready to fast-track your learning with an expert-guided small cohort course that gives you live guidance and accountability, then check out <a href=\"https://realpython.com/live/\">Real Python’s live courses</a>!</p></div><p>With a focused schedule of around four hours per day, five days per week, you can often reach this stage in roughly 6 to 10 weeks, assuming you’re writing and debugging code most sessions. By then, you should be able to finish several small projects on your own.</p><p>When you read online that someone learned Python quickly, they’re probably talking about this basics stage. And indeed, with the right mix of dedication, circumstances, and practice, learning Python basics can happen pretty fast!</p><p>Before you go ahead and lock in a timeline, take a moment to clarify for yourself  you want to learn Python. Understanding your motivation for learning Python will help along the way.</p><div><div data-parent=\"#collapse_card811377\"><div><p>Learning Python means  than just learning the Python programming language.

While basic theme properties like primary colors and fonts can be set, customizing specific components often requires additional techniques.</p><p>This post covers two approaches for styling Streamlit apps:</p><ul><li>Targeting components with CSS using the  attribute</li><li>A Python-centric alternative using the  package</li></ul><h2>\n  \n  \n  Styling with CSS and Component Keys\n</h2><p>For components that accept a  attribute, Streamlit assigns a corresponding CSS class ().

The script downloads it automatically if it’s missing.</p><div><pre><code>import urllib.request\nimport zipfile\nimport os\nimport sys\n\ndef resource_path(file_name):\n    base_path = getattr(sys, \"_MEIPASS\", os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__)))\n    return os.path.join(base_path, file_name)\n\ndef download_dataset():\n    url = \"https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/00228/smsspamcollection.zip\"\n    zip_path = resource_path(\"smsspamcollection.zip\")\n\n    urllib.request.urlretrieve(url, zip_path)\n\n    with zipfile.ZipFile(zip_path, 'r') as z:\n        z.extractall(resource_path(\"\"))\n\n    os.remove(zip_path)\n    print(\"[INFO] Dataset downloaded successfully!\")\n</code></pre></div><p>This ensures that even if the dataset is missing, the app will fetch it automatically.</p><p>Step 3: Train the Machine Learning Model</p><p>We’ll use Naive Bayes with TF-IDF vectorization to classify SMS messages.</p><div><pre><code>import pandas as pd\nfrom sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer\nfrom sklearn.naive_bayes import MultinomialNB\nfrom sklearn.pipeline import make_pipeline\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\nfrom sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score\nimport joblib\n\ndef train_sms_model():\n    ds_path = resource_path(\"SMSSpamCollection\")\n\n    if not os.path.exists(ds_path):\n        download_dataset()\n\n    df = pd.read_csv(ds_path, sep=\"\\t\", header=None, names=[\"label\", \"text\"])\n    df[\"label_num\"] = df[\"label\"].map({\"ham\": 0, \"spam\": 1})\n\n    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(df[\"text\"], df[\"label_num\"], test_size=0.2, random_state=42)\n\n    model = make_pipeline(TfidfVectorizer(), MultinomialNB())\n    model.fit(X_train, y_train)\n\n    y_pred = model.predict(X_test)\n    print(f\"[INFO] Model trained — Test Accuracy: {accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)*100:.2f}%\")\n\n    joblib.dump(model, resource_path(\"sms_spam_model.pkl\"))\n    return model\n</code></pre></div><p>Tip: The TF-IDF vectorizer converts text into numbers, and Naive Bayes predicts whether a message is spam.</p><p>We’ll create a helper function to load the model if it already exists, otherwise, it trains a new one.</p><div><pre><code>def load_model():\n    model_path = resource_path(\"sms_spam_model.pkl\")\n    if os.path.exists(model_path):\n        return joblib.load(model_path)\n    return train_sms_model()\n</code></pre></div><p>Step 5: Create a Worker to Process SMS Files</p><p>For batch classification, we’ll build a SpamWorker class that reads CSV/TXT files and labels messages.</p><div><pre><code>import csv\n\nclass SpamWorker:\n    def __init__(self, files, model):\n        self.files = files\n        self.model = model\n\n    def run(self):\n        for path in self.files:\n            with open(path, newline=\"\", encoding=\"utf-8\", errors=\"ignore\") as f:\n                reader = csv.reader(f)\n                texts = [row[0].strip() for row in reader if row]\n\n                labels_num = self.model.predict(texts)\n                labels = [\"SPAM\" if l == 1 else \"HAM\" for l in labels_num]\n\n                for t, lbl in zip(texts, labels):\n                    print(f\"{lbl} | {t}\")\n</code></pre></div><p>This prints each SMS with its predicted label. Later, we’ll connect it to a GUI for a better user experience.</p><p>Step 6: Build a GUI with Tkinter</p><p>We’ll use ttkbootstrap for styling. This allows drag-and-drop support and batch processing.</p><div><pre><code>import ttkbootstrap as tb\nfrom tkinter import filedialog\n\nclass SpamShieldApp:\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.root = tb.Window(themename=\"darkly\")\n        self.root.title(\"SpamShield v3.1\")\n        self.model = load_model()\n        self.files = []\n\n        self.build_ui()\n\n    def build_ui(self):\n        tb.Label(self.root, text=\"📩 SpamShield - AI SMS Detector\", font=(\"Segoe UI\", 22, \"bold\")).pack(pady=10)\n\n        self.path_input = tb.Entry(self.root, width=80)\n        self.path_input.pack(pady=5)\n\n        tb.Button(self.root, text=\"📂 Browse Files\", bootstyle=\"info\", command=self.browse_files).pack(pady=5)\n        tb.Button(self.root, text=\"🚀 Start Classification\", bootstyle=\"success\", command=self.start).pack(pady=5)\n\n    def browse_files(self):\n        self.files = filedialog.askopenfilenames(filetypes=[(\"CSV Files\",\"*.csv\"), (\"Text Files\",\"*.txt\")])\n        self.path_input.delete(0, \"end\")\n        self.path_input.insert(0, f\"{len(self.files)} files selected\")\n\n    def start(self):\n        worker = SpamWorker(self.files, self.model)\n        worker.run()\n\n    def run(self):\n        self.root.mainloop()\n</code></pre></div><p>The GUI lets users select files and classify messages with one click.</p><p>Finally, add the  section to run your app:</p><div><pre><code>if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    app = SpamShieldApp()\n    app.run()\n</code></pre></div><p>Now you have a fully functional SMS spam classifier with AI-powered detection and a modern GUI!</p><p>Downloading datasets programmatically</p><p>Building a machine learning pipeline with TF-IDF + Naive Bayes</p><p>Saving/loading ML models with joblib</p><p>Creating a GUI for batch processing</p><p>Classifying SMS messages as SPAM or HAM</p>","contentLength":5652,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"How to Write Professional SEO-Optimized Blog Content: Complete Research and Writing Guide","url":"https://dev.to/nithinbharathwaj/how-to-write-professional-seo-optimized-blog-content-complete-research-and-writing-guide-2mie","date":1769606091,"author":"Nithin Bharadwaj","guid":425311,"unread":true,"content":"<blockquote><p>As a best-selling author, I invite you to explore my books on <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/stores/Aarav-Joshi/author/B0DQYNVXZ7?ref=ap_rdr&amp;isDramIntegrated=true&amp;shoppingPortalEnabled=true&amp;ccs_id=738636bd-0ca1-4d7b-8efa-481bfc222571\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Amazon</a>.

It sounds complex, but with Python, we can start with simple steps and build up to impressive applications. Over the years, I've used these methods to analyze customer feedback, automate support, and even generate content. Let me show you how you can do the same.</p><p>First, we need to prepare our text. Raw text is messy—full of URLs, odd punctuation, and variations. Think of this like washing vegetables before you cook. We clean it to get consistent results. In Python, libraries like  help with this intelligent cleaning, called preprocessing and tokenization.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>This code turns a sentence into clean, standard parts. The lemma is the base word—\"planning\" becomes \"plan\". This consistency is crucial for the next steps.</p><p>Once text is clean, we can find the important names and places in it. This is called Named Entity Recognition (NER). It's like a highlighter for text, picking out companies, people, and locations automatically. I use this to quickly scan news articles or legal documents for key players.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Running this shows that \"Microsoft\" and \"Google\" are organizations (ORG), while \"Seattle\" and \"California\" are geographic locations (GPE). This automatic tagging saves hours of manual review.</p><p>Now, let's gauge feeling or opinion in text, which is sentiment analysis. Early tools just classified text as positive or negative. Now, we can detect nuance, like frustration or mild satisfaction. I've built systems that track brand sentiment from social media using these techniques.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>This gives a measurable score for emotion. For more advanced needs, pre-trained transformer models from libraries like  can detect sarcasm or mixed feelings, which I often integrate for customer service analysis.</p><p>When you have thousands of documents, you need to find the common themes without reading each one. This is topic modeling. I think of it as a sorting machine that reads all your documents and groups them by hidden topics. LDA is a classic algorithm for this.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>This might output <code>Topic 0: stocks, markets, tech, highs, surge</code> and <code>Topic 1: climate, emission, goals, reduction, conference</code>. It instantly reveals the main themes: finance and environment.</p><p>For tasks like spam detection or categorizing support tickets, we use text classification. We teach a model by showing it many labeled examples. Today, fine-tuning pre-trained transformer models gives remarkable accuracy, even with modest amounts of your own data.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>For production, you'd use the  library by Hugging Face, which handles the complex steps. I've used this to build classifiers that route customer emails to the correct department with over 95% accuracy.</p><p>Creating conversational agents or generating text requires sequence-to-sequence models. These are the engines behind many chatbots. They read an input sequence (like a user's question) and generate an output sequence (the response). I'll show a simplified concept.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Real models, like GPT or DialoGPT, are trained on massive dialogues and generate far more coherent and varied responses. The key is they understand context; they remember what was said earlier in the conversation.</p><p>Long documents need summaries. There are two main ways: extractive and abstractive. Extractive summarization picks the most important existing sentences. It's like highlighting. Abstractive summarization writes new sentences to convey the core meaning, like a human would.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>For abstractive summarization, I often use the  feature from the  library with a model like . It can take a long article and produce a concise, well-written paragraph.</p><p>Finally, we have machine translation. Modern neural translation models understand context much better than old word-for-word systems. They can handle idioms and technical terms. Python makes it straightforward to access state-of-the-art models.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>The real magic is that these models, such as the MarianMT models, have been trained on millions of sentence pairs. They don't just swap words; they rephrase ideas to sound natural in the target language.</p><p>Each of these eight techniques is a tool. You start with preprocessing to clean your data. Then, you might extract entities to find key information. Sentiment analysis tells you how people feel. Topic modeling helps you organize large collections of text. Classification automates sorting. Sequence models enable conversation and generation. Summarization condenses information. Translation breaks down language barriers.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  I often combine them. For instance, I might translate foreign social media posts, analyze their sentiment, extract mentioned company names, and summarize the main topics—all in an automated pipeline. Python's ecosystem, with libraries like , , , and , makes this integration possible. The best approach is to start simple, get one technique working, and then gradually add more complexity as your needs grow.\n</h2><p>📘 , , , and  to the channel!</p><p> is an AI-driven publishing company co-founded by author .

When i started off the week I genuinely thought I already knew everything I needed, but man was I pleasantly surprised at how powerful that testing suite is. Today I'm going to go over a few new things I learned when implementing my tests suite, including:</p><ol><li>Assertion behind the scenes</li></ol><p>One of the first things I noticed when switching from unittest to pytest was how much simpler assertions are. In unittest, you need to use specific methods like , , , etc:</p><div><pre><code># unittest style\nself.assertEqual(result, 5)\nself.assertTrue(is_valid)\nself.assertIn(\"error\", message)\n</code></pre></div><p>With pytest, you just use Python's built-in  statement:</p><div><pre><code># pytest style\nassert result == 5\nassert is_valid\nassert \"error\" in message\n</code></pre></div><p>I was wondering how a 3rd party package could make assertion statements clearer than what's built in to Python, and while digging deeper I found that there's a whole process that goes on when the test fails.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Assert Rewriting with AST\n</h3><p>Pytest uses the built in assert function because it raises an AssertionException when the case does not pass. This built-in assertion check allows Pytest to work with built-in functionality and expand functionality from there.</p><p>For example, once an AssertionException is raised pytest uses assertion rewriting to replace the default string. This is done at import time where pytest can grab the value of each variable and sub expressions. This new info is used to provide the logs with more details like:</p><ol><li>Provides a diff of what was given and what was expected</li><li>The line the test failed at</li><li>What was the failure (mismatch, missing item, etc)</li></ol><p>By doing this at import time, it's able to place all code in an Abstract Syntax Tree (yes, the same AST we're working with in this project), finds all the  statements, and rewrites them to capture intermediate values before the assertion runs. This is why when an assertion fails, pytest can show you exactly what each part of the expression evaluated to:</p><div><pre><code>def test_string_comparison():\n    result = \"hello world\"\n    assert result == \"hello pytest\"\n</code></pre></div><div><pre><code>=========================== FAILURES ===========================\n_________________ test_string_comparison _______________________\n\n    def test_string_comparison():\n        result = \"hello world\"\n&gt;       assert result == \"hello pytest\"\nE       AssertionError: assert 'hello world' == 'hello pytest'\nE         \nE         - hello pytest\nE         + hello world\n\n======================== 1 failed in 0.02s =====================\n</code></pre></div><p>This works for complex expressions too:</p><div><pre><code>def test_list_membership():\n    items = [\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\"]\n    target = \"grape\"\n    assert target in items\n</code></pre></div><div><pre><code>E       AssertionError: assert 'grape' in ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']\n</code></pre></div><p>Pytest captured both the value of  and  before the assertion ran, so it can show you exactly why it failed.</p><p>Coming from Node, one thing I appreciated about jest is being able to use , , , and  in combination with  scopes to setup and tear down test data in a straightforward manner. I was relieved to see that pytest gives us these features with the ability of fixtures that allow us to specify the same level of setup, teardown, and scope that's in jest.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Why Fixtures over beforeEach\n</h3><p>While I was relieved to see familiar patterns, I quickly realized that fixtures are actually more powerful than Jest's approach in a few key ways:</p><ul><li> - Fixtures can depend on other fixtures. We injected pytest's built-in tmp_path fixture into our own custom fixture - that's composition in action. In Jest, you'd have to nest your beforeEach blocks or manually call setup functions to achieve something similar.</li><li> - Fixtures let you specify how often they run: function (default, runs for each test), class, module, or session. If I have an expensive setup like connecting to a database, I can scope it to session and it only runs once for the entire suite.</li><li><strong>Reusability via conftest.py</strong> - Any fixture defined in a conftest.py file is automatically available to all tests in that directory and subdirectories. No imports needed.</li><li> - This one was subtle but important. With Jest's beforeEach, the setup runs before every test in that scope whether you need it or not. With pytest, fixtures only run when a test actually requests them as a parameter. If I have 10 tests in a class but only 3 need the sample_code_file fixture, it only gets created 3 times. This keeps tests fast and avoids unnecessary setup.</li></ul><p>Part of testing the ASTAnalyzer was making sure that we had a file with data to parse throughout out tests. Initially I created a sample file in a tests/data document and tested against that, but then found that we can create one using a combination of our own fixture and one of pytest's built in fixtures:</p><div><pre><code>@pytest.fixture\ndef sample_code_file(tmp_path):\n    \"\"\"Factory fixture to create temporary Python files with specified content.\"\"\"\n\n    def _create_file(content, filename=\"test_file.py\"):\n        file_path = tmp_path / filename\n        file_path.write_text(content)\n        return str(file_path)\n\n    return _create_file\n\ndef test_enter_opens_file(self, sample_code_file):\n    \"\"\"__enter__ opens the file and returns file object.\"\"\"\n    filepath = sample_code_file(\"x = 1\")\n    with Parser(filepath) as f:\n        assert f is not None\n        assert not f.closed\n\ndef test_context_manager_with_exception(self, sample_code_file):\n    \"\"\"File is closed even when exception occurs.\"\"\"\n    filepath = sample_code_file(\"content\")\n    file_ref = None\n    with pytest.raises(ValueError):\n        with Parser(filepath) as f:\n            file_ref = f\n            raise ValueError(\"test error\")\n    assert file_ref.closed\n</code></pre></div><p>As we can see, we've created a  that takes in the content that we want to test against and automatically writes it to a file. This allows us to have a piece of reusable code that can be used to test all types of content inside of the file</p><p>One of the harder things I found while setting up my initial tests was making sure that my printing and logging decorators were being tested. Initially I was using  to mimic this behavior like so:</p><div><pre><code>@logger(logging.DEBUG)\ndef add(a, b):\n    return a + b\n\n\ndef test_ast_log_defaults():\n    with patch(\"ast_analyzer.decorators.logger.logger\") as mock_logger:\n        add(3, 5)\n\n    mock_logger.debug.assert_called()\n    call_args = str(mock_logger.debug.call_args)\n    assert \"add\" in call_args\n</code></pre></div><p>The test technically works, it checks that mock logger was called in the  function, but it doesn't actually check what the contents of that log are. With pytest we can use  to grab the output and save it to a file that we can then read from:</p><div><pre><code>@logger(logging.DEBUG)\ndef add(a, b):\n    return a + b\n\ndef test_ast_log_defaults(caplog):\n    with caplog.at_level(logging.DEBUG):\n        add(3, 5)\n\n    assert \"DEBUG\" in caplog.text\n    assert \"add\" in caplog.text\n</code></pre></div><p>With this new functionality, we can look for specific strings of text inside of the log. We also have control over the logging level that we display, so we can write tests for DEBUG and INFO to check that the text in both of those logs are appearing properly. This can also be done with capsys for checking print statements:</p><div><pre><code>def test_prints_timing_output(capsys):\n    \"\"\"Decorator should print timing information to stdout.\"\"\"\n\n    factorial(3)\n    captured = capsys.readouterr()\n    assert \"factorial\" in captured.out\n    assert \"-&gt;\" in captured.out\n</code></pre></div><p>In both formats we can see the ease of use that pytest gives us for accessing this text</p><p>Last but not least, there's parametrization. Parametrization is a technique that's used in python to make code more modular and reusable. In our specific case, we use parametrization for testing by iterating through multiple parameters. This is a great way to reduce the amount of code in your test suite without losing any functionality. To demo this, I'll show a before and after of a series of tests made in the repo.</p><p>When we create our custom , one thing we do on initialization is see how many children the Node has. In order to test that our  declaration for children is working, we set up the following tests:</p><div><pre><code>def test_str_shows_children_count_one_child(self):\n    \"\"\"__str__ displays the number of children.\"\"\"\n    tree = ast.parse(\"x = 1\")\n    node = ASTNode(tree)\n    assert str(node) == f\"AST Node | Children: 1\"\n\ndef test_str_shows_children_count_mult_children(self):\n    \"\"\"__str__ displays the number of children.\"\"\"\n    tree = ast.parse(\"x = 1\\ny = 2\\nz = 3\")\n    node = ASTNode(tree)\n    assert str(node) == f\"AST Node | Children: 3\"\n\n---\n\n================ test session starts ================\nplatform darwin -- Python 3.12.12, pytest-9.0.2, pluggy-1.6.0\nrootdir: /Users/davidmoran/Sites/ai-bootcamp/projects/AST-Analyzer\nconfigfile: pyproject.toml\nplugins: cov-7.0.0\ncollected 2 items                                   \n\ntests/test_astnode.py ..

When playing around with this I thought of combining this into a collection and testing that way:</p><div><pre><code>def test_str_shows_children_count(self):\n    \"\"\"__str__ displays the number of children.\"\"\"\n    tree = ast.parse(\"x = 1\")\n    node = ASTNode(tree)\n    assert str(node) == \"AST Node | Children: 1\"\n\n    tree = ast.parse(\"x = 1\\ny = 2\\nz = 3\")\n    node = ASTNode(tree)\n    assert str(node) == \"AST Node | Children: 3\"\n\n---\n\n================ test session starts =================\nplatform darwin -- Python 3.12.12, pytest-9.0.2, pluggy-1.6.0\nrootdir: /Users/davidmoran/Sites/ai-bootcamp/projects/AST-Analyzer\nconfigfile: pyproject.toml\nplugins: cov-7.0.0\ncollected 1 item                                     \n\ntests/test_astnode.py .

In the future if one of these were to fail (in a larger test) it would be a bit annoying trying to figure out which one of these was the culprit</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Introducing: Parametrization\n</h3><p>Parametrization solves the above by creating a matrix of key values to test against and running them against 1 test.

For our test, we just wanted to make sure that an ASTNode was created successfully based on the input, so it's a perfect candidate for parametrization. If I wanted to check the outputs or error handling of certain inputs, that is better handled as a separate test so that we can check on a number of items (type of exception if raised, state of ASTNode, log statements, etc).</p>","contentLength":12221,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Making Date-Based Content Reusable","url":"https://dev.to/cobel1024/making-date-based-content-reusable-5126","date":1769604930,"author":"Dora","guid":425306,"unread":true,"content":"<p>Content with specific dates can't be reused.</p><p>Example: An exam with these dates:</p><ul><li>Grading due: Jan 18, 2024</li><li>Appeal deadline: Jan 20, 2024</li><li>Confirmation due: Jan 22, 2024</li></ul><p>Want to reuse this exam in July?

People argue about it for hours, write thread after thread, and treat it as the answer to every quality problem. This is a dramatic shift from 2024 or even early 2025, when the term was barely known. Now everyone knows evaluation matters. Everyone wants to “.“</p><p>But now they’re lost. There’s so much noise coming from all directions, with everyone using the term for completely different things. Some (might we say, most) people think “evals” means prompting AI models to judge other AI models, building a dashboard of them that will magically solve their quality problems. They don’t understand that what they actually need is a process, one that’s far more nuanced and comprehensive than spinning up a few automated graders.</p><p>We’ve started to really hate the term. It’s bringing more confusion than clarity. Evals are only important in the context of product quality, and product quality is a process. It’s the ongoing discipline of deciding what “good” means for your product, measuring it in the right ways at the right times, learning where it breaks in the real world, and repeatedly closing the loop with fixes that stick.</p><p>We recently talked about this on <a href=\"https://youtu.be/z7T1pCxgvlA?si=wpFGuurnmdNpNUOc&amp;t=2001\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"></a>, and so many people reached out saying they related to the confusion, that they’d been struggling with the same questions. That’s why we’re writing this post.</p><p>Here’s what this article is going to do: explain the entire system you need to build for AI product quality, without using the word “evals.” (We’ll try our best. :p)</p><p>The status quo for shipping any reliable product requires ensuring three things:</p><ul><li>: A way to estimate how it behaves while you’re still developing it, before any customer sees it</li><li>: Signals for how it’s actually performing once real customers are using it</li><li>: A reliable feedback loop that lets you find problems, fix them, and get better over time</li></ul><p>This article is about how to ensure these three things in the context of AI products: why AI is different from traditional software, and what you need to build instead.</p><h2><strong>Why Traditional Testing Breaks</strong></h2><p>In traditional software, testing handles all three things we just described.</p><p>Think about booking a hotel on Booking.com. You select your dates from a calendar. You pick a city from a dropdown. You filter by price range, star rating, and amenities. At every step, you’re clicking on predefined options. The system knows exactly what inputs to expect, and the engineers can anticipate almost every path you might take. If you click the ”search” button with valid dates and a valid city, the system returns hotels. The behavior is predictable.</p><p>This predictability means testing covers everything:</p><ul><li> You write unit tests and integration tests before launch to verify behavior.</li><li> You monitor production for errors and exceptions. When something breaks, you get a stack trace that tells you exactly what went wrong.</li><li> It’s almost automatic. You write a new test, fix the bug, and ship. When you fix something, it stays fixed. Find issue, fix issue, move on.</li></ul><p>Now imagine the same task, but through a chat interface: ”I need a pet-friendly hotel in Austin for next weekend, under $200, close to downtown but not too noisy.”</p><p>The problem becomes much more complex. And the traditional testing approach falls apart.</p><p>The way users interact with the system can’t be anticipated upfront. There’s no dropdown constraining what they type. They can phrase their request however they want, include context you didn’t expect, or ask for things your system was never designed to handle. You can’t write test cases for inputs you can’t predict.</p><p>And because there’s an AI model at the center of this, the outputs are nondeterministic. The model is probabilistic. You can’t assert that a specific input will always produce a specific output. There’s no single ”correct answer” to check against.</p><p>On top of that, the process itself is a black box. With traditional software, you can trace exactly why an output was produced. You wrote the code; you know the logic. With an LLM, you can’t. You feed in a prompt, something happens inside the model, and you get a response. If it’s wrong, you don’t get a stack trace. You get a confident-sounding answer that might be subtly or completely incorrect.</p><p>This is the core challenge: AI products have a much larger surface area of user input that you can’t predict upfront, processed by a nondeterministic system that can produce outputs you never anticipated, through a process you can’t fully inspect</p><p>The traditional feedback loop breaks down. You can’t estimate behavior during development because you can’t anticipate all the inputs. You can’t easily catch issues in production because there’s no clear error signal, just a response that might be wrong. And you can’t reliably improve because the thing you fix might not stay fixed when the input changes slightly.</p><p>Whatever you tested before launch was based on behavior you anticipated. And that anticipated behavior can’t be guaranteed once real users arrive.</p><p>This is why we need a different approach to determining quality for AI products. The testing paradigm that works for clicking through Booking.com doesn’t transfer to chatting with an AI. You need something different.</p><p>So we’ve established that AI products are fundamentally harder to test than traditional software. The inputs are unpredictable, the outputs are nondeterministic, and the process is opaque. This is why we need dedicated approaches to measuring quality.</p><p>But there’s another layer of complexity that causes confusion: the distinction between assessing the model and assessing the product.</p><p>Foundation AI models are judged for quality by the companies that build them. OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google all run their models through extensive testing before release. They measure how well the model performs on coding tasks, reasoning problems, factual questions, and dozens of other capabilities. They give the model a set of inputs, check whether it produces expected outputs or takes expected actions, and use that to assess quality.</p><p>This is where benchmarks come from. You’ve probably seen them: LMArena, MMLU scores, HumanEval results. Model providers publish these numbers to show how their model stacks up. “We’re #1 on this benchmark” is a common marketing claim.</p><p>These scores represent real testing. The model was given specific tasks and its performance was measured. But here’s the thing: These scores have limited use for people building products. Model companies are racing toward capability parity. The gaps between top models are shrinking. What you actually need to know is whether the model will work for your specific product and produce good quality responses in your context.</p><p>There are two distinct layers here:</p><p>. This is the foundation model itself: GPT, Claude, Gemini, or whatever you’re building on. It has general capabilities that have been tested by its creators. It can reason, write code, answer questions, follow instructions. The benchmarks measure these general capabilities.</p><p>. This is your application, the thing you’re actually shipping to users. A customer support bot. A booking assistant. Your product is built on top of a foundation model, but it’s not the same thing. It has specific requirements, specific users, and specific definitions of success. It integrates with your tools, operates under your constraints, and handles use cases the benchmark creators never anticipated. Your product lives in a custom ecosystem that no model provider could possibly simulate.</p><p>Benchmark scores tell you what a model can do in general. They don’t tell you whether it works for your product.</p><p>The model layer has already been assessed by someone else. Your job is to assess the product layer: against your specific requirements, your specific users, your specific definition of success.</p><p>We bring this up because so many people obsess over model performance benchmarks. They spend weeks comparing leaderboards, trying to find the “best” model, and end up in “model selection hell.” The truth is, you need to pick something reasonable and build your own quality assessment framework. You cannot heavily rely on provider benchmarks to tell you what works for your product.</p><p>So you need to assess your product’s quality. Against what, exactly?</p><p>Three things work together:</p><p>: Real inputs paired with known-good outputs. If a user asks, “What’s your return policy?“ what should the system say? You need concrete examples of questions and acceptable answers. These become your ground truth, the standard you’re measuring against.</p><p>Start with 10–50 high-quality examples that cover your most important scenarios. A small set of carefully chosen examples beats a large set of sloppy ones. You can expand later as you learn what actually matters in practice.</p><p>This is really just product intuition. You’re thinking: What does my product support? How would users interact with it? What user personas exist? How should my ideal product behave? You’re designing the experience and gathering a reference for what “good“ looks like.</p><p>: Once you have reference examples, you need to think about how to measure quality. What dimensions matter? This is also product intuition. These dimensions are your metrics. Usually, if you’ve built out your reference example dataset very well, they should give you an overview of what metrics to look into based on the behavior that you want to see. Metrics essentially are dimensions that you want to focus on to assess quality. An example of a dimension could be, say, helpfulness.</p><p>: What does “good“ actually mean for each metric? This is a step that often gets skipped. It’s common to say “we’re measuring helpfulness“ without defining what helpful means in context. Here’s the thing: Helpfulness for a customer support bot is different from helpfulness for a legal assistant. A helpful support bot should be concise, solve the problem quickly, and escalate at the right time. A helpful legal assistant should be thorough and explain all the nuances. A rubric makes this explicit. It’s the instructions that your metric hinges on. You need this documented so everyone knows what they’re actually measuring. Sometimes if metrics are more objective in nature—for instance, “Was a correct JSON retrieved?“ or “Was a particular tool called done correctly?”—you don’t need rubrics at all. Subjective metrics are the ones that you generally need rubrics for, so keep that in mind.</p><p>For example, a customer support bot might define helpfulness like this:</p><ul><li>: Resolves the issue completely in one response, uses clear language, offers next steps if relevant</li><li>: Answers the question but requires follow-up or includes unnecessary information</li><li>: Misunderstands the question, gives irrelevant information, or fails to address the core issue</li></ul><p>To summarize, you have expected behavior from the user, expected behavior from the system (your reference examples), metrics (the dimensions you’re assessing), and rubrics (how you define those metrics). A metric like “helpfulness“ is just a word and means nothing unless it’s grounded by the rubric. All of this gets documented, which helps you start judging offline quality before you ever go into production.</p><p>You’ve defined what you’re measuring against. Now, how do you actually measure it?</p><p>There are three approaches, and all of them have their place.</p><p>: Deterministic rules that can be verified programmatically. Did the response include a required disclaimer? Is it under the word limit? Did it return valid JSON? Did it refuse to answer when it should have? These checks are simple, fast, cheap, and reliable. They won’t catch everything, but they catch the straightforward stuff. You should always start here.</p><p>: Using one model to grade another. You provide a rubric and ask the model to score responses. This scales better than human review and can assess subjective qualities like tone or helpfulness.</p><p>But there’s a risk. An LLM judge that hasn’t been calibrated against human judgment can lead you astray. It might consistently rate things wrong. It might have blind spots that match the blind spots of the model you’re grading. If your judge doesn’t agree with humans on what “good“ looks like, you’re optimizing for the wrong thing. Calibration against human judgment is super critical.</p><p>: The gold standard. Humans assess quality directly, either through expert review or user feedback. It’s slow and expensive and doesn’t scale. But it’s necessary. You need human judgment to calibrate your LLM judges, to catch things automated checks miss, and to make final calls on high-stakes decisions.</p><p>The right approach: Start with code-based checks for everything you can automate. Add LLM judges carefully, with extensive calibration. Reserve human review for where it matters most.</p><p>One important note: When you’re first building your reference examples, have humans do the grading. Don’t jump straight to LLM judges. LLM judges are notorious for being miscalibrated, and you need a human baseline to calibrate against. Get humans to judge first, understand what “good“ looks like from their perspective, and then use that to calibrate your automated judges. Calibrating LLM judges is a whole other blog post. We won’t dig into it here. But this is a nice <a href=\"https://arize.com/docs/phoenix/cookbook/prompt-engineering/llm-as-a-judge-prompt-optimization\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">guide</a> from Arize to help you get started.</p><h2><strong>Production Surprises You (and Humbles You)</strong></h2><p>Let’s say you’re building a customer support bot. You’ve built your reference dataset with 50 (or 100 or 200—whatever that number is, this still applies) example conversations. You’ve defined metrics for helpfulness, accuracy, and appropriate escalation. You’ve set up code checks for response length and required disclaimers, calibrated an LLM judge against human ratings, and run human review on the tricky cases. Your offline quality looks solid. You ship. Then real users show up. Here are just some examples of emerging behaviors you might see. The real world is a lot more nuanced.</p><ul><li><strong>Your reference examples don’t cover what users actually ask.</strong> You anticipated questions about return policies, shipping times, and order status. But users ask about things you didn’t include: “Can I return this if my dog chewed on the box?“ or “My package says delivered but I never got it, and also I’m moving next week.“ They combine multiple issues in one message. They reference previous conversations. They phrase things in ways your reference examples never captured.</li><li><strong>Users find scenarios you missed.</strong> Maybe your bot handles refund requests well but struggles when users ask about partial refunds on bundled items. Maybe it works fine in English but breaks when users mix in Spanish. No matter how thorough your prelaunch testing, real users will find gaps.</li><li><strong>User behavior shifts over time.</strong> The questions you get in month one don’t look like the questions you get in month six. Users learn what the bot can and can’t do. They develop workarounds. They find new use cases. Your reference examples were a snapshot of expected behavior, but expected behavior changes.</li></ul><p>And then there’s scale. If you’re handling 5,000 conversations a day with a 95% success rate, that’s still 250 failures every day. You can’t manually review everything.</p><p>This is the gap between offline and online quality. Your offline assessment gave you confidence to ship. It told you the system worked on the examples you anticipated. But online quality is about what happens with real users, real scale, and real unpredictability. The work of figuring out what’s actually breaking and fixing it starts the moment real users arrive.</p><p>This is where you realize a few things (a.k.a. lessons):</p><p><strong>Lesson 1: Production will surprise you regardless of your best efforts.</strong> You can build metrics and measure them before deployment, but it’s almost impossible to think of all cases. You’re bound to be surprised in production.</p><p><strong>Lesson 2: Your metrics might need updates. They’re not “once done and throw.“ You might need to update rubrics or add entirely new metrics.</strong> Since your predeployment metrics might not capture all kinds of issues, you need to rely on online implicit and explicit signals too: Did the user show frustration? Did they drop off the call? Did they leave a thumbs down? These signals help you sample bad experiences so you can make fixes. And if needed, you can implement new metrics to track how a dimension is doing. Maybe you didn’t have a metric for handling out-of-scope requests. Maybe escalation accuracy should be a new metric.</p><p>Over time, you also realize that some metrics become less useful because user behavior has changed. This is where the flywheel becomes important.</p><p>This is the part most people miss and pay least attention to but you should be paying the  attention to. Measuring quality isn’t a phase you complete before launch. It’s not a gate you pass through once. It’s an engine that runs continuously, for the entire life of your product.</p><p> You can’t review everything, so you sample intelligently. Flag conversations that look unusual: long exchanges, repeated questions, user frustration signals, low confidence scores. These are the interactions worth examining.</p><p><strong>Discover new failure modes.</strong> When you review flagged interactions, you find problems your prelaunch testing missed. Maybe users are asking about a topic you didn’t anticipate. Maybe the system handles a certain phrasing poorly. These are new failure modes, gaps in your understanding of what can go wrong.</p><p><strong>Update your metrics and reference data.</strong> Every new failure mode becomes a new thing to measure. You can either fix the issue and move on, or if you have a sense that the issue needs to be monitored for future interactions, add a new metric or a set of rubrics to an existing metric. Add examples to your reference dataset. Your quality system gets smarter because production taught you what to look for.</p><p><strong>Ship improvements and repeat.</strong> Fix the issues, push the changes, and start monitoring again. The cycle continues.</p><p>This is the flywheel: Production informs quality measurement, quality measurement guides improvement, improvement changes production, and production reveals new gaps. It keeps running.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. (Until your product reaches a convergence point. How often you need to run it depends on your online signals: Are users satisfied, or are there anomalies?)</p><p><strong>And your metrics have a lifecycle.</strong></p><p>Not all metrics serve the same purpose:</p><p> (borrowing the term from <a href=\"https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/demystifying-evals-for-ai-agents\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Anthropic’s blog</a>) measure things you’re actively trying to improve. They should start at a low pass rate (maybe 40%, maybe 60%). These are the hills you’re climbing. If a capability metric is already at 95%, it’s not telling you where to focus.</p><p> (again borrowing the term from <a href=\"https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/demystifying-evals-for-ai-agents\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Anthropic’s blog</a>) protect what you’ve already achieved. These should be near 100%. If a regression metric drops, something broke. You need to investigate immediately. As you improve on capability metrics, the things you’ve mastered become regression metrics.</p><p> have stopped giving you signal. They’re always green. They’re no longer informing decisions. When a metric saturates, run it less frequently or retire it entirely. It’s noise, not signal.</p><p>Metrics should be born when you discover new failure modes, evolve as you improve, and eventually be retired when they’ve served their purpose. <strong>A static set of metrics that never changes is a sign that your quality system has stagnated.</strong></p><p>As promised, we made it through without using the word “evals.“ Hopefully this gives a glimpse into the lifecycle: assessing quality before deployment, deploying with the right level of confidence, connecting production signals to metrics, and building a flywheel.</p><p>Now, the issue with the word “evals“ is that people use it for all sorts of things:</p><ul><li>“We should build evals“ → Usually means “we should write LLM judges“ (useless if not calibrated and not part of the flywheel).</li><li>“Evals are dead; A/B testing is key“ → This is part of the flywheel. Some companies overindex on online signals and fix issues without many offline metrics. Might or might not make sense based on product.</li><li>“How are GPT-5.2 evals looking?“ → These are model benchmarks, often not useful for product builders.</li><li>“How many evals do you have?“ → Might refer to data samples, metrics… We don’t know what.</li></ul><p>Here’s the deal: Everything we walked through (distinguishing model from product, building reference examples and rubrics, measuring with code and LLM judges and humans, monitoring production, running the continuous improvement flywheel, managing the lifecycle of your metrics) is what “evals“ should mean. But we don’t think one term should carry so much weight. We don’t want to use the term anymore. We want to point to different parts in the flywheel and have a fruitful conversation instead.</p><p>And that’s why <strong>evals are not all you need</strong>. It’s a larger data science and monitoring problem. Think of quality assessment as an ongoing discipline, not a checklist item.</p><p>We could have titled this article “Evals Are All You Need.“ But depending on your definition, that might not get you to read this article, because you think you already know what evals are. And it might be just a piece. If you’ve read this far, you understand why.</p><p> Build the flywheel, not the checkbox. Not the dashboard. Whatever you need to build that actionable flywheel of improvement.</p>","contentLength":21594,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2026/01/Wheel-of-colorful-arrows.jpg","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Machine Learning Basics Every Data Analyst Should Know","url":"https://dev.to/adnan_arif_14ae4bc014267f/machine-learning-basics-every-data-analyst-should-know-3j87","date":1769601623,"author":"Adnan Arif","guid":425277,"unread":true,"content":"<p>Data analysts and data scientists aren't the same role. But the line between them keeps blurring.</p><p>Increasingly, employers expect data analysts to understand machine learning fundamentals. Not to build production AI systems—that's still data science territory—but to know when ML applies, how it works conceptually, and how to collaborate with ML teams.</p><p>This isn't about becoming a data scientist. It's about being a more effective analyst in a world where machine learning is everywhere.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  What Machine Learning Actually Is\n</h2><p>Strip away the hype and machine learning is pattern recognition at scale.</p><p>Traditional programming: you write rules. If purchase &gt; $1000 and first_order = True, flag for review.</p><p>Machine learning: you provide examples. Here are 10,000 transactions, some fraudulent, some legitimate. The algorithm finds patterns that distinguish them.</p><p>The key insight: ML discovers rules from data instead of you specifying them. This works when patterns exist but are too complex for humans to articulate.</p><p>Machine learning isn't always the answer. Often simpler approaches work better.</p><ul><li>Patterns too complex for explicit rules (image recognition, natural language)</li><li>Problems where you have lots of labeled examples</li><li>Situations where small accuracy improvements justify significant investment</li><li>Tasks with stable patterns that won't shift rapidly</li></ul><ul><li>Insufficient data (less than hundreds or thousands of examples)</li><li>Problems solvable with simple rules or SQL</li><li>Situations requiring full explainability for compliance</li><li>Rapidly changing patterns that need frequent retraining</li></ul><p>A common mistake: reaching for ML when a GROUP BY and a threshold would suffice.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  The Three Types of Learning\n</h2><p>Machine learning approaches fall into three categories.</p><p> You have labeled examples—inputs paired with known outputs. Predict house prices from features. Classify emails as spam or not. The algorithm learns the relationship between inputs and outputs.</p><p> No labels, just data. Find natural groupings in customers. Detect anomalies in transactions. Reduce dimensionality for visualization. The algorithm discovers structure without being told what to look for.</p><p> An agent learns through trial and error, receiving rewards or penalties. Less relevant for most analysts—used mainly in robotics, games, and recommendation systems.</p><p>As an analyst, you'll encounter supervised and unsupervised learning most often.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Supervised Learning: Classification vs Regression\n</h2><p>Supervised learning solves two types of problems.</p><p> The output is a category. Will this customer churn? Is this transaction fraudulent? Which product category does this belong to?</p><p> The output is a continuous number. What price will this house sell for? How many units will we sell next quarter?</p><p>The distinction matters because different algorithms and evaluation metrics apply to each.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Common Algorithms You'll Encounter\n</h2><p>You don't need to implement these from scratch. But recognizing them helps.</p><p><strong>Linear/Logistic Regression.</strong> Simple, interpretable baselines. Linear regression predicts continuous values; logistic regression predicts probabilities for classification.</p><p> Split data based on feature thresholds. Easy to understand and visualize. Prone to overfitting.</p><p> Many decision trees voting together. More accurate than single trees, less interpretable.</p><p><strong>Gradient Boosting (XGBoost, LightGBM).</strong> Build trees sequentially, each correcting previous errors. Currently dominates tabular data competitions.</p><p> Find optimal boundaries between classes. Works well in high dimensions.</p><p> Layers of connected nodes learning complex patterns. Essential for images, text, and unstructured data.</p><p>For tabular data—what analysts typically work with—tree-based methods often perform best.</p><p>Understanding how models learn helps you spot problems.</p><p> Typically 70-80% for training, the rest for testing. Never evaluate on training data—it's like grading your own homework.</p><p> The algorithm adjusts internal parameters to minimize prediction errors on training data.</p><p> Test on held-out data. Adjust hyperparameters. Repeat.</p><p> Final performance check on data the model has never seen.</p><p>The fundamental challenge: generalization. A model that memorizes training data fails on new examples. Good models learn patterns that transfer.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Overfitting: The Central Challenge\n</h2><p>Overfitting happens when a model learns training data too well—including noise and quirks that don't generalize.</p><ul><li>Excellent training performance, poor test performance</li><li>Model complexity exceeds what the data supports</li><li>Dramatic performance drops on new data</li></ul><ul><li>Regularization (penalizing complexity)</li></ul><p>An overfit model looks good in development and fails in production. This is why proper evaluation matters.</p><p>Different metrics measure different aspects of model performance.</p><ul><li>MAE (Mean Absolute Error): Average prediction error in original units</li><li>RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error): Penalizes large errors more heavily</li><li>R² (R-squared): Proportion of variance explained</li></ul><ul><li>Accuracy: Percentage of correct predictions (misleading with imbalanced classes)</li><li>Precision: Of positive predictions, how many were correct?</li><li>Recall: Of actual positives, how many were found?</li><li>F1 Score: Harmonic mean of precision and recall</li><li>AUC-ROC: Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve</li></ul><p>Choose metrics that align with business objectives. Accuracy on a 99% negative dataset can be 99% just by predicting everything as negative.</p><p>For classification, the confusion matrix is essential.</p><div><table><thead><tr></tr></thead><tbody><tr></tr><tr></tr></tbody></table></div><p>From this, you can calculate any classification metric.</p><p>False positives and false negatives have different costs. A spam filter that misses spam is annoying. A fraud detector that blocks legitimate transactions costs revenue. Optimize for what matters.</p><p>Features—the input variables—often matter more than algorithm choice.</p><p> Knowing that \"days since last purchase\" predicts churn better than raw timestamps makes a difference.</p><ul><li>Log transforms for skewed distributions</li><li>Binning continuous variables</li><li>One-hot encoding for categorical variables</li><li>Interaction features (combining variables)</li><li>Time-based features (day of week, month, etc.)</li></ul><p>Data analysts often excel at feature engineering because they understand the data and business context. This is where your skills directly improve ML.</p><p>Many real problems have imbalanced classes. Fraud is rare. Churn happens to a minority. Disease is uncommon.</p><p>Standard algorithms struggle—they learn to predict the majority class.</p><ul><li>Undersample the majority class</li><li>Oversample the minority class (SMOTE)</li><li>Adjust class weights during training</li><li>Use appropriate metrics (not accuracy)</li></ul><p>Imbalance is the norm in business problems. Expect to handle it.</p><p>A single train-test split might be lucky or unlucky. Cross-validation provides more robust estimates.</p><ol><li>Split data into K equal parts</li><li>Train on K-1 parts, validate on the remaining part</li><li>Repeat K times, rotating which part is held out</li></ol><p>This gives a more reliable estimate of model performance and helps detect overfitting.</p><p>Black box predictions often aren't enough. Stakeholders ask why the model made a decision.</p><p> Linear regression, decision trees, and logistic regression have transparent logic.</p><p><strong>Interpretation techniques for complex models:</strong></p><ul><li>Feature importance (which variables matter most)</li><li>SHAP values (how each feature affects each prediction)</li><li>Partial dependence plots (how one feature affects predictions)</li><li>LIME (local explanations for individual predictions)</li></ul><p>When interpretability matters—for compliance, debugging, or stakeholder buy-in—consider it from the start.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Working with Data Scientists\n</h2><p>As an analyst, you might not build production ML systems. But you'll likely collaborate with those who do.</p><ul><li>Domain knowledge about the data and business</li><li>Feature ideas based on your experience</li><li>Data cleaning and preparation</li><li>Evaluation from a business perspective</li></ul><ul><li>Algorithm selection and tuning</li></ul><p>Effective collaboration requires shared language. Understanding ML basics lets you participate meaningfully in discussions.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Getting Started Practically\n</h2><p>Want to build intuition? Start here.</p><p> Python's go-to ML library. Clean API, great documentation, covers the basics.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p> Competitions and datasets for practice. Start with beginner-friendly competitions like Titanic survival prediction.</p><p> \"Hands-On Machine Learning\" by Géron is accessible and practical.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  What You Don't Need (Yet)\n</h2><p>Focus before breadth. These can wait:</p><ul><li>Deep learning and neural network architectures</li><li>Advanced optimization techniques</li><li>Cutting-edge research papers</li></ul><p>Master the fundamentals first. Advanced topics build on solid foundations.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Frequently Asked Questions\n</h2><p><strong>Do I need to code to understand machine learning?</strong>\nBasic Python helps significantly. You can understand concepts without code, but hands-on practice builds intuition faster.</p><p><strong>What's the difference between AI, machine learning, and deep learning?</strong>\nAI is the broadest term (systems that seem intelligent). ML is a subset (learning from data). Deep learning is a subset of ML (neural networks with many layers).</p><p>\nConceptual understanding of linear algebra, calculus, and statistics helps but isn't essential for practical use. Libraries handle the math.</p><p><strong>Should data analysts learn ML?</strong>\nIncreasingly yes. You don't need to become a data scientist, but understanding when and how ML applies makes you more valuable.</p><p><strong>What's the easiest algorithm to start with?</strong>\nLinear/logistic regression. Simple, interpretable, and the foundation for understanding more complex methods.</p><p><strong>How do I know if ML will help my problem?</strong>\nAsk: Do I have enough labeled examples? Is the pattern learnable? Is the improvement worth the complexity? Often, simpler approaches suffice.</p><p><strong>What tools should I learn?</strong>\nStart with scikit-learn for classical ML. Add pandas for data prep, matplotlib/seaborn for visualization.</p><p><strong>How long does it take to learn ML basics?</strong>\nA few weeks of focused study for conceptual understanding. Months to years for practical proficiency.</p><p><strong>Is AutoML replacing the need to understand ML?</strong>\nAutoML automates algorithm selection and tuning but doesn't replace understanding. You still need to frame problems, prepare data, and interpret results.</p><p><strong>What's the biggest mistake beginners make?</strong>\nJumping to complex algorithms before understanding the data. Exploratory analysis and feature engineering usually matter more than algorithm choice.</p><p>Machine learning isn't magic. It's pattern recognition powered by data and computation.</p><p>As a data analyst, you don't need to become an ML expert. But understanding the basics—when it applies, how it works, and how to evaluate it—makes you more effective in a world where ML is increasingly ubiquitous.</p><p>Start with the fundamentals. Build intuition through practice. The advanced topics will make more sense once you have a solid foundation.</p><p><em>This article was refined with the help of AI tools to improve clarity and readability.</em></p>","contentLength":10730,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Modeling Urban Walking Risk Using Spatial-Temporal Machine Learning","url":"https://towardsdatascience.com/modeling-urban-walking-risk-using-spatial-temporal-machine-learning/","date":1769601600,"author":"Aneesh Patil","guid":425272,"unread":true,"content":"<p>Estimating neighborhood-level pedestrian risk from real-world incident data</p>","contentLength":75,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"🔥 Trending Now: Today's Top Updates & Viral Links - 2026-01-28","url":"https://dev.to/tarun_walia_ad82c14a97e0c/trending-now-todays-top-updates-viral-links-2026-01-28-5804","date":1769600721,"author":"tarun walia","guid":425276,"unread":true,"content":"<p>Here is the list of latest trending updates fetched on 2026-01-28.

Whether you're setting up a <a href=\"https://www.glukhov.org/post/2025/11/linux-for-data-science-jupyter-pandas-tools/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">data science environment with Jupyter and Pandas</a>, building production applications, or managing machine learning projects, the decision between Anaconda, Miniconda, and Mamba affects everything from installation speed and disk space usage to dependency resolution performance and environment reproducibility. Understanding their differences, strengths, and ideal use cases will help you make an informed choice that aligns with your specific needs and workflow requirements.</p><p>The Python ecosystem offers multiple package management solutions, each optimized for different use cases. While traditional tools like <a href=\"https://www.glukhov.org/post/2025/05/python-venv-cheatsheet/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">venv</a> and newer alternatives like <a href=\"https://www.glukhov.org/post/2025/06/uv-new-python-package-project-and-environment-manager/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">uv</a> have their place, conda-based solutions excel at managing complex scientific computing dependencies that include both Python packages and system libraries. This unique capability makes them indispensable for data science, machine learning, and scientific computing workflows where <a href=\"https://dasroot.net/posts/2026/01/future-package-management-uv-rye-next-gen-tools/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">packages</a> often require compiled binaries, system libraries, and non-Python dependencies.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Understanding the Conda Ecosystem\n</h2><p>The conda ecosystem consists of three main components: the package manager (conda), different distributions (Anaconda, Miniconda), and alternative implementations (Mamba). Each serves distinct purposes in the <a href=\"https://glukhov.au/posts/2026/python-coding/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Python data science and development</a> workflow.</p><p> is both a package manager and an environment manager that handles Python packages along with their binary dependencies, system libraries, and even non-Python software. This makes it particularly valuable for scientific computing where packages like NumPy, SciPy, and machine learning frameworks have complex native dependencies.</p><p> is the full-featured distribution that includes conda plus hundreds of pre-installed packages. It's designed for users who want everything ready out of the box, including popular data science libraries, Jupyter Notebook, and the Anaconda Navigator GUI.</p><p> provides just the essentials: conda, Python, and a minimal set of dependencies. It's the lightweight alternative that lets you build custom environments from scratch, installing only what you need.</p><p> represents the evolution of conda's dependency resolution engine. Originally a standalone tool, its core technology (libmamba) has been integrated into modern conda versions, offering significantly faster dependency resolution and environment creation.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Anaconda: The Complete Solution\n</h2><p>Anaconda is the heavyweight champion of Python distributions, weighing in at approximately  with over <strong>600 pre-installed packages</strong>. This comprehensive installation includes everything from core data science libraries to development tools and visualization packages.</p><p>Anaconda shines in scenarios where convenience and completeness matter more than disk space or installation speed. It's ideal for:</p><ul><li> entering data science who want immediate access to tools without learning package installation</li><li> where consistency across student machines is important</li><li> when you need to experiment with various libraries without setup overhead</li><li> users who prefer Anaconda Navigator over command-line interfaces</li><li> requiring commercial support and compliance features</li></ul><p>The pre-installed packages include essential data science tools like Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, Jupyter Notebook, and many others. This means you can start analyzing data or building machine learning models immediately after installation.</p><div><pre><code>\nwget https://repo.anaconda.com/archive/Anaconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh\n\n\nbash Anaconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh\n\n ~/.bashrc\n</code></pre></div><p>The installation process is straightforward, and Anaconda Navigator provides a graphical interface for managing environments, packages, and launching applications like Jupyter Notebook or Spyder IDE.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Miniconda: The Minimalist Approach\n</h2><p>Miniconda takes the opposite philosophy: start minimal and add only what you need. At approximately , it includes just conda, Python, and essential dependencies—about  total.</p><p>Miniconda is the preferred choice for:</p><ul><li> where smaller footprint and faster installation matter</li><li> where image size directly impacts deployment speed</li><li> who know exactly which packages they need</li><li> where minimal environments reduce build times</li><li> on systems with limited storage</li><li><strong>Security-conscious environments</strong> where fewer packages mean smaller attack surface</li></ul><p>The minimalist approach gives you complete control over your environment. You explicitly install each package, which leads to more reproducible environments and better understanding of dependencies. This aligns well with modern <a href=\"https://www.glukhov.org/post/2025/11/python-design-patterns-for-clean-architecture/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Python design patterns for clean architecture</a> where explicit dependencies are preferred.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Miniconda Installation and Setup\n</h3><div><pre><code>\nwget https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh\n\n\nbash Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh\n\n ~/.bashrc\n\n\nconda create  myproject 3.11\nconda activate myproject\n\n\nconda pandas numpy matplotlib jupyter\n</code></pre></div><p>This workflow requires more steps but results in leaner, more maintainable environments. Each package is intentionally added, making it easier to track dependencies and reproduce environments across different systems.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Mamba: The Performance Revolution\n</h2><p>Mamba represents a significant leap forward in dependency resolution performance. Originally developed as a standalone conda alternative, its core technology has been integrated into conda itself, but standalone Mamba tools remain valuable for specific use cases.</p><p>Mamba's libsolv-based solver delivers <strong>50-80% faster dependency resolution</strong> compared to conda's legacy solver. In practical terms, this means:</p><ul><li>: 3 seconds vs 17 seconds for conda (in benchmark tests)</li><li><strong>Complex dependency resolution</strong>: Handles conflicts that would cause conda to fail</li><li>: Comparable download times but faster resolution phase</li><li>: More informative feedback when resolution fails</li></ul><p>The performance gains are most noticeable when working with large environments or complex dependency trees common in machine learning and data science projects.</p><p>As of  (November 2023), libmamba became conda's default solver. This means modern conda installations automatically benefit from Mamba's performance improvements without requiring separate Mamba installation.</p><p>However, standalone  and  tools still offer value:</p><ul><li>: Single-binary, no installation required, perfect for containers</li><li>: Full-featured alternative with additional commands like </li><li>: Mamba tools often start faster than conda</li></ul><div><pre><code>\nconda mamba  base  conda-forge\n\n\nmamba create  myenv 3.11 pandas numpy\nmamba activate myenv\nmamba scikit-learn\n\n\ncurl  https://micro.mamba.pm/api/micromamba/linux-64/latest |  bin/micromamba\n./bin/micromamba create  myenv 3.11\n</code></pre></div><p>The command syntax is nearly identical to conda, making migration seamless. You can literally replace \"conda\" with \"mamba\" in most workflows.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  For Data Science Beginners\n</h3><p> if you're just starting with data science. The pre-installed packages and GUI tools (Anaconda Navigator) provide a smooth learning curve. You can focus on learning Python and data analysis rather than package management.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  For Production Development\n</h3><p> for production environments. The smaller footprint, explicit dependencies, and faster installation make it ideal for Docker containers, CI/CD pipelines, and server deployments. This approach aligns with best practices for <a href=\"https://www.glukhov.org/post/2025/10/unit-testing-in-python/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">unit testing in Python</a> where reproducible environments are critical. When you're ready to package your Python applications for distribution, tools like <a href=\"https://www.glukhov.org/post/2025/01/pyinstaller/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">PyInstaller</a> can help create standalone executables from your conda-managed environments.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  For Performance-Critical Workflows\n</h3><p><strong>Use modern conda (23.10.0+)</strong> which includes libmamba, or  if you need additional features. The faster dependency resolution significantly improves workflow efficiency, especially when frequently creating or modifying environments.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  For Containerized Applications\n</h3><p> for Docker containers. It's a single binary with no installation step, making it perfect for minimal container images. This is particularly useful when building containers for <a href=\"https://www.glukhov.org/post/2025/09/llm-structured-output-with-ollama-in-python-and-go/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">LLM applications with structured output</a> where fast startup and small image size matter.</p><p>Regardless of which tool you choose, follow these best practices.\nFor a comprehensive reference of conda commands, see our <a href=\"https://www.glukhov.org/post/2024/10/conda-cheatsheet/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Conda Cheatsheet</a>:</p><div><pre><code>\nconda create  myproject 3.11\n\n\nconda  environment.yml\nconda create  environment.yml\n\n\nconda config  auto_activate_base \nconda config  channels conda-forge\nconda config  channel_priority strict\n</code></pre></div><p>While you can use pip within conda environments, follow this order:</p><ol><li>Install conda packages first (they handle binary dependencies better)</li><li>Use pip only for packages unavailable in conda</li><li>Avoid mixing conda and pip for the same package</li></ol><p>This prevents dependency conflicts and ensures binary compatibility.</p><ul><li>Use  channel (more packages, better maintained)</li><li>Enable  in modern conda (default in 23.10.0+)</li><li>Consider  for CI/CD pipelines</li><li>Cache packages locally for offline installations</li></ul><p> is worth mentioning as a conda-forge based distribution that comes with Mamba pre-installed. It's open-source focused, uses only conda-forge channel by default, and provides the best of both worlds: minimal installation with fast dependency resolution.</p><p>Miniforge is ideal if you:</p><ul><li>Prefer open-source packages exclusively</li><li>Want Mamba included from the start</li><li>Need a middle ground between Anaconda and Miniconda</li></ul><p>The choice between Anaconda, Miniconda, and Mamba depends on your specific needs:</p><ul><li>: Best for beginners and quick starts with comprehensive pre-installed tools</li><li>: Ideal for production, containers, and custom environments</li><li>: Essential for performance-critical workflows with complex dependencies</li></ul><p>Modern conda (23.10.0+) includes Mamba's performance improvements by default, so you get the best of both worlds. For most users, <strong>Miniconda with modern conda</strong> provides the optimal balance of flexibility, performance, and control.</p><p>Remember that these tools complement rather than replace each other. You might use Anaconda for initial exploration, Miniconda for production, and Mamba for environments requiring frequent updates. The key is understanding when each tool provides the most value for your specific workflow.</p>","contentLength":10493,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"🔥 Trending Now: Today's Top Updates & Viral Links - 2026-01-28","url":"https://dev.to/tarun_walia_ad82c14a97e0c/trending-now-todays-top-updates-viral-links-2026-01-28-5f0f","date":1769597065,"author":"tarun walia","guid":425239,"unread":true,"content":"<p>Here is the list of latest trending updates fetched on 2026-01-28.

He’s also a popular Maven instructor and former healthtech product manager.</p><h2><strong>How Is This Different From Plugins?</strong></h2><p>If you’ve been following OpenAI for a while, you might think, “Wait, didn’t they already try this with Plugins?”</p><p>ChatGPT Plugins (launched March 2023, deprecated April 2024) were essentially API wrappers. You’d describe your API endpoints, and ChatGPT would call them and return text. The problem was that everything came back as text that ChatGPT had to interpret and re-present to the user. There was no native UI, no interactivity, and no way to create rich experiences.</p><p>They allow users to upload content and shape their conversations, but are difficult to share broadly and don’t give brands control over how they’ll appear in chats.</p><p>ChatGPT Apps take a fundamentally different approach.</p><p>Instead of just calling APIs and returning text, Apps can render full interactive widgets directly in the conversation. You can show a map, display a booking form, or let users interact with a spreadsheet.</p><p>Here’s how the three approaches compare:</p><p>The key insight is that Apps aren’t just “GPTs with UI”; they’re a different architecture entirely.</p><p>The widget runs in a sandboxed iframe with its own state, its own event handling, and direct communication with your backend. ChatGPT orchestrates when to show your app, but once it’s rendered, users interact with your UI directly.</p><blockquote><p>Here’s the simplest way to think about it: a chatbot talks, but an app does.</p></blockquote><p>Ask ChatGPT to book a restaurant, and normally, it explains how. It lists options, gives links, and tells you what to search for. Helpful, but nothing actually changes in the world.</p><p>Now ask ChatGPT with a restaurant app installed, and something different happens.</p><p>An interactive widget appears right in the chat. You can see real availability, browse the menu, pick a time, and confirm your reservation. When you’re done, you have an actual booking, not just information about how to make one.</p><p>Here’s exactly what that would look like:</p><p>The launch partners tell you a lot about where OpenAI sees this going: Booking.com, Canva, Coursera, Expedia, Figma, Spotify, and Zillow.</p><blockquote><p>Users install apps through: <strong>Settings &gt; Apps &amp; Connectors</strong>.</p></blockquote><p>Once installed, ChatGPT can automatically surface your app based on conversation context, or users can tag it manually.</p><p>Before we get into the technical details, it’s worth thinking about what kinds of apps work well in this model.</p><p>ChatGPT apps should be quick and conversational. The goal is not to export your entire web app to ChatGPT. OpenAI says that apps should <a href=\"https://developers.openai.com/blog/what-makes-a-great-chatgpt-app\">show, do, or know</a> something that ChatGPT doesn’t. For example, ChatGPT can’t deliver groceries to your house, but the Instacart app with ChatGPT can.</p><p>Now let’s look at how this all works under the hood.</p><p>Every ChatGPT App is built from three parts that work together:</p><p>The first is the, which is your backend. It tells ChatGPT what your app can do by defining “tools” (functions the model can call) and “resources” (UI templates to render).</p><p>MCP stands for Model Context Protocol, an open standard that Anthropic created and OpenAI has now adopted.</p><p>The second component is the, which is your frontend. It’s HTML that runs on ChatGPT in a sandboxed iframe.</p><p>The third is , which acts as the host. It decides when to call your tools, renders your widgets, and manages the conversation state.</p><p>Let’s look at each component in detail:</p><p>The MCP Server is your backend—it’s where you define what your app can actually do.</p><blockquote><p>It exposes two main things to ChatGPT: tools and resources.</p></blockquote><p> are actions that ChatGPT can call.</p><p>Each tool has a name (like ), a description that helps ChatGPT decide when to use it, an input schema defining which parameters are required, and an output template specifying which UI resource to render the results in.</p><p> are UI templates that ChatGPT renders when tools return data.</p><p>They’re served as HTML bundles (typically React apps compiled to a single file) and rendered inside a sandboxed iframe.</p><p>Here’s what a tool definition might look like for our restaurant finder:</p><pre><code>Tool: search_restaurants\n\nDescription: “Find restaurants by location and cuisine type”\n\nInputs: location (required), cuisine (optional), price_range (optional)\n\nOutput: → ui://widget/restaurant-list.html</code></pre><p>The description is especially important.</p><p>ChatGPT uses it to decide whether your tool is relevant to the user’s request. If your description is vague—like “do restaurant stuff”—ChatGPT won’t know when to invoke it. Be specific about what the tool does and when it should be used.</p><p>Let’s trace what happens when you tell ChatGPT, “Find me Italian restaurants in Brooklyn”.</p><p>Understanding this flow is key to building apps that work well.</p><p>First, ChatGPT checks the available tools from all installed apps.</p><p>It sees your  tool with the description “Search for restaurants by location and cuisine type”. Based on the user’s message, it decides this tool is relevant.</p><p>Next, ChatGPT constructs a tool call:</p><pre><code>{\n\n  “name”: “search_restaurants”,\n\n  “parameters”: {\n\n    “location”: “Brooklyn”,\n    “cuisine”: “Italian”\n\n  }\n\n}</code></pre><p>Your MCP server receives this request, validates the parameters, queries your database (or an external API such as Yelp), and returns the results.</p><p>This includes a reference to your UI template if you have one.</p><pre><code>return {\n\n  content: [\n\n    { type: “text”, text: “Found 12 Italian restaurants in Brooklyn” }\n\n  ],\n\n  structuredContent: {\n\n    restaurants: results\n\n  },\n\n  _meta: {\n\n    “openai/outputTemplate”: “ui://widget/restaurant-list.html”\n\n  }\n\n};</code></pre><ul><li><p>The  field is for ChatGPT. It’s a text summary, so the model knows what happened and can respond intelligently.</p></li><li><p>The  field is for your widget, containing the raw data your UI will display.</p></li><li><p>And the  in  tells ChatGPT to fetch and render your widget HTML.</p></li></ul><p>Finally, ChatGPT fetches your HTML bundle, renders it in a sandboxed iframe, and injects your  via a JavaScript bridge. The user sees an interactive list of restaurants right in their chat.</p><p>The Widget is your frontend widget.</p><p>When your widget loads, ChatGPT injects an  object that gives you access to data and methods for interacting with the system.</p><p>Here’s what you can do with :</p><ul><li><p> — The data returned from your tool call</p></li><li><p> — The parameters that were passed to your tool</p></li><li><p> — Any persisted UI state</p></li><li><p> — Whether the user is in light or dark mode</p></li><li><p> — The user’s locale (e.g., “en-US”)</p></li></ul><ul><li><p> — Call another MCP tool directly</p></li><li><p> — Persist UI state</p></li><li><p> — Send a message back to ChatGPT</p></li><li><p> — Switch between inline, full screen, or picture-in-picture</p></li><li><p> — Open an external URL</p></li></ul><p>This is what makes Apps fundamentally different from Plugins.</p><p>Your widget can trigger new tool calls, save state, and continue the conversation. Users interact directly with your UI, not through ChatGPT’s text interface. When they click on a restaurant to see more details, you have two options for handling that interaction.</p><p>The first option is a .</p><p>Your widget can call tools directly using , which bypasses the model entirely. Your widget requests restaurant details, your server returns the data, and the widget updates immediately. This is fast and efficient for straightforward data fetching.</p><p>The second option is a .</p><p>Your widget can send a follow-up <code>window.openai.sendFollowUpMessage()</code>, which puts the model back in the loop. ChatGPT sees the message, decides what to do next, and might call additional tools or ask clarifying questions.</p><pre><code>// Direct tool call (model not involved)\n\nconst details = await window.openai.callTool(\n\n  ‘get_restaurant_details’,\n  { id: restaurant.id }\n\n);\n\n\n// Follow-up message (model decides next step)\n\nawait window.openai.sendFollowUpMessage({\n\n  prompt: `I want to book ${restaurant.name} for 4 people`\n\n});</code></pre><p>This creates a continuous loop that makes the whole experience feel seamless:</p><blockquote><p>The user speaks, ChatGPT calls a tool, the widget renders, the user interacts with the widget, the widget either calls another tool or sends a message, and the cycle continues.</p></blockquote><p>Widgets can appear in three different formats depending on what makes sense for your app.</p><p> widgets embed directly in the conversation flow. This is the default for all apps, and it works well for things like listings, search results, or quick selections.</p><p> mode takes over the entire viewport. This is better for maps, dashboards, or complex workflows where users need more space to work.</p><p> mode floats the widget while the user continues chatting. This is great for music players, timers, or other persistent tools that the user might want to keep visible while doing other things.</p><pre><code>window.openai.requestDisplayMode({ mode: “fullscreen” });\n\nwindow.openai.requestDisplayMode({ mode: “pip” });</code></pre><p>One constraint to keep in mind: <strong>you can only show one widget per message.</strong></p><p>If someone asks ChatGPT to “book a restaurant and order an Uber,” it will show one app at a time. Users work through these requests sequentially.</p><p>Now that we understand how the pieces fit together, let’s talk about security.</p><p>With four parties involved (ChatGPT, your MCP server, your widget, and external APIs), it’s important to understand where the trust boundaries lie.</p><p>ChatGPT calls your MCP server over HTTPS. Your server should validate that requests are actually coming from ChatGPT. ChatGPT trusts your server to return valid tool responses and UI resources.</p><p>The widget runs in a heavily sandboxed iframe. ChatGPT injects the  bridge, but the widget cannot access ChatGPT’s DOM, cookies, or any data from other apps. This is the strictest boundary.</p><p>Your widget can only make network requests to domains you’ve explicitly declared in your Content Security Policy () configuration. All other requests are blocked.</p><p>Each app’s widget runs in its own isolated sandbox. Apps cannot access each other’s data, state, or DOM. Even if a malicious app tried to extract data from another app, the browser’s same-origin policy prevents it.</p><p>Your widget runs under strict restrictions. It cannot:</p><ul><li><p>Access cookies (it’s on a sandbox origin, not your domain)</p></li><li><p>Use localStorage or sessionStorage</p></li><li><p>Access the parent DOM (ChatGPT’s interface)</p></li><li><p>Submit forms directly (use  instead)</p></li><li><p>Open popups (use  instead)</p></li><li><p>Make network requests except for declared CSP domains</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>Execute JavaScript normally</p></li><li><p>Fetch from CSP-allowed domains</p></li><li><p>Communicate through the  bridge</p></li><li><p>Store UI state via </p></li></ul><p>You declare your allowed connections in your tool’s :</p><pre><code>_meta: {\n\n  “openai/widgetCSP”: {\n\n    “connect_domains”: [”api.yourservice.com”],\n    “resource_domains”: [”cdn.yourservice.com”],\n    “frame_domains”: []  // Nested iframes trigger stricter review\n\n  }\n\n}</code></pre><blockquote><p>The key principle: external API calls should go through your MCP server, not the widget.</p></blockquote><p>Let your widget handle the UI and let your server handle the business logic and sensitive operations.</p><p>With the security model in mind, let’s look at how authentication works:</p><p>There are two separate concerns: authenticating that requests to your MCP server are coming from ChatGPT, and authenticating users to your service.</p><p>For authenticating users to your service (so they can access their own data), ChatGPT acts as an OAuth 2.1 client while your MCP server acts as the resource server.</p><p>PKCE and Dynamic Client Registration are requiredChatGPT registers with your identity provider at runtime, generating a unique  for each connection.</p><p>Discovery endpoints are also required.</p><p>Your MCP server needs to expose <code>/.well-known/oauth-protected-resource</code> (RFC 9728), and your IdP needs to expose either <code>/.well-known/oauth-authorization-server</code> (RFC 8414) or <code>/.well-known/openid-configuration</code>.</p><p>One important security detail: your widget never sees tokens directly.</p><p>All authentication flows go through the ChatGPT host, which keeps credentials out of the browser sandbox. Your MCP server validates tokens on every incoming request: fetch JWKS signing keys, verify the signature and issuer, check expiry and audience claims, and validate scopes.</p><p>If validation fails, return a 401 with a  header.</p><p>User sessions are scoped to the conversation.</p><p>If a user authenticates with your app in one conversation, they’ll need to re-authenticate in a new conversation. This is by design as it prevents credentials from leaking across contexts and gives users clear control over when they’re authenticated.</p><p>State in ChatGPT Apps exists in three tiers, each with different owners, lifetimes, and purposes. Understanding which tier to use for what is important for building apps that feel reliable.</p><p> is stored using  and is scoped to a specific message and widget pair. Use it for UI preferences, such as which tab is selected or how results are sorted.</p><p>One important detail: this state is visible to the model, so keep it under 4k tokens and never store sensitive data here.</p><pre><code>// Good: minimal UI state for preferences\n\nawait window.openai.setWidgetState({\n\n  selectedTab: “reviews”,\n  sortOrder: “rating”\n\n});\n\n\n// Bad: don’t store sensitive or large data here\n\nawait window.openai.setWidgetState({\n\n  userEmail: “...”,      // Never store credentials\n  allResults: [...]      // Too large\n\n});</code></pre><p> is maintained by ChatGPT.</p><p>The model remembers what’s happened in the conversation and uses that context when deciding what to do next. You don’t control this directly, but you influence it through the content field in your tool responses.</p><p> is anything you persist in your own database.</p><p>This is the only state that survives across conversations, devices, and time. If something matters long term, like a user’s saved preferences, booking history, or account data, store it in your backend.</p><p>If the user refreshes the page, the widget state persists (it’s stored by ChatGPT, not in browser storage). If the user switches devices mid-conversation, widget state is lost, but the conversation context remains.</p><p>If the user starts a new conversation, everything resets except the backend state.</p><p>Once you’ve built your app, you need to actually run it.</p><p>This section covers everything from error handling to deployment:</p><p>Things will go wrong. Networks fail, APIs time out, servers crash.</p><p>The good news is that errors cascade through the system in predictable ways, and ChatGPT has built-in fallbacks for most failure modes.</p><p>If your MCP server is unreachable,ChatGPT falls back to text and continues the conversation without your app.</p><p>The user might see something like “I wasn’t able to connect to the restaurant app, but I can help you find Italian restaurants in Brooklyn another way. Similarly, if your tool returns an error, ChatGPT explains what went wrong in natural language. Return clear error messages in your content field so ChatGPT can communicate the issue to users.</p><p>If an external API fails while your tool is running, try to return partial results or a useful error state rather than failing completely.</p><p>If you found 8 restaurants but couldn’t get ratings for 3 of them, return the 8 restaurants with partial data. Users generally prefer some information over none.</p><p>One important detail: ChatGPT may automatically retry failed tool calls, so make sure your handlers are . If a user clicks “book this restaurant” and the network hiccups, you don’t want to create two bookings when the retry succeeds.</p><p>If you’re concerned about overwhelming requests, there are <strong>three layers of rate limiting</strong> to think about:</p><p>First is ChatGPT’s loop detection, which prevents runaway tool calls.</p><p>If your app gets stuck calling the same tool repeatedly, ChatGPT will eventually stop. But this is a backstop, not a strategy. This means your server needs its own rate limiting. Implement per-user limits on tool calls and track costs for external API usage. If your app calls the Google Maps API on every tool invocation, and a user asks a vague question that triggers dozens of calls, you’ll see that in your bill.</p><p>You should also validate inputs and set limits on expensive operations.</p><p>Consider what happens if someone asks ChatGPT to “find every restaurant in New York.” That’s potentially millions of results. Your tool should have sensible defaults (e.g., return 20 results, not 20,000) and reject queries that would be prohibitively expensive.</p><p>A good pattern is to return early with a clarifying question: “I found over 10,000 Italian restaurants in New York. Can you narrow down the search to a specific neighborhood?”</p><p>Finally, we have privacy. Building apps that handle user data comes with responsibilities, and OpenAI’s guidelines are specific about what you can and cannot do.</p><p>First, you should collect only the minimum data needed to perform your tool’s function.</p><p>Your input schema should be narrowly scoped and clearly linked to the task (no “just in case” fields or broad profile data). The same applies to responses: return only what’s directly relevant to the user’s request. Don’t include diagnostic info, telemetry, session IDs, or logging metadata unless strictly necessary.</p><p>Some data types are off-limits entirely.You cannot collect, solicit, or process:</p><ul><li><p>Payment card information (PCI DSS data)</p></li><li><p>Protected health information (PHI)</p></li><li><p>Government identifiers (social security numbers, etc.)</p></li><li><p>Access credentials (API keys, passwords, MFA codes)</p></li></ul><p>For sensitive data categories (as defined by local regulations), you can only collect if it’s strictly necessary, the user has given adequate consent, and you’ve clearly disclosed the collection.</p><p>Any tool that posts messages, sends emails, uploads files, or otherwise moves data outside the current boundary must be marked as a write action. This surfaces it to ChatGPT so users can confirm before execution. Misrepresenting a write action as read-only is a common rejection reason.</p><p>If you’re building an app that might have users in regions with strong privacy regulations, you’re responsible for compliance.</p><p>Your OAuth consent screen should clearly explain what data your app accesses. Users should be able to request copies of their data and request deletion. Remember that ChatGPT Apps involve data flowing through multiple parties (user → ChatGPT → your MCP server → external APIs), so your privacy policy should explain this chain clearly.</p><p>Ready to build something?</p><p>There are a couple of good paths depending on how much control you want:</p><p> (<a href=\"https://chippy.build\">chippy.build</a>) is an AI agent trained on the Apps SDK (and built by me!). It can create MCP servers and widgets for you, includes built-in testing, and lets you connect to ChatGPT without dealing with deployment setup. This is probably the fastest way to get something running.</p><p> gives you more control. Import the official examples from https://github.com/openai/openai-apps-sdk-examples, then configure: bundle your React widgets with Vite (set  to your Replit domain), serve  with CORS on port 80, run your MCP server on port 8000 bound to , and allow all hosts.</p><p>Of course, you can also clone the official examples locally, set up an ngrok tunnel to your MCP endpoint, and connect directly.</p><p>In any case, you’ll need to enable Developer Mode in ChatGPT settings to connect. Once enabled, go to Settings &gt; Apps &amp; Connectors &gt; New App, enter your MCP URL, and test by mentioning your app by name in a new conversation.</p><p>Here’s the mental model of how everything fits together:</p><p>Your MCP server defines what your app can do through tools and resources. Your widget handles how it looks and how users interact with it. ChatGPT orchestrates the whole thing—deciding when to invoke your tools and rendering your widgets in the conversation.</p><p>The communication loop is what makes it feel seamless: user speaks → ChatGPT calls tool → widget renders → user interacts → cycle continues.</p><p>Security is enforced through sandboxing. Your widget can’t access cookies, storage, or arbitrary network requests. Everything flows through declared CSP domains or the  bridge.</p><p>State exists at three levels: widget state is per-message, conversation context is per-session, and backend state is persistent in your database.</p><p>Errors cascade predictably. ChatGPT falls back to text and explains what went wrong in natural language.</p><p>With 800 million weekly active users and the app directory just launched, this is the moment to start building.

This loads five drivers for five formats by importing their plugins: BMP, GIF,\nJPEG, PPM and PNG.</p><p>During import, each plugin\n<a href=\"https://github.com/python-pillow/Pillow/blob/12.1.0/src/PIL/GifImagePlugin.py#L1204-L1211\">registers</a>\nits file extensions, MIME types and some methods used for opening and saving.</p><p>Then we check each of these plugins in turn to see if one will accept the image. Most of\nPillow’s plugins detect an image by opening the file and checking if the first few bytes\nmatch a magic prefix. For example:</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://github.com/python-pillow/Pillow/blob/12.1.0/src/PIL/GifImagePlugin.py#L73-L74\">GIF</a>\nstarts with  or .</li><li><a href=\"https://github.com/python-pillow/Pillow/blob/12.1.0/src/PIL/JpegImagePlugin.py#L334-L336\">JPEG</a>\nstarts with , where  means “Start of Image”, and  is\nthe start of the next marker\n(<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JPEG#Syntax_and_structure\">reference</a>).</li></ul><p>If none of these five match, we call\n<a href=\"https://github.com/python-pillow/Pillow/blob/12.1.0/src/PIL/Image.py#L372-L396\"></a>,\nwhich imports the remaining 42 plugins. We then check each of these for a match.</p><p>This has been the case since at least\n<a href=\"https://github.com/hugovk/pil-svn.effbot.org/blame/master/PIL/Image.py#L290\">PIL 1.1.1</a>\nreleased in 2000 (this is the oldest version I have to check). There were 33 builtin\nplugins then and 47 now.</p><p>This is all a bit wasteful if we only need one or two image formats during a program’s\nlifetime, especially for things like CLIs. Longer running programs may need a few more,\nbut unlikely all 47.</p><p>A benefit of the plugin system is third parties can\n<a href=\"https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/handbook/third-party-plugins.html\">create their own plugins</a>,\nbut we can be more efficient with our builtins.</p><p>I opened a <a href=\"https://github.com/python-pillow/Pillow/pull/9398\">PR</a> to add a mapping of\nfile extensions to plugins.

You can see the repo here: <a href=\"https://github.com/danielcristho/cdk-go-simple-restapi\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">cdk-go-simple-restapi</a>. This year, I want to take it a step further by using AWS CDK to create and manage an AWS EKS cluster.</p><p>I’ll be writing a short series of posts around this topic, starting with the basics. In this first post we’ll focus on building a minimal EKS cluster using AWS CDK as the foundation for the next parts of the series.</p><p>Amazon EKS already provides multiple ways to create and manage clusters, from the AWS Console to CloudFormation and Terraform. However, when infrastructure starts to grow in complexity, the way it’s defined and maintained becomes just as important as the resources themselves.</p><p>CDK allows you to define infrastructure using familiar programming languages. Instead of managing large YAML or JSON templates, you work with code—loops, conditions, and abstractions included. This makes infrastructure easier to reason about, review, and evolve over time. According to the documentation, AWS CDK supports multiple languages such as Python, Go, TypeScript, JavaScript, and C#</p><p>For EKS specifically, the kit provides higher-level constructs that abstract away a lot of the boilerplate required to get a cluster running. Networking, IAM roles, and node groups can be defined in a few lines of code while still allowing you to customize the parts that matter.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  How AWS CDK Works with Amazon EKS\n</h2><p>The diagram above shows us how CDK interacts with AWS services when creating an Amazon EKS cluster.</p><p>Everything starts from your CDK application (stack), where infrastructure is defined using a programming language such as Go, TypeScript, or Python. At this stage, no AWS resources are created yet. When you run , AWS CDK translates your code into a standard AWS CloudFormation template.</p><p>This CloudFormation template is then deployed using . At this point, AWS CloudFormation becomes responsible for provisioning the infrastructure. It creates all required AWS resources, including the VPC, IAM roles, the EKS control plane, and the managed node group. <strong>AWS CDK itself does not bypass CloudFormation, it simply acts as a higher-level abstraction on top of it</strong>.</p><p>Once CloudFormation finishes, the Amazon EKS cluster is fully provisioned and exposes a Kubernetes control plane backed by AWS-managed infrastructure. From this point forward, the cluster behaves like a standard Kubernetes cluster.</p><p>Optionally, the CDK can also interact with the Kubernetes API to manage workloads, such as applying Kubernetes manifests or deploying Helm charts. This step usually happens after the cluster is ready and is covered in later parts of this series.</p><p>In this series, all AWS CDK examples will be written in Python.\nWhile AWS CDK supports multiple languages such as TypeScript and Go, the underlying concepts and constructs remain the same regardless of the language used.</p><ul><li><p><strong>AWS account and configured AWS CLI</strong></p><p>An active AWS account with permissions to create EKS, VPC, IAM, and CloudFormation resources.

No Kubernetes workloads are deployed yet.</p></li><li><p>Make sure your AWS credentials have sufficient permissions before running cdk deploy, as EKS provisioning may take several minutes.</p></li></ul><p>We’ll start by creating a new AWS CDK project using Python. AWS CDK provides a project template that sets up the basic structure, dependencies, and configuration needed to get started.</p><p>First, create a new directory and initialize a CDK app:</p><div><pre><code>cdk-eks\ncdk-eks\ncdk init app  python\n</code></pre></div><p>This command generates a basic project structure for a Python-based CDK application. The output after you run </p><div><pre><code>Applying project template app python\n\n\n\nThis is a blank project CDK development with Python.\n\nThe cdk.json file tells the CDK Toolkit how to execute your app.\n\n...\n\nEnjoy!\n\nExecuting Creating virtualenv...\nExecuting Installing dependencies...\n✅ All </code></pre></div><p>After initialization, you should see a structure similar to this:</p><div><pre><code>\n├── app.py\n├── cdk_eks\n│&nbsp;&nbsp; ├── cdk_eks_stack.py\n│&nbsp;&nbsp; └── __init__.py\n├── cdk.json\n├── README.md\n├── requirements-dev.txt\n├── requirements.txt\n├── source.bat\n└── tests\n    ├── __init__.py\n    └── unit\n</code></pre></div><p>The entry point of the CDK application. This is where the stack is instantiated.</p><p>Contains the definition of the CDK stack where we’ll define the EKS cluster.</p><p>Python dependencies for the CDK app.</p><p>CDK configuration file, including the command used to run the app.</p><p>A placeholder for unit tests, which we’ll use in a later post.</p><p>Before writing any code, activate the Python virtual environment and install the dependencies. BTW, you need add this one to your :  <code>aws-cdk.lambda-layer-kubectl-v34</code>.</p><div><pre><code> .venv/bin/activate\npip  requirements.txt\n</code></pre></div><p>Keeping dependencies isolated using a virtual environment helps avoid version conflicts and keeps the project reproducible.</p><p>If this is your first time using AWS CDK in the selected AWS account and region, you’ll need to bootstrap the environment:</p><p>This command creates the necessary resources in your AWS account that CDK requires to deploy stacks.</p><p>At this point, the project is ready, and we can start defining the EKS cluster using AWS CDK.</p><p>In this section, we’ll define a minimal EKS cluster using AWS CDK. The goal is not to build a production-ready cluster yet, but to create a foundation that we can extend in later posts.</p><p>All changes will be made inside the CDK stack file</p><p> Import Required Modules</p><p>Open  and start by importing the required CDK modules:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><ul><li><p> for creating the EKS cluster and its node groups</p></li></ul><p>EKS requires a VPC. For simplicity, we’ll let CDK create one for us:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>This creates a basic VPC across two Availability Zones, which is sufficient for a minimal cluster.</p><p>Next, we define the EKS cluster itself:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><ul><li><p>Kubernetes version is explicitly set to avoid unexpected upgrades.</p></li><li><p> disables the default node group so we can define our own.</p></li></ul><p> Add a Managed Node Group</p><p>Now we add a managed node group to run workloads:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><ul><li><p>A managed EC2-based node group</p></li><li><p>Autoscaling between 1 and 3 nodes</p></li><li><p>Instance type for testing</p></li></ul><p>By default, creating an EKS cluster with AWS CDK does not automatically grant Kubernetes access to the IAM identity used to deploy the stack. While the control plane and node group roles are configured, additional IAM-to-Kubernetes RBAC mapping is required to access the cluster using kubectl.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>At this point, our CDK stack defines:</p><ul><li><p>A managed node group for worker nodes</p></li></ul><p>All of this is defined as code and will be provisioned via CloudFormation.</p><p>Before deploying, it’s a good idea to check what CDK will generate:</p><div><pre><code>cdk synth 2&gt;&amp;1 | \n\nResources:\n  KubectlLayer600207B5:\n    Type: AWS::Lambda::LayerVersion\n    Properties:\n      Content:\n        S3Bucket:\n          Fn::Sub: cdk-hnb659fds-assets-::AccountId-::Region\n        S3Key: cc5bb5a423d0f1ccbfa20b3016434049b477f393e38ad2be0e8cba029f2a2373.zip\n      Description: /opt/kubectl/kubectl 1.32.3 /opt/helm/helm 3.17.2\n      LicenseInfo: Apache-2.0\n\n...\n</code></pre></div><p>This command outputs the CloudFormation template that will be used to create the EKS cluster.</p><p>With the stack definition in place, we can now deploy the EKS cluster using AWS CDK. This step will trigger AWS CloudFormation to provision all required resources.</p><p>Run the following command from the project root:</p><p>During deployment, CDK will:</p><ul><li><p>Package and upload assets (if any)</p></li><li><p>Create or update the CloudFormation stack</p></li><li><p>Provision AWS resources such as the VPC, IAM roles, EKS control plane, and managed node group</p></li></ul><p>You’ll be prompted to confirm the deployment, as the stack creates IAM roles and other security-related resources. Review the changes and approve the deployment when prompted.</p><p>After the deployment completes, the next step is to verify that the EKS cluster has been created successfully and is in a healthy state.</p><p>At this point, you should see a CloudFormation stack created by AWS CDK in the AWS Console.\nThis stack represents all resources defined in the CDK application, including the VPC, IAM roles, EKS control plane, and the managed node group.</p><p>The stack status should be , indicating that all resources were provisioned without errors. This also reinforces that AWS CDK relies on CloudFormation as the underlying provisioning engine.</p><p>Next, navigate to the Amazon EKS console. You should see the newly created cluster listed and marked as Active.</p><p> Accessing the Cluster with kubectl</p><p>To interact with the cluster, update your kubeconfig:</p><div><pre><code>aws eks update-kubeconfig  &lt;cluster-name&gt;  &lt;region&gt;\n</code></pre></div><p>Once configured, verify that the nodes are registered:</p><p>This command deletes the CloudFormation stack and all resources created by AWS CDK, including the EKS cluster, node groups, and networking components.\nSince EKS is not covered by the AWS free tier, it’s recommended to clean up resources when they are no longer needed.</p><p>At this point, we have a fully functional Amazon EKS cluster created and managed using AWS CDK. The cluster is accessible via kubectl, the node group is running, and IAM access has been configured correctly.

The bronze layer simply landed the raw CSV files. The silver layer standardized measurement names. The gold layer aggregated for analysis. Everything worked beautifully.</p><p>This post demonstrates what happens when vendor CSV files exhibit the full spectrum of real-world data quality issues. We'll watch the bronze layer transform from \"just land the data\" into an increasingly complex series of transformations, vendor-specific logic, and fragile workarounds. By the end, we'll be asking uncomfortable questions about what \"bronze\" actually means.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Problem 1: Different Column Names for the Same Measurements\n</h2><p>Vendor A and Vendor B measure the same soil properties. Both provide pH, copper concentration, and zinc concentration. Their CSV files look like this:</p><div><pre><code>sample_barcode,lab_id,date_received,date_processed,ph,copper_ppm,zinc_ppm\n</code></pre></div><div><pre><code>sample_barcode,lab_id,date_received,date_processed,acidity,cu_total,zn_total\n</code></pre></div><p>Same measurements. Different names. Vendor B calls pH \"acidity.\" They use chemical symbols with  suffixes instead of element names with  suffixes.</p><p>This is not a data quality problem. This is a legitimate difference in how two professional laboratories name their measurements. (Although pedantically you might wonder about a chemistry lab that thinks pH and acidity are the same thing.) Both schemas are internally consistent and well-documented. The challenge is ours: we need both vendors' data in the same bronze table.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Bronze Layer: Approach 1 (Add Vendor-Specific Column Mapping)\n</h3><p>We create a standardization function for each vendor:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>The bronze ingestion now includes a vendor detection step:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>This works. We can now query both vendors' data using consistent column names. The bronze layer contains standardized schemas.</p><p>But we just added vendor-specific business logic to what was supposed to be a raw data landing zone.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Problem 2: Schema Instability Within the Same Vendor\n</h2><p>The vendor-specific mapping holds up until Vendor A sends a new file. Our ingestion pipeline fails with a schema mismatch error. Examining the file reveals that Vendor A now includes additional analytes:</p><p><strong>Vendor A - Basic package (what we had):</strong></p><div><pre><code>sample_barcode,lab_id,date_received,date_processed,ph,copper_ppm,zinc_ppm\n</code></pre></div><p><strong>Vendor A - Metals package (what we just received):</strong></p><div><pre><code>sample_barcode,lab_id,date_received,date_processed,ph,copper_ppm,zinc_ppm,lead_ppm,iron_ppm,manganese_ppm\n</code></pre></div><p>The schema changes based on which analysis package the customer ordered. Sometimes they order basic soil testing. Sometimes they add heavy metals analysis. The vendor includes only the columns relevant to what was tested.</p><p>This is also not a data quality problem. Including only requested measurements is reasonable and reduces file size. But it breaks our bronze table schema.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Bronze Layer: Approach 2 (Create Superset Schema)\n</h3><p>The solution requires accommodating all possible variations. We create a superset schema containing all possible columns from all analysis packages. When ingesting files with fewer columns, we add NULL values for missing measurements:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Now our bronze ingestion tracks package types:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><ul><li>Our bronze table is sparse (most columns are NULL for most rows)</li><li>We must maintain a master list of all possible columns for each vendor</li><li>Adding new analytes requires code changes</li><li>We can't distinguish between \"wasn't measured\" and \"measurement failed\"</li></ul><p>The bronze layer is accumulating knowledge about vendor schemas and business rules.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Problem 3: Typos in Column Headers\n</h2><p>Our superset schema handles varying column sets, but the next issue reveals a different category of problem. A file from Vendor A fails to parse correctly. Examining the raw CSV, we find:</p><div><pre><code>sample_barcod,lab_id,date_recieved,date_proccessed,ph,copper_ppm,zinc_ppm\n</code></pre></div><p>Three typos:  (missing 'e'),  (i before e),  (double c). The vendor's export system mangles column names. Occasionally.</p><p>These files are otherwise valid. The data values are correct. Only the header row has issues. Rejecting these files would delay processing by days while we contact the vendor.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Bronze Layer: Approach 3 (Add Fuzzy Column Matching)\n</h3><p>Rejecting files creates unacceptable delays, so we implement fuzzy matching to handle common typos:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Our bronze ingestion grows:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>This works. But we're now making quality decisions about what constitutes an acceptable typo. We're interpreting intent. The bronze layer is no longer just landing raw data.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Problem 4: Excel Nightmares\n</h2><p>Vendor B sends a file that completely breaks our parser. Opening it in a text editor reveals the structure:</p><div><pre><code>Contact:,lab@testing.com,\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\"\nGenerated:,2024-10-15,\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\"\nLab Name:,Premium Soil Testing,\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\"\nSampl_Barcode,lab_id,DATE_RECEIVED,Date_Proccessed,acidity,cu_totl,ZN_TOTL,pb_total,fe_total,Mn_Totl,b_total,mo_totl,ec_ms_cm,Organic_Carbon_Pct,\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\"\nPYB2475-266277,AT6480 68463,2024-05-12,2024-05-19,6.46,6.63,29.5,4.22,103.,3.56,0.759,0.186,1.44,0.30,\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\"\n</code></pre></div><p>Three metadata rows precede the actual header. Additionally, the file has empty column name padding (those trailing empty strings). The file exhibits the telltale signs of an Excel export where someone navigated beyond the data range and accidentally pressed enter before saving.</p><p>The actual data is fine. The measurements are valid. We just need to skip the metadata rows and ignore the empty columns.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Bronze Layer: Approach 4 (Add Header Detection and Column Filtering)\n</h3><p>We implement header detection to skip metadata:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>We filter out empty columns:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>And implement re-reading from the correct header position:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>The bronze ingestion continues to grow:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>The bronze layer now includes heuristics for detecting valid data. We're making educated guesses about file structure.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Problem 5: Database-Hostile Column Names\n</h2><p>Vendor B's files sometimes include special characters in column names:</p><div><pre><code>#sample_id,lab_id,organic_matter%,cu-total,zn-total\n</code></pre></div><p>The  prefix,  suffix, and hyphens require backtick escaping in SQL queries:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Every analyst who touches this data must remember the escaping rules. Queries become brittle and harder to read.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Bronze Layer: Approach 5 (Add Character Sanitization)\n</h3><p>We sanitize column names to be database-friendly:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>The complete bronze ingestion:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Eight transformation steps. Vendor-specific logic branches. Fuzzy matching heuristics. Schema knowledge. Quality decisions.</p><p>This was supposed to be \"just land the raw data.\"</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  The Uncomfortable Questions\n</h2><p>We started with a simple bronze layer that read CSV files and wrote them to a table. We now have a complex ingestion pipeline that:</p><ol><li> Vendor-specific column mapping encodes knowledge about what measurements mean across different schemas</li><li> Fuzzy matching determines which typos are acceptable and how to fix them</li><li> Header detection guesses where real data begins</li><li> Character sanitization changes the raw column names we received</li></ol><p>Is this still a \"bronze layer\"? The Medallion Architecture describes bronze as raw data with minimal transformation. We're well beyond minimal.</p><p>What happens when Vendor C arrives? We add more column mappings to the function, another branch in the if/elif chain, and hope their quirks don't conflict with the assumptions we've baked into our existing logic. And how do we decide what the \"default\" name for the column should be?</p><p>How do we test this? We need sample files for every vendor, every analysis package, every combination of issues. The test matrix grows exponentially.</p><p>We haven't addressed date format differences, unit conversions, vendor-specific codes, or the dozens of other variations we'll encounter as more vendors join the system.</p><p>The bronze layer has gotten away from us.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  How Would You Manage This Complexity?\n</h2><p>Before we explore solutions in the next post, consider how you would handle this problem in your own systems:</p><ul><li>Would you continue adding transformation logic to the bronze layer until it handles every edge case?</li><li>Would you reject files that don't conform to expected formats and force vendors to fix their exports?</li><li>Would you build a configuration system where new vendor quirks can be added without code changes?</li><li>Would you accept some data quality issues and handle them downstream in the silver layer?</li></ul><p>Each approach has tradeoffs. Adding more transformations makes the bronze layer complex and fragile. Rejecting files delays processing and frustrates vendors and users of the data alike. Configuration systems add their own complexity. Pushing problems downstream just moves the pain to a different layer.</p><p>What if the fundamental problem is that we're treating column names as schema when they should be treated as data?</p><p>In the next post, we'll explore this alternative. Instead of fighting schema chaos with increasingly complex transformations, we'll embrace it. We'll examine how a single transformation applied to all vendors can replace vendor-specific logic, superset schemas, fuzzy matching, and header detection with something simpler and more robust.</p><p>The solution involves questioning what \"raw\" actually means.</p><p> Part 3 - The Zen of the Bronze Layer: Embracing Schema Chaos</p>","contentLength":9222,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Python String Manipulation: Every Way to Delete Specific Characters","url":"https://dev.to/lifeportal20002010/python-string-manipulation-every-way-to-delete-specific-characters-1913","date":1769573527,"author":"ライフポータル","guid":424199,"unread":true,"content":"<p>When processing text data in Python, you frequently run into these scenarios:</p><ul><li><strong>\"I want to remove extra whitespace.\"</strong></li><li><strong>\"I need to bulk-delete specific symbols.\"</strong></li><li><strong>\"I want to remove elements from a list that contain certain words.\"</strong></li></ul><p>While it all falls under \"deletion,\" the method you should use depends on whether you are modifying a  or a .

It depends on what you're scraping, how, and why.</p><p><strong>Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA).</strong> This US law prohibits \"unauthorized access\" to computer systems. The hiQ Labs v. LinkedIn case (2022) clarified that scraping publicly accessible data generally doesn't violate the CFAA.</p><p> Most websites prohibit scraping in their terms. Violating terms isn't automatically illegal, but it can create civil liability.</p><p> Scraped content may be copyrighted. Extracting facts is generally permissible; copying creative expression is not.</p><p> GDPR, CCPA, and similar laws regulate personal data collection. Scraping personal information creates compliance obligations.</p><p> This file indicates which parts of a site bots should avoid. It's not legally binding but ignoring it weakens legal defenses.</p><p>This isn't legal advice. Consult an attorney for specific situations.</p><p>Legal doesn't mean ethical. Even permitted scraping can be problematic.</p><p> Aggressive scraping can overload servers, affecting real users. You're using someone else's infrastructure.</p><p> Scraping a competitor's pricing to systematically undercut them raises ethical questions, even if technically legal.</p><p> Just because someone posted information publicly doesn't mean they consented to bulk collection.</p><p><strong>Business model disruption.</strong> Some websites rely on advertising revenue from visitors. Scraping without visiting the page circumvents their revenue model.</p><p>The ethical test: would the website operator consider your actions reasonable? If not, proceed with caution.</p><p>The robots.txt file lives at a site's root (e.g., example.com/robots.txt) and specifies scraping rules.</p><div><pre><code>User-agent: *\nDisallow: /private/\nCrawl-delay: 10\n\nUser-agent: BadBot\nDisallow: /\n</code></pre></div><p>This file asks all bots to avoid /private/, wait 10 seconds between requests, and blocks \"BadBot\" entirely.</p><p>Respecting robots.txt is industry standard. Ignoring it signals bad faith and weakens legal defenses if disputes arise.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><h2>\n  \n  \n  Rate Limiting and Politeness\n</h2><p>Hammering a server with requests is both rude and counterproductive. Servers detect aggressive bots and block them.</p><p> Space requests seconds apart.

Common measures and countermeasures:</p><p> Websites block requests with obvious bot user-agents.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p> After too many requests, your IP gets blocked. Rotating proxies can help—but this enters ethically gray territory.</p><p> Designed to distinguish humans from bots.

Following them flags you as a scraper.</p><p>Aggressive anti-circumvention measures may cross ethical and legal lines. Consider whether the site is clearly saying \"no.\"</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Data Storage and Processing\n</h2><p>Scraped data needs somewhere to go.</p><p> Easy to produce, universally readable.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p> Preserves nested data better than CSV.</p><p> SQLite for local work, PostgreSQL for larger projects.</p><p> Stripping whitespace, normalizing formats, and validating data during scraping saves pain later.</p><p>Production scrapers need error handling and recovery.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p> Networks fail. Set reasonable timeouts and retry.</p><p> When something breaks at 3 AM, logs are essential.</p><p> Keep the original pages. Re-parsing is easier than re-scraping.</p><p> For large jobs, save progress incrementally. Crashes shouldn't mean starting over.</p><p>Let's scrape a book catalog (using a site designed for practice).</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Simple, effective, and polite.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Frequently Asked Questions\n</h2><p>\nGenerally yes for publicly accessible data, but it depends on jurisdiction, terms of service, data type, and purpose. When in doubt, consult a lawyer.</p><p><strong>Can I scrape any website?</strong>\nTechnically yes, but not all scraping is legal or ethical. Check terms of service, robots.txt, and consider whether you're causing harm.</p><p><strong>How do I avoid getting blocked?</strong>\nUse delays between requests, rotate user-agents, respect robots.txt, and don't scrape faster than a human could browse.</p><p><strong>Should I use an API instead of scraping?</strong>\nIf an API meets your needs, yes. APIs are more reliable, explicitly permitted, and easier to work with.</p><p><strong>What about scraping social media?</strong>\nSocial media platforms have strict terms and aggressive anti-scraping measures. Scraping them carries higher legal risk.</p><p><strong>Is it okay to scrape personal information?</strong>\nBe very careful. Data protection laws like GDPR apply. Even public personal data may require consent for collection.</p><p><strong>What tools should I start with?</strong>\nRequests and BeautifulSoup for static pages. Add Selenium when you need JavaScript rendering.</p><p><strong>How do I handle pagination?</strong>\nIdentify the URL pattern for pages and loop through them. Or find and follow \"Next\" links programmatically.</p><p>\nPossibly, but this amplifies legal concerns. Commercialization changes risk calculations.</p><p><strong>What if the site changes its structure?</strong>\nYour scraper breaks. This is normal. Monitor for failures and update selectors when layouts change.</p><p>Web scraping is a powerful tool for data analysts. It opens access to data that would otherwise be inaccessible or prohibitively expensive.</p><p>But power comes with responsibility. Scrape legally. Scrape ethically. Respect the websites and people behind them.</p><p>When done right, scraping extends your analytical capabilities far beyond the limits of official data sources.</p><p><em>This article was refined with the help of AI tools to improve clarity and readability.</em></p>","contentLength":7974,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"🎬 行為辨識","url":"https://dev.to/stklen/xing-wei-bian-shi-34dj","date":1769569236,"author":"TK Lin","guid":424183,"unread":true,"content":"<p>AI 能辨識這是 Jelly 還是 Ariel 後，下一步是什麼？</p><p>：讓 AI 不只認出動物，還能理解牠們在做什麼。</p><div><table><tbody></tbody></table></div><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>：簡單、快速：無法判斷連續動作（如「正在走」vs「停下來」）</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><ol></ol><div><table><tbody></tbody></table></div><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><div><table><tbody></tbody></table></div><div><pre><code>輸入影片 → 行為辨識 → 自動加標籤\n                  ↓\n           「Jelly 睡覺」「Dollar 進食」\n</code></pre></div><ul></ul><ul></ul><ol></ol><ul></ul>","contentLength":336,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Understanding Mixins in Python, Django, and Django REST Framework","url":"https://dev.to/ajitkumar/understanding-mixins-in-python-django-and-django-rest-framework-2j40","date":1769568921,"author":"Ajit Kumar","guid":424182,"unread":true,"content":"<p>If you have been working with Python or Django for a while, you’ve likely heard the acronym DRY: Don't Repeat Yourself.</p><p>But as your project grows, you might find yourself copying and pasting the same created_at field across ten models, or the same permission_classes logic across five views.

I'm not sure what the second bullet means because I'm not a Validatar expert and that one isn't explained on that page.</p><p>Moving on, let's create that template. Most of this exercise is forms based. The setup is shown in the image below. Their ask is that you notice:</p><ul><li><em>Note that the column specified to group by is account_id</em></li><li><em>Note that it is comparing the ROW_COUNT to a fixed value of 1</em></li><li><em>Note that the Result Configuration is set so that only Failures are kept and to abort after 100 failures are found</em></li></ul><p>Good requirements for us to use on the CsvPath side. <a href=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2F5ipx2l8stt9rkr2a8l93.png\"><img src=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2F5ipx2l8stt9rkr2a8l93.png\" alt=\" \" width=\"800\" height=\"427\"></a></p><p>At this point we have our test. Now we need to create a template from it so that we can apply it to each CSV file. This is how we get to a single action we can apply to multiple files in a uniform way. </p><p>I'm going to just add the bullets because the screenshot is in the link above, which is of course a more complete description. We do: </p><ul><li>Update the Folder input to </li><li>Update the File input to </li><li>Update the Column input to <code>{{#replace table.name \"_data.csv\" \"_id\"}}</code></li><li>Update the Metadata Links to <code>{{schema.name}}.{{table..name}}</code></li><li>Change the Generate column list using to Dynamic Template Configuration</li><li>Update the Dynamic Script</li></ul><p>The dynamic script is pretty simple:</p><div><pre><code>    [\n    {\"name\":\"{{#replace table.name \"_data.csv\" \"_id\"}}\",\"sequence\":1,\"type\":\"Numeric\",\"role\":\"Key\"},\n        {\"name\":\"ROW_COUNT\",\"sequence\":2,\"type\":\"Numeric\",\"role\":\"Value\"}\n    ]\n</code></pre></div><p>Now, we're going to use some metadata to filter down to the files we care about. </p><ul><li>Switch to the Metadata Selection Tab</li><li>Change to the  option</li><li>Add a Filter on the Table Name Field that contains \"_data.csv\"</li></ul><p>At this point, check that the filter finds your files and run the example. You should be good to go. My feeling is that all works better for database tables than for CSV files, just as you would expect from Validatar.</p><p>Once more, this time with feeling! Let's see how CsvPath Framework and FlightPath Data can make the same magic happen. And, hopefully you'll agree that it's much simpler and more powerful for its use case.</p><ul><li>Create a uniqueness test for all csv files in multiple folders</li><li>The column specified to group by is account_id</li></ul><p>The core of these requirements is the validation statement. Using CsvPath Validation Language this is next to trivial:</p><div><pre><code>$[*][ \n    @duplicate_accounts.nocontrib == 100 -&gt; stop()\n    has_dups(#account_id) -&gt; counter.duplicate_accounts(1) \n]\n</code></pre></div><p><em>(The  sign means a variable and the  sign indicates a header name)</em></p><p>This csvpath says: for each line in a file check if the counter is . If it is, stop processing that file. Otherwise, increase the counter if the  is a duplicate.</p><p>The statement will collect only error lines because:</p><ul><li>The counter is a side-effect with no contribution to matching</li><li>The check if  equals  is marked to not contribute to matching. (Using the  qualifier)</li></ul><p>The function that does the heavy lifting is . If that returns  (i.e. the value of ) we match the line and capture it.</p><p>All pretty readable. Now what do we do with it?</p><p>All of what we need to do is almost as simple in Python using only CsvPath Framework. Almost! But using FlightPath Data it is even simpler.</p><p>In FlightPath, create a new file called . Paste in our statement. </p><p>Right-click on  and select . </p><p>In the load dialog give the named-paths group the name  and click . </p><p>You should see your csvpath show up in the middle window on the right under the  folder. When you load a csvpath statement it always goes into a  file. And when you click on that file its background is pale green to let you know you cannot edit it. (You can, of course, over-write it anytime without losing prior versions, but that is another topic for a different post.)</p><p>Next stage your data. In the example, each file is in its own folder and its folder is one of many in the same directory. We'll just add the parent folder and let FlightPath find the files for us. </p><p>To do that right click the parent directory and select . In the stage data dialog uncheck the  checkbox because we're going to have every physical file be one version of the same named-file. Think of a named-file as a category that has one file assigned to it at a time, in sequence. We say named-files have versions.</p><p>In the named-file name box type . That's our category. You will see your data in the top-right window as a directory named . I used a template of :6/:filename in order to keep the month folders, but that is completely optional.</p><p>Finally, right click the  folder, or the  folder below it, and select . In the run dialog, for named-paths select . For named-file type in . That named-file name is a reference that indicates every version of the  named-file. Again remember, the named-file is like a category that registers a file at a time. We registered a bunch of files and now we're applying our CsvPath Validation Language statement to each of them in turn.</p><p>And here's the Run dialog: </p><p>When you click  you will see your results in the lower right-hand window. Your run is date stamped within the  results. In your date-stamped run you can see the  where your duplicate lines landed. In this image I dropped each run into its own folder using a template; you can see the  and . That is completely optional, of course.</p><p>There is, of course, much more you can do with CsvPath Framework. Likewise, Validatar has a ton more functionality than what we showed. But now you've had a taste of both. </p><p>What I'd hope you come away with is that CsvPath Framework is the better tool for CSV, JSONL, and Excel file validation. The ease of using <a href=\"https://www.flightpathdata.com\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">FlightPath Data</a> for this validation example makes the case well. Obviously, for relational database validation, Validatar is your horse.</p><p>And of course I also want to point out again that <a href=\"https://www.csvpath.org\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">CsvPath Framework</a> is a complete data preboarding solution, not just a validation engine. Preboarding inbound data files is a big deal. If you need that (and who doesn't?) you owe it to yourself to take a look at CsvPath Framework.</p>","contentLength":7201,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Efficiently Transforming CSV Data to Styled Excel Worksheets with Python","url":"https://dev.to/allen_yang_f905170c5a197b/efficiently-transforming-csv-data-to-styled-excel-worksheets-with-python-38e5","date":1769565540,"author":"Allen Yang","guid":424113,"unread":true,"content":"<p>Raw data, often residing in CSV files, is the lifeblood of many organizations. However, presenting this data directly can be challenging. CSVs are excellent for data storage and interchange due to their simplicity, but they lack the visual structure and formatting capabilities required for effective analysis and professional reporting. This is where Excel steps in. With its robust formatting options, charting tools, and user-friendly interface, Excel transforms raw data into understandable and actionable insights.</p><p>The manual process of converting CSVs to Excel and then meticulously applying styles can be time-consuming and prone to errors, especially with large datasets or recurring tasks. This article will guide you through automating this process using Python, enabling you to convert your CSV data into professional, styled Excel spreadsheets efficiently. We'll explore how to not only transfer data but also to enhance its readability and impact through various formatting techniques, leveraging a powerful Python library designed for comprehensive Excel manipulation.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Preparing Your Python Environment for Excel Automation\n</h2><p>To effectively interact with and style Excel files in Python, a dedicated library is essential. While several options exist, some offer more extensive control over Excel's features, particularly when it comes to intricate styling and advanced functionalities. For this tutorial, we will be using a robust library that provides deep integration with Excel's object model, allowing for precise control over formatting and data presentation.</p><p>To get started, you'll need to install the library. Open your terminal or command prompt and execute the following command:</p><p>This command will download and install Spire.XLS for Python, an API designed to create, read, edit, and convert Excel files. Its comprehensive feature set, including support for a wide range of Excel versions and extensive styling capabilities, makes it an excellent choice for automating complex Excel tasks, from basic data transfer to advanced report generation.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Fundamental CSV to Excel Conversion\n</h3><p>Before diving into styling, let's establish the basic process of converting a CSV file into an Excel workbook. This fundamental step involves reading the CSV content and then saving it as an  file.</p><p>Here’s a simple Python script to perform this basic conversion:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Below is a preview of the output Excel file:</p><p>In this code,  creates an empty Excel file.  then reads your CSV data directly into the first sheet. Finally, <code>sheet.AllocatedRange.AutoFitColumns()</code> adjusts the column widths to fit their content, and  saves the result. This script provides a functional Excel file, but it lacks any visual enhancements.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Implementing Essential Excel Styling for Clarity\n</h2><p>While the basic conversion is functional, raw data in Excel can still be hard to read. Implementing essential styling, such as formatting headers, adjusting column widths, and applying proper number and date formats, dramatically improves clarity and professionalism.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Formatting Headers and Auto-fitting Columns\n</h3><p>Headers are crucial for understanding data. Making them stand out with bold formatting and ensuring columns are wide enough to display all content are fundamental steps in creating a readable spreadsheet.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Below is a preview of the output Excel file with styled headers:</p><p>In this example, we create a new style (), set its font to bold, assign a light gray background, and center the text. This style is then applied to the first row, which typically contains the headers. <code>sheet.AllocatedRange.AutoFitColumns()</code> is called again to ensure all content, including potential longer header texts, is fully visible.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Applying Number and Date Formatting\n</h3><p>Raw data often treats numbers and dates as plain text, leading to formatting inconsistencies or incorrect calculations in Excel. Explicitly setting number and date formats ensures data integrity and improves readability.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Below is a preview of the output Excel file with formatted numbers and dates:</p><p>Here, we select specific column ranges ( for Amount,  for Date) and apply custom number formats using . This ensures that monetary values are displayed with currency symbols and two decimal places, and dates are presented in a consistent  format. These small details significantly enhance the professional appearance and utility of your data.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Advanced Styling Techniques for Professional Data Presentation\n</h2><p>Beyond basic formatting, advanced styling techniques like borders, background colors, and conditional formatting can further elevate your Excel reports, making them more visually appealing and easier to interpret.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Adding Borders and Background Colors\n</h3><p>Visual separation and grouping of data can be achieved effectively using borders and alternating row colors. This helps guide the reader's eye and distinguishes different data elements.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Below is a preview of the output Excel file with advanced styling applied:</p><p>In this script, <code>data_range.BorderAround()</code> adds a thin black border around the entire dataset, while <code>data_range.BorderInside()</code> adds lighter gray borders between cells. For alternating rows, a loop iterates through the data rows, applying a  background color to even-numbered rows, creating a visually distinct pattern that improves navigability.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Implementing Simple Conditional Formatting\n</h3><p>Conditional formatting highlights data based on specific rules, drawing immediate attention to critical information.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Below is a preview of the output Excel file with conditional formatting applied:</p><p>In this final enhancement, we target the  column and add a conditional formatting rule. <code>cf.FormatType = ConditionValueType.Number</code> specifies that the rule is based on the cell's value. <code>cf.Operator = ComparisonOperatorType.Greater</code> sets the condition, and  defines the threshold. Cells meeting this condition will have their background color changed to , instantly drawing attention to higher amounts.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Streamlining Data Presentation Workflows\n</h2><p>This tutorial has guided you through a practical journey of transforming raw CSV data into professionally styled Excel spreadsheets using Python. We started with a fundamental CSV-to-Excel conversion, then progressively enhanced the output with crucial styling elements: bold headers, auto-fitted columns, precise number and date formatting, and advanced visual cues like borders, alternating row colors, and conditional formatting.</p><p>The power of Python, especially when combined with a comprehensive library like Spire.XLS for Python, lies in its ability to automate these intricate tasks. By scripting these processes, you eliminate manual effort, reduce the risk of human error, and ensure consistent, high-quality data presentation across all your reports. This automation not only saves valuable time but also elevates the professionalism and clarity of your data analysis and reporting workflows.</p>","contentLength":6920,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"🌀 Beginner-Friendly Guide 'Minimum Cost Path with Teleportations' - LeetCode 3651 (C++, Python, JavaScript)","url":"https://dev.to/om_shree_0709/beginner-friendly-guide-minimum-cost-path-with-teleportations-leetcode-3651-c-python-pk8","date":1769562514,"author":"Om Shree","guid":424097,"unread":true,"content":"<p>Navigating a grid is a classic coding challenge, but adding teleportation changes the game entirely.

How many units will we sell next quarter? What will demand look like during the holiday season? When should we increase inventory?</p><p>These questions require time series forecasting—analyzing historical patterns to predict future values.</p><p>The good news: Python makes time series analysis accessible. You don't need a PhD in statistics. You need the right approach and the right tools.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  What Makes Time Series Special\n</h2><p>Time series data isn't like other data. The order matters. Yesterday's value influences today's. Last year's pattern might repeat this year.</p><p>This temporal dependence violates assumptions that most statistical techniques rely on. You can't just throw time series data at a standard regression and expect good results.</p><p>Understanding the unique properties of time series is essential before diving into techniques.</p><p>Every time series can be decomposed into fundamental components.</p><p> The long-term direction. Is the series generally increasing, decreasing, or stable? Sales might trend upward as a company grows.</p><p> Regular, predictable patterns that repeat at fixed intervals. Retail sales spike in December. Ice cream sales peak in summer.</p><p> Longer-term fluctuations that aren't as regular as seasonality. Economic cycles affect many time series.</p><p> What's left after removing trend and seasonality. Sometimes called noise, though it may contain meaningful variation.</p><p>Decomposition helps you understand what's driving your data before you try to forecast it.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Setting Up Your Environment\n</h2><p>Python's ecosystem for time series is mature and powerful. Here's what you need:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Pandas handles time-indexed data naturally. Statsmodels provides classical time series methods. Scikit-learn offers evaluation metrics.</p><p>For more advanced work, consider Prophet (from Meta), pmdarima (auto-ARIMA), and sktime (unified time series interface).</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Loading and Preparing Time Series Data\n</h2><p>Time series data needs proper datetime indexing. Without it, Python treats your data as arbitrary rows.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>The frequency specification matters. Many time series methods assume regular intervals. Gaps or irregular timestamps cause problems.</p><p>Before modeling, understand your data visually.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Look for obvious patterns. Is there a trend?</p><p>Seasonal spikes? Outliers? Structural breaks where behavior changed?</p><p>This visual inspection guides your modeling choices.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Stationarity: Why It Matters\n</h2><p>Many forecasting methods require stationarity—the statistical properties of the series don't change over time.</p><p>A stationary series has constant mean, constant variance, and consistent autocorrelation structure. Most real-world time series aren't stationary.</p><p>The Augmented Dickey-Fuller test helps check stationarity:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>If your series isn't stationary, you'll need to transform it—usually through differencing.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Making a Series Stationary\n</h2><p>Differencing removes trend by computing changes between consecutive values.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>First differencing removes linear trends. Seasonal differencing removes repeating patterns. Sometimes you need both.</p><p>After differencing, check stationarity again. Multiple rounds might be needed.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Classical Forecasting: ARIMA\n</h2><p>ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) remains a workhorse for time series forecasting.</p><p>The three parameters (p, d, q) define the model:</p><ul><li>: Autoregressive order (how many past values influence the current value)</li><li>: Degree of differencing (how many times to difference for stationarity)</li><li>: Moving average order (how many past errors influence the current value)\n</li></ul><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Choosing the right parameters requires experimentation. You can use ACF and PACF plots for guidance, or rely on automated selection.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Auto-ARIMA: Parameter Selection Made Easy\n</h2><p>Manually tuning ARIMA parameters is tedious. The pmdarima library automates this:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Auto-ARIMA searches through parameter combinations and selects the best model based on information criteria.</p><p>When seasonality is present, SARIMA extends ARIMA with additional seasonal parameters.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>The seasonal order (P, D, Q, m) mirrors the non-seasonal parameters but operates at the seasonal frequency m.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Prophet: Accessible Forecasting\n</h2><p>Meta's Prophet is designed for business time series. It handles seasonality, holidays, and missing data gracefully.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Prophet is less flexible than ARIMA but requires less expertise. It's excellent for quick, reasonable forecasts.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Train-Test Splitting for Time Series\n</h2><p>Standard random train-test splits don't work for time series. You can't use future data to predict the past.</p><p>Always split chronologically:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>The test set must come after the training set. Otherwise, your evaluation is meaningless.</p><p>Common metrics for time series forecast evaluation:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>MAPE is intuitive but undefined when actuals are zero. MAE and RMSE are more robust but less interpretable.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Cross-Validation for Time Series\n</h2><p>Time series cross-validation uses rolling or expanding windows:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Each fold trains on historical data and tests on a subsequent period. This gives a realistic estimate of forecast accuracy.</p><p> Fitting models to non-stationary data produces unreliable forecasts.</p><p> Complex models with many parameters fit training data perfectly but generalize poorly.</p><p> Failing to account for obvious seasonal patterns leads to systematic errors.</p><p> Using future information during training—easy to do accidentally with calculated features.</p><p><strong>Over-reliance on point forecasts.</strong> Always consider prediction intervals, not just the central forecast.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  When Simple Beats Complex\n</h2><p>Surprisingly often, simple methods outperform sophisticated ones.</p><p>Naive forecasts (tomorrow equals today) and seasonal naive forecasts (next January equals last January) are strong baselines. If your fancy model can't beat them, it's not adding value.</p><p>Exponential smoothing methods are simpler than ARIMA and often perform comparably.</p><p>Always start simple. Add complexity only when it demonstrably improves forecasts.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Frequently Asked Questions\n</h2><p><strong>What's the minimum amount of data needed for time series forecasting?</strong>\nIt depends on seasonality. To detect yearly patterns, you need multiple years of data. For weekly patterns, months might suffice. Generally, more data is better.</p><p><strong>How far ahead can I forecast reliably?</strong>\nForecast accuracy degrades with horizon length. Short-term forecasts (days to weeks) are typically much more accurate than long-term ones (quarters to years).</p><p><strong>Should I use ARIMA or Prophet?</strong>\nProphet is easier and handles holidays well. ARIMA offers more control and performs better when properly tuned. Try both and compare on your data.</p><p><strong>How do I handle missing values?</strong>\nInterpolation works for small gaps. For larger gaps, consider whether the missing pattern itself contains information. Some methods like Prophet handle missing values automatically.</p><p><strong>Can I use machine learning for time series?</strong>\nYes. LSTMs, Gradient Boosting, and other ML methods work for time series but require careful feature engineering and cross-validation.</p><p><strong>What if my series has multiple seasonal patterns?</strong>\nProphet handles multiple seasonalities well. SARIMA requires choosing the dominant pattern. For complex seasonality, consider Fourier terms as features.</p><p><strong>How do I forecast multiple related time series?</strong>\nHierarchical forecasting and vector autoregression (VAR) handle multiple series. Prophet and other methods can be applied to each series independently.</p><p><strong>What about external factors that affect my series?</strong>\nARIMAX and Prophet with regressors allow you to include external variables. Be careful about needing to forecast the regressors themselves.</p><p><strong>How do I communicate uncertainty to stakeholders?</strong>\nAlways present prediction intervals alongside point forecasts. Explain that forecasts become more uncertain further into the future.</p><p><strong>What resources should I use to learn more?</strong>\n\"Forecasting: Principles and Practice\" by Hyndman and Athanasopoulos is freely available online and excellent.</p><p>Time series forecasting doesn't require advanced mathematics. It requires understanding the patterns in your data and choosing appropriate methods.</p><p>Start with visualization and decomposition. Check stationarity.</p><p>Try simple methods first. Compare against baselines. Always include uncertainty in your forecasts.</p><p>With Python's powerful libraries, reliable forecasts are within reach for any data analyst willing to learn the fundamentals.</p><p><em>This article was refined with the help of AI tools to improve clarity and readability.</em></p>","contentLength":8362,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Giampaolo Rodola: From Python 3.3 to today: ending 15 years of subprocess polling","url":"https://gmpy.dev/blog/2026/event-driven-process-waiting","date":1769554800,"author":"","guid":425500,"unread":true,"content":"<p>One of the less fun aspects of process management on POSIX systems is waiting\nfor a process to terminate.

Until recently, I believed they could only be used with file\ndescriptors referencing sockets, pipes, etc., but it turns out they can also be\nused to wait for events on process PIDs!</p><p>In 2019, Linux 5.3 introduced a new syscall,\n,\nwhich was added to the  module in Python 3.9. It returns a file descriptor\nreferencing a process PID. The interesting thing is that  can be\nused in conjunction with ,  or  to effectively wait\nuntil the process exits. E.g. by using :</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>This approach has zero busy-looping. The kernel wakes us up exactly when the\nprocess terminates or when the timeout expires if the PID is still alive.</p><p>I chose  over  because  has a historical file\ndescriptor limit (), which typically caps it at 1024 file\ndescriptors per-process (reminded me of\n<a href=\"https://bugs.python.org/issue1685000\">BPO-1685000</a>).</p><p>I chose  over  because it does not require creating an\nadditional file descriptor. It also needs only a single syscall, which should\nmake it a bit more efficient when monitoring a single FD rather than many.</p><p>BSD-derived systems (including macOS) provide the  syscall. It's\nconceptually similar to ,  and , but more powerful\n(e.g. it can also handle regular files).  can be passed a PID\ndirectly, and it will return once the PID disappears or the timeout expires:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Windows does not busy-loop, both in psutil and subprocess module, thanks to\n. This means Windows has effectively had event-driven\nprocess waiting from the start. So nothing to do on that front.</p><p>Both  and  can fail for different reasons. For example,\nwith  if the process runs out of file descriptors (usually 1024), or\nwith  /  if the syscall was explicitly blocked at the system\nlevel by the sysadmin (e.g. via SECCOMP). In all cases, psutil silently falls\nback to the traditional busy-loop polling approach rather than raising an\nexception.</p><p>This fast-path-with-fallback approach is similar in spirit to\n<a href=\"https://bugs.python.org/issue33671\">BPO-33671</a>, where I sped up\n by using zero-copy system calls back in 2018. In there,\nmore efficient  is attempted first, and if it fails (e.g. on\nnetwork filesystems) we fall back to the traditional  / \napproach to copy regular files.</p><p>As a simple experiment, here's a simple program which waits on itself for 10\nseconds without terminating:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>We can measure the CPU context switching using .

It’s the sentence that makes Senior Engineers sigh and rub their temples.\n​\"But it works on my machine!\"<p>\n​You wrote the code. You tested it on your laptop. It worked perfectly. Then you pushed it to the server, and it crashed. Why?</p>\nMaybe you have Python 3.10, and the server has Python 3.8.<p>\nMaybe you are on a Mac, and the server is Linux.</p>\nMaybe you installed a library three months ago and forgot to put it in your requirements.txt.<p>\n​This is called Environment Drift, and it is a nightmare.</p>\n​The solution is Docker.<p>\n​The Shipping Container Analogy</p>\n​Before 1950, shipping goods was a disaster. You had barrels of whiskey, sacks of flour, and loose furniture. Loading them onto a ship took forever because every item was a different shape.<p>\n​Then, the standardized Shipping Container was invented.</p>\nIt didn't matter what was inside (cars, grain, TVs). The container was always the exact same size. The crane didn't need to know what was inside; it just needed to lift the box.<p>\n​Docker does this for code.</p>\nIt creates a digital \"Container\" that holds everything your app needs:<p>\n​The Operating System (e.g., a tiny version of Linux).</p>\n​The Code.\n​The Environment Variables.<p>\n​When you ship your app, you don't ship just the code. You ship the whole box. If it runs on your laptop, it is mathematically guaranteed to run on the server, because the environment inside the box never changes.</p>\n​The 3 Concepts You Need to Know<p>\n​Forget the complex commands for a second. Understand these three words:</p>\n​Dockerfile (The Recipe): A text file that tells Docker how to build your box. (\"Start with Linux, install Python, copy my files, run this command\").<p>\n​Image (The Blueprint): When you run the recipe, you get an Image. This is a frozen snapshot of your app. It cannot be changed.</p>\n​Container (The House): When you actually run the Image, it becomes a Container. This is the live, running application.\n​Let's say you have a simple Python script.\nYou tell your friend, \"Install Python, then run pip install requests, then run python main.py.\"<p>\n(This fails if they have the wrong Python version).</p>\n​With Docker:</p><p>RUN pip install -r requirements.txt</p><p>CMD [\"python\", \"main.py\"]</p><p>Now, your friend just types:\ndocker build -t my-app .\n​It works instantly. No installing Python. No version conflicts. It just works.\n​Docker isn't just for DevOps engineers. It is for anyone who values their sanity.<p>\nIt forces you to document your dependencies explicitly. It allows you to onboard new developers in minutes, not days.</p>\n​If you want to be a professional software engineer, stop relying on your local setup. Containerize everything.<p>\n​Hi, I'm Frank Oge. I build high-performance software and write about the tech that powers it.

We train interactive avatar video models. Our API lets you upload a photo and immediately jump into a FaceTime-style call with that character. Here's a demo: <a href=\"https://www.loom.com/share/941577113141418e80d2834c83a5a0a9\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.loom.com/share/941577113141418e80d2834c83a5a0a9</a><p>Chatbots are everywhere and voice AI has taken off, but we believe video avatars will be the most common form factor for conversational AI. Most people would rather watch something than read it. The problem is that generating video in real-time is hard, and overcoming the uncanny valley is even harder.</p><p>We haven’t broken the uncanny valley yet. Nobody has. But we’re getting close and our photorealistic avatars are currently best-in-class (judge for yourself: <a href=\"https://lemonslice.com/try/taylor\">https://lemonslice.com/try/taylor</a>). Plus, we're the only avatar model that can do animals and heavily stylized cartoons. Try it: <a href=\"https://lemonslice.com/try/alien\">https://lemonslice.com/try/alien</a>. Warning! Talking to this little guy may improve your mood.</p><p>Today we're releasing our new model* - Lemon Slice 2, a 20B-parameter diffusion transformer that generates infinite-length video at 20fps on a single GPU - and opening up our API.</p><p>How did we get a video diffusion model to run in real-time? There was no single trick, just a lot of them stacked together. The first big change was making our model causal. Standard video diffusion models are bidirectional (they look at frames both before and after the current one), which means you can't stream.</p><p>From there it was about fitting everything on one GPU. We switched from full to sliding window attention, which killed our memory bottleneck. We distilled from 40 denoising steps down to just a few - quality degraded less than we feared, especially after using GAN-based distillation (though tuning that adversarial loss to avoid mode collapse was its own adventure).</p><p>And the rest was inference work: modifying RoPE from complex to real (this one was cool!), precision tuning, fusing kernels, a special rolling KV cache, lots of other caching, and more. We kept shaving off milliseconds wherever we could and eventually got to real-time.</p><p>We set up a guest playground for HN so you can create and talk to characters without logging in: <a href=\"https://lemonslice.com/hn\">https://lemonslice.com/hn</a>. For those who want to build with our API (we have a new LiveKit integration that we’re pumped about!), grab a coupon code in the HN playground for your first Pro month free ($100 value).

Pushpay’s church management system provides church administrators and ministry leaders with insight-driven reporting, donor development dashboards, and automation of financial workflows.</p><p>Using the power of generative AI, Pushpay developed an innovative agentic AI search feature built for the unique needs of ministries. The approach uses natural language processing so ministry staff can ask questions in plain English and generate real-time, actionable insights from their community data. The AI search feature addresses a critical challenge faced by ministry leaders: the need for quick access to community insights without requiring technical expertise. For example, ministry leaders can enter “show me people who are members in a group, but haven’t given this year” or “show me people who are not engaged in my church,” and use the results to take meaningful action to better support individuals in their community. Most community leaders are time-constrained and lack technical backgrounds; they can use this solution to obtain meaningful data about their congregations in seconds using natural language queries.</p><p>By empowering ministry staff with faster access to community insights, the AI search feature supports Pushpay’s mission to encourage generosity and connection between churches and their community members. Early adoption users report that this solution has shortened their time to insights from minutes to seconds. To achieve this result, the Pushpay team built the feature using agentic AI capabilities on <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Amazon Web Services (AWS) </a>while implementing robust quality assurance measures and establishing a rapid iterative feedback loop for continuous improvements.</p><p>In this post, we walk you through Pushpay’s journey in building this solution and explore how Pushpay used&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Amazon Bedrock</a> to create a custom generative AI evaluation framework for continuous quality assurance and establishing rapid iteration feedback loops on AWS.</p><h2>Solution overview: AI powered search architecture</h2><p>The solution consists of several key components that work together to deliver an enhanced search experience. The following figure shows the solution architecture diagram and the overall workflow.</p><p>Figure 1: AI Search Solution Architecture</p><ul><li> The solution begins with Pushpay users submitting natural language queries through the existing Pushpay application interface.&nbsp;By using natural language queries, church ministry staff can obtain data insights using AI capabilities without learning new tools or interfaces.</li><li> At the heart of the system lies the AI search agent, which consists of two key components: \n  <ul><li>: Contains the large language model (LLM) role definitions, instructions, and application descriptions that guide the agent’s behavior.</li><li><strong>Dynamic prompt constructor (DPC)</strong>: automatically constructs additional customized system prompts based on the user specific information, such as church context, sample queries, and application filter inventory. They also use semantic search to select only relevant filters among hundreds of available application filters. The DPC improves response accuracy and user experience.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Amazon Bedrock advanced feature:</strong>&nbsp;The solution uses the following Amazon Bedrock managed services: \n  <ul><li><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/prompt-caching/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"></a>: Reduces latency and costs by caching frequently used system prompt.</li><li>: Uses Claude Sonnet 4.5 to process prompts and generate JSON output required by the application to display the desired query results as insights to users.</li></ul></li><li>The evaluation system implements a closed-loop improvement solution where user interactions are instrumented, captured and evaluated offline. The evaluation results feed into a dashboard for product and engineering teams to analyze and drive iterative improvements to the AI search agent.&nbsp;During this process, the data science team collects a golden dataset and continuously curates this dataset based on the actual user queries coupled with validated responses.</li></ul><h2>The challenges of initial solution without evaluation</h2><p>To create the AI search feature, Pushpay developed the first iteration of the AI search agent. The solution implements a single agent configured with a carefully tuned system prompt that includes the system role, instructions, and how the user interface works with detailed explanation of each filter tool and their sub-settings. The system prompt is cached using <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/prompt-caching/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Amazon Bedrock prompt caching</a> to reduce token cost and latency. The agent uses the system prompt to invoke an Amazon Bedrock LLM which generates the JSON document that Pushpay’s application uses to apply filters and present query results to users.</p><p>However, this first iteration quickly revealed some limitations. While it demonstrated a 60-70% success rate with basic business queries, the team reached an accuracy plateau. The evaluation of the agent was a manual and tedious process Tuning the system prompt beyond this accuracy threshold proved challenging given the diverse spectrum of user queries and the application’s coverage of over 100 distinct configurable filters. These presented critical blockers for the team’s path to production.</p><p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/f1f836cb4ea6efb2a0b1b99f41ad8b103eff4b59/2026/01/22/first_solution.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 2: AI Search First Solution\" width=\"798\" height=\"363\"> Figure 2: AI Search First Solution</p><h2><strong>Improving the solution by adding a custom generative AI evaluation framework</strong></h2><p>To address the challenges of measuring and improving agent accuracy, the team implemented a generative AI evaluation framework integrated into the existing architecture, shown in the following figure. This framework consists of four key components that work together to provide comprehensive performance insights and enable data-driven improvements.</p><p>Figure 3: Introducing the GenAI Evaluation Framework</p><ol><li>A curated golden dataset containing over 300 representative queries, each paired with its corresponding expected output, forms the foundation of automated evaluation. The product and data science teams carefully developed and validated this dataset to achieve comprehensive coverage of real-world use cases and edge cases. Additionally, there is a continuous curation process of adding representative actual user queries with validated results.</li><li>&nbsp;The evaluator component processes user input queries and compares the agent-generated output against the golden dataset using the <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/llm-as-a-judge-on-amazon-bedrock-model-evaluation/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">LLM as a judge pattern</a> This approach generates core accuracy metrics while capturing detailed logs and performance data, such as latency, for further analysis and debugging.</li><li>:&nbsp;Domain categories are developed using a combination of generative AI domain summarization and human-defined regular expressions to effectively categorize user queries. The evaluator determines the domain category for each query, enabling nuanced, category-based evaluation as an additional dimension of evaluation metrics.</li><li><strong>Generative AI evaluation dashboard:</strong>&nbsp;The dashboard serves as the mission control for Pushpay’s product and engineering teams, displaying domain category-level metrics to assess performance and latency and guide decisions. It shifts the team from single aggregate scores to nuanced, domain-based performance insights.</li></ol><p><strong>The accuracy dashboard: Pinpointing weaknesses by domain</strong></p><p>Because user queries are categorized into domain categories, the dashboard incorporates statistical confidence visualization using a 95% <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binomial_proportion_confidence_interval#Wilson_score_interval\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Wilson score interval</a> to display accuracy metrics and query volumes at each domain level. By using categories, the team can pinpoint the AI agent’s weaknesses by domain. In the following example , the “activity” domain shows significantly lower accuracy than other categories.</p><p>Figure 4: Pinpointing Agent Weaknesses by Domain</p><p>Additionally, a performance dashboard, shown in the following figure, visualizes latency indicators at the domain category level, including latency distributions from p50 to p90 percentiles. In the following example, the activity domain exhibits notably higher latency than others.</p><p>Figure 5:&nbsp;Identifying Latency Bottlenecks by Domain</p><p><strong>Strategic rollout through domain-Level insights</strong></p><p>Domain-based metrics revealed varying performance levels across semantic domains, providing crucial insights into agent effectiveness. Pushpay used this granular visibility to make strategic feature rollout decisions. By temporarily suppressing underperforming categories—such as activity queries—while undergoing optimization, the system achieved 95% overall accuracy. By using this approach, users experienced only the highest-performing features while the team refined others to production standards.</p><p>Figure 6:&nbsp;Achieving 95% Accuracy with Domain-Level Feature Rollout</p><p><strong>Strategic prioritization: Focusing on high-impact domains</strong></p><p>To prioritize improvements systematically, Pushpay employed a 2×2 matrix framework plotting topics against two dimensions (shown in the following figure): Business priority (vertical axis) and current performance or feasibility (horizontal axis). This visualization placed topics with both high business value and strong existing performance in the top-right quadrant. The team then focused on these areas because they required less heavy lifting to achieve further accuracy improvement from already-good levels to an exceptional 95% accuracy for the business focused topics.</p><p>The implementation followed an iterative cycle: after each round of enhancements, they re-analyze the results to identify the next set of high-potential topics. This systematic, cyclical approach enabled continuous optimization while maintaining focus on business-critical areas.</p><p>Figure 7:&nbsp;Strategic Prioritization Framework for Domain Category Optimization</p><p><strong>Dynamic prompt construction</strong></p><p>The insights gained from the evaluation framework led to an architectural enhancement: the introduction of a dynamic prompt constructor. This component enabled rapid iterative improvements by allowing fine-grained control over which domain categories the agent could address. The structured field inventory – previously embedded in the system prompt – was transformed into a dynamic element, using semantic search to construct contextually relevant prompts for each user query. This approach tailors the prompt filter inventory based on three key contextual dimensions: query content, user persona, and tenant-specific requirements. The result is a more precise and efficient system that generates highly relevant responses while maintaining the flexibility needed for continuous optimization.</p><p>The generative AI evaluation framework became the cornerstone of Pushpay’s AI feature development, delivering measurable value across three dimensions:</p><ul><li>:&nbsp;The AI search feature reduced time-to-insight from approximately 120 seconds (experienced users manually navigating complex UX) to under 4 seconds – a 15-fold acceleration that directly helps enhance ministry leaders’ productivity and decision-making speed. This feature democratized data insights, so that users of different technical levels can access meaningful intelligence without requiring specialized expertise.</li><li>: The scientific evaluation approach transformed optimization cycles. Rather than debating prompt modifications, the team now validates changes and measures domain-specific impacts within minutes, replacing prolonged deliberations with data-driven iteration.</li><li>:&nbsp;Improvements from 60–70% accuracy to more than 95% accuracy using high-performance domains provided the quantitative confidence required for customer-facing deployment, while the framework’s architecture enables continuous refinement across other domain categories.</li></ul><h2><strong>Key takeaways for your AI agent journey</strong></h2><p>The following are key takeaways from Pushpay’s experience that you can use in your own AI agent journey.</p><p><strong>1/ Build with production in mind from day one</strong></p><p>Building agentic AI systems is straightforward, but scaling them to production is challenging. Developers should adopt a scaling mindset during the proof-of-concept phase, not after. Implementing robust tracing and evaluation frameworks early, provides a clear pathway from experimentation to production. By using this method, teams can identify and address accuracy issues systematically before they become blockers.</p><p><strong>2/ Take advantage of the advanced features of Amazon Bedrock</strong></p><p>Amazon Bedrock prompt caching significantly reduces token costs and latency by caching frequently used system prompts. For agents with large, stable system prompts, this feature is essential for production-grade performance.</p><p><strong>3/ Think beyond aggregate metrics</strong></p><p>Aggregate accuracy scores can sometimes mask critical performance variations. By evaluating agent performance at the domain category level, Pushpay uncovered weaknesses beyond what a single accuracy metric can capture.

As a developer who thrives on squeezing every drop of performance and architectural elegance out of my code, the recent cadence of Go releases has been nothing short of exhilarating. We're not just getting incremental fixes; we're seeing foundational shifts and mature refinements that are genuinely reshaping how we build robust, high-performance systems. Forget the marketing fluff; let's dive deep into the technical trenches and examine what Go 1.21, 1.22, and the foundational elements of 1.23 bring to the table. I've been running these versions through their paces, and the practical implications are significant.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Generics: The Journey from Novelty to Necessity (Go 1.21 &amp; 1.22)\n</h2><p>Two years into their official release with Go 1.18, generics are no longer a \"new\" feature but a rapidly maturing cornerstone of the language. Go 1.21 and 1.22 have brought crucial enhancements, particularly around type inference and the standard library's embrace of generic patterns, making them significantly more ergonomic and powerful. This is genuinely impressive because the initial generic implementation, while functional, sometimes felt a little verbose. While Go focuses on runtime efficiency, other ecosystems are seeing similar shifts; for instance, <a href=\"https://dev.to/blog/rust-js-tooling-2025-why-biome-oxc-and-rolldown-change-everything-31o\">Rust JS Tooling 2025</a> shows how performance-first languages are taking over the frontend toolchain.</p><p>Go 1.21 delivered a substantial leap in the power and precision of type inference. The compiler can now infer type arguments for generic functions even when those arguments are themselves generic functions, or when generic functions are assigned to variables or returned as results. This means less explicit type instantiation, leading to cleaner, more idiomatic generic code. For instance, when working with the new  or  packages, the compiler often deduces the types you intend, reducing boilerplate.</p><p>Consider the  package, a standout addition in Go 1.21. It offers a suite of common operations like , , , and , all generic. Before, you'd either write custom loops or use  with runtime type assertions, sacrificing type safety or clarity. Now, these operations are both type-safe and efficient.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>The , , and  built-in functions introduced in Go 1.21 are also a welcome quality-of-life improvement, especially  for maps and slices, eliminating common boilerplate loops for resetting data structures. While seemingly minor, these additions streamline everyday coding patterns significantly. The  package in Go 1.22 further embraces generics with a new  function, allowing random number generation for any integer type.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Expert Insight: The Generics Performance Frontier\n</h3><p>While generics bring undeniable expressiveness and type safety, a common question I get is about their performance overhead. My observation, backed by community benchmarks, is that the Go compiler's instantiation model is remarkably efficient. For types that fit the \"shape\" of a generic function (e.g., all  types, all  types), the compiler often generates a single, optimized code instance. However, for types that require unique code generation (e.g., struct types with different memory layouts), it might generate separate instances, leading to increased binary size. The  constraint, while flexible, can sometimes prevent the most aggressive optimizations, pushing more work to runtime interface calls. My prediction is that future compiler work will focus on even smarter specialization heuristics, potentially leveraging PGO data to identify hot generic code paths that warrant dedicated, optimized implementations, even for distinct type instantiations. Developers should be mindful of the  constraint and use more specific type parameters (, , or custom interfaces) when possible to give the compiler more opportunities for optimization.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Profile-Guided Optimization (PGO): Unlocking Latent Performance (Go 1.21 &amp; 1.22)\n</h2><p>This is where things get truly exciting for performance enthusiasts. Profile-Guided Optimization (PGO), introduced as a preview in Go 1.20 and made generally available in Go 1.21, has matured into a robust, practical tool for significant performance gains. Go 1.22 further refines it, delivering even greater benefits.</p><p>PGO fundamentally shifts the optimization strategy. Instead of relying purely on static analysis, the compiler now uses runtime profiles collected from actual workloads to make informed optimization decisions. This is not magic, but a pragmatic approach: your program runs, it generates a profile of its \"hot\" code paths, and then the compiler uses that profile to rebuild a more efficient binary.</p><p>The workflow is straightforward:</p><ol><li><strong>Build an initial binary (without PGO):</strong> This is your baseline, often from a recent production build.</li><li><strong>Collect profiles from production/representative workloads:</strong> Use  or  to gather CPU profiles. The key here is ; a profile from a trivial test might not yield optimal results for a complex production system.</li><li> Save the collected CPU profile as  in your main package's directory.</li><li> The  command, starting with Go 1.21, will automatically detect  and enable PGO if you use  (which is the default behavior if a  file is present).</li></ol><p>The impact is substantial. Go 1.21 saw programs from a representative set achieve 2-7% performance improvements. Go 1.22 pushed this further, with gains ranging from 2-14%. These improvements stem from PGO's ability to:</p><ul><li><strong>Devirtualize interface method calls:</strong> The compiler can replace dynamic interface dispatches with direct, static calls to the most common concrete type methods, enabling further optimizations like inlining.</li><li><strong>More aggressive inlining:</strong> Functions identified as \"hot\" in the profile are more aggressively inlined, reducing function call overhead. Go 1.22 even introduced a preview () of an enhanced inliner that uses heuristics to boost inlinability at \"important\" call sites (e.g., within loops) and discourage it in less critical areas (e.g., panic paths).</li></ul><p>The compiler itself benefits; Go 1.21 saw build speeds improve by up to 6% because the compiler was built with PGO. This is a sturdy, practical performance boost that requires minimal effort for significant returns.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Concurrency Reinvented: Loop Variables and Enhanced Tracing (Go 1.22)\n</h2><p>Concurrency is Go's bread and butter, and Go 1.22 delivered a truly significant, long-awaited language change that impacts concurrent programming directly: the resolution of the \"for loop variable capture\" issue. I've been waiting for this, and it's a huge win for preventing subtle but pervasive bugs.</p><p>Previously, variables declared by a  loop were created once and updated by each iteration. This meant that goroutines launched within a loop, if they captured the loop variable directly, would often all end up referencing the  value of the variable after the loop completed, leading to unexpected and hard-to-debug behavior.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>This change in Go 1.22 ensures that each iteration of a  loop creates new variables, fundamentally eliminating this common source of bugs in concurrent scenarios. While a  setting can revert to the old behavior for compatibility, the new default is a significant step forward for writing safer concurrent code.</p><p>Beyond this, Go 1.22 also brought a complete overhaul of the execution tracer. The new tracer uses the operating system's clock on most platforms (excluding Windows), allowing for better correlation with external system traces. It's more efficient, with substantially reduced CPU costs for trace collection, and produces streamable, partitioned traces. The  package also received updates, with new histogram metrics providing more granular details about stop-the-world pauses (<code>/sched/pauses/stopping/gc:seconds</code>, <code>/sched/pauses/total/gc:seconds</code>, etc.) and mutex profiles now scaling contention by the number of goroutines blocked, giving a much more accurate picture of bottlenecks. This is invaluable for pinpointing and addressing performance hot spots in highly concurrent applications.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Standard Library and Runtime Power-Ups (Go 1.21 &amp; 1.22)\n</h2><p>The standard library continues to evolve, with Go 1.21 and 1.22 bringing a slew of practical additions and performance tweaks that enhance developer productivity and application efficiency.</p><p>Go 1.21 introduced the much-anticipated  package for structured logging. This is a significant improvement over the basic  package, providing a standardized, performant way to emit key-value pairs, which is critical for modern observability and log analysis tools. When working with structured logs in , you might find yourself dealing with complex outputs; you can use this <a href=\"https://dev.to/utilities/code-formatter\">JSON Formatter</a> to verify your structure and ensure your logs are parseable. The  package supports different log levels and handlers, allowing for flexible integration into various logging infrastructures.</p><p>The  package, a cornerstone of Go concurrency, saw new functions in Go 1.21:  and . These allow you to specify a \"cause\" for context cancellation when a deadline or timer expires, which can then be retrieved with the  function. This adds valuable debugging context for complex cancellation flows. Additionally,  registers a function to run  a context has been canceled, providing a clean way to perform cleanup or reactive tasks. The  package also gained , , and  in Go 1.21, simplifying patterns for lazy initialization.</p><p>Go 1.22's  received a substantial upgrade, now supporting enhanced routing patterns with HTTP methods and wildcards. This means you can define routes like  or , making the standard library's router much more capable for building RESTful APIs without needing external frameworks. The  method allows easy access to the wildcard values. This is a welcome change for simplifying API design directly within the standard library.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Other notable improvements include  for easy slice concatenation and the zeroing of elements between the new and old length when shrinking slices. The  package types (base32, base64, hex) gained  and  methods, streamlining buffer management. On Windows,  now batches directory entries, improving performance by up to 30%, and  can leverage  and  on Linux where applicable, reducing data copies.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Memory Management and GC Evolution (Go 1.21 &amp; 1.22)\n</h2><p>The Go garbage collector (GC) is a silent workhorse, and recent releases have continued to refine its efficiency and predictability. The ongoing goal is to minimize pause times and memory overhead, allowing Go applications to run smoothly even under heavy load.</p><p>Go 1.21 brought several runtime improvements to memory management. On Linux, the runtime now manages transparent huge pages more explicitly, leading to better memory utilization. Small heaps might see less memory used (up to 50% in pathological cases), while large heaps could experience improved CPU usage and latency due to fewer broken huge pages. Crucially, Go 1.21's runtime-internal GC tuning resulted in up to a 40% reduction in application tail latency for some applications. While some might observe a small loss in throughput, this trade-off is often acceptable for latency-sensitive services, and can be adjusted with  or .</p><p>Go 1.22 continued this trend by keeping type-based garbage collection metadata nearer to each heap object. This seemingly minor change yields tangible benefits: CPU performance (latency or throughput) improves by 1-3%, and memory overhead is reduced by approximately 1% due to deduplicating redundant metadata. While this does mean some objects might shift alignment from 16-byte to 8-byte boundaries, potentially affecting rare assembly-optimized code, the overall benefit for the vast majority of Go programs is a more efficient runtime.</p><p>The  environment variable, while not new to these specific versions, continues to be a powerful tool for controlling memory usage. It allows developers to specify a soft memory limit for the Go heap, enabling the GC to be more aggressive when approaching this limit. This is particularly useful in containerized environments where memory is a constrained resource, preventing OOM kills by giving the GC a clear target.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Toolchain and Developer Experience (Go 1.21 &amp; 1.22)\n</h2><p>Beyond runtime and language features, the developer experience and toolchain are paramount. Go 1.21 and 1.22 have made important strides here, especially in compatibility and static analysis.</p><p>Go 1.21 formalized the use of the  environment variable for controlling behavioral changes, allowing programs to opt into older (or newer) behaviors based on the  line in  or . This means you can upgrade your Go toolchain to the latest version for security and performance benefits, while still ensuring your older modules behave as expected. It also made the  line a strict minimum requirement, providing clearer error messages when a project requires a newer Go version. The  command can now even invoke other Go toolchain versions found in your  or downloaded on demand, simplifying management of projects with diverse Go version requirements.</p><p>The  tool, our trusty static analyzer, received crucial updates in Go 1.22. It now correctly analyzes code with the new per-iteration  loop variables, no longer reporting false positives for loop variable capture within function literals. This is a testament to the toolchain keeping pace with language changes. Additionally,  now warns about  calls with no values (a common mistake), non-deferred  calls within  statements (another common subtle bug), and mismatched key-value pairs in  calls. These are practical, everyday improvements that help catch subtle errors before they hit runtime.</p><p>Finally,  in Go 1.22 provides a cleaner, type-safe way to obtain a  value for a given type , replacing the slightly awkward <code>reflect.TypeOf((*T)(nil)).Elem()</code> pattern. This is a small but welcome ergonomic improvement for those working with reflection.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Reality Check: The Unpolished Edges (Go 1.23 and beyond)\n</h2><p>While the recent Go updates are a triumph of practical engineering, it's essential to maintain a \"reality check.\" Not everything is perfectly polished, and some areas are still works in progress.</p><p><strong>Generics, while powerful, still have their limitations.</strong> As noted by community discussions, Go's generics design, while solid, doesn't solve  problems. For instance, you can't currently have a type constraint that expresses a union of arbitrary types  a method set (e.g., \"either  or has a  method\"). You have to pick one. This can lead to some awkward workarounds or force a return to  in complex scenarios. Furthermore, while tooling is improving, some older linters and static analysis tools might still struggle with heavily generic code, occasionally producing inaccurate warnings or failing to understand type flows. Stack traces from panics in generic code can also sometimes be harder to decipher than those from non-generic code, though this is an area of ongoing improvement.</p><p><strong>Upgrades, while generally smooth, are not entirely \"free.\"</strong> As an article discussing Go 1.23 migration highlighted, even with Go's strong compatibility guarantees, minor version upgrades can introduce \"unexpected performance regressions or subtle behavioral changes\" that might not be caught in basic testing. The language stays compatible, but the runtime, compiler, and standard library implementations shift underneath, potentially affecting performance characteristics or uncovering latent bugs in existing code. This underscores the importance of thorough benchmarking and testing, especially for performance-critical components, after  Go upgrade.</p><p><strong>Experimental features, while exciting, are still experimental.</strong> Features like  for advanced inlining heuristics or  for range-over-function iterators (a preview in Go 1.22) are powerful glimpses into the future. However, they come with the implicit warning that their behavior, API, or even existence might change in subsequent releases. Relying on them in production without careful consideration and mitigation strategies is a risk.</p><p>Go 1.23, based on available information, seems to be a version focused more on internal optimizations and bug fixes, laying groundwork for future major features. While this might seem less glamorous, these foundational improvements are crucial for long-term stability and continued performance gains, especially in areas like the runtime and garbage collector.</p><p>The recent Go releases, particularly 1.21 and 1.22, demonstrate a language and ecosystem in a state of robust, thoughtful evolution. Generics have matured into a practical, powerful tool, enhanced by significant type inference improvements and their integration into the standard library. Profile-Guided Optimization is a game-changer for real-world performance, offering tangible speedups with minimal effort. And the resolution of the  loop variable capture bug in Go 1.22 is a monumental win for concurrent programming safety.</p><p>As Go developers, we're navigating a landscape where the language is becoming more expressive, more performant, and safer by default. The journey isn't over, and there are always rough edges to smooth out, but the trajectory is undeniably positive. These aren't just features; they're practical, sturdy tools that empower us to build more efficient, reliable, and maintainable software. I'm genuinely excited to see what the next iterations bring, building on this incredibly strong foundation.</p><p><em>This article was published by the **DataFormatHub Editorial Team</em><em>, a group of developers and data enthusiasts dedicated to making data transformation accessible and private.

Often, the secret is acquiring a pre-existing channel. This shortcut transforms your digital journey from a slow crawl into a high-speed race. Let’s look at the specific advantages:</p><ol><li><p>Instant Audience \nThe hardest part of YouTube is getting those first 1,000 subscribers. When you buy a channel, that community is already there. You start with a “warm” audience rather than a cold start.</p></li><li><p>Enhanced Credibility \nSocial proof is everything. A channel with thousands of subscribers looks like an authority. New viewers are far more likely to click “Subscribe” if they see that others have already done so.</p></li><li><p>Monetization Opportunities \nGetting approved for the YouTube Partner Program requires 4,000 watch hours and 1,000 subscribers. Purchasing an established channel can put you on the fast track to earning ad revenue from day one.</p></li><li><p>Algorithm Advantage \nThe YouTube algorithm likes history. An older, active channel is often treated better by the recommendation engine than a brand-new account with no data.</p></li><li><p>Content Testing \nWith an existing audience, you get immediate data. You can A/B test different video styles and get feedback in hours instead of weeks, allowing you to pivot your strategy with precision.</p></li><li><p>Networking and Collaborations \nBig creators rarely collaborate with “zero-sub” channels. An established subscriber count acts as your resume, opening doors to partnerships and sponsorships that would otherwise be closed.</p></li><li><p>Time and Effort Savings \nTime is your most valuable asset. By skipping the grind of the first 12 months of channel growth, you can dedicate your energy to high-quality production and business scaling.</p></li></ol><p>Is Buying a YouTube Channel Legal?\nLegally speaking, there are no laws prohibiting the sale of a social media account. However, it is important to be transparent: this practice often goes against YouTube’s specific Terms of Service regarding account transfers.

We recommend keeping records of your purchase for your accounting.</p><p>Privacy And Data Security\nWe ensure that all previous owner data is wiped and that you have a “clean slate” to start your brand.</p><p>Contractual Obligations\nOur terms of service act as a clear agreement, protecting both the buyer and the seller during the hand-over.</p><p>Customizing Your New Channel\nOnce you have the keys, it’s time to make it yours.

What would a user type to find your video?</p><p>Leverage Playlists\nEncourage “binge-watching” by grouping your best videos together.</p><p>Host Live Sessions\nLive streaming builds a level of trust and “realness” that pre-recorded videos can’t match.</p><p>Managing Audience Expectations\nWhen you take over a channel, the audience might be surprised.

For millions of consumers, choosing the right wine can be overwhelming: should they pay more for a reputed brand, or are there hidden gems that offer great quality at an affordable price?</p><p>In the digital age, online wine marketplaces like Vivino provide access to extensive wine data, including ratings, reviews, prices, and origins. Leveraging this data with data science techniques can help both businesses and consumers make smarter decisions.</p><p>In this project, we aim to explore the wine market using a dataset of over 12,000 wines across red, white, and rose varieties. Specifically, we focus on the relationship between price and quality, identify value-for-money wines, and analyze how features like wine type, country, and vintage influence ratings.</p><p>Through data cleaning, exploratory analysis, and predictive modeling, this project demonstrates how data science can transform raw wine data into actionable insights for businesses, helping them recommend wines effectively and optimize pricing strategies.</p><p>To get a complete view of the wine market, we combined three separate datasets for red, white, and rose wines into a single, unified dataset. Each entry includes essential information about the wine, such as its name, country of origin, region, winery, rating, number of reviews, price, vintage year, and type, providing a rich foundation for analysis and insights.</p><p>Before diving into the analysis, we carefully prepared the dataset to ensure its quality. Numeric columns like Rating, Price, and Year were correctly formatted, while categorical columns such as Type and Country were standardized. Missing or invalid values were addressed, duplicates were removed, and outliers—especially in the Price column, where a few luxury wines created a skewed distribution—were carefully handled to ensure a clean and reliable dataset for exploration.</p><p>This tells us how wines are rated overall.</p><p>The analysis shows that most wines receive relatively high ratings, with a median of 3.9, indicating overall good quality. Very few wines are poorly rated, as reflected by the minimum rating of 2.5. Overall, ratings are concentrated between 3.7 and 4.1, demonstrating a consistent level of high quality with low variability across the dataset.</p><p>Since price is right-skewed, it’s better to plot log scale as well.</p><p>The majority of wines are affordable, with a median price of approximately $16. A small number of very expensive wines create a right-skewed distribution, stretching the upper end of the price range while most wines remain in the accessible price segment.</p><p>Are expensive wines really higher rated?\nDo cheap wines also have high ratings?</p><p>Optional: Add correlation coefficient:</p><p>Examining the relationship between price and rating revealed a moderate correlation of 0.44, suggesting that while higher-priced wines tend to have slightly higher ratings, price alone does not guarantee quality.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Average Rating by Wine Type\n</h2><p>By comparing red, white, and rose wines, we can identify which type tends to receive higher ratings. The analysis shows that red wines have slightly higher average ratings than both white and rose varieties, suggesting a small but consistent preference for reds among consumers.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Top Countries by Average Rating\n</h2><p>The graph shows: Moldova, Lebanon, and Croatia at the top, it means wines from these countries have the highest average ratings in our dataset.\nBefore trusting this result, we must check how many wines come from these countries : </p><p>-If a country has only &lt; 20  wines → average is unreliable\n-If it has 200 wines → very reliable<p>\nThis is called sample size bias.</p></p><p>Although Moldova, Lebanon, and Croatia show high average ratings, their limited sample sizes suggest that these results should be interpreted with caution.</p><p>Although Moldova, Lebanon, and Croatia display the highest average ratings, each country is represented by fewer than 20 wines in the dataset. As a result, these averages are likely influenced by small sample bias and should be interpreted with caution. To ensure reliable conclusions, we focused our analysis on countries with a sufficient number of observations</p><p>This graph illustrates the evolution of the average wine rating over time by showing how ratings vary across different vintage years. It helps to evaluate whether the vintage has a significant influence on perceived quality. If an upward trend is observed, it suggests that newer wines tend to receive higher ratings, possibly due to improvements in production techniques or changing consumer preferences. Conversely, fluctuations or stable patterns indicate that vintage alone is not sufficient to determine quality. Overall, this analysis highlights the role of the production year as a secondary factor in wine evaluation, complementing other important variables such as price and origin.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Best Value for Money Wines\n</h2><p>This part identifies the best value-for-money wines in the dataset by selecting bottles that combine high quality with affordable prices.</p><p>More specifically, it filters the data to keep only wines that have a rating of at least 4.3 (highly appreciated by users) and a price of 20 or less (considered relatively inexpensive). It then sorts these wines by rating in descending order and displays the top 10 highest-rated affordable wines.</p><p>This analysis highlights wines that offer an excellent quality–price ratio, which can be used to support recommendations, help users discover hidden gems, and guide business strategies focused on promoting high-value products.</p><p>The analysis reveals that most wines have ratings concentrated around 4, indicating generally good quality. Wine prices show a right-skewed distribution, with the majority being affordable and a few luxury wines driving up the high end. While there is a moderate correlation between price and rating, a higher price does not always guarantee better quality. Red wines tend to slightly outperform white and rose varieties, and certain countries consistently produce higher-rated wines. Vintage year appears to have only a minor effect on ratings. Finally, several value-for-money wines stand out, providing actionable insights for recommendations and business strategy.</p><p>For our predictive modeling, the target variable is the wine Rating, which represents the score given by users. The features used to predict this rating include Price, Vintage Year, Country of Origin, and Type of wine (red, white, or rose). These variables capture both the economic and qualitative aspects of the wine, allowing the model to learn patterns that influence user preferences and perceived quality.</p><p>To prepare the data for modeling, we first split it into training and testing sets using an 80/20 ratio, ensuring the model can be evaluated on unseen data. The numerical features (Price and Year) were standardized using a scaler, while categorical features (Country and Type) were encoded with one-hot encoding to convert them into a machine-readable format. These preprocessing steps were combined into a ColumnTransformer pipeline, which ensures that all data is properly transformed before being fed into the predictive model.</p><p>The Random Forest model achieved a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 0.161, indicating that on average, the predicted wine ratings deviate by approximately 0.16 points from the actual ratings on the rating scale. The R² score of 0.511 shows that the model explains about 51% of the variance in wine ratings. This suggests that while the model captures a significant portion of the factors influencing ratings—particularly price and vintage year—there remains some variability that is not accounted for, likely due to other qualitative factors such as taste preferences, winery reputation, or unobserved characteristics. Overall, the model provides a reasonable predictive performance for guiding value-based wine recommendations and pricing strategies.</p><p>Accurate Rating Predictions: The model can estimate a wine’s rating based on its price, country, type, and vintage year. This is useful for recommending wines that users are likely to enjoy, even when a wine has few existing reviews.</p><p>Price-Quality Relationship: While price does influence the rating to some extent, the model demonstrates that other factors—such as country, type, and year—also play a significant role in predicting quality.</p><p>Business Impact: Vivino can leverage this model to highlight “value-for-money” wines, identify underrated wines, and optimize strategic pricing to better guide consumers.</p><p>To make this report even more insightful, we can examine which variables have the greatest influence on wine ratings. By analyzing feature importance from the trained Random Forest model, we can identify the key drivers behind the predictions and better understand how factors like price, country, type, and vintage year contribute to perceived wine quality.</p><p>A horizontal bar plot with:</p><p>Y-axis → feature names (Price, Year, Country_…, etc.)</p><p>X-axis → importance values (ranging from 0 to 1)</p><p>The Price feature should visually dominate the chart.</p><p>This produces a clear and easily readable graph, eliminating the need for a table.</p><p>Price is the dominant factor, accounting for approximately 78% of the variation in wine ratings. As expected, higher-priced wines tend to receive slightly higher ratings, though this is not always guaranteed. Vintage year is the second most important factor, contributing around 7.6% to the rating prediction. Both older and more recent vintages can subtly influence perceived quality. In contrast, the impact of country of origin and wine type (red or white) is relatively minor, each contributing roughly 1% individually. This confirms that price and year are the primary drivers of wine ratings, while categorical features such as country and type can still help fine-tune recommendations. From a business perspective, Vivino can leverage these insights to highlight wines that offer the best value for money, enabling the platform to recommend wines based on perceived quality rather than relying solely on raw ratings.</p><p>This project successfully explored the relationship between wine price, quality, and origin using data science techniques. By combining data cleaning, exploratory analysis, and predictive modeling, we were able to identify the key factors that influence wine ratings.</p><p>The Random Forest model demonstrated that price and vintage year are the strongest predictors of wine quality, while country of origin and type play a smaller but meaningful role. The model’s performance, with an MAE of 0.16 and R² of 0.51, shows it can reasonably predict wine ratings, providing valuable guidance for wine recommendations.</p><p>From a business perspective, these insights empower Vivino to highlight value-for-money wines, identify underrated wines, and optimize pricing strategies, ultimately enhancing customer satisfaction.</p><p>Overall, this project illustrates how leveraging large wine datasets and machine learning can transform raw data into actionable insights, supporting smarter decisions for both businesses and consumers. Future work could incorporate additional features, such as tasting notes, winery reputation, or user reviews, to further improve the predictive performance and recommendation quality.</p>","contentLength":11533,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"🧠

A share of individuals and companies may take a shortcut. That’s why they prefer to buy LinkedIn accounts for networking or marketing purposes. This approach implies substantial trade-offs between speed and security. The market for such accounts is murky and largely unregulated. Potential buyers have a landscape to cross that is strewn with opportunity and risk.</p>\nThis analysis is particularly relevant to the market of buying LinkedIn accounts. We examine the reasons and risks involved with this request. We also provide an objective review of service providers. We seek to provide a complete picture for informed decision-making. Knowledge about this practice is vital. Publications like this help keep practitioners out of trouble while also steering them clear of hit-or-miss stumblings into unexamined terrain. The information contained is the result of market research.<p>\nLooking forward to hiring LinkedIn Profiles</p>\nWhy buy LinkedIn account services now? The reasons behind buying LinkedIn account services are even more specific. Lead gen or sales outreach cos are typically the driver of this demand. They need points of exposure. Older accounts get around the new account restrictions on LinkedIn. ¡¨ These limitations mean that I’m restricted in the number of invitations and messages I can send. The demand gives rise to a supply of different types of accounts. The seller could be an individual or an impersonal digital marketing entity.<p>\nNew accounts have instant activity constraints. This slows down the work of business development. An old account looks more credible. It includes the form, more connections, and some historical activities. This perceived actuality contributes to the acceptance of messages. Large-scale marketers also buy accounts to enhance their efficiency at the top of the market. They control numerous profiles and large campaigns. This approach is designed to pump volume for outreach and lead gen.</p>\nComparison of US Service Providers<p>\nMany US websites provide the service. Their products differ in age, connections, performance characteristics, and features. The following table provides an overall glimpse of the frequent specifications in the best platforms. Discreet online storefronts frequently facilitate services from these providers. They also organize accounts by age and network strength. The buyers may choose such profiles for the ad campaignsö according to their campaign needs.</p>\nProvider Feature    Account Age (Months)    Connection Range    Common Inclusions<p>\nBasic Account   1-6 0-50    Profile setup, basic info</p>\nEstablished Account 7-24    51-500  Some endorsements, past posts<p>\nPremium Account 25+ 501+    Recommendations, full activity history</p>\nThere’s a wide variation in service levels from providers. A few even lock down their accounts for a specific time period. Others don’t provide any guarantee once the sale is made. Payment methods also vary. They often accept PayPal, cryptocurrency, and credit cards. The crypto adds an anonymous layer for both the buyer and seller. This complicates the transaction process even further.<p>\nPrimary Motivations for Account Acquisition</p>\nBusinesses give several reasons for buying pre-made accounts. The number one reason given is faster deployment. It would take a lot of time to organically build your network. Account on sale supplies you with instantaneous access to a network. This is especially important for near-term marketing. So the salespeople need weapons at hand to go for a more comprehensive program. They cannot wait months for an account to grow ripe.<p>\nB2B salespeople target these accounts for cold outreach. If you have an aged profile, the acceptance rate will be higher. By doing this, it raises the chance of lead conversion. They are also employed by some social media management agencies. From a single platform, they handle various client profiles. This makes social selling strategies scalable. It even differentiates the personal and professional relationship-building tasks.</p>\nOvercoming Initial Platform Barriers<p>\nLinkedIn has algorithms that are tasked with keeping a close eye on new account behavior. No need to rush, as a sudden spike of requests may cause throttling. The older the account, the higher the trust it has. They let you get more aggressive in your networking. This is relevant for anyone in sales. Their KPIs are built around reaching out in high volume. New users will have daily invitation and message limits.</p>\nEstablished accounts have fewer restrictions. This allows for proactive, rather than reactive, engagement strategies. Companies market leverage this to do concurrent campaigns. They manage a bunch of accounts directed toward various industries. It’s a strategy that allows them to spread out the way they are generating leads. This also decreases the chance of a single account getting banned. These use cases are scrutinized by the Pvaseshop team daily.</p><p>Significant Risks and Potential Consequences\nYou cannot buy an account according to LinkedIn’s User Agreement. This also applies to section 8.2 Selling or transferring access is strictly forbidden. The service uses advanced detection mechanisms. These compare behavior, login locations and device fingerprints. Permanent suspension due to erratic activity is also a typical result. If you lose an account, you’ve lost all that effort and connection.<p>\nThat is not a compliment; that means I wouldn’t trust us with their data, and I certainly would never trust your data. The owner of the original account may still have recovery data on file. After you have put time into the account, they might try to take it back. The history of the account might even involve unknown transgressions. This presents a risk to the new owner. The original owner may have been a spammer. It could permanently sully the Profile’s reputation.</p>\nSecurity and Legal Implications<p>\nThere are risks of using a paid account. You have no record of the past activities of this Profile. Someone could have used it for spam or scams. It tarnishes your professional reputation by association. Others also have negative implications under the realm of false pretense. Using a fictitious identity on an account for business purposes could hold legal liabilities.</p>\nIt May Violate Truthful Advertising Laws And Commercial Practices. The PVASEOSHOP blog offers detailed posts about digital compliance. We recommend these resources before you decide. Misrepresentation can open them up to legal action from clients or business partners. It’s not conducive to trust in professional relationships. The long-term brand damage may be anything but worth it.<p>\nFinancial and Operational Risks</p>\nThere is a direct financial loss in a banned account. You lose the price you paid for it and any associated assets. There can be an even greater cost: operational disruption. Marketing campaigns come to a screeching halt. Sales pipelines that relied on that account become useless. If you ever get banned, they ban absolutely everything. It has affected business earnings. These loss of momentum, i.e., business revenue, also leads to crime..<p>\nIt’s an awful lot of time and effort to rebuild a network. And the actual costs of such ads are usually more than the original purchase price. Most businesses overlook these potential losses. They see only the short-term advantages. An intelligent risk assessment is necessary. At Pvaseoshop, this assessment is mandatory for all of our digital products.</p>\nEvaluating Service Provider Credibility<p>\nNote that not all companies in the segment have this capability at this level. Others employ automated bots to form complex networks of fake profiles. These are detected and banned quickly. Others employ manual creation methods. Such accounts generally do (last longer). Key signs of a trusted provider are no-nonsense replacement guarantees. They must provide transparent policies concerning account sourcing.</p>\nFind platforms that provide excellent customer support. Transparent disclosure of account sourcing is also crucial. Clear terms of service are essential. Pvaseoshop recommends thorough due diligence. And always look for verified/unbiased user ratings and reviews. Steer clear of providers without a web presence beyond a sales page.<p>\nAccount Specifications and Feature Analysis</p>\nThe usefulness of the account depends on the feature set bundled with it. Basic accounts don’t offer much beyond a verified email. Premium accounts feature full work history and references. Below is a table detailing the majority of core attributes and their real-world values. This analysis aids customers in comparing sourcing options.<p>\nAccount Feature Practical Utility   Longevity Factor</p>\nProfile Photo &amp; Banner  Increases profile view credibility  Low<p>\nWork History &amp; Education    Adds depth and context to the profile   Medium</p>\nSkill Endorsements  Provides social proof of capabilities   High<p>\nWritten Recommendations Significantly boosts profile authority  High</p>\nPrevious Content Posts  Shows a history of engagement   Medium<p>\nFollower Count  Indicates influence and reach   High</p>\nAll the details make the account as a whole more believable. Accounts that get recommended and endorsed do better. They sound and look more natural to both machines and people. These improvements are not the result of any sourcing. “Stylish” (non-organic) characteristics have a longer life than “artificially induced” ones.<p>\nBest Practices for the Safe Handling of Procured Accounts</p>\nIf you decide to make a purchase, some strategies can minimize the risk. Change the password and email to that account asap, obviously. And update your recovery phone number and security questions. Simplify the modification of the Profile details over a few days. Don’t implement turnaround tactics in one go. Suddenly, complete overhauls appear suspicious.<p>\nMimic organic user behavior. Begin the process: Looking at each other’s profiles and consuming content. Ease into requesting connections and sending messages. Do not post links or promote anything. This timing method ensures the account looks natural to LinkedIn’s systems. It decreases the likelihood of flags and reviews made by bots.</p>\nMaintaining Account Longevity<p>\nHow long you will keep your account depends on regular, non-crazy activity. Log in from a single geographic location and device. Do not use VPNs or proxies that change your IP address often. Like and comment on your network’s content. Flag immunity is mainly achieved through regular, legitimate activity.</p>\nDevelop a consistent posting schedule. Share industry-relevant articles and insights. Join groups that pertain to the industry/area in which the Profile is located. This is in line with the legitimate users. It is a consistent history of the actions you perform. This keeps the account usable for quite a bit longer.<p>\nIntegration into Business Workflows</p>\nIntroduce the account gently into your business life. Don’t rely on it for the main face of your major client relationships. It’s more effective for initial outreach and lead generation. But you can still use it when scheduling meetings for one main account. This tiered method limits the damage to reputations.<p>\nTrain staff in the correct manner of use. Record any process in account management. Set communication style and frequency expectations. Keep an eye on your account stats to watch for any signs of something being off. Such organized management will limit operational risks. It also increases the ROI.</p>\nEthical Alternatives to Account Purchase<p>\nThe LinkedIn profile constructed from scratch is still the safest way. It creates an authentic professional narrative. And you can speed up the process with a targeted plan. Make good use of relevant keywords on your Profile. Engage consistently with industry-specific content. This creates a network for life.</p>\nThen, join and engage in the relevant LinkedIn groups. Leverage the built-in content tools and networking features that LinkedIn provides. Think about purchasing LinkedIn Sales Navigator for more sophisticated lead generation. These are the techniques that lead to a hardy, long-term professional network. They sharpen your actual professional skills and knowledge, too.<p>\nStrategic Organic Growth Methods</p>\nAn organic approach to strategic growth pays off. Publish useful stuff three times a week minimum. It sets you up as an authority and brings in followers. Jot a short note on all of your connection requests so that they aren’t generic. This dramatically improves acceptance rates. It’s a fabric of deep connections.<p>\nReach out to the influencers in your sector. Comment on their posts in a meaningful way to become more visible. Use LinkedIn Articles to show expertise. These strategies create an extensive network without policy infringement. The Pvaseoshop knowledge base provides organic growth strategies that work. These methods offer lasting value.</p>\nLeveraging LinkedIn’s Native Advertising<p>\nLinkedIn Ads for instantaneous professional outreach. They also provide highly targeted job titles, company size and industry. And direct your message with Sponsored Content and Message Ads. This approach doesn’t violate any platform TOS. It’s also scalable to your budget.</p>\nMarketing has proven ROI and so much analytics. You have access to key decision makers without the network limitations.

But it violates LinkedIn’s User Agreement. Such a violation may lead to the suspension of an account without appeal. The misrepresentation and its legal implications. The practice itself involves misrepresentation, which can be addressed legally.<p>\nHow much do these accounts generally range for?</p>\nPrices vary based on account age and the number of features. Basic accounts can run $30 to $60. Accounts with established profiles cost between $80 and $200. Recommended significantly aged accounts that can be over $300. Due to specialized targeting value, Niche Industry profiles frequently carry a premium cost.<p>\nCan LinkedIn tell if you purchased an account?</p>\nYes, LinkedIn has security measures in place to identify abnormal activity. Irregular login locations, abrupt modifications to profile sections, or repetitive non-organic development systems are often red flags that trigger a review, processing, and account suspension. Behavioral algorithms assess hundreds of data points for anomalies.<p>\nWhat if I get my bought account banned?</p>\nIn the event LinkedIn shuts down your account, you’re shut out for good. All relations, contents or data linked to that Profile will be destroyed. There is a limited replacement guarantee, but that does not restore lost time and network connectivity. Continued violations may result in hardware or IP bans.<p>\nWhat are some secure ways to purchase LinkedIn accounts?</p>\nThere is neither a totally safe nor approved way.

But some creators break this pattern.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/@coreyms\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"></a> produces the clearest Python tutorials on the platform. His explanations of Object-Oriented Programming, Django, and regular expressions beat many paid textbooks.</p><p>The catch? His videos lack built-in exercises. You need to create your own practice problems or risk falling into tutorial hell.</p><p>Avoid 6-12 hour \"Full Course\" videos unless you're ready to pause every five minutes and code along. Otherwise, you're just watching someone else solve problems.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  The Tools You'll Actually Need\n</h2><p>Your choice of IDE sparks religious debates in programmer circles. The 2025 consensus has settled on two options.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>PyCharm Community Edition</strong></a> works brilliantly out of the box. Powerful autocomplete catches errors before you run code. The introspection helps you understand type annotations and available methods through exploration rather than memorization. Beginners benefit from this immediate feedback.</p><p><a href=\"https://code.visualstudio.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"></a> requires more setup. You'll need to install Python and Jupyter extensions at minimum. But it offers flexibility across languages. For long-term career development, learning VS Code pays dividends when you inevitably need to work with JavaScript, HTML, or other technologies.</p><p><a href=\"https://jupyter.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"></a> inside VS Code transform the learning experience for data science paths. Line-by-line execution with instant visual output reduces debugging burnout. You see results immediately, which maintains motivation during difficult concepts.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Breaking Out of Tutorial Hell\n</h2><p>The biggest trap isn't picking the wrong resource.</p><p>Tutorial hell happens when you become a passive consumer, following along perfectly but unable to create anything independently. I spent two months in this trap with web development. Could follow any tutorial flawlessly. Couldn't build a contact form from scratch. Breaking out required three deliberate changes in approach.</p><p><strong>The Parallel Project Rule</strong></p><p>After completing a tutorial that builds a calculator, you build a unit converter. Similar concepts, different implementation. This forces you to apply knowledge rather than copy it. The struggle of adapting what you learned to a new context teaches more than any smooth tutorial walkthrough.</p><p>Got code working? Now change it until it breaks. See what error messages appear. Fix them without consulting the tutorial.</p><p>This builds debugging skills that no polished walkthrough can teach. After a week of deliberately breaking scripts, you'll read Python error messages like sentences instead of cryptic warnings.</p><p>Google, <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Stack Overflow</a>, and <a href=\"https://docs.python.org/3/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">official documentation</a> are separate skills to master. They're as important as Python syntax. Fighting with documentation for 30 minutes teaches you more than getting a quick answer from ChatGPT.</p><p>Good rule of thumb: struggle for at least 20 minutes before asking anyone for help.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  The AI Question Nobody Wants to Address\n</h2><p><a href=\"https://chat.openai.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">ChatGPT</a> and <a href=\"https://claude.ai/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Claude</a> have become standard tools in 2025. Use them right, and you'll learn syntax in weeks. Use them wrong, and you'll never learn at all.</p><p>How to use AI without crippling yourself:</p><ul><li>Ask it to explain cryptic error messages</li><li>Request progressive difficulty drills based on your current level</li><li>Have it generate custom exercises for weak areas</li><li>Never ask it to just write the solution</li></ul><p>The framework: Use AI for explanations, minimal debugging hints, and practice generation. Write the code yourself. Always.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  What Separates Success from Failure\n</h2><p>Here's what nobody wants to hear: grit matters more than your resource choice. The ability to sit with confusion, read error messages carefully, and keep trying after your code fails for the hundredth time. That's the skill.</p><p>People with expensive bootcamp degrees wash out because they quit when things get hard. High school dropouts become senior developers because they refuse to stop learning.</p><p>The best resources teach you how to think through problems, not just how to type syntax.</p>","contentLength":10505,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"From Connections to Meaning: Why Heterogeneous Graph Transformers (HGT) Change Demand Forecasting","url":"https://towardsdatascience.com/from-connections-to-meaning-why-heterogeneous-graph-transformers-hgt-change-demand-forecasting/","date":1769520600,"author":"Partha Sarkar","guid":423788,"unread":true,"content":"<p>How relationship-aware graphs turn connected forecasts into operational insight</p>","contentLength":79,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"📘 Build a Trace Grid Puzzle Book Generator in Python (with Live Preview + PDF Export)","url":"https://dev.to/matetechnologie/build-a-trace-grid-puzzle-book-generator-in-python-with-live-preview-pdf-export-8no","date":1769520503,"author":"Mate Technologies","guid":423772,"unread":true,"content":"<p>In this tutorial, we’ll build a desktop puzzle book generator using Python.</p><p>By the end, you’ll have an app that:</p><p>Generates grid-based tracing puzzles</p><p>Automatically builds a print-ready PDF</p><p>Supports multiple puzzles per page</p><p>Is ready for KDP / Etsy style publishing</p><p>If you’d rather jump straight to the finished code:</p><p>Let’s build it step by step.</p><p>Make sure you have Python 3.10+ installed.</p><p>pip install pillow svgwrite reportlab ttkbootstrap cairosvg</p><p>ttkbootstrap – modern UI theme</p><p>svgwrite – vector puzzle export</p><p>cairosvg – SVG → PNG for PDF embedding</p><p>🧱 Step 1 — Project Skeleton</p><div><pre><code>import sys, random\nfrom pathlib import Path\nimport tkinter as tk\nfrom tkinter import filedialog, messagebox\n\nfrom PIL import Image, ImageDraw, ImageTk\nimport svgwrite\nfrom reportlab.pdfgen import canvas\nfrom reportlab.lib.pagesizes import letter\n\nimport ttkbootstrap as tb\nfrom ttkbootstrap.constants import *\n</code></pre></div><p>Pillow → live preview image</p><p>svgwrite → scalable puzzle pages</p><p>ttkbootstrap → dark themed UI</p><p>🧠 Step 2 — Main Application Class</p><p>Everything lives inside one class:</p><div><pre><code>class TraceGridPuzzleBook:\n    APP_NAME = \"TraceGrid Puzzle Book Generator\"\n    APP_VERSION = \"1.3.0\"\n</code></pre></div><p>Define available options:</p><div><pre><code>    GRID_STYLES = [\"Square\", \"Isometric\", \"Triangle\"]\n    SYMBOL_TYPES = [\"Dot\", \"Circle\", \"Square\", \"Mixed\"]\n    EXPORT_FORMATS = [\"SVG\", \"PNG\", \"PDF\"]\n</code></pre></div><p>Now initialize the window:</p><div><pre><code>    def __init__(self):\n        self.root = tk.Tk()\n        tb.Style(theme=\"darkly\")\n\n        self.root.title(f\"{self.APP_NAME} v{self.APP_VERSION}\")\n        self.root.geometry(\"1130x620\")\n</code></pre></div><p>🎛 Step 3 — State Variables</p><p>These store user settings:</p><div><pre><code>        self.grid_size_var = tk.IntVar(value=5)\n        self.symbol_var = tk.StringVar(value=\"Dot\")\n        self.path_complexity_var = tk.IntVar(value=50)\n\n        self.symbol_color_var = tk.StringVar(value=\"#000000\")\n        self.line_color_var = tk.StringVar(value=\"#000000\")\n        self.bg_color_var = tk.StringVar(value=\"#ffffff\")\n\n        self.line_thickness_var = tk.IntVar(value=2)\n        self.symbol_radius_var = tk.IntVar(value=8)\n\n        self.rows_var = tk.IntVar(value=2)\n        self.cols_var = tk.IntVar(value=2)\n        self.pages_var = tk.IntVar(value=1)\n\n        self.output_dir = Path.home() / \"TraceGridPuzzleBooks\"\n</code></pre></div><p>Each tk.Variable automatically syncs with UI widgets.</p><p>🖼 Step 4 — Building the Interface</p><div><pre><code>Create the UI:\n\n        self._build_ui()\n        self._update_preview()\n</code></pre></div><p>Create left control panels</p><p>Add spinboxes and dropdowns</p><p>Create a center Live Preview canvas</p><p>Example: Grid size control:</p><div><pre><code>tb.Spinbox(\n    grid_body,\n    from_=3,\n    to=15,\n    textvariable=self.grid_size_var,\n    command=self._update_preview\n).grid(row=0, column=1)\n</code></pre></div><p>Whenever the value changes, _update_preview() redraws puzzles instantly.</p><p>🧩 Step 5 — Generating a Single Puzzle Path</p><p>Each puzzle is just a random walk through a grid:</p><div><pre><code>def _generate_single_puzzle(self):\n    size = self.grid_size_var.get()\n    complexity = self.path_complexity_var.get() / 100\n\n    total_steps = max(2, int(size * size * complexity))\n\n    path = [(0, 0)]\n    visited = set(path)\n\n    for _ in range(total_steps - 1):\n        x, y = path[-1]\n\n        neighbors = [\n            (x+dx, y+dy)\n            for dx, dy in [(0,1),(1,0),(0,-1),(-1,0)]\n            if 0 &lt;= x+dx &lt;

It is usually better than any machine at coordinating and\nthinking through things, so let's see if we can hack something together,\none human brain and one LLM agent brain!</p><p>The above might look like a simple .webm video, but it's actually a\nhighly sophisticated and advanced browser that was super hard to build,\nencoded as pixels in a video file! Wowzers.</p><p>For extra fun when building this, I set these requirements for myself\nand the agent:</p><ul><li>I have three days to build it</li><li>Not a single 3rd party Rust library/dependency allowed</li><li>Allowed to use anything (commonly) provided out of the box on the OS\nit runs on</li><li>Should run on Windows, macOS and common Linux distributions</li><li>Should be able to render some websites, most importantly, my own\nblog and Hacker News, should be easy right?</li><li>The codebase can always compile and be built</li><li>The codebase should be readable by a human, although code quality\nisn't the top concern</li></ul><p>So with these things in mind, I set out on the journal to build a\nbrowser \"from scratch\". I started with something really based, being\nable to just render \"Hello World\". Then to be able to render some nested\ntags. Added the ability of taking screenshots so the agent could use\nthat. Added specifications for HTML/CSS (which I think the agent never\nused :| ), and tried to nail down the requirements for the agent to use.\nAlso started doing \"regression\" or \"E2E\" tests with the screenshotting\nfeature, so we could compare to some baseline images and so on. Added\nthe ability to click on links just for the fun of it.</p><p>After about a day together with Codex, I had something that could via\nX11 and cURL, fetch and render websites when run, and the Cargo.lock is\nempty. It was about 7500 lines long in total at that point, split across\nfiles with all of them under 1000 lines long (which was a stated\nrequirement, so not a surprise).</p><p>Second day I got annoyed by the tests spawning windows while I was\ndoing other stuff, so added a --headless flag too. Did some fixes for\nresizing the window, various compatibility fixes, some performance\nissues and improved the font/text rendering a bunch. Workflow was\nbasically to pick a website, share a screenshot of the website without\nJavaScript, ask Codex to replicate it following our instructions. Most\nof the time was the agent doing work by itself, and me checking in when\nit notifies me it was done.</p><p>Third day we made large changes, lots of new features and a bunch of\nnew features supported. More regression tests, fixing performance\nissues, fixing crashes and whatnot. Also added scrolling because this is\na mother fucking browser, it has to be able to scroll. Added some debug\nlogs too because that'll look cool in the demonstration video above, and\nalso added support for the back button because it was annoying to start\nfrom scratch if I clicked the wrong link while testing.</p><p>At the end of the third day we also added starting support for macOS,\nand managed to get a window to open, and the tests to pass. Seems to\nwork OK :) Once we had that working, we also added Windows support,\nbasically the same process, just another platform after all.</p><p>Then the fourth day (whaaaat?) was basically polish, fixing CI for\nall three platforms, making it pass and finally cutting a release based\non what got built in CI. Still all within 72 hours (3 days * 24 hours,\nwhich obviously this is how you count days).</p><h2>The results after ~3 days\n(~70 hours)</h2><p>And here it is, in all its glory, made in ~20K lines of code and\nunder 72 hours of total elapsed time from first commit to last:</p><p>You can clone the repository, build it and try it out for yourself.\nIt's not great, I wouldn't even say it's good, but it works, and\ndemonstrates that one person with one agent can build a browser from\nscratch.</p><p>This is what the \"lines of code\" count ended up being after all was\nsaid and done, including

After messing around for over six months without finding a consistent rhythm, while wasting huge amounts of time and energy, I stumbled upon quantitative trading. That’s when I finally realized: “Let data speak, let rules discipline”—this is the real key to reducing risk and improving efficiency. But at first, I was completely put off by the myths of “high barriers to quant trading” and “expensive APIs,” until I discovered this free stock API. That’s when I truly took my first step into quant trading. Today, I’m sharing this battle-tested, practical experience with no reservations—for beginners who are as lost as I once was.</p><p>Let me be upfront: as a beginner in quant, you don’t need to chase complex machine learning models right away, and you definitely don’t need to spend big money on paid APIs. The free tier is more than enough to build basic strategies, connect real-time data, and run backtests. Only when you have higher needs later (e.g., high-frequency trading or Level 2 depth data) should you consider upgrading to paid plans. This is the most cost-effective and efficient path to getting started with quant trading, based on my own testing.</p><p>Today we’re keeping it real—no fluff, just my personal hands-on breakdown. I’ll walk you through using this free stock API to build a simple, beginner-friendly quantitative trading strategy, while avoiding all the pitfalls I hit along the way. Everything here is practical and implementable.</p><p>The biggest worry for beginners is “the tech is too complicated” or “registration is a hassle.” But iTick’s free tier eliminates those concerns entirely—it takes just 5 minutes to get set up, zero barrier to entry, and the free version is especially friendly for individual developers and newcomers to quant trading.</p><ol><li>Go to the <a href=\"https://itick.org/en\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">iTick website</a>, click “Get Started” in the top right, and register with your personal email—no complicated personal information required, one-step process.</li><li>After registering, go straight to the dashboard, find the “API Management” section, and you’ll see your API Token. This token is crucial—you’ll need it for real-time data access and all API calls. Save it securely and never share it.</li><li>Key details on free tier permissions (must-read for beginners): Supports basic real-time quotes for US stocks, Hong Kong stocks, A-shares, and other markets, plus minute-level to daily historical K-line data. Rate limit is 10 requests/minute—plenty for beginners building simple strategies (e.g., trend following, moving average crossover). It’s permanently free with no expiration, very beginner-friendly.</li></ol><h2>\n  \n  \n  2. Connecting Real-Time Data\n</h2><p>The core of quantitative trading is simple: get market data in real time → apply preset strategy logic → generate trading signals. The very first and most critical step is real-time data access—if latency is high, your strategy judgments become inaccurate and can lead to unnecessary losses. iTick’s free API supports both RESTful and WebSocket push methods with very low latency (&lt;100 ms for major markets), perfectly suitable for non-ultra-high-frequency strategies and easy for beginners to handle.</p><p>I used Python throughout (the top choice for beginners—simple syntax, tons of online resources, quick solutions when you get stuck). Below are ready-to-run code examples. Just replace with your own API Token, copy-paste, and run to get real-time US stock data. Every line has detailed comments—take your time if something looks unfamiliar.</p><p>First, install the two required libraries (run in your terminal):<code>pip install requests websocket-client</code>\nThese are standard Python libraries for API calls and real-time streaming—installation is straightforward.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  1. RESTful API for Real-Time Quotes\n</h3><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Real-world result: Running this instantly returns Apple’s current price, volume, and percentage change with very low latency—basically in sync with regular trading apps. Beginners should start with a single stock to get familiar with the data structure before expanding to multiple.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  2. WebSocket for Real-Time Streaming\n</h3><p>If your strategy needs to monitor multiple stocks continuously (e.g., Apple, Tesla, Nvidia), WebSocket is better—it pushes updates in real time without repeated polling, more efficient and time-saving.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><h2>\n  \n  \n  3. Building a Real Strategy\n</h2><p>Once real-time data is connected, you can start building the actual strategy. Beginners should begin with the classic “Dual Moving Average Crossover”—simple logic, easy to understand, controllable risk, and a favorite starting point for many experienced quant traders. Combined with iTick’s real-time and historical data, it’s quick to implement without advanced coding skills.</p><p>Quick breakdown of the dual MA strategy (no complex formulas—just understand the idea):</p><p>Choose two moving averages—a short-term (e.g., 20-day) and a long-term (e.g., 60-day). Trading signals come from crossovers:</p><ul><li>Short-term MA crosses above long-term MA (“Golden Cross”) → bullish trend → Buy signal</li><li>Short-term MA crosses below long-term MA (“Death Cross”) → bearish trend → Sell signal</li></ul><p>Using iTick data, the program automatically detects these crossovers, removing emotional bias—this is the biggest advantage of quant: rational, disciplined, no chasing or panic selling.</p><ol><li>Get historical data: Pull a stock’s historical K-lines via iTick API (e.g., last ~3 years daily data) for backtesting—essential to validate past performance before live use.</li><li>Calculate MAs: Use Python’s talib library to compute 20-day and 60-day simple moving averages.</li><li>Generate signals: Automatically detect golden/death crosses.</li><li>Real-time monitoring: Use WebSocket to watch price; alert on signal (beginners: alerts only, no auto-trading).</li></ol><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>I wrote a lot, but it really boils down to one thing: getting started with quant trading as a beginner doesn’t have to be technically intimidating or expensive. Start with a free stock API and the simplest dual moving average strategy—nail real-time data first, then gradually optimize and simulate live trading. Step by step is far more reliable than trading on emotion or tips.</p><p>That’s exactly how I did it—from not even knowing what an API was to now comfortably building basic quant strategies and monitoring multiple US stocks in real time. I’m not making huge profits, but I’ve avoided most of the old emotional traps, and my trading mindset is much calmer. The real essence of quant trading has never been “beating the market”—it’s “understanding the market,” using discipline to control your behavior and overcome greed and fear. That’s the philosophy I’ve stuck with.</p>","contentLength":6929,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"The Death of the DMV Line: How I Found a Driving Test Slot in 48 Hours 🚗","url":"https://dev.to/hypertools/the-death-of-the-dmv-line-how-i-found-a-driving-test-slot-in-48-hours-2mon","date":1769504963,"author":"Roberto | Hyper-Tools","guid":423639,"unread":true,"content":"<p>I recently had to renew my license in Nevada.

C is a systems language. JavaScript is a browser language. Rust is a safety-focused systems language. SQL is a query language.</p><p>Python doesn't fit. It can be tricky, for an experienced programmer, to grasp what Python actually is and which slot to put it in. Often, they conclude \"I don't like Python\" and express confusion at its vast popularity in the 2020s.</p><p>Like the eponymous snake, Python can be hard to pin down — and like a real python, it may end up wrapped around your codebase whether you planned it or not.</p><p>Traditionally we're taught to classify languages along a few axes:</p><ul><li>scripting vs \"real\" languages</li><li>imperative vs OO vs functional</li></ul><p>Python fits poorly into all of them.</p><p>It isn't a compiled language in the C or Rust sense: it doesn't result in a standalone executable. It supports imperative, object-oriented and functional styles but isn't optimized for any of them. It began as a scripting language, but today it's used to build large, long-running systems.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  The Key Insight: Python Is Not Defined by Its Output\n</h3><p>The turning point is to realize that Python is <strong>not defined by the artefact it produces</strong>.</p><p>C, C++, Rust, Zig and Fortran produce binaries that can be directly run. The output is the thing. Once compiled, the language largely disappears from the execution model.</p><p>Python doesn't work like that.</p><p>A Python program needs a runtime ecosystem to execute: the interpreter, the object model, the garbage collector and the standard library. These are not incidental. They  Python. A Python program can't run standalone unless all of these components are bundled with it.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Python as a Runtime Ecosystem\n</h3><p>In structural terms, Python sits alongside other runtime-centric language ecosystems:</p><ul><li>Java, Scala, Kotlin, Clojure on the JVM</li></ul><p>The similarity is architectural role: in all these cases, the runtime is the , not any compiled artefact.</p><p>Strictly speaking, Python is a language specification with multiple implementations — IronPython runs on .NET, Jython on the JVM. But in practice, CPython and its C-API-dependent package ecosystem  Python. That's what made Python popular, and that's what we're discussing here.</p><p>The differences from .NET and the JVM matter too.</p><ul><li>.NET and the JVM have JIT compilation to native code; CPython does not by default.</li><li>.NET and the JVM enforce static typing as part of the compilation model; Python's type hints are advisory.</li><li>.NET and the JVM produce native distributable artefacts (.dll, .jar) with stable ABIs (Application Binary Interfaces); Python does not, making it more difficult to call. Python prefers to call other libraries rather than be called itself.</li></ul><p>So Python belongs in the \"runtime ecosystem\" category, but it's a looser, more dynamic variant; it trades static type-safe guarantees for flexibility and rapid development.</p><p>This structural similarity doesn't fully explain Python's success — Ruby, Perl and PHP share similar characteristics but declined while Python grew. Historical contingency matters: NumPy's timing, Google's investment in TensorFlow, and early academic adoption all played roles that had little to do with language design.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Where Python's Nature Is Clearest: Orchestration\n</h3><p>Going to back to our question of \"What IS Python?\", the key is to realize that Python is a runtime-centric language. Its nature is clearest in numerical computing, data engineering and machine learning, where Python orchestrates work rather than performing it.</p><p>The most important Python libraries—NumPy, SciPy, Pandas, PyTorch, TensorFlow—are not written in Python in any meaningful sense. Python provides the API, the glue and the control flow. The heavy computation happens in C, C++, Fortran or CUDA libraries that expose a C ABI.</p><p>Python performs the same role over its libraries as:</p><ul></ul><p>It is an orchestration language sitting above high-performance systems. That's why it thrives in scientific computing, data pipelines and machine learning. You build rapidly and easily, with simple syntax, while the underlying libraries deliver the performance. So long as orchestration overhead is low, Python-based systems can scale surprisingly far.</p><p>This is the glamorous use case — but not necessarily the most common one.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  That's Not the Whole Story\n</h3><p>The orchestration model explains Python's dominance in scientific and data-heavy domains — but most Python code written globally is web apps, scripts, automation and data munging where Python  doing the work directly.</p><p>In web development and business applications (think Django, Flask, FastAPI), Python handles HTTP requests, processes strings and executes business logic. Here, Python trades raw performance for development speed and ecosystem breadth. A Django application will be slower than an equivalent in Go or C#, but it may ship months earlier.</p><p>For these workloads, the framing is different: Python is a productive general-purpose language that prioritizes developer time over CPU time.</p><p>Python's popularity is no mystery once you consider this trade-off.</p><p>Being able to assemble things quickly, in readable code, with vast ecosystem support, matters more for mass adoption than type-safety, compilation speed or raw performance. Make something easy, and more people will do it; make something quick to do, and more people will do it, more often.</p><p>Python lowers the barrier to entry for proof-of-concept and prototype work. You can validate an idea in hours rather than days. If performance becomes critical later, you can translate hot paths into a compiled language—but you've already learned what needs building.</p><p>Getting something working , quickly, turns out to be more important than getting it working fast or elegantly. Shell scripting demonstrated this in the 1970s; Visual Basic and VBA did this in the 1990s; Python demonstrates it today. Make it easy and fast to build, and they will come and build.</p><p>A note of realism: \"rewrite hot paths later\" is technically true but economically rare. Most prototypes never get rewritten; they become production systems. This is true of any language, but Python's low barrier to entry means more prototypes get written in the first place — and more of them survive into production.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  When Python Is the Wrong Choice\n</h3><p>A fair assessment requires acknowledgement of where Python doesn't belong:</p><ul><li> — Garbage collection pauses are unacceptable when deadlines are measured in microseconds.</li><li> — Neither iOS nor Android use Python as a first-class development language.</li><li> — JavaScript and WebAssembly own this space.</li><li><strong>Memory-constrained embedded systems</strong> — Python's runtime overhead is prohibitive on microcontrollers (although MicroPython, a cut-down implementation, has some adoption in this space).</li><li><strong>Latency-critical network services</strong> — Where every millisecond matters, Go, Rust or C++ are better choices.</li><li><strong>CPU-bound pure-Python workloads</strong> — If you can't offload to native libraries, Python's interpreter speed becomes a genuine bottleneck.</li></ul><p>These are domains Python doesn't seriously contest. More relevant are the pain points in domains where Python  used:</p><ul><li> — The Global Interpreter Lock limits true parallelism in CPU-bound multithreaded code.</li><li><strong>Packaging and distribution</strong> — pip, virtualenv, conda, poetry, and pyproject.toml represent years of fragmented solutions to dependency management.</li><li> — Relative imports, __init__.py behaviour, and module resolution remain sources of confusion.</li><li> — Shipping a Python application to end users without requiring them to install Python remains harder than it should be.</li></ul><p>Python excels at orchestration, rapid prototyping and domains with strong library support. It is not a universal solution, and it carries real operational costs.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Why Python still feels slippery\n</h3><p>Even with this framing, Python can still feel oddly unsatisfying if you come from strongly structured languages.</p><p>Compared with C#/Java or their ecosystems, Python has:</p><ul><li>a simpler, leakier object model</li></ul><p>If you're used to the discipline of C#, the functional elegance of F# or the precision of Rust, Python can feel vague. Things work — until they don't — and the language often declines to help you reason about correctness ahead of time.</p><p>That's a real cost. But as the previous section argues, for many problem domains it's a cost worth paying.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Clearing Up Misconceptions\n</h3><p>\nTrue for CPU-bound pure-Python code. False when Python orchestrates native libraries—NumPy array operations execute at C speed regardless of Python's overhead.</p><p><strong>\"Python is a scripting language.\"</strong>\nHistorically accurate; Python originated as a scripting tool. But \"scripting language\" now undersells what Python has become.</p><p>\nMisleading. CPython compiles source to bytecode, then executes that bytecode on a virtual machine — much like many modern interpreters do. The distinction matters when reasoning about performance and behaviour, but it's an implementation detail rather than a defining characteristic.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  A Better Language Taxonomy\n</h3><p>Python fits comfortably into this three-tier classification:</p><div><table><thead><tr></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>C, C++, Rust, Zig, Fortran</td><td>The binary is the product</td></tr><tr><td>The runtime is the product</td></tr><tr><td>Bash, PowerShell, VBA, Lua</td><td>The host environment is the product</td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>Python belongs firmly in the second group—with the caveat that it's a more dynamic, less rigidly structured member than Java or C#.</p><p>The boundaries are not perfectly clean. Go has garbage collection, a runtime and reflection, yet produces statically-linked binaries — it sits at the boundary between the first two categories. Taxonomies are useful simplifications, not natural laws.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  A brief note for Rust and Go proponents\n</h3><p>A common challenge: Python's role is better served by \"doing it properly\" in a compiled language from the start.</p><p>That view makes sense if your problem is well-specified, stable, performance-critical and worth committing to upfront architectural constraints. In such cases, Rust or Go can be excellent choices.</p><p>But many real-world problems do not start that way. They begin as ill-defined, exploratory or fast-moving systems: data pipelines, research code, internal tools, integration glue. A research team needs to test an idea quickly at small scale. A business team needs a tactical solution because the problem won't wait for strategic architecture.</p><p>In those contexts, using a language with strict typing, memory models or concurrency primitives can frustrate development with language-wrestling, where making the language work becomes centre-stage.</p><p>Python and compiled languages are therefore not competitors but complements: Python for orchestration and discovery; Rust, Go or C# for stabilised, performance-critical components. Your Python prototype becomes your teacher—clarifying what the real system needs to do.</p><p>That said, Python's actual competition in most domains isn't Rust or Go — it's JavaScript/TypeScript, Ruby, R, and Julia. Python's victory over these closer competitors owes as much to ecosystem momentum and historical timing as to language design.</p><p>Python isn't confused, incoherent or a \"toy\" language. It simply departs from the mental models of earlier language generations.</p><p>Python is a runtime-centric ecosystem that excels at orchestration, rapid prototyping and leveraging high-performance native libraries. It trades static guarantees and raw speed for flexibility, readability and development velocity.</p><p>That trade-off turns out to be exactly what a large portion of programmers need — including many who aren't professional developers at all, but scientists, analysts and business users who need working code fast. It let's you deliver, quickly. And that's what makes Python incredibly useful — and wildly popular.</p>","contentLength":11655,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Weekly Challenge: Maximum Encryption","url":"https://dev.to/simongreennet/weekly-challenge-maximum-encryption-49a8","date":1769496588,"author":"Simon Green","guid":423600,"unread":true,"content":"<p>Each week Mohammad S.

It's a great way for us all to practice some coding.</p><p>You are given an array of alphanumeric string, .</p><p>Write a script to find the max value of alphanumeric string in the given array. The numeric representation of the string, if it comprises of digits only otherwise length of the string.</p><p>This task can be achieved in a single line in both Python and Perl, while still maintaining readability. For the Python solution I use list comprehension to convert each string into an integer (if it is all digits) or the length of string (if it isn't). This is wrapped around the <a href=\"https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#max\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">max</a> function to return maximum (largest) of these values.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Not to out-shinned, Perl can achieve similar functionality by using the <a href=\"https://perldoc.perl.org/functions/map\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">map</a> function, converting each string into its numeric representation or its length. Perl doesn't have a built-in  function, but it is available from the <a href=\"https://metacpan.org/pod/List::Util\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">List::Util</a> package.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><div><pre><code>./ch-1.py \n123\n\n./ch-1.py \n4\n\n./ch-1.py \n99\n\n./ch-1.py \n10\n\n./ch-1.py \n2026\n</code></pre></div><p>You are given a string  and an integer $int.</p><p>Write a script to encrypt the string using the algorithm - for each character  in , replace  with the  character after  in the alphabet, wrapping if needed and return the encrypted string.</p><p>For this task, I start by setting  (called  in Python as  is a reserved word) to be the modulus (remainder) of 26. If that value is , I return the original string as no encryption is required.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>The next step is creating a mapping table. I start with the variable  that has all the lower case letters of the English alphabet. I create a  string by slicing the  string at the appropriate point. I then double the length of each string by adding the upper case equivalent string. Finally, I use  to convert the strings to a dictionary where the key is the original letter and the value is the new letter.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>The final step is to loop through each character and use the  dictionary to replace the letter, or use the original character if it is not found (numbers, spaces, punctuation characters, etc).</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>The Perl code follows the same logic. It uses the splice method to create the  variable, and both  and  are arrays. The  function also comes from the List::Util package. Perl will automatically convert a flat list to key/value pairs in the  hash.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><div><pre><code>./ch-2.py abc 1\nbcd\n\n./ch-2.py xyz 2\nzab\n\n./ch-2.py abc 27\nbcd\n\n./ch-2.py hello 5\nmjqqt\n\n./ch-2.py perl 26\nperl\n</code></pre></div>","contentLength":2523,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Amazon Listing Traffic Analysis: Building a Real-Time Traffic Attribution System","url":"https://dev.to/loopsthings/amazon-listing-traffic-analysis-building-a-real-time-traffic-attribution-system-1hh6","date":1769494623,"author":"Mox Loop","guid":423599,"unread":true,"content":"<p>When your Amazon listing's sales suddenly double but you can't identify the traffic source, you need a systematic approach to traffic analysis.

Gaurav","guid":423583,"unread":true,"content":"<p>When you build side projects, there’s a phase that almost nobody talks about.</p><p>Not the phase where you learn a new framework.\nNot the phase where you wire APIs.<p>\nNot even the phase where everything finally works.</p></p><p>There’s a much quieter phase.</p><p>The phase where you stop building\nand start <strong>deciding what is allowed to exist</strong>.</p><p>Up to this point in Phase-3, I had a fully functional frontend:\nrouting worked, pages existed, layout was in place, navigation was responsive, and the system was technically sound.</p><p>From an engineering perspective, I could have kept adding features endlessly.</p><p>But from a product perspective, something more important was missing:</p><blockquote><p>the product didn’t yet have a .</p></blockquote><p>And without a final shape, you’re not building a product — you’re just accumulating components.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  The Moment You Switch From Developer to Product Owner\n</h2><p>Day-5 was the first day where I consciously stopped asking:</p><p>“How do I implement this?”</p><p>“What should this product even be?”</p><p>That’s a very different mental model.</p><p>As a developer, you’re rewarded for adding things.\nAs a product owner, you’re rewarded for .</p><p>Because every extra option:</p><ul><li>increases maintenance cost</li><li>increases surface area for bugs</li><li>weakens the identity of the system</li></ul><p>So instead of adding, I started .</p><p>Freezing decisions.\nFreezing structure.</p><p>This is something you only learn after working on real systems:\nprogress is not always forward — sometimes it’s about drawing boundaries.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Why I Removed “Home” From Navigation\n</h2><p>One of the most deliberate decisions I made was removing the “Home” link from the navigation.</p><p>On paper, it looks harmless.\nIn practice, it’s redundant.</p><p>Users already know three universal rules:</p><ul><li>home is not a feature, it’s a state</li></ul><p>So keeping “Home” in the navigation was not helping anyone.\nIt was just occupying attention.</p><p>And attention is the most expensive resource in any product.</p><p>By removing it, the navigation became something else:\nnot a list of pages,.</p><p>Each item now answers a real user question:</p><ul></ul><p>That’s not navigation anymore.\nThat’s storytelling.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Navigation as a Contract, Not a Menu\n</h2><p>At this point,  stopped being just a config file.</p><p>It became a .</p><ul><li>what the user is allowed to explore</li><li>what I’m willing to maintain long-term</li></ul><p>Changing it is no longer a refactor.\nIt’s a strategic decision.</p><p>This is exactly how real systems evolve:\nroutes become APIs,\ncontracts become identity.</p><p>Your navigation is literally your public interface.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Branding Is Not Design, It’s Memory\n</h2><p>Adding the logo consistently across the Navbar, Header, and Footer wasn’t a cosmetic improvement.</p><p>It was a memory-building decision.</p><p>People don’t remember layouts.\nThey remember symbols.</p><ul><li>the product becomes recognizable</li><li>navigation becomes intuitive</li><li>the site feels “real” instead of “personal project”</li></ul><p>This is one of the biggest psychological differences between:\na portfolio that feels like a demo<p>\nand one that feels like a product.</p></p><p>The logo stops being decoration.\nIt becomes infrastructure.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  The Real Work of Day-5: Knowing When to Stop\n</h2><p>Day-5 didn’t involve complex algorithms.\nIt didn’t involve clever abstractions.<p>\nIt didn’t involve any “wow” features.</p></p><p>But it involved one of the hardest engineering skills:</p><blockquote><p>knowing when the system is <em>coherent enough to freeze</em>.</p></blockquote><p>Not perfect.\nNot complete.</p><p>This is where many projects die:\nthey keep evolving without ever stabilizing,<p>\nso nothing ever feels finished,</p>\nand everything feels temporary.</p><p>By finalizing the navigation, footer, and branding,\nI wasn’t just polishing UI —<strong>locking the surface area of the product</strong>.</p><ul><li>new features must fit this structure</li><li>design must respect these boundaries</li><li>changes become intentional, not accidental</li></ul><p>That’s the moment a codebase becomes a system.</p><p>Now, I want to talk about something more important:</p><blockquote><p><strong>what this phase does to how other people perceive you.</strong></p></blockquote><p>Because at some point, your portfolio stops being a learning tool.\nIt becomes a signal.</p><p>A signal to recruiters.\nA signal to engineers.<p>\nA signal to people who might work with you.</p></p><p>And signals are built from decisions, not from code volume.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Why This Is Actually Leadership Work\n</h2><p>Most developers think leadership looks like:</p><ul></ul><p>In reality, leadership starts much earlier.</p><blockquote><p>making irreversible decisions in uncertain systems.</p></blockquote><ul></ul><p>I was saying:\n“This is the shape of the system I’m responsible for.”</p><p>That’s not coding.\nThat’s ownership.</p><p>And ownership is the single strongest signal of seniority.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  The Recruiter Psychology Nobody Talks About\n</h2><p>Here’s a harsh truth most people don’t realize:</p><p>Recruiters don’t evaluate portfolios like engineers.\nThey evaluate them like .</p><ul><li>Does this feel intentional?</li><li>Does this person make decisions?</li></ul><ul></ul><blockquote><p>“This person builds things, but doesn’t finish them.”</p></blockquote><ul><li>limited, clean navigation</li></ul><p>Day-5 moved the project from the first category to the second.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Why Most Portfolios Fail at This Exact Stage\n</h2><ul></ul><ul></ul><p>So most portfolios become:</p><ul></ul><p>They never become .</p><p>The moment you stop iterating UI endlessly and say:\n“This is the experience I want users to have.”</p><p>You separate yourself from 95% of developers.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Freezing Structure Unlocks Speed\n</h2><p>The moment you stop changing structure,\nyou can move faster than ever.</p><ul><li>new pages plug into known routes</li><li>components follow known layout</li><li>design follows known system</li><li>decisions become local, not global</li></ul><p>Before Day-5:\nevery change risked breaking everything.</p><p>After Day-5:\nevery change has a home.</p><p>This is exactly how large systems scale:\nnot by adding flexibility,<strong>reducing degrees of freedom</strong>.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  The Hidden Career Benefit of This Phase\n</h2><p>This phase does something subtle to your personal brand:</p><blockquote><p>“developer who learns technologies”</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>“engineer who designs systems”</p></blockquote><p>Because senior roles are not about:</p><ul></ul><ul><li>how you think about products</li><li>how you constrain complexity</li><li>how you make irreversible decisions</li></ul><p>Day-5 is literally a leadership simulation.</p><p>You just don’t notice it while doing it.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Why This Matters More Than Any Framework\n</h2><ul></ul><p>But this skill will not age:</p><blockquote><p>knowing when a system is ready to be .</p></blockquote><p>That’s product thinking.\nThat’s engineering maturity.<p>\nThat’s what people actually hire for.</p></p><p>Not your stack.\nNot your libraries.</p><p>If I had to summarize Day-5 in one line:</p><blockquote><p>Day-5 is when the project stopped being a collection of pages\nand became a <strong>product with a defined identity</strong>.</p></blockquote><p>No new features.\nNo fancy code.</p><div><pre><code>\n            Sushant Gaurav\n          \n              Coming soon!\n

Its implementation can be as simple or complex as you want.</p><p>One of the most frequently used solutions is recursion—a core concept in computer science. Whether you're learning computer science, preparing for your next interview, or simply reinforcing old concepts, join me in writing a Fibonacci sequence using recursion with Go.</p><p>Recursion means breaking a problem into smaller subproblems. Sometimes you'll add or remove something , or you'll need to adjust the solution . In some cases, you might solve the problem for half of the dataset.</p><p>In the Fibonacci sequence, the function calls itself with smaller inputs. Each recursive call works toward the base case.</p><blockquote><p>Given n calculate the nth Fibonacci number.</p></blockquote><p>The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting with 0 and 1.

To do this, I define a base case—a condition that tells the function when to stop.</p><p>Every recursive function consists of two parts: the base case (when to stop) and the recursive case (when to call itself). I've already defined the base case. Now it's time to declare the recursive case. For Fibonacci, I need to call the function twice with smaller inputs—specifically  and .</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>You might be asking: \"Why does it call itself twice?\" Good question. Each number is the sum of the two preceding ones.</p><p>The Fibonacci function is mathematically defined as:  for . </p><p>So to compute&nbsp;, you need:</p><ul><li><p>&nbsp;(which needs&nbsp;&nbsp;and&nbsp;)</p></li><li><p>&nbsp;(which needs&nbsp;&nbsp;and&nbsp;)</p></li></ul><p>Easy, right? And there you have it—you've solved the Fibonacci sequence using recursion. But I'm afraid to say it's the worst solution.</p><p>Why learn something that's a bad solution? Well, because it's the core concept for complex solutions like dynamic programming or memoization. If you're a React programmer, you've used memoization plenty of times with the  or  hooks. So that's why you need to learn recursion first.</p><p>An example will make this clearer. Let's find the Fibonacci sequence for the number 4.</p><p>Let's trace through the recursion step by step:</p><ol></ol><div><pre><code>* `F(2)` calls `F(1)` and `F(0)`\n\n* `F(1)` returns 1 (base case)\n\n* `F(0)` returns 0 (base case)\n\n* So `F(2) = 1 + 0 = 1`\n\n* `F(1)` returns 1 (base case)\n\n* So `F(3) = 1 + 1 = 2`\n</code></pre></div><div><pre><code>* `F(1)` returns 1 (base case)\n\n* `F(0)` returns 0 (base case)\n\n* So `F(2) = 1 + 0 = 1`\n</code></pre></div><ol></ol><p>Notice how  is calculated  and  is calculated . This redundancy is why the naive recursive solution is inefficient—it has exponential time complexity of O(2ⁿ). For larger values of n, the same calculations are repeated thousands or even millions of times.</p><p>This is exactly why we need optimization techniques like memoization or dynamic programming, which store previously calculated values to avoid redundant work.</p><p>Recursion is best used when it makes the solution clearer. When you call a function from another function, the calling function pauses in a partially completed state. Imagine what this does to memory.</p><p>Despite its drawbacks, recursion powers many important algorithms, so it's worth understanding how it works.</p><p>If you want to dive deeper or practice, try other exercises like factorial or the Tower of Hanoi.

Your support means the world! </p></blockquote><p>An API gateway is like the front door to a collection of microservices. It's the single point where all outside requests enter your system. I build them in Go because the language gives me the speed and control needed to handle thousands of requests without breaking a sweat. Let me show you how I put one together, piece by piece.</p><p>Think of the gateway as a traffic director. A client asks for something, like a user profile. Instead of the client needing to know exactly which server hosts that data, it just asks the gateway. My job is to take that request, figure out which backend service handles user profiles, forward the request, get the response, and send it back. This hides the complexity of the internal network.</p><p>Let's start with the core structure. I create a main  type that holds everything together. It has a router to direct traffic, a registry to know about my services, and slots for all the features I'll add, like rate limiting.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>The first real job is routing. When a request comes in for , I need to know that this goes to the . I use a library like  to define these paths. I don't hardcode them. Instead, I have a configuration where I register services and the URL patterns they own.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>When I register a service, I tell the gateway: \"Here's a service called . It lives at  and it wants to handle any request that starts with .\" The gateway then creates a dedicated handler function for those routes.</p><p>The handler function is where the action happens. This function is called for every incoming request on that route. Its job is to apply rules, call the backend, and handle the response. I structure it as a series of steps, like a checklist.</p><p>First, I check if the client is sending too many requests too fast. This is rate limiting. I don't want one user or a broken client to overwhelm my backend services. I typically limit by the client's IP address.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>My rate limiter uses a \"token bucket\" algorithm. Imagine a bucket that holds tokens. Each request takes one token. Tokens refill slowly over time. If a client's bucket is empty, they have to wait. This allows for short bursts of traffic but enforces a steady average limit.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Next, I check the circuit breaker. If the  has been failing a lot recently, I don't want to keep hitting it with requests. It's probably down or struggling. The circuit breaker \"opens\" after too many failures and stops all traffic to that service for a short while. This gives it time to recover and prevents my gateway from wasting resources and making the user wait for a certain timeout.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>The circuit breaker keeps a simple count. If failures for a service reach a threshold—say, 5 failures in a row—it opens. After a cooldown period, it lets one request through as a test. If that succeeds, it closes the circuit and lets traffic flow normally again.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Before I even call a backend, I check the cache. For  requests, the response might not have changed. If a user asks for product details twice in a minute, I can just send back the first answer I stored. This is incredibly fast and takes load off the backend servers.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>My cache is a simple map in memory, but I add expiration times to each entry. I also limit the total number of cached items. When the cache is full, I remove the oldest entry to make space.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>If the request passes all these checks and isn't in the cache, it's time to call the backend service. This is called forwarding or proxying. I take the incoming request, copy its method, headers, and body, and send it to the service's URL.</p><p>I do this with a timeout. I never let a request wait forever. If the backend is slow, I cancel the request after my configured timeout—maybe 5 or 10 seconds—and return an error to the client. This is crucial for reliability.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>I also add retries. Sometimes a network hiccup causes a failure. If a request fails, I might try it one or two more times with a small delay between attempts. I only retry on certain types of errors, like network timeouts, not on \"user not found\" errors.</p><p>The real power comes from the middleware pipeline. Middleware are small functions that process a request before it reaches the final forwarding step or process the response after. They are like checkpoints on the road.</p><p>For example, an authentication middleware checks for a valid API key or JWT token in the request header. A logging middleware records every request for debugging. A transformation middleware might add a standard header to all outgoing requests to the backend.</p><p>I chain them together so they run in order. Each middleware function receives the request and the next function in the chain. It can decide to pass the request along, modify it, or stop and send a response right away.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>In my gateway, I apply a stack of these middlewares to every request. This keeps my core forwarding logic clean. Cross-cutting concerns like auth, logging, and metrics are handled separately.</p><p>Talking about metrics, I collect data on everything. How many requests per service? What's the response time? How many errors? I store these in simple counters and gauges. Every few seconds, I log them or send them to a monitoring system. This data tells me if a service is getting slow or if the error rate is climbing.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>I also run background health checks. Every 30 seconds, my gateway sends a  request to each registered backend service. If a service fails to respond with a success code, I mark it as unhealthy in my registry. I can then stop sending live traffic to it, or I can alert an operator. This is how the circuit breaker knows a service might be down.</p><p>Putting it all together, the  function sets up the world. I create the gateway, register my services, add my middleware stack, and start the server.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>When you run this, you have a working, production-style API gateway. It listens on port 8080. Clients talk only to this port. The gateway knows how to find the , the , and the . It protects them with rate limits, shields the system with circuit breakers, speeds up responses with a cache, and handles common tasks like authentication in one place.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  The result is a system that is much easier to manage. You can change, scale, or replace a backend service without the clients ever knowing. You can add security or logging features in one spot instead of a dozen. And because it's written in Go, it handles high traffic with very little resource use, giving you a strong, reliable foundation for your microservices architecture.\n</h2><p>📘 , , , and  to the channel!</p><p> is an AI-driven publishing company co-founded by author .

This is how I historically have been running benchmarks and other experiments\nrequiring a repeated sequence of commands — type them manually once, then rely on shell history\n(and maybe some terminal splits) for reproduction. These past few years I’ve arrived at a much better\nworkflow pattern — . I was forced to adapt it once I started working with multiprocess\napplications, where manually entering commands is borderline infeasible. In retrospect, I should\nhave adapted the workflow years earlier.</p><section><p>Use a (gitignored) file for interactive scripting.

No Terraform for workflow definitions. No separate infrastructure repo.

With Temporal, it's the default behavior.</p><p>Debug a failing activity with your IDE's debugger. Set breakpoints. Inspect state. Validate fixes locally before deploying.</p><p>This is what simplicity means: removing the gap between \"I think this will work\" and \"I know this works.\"</p><p>The migration path isn't all-or-nothing:</p><ol><li>: Implement one workflow in Temporal, run both systems in parallel for a week</li><li>: Compare execution times, reliability, developer experience</li><li>: Run Temporal workflows in production, keep Google Workflows as fallback</li><li>: 10% → 50% → 100% with rollback ready</li></ol><p>We kept Google Workflows YAML in git history (never delete, just remove from deployment) and maintained the rollback capability for 30 days. We never needed it.</p><p>The simplicity of Temporal isn't in having fewer moving parts. It's in having the  moving parts.

Circadian rhythms govern hormone production, not because 3 AM is inherently different from 3 PM in some abstract sense, but because organisms that adapted their behavior to temporal patterns outcompeted those that didn't.</p><p>Software governance has been stuck in the \"temporally blind\" paradigm.

The \"Garbage In, Garbage Out\" Reality of RAG\n</h2><p>In the rush to adopt Generative AI, a dangerous misconception has taken root: that the Large Language Model (LLM) is the magic wand that solves information retrieval. Teams dump thousands of raw PDFs, messy HTML scrapes, and unformatted Confluence pages into a vector database, wire up an embedding model, and expect GPT-4 to act as a perfect oracle.</p><p>The reality is a chatbot that confidently hallucinates, retrieves navigation footers instead of technical specs, and costs a fortune in token usage because it’s processing thousands of characters of HTML boilerplate for every query.</p><p><strong>Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) is not an AI problem; it is a data engineering problem.</strong></p><p>The difference between a toy demo and a production RAG system lies almost entirely in the —specifically, the rigorous transformation of unstructured web content into semantically dense, highly indexable vector representations. If your vector search returns garbage, your LLM will generate garbage. No amount of prompt engineering can fix a context window filled with  tags and cookie consent banners.</p><p>This article details the architecture of a high-performance Web-to-Vector pipeline, moving beyond basic tutorials to discuss the engineering trade-offs of cleaning, chunking, and embedding strategies that survive in production.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  2. The Web-to-Vector Pipeline Architecture\n</h2><p>Treating RAG as an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) workflow allows us to apply standard data engineering rigor to AI systems. The pipeline consists of five distinct stages, each acting as a filter for noise and a multiplier for signal.</p><ol><li> Reliable fetching of dynamic and static content.</li><li> Converting raw DOM trees into \"Dense Text\" or Markdown.</li><li><strong>Fragmentation (Chunking):</strong> The strategic breaking of text into semantic units.</li><li> Generating embeddings at scale.</li><li> Storage with metadata strategies for pre-filtering.</li></ol><h2>\n  \n  \n  3. High-Fidelity Scraping: Beyond </h2><p>The first point of failure is often the acquisition layer. Modern websites are complex Single Page Applications (SPAs) laden with hydration scripts, lazy-loaded content, and anti-bot defenses.</p><p>A raw HTML document is approximately 90% noise relative to an LLM's needs. Classes, IDs, inline styles, script tags, and SVG paths consume embedding dimensions without adding semantic meaning.</p><ul><li> Feeding raw HTML to an embedding model. The model will waste attention mechanisms on  rather than the core content.</li><li><strong>HTML-to-Markdown conversion.</strong></li></ul><p>Markdown is the lingua franca of LLMs. It preserves structural hierarchy (headers, lists, tables) which are critical for semantic understanding, while stripping the presentation layer.</p><ul><li> Excellent for extracting the main article body and discarding sidebars/navs. It uses heuristics to identify the \"center of gravity\" of text density.</li><li><strong> + Custom Heuristics:</strong> For specialized sites (e.g., documentation with complex code blocks), you often need to write custom parsers that target specific  divs and preserve  tags while stripping controls.</li></ul><h3>\n  \n  \n  3.2 Dynamic Content Handling\n</h3><p>For production systems, a static HTTP request often fails. You need a headless browser cluster (e.g., Playwright or Puppeteer) to render the DOM.</p><ul><li> Aggressively block resource types. Your scraper does not need to load images, fonts, or stylesheets. Blocking these reduces latency by 60-80% and saves bandwidth costs.</li></ul><h2>\n  \n  \n  4. Chunking Strategies: The Art of Segmentation\n</h2><p>Once you have clean, dense Markdown, you face the most critical decision in the pipeline: .</p><p>How you split your text determines what your retrieval system  find. If you split a question from its answer, no amount of embedding power will reconnect them.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  4.1 Fixed-Size vs. Semantic Chunking\n</h3><p>\nThe naive approach. \"Split every 500 tokens, with 50 tokens overlap.\"</p><ul><li> Computationally cheap, predictable.</li><li> Frequently breaks semantic thoughts. A sentence might be cut in half, destroying its vector representation.</li></ul><p>\nThis approach uses an embedding model to scan the text sentence-by-sentence. It calculates the cosine similarity between sequential sentences. If the similarity drops below a threshold (a \"semantic break\"), a new chunk is started.</p><ul><li> Chunks represent coherent ideas. Retrieval precision increases significantly.</li><li> Computationally expensive (requires  inference calls).</li></ul><p><strong>Recursive / Structural Chunking:</strong>\nThe middle ground for RAG. Since we converted our HTML to Markdown, we can leverage the structure. We split by Header 1 (), then Header 2 (), then paragraphs.</p><ul><li> This guarantees that a chunk respects the document's logical hierarchy. A \"Configuration\" section stays together; it doesn't bleed into \"Installation\".</li></ul><h2>\n  \n  \n  5. The Embedding Layer: Production Considerations\n</h2><p>Embedding is the compression of meaning into vectors. In a production pipeline, this is not a \"set it and forget it\" step.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  5.1 Batching and Throughput\n</h3><p>Embedding APIs (like OpenAI's ) or local models (like ) have significant latency.</p><ul><li> Implement a  architecture. Don't embed chunks one by one. Accumulate chunks into buffers (e.g., 100 chunks) and send them in a single API call / GPU inference pass. This dramatically reduces network overhead and maximizes GPU utilization.</li></ul><p>This is a silent killer in long-running RAG systems. If OpenAI updates their embedding model, or if you switch from  to , your new vectors will live in a different latent space than your old vectors. Distance calculations between them will be mathematical nonsense.</p><ul><li> Version your indices. , . Never mix vectors from different models in the same namespace.</li></ul><h2>\n  \n  \n  6. Vector Storage &amp; Retrieval Optimization\n</h2><p>The Vector Database (Pinecone, Weaviate, Chroma) is where the rubber meets the road. However, \"Similarity Search\" (KNN/ANN) is rarely enough on its own.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  6.1 The Power of Metadata Filtering\n</h3><p>In high-scale systems, searching the entire vector space is inefficient and noisy.</p><ul><li> A user asks \"How do I reset my password?\" in the context of \"Enterprise Application A\".</li><li> The vector search retrieves password reset instructions for \"Consumer Application B\" because the semantic vectors are nearly identical.</li><li>. During the scraping phase, you must extract metadata: , , , .</li><li><code>vector_search(query_embedding, filter={product_id: \"Ent_App_A\"})</code>. This restricts the ANN search to a relevant subset, guaranteeing context awareness.</li></ul><h3>\n  \n  \n  6.2 Hybrid Search (The \"Keyword\" Safety Net)\n</h3><p>Vectors are great at concepts (\"dog\" matches \"canine\"), but terrible at exact matches (SKUs, error codes, acronyms).</p><ul><li> Enable . This combines dense vector search with sparse keyword search (BM25).</li><li> If a user searches for error code , vector search might return generic error pages. BM25 will find the exact document containing that string. A weighted sum of these scores provides the most robust retrieval.</li></ul><h2>\n  \n  \n  7. End-to-End Example: The Documentation Crawler\n</h2><p>Let's imagine we are building a RAG system for a fast-changing developer documentation site.</p><ol><li> An Airflow DAG triggers nightly.</li><li> Playwright visits the documentation root. It navigates the sitemap.</li><li> removes the sidebar, the \"Was this helpful?\" widgets, and the footer.</li><li> The clean HTML is converted to Markdown. Code blocks are specially tagged to ensure they aren't split mid-function.</li><li> We use a MarkdownSplitter. We keep headers attached to their child paragraphs so context isn't lost.</li><li> We generate a hash of the chunk's text content. We check our Vector DB to see if this hash already exists.  prevents re-indexing unchanged content, saving money and time.</li><li> New chunks are batched and embedded.</li><li> Vectors are pushed to Pinecone with metadata: , , , .</li></ol><h2>\n  \n  \n  8. Conclusion: Engineering Reliability\n</h2><p>Building a demo RAG app takes an afternoon. Building a production RAG pipeline takes engineering discipline. The quality of your AI's answers is directly downstream of the quality of your data pipeline.</p><p>By focusing on high-fidelity scraping, semantic cleaning, intelligent chunking, and metadata-rich indexing, you move from a stochastic toy to a deterministic system.

The culprit was the garbage collector, running at what felt like the worst possible time. This sent me on a long journey to understand how to make it behave predictably.</p><p>Let's start with the basics. Go's garbage collector is concurrent and tries to do most of its work alongside your program. However, it needs to stop the world briefly, a \"STW pause,\" to start a cycle and to finish up certain phases. The goal of tuning isn't to eliminate garbage collection—that's impossible—but to control when it happens and how long it stops your program.</p><p>The most famous knob is . You can set it as an environment variable or at runtime with . The default is 100. Think of it this way: if your program is using 100MB of live, useful data, the GC will trigger a collection cycle when the total heap size reaches about 200MB. That gives it 100MB of extra space, or \"garbage,\" to work with. A higher , like 200, means it waits longer—triggering at 300MB in our example. This leads to fewer, but larger, collection cycles. A lower value, like 50, makes GC happen more often, which can keep individual pauses shorter but may add more total overhead.</p><p>Here's how you might manage it programmatically.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>But  alone isn't enough for low-latency work. Its trigger is relative to your  memory. If your live memory is small and volatile, the heap can grow very quickly between cycles, leading to large sweep phases. This is where the concept of a \"heap ballast\" comes in.</p><p>A ballast is a simple trick: you allocate a large chunk of memory that you never really use. This artificially increases your live heap size, making the GC's growth trigger () much larger in absolute terms. The collector runs less often, and when it does run, it has a larger, more stable heap to work with, which can make its job more efficient.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>You must be careful with ballast on memory-constrained systems, but in many cloud environments where memory is allocated in large chunks anyway, it's a powerful tool for smoothing out GC cycles.</p><p>The next major strategy is to simply create less garbage for the collector to manage. This is the most effective method. If the collector has less work to do, its pauses are shorter. The  is your best friend here. It caches and reuses allocated objects, taking pressure off both the allocator and the garbage collector.</p><p>Consider a network server that processes thousands of requests per second, each needing a temporary buffer.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>This pattern dramatically reduces allocations. Instead of creating and discarding a new  slice for every request, we recycle them. The pool manages the lifecycle, and the garbage collector largely ignores these long-lived, reused objects.</p><p>To understand what to tune, you need to measure. The  function provides a wealth of information.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Key metrics to watch are  (the last 256 GC pause durations),  (total count), and  (the fraction of CPU time used by GC since program start). A rising  is a clear sign the collector is working too hard.</p><p>For the most demanding applications, you might need to move beyond tuning and start controlling. You can trigger a GC cycle manually with . The trick is to call it during natural breaks in your workflow.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Be cautious with manual calls. Calling  too often hurts performance, and calling it at a bad time can cause a major pause during critical work. It requires a deep understanding of your application's phases.</p><p>Finally, structure your data to be GC-friendly. The garbage collector must walk all reachable objects. Deep, complex pointer chains take longer to scan. Flatter structures with fewer pointers can reduce scan time.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><h2>\n  \n  \n  When you combine these techniques—adjusting , using a heap ballast, pooling objects, monitoring pressure, and manually controlling collection timing—you transform the garbage collector from a source of unpredictable latency into a predictable component of your system. The pauses don't disappear, but they become small, infrequent, and, most importantly, scheduled for times when your application can best handle them. It's about cooperation, not fighting the runtime. You give the GC clear rules and a manageable workload, and in return, it gets its job done without interrupting yours.\n</h2><p>📘 , , , and  to the channel!</p><p> is an AI-driven publishing company co-founded by author .

I often face a problem: a complex business process happens, and later, someone asks, \"Why is the data in this state?\" Traditional approaches might only store the current result, losing the story of how we got there. There's a way to keep that entire story, and it can make your systems much more resilient. It involves two main ideas: keeping a permanent record of every change, and separating the tasks of updating data from reading it.</p><p>Imagine your application's state isn't a single static picture. It's a filmstrip. Every single change—a user registration, an updated address, a completed purchase—is one frame in that film. You can always rewind and play the film from the beginning to see exactly how you arrived at the current scene. This is the core of event sourcing. Instead of overwriting a customer's address in a database table, you record an event: . The current address is simply the latest event in that sequence.</p><p>This pairs powerfully with another idea: CQRS. This is a fancy acronym for a simple concept. It means you use different models for writing data (Commands) and reading data (Queries). Think of it like a kitchen in a restaurant. The chefs (write side) receive orders, work in a specific, controlled area with their own tools, and produce finished dishes. The waitstaff (read side) have a completely separate station for retrieving those dishes and presenting them to customers. They don't interfere with the cooking process. In software, this separation lets you scale and optimize the two sides independently.</p><p>When you combine these two patterns, you get a robust architecture. You have an immutable record of everything that's happened (the event log), and you can build as many specialized, optimized views of that data as you need (the query models). Let me show you how this can work in Go, focusing on keeping the code clear and performant.</p><p>First, we need a place to store our filmstrip—the immutable sequence of events. We call this the Event Store.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>The event store is simple but powerful. Its main job is to append events and guarantee their order. Notice the  field. It's crucial for handling situations where two actions try to update the same customer at the same time (optimistic concurrency control). If you try to append an event expecting version 5, but the stream is already at version 6, you know something has changed since you last looked, and you can reject the command or retry.</p><p>Now, how do we initiate changes? We don't modify state directly. We send a Command. A command is an intention or a request to do something. \"Change customer address\" is a command. It may be rejected if it's invalid. If accepted, it results in one or more events being stored.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>The command handler is the brain of the write side. It contains the rules. It says, \"Given this request and the history of what's happened before, what should happen next?\" It loads history, makes a decision, and if the decision is \"yes,\" it tells the event store to record a new fact.</p><p>Reconstructing state from events every time can be slow for entities with long histories. This is where Snapshots help. A snapshot is a saved version of the state at a specific point in time (e.g., at version 100). To get the current state, you load the snapshot and then only replay events that happened after it.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Your command handler logic can be modified to check for a snapshot first. If one exists at version 50, you load it and then only ask the event store for events from version 51 onward to rebuild the current state. This dramatically speeds up loading for active entities.</p><p>So far, we've focused on the write side: commands and events. Now, let's look at the read side, or Queries. This is where CQRS shines. The event log is the truth, but it's not a good format for answering specific questions like \"Show me a list of customer names and their cities.\" For that, we build Projections.</p><p>A projection listens to events and builds a tailor-made, optimized database table (or in-memory structure) for answering specific questions.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>The projection is a simple state machine. It says, \"When I see a  event, I will add a row to my lookup map. When I see an  event, I will find that row and update the city.\" This model is now perfect for answering the question \"Who lives in Boston?\" instantly. You can have many different projections for different purposes: one for lists, one for search indexes, one for reporting totals.</p><p>How do projections get the events? They subscribe to the event store. In a microservices setup, this could be done through a message broker (like Kafka) that distributes events. For simplicity, let's implement a simple subscription.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Finally, let's stitch it all together in a  function to see the flow.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>This architecture gives you a lot. You have a complete audit trail. You can rebuild your read models from scratch if they become corrupted, because the source of truth is the event log. You can add new types of queries (new projections) without touching the complex command-handling logic. The write side stays focused on maintaining data integrity, and the read side is free to be optimized for speed.</p><p>Moving to microservices, this pattern is very helpful. Each service can own its event stream. If the \"Payment\" service needs to know about an \"OrderPlaced\" event from the \"Order\" service, the Order service publishes it. The Payment service listens, updates its own internal state via its own events, and builds its own projections. The services are decoupled, communicating asynchronously through events.</p><p>Performance is a key consideration. Go's concurrency primitives—goroutines and channels—are excellent for building this. You can have a pool of goroutines processing commands, another pool handling projection updates, and channels to pass events between components with backpressure. The  in our examples protects the in-memory state, but for production, you'd use a real database for the event store (like PostgreSQL, or purpose-built stores) and likely use a message queue for publishing events to projections.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  The initial learning curve is steeper than a simple CRUD setup. You have to think in terms of events and commands. However, for complex business domains where understanding the history is critical, or where you need to scale reads and writes differently, the investment pays off. Your system gains a form of time travel, and its components become loosely coupled, focused, and easier to reason about in isolation. Start with a bounded context where the business logic is complex, and you'll likely find that event sourcing with CQRS brings a welcome clarity.\n</h2><p>📘 , , , and  to the channel!</p><p> is an AI-driven publishing company co-founded by author .

It supports the interests of several different personas. For example, users want low latency and delightful experiences. Developers want flexible and extensible architectures. Security staff need governance to protect information and availability. System engineers need monitoring and observability solutions that help them support the user experience. Product managers need information about how well their products perform with users. Budget managers need cost controls. The needs of these different people across your organization are important considerations for hosting generative AI applications.</p><p>The solution we share in this post offers the following capabilities:</p><ul><li> – Authenticate and authorize users from the built-in user directory, from your enterprise directory, and from consumer identity providers like Amazon, Google, and Facebook</li><li>– Provide users and applications low-latency access to your generative AI applications</li><li> – Determine what resources your users have access to in your application</li><li><strong>Rate limiting and metering</strong> – Mitigate bot traffic, block access, and manage model consumption to manage cost</li><li>– Offer access to leading foundation models (FMs), agents, and safeguards to keep users safe</li><li>– Observe, troubleshoot, and analyze application behavior</li><li>– Extract value from your logs to build, discover, and share meaningful insights</li><li>– Track key datapoints that help staff react quickly to events</li><li> – Reduce costs by detecting common queries to your models and returned predetermined responses</li></ul><p>In the following sections, we dive into the core architecture and explore how you can build these capabilities into the solution.</p><p>The following diagram illustrates an architecture using the AppSync Events API to provide an interface between an AI assistant application and LLMs through <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Amazon Bedrock</a> using <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">AWS Lambda</a>.</p><p>The workflow consists of the following steps:</p><ol><li>The client application retrieves the user identity and authorization to access APIs using <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/cognito/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Amazon Cognito</a>.</li><li>The client application subscribes to the AppSync Events channel, from which it will receive events like streaming responses from the LLMs in Amazon Bedrock.</li><li>The  Lambda function attached to the Outbound Messages namespace verifies that this user is authorized to access the channel.</li><li>The client application publishes a message to the Inbound Message channel, such as a question posed to the LLM.</li><li>The  Lambda function receives the message and verifies the user is authorized to publish messages on that channel.</li><li>The  function relays the response messages from the Converse API to the Outbound Message channel for the current user, which passes the events to the WebSocket on which the client application is waiting for messages.</li></ol><p>AppSync Events namespaces and channels are the building blocks of your communications architecture in your AI Gateway. In the example, namespaces are used to attach different behaviors to our inbound and outbound messages. Each namespace can have different publish and subscribe integration to each namespace. Moreover, each namespace is divided into channels. Our channel structure design provides each user a private inbound and outbound channel, serving as one-to-one communications with the server side:</p><ul><li><code>Inbound-Messages / ${sub}</code></li><li><code>Outbound-Messages / ${sub}</code></li></ul><p>The subject, or  attribute, arrives in our Lambda functions as context from Amazon Cognito. It is an unchangeable, unique user identifier within each user pool. This makes it useful for segments of our channel names and is especially useful for authorization.</p><p>Identity is established using Amazon Cognito, but we still need to implement authorization. One-to-one communication between a user and an AI assistant in our example should be private—we don’t want users with the knowledge of another user’s  attribute to be able to subscribe to or publish to another user’s inbound or outbound channel.</p><p>This is why we use  in our naming scheme for channels. This enables the Lambda functions attached to the namespaces as data sources to verify that a user is authorized to publish and subscribe.</p><p>The following code sample is our  Lambda function:</p><div><pre><code>def lambda_handler(event, context):\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;\"\"\"\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Lambda function that checks if the first channel segment matches the user's sub.\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Returns None if it matches or an error message otherwise.\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;\"\"\"\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;# Extract segments and sub from the event\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;segments = event.get(\"info\", {}).get(\"channel\", {}).get(\"segments\")\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;sub = event.get(\"identity\", {}).get(\"sub\", None)\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;# Check if segments exist and the first segment matches the user's sub\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;if not segments:\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;logger.error(\"No segments found in event\")\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;return \"No segments found in channel path\"\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;if sub != segments[1]:\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;logger.warning(\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;f\"Unauhotirzed: Sub '{sub}' did not match path segment '{segments[1]}'\"\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;)\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;return \"Unauthorized\"\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;logger.info(f\"Sub '{sub}' matched path segment '{segments[1]}'\")\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;return None</code></pre></div><p>The function workflow consists of the following steps:</p><ol><li>The name of the channel arrives in the event.</li><li>The user’s subject field, , is part of the context.</li><li>If the channel name and user identity don’t match, it doesn’t authorize the subscription and returns an error message.</li><li>Returning  indicates no errors and that the subscription is authorized.</li></ol><p>The  Lambda function uses the same logic to make sure users are only authorized to publish to their own inbound channel. The channel arrives in the event and the context carries the user identity.</p><p>Although our example is simple, it demonstrates how you can implement complex authorization rules using a Lambda function to authorize access to channels in AppSync Events.We have covered access control to an individual’s inbound and outbound channels. Many business models around access to LLMs involve controlling how many tokens an individual is allowed to use within some period of time. We discuss this capability in the following section.</p><h2>Rate limiting and metering</h2><p>Understanding and controlling the number of tokens consumed by users of an AI Gateway is important to many customers. Input and output tokens are the primary <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/pricing/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">pricing</a> mechanism for text-based LLMs in Amazon Bedrock. In our example, we use the <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/APIReference/API_runtime_Converse.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Amazon Bedrock Converse API</a> to access LLMs. The Converse API provides a consistent interface that works with the models that support messages. You can write code one time and use it with different models.</p><p>Part of the consistent interface is the <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/APIReference/API_runtime_ConverseStreamMetadataEvent.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">stream metadata event</a>. This event is emitted at the end of each stream and provides the number of tokens consumed by the stream. The following is an example JSON structure:</p><div><pre><code>{\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;\"metadata\": {\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"usage\": {\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"inputTokens\": 1062,\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"outputTokens\": 512,\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"totalTokens\": 1574\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;},\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"metrics\": {\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"latencyMs\": 4133\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;}\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;}\n}</code></pre></div><p>We have input tokens, output tokens, total tokens, and a latency metric. To create a control with this data, we first consider the types of limits we want to implement. One approach is a monthly token limit that resets every month—a static window. Another is a daily limit based on a rolling window on 10-minute intervals. When a user exceeds their monthly limit, they must wait until the next month. After a user exceeds their daily rolling window limit, they must wait 10 minutes for more tokens to become available.</p><p>We need a way to keep atomic counters to track the token consumption, with fast real-time access to the counters with the user’s , and to delete old counters as they become irrelevant.</p><p><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Amazon DynamoDB</a> is a serverless, fully managed, distributed NoSQL database with single-digit millisecond performance at many scales. With DynamoDB, we can keep atomic counters, provide access to the counters keyed by the , and roll off old data using its time to live feature. The following diagram shows a subset of our architecture from earlier in this post that now includes a DynamoDB table to track token usage.</p><p>We can use a single DynamoDB table with the following partition and sort keys:</p><ul><li> –  (String), the unique identifier for the user</li><li> –  (String), a composite key that identifies the time period</li></ul><p>The  will receive the  attribute from the JWT provided by Amazon Cognito. The  will have strings that sort lexicographically that indicate which time period the counter is for as well as the timeframe. The following are some example sort keys:</p><div><pre><code>10min:2025-08-05:16:40\n10min:2025-08-05:16:50\nmonthly:2025-08</code></pre></div><p> or  indicate the type of counter. The timestamp is set to the last 10-minute window (for example, ).</p><p>With each record, we keep the following attributes:</p><ul><li> – Counter for input tokens used in this 10-minute window</li><li> – Counter for output tokens used in this 10-minute window</li><li> – Unix timestamp when the record was created or last updated</li><li> – Time to live value (Unix timestamp), set to 24 hours from creation</li></ul><p>The two token columns are incremented with the DynamoDB atomic ADD operation with each metadata event from the Amazon Bedrock Converse API. The  and  columns are updated to indicate when the record is automatically removed from the table.</p><p>When a user sends a message, we check whether they have exceeded their daily or monthly limits.</p><p>To calculate daily usage, the  module completes the following steps:</p><ol><li>Calculates the start and end keys for the 24-hour window.</li><li>Queries records with the partition key  and sort key between the start and end keys.</li><li>Sums up the  and  values from the matching records.</li><li>Compares the sums against the daily limits.</li></ol><p>See the following example code:</p><div><pre><code>KeyConditionExpression: \"user_id = :uid AND period_id BETWEEN :start AND :end\"\nExpressionAttributeValues: {\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;\":uid\": {\"S\": \"user123\"},\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;\":start\": {\"S\": \"10min:2025-08-04:15:30\"},\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;\":end\": {\"S\": \"10min:2025-08-05:15:30\"}\n}</code></pre></div><p>This range query takes advantage of the naturally sorted keys to efficiently retrieve only the records from the last 24 hours, without filtering in the application code.The monthly usage calculation on the static window is much simpler. To check monthly usage, the system completes the following steps:</p><ol start=\"5\"><li>Gets the specific record with the partition key  and sort key  for the current month.</li><li>Compares the  and  values against the monthly limits.</li></ol><div><pre><code>Key: {\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;\"user_id\": {\"S\": \"user123\"},\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;\"period_id\": {\"S\": \"monthly:2025-08\"}\n}</code></pre></div><p>With an additional Python module and DynamoDB, we have a metering and rate limiting solution that works for both static and rolling windows.</p><p>Our sample code uses the Amazon Bedrock Converse API. Not every model is included in the sample code, but many models are included for you to rapidly explore possibilities.The innovation in this area doesn’t stop at models on AWS. There are numerous ways to develop generative AI solutions at every level of abstraction. You can build on top of the layer that best suits your use case.</p><p>Many of our AI Gateway stakeholders are interested in logs. Developers want to understand how their applications function. System engineers need to understand operational concerns like tracking availability and capacity planning. Business owners want analytics and trends so that they can make better decisions.</p><p>With <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Amazon CloudWatch Logs</a>, you can centralize the logs from your different systems, applications, and AWS services that you use in a single, highly scalable service. You can then seamlessly view them, search them for specific error codes or patterns, filter them based on specific fields, or archive them securely for future analysis. CloudWatch Logs makes it possible to see your logs, regardless of their source, as a single and consistent flow of events ordered by time.</p><p>In the sample AI Gateway architecture, CloudWatch Logs is integrated at multiple levels to provide comprehensive visibility. The following architecture diagram depicts the integration points between AppSync Events, Lambda, and CloudWatch Logs in the sample application.</p><h3>AppSync Events API logging</h3><p>Our AppSync Events API is configured with ERROR-level logging to capture API-level issues. This configuration helps identify issues with API requests, authentication failures, and other critical API-level problems.The logging configuration is applied during the infrastructure deployment:</p><div><pre><code>this.api = new appsync.EventApi(this, \"Api\", {\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;// ... other configuration ...\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;logConfig: {\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;excludeVerboseContent: true,\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;fieldLogLevel: appsync.AppSyncFieldLogLevel.ERROR,\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;retention: logs.RetentionDays.ONE_WEEK,\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;},\n});</code></pre></div><p>This provides visibility into API operations.</p><h3>Lambda function structured logging</h3><p>The Lambda functions use <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/powertools/python/latest/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">AWS Lambda Powertools</a> for structured logging. The  Lambda function implements a  class that provides context for each conversation:</p><div><pre><code>logger = Logger(service=\"eventhandlers\")\n\nclass MessageTracker:\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;\"\"\"\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Tracks message state during processing to provide enhanced logging.\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Handles event type detection and processing internally.\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;\"\"\"\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;def __init__(self, user_id, conversation_id, user_message, model_id):\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;self.user_id = user_id\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;self.conversation_id = conversation_id\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;self.user_message = user_message\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;self.assistant_response = \"\"\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;self.input_tokens = 0\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;self.output_tokens = 0\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;self.model_id = model_id\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;# ...</code></pre></div><p>Key information logged includes:</p><ul><li>Conversation identifiers for request tracing</li><li>Model identifiers to track which AI models are being used</li><li>Token consumption metrics (input and output counts)</li><li>Detailed timestamps for time-series analysis</li></ul><p>Each Lambda function sets a correlation ID for request tracing, making it straightforward to follow a single request through the system:</p><div><pre><code># Set correlation ID for request tracing\nlogger.set_correlation_id(context.aws_request_id)</code></pre></div><ul><li>Track token usage patterns by model or user</li><li>Monitor response times and identify performance bottlenecks</li><li>Detect error patterns and troubleshoot issues</li><li>Create custom metrics and alarms based on log data</li></ul><p>By implementing comprehensive logging throughout the sample AI Gateway architecture, we provide the visibility needed for effective troubleshooting, performance optimization, and operational monitoring. This logging infrastructure serves as the foundation for both operational monitoring and the analytics capabilities we discuss in the following section.</p><p>CloudWatch Logs provides operational visibility, but for extracting business intelligence from logs, AWS offers many analytics services. With our sample AI Gateway architecture, you can use those services to transform data from your AI Gateway without requiring dedicated infrastructure or complex data pipelines.</p><p>The key components include:</p><ul><li>– The  Lambda function streams structured log data to a Firehose delivery stream at the end of each completed user response. Data Firehose provides a fully managed service that automatically scales with your data throughput, alleviating the need to provision or manage infrastructure. The following code illustrates how the API call that integrates the  Lambda function with the delivery stream:</li></ul><div><pre><code># From messages.py\nfirehose_stream = os.environ.get(\"FIREHOSE_DELIVERY_STREAM\")\nif firehose_stream:\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;try:\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;firehose.put_record(\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;DeliveryStreamName=firehose_stream,\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Record={\"Data\": json.dumps(log_data) + \"\\n\"},\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;)\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;logger.debug(f\"Successfully sent data to Firehose stream: {firehose_stream}\")\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;except Exception as e:\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;logger.error(f\"Failed to send data to Firehose: {str(e)}\")</code></pre></div><ul><li><strong>Amazon S3 with Parquet format </strong>– Firehose automatically converts the JSON log data to columnar Parquet format before storing it in Amazon S3. Parquet improves query performance and reduces storage costs compared to raw JSON logs. The data is partitioned by year, month, and day, enabling efficient querying of specific time ranges while minimizing the amount of data scanned during queries.</li><li>– An <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/glue/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">AWS Glue</a> database and table are created in the <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/cdk/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">AWS Cloud Development Kit</a> (AWS CDK) application to define the schema for our analytics data, including , , , token counts, and timestamps. Table partitions are added as new S3 objects are stored by Data Firehose.</li><li><strong>Athena for SQL-based analysis </strong>– With the table in the Data Catalog, business analysts can use familiar SQL through Athena to extract insights. Athena is serverless and priced per query based on the amount of data scanned, making it a cost-effective solution for one-time analysis without requiring database infrastructure. The following is an example query:</li></ul><div><pre><code>-- Example: Token usage by model\nSELECT\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;model_id,\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;SUM(input_tokens) as total_input_tokens,\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;SUM(output_tokens) as total_output_tokens,\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;COUNT(*) as conversation_count\nFROM firehose_database.firehose_table\nWHERE year='2025' AND month='08'\nGROUP BY model_id\nORDER BY total_output_tokens DESC;</code></pre></div><p>This serverless analytics pipeline transforms the events flowing through AppSync Events into structured, queryable tables with minimal operational overhead. The pay-as-you-go pricing model of these services facilitates cost-efficiency, and their managed nature alleviates the need for infrastructure provisioning and maintenance. Furthermore, with your data cataloged in AWS Glue, you can use the full suite of analytics and machine learning services on AWS such as <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/quicksight/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Amazon Quick Sight</a> and <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/unified-studio/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Amazon SageMaker Unified Studio</a> with your data.</p><p>AppSync Events and Lambda functions send metrics to CloudWatch so you can monitor performance, troubleshoot issues, and optimize your AWS AppSync API operations effectively. For an AI Gateway, you might need more information in your monitoring system to track important metrics such as token consumption from your models.</p><p>The sample application includes a call to CloudWatch metrics to record the token consumption and LLM latency at the end of each conversation turn so operators have visibility into this data in real time. This enables metrics to be included in dashboards and alerts. Moreover, the metric data includes the LLM model identifier as a dimension so you can track token consumption and latency by model. Metrics are just one component of what we can learn about our application at runtime with CloudWatch. Because our log messages are formatted as JSON, we can perform analytics on our log data for monitoring using CloudWatch Logs Insights. The following architecture diagram illustrates the logs and metrics made available by AppSync Events and Lambda through CloudWatch and CloudWatch Logs Insights.</p><p>For example, the following query against the sample application’s log groups shows us the users with the most conversations within a given time window:</p><div><pre><code>fields&nbsp;,&nbsp;\n| filter&nbsp;&nbsp;like&nbsp;\"Message complete\"\n| stats&nbsp;count_distinct(conversation_id)&nbsp;as&nbsp;conversation_count by&nbsp;user_id\n| sort&nbsp;conversation_count desc\n| limit&nbsp;10</code></pre></div><p> and  are standard fields for Lambda logs. On line 3, we compute the number of unique conversation identifiers for each user. Thanks to the JSON formatting of the messages, we don’t need to provide parsing instructions to read these fields. The  log message is found in <code>packages/eventhandlers/eventhandlers/messages.py</code> in the sample application.</p><p>The following query example shows the number of unique users using the system for a given window:</p><div><pre><code>fields&nbsp;,&nbsp;\n| filter&nbsp;&nbsp;like&nbsp;\"Message complete\"\n| stats&nbsp;count_distinct(user_id)&nbsp;by&nbsp;bin(5m)&nbsp;as&nbsp;unique_users </code></pre></div><p>Again, we filter for , compute unique statistics on the  field from our JSON messages, and then emit the data as a time series with 5-minute intervals with the bin function.</p><h2>Caching (prepared responses)</h2><p>Many AI Gateways provide a cache mechanism for assistant messages. This would be appropriate in situations where large numbers of users ask exactly the same questions and need the same exact answers. This could be a considerable cost savings for a busy application in the right situation. A good candidate for caching might be about the weather. For example, with the question “Is it going to rain in NYC today?”, everyone should see the same response. A bad candidate for caching would be one where the user might ask the same thing but would receive private information in return, such as “How many vacation hours do I have right now?” Take care to use this idea safely in your area of work. A basic cache implementation is included in the sample to help you get started with this mechanism. Caches in conversational AI require a lot of care to be taken to make sure information doesn’t leak between users. Given the amount of context an LLM can use to tailor a response, caches should be used judiciously.</p><p>The following architecture diagram shows the use of DynamoDB as a storage mechanism for prepared responses in the sample application.</p><p>The sample application computes a hash on the user message to query a DynamoDB table with stored messages. If there is a message available for a hash key, the application returns the text to the user, the custom metrics record a cache hit in CloudWatch, and an event is passed back to AppSync Events to notify the application the response is complete. This encapsulates the cache behavior completely within the event structure the application understands.</p><h2>Install the sample application</h2><p>Refer to the <a href=\"https://github.com/aws-samples/sample-serverless-ai-gateway\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">README file on GitHub</a> for instructions to install the sample application. Both install and uninstall are driven by a single command to deploy or un-deploy the AWS CDK application.</p><p>The following table estimates monthly costs of the sample application with light usage in a development environment. Actual cost will vary by how you use the services for your use case.</p><p>The monthly cost of the sample application, assuming light development use, is expected to be between $35–55 per month.</p><p>The following screenshots showcase the sample UI. It provides a conversation window on the right and a navigation bar on the left. The UI features the following key components:</p><p>The following screenshot shows the chat interface of the sample application.</p><p>The following screenshot shows the model selection menu.</p><p>As the AI landscape evolves, you need an infrastructure that adapts as quickly as the models themselves. By centering your architecture around AppSync Events and the serverless patterns we’ve covered—including Amazon Cognito based identity authentication, DynamoDB powered metering, CloudWatch observability, and Athena analytics—you can build a foundation that grows with your needs. The sample application presented in this post gives you a starting point that demonstrates real-world patterns, helping developers explore AI integration, architects design enterprise solutions, and technical leaders evaluate approaches.</p><p>The complete source code and deployment instructions are available in the <a href=\"https://github.com/aws-samples/sample-serverless-ai-gateway\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">GitHub repo</a>.

With BSS Magic, telcos can extend, customize, and modernize their systems without vendor dependencies or lengthy implementations. By partnering with the <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/ai/generative-ai/innovation-center/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">AWS Generative AI Innovation Center</a> and using the rapid innovation capabilities of <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Amazon Bedrock</a>, we accelerated the development of BSS Magic, helping Totogi’s customers innovate faster and gain more control over their tech stack.</p><p>In this post, we explore the challenges associated with the traditional business support system (BSS), and the innovative solutions provided by Totogi BSS Magic. We introduce intricacies of telco ontologies and the multi-agent framework that powers automated change request processing. Additionally, the post will outline the orchestration of AI agents and the benefits of this approach for telecom operators and beyond.</p><p>BSS are notoriously difficult to manage. A typical BSS stack consists of hundreds of different applications from various vendors. But those BSS applications are difficult to integrate, either restricting telcos to the vendor’s ecosystem or requiring them to invest in costly customizations. Such customizations are slow and resource-intensive because of their reliance on specialized engineering talent.</p><p>Each change request necessitates a thorough analysis of potential impacts across interconnected modules, consuming significant time and effort. Even small updates can involve multiple rounds of coding, testing, and reconfiguration to achieve stability. For telecom operators, where system reliability is critical, these safeguards are non-negotiable, but they come at a steep price. This process is further complicated by the scarcity of engineers with the necessary expertise, driving up costs and elongating timelines. As a result, development cycles for new features or services often take months to complete, leaving operators struggling to meet the demands of a fast-moving market.</p><h2>BSS Magic solution overview</h2><p>Totogi BSS Magic reduces the complexity using AI-generated interoperability, which helps simplify integrations, customizations, and application development. BSS Magic has two key aspects:</p><ul><li> that understands the semantic meanings of data structures and the relationships between them, linking disparate data into a coherent network of knowledge.</li><li> for fully automated change requests (CR), which reduces CR processing time from 7 days to a few hours.</li></ul><h2>Telco ontology: The key to interoperability</h2><p>Ontologies serve as semantic blueprints that detail concepts, relationships, and domain knowledge. In telecom, this means translating the BSS landscape into a clear, reusable, and interoperable ecosystem. Totogi’s telco ontology facilitates a deep understanding of data interaction and seamless integration across any vendor or system. By adopting FAIR principles (Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability, and Reusability), the ontology-driven architecture turns static, siloed data into dynamic, interconnected knowledge assets—unlocking trapped data and accelerating innovation. An overview diagram of the ontology is provided in the following figure.</p><h2>Multi-agent framework for automated change request processing</h2><p>AI agents are advanced software applications trained to perform specific tasks autonomously. Totogi’s BSS Magic AI agents have extensive domain knowledge and use this understanding to manage complex data interactions across multiple vendor systems. These agents automatically generate and test telco-grade code, replacing traditional integrations and customizations with intelligent, AI generated applications. At its core, BSS Magic uses a multi-agent AI approach with feedback loops to automate the entire software development pipeline. Each agent is designed to fulfill a specific role in the development pipeline:</p><ul><li> translates unstructured requirements into formal business specifications.</li><li><strong>Technical architect agent</strong> takes these business specs and defines technical architectures, APIs, and dependencies.</li><li> generates high-quality, deployable code, complete with modular designs and optimizations.</li><li> validates the code for adherence to best practices, improving quality and security. It provides feedback which is used by the developer agent to update the code.</li><li> generates robust unit test cases, streamlining validation and deployment. The result of the test cases is used by the developer agent to improve the code.</li></ul><p>An overview of the system is provided in the following figure.</p><p>This integrated pipeline reduces the time to complete a change request from 7 days to a few hours, with minimal human intervention. The prerequisites for implementing the system include an AWS account with access to Amazon Bedrock, <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/step-functions/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">AWS Step Functions</a>, <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/pm/lambda/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">AWS Lambda</a>, and configured Amazon credentials. The AI agents are implemented using Anthropic Claude large language models (LLMs) through Amazon Bedrock. State management and workflow coordination are handled by Step Functions for reliable progression through each stage. The AWS infrastructure provides the enterprise-grade reliability, security, and scalability essential for telco-grade solutions.</p><p>To build the framework, Totogi collaborated with the AWS Generative AI Innovation Center (GenAIIC). GenAIIC offered access to AI expertise, industry-leading talent, and a rigorous iterative process to optimize the AI agents and code-generation workflows. It also provided guidance on prompt engineering, Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), model selection, automated code review, feedback loops, robust performance metrics for evaluating AI-generated outputs, and so on. The collaboration helped establish methods for maintaining reliability while scaling automation across the platform. The solution orchestrates multiple specialized AI agents to handle the complete software development lifecycle, from requirements analysis to test execution. The details of the AI agents are given in the following sections.</p><h2>Multi-agent orchestration layer</h2><p>The orchestration layer coordinates specialized AI agents through a combination of Step Functions and Lambda functions. Each agent maintains context through RAG and few-shot prompting techniques to generate accurate domain-specific outputs. The system manages agent communication and state transitions while maintaining a comprehensive audit trail of decisions and actions.</p><h2>Business analysis generation</h2><p>The Business Analyst agent uses Claude’s natural language understanding capabilities to process statement of work (SOW) documents and acceptance criteria. It extracts key requirements using custom prompt templates optimized for telecom BSS domain knowledge. The agent generates structured specifications for downstream processing while maintaining traceability between business requirements and technical implementations.</p><h2>Technical architecture generation</h2><p>The Technical Architect agent transforms business requirements into concrete AWS service configurations and architectural patterns. It generates comprehensive API specifications and data models and incorporates <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/architecture/well-architected/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">AWS Well-Architected</a> principles. The agent validates architectural decisions against established patterns and best practices, producing infrastructure-as-code templates for automated deployment.</p><p>The Developer agent converts technical specifications into implementation code using Claude’s advanced code generation capabilities. It produces robust, production-ready code that includes proper error handling and logging mechanisms. The pipeline incorporates feedback from validation steps to iteratively improve code quality and maintain consistency with AWS best practices.</p><h2>Automated quality assurance</h2><p>The QA agent is built using Claude to perform comprehensive code analysis and validation. It evaluates code quality and identifies potential performance issues. The system maintains continuous feedback loops with the development stage, facilitating rapid iteration and improvement of generated code based on quality metrics and best practices adherence. The QA process consists of carefully crafted prompts.</p><div><pre><code>\"You are a senior QA backend engineer analyzing Python code for serverless applications.\nYour task is to:\nCompare requirements against implemented code\nIdentify missing features\nSuggest improvements in code quality and efficiency\n&nbsp;Provide actionable feedback\nFocus on overall implementation versus minor details\nConsider serverless best practices\"</code></pre></div><p>This prompt helps the QA agent perform thorough code analysis, evaluate quality metrics, and maintain continuous feedback loops with development stages.</p><h2>Test automation framework</h2><p>The Tester agent creates comprehensive test suites that verify both functional and non-functional requirements. It uses Claude to understand test contexts and generate appropriate test scenarios. The framework manages test refinement through evaluation cycles, achieving complete coverage of business requirements while maintaining test code quality and reliability. The testing framework uses a multi-stage prompt approach.</p><p>Initial test structure prompt:</p><div><pre><code>\"As a senior QA engineer, create a pytest-based test structure including:\nDetailed test suite organization\nResource configurations\nTest approach and methodology\nRequired imports and dependencies\"</code></pre></div><p>Test implementation prompt:</p><div><pre><code>\"Generate complete pytest implementation including:\nUnit tests for each function\nIntegration tests for API endpoints\nAWS service mocking\nEdge case coverage\nError scenario handling\"</code></pre></div><p>Test results analysis prompt:</p><div><pre><code>\"Evaluate test outputs and coverage reports to:\nVerify test completion status\nTrack test results and outcomes\nMeasure coverage metrics\nProvide actionable feedback\"</code></pre></div><p>This structured approach leads to comprehensive test coverage while maintaining high quality standards. The framework currently achieves 76% code coverage and successfully validates both functional and non-functional requirements.</p><p>The Tester agent provides a feedback loop to the Development agent to improve the code.</p><p>The integration of Totogi BSS Magic with Amazon Bedrock presents a comprehensive solution for modern telecom operators.

This is a classic example of \"semantic classification\" in AI engineering.</p><p>The most obvious approach is a simple one-shot inference call: ask the LLM to select the correct field(s) from a provided list. This is easy to implement as you simply enumerate the fields in the prompt with enough detail for the LLM to make a decision. However, this approach does not scale as the list of fields can grow to hundreds or even thousands of entries. This floods the context window, increases latency (processing more tokens takes longer), and ultimately sacrifices accuracy due to the \"lost in the middle\" phenomenon.</p><p>Asking the LLM to filter through large blocks of input text is known as the \"finding a needle in a haystack\" challenge. The main problem that arises when searching for a piece of information buried in a massive context window is that models tend to forget details located in the middle, while remembering details at the beginning and end best. This is known as the \"lost in the middle\" phenomenon. One approach to mitigate this is to use a search engine to do the filtering first (finding the potential needles), allowing the LLM to work directly with the subset of most relevant data. This is what is known as the RAG solution.</p><p>RAG is not always the best solution. It depends on the nature of the data: when processing large paragraphs of text, RAG can be limited in its ability to reason over distant parts of the data because chunks are retrieved in isolation rather than as a coherent whole. For my use case, however, API fields are discrete pieces of information that are already clumped by domain (API schema and endpoint), making RAG a strong fit.</p><p>RAG alone, however, is often not enough. Retrieval typically returns entries that score highly by similarity, which can include results that look relevant but don't best match the user's intent. Reranking is a crucial technique to re-evaluate retrieved candidates in light of the user's request and select the most contextually appropriate entries.</p><p>Let's go through the steps required to build and consume a RAG system to find the field(s) that match a user's change request.</p><ol><li>: Collect the schemas and fields that are supported. The field details are important: field name, path, description, type, additional context and the source schema.</li><li><strong>Generate embeddings for each field</strong>: Iterate over all fields and generate a vector embedding (numerical representation) for each field's string representation (a concatenation of name, description, context, etc).</li><li><strong>Store the fields in a vector DB</strong>: Insert each field's vector embedding in a database that supports vector similarity search, like DuckDB 😎.</li><li><strong>Wire up your app to access the DB</strong>: Setup your app so that it can connect to the vector DB instance.</li><li><strong>Generate an embedding for the user request</strong>: Using the same \"embedder\" from step 2, generate a vector representation of the user query. This vector is used to query the DB.</li><li>: The retriever is a function that executes the \"similarity search\" against the DB relying on components from step #4 and #5. It returns a list of candidate \"documents\" (fields) that are mathematically similar to the query. LangChain supports this 😎.</li><li>: The chain puts together the retriever from step #6 along with the instructions for the LLM on how to choose the appropriate fields. This is where the final \"reasoning\" happens. LangChain is great at this 😎.</li></ol><p>Steps 1 through 3 are \"build\" concerns (often called the Ingestion Pipeline). Steps 4 through 7 are \"runtime\" concerns performed by the app to process live user requests.</p><p>Let's put it all together with DuckDB and Langchain Go. For the API fields I'm going to use the Github API. For the LLM and embedder I'm going to use GCP's Vertex models.</p><p>Collect each API field into a list of  instances that we can iterate over later on to generate the embeddings.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><blockquote><p>I'm only providing a few fields to keep it readable. In the same way there's a method  to capture all the \"repo\" fields, there would be other methods to collect \"branch protection\" fields, \"rulesets\" fields, etc.</p></blockquote><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><h3>\n  \n  \n  2. Generate embeddings for each field:\n</h3><p>To generate the embedding we need a string representation of each field. We can do so by adding a  method to  type like this:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>A few best-practice considerations for the embed string:</p><ul><li><strong>Frontload high signal information</strong>: Place the most semantically rich fields at the beginning of the string as they'll match closerly the terminology used by the user.</li><li><strong>Use natural language serialization</strong>: Many embedding models are optimized for natural language sentences. Framing the data as a coherent statement can yield better results than a robotic list of key/value pairs.</li><li>: Users may refer to some fields with alternative names. Explicitly encode those to increase the chances of matching.</li><li>: I found variations of the format to yield subtle differences in the similarity search. You should rely on integration tests to control variance and account for the subtleties of your data as you try out new formats.</li></ul><h3>\n  \n  \n  3. Store the fields in a vector DB:\n</h3><p>In order to perform similarity search against the fields, let's create a DuckDB instance and table with vector embedding support:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>And now the actual logic to write the DB instance to a file and insert the embeddings:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Lastly, iterate over the fields, generate the embedding and use the  client to insert them:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>This concludes the \"ingestion phase\". Let's now move on to the runtime processing phase. Note that I didn't include function . That will be included on the next steps as we'll also need it during runtime query processing.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  4. Wire up your app to access the DB:\n</h2><p>Let's now setup the app with a client to access and query the \"fields\" DuckDB instance written by step #3.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><h2>\n  \n  \n  5. Generate an embedding for the user request &amp; 6. Setup a RAG retriever\n</h2><p>I'm bundling steps 5 and 6 since the RAG retriever in my app takes care of generating the embedding for the user request.</p><p>⚠️  ⚠️: You should not pass the raw user provided string directly to the embedder. You should normalize it before generating the embedding by removing action verbs, stop words and any irrelevant characters to ensure high quality matching.</p><p>Let's now take a look at the embedder that must be used during both the ingestion and runtime processing phases:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>And the Langchain retriever:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Lastly, setup the RAG chain with the retriever and instructions to select the fields:</p><p>⚠️  ⚠️: Notice how the agent method  accepts both a  with the raw user query and a <code>normalizedChangeDescription</code> with the normalized string.  provides the full context to perform the final reasoning.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div>","contentLength":6879,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"My python vs rust methods for finance backtesting","url":"https://dev.to/kacawaiii/my-python-vs-rust-methods-for-finance-backtesting-2nai","date":1769443097,"author":"Kyoko","guid":421585,"unread":true,"content":"<h2>How I Made My Python Backtester 56x Faster with Rust</h2>","contentLength":52,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"How I Made My Python Backtester 56x Faster with Rust","url":"https://dev.to/kacawaiii/how-i-made-my-python-backtester-56x-faster-with-rust-1pi","date":1769442673,"author":"Kyoko","guid":421584,"unread":true,"content":"<ul><li> — ML pipeline, orchestration, data handling</li><li> — Backtesting engine, indicators, grid search</li><li> — Parallel execution</li></ul><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Same API.

Today I want to walk through the architectural decisions and technical choices that shaped it.</p><div><pre><code>Backend:  FastAPI + SQLAlchemy 2.0 + PostgreSQL\nFrontend: React 18 + TypeScript + TailwindCSS\nAuth:     JWT + bcrypt\nDeploy:   Docker + Nginx\n</code></pre></div><p>Boring? Yes. That's the point. Every piece is battle-tested, well-documented, and easy to hire for.</p><p>I'm primarily a backend engineer with Python experience. When choosing a framework, I wanted something that would let me move fast without fighting the tooling.</p><p>FastAPI checked every box:</p><ul><li> - Python is my comfort zone, so I could focus on product logic instead of learning new syntax</li><li><strong>Type hints as documentation</strong> - Pydantic schemas generate OpenAPI docs automatically, no extra work</li><li> - But sync works perfectly fine for database-bound operations</li><li> - Need anything? There's probably a Python library for it</li><li> - Hot reload, clear error messages, intuitive routing</li></ul><p>Could I have used Django? Sure. Flask? Also fine. But FastAPI hit the sweet spot between simplicity and features. For a solo developer shipping a product, that matters more than benchmarks.</p><p>The honest truth: I picked the tool I knew best so I could ship faster. No regrets.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Architecture: Monolith by Choice\n</h2><p>No microservices. No message queues. No Kubernetes. A single FastAPI process handles everything.</p><p>This wasn't a compromise—it was a deliberate decision.</p><ol><li> - One log stream, one deployment, one place to look when things break</li><li> - No service orchestration, no network calls between components, no distributed tracing</li><li> - Everything runs on a modest VPS, no complex infrastructure costs</li><li> - The entire application fits in my head</li></ol><p>SkillFade is a personal productivity tool. Even with thousands of users, a single well-optimized server handles the load easily. PostgreSQL can manage millions of rows without breaking a sweat.</p><p>The microservices question I ask myself: \"Do I have a team of 50 engineers who need to deploy independently?\" No. So monolith it is.</p><p>I'll split it when I have the problem. Not before.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  The Core Algorithm: Freshness Decay\n</h2><p>The heart of SkillFade is the freshness calculation. Here's the thinking behind it.</p><ul><li>Every skill starts at 100% freshness after you practice it</li><li>Each day without practice, freshness decays exponentially</li><li>Recent learning activity adds a small boost (max 15%)</li><li>Result is clamped between 0-100%</li></ul><p>Default decay rate is 2% per day, compounding. This means:</p><div><table><thead><tr></tr></thead><tbody></tbody></table></div><p>Linear decay (lose 1% per day) doesn't match how memory works. In reality, forgetting is steep at first, then levels off. The exponential curve better models the Ebbinghaus forgetting curve that psychologists have studied for over a century.</p><p><strong>Why does learning only \"boost\" and not reset?</strong></p><p>This is the key philosophical choice. Watching a tutorial about React doesn't mean you can build a React app. Reading about Kubernetes doesn't mean you can debug a cluster.</p><p>Learning slows decay. Only practice resets the clock.</p><p>This forces users to confront an uncomfortable truth: passive consumption isn't the same as skill building.</p><p>Not all skills fade equally:</p><ul><li> (cycling, typing) - slow decay, muscle memory persists</li><li> (design patterns, architecture) - medium decay</li><li> (specific APIs, CLI flags) - fast decay, details fade quickly</li></ul><p>Users can adjust decay rate per skill to match reality.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Database Design Decisions\n</h2><p>Six core tables. No more than necessary, no fewer than useful.</p><div><pre><code>users\ncategories\nskills\nlearning_events\npractice_events\nskill_dependencies\n</code></pre></div><p>Every table has clear ownership. Users own categories. Categories organize skills. Skills have events. Simple hierarchy, predictable queries.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Separate Tables for Learning vs Practice Events\n</h3><p>I debated this one. A single  table with a  column would be simpler, right?</p><p>I went with separate tables because:</p><ol><li> - Dashboard shows practice frequency, detail pages show both. Separate tables = simpler queries for common operations</li><li> - Learning events have types like \"video, article, course, book\". Practice events have \"project, exercise, teaching, code-review\". One enum would be confusing</li><li> - Practice events might get \"difficulty\" or \"output_url\" fields that don't make sense for learning</li><li> - Two tables makes the learning/practice distinction explicit in the data model itself</li></ol><p>The tradeoff is some duplication in the codebase. Worth it for clarity.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Hard Deletes Over Soft Deletes\n</h3><p>When a user clicks \"Delete my account,\" everything goes. CASCADE deletes across all tables. No  columns, no recovery period, no \"we keep your data for 30 days.\"</p><p>This aligns with the privacy philosophy. If someone wants out, they're out. Fully.</p><p>It also simplifies queries—no  everywhere.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Categories as First-Class Entities\n</h3><p>Early version had category as just a string field on skills. Worked fine until I wanted:</p><ul><li>Category-level analytics (\"How fresh are my Frontend skills overall?\")</li><li>Rename a category everywhere at once</li><li>Ensure no duplicate category names per user</li></ul><p>Refactored to proper  table with foreign keys. More work upfront, cleaner long-term.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Why React + Vite (Not Next.js)\n</h3><p>Next.js is great. I considered it. Went with plain React SPA instead.</p><ol><li> - It's a dashboard behind login. Google doesn't need to crawl it</li><li> - No SSR vs CSR decisions, no hydration bugs, no server components confusion</li><li> - API is API (FastAPI), frontend is frontend (React). Clean boundary</li><li> - Static files served by Nginx, API proxied separately</li></ol><p>For a marketing site or blog, I'd pick Next.js. For an authenticated dashboard app, SPA is simpler.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  State Management: Context Over Redux\n</h3><p>SkillFade uses React Context for global state. No Redux, no Zustand, no MobX.</p><ul><li>Current user (authentication)</li><li>Theme preference (dark/light)</li></ul><p>Fetched fresh per page. Server is the source of truth. When you navigate to the dashboard, it fetches current data. No stale cache problems, no sync issues.</p><p>Redux solves problems I don't have:</p><ul><li>Complex state interactions across many components? Nope, state is simple</li><li>Time-travel debugging? Never needed it</li><li>Middleware for side effects? fetch() works fine</li></ul><p>For this app, Redux would add complexity without adding value. Context + useState + useEffect covers everything.</p><div><pre><code>src/\n  components/     # Reusable UI pieces (Button, Card, Modal)\n  pages/          # Route-level components (Dashboard, SkillDetail)\n  context/        # Global state (AuthContext, ThemeContext)\n  services/       # API calls (skills.ts, events.ts)\n  hooks/          # Custom hooks (useSkills, useFreshness)\n  types/          # TypeScript interfaces\n</code></pre></div><p>Nothing fancy. Pages fetch data on mount, pass to components via props. Components are mostly presentational.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Real-time Updates Without WebSockets\n</h2><p>When you log a practice event on the skill detail page, the dashboard freshness should update.</p><ol><li> - Real-time push from server</li><li> - Fetch every N seconds</li><li> - Signal between components in same tab</li></ol><p>Went with option 3. It's a SPA—dashboard and detail page components exist in the same JavaScript context. When detail page logs an event, it dispatches a custom event. Dashboard listens and refetches.</p><p>No socket server to maintain. No unnecessary network requests. Works perfectly for single-tab usage.</p><p>For multi-device sync (phone updates, desktop sees it), you'd need WebSockets or polling. Not implemented yet. Manual refresh works for now.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  The Alert System: Calm by Design\n</h2><p>Most apps optimize for engagement. More notifications = more opens = better metrics.</p><p>SkillFade optimizes for calm. Alerts should be:</p><ul><li> - Maximum 1 email per week, total</li><li> - Only alert if user can do something about it</li><li> - Plain text, no tracking pixels, instant unsubscribe</li></ul><p>\nTriggers when a skill drops below 40% freshness. But not immediately—waits for 14 days since last alert for that skill. Prevents nagging about the same thing repeatedly.</p><p>\nTriggers when a skill has learning events but no practice events for 30+ days. The message: \"You've been learning X but not practicing. Theory without application fades fast.\"</p><p>\nTriggers when overall learning/practice ratio stays below 0.2 for two consecutive months. The message: \"You're consuming a lot but producing little. Consider more hands-on work.\"</p><p>Alerts run via scheduled job (cron), not real-time triggers. Once daily, batch process checks all users who have alerts enabled.</p><p>Each alert type has independent cooldowns. You might get a decay alert and an imbalance alert in the same week, but never two decay alerts for the same skill within 14 days.</p><p>Pure REST says everything should be a resource. I follow that mostly, but bend it when convenient:</p><ul><li> - Not really a \"resource,\" but makes sense as an endpoint</li><li> - \"login\" isn't a noun, don't care</li></ul><div><pre><code>GET  /skills\nGET  /skills/:id\nPOST /skills\nPUT  /skills/:id\n\nGET  /learning-events\nPOST /learning-events\nPUT  /learning-events/:id\nDELETE /learning-events/:id\n</code></pre></div><p>Not nested like <code>/skills/:id/learning-events/:eventId</code>. Flat is simpler to route, simpler to reason about, simpler to document.</p><p>Events reference skills via  in the body/params, not URL hierarchy.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Consistent Response Patterns\n</h3><p> Return the data directly (object or array)</p><p> Always <code>{ \"detail\": \"Human readable message\" }</code></p><p> Offset-based with , returns <code>{ items: [], total: number }</code></p><p>Frontend code stays simple when API is predictable.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Authentication: Keep It Simple\n</h2><ul><li>Access token in Authorization header</li><li>Stored in localStorage (yes, I know about XSS concerns—acceptable for this use case)</li><li>No refresh tokens—expired means re-login</li></ul><p>For a personal productivity tool used by one person at a time, this is plenty secure. No need for refresh token rotation, token families, or OAuth complexity.</p><ul><li>bcrypt with default work factor</li><li>72-byte input limit (bcrypt truncates silently, so I handle it explicitly)</li><li>No password rules beyond minimum length—let users choose their own passwords</li></ul><ol><li> - Serves frontend static files + proxies API requests</li></ol><p>Single  brings everything online. Environment variables for secrets, volumes for data persistence.</p><p>Lambda/Vercel functions would work for the API. Didn't go that route because:</p><ul><li>Cold starts matter for dashboard responsiveness</li><li>PostgreSQL connection pooling is annoying in serverless</li><li>I wanted full control over the environment</li><li>Monthly cost is predictable with a VPS</li></ul><p>For a side project, a $10-20/month VPS beats managing serverless complexity.</p><p>First two weeks, I built with a hardcoded user ID. No login, no registration, no password reset flow. Just the core features.</p><p>This prevented the classic trap: spending weeks on auth while the actual product stays unbuilt.</p><p>Added auth last, once everything else worked.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  2. Migrations From Day One\n</h3><p>Even solo, even on a side project: use database migrations (Alembic for Python).</p><p>Schema will change. \"I'll just modify the table directly\" becomes a nightmare when you have production data. Migrations saved me multiple times.</p><p>Frontend and backend types should match. I define Pydantic schemas in Python, then manually keep TypeScript interfaces in sync.</p><p>Not ideal (would love auto-generation), but catching type mismatches at compile time is worth the maintenance.</p><p>Every time I picked the \"boring\" option (PostgreSQL over MongoDB, REST over GraphQL, React over Svelte), I benefited from:</p><ul><li>More Stack Overflow answers</li><li>Smoother hiring (if I ever need help)</li></ul><p>Novel tech is fun. Shipped products need boring tech.</p><p>GDPR requires \"right to deletion.\" Even if you're not in the EU, it's good practice.</p><p>Plan for cascade deletes from day one. No orphaned data, no \"soft delete\" flags that accumulate forever.</p><p>I relied on manual testing too long. Click through the app, check if it works. Tedious and error-prone.</p><p>Should have set up Playwright or Cypress from week two.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Design Alert System First\n</h3><p>Retrofitting notifications into an existing schema was messy. Alert cooldowns, user preferences, email templates—all added later, all awkward.</p><p>If I started over, I'd design the alert data model upfront.</p><p>Built every button, input, modal, and dropdown from scratch with Tailwind. Educational, but slow.</p><p>Next time: Radix UI or Headless UI for primitives, custom styling on top.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  The Anti-Complexity Manifesto\n</h2><p>Every feature request, every \"nice to have,\" every shiny technology gets filtered through one question:</p><p><strong>\"Does the added complexity justify the value?\"</strong></p><ul><li>Microservices?

From guiding disaster relief efforts to shaping smarter cities, Geographic Information Systems, or GIS, empower us to see and understand our planet in ways that were once unimaginable. If you're new to this realm or simply curious about its potential, this guide will unravel the magic of GIS, exploring its core concepts, vital components, and transformative real-world uses. By the end, you'll see why this technology is revolutionizing industries and decision-making across the globe.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Understanding the Basics of GIS\n</h2><p>At its core, GIS is a powerful computer-based tool that captures, stores, analyzes, and displays data linked to specific spots on Earth's surface. Think of it as a dynamic digital map, layered with rich information. One layer might trace winding road networks, while another highlights population clusters or rainfall zones. By tying location to detailed data, GIS turns raw numbers into vivid, interactive visuals that reveal hidden insights.</p><p>What makes GIS truly remarkable is its knack for weaving together diverse datasets through the common thread of place. Whether it's census statistics, satellite photos, or social media buzz, GIS merges these elements to create a full, clear picture of any area. This fusion helps uncover trends and connections that might stay buried in old-school spreadsheets or static reports, making it an invaluable asset for anyone seeking deeper understanding.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Core Components and Key Functions\n</h2><p>GIS thrives as a unified system, built on a foundation of critical pieces working in harmony. It relies on hardware for raw processing power, software for crafting visualizations and running analyses, and spatial databases to house vast troves of geographic data. Together, these elements enable GIS to tackle several essential roles.</p><p>First, it organizes data, sorting geographic points and blending inputs from a wide array of sources. Next, it brings this information to life through engaging maps and digital models that simplify complex ideas. Then, it dives into spatial analysis, using advanced methods to unearth patterns and relationships. Finally, it empowers users to create and refine data, crafting fresh datasets or polishing existing ones for accuracy.</p><p>Picture a city planner at work, using GIS tools to layer zoning rules over flood risk zones. The resulting map becomes a guiding light, pinpointing safe spots for new buildings while ensuring compliance with regulations. This kind of practical insight shows the true strength of GIS in action.</p><p>GIS juggles two main types of geospatial data, each with a unique role in mapping our world. Raster data comes as a grid of cells or pixels, each packed with details like height or heat readings. This style shines when handling continuous information, such as sweeping satellite images or weather radar visuals, offering a broad, textured view.</p><p>In contrast, vector data sketches out geographic features with precise points, lines, and polygons. It's perfect for mapping distinct elements, like property edges or street layouts. Imagine a city map where points mark bus stops, lines trace roads, and polygons outline green spaces. This format delivers sharp, exact representations.</p><p>Beyond these two, GIS taps into a vast pool of sources, from land records to mobile phone signals. Its ability to unite such varied data through location as a central link transforms it into a powerhouse for comprehensive, all-encompassing analysis.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Real-World Applications and Impact\n</h2><p>The reach of GIS stretches across countless fields, proving itself as a cornerstone for smart decisions and efficient resource use. Its influence touches many areas with profound effect.</p><p>In logistics, it streamlines delivery paths and fleet movements, slashing expenses and shrinking carbon footprints. For infrastructure, it monitors the health of roads and utilities, ensuring timely care and upgrades. Environmental planning benefits as GIS models climate strategies and pinpoints prime spots for sustainable projects. During crises, it shapes emergency plans for events like storms or quakes. Even in business, it dissects market shifts to fuel growth plans.</p><p>Take disaster response as a striking example. When wildfires rage, response teams lean on GIS to chart impacted zones, monitor fire spread in real time, and carve out safe escape routes. This kind of spatial insight doesn't just inform, it saves lives by speeding up critical choices.</p><p>To peek under the hood of GIS data handling, consider this basic pseudo-code for finding nearby emergency shelters:</p><div><pre><code>define function findNearestShelter(currentLocation, shelterList):\n    initialize shortestDistance as infinity\n    initialize nearestShelter as null\n    for each shelter in shelterList:\n        distance = calculateDistance(currentLocation, shelter.location)\n        if distance is less than shortestDistance:\n            shortestDistance = distance\n            nearestShelter = shelter\n    return nearestShelter\n</code></pre></div><p>This snippet reflects how GIS tools crunch spatial ties, guiding users to vital resources in urgent times.</p><p>With the immense potential of GIS now in view, you're ready to take your first steps. Kick off by exploring free tools like QGIS, a robust platform packed with features for beginners to master the basics. Seek out online tutorials or join community forums to sharpen your skills in mapping and analysis. If you're with a team or organization, brainstorm ways GIS could solve specific hurdles, whether in streamlining workflows or boosting planning precision.</p><p>Start with a simple project, like plotting local landmarks or sifting through community stats. As confidence builds, tackle bigger challenges, such as environmental simulations or market studies. The secret lies in hands-on learning through trial and exploration. GIS isn't merely a tool, it's a window into viewing our world through the prism of place. Dive in, and you'll uncover insights that pave the way for wiser, more sustainable choices. Embrace this journey, and let GIS inspire you to map out a better tomorrow.</p>","contentLength":6210,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"GeoPandas Basics: Maps, Projections, and Spatial Joins","url":"https://realpython.com/geopandas/","date":1769436000,"author":"Real Python","guid":421542,"unread":true,"content":"<p>GeoPandas extends pandas to make working with geospatial data in Python intuitive and powerful.

In the next two subsections, you’ll install the necessary packages and read in a sample dataset of New York City borough boundaries. This gives you a concrete GeoDataFrame to explore as you learn the core concepts.</p><p>This tutorial uses two packages:  for working with geographic data and  for loading sample data. It’s a good idea to install these packages inside a <a href=\"https://realpython.com/python-virtual-environments-a-primer/\">virtual environment</a> so your project stays isolated from the rest of your system and you can manage its <a href=\"https://realpython.com/ref/glossary/dependency/\">dependencies</a> cleanly. </p><p>Using the  option ensures you have everything needed for reading data, transforming coordinate systems, and creating plots. For most readers, this will work out of the box.</p><p>If you do run into installation issues, the project’s maintainers provide alternative installation options on the <a href=\"https://geopandas.org/en/stable/getting_started/install.html\">official installation page</a>.</p><p>Most geospatial datasets come in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GeoJSON\">GeoJSON</a> or <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shapefile\">shapefile</a> format. The  function can read both, and it accepts either a local file path or a URL.</p><p>In the example below, you’ll use  to load the New York City Borough Boundaries (NYBB) dataset. The  package provides a convenient path to this dataset, so you don’t need to download anything manually. You’ll also drop unnecessary columns:</p><p> is a . A GeoDataFrame has rows, columns, and all the methods of a <a href=\"https://realpython.com/pandas-dataframe/\">pandas DataFrame</a>. The difference is that it typically includes a special  column, which stores geographic shapes instead of plain numbers or text.</p><p>The  column is a . It behaves like a normal pandas , but its values are spatial objects that you can map and run spatial queries against. In the  dataset, each borough’s geometry is a —a shape made of several polygons—because every borough consists of multiple islands. Soon you’ll use these geometries to make maps and run spatial operations, such as finding which borough a point falls inside.</p><p>Once you’ve loaded a GeoDataFrame, one of the quickest ways to understand your data is to visualize it. In this section, you’ll learn how to create both static and interactive maps. This allows you to inspect shapes, spot patterns, and confirm that your geometries look the way you expect.</p>","contentLength":3723,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Warp Speed Networking: Simplifying Decentralized Node Management with Go and Wails","url":"https://dev.to/githubopensource/warp-speed-networking-simplifying-decentralized-node-management-with-go-and-wails-emk","date":1769434889,"author":"GitHubOpenSource","guid":421525,"unread":true,"content":"<p>WarpNet is a decentralized, peer-to-peer social network built with Go, inspired by Twitter.

Notice the spike in December? Now you can investigate what changed.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Real-World Azure OpenAI Use Cases\n</h2><h3>\n  \n  \n  Scenario 1: Daily Cost Monitoring During Development\n</h3><p>You're building a new reasoning agent with o1-preview. Check costs every morning:</p><div><pre><code>azurecost  prod-subscription  DAILY  7\n</code></pre></div><div><pre><code>USD           2025-12-15  2025-12-16  2025-12-17  2025-12-18\n\ntotal                45.23        52.18       178.45        51.20\nCognitive Services   45.23        52.18       178.45        51.20\n</code></pre></div><p>Whoa, December 17th spiked to $178. That's the day you started load testing with o1-preview. Now you know exactly when and how much it costs.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Scenario 2: Environment-Based Cost Breakdown\n</h3><p>You have separate resource groups for dev, staging, and production. See costs side by side:</p><div><pre><code>azurecost  ai-subscription  ResourceGroup  ServiceName\n</code></pre></div><div><pre><code>USD                                        2025-11    2025-12\n\ntotal                                        1247.83    2891.45\nai-dev-rg/Cognitive Services                  342.15     456.32\nai-staging-rg/Cognitive Services              198.42     287.89\nai-prod-rg/Cognitive Services                 707.26    2147.24\n</code></pre></div><p>Production jumped from $707 to $2147. Time to optimize those prompts or consider GPT-4o-mini for some use cases.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Scenario 3: Focused Investigation on Production\n</h3><p>Something's wrong with production costs. Drill down to just that resource group:</p><div><pre><code>azurecost  ai-subscription  ai-prod-rg  DAILY  14\n</code></pre></div><p>See two weeks of daily costs for production only. Spot the pattern, correlate with deployments or feature releases.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Scenario 4: Multi-Region Cost Analysis\n</h3><p>Running Azure OpenAI deployments in multiple regions? Group by location:</p><div><pre><code>azurecost  global-ai-sub  Location  ServiceName\n</code></pre></div><div><pre><code>USD                                   2025-11    2025-12\n\ntotal                                   1247.83    2891.45\nEast US/Cognitive Services               823.14    1923.87\nWest Europe/Cognitive Services           424.69     967.58\n</code></pre></div><p>East US is handling most of the load. Maybe redistribute traffic or consider regional pricing differences.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Scenario 5: Resource-Level Cost Analysis\n</h3><p>Running multiple Azure OpenAI accounts for different teams or use cases? Track costs at the individual resource level:</p><div><pre><code>azurecost  ai-subscription  ResourceId\n</code></pre></div><div><pre><code>USD                                                                                     2025-12    2026-01\n\ntotal                                                                                     5741.44   16571.60\n/resourcegroups/ai/providers/microsoft.cognitiveservices/accounts/chatbot-prod           3401.80   16390.44\n/resourcegroups/ai/providers/microsoft.cognitiveservices/accounts/analytics-engine       2194.17     131.82\n/resourcegroups/ai/providers/microsoft.cognitiveservices/accounts/internal-tools          145.47      49.34\n</code></pre></div><p>This shows exactly which Azure OpenAI account is consuming credits. Perfect for:</p><ul><li>: Charge back costs to specific teams or projects</li><li><strong>Identifying cost anomalies</strong>: Spot which deployment suddenly increased spend</li><li><strong>Multi-tenant environments</strong>: Track costs per customer or tenant</li><li>: Distribute budget based on actual usage patterns</li></ul><p>Combine with daily granularity to investigate when a specific resource started costing more:</p><div><pre><code>azurecost  ai-subscription  ResourceId  DAILY  7\n</code></pre></div><h2>\n  \n  \n  Why This Matters for Azure OpenAI Users\n</h2><p>Building with Azure OpenAI is different from traditional cloud infrastructure. With VMs or databases, costs are fairly predictable. But with modern language models like GPT-4o and o1-preview, costs depend on how users interact with your application:</p><ul><li>Long conversations = more tokens = higher costs</li><li>Complex reasoning tasks = more input tokens</li><li>Detailed responses = more completion tokens</li><li>Testing and iteration = multiplied costs</li></ul><p>During active development, you need to check costs frequently. Not once a month when the bill arrives, but daily or even multiple times a day.</p><p>The Azure portal workflow kills this feedback loop:</p><ol><li>Navigate to Azure portal (wait for load)</li><li>Find the right subscription</li><li>Click through to Cost Management</li><li>Configure time range and filters</li></ol><p>By the time you see the numbers, you've burned 2-3 minutes. When you're doing this multiple times daily, the friction discourages you from checking at all.</p><p>Then you're surprised at month-end when the bill is 3x what you expected.</p><p> fixes this. Checking costs becomes as fast as checking git status:</p><div><pre><code>azurecost  ai-subscription  DAILY  7\n</code></pre></div><p>Two seconds. Real-time feedback. No context switching.</p><p>This speed changes behavior. When checking costs is instant, you actually do it. You catch issues early. You experiment with confidence because you're monitoring the impact.</p><p>The tool emerged from my own need while building AI features. I was spending too much time in the portal doing the same query repeatedly. I wanted something terminal-based that integrated into my development workflow.</p><p>What started as a personal script evolved into a proper tool that my team adopted, then others in the community found useful. The philosophy is simple: do one thing well - show Azure costs fast and clearly.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Automate Azure OpenAI Cost Monitoring\n</h2><p>The Python API lets you integrate cost tracking into your workflows. Send daily Azure OpenAI cost reports to Slack:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Run this as a daily cron job or GitHub Action. Your team gets automatic cost visibility without anyone checking the portal.</p><ul><li>: Trigger warnings when daily costs exceed thresholds</li><li>: Track which team or feature is using OpenAI credits</li><li>: Validate costs before promoting to production</li><li>: Generate reports for accounting without manual exports</li></ul><h2>\n  \n  \n  Configuration Tips for AI Workloads\n</h2><p>Set environment variables to streamline your daily checks:</p><div><pre><code>your-ai-subscription-id\nai-prod-rg\n</code></pre></div><p>Now run  with no arguments:</p><p>Create shell aliases for common queries:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Type  each morning as part of your routine. Takes 2 seconds, keeps you informed. Use  when you need to drill down to individual Azure OpenAI accounts.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Best Practices for Azure OpenAI Cost Management\n</h2><p>Based on using  with AI workloads, here are patterns that work:</p><div><pre><code>azurecost  ai-sub  DAILY  7\n</code></pre></div><p>Catch anomalies before they compound. One day of unexpected costs is manageable. A month is not.</p><p><strong>2. Before and after feature releases</strong></p><div><pre><code>\nazurecost  ai-sub  ai-prod-rg  DAILY  3\n\n\nazurecost  ai-sub  ai-prod-rg  DAILY  3\n</code></pre></div><p>Measure the cost impact of new features. Make data-driven decisions about o1-preview vs GPT-4o-mini.</p><p><strong>3. Set up automated alerts</strong>\nUse the Python API to send daily reports. Don't rely on remembering to check manually.</p><p>\nUse separate resource groups for dev, staging, production. Makes cost attribution trivial.</p><p><strong>5. Monitor during load testing</strong>\nRun  before and after load tests. Understand your cost-per-request at scale before going live.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Start Tracking Your Azure OpenAI Costs Now\n</h2><div><pre><code>azurecost  your-subscription  DAILY  7\n</code></pre></div><p>That's it.

If something is wrong, it usually fails fast.</p><p>And yet, many Go bugs don’t fail fast at all.</p><p>They quietly pass tests, survive code review, behave perfectly on your laptop, and only show up in production — under real traffic, real data, and long-running processes.</p><p>This article isn’t about exotic edge cases. It’s about bugs that look innocent, feel “Go-ish”, and still manage to hurt you in production. Especially if you’re a junior or mid-level Go developer.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Goroutines That Never Die\n</h2><p>One of the most common production issues in Go is not a crash, but slow degradation. Memory usage grows, CPU usage creeps up, and the number of goroutines keeps increasing.</p><p>Often the root cause is a goroutine that was supposed to finish — but never did.</p><p>Consider a worker reading from a channel:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>This code looks clean and idiomatic. In tests, the channel is closed properly. Locally, everything works.</p><p>In production, things are different. A producer might crash, a request might be canceled, or a code path that closes the channel might never execute. The goroutine stays alive forever, blocked on receive.</p><p>Over time, these goroutines accumulate. The service is still “up”, but it’s slowly dying.</p><p>Production-grade goroutines need an explicit lifetime. Usually that means context cancellation:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>If a goroutine doesn’t know when it should stop, it probably won’t.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Data Races That Only Exist Under Load\n</h2><p>Go’s race detector is excellent, but it’s not magic. Many race conditions simply don’t appear without real concurrency and real pressure.</p><p>A classic example is shared configuration:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>At some point, someone adds hot reload:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>This might run fine for weeks. Tests pass. The race detector stays quiet.</p><p>Then traffic grows. CPU cores are actually busy. Suddenly behavior becomes inconsistent, but nothing obviously crashes.</p><p>The problem isn’t Go. The problem is mutating shared state without synchronization. In production, concurrency is not hypothetical — it’s constant.</p><p>A safer approach is to treat configuration as immutable and swap it atomically:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Production reveals races not because it’s special, but because it’s honest.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  The Interface That Is Nil (Except It Isn’t)\n</h2><p>This is one of the most confusing bugs for people new to Go, and it often hides until a rare code path is executed in production.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>From the caller’s point of view:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>You expect nothing to happen. Instead, the error branch runs.</p><p>The reason is subtle but fundamental. An interface value in Go contains both a type and a value. Here, the value is nil, but the type is not. That makes the interface itself non-nil.</p><p>This kind of bug often appears only in production, when a rarely used error path finally executes.</p><p>The fix is simple but strict: never return a typed nil as an interface. Return a real  or a real error — nothing in between.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Timeouts That Work Locally and Fail in Production\n</h2><p>Timeouts are another classic “it worked on my machine” trap.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Locally, requests are fast.

AI agent works great... until it restarts. Then it wakes up with no idea what it was doing, why, or what matters. The persistence layer saved data. But the  — the \"what was I thinking\" — is gone.</p><p>This is the handoff problem. And if you're building agents that run across multiple sessions, it's the hardest part of the architecture to get right.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Why Handoffs Are Harder Than Persistence\n</h2><p>My <a href=\"https://dev.to/aureus_c_b3ba7f87cc34d74d49/persistence-patterns-for-ai-agents-that-survive-restarts-59ck\">previous article</a> covered what to persist: configuration, accumulated state, operational context. But persistence is storage. Handoffs are  — from your past self to your future self.</p><p>The difference matters. A database stores facts. A handoff tells a story: here's where we are, here's what matters right now, and here's what to do next.</p><p>Get persistence wrong and you lose data. Get handoffs wrong and your agent spends its first five minutes confused, re-discovering what it already knew, or worse — making decisions based on stale assumptions.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  The Four Handoff Anti-Patterns\n</h2><p>Before the solution, let's catalog the failures. I've seen (and built) all of these:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>The next session gets  and understands . Information without prioritization is noise. Your agent either parses all of it (slow, context-heavy) or gives up and starts fresh.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Just a file path. No summary, no priority, no narrative. The next session opens the file and faces the same cold-start problem, just one level deeper. This is delegation, not handoff.</p><p>No explicit handoff at all. \"The framework handles continuity.\" It doesn't. Frameworks handle data flow. They don't understand which of your 15 active tasks is urgent versus background. They don't know that the API you were calling started returning 429s and you switched strategies. They don't know  things are the way they are.</p><div><pre><code># Check the logs from 14:00-14:30 for context\n# The relevant PR is #847\n# See Slack thread from yesterday\n</code></pre></div><p>Your next session has to do forensic work to reconstruct what the previous session knew. This is fragile (logs rotate, threads get buried) and expensive (your agent burns context window on archaeology instead of work).</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  A Structured Handoff Protocol\n</h2><p>Here's what actually works. A good handoff has five layers:</p><p>The raw facts. Current values of critical variables, in a typed, validated format.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>This is the \"what\" — the current state of the world.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Layer 2: Narrative Context\n</h3><p>Three to five sentences, human-readable, explaining what happened and why the state looks the way it does.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>This is the \"why\" — the story behind the data.</p><p>What was decided, what was deferred, and what trade-offs were made.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>This prevents your next session from re-litigating resolved questions or missing deferred work.</p><p>What the next session should do first, second, and third.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Explicit priority removes the most common cold-start problem: \"I have 12 things I could do. Which one matters right now?\"</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Layer 5: Warnings and Gotchas\n</h3><p>The things that will bite the next session if nobody mentions them.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>This is institutional knowledge that exists nowhere except in the previous session's working memory.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>These come from building systems that actually use multi-session handoffs:</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  1. Handoff Loaders Fail Silently\n</h3><p>The most dangerous failure mode isn't a crash — it's a loader that  but doesn't actually populate the agent's context. The handoff file gets read. The JSON parses. But the agent starts its work loop without checking whether the loaded data made it into working memory.</p><p>: Always verify after loading. Have your agent explicitly reference handoff data in its first action. If it can't, the load failed.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><h3>\n  \n  \n  2. Redundancy Beats Optimization\n</h3><p>Don't put all your continuity in one file. Use multiple channels:</p><ul><li>: The structured handoff file</li><li>: A state.json with running totals and current values</li><li>: Human-readable journal entries</li></ul><p>If any one channel fails, the others provide enough context to recover. This sounds wasteful. It's not. The cost of a confused agent re-doing work far exceeds the cost of writing three small files.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  3. Human-Readable Beats Machine-Optimized\n</h3><p>Binary formats, compressed state, clever encodings — they all break when you need to debug at 3 AM. Make your handoffs readable by a human with a text editor. JSON with clear key names. Narrative summaries in plain language.</p><p>When something goes wrong (and it will), you want to  the handoff file and immediately understand the agent's last known state.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  4. Test With Real Restarts\n</h3><p>Write your handoff. Kill the agent. Restart it. Did it pick up where it left off? Not \"did it load the file\" — did it actually  correctly?</p><p>Most handoff bugs only surface under real restart conditions. Simulated loads in the same process don't catch issues like stale file handles, cached state that masks a bad load, or race conditions between the write and the next session's read.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Your handoff format will evolve. Your agent from two weeks ago wrote v0.8 handoffs. Your agent today expects v1.0. Without a version field, your loader silently misinterprets fields and your agent makes decisions based on misread data.</p><p>The handoff is where engineering meets epistemology. You're not just passing data — you're passing . Your future agent self needs to reconstruct enough of your current mental model to make good decisions, without having lived through the experiences that built that model.</p><p>This is fundamentally a compression problem: how do you compress a session's worth of experience into something small enough to transmit and rich enough to be useful?</p><p>The five-layer protocol works because it compresses along multiple dimensions simultaneously — facts (state), story (narrative), reasoning (decisions), action (priorities), and caution (warnings). No single layer is sufficient. Together, they give the next session what it needs to start working instead of start orienting.</p><p>Build your handoffs like you're writing a note to a colleague who's taking over your shift.

More integration code.</p><p>Each piece worked. But nothing talked to each other. Logs didn't include trace IDs. Metrics didn't match route names. Every new feature meant writing more glue code.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Configuration Was Scattered\n</h3><p>Environment variables were everywhere:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Some config came from files.

It handles extreme conditions.</p><p>Your API needs to be resilient too. It should handle panics gracefully. Shut down properly. Recover from errors.</p><p>Rivaas includes panic recovery, graceful shutdown, and health checks. Your service stays up even when things go wrong.</p><p>Rivās doesn't need much. Poor soil is fine. Little water is enough.</p><p>Your framework should be the same. It shouldn't use tons of memory. It shouldn't slow down your app.</p><p>Rivaas uses 16 bytes per request. It handles 8.4 million requests per second. You don't need huge servers to run it.</p><p>Rivās grows at different altitudes. In valleys and on peaks.

That's where the trouble starts.</p><p>I've watched AI-generated codebases accumulate the same mess developers spent decades learning to avoid—duplication everywhere, inconsistent naming, missing edge cases. Then it hit me: these are exactly the problems Robert C. Martin warned about in  almost two decades ago.</p><p>So I went back to the book, specifically Chapter 17's catalog of 66 code smells and heuristics. These aren't just relevant to AI coding—they're  relevant. AI makes exactly the mistakes Uncle Bob warned us about, just faster and at scale.</p><p>The solution? —instruction files that AI agents read before writing code. I've translated Clean Code's complete catalog into Python skills you can use today. They work in Google's Antigravity IDE, Anthropic's Claude Code, and anywhere that supports the Agent Skills standard.</p><p>Let me show you why we need this, and how to implement it.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Even Linus Torvalds Vibe Codes (Sometimes)\n</h2><p>In January 2026, Linus Torvalds revealed a side project called <a href=\"https://github.com/torvalds/AudioNoise\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">AudioNoise</a>—a digital audio effects simulator he'd been tinkering with over the holidays. The Python visualizer, he noted, was \"basically written by vibe-coding.\"</p><p>In his own words from the repo:</p><blockquote><p>\"I know more about analog filters—and that's not saying much—than I do about python. It started out as my typical 'google and do the monkey-see-monkey-do' kind of programming, but then I cut out the middle-man—me—and just used Google Antigravity to do the audio sample visualizer.\"</p></blockquote><p>The Hacker News discussion revealed two camps. Some saw it as validation: \"It's official, vibe coding is legit.\" Others noted the crucial context: Torvalds used AI for the part he lacks expertise in (Python visualization) while hand-coding the parts he knows (C and digital signal processing).</p><p>One commenter nailed it: \"There's a big difference between vibe-coding an entire project and having an AI build a component that you lack competency for.\"</p><p>Another observation cut deeper: \"If anyone on the planet knows how to do vibe coding right, it's him\"—because Torvalds spent decades mastering code review. He can spot bad code instantly. Most of us can't.</p><p>But here's what's telling: Torvalds wrote tests for his hand-coded C—numerical accuracy checks for the DSP primitives he understands. The vibe-coded Python visualizer? <strong>No tests, no type hints, and a duplicated function definition that slipped right through.</strong> The same four-line method appears twice in a row—the first an empty stub, the second the real implementation. It's textbook \"Accept All, don't read the diffs.\" The code runs fine (Python silently overwrites the first definition), but it's exactly the kind of dead code that accumulates into maintenance nightmares.</p><p>This works for Torvalds' toy project precisely. It's a throwaway learning exercise. The moment that visualizer needs to be production code, those missing guardrails become technical debt.</p><p>The same week, Torvalds rejected \"AI slop\" submissions to the Linux kernel, arguing that documentation telling people not to submit garbage won't help because \"the people who would submit it won't read the documentation anyway.\"</p><p>The lesson isn't that vibe coding is bad. It's that context matters. Skills let you define when to enforce rigor and when to let the vibes flow.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  The Data: AI Code Quality Is Getting Worse\n</h2><p>  found AI adoption shows a negative relationship with software delivery stability. The 2025 report's central finding: \"AI doesn't fix a team; it amplifies what's already there.\" Without robust control systems—strong testing, mature practices, fast feedback loops—increased AI-generated code leads to instability. Skills are exactly those control systems, encoded as instructions.</p><p> analyzed 807 GitHub repositories after Cursor adoption: +30% static analysis warnings, +41% code complexity. The speed gains were transient; the quality problems compounded.</p><p> analysis of 211 million lines of code from Google, Microsoft, Meta, and enterprise repositories found code duplication increased  with AI adoption. For the first time in their dataset, copy/pasted code exceeded refactored code.</p><p>Even  shows the gap: developers use AI in roughly 60% of their work, but can fully delegate only 0-20% of tasks. The rest requires \"thoughtful setup, active supervision, and human judgment.\"</p><p>That gap—between what AI touches and what AI can own—is exactly what skills address. The setup  the skill. The supervision  the rules.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  The Pattern: AI Recreates Classic Code Smells\n</h3><p>The research consistently identifies the same failure patterns. Here's how they map to specific Clean Code violations:</p><p><strong>Naming and Consistency Problems</strong></p><ul><li>Inconsistent variable names across similar functions</li><li>Vague names like , , </li><li>Mixing naming conventions (camelCase and snake_case)</li><li><em>Clean Code rules: N1 (descriptive names), G11 (consistency), G24 (conventions)</em></li></ul><ul><li>Copy/paste instead of extracting shared logic</li><li>Same calculation appearing in multiple places</li><li>Pattern repetition that should be abstracted</li><li><em>Clean Code rule: G5 (DRY - Don't Repeat Yourself)</em></li></ul><ul><li>No validation of input boundaries</li><li>Assumptions about data structure without verification</li><li><em>Clean Code rules: G3 (boundary conditions), G4 (don't override safeties), G26 (be precise)</em></li></ul><ul><li>Magic numbers without explanation (what does 86400 mean?)</li><li>Unused variables cluttering code</li><li>Functions mixing multiple abstraction levels</li><li><em>Clean Code rules: G12 (remove clutter), G16 (no obscured intent), G34 (single abstraction level)</em></li></ul><ul><li>Functions doing multiple things at once</li><li>Exposing internal data unnecessarily</li><li>Nested loops that could be optimized</li><li><em>Clean Code rules: G8 (minimize public interface), G30 (functions do one thing)</em></li></ul><p>These aren't arbitrary style preferences—they're the exact problems that make code hard to maintain, debug, and extend. The skills we'll build enforce these rules automatically.</p><p>The fix isn't to stop using AI. It's to give AI the explicit rules it needs to follow.</p><p>Skills are markdown files containing domain-specific instructions that AI agents read before working on your code. They follow the <a href=\"https://agentskills.io\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Agent Skills</a> open standard and work in Google Antigravity, Anthropic's Claude Code, and other compatible agents.</p><p>The architecture is called . Instead of dumping every instruction into the agent's context at once (causing what Antigravity's docs call \"Context Saturation\"), skills work in layers:</p><ol><li>: The agent sees only a lightweight menu of skill names and descriptions</li><li>: When your request matches a skill's description, the full instructions load</li><li>: Scripts and templates are read only when the task requires them</li></ol><p>This keeps the agent fast and focused. It's not thinking about database migrations when you're writing a React component.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>The  field is crucial—it's the trigger phrase. The agent semantically matches your request against all available skill descriptions to decide which ones to load. \"Enforces function best practices\" is vague. \"Use when writing or refactoring Python functions\" tells the agent exactly when to activate.</p><p>Skills can do far more than enforce coding standards—the community has built skills for Stripe integration, Metasploit security testing, voice agents, and even multi-agent startup automation. This article focuses on one specific use case: encoding Clean Code principles.</p><p>Let me show you how to translate Clean Code's catalog into working skills.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Building the Skills: Three Examples\n</h2><p>Rather than catalog all 66 rules exhaustively, I'll show you three critical categories in detail. The complete implementation is at the end.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  1. Comments (C1-C5): Code Should Explain Itself\n</h3><p>Uncle Bob is famously skeptical of comments—not because documentation is bad, but because comments rot faster than code updates.</p><p><strong>File Reference: </strong></p><div><pre><code>\n\nComments shouldn't hold metadata. Use Git for author names, change history, \nticket numbers, and dates. Comments are for technical notes about code only.\n\n\n\nIf a comment describes code that no longer exists or works differently, \ndelete it immediately. Stale comments become \"floating islands of \nirrelevance and misdirection.\"\n\n\ni += 1  # increment i\nuser.save()  # save the user\n\n\ni += 1  # compensate for zero-indexing in display\n\n\n\nIf a comment is worth writing, write it well:\n Choose words carefully\n Use correct grammar\n Don't ramble or state the obvious\n Be brief\n\n\n\nWho knows how old it is? Who knows if it's meaningful? Delete it. \nGit remembers everything.\n\n\n\nThe best comment is the code itself. If you need a comment to explain \nwhat code does, refactor first, comment last.\n</code></pre></div><h3>\n  \n  \n  2. Functions (F1-F4): Small, Focused, Obvious\n</h3><p>Functions should do one thing, do it well, and have an obvious purpose.</p><p><strong>File Reference: </strong></p><div><pre><code>\ndef create_user(name, email, age, country, timezone, language, newsletter):\n    ...\n\n\n@dataclass\nclass UserData:\n    name: str\n    email: str\n    age: int\n    country: str\n    timezone: str\n    language: str\n    newsletter: bool\n\ndef create_user(data: UserData):\n    ...\n\nMore than 3 arguments means your function is doing too much or needs \na data structure.\n\n\n\nDon't modify arguments as side effects. Return values instead.\n\n\ndef append_footer(report: Report) -&gt; None:\n    report.append(\"---Generated by System\")\n\n\ndef with_footer(report: Report) -&gt; Report:\n    return report + \"---Generated by System\"\n\n\n\nBoolean flags mean your function does at least two things.\n\n\ndef render(is_test: bool):\n    if is_test:\n        render_test_page()\n    else:\n        render_production_page()\n\n\ndef render_test_page(): ...\ndef render_production_page(): ...\n\n\n\nIf it's not called, delete it. No \"just in case\" code. Git preserves history.\n</code></pre></div><h3>\n  \n  \n  3.

Many programming languages and tools require some files to be present at the root of the project directory to work (e.g.  in typescript projects,  in golang projects). As we go on increasing the number of dependencies the number of these configuration files also increases. Most of our projects follow the same folder structure so creating the same folders and files for each project is cumbersome. </p><p>So to make our life easier we will build a CLI tool to scaffold golang projects using shell scripting. </p><p>By the end of this tutorial you should be able to understand how to write shell scripts and automate repetitive tasks like scaffolding a project.</p><p>Shell scripting is valuable for developers because it automates repetitive tasks, allowing them to focus on more strategic work, which enhances productivity. Additionally, it simplifies processes like software deployment and testing, making workflows more efficient and reducing the potential for human error.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Problems in setting up a Golang project\n</h2><p>Most golang projects follow a standard project structure which may look like this:</p><div><pre><code>project-name/\n├── cmd/\n│   └── project-name/\n│       └── main.go\n├── internal/\n├── .gitignore\n├── go.mod\n├── README.md\n├── Makefile\n└── LICENSE\n</code></pre></div><p>Creating these folders and files with same name and same content for multiple projects is really boring. </p><p>Every time you create a new project you need to run the same set of commands. e.g.</p><div><pre><code>go mod init project-name\ngit init\ninternal cmd cmd/project-name\n .gitignore\n</code></pre></div><p>This is not only slow but also prone to human error. Sometimes we may forget to initialize the go module or sometimes to create the  file. </p><p>To remove all of these mental overhead let's create  which will create the folder structure, initialize git and create a github repository with just one command.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Scaffold CLI: An Introduction\n</h2><p>Scaffold CLI will be used to setup a go project with the folder structure as shown above. It will prompt the user about what is the project name and whether they want to initialize git or not. If they want to initialize git Scaffold CLI will create a github repository with the same name and will make a commit to it.</p><p>Let's start building the CLI. </p><p>Before we start, make sure you have:</p><ul><li>Basic command line knowledge - You should be comfortable navigating directories and running commands.</li><li>Bash/Zsh shell - Available by default on macOS and Linux</li><li>GitHub CLI (optional) - Only needed if you want automatic GitHub repo creation. <a href=\"https://cli.github.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Install guide</a>.</li></ul><p>Quick check: Run these commands to verify your setup:</p><div><pre><code>go version    \ngh </code></pre></div><p><strong>GitHub CLI Authentication</strong> (one-time setup):\nIf you plan to use the git integration feature, authenticate the GitHub CLI:</p><p>Follow the prompts to authenticate via your browser. You only need to do this once.</p><p>Also change the default branch name globally as  as it is more common for new projects.</p><div><pre><code>git config  init.defaultBranch main\n</code></pre></div><h3>\n  \n  \n  Creating the file structure\n</h3><p>Create the folder in your desired location using .

The purpose of this script is to create the project folder and write some basic files. </p><p>Create the file using .</p><p>The first line of a shell script should always be</p><p>The character sequence  is called . It tells the operating system about which interpreter should it use to execute the script. In this case we are telling the OS to use the bash interpreter.</p><p>Next we need to create the project folder. We cannot use a hard coded string with the command  because the project name will be given by the user as a prompt. So to get the name of the project from the user prompt we will use arguments.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Here  represents the first argument to the script. So now we can call the script with an argument such as</p><div><pre><code>./init.sh cool-go-project\n</code></pre></div><p>This will execute the command</p><p>This will create a directory named . We can refer to more arguments like ,  and so on. If we need to refer to every argument we can use .</p><div><pre><code>// Change  to init.sh\n</code></pre></div><div><pre><code>./init.sh cool-go-project cooler-go-project not-so-cool-project\n</code></pre></div><p>Running this script will result in the execution of the command</p><div><pre><code> cool-go-project cooler-go-project not-so-cool-project\n</code></pre></div><p>Hence it will create three different folders namely , , .</p><blockquote><p>: Before executing the script you will need to give it executable permissions by running </p></blockquote><p>After the directory is created we would want to move into that directory and initialize go module and create files such as , , etc.</p><p>The full  will look like this</p><div><pre><code>\ngo mod init github.com/parthivsaikia/ README.md\n\n LICENSE\n\n\n Makefile\n</code></pre></div><p>We move into the project directory using  and then write into the files , ,  using the structure</p><p>The  operator redirects the standard output to a file. So in this case the output of  is redirected to the respective files.</p><p>After initializing the folder we need to create folders such as ,  inside the project directory. So let's write the next helper script .</p><div><pre><code>structure_folders.sh\n</code></pre></div><div><pre><code> internal cmd cmd/cmd//main.go\n</code></pre></div><p>This script will result in the following structure which is very standard for a go project.</p><div><pre><code>project-name/\n├── cmd/\n│   └── project-name/\n│       └── main.go\n├── internal/\n├── .gitignore\n├── go.mod\n├── README.md\n├── Makefile\n└── LICENSE\n</code></pre></div><p>The remaining step is to initialize git in our project directory so create a new file </p><p>This script should do the following things in order:</p><ol><li>Initialize git repository.</li><li>Create a github repository with the name same as that of the project.</li><li>Stage the changes and commit to git.</li><li>Push the changes to the remote origin.</li></ol><p>We will pass the name of the project as the argument again.</p><div><pre><code>\n\ngit init \ngh repo create origin\n\n .gitignore\n\ngit add  \ngit commit \ngit push origin main\n</code></pre></div><p>The command <code>gh repo create ${1} --public --source=. --remote=origin</code> creates a public github repository in the current directory and add it as origin.</p><p>Note that to use the github-cli you need to authenticate with Github as discussed in the prerequisites section.</p><p>We are done with the helper scripts. In the  script we will read user inputs and call the helper scripts. Create the file by running</p><p>This script should do the following tasks in order</p><ol><li>Ask the user the name of the project.</li><li>Validate if the input is empty.</li><li>If the input is empty warn the user and ask the name again.</li><li>If name is non-empty run  and  with project name as argument.</li><li>Ask user if they wants to initialize git.</li><li>If no then end the process.</li><li>If yes then run  with the project name as argument.\n</li></ol><div><pre><code> projectName\n</code></pre></div><p>To give a cool look I am adding an ascii art which will be shown when someones run Scaffold CLI. You can create your own ascii art <a href=\"https://patorjk.com/software/taag/#p=display&amp;f=Graffiti&amp;t=Type+Something+&amp;x=none&amp;v=4&amp;h=4&amp;w=80&amp;we=false\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">here</a>.</p><p>To make the ASCII art red, we use backslash escapes. Here's how it works:</p><ol><li><p>ESC Character - This is the ESC character (escape) in octal</p><ul><li>Signals the start of an escape sequence</li></ul></li><li><p>Color Code - The actual color code</p><ul><li> - Starts the CSI (Control Sequence Introducer)</li><li> - Reset all attributes (bold, underline, etc.)</li></ul></li><li><p>Your Text\nASCII art (now in red)</p></li><li><p>Reset Code - Reset to default color</p><ul><li>This prevents the red from bleeding into subsequent output</li></ul></li></ol><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>The ascii art will look like this in the terminal</p><p>We prompt the user to input the project name and store it in the variable  using the command</p><div><pre><code> projectName\n</code></pre></div><p>Now we need to validate this input by checking if it is empty. Bash provide a default conditional to check if the length of a string is empty. The syntax is</p><div><pre><code> string\n\n    True the length of string is zero.\n</code></pre></div><p>To check if the variable  is empty we can use it inside a while loop like this</p><div><pre><code> projectName\n</code></pre></div><p>We refer the variable  by . Note that the spaces around the condition  are not just necessary and not just decorative. Until this condition is false the user will be prompted to enter a non-empty project name.</p><p>Now we ask the user if they want to initialize git and store the result in the variable .</p><div><pre><code> initialiseGit\n\n initialiseGit\n</code></pre></div><p>We perform the same validation steps here too. </p><p>The helper scripts  and  needs to run always independent of the variable  so we execute them first.</p><div><pre><code>~/repos/scaffold/init.sh \n~/repos/scaffold/structure_folders.sh </code></pre></div><p>We execute the scripts  and  with the variable  as argument.</p><p>Since Scaffold CLI can be called from anywhere so we are providing the absolute location of the scripts. Change the location accordingly in your code.</p><p>We create the folder using  and then move into the newly created folder using . Then we execute  from inside of the project folder.</p><blockquote><p>: You might be confused that why are we using  again to move into the project folder when we have already move into it in the  file. This is because a script is executed in its own context, meaning that any directory changes (like cd) made within that script only apply while the script is running. Once init.sh finishes, control returns to the parent shell, reverting back to its original working directory. Therefore, if you want to ensure that your subsequent commands operate within the desired project folder, you need to issue the cd command again in your current shell. This guarantees that you are indeed in the right directory before running any further commands.</p></blockquote><p>Based on the variable  we need to execute the script .</p><div><pre><code>\n    ~/repos/scaffold/git.sh </code></pre></div><p>This is the syntax of if statement in bash. The keyword  marks the end of the if block. In this block we are checking if the variable  is equal to \"y\" i.e. if the user prompted yes when it was asked whether they want to initialize git. If that condition is true we execute the script  with the argument .</p><p>With this our CLI is complete. Make all scripts executable by running:</p><div><pre><code> +x ./init.sh\n +x ./structure_folders.sh\n +x ./git.sh\n +x ./main.sh\n</code></pre></div><p>To execute this script with just one command we need to add it as an alias in our shell config. Add this line in your shell config. Since I use zsh I will add it to . If you use bash you need to add it to .</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Adjust the location of the script according to your setup.</p><blockquote><p>NOTE: You can find out your shell by running.</p></blockquote><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Scaffold CLI is now ready to use. Let's create one project using it.</p><p>Start Scaffold CLI by running . You will see the ascii art and you will be prompted to enter the project name.</p><p>Once you give a project name you will be asked whether you want to initialize git or not. </p><p>Once you enter \"y\" the project folder will be created and the changes will be pushed to github.</p><p>Now move to the project folder by .</p><div><pre><code>~/repos/test-project main -&gt; tree\n\n├── cmd\n│&nbsp;&nbsp; └── test-project\n│&nbsp;&nbsp;     └── main.go\n├── go.mod\n├── internal\n├── LICENSE\n├── Makefile\n└── README.md\n</code></pre></div><p>You can see that the folder structure is same with the folder structure discussed above.</p><p>You can also verify the creation of the  repository in Github. </p><p>Shell scripting might seem intimidating at first, but as you've seen, it's incredibly powerful for automating everyday development tasks. What started as a simple idea—\"I'm tired of manually setting up projects\"—turned into a useful tool that saves time and reduces errors.\nThe beauty of shell scripting is that it's accessible. You don't need to learn a new programming language or install heavy frameworks. With just bash and some creativity, you can automate almost anything in your development workflow.<p>\nWhat repetitive tasks are you tired of doing manually?

These problems usually appear when teams migrate from synchronous Flask or Django applications to FastAPI without fully understanding how async architecture actually works.</p><p>This article is not a beginner’s FastAPI tutorial.</p><p>It is a practical, production-focused guide to building high-performance async backend APIs using FastAPI and SQLAlchemy 2.0, covering real-world concerns such as <a href=\"https://hashnode.com/post/cmko9bw15000302k09cuyd36t\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">async engine configuration</a>, session lifecycle management, lifespan events, connection pooling, and common failure modes.</p><p>If you are already using FastAPI (or planning a migration from Flask) and want an async architecture that scales cleanly beyond toy examples, this guide is written for you.</p><p>First, let's grab our dependencies. Notice we need an async driver (aiosqlite) because standard drivers like psycopg2 or sqlite3 are synchronous and will block your loop.</p><p>pip install fastapi uvicorn sqlalchemy aiosqlite pydantic</p><ol><li>The Database Engine (database.py)</li></ol><p>The most critical part of an async setup is the AsyncEngine.

The Models (models.py)</strong></p><p>SQLAlchemy 2.0 introduced a beautiful new way to define models using Python type hints (Mapped). No more vague Column(Integer, ...) syntax.</p><div><pre><code>from sqlalchemy.orm import Mapped, mapped_column\nfrom sqlalchemy import String, Integer, Boolean\nfrom database import Base\n\nclass Task(Base):\n    __tablename__ = \"tasks\"\n\n    id: Mapped[int] = mapped_column(primary_key=True, index=True)\n    title: Mapped[str] = mapped_column(String(50), index=True)\n    description: Mapped[str] = mapped_column(String(255), nullable=True)\n    is_completed: Mapped[bool] = mapped_column(default=False)\n</code></pre></div><p><strong>3. The Schemas (schemas.py)</strong></p><p>Pydantic handles our data validation. We keep our \"Create\" logic separate from our \"Response\" logic.</p><div><pre><code>from pydantic import BaseModel, ConfigDict\n\nclass TaskCreate(BaseModel):\n    title: str\n    description: str | None = None\n\nclass TaskResponse(TaskCreate):\n    id: int\n    is_completed: bool\n\n    # Pydantic V2 Config to read from ORM models\n    model_config = ConfigDict(from_attributes=True)\n</code></pre></div><p><strong>4. The API Endpoints (main.py)</strong></p><p>Here is where the magic happens.

Creating engines or sessions per request is a common mistake that leads to connection exhaustion and unpredictable performance.</p><p>FastAPI’s lifespan context is the recommended place to initialize the async engine and session factory, ensuring clean startup and shutdown behavior while avoiding hidden global state.</p><p>Note- SQLAlchemy 2.0 removed legacy query patterns, which is why AsyncSession no longer exposes .query().”</p><p>In the synchronous world, if the database takes 200ms to fetch those tasks, your entire server thread is blocked for 200ms. It can do nothing else.</p><p>In this Async version, while the database is fetching data (await db.execute), Python releases the control loop. Your API can accept 50 other requests during that 200ms \"wait\" time.</p><p>This is how you scale to thousands of users on a single server.</p><p>Next Step: Deploying this</p><p>Now that you have a high-performance backend, how do you deploy it? You can't just use python main.py in production. In the next article, I will show you how to containerize this with Docker and deploy it to Google Cloud Run.</p>","contentLength":6411,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Python Software Foundation: Your Python.

No keyboard. No buttons that make any sense.</p><p>This is a familiar situation if you've ever worked with microcontrollers like the ESP32. The hardware is powerful, but the very first interaction is often awkward. At some point, the device needs to connect to your Wi-Fi network, and the classic question appears:</p><p><em>\"How does a tiny device ask for Wi-Fi credentials?\"</em></p><p>Hardcoding credentials works for quick experiments, but it breaks down in the real world, every deployment would require re-flashing the firmware. Serial consoles are fine for developers, not for users who don't have USB cables or the patience for terminal commands. Mobile apps add friction and maintenance overhead, requiring separate iOS and Android versions that need constant updates.</p><p>What you want instead is simple: power on the device, connect to it once from any phone or laptop, configure it through a familiar web interface, and never think about it again. No apps to install, no cables to find, no special tools required.</p><p>This is exactly where  shine, they turn Wi-Fi provisioning into a one-time, friction-free experience that works on every platform.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  What Is a Captive Portal?\n</h2><p>If you've ever connected to Wi-Fi at a coffee shop, hotel, or airport, you've used a captive portal. </p><p>You join the network, and a web page automatically pops up asking you to log in or accept terms. </p><p>You didn't type a URL—the network guided you there by intercepting your browser traffic.</p><p>A captive portal on an embedded device works the same way:</p><ul><li>The device creates its  (acting as an access point)</li><li>The user connects from their phone or laptop (no password needed)</li><li>The device intercepts all internet requests using a </li><li>A web page  showing the configuration form</li><li>After submission, the device saves credentials and switches to normal Wi-Fi client mode</li></ul><p>The beauty of this approach is that the ESP32 can handle everything on-device. </p><p>It acts as both an access point and a web server simultaneously, with no cloud services, external infrastructure, or internet connection required during setup. It's significantly simpler than building a companion mobile app (which requires maintaining iOS and Android versions) and far more user-friendly than hardcoded credentials or serial console configuration.</p><p>For IoT products, this is often the difference between \"technically works\" and \"actually ships to customers.\"</p><p>The device goes through two distinct phases:  (captive portal) and  (Wi-Fi client).</p><p> runs the first time you power on the device, or anytime no Wi-Fi configuration exists. </p><ul><li>Creates its own temporary Wi-Fi network</li><li>Runs a DNS server that redirects all domains to itself</li><li>Runs an HTTP server that serves the configuration page</li><li>Saves user-submitted credentials to flash storage</li></ul><p> begins after successful configuration. </p><ul><li>Disables the access point</li><li>Connects to the user's Wi-Fi network as a client</li><li>Runs your actual application (fetching data, controlling hardware, etc.)</li></ul><p>The key decision happens at boot: does  exist? If yes, connect to Wi-Fi. If no, start the captive portal.</p><p>If you have already MicroPython installed on your ESP32, you are good to go and experiment with the following examples. </p><p>If not, see <a href=\"https://developer-service.blog/getting-started-with-esp32-c3-supermini-and-micropython/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">this guide</a> for more detail on how to setup an ESP32 with MicroPython.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Step 1 - Create the Wi-Fi Access Point\n</h2><p>The ESP32 creates its own Wi-Fi network using the built-in  module. This is the foundation of the entire captive portal, without the access point, users have no way to reach the configuration page.</p><p>The ESP32 has two Wi-Fi interfaces:</p><ul><li> (Access Point Interface) - Makes the ESP32 act like a router</li><li> (Station Interface) - Makes the ESP32 act like a Wi-Fi client</li></ul><p>During setup mode, we use  to create a temporary network that users can join from their phones.</p><p>In your local project, create a new file :</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Once this runs, the ESP32 broadcasts a Wi-Fi network named \"MyDevice-Setup\" and assigns itself IP address . Any device that connects to this network can communicate with the ESP32 using this IP.</p><p>You'll notice we use  (no password). This might seem insecure, but it's actually the right choice for a temporary setup network:</p><ul><li>: Some devices have issues with WPA2 on captive portals</li><li>: Users don't need to type a password</li><li><strong>Auto-detection works better</strong>: Operating systems are more likely to show the \"Sign in to network\" popup on open networks</li><li>: The AP only exists during initial setup and disappears once configured</li></ul><p>The security risk is minimal because:</p><ul><li>The network only exists during the 1-2 minutes of setup</li><li>The user is typically standing right next to the device</li><li>Once configured, the AP shuts down completely</li></ul><p>For production devices, you can add strategies like auto-disabling the AP after 10 minutes, or requiring a physical button press to re-enter setup mode.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Step 2 - Build the HTML Setup Page\n</h2><p>Before we create the HTTP server, let's build the setup page that users will see. This is the critical user-facing component, it needs to work flawlessly on every mobile device.</p><p><strong>Design Principles for Captive Portal Pages:</strong></p><ul><li>: Most users will access this from their phones</li><li>: No external CSS/JS frameworks (we don't have internet!)</li><li>: Every byte travels over a slow access point connection</li><li>: Users should immediately understand what to do</li><li>: Don't assume users type perfectly</li></ul><p>The page needs only two inputs: SSID and password. Everything else can be configured later through a different interface (if needed at all).</p><p>On your local project folder, create :</p><div><pre><code>Device SetupWi-Fi Setup\n            Wi-Fi SSID\n            \n            Password\n            Save  Connect</code></pre></div><ul><li> meta tag ensures proper scaling on mobile devices</li><li>Inline CSS keeps everything in one file (no extra HTTP requests)</li><li> prevents input overflow issues</li><li>Large touch targets (10px padding) work better on phones</li><li>Simple color scheme (#007bff) looks professional without complexity</li></ul><h2>\n  \n  \n  Step 3 - Create HTTP Server with Form Handling\n</h2><p>Now create an HTTP server that serves the HTML file and handles form submissions. </p><p>This is more complex than a typical web server because it needs to:</p><ul><li><strong>Serve the same page for any URL</strong> - Operating systems make requests to various paths like , , etc. to detect captive portals</li><li> - Parse POST data and save credentials</li><li> - Show clear messages when things go wrong</li><li> - The ESP32's networking stack is fragile, so we need careful error handling</li></ul><p>The server handles both GET requests (show the form) and POST requests (save configuration).</p><p>On your local project folder, create :</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p><strong>Key implementation details:</strong></p><p>: The  function handles URL-encoded data (the format HTML forms use). We manually decode common characters like  (space) and  (@) since MicroPython doesn't have a built-in URL decoder.</p><p>: The server reads  from the filesystem. If the file is missing, it shows an error message instead of crashing, this helps with debugging during development.</p><p>:  is critical. MicroPython's socket implementation can leak memory with persistent connections. We explicitly close every connection, even in error cases, to prevent the ESP32 from running out of sockets.</p><p>: The triple-nested try/except blocks might look excessive, but they prevent the server from crashing when:</p><ul><li>A client disconnects mid-request</li><li>The filesystem is corrupted</li></ul><p>: Notice we call  when sending responses. MicroPython's socket.send() expects bytes, not strings.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Step 4 - Add DNS Redirection (The \"Captive\" Part)\n</h2><p>To trigger the automatic \"Sign in to network\" popup on phones, we need a DNS server that redirects  to the ESP32's IP. This is the \"captive\" part of \"captive portal\", we're capturing all DNS requests.</p><p><strong>How DNS redirection works:</strong></p><p>When your phone connects to a new Wi-Fi network, it performs a \"captive portal check\" by trying to reach a known URL (like  on iOS or <code>http://connectivitycheck.gstatic.com</code> on Android). </p><ul><li>Phone asks DNS: \"What's the IP address of captive.apple.com?\"</li><li>Our DNS server lies: \"It's 192.168.4.1\" (the ESP32's IP)</li><li>Phone tries to load that page</li><li>Our HTTP server responds with the setup page</li><li>Phone realizes: \"This isn't the real captive.apple.com, must be a captive portal!\"</li><li>Phone shows the \"Sign in to network\" popup</li></ul><p>The key insight: we don't need to know which domain was requested. We just answer  with our own IP address.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p><strong>How the DNS packet parsing works:</strong></p><p>DNS packets have a specific structure. We extract:</p><ul><li> (): Unique identifier for each query, must be echoed back</li><li>:  means \"this is a response, no error\"</li><li>: The domain name the client asked about</li><li>: Our fabricated response pointing to 192.168.4.1</li></ul><p>We only respond to A-record queries (IPv4 address lookups). Other query types (AAAA for IPv6, MX for mail servers, etc.) are safely ignored.</p><p><strong>Platform compatibility notes:</strong></p><p>iOS is particularly strict about captive portal detection. The popup appears more reliably if:</p><ul><li>DNS replies are fast (our implementation is)</li><li>HTTP responses are well-formed (we use proper HTML)</li><li>The server is already running before the phone connects</li></ul><p>If the popup doesn't appear automatically, users can manually open any browser and type any URL (like ). The DNS redirection will still work, bringing them to your setup page.</p><p><strong>Important: Captive Portal Auto-Detection Limitations</strong></p><p>The automatic captive portal popup is  to appear. Whether it shows up depends on:</p><ul><li>: iOS is most reliable, Android varies by manufacturer (Samsung/Xiaomi less reliable), Windows 10/11 is hit-or-miss</li><li>: The popup only appears if DNS/HTTP checks happen within a few seconds of connecting</li><li>: If the phone previously connected to this SSID, it may skip checks</li><li>: Some phones have \"captive portal detection\" disabled in developer options</li><li>: Some mobile carriers modify captive portal behavior</li></ul><p>In real-world testing, automatic popups appear on approximately 70-80% of devices. The other 20-30% require users to manually open a browser.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Step 5 - Connect to User's Wi-Fi\n</h2><p>After saving configuration, the device needs to switch from AP mode to STA mode (Wi-Fi client). </p><p>This is the transition from \"setup\" to \"normal operation.\"</p><p><strong>The connection logic needs to be robust</strong> because Wi-Fi connections fail more often than you'd expect:</p><ul><li>Wrong password (most common)</li><li>Router configured to block new devices</li><li>5GHz vs 2.4GHz band issues (ESP32 only supports 2.4GHz)</li></ul><p>Our implementation tries for 20 seconds (20 attempts × 1 second), which is long enough for most networks but not so long that users think the device is frozen.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p><strong>Connection flow breakdown:</strong></p><ul><li>: Try to load . If it doesn't exist, return  immediately</li><li>: Turn off the access point interface (can't be AP and STA simultaneously effectively)</li><li>: Activate the station (client) interface</li><li>: Attempt to connect using saved credentials</li><li>: Check connection status every second for up to 20 seconds</li><li>: Return  if connected,  if timeout</li></ul><p><strong>Why the 20-second timeout?</strong></p><ul><li>Most successful connections happen in 2-5 seconds</li><li>Some networks with complex auth take 10-15 seconds</li><li>Anything longer probably indicates a real problem (wrong password, etc.)</li><li>20 seconds is long enough to succeed but short enough that users don't think the device is frozen</li></ul><p>Now let's create a complete  that integrates all the components. This is the entry point that decides: \"Should I start the captive portal, or connect to Wi-Fi?\"</p><ul><li>Try to connect to saved Wi-Fi</li><li>If successful → run the main application</li><li>If failed → start captive portal for (re)configuration</li></ul><p>This creates a self-healing system: if the user changes their Wi-Fi password or moves the device to a new network, it automatically falls back to setup mode.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>: This function orchestrates setup mode:</p><ul><li>Launches the DNS server in a background thread (using )</li><li>Starts the HTTP server in the foreground (which blocks indefinitely)</li></ul><p>The threading is important: both servers need to run simultaneously. The DNS server runs in the background while the HTTP server handles the main event loop.</p><p>: This is the decision point:</p><ul><li>Calls  to attempt connection</li><li>On success: runs your application code (we show a simple internet connectivity test)</li><li>On failure: starts the captive portal</li></ul><p>: The  blocks catch:</p><ul><li>: Allows clean shutdown during development</li><li>General exceptions: Reboots the device to recover from crashes</li></ul><p>Your ESP32 should have these files in its root directory:</p><div><pre><code>/\n├── main.py           # Main entry point\n├── wifi_ap.py        # Access point setup\n├── http_server.py    # HTTP server with form handling\n├── dns_server.py     # DNS server for captive portal\n├── wifi_client.py    # Wi-Fi connection logic\n└── portal.html       # Setup page HTML\n</code></pre></div><p>Breaking the code into separate modules has several advantages:</p><ul><li>: Test each component independently</li><li>: Each file has one clear purpose</li><li>: Copy  to other projects</li><li>: Easier to find and fix bugs</li></ul><p>All Python files should be in the root directory.

(And Why Do We Still Need Them?)\nLet’s start with a definition even a first-year Hogwarts student could grasp—no advanced runes required.</li></ol><p>1.1 A Wizarding Definition 📜\nA <a href=\"https://www.ersaelectronics.com/blog/panel-meters-guide\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">panel meter</a> is a magical window mounted on a circuit’s “tower” (panel or enclosure), letting you peer into its soul: voltage (magic energy levels ⚡️), current (flow of magic 🌊), power (how much magic you’re using 🔥), or temperature (heat from magical cores 🌡️).</p><p>It’s the final spell in a long incantation chain:</p><p>Sensing element: A magic detector (shunt resistor for current, RTD for temperature) that converts physical quantities into tiny magical signals 🔍.\nSignal conditioning: A potion that amplifies, filters, or isolates the signal (op amps as magic amplifiers 🧪, filters as noise-canceling charms 🧹).<p>\nConversion engine: A spell that turns the signal into something readable (analog movement as a pointer charm 🔄, ADC as a digital translation spell 📝).</p>\nDisplay: The magical window itself—needle, LED digits, or LCD—showing you the circuit’s true state 🖥️.<p>\nWhen you glance at a panel meter, you’re not just reading numbers; you’re seeing the result of a carefully tuned magical ritual ✨.</p></p><p>1.2 Panel Meters vs. Handheld Meters 🔍\nWhy not just wave a handheld multimeter (a portable magic wand 🪄) and read values? Because panel meters are the castle’s permanent sentries 🛡️:</p><p>24/7 monitoring: They stand guard even when you’re not there, like the portraits in Hogwarts hallways 🖼️.\nIntegrated magic: No extra leads, no “oops I used the wrong spell range”—they’re woven into the circuit’s fabric 🧵.<p>\nDistant visibility: Big LED digits or large analog scales can be seen from across the dungeon (control room), like the glowing runes on Dumbledore’s office door 🚪.</p>\nAlarms and communication: They can trigger warning bells (relays 🔔) or send owl post (Modbus, CAN 🦉) when magic levels go awry.<p>\nPanel meters are the control room screens of the wizarding world—quietly watching, ensuring nothing silently drifts into disaster 🚨.</p></p><p>1.3 Panel Meters vs. Analog vs. Digital ⚖️\nPanel meters come in two big houses, like Gryffindor and Slytherin, each with its own strengths:</p><p>Analog panel meters ⏳: Pure, old-school magic. A moving-coil mechanism (pointer charm) turns current into torque, with a printed scale as the spellbook 📖. No firmware, just physics—easy to spot trends (like a wand’s power fluctuating) at a glance.\nDigital panel meters 💻: Modern, tech-savvy magic. They use ADCs (digital translation spells) and microcontrollers (house-elves running the show 🧝♂️) to display numeric values. They can switch ranges, speak multiple magical languages (Modbus, CAN), and even show bargraphs like a magical progress bar 📊.<p>\nBoth houses still thrive, and both rely on carefully chosen electronic components (the wand cores of the meter world 🪄).</p></p><ol><li>How Panel Meters Fit into Real Systems\nIf a machine is a wizard’s castle 🏰, the panel meter is its tower window—letting you check on everything from magic energy levels to core temperature.</li></ol><p>2.1 The Control Panel as a Wizard’s Dashboard 🛠️\nThink of a control panel as Dumbledore’s office:</p><p><a href=\"https://www.ersaelectronics.com/blog/panel-meters-guide\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Voltage panel meters </a>⚡️: Watch the castle’s main magic supply (DC bus or AC phases) to ensure it doesn’t drop like a broken wand 🪄.<a href=\"https://www.ersaelectronics.com/blog/panel-meters-guide\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Current panel meters </a>🌊: Monitor the flow of magic to motors (like house-elves moving furniture 🧝♂️) or loads, making sure no one’s stealing magic.\nPower/energy meters 💰: Track how much magic you’re using—because even wizards have to pay for spell ingredients (electricity bills 💸).<p>\nTemperature panel meters 🌡️: Keep an eye on the castle’s core (transformers, heatsinks) to prevent it from overheating like a cauldron left on too long 🍲.</p>\nThese meters give you a quick check: “Are we roughly where we expect to be?” before you fire up your laptop (crystal ball 🔮) for deep dives.</p><p>2.2 Where Panel Meters Live 🌍\nYou’ll find panel meters in every corner of the wizarding tech world:</p><p>Industrial control panels 🏰: Hogwarts’ main control tower, managing all castle systems.\nMotor control centers (MCCs) 🧝♂️: The house-elf quarters, where each meter watches a different elf’s magic output.<p>\nPower distribution boards ⚡️: The magic energy bank, splitting power between towers.</p>\nSolar combiner boxes ☀️: Magic sunlight collectors, turning sunlight into usable energy.<p>\nAudio amplifiers 🎶: The music room, where VU meters act as rhythm charms, showing sound magic levels 🎵.</p>\nIn many cases, the panel meter is the only window the operator looks through every day 👀.</p><p>2.3 Panel Meters and Wizarding Standards 📜\nSince panel meters touch dangerous magic (mains voltages), they follow strict rules from the Ministry of Magic (safety standards):</p><p>Isolation and creepage 🛡️: Like a magic shield, preventing dangerous magic from leaking out.\nMeasurement categories (CAT II, CAT III) 🎯: Spell levels that determine how much magic the meter can handle safely.<p>\nAccuracy classes 🎯: How precise the meter’s magic is—±1% is like a well-practiced spell, ±0.5% is a master-level incantation ✨.</p>\nEMC immunity 🧹: Resistance to dark magic (electromagnetic interference) that could warp readings.<p>\nThese rules directly affect which components are used: high-voltage resistors as magic insulators 🧱, isolation amplifiers as shield charms 🛡️, and TVS diodes as lightning protection ⚡️.</p></p><ol><li>Inside Panel Meters: Electronic Components Doing the Real Magic\nPull off the bezel (window frame) and you’ll find a cast of magical characters working together 🧙♂️:</li></ol><p>3.1 Sensing and Scaling: Magic Detectors and Spell Scalers 🔍\nBefore anything can be displayed, the circuit’s magic must be tamed:</p><p>Voltage meters ⚡️: Use resistor dividers (magic scaling spells) to turn high-voltage magic (300V) into a safe, readable signal (0–1V). High-value resistors act as magic insulators, limiting current flow 🧱.\nCurrent meters 🌊: Shunt resistors (magic current mirrors) turn DC current into millivolts, while current transformers (CTs) are AC-only magic lenses that focus current into a manageable signal 🔍.<p>\nProcess signals (4–20 mA) 📡: Burden resistors convert current signals into voltage, like turning a snake’s hiss into a readable message 🐍.</p>\nA cheap shunt or noisy divider is like a faulty magic detector—it’ll give you false readings before the ADC even wakes up 😴.</p><p>3.2 Signal Conditioning: Potions and Charms 🧪\nOnce the signal is captured, it needs to be refined:</p><p>Op amps 🧪: Magic amplifiers that boost tiny signals (like a whisper to a shout) or buffer them to prevent loss. Precision op amps are like master potions, delivering consistent results.\nFilters 🧹: Noise-canceling charms (RC low-pass filters) that smooth out fluctuations, like calming a restless boggart 🐺.<p>\nIsolation components 🛡️: Shield charms (isolation amplifiers, optocouplers) that separate high-voltage magic from low-voltage circuits, preventing dark magic from spreading 👻.</p>\nIf a meter claims high accuracy, you can bet the designer spent hours picking the right op amps and resistors—like Snape perfecting a potion 🧪.</p><p>3.3 Conversion: Pointer Charms vs. Digital Translation 🔄\nAnalog and digital meters diverge here, like wizards choosing between wands and crystal balls 🔮:</p><p>Analog meters ⏳: Pure physical magic. A moving-coil mechanism turns current into torque, with a spring as a reset charm 🔄. The scale printing is the spellbook—no firmware needed 📖.\nDigital meters 💻: Use ADCs (digital translation spells) to turn analog signals into numbers. Sigma-delta ADCs are like advanced translation spells, delivering high precision, while reference ICs act as magic benchmarks to ensure accuracy 🎯.<p>\nA bad ADC is like a house-elf mixing up spell ingredients—it’ll give you readings that wander like a confused time traveler ⏳.</p></p><p>3.4 Processing and Logic: House-Elves and Spell Drivers 🧝♂️\nModern digital meters have tiny house-elves (microcontrollers) running the show:</p><p>MCU responsibilities 🧠: Reading ADC values, casting calibration spells, driving displays, and sending owl post (Modbus, CAN 🦉).\nDisplay drivers 🖥️: Magic spellbooks that control LED/LCD segments, using I²C/SPI to simplify wiring—like a house-elf organizing your wand collection 🪄.<p>\nEven basic LED meters get their smarts from this tiny team 🧑🤝🧑.</p></p><p>3.5 Power and Protection: Magic Shields and Energy Sources ⚡️\nPanel meters live in the real world, where surges and miswiring are common:</p><p>Power supplies 🔋: AC-DC modules or flyback converters turn mains magic into usable energy for the meter, like a magic stone that powers your wand 🪄.\nProtection components 🛡️: TVS diodes (lightning charms) zap surges, fuses (overload charms) break the circuit if magic levels get too high, and NTCs (cooling charms) soften inrush currents ❄️.<p>\nA meter without protection is like a wizard without a wand—defenseless against dark magic 👻.</p></p><ol><li>Analog Panel Meters: Retro Needles, Real Insight ⏳\nIt’s 2025, and analog panel meters are still around—like old wands that never lose their charm 🪄.</li></ol><p>4.1 Why Analog Meters Refuse to Die 🧙♂️\nThey’re the reliable house-elves of the meter world:</p><p>Instant trend reading 📈: You can tell at a glance if magic levels are rising or falling, like watching a wand’s glow brighten or dim ✨.\nNo firmware, no crashes 🚫: Just pure physics—no need to worry about spell errors or OS updates 🖥️.<p>\nRobust to EMI 🧹: Dark magic (electromagnetic interference) can’t easily warp their readings, like a shield charm against boggarts 🐺.</p>\nIn a world of digital screens, analog meters bring a vintage lab aesthetic—like the old potion bottles in Snape’s dungeon 🧪.</p><p>4.2 The Moving-Coil Mechanism: Pure Magic 🛠️\nInside an analog DC meter:</p><p>A small coil sits in a magnetic field (like a wand in a magic circle 🔄).\nCurrent through the coil generates torque, turning the pointer (like a wand moving on its own 🪄).<p>\nA spring provides restoring force, pulling the pointer back to zero (like a wand returning to its owner 🧙♂️).</p>\nKey components: Fine copper coil wire (wand core 🪄), stable magnet (magic stone 💎), and jewel bearings (smooth movement charm ✨).</p><p>4.3 Advantages and Trade-Offs ⚖️\nPros:</p><p>Instant visual feedback, like a wand’s glow changing with power ✨.\nSimple, no software to debug 🚫.<p>\nInexpensive, like a basic wand from Ollivanders 🛒.</p>\nCons:</p><p>Limited precision—you can’t read exact magic levels like you can with a digital spell 🎯.\nFixed scale: One function, one range (usually), like a wand that only casts one spell 🪄.<p>\nStill, for many panels and audio gear, analog meters are the perfect blend of style and substance 🎨.</p></p><ol><li>Digital Panel Meters: From Basic 7-Segment to Smart Mini-HMIs 💻\nDigital panel meters are the tech-savvy wizards of the meter world—using firmware and microcontrollers to do more than just display numbers.</li></ol><p>5.1 What Makes a Panel Meter “Digital”? 🎯\nA digital meter uses an ADC and a house-elf (MCU) to display numeric values. You’ll see:</p><p>3½-digit, 4½-digit, or higher resolution (like advanced spell levels 🧙♂️).\nLED digits (glowing magic numbers ✨) or LCDs (crystal clear displays 🔮).<p>\nButtons or menus to switch ranges, set alarms, or cast calibration spells 🧪.</p>\nUnder the hood, they’re tiny embedded systems—like mini versions of the computers that run whole castles 🏰.</p><p>5.2 Types of Digital Panel Meters 📊\nCommon categories include:</p><p>Digital voltmeters (DVMs) ⚡️: Magic windows for voltage levels, like checking your wand’s energy 🔋.\nMultifunction power meters 💰: All-in-one magic tools that show voltage, current, power, and energy—like a wand that casts multiple spells 🪄.<p>\nTemperature meters 🌡️: For thermocouples or RTDs, like a magic thermometer for potion cauldrons 🧪.</p>\nProcess meters 📡: For 4–20 mA signals, like reading a house-elf’s work progress 🧝♂️.<p>\nEach type has its own front-end magic (sensors, signal conditioning) and calibration spells 🧪.</p></p><p>5.3 Firmware Features: Smart Magic Tricks ✨\nModern digital meters aren’t just displays—they’re mini control centers 🛠️:</p><p>Peak/hold 📈: Stores the highest magic level, like a memory charm for your wand’s maximum power 🧠.\nAlarm setpoints 🚨: Triggers a warning bell (relay) when magic levels go too high or low, like a security charm for your castle 🏰.<p>\nCommunication 🦉: Sends owl post via Modbus, CAN, or Ethernet, letting you monitor magic levels from across the castle 🌍.</p>\nThis is all orchestrated by the MCU—like a house-elf running multiple tasks at once 🧝♂️.</p><p>5.4 Accuracy and Resolution 🎯\nNumbers matter in the wizarding world:</p><p>Resolution 📊: How many digits the meter can display (4½-digit = 19999 counts, like a spell with 19999 variations ✨).\nAccuracy 🎯: How close the reading is to the true value—±0.1% is like a master wizard’s spell, ±1% is a well-practiced incantation 🧙♂️.<p>\nTemperature drift 🌡️: How readings change with heat, like a wand’s power fluctuating in the sun ☀️.</p>\nHigh-accuracy meters use precision resistors, low-drift op amps, and tight calibration—like a wizard spending years perfecting a spell 🧙♂️.</p><ol><li>Choosing Panel Meters: Specs That Actually Matter 🛒\nPicking a panel meter is like choosing a wand at Ollivanders—you need the right fit for your mission 🎯.</li></ol><p>6.1 Measurement Type and Range 🎯\nFirst question: What magic do you need to monitor?</p><p>Voltage (AC/DC), current (AC/DC), power, temperature, or process signals?\nWhat’s the maximum magic level? A 0–10V meter won’t work for a 300V castle supply, like a basic wand can’t cast Avada Kedavra 🪄.<p>\nCheck if the meter can scale (adjust spell ranges) for CT/VT ratios or custom sensors—like a wand that adapts to your magic style 🧙♂️.</p></p><p>6.2 Input Impedance and Burden 🔌\nVoltage meters ⚡️: Higher input impedance (≥1 MΩ) means less magic is drained from the circuit, like a wand that doesn’t steal your energy 🧠.<p>\nCurrent meters 🌊: The burden (resistance) affects CT accuracy—too high, and the CT’s magic will warp, like a spell cast with a broken wand 🪄.</p>\nGood meters use precision resistor networks and input buffers to control these parameters 🛠️.</p><p>6.3 Accuracy and Class 🎯\nAnalog meters ⏳: Class 1.0 means ±1% accuracy, like a spell that hits its target 99% of the time 🎯.<p>\nDigital meters 💻: Accuracy listed as ±(X% of reading + Y counts) accounts for both percentage error and fixed digit error.</p>\nFor billing or lab work, go for ±0.5% or better—like a master wizard’s spell that never misses 🧙♂️.</p><p>6.4 Display and Readability 👀\nBeyond numbers, ask:</p><p>How big are the digits? 20mm digits can be seen from across the dungeon, like glowing runes on a castle wall ✨.\nWhat’s the viewing angle?
