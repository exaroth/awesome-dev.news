He explains Venice's unbundled architecture where each component—from Kafka-based pub/sub to RocksDB-powered servers—operates as an independent distributed system. Félix details their rigorous chaos engineering practices, including regular load tests that push data centers beyond normal capacity to ensure reliability.\n\nThe discussion covers fundamental distributed systems concepts like the CAP theorem and the trade-offs between consistency and availability in multi-region deployments. He also explains why Venice, as a derived data system, deliberately sacrifices strong consistency for high throughput and availability, and concludes by discussing their experimental integration of DuckDB for SQL-based analytics and data exploration capabilities.\n\nTIMECODES\n00:00 Intro\n00:55 The architecture of Venice: An unbundled database\n06:09 Multi-region reliability &amp; chaos engineering\n09:54 Data flow: Writing &amp; reading in Venice\n15:15 Understanding the CAP Theorem\n22:34 Integrating DuckDB: Adding SQL capabilities\n27:31 Outro\n\nRECOMMENDED BOOKS\nKasun Indrasiri &amp; Danesh Kuruppu • gRPC: Up and Running • https://amzn.to/3sBGBJJ\nTomer Shiran, Jason Hughes &amp; Alex Merced • Apache Iceberg: The Definitive Guide • https://amzn.to/488Z30k\nWilliam Smith • Arrow Flight Protocols and Practices • https://amzn.to/4o2Q2fd\nAdi Polak • Scaling Machine Learning with Spark • https://amzn.to/3N9vx1H\nMark Needham, Michael Hunger &amp; Michael Simons • DuckDB in Action • https://amzn.to/45QwSli\nSimon Aubury &amp; Ned Letcher • Getting Started with DuckDB • https://amzn.to/3VPk4q\n\nhttps://bsky.app/profile/gotocon.com\nhttps://twitter.com/GOTOcon\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/company/goto-\nhttps://www.instagram.com/goto_con\nhttps://www.facebook.com/GOTOConferences\n#VeniceDB #RocksDB #DuckDB #ApacheKafka #ApacheHelix #ApachePinot #ApacheIceberg #Zookeeper #OpenSource #DatabaseDevelopment #CAPTheorem  #DistributedSystems #DistributedData #DataProcessing #Programming #TodayInTech #FelixGV #OlimpiuPop\n\nCHANNEL MEMBERSHIP BONUS\nJoin this channel to get early access to videos &amp; other perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCs_tLP3AiwYKwdUHpltJPuA/join\n\nLooking for a unique learning experience?\nAttend the next GOTO conference near you!

The discussion reveals that effects are composable operations that encapsulate side effects and defer execution, giving developers the right handles to manage unpredictability through compiler-checked types.\nThe authors explain how ZIO tracks three critical types: outputs, failures, and environmental requirements, enabling better testing with mock clocks and random number generators.\n\nThey share their intentional avoidance of intimidating functional programming terminology like \"monads\" proving you don't need mathematical foundations to understand effects. The conversation covers effect systems' expansion beyond Scala into TypeScript, Kotlin, and new languages like Unison and Roc, and how their collaborative writing process with strict constraints like 47-character line limits - created a coherent 100-page book readable in portrait mode on your phone.\n\nTIMECODES\n00:00 Intro\n03:33 From 250 pages to 100: The art of distillation\n09:38 What are effects, really?\n13:58 Managing unpredictability with the right tools\n18:37 Beyond Scala: The growing effect oriented ecosystem\n29:58 Forbidden words &amp; mathematical foundations\n33:08 Collaboration &amp; constraints\n36:08 Outro\n\nRECOMMENDED BOOKS\nBill Frasure, Bruce Eckel, James Ward • Effect Oriented Programming • https://amzn.to/4sO6wLV\nBruce Eckel &amp; Svetlana Isakova • Atomic Kotlin • https://amzn.to/4qT1gEQ\nBruce Eckel • Thinking in C++ • https://amzn.to/4qnrIGW\nAndrew Harmel-Law • Facilitating Software Architecture • https://amzn.eu/d/5kZKVfU\nSam Keen • Clean Architecture with Python • https://amzn.to/4pBT5g0\nEric Evans • Domain-Driven Design • https://amzn.to/3tnGhwm\nMaciej «MJ» Jedrzejewski • Master Software Architecture • https://leanpub.com/master-software-architecture\n\nhttps://bsky.app/profile/gotocon.com\nhttps://twitter.com/GOTOcon\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/company/goto-\nhttps://www.instagram.com/goto_con\nhttps://www.facebook.com/GOTOConferences\n#EffectOrientedProgramming #Scala #ZIO #Kotlin #Roclang #Unisonlang #TypeScript #SoftwareEngineering #FunctionalProgramming #Programming #TodayInTech #BillFrasure #BruceEckel #JamesWard #AndrewHarmelLaw #BookClub\n\nCHANNEL MEMBERSHIP BONUS\nJoin this channel to get early access to videos &amp; other perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCs_tLP3AiwYKwdUHpltJPuA/join\n\nLooking for a unique learning experience?\nAttend the next GOTO conference near you!
