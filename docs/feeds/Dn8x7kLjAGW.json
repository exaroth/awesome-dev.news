GitHub Copilot now lives in more places than just your IDE. It's in your terminal, your browser, and in your pull requests. It can learn your entire codebase and help you understand it.\n\nIn this session, we'll look at what Copilot is, what it's become, and how it works. We'll run through the software engineering lifecycle from idea to production and highlight all the areas where tools like Copilot can save you time and effort. Finally, we'll talk about how GitHub Copilot was created, how it's being improved, and a little about the future of AI tooling.

Efficiency is ruining our happiness, and weirdly, it’s also ruining our efficiency. Heeeeelppp!? What’s a techie to do? Zombie servers and slow code are a big climate problem, but the vrrrooom model gives us double-win hope. Holly walks through a range of techniques that can be used to find and eliminate software waste and reduce climate impacts.\n\nBut machine efficiency isn’t much use without human efficiency. Surprisingly, sorting out machine efficiency often helps humans, too. For example, the Quarkus Java framework uses many interesting waste-reduction techniques. These optimisations have the dual benefit of speeding up computers, and also speeding up people.\n\nSo far, so good, but we need to be careful we don’t end up accidentally optimising the wrong things, and making stuff worse. 100% utilisation is not sustainable for either humans, or people. It’s not even very efficient (what!?). Holly gives a brief tour of the brain’s default mode network, the latest business research, and queueing theory, to show why we actually achieve more when we do a bit less.

One reason why it might still fail is because it could be that you are dealing with a badly calibrated model. The predictions might be fine, but the probability estimates can be way off. \n\nIn this video we talk about how to think about calibration and what it means.\n\n\nWebsite: https://probabl.ai/\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/probabl\nTwitter: https://x.com/probabl_ai\nBluesky: https://bsky.app/profile/probabl.bsky.social\nDiscord: https://discord.probabl.ai\n\nWe also host a podcast called Sample Space, which you can find on your favourite podcast player.

Moving beyond traditional business storytelling, the interview explores how mapping enables better strategic decision-making through understanding component evolution, inertia, and gameplay, while also addressing current technological shifts in AI and cyber-physical systems.

But what happens when you ?</p><h4><strong>Scenario 1: Adding a New Server (S5)</strong></h4><p>As traffic increases, you decide to  by adding a new backend server ().
