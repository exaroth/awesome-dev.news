As AI-driven coding becomes more prevalent, this gap will only widen, making investment in proper debugging education and tools not just beneficial but essential for the future of software development.\n\nTIMECODES\n00:00 Intro\n02:53 Revolutionizing tech education: The executable book format\n11:17 What \"The Debugging Book\" teaches\n16:01 Interactive debuggers &amp; advanced techniques\n21:31 Python as the language of choice\n26:53 Tracking dependencies &amp; Delta Debugging\n34:55 Automated software repair &amp; testing\n51:09 Outro\n\nRECOMMENDED BOOKS\nAndreas Zeller • The Debugging Book • https://www.debuggingbook.org\nSy Brand • Building a Debugger • https://amzn.to/4cWWr84\nCharles Humble • Professional Skills for Software Engineers • https://www.conissaunce.com/professional-skills-shortcut\nCathy O'Neil • Weapons of Math Destruction • https://amzn.to/42jYkba\nJonathan B.

We'll start with a quick look at the different attempts at model fine-tuning (along with what eventually worked well for us), then look at the middleware, how we integrate in-house and external models, steps to protect privacy, and finally, some truly questionable frontend code (or truly great frontend code if we finish the rewrite in time—you never know).\n\nIf you love the American healthcare system as it stands today, this is probably not the talk for you. For those ambivalent about the healthcare system, that's totally fine; you can still see what it takes to bring an ML system from drinks at a bar all the way through to production.

From battling context-switching nightmares to creating communication magic, Flavia and Hannes explore actionable insights on scaling support without losing your sanity.\n\nThe twist? Their ultimate goal is to make support so seamless that dedicated teams won't even be needed.

It so perfectly models the problem at hand that even a trained house cat could generate business value. You just have one problem, your interpreter runs 100x slower than a shell script launching JVMs in a loop.\n\n#DomainSpecificLanguages (DSLs) are able to offer the abstraction benefits of a high-level language, while when compiled, competing with low-level languages on performance. Because DSLs have a much smaller problem area, many specialised optimisations can be performed which are not feasible for a general purpose language.\n\nIn this talk, we will explain a number of optimisations which are useful for DSLs, and show our solutions to the practical issues we faced when implementing them in our #QueryLanguage, #Icicle.\n\nIcicle is a query language for processing large amounts of time-series data. Its type system enforces that queries require only a single pass over the data, and that multiple queries over the same data can be fused together. By using a combination of high level optimisations such as partial evaluation and common subexpression elimination, and low level optimisations such as parsing code which is specialised for the given input, our queries are faster than the equivalent hand-written C code.\n\nFrom this talk, the audience will learn how the focused point of view that DSLs provide can be useful in performance critical systems, as well as a number of concrete techniques for optimising their own DSLs.\n\nRECOMMENDED BOOKS\nKenneth E.
