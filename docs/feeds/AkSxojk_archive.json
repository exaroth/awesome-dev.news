The conversation explores how Java programming has evolved from Java 5 to Java 25, covering major shifts like the move toward immutability, the introduction of sequenced collections, streams, and unmodifiable collections.\n\nThey delve into critical design topics including encapsulation of collections, the anemic domain model anti-pattern, the controversial unsupported operation exception, and the challenges of null handling. The book includes new chapters on usage guidance and design retrospectives that reflect decades of accumulated wisdom about the Collections Framework.\n\nTIMECODES\n00:00 Intro\n01:19 A 19-year journey from Java 5 to Java 25\n04:41 The shift toward immutability &amp; unmodifiable collections\n07:08 Usage guidance: Ownership &amp; the anemic domain model\n17:58 Extension points &amp; the fragile base class problem\n20:41 Design retrospective: The unsupported operation exception controversy\n27:11 The Null handling mess\n29:09 A lasting achievement\n30:21 Outro\n\nRECOMMENDED BOOKS\nMaurice Naftalin &amp; Philip Wadler ‚Ä¢ Java Generics and Collections 2nd ed ‚Ä¢ https://amzn.to/47dOp9t\nMaurice Naftalin &amp; Philip Wadler ‚Ä¢ Java Generics and Collections 1st ed ‚Ä¢ https://amzn.to/42JI03i\nJoshua Bloch ‚Ä¢ Effective Java ‚Ä¢ https://amzn.to/4oFbdoi\nVictor Grazi &amp; Jeanne Boyarsky ‚Ä¢ Real-World Java ‚Ä¢ https://amzn.to/4oCEeBR\nKevlin Henney &amp; Trisha Gee ‚Ä¢ 97 Things Every Java Programmer Should Know ‚Ä¢ https://amzn.to/3kiTwJJ\nChristian Clausen ‚Ä¢ Five Lines of Code ‚Ä¢ https://amzn.to/3s2zjyg\nNicolai Parlog ‚Ä¢ The Java Module System ‚Ä¢ https://amzn.to/3xFggR4\n\nhttps://bsky.app/profile/gotocon.com\nhttps://twitter.com/GOTOcon\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/company/goto-\nhttps://www.instagram.com/goto_con\nhttps://www.facebook.com/GOTOConferences\n#Java #JavaGenerics #JavaCollections #Immutability #Unmodifiability #Encapsulation #Java25 #Java5 #Null #NullHandling #Getters #Setters #AnemicDomainModel #JavaProgramming #TodayInTech #SoftwareDevelopment #SoftwareEngineering #Programming #MauriceNaftalin #StuartMarks #PhilipWadler #BookClub\n\nCHANNEL MEMBERSHIP BONUS\nJoin this channel to get early access to videos &amp; other perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCs_tLP3AiwYKwdUHpltJPuA/join\n\nLooking for a unique learning experience?\nAttend the next GOTO conference near you!

Software engineer Flavia Circiumaru and host Hannes Lowette dive deep into how this London-based regulatory compliance company transformed from a support-free-for-all to a streamlined powerhouse.\n\nFlavia Circiumaru reveals the behind-the-scenes story of building a three-desk support system that turned their support team into the ultimate connector, bridging customers, developers, and business teams like never before. From battling context-switching nightmares to creating communication magic, Flavia and Hannes explore actionable insights on scaling support without losing your sanity.\n\nThe twist? Their ultimate goal is to make support so seamless that dedicated teams won't even be needed.
