This has happened throughout computing history, with the computer terminal, with early smartphones, and now it's happening again with AI.\n\nAt tldraw, we’ve been working on moving AI interaction away from the chat-based interface, towards a richer canvas environment. It hasn't been easy! I'll show you all the challenges we've faced, and how we're currently overcoming them. Some of the solutions have been surprising.

If not, your colleague most probably is. Either way, this talk is for you.\n\nIn this session, Katrine will shine a light on neurodiversity and the transformative impact it can have on your life, your team, and your business.\n\nNeurodiversity is not only abundantly prevalent in tech organizations; it is a powerful, often underutilized asset that manifests in every corner of our work environments. It is paramount that we adjust our understanding and strategies around this diversity to thrive. Katrine will explore how neurodiversity shows up in the most unexpected ways and why it’s both surprisingly easy and surprisingly challenging to harness its potential in team collaboration and leadership.\n\nThis talk will emphasize practical daily strategies to strengthen collaboration and leverage the advantages of neurodiversity in everyday work contexts, whether it’s adopting clear communication methods, allowing flexible work arrangements, or designing team workflows that play to diverse cognitive strengths.

We'll discuss the key benefits of using Apache Iceberg tables in your data lake such as schema evolution, ACID transactions, hidden partitioning, time traveling and efficient querying.\n\nNext, we'll dive into how to efficiently stream data from Kafka into Iceberg-based data lakes. Confluent Tableflow will be introduced as a potential solution for streamlining the ingestion of Kafka streams into Iceberg tables within your data lake. A live demo will showcase the seamless integration of Kafka with Iceberg, equipping participants with practical knowledge to enhance their data architectures for powerful real-time analytics.\n\n• The role of Kafka in real-time data streaming\n• Why Apache Iceberg is essential for data lakes and data warehouses\n• Iceberg fundamentals: Core concepts and key features\n• Streaming data from Kafka to Iceberg tables in data lakes\n• Use case: Leveraging Confluent Tableflow to stream Kafka data into data lakes and warehouses [...]\n\nTIMECODES\n00:00 Intro\n01:10 Overview\n02:06 Kafka is the standard for operational data\n03:41 Iceberg for analytical data in data lakes\n04:42 Apache Iceberg\n05:27 Why Iceberg?\n12:24 Structure of an Iceberg table\n16:40 Streaming to data lakes is complicated\n20:47 Tableflow materialize Kafka topics as Iceberg tables\n23:47 Demo\n35:37 Outro\n\nDownload slides and read the full abstract here:\nhttps://gotochgo.com/2024/sessions/3370\n\nRECOMMENDED BOOKS\nKasun Indrasiri &amp; Sriskandarajah Suhothayan • Design Patterns for Cloud Native Applications • https://amzn.to/3szGx0p\nKasun Indrasiri &amp; Danesh Kuruppu • gRPC: Up and Running • https://amzn.to/3sBGBJJ\nKasun Indrasiri &amp; Prabath Siriwardena • Microservices for the Enterprise • https://amzn.to/40FhxkQ\nKasun Indrasiri • Beginning WSO2 ESB • https://amzn.to/3sx9NF0\n\nhttps://bsky.app/profile/gotocon.com\nhttps://twitter.com/GOTOcon\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/company/goto-\nhttps://www.instagram.com/goto_con\nhttps://www.facebook.com/GOTOConferences\n#ApacheKafka #Kafka #ApacheIceberg #Iceberg #AmazonAthena #DataStreaming #DataLake #DataWarehouse #ACIDTransactions #KafkaStreams #Confluent #Tableflow #ConfluentTableflow #KasunIndrasiri\n\nCHANNEL MEMBERSHIP BONUS\nJoin this channel to get early access to videos &amp; other perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCs_tLP3AiwYKwdUHpltJPuA/join\n\nLooking for a unique learning experience?\nAttend the next GOTO conference near you!

They explore the importance of short feedback loops, iterative learning, and adaptability in different phases of product development, as outlined in Beck’s 3X model (Exploration, Expansion, Extraction).\n\nKent introduces radical techniques like Test &amp;&amp; Commit || Revert (TCR) and Limbo, which challenge traditional coding and collaboration practices by emphasizing tiny, safe iterations. The conversation ties in psychological safety, a key factor in high-performing teams, as outlined by Amy C. Edmondson.\n\nKent envisions a future where software development scales in real-time, pushing teams to embrace faster experimentation, responsibility, and continuous learning in a rapidly evolving tech landscape.
