You’ll learn the counter-intuitive concepts hidden in the term and why really using them is so hard. You’ll learn about techniques that will ultimately help you find smaller successful releases, test your ideas faster, develop higher quality software more predictably, and release more confidently than ever before. Because hidden in this nasty little term are clues that can help you do all that.\n\nJeff Patton helps companies adopt a way of working that’s focused on building great products, not just building stuff faster. Jeff blends a mixture of Agile thinking, Lean and Lean Startup Thinking, and UX Design and Design Thinking to end up with a holistic product-centric way of working. Jeff is author of the bestselling O’Reilly book User Story Mapping which describes a simple holistic approach to using stories in Agile development without losing sight of the big picture.

Additionally, we implemented centralized policy management for each client using OPA (Open Policy Agent) and policy language, significantly improving maintenance efficiency.\n\nThis session will provide practical and scalable design strategies and implementation methods for building robust systems that address authorization strategies using OPA.</article>","contentLength":1462,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/v/lTEgUizqTg4?version=3","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Sponsored Keynote: Hitachi’s Keycloak Journey - Evolution of Business and Community - Michito Okai","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUR9_gZZOfY","date":1750427381,"author":"CNCF [Cloud Native Computing Foundation]","guid":163580,"unread":true,"content":"<article>Don't miss out!

According to the MCP specification, OAuth 2.1 needs to be used for that, which implies that there is the possibility of using Keycloak for end user authentication and authorization because Keycloak supported OAuth 2.1.\n\nFirstly, Takashi talks about MCP briefly and describes end user authentication and authorization of MCP in more detail.

It is often lauded for its approach to memory safety, particularly through making previously implicit concepts like data ownership explicit. On top of it comes a powerful reference validation system, the borrow checker.\n\nHowever, Rust is often reduced to those two concepts. This talk will give an accessible overview to using Rust core principles - Ownership and Borrowing - together with other, lesser known concepts of the language to build safe and efficient APIs.\n\nFor Rust practicioners, this talk gives insight into known concepts in more detail. It does so by looking at examples from the Rust standard library first and foremost. For people who don't practice Rust regularly, it gives an insight into properties of the language that are less spoken about.
