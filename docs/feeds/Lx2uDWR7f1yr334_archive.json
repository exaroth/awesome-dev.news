The approach presented here addresses these needs by creating a unified system where configuration metadata lives alongside the configuration values themselves. This creates a single source of truth that eliminates duplication and reduces the chance of documentation drift.</p><p>: Configuration fields are defined once with all metadata (validation, documentation, defaults); and can be easily extended.</p><p><strong>Default Value Definition with Build Flags</strong>: Production apps are often built for different environments, therefore some default configuration values must be defined by Go .</p><p>: Viper support for YAML, JSON, TOML, HCL, and ENV configuration files.</p><p>: Seamless integration with Cobra for command-line interfaces, data validation, and auto-completion.</p><p>: Strongly typed configuration with validation by Go Validator tags, custom functions, and literals.</p><p>: Automatic binding with configurable prefix.</p><p>: Built-in help and documentation generation.</p><p>Our application is called , and it uses two groups of configuration: application base parameters, like logging and updates, and network configuration, like proxies. The architecture demonstrates how to organize configuration fields into logical groups, making it easy for users to understand and manage related settings together. Each field carries its complete metadata, ensuring that validation rules, documentation, and defaults are always consistent across the entire application.</p><p>Users are expected to use the CLI to configure the application, like:</p><div><pre><code>confapp config .level debug .auto </code></pre></div><div><table><thead><tr></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Application environment (hidden)</td></tr><tr><td>Logging level (debug, info, warn, error)</td></tr><tr></tr><tr></tr><tr></tr></tbody></table></div><div><table><thead><tr></tr></thead><tbody><tr></tr><tr></tr></tbody></table></div><p>The implementation follows a modular approach where each component has a specific responsibility. The configuration module defines the fields and their metadata, Viper handles the actual storage and retrieval of values, and Cobra provides the user interface. This separation of concerns makes the system maintainable and allows each component to evolve independently while maintaining a stable interface between them.</p><p>The project structure reflects the separation between CLI commands and configuration logic. The  directory contains all CLI-related code, while the  directory houses the configuration management core. This organization makes it clear where to find specific functionality and ensures that the configuration logic remains independent of the CLI implementation.</p><div><pre><code>go-appconfig-example/\n‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ cmd/                   # CLI command implementations\n‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ root.go            # Root command and global flags\n‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ config.go          # Configuration management commands\n‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ internal/\n‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ config/            # Configuration management core\n‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ fields.go      # Field definitions and collections\n‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ config.go      # Viper integration\n‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ validators.go  # Custom validation functions\n‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ consts/            # Application constants\n‚îÇ       ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ consts.go      # Go flags like app name, version, etc.\n‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ main.go                # Application entry point\n‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ go.mod                 # Go module definition\n</code></pre></div><p>Application constants define global values that remain consistent throughout the application's lifecycle. These can be overridden at build time using Go's  feature, allowing you to customize the application name, version, or other constants without modifying the source code. This is particularly useful for CI/CD pipelines where different builds might need different configurations.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><h2>\n  \n  \n  Field-Driven Configuration </h2><p>Field-Driven Configuration is a design pattern where configuration parameters are defined as structured data containing all their metadata. Instead of scattering validation rules, documentation, and default values across different parts of the codebase, each field becomes a self-contained unit that describes everything about a configuration parameter. This approach ensures consistency and makes it trivial to add new configuration options without touching multiple files.</p><p>The Field structure is the cornerstone of our configuration system. It encapsulates not just the value of a configuration parameter, but also its type, validation rules, documentation, and any other metadata needed to work with that parameter. This rich metadata enables automatic generation of CLI flags, validation logic, and documentation, all from a single definition.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>The FieldCollection acts as a registry for all configuration fields in your application. It provides methods to add new fields dynamically and retrieve them efficiently. This centralized collection ensures that all parts of the application work with the same field definitions, maintaining consistency across CLI commands, validation, and documentation generation.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>With the Field structure and FieldCollection in place, we can now define actual configuration parameters. Each field definition becomes a single source of truth that contains everything needed to work with that configuration value. The use of init() functions ensures that fields are automatically registered when the package is imported, eliminating the need for manual registration and reducing the chance of forgetting to register a field.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Validation is handled through the <a href=\"https://github.com/go-playground/validator\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Go Validator library</a>, which provides a declarative way to define validation rules using struct tags. The library supports a wide range of built-in validators like , , , , , and many more. You can combine multiple validators using commas (AND logic) or pipes (OR logic). For example, <code>validate:\"required,email\"</code> ensures a field is both present and a valid email, while  accepts either RGB or RGBA color formats.</p><p>In our Field structure, we use the ValidateTag field to specify these validation rules, allowing us to leverage the full power of the validator library without writing repetitive validation code.</p><p>Beyond the built-in validators, the system supports custom validation functions for complex business logic that can't be expressed through tags alone. These functions receive the value to validate and return an error if validation fails, providing complete flexibility for domain-specific rules.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Viper provides the backbone for our configuration management system. It handles the complexity of merging configuration from multiple sources according to a well-defined precedence order: command-line flags override environment variables, which override config file values, which override defaults. This layered approach allows users to define base configurations in files while still being able to override specific values through environment variables in production or flags during development. Viper also manages the serialization and deserialization of configuration files in various formats, making it easy to work with YAML, JSON, TOML, or any other supported format without changing your code.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><h2>\n  \n  \n  Writing the CLI only once with Cobra </h2><p>The beauty of our Field-Driven approach truly shines when building the CLI with Cobra. Instead of manually defining flags for each configuration parameter and keeping them in sync with validation rules and documentation, our CLI commands automatically derive everything they need from the Field definitions. This means you write the CLI structure once, and it automatically adapts as you add new configuration fields. The commands can iterate through the FieldCollection to generate flags, completions, and documentation dynamically, ensuring that the CLI always reflects the current state of your configuration schema.</p><p>The root command serves as the entry point for your CLI application. While you can generate the initial structure using  for the root command and  for subcommands, the real power comes from integrating it with our Field system. The root command sets up global flags and initializes the configuration system before any subcommand runs, ensuring that all parts of the application work with properly loaded and validated configuration.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Cobra provides three types of flags: local flags (specific to a command), persistent flags (available to a command and all its subcommands), and the special PFlags type that integrates with Viper. When you bind a flag to Viper using , Viper automatically reads the flag value if it's set, allowing seamless integration between command-line arguments and your configuration system. This binding creates a unified interface where users can set values through flags, environment variables, or config files, and your application code doesn't need to know which source provided the value.</p><p>Our implementation uses persistent flags for global options like the config file path and verbosity level, ensuring these are available to all subcommands. The initialization happens in Cobra's  hook, which runs before any command execution, guaranteeing that configuration is properly loaded before your command logic runs.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>The configuration commands provide users with a powerful interface to interact with your application's settings. The beauty of this implementation is that these commands automatically work with any fields you define in your FieldCollection. The  command shows current values,  provides detailed documentation, and  allows modification - all without hardcoding any specific field names. This generic approach means that adding a new configuration field automatically makes it available in all these commands without any additional code changes.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Shell completion is one of Cobra's most powerful features, dramatically improving the user experience by providing intelligent suggestions as users type. The completion system works through  callbacks that receive the current command state and return possible completions. The  parameter contains arguments already provided, while  holds the partial text being typed. The function returns a list of completion suggestions and a directive that controls shell behavior (like whether to also suggest files).</p><p>Our implementation leverages the Field definitions to provide context-aware completions. When users type , the system suggests  as a completion. When setting values with valid options, like , the completion can even suggest the valid values (debug, info, warn, error) defined in the field. This deep integration between the configuration schema and the CLI ensures users always have helpful guidance when interacting with your application.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><h4>\n  \n  \n  Listing Configuration Values </h4><p>The list command provides users with a clear view of their current configuration state. By calculating the maximum field name length, the output is neatly aligned, making it easy to scan through settings. The ability to filter by prefix allows users to focus on specific configuration groups, while the hidden flag reveals internal settings that are normally concealed. This command is essential for debugging and verifying that configuration values are being loaded correctly from all sources.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><h4>\n  \n  \n  Setting Configuration Values </h4><p>The set command demonstrates the power of our Field-Driven approach by automatically creating flags for all configuration fields. When a user runs <code>config set --log.level debug</code>, Cobra parses the flag, our code validates it against the Field definition, and if valid, updates the value through Viper. The command then saves the configuration to disk, ensuring changes persist across application restarts. The validation happens before any values are saved, preventing invalid configurations from being written to disk and ensuring the application always works with valid settings.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><h4>\n  \n  \n  Auto-Documentation: Describing Parameters </h4><p>The describe command showcases how rich metadata in Field definitions enables automatic documentation generation. Each field's description, type, valid values, examples, and extended documentation are displayed in a structured format that helps users understand not just what a setting does, but how to use it effectively. The grouping feature organizes related fields together, making it easier to understand the relationships between different configuration options. This self-documenting nature ensures that documentation always stays in sync with the actual implementation.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>The Field-Driven Configuration approach delivers a powerful, user-friendly CLI that adapts automatically as your application evolves. Users benefit from intelligent completions, comprehensive documentation, and robust validation, while developers enjoy a maintainable system where adding new configuration options requires minimal code changes. The integration between Viper and Cobra through our Field abstraction creates a seamless experience where configuration can be managed through files, environment variables, or command-line flags with equal ease.</p><p>The build process leverages Go's  feature to inject build-time values into the application. This allows you to customize constants like application name, version, or even default configuration values without modifying source code. This is particularly useful in CI/CD pipelines where different environments might need different defaults, or when building white-labeled versions of your application.</p><div><pre><code>\ngo build  confapp\n\n\ngo build  myapp\n</code></pre></div><p>Shell completions transform the user experience by providing context-aware suggestions as users type. Once enabled, users can press Tab to see available options, making it easy to discover configuration fields without consulting documentation. The completion system understands the command structure and provides appropriate suggestions based on context, such as showing only valid values for fields with enumerated options.</p><div><pre><code> &lt;./confapp completion zsh &lt;./confapp completion bash</code></pre></div><div><pre><code>\n./confapp config list\n\n\n./confapp config list log\n./confapp config list proxy\n\n\n./confapp config describe\n\n\n./confapp config describe log.level update\n\n\n./confapp config .level debug\n./confapp config .level info .output /var/log/app.log\n\n\n./confapp config list \n./confapp config describe \n./confapp  config list\n</code></pre></div><p>The Field-Driven Configuration pattern presented in this article demonstrates how thoughtful abstraction can transform configuration management from a maintenance burden into a self-maintaining system. By defining configuration fields as first-class entities with rich metadata, we've created a solution that respects the Open-Closed Principle while providing exceptional developer and user experiences.</p><p>The integration of Viper, Cobra, and Go Validator through our Field abstraction eliminates the common pain points of configuration management: keeping documentation in sync, maintaining validation rules, and providing good CLI experiences. The result is a system where adding new configuration options is as simple as defining a new Field struct, and everything else - from CLI flags to validation to documentation - automatically adapts.</p><p>This approach scales elegantly from simple applications with a handful of settings to complex systems with hundreds of configuration parameters organized into logical groups. The automatic generation of completions and documentation ensures that as your application grows, it remains discoverable and user-friendly.</p><p>The architecture presented here provides a solid foundation that can be extended in several ways:</p><p>: Add support for multiple configuration profiles (development, staging, production) by extending the FieldCollection to support profile-specific overrides while maintaining the same validation and documentation capabilities.</p><p>: Implement configuration hot-reloading using Viper's WatchConfig functionality, with the Field definitions providing the validation layer to ensure changes are safe before applying them.</p><p>: Generate OpenAPI specifications or GraphQL schemas from Field definitions, ensuring that API documentation stays synchronized with configuration capabilities.</p><p>: Extend the Field structure to support complex nested configurations while maintaining the same validation and documentation benefits.</p><p>For a complete implementation with additional features like configuration profiles, pager support for long documentation, and more sophisticated validation examples, check out my <a href=\"https://github.com/lucasdecamargo/go-appconfig-example\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">GitHub repository</a>. </p><div><div><div><p>A production-ready template for managing configuration parameters in Go applications using  and .

That's essentially what a neural network does during forward propagation. It takes input data (the clues), processes it layer by layer (analyzes the evidence), and ultimately arrives at an output (solving the case). This process, called forward propagation, is the fundamental engine driving the power of neural networks, the cornerstone of modern machine learning. This article will demystify this crucial process, making it accessible to both beginners and those seeking a deeper understanding.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  What is Forward Propagation?\n</h3><p>Forward propagation is the process by which a neural network transforms input data into an output prediction. It's a series of calculations, flowing forward through the network's layers, each layer transforming the data slightly until a final prediction emerges. Think of it as a pipeline where data enters, undergoes a series of transformations, and finally exits as a refined prediction.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  The Architecture: Layers and Connections\n</h3><p>A neural network consists of interconnected layers:</p><ol><li> Receives the initial data.  For example, if classifying images, this layer might represent the pixel values.</li><li>  These layers perform the bulk of the processing, transforming the data through complex mathematical operations.  A network can have multiple hidden layers, increasing its complexity and learning capacity.</li><li> Produces the final prediction.  This could be a classification (cat or dog), a regression value (house price), or any other desired output.</li></ol><p>Each layer is composed of interconnected , which perform weighted sums of their inputs and apply an activation function to introduce non-linearity. These connections have associated  and , which are the parameters the network learns during training.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  The Mathematics:  A Step-by-Step Walkthrough\n</h3><p>Let's simplify the math. Consider a single neuron receiving inputs $x_1, x_2, ..., x_n$ with corresponding weights $w_1, w_2, ..., w_n$ and a bias $b$. The neuron's output, $z$, is calculated as:</p><p>$z = w_1x_1 + w_2x_2 + ... + w_nx_n + b = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} w_ix_i + b$</p><p>This is a weighted sum of inputs plus a bias. The bias acts as an offset, allowing the neuron to activate even when inputs are small.</p><p>Next, an , denoted as œÉ(z), is applied to introduce non-linearity. Common activation functions include sigmoid, ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit), and tanh. For example, the ReLU function is defined as:</p><p>This means the output is either 0 or the input itself, depending on whether the input is negative or positive. This simple non-linearity is crucial for the network's ability to learn complex patterns.</p><p>The output of one layer becomes the input for the next, and this process repeats until the output layer is reached. Let's illustrate with Python pseudo-code:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Forward propagation is the backbone of countless applications:</p><ul><li>  Classifying images of cats, dogs, or other objects.</li><li><strong>Natural Language Processing:</strong>  Understanding and generating human language, powering chatbots and machine translation.</li><li>  Object detection and path planning.</li><li>  Analyzing medical images to detect diseases.</li></ul><h3>\n  \n  \n  Challenges and Limitations\n</h3><ul><li>  Training deep neural networks can be computationally expensive, requiring powerful hardware (GPUs).</li><li>  The network might learn the training data too well and perform poorly on unseen data.</li><li> Understanding why a network makes a specific prediction can be challenging, raising ethical concerns in sensitive applications.</li></ul><h3>\n  \n  \n  The Future of Forward Propagation\n</h3><p>Forward propagation remains central to neural network research. Ongoing research focuses on:</p><ul><li><strong>More efficient algorithms:</strong>  Reducing computational costs and improving training speed.</li><li>  Designing networks that are more robust, accurate, and interpretable.</li><li><strong>New activation functions:</strong>  Exploring activation functions that enhance learning and generalization.</li></ul><p>In conclusion, forward propagation is the engine driving the power of neural networks. Understanding its mechanics‚Äîthe flow of data, the mathematical transformations, and the role of activation functions‚Äîis crucial for anyone seeking to master the art of machine learning. As research continues, forward propagation will undoubtedly play an even more critical role in shaping the future of artificial intelligence.</p>","contentLength":4290,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Links","url":"https://matklad.github.io/2025/08/23/links.html","date":1755907200,"author":"Alex Kladov","guid":237269,"unread":true,"content":"<p>If you have a blog, consider adding a ‚Äúlinks‚Äù page to it, which references resources that you find\nnotable:</p><p>I‚Äôve started my links page several years ago, mostly because I found myself referring to the same\nfew links repeatedly in various discussions, and not all the links were easily searchable.</p><p>Note that the suggestion is different from more typical ‚Äúmonthly links roundup‚Äù, which is nice to\nmaintain Substack engagement/community, but doesn‚Äôt contribute to long-term knowledge distilling.</p><p>It is also different from the exhaustive list of everything I‚Äôve read on the Internet.

In this article, we'll discuss adding Docker and Docker Compose for running components of our service in containers.</p><p>Containerization has become an essential tool for modern web development, and Docker is at the forefront of this revolution. When developing a Django-based web application like ours, using Docker ensures consistency across development and deployed environments. By leveraging Docker Compose, we can efficiently manage multiple services required by our application.</p><p>Docker Compose is a tool that allows you to define and manage multi-container Docker applications using a simple YAML file (docker-compose.yaml). It enables developers to run interconnected services, such as a web application, database, and message broker, with a single command. The  Docker Compose basic concepts include:</p><p><strong><em>Key Docker Compose Configuration Options</em></strong></p><ul><li><p> Defines the Compose file format version. In our case, we use \"3.9\", which is one of the latest stable versions.</p></li><li><p> Lists all the containers that make up the application. Each service runs in its own container.</p></li></ul><p><strong><em>Service Configuration Keys</em></strong></p><ul><li><p> Specifies the Docker image to use for the container. If the image is not found locally, Docker will pull it from a registry like Docker Hub.</p></li><li><p> Defines how to build the image from a Dockerfile. It usually includes:</p><ul><li>context: The directory containing the Dockerfile.</li><li>dockerfile: The path to the specific Dockerfile used to build the image.</li></ul></li><li><p> Gives a custom name to the container instead of a randomly generated one.</p></li><li><p> Overrides the default command specified in the Dockerfile, allowing you to run specific commands when the container starts.</p></li><li><p> Loads environment variables from an external .env file.</p></li><li><p> Maps ports between the container and the host.</p></li><li><p> Specifies service dependencies. A container will not start until its dependencies are up and running.</p></li></ul><p>Volumes store persistent data outside the container filesystem, ensuring data is not lost when containers are restarted or removed.</p><p>Let's review the components in our system, each of these will be a service in our docker-compose.yaml file.</p><ul><li>Django (Web Application) ‚Äì The core application running on Gunicorn or the Django development server</li><li>PostgreSQL (Database) ‚Äì Stores application data</li><li>Redis (Message Broker) ‚Äì Used by Celery for task queuing</li><li>Celery Worker ‚Äì Executes asynchronous tasks</li><li>Celery Beat ‚Äì Handles scheduled tasks</li><li>Celery Flower ‚Äì Provides a web UI for monitoring Celery tasks</li></ul><h2><strong>Our docker-compose.yaml file</strong></h2><div><pre><code>version: '3.9'\n\nservices:\n  django:\n    image: spokanetech-django:latest\n    container_name: django\n    env_file:\n      - .env.compose\n    build:\n      context: ../..\n      dockerfile: src/docker/Dockerfile\n    command: ./entrypoint.sh\n    ports:\n      - \"8080:8000\"\n    depends_on:\n      - db\n      - redis\n\n  db:\n    image: postgres:17\n    container_name: postgres_db\n    volumes:\n      - postgres_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data\n    ports:\n      - \"5432:5432\"\n    env_file:\n      - .env.compose\n\n  redis:\n    image: redis:7.2-alpine\n    container_name: redis\n    restart: unless-stopped\n    ports:\n      - \"6379:6379\"\n\n  worker:\n    image: spokanetech-django:latest\n    container_name: worker\n    env_file:\n      - .env.compose\n    build:\n      context: ../..\n      dockerfile: src/docker/Dockerfile\n    command: celery -A core worker -l info\n    depends_on:\n      - redis\n      - db\n\n  beat:\n    image: spokanetech-django:latest\n    container_name: beat\n    env_file:\n      - .env.compose\n    build:\n      context: ../..\n      dockerfile: src/docker/Dockerfile\n    command: celery -A core beat -l info --scheduler django_celery_beat.schedulers:DatabaseScheduler\n    depends_on:\n      - redis\n      - db\n\n  flower:\n    image: spokanetech-django:latest\n    container_name: flower\n    env_file:\n      - .env.compose\n    command: [\"celery\", \"-A\", \"core\", \"--config=flowerconfig.py\", \"flower\"]\n    ports:\n      - \"5555:5555\"\n    depends_on:\n      - redis\n      - db\n\nvolumes:\n  postgres_data:\n  static_volume:\n</code></pre></div><p>Docker Compose provides several commands to manage services.

HTTP/2 represents a significant leap forward from HTTP/1.x, particularly for applications handling thousands of concurrent connections. The protocol's design addresses many limitations that plagued earlier versions.</p><p>I've spent considerable time optimizing HTTP/2 implementations in production environments. The gains are substantial when you approach it correctly. Connection multiplexing alone can transform how your server handles load.</p><p>Let me walk through a practical implementation that demonstrates key optimization techniques. This code establishes a foundation for high-concurrency HTTP/2 servers in Go.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>The foundation starts with proper structure. We need components for connection management, server push capabilities, and performance tracking. Each plays a crucial role in achieving optimal performance.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Connection pooling proves essential for reducing overhead. Establishing new TLS connections remains expensive, so reusing existing connections dramatically improves efficiency.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Server push represents one of HTTP/2's most powerful features. When implemented correctly, it allows proactive resource delivery before clients even request them.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Tracking performance metrics helps identify bottlenecks. Without proper instrumentation, optimizing becomes guesswork rather than data-driven improvement.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Initializing the server requires careful configuration. Setting appropriate limits prevents resource exhaustion while maintaining high throughput.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>The request handling logic needs to account for protocol differences. HTTP/2 enables optimizations that simply aren't possible with earlier versions.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>HTTP/2-specific handling focuses on three main areas: header compression, server push opportunities, and stream prioritization. Each contributes to overall performance.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Server push implementation requires careful consideration. Pushing unnecessary resources can actually harm performance rather than help.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Stream prioritization allows more important requests to receive resources first. This proves particularly valuable under heavy load conditions.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Caching pushable resources ensures they're readily available when opportunities arise. The cache should be populated during server initialization.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Connection management forms the heart of HTTP/2 optimization. Smart pooling strategies prevent connection churn while maintaining performance.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Regular cleanup prevents memory leaks from accumulated idle connections. The cleanup frequency should balance resource usage with connection establishment costs.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Monitoring performance provides insights for further optimization. The metrics collected help identify patterns and potential improvements.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>The main function ties everything together. Proper TLS configuration is essential for HTTP/2, as most browsers require encrypted connections.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Connection multiplexing stands as HTTP/2's most significant advantage. Where HTTP/1.x required multiple connections for parallel requests, HTTP/2 handles everything over a single connection. This reduces TCP and TLS overhead substantially.</p><p>In practice, I've seen connection counts drop from six per client to just one. The resource savings compound quickly at scale. Memory usage decreases, CPU load reduces, and network efficiency improves.</p><p>Header compression using HPACK delivers impressive gains. Traditional HTTP headers often consumed 2KB or more per request. HPACK typically reduces this to under 200 bytes. The savings become enormous at high request volumes.</p><p>The compression works through static and dynamic tables. Common headers get referenced from tables rather than retransmitted. Huffman encoding further reduces size for variable values.</p><p>Server push requires thoughtful implementation. The feature allows sending responses before clients request them. For critical resources like CSS or JavaScript, this can eliminate round trips.</p><p>But push too much, and you waste bandwidth. Push the wrong things, and you hinder performance. I typically push only resources with high certainty of being needed.</p><p>Stream prioritization enables quality of service controls. Important requests can receive preferential treatment during resource contention. The protocol supports complex dependency trees and weight-based allocation.</p><p>In real applications, I prioritize user-interactive requests over background tasks. API calls affecting user experience get resources before analytics pings or prefetch requests.</p><p>Connection management deserves particular attention. HTTP/2 connections are valuable resources. Pooling and reuse prevent expensive renegotiation of TLS sessions.</p><p>I implement aggressive connection reuse where appropriate. The pool maintains connections to various endpoints, ready for immediate use. Cleanup routines remove idle connections to conserve resources.</p><p>Performance monitoring provides crucial insights. Without metrics, optimization efforts operate blindly. I track active streams, pushed resources, header savings, and connection reuse rates.</p><p>These metrics help identify bottlenecks. If active streams consistently hit limits, perhaps the maximum needs adjustment. If push failures increase, maybe the strategy requires revision.</p><p>Flow control tuning affects overall throughput. HTTP/2 includes window-based flow control at both connection and stream levels. Proper tuning prevents starvation while maintaining fairness.</p><p>I typically start with conservative window sizes and adjust based on observed performance. The optimal values depend on network characteristics and application behavior.</p><p>Error handling requires special consideration in HTTP/2. The protocol includes various error codes and reset mechanisms. Proper handling maintains stability during network issues or client problems.</p><p>I implement comprehensive logging for stream resets and connection errors. This helps identify patterns and address underlying issues.</p><p>Protocol upgrade handling maintains compatibility. While HTTP/2 excels, not all clients support it. The server should gracefully handle HTTP/1.x connections when necessary.</p><p>In my implementation, I check the protocol version and handle appropriately. This ensures broad compatibility while providing modern features where available.</p><p>TLS configuration significantly impacts performance. HTTP/2 requires specific cipher suites and protocol versions. Modern, efficient settings improve both security and speed.</p><p>I prefer TLS 1.3 where possible for improved performance. The reduced handshake latency benefits HTTP/2's connection reuse model.</p><p>Resource management prevents denial of service attacks. HTTP/2's multiplexing capability means a single connection can make many requests. Limits prevent resource exhaustion.</p><p>I set reasonable limits on concurrent streams and request rates. These protect the server while still allowing high performance for legitimate traffic.</p><p>The implementation demonstrates practical application of HTTP/2 features. The code provides a foundation that can be extended for specific use cases. Each component addresses particular aspects of protocol optimization.</p><p>Through careful implementation and continuous refinement, HTTP/2 can deliver substantial performance improvements. The protocol represents a meaningful step forward in web technology.</p><p>The approach reduces latency while increasing throughput. Connection multiplexing cuts resource usage significantly for high-concurrency workloads. Header compression reduces bandwidth requirements. Server push eliminates round trips for critical resources.</p><p>These improvements combine to create faster, more efficient web services. The benefits become increasingly valuable as applications scale to handle more users and traffic.</p><p>Proper HTTP/2 implementation requires understanding both the protocol specifics and the practical considerations of production deployment. The technical capabilities must be balanced with operational requirements.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  The result is systems that handle more traffic with fewer resources while providing better user experiences.

Amazon Bedrock provides a way to host and invoke models as well as integrate the AI models with surrounding infrastructure, which we elaborate on in this post.</p><h2>Combining GIS and AI through RAG and agentic workflows</h2><p>LLMs are trained with large amounts of generalized information to discover patterns in how language is produced. To improve the performance of LLMs for specific use cases, approaches such as RAG and agentic workflows have been created. Retrieving policies and general knowledge for geospatial use cases can be accomplished with RAG, whereas calculating and analyzing GIS data would require an agentic workflow. In this section, we expand upon both RAG and agentic workflows in the context of geospatial use cases.</p><h3>Retrieval Augmented Generation</h3><p>With RAG, you can dynamically inject contextual information from a knowledge base during model invocation.</p><p>RAG supplements a user-provided prompt with data sourced from a knowledge base (collection of documents). Amazon Bedrock offers managed knowledge bases to data sources, such as <a href=\"http://aws.amazon.com/s3\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Amazon Simple Storage Service</a> (Amazon S3) and SharePoint, so you can provide supplemental information, such as city development plans, intelligence reports, or policies and regulations, when your AI assistant is generating a response for a user.</p><p>Knowledge bases are ideal for unstructured documents with information stored in natural language. When your AI model responds to a user with information sourced from RAG, it can provide references and citations to its source material. The following diagram shows how the systems connect together.</p><p>Because geospatial data is often structured and in a GIS, you can connect the GIS to the LLM using tools and agents instead of knowledge bases.</p><h3>Tools and agents (to control a UI and a system)</h3><p>Many LLMs, such as <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/claude/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Anthropic‚Äôs Claude</a> on Amazon Bedrock, make it possible to provide a description of tools available so your AI model can generate text to invoke external processes. These processes might retrieve live information, such as the current weather in a location or querying a structured data store, or might control external systems, such as starting a workflow or adding layers to a map. Some common geospatial functionality that you might want to integrate with your LLM using tools include:</p><ul><li>Performing mathematical calculations like the distance between coordinates, filtering datasets based on numeric values, or calculating derived fields</li><li>Deriving information from predictive analysis models</li><li>Looking up points of interest in structured data stores</li><li>Searching content and metadata in unstructured data stores</li><li>Retrieving real-time geospatial data, like traffic, directions, or estimated time to reach a destination</li><li>Visualizing distances, points of interest, or paths</li><li>Submitting work outputs such as analytic reports</li><li>Starting workflows, like ordering supplies or adjusting supply chain</li></ul><p>Tools are often implemented in <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">AWS Lambda</a> functions. Lambda runs code without the complexity and overhead of running servers. It handles the infrastructure management, enabling faster development, improved performance, enhanced security, and cost-efficiency.</p><p>Amazon Bedrock offers the feature <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/agents/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Amazon Bedrock Agents</a> to simplify the orchestration and integration with your geospatial tools. Amazon Bedrock agents follow instructions for LLM reasoning to break down a user prompt into smaller tasks and perform actions against identified tasks from action providers. The following diagram illustrates how Amazon Bedrock Agents works.</p><p>The following diagram shows how Amazon Bedrock Agents can enhance GIS solutions.</p><p>The following demonstration applies the concepts we‚Äôve discussed to an earthquake analysis agent as an example. This example deploys an Amazon Bedrock agent with a knowledge base based on <a href=\"http://aws.amazon.com/redshift\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Amazon Redshift</a>. The Redshift instance has two tables. One table is for earthquakes, which includes date, magnitude, latitude, and longitude. The second table holds the counites in California, described as polygon shapes. The geospatial capabilities of Amazon Redshift can relate these datasets to answer queries like which county had the most recent earthquake or which county has had the most earthquakes in the last 20 years. The Amazon Bedrock agent can generate these geospatially based queries based on natural language.</p><p>This script creates an end-to-end pipeline that performs the following steps:</p><ol><li>Processes geospatial data.</li><li>Sets up cloud infrastructure.</li><li>Loads and configures the spatial database.</li><li>Creates an AI agent for spatial analysis.</li></ol><p>In the following sections, we create this agent and test it out.</p><p>To implement this approach, you must have an AWS account with the appropriate <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/iam/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">AWS Identity and Access Management</a> (IAM) permissions for Amazon Bedrock, Amazon Redshift, and Amazon S3.</p><ol><li>Confirm you have access to the latest version of the AWS CLI.</li><li><a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/signin/latest/userguide/command-line-sign-in.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Sign in</a> to the AWS CLI with your credentials.</li><li>Make sure ./jq is installed.

In this blog post we present a systematic evaluation methodology for <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Amazon Bedrock</a> users, combining theoretical frameworks with practical implementation strategies that empower data scientists and machine learning (ML) engineers to make optimal model selections.</p><h2>The challenge of foundation model selection</h2><p><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Amazon Bedrock</a> is a fully managed service that offers a choice of high-performing foundation models from leading AI companies such as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/ai21/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">AI21 Labs</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/anthropic\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Anthropic</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/cohere/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Cohere</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/deepseek\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">DeepSeek</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/luma-ai/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Luma</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/llama/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Meta</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/mistral/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Mistral AI</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/poolside/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">poolside&nbsp;</a>(coming soon),&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/stability-ai/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Stability AI</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/twelvelabs/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">TwelveLabs</a>&nbsp;(coming soon),&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/writer\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Writer</a>, and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/ai/generative-ai/nova/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Amazon&nbsp;</a>through a single API, along with a broad set of capabilities you need to build generative AI applications with security, privacy, and responsible AI. The service‚Äôs API-driven approach allows seamless model interchangeability, but this flexibility introduces a critical challenge: which model will deliver optimal performance for a specific application while meeting operational constraints?</p><p>Our research with enterprise customers reveals that many early generative AI projects select models based on either limited manual testing or reputation, rather than systematic evaluation against business requirements. This approach frequently results in:</p><ul><li>Over-provisioning computational resources to accommodate larger models than required</li><li>Sub-optimal performance because of misalignment between model strengths and use case requirements</li><li>Unnecessarily high operational costs because of inefficient token utilization</li><li>Production performance issues discovered too late in the development lifecycle</li></ul><h2>A multidimensional evaluation framework‚ÄîFoundation model capability matrix</h2><p>Foundation models vary significantly across multiple dimensions, with performance characteristics that interact in complex ways. Our capability matrix provides a structured view of critical dimensions to consider when <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/amazon-bedrock-model-evaluation-is-now-generally-available/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">evaluating models</a> in Amazon Bedrock. Below are four core dimensions (in no specific order) ‚Äì Task performance, Architectural characteristics, Operational considerations, and Responsible AI attributes.</p><p>Evaluating the models based on the task performance is crucial for achieving direct impact on business outcomes, ROI, user adoption and trust, and competitive advantage.</p><ul><li>: Evaluate models using benchmarks relevant to your use case (MMLU, HELM, or domain-specific benchmarks).</li><li><strong>Few-shot learning capabilities</strong>: Strong few-shot performers require minimal examples to adapt to new tasks, leading to cost efficiency, faster time-to-market, resource optimization, and operational benefits.</li><li><strong>Instruction following fidelity</strong>: For the applications that require precise adherence to commands and constraints, it is critical to evaluate model‚Äôs instruction following fidelity.</li><li>: Reliability and reproducibility across multiple runs with identical prompts.</li><li><strong>Domain-specific knowledge</strong>: Model performance varies dramatically across specialized fields based on training data. Evaluate the models base on your domain-specific use-case scenarios.</li><li>Evaluate the model‚Äôs ability to perform logical inference, causal reasoning, and multi-step problem-solving. This can include reasoning such as deductive and inductive, mathematical, chain-of-thought, and so on.</li></ul><h3><strong>Architectural characteristics</strong></h3><p>Architectural characteristics for evaluating the models are important as they directly impact the model‚Äôs performance, efficiency, and suitability for specific tasks.</p><ul><li><strong>Parameter count (model size)</strong>: Larger models typically offer more capabilities but require greater computational resources and may have higher inference costs and latency.</li><li><strong>Training data composition</strong>: Models trained on diverse, high-quality datasets tend to have better generalization abilities across different domains.</li><li>: Decoder-only models excel at text generation, encoder-decoder architectures handle translation and summarization more effectively, while mixture of experts (MoE) architectures can be a powerful tool for improving the performance of both decoder-only and encoder-decoder models. Some specialized architectures focus on enhancing reasoning capabilities through techniques like chain-of-thought prompting or recursive reasoning.</li><li>: The way models process text affects performance on domain-specific tasks, particularly with specialized vocabulary.</li><li><strong>Context window capabilities</strong>: Larger context windows enable processing more information at once, critical for document analysis and extended conversations.</li><li>: Modality refers to type of data a model can process and generate, such as text, image, audio, or video. Consider the modality of the models depending on the use case, and choose the model optimized for that specific modality.</li></ul><h3><strong>Operational considerations</strong></h3><p>Below listed operational considerations are critical for model selection as they directly impact the real-world feasibility, cost-effectiveness, and sustainability of AI deployments.</p><ul><li><strong>Throughput and latency profiles</strong>: Response speed impacts user experience and throughput determines scalability.</li><li>: Input/output token pricing significantly affects economics at scale.</li><li><strong>Scalability characteristics</strong>: Ability to handle concurrent requests and maintain performance during traffic spikes.</li><li>: Fine-tuning capabilities and adaptation methods for tailoring to specific use cases or domains.</li><li>: Ease of integration into existing systems and workflow is an important consideration.</li><li>: When dealing with sensitive data, model security‚Äîincluding data encryption, access control, and vulnerability management‚Äîis a crucial consideration.</li></ul><h3><strong>Responsible AI attributes</strong></h3><p>As AI becomes increasingly embedded in business operations and daily lives, evaluating models on responsible AI attributes isn‚Äôt just a technical consideration‚Äîit‚Äôs a business imperative.</p><ul><li>: Models vary in their tendency to generate plausible but incorrect information.</li><li>: Performance across different demographic groups affects fairness and equity.</li><li><strong>Safety guardrail effectiveness</strong>: Resistance to generating harmful or inappropriate content.</li><li><strong>Explainability and privacy</strong>: Transparency features and handling of sensitive information.</li><li>: Legal considerations should include data privacy, non-discrimination, intellectual property, and product liability.</li></ul><h2>Agentic AI considerations for model selection</h2><p>The growing popularity of agentic AI applications introduces evaluation dimensions beyond traditional metrics. When assessing models for use in autonomous agents, consider these critical capabilities:</p><p><strong>Agent-specific evaluation dimensions</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Planning and reasoning capabilities</strong>: Evaluate chain-of-thought consistency across complex multi-step tasks and self-correction mechanisms that allow agents to identify and fix their own reasoning errors.</li><li>: Test function calling capabilities, parameter handling precision, and structured output consistency (JSON/XML) for seamless tool use.</li><li><strong>Agent-to-agent communication</strong>: Assess protocol adherence to frameworks like A2A and efficient contextual memory management across extended multi-agent interactions.</li></ul><p><strong>Multi-agent collaboration testing</strong> for applications using multiple specialized agents</p><ul><li>: Measure how well models maintain distinct agent personas and responsibilities without role confusion.</li><li><strong>Information sharing efficiency</strong>: Test how effectively information flows between agent instances without critical detail loss.</li><li><strong>Collaborative intelligence</strong>: Verify whether multiple agents working together produce better outcomes than single-model approaches.</li><li><strong>Error propagation resistance</strong>: Assess how robustly multi-agent systems contain and correct errors rather than amplifying them.</li></ul><h2>A four-phase evaluation methodology</h2><p>Our recommended methodology progressively narrows model selection through increasingly sophisticated assessment techniques:</p><h3>Phase 1: Requirements engineering</h3><p>Begin with a precise specification of your application‚Äôs requirements:</p><ul><li>: Define primary tasks, domain knowledge needs, language support, output formats, and reasoning complexity.</li><li><strong>Non-functional requirements</strong>: Specify latency thresholds, throughput requirements, budget constraints, context window needs, and availability expectations.</li><li><strong>Responsible AI requirements</strong>: Establish hallucination tolerance, bias mitigation needs, safety requirements, explainability level, and privacy constraints.</li><li><strong>Agent-specific requirements</strong>: For agentic applications, define tool-use capabilities, protocol adherence standards, and collaboration requirements.</li></ul><p>Assign weights to each requirement based on business priorities to create your evaluation scorecard foundation.</p><h3>Phase 2: Candidate model selection</h3><p>Use the Amazon Bedrock model information <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/APIReference/API_ListFoundationModels.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">API</a> to filter models based on hard requirements. This typically reduces candidates from dozens to 3‚Äì7 models that are worth detailed evaluation.</p><p>Filter options include but aren‚Äôt limited to the following:</p><ul><li>Filter by modality support, context length, and language capabilities</li><li>Exclude models that don‚Äôt meet minimum performance thresholds</li><li>Calculate theoretical costs at projected scale so that you can exclude options that exceed the available budget</li><li>Filter for customization requirements such as fine-tuning capabilities</li><li>For agentic applications, filter for function calling and multi-agent protocol support</li></ul><p>Although the Amazon Bedrock model information API might not provide the filters you need for candidate selection, you can use the Amazon Bedrock model catalog (shown in the following figure) to obtain additional information about these models.</p><h3>Phase 3: Systematic performance evaluation</h3><ol><li><strong>Prepare evaluation datasets</strong>: Create representative task examples, challenging edge cases, domain-specific content, and adversarial examples.</li><li><strong>Design evaluation prompts</strong>: Standardize instruction format, maintain consistent examples, and mirror production usage patterns.</li><li>: Select appropriate metrics for subjective tasks (human evaluation and reference-free quality), objective tasks (precision, recall, and F1 score), and reasoning tasks (logical consistency and step validity).</li><li>: Add protocol conformance testing, multi-step planning assessment, and tool-use evaluation.</li><li>: Maintain consistent parameters across models and collect comprehensive performance data.</li><li><strong>Measure operational performance</strong>: Capture throughput, latency distributions, error rates, and actual token consumption costs.</li></ol><h3>Phase 4: Decision analysis</h3><p>Transform evaluation data into actionable insights:</p><ol><li>: Scale all metrics to comparable units using min-max normalization.</li><li>: Calculate composite scores based on your prioritized requirements.</li><li><strong>Perform sensitivity analysis</strong>: Test how robust your conclusions are against weight variations.</li><li>: Create radar charts, efficiency frontiers, and tradeoff curves for clear comparison.</li><li>: Detail each model‚Äôs strengths, limitations, and optimal use cases.</li></ol><h2>Advanced evaluation techniques</h2><p>Beyond standard procedures, consider the following approaches for evaluating models.</p><h3>A/B testing with production traffic</h3><p>Implement comparative testing using <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/intelligent-prompt-routing/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Amazon Bedrock‚Äôs routing</a> capabilities to gather real-world performance data from actual users.</p><p>Test model vulnerabilities through prompt injection attempts, challenging syntax, edge case handling, and domain-specific factual challenges.</p><h3>Multi-model ensemble evaluation</h3><p>Assess combinations such as sequential pipelines, voting ensembles, and cost-efficient routing based on task complexity.</p><h3>Continuous evaluation architecture</h3><p>Design systems to monitor production performance with:</p><ul><li>Stratified sampling of production traffic across task types and domains</li><li>Regular evaluations and trigger-based reassessments when new models emerge</li><li>Performance thresholds and alerts for quality degradation</li><li>User feedback collection and failure case repositories for continuous improvement</li></ul><h3>Industry-specific considerations</h3><p>Different sectors have unique requirements that influence model selection:</p><ul><li>: Regulatory compliance, numerical precision, and personally identifiable information (PII) handling capabilities</li><li>: Medical terminology understanding, HIPAA adherence, and clinical reasoning</li><li>: Technical specification comprehension, procedural knowledge, and spatial reasoning</li><li>: Autonomous reasoning, tool integration, and protocol conformance</li></ul><h2>Best practices for model selection</h2><p>Through this comprehensive approach to model evaluation and selection, organizations can make informed decisions that balance performance, cost, and operational requirements while maintaining alignment with business objectives. The methodology makes sure that model selection isn‚Äôt a one-time exercise but an evolving process that adapts to changing needs and technological capabilities.</p><ul><li><strong>Assess your situation thoroughly</strong>: Understand your specific use case requirements and available resources</li><li><strong>Select meaningful metrics</strong>: Focus on metrics that directly relate to your business objectives</li><li><strong>Build for continuous evaluation</strong>: Design your evaluation process to be repeatable as new models are released</li></ul><h2>Looking forward: The future of model selection</h2><p>As foundation models evolve, evaluation methodologies must keep pace. Below are further considerations (By no means this list of considerations is exhaustive and is subject to ongoing updates as technology evolves and best practices emerge), you should take into account while selecting the best model(s) for your use-case(s).</p><ul><li><strong>Multi-model architectures</strong>: Enterprises will increasingly deploy specialized models in concert rather than relying on single models for all tasks.</li><li>: Evaluation frameworks must assess how models perform as autonomous agents with tool-use capabilities and inter-agent collaboration.</li><li>: The growing landscape of domain-specific models will require more nuanced evaluation of specialized capabilities.</li><li>: As models become more capable, evaluation of controllability and alignment with human intent becomes increasingly important.</li></ul><p>By implementing a comprehensive evaluation framework that extends beyond basic metrics, organizations can informed decisions about which foundation models will best serve their requirements. For agentic AI applications in particular, thorough evaluation of reasoning, planning, and collaboration capabilities is essential for success. By approaching model selection systematically, organizations can avoid the common pitfalls of over-provisioning, misalignment with use case needs, excessive operational costs, and late discovery of performance issues. The investment in thorough evaluation pays dividends through optimized costs, improved performance, and superior user experiences.</p><p> is a Senior Generative AI Data Scientist at Amazon Web Services, helping businesses innovate with generative AI.

Despite the critical role these documents play, an <a href=\"https://mitsloan.mit.edu/ideas-made-to-matter/tapping-power-unstructured-data\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">estimated 80‚Äì90%</a> of the data they contain is unstructured and largely untapped, hiding valuable insights that could transform business outcomes. Despite advances in technology, many organizations still rely on manual data entry, spending countless hours extracting information from PDFs, scanned images, and forms. This manual approach is time-consuming, error-prone, and prevents organizations from scaling their operations and responding quickly to business demands.</p><p>Although generative AI has made it easier to build proof-of-concept document processing solutions, the journey from proof of concept to production remains fraught with challenges. Organizations often find themselves rebuilding from scratch when they discover their prototype can‚Äôt handle production volumes, lacks proper error handling, doesn‚Äôt scale cost-effectively, or fails to meet enterprise security and compliance requirements.

Automated document processing workflows accurately extract structured information from documents, reducing manual effort. We will show you how this ready-to-deploy solution can help you build those workflows with generative AI on AWS in days instead of months.</p><h2>Understanding intelligent document processing</h2><p>Intelligent document processing (IDP) encompasses the technologies and techniques used to extract and process data from various document types. Common IDP tasks include:</p><ul><li><strong>OCR (Optical Character Recognition)</strong> ‚Äì Converting scanned documents and images into machine-readable text</li><li> ‚Äì Automatically identifying document types (such as invoices, contracts, or forms)</li><li> ‚Äì Pulling structured information from unstructured documents</li><li> ‚Äì Evaluating the quality and confidence of extracted data</li><li> ‚Äì Creating concise summaries of document content</li><li> ‚Äì Measuring accuracy and performance against expected outcomes</li></ul><p>These capabilities are critical across industries. In financial services, organizations use IDP to process loan applications, extract data from bank statements, and validate insurance claims. Healthcare providers rely on IDP to extract patient information from medical records, process insurance forms, and handle lab results efficiently. Manufacturing and logistics companies use IDP to process invoices and purchase orders, extract shipping information, and handle quality certificates. Government agencies use IDP to process citizen applications, extract data from tax forms, manage permits and licenses, and enforce regulatory compliance.</p><h2>The generative AI revolution in IDP</h2><p>Traditional IDP solutions relied on template-based extraction, regular expressions, and classical machine learning (ML) models. Though functional, these approaches required extensive setup, struggled with document variations, and achieved limited accuracy on complex documents.</p><p>The emergence of large language models (LLMs) and generative AI has fundamentally transformed IDP capabilities. Modern AI models can understand document context, handle variations without templates, achieve near-human accuracy on complex extractions, and adapt to new document types with minimal examples. This shift from rule-based to intelligence-based processing means organizations can now process different document types with high accuracy, dramatically reducing the time and cost of implementation.</p><p>We‚Äôre excited to share the <a href=\"https://github.com/aws-solutions-library-samples/accelerated-intelligent-document-processing-on-aws/blob/main/README.md\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">GenAI IDP Accelerator</a>‚Äîan open source solution that transforms how organizations handle document processing by dramatically reducing manual effort and improving accuracy.

SageMaker HyperPod removes the undifferentiated heavy lifting involved in building and optimizing machine learning (ML) infrastructure for training FMs, reducing training time by up to 40%.</p><p>SageMaker HyperPod offers persistent clusters with built-in resiliency, while also offering deep infrastructure control by allowing users to SSH into the underlying <a href=\"http://aws.amazon.com/ec2\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud</a> (Amazon EC2) instances. It helps efficiently scale model development and deployment tasks such as training, fine-tuning, or inference across a cluster of hundreds or thousands of AI accelerators, while reducing the operational heavy lifting involved in managing such clusters. As AI moves towards deployment adopting to a multitude of domains and use cases, the need for flexibility and control is becoming more pertinent. Large enterprises want to make sure the GPU clusters follow the organization-wide policies and security rules. Mission-critical AI/ML workloads often require specialized environments that align with the organization‚Äôs software stack and operational standards.</p><p>SageMaker HyperPod supports <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/eks/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service</a> (Amazon EKS) and offers two new features that enhance this control and flexibility to enable production deployment of large-scale ML workloads:</p><ul><li> ‚Äì SageMaker HyperPod now supports continuous provisioning, which enhances cluster scalability through features like partial provisioning, rolling updates, concurrent scaling operations, and continuous retries when launching and configuring your HyperPod cluster.</li><li>‚Äì You can now use custom <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/AMIs.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Amazon Machine Images</a> (AMIs), which enables the preconfiguration of software stacks, security agents, and proprietary dependencies that would otherwise require complex post-launch bootstrapping. Customers can create custom AMIs using the HyperPod public AMI as a base and install additional software required to meet their organization‚Äôs specific security and compliance requirements.</li></ul><p>In this post, we dive deeper into each of these features.</p><p>The new continuous provisioning feature in SageMaker HyperPod represents a transformative advancement for organizations running intensive ML workloads, delivering unprecedented flexibility and operational efficiency that accelerates AI innovation. This feature provides the following benefits:</p><ul><li> ‚Äì SageMaker HyperPod prioritizes delivering the maximum possible number of instances without failure. You can start running your workload while your cluster will attempt to provision the remaining instances.</li><li> ‚Äì SageMaker HyperPod supports simultaneous scaling and maintenance activities (such as scale up, scale down, and patching) on a single instance group waiting for previous operations to complete.</li><li> ‚Äì SageMaker HyperPod persistently attempts to fulfill the user‚Äôs request until it encounters a  error from where recovery is not possible.</li><li><strong>Increased customer visibility</strong> ‚Äì SageMaker HyperPod maps customer-initiated and service-initiated operations to structured activity streams, providing real-time status updates and detailed progress tracking.</li></ul><p>For ML teams facing tight deadlines and resource constraints, this means dramatically reduced wait times and the ability to begin model training and deployment with whatever computing power is immediately available, while the system works diligently in the background to provision remaining requested resources.</p><h3>Implement continuous provisioning in a SageMaker HyperPod cluster</h3><p>The architecture introduces an intuitive yet powerful parameter that puts scaling strategy control directly in your hands: .

The LabEx 'Data Science' path is designed precisely for this, offering a structured roadmap through hands-on, interactive lessons. Forget passive video lectures; here, you learn by doing, mastering essential concepts from statistical analysis to machine learning and data visualization. Let's explore a few beginner-friendly experiments that will kickstart your transformation from novice to data wizard.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Automatic Registration of Subclasses\n</h2><p> Beginner |  5 minutes</p><p>In this challenge, we will implement a class called Base that will automatically record any subclasses that inherit from it. The purpose of this implementation is to enable the retrieval of all subclass names by iterating over Base. The goal is to demonstrate the functionality of Base by showing that it correctly registers and outputs the names of the subclasses. We will accomplish this by implementing the  method in the Base class and ensuring that it supports iteration.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Implementing Column Permutation Encryption in Python\n</h2><p> Beginner |  5 minutes</p><p>In this challenge, we will be implementing the Column Permutation Encryption method. This method involves encrypting a plaintext by writing it down line by line with a fixed number of characters per line, and then rearranging the columns of the resulting matrix according to the alphabetical order of a key. The rearranged columns are then read out one by one to obtain the ciphertext. The objective of the challenge is to complete the column_permutation_encryption(text) function in the given file, which takes a piece of text as input, performs column permutation encryption using the key qiao and the padding character ,, and returns the ciphertext. If the input text is empty, None should be returned.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Implementing Affine Encryption in Python\n</h2><p> Beginner |  5 minutes</p><p>In this challenge, we will implement the Affine encryption algorithm. The Affine cipher is a substitution cipher that combines the characteristics of the shift cipher and the multiplier cipher. It uses a cryptographic function to encrypt one letter per letter based on a mathematical formula. The objective is to complete the implementation of the affine_encryption(text) function in the affine.py file, which takes a piece of text as input, encrypts it using the Affine cipher, and returns the ciphertext.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Count Each Type Characters\n</h2><p> Beginner |  5 minutes</p><p>In this challenge, we will count the number of letters, spaces, digits, and other characters in a given input. The objective is to correctly categorize and count each type of character. For example, given the input 'abc123EFG *&amp;45?', the expected output would be 'letter=6,space=1,digit=5,other=3'.</p><p>These beginner-friendly challenges are just the beginning of your data science adventure. Each one is designed to build foundational skills, from understanding object-oriented principles to mastering data manipulation and even delving into the fascinating world of cryptography.

Key benefits include enhanced , as sensitive information remains entirely within your own infrastructure, and , enabling uninterrupted work even without internet access. While cloud-based LLM services are convenient, running models locally gives you full control over model behavior, performance tuning, and potential cost savings. This make them ideal for experimentation before running production workloads.</p><p>The ecosystem for local LLMs has matured significantly, with several excellent options available, such as <a href=\"https://ollama.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Ollama</a>, <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-foundry/foundry-local/get-started\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Foundry Local</a>, <a href=\"https://docs.docker.com/ai/model-runner/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Docker Model Runner</a>, and more. Most popular AI/Agent frameworks including <a href=\"https://python.langchain.com/docs/how_to/local_llms/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">LangChain</a> and <a href=\"https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/tutorials/rag/langgraph_self_rag_local\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">LangGraph</a> provide integration with these local model runners, making it easier to integrate them into your projects.</p><p>This blog post will illustrate how to use local LLMs with <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/gen-ai/why-cosmos-ai\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Azure Cosmos DB as a vector database</a> for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) scenarios. It will guide you through setting up a local LLM solution, configuring Azure Cosmos DB, loading data, performing vector searches, and executing RAG queries. You can either use the <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/emulator\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Azure Cosmos DB emulator</a> for local development or connecting to an Azure Cosmos DB account in the cloud. You will be using Ollama (open-source solution) to run LLMs locally on your own machine. It lets you download, run, and interact with a variety of LLMs (like Llama 3, Mistral, and others) using simple commands, without needing cloud access or complex setup.</p><p>By the end of this blog post, you will have a working local RAG setup that leverages Ollama and Azure Cosmos DB. the sample app uses <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/gen-ai/integrations?context=%2Fazure%2Fcosmos-db%2Fnosql%2Fcontext%2Fcontext\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">LangChain integration with Azure Cosmos DB</a> to perform embedding, data loading, and vector search. You can easily adapt it to other frameworks like LlamaIndex.</p><p>To get started with Ollama, follow the <a href=\"https://github.com/ollama/ollama?tab=readme-ov-file#ollama\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">official installation guide</a> on GitHub to install it on your system. The installation process is straightforward across different platforms. For example, on Linux systems, you can install Ollama with a single command:</p><div><pre><code>curl  https://ollama.com/install.sh | sh\n</code></pre></div><p>Once installed, start the Ollama service by running:</p><p>This blog post demonstrates the integration using two specific models from the Ollama library:</p><ul><li> - A high-quality embedding model with 1024 dimensions, ideal for generating vector representations of text</li><li> - The 8B parameter variant of Meta's Llama 3, which serves as our chat model for the RAG pipeline</li></ul><p>Download both models using the following commands. Note that this process may take several minutes depending on your internet connection speed, as these are substantial model files:</p><div><pre><code>ollama pull mxbai-embed-large\nollama pull llama3:8b\n</code></pre></div><h3>\n  \n  \n  Something to keep in mind ...\n</h3><p>While tools like Ollama make it straightforward to run local LLMs, hardware requirements depend on the specific model and your performance expectations. Lightweight models (such as Llama 2 7B or Phi-2) can run on modern CPUs with as little as 8 GB RAM, though performance may be limited. Larger models (like Llama 3 70B or Mixtral) typically require a dedicated GPU with at least 16 GB VRAM for efficient inference. </p><p>Ollama supports both CPU and GPU execution. On CPU-only systems, you can expect slower response times, especially with larger models or concurrent requests. Using a compatible GPU significantly accelerates inference required for demanding workloads.</p><p>Since you're working with local models, you'll likely want to use the Azure Cosmos DB emulator for local development. The emulator provides a local environment that mimics the Azure Cosmos DB service, enabling you to develop and test your applications without incurring costs or requiring an internet connection.</p><p>The emulator is available as a Docker container, which is the recommended way to run it. Here are the steps to pull and start the Cosmos DB emulator. The commands shown are for Linux - <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/how-to-develop-emulator?tabs=docker-linux%2Ccsharp&amp;pivots=api-nosql#start-the-emulator\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">refer to the documentation</a> for other platform options.</p><div><pre><code>docker pull mcr.microsoft.com/cosmosdb/linux/azure-cosmos-emulator:latest\n\ndocker run  8081:8081 1 mcr.microsoft.com/cosmosdb/linux/azure-cosmos-emulator:latest\n</code></pre></div><div><pre><code>curl  https://localhost:8081/_explorer/emulator.pem  ~/emulatorcert.crt\nupdate-ca-certificates\n</code></pre></div><p>You should see output similar to this:</p><div><pre><code>Updating certificates in /etc/ssl/certs...\nrehash: warning: skipping ca-certificates.crt,it does not contain exactly one certificate or CRL\n1 added, 0 removed; done.\nRunning hooks in /etc/ca-certificates/update.d...\ndone.\n</code></pre></div><h2>\n  \n  \n  Load data into Azure Cosmos DB\n</h2><p>Now that both Ollama and Azure Cosmos DB are set up, it's time to populate our vector database with some sample data. For this demonstration, we'll use Azure Cosmos DB's own documentation as our data source. The loader will fetch markdown content directly from the Microsoft Docs repository, specifically focusing on articles about Azure Cosmos DB <a href=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MicrosoftDocs/azure-databases-docs/refs/heads/main/articles/cosmos-db/nosql/vector-search.md\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">vector search</a> functionality.</p><p>Our data loading process will read these documentation articles, generate embeddings using the  model, and store both the content and vector representations in Azure Cosmos DB for retrieval.</p><p>Begin by cloning the GitHub repository containing the sample application:</p><div><pre><code>git clone https://github.com/abhirockzz/local-llms-rag-cosmosdb\nlocal-llms-rag-cosmosdb\n</code></pre></div><p>Before running the loader application, ensure you have Python 3 installed on your system. Create a virtual environment and install the required dependencies:</p><div><pre><code>python3  venv .venv\n .venv/bin/activate\n\npip3  requirements.txt\n</code></pre></div><p>Next, configure the environment variables and execute the loading script. The example below uses the Azure Cosmos DB emulator for local development. If you prefer to use the cloud service instead, simply set the  variable to your Azure Cosmos DB account URL and remove the  variable.</p><div><pre><code>\n\npython3 load_data.py\n</code></pre></div><p>The script will automatically create the database and container if they don't already exist. Once the data loading process completes successfully, you should see output similar to this:</p><div><pre><code>Uploading documents to Azure Cosmos DB ['https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MicrosoftDocs/azure-databases-docs/refs/heads/main/articles/cosmos-db/nosql/vector-search.md', 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MicrosoftDocs/azure-databases-docs/refs/heads/main/articles/cosmos-db/nosql/multi-tenancy-vector-search.md']\nUsing database: rag_local_llm_db, container: docs\nUsing embedding model: mxbai-embed-large with dimensions: 1024\nCreated instance of AzureCosmosDBNoSqlVectorSearch\nLoading 26 document chunks from 2 documents\nData loaded into Azure Cosmos DB\n</code></pre></div><p>To confirm that your data has been loaded successfully, you can inspect the results using the Azure Cosmos DB Data Explorer. If you're using the emulator, navigate to <code>https://localhost:8081/_explorer/index.html</code> in your browser. You should see the same number of documents in your container as the number of chunks reported by the loader application.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Run vector search queries\n</h2><p>Now that your data is loaded, let's test the vector search functionality. Set the same environment variables used for data loading and run the vector search script with your desired query:</p><div><pre><code>\n\npython3 vector_search.py </code></pre></div><p>The script will process your query through the embedding model and perform a similarity search against the stored document vectors. You should see output similar to the following:</p><div><pre><code>Searching top 5 results for query: \"show me an example of a vector embedding policy\"\n\nUsing database: rag_local_llm_db, container: docs\nUsing embedding model: mxbai-embed-large with dimensions: 1024\nCreated instance of AzureCosmosDBNoSqlVectorSearch\nScore: 0.7437641827298191\nContent: ```\n\n\n\n### A policy with two vector paths\n//....\n\n\n</code></pre></div><p>The output shows the top five results ordered by their similarity scores, with higher scores indicating better matches to your query.</p><blockquote><p>To modify the number of results returned, you can add the  argument. For example, to retrieve the top 10 results, run: <code>python3 vector_search.py \"show me an example of a vector embedding policy\" 10</code></p></blockquote><h2>\n  \n  \n  Execute Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) queries\n</h2><p>Now we will put it all together with an simple chat based interface that leverages the  model to generate responses based on the contextual information retrieved from Azure Cosmos DB.</p><p>Configure the environment variables needed for the RAG application and launch the script:</p><div><pre><code>\nbash\n# export COSMOS_DB_URL=\"https://&lt;Cosmos DB account name&gt;.documents.azure.com:443/\"\nexport USE_EMULATOR=\"true\"\nexport DATABASE_NAME=\"rag_local_llm_db\"\nexport CONTAINER_NAME=\"docs\"\nexport EMBEDDINGS_MODEL=\"mxbai-embed-large\"\nexport DIMENSIONS=\"1024\"\nexport CHAT_MODEL=\"llama3\"\n\npython3 rag_chain.py\n\n\n</code></pre></div><p>Once the application initializes, you'll see output confirming the RAG chain setup:</p><div><pre><code>\ntext\nBuilding RAG chain. Using model: llama3\nUsing database: rag_local_llm_db, container: docs\nUsing embedding model: mxbai-embed-large with dimensions: 1024\nCreated instance of AzureCosmosDBNoSqlVectorSearch\nEnter your questions below. Type 'exit' to quit, 'clear' to clear chat history, 'history' to view chat history.\n[User]:\n\n\n</code></pre></div><p>Ask questions about the Azure Cosmos DB vector search documentation that you've loaded. For instance, try asking <code>show me an example of a vector embedding policy</code>, and you'll see a response like this (note that these may vary slightly for your case, even across different runs):</p><div><pre><code>\ntext\n//...\n[User]: show me an example of a vector embedding policy\n[Assistant]: Here is an example of a vector embedding policy:\n\n{\n    \"vectorEmbeddings\": [\n        {\n            \"path\":\"/vector1\",\n            \"dataType\":\"float32\",\n            \"distanceFunction\":\"cosine\",\n            \"dimensions\":1536\n        },\n        {\n            \"path\":\"/vector2\",\n            \"dataType\":\"int8\",\n            \"distanceFunction\":\"dotproduct\",\n            \"dimensions\":100\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nThis policy defines two vector embeddings: one with the path `/vector1`, using `float32` data type, cosine distance function, and having 1536 dimensions; and another with the path `/vector2`, using `int8` data type, dot product distance function, and having 100 dimensions.\n\n\n</code></pre></div><p>To further explore the capabilities of your RAG system, try these additional example queries:</p><ul><li>\"What is the maximum supported dimension for vector embeddings in Azure Cosmos DB?\"</li><li>\"Is it suitable for large scale data?\"</li><li>\"Is there a benefit to using the flat index type?\"</li></ul><blockquote><p>You can enter 'exit' to quit the application, 'clear' to clear chat history, or 'history' to view your previous interactions. Feel free to experiment with different data sources and queries. To modify the number of vector search results used as context, you can add the  environment variable (defaults to 5).</p></blockquote><p>In this walkthrough, you followed step-by-step instructions to set up a complete RAG application that runs entirely on your local infrastructure ‚Äî from installing and configuring Ollama with embedding and chat models, to setting up Azure Cosmos DB for vector storage, loading documentation data, and running using RAG through an interactive chat interface.</p><p>Running models locally brings clear advantages in terms of costs, data privacy, and     connectivity constraints. However, you need to plan for appropriate hardware, particularly for larger models that perform best with dedicated GPUs and sufficient memory. The trade-off between model size, performance, and resource requirements is crucial when planning your local AI setup.</p><p>Have you experimented with local LLMs in your projects?

It's a fantastic tool, but it has one strict requirement: your mock expectations must  match the SQL queries your code generates.</p><p>This can get tricky when using an ORM like GORM. GORM is great for productivity, but the SQL it generates under the hood‚Äîespecially for complex operations like  with multiple index creations‚Äîisn't always obvious. We found ourselves in a cycle of \"guess, run, fail, repeat.\"</p><p>So, how do you find out the  SQL GORM is trying to run?</p><p>We've settled on a simple, iterative debugging workflow that turns this guessing game into a straightforward process. Here‚Äôs how we do it.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  The Challenge: Unpredictable SQL\n</h2><p>The core problem is that  fails if the expected query string doesn't match the actual query string. With GORM's , for example, the order in which it decides to create tables and indexes can change as you add new models or even between GORM versions. You might expect  before , but GORM does the opposite, and your test fails with a cryptic message.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  The Technique: Let the ORM Tell You What It's Doing\n</h2><p>Instead of trying to guess the SQL, we make GORM tell us directly. The key is its built-in logger.</p><p>Here's our step-by-step process:</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Step 1: Isolate the Failing Test\n</h3><p>Run your tests and find the first  expectation that fails. The error message is your starting point. It will usually say something like:\nError: call to ExecQuery '...' with args [...] was not expected, next expectation is: ...</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Step 2: Enable Verbose Logging\n</h3><p>In your test setup where you initialize your GORM connection with the mocked SQL connection, temporarily switch the GORM logger to  mode.</p><pre>// In your test file...\nimport \"gorm.io/gorm/logger\"\n\n// ...\n\n// Temporarily change logger.Silent to logger.Info\ngormDB, err := gorm.Open(dialector, &amp;gorm.Config{ Logger: logger.Default.LogMode(logger.Info), })</pre><h3>\n  \n  \n  Step 3: Run the Test and Observe\n</h3><p>Run the single failing test again (e.g., <code>go test -run TestMyFailingTest</code>). Now, look at your console output. Because the logger is in  mode, GORM will print the exact SQL query it's generating, right before  reports the failure.</p><p>The output will look something like this:</p><p><code>[info] /path/to/your/code.go:123 [SQL] CREATE INDEX \"idx_commission_withdrawals_timestamp\" ON \"commission_withdrawals\" (\"timestamp\") ... [error] ExecQuery: could not match actual sql: \"CREATE INDEX...\" with expected regexp \"CREATE INDEX...recipient_address...\"</code></p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Step 4: Copy, Paste, and Adapt\n</h3><p>The \"actual sql\" from the log is the source of truth.</p><ol><li> the SQL query from the log output.</li><li> it into your test file, replacing or reordering the incorrect expectation in  or .</li><li> it for . You might need to escape special characters for the regex matcher (like parentheses  and ).</li></ol><p>Your test will now pass the first expectation and likely fail on the next one in the sequence.

And I wrote this newsletter to make the key concepts simple and easy for you.</p><p><em>Note: This post is based on my research and may differ from real-world implementation.</em></p><p>Once upon a time, there lived a data analyst named Maria.</p><p>She emailed draft copies many times to different people to prepare monthly reports.</p><p>So she wasted a ton of time and was frustrated.</p><p>Until one day, when she decides to use Google Docs for it.</p><p>Google Docs allows collaborative editing over the internet. It means many users can work on the same document in real-time.</p><p>Yet it‚Äôs difficult to implement Google Docs correctly for 3 reasons:</p><ul><li><p>Concurrent changes to the same document should converge to the same version.</p></li><li><p>Concurrent changes to the same document must avoid conflicts.</p></li><li><p>Any changes should be visible in real-time to each user.</p></li></ul><p>Also a user should be able to make changes while they‚Äôre offline.</p><p>A simple approach to handle concurrency is using pessimistic concurrency control.</p><p>is amechanism for handling concurrency using a lock. It offers strong consistency, but doesn‚Äôt support collaborative editing in real-time. Because it needs a central coordinator to handle data changes, only 1 user can edit at a time. Put simply, only a single document copy is available for write operations at once, while other document copies are read-only.</p><p>Besides it doesn‚Äôt support offline changes.</p><p>Also a network round-trip across the Earth takes 200 milliseconds. </p><p>This might cause a poor user experience. So they do  The idea is to keep a document copy for each user locally and then run operations locally for high responsiveness. Thus creating the illusion of lower latency than reality.</p><p>And the system propagates the changes to all users for consistency.</p><p>A simple approach for latency hiding is using the mechanism.</p><p>Yet it resolves a conflict without waiting for coordination by applying the most recent update. So there‚Äôs a risk of data loss when there are concurrent changes in high-latency networks.</p><p>It might be a good choice when concurrency is low. But it isn‚Äôt suitable for this use case.</p><p>An alternative approach to latency hiding is through <strong>differential synchronization</strong>.</p><p>It keeps a document copy for each user and tracks the changes locally. The system doesn‚Äôt send the entire document when something changes, but only the difference ().</p><p>Yet there‚Äôs a performance overhead in sending a diff for every change. Also differential synchronization only tracks diffs, and not the reason behind a change. So conflict resolution might be difficult.</p><p>While resolving conflicts manually affects the user experience.</p><p>OT is an algorithm to show document changes without wait times on high-latency networks. It allows different document copies to accept write operations at once. Also it handles conflict resolution automatically without locks or user interventions. </p><p>Besides OT tolerates divergence among document copies and converges them later.</p><p>Think of <strong>operational transformation</strong> as an event-passing mechanism; it ensures each user has the same document state even with unsynchronized changes.</p><p>With OT, the system saves each change as an event. Put simply, a change doesn‚Äôt affect the underlying character of a document; instead, it adds an event to the revision log. The system then displays the document by replaying the revision log from its start.</p><p>Operational transformation saves a document as a set of operations, but it's complex to implement properly.</p><h2>How Does Google Docs Work</h2><p>Google Docs uses a client-server architecture for simplicity.</p>","contentLength":3631,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/4b73f9d4-a8d6-4101-9dff-df53a7332de1_1280x720.png","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Create a Real-Time Chat App with Python, WebSockets, and FastAPI","url":"https://dev.to/djamware_tutorial_eba1a61/create-a-real-time-chat-app-with-python-websockets-and-fastapi-24h2","date":1755863151,"author":"Djamware Tutorial","guid":236872,"unread":true,"content":"<p>In this guide, you‚Äôll learn how to:</p><ul><li>Use FastAPI with WebSockets for real-time communication</li><li>Broadcast chat messages to all users</li><li>Extend with multiple rooms and Redis Pub/Sub</li><li>Deploy and test your chat app</li></ul>","contentLength":201,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"10 Must-Ask Interview Questions for Python Developers","url":"https://dev.to/jessica_marious/10-must-ask-interview-questions-for-python-developers-4i1g","date":1755862420,"author":"Jessica Marious","guid":236871,"unread":true,"content":"<p>Python has evolved from a simple scripting tool into one of the most widely used programming languages across web development, automation, data science, and machine learning. In 2025, finding the right <a href=\"https://www.onboardnow.ai/hire/python/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Python developer for hire</a> is more critical than ever. </p><p>The challenge is that not every candidate with ‚ÄúPython experience‚Äù can build, scale, and maintain production-ready applications. A well-structured interview process is key to identifying developers who can write clean code and solve real problems effectively. </p><p>This guide brings together 15 essential interview questions for Python developers. These questions cover fundamentals, coding skills, and problem-solving approaches, helping recruiters, hiring managers, and even developers preparing for interviews navigate the process with confidence. </p><h2>\n  \n  \n  1. What are Python‚Äôs key features?\n</h2><p>This is a classic opener that helps you gauge how well a candidate understands Python‚Äôs fundamentals. A good developer should mention things like: </p><ul><li>Python is interpreted and dynamically typed.\n</li><li>It emphasizes readability and simplicity (thanks to indentation). </li><li>It supports multiple programming paradigms (object-oriented, functional, procedural). </li><li>It has a huge ecosystem of libraries and frameworks.</li></ul><p>Strong candidates usually go beyond buzzwords and give examples. For instance, they might mention how Python‚Äôs extensive community support makes troubleshooting easier, or how dynamic typing speeds up prototyping. </p><h2>\n  \n  \n  2. Explain Python‚Äôs memory management.\n</h2><p>This question checks whether the developer understands what‚Äôs happening under the hood. Python manages memory using: </p><ul><li>Reference counting and garbage collection for unused objects. </li><li>Memory pools (like PyMalloc) to optimize allocation. </li><li>Developers can use modules like gc to interact with the garbage collector. </li></ul><h2>\n  \n  \n  3. What are Python‚Äôs built-in data types and data structures?\n</h2><p>Expect candidates to cover: </p><ul><li>Basic data types: int, float, str, bool. </li><li>Collection types: list, tuple, set, dict. </li><li>Advanced: frozenset, deque from collections, or even dataclasses. </li></ul><p>An excellent candidate won‚Äôt just list them but will explain use cases. For instance, why you‚Äôd use a tuple instead of a list (immutability, hashability), or when a dictionary is more efficient than nested lists. </p><h2>\n  \n  \n  4. Explain inheritance and polymorphism in Python.\n</h2><p>Since Python is object-oriented, this is a must-ask. Candidates should explain: </p><p> allows a class to derive attributes and methods from another. </p><p> allows different classes to define methods with the same name but potentially different behavior. </p><h2>\n  \n  \n  5. What are decorators, and how are they used?\n</h2><p>Decorators are a hot topic in Python interviews because they test both technical depth and practical coding skills. Candidates should say: </p><p>Decorators are functions that wrap other functions to modify their behavior without changing their code. </p><p>They‚Äôre widely used in frameworks like Flask (<a href=\"//mailto:@app.route\">@app.route</a>) or Django (@login_required). </p><p>def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):  </p><p>print(f\"Calling {func.name}\")  </p><p>return func(*args, **kwargs)  </p><p>This shows how decorators add functionality in a clean, reusable way. </p><h2>\n  \n  \n  6. What‚Äôs the difference between @staticmethod, @classmethod, and instance methods?\n</h2><p>This question checks if candidates can distinguish between method types: </p><ul><li> Regular methods, take self, operate on an instance. </li><li> Use @classmethod, take cls, often used for alternative constructors. </li><li> Use @staticmethod, don‚Äôt need self or cls, utility functions inside a class.</li></ul><p>An advanced developer may explain when to use them. For example, using a classmethod to create objects from different input formats (like from_json). </p><h2>\n  \n  \n  7. Explain Python‚Äôs Global Interpreter Lock (GIL).\n</h2><p>If you‚Äôre hiring for performance-heavy roles, this is essential.

There may be a question in the head after hearing this, \"How is that possible?\" You need another Go compiler to make a Go compiler, right? \"\nIt's a classic \"egg before or chicken before\" kind of question. And the answer lies in a cool computer science concept called Bootstrapping.<p>\nWhat is the Bootstrapping thing?</p>\nIn simple terms, bootstrapping is using a small or simple system to create a bigger and stronger system. Something like lifting yourself up by holding your shoe lace! This is exactly what happened to Go.<p>\nLet's see how it works step by step:</p></p><ol><li>The first compiler was written in another language:\nThe first compiler of Go was not written in Go language. It was written using C language. This C-based compiler had only one job: compiling the Go Source Code into an executable program.</li><li>Written a new compiler with Go:\nAfter that, Go developers wrote the source code for a whole new compiler using Go language.</li><li>The real magic: \nBootstrapping is done in this stage. The Go Team used their old compiler made with C to compile the source code of the new compiler written with Go. So they got a compiler (executable file) made of Go.</li><li>Go Self-Sufficient: \nOnce Go could build his own compiler, there was no need for the old C-based compiler. From now on Go starts building himself.\nMeans, Go 1.4 is used to compile the Go 1.5 version. Used Go 1.5 to compile Go 1.6 again This is how the chain goes.\nSo, next time you hear \"Go is written in Go\", don't be surprised! This bootstrapping method uses not only Go, but also large programming language like C, Rust, Java. This is the sign of maturity or maturity of a language.\nSome questions may arise in your mind as such:\nQ: What is the advantage or profit of this? Wouldn't the compiler made of C be faster?\nAnswer: There are many benefits such as maintenance, contributor productivity, tooling consistency, portability, and feature development speed etc. will be easy. Many common bug of RC can be avoided.\nQ:At the end of the day, then, the base of the Go compiler is in C, right?\nAnswer: A compiler written in C, called the C-Compiler, is used to build the first version of the Go compiler from its Go source code. This process creates an executable file: go_compiler_v1.exe. Next, go_compiler_v1.exe is used to compile a newer version of the Go source code. This creates go_compiler_v2.exe, which can then be used to compile the next version, and so on. Thus, the C-Compiler is no longer needed.\nQ: Isn't it the same for Java?\nAnswer: Many important languages follow the bootstrapping technique, but by no means is it a universal rule for success.</li></ol>","contentLength":2693,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Dev Gets 4 Years For Creating Kill Switch On Ex-Employer's Systems","url":"https://yro.slashdot.org/story/25/08/22/0039200/dev-gets-4-years-for-creating-kill-switch-on-ex-employers-systems?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&utm_medium=feed","date":1755856800,"author":"BeauHD","guid":236821,"unread":true,"content":"Davis Lu, a former Eaton Corporation developer, has been sentenced to four years in prison for sabotaging his ex-employer's Windows network with malware and a custom kill switch that locked out thousands of employees once his account was disabled.

BleepingComputer reports: After a corporate restructuring and subsequent demotion in 2018, the DOJ says that Lu retaliated by embedding malicious code throughout the company's Windows production environment. The malicious code included an infinite Java thread loop designed to overwhelm servers and crash production systems. Lu also created a kill switch named \"IsDLEnabledinAD\" (\"Is Davis Lu enabled in Active Directory\") that would automatically lock all users out of their accounts if his account was disabled in Active Directory. When his employment was terminated on September 9, 2019, and his account disabled, the kill switch activated, causing thousands of users to be locked out of their systems.\n \n\"The defendant breached his employer's trust by using his access and technical knowledge to sabotage company networks, wreaking havoc and causing hundreds of thousands of dollars in losses for a U.S. company,\" said Acting Assistant Attorney General Matthew R. Galeotti. When he was instructed to return his laptop, Lu reportedly deleted encrypted data from his device. Investigators later discovered search queries on the device researching how to elevate privileges, hide processes, and quickly delete files.

I had a sleek WebUI, metadata management, and a FastAPI backend. Everything looked promising on paper. Then I stumbled across a Reddit post that changed everything.</p><p>A frustrated developer was complaining about Great Expectations: \"Too complex, too many dependencies. I don't want a 'data quality platform'‚ÄîI want a 'data validation function'.\"</p><p>That hit me like a cold shower. Here I was, building exactly what this person  want.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Why Build a Data Validation Tool?\n</h3><p>As a seasoned data architect who'd led Java-based data quality tools before, I thought I understood the problem.  seemed straightforward enough. With AI pair programming on the rise, why not leverage my domain knowledge and let AI handle the coding gaps?</p><p>My initial vision was ambitious: a WebUI-based tool with metadata configuration, connection management, rule execution, and result visualization. I chose Streamlit for the frontend and FastAPI for the backend, aiming for something lightweight yet comprehensive.</p><p>But \"lightweight\" quickly became anything but.</p><p>After two months of development, I realized I'd made four critical mistakes:</p><ol><li><p> - I had a PRD but no detailed functional specs. AI filled the gaps by expanding features I never asked for.</p></li><li><p> - Especially around API interfaces, leading to two painful refactors mid-development.</p></li><li><p><strong>Overestimating AI capabilities</strong> - I lacked experience in driving AI for app development, despite my software engineering background.</p></li><li><p><strong>Perfectionism killing the MVP</strong> - I added complex features like multi-rule execution for single tables and obsessed over test coverage.</p></li></ol><p>The  was real. I'd drifted far from my  goals.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  The Four Questions That Changed Everything\n</h3><p>That Reddit post forced me to ask myself some uncomfortable questions:</p><ul><li>Does my product really need to maintain a metadata layer?</li><li>Is my core engine small and beautiful enough to support different deployment scenarios?</li><li>Is WebUI actually necessary for my target users?</li><li>What's the most valuable part of my product, and is it truly at the center?</li></ul><p>Once I asked the right questions, the answers became painfully obvious. My ‚Äîdata engineers and analysts‚Äîdidn't want another platform. They wanted a tool that could validate data with a single command, SQL query, or script.</p><p>I made a tough decision: scrap the half-built WebUI version and extract the rule engine as a standalone CLI tool.</p><p>But there was a problem. The rule engine was tightly coupled with other modules, especially through ORM models designed for metadata persistence. This violated basic  I knew by heart but had somehow ignored in practice.</p><blockquote><p>\"Technical debt must be paid. I couldn't justify keeping legacy code just to maintain backward compatibility.\"</p></blockquote><p>I redesigned the interface using a clean schema model in a shared module, refactored twice to internalize configuration management and error handling, and finally achieved a truly independent core module.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Building an App with Python: Lessons Learned\n</h2><p>Working on this  project taught me that domain expertise doesn't automatically translate to implementation wisdom. When I lacked confidence in Python project structure, I defaulted to AI suggestions‚Äînot always the best approach.</p><p>The refactoring process was painful but necessary. I couldn't  by pushing it to future versions. Clean architecture isn't just academic theory; it's survival for any product that plans to evolve.</p><p>Now I have a completed CLI module with comprehensive tests, and the first version has been released on GitHub and PyPI.

Version 1 focuses on single-table rules, but the architecture supports:</p><ul><li>Multi-table relationships</li><li>Cross-database validation</li><li>Web UI and cloud deployment</li></ul><p>The goal isn't to replace your entire data infrastructure - it's to make data quality checking so easy that you actually do it.</p><p><strong>Data validation shouldn't require a dedicated team and six months of setup.</strong> It should be as simple as running a command and getting actionable results.</p><p>That's what I'm building.

Sounds like science fiction? Not anymore. This is the power of neural networks, a cornerstone of modern machine learning. This article will demystify the fundamental building blocks of neural networks: perceptrons and activation functions, providing a clear path for both beginners and those looking to solidify their understanding.</p><p>At its heart, a neural network is a collection of interconnected nodes, inspired by the biological structure of the human brain. The simplest of these nodes is the perceptron ‚Äì a single-layer neural network. Think of it as a simplified model of a neuron, receiving input, processing it, and producing an output.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  The Math Behind the Magic\n</h3><p>A perceptron takes multiple inputs ($x_1, x_2, ..., x_n$), each weighted by a corresponding weight ($w_1, w_2, ..., w_n$). These weighted inputs are summed, and a bias ($b$) is added. This sum is then passed through an activation function to produce the output. Let's break it down:</p><ol><li>  $z = w_1x_1 + w_2x_2 + ... + w_nx_n + b$</li><li> $a = f(z)$  where 'a' is the output and 'f' is the activation function.</li></ol><p>Let's visualize this with a simple example: imagine a perceptron deciding whether to buy a stock based on two factors: price ($x_1$) and volume ($x_2$). Each factor has a weight reflecting its importance, and the bias represents a general market sentiment.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><h3>\n  \n  \n  The Role of Weights and Bias\n</h3><p>The weights determine the influence of each input on the output. A higher weight signifies a stronger influence. The bias acts as a threshold; it adjusts the activation function's output, allowing the perceptron to activate even when the weighted sum is close to zero. Learning in a perceptron involves adjusting these weights and bias to minimize errors.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Activation Functions: Introducing Non-Linearity\n</h2><p>The activation function is the crucial ingredient that introduces non-linearity into the perceptron. Without it, the perceptron would only be capable of performing linear classifications ‚Äì severely limiting its power. Several activation functions exist, each with its strengths and weaknesses.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Popular Activation Functions\n</h3><ul><li><p>  This is the simplest activation function. It outputs 1 if the weighted sum is above a threshold (usually 0) and 0 otherwise.  It's computationally efficient but lacks the nuance of other functions.</p></li><li><p> This function outputs a value between 0 and 1, making it suitable for binary classification problems. Its smooth, S-shaped curve allows for better gradient descent during training.  The formula is:  $œÉ(z) = \\frac{1}{1 + e^{-z}}$</p></li><li><p><strong>ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit):</strong>  ReLU outputs the input if it's positive and 0 otherwise. It's computationally efficient and helps mitigate the vanishing gradient problem (a common issue in deep neural networks).  $ReLU(z) = max(0, z)$</p></li></ul><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><h2>\n  \n  \n  Applications and Real-World Impact\n</h2><p>Perceptrons, though simple, form the basis of more complex neural networks. They are used in various applications, including:</p><ul><li> Spam detection, medical diagnosis (e.g., identifying cancerous cells).</li><li><strong>Simple Pattern Recognition:</strong>  Recognizing handwritten digits (though more complex networks are usually employed for better accuracy).</li><li><strong>Building Blocks for Larger Networks:</strong>  Perceptrons are the fundamental units in multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) and other sophisticated architectures.</li></ul><h2>\n  \n  \n  Challenges and Limitations\n</h2><p>While perceptrons are powerful building blocks, they have limitations:</p><ul><li>  They can only classify linearly separable data.  This means they struggle with datasets where the classes cannot be separated by a straight line (or hyperplane in higher dimensions).</li><li>  Single-layer perceptrons are not capable of solving complex problems requiring non-linear decision boundaries.</li></ul><h2>\n  \n  \n  The Future of Perceptrons and Activation Functions\n</h2><p>Despite their limitations, perceptrons and activation functions remain central to the field of neural networks. Ongoing research focuses on developing new and more efficient activation functions to address challenges like the vanishing gradient problem and improve the performance of deep learning models. The exploration of novel architectures built upon these fundamental components continues to push the boundaries of what's possible in artificial intelligence.

Think of GC as a backstage crew cleaning up memory your program no longer needs. But if it‚Äôs too aggressive, you get latency spikes; too lax, and you risk memory bloat or crashes.</p><p>This guide is for Go developers with 1-2 years of experience who want to level up. We‚Äôll unpack how Go‚Äôs GC triggers, share tuning tips with  and , and dive into real-world examples that slashed latency and boosted throughput. Expect practical code, common pitfalls, and tools like  to make your apps faster and leaner. Let‚Äôs tame Go‚Äôs GC and make your programs scream!</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  1. Go GC Basics: What‚Äôs Happening Under the Hood?\n</h3><p>Go uses a <strong>concurrent mark-and-sweep GC</strong>, cleaning memory while your program runs to minimize pauses (Stop-The-World or STW). Here‚Äôs the breakdown:</p><ul><li>: Identifies objects still in use.</li><li>: Frees unused memory.</li><li>: Decides  GC runs, based on heap growth and settings like .</li></ul><p>Since Go 1.5, GC is concurrent, and Go 1.8+ added smarter write barriers, making it ideal for high-concurrency apps like web servers. But without tuning, you might face jittery APIs or crashes in memory-constrained environments like Kubernetes. Let‚Äôs explore when GC kicks in.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  2. When Does GC Run? Understanding Trigger Conditions\n</h3><p>GC triggers aren‚Äôt random‚Äîthey‚Äôre driven by specific conditions. Knowing these lets you predict and control GC behavior.</p><h4>\n  \n  \n  2.1 Memory Allocation Trigger (GOGC)\n</h4><p>The primary trigger is heap growth, controlled by the  environment variable (default: 100). GC runs when the heap doubles the live heap (active memory). The formula is:</p><p><strong>next_gc = live_heap * (1 + GOGC/100)</strong></p><p>For a 100MB live heap with , GC triggers at 200MB. Lower  (e.g., 50) increases GC frequency, saving memory but using more CPU. Higher  (e.g., 200) delays GC, boosting throughput but risking memory spikes.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Run with :</p><div><pre><code>$ GODEBUG=gctrace=1 go run main.go\ngc 1 @0.019s 4%: 0.030+1.2+0.010 ms clock, 4-&gt;4-&gt;2 MB\n</code></pre></div><p>This shows GC took 1.2ms, reducing the heap from 4MB to 2MB.</p><p>Since Go 1.9, GC runs every 2 minutes, even with low allocations. This prevents long-running apps (e.g., background workers) from holding memory forever. It‚Äôs non-disableable, so plan for it in low-allocation services.</p><p>You can force GC with , but use it sparingly (e.g., batch jobs or debugging). Overuse disrupts the Pacer, spiking CPU.</p><h4>\n  \n  \n  2.4 Real-World Example: Fixing API Latency\n</h4><p>In a high-traffic API, P99 latency hit 300ms due to frequent JSON allocations triggering GC 10 times per second. Using , we confirmed the issue. Bumping  to 150 reduced GC frequency, cutting latency by 20% with a slight memory increase. Small tweaks, big wins.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  3. Tuning GC: Your Knobs and Levers\n</h3><p>Triggers set  GC runs; parameters control  it behaves. Let‚Äôs explore  and .</p><h4>\n  \n  \n  3.1 GOGC: Control the Pace\n</h4><p> dictates GC frequency:</p><ul><li>: Less frequent GC, ideal for high-throughput batch jobs, but uses more memory.</li><li>: More frequent GC, great for low-latency APIs or memory-constrained setups.</li></ul><p>: Start at , then adjust. Try  for APIs,  for batch jobs.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><h4>\n  \n  \n  3.2 GOMEMLIMIT: Set a Memory Cap\n</h4><p>Since Go 1.19,  caps total memory (heap + stack). When nearing the limit, GC runs more often to avoid crashes‚Äîperfect for containers.</p><p>: Set  to 80-90% of your container‚Äôs memory to account for system overhead.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Run with  to monitor.</p><h4>\n  \n  \n  3.3 Debugging with GODEBUG\n</h4><p> logs GC details:</p><ul></ul><div><pre><code>gc 1 @0.019s 4%: 0.030+1.2+0.010 ms clock, 0.12+0.68/1.1/0.23+0.040 ms cpu, 4-&gt;4-&gt;2 MB\n</code></pre></div><p>Use it to spot excessive GC or memory leaks.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  4. Code-Level Tricks to Ease GC Pressure\n</h3><p>Tuning parameters is only half the battle‚Äîwriting GC-friendly code is key to reducing memory allocations and keeping your app fast. Here are four techniques, with code examples, pitfalls, and pro tips to make your Go programs lean.</p><h4>\n  \n  \n  4.1 Reuse Objects with </h4><p>Frequent allocations (e.g., JSON buffers in APIs) trigger GC too often.  lets you reuse objects, slashing allocations. Think of it as a recycling bin for temporary objects.</p><p>: Reusing buffers in a web server.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>: Reusing buffers avoids new allocations, cutting GC runs by 30-50% in high-traffic APIs.</p><p>: Forgetting to reset buffers can leak data. Always clear them before returning to the pool.</p><p>: Use  for short-lived objects like buffers or temporary structs, but avoid it for complex, long-lived objects, as the pool may retain them unnecessarily.</p><h4>\n  \n  \n  4.2 Optimize Data Structures\n</h4><p>Poor data structures balloon memory, overworking GC. Two strategies:</p><ul><li>: Dynamic resizing via  doubles memory during growth. Use  to set capacity upfront.</li><li>: Large allocations (e.g., 10MB slices) are tough for GC. Use smaller chunks.</li></ul><p>: Pre-allocating slices for log processing.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>: Pre-allocation avoids resizing, reducing GC triggers. In a test with 1M logs, this cut GC runs by 40%.</p><p>: Overestimating capacity wastes memory. Estimate based on typical data sizes.</p><h4>\n  \n  \n  4.3 Use  for String Operations\n</h4><p>String concatenation with  creates new strings, piling up allocations.  builds strings efficiently by growing its internal buffer.</p><p>: Efficient log message construction.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>:  minimizes allocations, reducing GC frequency by up to 25% in stream processing apps.</p><p>: Don‚Äôt reuse  without calling , especially in loops or pools.</p><h4>\n  \n  \n  4.4 Monitor and Profile Allocations\n</h4><p>Use tools to find and fix allocation hotspots:</p><ul><li>: Profiles memory/CPU usage. Run <code>go tool pprof http://localhost:6060/debug/pprof/heap</code> to analyze.</li><li>: Tracks heap size and GC stats.</li><li>: Monitors production metrics.</li></ul><p>: Checking memory stats.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>: Combine , pre-allocation, , and profiling to minimize GC pressure. Let‚Äôs see these in action.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  5. Real-World Wins: GC Tuning in Action\n</h3><p>Here are three real-world scenarios where GC tuning and code optimization transformed performance. Each includes the problem, solutions, code, results, and tools used.</p><h4>\n  \n  \n  5.1 High-Traffic API Service\n</h4><p>: A REST API handling 10,000 QPS had P99 latency spikes of 300ms.  revealed frequent JSON response allocations triggering GC 15 times per second, hogging CPU.</p><ol><li>Increased  from 100 to 150 to reduce GC frequency.</li><li>Used  for JSON buffers.</li><li>Pre-allocated response slices with .</li></ol><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><ul><li>P99 latency dropped from 300ms to 210ms (30% improvement).</li><li>Throughput rose from 5000 to 5750 QPS (15% boost).</li><li>GC frequency fell from 15 to 8 times per second.</li></ul><p>:  identified allocation hotspots; Prometheus+Grafana monitored latency and GC metrics.</p><p>: A bar chart comparing P99 latency and throughput before/after.

Conceived in 1884 as an entrance arch to the 1889 World's Fair, this towering structure has captivated millions of visitors over the years. But what's the science behind this intriguing phenomenon?</p><p>Firstly, let's understand the design of the Eiffel Tower. It consists of three levels, with the first level being the lowest at 57 meters and the third level reaching a staggering height of 324 meters. The tower is made primarily of iron, which expands when heated. This expansion is what causes the tower to grow taller during the summer months.</p><p>Each year, as the sun beats down on the tower, the metal absorbs heat energy. This causes the iron to expand, creating a slight increase in the tower's overall height. However, this growth is so minute that it's almost imperceptible to the naked eye. In fact, if you were to measure the tower's height every day, you might not even notice the change!</p><p>But here's where things get really interesting. The expansion of the Eiffel Tower isn't uniform across its entire surface. Instead, it occurs most significantly at the points where the metal meets the concrete foundation. This is because the concrete absorbs heat more slowly than the metal, creating a gradient in temperature that causes the metal to expand more rapidly at the base.</p><p>As a result, each year, the Eiffel Tower grows slightly taller at the bottom and remains the same height at the top. Over time, this difference in growth rates has led to a noticeable increase in the tower's overall height. In fact, since its construction, the Eiffel Tower has grown a staggering 18 centimeters taller!</p><p>So, the next time you visit the Eiffel Tower, take a moment to marvel at this fascinating physics phenomenon.

SageMaker HyperPod recipes help you get started with training and fine-tuning popular publicly available foundation models (FMs) such as Meta‚Äôs Llama, Mistral, and DeepSeek in just minutes, using either SageMaker HyperPod or training jobs. The recipes provide pre-built, validated configurations that alleviate the complexity of setting up distributed training environments while maintaining enterprise-grade performance and scalability for models. We outline steps to fine-tune the GPT-OSS model on a multilingual reasoning dataset, <a href=\"https://huggingface.co/datasets/HuggingFaceH4/Multilingual-Thinking\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">HuggingFaceH4/Multilingual-Thinking</a>, so GPT-OSS can handle structured, chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning across multiple languages.</p><p>This solution uses SageMaker HyperPod recipes to run a fine-tuning job on HyperPod using <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/eks/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service</a> (Amazon EKS) orchestration or training jobs. Recipes are processed through the SageMaker HyperPod recipe launcher, which serves as the orchestration layer responsible for launching a job on the corresponding architecture such as SageMaker HyperPod (Slurm or Amazon EKS) or training jobs. To learn more, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/sagemaker-hyperpod-recipes.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">SageMaker HyperPod recipes</a>.</p><p>In the following sections, we discuss the prerequisites for both options, and then move on to the data preparation. The prepared data is saved to <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/fsx/lustre/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Amazon FSx for Lustre</a>, which is used as the persistent file system for SageMaker HyperPod, or <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/s3/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Amazon Simple Storage Service</a> (Amazon S3) for training jobs. We then use recipes to submit the fine-tuning job, and finally deploy the trained model to a SageMaker endpoint for testing and evaluating the model. The following diagram illustrates this architecture.</p><p>To follow along, you must have the following prerequisites:</p><ul><li>A local development environment with AWS credentials configured for creating and accessing SageMaker resources, or a remote environment such as <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/ai/studio/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Amazon SageMaker Studio</a>.</li><li>For fine-tuning the model using SageMaker training jobs, you must have one ml.p5.48xlarge instance (with 8 x NVIDIA H100 GPUs) for training jobs usage. If you don‚Äôt have sufficient limits, request the following SageMaker quotas on the <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/servicequotas/latest/userguide/intro.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Service Quotas</a> console: P5 instance (ml.p5.48xlarge) for training jobs (ml.p5.48xlarge for cluster usage): 1.</li></ul><p>We use the <a href=\"https://huggingface.co/datasets/HuggingFaceH4/Multilingual-Thinking\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Hugging FaceH4/Multilingual-Thinking</a> dataset, which is a multilingual reasoning dataset containing CoT examples translated into languages such as French, Spanish, and German. The recipe supports a sequence length of 4,000 tokens for the GPT-OSS 120B model. The following example code demonstrates how to tokenize the multilingual-thinking dataset. The recipe accepts data in Hugging Face format (arrow).

SageMaker training jobs are ideal for one-off or periodic training workloads that need temporary compute resources, making it a fully managed, on-demand experience for your training needs. SageMaker HyperPod is optimal for continuous development and experimentation, providing a persistent, preconfigured, and failure-resilient cluster. Depending on your choice, skip to the appropriate section for next steps.</p><h2>Fine-tune the model using SageMaker HyperPod</h2><p>To fine-tune the model using HyperPod, start by setting up the virtual environment and installing the necessary dependencies to execute the training job on the EKS cluster.

You can get the location of the output artifacts from the section on the job details page.</p><p>After you fine-tune your GPT-OSS model with SageMaker recipes on either SageMaker training jobs or SageMaker HyperPod, the output is a customized model artifact that merges the base model with the customized PEFT adapters. This final model is stored in Amazon S3 and can be deployed directly from Amazon S3 to SageMaker endpoints for real-time inference.</p><p>To serve GPT-OSS models, you must have the latest vLLM containers (v0.10.1 or later). A full list of  Docker image versions is available on <a href=\"https://hub.docker.com/r/vllm/vllm-openai/tags\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Docker hub</a>.</p><p>The steps to deploy your fine-tuned GPT-OSS model are outlined in this section.</p><h3>Build the latest GPT-OSS container for your SageMaker endpoint</h3><p>If you‚Äôre deploying the model from SageMaker Studio using JupyterLab or the Code Editor, both environments come with Docker preinstalled. Make sure that you‚Äôre using the SageMaker Distribution image v3.0 or later for compatibility.You can build your deployment container by running the following commands:</p><div><pre><code>%%bash # &lt;- use this if you're running this inside JupterLab cell\n\n# navigate to deploy dir from the current workdir, to build container\ncd ./deploy \n\n# build a push container\nchmod +X build.sh\nbash build.sh\n\ncd ..&nbsp;</code></pre></div><p>If you‚Äôre running these commands from a local terminal or other environment, simply omit the  line and run the commands as standard shell commands.</p><p>The  script is responsible for automatically building and pushing a  container that is optimized for SageMaker endpoints. After it‚Äôs built, the custom SageMaker endpoint compatible  image is pushed to <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/ecr/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Amazon Elastic Container Registry</a> (Amazon ECR). SageMaker endpoints can then pull this image from Amazon ECR at runtime to spin up the container for inference.</p><p>The following is an example of the  script:</p><div><pre><code>export REGION={region}\nexport ACCOUNT_ID={account_id}\nexport REPOSITORY_NAME=vllm\nexport TAG=v0.10.1\n\nfull_name=\"${ACCOUNT_ID}.dkr.ecr.${REGION}.amazonaws.com/${REPOSITORY_NAME}:${TAG}\"\n\necho \"building $full_name\"\n\nDOCKER_BUILDKIT=0 docker build . --network sagemaker --tag $full_name --file Dockerfile\n\naws ecr get-login-password --region $REGION | docker login --username AWS --password-stdin $ACCOUNT_ID.dkr.ecr.$REGION.amazonaws.com\n\n# If the repository doesn't exist in ECR, create it.\naws ecr describe-repositories --region ${REGION} --repository-names \"${REPOSITIRY_NAME}\" &gt; /dev/null 2&gt;&amp;1\n\nif [ $? -ne 0 ]\nthen\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;aws ecr create-repository --region ${REGION} --repository-name \"${REPOSITORY_NAME}\" &gt; /dev/null\nfi\n\ndocker tag $REPOSITORY_NAME:$TAG ${full_name}\ndocker push ${full_name}</code></pre></div><p>The Dockerfile defines how we convert an open source vLLM Docker image into a SageMaker hosting-compatible image. This involves extending the base  image, adding the  entrypoint script, and making it executable. See the following example Dockerfile:</p><div><pre><code>FROM vllm/vllm-openai:v0.10.1\n\nCOPY serve /usr/bin/serve\nRUN chmod 777 /usr/bin/serve\n\nENTRYPOINT [ \"/usr/bin/serve\" ]</code></pre></div><p>The  script acts as a translation layer between SageMaker hosting conventions and the vLLM runtime. You can maintain the same deployment workflow you‚Äôre familiar with when hosting models on SageMaker endpoints, while automatically converting SageMaker-specific configurations into the format expected by vLLM.</p><p>Key points to note about this script:</p><ul><li>It enforces the use of port 8080, which SageMaker requires for inference containers</li><li>It dynamically translates environment variables prefixed with  into CLI arguments for vLLM (for example, <code>OPTION_MAX_MODEL_LEN=4096</code> changes to )</li><li>It prints the final set of arguments for visibility</li><li>It finally launches the vLLM API server with the translated arguments</li></ul><p>The following is an example  script:</p><div><pre><code>#!/bin/bash\n\n# Define the prefix for environment variables to look for\nPREFIX=\"OPTION_\"\nARG_PREFIX=\"--\"\n\n# Initialize an array for storing the arguments\n# port 8080 required by sagemaker, https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/your-algorithms-inference-code.html#your-algorithms-inference-code-container-response\nARGS=(--port 8080)\n\n# Loop through all environment variables\nwhile IFS='=' read -r key value; do\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;# Remove the prefix from the key, convert to lowercase, and replace underscores with dashes\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;arg_name=$(echo \"${key#\"${PREFIX}\"}\" | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]' | tr '_' '-')\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;# Add the argument name and value to the ARGS array\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;ARGS+=(\"${ARG_PREFIX}${arg_name}\")\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;if [ -n \"$value\" ]; then\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;ARGS+=(\"$value\")\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;fi\ndone &lt; &lt;(env | grep \"^${PREFIX}\")\n\necho \"-------------------------------------------------------------------\"\necho \"vLLM engine args: [${ARGS[@]}]\"\necho \"-------------------------------------------------------------------\"\n\n# Pass the collected arguments to the main entrypoint\nexec python3 -m vllm.entrypoints.openai.api_server \"${ARGS[@]}\"</code></pre></div><h3>Host customized GPT-OSS as a SageMaker real-time endpoint</h3><p>Now you can deploy your fine-tuned GPT-OSS model using the ECR image URI you built in the previous step. In this example, the model artifacts are stored securely in an S3 bucket, and SageMaker will download them into the container at runtime.Complete the following configurations:</p><ul><li>Set  to point to the S3 prefix where your model artifacts are located</li><li>Set the  environment variable to , which is where SageMaker mounts the model inside the container</li><li>(Optional) If you‚Äôre serving a model from Hugging Face Hub instead of Amazon S3, you can set  directly to the Hugging Face model ID instead</li></ul><p>The endpoint startup might take several minutes as the model artifacts are downloaded and the container is initialized.The following is an example deployment code:</p><div><pre><code>inference_image = f\"{account_id}.dkr.ecr.{region}.amazonaws.com/vllm:v0.10.1\"\n\n...\n...\n\nlmi_model = sagemaker.Model(\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;image_uri=inference_image,\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;env={\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"OPTION_MODEL\": \"/opt/ml/model\",&nbsp;# set this to let SM endpoint read a model stored in s3, else set it to HF MODEL ID\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"OPTION_SERVED_MODEL_NAME\": \"model\",\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"OPTION_TENSOR_PARALLEL_SIZE\": json.dumps(num_gpus),\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"OPTION_DTYPE\": \"bfloat16\",\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;#\"VLLM_ATTENTION_BACKEND\": \"TRITON_ATTN_VLLM_V1\", # not required for vLLM 0.10.1 and above\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"OPTION_ASYNC_SCHEDULING\": \"true\",\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"OPTION_QUANTIZATION\": \"mxfp4\"\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;},\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;role=role,\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;name=model_name,\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;model_data={\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'S3DataSource': {\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'S3Uri': \"s3://path/to/gpt-oss/model/artifacts\",\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'S3DataType': 'S3Prefix',\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'CompressionType': 'None'\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;}\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;},\n)\n\n...\n\nlmi_model.deploy(\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;initial_instance_count=1,\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;instance_type=instance_type,\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;container_startup_health_check_timeout=600,\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;endpoint_name=endpoint_name,\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;endpoint_type=sagemaker.enums.EndpointType.INFERENCE_COMPONENT_BASED,\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;inference_component_name=inference_component_name,\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;resources=ResourceRequirements(requests={\"num_accelerators\": 1, \"memory\": 1024*3, \"copies\": 1,}),\n)</code></pre></div><p>After your endpoint is deployed and in the  state, you can invoke your fine-tuned GPT-OSS model using the SageMaker Python SDK.</p><p>The following is an example predictor setup:</p><div><pre><code>pretrained_predictor = sagemaker.Predictor(\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;endpoint_name=endpoint_name,\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;sagemaker_session=sagemaker.Session(boto3.Session(region_name=boto3.Session().region_name)),\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;serializer=serializers.JSONSerializer(),\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;deserializer=deserializers.JSONDeserializer(),\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;component_name=inference_component_name\n)</code></pre></div><p>The modified vLLM container is fully compatible with the OpenAI-style  input format, making it straightforward to send chat-style requests:</p><div><pre><code>payload = {\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;\"messages\": [{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"Hello who are you?\"}],\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;\"parameters\": {\"max_new_tokens\": 64, \"temperature\": 0.2}\n}\n\noutput = pretrained_predictor.predict(payload)</code></pre></div><p>You have successfully deployed and invoked your custom fine-tuned GPT-OSS model on SageMaker real-time endpoints, using the vLLM framework for optimized, low-latency inference.

This post aims to guide you through the decision-making process and highlight the unique advantages of Amazon&nbsp;Q&nbsp;Business and how to build an AWS architecture to get started and onboard more use cases.</p><p>Amazon Q Business is an AI-powered assistant that can help employees quickly find information, solve problems, and get work done across their company‚Äôs data and applications. With Amazon Q Business, employees can access information from various internal documents, websites, wikis, and other business resources through natural conversations, helping them to find exactly what they need without extensive searching. It can also be used to automate common workflows across enterprise systems. Amazon Q Business prioritizes security and privacy by operating within your organization‚Äôs existing permissions and access controls, helping to ensure that employees only see information that they‚Äôre authorized to access.</p><p>The first step in selecting the right generative AI solution is to clearly define your use case. Are you looking to enhance a single system, or do you need a solution that spans multiple platforms? Single-system use cases might be well-served by specific generative AI solutions, while cross-system scenarios often benefit from a more unified approach.&nbsp;Organizations that benefit most from Amazon Q Business typically share several key characteristics:</p><ul><li> Companies with large volumes of data spread across multiple repositories and formats (documents, images, audio, video)</li><li> Organizations where employee productivity depends on accessing institutional knowledge quickly and accurately</li><li> Organizations with strict security and compliance needs requiring role-based permissions and access controls</li><li> Teams that need to share information and collaborate across departments and geographies</li><li> Organizations with complex workflows that could benefit from automation and streamlining</li></ul><h2>Key considerations for tool selection</h2><p>When evaluating generative AI tools, there are several factors should you should consider to help ensure successful implementation and adoption:</p><ul><li> Determine if you need custom AI behaviors or if out-of-the-box solutions suffice</li><li> Assess the number of systems involved and the complexity of data flows between them</li><li> Think about your long-term needs and choose a solution that can grow with you</li><li><strong>Data privacy and residency:</strong> Understand your data governance requirements and make sure that your chosen solution can meet them</li><li> Evaluate the total cost of ownership, including implementation, maintenance, and scaling costs</li><li> Consider how quickly you need to implement your generative AI solution</li><li> As with any enterprise AI implementation, organizations must invest in proper training and change management strategies to help ensure adoption</li></ul><h2>The case for Amazon Q Business</h2><p>Amazon Q Business offers unique advantages, especially for organizations that already have AWS services or that have complex, cross-system needs. For AWS enterprise customers that have the resources to build and operate their own solutions, an architecture that includes Amazon Q Business offers flexibility and cost advantages, including:</p><ul><li> Amazon Q Business can provide a consistent AI experience across multiple systems, creating a seamless interface for users.</li><li> As a native AWS service, Amazon Q Business integrates seamlessly with your existing AWS architecture, reducing complexity and potential points of failure.</li><li> Amazon Q Business can connect to various enterprise systems, so that you can use it to create custom workflows that span multiple platforms.</li><li> By using Amazon Q Business, you can take advantage of the proven scalability of AWS to handle growing workloads without worrying about infrastructure management.</li><li> Use the robust security features and compliance certifications of AWS to help reduce your security and compliance burden.</li><li> Amazon Q Business offers a pay-as-you-go model, so you can scale costs with the number of users and usage for knowledge bases. This can lead to significant cost savings (see <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/q/business/pricing/\">pricing details</a>).</li></ul><h2>Implement your generative&nbsp;AI use cases</h2><p>After you‚Äôve chosen your generative AI use cases, consider a phased implementation approach:</p><ol><li><strong>Start with pilot use cases to prove value quickly:</strong> Good pilot use cases include IT help desk or HR workflows. You can get started by taking advantage of AWS-provided example projects and open source samples.</li><li><strong>Evaluate the next use cases:</strong> Prioritize you next use cases by business impact and feature coverage with existing Amazon Q Business connectors and plugins. Often AIOps use cases that include integrations or chat interfaces on top of ServiceNow, Confluence, Teams, or Slack are good examples.</li><li><strong>Use existing data sources:</strong> Connect Amazon Q Business to enterprise systems with supported connectors first to maximize immediate value.</li><li><strong>Implement accuracy testing using frameworks:</strong> Use tools such as the AWS evaluation framework for Amazon Q Business, which includes automated testing pipelines, ground truth datasets, and comprehensive metrics for measuring response quality, relevancy, truthfulness, and overall accuracy.</li><li><strong>Iteratively scale successful implementations across your organization:</strong> Start your implementation with the teams that are most interested in the application and willing to provide feedback. Make changes based on the feedback as needed, then expand it across the organization.</li><li><strong>Measure and track results:</strong> Establish clear KPIs before implementation to quantify business impact.</li></ol><p>Monitor usage and costs, implement feedback loops, and make sure to support security and compliance throughout your generative&nbsp;AI journey. Amazon Q Business can provide significant value when implemented in appropriate use cases with proper planning and governance. Success depends on careful evaluation of business needs, thorough implementation planning, and ongoing management of the solution.</p><p>When implementing your generative AI use cases, architectural decisions play a crucial role in achieving long-term success. Let‚Äôs explore some best practices for a typical AWS enterprise environment.</p><ul><li> Connecting your corporate source of identities to <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/iam/identity-center/\">AWS IAM Identity Center</a> provides better security and user experience, Amazon Q Business users authorize their Amazon Q session with their usual sign-in process, using their existing organizational credentials through the identity source already in place.</li><li> Set up Amazon Q Business service, data sources, and plugins in a shared services account based on application group or business unit to help reduce the number of similar deployments across different AWS accounts.</li><li> When rolling out new use cases, consider also enabling existing familiar enterprise channels such as collaboration tools (Teams or Slack) to provide a frictionless way to test and roll out new use cases.</li><li> When adding data sources, estimate index storage needs and whether your use case requires crawling access control list (ACL) and identity information from the data source and if it is supported by the connector. To reduce initial complexity, focus on use cases that provide the same data to all users, then expand it in a second phase for use cases that rely on ACLs to control access.</li><li> Use plugins to integrate external services as actions. For each use case, verify if a built-in plugin can provide this functionality, or if a custom plugin is needed. For custom plugins, plan an architecture that enables pointing to backend services using OpenAPI endpoints in other AWS accounts across the organization. This allows flexible integration of existing <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/\">AWS Lambda</a> functions or container-based functionality.</li></ul><p>By carefully considering these aspects, you can create a solid foundation for your generative&nbsp;AI implementation that aligns with your organization‚Äôs needs and future growth plans.</p><h2>How to deploy Amazon Q Business in your organization</h2><p>The following reference architecture illustrates the main components and flow of a typical Amazon Q Business implementation:</p><p>The workflow is as follows:</p><ol><li>A user interacts with an assistant through an enterprise collaboration system.</li><li>Alternate: A user interacts with the built-in web interface provided by Amazon Q Business.</li><li>The user is authenticated using IAM Identity Center and federated by a third-party identity provider (IdP).</li><li>Data sources are configured for existing enterprise systems and data is crawled and indexed in Amazon Q Business. You can use custom connectors to integrate data sources that aren‚Äôt provided by Amazon Q Business.</li><li>The user makes a request that requires action through a custom plugin. Use custom plugins to integrate third-party applications.</li></ol><h2>Use Amazon Q Business to improve enterprise productivity</h2><p>Amazon Q Business, offers numerous practical applications across enterprise functions.

It‚Äôs simple and fast, but struggles with nuanced language or evolving user intent. The system can‚Äôt adapt on the fly. It just follows predefined instructions.\nOn the other hand, an agentic workflow introduces flexibility and adaptability. AI agents dynamically interpret user inputs, construct queries intelligently, and adjust their approach based on the context of the interaction and feedback received. This allows them to handle more complex, ambiguous requests while improving reliability and user experience.</p><h2><strong>What Makes Up an AI Agent</strong></h2><p>To build an effective AI agent for product catalog search, the following components are essential:</p><ul><li>Input Handling: Accepts and interprets user requests.</li><li>Feedback Handling and Memory: Incorporates user and system feedback to improve future interactions and maintains memory of past interactions.</li><li>Tools: Interfaces with external tools or databases to execute tasks.</li><li>Reasoning: Analyzes input and feedback to make informed decisions.</li></ul><p>To build such an agent, we need an execution environment. Let‚Äôs explore how Enthusiast can serve as an effective option.</p><p>Most LangChain tutorials stop at toy examples or require heavy customization to support real-world workflows. Enthusiast changes that. It‚Äôs built from the ground up to support:</p><ul><li>Tool-based agents with LangChain and ReAct</li><li>SQL-backed querying with Django or external sources</li><li>Structured memory and retry logic out of the box</li><li>Open-source, customizable behavior</li><li>Self-hosting with cloud/local model support</li></ul><p>Whether you're debugging search in a product catalog or surfacing relevant documents across internal departments, Enthusiast gives you a working foundation in minutes with real production logic, not just playground demos.</p><p>Alright, now let‚Äôs bring that to life. We‚Äôll walk through a real case: spinning up a local environment, loading data, and creating a self-correcting LangChain agent that actually understands and interacts with your product catalog.</p><p><strong>Setting Up the Development Environment</strong></p><p>To get started, you need to set up your development environment by cloning the Enthusiast starter repository and using its Docker configuration.</p><ol><li><p>Clone the repository:<code>git clone https://github.com/upsidelab/enthusiast-starter</code></p></li><li><p>Navigate into the repository directory:</p></li><li><p>Copy default configuration file and add your own OpenAI API key:<code>cp config/env.sample config/env</code><code>echo OPENAI_API_KEY=xxxx &gt;&gt; config/env</code></p></li><li><p>Build and run the Docker containers:</p></li></ol><p>You‚Äôll be prompted to create your first dataset. Give it a name, for example, ‚ÄúMy Dataset‚Äù. </p><p><strong>Import a Sample Product Dataset</strong>\nEnthusiast comes with a sample set of products that can be useful if you want to get started quickly. In this case, we have a set of products that represent different phone and mobile plans - with varying internet speeds, data limits, landline access, cable TV options, and more. They make a great test case for experimenting with different approaches to agentic product recommendations. </p><p>Let‚Äôs import this into our dataset:</p><ol><li>Click on ‚ÄúAdd Source‚Äù in the top-right corner of the screen.</li><li>From the dropdown, select ‚ÄúProduct source‚Äù.</li><li>A popup will appear for configuring the source.</li><li>Select ‚ÄúSample Product Source‚Äù from the list and click ‚ÄúAdd‚Äù.</li><li>You should now see it listed under configured sources.</li><li>Repeat the same process for documents by selecting ‚ÄúDocument source‚Äù from the dropdown.</li><li>This time, choose ‚ÄúSample Document Source‚Äù as the type and add it as well.</li></ol><p>Enthusiast will automatically index the dataset so it‚Äôs searchable right away.</p><p>Once the data is loaded, you can go to the Products tab to verify that the sample data was successfully imported and indexed. This ensures that your dataset is ready for querying by the agent.</p><h2><strong>Create a Custom Agent Structure</strong></h2><p>Now that your product catalog is loaded, it‚Äôs time to build an agent that can operate on it. Enthusiast supports extending and modifying agent behavior through the enthusiast_custom directory in the project.</p><ol><li><p>Inside the enthusiast-starter repository, locate the src/enthusiast_custom directory. This is the package that contains your custom agents and plugins. This code will be bundled by the Dockerfile and automatically installed into your Enthusiast instance.</p></li><li><p>Let‚Äôs also install a plugin that provides a reusable base implementation for a ReAct-style agent. Run the following command inside the src/ directory to add the plugin:<code>poetry add enthusiast-agent-re-act</code></p></li><li><p>Then, create a new directory inside enthusiast_custom, calling it for example product_search. Inside this directory, add an empty .py file to make it a Python package. This is where you‚Äôll define your agent‚Äôs implementation.</p></li><li><p>Add your new agent to the config/settings_override.py file so that Enthusiast can recognize it. Update the AVAILABLE_AGENTS dictionary to include your custom module:</p></li></ol><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><ol><li>You can now rebuild and restart your Docker Compose setup to apply these changes:\n<code>docker compose up --build</code></li></ol><p>Once the application is restarted, you‚Äôll see your new agent listed in the UI on the left. Time to give it some logic.</p><h2><strong>Step 1 ‚Äì Generate an SQL Query</strong></h2><p>We‚Äôll start with a basic implementation that generates an SQL query and executes it on the product catalog indexed in Enthusiast. The agent will reason through user queries and interact with the catalog to retrieve relevant results.</p><p>To do this, we‚Äôll use the enthusiast-agent-re-act plugin that we added earlier. It provides a BaseReActAgent class, which defines the core structure of a ReAct-style agent, including how it connects prompts, tools, memory, and output processing.</p><p>Here‚Äôs how we‚Äôll structure the product_search agent module:</p><p>Start by defining the agent class. In a basic scenario, no overrides are required - agent‚Äôs default implementation will respond to user‚Äôs queries by creating an agent executor configured with tools and memory, and will pass the user‚Äôs request there.\nHere‚Äôs what the simplest implementation looks like:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p><code>product_search/product_search_tool.py</code></p><p>Next, implement a tool the agent can use to run SQL queries against your product catalog.</p><p>Let‚Äôs first declare the expected input schema using a Pydantic model. This schema will be provided to the agent together with the tool definition, to let the agent determine what‚Äôs needed to call this tool. Since we specify that the tool requires an SQL query, the agent will try to produce one based on everything it knows so far in order to invoke it.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>This tool receives an SQL string from the agent, executes it using Django‚Äôs ORM, serializes the resulting product objects, and returns a message with the result. The NAME and DESCRIPTION fields in the tool definition help the agent determine when this tool is relevant to the current task. </p><p>Here‚Äôs a basic version of the tool implementation:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Then, create the system prompt that will guide how the agent reasons and interacts with tools. Add the following:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Finally, wire everything together in the config file. This tells Enthusiast which components make up your agent:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Once these components are in place and the Docker container is rebuilt, try executing a sample query:\nWhat‚Äôs the best plan for a small family?<p>\nThe agent will reason about the input, construct an SQL query, and invoke the search tool, likely failing due to invalid schema or search criteria. Let‚Äôs see what we can do with that.</p></p><h2><strong>Step 2 ‚Äì Let the Agent Handle Its Own Errors</strong></h2><p>In the initial version, if the SQL query generated by the agent was incorrect, the tool would simply fail without giving the agent any indication of what went wrong. We can improve this by modifying the tool to catch SQL errors and return the error message as part of the response.</p><p>This way, the agent can treat the error as feedback and make another attempt, refining the query on its own.</p><p>To do this, update the run method in ProductSearchTool as follows:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>With this change, when the SQL query fails, the agent gets the error message and can use it to revise its approach. Since the agent maintains memory of previous steps, it can iterate on its output to try and produce a valid query.</p><p>Try running the same query again:\nWhat‚Äôs the best plan for a small family?</p><p>If the first attempt fails, the agent will receive the error, analyze it, and try to generate a better query.</p><h2><strong>Step 3 ‚Äì Help the Agent Understand the Data</strong></h2><p>Letting the agent correct its own mistakes is helpful, but trial and error can be inefficient. Instead of waiting for the agent to fail and recover, we can give it a clearer understanding of the data structure up front.</p><p>One simple way to do this is by including a few sample rows from the product catalog directly in the prompt. This helps the agent understand both the schema and the shape of the data, which improves its chances of generating valid queries from the start.</p><p>To add this context, let‚Äôs override the get_answer method in your agent like this:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>This method will use functionality provided by the base class to build a LangChain-based agent executor, pass the input to it, and return the response to the user. One important change here is that besides user‚Äôs input (passed as input_text ), it will also pull a few sample products from the database and will inject them into the agent‚Äôs system prompt as sample_products.</p><p>In your prompt template (prompt.py), add this placeholder at the end:\nHere are some sample products in the database: {sample_products}</p><p>This additional context will be included with every call to the agent. It initializes the agent with a basic understanding of the structure and shape of the data, which makes it easier for the agent to construct accurate queries from the start.\nLet‚Äôs give it a try.</p><p>You should notice that the agent now constructs queries that better match how the data is shaped. For example, it may use the category column to search for plans labeled as ‚ÄúHome,‚Äù or rely on the properties column to filter for plans with specific internet speeds.</p><h2><strong>Step 4 ‚Äì Retry When No Results Are Found</strong></h2><p>Even if the agent is capable of generating valid SQL queries and has seen sample data, there‚Äôs still a chance it will produce a query that technically runs but returns no results.</p><p>In the current implementation, when that happens, the tool simply returns an empty list, and the agent assumes there are no relevant options. But in reality, the issue may be with how the agent built the query, not with a lack of products.</p><p>To address this, we can update the tool to return a clear message when no products are found‚Äîencouraging the agent to try a different approach. Here‚Äôs how the updated run method might look:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>With this change, the agent receives explicit feedback when a query returns no matches. It can then choose to revise the query and try again with broader or alternative criteria.</p><p>This gives the agent an opportunity to step back and reconsider its assumptions, leading to better resilience and more accurate results when dealing with uncertain or ambiguous user requests.</p><h2><strong>Step 5 ‚Äì Respect the Expected Number of Results</strong></h2><p>In some cases, a user might indicate how many products they want to see‚Äîperhaps just one recommendation or the top three matches. Right now, the agent doesn‚Äôt take that into account. It may return a long list of results, even if the user only wanted a few.</p><p>We can improve this by passing the expected number of results as part of the tool input. The tool will then check whether the number of matches exceeds this limit. If it does, it will prompt the agent to follow up and narrow the criteria.</p><p>First, update the input schema to include this new parameter:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>This addition helps turn the agent into a more effective product search assistant. Instead of assuming that the initial results are appropriate, the agent now reflects on the quantity of data returned, checks it against user expectations, and adjusts accordingly. This creates a more collaborative flow where the agent and user refine the query together to land on a relevant result.</p><h2><strong>Step 6 ‚Äì Enable the Agent to Finalize a Purchase</strong></h2><p>Once the user finds a plan that matches their needs, the next logical step is to help them act on it. Right now, our agent can recommend products but doesn‚Äôt support any kind of checkout process.</p><p>To make this possible, we‚Äôll give the agent the ability to generate a contract URL the user can follow to finalize their purchase. This effectively allows the agent to transition from discovery to action.</p><p>Start by creating a new tool, PurchaseTool, which accepts a plan_sku and returns a contract finalization link:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Lastly, modify the search tool‚Äôs return message slightly to encourage the agent to propose a contract. The agent will likely figure it out even without this hint, but there‚Äôs no harm in pushing it more explicitly:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>With this addition, your agent becomes a guided assistant that helps the user discover a suitable plan and smoothly transition into completing the purchase.</p><h2><strong>Step 7 ‚Äì Ask for Additional Customer Details</strong></h2><p>Before the agent pushes the user to sign a contract, it can also ensure that it collects any additional information needed to complete the process‚Äîsuch as the customer‚Äôs name and location.\nTo support this, update the PurchaseToolInput schema with two new fields:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Thanks to the structured schema and tool description, the agent will know that it must collect these inputs from the user before invoking the tool. If the information isn‚Äôt provided initially, the agent can follow up with questions like:</p><p>Could you tell me your name and zip code so I can finalize the contract?</p><p>This closes the loop and ensures that the agent not only helps discover the right plan but can also guide the user through to a complete and personalized purchase process.</p><p>In this walkthrough, we explored how to build a practical AI agent for product catalog search using Enthusiast. Starting from a basic ReAct-style agent capable of generating SQL queries, we incrementally introduced more sophisticated behaviors:</p><ul><li>Error recovery through exception feedback</li><li>Schema-aware reasoning via sample data</li><li>Retry logic when no results are found</li><li>Adapting results to match user expectations</li><li>Finalizing user purchases with structured follow-up</li><li>Collecting required customer details before contract generation</li></ul><p>Each step was designed to bring the agent closer to an experience that feels like a helpful, iterative assistant.</p>","contentLength":15576,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Speed up delivery of ML workloads using Code Editor in Amazon SageMaker Unified Studio","url":"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/speed-up-delivery-of-ml-workloads-using-code-editor-in-amazon-sagemaker-unified-studio/","date":1755807875,"author":"Paul Hargis","guid":235895,"unread":true,"content":"<p><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/unified-studio/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Amazon SageMaker Unified Studio</a> is a single integrated development environment (IDE) that brings together your data tools for analytics and AI. As part of the next generation of <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Amazon SageMaker</a>, it contains integrated tooling for building data pipelines, sharing datasets, monitoring data governance, running SQL analytics, building artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML) models, and creating generative AI applications. Recently, AWS announced two additional options that enhance the development experience for analytics, ML, and generative AI teams: <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2025/05/code-editor-vs-code-open-source-sagemaker-unified-studio/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Code Editor and multiple spaces</a>. These new IDE options can help developers and data scientists speed up delivery of ML workloads by offering familiar IDE layouts, using popular extensions to enhance development, and using critical debug and test options, all within a unified environment.</p><p>Code Editor, based on Code-OSS (Visual Studio Code ‚Äì Open Source), provides a lightweight and powerful IDE with familiar shortcuts and terminal access, along with advanced debugging capabilities and refactoring tools. The VSCode IDE, and Code-OSS variants like Code Editor, remain the most <a href=\"https://visualstudiomagazine.com/articles/2023/06/28/so-2023.aspx\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">popular</a> development tool in recent years. Teams can boost their productivity by accessing thousands of Code Editor-compatible extensions from the <a href=\"https://open-vsx.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Open VSX extension</a> gallery. The Code Editor IDE within SageMaker Unified Studio supports version control and cross-team collaboration through GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket repositories, while offering preconfigured SageMaker distribution for popular ML frameworks.</p><p>Within SageMaker Unified Studio, a  is a work environment that runs a particular IDE. To maximize the benefits of Code Editor alongside other coding interfaces in SageMaker Unified Studio, including JupyterLab, SageMaker now supports multiple spaces per user per project. With multiple spaces, users can manage parallel workstreams with different computational needs. Each space maintains a 1-to-1 relationship with an application instance, so users can efficiently organize their storage and resource requirements. This enhancement provides the flexibility to access multiple applications and instances simultaneously, improving workflow management and productivity.</p><p>In this post, we walk through how you can use the new Code Editor and multiple spaces support in SageMaker Unified Studio. The sample solution shows how to develop an ML pipeline that automates the typical end-to-end ML activities to build, train, evaluate, and (optionally) deploy an ML model.</p><h2>Features of Code Editor in SageMaker Unified Studio</h2><p>Code Editor offers a unique set of features to increase the productivity of your ML team:</p><ul><li><strong>Fully managed infrastructure</strong> ‚Äì The Code Editor IDE runs on fully managed infrastructure. SageMaker takes care of keeping the instances up-to-date with the latest security patches and upgrades.</li><li><strong>Dial resources up and down</strong> ‚Äì With Code Editor, you can seamlessly change the underlying resources (such as instance type or EBS volume size) on which Code Editor is running. This is beneficial for developers who want to run workloads with changing compute, memory, and storage needs.</li><li><strong>SageMaker provided images</strong> ‚Äì Code Editor is preconfigured with <a href=\"https://github.com/aws/sagemaker-distribution\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Amazon SageMaker Distribution</a> as the default image. This container image has the most popular ML frameworks supported by SageMaker, along with the <a href=\"https://pypi.org/project/sagemaker-studio/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">SageMaker Studio SDK</a>, <a href=\"https://sagemaker.readthedocs.io/en/stable/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">SageMaker Python SDK</a>, <a href=\"https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/index.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Boto3</a>, and other AWS and data science specific libraries installed. This significantly reduces the time you spend setting up your environment and decreases the complexity of managing package dependencies in your ML project.</li><li> ‚Äì Code Editor also comes with generative AI capabilities powered by <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/q/developer/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Amazon Q Developer</a>. You can boost your productivity by generating inline code suggestions within the IDE. In addition, you can use Amazon Q chat to ask questions about building at AWS and for assistance with software development. Amazon Q can explain coding concepts and code snippets, generate code and unit tests, and improve code, including debugging or refactoring.</li><li><strong>Extensions and configuration settings </strong>‚Äì Code Editor also includes persistence of installed extensions and configuration settings.</li></ul><p>When you open Code Editor, you will notice that the space has been bootstrapped with the current state of your project‚Äôs repository. Navigate to the file explorer, and you will find a  Jupyter notebook, as shown in the following screenshot.</p><p>You can choose  to execute this notebook. Select  when prompted to select the kernel and then choose the recommended Python environment named . Now the  notebook will be executed, and you can explore the output of the various cells.</p><h2>Architecture of Code Editor in SageMaker Unified Studio</h2><p>When you open Code Editor in SageMaker Unified Studio, it creates an application container that runs on an <a href=\"http://aws.amazon.com/ec2\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud</a> (Amazon EC2) instance. This instance type matches your selection during Code Editor space configuration. The underlying infrastructure management happens automatically in a service-managed account controlled by SageMaker Unified Studio. The following diagram shows the infrastructure as it relates to end-users and how instances are provisioned. User A has configured two spaces, and User B is using a single space. Both users have the option to create additional spaces as needed. Currently, these spaces are isolated private environments, with shared space functionality planned for a future release.</p><p>SageMaker Unified Studio lets you create multiple spaces with Code Editor or JupyterLab as the IDE, each configurable with different ML instance types, including those with accelerated computing capabilities. For each space, you must specify three core elements: the EBS volume size, your chosen instance type, and the application type you want to run (such as Code Editor or JupyterLab). When you initiate a space, SageMaker Unified Studio automatically provisions a compute instance and launches a SageMaker Unified Studio Code Editor application using your specified container image. The storage system is designed for continuity: your EBS volume persists across sessions, even when you stop and restart the IDE. This means that when you stop the Code Editor application to save on computing costs, although the compute resources shut down, your EBS volume is preserved. Upon restart, the system automatically reattaches this volume, so your work remains intact.</p><p>In the following sections, we show how to develop an ML project with Code Editor on SageMaker Unified Studio. For this example, we run through a Jupyter notebook that creates an ML pipeline using <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/pipelines/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Amazon SageMaker Pipelines</a>, which automates the usual tasks of building, training, and (optionally) deploying a model.</p><p>In this scenario, Code Editor can be used by an ML engineering team who needs advanced IDE features to test and debug their code, create and execute a pipeline, and monitor the status in SageMaker Unified Studio.</p><p>To prepare your organization to use the new Code Editor IDE and multiple spaces support in SageMaker Unified Studio, complete the following prerequisite steps:</p><p>By default, authentication and authorization for a SageMaker Unified Studio domain is controlled through IAM Identity Center, which can only be configured in a single AWS Region that must be the same Region as your SageMaker domain. See <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker-unified-studio/latest/adminguide/setting-up.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Setting up Amazon SageMaker Unified Studio</a> for additional information.</p><ol start=\"3\"><li>Create a SageMaker Unified Studio domain using the <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker-unified-studio/latest/adminguide/create-domain-sagemaker-unified-studio-quick.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">quick setup</a>. A virtual private cloud (VPC) is required; one will be created for you (if needed) during setup.</li><li>After you create the domain, you can enable access to SageMaker Unified Studio for users with single sign-on (SSO) credentials through IAM Identity Center by choosing  next to <strong>Configure SSO user access </strong>in the <strong>Next steps for your domain </strong>section.</li></ol><ol start=\"5\"><li>After you configure user access for your newly created domain, navigate to the SageMaker Unified Studio URL and log in using SSO.</li></ol><p>You can find the URL on the SageMaker console, as shown in the following screenshot.</p><p>By default, IAM Identity Center requires multi-factor authentication on user accounts, and you might be prompted to configure this upon first login to SageMaker Unified Studio, as shown in the following screenshot. For more details about this requirement, refer to <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/singlesignon/latest/userguide/user-device-registration.html?icmpid=docs_sso_user_portal\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Registering your device for MFA</a>.</p><ol start=\"6\"><li>After you log in, choose  and follow the prompts to create your first SageMaker Unified Studio project. We choose the  project profile during setup.</li></ol><p>After you create a project, you can create your space (an IDE) in which Code Editor will be provisioned.</p><ol start=\"7\"><li>On the  tab of the project, choose , then enter a name and choose .</li></ol><ol start=\"8\"><li>When the  column indicates the space is , open the space to be redirected to Code Editor.</li></ol><h2>Interacting with AWS services directly from your IDE</h2><p>The AWS Toolkit for Visual Studio Code uses the permissions of the <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/iam/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">AWS Identity and Access Management</a> (IAM) role assigned to the project. You can find the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the project role on the project details page, as shown in the following screenshot.</p><h2>Use Code Editor to create and execute an ML pipeline in SageMaker</h2><p>In this section, we upload and execute a Jupyter notebook that creates and starts a machine learning operations (MLOps) pipeline orchestrated with SageMaker Pipelines. The pipeline we create follows a typical ML application pattern of data preprocessing, training, evaluation, model creation, transformation, and model registration, as illustrated in the following diagram.</p><p>Begin by uploading the sample notebook directly into Code Editor. You can drag and drop the notebook, or right-click and choose in the file explorer pane.</p><p>You can download and run sample notebooks using standard  commands from the GitHub repository where these notebooks are located. Running the Full Pipeline notebook sample requires a few extra IAM role permissions other than the defaults assigned when the SageMaker Unified Studio project is created. The Quick Pipeline can be run as-is with the default IAM permissions.</p><h2>Region availability, cost, and limitations</h2><p>Code Editor and multiple spaces support are available in supported SageMaker Unified Studio domains. For more information about Regions where these features are available, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker-unified-studio/latest/adminguide/supported-regions.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Regions where Amazon SageMaker Unified Studio is supported</a>. Code Editor will be provisioned within a SageMaker space and run on a user-selectable instance type, anywhere from ultra low-cost instances (ml.t3.medium) up to highly performant GPU-based instances (G6 instance family).</p><p>The primary cost associated with running a Code Editor space is tied directly to the underlying compute instance type. The hourly costs for ML instance types can found on the <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker-ai/pricing/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Amazon SageMaker AI pricing page</a> on the  tab. To prevent unnecessary charges, the space will be automatically shut down after a configurable timeout when the space is idle (see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/APIReference/API_SpaceIdleSettings.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">SpaceIdleSettings</a>). There will also be minimal charges tied to storage for the EBS volume that is attached to the Code Editor space.</p><p>At launch, Code Editor spaces can be configured to use a particular SageMaker Distribution image, either version 2.6 or 3.1. Additional major and minor releases of the SageMaker Distribution will be added over time.</p><p>To avoid incurring additional charges, delete the resources created from following this post. This includes any development environments created, such as Code Editor or JupyterLab spaces, which you can delete by navigating to the  navigation pane, choosing the  tab, choosing the options menu (three vertical dots) aligned with the space, and choosing . You can remove project resources by <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker-unified-studio/latest/userguide/delete-project.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">deleting the project</a>, which can be done from the SageMaker Unified Studio console. There is no charge for a SageMaker Unified Studio domain, but you can optionally delete this from the SageMaker AI console. If you created IAM Identity Center users that you no longer need, delete the users from the IAM Identity Center console.</p><p>The addition of the new Code Editor IDE to SageMaker Unified Studio provides a familiar working environment to thousands of data scientists and developers. With this powerful IDE, data scientists can more quickly build, train, tune, and deploy their ML models and push them into production where they can get measurable ROI. With thousands of pre-tested extensions through the VSX Registry, developers will have improved usability and productivity as they build and deploy their generative AI applications.</p><p>In addition, SageMaker Unified Studio now supports multiple spaces per user per project. These new environment options can help MLOps personas segregate workloads, isolate compute resources, and increase productivity through parallelized workstreams. Together, these enhancements help data science teams work more efficiently in bringing ML and generative AI solutions into production, where they can begin to reap the benefits of their work.</p><p>To get started using SageMaker Unified Studio, refer to the <a href=\"https://catalog.us-east-1.prod.workshops.aws/workshops/06dbe60c-3a94-463e-8ac2-18c7f85788d4/en-US\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Amazon SageMaker Workshop</a>.

I hope it is readable enough.]</p><p>CRYSTALS (\"Cryptographic Suite for Algebraic Lattices\") is post-quantum public key encryption scheme, meaning it is expected to be secure even at the era of quantum computing where many current PKE-variants fail.</p><p>CRYSTALS consists of two cryptographic primitives: Kyber and Dilithium. Kyber is key exchange method, i.e. asymmetric encryption providing secure channel to change secrets, and Dilithium is a cryptographic signing method. We will explore the mathematics behind these algorithms by coding them in Python as we go. You can find the code from my <a href=\"https://github.com/CodeFromTheDeepEnd/CRYSTALS-Learning-Resources\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">GitHub repo</a>.</p><p>The reader is assumed certain maturity in mathematics and basic understanding of Python. We don't prove anything, instead the focus is to introduce and build needed machinery that we will use later. \nThe mathematical part of this presentation follows closely the way Alfred Menezes presents it in his excellent <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h5pfTIE6slU&amp;ab_channel=Cryptography101\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">video series</a> on the topic.</p><p>When we say two integers \n\n\n and \n\n are congruent modulo \n\n we mean \n\n is a integer multiple of \n\n  In this case we write </p>\nWith \n\n we mean \n\n is the remainder of integer \n\n divided \n\n This implies \n<p>\n is the ring of integers modulo \n\n  In this ring addition and multiplication are performed modulo \n</p><p>We implement integers in \n\n in class Zq. Notice the Python modulo-operation % is implemented in a way that is fully compatible with our needs because it can handle negative values correctly. The instantiation can be done with integer value or with an instance of Zq.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>The class Zq has addition, subtraction, multiplication, str and repr operations implemented. This makes our life a lot easier because we can make arithmetics directly and debug when needed.</p><p>To get a feeling how things work, consider the ring \n\n For example we have \n</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Let \n\n be a prime.

The quotient ring (often called just \"polynomial ring\") \n\n consists of polynomials in \n\n of degree less than \n\n In ring \n\n the multiplication of polynomials is performed modulo the polynomial \n\n called the reduction polynomial. This means that the product of polynomials \n\n is defined as the remainder \n\n of their product when divided by \n\n in the polynomial ring. Notice that by definition now degree of \n\n is at most \n\n and \n</p><p>One should notice here that remainder is not calculated by the traditional polynomial division algorithm, but with division rules that apply in the polynomial ring. For our purposes it suffices to acknowledge that if the polynomial has degrees \n\n you can apply the rules \n</p>\n and in general for \n\n and then simplify the resulting polynomial normally. To understand why, please visit ring theory and ideals.\n\n<p>Overloading addition and subtraction is straightforward, but multiplication needs special treatment. Here we utilize the fact that Zq has multiplication operation overloaded. In real-life implementations this naive implementation is too slow and NTT-algorithm is used instead.

Consider the polynomial \n</p><p>The obvious way to write that as a vector is \n\n (convention is to use column vectors). The polynomial addition is now component-wise addition modulo \n\n and subtraction is component-wise subtraction modulo \n\n Multiplication is polynomial multiplication as shown earlier and the resulting polynomial is stored in a vector. </p><p>We used this implicitly earlier when defining ZqPolynomial.</p><p>We extend this notation. Let \n\n be a positive integer. Module \n\n consists of length \n\n vectors of polynomials of \n\n. Addition and subtraction is again component-wise. It follows that the resulting vectors in both cases is in \n</p><p>We will later use \n\n to represent \n\n-matrices with polynomial entries. This extension is similar to that from vectors to matrices in linear algebra.</p><p>The module \n\n includes \n\n-matrices with elements from the polynomial ring. The easiest way to handle these is to define class PolyMatrix that holds ZqPolynomials in a list of lists.</p><p>The multiplication in \n\n is defined as inner product of two vectors in \n\n This means that the polynomials, that are elements of the vector in \n\n are multiplied in \n\n and added together. The result is in \n</p>\nand \n\n We get directly \n\n and in Python as follows.<div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Using the \n\n and \n\n defined earlier, we get </p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>To enable matrix multiplication, we implemented the matmul operator.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>We can use the bracket-notation with PolyMatrix because we defined getitem and setitem methods. </p><p>Next we need notion of size that will become useful later.

The <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/model-parameters-titan-embed-text.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Amazon Titan Text Embeddings</a> model is optimized for text retrieval to enable Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG). Instead of processing massive documents at the same time, we used chunking strategies to improve retrieval. We used a chunk size of 1,000 with an overlapping window of 150‚Äì200 for best results. Chunking combined with page boundaries is a simple yet highly effective approach. Sentence window retrieval also returns accurate results.</p><p>Prompting techniques play a crucial role in obtaining effective results. For example, instead of ‚Äúguidelines for smart meter installation,‚Äù an expanded prompt such as ‚Äúinstructions, procedures, regulations, and best practices along with agent experiences for installation of a smart meter‚Äù yields better results.</p><p>This architecture implements comprehensive security measures across the components. We use <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/secrets-manager/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">AWS Secrets Manager</a> to securely store and manage sensitive credentials, API keys, and database passwords, with automatic rotation policies in place. S3 buckets are encrypted using <a href=\"http://aws.amazon.com/kms\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">AWS Key Management Service</a> (AWS KMS) with AES-256 encryption, and versioning is enabled for audit purposes. Personally identifiable information (PII) is handled with extreme care‚Äî PII data is encrypted and access is strictly controlled through <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/iam/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">AWS Identity and Access Management</a> (IAM) policies and AWS KMS. For OpenSearch Serverless implementation, we make sure data is encrypted both at rest using AWS KMS and in transit using TLS 1.2. Session management includes timeout for inactive sessions, requiring re-authentication for continued access. The system interacts with access control list (ACL) data stored in DynamoDB through a secure middleware layer, where the DynamoDB table is encrypted at rest using AWS managed KMS keys. Data transmissions between services are encrypted in transit using TLS 1.2, and we maintain end-to-end encryption across our entire infrastructure. Access controls are granularly defined and regularly audited through <a href=\"http://aws.amazon.com/cloudtrail\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">AWS CloudTrail</a>.</p><h2><strong>Implementing role-based access control</strong></h2><p>We used three different personas to implement role-based access control: an administrator with full access, a technical desk analyst with a medium level of access, and a technical agent with minimal access. We used OpenSearch Serverless collections to manage different access levels. Different call transcripts are ingested into different collections; this is to enable user access to the content they are authorized to based on their roles. A list of user IDs and their roles and allowed access are stored in a DynamoDB table along with the OpenSearch collection and index name.</p><p>We used the  method in a <a href=\"https://streamlit.io/generative-ai\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Streamlit</a> authenticator to retrieve the user ID.</p><h2>User interface and agent experience</h2><p>We used Streamlit as a frontend framework to build the TECHNICAL HELP DESK, with access to the content controlled by the user‚Äôs role. The UI features an FAQ section displayed at the top of the main page and a search metrics insights section in the sidebar, as shown in the following screenshot.</p><p>The UI includes the following components:</p><ul><li> ‚Äì The conversation section contains interactions between the user and the help desk assistant. Users can provide feedback by choosing either the like or dislike button for each response received, as shown in the following screenshot. This feedback is persisted in a DynamoDB table.</li></ul><ul><li>‚Äì As shown in the following screenshot, the sidebar contains metrics information, including: \n  <ul><li>Number of queries in the last week</li><li>Number of total transcripts</li><li>Number of transcripts added in the last week</li><li>Number of helpful responses generated</li><li>Number of misses (no answer found)</li></ul></li></ul><p>These fields are updated asynchronously after each user query. Additional metrics are also stored, such as sentiment, tone of the speakers, nature of responses generated, and satisfaction percentage.</p><ul><li>‚Äì The queries are stored in a DynamoDB table along with a query count column. When the help desk agent signs in, the queries with the most counts are displayed in this section, as shown in the following table.</li></ul><table border=\"1px\" cellpadding=\"10px\"><tbody><tr></tr><tr></tr><tr></tr></tbody></table><p>The  column is created as the global secondary index to retrieve the top five FAQs.</p><p>After the user submits a query, the technical help desk fetches the top similar items from the knowledge base. This is compared with the user‚Äôs query and, when a match is found, the  column is incremented.</p><p>We used the  function in Streamlit to store the valid results in memory. The results are persisted across the user sessions.</p><p>The caching function employs an internal hashing mechanism that can be overridden if required. The cached data can be stored either in memory or on disk. Additionally, we can set the data persistence duration as needed for the use case. Cache invalidation or updates can be done when the data changes or after every hour. This, along with the FAQ section, has significantly enhanced performance of the technical help desk, creating faster response times and improving the user experience for customers and support agents.</p><p>In this post, we showed you how we built a generative AI application to significantly reduce call handling times, automate repetitive tasks, and improve the overall quality of technical support.</p><p>The enterprise AI assistant from the <a href=\"https://www.infosys.com/services/data-ai-topaz/offerings/agentic-foundry.htmly\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Infosys Agentic Foundry</a>, part of Infosys Topaz, now handles 70% of the previously human-managed calls.

Each simulation request to the compute server took a whole minute (~60 seconds) to complete, which incidentally exasperated the resource limits of the deployment.</p><p>In this article, we'll discuss the steps that I took to make the application virtually infinitely scalable (i.e., no server compute bottleneck) thanks to sub-second client-side execution. <em>That's faster than a page load!</em> üî•</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Simulating Course Match with CourseCast\n</h2><p>On simulation day, the Course Match algorithm determines the  for all offered courses based on their supply and demand. Upon completion, Course Match will have been able to assign schedules to each student (in a single round!) such that the course utilities and obtained credits are maximized given the student's respective budget constraints.</p><blockquote><p>üí° You can think of Course Match as an autonomous shopper that \"buys\" courses on behalf of the student. The purchasing power is only limited by the student's token budget, their maximum workload/credits, and their assigned utilities. The higher the token budget, the greater the student's capability to \"afford\" the clearing price for a course.</p></blockquote><p>Since it's impossible to know ahead of time what the actual clearing prices will be, CourseCast instead forecasts the clearing prices based on the most recent historical data of actual clearing prices in previous Course Match runs. These predicted prices (and their statistical variances) are the \"weights\" of the model trained on the latest course and instructor trends.</p><p>To account for forecast uncertainty, the CourseCast model assumes that the predicted clearing price is a normally distributed random variable. As such, CourseCast runs 100 Monte Carlo simulations and counts the frequency of particular courses and schedule configurations being selected. These simulation results are presented to the user as a probability.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  So where was the bottleneck?\n</h2><p>The original CourseCast 2024 was prototyped and deployed as a <a href=\"https://streamlit.io/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Streamlit</a> application written in Python. Students would input their course utilities and submit their simulation request to the Streamlit Community Cloud where:</p><ul><li>The Python back end on <em>shared virtual compute resources</em> would parse course data and load model weights from a hosted Excel spreadsheet.</li><li>The service would recompute all of the scheduling conflicts between courses (~200 in total). Example: classes with overlapping schedules, classes with overlapping sections, and other logistical constraints.</li><li>Run 100 Monte Carlo simulations . Each of which is an instance of a linear programming solver.</li></ul><p>As CourseCast went viral among thousands of UPenn students, the scalability cracks began to show. When too many concurrent users hammered the Streamlit application, students couldn't run their simulations.</p><p>To be fair, the application was on the Streamlit free tier, but it was definitely high time for a rewrite to something more production-grade.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  So how did we scale CourseCast 2025?\n</h2><p>Now that we know where the bottlenecks are, let's tackle them one by one.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Scrapping the Python Server\n</h3><p>My first instinct was to ask: <em>is Python necessary at all?</em> The Monte Carlo simulation was essentially a glorified  loop over a linear programming solver. Nothing about the core simulation logic was specific to Python. In fact, the only Python-specific implementation detail was the usage of Excel spreadsheet parser libraries and linear programming solver libraries for Python. I figured...</p><ul><li>If there was a way to package and compress the Excel spreadsheet in a web-friendly format, then there's nothing stopping us from loading the entire dataset in the browser! Sure enough, the <a href=\"https://parquet.apache.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Parquet</a> file format was specifically designed for efficient portability.</li><li>If there was an equivalent linear programming solver library in JavaScript, then there's nothing stopping us from running simulations in the browser! Sure enough, there was the <a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/yalps\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"></a> library (among many other options).</li></ul><p>At this point, I was fully convinced that we could scrap the Python server and compute the simulation entirely in the browser. This approach effectively allows us to infinitely scale our simulation capacity as we would no longer be constrained by shared cloud compute limits.</p><p>That solves our scalability problem! ‚úÖ</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Precomputing Static Course Conflicts\n</h3><p>The next bottleneck was the course conflict generation logic. Recall that  simulation request recomputes the logistical constraints on course selections (e.g., disallowing classes with overlapping schedules). This is fairly non-trivial work as there are hundreds of classes to consider.</p><p>So, naturally, the solution is to precompute these conflicts ahead of time. The precompute script takes the raw course data and appends the \"conflict groups\" of each course. These \"conflict groups\" ultimately determine the statically known logistical constraints of the linear programming solver.</p><blockquote><p>üìù In computer science parlance, you can think of these \"conflict groups\" as equivalence classes defined by the relation of overlapping course schedules. That is to say, for all pairs of courses within an equivalence class, their schedules must have a non-empty schedule intersection. Thus, a \"conflict group\" is just a label for a group of pairwise-intersecting courses.</p></blockquote><p>All of the course metadata, seeded random values, and conflict groups are embedded in a single compressed  file (~90 KiB) and served to the user via a CDN for efficient delivery and caching. There is also the option of caching the file in a <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Service_Worker_API\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Service Worker</a>, but the edge CDN already works well enough.</p><p>That solves our repeated work problem! ‚úÖ</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Offloading CPU-Bound Work to a Separate Thread\n</h3><p>The next bottleneck is the sequential execution of Monte Carlo simulation runs. There's actually no reason for us to run them sequentially because each sampled price prediction is independent from the 99 other trials. The simulation can thus be parallelized at the trial level.</p><p>Since each simulation run is primarily a linear programming solver, we know that the work is CPU-bound, not I/O-bound. The - model will  work here because <a href=\"https://dev.to/somedood/javascript-concurrency-avoiding-the-sequential-trap-7f0\">CPU-bound work blocks the event loop</a>. We  offload the work to another thread to keep the UI responsive.</p><p>In the browser, we only have one way to spawn multiple threads: through the <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Workers_API\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Web Worker API</a>.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>We can then wrap the worker message-passing logic in a  interface and leverage libraries like <a href=\"https://tanstack.com/query/latest\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">TanStack Query</a> for clean pending states in the UI. The example below uses React for demonstration, but this pattern is framework-agnostic.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>That solves our responsive UI problem! ‚úÖ</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Parallelizing with Worker Thread Pools\n</h3><p>A more advanced implementation of this one-shot request-response worker architecture leverages thread pools to send work to already initialized workers (as opposed to re-initializing them for each work request).</p><p>We can use <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Navigator/hardwareConcurrency\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><code>navigator.hardwareConcurrency</code></a> to determine the optimal number of worker threads to spawn in the pool. Spawning more workers than the maximum hardware concurrency is pointless because the hardware would not have enough cores to service that parallelism anyway.</p><blockquote><p>‚ö†Ô∏è In the previous section, the  was initialized by the  function. In a worker pool, this should instead be provided as an argument to the  function because  is no longer the \"owner\" of the thread resource and thus has no say in the worker lifetime. Worker termination  be the responsibility of the thread pool, not the sendWork function.</p></blockquote><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><blockquote><p>üìù Request cancellation is not implemented here for the sake of brevity, but it is fairly trivial to forward the <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/AbortSignal\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"></a> from TanStack Query into the thread pool. It's only a matter of terminating the workers upon receiving the  event.</p></blockquote><p>The thread pool optimization allowed us to run 100 simulations in parallel batches across all of the device's cores. Together with the precomputed conflict groups, the Monte Carlo simulation was effectively reduced from a minute to sub-second territory! üî•</p><p>That solves our performance problems! ‚úÖ</p><p>After all of these optimizations, I upgraded CourseCast from a prototype that struggled with a hundred concurrent users (with ~60 seconds per simulation request) to an infinitely scalable simulator with sub-second execution speeds (faster than a page load!).</p><p>CourseCast now guides 1000+ UPenn students to make informed decisions and (blazingly!) fast experiments about their course schedules. And we're just getting started! üöÄ</p><p>Throughout this work, I had a few key takeaways:</p><ul><li>Always leave the door open for the possibility of offloading compute to the browser. Modern Web APIs are highly capable with great browser support nowadays. Keep exploring ways to save ourselves from the infrastructure burden of bespoke Python services.</li><li>Always find opportunities to precompute static data. May it be through a precompute script like in CourseCast or a materialized view in the database, strive to do the least amount of repeated work.</li><li>Keep a sharp eye out for parallelizable work. There are many opportunities in data science and general scientific computing where data processing need not be sequential (e.g., dot products, seeded simulation runs, independent events, etc.).</li></ul><p>On a more human perspective, it's always a pleasure to have the code that I write be in service of others‚Äîespecially students! As software engineers, it's easy to forget about the human users at the other end of the screen. To be reminded of the positive impact of our code on others never fails to make our work all the more worth it.</p><blockquote><p><em>\"Have been hearing tons of amazing feedback.

Imagine a massive User table stuffed with profile details, login history, and billing information. Queries slow down as the database scans irrelevant columns for every request. Sound familiar? Let‚Äôs explore vertical partitioning‚Äîa powerful technique to streamline your database‚Äîand touch on caching for even faster data retrieval.</p><p><strong>What Is Vertical Partitioning?</strong></p><p>Vertical partitioning splits a wide table into smaller, focused tables based on usage patterns. Instead of one bloated User table, you create separate tables for specific data groups. This reduces the number of columns scanned during queries, boosting performance and minimizing disk I/O.\nFor example, suppose your User table stores:</p><p>Profile details: name, email, profile picture\nLogin history: last login timestamp, IP addresses<p>\nBilling information: billing address, payment details</p></p><p>As the table grows, even a simple query like fetching a user‚Äôs name forces the database to wade through all columns. Vertical partitioning solves this by splitting the table into:</p><div><pre><code>-- User_Profile table\nCREATE TABLE User_Profile (\n    user_id INT PRIMARY KEY,\n    name VARCHAR(100),\n    email VARCHAR(100),\n    profile_picture VARCHAR(255)\n);\n\n-- User_Login table\nCREATE TABLE User_Login (\n    user_id INT PRIMARY KEY,\n    last_login DATETIME,\n    ip_address VARCHAR(45)\n);\n\n-- User_Billing table\nCREATE TABLE User_Billing (\n    user_id INT PRIMARY KEY,\n    billing_address TEXT,\n    payment_details VARCHAR(255)\n)\n</code></pre></div><p>Each table now holds only the columns relevant to specific queries, making data retrieval faster and more efficient.</p><p>Flowchart: Visualizing Vertical Partitioning\nHere's an ASCII art representation of the vertical partitioning process for illustration:</p><p>+-------------------------+\n|      User Table         |<p>\n| - name                  |</p>\n| - email                 |<p>\n| - profile_picture       |</p>\n| - last_login            |<p>\n| - ip_address            |</p>\n| - billing_address       |<p>\n| - payment_details       |</p>\n+-------------------------+\n           | Split (Vertical Partitioning)\n    +-------------+   +-------------+   +-------------+<p>\n    |User_Profile |   | User_Login  |   |User_Billing |</p>\n    | - user_id   |   | - user_id  |   | - user_id  |<p>\n    | - name     |   | - last_login|   | - billing_ |</p>\n    | - email    |   | - ip_address|   |   address  |<p>\n    | - profile_ |   |             |   | - payment_ |</p>\n    |   picture  |   |             |   |   details  |<p>\n    +-------------+   +-------------+   +-------------+</p>\n           |\n+-------------------------+<p>\n|    Faster Queries       |</p>\n| (Reduced Disk I/O)      |<p>\n+-------------------------+</p></p><p>This visual shows how splitting the table streamlines data access.</p><p><strong>Taking It Further with Caching</strong></p><p>Vertical partitioning optimizes disk-based queries, but disk access is still slower than memory. Enter caching: storing frequently accessed data (e.g., user profiles) in memory using tools like Redis or Memcached. This delivers lightning-fast access for common queries, complementing the efficiency of partitioned tables.</p><ul><li><p>By combining vertical partitioning and caching, you can:</p></li><li><p>Improve query performance: Scan fewer columns and retrieve data faster.</p></li><li><p>Reduce resource usage: Lower disk I/O and server load.</p></li><li><p>Scale efficiently: Handle growing data without sacrificing speed.</p></li></ul><p>Ready to optimize your database? Analyze your tables‚Äô usage patterns, identify columns that can be partitioned, and consider caching for frequently accessed data. Experiment with these techniques in a test environment and watch your application‚Äôs performance soar!</p>","contentLength":3624,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Generative AI in the Real World: Understanding A2A with Heiko Hotz and Sokratis Kartakis","url":"https://www.oreilly.com/radar/podcast/generative-ai-in-the-real-world-understanding-a2a-with-heiko-hotz-and-sokratis-kartakis/","date":1755781961,"author":"Ben Lorica, Heiko Hotz and Sokratis Kartakis","guid":235710,"unread":true,"content":"<p>Everyone is talking about agents: single agents and, increasingly, multi-agent systems.

Why agent-to-agent communication? Some people might think we should focus on single-agent tooling first.</li><li><a href=\"https://cdn.oreillystatic.com/radar/generative-ai-real-world-podcast/GenAI_in_the_Real_World_with_Heiko_and%20_Sokratis.mp3#t=53\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">0:53</a>: Many developers start developing agents with completely different frameworks. At some point they want to link the agents together. One way is to change the code of your application. But it would be easier if you could get the agents talking the same language.&nbsp;</li><li><a href=\"https://cdn.oreillystatic.com/radar/generative-ai-real-world-podcast/GenAI_in_the_Real_World_with_Heiko_and%20_Sokratis.mp3#t=103\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">1:43</a>: Was A2A something developers approached you for?</li><li><a href=\"https://cdn.oreillystatic.com/radar/generative-ai-real-world-podcast/GenAI_in_the_Real_World_with_Heiko_and%20_Sokratis.mp3#t=113\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">1:53</a>: It is fair to say that A2A is a forward-looking protocol. We see a future where one team develops an agent that does something and another team in the same organization or even outside would like to leverage that capability. An agent is very different from an API. In the past, this was done via API. With agents, I need a stateful protocol where I send a task and the agent can run asynchronously in the background and do what it needs to do. That‚Äôs the justification for the A2A protocol. No one has explicitly asked for this, but we will be there in a few months time.&nbsp;</li><li><a href=\"https://cdn.oreillystatic.com/radar/generative-ai-real-world-podcast/GenAI_in_the_Real_World_with_Heiko_and%20_Sokratis.mp3#t=235\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">3:55</a>: For developers in this space, the most familiar is MCP, which is a single agent protocol focused on external tool integration. What is the relationship between MCP and A2A?</li><li><a href=\"https://cdn.oreillystatic.com/radar/generative-ai-real-world-podcast/GenAI_in_the_Real_World_with_Heiko_and%20_Sokratis.mp3#t=266\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">4:26</a>: We believe that MCP and A2A will be complementary and not rivals. MCP is specific to tools, and A2A connects agents with each other. That brings us to the question of when to wrap a functionality in a tool versus an agent. If we look at the technical implementation, that gives us some hints when to use each. An MCP tool exposes its capability by a structured schema: I need input A and B and I give you the sum. I can‚Äôt deviate from the schema. It‚Äôs also a single interaction. If I wrap the same functionality into an agent, the way I expose the functionality is different. A2A expects a natural language description of the agent‚Äôs functionality: ‚ÄúThe agent adds two numbers.‚Äù Also, A2A is stateful. I send a request and get a result. That gives developers a hint on when to use an agent and when to use a tool. I like to use the analogy of a vending machine versus a concierge. I put money into a vending machine and push a button and get something out. I talk to a concierge and say, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm thirsty; buy me something to drink.‚Äù</li><li><a href=\"https://cdn.oreillystatic.com/radar/generative-ai-real-world-podcast/GenAI_in_the_Real_World_with_Heiko_and%20_Sokratis.mp3#t=429\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">7:09</a>: Maybe we can help our listeners make the notion of A2A even more concrete. I tell nonexperts that you‚Äôre already using an agent to some extent. Deep research is an agent. I talk to people building AI tools in finance, and I have a notion that I want to research, but I have one agent looking at earnings, another looking at other data. Do you have a canonical example you use?</li><li><a href=\"https://cdn.oreillystatic.com/radar/generative-ai-real-world-podcast/GenAI_in_the_Real_World_with_Heiko_and%20_Sokratis.mp3#t=493\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">8:13</a>: We can parallelize A2A with real business. Imagine separate agents that are different employees with different skills. They have their own business cards. They share the business cards with the clients. The client can understand what tasks they want to do: learn about stocks, learn about investments. So I call the right agent or server to get a specialized answer back. Each agent has a business card that describes its skills and capabilities. I can talk to the agent with live streaming or send it messages. You need to define how you communicate with the agent. And you need to define the security method you will use to exchange messages.</li><li><a href=\"https://cdn.oreillystatic.com/radar/generative-ai-real-world-podcast/GenAI_in_the_Real_World_with_Heiko_and%20_Sokratis.mp3#t=585\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">9:45</a>: Late last year, people started talking about single agents. But people were already talking about what the agent stack would be: memory, storage, observability, and so on. Now that you are talking about multi-agents or A2A, are there important things that need to be introduced to the agentic stack?</li><li><a href=\"https://cdn.oreillystatic.com/radar/generative-ai-real-world-podcast/GenAI_in_the_Real_World_with_Heiko_and%20_Sokratis.mp3#t=632\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">10:32</a>: You would still have the same. You‚Äôd arguably need more. Statefulness, memory, access to tools.</li><li><a href=\"https://cdn.oreillystatic.com/radar/generative-ai-real-world-podcast/GenAI_in_the_Real_World_with_Heiko_and%20_Sokratis.mp3#t=648\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">10:48</a>: Is that going to be like a shared memory across agents?</li><li><a href=\"https://cdn.oreillystatic.com/radar/generative-ai-real-world-podcast/GenAI_in_the_Real_World_with_Heiko_and%20_Sokratis.mp3#t=652\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">10:52</a>: It all depends on the architecture. The way I imagine a vanilla architecture, the user speaks to a router agent, which is the primary contact of the user with the system. That router agent does very simple things like saying ‚Äúhello.‚Äù But once the user asks the system ‚ÄúBook me a holiday to Paris,‚Äù there are many steps involved. (No agent can do this yet). The capabilities are getting better and better. But the way I imagine it is that the router agent is the boss, and two or three remote agents do different things. One finds flights; one books hotels; one books cars‚Äîthey all need information from each other. The router agent would hold the context for all of those. If you build it all within one agentic framework, it becomes even easier because those frameworks have the concepts of shared memory built in. But it‚Äôs not necessarily needed. If the hotel booking agent is built in LangChain and from a different team than the flight booking agent, the router agent would decide what information is needed.</li><li><a href=\"https://cdn.oreillystatic.com/radar/generative-ai-real-world-podcast/GenAI_in_the_Real_World_with_Heiko_and%20_Sokratis.mp3#t=808\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">13:28</a>: What you just said is the argument for why you need these protocols. Your example is the canonical simple example. What if my trip involves four different countries? I might need a hotel agent for every country. Because hotels might need to be specialized for local knowledge.</li><li><a href=\"https://cdn.oreillystatic.com/radar/generative-ai-real-world-podcast/GenAI_in_the_Real_World_with_Heiko_and%20_Sokratis.mp3#t=852\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">14:12</a>: Technically, you might not need to change agents. You need to change the data‚Äîwhat agent has access to what data.&nbsp;</li><li><a href=\"https://cdn.oreillystatic.com/radar/generative-ai-real-world-podcast/GenAI_in_the_Real_World_with_Heiko_and%20_Sokratis.mp3#t=869\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">14:29</a>: We need to parallelize single agents with multi-agent systems; we move from a monolithic application to microservices that have small, dedicated agents to perform specific tasks. This has many benefits. It also makes the life of the developer easier because you can test, you can evaluate, you can perform checks before moving to production. Imagine that you gave a human 100 tools to perform a task. The human will get confused. It‚Äôs the same for agents. You need small agents with specific terms to perform the right task.&nbsp;</li><li><a href=\"https://cdn.oreillystatic.com/radar/generative-ai-real-world-podcast/GenAI_in_the_Real_World_with_Heiko_and%20_Sokratis.mp3#t=931\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">15:31</a>: Heiko‚Äôs example drives home why something like MCP may not be enough. If you have a master agent and all it does is integrate with external sites, but the integration is not smart‚Äîif the other side has an agent, that agent could be thinking as well. While agent-to-agent is something of a science fiction at the moment, it does make sense moving forward.</li><li><a href=\"https://cdn.oreillystatic.com/radar/generative-ai-real-world-podcast/GenAI_in_the_Real_World_with_Heiko_and%20_Sokratis.mp3#t=971\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">16:11</a>: Coming back to Sokratis‚Äôs thought, when you give an agent too many tools and make it try to do too many things, it just becomes more and more likely that by reasoning through these tools, it will pick the wrong tool. That gets us to evaluation and fault tolerance.&nbsp;</li><li><a href=\"https://cdn.oreillystatic.com/radar/generative-ai-real-world-podcast/GenAI_in_the_Real_World_with_Heiko_and%20_Sokratis.mp3#t=1012\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">16:52</a>: At some point we might see multi-agent systems communicate with other multi-agent systems‚Äîan agent mesh.</li><li><a href=\"https://cdn.oreillystatic.com/radar/generative-ai-real-world-podcast/GenAI_in_the_Real_World_with_Heiko_and%20_Sokratis.mp3#t=1025\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">17:05</a>: In the scenario of this hotel booking, each of the smaller agents would use their own local model. They wouldn‚Äôt all rely on a central model. Almost all frameworks allow you to choose the right model for the right task. If a task is simple but still requires an LLM, a small open source model could be sufficient. If the task requires heavy ‚Äúbrain‚Äù power, you might want to use Gemini 2.5 Pro.</li><li><a href=\"https://cdn.oreillystatic.com/radar/generative-ai-real-world-podcast/GenAI_in_the_Real_World_with_Heiko_and%20_Sokratis.mp3#t=1087\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">18:07</a>: Sokratis brought up the word security. One of the earlier attacks against MCP is a scenario when an attacker buries instructions in the system prompt of the MCP server or its metadata, which then gets sent into the model. In this case, you have smaller agents, but something may happen to the smaller agents. What attack scenarios worry you at this point?</li><li><a href=\"https://cdn.oreillystatic.com/radar/generative-ai-real-world-podcast/GenAI_in_the_Real_World_with_Heiko_and%20_Sokratis.mp3#t=1142\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">19:02</a>: There are many levels at which something might go wrong. With a single agent, you have to implement guardrails before and after each call to an LLM or agent.</li><li><a href=\"https://cdn.oreillystatic.com/radar/generative-ai-real-world-podcast/GenAI_in_the_Real_World_with_Heiko_and%20_Sokratis.mp3#t=1164\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">19:24</a>: In a single agent, there is one model. Now each agent is using its own model.&nbsp;</li><li><a href=\"https://cdn.oreillystatic.com/radar/generative-ai-real-world-podcast/GenAI_in_the_Real_World_with_Heiko_and%20_Sokratis.mp3#t=1135\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">19:35</a>: And this makes the evaluation and security guardrails even more problematic. From A2A‚Äôs side, it supports all the different security types to authenticate agents, like API keys, HTTP authentication, OAuth 2. Within the agent card, the agent can define what you need to use to use the agent. Then you need to think of this as a service possibility. It‚Äôs not just a responsibility of the protocol. It‚Äôs the responsibility of the developer.</li><li><a href=\"https://cdn.oreillystatic.com/radar/generative-ai-real-world-podcast/GenAI_in_the_Real_World_with_Heiko_and%20_Sokratis.mp3#t=1229\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">20:29</a>: It‚Äôs equivalent to right now with MCP. There are thousands of MCP servers. How do I know which to trust? But at the same time, there are thousands of Python packages. I have to figure out which to trust. At some level, some vetting needs to be done before you trust another agent. Is that right?</li><li><a href=\"https://cdn.oreillystatic.com/radar/generative-ai-real-world-podcast/GenAI_in_the_Real_World_with_Heiko_and%20_Sokratis.mp3#t=1260\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">21:00</a>: I would think so. There‚Äôs a great article: ‚Äú<a href=\"https://elenacross7.medium.com/%EF%B8%8F-the-s-in-mcp-stands-for-security-91407b33ed6b\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">The S in MCP Stands for Security</a>.‚Äù We can‚Äôt speak as much to the MCP protocol, but I do believe there have been efforts to implement authentication methods and address security concerns, because this is the number one question enterprises will ask. Without proper authentication and security, you will not have adoption in enterprises, which means you will not have adoption at all. WIth A2A, these concerns were addressed head-on because the A2A team understood that to get any chance of traction, built in security was priority 0.&nbsp;</li><li><a href=\"https://cdn.oreillystatic.com/radar/generative-ai-real-world-podcast/GenAI_in_the_Real_World_with_Heiko_and%20_Sokratis.mp3#t=1325\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">22:25</a>: Are you familiar with the buzzword ‚Äúlarge action models‚Äù? The notion that your model is now multimodal and can look at screens and environment states.</li><li><a href=\"https://cdn.oreillystatic.com/radar/generative-ai-real-world-podcast/GenAI_in_the_Real_World_with_Heiko_and%20_Sokratis.mp3#t=1371\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">22:51</a>: Within DeepMind, we have Project Mariner, which leverages Gemini‚Äôs capabilities to ask on your behalf about your computer screen.</li><li><a href=\"https://cdn.oreillystatic.com/radar/generative-ai-real-world-podcast/GenAI_in_the_Real_World_with_Heiko_and%20_Sokratis.mp3#t=1386\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">23:06</a>: It makes sense that it‚Äôs something you want to avoid if you can. If you can do things in a headless way, why do you want to pretend you‚Äôre human? If there‚Äôs an API or integration, you would go for that. But the reality is that many tools knowledge workers use may not have these features yet. How does that impact how we build agent security? Now that people might start building agents to act like knowledge workers using screens?</li><li><a href=\"https://cdn.oreillystatic.com/radar/generative-ai-real-world-podcast/GenAI_in_the_Real_World_with_Heiko_and%20_Sokratis.mp3#t=1425\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">23:45</a>: I spoke with a bank in the UK yesterday, and they were very clear that they need to have complete observability on agents, even if that means slowing down the process. Because of regulation, they need to be able to explain every request that went to the LLM, and every action that followed from that. I believe observability is the key in this setup, where you just cannot tolerate any errors. Because it is LLM-based, there will still be errors. But in a bank you must at least be in a position to explain exactly what happened.</li><li><a href=\"https://cdn.oreillystatic.com/radar/generative-ai-real-world-podcast/GenAI_in_the_Real_World_with_Heiko_and%20_Sokratis.mp3#t=1485\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">24:45</a>: With most customers, whenever there‚Äôs an agentic solution, they need to share that they are using an agentic solution and the way [they] are using it is X, Y, and Z. A legal agreement is required to use the agent. The customer needs to be clear about this. There are other scenarios like UI testing where, as a developer, I want an agent to start using my machine. Or an elder who is connected with customer support of a telco to fix a router. This is impossible for a nontechnical person to achieve. The fear is there, like nuclear energy, which can be used in two different ways. It‚Äôs the same with agents and GenAI.&nbsp;</li><li><a href=\"https://cdn.oreillystatic.com/radar/generative-ai-real-world-podcast/GenAI_in_the_Real_World_with_Heiko_and%20_Sokratis.mp3#t=1568\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">26:08</a>: A2A is a protocol. As a protocol, there‚Äôs only so much you can do on the security front. At some level, that‚Äôs the responsibility of the developers. I may want to signal that my agent is secure because I‚Äôve hired a third party to do penetration testing. Is there a way for the protocol to embed knowledge about the extra step?</li><li><a href=\"https://cdn.oreillystatic.com/radar/generative-ai-real-world-podcast/GenAI_in_the_Real_World_with_Heiko_and%20_Sokratis.mp3#t=1620\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">27:00</a>: A protocol can‚Äôt handle all the different cases. That‚Äôs why A2A created the notion of extensions. You can extend the data structure and also the methods or the profile. Within this profile, you can say, ‚ÄúI want all the agents to use this encryption.‚Äù And with that, you can tell all your systems to use the same patterns.

For someone who is familiar with RPC, with traditional internet protocols, A2A is very intuitive. You have a server; you have a client. All you need to learn is some specific concepts, like the agent card. (The agent card itself could be used to signal not only my capabilities but how I have been tested. You can even think of other metrics like uptime and success rate.) You need to understand the concept of a task. And then the remote agent will update on this task as defined‚Äîfor example, every five minutes or [upon] completion of specific subtasks.</li><li><a href=\"https://cdn.oreillystatic.com/radar/generative-ai-real-world-podcast/GenAI_in_the_Real_World_with_Heiko_and%20_Sokratis.mp3#t=1792\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">29:52</a>: A2A already supports JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, Java, and .NET.

Three weeks ago, I presented [at] the Google Cloud London Summit with a big customer on the integration of A2A into their agentic platform, and we shared tens of customers, including the announcement from Microsoft. Many customers start implementing agents. At some point they lack integration across business units.

In this post I'll outline the current progress of\nthe project and provide some technical details, including current caveats and\nfuture plans.</p><p>It is important to note that this is not a release and none of the described\nAPIs and functionalities is considered to be stable. Things are still changing\nand I'm not accepting bug reports for the time being.</p><p>The easiest way to use Common Lisp on a website is to include WECL and insert\nscript tags with a type \"text/common-lisp\". When the attribute src is present,\nthen first the runtime loads the script from that url, and then it executes the\nnode body. For example create and run this HTML document from localhost:</p><pre><code>&lt;!doctype html&gt;\n&lt;html&gt;\n  &lt;head&gt;\n    &lt;title&gt;Web Embeddable Common Lisp&lt;/title&gt;\n    &lt;link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"https://turtleware.eu/static/misc/wecl-20250821/easy.css\" /&gt;\n    &lt;script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"https://turtleware.eu/static/misc/wecl-20250821/boot.js\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\n    &lt;script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"https://turtleware.eu/static/misc/wecl-20250821/wecl.js\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\n  &lt;/head&gt;\n  &lt;body&gt;\n    &lt;script type=\"text/common-lisp\" src=\"https://turtleware.eu/static/misc/wecl-20250821/easy.lisp\" id='easy-script'&gt;\n(defvar *div* (make-element \"div\" :id \"my-ticker\"))\n(append-child [body] *div*)\n\n(dotimes (v 4)\n  (push-counter v))\n\n(loop for tic from 6 above 0\n      do (replace-children *div* (make-paragraph \"~a\" tic))\n         (js-sleep 1000)\n      finally (replace-children *div* (make-paragraph \"BOOM!\")))\n\n(show-script-text \"easy-script\")\n    &lt;/script&gt;\n  &lt;/body&gt;\n&lt;/html&gt;\n</code></pre><p>We may use Common Lisp that can call to JavaScript, and register callbacks to be\ncalled on specified events. The source code of the script can be found here:</p><p>Because the runtime is included as a script, the browser will usually cache the\n~10MB WebAssembly module.</p><p>The initial foreign function interface has numerous macros defining wrappers\nthat may be used from Common Lisp or passed to JavaScript.</p><p>Summary of currently available operators:</p><ul><li> an inlined expression, like </li><li> an object referenced from the object store</li><li> a function</li><li> a method of the argument, like </li><li> a slot reader of the argument</li><li> a slot writer of the first argument</li><li> combines define-js-getter and define-js-setter</li><li> template for JavaScript expressions</li><li> Common Lisp function reference callable from JavaScript</li><li> anonymous Common Lisp function reference (for closures)</li></ul><p>Summary of argument types:</p><table border=\"2\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"6\" rules=\"groups\" frame=\"hsides\"><thead><tr></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Common Lisp object reference</td></tr><tr><td>JavaScript object reference</td></tr><tr></tr><tr></tr><tr></tr></tbody></table><p>All operators, except for  have a similar lambda list:</p><blockquote><p>(DEFINE-JS NAME-AND-OPTIONS [ARGUMENTS [,@BODY]])</p></blockquote><p>The first argument is a list  that is common to all\ndefining operators:</p><ul><li> Common Lisp symbol denoting the object</li><li> a string denoting the JavaScript expression, i.e \"innerText\"</li><li> a type of the object returned by executing the expression</li></ul><pre><code>(define-js-variable ([document] :js-expr \"document\" :type :symbol))\n;; document\n(define-js-object ([body] :js-expr \"document.body\" :type :js-ref))\n;; wecl_ensure_object(document.body) /* -&gt; id   */\n;; wecl_search_object(id)            /* -&gt; node */\n</code></pre><p>The difference between a variable and an object in JS-FFI is that variable\nexpression is executed each time when the object is used (the expression is\ninlined), while the object expression is executed only once and the result is\nstored in the object store.</p><p>The second argument is a list of pairs . Names will be used in the\nlambda list of the operator callable from Common Lisp, while types will be used\nto coerce arguments to the type expected by JavaScript.</p><pre><code>(define-js-function (parse-float :js-expr \"parseFloat\" :type :js-ref)\n    ((value :string)))\n;; parseFloat(value)\n\n(define-js-method (add-event-listener :js-expr \"addEventListener\" :type :null)\n    ((self :js-ref)\n     (name :string)\n     (fun :js-ref)))\n;; self.addEventListener(name, fun)\n\n(define-js-getter (get-inner-text :js-expr \"innerText\" :type :string)\n    ((self :js-ref)))\n;; self.innerText\n\n(define-js-setter (set-inner-text :js-expr \"innerText\" :type :string)\n    ((self :js-ref)\n     (new :string)))\n;; self.innerText = new\n\n(define-js-accessor (inner-text :js-expr \"innerText\" :type :string)\n    ((self :js-ref)\n     (new :string)))\n;; self.innerText\n;; self.innerText = new\n\n(define-js-script (document :js-expr \"~a.forEach(~a)\" :type :js-ref)\n    ((nodes :js-ref)\n     (callb :object)))\n;; nodes.forEach(callb)\n</code></pre><p>The third argument is specific to callbacks, where we define Common Lisp body of\nthe callback. Argument types are used to coerce values from JavaScript to Common\nLisp.</p><pre><code>(define-js-callback (print-node :type :object)\n    ((elt :js-ref)\n     (nth :fixnum)\n     (seq :js-ref))\n  (format t \"Node ~2d: ~a~%\" nth elt))\n\n(let ((start 0))\n  (add-event-listener *my-elt* \"click\"\n                      (lambda-js-callback :null ((event :js-ref)) ;closure!\n                        (incf start)\n                        (setf (inner-text *my-elt*)\n                              (format nil \"Hello World! ~a\" start)))\n</code></pre><p>Note that callbacks are a bit different, because  does not\naccept  option and  has unique lambda list. It is\nimportant for callbacks to have an exact arity as they are called with, because\nJS-FFI does not implement variable number of arguments yet.</p><p>Callbacks can be referred by name with an operator .</p><p>While working on FFI I've decided to write an adapter for SLIME/SWANK that will\nallow interacting with WECL from Emacs. The principle is simple: we connect with\na websocket to Emacs that is listening on the specified port (i.e on localhost).\nThis adapter uses the library  written by Andrew Hyatt.</p><p>It allows for compiling individual forms with , but file compilation\ndoes not work (because files reside on a different \"host\"). REPL interaction\nworks as expected, as well as SLDB. The connection may occasionally be unstable,\nand until Common Lisp call returns, the whole page is blocked. Notably waiting\nfor new requests is not a blocking operation from the JavaScript perspective,\nbecause it is an asynchronous operation.</p><pre><code>;;; Patches for SLIME 2.31 (to be removed after the patch is merged).\n;;; It is assumed that SLIME is already loaded into Emacs.\n(defun slime-net-send (sexp proc)\n  \"Send a SEXP to Lisp over the socket PROC.\nThis is the lowest level of communication.

That means that if Lisp call\ndoesn't return (i.e because it waits for input in a loop), then we can't execute\nother Common Lisp statements from elsewhere because the application will crash.</p><p>Here's another example. It is more a cool gimmick than anything else, but let's\ntry it. Open a console on this very website (on firefox C-S-i) and execute:</p><pre><code>function inject_js(url) {\n    var head = document.getElementsByTagName('head')[0];\n    var script = document.createElement('script');\n    head.appendChild(script);\n    script.type = 'text/javascript';\n    return new Promise((resolve) =&gt; {\n        script.onload = resolve;\n        script.src = url;\n    });\n}\n\nfunction inject_cl() {\n    wecl_eval('(wecl/impl::js-load-slug \"https://turtleware.eu/static/misc/wecl-20250821\")');\n}\n\ninject_js('https://turtleware.eu/static/misc/wecl-20250821/boot.js')\n    .then(() =&gt; {\n        wecl_init_hooks.push(inject_cl);\n        inject_js('https://turtleware.eu/static/misc/wecl-20250821/wecl.js');\n    });\n</code></pre><p>With this, assuming that you've kept your LIME server open, you'll have a REPL\nonto uncooperative website. Now we can fool around with queries and changes:</p><pre><code>(define-js-accessor (title :js-expr \"title\" :type :string)\n  ((self :js-ref)\n   (title :string)))\n\n(define-js-accessor (background :js-expr \"body.style.backgroundColor\" :type :string)\n  ((self :js-ref)\n   (background :string)))\n\n(setf (title [document]) \"Write in Lisp!\")\n(setf (background [document]) \"#aaffaa\")\n</code></pre><p>The first thing to address is the lack of threading primitives. Native threads\ncan be implemented with web workers, but then our GC wouldn't know how to stop\nthe world to clean up. Another option is to use cooperative threads, but that\nalso won't work, because Emscripten doesn't support independent asynchronous\ncontexts, nor ECL is ready for that yet.</p><p>I plan to address both issues simultaneously in the second stage of the project\nwhen I port the runtime to WASI. We'll be able to use browser's GC, so running\nin multiple web workers should not be a problem anymore.

It uses specialized models (proprietary and best-of-LLM) tuned for invoices and other documents, while GPT/Claude are general-purpose LLMs.</p><p>You will see real Python code, actual outputs and a breakdown of when to use each tool (pros &amp; cons). At the end, there is a detailed comparison table on features &amp; benchmarks.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  üéØ Using GPT-4o (ChatGPT) API\n</h2><p>Let‚Äôs start with <a href=\"https://openai.com/index/hello-gpt-4o/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">OpenAI‚Äôs GPT-4o</a>. It's capable of understanding text and extracting structured information when prompted correctly. But unlike Invofox, it can‚Äôt directly read PDF files.</p><p>So we first need to extract the text using OCR (like Tesseract, pdfplumber or an online tool), then send that text to GPT via an API prompt.</p><p>GPT-4o, especially via the ChatGPT web interface and certain API endpoints (notably in Azure OpenAI Service), can accept PDFs and images as inputs and extract structured data. But since we are using the API, it's not really possible.</p><p>You will need an <a href=\"https://platform.openai.com/api-keys\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">OpenAI API key</a>. Create a  file and attach it with this convention.</p><div><pre><code>your_api_key\n</code></pre></div>\nopenai api key\n\n\n\n<p>We will use Python for this. Here's how you can try it yourself, step by step.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Step 1: Set up your Python environment\n</h3><p>Creating a virtual environment means setting up an isolated space for your Python project where all dependencies are installed locally (and not system-wide). This avoids version conflicts and keeps your global Python installation clean. So let‚Äôs create one.</p><div><pre><code>\npython3  venv /bin/activate  \npython  venv \n.nvcriptsctivate  </code></pre></div><p>You will know it‚Äôs active when you see  at the beginning of your terminal prompt.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Step 2: Install required packages\n</h3><p>We need two main libraries:</p><ul><li>: to use the GPT-4o API</li><li> : Loads environment variables from a  file into Python, useful for managing API keys and secrets.\n</li></ul><div><pre><code>pip pdfplumber openai python-dotenv\n</code></pre></div><p>I installed the  later so that's why it's not visible in the command.</p><p>After installing your dependencies, run:</p><div><pre><code>pip freeze  requirements.txt\n</code></pre></div><p>This writes all installed packages in your virtual environment (with versions) into . You can then use this file later with:</p><div><pre><code>pip  requirements.txt\n</code></pre></div><p>For reference, please add a  in the root directory to avoid pushing the virtual environment directory.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Step 3: Extract text and parse with GPT-4o\n</h3><p>Here is the <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/16CgRRnk9KAn1lHhm2os9niJjKXM8tcnt/view?usp=sharing\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">sample Invoice PDF</a> that I'm using for the example. I'm attaching a snapshot so you can get the idea of the fields we are going to extract.</p><p>Let's write the complete code with the file name as .</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Here's a simple explanation:</p><ul><li><p> : uses  reads each page of the PDF and concatenates the extracted text. This gives you the raw, unstructured invoice content as a string.</p></li><li><p><code>parse_invoice_with_openai</code> : Sends this prompt to the GPT‚Äë4o model via the  endpoint, asking GPT‚Äë4o to extract five key fields. </p></li><li><p>The model then processes the prompt and returns a JSON-formatted response.</p></li></ul><p>Here is the JSON response after running the script using .</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>GPT-4o (ChatGPT) output for invoice line items isn‚Äôt consistently labeled \"lines\". Sometimes it's \"Line Items\" or something less standardized, while other tools (like Invofox) always use a consistent name like \"lines\" for those entries.</p>\nterminal output\n\n\n\n<p>Here we instruct GPT-4o via a system prompt to parse the text. This can work reasonably well as the API is strong enough now (compared to previous OpenAI models).</p><p>‚úÖ Pros: Easy to try, flexible. GPT-4 excels at logic and structured data extraction, so it can correctly identify invoice fields and calculate totals.</p><ul><li>The problem I see is that we still have to engineer prompts and verify the output (which is not possible for everyone).</li><li>The JSON can be malformed or may miss fields (hallucinations are possible). </li><li>There‚Äôs no built‚Äëin validation or confidence scores. </li><li>GPT requires sending all text in prompts (which would be costly for large docs) and outputs vary by prompt style.</li></ul><p>GPT-4o is billed per token. The estimated cost for a 1‚Äì2 page invoice extraction falls in the $0.005‚Äì$0.018 range, depending on how detailed your prompt and output are. You can also use this <a href=\"https://docsbot.ai/tools/gpt-openai-api-pricing-calculator\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">pricing calculator</a> based on your use case.</p><p>It can respond in 1‚Äì30s but is subject to load spikes, especially for large prompts.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  üéØ Using Claude 3.5 Sonnet API\n</h2><p><a href=\"https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-3-5-sonnet\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Anthropic's Claude 3.5 Sonnet</a> model is also capable of parsing structured data from text when prompted correctly. Like GPT-4o, it cannot read PDF files directly via API, so we will first extract the text from an invoice PDF, then pass it to Claude for structured parsing.</p><p>You will need an <a href=\"https://console.anthropic.com/settings/keys\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Anthropic API key</a>. Create a  file and attach it with this convention:</p><div><pre><code>ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_api_key\n</code></pre></div><p>We will use Python again for this setup and follow the same instructions used in the last section.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Step 1: Set up environment and install packages\n</h3><p>Just like before, let‚Äôs isolate our dependencies in a virtual environment.</p><div><pre><code>\npython3  venv /bin/activate\n\n\npython  venv \n.nvcriptsctivate\n</code></pre></div><p>Once activated, your terminal will show a  prefix.</p><p>We need the following libraries:</p><ul><li> : to extract text from PDF</li><li> : official SDK to interact with Claude 3.5</li><li> : to load the API key from a  file\n</li></ul><div><pre><code>pip pdfplumber anthropic python-dotenv\n</code></pre></div><p>If you are following from the last example, we just need to install the anthropic package.</p><p>Then export your environment to a  file. Make sure to include a  to avoid committing the virtual environment.</p><div><pre><code>pip freeze  requirements.txt\n</code></pre></div><h3>\n  \n  \n  Step 2: Extract text and parse with Claude 3.5 Sonnet\n</h3><p>As Anthropic launches safer and more capable models, they regularly retire older models. So you can check the <a href=\"https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/about-claude/model-deprecations#model-status\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">model status</a> of which ones are deprecated, retired and which ones are active. I will be using <code>claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620</code> active version for the example.</p><p>Let's write the complete code with the file name as . It's very similar to the previous section and I'm using the same <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/16CgRRnk9KAn1lHhm2os9niJjKXM8tcnt/view?usp=sharing\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">sample Invoice PDF</a>.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Here's a simple explanation:</p><ul><li><p> : uses  to pull plain text from each page of the PDF.</p></li><li><p><code>parse_invoice_with_claude</code> : sends the text to Claude Sonnet 3.5 with a specific prompt asking for JSON output.</p></li><li><p>Claude returns a stringified JSON block with the requested fields.</p></li></ul><p>You can run the script using  in the terminal. Here's the JSON response:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><ul><li>Claude 3.5 is very strong at understanding long text and formatting it cleanly.</li><li>Claude Sonnet can handle text (and even images via embedding) in its prompts</li><li>In some cases, it handles unusual or long documents slightly better than GPT-4.</li></ul><ul><li>Like GPT, Claude requires prompt engineering.</li><li>Like GPT, Claude can sometimes miss fields or make up values (hallucinate).</li><li>It still returns raw JSON text without validation, so you must parse/verify it.</li><li>You still need to extract text yourself, it doesn‚Äôt parse raw PDFs.</li></ul><p>Claude 3.5 Sonnet is also billed per token. The estimated cost for a 1‚Äì2 page invoice extraction falls in the $0.005‚Äì$0.018 range, depending on how detailed your prompt and output are. You can also use this <a href=\"https://custom.typingmind.com/tools/estimate-llm-usage-costs/claude-3.5-sonnet\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">pricing calculator</a> based on your use case.</p><p>It's exceptionally fast for small prompts (200‚Äì300ms) but larger or more complex stimuli can raise latency to 10s or more. </p><p>So I was searching for a better solution unlike code-based (OpenAI &amp; Anthropic) approaches requiring prompt engineering, I found many good tools like Invofox, Google Document AI, Amazon Textract. </p><p>What stood out about <a href=\"https://www.invofox.com/en\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Invofox</a> is that it‚Äôs backed by Y Combinator and has all the features I needed. That gave me the confidence to dig deeper and try it out.</p><p>It provides a plug‚Äëand‚Äëplay AI-powered document parsing API that makes it super easy to extract data from invoices, receipts, payslips, bank statements, loan/mortgage files and custom document types like bills.</p><p>They have some useful built-in features like:</p><p>It automatically separates multiple documents contained within a single PDF (such as mixed invoices or statements), grouping pages into logical sub-documents for better extraction and automation.  </p><p>It's configurable via API during upload and works alongside the classifier for cleaner downstream processing</p><p>Pretrained AI model that detects document types (invoice, receipt, etc) so that each document is processed using the correct schema. It's optional and can be enabled per environment or request.</p><p>They also use advanced AI models with proprietary algorithms that verify and autocomplete your data. Check <a href=\"https://developers.invofox.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">API Docs</a>.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Step 1: Sign up for the dashboard\n</h3><p>You can sign up for the dashboard to generate an API key.</p><p>You can manually upload the document as well but we will be using the API since it's easier and much better in experience.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Step 2: Creating the request in Postman\n</h3><p>Once you have your API key, you can use <a href=\"https://www.postman.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Postman</a> to send documents for parsing using Invofox's  endpoint.</p><p>‚úÖ 1. Create a New Request</p><ul><li><p>Open the Postman Desktop application</p></li><li><p>Create a collection and add a request</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>We need to request this endpoint: <code>https://api.invofox.com/v1/ingest/uploads</code></p></li></ul><p>Go to the Headers tab and add:</p><ul><li>key: , value: </li><li>key: , value: </li></ul><p>You should not manually set  as Postman will handle it automatically when using form-data. It tells the server what format the data in your request body is:</p><ul><li><p> ‚Üí You're sending raw JSON</p></li><li><p> ‚Üí You are sending files + form fields</p></li><li><p><code>application/x-www-form-urlencoded</code> ‚Üí You're sending form-like text fields (like an HTML form)</p></li></ul><p>When you're sending files using Postman‚Äôs form-data option, Postman automatically sets the correct  and boundary values (which are required for ).</p><p>If you manually set it like this:</p><div><pre><code>Content-Type: multipart/form-data\n</code></pre></div><p>You are missing the boundary part, which is something like:</p><div><pre><code>Content-Type: multipart/form-data; boundary=----WebKitFormBoundaryxyz\n</code></pre></div><p>Let's add the body fields.</p><p>‚úÖ 3. Add the Body (form-data)</p><p>Switch to the Body tab, select  and add the following two fields:</p><ul><li>key: , type: , value: upload your invoice ()</li></ul><ul><li>key: , type: , value: Paste the JSON below\n</li></ul><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>The&nbsp;&nbsp;field is optional here as it's&nbsp;only needed if you want to pass custom metadata or extra instructions&nbsp;(such as information to influence parsing, verification preferences or to register edge-case scenarios for custom document types).</p><p>Beyond standard types (invoice, payslip, bank statement), you can register custom document types in your Invofox dashboard. These custom types get a unique ID like  (used in the example), which is what we are now passing to the API. </p><p>By specifying a type ID, you ensure your files are parsed according to the exact schema you set up:</p><ul><li>Your custom JSON structure</li><li>Custom validation rules and human review workflows</li></ul><p>Click \"Send\". If everything is set up correctly, you will get a response with details on documentID.</p><ul><li> is the batch ID for this upload (useful for tracking multiple files uploaded together)</li><li> is the ID of the parsed document\n</li></ul><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><h3>\n  \n  \n  Step 3: Get Parsed Document\n</h3><p>There are two ways: one is to check the Invofox dashboard to find the newly parsed document. As you can notice, the line items and breakdowns are displayed in a table format. The GUI also provides many options, including filtering the extracted data.</p><p>Based on how the workflow is set up, it may be necessary to mark it as completed, as involving a human in the loop ensures the highest accuracy and gives us more control.</p><p>The other way (recommended) is to make a  request to <code>https://api.invofox.com/documents/{documentID}</code> with headers as:</p><ul><li>key: , value: </li><li>key: , value: </li></ul><p>Here is a trimmed JSON response with the original format. It also provides the image of the original invoice in the response and a lot of extra fields compared to the earlier responses of GPT-4o &amp; Claude.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Pricing is not public, so potential users must contact their team for a commercial offer, but the product is specifically tuned for production speed and reliability. Actual test response times reported in the blog are consistently under 5s.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  üéØ Python Code using Invofox API\n</h3><p>Many developers prefer extracting documents with code, so let‚Äôs walk through the same process using the Invofox API with Python. We will keep it brief, with just the code and JSON response.</p><p>The overall process is the same as the previous sections, so I'm not repeating that. You can read the <a href=\"https://developers.invofox.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">docs</a> if you are interested in exploring for yourself.</p><p>We need to install <a href=\"https://pypi.org/project/requests/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">requests</a>, a Python library that makes it easy to send HTTP requests (such as GET, POST) and work with web APIs.</p><p>We will also use the  built-in Python module that comes pre-installed with every standard Python installation. The&nbsp;&nbsp;module provides various time-related functions such as delays (), timestamps and more. In our case, we will use it to pause execution, giving the document enough time to be processed on the dashboard.</p><p>Let's write the complete code with the file name as .</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Here are all the Invofox API endpoints used:</p><p>Here is the JSON response after running the script using .</p><p>The JSON response is similar to what we got after making a request using Postman. It also provides the image of the original invoice in the response and a lot of useful fields.</p><p>Let's compare their methods in brief.</p><ul><li><ul><li>GPT-4o/Claude ‚Üí send text with prompt</li><li>Invofox ‚Üí use API or upload a file (image/PDF) in bulk</li></ul></li><li><ul><li>GPT/Claude ‚Üí need to write prompt engineering code</li><li>Invofox ‚Üí minimal code, no prompt</li></ul></li><li><ul><li>GPT/Claude ‚Üí you need to manually verify </li><li>Invofox ‚Üí built-in validation and confidence scores</li></ul></li><li><ul><li>GPT/Claude ‚Üí limited by token/window size</li><li>Invofox ‚Üí handles multi-page docs via backend OCR and AI</li></ul></li></ul><p>While parsing the invoice, here's what I realized:</p><ul><li><p> : Good at parsing known fields if prompted clearly. You get a JSON string but must parse/clean it yourself. Errors can occur if prompts are unclear.</p></li><li><p> : It's very similar to GPT-4. In the snapshots, you can see Sonnet handled the invoice fields about as well as GPT-4, sometimes better at recognizing unfamiliar terms. But we still had to massage the prompt.</p></li><li><p> : It returned the fully parsed invoice JSON out-of-the-box. All fields were correctly extracted and validated. The output schema was exactly what we needed, with no extra coding.</p></li></ul><p>Now that we have explored each option, let‚Äôs compare them side by side. Estimates are based on typical invoice lengths: simple invoices are 1‚Äì2 pages &amp; 1000-2000 tokens total.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Cost &amp; Execution Time Benchmarks\n</h3><p>We covered the pricing structure in each of the sections, but I have also done it side-by-side so it's easier to make a decision.</p><p>You should also acknowledge the ongoing cost and effort involved in upgrading language models. Teams often need to benchmark new models, retest prompts and schemas and adjust output parsing logic whenever a new version is released.</p><p>These hidden maintenance costs aren‚Äôt always obvious but should be considered. With Invofox, there is no such requirement.</p><p>For quick experiments or one-off tasks, you can use GPT-4 (ChatGPT API) or Claude Sonnet to parse invoice text by crafting suitable prompts. They will do a decent job extracting fields in JSON (since GPT-4 tends to produce more structured and cleaner outputs than earlier GPT-3). </p><p>However, for reliable production-grade parsing of invoices or receipts, the Invofox API is superior. It‚Äôs specifically built for documents using advanced proprietary models and continual feedback.</p><p>I hope you learned how to parse documents. Let me know if you have any questions or feedback.</p><p>Have a great day!

The convener projected a Word document on the screen and people called out proposed changes, which were then debated in the room before being adopted or adapted, added or subtracted. I kid you not.</p><p>I don‚Äôt remember exactly when this was, but I know it was after the introduction of Google Docs in 2005, because I do remember being completely baffled and frustrated that this international standards organization was still stuck somewhere in the previous century.</p><p>You may not have experienced anything this extreme, but many people will remember the days of sending around Word files as attachments and then collating and comparing multiple divergent versions. And this behavior also persisted long after 2005. (Apparently, this is still the case in some contexts, such as in parts of the U.S. government.) If you aren‚Äôt old enough to have experienced that, consider yourself lucky.</p><p>This is, in many ways, the point of Arvind Narayanan and Sayash Kapoor‚Äôs essay ‚Äú<a href=\"https://knightcolumbia.org/content/ai-as-normal-technology\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">AI as Normal Technology</a>.‚Äù There is a long gap between the invention of a technology and a true understanding of how to apply it. One of the canonical examples came at the end of the Second Industrial Revolution. When first electrified, factories duplicated the design of factories powered by coal and steam, where immense central boilers and steam engines distributed mechanical power to various machines by complex arrangements of gears and pulleys. The steam engines were replaced by large electric motors, but the layout of the factory remained unchanged.</p><p>Only over time were factories reconfigured to take advantage of small electric motors that could be distributed throughout the factory and incorporated into individual specialized machines. As <a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/radar/is-ai-a-normal-technology/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">I discussed last week with Arvind Narayanan</a>, there are four stages to every technology revolution: the invention of new technology; the diffusion of knowledge about it; the development of products based on it; and adaptation by consumers, businesses, and society as a whole. All this takes time. I love James Bessen‚Äôs framing of this process as ‚Äú<a href=\"https://yalebooks.yale.edu/book/9780300195668/learning-by-doing/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">learning by doing</a>.‚Äù It takes time and shared learning to understand how best to apply a new technology, to <a href=\"https://www.billcollinsenglish.com/OrdinaryEveningHaven.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">search the possible for its possibleness</a>. People try new things, show them to others, and build on them in a marvelous kind of leapfrogging of the imagination.</p><p>So it is no surprise that in 2005 files were still being sent around by email, and that one day a small group of inventors came up with a way to realize the true possibilities of the internet and built an environment where a file could be shared in real time by a set of collaborators, with all the mechanisms of version control present but hidden from view.</p><p>On next Tuesday‚Äôs episode of <a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/live/live-with-tim/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"></a>, I‚Äôll be talking with that small group‚ÄîSam Schillace, Steve Newman, and Claudia Carpenter‚Äîwhose company Writely was launched in beta 20 years ago this month. Writely was acquired by Google in March of 2006 and became the basis of Google Docs.</p><p>In that same year, Google also reinvented online maps, spreadsheets, and more. It was a year that some fundamental lessons of the internet‚Äîalready widely available since the early 1990s‚Äîfinally began to sink in.</p><p>Remembering this moment matters a lot, because we are at a similar point today, where we think we know what to do with AI but are still building the equivalent of factories with huge centralized engines rather than truly searching out the possibility of its deployed capabilities. Ethan Mollick recently wrote a wonderful essay about the opportunities (and failure modes) of this moment in ‚Äú<a href=\"https://www.oneusefulthing.org/p/the-bitter-lesson-versus-the-garbage\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">The Bitter Lesson Versus the Garbage Can</a>.‚Äù Do we really begin to grasp what is possible with AI or just try to fit it into our old business processes?

What many people don‚Äôt realize is that most photos already come with a hidden trail of breadcrumbs that can solve this problem: .</p><p>Every time you snap a photo with a smartphone or digital camera, extra information gets embedded into the file, details like the date, camera settings, and, in many cases, the exact GPS coordinates of where the picture was taken. This hidden metadata is called <strong>EXIF (Exchangeable Image File Format)</strong>, and it‚Äôs more powerful than it looks. While smartphones often automatically organize your photos, many of us still have massive collections stored on a , where sorting and searching manually can feel impossible.</p><p>By extracting EXIF data, you can do much more than just learn which lens or exposure setting was used. You can <strong>index, organize, and search your entire photo library</strong> in ways that go far beyond filenames and folders. Want to pull up every photo taken in Paris? Or quickly filter for shots within 10 kilometers (about 6 miles) of Central Park? With EXIF indexing, that becomes not only possible but straightforward.</p><p>In this article, we‚Äôll explore how to extract EXIF metadata, build an index of your photos, including those on NAS drives, and run location-based searches to find exactly what you‚Äôre looking for.</p><p>When you take a photo, your camera doesn‚Äôt just capture light, it also records a set of descriptive details about the image, known as . EXIF stands for <strong>Exchangeable Image File Format</strong>, and it‚Äôs a standardized way of embedding extra information directly into the image file itself.</p><p>Think of EXIF as the \"digital notebook\" your camera keeps for each shot. Some of the most common fields include:</p><ul><li> ‚Äì the exact date and time the photo was taken.</li><li> ‚Äì make, model, lens, focal length, aperture, shutter speed, ISO.</li><li> ‚Äì latitude, longitude, and sometimes altitude, if location services were enabled.</li></ul><p>Among these, the GPS data is especially powerful for organizing and searching photos. Cameras and smartphones typically store coordinates in a format based on degrees, minutes, and seconds. For example:</p><div><pre><code>Latitude: 40¬∞ 46‚Ä≤ 56.62‚Ä≥ N  \nLongitude: 73¬∞ 58‚Ä≤ 0.85‚Ä≥ W  \nAltitude: 15.0 m  \n</code></pre></div><p>This information can be converted into decimal degrees (e.g., ), which is a more convenient format for indexing and performing calculations like distance searches.</p><p>EXIF isn‚Äôt just technical clutter inside your photos. It‚Äôs a hidden layer of context that tells you  and  a picture was taken, and with what gear, making it a goldmine for indexing and retrieval.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Extracting EXIF Data from Photos\n</h2><p>Now that we know what EXIF metadata is, the next step is learning how to actually .

You have the recipe (your machine learning algorithm), but the perfect cake depends on the precise amounts of each ingredient (your hyperparameters): the oven temperature, baking time, amount of sugar, etc. Getting these just right is crucial for a delicious outcome. This, in essence, is hyperparameter tuning. And Grid Search is one powerful technique to help us find that perfect recipe.</p><p>Hyperparameter tuning is the process of finding the optimal set of hyperparameters for a machine learning model to achieve the best possible performance. Hyperparameters are settings that are  learned from the data during training, unlike the model's parameters (weights and biases). They control the learning process itself. Grid Search is a brute-force approach to hyperparameter tuning where we systematically try out every combination of hyperparameters within a predefined range.</p><p>Let's break down the core concepts:</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  1. The Hyperparameter Landscape\n</h3><p>Imagine a multi-dimensional space where each dimension represents a hyperparameter (e.g., learning rate, regularization strength). Each point in this space represents a unique combination of hyperparameters, and each point corresponds to a model's performance (e.g., accuracy, F1-score). Our goal is to find the point with the highest performance.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  2. The Grid Search Algorithm\n</h3><p>Grid Search is a straightforward algorithm:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Define the hyperparameter search space:</strong>  Specify the range and values for each hyperparameter.  For example:  in ,  in .</p></li><li><p> Generate all possible combinations of hyperparameter values.  This forms our \"grid\" of points in the hyperparameter space.</p></li><li><p> For each combination in the grid:</p><ul><li>Train the model using those hyperparameters.</li><li>Evaluate the model's performance using a suitable metric (e.g., accuracy on a validation set).</li></ul></li><li><p> Choose the hyperparameter combination that yielded the best performance.</p></li></ol><p>Here's a simplified Python pseudo-code representation:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><h3>\n  \n  \n  3.  Mathematical Underpinnings (Optimization)\n</h3><p>Grid Search doesn't explicitly use gradient-based optimization. Instead, it's a form of . Gradient-based methods, like gradient descent, rely on calculating the gradient (the direction of steepest ascent) of the performance function with respect to each hyperparameter. This gradient guides the search towards better hyperparameter combinations. Grid Search, however, simply tries all combinations and selects the best one. It's computationally expensive but conceptually simple.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Real-World Applications and Impact\n</h2><p>Grid Search, despite its simplicity, finds widespread application:</p><ul><li> Optimizing convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures by tuning hyperparameters like the number of layers, filter sizes, and learning rate.</li><li><strong>Natural Language Processing (NLP):</strong> Fine-tuning the hyperparameters of recurrent neural networks (RNNs) or transformers for tasks like sentiment analysis or machine translation.</li><li> Adjusting the hyperparameters of collaborative filtering or content-based filtering algorithms to improve recommendation accuracy.</li></ul><h2>\n  \n  \n  Challenges and Limitations\n</h2><ul><li>  The number of combinations grows exponentially with the number of hyperparameters and the range of values.  This can be computationally prohibitive for complex models or large search spaces.</li><li>  As the number of hyperparameters increases, the search space becomes incredibly vast, making it difficult to find the global optimum.</li><li> Grid Search might get stuck in a local optimum, especially in non-convex performance landscapes.</li></ul><p>The computational cost of Grid Search can have environmental implications due to high energy consumption. Careful consideration of the search space and efficient algorithms are crucial to mitigate this.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  The Future of Hyperparameter Tuning\n</h2><p>While Grid Search provides a valuable baseline, more sophisticated techniques like randomized search, Bayesian optimization, and evolutionary algorithms are gaining popularity due to their efficiency in handling high-dimensional search spaces. Research continues to explore more efficient and robust methods for hyperparameter optimization, addressing the challenges of scalability and the need for less computationally expensive solutions.

Where sex, trade, and culture operated under systems of inequality. And yet, despite these challenges, ideas and identities moved faster than we might think. This is the fascinating world of Ancient Rome, a complex, uneven, and often uncomfortable prototype of globalization.</p><p>In this blog post, we'll take a closer look at what it was like to live in Ancient Rome as an ordinary person, navigating daily life. We'll explore the roads, the sex, the trade, and the culture, and see how they all fit together to create a world that was both familiar and foreign to us.</p><p>First, let's talk about the roads. The Romans were famous for their engineering feats, and their roads were no exception. They built roads all over their empire, connecting cities and towns and making it easier for people and goods to move around. But these roads were not built for convenience. They were built for conquest. The Romans believed that having a well-connected empire was essential for maintaining control over their territories, and so they invested heavily in building and maintaining their roads.</p><p>Next, let's talk about sex. Sex was an important part of Roman culture, and it was often used as a way to assert power and status. Men were expected to be the active partners in sexual relationships, while women were expected to be passive. However, there were also many examples of same-sex relationships in ancient Rome, and these were often accepted and even celebrated.</p><p>Moving on to trade, the Romans were skilled traders. They established a system of currency that allowed for the exchange of goods and services across their empire. They also built ports and markets to facilitate trade, and they encouraged the growth of industries such as agriculture and mining.</p><p>Finally, let's talk about culture. The Romans had a rich and diverse culture, with influences from all over the world. They were known for their art, literature, and architecture, and they were also famous for their festivals and celebrations. However, like many ancient societies, the Romans also had systems of inequality in place. The wealthy and powerful held most of the power, while the poor and marginalized were often left out of the decision-making process.</p><p>Despite these challenges, the Roman Empire was a remarkable achievement. It was a complex, uneven, and often uncomfortable prototype of globalization, with roads, sex, trade, and culture all operating under systems of inequality. But despite these challenges, ideas and identities moved faster than we might think, and the legacy of the Roman Empire continues to shape our world today.</p><p>So, the next time you're driving on a well-connected highway or enjoying a piece of Roman art, take a moment to appreciate the incredible achievements of this ancient civilization. And remember, even in the most complex and uneven of societies, there is always room for growth and change.</p>","contentLength":3079,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"What happens inside the computer when you run your Go server","url":"https://dev.to/turjoc120/what-happens-inside-the-computer-when-you-run-your-go-server-165n","date":1755735658,"author":"Turjo Chowdhury","guid":234844,"unread":true,"content":"<p>Before we deep dive, let's learn a couple of important concepts</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  What Are Sockets and File Descriptors?\n</h2><ul><li>Sockets are endpoints for communication between computers over a network, enabling real-time data exchange.</li><li>Unlike regular files, sockets do not store data but facilitate data transfer between machines.</li><li>When Go requests a socket from the operating system (OS), the OS creates the socket and assigns a unique identifier called a file descriptor.</li><li>A file descriptor is an integer handle that the Go server uses to manage and reference the socket.</li><li>This mechanism allows the server to efficiently send and receive network data through OS-managed resources.</li></ul><h2>\n  \n  \n  Go‚Äôs Concurrency with Goroutines\n</h2><ul><li>Go uses goroutines, lightweight threads, to handle many client requests concurrently.</li><li>The main goroutine continuously waits for incoming requests.</li><li>For each new request, Go creates a new goroutine to process it independently without blocking the main one.</li><li>This design ensures the server remains fast and scalable, handling multiple clients simultaneously.</li><li>When no requests arrive, the main goroutine sleeps to conserve system resources and improve overall efficiency.</li></ul><h2>\n  \n  \n  Understanding How It Works in Your Computer\n</h2><ul><li>The kernel is the core part of the operating system that manages hardware and processes.</li><li>Network requests first travel through a router and then reach your computer‚Äôs Network Interface Card (NIC), like a WiFi adapter or Ethernet port.</li><li>The NIC converts the wireless or wired signals into binary data and temporarily stores it in a buffer.</li><li>It then sends a signal to the kernel to process this new data.</li><li>The kernel copies the data into a socket buffer that the Go server listens to, and marks it ready for reading.</li><li>The Go runtime wakes up the goroutine to read and process the request.</li><li>The server sends the response back through the socket and NIC.</li><li>The response reaches the client‚Äôs browser.</li></ul>","contentLength":1902,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Title: Discovering a Rare Type of Black Hole Feasting on a Star","url":"https://dev.to/yagyaraj_sharma_6cd410179/title-discovering-a-rare-type-of-black-hole-feasting-on-a-star-2a4k","date":1755735631,"author":"Insights YRS","guid":234841,"unread":true,"content":"<h2>\n  \n  \n  Title: Discovering a Rare Type of Black Hole Feasting on a Star\n</h2><p>As a science and space enthusiast, I am always excited to learn about new discoveries in the field of astronomy.

Today, I'm the creator of a fully-functional, decentralized, on-chain game called <a href=\"https://muschairs.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Musical Chairs</a>. The twist? I didn't write a single line of the production code myself. <strong>100% of it was generated by Gemini, my AI coding partner integrated into VS Code.</strong></p><p>This isn't just a story about a cool project; it's a story about a new way of building. It's about how a single person with a clear vision can leverage AI to execute complex technical tasks, from writing secure smart contracts to deploying a multi-container production environment.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  The Idea: Decentralization First\n</h3><p>The concept was simple: take the childhood game of Musical Chairs and bring it to the blockchain. A game of pure reaction, provably fair, where the winner takes the pot.</p><p>My initial thought was to use a stablecoin like USDT for the game's currency. It seemed user-friendly. However, as Gemini and I delved into the technicals, I discovered a fundamental conflict with my vision. The USDT smart contract is controlled by a central entity, Tether, which has the technical ability to pause or freeze any wallet. This \"kill switch\" functionality, while understandable from their perspective, was a deal-breaker for me. The core of my project was to be .</p><p>This led to my first major pivot: the game would use the native currency of the chain (ETH on Arbitrum). This not only ensured complete decentralization‚Äîwhere no single entity could interfere with player funds‚Äîbut also simplified the smart contract logic significantly. To account for price volatility, the owner can adjust the stake amount as needed.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  The High-Level Architecture\n</h3><p>The application is composed of three main pillars, all orchestrated within a Docker environment.</p><ol><li><strong>Smart Contract (Solidity):</strong> The heart of the game. It acts as the <strong>unstoppable and transparent source of truth</strong>, handling player stakes, game state transitions, and prize distribution. Through a proxy pattern, it provides <strong>a stable, immutable address and state for users</strong>, while allowing the owner to securely upgrade the underlying game logic.</li><li> The brains of the operation. It manages the game lifecycle, listens for blockchain events, and communicates with players in real-time via WebSockets. It's the off-chain coordinator for the on-chain action.</li><li> The face of the game. A simple, lightweight client that interacts with the user's wallet (like MetaMask) and communicates with the backend.</li></ol><p>Here's how they interact:</p><ul><li>  A user connects their wallet on the .</li><li>  The  talks to the  via a REST API to get game configuration and via WebSockets for real-time updates (e.g., other players joining).</li><li>  The  listens to the blockchain for events from the  (like deposits).</li><li>  The  sends transactions to the  to manage the game (e.g., starting the music round).</li></ul><p>To run this in production, we containerized everything. This makes deployment, scaling, and management incredibly robust.</p><ul><li>: The entry point. It handles SSL, serves the frontend, and routes API/WebSocket traffic.</li><li>: The main Go application.</li><li>: A dedicated, hardened microservice whose only job is to sign blockchain transactions.</li><li>: The database for storing game history and analytics data.</li><li>: An intrusion prevention service that monitors logs and bans malicious IPs.</li><li>: A self-hosted, privacy-respecting analytics service.\nmarkdown</li><li> A key privacy-enforcing service. It's configured to rotate Nginx logs daily while keeping zero old log files (). This ensures that sensitive information like IP addresses is purged from the server in less than 24 hours, maximizing user anonymity.</li></ul><h3>\n  \n  \n  Deep Dive: The Smart Contract\n</h3><p>The smart contract is the most critical piece of the puzzle. Security, reliability, and transparency were non-negotiable. Here‚Äôs how we achieved that.</p><p>We used <strong>OpenZeppelin's UUPS (Universal Upgradeable Proxy Standard)</strong>. This allows the contract logic to be upgraded without losing the contract's state (i.e., ongoing games, funds). It's a battle-tested pattern for long-term projects.</p><p>A key security measure is the  call in the implementation contract's constructor:</p><div><pre><code>/// @custom:oz-upgrades-unsafe-allow constructor\nconstructor() {\n    _disableInitializers();\n}\n</code></pre></div><p>This prevents anyone from calling the  function on the logic contract itself, which could otherwise be a vector for hijacking. Interestingly, this line had to be commented out during testing with tools like Echidna and Foundry, as they would fail, but it's crucial for production security.</p><ul><li> We use OpenZeppelin's  to protect all functions that handle fund transfers (, , etc.) from re-entrancy attacks.</li><li><strong>Ownership and Role Separation:</strong> We implemented a three-address system to separate concerns and minimize risk:\n\n<ul><li> This address has the highest level of control (upgrading the contract, changing fees). It was generated offline and is never exposed to the internet. Transactions are signed on an air-gapped machine, and the raw signed transaction is then broadcast using a tool like Arbiscan's  page.</li><li> This address handles the day-to-day operations, like starting games and recording results. It can be replaced instantly by the owner if compromised, without a timelock, allowing for rapid response.</li><li> A dedicated address that can only receive platform commissions. This separation ensures that even if the hot wallet is compromised, the core contract and its funds remain secure. In the future, I'm considering moving the owner role to a 2-of-3 multisig for even greater resilience.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Timelocks for Critical Functions:</strong> Functions that could move significant funds, like , are protected by a timelock. A withdrawal is first  with a specific amount, and can only be  after a delay. This gives users full transparency and time to react if they see something they don't like.</li><li> All functions that set addresses (like changing the owner or backend wallet) prevent setting the address to , which would permanently \"brick\" the contract.</li></ul><p>Gemini helped me implement several gas optimization techniques. While modern compilers are excellent, explicit optimizations are still key:</p><ul><li> Instead of  with string messages, we use custom errors (<code>error InsufficientStake();</code>). This saves significant gas on deployment and during runtime when a check fails.</li><li><strong>Efficient State Management:</strong> We carefully designed data structures to minimize writes to storage, which is the most expensive operation on the EVM. For example, we read values into memory, perform operations, and then write the final result back to storage once.</li><li> For operations where we are certain underflow/overflow cannot occur (e.g., incrementing a counter after checking its bounds), we use  blocks to save the gas that would be spent on the default safety checks in Solidity 0.8+.</li></ul><h3>\n  \n  \n  Rigorous Testing and Verification\n</h3><p>A smart contract is only as good as its testing. We were exhaustive:</p><ul><li> We wrote 81 unit tests with Hardhat and Foundry, achieving near-100% code coverage. We also wrote fuzz tests to throw thousands of random inputs at the functions.</li><li> We used  to run 50,000 random transactions against the contract to test for broken invariants (e.g., \"the contract balance should never be less than the sum of all player deposits\"). No vulnerabilities were found.</li><li> We wrote  and  to simulate specific attack scenarios and ensure our guards worked as expected.</li><li> The code was analyzed with  and , and the bytecode was checked with .</li><li> We used  to analyze the gas cost of every function, helping us pinpoint areas for optimization.</li><li> The contracts are verified on . This provides cryptographic proof that the deployed bytecode matches the open-source code. We initially planned to use Arbiscan, but our deployment coincided with Etherscan's major transition from their V1 API to the new, unified V2 keys. This transitional period caused temporary verification issues, making  an excellent and reliable alternative.</li></ul><p>This multi-layered approach to security and testing gives me, and hopefully my users, a high degree of confidence in the contract's integrity.</p><p><strong>In the next part, I'll dive into the Backend, Frontend, and the operational infrastructure that powers the game.</strong></p><p>Now, let's get into the off-chain machinery that brings the game to life: the microservices, the security fortress I built around them, and the path forward.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Deep Dive: The Keyservice Microservice - A Digital Fortress\n</h3><p>One of my biggest concerns was handling the backend's private key. This key is \"hot\" ‚Äì it needs to be online to sign transactions like starting a game. A compromise here would be disastrous. My solution was to build a dedicated, hardened microservice with a single responsibility: .</p><p>It's a tiny Go application, but it's built like a fortress:</p><ul><li> It runs in its own Docker container and does nothing but receive data from the main backend, sign it, and return the signature. It has no other network access.</li><li> The encrypted private key JSON and its password are not in the container image or environment variables. They are mounted as Docker Secrets, which are stored in-memory on the host and are only accessible to the services they're granted to. The files on the host machine have their permissions locked down with .</li><li><strong>Quantum-Resistant Encryption:</strong> This is where my paranoia really kicked in. I didn't just encrypt the secrets; I used <strong>GPG with AES-256 and a high </strong> (<code>--s2k-mode 3 --s2k-count 65011712</code>). This is a slow, synchronous encryption method that makes brute-force attacks computationally infeasible, even against future threats like Grover's algorithm for quantum computers. This is military-grade stuff.</li><li> What if the keyservice container crashes and Docker fails to restart it? The main backend has a unique, obfuscated module containing the GPG-encrypted key, passphrase, and  file. If it can't reach the keyservice, it uses a master password to decrypt these assets , restart the container, and then securely wipes the decrypted files from disk by overwriting them with zeros. It's an automated disaster recovery plan.</li></ul><p>I considered hardware keys like a YubiKey or cloud HSMs, but rejected them. A physical key introduces a single point of failure and a potential de-anonymization vector. Cloud HSMs require trusting a third party, which I wasn't willing to do. This self-contained, heavily fortified microservice was the answer.</p><p> The next step is to move from Docker Compose to Kubernetes for more granular control and to \"harden\" the containers using  and .</p><ul><li> (Secure Computing Mode) is a Linux kernel feature that restricts the system calls a process can make. I can create a profile that allows  the specific syscalls Go needs to run the keyservice, and nothing else.</li><li> (Application Armor) confines programs to a limited set of resources. I can define a policy that prevents the keyservice from writing to unexpected disk locations or accessing unauthorized network ports.</li></ul><p>Together, these will create an even smaller attack surface, making a container breakout virtually impossible.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Deep Dive: The Backend (Go)\n</h3><p>The main backend is the game's central nervous system, written in Go for its performance and concurrency. It's logically split into modules:</p><ul><li>: Defines all the REST endpoints for the frontend. It includes protection against slow header attacks to prevent resource exhaustion.</li><li>: Handles all interaction with the smart contract. It uses versioned auto-generated Go bindings from the contract's ABI. This is also where I used  to interact with the upgradeable proxy contract, allowing the backend to seamlessly call functions on the implementation contract through the stable proxy address.</li><li>: On startup, it quickly reads past blockchain events to catch up to the current state, then switches to a slower, regular polling of new events.</li><li>: The largest and most complex module, containing the entire game state machine and lifecycle.</li><li>: Manages the WebSocket connections. To join a game, the user signs a  (a single-use random string) provided by the backend. This proves ownership of their address without a full transaction and also registers any associated referrer. The backend verifies this signature and, upon success, issues a <strong>one-time WebSocket authentication token</strong>. The frontend then uses this token to establish a secure, authenticated connection, preventing unauthorized access.</li><li>: Manages database interaction using , which provides a fantastic object-relational mapping layer and handles database schema migrations automatically. This is also where the analytics models for the conversion funnel and profit reports live.</li></ul><p> I was relentless with testing.</p><ul><li>  Most modules have , verified with .</li><li>  I used  with a suite of static analyzers like  (security), , and  to catch potential issues early.</li><li>  Database tests were not mocked. I used the  pattern, where a real PostgreSQL Docker container is spun up for the test suite and torn down afterward, ensuring tests run against a real environment.</li><li>  I heavily profiled the code for CPU usage, memory allocations (, ), and lock contentions (, ) to hunt down performance bottlenecks and race conditions.</li><li>  Critical modules were compiled with  to obfuscate the code, and all binaries were packed with  to shrink their size and make reverse-engineering a nightmare.</li><li>  Finally, the entire codebase was analyzed with  to enforce best practices and catch any remaining code smells.</li></ul><h3>\n  \n  \n  Deep Dive: The Frontend (HTML/CSS/JS)\n</h3><p>The frontend is intentionally simple: vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (transpiled from TypeScript). This wasn't a shortcut; it was a strategic choice. A simple, static site can be easily hosted on decentralized platforms like  or , further enhancing the project's censorship resistance.</p><p>Even with its simplicity, it's well-tested using Jest for unit tests (), ESLint for code quality, and Prettier for consistent formatting.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  The Community and The Road Ahead\n</h3><p>A project is nothing without a community. My growth strategy is focused on rewarding early believers.</p><ul><li> I launched a campaign on Zealy where users can complete quests to earn XP.</li><li> The first 300 community members will receive a special NFT, granting them the \"OG Member\" role in Discord and future in-game bonuses.</li><li> I'm planning to add a global leaderboard and host tournaments with real prize pools.</li></ul><p>This project has been an incredible journey. It started as a simple idea and, with the help of my AI partner, evolved into a secure, robust, and fully decentralized application. I went from a junior-level coder to a full-stack dApp creator, and I did it by focusing on the vision and letting the AI handle the complex implementation.</p><p>This is the new frontier of indie development. If you have an idea, the tools to build it are more accessible than ever.</p><p><strong>Come play a game and join the community!</strong></p><ul><li> muschairs.com</li><li> discord.gg/wnnJKjgfZW</li><li> @crow004_crow</li><li><code>npub1v0kc8fwz67k0mv539z6kaw5h25et9e2zmnnqq6z2naytaq566gwqkzz542</code></li></ul><p>My next steps are to spread the word on platforms like Reddit, connect with web3 enthusiasts, and, of course, start building my next idea.

A equipe do Go <strong>reescreveu o parser do zero</strong>, focando em tr√™s problemas principais que atormentavam o  original: , <strong>parsing sequencial ineficiente</strong>, e <strong>falta de suporte nativo para streaming</strong>.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Arquitetura otimizada para Menos Aloca√ß√µes\n</h3><p>O maior vil√£o do JSON v1 sempre foram as aloca√ß√µes desnecess√°rias. Cada vez que voc√™ fazia  em uma struct grande, o parser criava dezenas de objetos intermedi√°rios (buffers tempor√°rios, slices auxiliares, interfaces{} para cada valor).</p><p>O v2 introduz um <strong>sistema de pooling interno</strong> e  que reduz drasticamente essas aloca√ß√µes. Em vez de criar novos objetos a cada opera√ß√£o, ele mant√©m pools de estruturas reutiliz√°veis que s√£o recicladas entre chamadas.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><h3>\n  \n  \n  Parser n√£o-sequencial e streaming nativo\n</h3><p>Outra mudan√ßa fundamental: o v1 sempre processava JSON de forma , lia byte por byte, construindo a estrutura na ordem exata do documento. Isso funcionava, mas era ineficiente para JSONs grandes.</p><p>O v2 implementa  e . Para JSONs grandes, ele pode processar peda√ßos do documento simultaneamente e construir a estrutura final de forma mais eficiente. Isso √© especialmente poderoso quando voc√™ est√° lidando com arrays grandes ou objetos com muitas propriedades.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><h3>\n  \n  \n  Otimiza√ß√µes espec√≠ficas para tipos comuns\n</h3><p>O v2 tamb√©m inclui  otimizados para tipos que aparecem frequentemente em APIs modernas:</p><p> t√™m parsing especializado que evita convers√µes desnecess√°rias.  (o caso mais comum) t√™m tratamento otimizado. <strong>Slices de tipos primitivos</strong> s√£o processados em lotes quando poss√≠vel.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><h3><strong>Mensagens de erro mais √∫teis</strong></h3><p>Um b√¥nus que todo mundo vai amar: as mensagens de erro ficaram muito melhores. Em vez de \"invalid character 'x' looking for beginning of value\", agora voc√™ recebe contexto real:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Quando vale usar? Se voc√™ processa muito JSON por segundo, trabalha com streaming de dados grandes, ou simplesmente est√° cansado de debuggar mensagens de erro confusas. A nova implementa√ß√£o resolve esses tr√™s problemas de uma vez.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  GreenteaGC: Entendendo o Novo Coletor de Lixo\n</h2><p>Antes de falar do novo GC, preciso explicar por que o atual √†s vezes √© um problema. O Go usa um coletor <strong>concurrent mark-and-sweep tricolor</strong> desde a vers√£o 1.5. Parece complexo, mas a ideia √© simples: ele funciona junto com seu programa (concurrent), marca objetos que ainda est√£o sendo usados (mark), e depois varre os n√£o marcados para liberar mem√≥ria (sweep). O \"tricolor\" √© s√≥ o algoritmo usado para marcar sem quebrar refer√™ncias.</p><p>O problema? Esse processo, mesmo sendo concurrent, ainda compete por recursos de CPU e pode causar  em momentos cr√≠ticos. Pior ainda: em programas que criam muitos objetos de vida curta (tipo APIs que processam requests), o GC pode ficar numa corrida constante tentando limpar a bagun√ßa.</p><h3><strong>O Que GreenteaGC Muda na Pr√°tica</strong></h3><p>Como ativar o experimental:</p><div><pre><code>greenteagc go run main.go\n\n</code></pre></div><p>O  reimplementa partes fundamentais do coletor com foco em <strong>reduzir o overhead por objeto</strong> e <strong>diminuir o trabalho paralelo desnecess√°rio</strong>. Na pr√°tica, isso significa que ele √© mais esperto sobre quando coletar lixo e quanto CPU gastar nisso.</p><p>A grande diferen√ßa est√° na forma como ele lida com <strong>objetos pequenos e tempor√°rios</strong>. O GC atual trata todos os objetos meio que igual - um  de 10 bytes recebe o mesmo tipo de aten√ß√£o que um slice gigante. O novo coletor tem estrat√©gias diferentes baseadas no tamanho e padr√£o de uso dos objetos.</p><h3><strong>Onde Voc√™ Sente a Diferen√ßa</strong></h3><p> s√£o o caso cl√°ssico. Imagine um endpoint que recebe 10.000 requests por segundo. Cada request cria v√°rias structs tempor√°rias, slices para processar dados, maps para organizar responses.

At the Cannes Lions International Festival of Creativity 2025, AWS showcased <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/ai/generative-ai/nova/fragrance-lab/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">The Fragrance Lab</a>, an interactive and inspiring experience that demonstrates how generative AI can support the development of hyper-personalized consumer goods and accelerate advertising creative concept and campaign assets development. Following Cannes Lions 2025, The Fragrance Lab received a Gold and Silver Stevie Award from the <a href=\"https://stevieawards.com/iba/event-category-winners\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">International Business Awards</a> in the Brand &amp; Experiences category.</p><p>Built using <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/ai/generative-ai/nova/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Amazon Nova</a> in <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Amazon Bedrock</a>, The&nbsp;Fragrance Lab represents a comprehensive end-to-end application that illustrates the transformative power of generative AI in retail, consumer goods, advertising, and marketing. While our activation at Cannes Lions focused on personalized fragrance development and ad campaign creation, the underlying architecture and methodology can be adapted across diverse categories, from fashion to food and beverage, opening endless possibilities for customized customer experiences.</p><h2>Introducing The Fragrance Lab</h2><p>In this post, we explore the development of The Fragrance Lab. Our vision was to craft a unique blend of physical and digital experiences that would celebrate creativity, advertising, and consumer goods while capturing the spirit of the French Riviera. To bring this vision to life, we collaborated with <a href=\"http://wildlife.la\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Wildlife</a>, a company that is exceptional at transforming AWS generative AI services into compelling physical experiences. Wildlife was fundamental in&nbsp;brainstorming ideas that would inspire customers and showcase novel use cases that AI makes possible.</p><p>As the first step, the experience used <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/ai/generative-ai/nova/speech/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Amazon Nova Sonic</a>, a speech-to-speech model that engages in intuitive dialogues with attendees to understand their personality and preferences. Nova Sonic extends its capabilities through tool integration, allowing it to manage user traits and interface actions through specialized tools such as , , and . These tools help maintain conversation state and a consistent flow throughout the experience. The collected conversation data and trait information are then processed through a custom Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) system built with <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/ai/generative-ai/nova/understanding/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Amazon Nova Pro</a>, a highly capable multimodal model that offers our best combination of accuracy, speed, and cost. Nova Pro serves as the intelligence engine for analyzing interactions and extracting essential keywords to determine the perfect fragrance notes and composition. The application also used <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/guardrails/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Amazon Bedrock Guardrails</a>, which offers customizable safeguards and responsible AI policies to block undesirable topics‚Äîsuch as allergens or harmful content‚Äîto offer a seamless customer experience.</p><p>For example, a customer might share with Nova Sonic that they are interested in travel. Nova Pro picked up that exploring new places often ‚Äúbrings a sense of freshness and excitement,‚Äù which resulted in a fragrance that feels fresh and invigorating, featuring ‚Äúa burst of citrus or a floral breeze.‚Äù The customer might also share that they enjoy early morning walks across spring fields, which Nova Pro translates into a top note of fresh bergamot, a middle note featuring floral honey, and a base of lavender.&nbsp;The customers‚Äô inputs guide the selection of fragrance notes‚Äîfrom base, to heart, to top notes‚Äîwhich were then expertly mixed by on-site perfumers to create truly personalized scents. Perfumers were able to customize and craft hundreds of unique fragrances per day, aided by AI. A process that would normally take hours for a perfumer was accelerated to minutes, empowering both the customer and the fragrance expert.</p><p>After the personalized fragrance formula was created and sent to the perfumer queue, <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/ai/generative-ai/nova/creative/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Amazon Nova Canvas</a> generated customized marketing creative, including the fragrance name, tagline, and imagery that captured the essence of the formula. Attendees were able to further customize the campaign assets using guest inputs such as moody, beachy, or playful. The resulting fragrance image was then transformed into dynamic video content through <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/ai/generative-ai/nova/creative/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Amazon Nova Reel</a>, which customers could further customize to meet their creative vision and download to save or share. To match the Cannes Lions atmosphere, the campaign videos were generated with a French-accented female voice using <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/polly/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Amazon Polly</a>.&nbsp;The entire experience is built in Amazon Bedrock, a fully managed service to build and scale generative AI applications with AI models.</p><p>The following data flow diagram shows how multiple Amazon Nova models can be combined for a rich, cohesive, and personalized customer experience.</p><h2>Best practices for implementation</h2><p>The Fragrance Lab centers around interactions with Amazon Nova Sonic, providing users with a natural language interface to express their preferences for a custom scent. Through its tool integration capabilities, Nova Sonic orchestrates the entire experience by managing user traits and triggering appropriate workflows. These workflows seamlessly guide the experience from initial conversation to fragrance development and ultimately to campaign asset creation, driving both the visual elements and progression of the experience. The model‚Äôs ability to maintain a conversational state, while defining clear conversational flows, helps ensure a consistent and pleasant experience for every user.</p><p>A well-defined workflow and conversational assistant are pivotal in guiding these conversations to uncover the qualities that are most important to each user. And the system prompt determines the personality, style, and content of your conversational assistant.</p><div><pre><code>You are an AI assistant designed to help the user explore their personality and \nemotional landscape in the context of creating a unique fragrance. You engage in warm, \nfree-flowing, playful conversation with the user to draw out their character, \npreferences, moods, and desires. Your end goal is to derive a set of 3 to 5 personality \ntraits that best describe the user. These traits will later be used in a separate \nprocess to match appropriate fragrance ingredients. Your tone is warm, chic, and subtly \nplayful.</code></pre></div><p>Additional contextual information within the prompt also plays a key role in Amazon Nova Sonic effectively maintaining state, while defining the conversational flow helps ensure consistent, pleasant, and concise experiences for every user.</p><div><pre><code>1. **Welcoming Users**\n    Welcome the user to the application experience with a brief overview of the\n    process and ask if they are ready to continue.\n2. **Assistant Turns** \n    Ask short and unique open ended questions to the user and choose a personality trait \n    that you think would suit the user best.\n3. **Handling User Turns**\n    Acknowledge the user's answers briefly and warmly.\n    Focus on one trait per turn.\n    Call the \"addTraitTool\", \"removeTraitTool\", \"replaceTraitTool\", or \"clearTraitsTool\" \n    tools to manage traits.\n    If the user says to go back, skip, customize, or confirm/submit it means you should \n    call the \"uiActionIntentTool\" </code></pre></div><p>With direct references to our tools in the conversational flow, the user interface feels reactive and connected to the user‚Äôs input while providing opportunities for the assistant to demonstrate its expertise on this subject, which comes into the spotlight when user traits and preferences are later mapped to a set of available ingredients and raw fragrance materials.</p><p>This complex fragrance recipe development is handled by Nova Pro, using its accuracy and speed to generate consistently high-quality scents. To draw from a wealth of fragrance knowledge in real time, RAG was implemented to extend Nova Pro capabilities beyond pre-trained knowledge with access to knowledge sources that include essential scent design principles, a deep understanding of each available ingredient, their profiles and potential roles within the fragrance, and their possible connections to users‚Äô aromatic identities.</p><p>The resulting fragrances are then visualized using Nova Canvas and Nova Reel. The creative models generate original compositions that reveal the fragrance name, ingredients, and a visual identity within a high-end creative campaign asset. A set of conditioning images featuring unbranded fragrance bottles help to anchor each image (as shown in the following image).</p><div><pre><code>A high-end fragrance ad environment inspired by a [persona description]. A clear, \nunbranded perfume bottle is visually centered and tightly framed. Key ingredients [top \nnote ingredient], [middle note ingredient], [base note ingredient], and [booster \ningredient] are arranged to surround the bottle in a balanced composition, appearing \nbehind, besides, and partially in front of the base. The scene evokes [atmospheric/mood \ndescriptors] using [light/color language]. The setting should feel [stylistic direction],\nlike a [reference style (e.g., fashion editorial, lifestyle spread, luxury campaign)].</code></pre></div><p>Attendees at Cannes Lions took away a physical fragrance mixed by&nbsp;on-site perfumers. While developing hyper-personalized consumer goods might not be scalable across all use cases, brands can innovate with artificial intelligence and achieve manufacturing outcomes that weren‚Äôt previously possible. The advertising campaign concept and asset development use case is easy to implement for brands, agencies, and media networks, allowing users to iterate and optimize campaign creative quickly.&nbsp;Using Amazon Bedrock, additional features could be added like translations and sizes, depending on requirements.</p><p>You can <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_rvYYWWWnUI&amp;feature=youtu.be\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">watch a video walk through</a> of The Fragrance Lab onsite at Cannes Lions 2025, and check out the following example campaign outputs.</p><p>The Fragrance Lab demonstrates the power of Amazon Nova in Amazon Bedrock and how customers can create fully personalized consumer experiences. This use case can be replicated across various retail and consumer goods categories including skincare and cosmetics, fashion and accessories, food and beverage, home goods, and wellness products‚Äîall benefiting from natural conversation interaction, AI-powered product development, product identity, and creative marketing campaign generation.

As one of the largest protein providers in the US, Tyson Foods produces approximately 20% of the nation‚Äôs beef, pork, and chicken, which forms the foundation of its foodservice offerings.</p><p>Tyson Foodservice operates through a B2B model, selling products to distributors rather than directly to end consumers, while serving diverse foodservice operators, including restaurants, schools, healthcare facilities, and convenience stores. Until recently, Tyson had limited direct engagement with over 1 million unattended operators who purchased their products through distributors without direct company relationships. To bridge this gap, Tyson has implemented a generative AI assistant on their website, enabling them to scale sales efforts, gather customer insights, and establish direct communication channels. The company‚Äôs website now functions as a critical interface where operators can explore products, access menu trends, and discover tailored solutions for their specific foodservice segments, all enhanced by AI-driven personalization that better serves both established customers and previously unattended operators.</p><p>In this post, we explore how Tyson Foods collaborated with the <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/ai/generative-ai/innovation-center/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">AWS Generative AI Innovation Center</a> to revolutionize their customer interaction through an intuitive AI assistant <a href=\"https://www.tysonfoodservice.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">integrated into their website</a>. The AI assistant was built using <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Amazon Bedrock</a>, a fully managed service that offers a choice of high-performing foundation models (FMs) from leading AI companies like AI21 Labs, Anthropic, Cohere, Meta, Mistral AI, Stability AI, and Amazon through a single API, along with a broad set of capabilities to build generative AI applications with security, privacy, and responsible AI.</p><p>In this section, we describe the overall architecture of the solution. The workflow includes the following high-level steps:</p><ol><li>The user uses the AI assistant interface to ask questions in natural language. The query is processed by the agent node using <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/claude/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Anthropic‚Äôs Claude 3.5 Sonnet</a> on Amazon Bedrock. Depending on the subject of the query, the agent might orchestrate multiple agents to return relevant information to the user. The application is deployed using a similar architecture to the semantic search component with the addition of an <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/rds/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Amazon Relational Database Service</a> (Amazon RDS) database cluster to persist the user high-value actions for analytics purposes.</li><li>Products, recipes, ingredients and other relevant data are available from external sources in JSON format. These are processed using Amazon Bedrock and the Amazon Titan Text Embeddings model to create semantic search embeddings. Then these are ingested into OpenSearch Serverless. The ingestion process run in a different ECS cluster using Fargate as the capacity provider.</li></ol><p>The following diagram illustrates this architecture.</p><p>In the following sections, we discuss the solution‚Äôs key components and benefits in more detail.</p><p>The earlier iteration of search on the Tyson Foodservice website relied on keyword-based search. Traditional keyword-based search on CPG websites like Tyson Foodservice often falters when customers search for products using industry terminology that varies from official catalog descriptions. Chefs searching for ‚Äúpulled chicken‚Äù might miss relevant products labeled as ‚Äúshredded chicken,‚Äù or those looking for ‚Äúwings‚Äù might not see results for ‚Äúparty wings‚Äù or ‚Äúdrummettes.‚Äù This disconnect frustrates food service professionals who need specific ingredients under tight deadlines and ultimately drives them to competitors where they can more quickly find what they need, resulting in lost revenue opportunities for Tyson. Semantic search transforms this experience by understanding the conceptual relationships between culinary terms, preparation methods, and product applications. A chef searching for ‚Äúbuffalo-style appetizers‚Äù would receive results for wings, boneless bites, and similar products regardless of exact keyword matches. By recognizing menu trends, cooking techniques, and professional kitchen terminology, semantic search helps foodservice operators quickly find the Tyson products that meet their exact operational needs, even when using language that differs from catalog descriptions.</p><p>Tyson Foodservice implemented their semantic search capability using OpenSearch Serverless, a fully managed service that minimized the operational complexity of maintaining search infrastructure. This solution automatically scales compute and storage resources to match query volume and product catalog size without requiring dedicated administrative overhead. The serverless architecture helped Tyson rapidly deploy advanced natural language processing capabilities across their entire product database while maintaining cost-efficiency, because they only pay for the resources they actually use. With OpenSearch Serverless, Tyson incorporated vector embeddings and powerful query capabilities that understand foodservice terminology variations, preparation methods, and culinary applications, transforming how operators discover products that meet their specific needs even when their search terms don‚Äôt exactly match catalog descriptions.</p><p>For indexing Tyson‚Äôs diverse content library of products, recipes, and articles, we implemented a preprocessing workflow that transforms raw metadata into optimized semantic search queries. We used large language models (LLMs) to analyze and extract only the most relevant elements from each content piece, creating meaningful search strings specifically designed for semantic indexing. This approach made sure that purely presentational website copy and non-essential informational text were filtered out, and search-critical elements like culinary applications, preparation methods, and ingredient specifications received proper emphasis in the index. By curating what content gets indexed rather than including everything verbatim, we dramatically improved search relevance while reducing index bloat, so OpenSearch Serverless delivered more precise results that truly match the intent behind chef and operator queries. For indexing the text as semantic vectors, we used Amazon Titan Text Embeddings V2 on Amazon Bedrock.</p><p>The following example prompt illustrates the transformation using only the title, description, and reasons to buy metadata. This generic strategy can be customized according to the customer‚Äôs specific needs.</p><div><pre><code>SEARCH_STRING_PROMPT = \"\"\" Given a product title, description, and reasons to\nbuy, create a single, concise search string suitable for indexing in a vector\ndatabase. This string should focus on distinguishing features, assuming all\nproducts are for foodservice operators unless explicitly stated otherwise.\nEnclose the generated search string within &lt;search_string&gt; XML tags. \n\nFollow these guidelines:\n1. Start with the brand name and product line (if applicable).\n2. Include the main product type and specific identifying features.\n3. List concrete attributes such as preparation state, packaging, or quantity.\n4. Mention specific varieties or assortments included in the product.\n5. Incorporate key points from the reasons to buy, focusing on unique and\n   specific selling points.\n6. Avoid generic terms or those common to all products in the category (e.g.,\n   \"food service\", \"restaurant\", \"operator\").\n7. Omit clich√© marketing terms (e.g., \"versatile\", \"high-quality\", \"innovative\")\n   unless they have a specific, demonstrable meaning in the context of the\n   product.\n8.

It also defines the agentic behavior by using the tool calling capability: whenever serving the user‚Äôs request requires calling a tool, the agent node issues a tool request.</li><li>‚Äì This node implements a generic tool executor that connects to various tools. Whenever a tool call is issued by the agent node, this node handles the execution of the tool call. The tool calling node executes the tools, which are defined as Python functions, and returns the results to the agent node to be transformed or summarized and presented to the user. LangGraph provides a generic implementation of the <a href=\"https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/how-tos/tool-calling/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">ToolNode</a> that can also be extended to implement additional functionality.</li><li>‚Äì Tools are implemented as simple programmatic functions that take inputs and return outputs. These tools augment the capabilities of LLMs by performing functions like retrieving data or submitting feedback. The tools are stateless and agnostic to the current conversation between the user and agent. The LLM agent extracts the input parameters required to execute these tools. These tools in our implementation are a thin wrapper around the services and database layer that implement the actual functionality.</li></ul><p>The following system prompt provides a general guidance for implementing the agent node:</p><pre><code>import date\n\nAGENT_SYSTEM_PROMPT = \"\"\"\n# Tyson Foodservice (TFS) Customer Support Assistant\n\n## Core Role and Purpose\nYou are a helpful customer support assistant for Tyson Foodservice a.k.a TFS\nhosted on their https://www.tysonfoodservice.com/ website.  You will be helpful\nand answer the customers questions. The customers are mainly interested in\nlearning about the products for their specific needs.\nRefrain from engaging in any conversation unrelated to tyson food search of\nproducts, recipes or distributors. If the user asks any unrelated questions the\npolitely decline and mention your purpose. Do not provide and additional\ninformation or advice.\n \nYour job is to stay factual and only provide relevant information from the\ncurrent context or retrieved using the tools. Do not offer your own suggestions.\nCustomers are looking for concrete information that is available in the Tyson\nFoodservice database.\n\n## About Tyson Foodservice\nTyson Foods is a major American multinational corporation and one of the world's\nlargest processors and marketers of chicken, beef, and pork.\n\n### Distributors\nTyson foods mainly sells their products through distributors and does not sell\nthem directly. Each distributor is identified by a unique identifier named\ndistributor_id which is used as parameters for the tools, do not use the\ndistributor name as query parameter.\n\n### Foodservice Operators\nFoodservice Operators, or simply Operators, are Tyson Foods' primary customers.\nThese encompass diverse businesses in the foodservice sector, each with unique\nneeds. Understanding the distinct personas of various Operator types is crucial\nfor Tyson Foods to:\n- Tailor product offerings effectively\n- Develop targeted marketing strategies\n- Create relevant recipe suggestions\n- Address specific operational challenges\nBy analyzing different Operator segments (e.g., quick-service restaurants, fine\ndining, educational institutions, healthcare facilities), Tyson Foods can\ncustomize its products, offer innovative menu solutions, and provide value-added\nservices. This approach positions Tyson Foods as a strategic partner, driving\ngrowth and maintaining competitiveness in the foodservice industry.\n\n## Using Tools\nYou will be provide a variety of tools to perform your job, use them wisely and\nask the customer for relevant information that they have not provided. E.g. if\nthe search tool requires persona and the customer has not provided it then ask\nthe customer.\n- Do not explicitly declare the tools to the users as the users are not aware of\n  the internal workings of the tools.\n- Do not try to intrepret the results of the search tool and show them as it is\n  to the user.\n- Operators may have their preferred distributor they buy from so let them\n  confirm or select their distributor before checking for availability of\n  products.\n- Customers might sometimes search for things that are not available in tyson\n  food catalog. If the search did not produce any results then just inform the\n  user and do not suggest any external sources.\n- When trying to determine the parameters for a tool, do not infer them from\n  other parameters. E.g. do not infer the User's name from their email.\n  Explicitly ask for the name.\n- If the users complain or praise the chatbot then you can ask for their\n  feedback in the chatbot and use the `submit_feedback` tool to submit the\n  feedback. Ask the user to provide the relevant contact information.\n\n## Product, Recipes, and Articles Search\nSearch functionality is a critical tool on Tyson's website, allowing users to\nfind products, recipes, and articles. It enables searches across three main\nentity types:\n- **Products**: The core offerings of Tyson Foods. These are identified by a\n  unique GTIN (Global Trade Item Number).\n- **Recipes**: Culinary ideas provided by Tyson Foods to encourage product use.\n  Each recipe incorporates one or more Tyson products.\n- **Articles**: Informative content on various topics, created by Tyson Foods\n  for their customers.\n- Do not provide any items or suggestions outside of the ones that are found\n  through search.\n- When the user asks to for details or a product or compare two or more\n  products, retrieve the details of the products first using the tools to get\n  product details.\n- While users of the site are mainly looking for products, they might also be\ninterested in recipes and articles so it's important to not omit them when\ndisplaying the search results.\n\n### User Profile or Persona\nIn order to serve the user's better, the search tool can accept the user's\npersona as an input. User profile or persona is a concise description of the\ntype of role that a user performs in the foodservice industry. A few examples\nof persona are\n- Restaurant owners looking to optimize costs\n- Chef looking for unique ingredients\n- K12 operators looking for healthy menu items\nThey can also be simple roles if the user has not provided any additional\ninformation. Examples are\n- Restaurant owner\n- Chef\n- Hotel Manager\nThe user persona should not include the search query that they are using for\nfinding products E.g. these are not good personas\n- Restaurant owner looking for chicken nuggets\nThe above is not a good persona because it includes the product\n\n### Search query string\nSearch queries should be simple and specific to the products or recipes and\nshould not contain the operator information\nHere are some examples: \n- Instead of \"healthy chicken wings for K12\" use \"chicken wings\"\n- Instead of \"mexican beef patties for Deli operation\" use \"mexican beef\n  patties\"\n\n### Product Results Display \nWhen listing the product results, always display them in the following format as\na numbered list. This will be displayed in the UI using markdown. \n1. **Title**\n- GTIN\n- description - This is a brief description\n- [Product Page](Product url link)\n\n### Recipes Results Display\nWhen displaying recipes. Display the following\n1. **Title**\n- description - This is a brief description\n- [Recipe Page](Recipe url link)\n\n## Contact or provide feedback\n- If the users want to reach out to Tyson foods team then they can use the form\n  using this link [Contact\n  Us](https://www.tysonfoodservice.com/connect/contact-us) \n- Users can submit their feedback using the chatbot using tools. When submitting\n  feedback to Tyson extract user's message verbatim and do not rephrase it.\n\n## How to buy\nIf the user wants to buy a product then they have two options. \n1. through distributor (preferred option)\n2. reaching out to tysons sales representative by filling a form\nIf the user has not already indicated their preference then present these two\noptions. \nWhen the user asks for ordering information you do not need to retrieve all the\nproduct details again, only specify the title of the product and be concise with\nthe details.\n\n### Order through distributor\nIf they user is interested in buying through a distributor then let them\nidentify their preferred distributor and then for a specific product or products\nthey have identified provide the ordering link obtained through the user of\nappropriate tool. Also help them check if a product is available with their\ndistributor.\n\n### Find a tyson Sales Rep\nIf the user is not interested in a purchasing through a distributor then direct\nthem to submit a form through this link which will submit their information to a\nsales team and someone will reach out to them. Here is the link to the form\n<a href=\"https://www.tysonfoodservice.com/connect/find-a-sales-rep\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://www.tysonfoodservice.com/connect/find-a-sales-rep</a> \n\nCurrent date (YYYY-MM-DD): \"\"\" + date.today().strftime(\"%Y-%m-%d\") + \"\\n\" \n</code></pre><h2>Capturing high-value actions: Turning conversations into insights</h2><p>In designing Tyson Foodservice‚Äôs AI assistant, we implemented an innovative solution for capturing high-value actions that transforms customer interactions into strategic business intelligence. This capability provides deeper contextual understanding of customer interests and needs than traditional web analytics. Whereas conventional analytics tools track user behavior through page views, clicks, and time-on-site metrics, our solution uses the rich conversational data generated through natural dialogue. This provides Tyson with unprecedented visibility into customer interests, pain points, and purchase intentions.</p><p>The system identifies and logs specific high-value interactions whenever users request detailed product information, inquire about specific product categories, ask about preparation methods or recipe ideas, seek distributor information in their region, or express interest in bulk purchasing or promotions. This approach creates a powerful feedback loop for Tyson Foodservice. As customers naturally express their needs and interests through conversation, the system captures these signals in an aggregate, privacy-respecting manner. Tyson can use these insights to identify trending product categories and potential gaps in their portfolio, understand regional variations in customer interests, recognize seasonal patterns in product inquiries, refine marketing strategies based on direct customer language, and improve inventory management through better demand forecasting. The technical implementation uses the tool-calling capabilities of Anthropic‚Äôs Claude 3.5 Sonnet in a straightforward but effective way. Rather than analyzing chat logs after the fact, we integrated the capture mechanism directly into the AI assistant‚Äôs operational workflow through LangGraph, allowing for real-time insight collection during customer interactions. When the LLM invokes certain tools to retrieve information requested by users, these tool calls simultaneously trigger the capture of high-value action data. We‚Äôve designed a configurable system where specific tools are designated as high-value action triggers that record meaningful interactions while fulfilling the user‚Äôs immediate request.This dual-purpose approach makes sure that valuable business intelligence is gathered as a natural byproduct of providing excellent customer service, without requiring additional processing or analysis steps. The system includes configurable parameters that allow Tyson to adjust which user intents and actions qualify as high value based on evolving business priorities. By transforming every customer conversation into structured, actionable data, Tyson Foodservice can now measure customer interest with unprecedented precision while delivering a superior search experience that feels natural to users.</p><p>In this post, we demonstrated a powerful approach to implementing natural conversational AI assistants that seamlessly integrate with existing website functionalities and provide intuitive language interactions for users. By using Amazon Bedrock FMs and OpenSearch Serverless, businesses can quickly expose their website‚Äôs capabilities through conversation rather than complex interfaces. The high-value action capture mechanism further enhances this solution by gathering valuable customer insights directly from natural interactions, creating a rich source of business intelligence without additional user friction. This framework provides a flexible blueprint for implementing AI-powered assistants across retail and CPG websites. Organizations can adapt this approach to their specific needs, such as product discovery, customer support, or personalized recommendations. The combination of semantic search with conversational AI creates experiences that understand user intent while maintaining the context necessary for natural dialogue.</p><p>If you‚Äôre interested in building a similar AI assistant that orchestrates multiple tools, you can get started with <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/agents/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Amazon Bedrock Agents</a>, a fully managed AWS solution designed specifically for this purpose.

Organizations now actively deploy ML models for precise sales forecasting, customer segmentation, and churn prediction. While traditional ML continues to transform business processes, <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/generative-ai/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">generative AI</a> has emerged as a revolutionary force, introducing powerful and accessible tools that reshape customer experiences.</p><p>Despite generative AI‚Äôs prominence, traditional ML solutions remain essential for specific predictive tasks. Sales forecasting, which depends on historical data and trend analysis, is most effectively handled by established ML algorithms including random forests, gradient boosting machines (like XGBoost), autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) models, long short-term memory (LSTM) networks, and linear regression techniques. Traditional ML models, such as K-means and hierarchical clustering, also excel in customer segmentation and churn prediction applications. Although generative AI demonstrates exceptional capabilities in creative tasks such as content generation, product design, and personalized customer interactions, traditional ML models maintain their superiority in data-driven predictions. Organizations can achieve optimal results by using both approaches together, creating solutions that deliver accurate predictions while maintaining cost efficiency.</p><p>To achieve this, we showcase in this post how customers can expand AI agents‚Äô capabilities by integrating predictive ML models and <a href=\"https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Model Context Protocol (MCP)</a>‚Äîan open protocol that standardizes how applications provide context to <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/large-language-model/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">large language models</a> (LLMs)‚Äîon <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker-ai\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Amazon SageMaker AI</a>. We demonstrate a comprehensive workflow that enables AI agents to make data-driven business decisions by using ML models hosted SageMaker.

An AI agent is an LLM-powered application that uses an LLM as its core ‚Äúbrain‚Äù to autonomously observe its environment, plan actions, and execute tasks with minimal human input. It integrates reasoning, memory, and tool use to perform complex, multistep problem-solving by dynamically creating and revising plans, interacting with external systems, and learning from past interactions to optimize outcomes over time. This enables AI agents to go beyond simple text generation, acting as independent entities capable of decision-making and goal-directed actions in diverse real-world and enterprise scenarios.For this solution, the AI agent is developed using the Strands Agents SDK, which allows for rapid development from simple assistants to complex workflows. Predictive ML models are hosted on Amazon SageMaker AI and will be used as tools by the AI agent. This can happen in two ways: agents can directly invoke SageMaker endpoints for more direct access to model inference capabilities or use the MCP protocol to facilitate the interaction between AI agents and the ML models. Both options are valid: direct tool invocation doesn‚Äôt require additional infrastructure by embedding the tool calling directly in the agent code itself, whereas MCP enables dynamic discovery of the tools and decoupling of agent and tool execution through the introduction of an additional architectural component, the MCP server itself. For scalable and secure implementation of the tool calling logic, we recommend the MCP approach. Although we‚Äôre recommending MCP, we discuss and implement the direct endpoint access as well, to give readers the freedom to choose the approach that they prefer.</p><p>Amazon SageMaker AI offers two methods to host multiple models behind a single endpoint: inference components and multi-model endpoints. This consolidated hosting approach enables efficient deployment of multiple models in one environment, which optimizes computing resources and minimizes response times for model predictions. For demonstration purposes, this post deploys only one model on one endpoint. If you want to learn more about inference components, refer to the Amazon SageMaker AI documentation <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/realtime-endpoints-deploy-models.html#deployed-shared-utilization\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Shared resource utilization with multiple models</a>. To learn more about multi-model endpoints, refer to the Amazon SageMaker AI documentation <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/multi-model-endpoints.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Multi-model endpoints</a>.</p><p>In this post, we define a workflow for empowering AI agents to make data-driven business decisions by invoking predictive ML models using Amazon SageMaker AI. The process begins with a user interacting through an interface, such as a chat-based assistant or application. This input is managed by an AI agent developed using the open source Strands Agents SDK. Strands Agents adopts a model-driven approach, which means developers define agents with only a prompt and a list of tools, facilitating rapid development from simple assistants to complex autonomous workflows.</p><p>When the agent is prompted with a request that requires a prediction (for example, ‚Äúwhat will be the sales for H2 2025?‚Äù), the LLM powering the agent decided to interact with the Amazon SageMaker AI endpoint hosting the ML model. This can happen in two ways: directly using the endpoint as a custom tool of the Strands Agents Python SDK or by calling the tool through MCP. With MCP, the client application can discover the tools exposed by the MCP server, obtain the list of required parameters, and format the request to the Amazon SageMaker inference endpoint. Alternatively, agents can directly invoke SageMaker endpoints using tool annotations (such as ), bypassing the MCP server for more direct access to model inference capabilities.</p><p>Finally, the prediction generated by the SageMaker hosted model is routed back through the agent and ultimately delivered to the user interface, enabling real-time, intelligent responses.</p><p>The following diagram illustrates this process. The complete code for this solution is available on <a href=\"https://github.com/dgallitelli/generative-ai-on-amazon-sagemaker/tree/main/workshops/diy-agents-with-sagemaker-and-bedrock/99-use-cases/sagemaker-endpoint-as-tool\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">GitHub</a>.</p><p>To get started with this solution, make sure you have:</p><p>In this solution, we implement a complete workflow that demonstrates how to use ML models deployed on Amazon SageMaker AI as specialized tools for AI agents. This approach enables agents to access and use ML capabilities for enhanced decision-making without requiring deep ML expertise. We play the role of a data scientist tasked with building an agent that can predict demand for one product. To achieve this, we train a time-series forecasting model, deploy it, and expose it to an AI agent.</p><p>The first phase involves training a model using Amazon SageMaker AI. This begins with preparing training data by generating synthetic time series data that incorporates trend, seasonality, and noise components to simulate realistic demand patterns. Following data preparation, feature engineering is performed to extract relevant features from the time series data, including temporal features such as day of week, month, and quarter to effectively capture seasonality patterns. In our example, we train an XGBoost model using the XGBoost container available as 1P container in Amazon SageMaker AI to create a regression model capable of predicting future demand values based on historical patterns. Although we use XGBoost for this example because it‚Äôs a well-known model used in many use cases, you can use your preferred container and model, according to the problem you‚Äôre trying to solve. For the sake of this post, we won‚Äôt detail an end-to-end example of training a model using XGBoost. To learn more about this, we suggest checking out the documentation <a href=\"https://sagemaker.readthedocs.io/en/stable/frameworks/xgboost/using_xgboost.html#use-xgboost-with-the-sagemaker-python-sdk\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Use XGBoost with the SageMaker Python SDK</a>. Use the following code:</p><div><pre><code>from&nbsp;sagemaker.xgboost.estimator import&nbsp;XGBoost\n\nxgb_estimator = XGBoost(...)\nxgb_estimator.fit({'train': train_s3_path, 'validation': val_s3_path})</code></pre></div><p>Then, the trained model is packaged and deployed to a SageMaker AI endpoint, making it accessible for real-time inference through API calls:</p><div><pre><code>predictor = xgb_estimator.deploy(\n &nbsp; &nbsp;initial_instance_count=1,\n &nbsp; &nbsp;instance_type=instance_type,\n &nbsp; &nbsp;serializer=JSONSerializer(),\n &nbsp; &nbsp;deserializer=JSONDeserializer()\n)</code></pre></div><p>After the model is deployed and ready for inferences, you need to learn how to invoke the endpoint. To invoke the endpoint, write a function like this:</p><div><pre><code>ENDPOINT_NAME = \"serverless-xgboost\"\nREGION = boto3.session.Session().region_name\n\ndef invoke_endpoint(payload: list):\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;\"\"\"\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Use the model deployed on the Amazon SageMaker AI endpoint to generate predictions.\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Args:\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;payload: a list of lists containing the inputs to generate predictions from\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Returns:\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;predictions: an NumPy array of predictions\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;\"\"\"\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;sagemaker_runtime = boto3.client(\"sagemaker-runtime\", region_name=REGION)\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;response = sagemaker_runtime.invoke_endpoint(\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;EndpointName=ENDPOINT_NAME,\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Body=json.dumps(payload),\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;ContentType=\"application/json\",\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Accept=\"application/json\"\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;)\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;predictions = json.loads(response['Body'].read().decode(\"utf-8\"))\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;return np.array(predictions)</code></pre></div><p>Note that the function  has been written with proper docstring. This is key to making sure that it can be used as a tool by LLMs because the description is what allows them to choose the right tool for the right task. YOu can turn this function into a Strands Agents tool thanks to the  decorator:</p><div><pre><code>from&nbsp;strands import&nbsp;tool\n\n@tool()\ndef&nbsp;invoke_endpoint(payload: list):\n&nbsp; &nbsp; ....</code></pre></div><p>And to use it, pass it to a Strands agent:</p><div><pre><code>from&nbsp;strands import&nbsp;Agent\n\nagent = Agent(\n&nbsp; &nbsp; model=\"us.amazon.nova-pro-v1:0\", \n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;tools=[generate_prediction_with_sagemaker]\n)\n\nagent(\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;\"Invoke the endpoint with this input:\\n\\n\"\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;f\"&lt;input&gt;{test_sample}&lt;/input&gt;\\n\\n\"\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;\"Provide the output in JSON format {'predictions':&lt;predictions&gt;}\"\n)</code></pre></div><p>As you run this code, you can confirm the output from the agent, which correctly identifies the need to call the tool and executes the function calling loop:</p><div><pre><code>&lt;thinking&gt; To fulfill the User's request, I need to invoke the Amazon SageMaker \nendpoint with the provided input data. The input is a list of lists, which is the \nrequired format for the 'generate_prediction_with_sagemaker' tool. I will use this \ntool to get the predictions. &lt;/thinking&gt; \n\nTool #1: generate_prediction_with_sagemaker The predictions from the Amazon SageMaker\nendpoint are as follows: \n```json {&nbsp; \"predictions\": [89.8525238, 52.51485062, 58.35247421, 62.79786301, 85.51475525] } ```</code></pre></div><p>As the agent receives the prediction result from the endpoint tool, it can then use this as an input for other processes. For example, the agent could write the code to create a plot based on these predictions and show it to the user in the conversational UX.

This allows for the decoupling of agent and tool logic and an improved security pattern because the MCP server will be the one with the permission to invoke the endpoint. To achieve this, implement an MCP server using the <a href=\"https://gofastmcp.com/getting-started/welcome?gad_source=1&amp;gad_campaignid=22521620347&amp;gbraid=0AAAAACeCpg_Hi0k3Ql_OeCU0q96xoSh9M&amp;gclid=CjwKCAjwprjDBhBTEiwA1m1d0n-o5wCNkDPbAbxBPgTP5-ui-wwO_LZaNqvVmUKj-1QsJ9SjpEBh-xoCJnwQAvD_BwE\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">FastMCP</a> framework that wraps the SageMaker endpoint and exposes it as a tool with a well-defined interface. A tool schema must be specified that clearly defines the input parameters and return values for the tool, facilitating straightforward understanding and usage by AI agents. Writing the proper docstring when defining the function achieves this. Additionally, the server must be configured to handle authentication securely, allowing it to access the SageMaker endpoint using AWS credentials or AWS roles. In this example, we run the server on the same compute as the agent and use  as communication protocol. For production workloads, we recommend running the MCP server on its own AWS compute and using transport protocols based on HTTPS (for example, Streamable HTTP). If you want to learn how to deploy MCP servers in a serverless fashion, refer to <a href=\"https://github.com/awslabs/run-model-context-protocol-servers-with-aws-lambda\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">this official AWS GitHub repository</a>. Here‚Äôs an example MCP server:</p><div><pre><code>from&nbsp;mcp.server.fastmcp import&nbsp;FastMCP\n\nmcp =&nbsp;FastMCP(\"SageMaker App\")\nENDPOINT_NAME =&nbsp;os.environ[\"SAGEMAKER_ENDPOINT_NAME\"]\n\n@mcp.tool()\nasync&nbsp;def&nbsp;invoke_endpoint(payload: list):\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;\"\"\"&nbsp;Use the model ... \"\"\"\n&nbsp; &nbsp; [...]\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\nif&nbsp;__name__&nbsp;==&nbsp;\"__main__\":\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;mcp.run(=\"stdio\")</code></pre></div><p>Finally, integrate the ML model with the agent framework. This begins with setting up Strands Agents to establish communication with the MCP server and incorporate the ML model as a tool. A comprehensive workflow must be created to determine when and how the agent should use the ML model to enhance its capabilities. The implementation includes programming decision logic that enables the agent to make informed decisions based on the predictions received from the ML model. The phase concludes with testing and evaluation, where the end-to-end workflow is validated by having the agent generate predictions for test scenarios and take appropriate actions based on those predictions.</p><div><pre><code>from&nbsp;mcp import&nbsp;StdioServerParameters\nfrom&nbsp;mcp.client.stdio import&nbsp;stdio_client\nfrom&nbsp;strands.tools.mcp import&nbsp;MCPClient\n\n# Create server parameters for stdio connection\nserver_params = StdioServerParameters(\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;command=\"python3\", &nbsp;# Executable\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;args=[\"server.py\"], &nbsp;# Optional command line arguments\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;env={\"SAGEMAKER_ENDPOINT_NAME\":&nbsp;\"&lt;your-endpoint-name&gt;\"}\n)\n\n# Create an agent with MCP tools\nwith stdio_mcp_client:\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;# Get the tools from the MCP server\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;tools = stdio_mcp_client.list_tools_sync()\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;# Create an agent with these tools\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;agent = Agent(model=\"us.amazon.nova-pro-v1:0\", tools=tools)\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;# Invoke the agent\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;agent(\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"Invoke the endpoint with this input:\\n\\n\"\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;f\"&lt;input&gt;{test_sample}&lt;/input&gt;\\n\\n\"\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"Provide the output in JSON format {'predictions':&lt;predictions&gt;}\"\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;)</code></pre></div><div><pre><code># SageMaker Python SDK\npredictor.delete_model()\npredictor.delete_endpoint()\n\n# Alternatively, boto3\nsagemaker_runtime.delete_endpoint(EndpointName=endpoint_name)</code></pre></div><p>In this post, we demonstrated how to enhance AI agents‚Äô capabilities by integrating predictive ML models using Amazon SageMaker AI and the MCP. By using the open source Strands Agents SDK and the flexible deployment options of SageMaker AI, developers can create sophisticated AI applications that combine conversational AI with powerful predictive analytics capabilities. The solution we presented offers two integration paths: direct endpoint access through tool annotations and MCP-based integration, giving developers the flexibility to choose the most suitable approach for their specific use cases. Whether you‚Äôre building customer service chat assistants that need predictive capabilities or developing complex autonomous workflows, this architecture provides a secure, scalable, and modular foundation for your AI applications.

My requirements were simple - secure local storage, clean UI, and encryption I could trust. What made this interesting wasn't the project itself, but how I built it.</p><p>I have a background in distributed systems: REST APIs, event-driven architecture, Kafka, the usual enterprise stack. Building a multi-platform desktop application was entirely new territory. I'd been planning this experiment for a while: what would it be like to build a project entirely using AI-assisted programming?</p><p>Before we continue, I should disclose some bias. I'm somewhat of an AI skeptic, so I definitely had preconceived ideas going into this, particularly around code quality, security, and scalability. I also assumed the process would be painful and less enjoyable than traditional programming (spoiler alert: I was completely wrong about this one).</p><p>Next came choosing the language. I've always been interested in Go: it seems like a nice blend of C++, Python, and JavaScript, all languages I enjoy. Since I'd never touched Go or Fyne (Go's UI framework), this seemed like the perfect way to put these AI models through their paces.</p><p>Over the course of a week, I experimented with three different models: GPT-4, Claude Sonnet, and Gemini 2.5 Pro, switching between them to see how each handled different aspects of the development process.</p><p>What I discovered challenged most of my assumptions about AI-assisted coding. The fastest model wasn't the most productive. The highest-quality code generator wasn't the most helpful. And the most counterintuitive finding of all: sometimes being \"too good\" at coding assistance actually made the development experience worse.</p><p>If you're considering integrating AI tools into your development workflow, or if you're curious about the practical realities behind the productivity hype, here's what a week of intensive AI-assisted coding actually taught me.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  The Productivity Illusion: Fast Start, Slow Finish\n</h2><p>The most striking pattern in my week of AI coding wasn't what I expected. My productivity started incredibly high and steadily declined as the project progressed. On day one, I had a working password manager with encryption, a basic UI, and core functionality. By day four, I was stuck in refactoring hell, generating thousands of lines of code changes while adding zero new features.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  The Setup Phase: Where AI Shines\n</h3><p>AI assistance was genuinely transformative during the initial setup. Within hours, I had:</p><ul><li>A properly structured Go project with modules and dependencies</li><li>A working Fyne UI with multiple screens\n</li><li>Basic encryption and decryption functionality</li><li>File I/O for local storage</li><li>Even a custom test framework (more on that later)</li></ul><p>This was exactly the productivity boost everyone talks about. Tasks that would have taken me days of research and documentation reading were completed in minutes. For someone completely new to Go and Fyne, this felt magical.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  The Architecture Reality Check\n</h3><p>But then reality hit. The code that got me started quickly didn't fit what I actually needed. The AI had made architectural decisions based on getting something working, not on building something maintainable. What followed was an endless cycle of refactoring:</p><ul><li>The initial encryption implementation was too simple for real security needs</li><li>The UI structure couldn't handle the complexity I wanted to add</li><li>There was no dependency injection, making testing nearly impossible\n</li><li>Error handling was inconsistent across the codebase</li><li>The file structure didn't make sense for the features I planned</li></ul><p>Here's where things got really problematic. Each refactoring session with AI would generate hundreds of lines of code changes. My commit history started looking incredibly productive - lots of activity, lots of lines added. But I wasn't adding any new features. I was essentially paying interest on the technical debt from the AI's initial \"quick wins.\"</p><p>The breaking point came when I hit my rate limit on GitHub Copilot after just four days of use (on a paid plan). Suddenly, I was stuck mid-refactor with partially broken code and no AI assistance. I had to manually dig myself out of the mess, which gave me a clear perspective on what was actually necessary versus what the AI thought needed to be \"improved.\"</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Traditional Coding: The Unexpected Comeback\n</h3><p>On my final day, I switched approaches entirely. I did all the coding myself and used GPT-4 purely as a reference tool: essentially treating it like an enhanced Google for Go-specific questions. The results were surprising:</p><ul><li>Higher actual delivery rate despite generating less code</li><li>No rework cycles or debugging sessions</li><li>Better understanding of what I was building</li><li>Code that fit my actual requirements, not the AI's assumptions</li></ul><p><strong>High initial productivity from AI can be an illusion if it comes at the cost of architecture and maintainability.</strong></p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Model Behaviors: The Counterintuitive Preferences\n</h2><p>Testing three different AI models revealed some unexpected preferences that go against conventional wisdom about \"better\" AI being more helpful.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  GPT-4: Fast, Wrong, and Strangely Effective\n</h3><p>GPT-4 was objectively the worst at generating correct code. It made frequent mistakes, missed edge cases, and often gave me solutions that needed significant debugging. But here's the counterintuitive part: <strong>I enjoyed working with it the most.</strong></p><p>Why? Because it was fast, and its mistakes kept me engaged with the code. Every response required my review and often my correction. This forced me to actually read and understand what was being generated, learn Go patterns by fixing the AI's errors, stay involved in architectural decisions, and catch problems early rather than discovering them later.</p><p>The friction was actually valuable. It prevented me from falling into passive \"vibe coding\" where I just accepted whatever the AI produced.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Claude and Gemini: Too Good for My Own Good\n</h3><p>Claude Sonnet and Gemini 2.5 Pro produced much higher quality code with fewer errors. They were more thoughtful about edge cases, better at following Go idioms, and generally more reliable. Logically, these should have been better development partners.</p><p>Instead, I found myself becoming disengaged. The code was good enough that I stopped reading it carefully. I trusted their outputs and moved on to the next task. This led to less learning about Go and Fyne, architectural decisions I didn't fully understand, code that worked but didn't match my mental model, and a growing disconnect between what I wanted and what I had.</p><p><strong>Sometimes \"better\" AI assistance can make you a worse developer by reducing your engagement with the code.</strong></p><p>One practical lesson: stick to one model per project phase. I tried switching between models for different tasks, but each AI has its own \"style\" and preferences. Claude would refactor code that Gemini had written, undoing architectural decisions and imposing its own patterns. Gemini would then \"fix\" Claude's work in the next iteration. </p><p>It became a digital turf war where I was caught in the middle, trying to maintain consistency across competing AI opinions.</p><p>Gemini clearly produced the best Go code quality, which makes sense - Google created Go. This suggests a broader principle: consider who built or maintains your technology stack when choosing AI tools. The company with the deepest expertise in a language will likely have trained their models better on it.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  The Limits of Autonomy: Why Agentic Workflows Failed\n</h2><p>The current trend in AI coding tools is toward more autonomy - agents that can make large changes across multiple files, handle complex refactoring, and work independently on substantial tasks. My experience suggests this is moving in the wrong direction.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Small Changes vs. Large Autonomy\n</h3><p>Every time I allowed an AI to make large, autonomous changes, the results were disappointing:</p><ul><li>New bugs introduced during refactoring</li><li>Architectural inconsistencies across files\n</li><li>Changes that broke existing functionality</li><li>Code that was harder to review and understand</li></ul><p>In contrast, small, specific requests produced much better results:</p><ul><li>‚ùå \"Improve the security of this code\" (led to massive rewrites)</li><li>‚úÖ \"Add input validation to this password field\" (focused, reviewable change)</li></ul><p>AI models have a tendency toward \"helpful\" scope creep. Ask for dependency injection, and they'll also rename your methods. Request a simple refactor, and they'll reorganize your entire file structure. This isn't malicious - they're trying to be helpful - but it makes their changes much harder to review and verify.</p><p>During one simple package reorganization, Gemini got stuck in a loop, unable to resolve the import dependencies it had created. The task was straightforward for a human but somehow too complex for the AI to track consistently.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  The People-Pleasing Problem\n</h3><p>AI models are optimized for user satisfaction, not code quality. This creates some concerning behaviors:</p><ul><li>GPT-4 set test coverage requirements to 20% so the build would pass (rather than improving actual coverage)</li><li>Multiple models generated a  file without considering security implications</li><li>They avoided suggesting additional work (like writing tests) unless explicitly asked</li><li>They took shortcuts to make code \"work\" rather than making it robust</li></ul><p>For security-critical applications like a password manager, this people-pleasing tendency could be genuinely dangerous.</p><p>None of the AI models suggested Test-Driven Development or proactively wrote tests. They would generate test code if asked, but testing wasn't part of their default development approach. This reinforces the idea that AI tools currently optimize for immediate functionality over long-term code quality.</p><p>The test framework that was eventually generated (under heavy prompting from me) was actually quite good, but I had to specifically request it. This suggests the capability exists, but the AI's default behavior doesn't align with professional development practices.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  The Experience Amplification Theory\n</h2><p>The most important insight from my experiment is what I'm calling the \"experience amplification theory\": <strong>AI coding tools amplify the developer's existing skill level and habits rather than improving them.</strong></p><p>As someone new to Go, I brought Java-influenced patterns and thinking to the codebase. The AI didn't correct these patterns - it implemented them more efficiently. The result was Go code that worked but was architecturally wrong, mixing Java-style approaches with Go implementations.</p><p>A more experienced Go developer would have prompted for idiomatic patterns and caught architectural issues early. But as a novice, I didn't know what I didn't know, and the AI didn't proactively educate me about better approaches.</p><p>AI models have a tendency to solve problems by adding more code rather than creating elegant solutions. Instead of clean abstractions, they often generate:</p><ul><li>Long chains of if-statements rather than streamlined logic</li><li>Repetitive code blocks instead of reusable functions</li><li>Verbose error handling instead of consistent patterns</li><li>Multiple similar functions instead of parameterized solutions</li></ul><p>This \"more code equals solution\" approach creates maintenance nightmares and goes against Go's philosophy of simplicity and clarity.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Missing Professional Practices\n</h3><p>The AI tools I tested didn't suggest professional development practices unless specifically prompted:</p><ul><li>No mention of dependency injection until I requested it</li><li>No proactive suggestions for testing strategies</li><li>No guidance on code organization or package structure</li><li>No warnings about security implications</li><li>No discussion of error handling patterns</li></ul><p>They focused on making code work, not on making it maintainable, testable, or secure.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Vibe Coding vs. Engaged Development\n</h2><p>Through this experiment, I developed a clearer distinction between whats known as \"vibe coding\" and engaged development.</p><p> is when you use AI to generate functionality based purely on desired outputs, without engaging with the actual code, architecture, or implementation details. You prompt for features, check if they work, and move on without understanding what was created.</p><p> means actively reviewing generated code, understanding architectural decisions, learning from implementations, and maintaining involvement in the development process.</p><p>The difference is crucial for security-critical applications. Vibe coding might get you a password manager that encrypts data, but engaged development helps you catch issues like unencrypted secrets files or weak encryption implementations.</p><p>One particularly concerning behavior I discovered: AI models sometimes claim to make changes without actually implementing them. Gemini would confidently describe modifications it was making, but the actual code remained unchanged. This highlights why code review remains essential: you can't trust AI assertions about what changes were made.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  What Actually Worked: A Framework for AI-Assisted Development\n</h2><p>After a week of experimentation, I found several approaches that genuinely improved productivity without creating technical debt.</p><p>The most successful approach was treating AI like an enhanced search engine rather than a pair programmer. Using GPT-4 to answer specific questions about Go syntax, Fyne APIs, or implementation patterns was incredibly valuable:</p><ul><li>\"How do I handle file I/O errors in Go?\"</li><li>\"What's the idiomatic way to structure a Fyne application?\"\n</li><li>\"How do I implement AES encryption in Go?\"</li></ul><p>This kept me in control of architecture and implementation while leveraging AI's knowledge base for faster learning.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  The Boilerplate Sweet Spot\n</h3><p>AI tools excel at generating boilerplate code and handling setup tasks:</p><ul><li>Project structure and dependency management</li><li>Build configurations and deployment scripts</li><li>Standard error handling patterns</li><li>Testing scaffolding and mock generation</li></ul><p>These are time-consuming tasks that don't require creative problem-solving, making them perfect for AI assistance.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Specific, Bounded Prompts\n</h3><p>When I did use AI for code generation, specific prompts worked much better than vague requests:</p><ul><li>‚úÖ \"Add error handling to this encryption function\"</li><li>‚ùå \"Make this more secure\"\n</li><li>‚úÖ \"Validate password strength using OWASP guidelines\"</li></ul><p>Specific prompts naturally led to smaller, reviewable changes that I could understand and verify.</p><p>I experimented with flipping the traditional roles - having me write code while the AI provided suggestions and guidance. This approach showed promise:</p><ul><li>Kept me engaged with the implementation</li><li>Provided knowledge without taking control</li><li>Reduced debug/refactor cycles</li><li>Maintained architectural consistency</li></ul><p>However, it was difficult to keep AI models in this advisory role. They have a strong tendency to want to \"take over\" and generate full implementations rather than just providing guidance.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Professional vs. Personal: The Readiness Gap\n</h2><p>My experience reveals a clear divide in where AI-assisted coding provides genuine value versus where it creates more problems than it solves.</p><p>For individual developers building personal tools, AI assistance can be transformative: faster prototyping and experimentation, access to unfamiliar technologies and frameworks, ability to build functional applications outside your expertise area, and lower stakes if things go wrong. My password manager project is a perfect example: I built something genuinely useful that I couldn't have created as quickly without AI assistance.</p><p>For professional, production code, current AI tools have significant limitations: too many subtle bugs and edge cases missed, architectural decisions that don't scale, security shortcuts that create vulnerabilities, code that works but isn't maintainable, and lack of proper testing and validation. The people-pleasing tendency and focus on immediate functionality over long-term quality make current AI tools unsuitable for critical production systems.</p><p>The biggest insight from my week of AI-assisted coding is that <strong>we need to develop better practices for working with these tools</strong>. The current approach of \"let the AI do more\" may be moving in the wrong direction.</p><p>Based on my experience, effective AI-assisted development should follow these principles:</p><ol><li><strong>Keep humans in the architectural loop</strong> : AI can generate implementations, but humans should make structural decisions</li><li><strong>Prefer small, reviewable changes</strong> : Resist the temptation to let AI make large autonomous modifications</li><li><strong>Maintain engagement with the code</strong> : Don't let AI quality reduce your involvement in understanding what's being built</li><li><strong>Use specific, bounded prompts</strong> : Vague requests lead to scope creep and unwanted changes</li><li><strong>Treat AI as a knowledge tool first, code generator second</strong> : The reference use case is more reliable than the generation use case</li><li><strong>Always verify claims and changes</strong> : AI confidence doesn't equal correctness</li><li><strong>Focus AI assistance on setup, boilerplate, and knowledge gaps</strong> : Avoid using it for core business logic and architecture</li></ol><p>The future likely isn't more autonomous AI agents, but better human-AI collaboration patterns. We need tools that provide knowledge and suggestions without taking control, respect architectural boundaries and project constraints, encourage good development practices rather than just working code, support iterative, reviewable development processes, and maintain human engagement and learning.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Conclusion: AI as an Amplifier, Not Replacement\n</h2><p>After a week of intensive experimentation with AI-assisted coding, my biggest takeaway is nuance. These tools are incredibly powerful but require careful, intentional use to provide genuine value.</p><p>AI coding assistance is best understood as an amplifier of existing developer capabilities rather than a replacement for developer skills. Good developers can use these tools to work faster and explore new technologies more quickly. But the tools don't make bad developers good - they just help them produce bad code more efficiently.</p><p>The productivity gains are real, but they're not uniformly distributed across all development tasks. AI excels at boilerplate, setup, and knowledge transfer. It struggles with architecture, complex refactoring, and the kind of nuanced decision-making that separates working code from maintainable code.</p><p>Most importantly, the best AI-assisted development workflows aren't the most autonomous ones. The sweet spot seems to be maintaining human control over architecture and implementation while leveraging AI for knowledge, suggestions, and rapid generation of well-defined components.</p><p>We're still in the early days of learning how to work effectively with these tools. The patterns that work best may be quite different from what the current hype cycle suggests. Based on my experience, the future of AI-assisted development is likely to be more collaborative and less autonomous than current trends indicate.</p><p>The key is finding the right balance: leveraging AI's strengths while maintaining the human judgment, architectural thinking, and code quality practices that produce software you can actually maintain and trust.</p><p><strong>Was the experiment a success?</strong> Absolutely. I now have a working, cross-platform password manager available on GitHub with automated tests, proper releases, and reasonably clean code. More importantly, I went from knowing zero Go to understanding core concepts and idiomatic patterns - something that would have taken weeks of traditional learning.</p><p>The real success, though, was discovering a more nuanced relationship with AI coding tools. Instead of the binary \"AI good\" or \"AI bad\" perspective I started with, I now have a framework for when and how to use these tools effectively.</p><p>And perhaps most importantly: I genuinely enjoyed every minute of this project. The combination of learning a new language, exploring AI capabilities, and building something I actually use daily made for an engaging week of coding. It's given me a long list of similar experiments I want to try next.</p><p>Sometimes the best way to understand new technology is just to dive in and build something real with it.</p><p><em>Want to share your own experiences with AI-assisted coding?

But first, let‚Äôs see how to position and move objects in 3D space.</p><p>In 3D space, we position objects by setting its coordinates along three axes: x,y, and z.</p><p>The x-axis typically represents horizontal movement‚Äîleft or right.</p><p>The y-axis typically represents vertical movement‚Äîup or down.</p><p>The z-axis typically represents depth‚Äîforward or backward</p><p>To move an object in 3D space, we can use mathematical functions to set its position over time.</p><p>For example, this cube's x position is set to 10 * cos(œÄt/2), where t is time (in seconds).</p><p>The result? It oscillates from 10 to -10 along the x-axis every 2 seconds, following a cosine wave.</p><p>Similarly, setting the y position to 10 * cos(œÄt/2) makes the cube oscillates vertically, from 10 to -10 every 2 seconds.</p><p>We can create a two-dimensional path by setting the x and y positions to different functions.</p><p>For this circle, the x position is set to 10 * cos(œÄt/2).</p><p>The cube starts at x = 10, moves to -10 in 2 seconds, then back to 10, and so on.</p><p>Meanwhile, the y position is set to 10 * sin(œÄt/2).</p><p>The movement for x and y may look similar, but they are actually out of phase.</p><p>When x = 10, y = 0; when x = 0, y = 10; and so on.</p><p>Together, these two functions create a circular path for the cube.</p><p>Now we can get creative with functions to create even more complex paths.</p><p>For example, let's multiply the x function by 0.03 * t.</p><p>It would make the cube oscillates farther on the x-axis over time.</p><p>..and we will have a circular path whose radius grows over time.</p><h3>Okay, now it's time to talk about the spherical helix (finally!)</h3><h3>The spherical helix path is similar to the spiral we just made, but with some differences.</h3><h3>First, a spherical helix is three-dimensional.</h3><p>It has a z component that changes over time.</p><p>This cube's z position is set as 10 * cos(0.02 * œÄt).</p><p>It will start from z = 10 then slowly move to -10.</p><p>Second, unlike the previous spiral, the x and y positions don‚Äôt grow indefinitely.</p><p>They grow at first, then shrink halfway through.</p><p>This is because the x function is multiplied by another sine function: sin(0.02 * œÄt)</p><p>which makes the radius larger in the middle and smaller at the ends.</p><p>The same is also done to the y function.</p><h3>Together, these functions create a spherical helix.</h3><h3>By updating the cube‚Äôs position with these functions, it moves along a spherical helix path.</h3><p>In summary, we can move objects in 3D space by defining their x, y, z coordinates as functions of time.</p><p>These functions, which express x, y, z coordinates as a function of another variable (in this case, time), are called parametric equations.</p><p>Check out the Wikipedia article for more on parametric equations.</p><p>Now that we know this, we can get creative and move objects along any path we want!</p><p>...to this complex, chaotic path...</p><p>...which we know now isn't actually chaotic.</p><p>It's just a path defined by mathematical functions.</p><p>Thanks for sticking with me, I hope you enjoyed it!</p><p>visualrambling.space is a personal project by Damar, someone who loves to learn about different topics and rambling about them visually.</p><p>If you like this, please consider following me on Twitter and sharing this with your friends.</p><p>I'm planning to write more articles like this, so stay tuned!</p><p>https://twitter.com/damarberlari</p>","contentLength":4018,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44962066"},{"title":"Debugging Python in Docker: A Tutorial for Beginners","url":"https://www.kdnuggets.com/debugging-python-in-docker-a-tutorial-for-beginners","date":1755698403,"author":"Bala Priya C","guid":234545,"unread":true,"content":"<article>New to running Python in Docker?

However, JSON has transcended its origins to become language-agnostic and is now recognized as the <a href=\"https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8259\">standard</a> for .</p><p>The popularity of JSON can be attributed to native support by the JavaScript language, resulting in excellent parsing performance in web browsers. On top of that, JSON‚Äôs straightforward syntax allows both humans and computers to read and write JSON data effortlessly.</p><p>To get a first impression of JSON, have a look at this example code:</p><p>You‚Äôll learn more about the JSON syntax later in this tutorial.

One idea behind establishing JSON as the go-to data interchange format was to make working with JSON as convenient as possible, independently of which programming language you use:</p><blockquote><p>[A collection of key-value pairs and arrays] are universal data structures. Virtually all modern programming languages support them in one form or another. It makes sense that a data format that is interchangeable with programming languages is also based on these structures.

The top-level value is a JSON object.

to Insight","url":"https://www.oreilly.com/radar/from-automation-to-insight/","date":1755685216,"author":"David Michelson","guid":234472,"unread":true,"content":"<p>As an acquisitions editor at O‚ÄôReilly, I spend considerable time tracking our authors‚Äô digital footprints. Their social media posts, speaking engagements, and online thought leadership don‚Äôt just reflect expertise‚Äîthey directly impact book sales and reveal promotional strategies worth replicating. Not surprisingly, some of our best-selling authors are social media mavens whose posting output is staggering. Keeping up with multiple superposters across platforms quickly becomes unsustainable.</p><p>I recently built an AI solution to manage this challenge. Using Relay.app, I created a simple workflow to scrape LinkedIn posts from one author (let‚Äôs call her Bridget), analyze them with ChatGPT, and send me weekly email summaries about her posts and which got the most attention. The main goal was to follow what she said about her book, followed by thought leadership in her field. The setup took five minutes and worked immediately. No more periodically reviewing her profile or worrying about missing important posts.</p><p>But by the second summary, some limitations became apparent. Sorted by likes and impressions with generic summaries, every LinkedIn post was receiving the same treatment. I had solved the information overload problem but now needed a way to extract strategic insight.</p><p>To fix this, I worked with Claude to turn the prompt into something closer to an agent with basic decision-making authority. I gave it specific goals and decision criteria aimed at shedding light on promotional patterns that are not always easy to follow, let alone analyze, in a flurry of posts: autonomously select 10‚Äì15 priority posts per week, prioritizing direct book mentions; compare current performance against historical baselines; flag unusual engagement patterns (both positive and negative); and automatically adjust analysis depth based on how posts are performing.</p><p>The new report now provides deeper analysis focused primarily on posts mentioning the book, not just any popular post, along with strategic recommendations to improve post performance instead of ‚Äúthis had the most likes.‚Äù Recommendations are sorted into short-term and long-term promotion ideas, and it has even proposed testing novel strategies such as posting short video clips related to book chapters or incentive-driven posts.</p><p>The report isn‚Äôt perfect. The historical analysis isn‚Äôt quite right yet, and I‚Äôm working on generating visualizations. At the very least, it‚Äôs saving me time by automating the delivery and analysis of information I would otherwise have to get manually (and possibly overlook), and it is beginning to provide a starting point for understanding what has worked in Bridget‚Äôs promotional program. Over time, with further work, these insights could be shared with the author to plan promotional campaigns for new books, or incorporated into larger comparisons of promotional strategies between authors.</p><p>While working on this, I‚Äôve asked myself: Is this an AI-enhanced automated workflow? An agent? An agentic workflow? Does it matter?</p><p>For my purposes, I don‚Äôt think it does. Sometimes you need simple automation to capture information you might miss. Sometimes you need more goal-directed, flexible analysis that results in deeper insight and strategic recommendations. More of a helpful assistant working behind the scenes week after week on your behalf. But getting caught up in definitions and labels can be a distraction. As AI tools become more accessible to everyone in the workplace, a more valuable focus is found in building solutions that address your specific problems using these new tools‚Äîwhatever you might call them.</p>","contentLength":3649,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/08/AI-data-wrangling.jpg","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"H∆∞·ªõng d·∫´n s·ª≠ d·ª•ng Midjourney API v·ªõi Apiframe","url":"https://dev.to/techguypaul/huong-dan-su-dung-midjourney-api-voi-apiframe-35ad","date":1755684770,"author":"L√™ Minh Paul","guid":234474,"unread":true,"content":"<h2>\n  \n  \n  T·ªïng quan\n</h2>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://apiframe.ai\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Apiframe</a> cung c·∫•p c√°c REST endpoint r√µ r√†ng ƒë·ªÉ ƒëi·ªÅu khi·ªÉn <strong>Midjourney AI</strong> t·ª´ ·ª©ng d·ª•ng c·ªßa b·∫°n.

ASGI?\n</h2>\n\n<p><strong>WSGI (Web Server Gateway Interface)</strong> and <strong>ASGI (Asynchronous Server Gateway Interface)</strong> are specifications that define how web servers communicate with Python web applications and frameworks.</p>\n\n<p>Think of them as \"contracts\" or \"protocols\" that ensure web servers and Python applications can work together seamlessly.</p>\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  WSGI (Web Server Gateway Interface)\n</h2>\n\n<h3>\n  \n  \n  Overview\n</h3>\n\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Created</strong>: 2003 (PEP 333, updated in PEP 3333)</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Purpose</strong>: Standardize the interface between web servers and Python web applications</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Model</strong>: Synchronous, blocking I/O</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Status</strong>: Mature, widely adopted standard</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>\n  \n  \n  How WSGI Works\n</h3>\n\n<p>WSGI defines a simple interface with two sides:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>\n<strong>Server side</strong>: Web server that implements WSGI</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Application side</strong>: Python application that conforms to WSGI</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h3>\n  \n  \n  WSGI Application Structure\n</h3>\n\n<p>A WSGI application is simply a callable (function or class) that:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Takes two arguments: <code>environ</code> and <code>start_response</code>\n</li>\n<li>Returns an iterable of byte strings\n</li>\n</ul>\n\n<div

(Asynchronous Server Gateway Interface)\n</h2>\n\n<h3>\n  \n  \n  Overview\n</h3>\n\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Created</strong>: 2016</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Purpose</strong>: Extend WSGI to support asynchronous Python and handle WebSockets, HTTP/2, etc.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Model</strong>: Asynchronous, non-blocking I/O</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Status</strong>: Modern standard for async Python web applications</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>\n  \n  \n  Why ASGI?\n</h3>\n\n<p>WSGI limitations:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Synchronous only</strong> - blocking I/O operations</li>\n<li>\n<strong>HTTP only</strong> - can't handle WebSockets, HTTP/2 server push</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Request-response cycle</strong> - doesn't support long-lived connections</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Threading overhead</strong> - each request typically needs a thread</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>ASGI solutions:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Asynchronous</strong> - non-blocking I/O with async/await</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Protocol agnostic</strong> - HTTP, WebSockets, HTTP/2, etc.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Long-lived connections</strong> - persistent connections</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Better performance</strong> - single-threaded event loop</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>\n  \n  \n  ASGI Application Structure\n</h3>\n\n<p>An ASGI application is an async callable that:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Takes three arguments: <code>scope</code>,

I'm a dev who got hit hard by subscription fatigue. You know the feeling: every cool AI tool wants a monthly fee, and before you know it, you're juggling a dozen paid plans. I reached a point where I thought, there has to be a free, open-source way to do this stuff. Good news ‚Äì there usually is! Open-source AI tools are not just about saving money; they give you control over your data, the ability to self-host, and often a whole community adding new features. </p>\n\n<p>In this post, I'll share seven open-source tools that have replaced big chunks of my paid stack. These tools boost productivity, automate tedious workflows, and just make life easier ‚Äì all without the recurring bills. <br>\nLet's dive in! </p>\n\n\n\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  1. Eigent ‚Äì open-source replacement for Manus AI\n</h2>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fdjnte02fezdgy8mfofdr.png\" class=\"article-body-image-wrapper\"><img src=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fdjnte02fezdgy8mfofdr.png\" alt=\" \" width=\"800\" height=\"450\"></a></p>\n\n<p>Manus is a powerful multi-agent AI tool, but it's proprietary and pricey: it charges $39 per month for its starter plan and $199 per month for pro, has no free tier and is available only through an invite-only beta. It's closed-source, so you can't audit or modify the code.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.eigent.ai/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Eigent</a> flips that model on its head. Built on the OWL framework from CAMEL-AI, it's the world's first multi-agent workforce desktop application. Visit the <a href=\"https://github.com/CAMEL-AI/camel\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Eigent GitHub repository</a> to learn more. Eigent lets you build, manage and deploy a custom AI workforce that breaks complex tasks into smaller jobs and runs them in parallel. According to its GitHub documentation, it offers:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Multi-agent collaboration</strong>: you can deploy multiple specialized agents that work together on tasks.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Parallel execution</strong>: agents can work on several subtasks simultaneously to speed up workflows.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Full customisation</strong>: tune your AI workforce to match your specific needs.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Privacy-first design</strong>: Eigent runs locally; your data stays on your machine with no cloud dependency.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>100% open source</strong>: all code is available, so you can audit, contribute or modify.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>For developers and power-users, Eigent is a compelling alternative to Manus‚Äîno subscription fees, no waiting list, and full control of your agent workflows.</p>\n\n\n\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  2. n8n ‚Äì free workflow automation instead of Make or Zapier\n</h2>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2F289wtj2j15oydbdjbq6m.gif\" class=\"article-body-image-wrapper\"><img src=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2F289wtj2j15oydbdjbq6m.gif\" alt=\" \" width=\"760\" height=\"385\"></a></p>\n\n<p>Automation platforms like Make, Zapier or Pipedream are great, but their paid plans add up quickly. <a href=\"https://n8n.io\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">n8n</a> is a flexible, open-source automation tool trusted by enterprises like Cisco and Microsoft.

Sometimes you miss wildly (high variance), other times you consistently hit the same spot, but far from the center (high bias). The perfect throw lands consistently close to the bullseye ‚Äì a balance between bias and variance. This analogy perfectly captures the essence of the bias-variance trade-off in machine learning. It's a fundamental concept that dictates the accuracy and generalizability of our models, and understanding it is crucial for building effective and reliable machine learning systems.</p>\n\n<p>In machine learning, the goal is to build models that accurately predict unseen data. However, models are prone to two types of errors:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>Bias:</strong> This refers to the error introduced by approximating a real-world problem, which is often complex, with a simplified model.  High bias leads to <strong>underfitting</strong>, where the model is too simple to capture the underlying patterns in the data.  Think of trying to fit a straight line to a curved dataset.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Variance:</strong> This refers to the error introduced by the model's sensitivity to small fluctuations in the training data. High variance leads to <strong>overfitting</strong>, where the model learns the training data too well, including its noise, and performs poorly on unseen data. Imagine a model that perfectly memorizes the training set but fails miserably on new examples.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The bias-variance trade-off is the inherent tension between these two errors. Reducing bias often increases variance, and vice-versa. The goal is to find the optimal balance ‚Äì a model that is complex enough to capture the underlying patterns but not so complex that it overfits the noise.</p>\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  Understanding the Mathematics\n</h2>\n\n<p>Let's delve a bit deeper into the mathematical representation. The total error of a model can be decomposed as:</p>\n\n<p><code>Total Error = Bias¬≤ + Variance + Irreducible Error</code></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Irreducible Error:</strong> This is the inherent noise in the data that cannot be reduced by any model.  Think of random fluctuations that are impossible to predict.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The bias is often measured as the difference between the average prediction of the model and the true value. Variance measures the spread of the model's predictions around its average.</p>\n\n<p>Minimizing the total error involves finding the sweet spot where both bias and variance are low.</p>\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  Algorithms and their Impact\n</h2>\n\n<p>Different algorithms inherently exhibit different bias-variance characteristics.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>Linear Regression:</strong>  Generally has high bias and low variance. It's a simple model that makes strong assumptions about the data.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Decision Trees:</strong> Can have low bias but high variance.  They can become very complex and overfit easily if not pruned properly.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Support Vector Machines (SVMs):</strong> Offer a good balance, often achieving low bias and variance depending on the kernel and hyperparameter tuning.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Neural Networks:</strong>  Highly flexible and can achieve low bias, but are prone to high variance if not regularized properly.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  Regularization: Controlling Complexity\n</h2>\n\n<p>Regularization techniques help control the complexity of a model and mitigate overfitting (high variance). A common method is L2 regularization (Ridge Regression):<br>\n</p>\n\n<div class=\"highlight js-code-highlight\">\n<pre class=\"highlight python\"><code><span class=\"c1\"># Simplified pseudo-code for L2 regularization in linear regression\n</span><span class=\"k\">def</span> <span class=\"nf\">l2_regularized_linear_regression</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">X</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"n\">y</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"n\">lambda_</span><span class=\"p\">):</span>\n  <span class=\"c1\"># ... (Calculate weights using gradient descent or other methods) ...\n</span>  <span class=\"c1\"># Add a penalty term to the cost function proportional to the sum of squared weights\n</span>  <span class=\"n\">cost</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"nf\">calculate_cost</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">X</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"n\">y</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"n\">weights</span><span class=\"p\">)</span> <span class=\"o\">+</span> <span class=\"n\">lambda_</span> <span class=\"o\">*</span> <span class=\"nf\">sum</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">weights</span><span class=\"o\">**</span><span class=\"mi\">2</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n  <span class=\"c1\"># ... (Update weights based on gradient of the cost function)...\n</span>  <span class=\"k\">return</span> <span class=\"n\">weights</span>\n</code></pre>\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>Here, <code>lambda_</code> is the regularization parameter. A larger <code>lambda_</code> imposes a stronger penalty on large weights, effectively simplifying the model and reducing variance.</p>\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  Real-World Applications and Challenges\n</h2>\n\n<p>The bias-variance trade-off is crucial in various applications:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>Medical Diagnosis:</strong>  Overfitting could lead to inaccurate diagnoses, while underfitting might miss critical patterns.  Finding the right balance is vital.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Fraud Detection:</strong>  High variance can lead to false positives (flagging legitimate transactions as fraudulent), while high bias can miss actual fraudulent activities.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Self-Driving Cars:</strong>  Accurate object recognition requires a model with low bias and variance to ensure safe navigation.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>However, challenges remain:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>Determining the optimal balance:</strong>  Finding the right level of model complexity is often an iterative process involving experimentation and hyperparameter tuning.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Data scarcity:</strong>  With limited data, it's difficult to accurately estimate bias and variance, making it harder to find the optimal balance.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Ethical Considerations:</strong>  Bias in the training data can lead to biased models, perpetuating and amplifying existing societal inequalities.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  Conclusion:  A Continuous Pursuit of Balance\n</h2>\n\n<p>The bias-variance trade-off is a central challenge and a constant theme in machine learning.

If you‚Äôre building high-performance apps in Go‚Äîthink microservices, API gateways, or real-time data pipelines‚Äîmemory allocation can make or break your system. Frequent allocations of small objects (like structs for JSON parsing) can hammer your garbage collector (GC), while large objects (like buffers for file uploads) can spike memory usage and crash your app with out-of-memory (OOM) errors. Sound familiar?</p><p>Imagine your app as a busy warehouse: small objects are like tiny packages cluttering shelves, causing fragmentation, while large objects are bulky crates eating up space. Go‚Äôs memory allocator, inspired by tcmalloc, is built for speed and concurrency, but without the right strategies, you‚Äôre leaving performance on the table.</p><p>In this guide, we‚Äôll dive into <strong>Go‚Äôs memory allocation mechanics</strong>, share <strong>practical optimization techniques</strong> for small and large objects, and sprinkle in real-world tips from a decade of Go projects. Whether you‚Äôre a Go newbie or a seasoned pro, you‚Äôll walk away with actionable tricks to boost throughput, reduce GC pressure, and keep your app humming. Let‚Äôs get started!</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  1. How Go‚Äôs Memory Allocator Works (Without the Boring Bits)\n</h2><p>To optimize memory, you need to know how Go hands out memory like a restaurant serving orders. Here‚Äôs the quick version:</p><ul><li>: A thread-local cache for each Goroutine, serving small objects (‚â§32KB) lightning-fast.</li><li>: A shared pool that refills mcache when it‚Äôs empty.</li><li>: The big warehouse for large objects (&gt;32KB) and backup for everything else.</li></ul><p>Small objects (e.g., a 100-byte struct) zip through mcache for quick allocation, while large objects (e.g., a 100KB buffer) go straight to mheap, which is slower due to locking. Frequent small object allocations can fragment memory, spiking GC time, while large objects cause memory peaks, triggering GC more often.</p><p><strong>Quick Example: Watching Memory in Action</strong></p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><div><pre><code>Allocated: 120 KB, GC cycles: 0\nAllocated: 220 KB, GC cycles: 1\n</code></pre></div><p> The small objects add a modest 120KB, but the large object spikes memory by 100KB and triggers a GC cycle. This shows why we need tailored strategies for each.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  2. Optimizing Small Objects: Less GC, More Speed\n</h2><p>Small objects are the bread and butter of Go apps‚Äîthink structs for API responses or temporary buffers. But creating tons of them can choke your GC. Here are three killer techniques to keep things smooth:</p><ol><li>\nUse  to recycle short-lived objects instead of allocating new ones. It‚Äôs like reusing coffee cups instead of grabbing a new one every time.\n</li></ol><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>: Reusing objects cuts allocations, reducing GC pressure and fragmentation. In a real API, this slashed GC time by 30% for me.</p><ol><li><p><p>\nCombine multiple small structs into one to reduce allocation counts. It‚Äôs like packing multiple items into one box to save space.</p></p></li><li><p> to avoid resizing. For example, if you know your API response will hold 100 items, pre-allocate that capacity.</p></li></ol><p>: Use  to spot allocation hotspots. Run <code>go tool pprof http://localhost:6060/debug/pprof/heap</code> to see where your memory‚Äôs going.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  3. Taming Large Objects: Avoid Memory Spikes\n</h2><p>Large objects (&gt;32KB) are like heavy cargo‚Äîthey‚Äôre rare but costly. Allocating them directly from mheap involves locking and can balloon memory usage. Here‚Äôs how to keep them in check:</p><ol><li>\nBreak large objects into smaller chunks (e.g., 32KB) to stay within small object territory and reduce memory peaks.\n</li></ol><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>: Chunking keeps allocations small, cutting peak memory by 50% in a file-upload service I worked on.</p><ol><li><p> or a custom pool to reuse large buffers instead of allocating new ones.</p></li><li><p> after use to help the GC reclaim memory faster.</p></li></ol><h2>\n  \n  \n  4. Real-World Wins: Case Studies from the Trenches\n</h2><p>Theory is great, but nothing beats seeing optimization in action. Over the past decade, I‚Äôve tackled memory challenges in Go projects ranging from snappy microservices to hefty file-processing pipelines. Below are two detailed case studies‚Äîcomplete with problems, solutions, results, and hard-learned lessons‚Äîto show how these techniques transform real systems.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Case Study 1: Taming GC in a High-Traffic API Service\n</h3><p>: Imagine a RESTful API serving thousands of requests per second for a real-time analytics platform. Each request created a  struct for JSON serialization, leading to millions of small object allocations per minute. The result? <strong>30% of CPU time burned on garbage collection</strong>, with response latencies creeping up to 200ms, frustrating users.</p><p>: Every HTTP handler allocated a new  struct, like this:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>This churned through memory, fragmenting the heap and triggering frequent GC cycles. Profiling with  showed allocation hotspots in the handler, with  reporting 500+ GC cycles per minute.</p><ul><li>: We created a pool to reuse  structs, pre-allocating the  slice to 1KB to avoid resizing.</li><li>: Ensured all slices in the handler had known capacities based on typical response sizes.</li><li>: Used <code>go tool pprof http://localhost:6060/debug/pprof/heap</code> to verify allocation reductions.</li></ul><p>Here‚Äôs the optimized handler:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><ul><li>: Dropped from 30% to 20% of CPU, freeing resources for actual work.</li><li>: Average response time fell from 200ms to 170ms‚Äîa 15% boost.</li><li>: Reduced by 80%, as  showed fewer heap allocations.</li></ul><ul><li>: Forgetting  caused memory leaks in early tests. Using  ensured cleanup.</li><li>:  was our hero, revealing that some handlers still allocated unnecessarily due to dynamic slice growth.</li><li>: We used  to simulate traffic and confirm the pool scaled well under 10,000 req/sec.</li></ul><p>: For high-concurrency APIs,  and pre-allocation are game-changers, but you must profile and test to avoid subtle bugs.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Case Study 2: Conquering OOM in a File Upload Service\n</h3><p>: A service handling multi-GB file uploads for a cloud storage platform was crashing with OOM errors. Users uploaded files up to 5GB, and the service allocated a single buffer to read each file, causing  and frequent GC cycles that couldn‚Äôt keep up.</p><p>: The original code looked like this:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>This approach allocated massive buffers upfront, overwhelming the heap.  showed memory usage spiking to 5GB per upload, and concurrent uploads triggered OOMs on our 8GB servers.</p><ul><li>: We switched to reading files in 32KB chunks (aligned with Go‚Äôs small object threshold) using .</li><li>: Created a pool for 32KB buffers to reuse memory across uploads.</li><li>: Monitored memory with <code>http://localhost:6060/debug/pprof/heap</code> to ensure no leaks.</li></ul><p>Here‚Äôs the optimized version:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><ul><li>: Dropped from 5GB to 2.5GB, even with multiple concurrent uploads.</li><li>: Handled 10x more simultaneous uploads without crashes.</li><li>: Reduced by 40%, as smaller allocations meant less heap scanning.</li></ul><ul><li>: Initial versions forgot to reset buffers, causing memory to creep up.  helped us spot this.</li><li>: We tested 16KB, 32KB, and 64KB chunks; 32KB hit the sweet spot for small object allocation.</li><li>: Added  logging to track memory trends in production.</li></ul><p>: Chunking and pooling for large objects can save your app from OOMs, but you need to profile and monitor to ensure buffers are reused correctly.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  5. Common Pitfalls: Don‚Äôt Trip Over These!\n</h2><p>Optimizing memory in Go is like navigating a minefield‚Äîone wrong step, and your app‚Äôs performance tanks. Here are three common pitfalls I‚Äôve seen (and fallen into) and how to dodge them.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Pitfall 1: Overusing  Like a Magic Bullet\n</h3><p> is awesome for reusing objects, but it‚Äôs not a cure-all. Pooling every object adds complexity, and forgetting to return objects to the pool can cause memory leaks. I once worked on a project where we pooled , only to find the pool‚Äôs overhead outweighed the benefits for low-frequency objects.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><ul><li>Use  to guarantee objects are returned.</li><li>Reserve  for high-frequency, short-lived objects (e.g., API response structs).</li><li>Profile with  to check if pooling actually reduces allocations.</li></ul><p>: Run  in tests to simulate GC pressure and ensure objects are reused.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Pitfall 2: Ignoring Large Object Lifecycles\n</h3><p>Large objects are memory hogs, and if you don‚Äôt release them properly, they‚Äôll haunt your heap. In one project, a global buffer wasn‚Äôt reset after use, causing OOMs during peak traffic. The GC can‚Äôt reclaim memory if references linger in Goroutines or global variables.</p><p><strong>Example of Proper Cleanup</strong>:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><ul><li>Set large objects to  after use to help the GC.</li><li>Use  to track memory ().</li><li>Avoid storing large buffers in global variables or long-lived Goroutines.</li></ul><p>: Add  logging to monitor peak memory in production.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Pitfall 3: Blindly Pre-allocating Slices\n</h3><p>Pre-allocating slice capacity with  is great, but guessing too big wastes memory, and too small leads to reallocations. In one project, we pre-allocated 10MB slices for data that rarely exceeded 1KB, bloating memory usage.</p><ul><li>: Use  to test different capacities:\n</li></ul><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><ul><li>: Estimate capacity based on typical use cases.</li><li>: Adjust pre-allocation as data patterns change.</li></ul><p><strong>Table: Pitfalls and Fixes</strong></p><div><table><tbody><tr><td>Use , limit scope, profile</td></tr><tr><td>Set to , use , monitor</td></tr><tr><td>Memory waste, reallocations</td><td>Benchmark, estimate, reassess</td></tr></tbody></table></div><h2>\n  \n  \n  6. Conclusion: Your Roadmap to Go Memory Mastery\n</h2><p>Optimizing memory allocation in Go isn‚Äôt just a nerdy exercise‚Äîit‚Äôs a superpower for building fast, stable apps. Whether you‚Äôre serving thousands of API requests or processing massive files, the right strategies can slash GC time, cut memory peaks, and keep users happy. Here‚Äôs what we‚Äôve covered:</p><ul><li>: Use  to reuse structs, merge objects to reduce allocations, and pre-allocate slices to avoid resizing. These tricks cut GC time by up to 30% in high-traffic APIs.</li><li>: Chunk data into smaller pieces, reuse buffers, and manage lifecycles manually to halve memory peaks and prevent OOMs.</li><li>: From a 15% latency drop in APIs to 10x more concurrent file uploads, these techniques deliver.</li><li>: Don‚Äôt overuse , neglect large object cleanup, or guess slice capacities‚Äîprofile and test instead.</li></ul><p>: In production, memory optimization translates to lower cloud costs, happier users, and fewer 3 a.m. alerts. I‚Äôve seen teams save thousands in server costs by trimming memory usage 50% with these techniques.</p><ol><li>: Fire up  (<code>go tool pprof http://localhost:6060/debug/pprof/heap</code>) to find allocation hotspots.</li><li>: Try  for your API structs or chunking for file processing. Start small and measure with .</li><li>: Use  or set  to cap memory and track GC frequency.</li><li>: Share your wins on Reddit‚Äôs r/golang or at GopherCon meetups.</li></ol><p>: Go‚Äôs memory allocator is getting smarter.

One of the complications associated with diabetes is slow-healing wounds. These wounds can take a long time to heal, and in some cases, may never fully close. However, a recent breakthrough in the field of wound healing has shown promising results in restoring blood flow and accelerating the healing process.</p>\n\n<p>The Breakthrough: A \"Smart\" Gel</p>\n\n<p>Scientists have developed a new gel-based treatment that combines tiny healing messengers called vesicles with a special hydrogel.

Additionally, the treatment has been found to encourage the growth of new blood vessels, which can help to speed up the healing process.</p>\n\n<p>In tests, the treatment was found to heal diabetic wounds much faster than normal. In fact, the wounds closed in just a few days, compared to the months it can take for diabetic wounds to heal naturally.

From streetlights to smartphones, we are constantly surrounded by artificial light at night. However, what many people don't realize is that this exposure to artificial light can have significant effects on our brain function, mood, and metabolism. In this blog post, we will delve into the hidden ways in which nighttime artificial light can harm us and provide some practical solutions to minimize its impact.</p>\n\n<p>The Science Behind It</p>\n\n<p>Artificial light at night disrupts our natural circadian rhythms, which are internal biological clocks that regulate our sleep-wake cycles, hormone production, and other physiological processes. When we expose ourselves to artificial light at night, our bodies become confused and think it is daytime, leading to a range of negative effects.</p>\n\n<p>One of the most significant impacts of artificial light at night is on our immune system. Studies have shown that exposure to blue light at night can suppress the production of melatonin, a hormone that helps regulate our sleep and immune function. This can lead to a weakened immune system and an increased risk of infections.</p>\n\n<p>Another area where artificial light at night can have a negative impact is on our mood. Research has shown that exposure to blue light at night can disrupt the production of serotonin, a neurotransmitter that plays a crucial role in regulating mood. This can lead to feelings of depression, anxiety, and irritability.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, artificial light at night can also affect our metabolism. Studies have shown that exposure to blue light at night can disrupt the production of leptin and ghrelin, two hormones that regulate hunger and satiety. This can lead to increased appetite and weight gain.</p>\n\n<p>Practical Solutions</p>\n\n<p>Given the potential negative effects of artificial light at night, it is essential to take steps to minimize exposure. Here are some practical solutions that can help:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Limit screen time before bed: One of the most significant sources of artificial light at night is our screens. Try to avoid using your phone, computer, or TV for at least an hour before bed to reduce exposure to blue light.</li>\n<li>Use dim red light bulbs: If you need to use artificial light at night, opt for dim red light bulbs. These bulbs emit less blue light and can help regulate your circadian rhythms.</li>\n<li>Wear blue light-blocking glasses: If you must use electronic devices before bed, consider wearing blue light-blocking glasses. These glasses can help reduce exposure to blue light and minimize its impact on your body.</li>\n<li>Create a dark sleep environment: Ensure your bedroom is as dark as possible to minimize exposure to artificial light. Consider using blackout curtains or earplugs if necessary.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Conclusion</p>\n\n<p>In conclusion, artificial light at night can have significant negative effects on our brain function, mood, and metabolism. By taking steps to minimize exposure, we can help protect our bodies and promote better health. Remember to limit screen time before bed, use dim red light bulbs, wear blue light-blocking glasses, and create a dark sleep environment to reduce the impact of artificial light at night.</p>\n\n\n\n\n<p>üìå Based on insights from <a href=\"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/08/250807233041.htm\" rel=\"noopener

GOMAXPROCS","url":"https://go.dev/blog/container-aware-gomaxprocs","date":1755648000,"author":"Michael Pratt and Carlos Amedee","guid":234621,"unread":true,"content":"<p>Go 1.25 includes new container-aware  defaults, providing more sensible default behavior for many container workloads, avoiding throttling that can impact tail latency, and improving Go‚Äôs out-of-the-box production-readiness.\nIn this post, we will dive into how Go schedules goroutines, how that scheduling interacts with container-level CPU controls, and how Go can perform better with awareness of container CPU controls.</p><p>One of Go‚Äôs strengths is its built-in and easy-to-use concurrency via goroutines.\nFrom a semantic perspective, goroutines appear very similar to operating system threads, enabling us to write simple, blocking code.\nOn the other hand, goroutines are more lightweight than operating system threads, making it much cheaper to create and destroy them on the fly.</p><p>While a Go implementation could map each goroutine to a dedicated operating system thread, Go keeps goroutines lightweight with a runtime scheduler that makes threads fungible.\nAny Go-managed thread can run any goroutine, so creating a new goroutine doesn‚Äôt require creating a new thread, and waking a goroutine doesn‚Äôt necessarily require waking another thread.</p><p>That said, along with a scheduler comes scheduling questions.\nFor example, exactly how many threads should we use to run goroutines?\nIf 1,000 goroutines are runnable, should we schedule them on 1,000 different threads?</p><p>This is where <a href=\"https://go.dev/pkg/runtime#GOMAXPROCS\"></a> comes in.\nSemantically,  tells the Go runtime the ‚Äúavailable parallelism‚Äù that Go should use.\nIn more concrete terms,  is the maximum number of threads to use for running goroutines at once.</p><p>So, if  and there are 1,000 runnable goroutines, Go will use 8 threads to run 8 goroutines at a time.\nOften, goroutines run for a very short time and then block, at which point Go will switch to running another goroutine on that same thread.\nGo will also preempt goroutines that don‚Äôt block on their own, ensuring all goroutines get a chance to run.</p><p>From Go 1.5 through Go 1.24,  defaulted to the total number of CPU cores on the machine.\nNote that in this post, ‚Äúcore‚Äù more precisely means ‚Äúlogical CPU.‚Äù\nFor example, a machine with 4 physical CPUs with hyperthreading has 8 logical CPUs.</p><p>This typically makes a good default for ‚Äúavailable parallelism‚Äù because it naturally matches the available parallelism of the hardware.\nThat is, if there are 8 cores and Go runs more than 8 threads at a time, the operating system will have to multiplex these threads onto the 8 cores, much like how Go multiplexes goroutines onto threads.\nThis extra layer of scheduling is not always a problem, but it is unnecessary overhead.</p><p>Another of Go‚Äôs core strengths is the convenience of deploying applications via a container, and managing the number of cores Go uses is especially important when deploying an application within a container orchestration platform.\nContainer orchestration platforms like <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Kubernetes</a> take a set of machine resources and schedule containers within the available resources based on requested resources.\nPacking as many containers as possible within a cluster‚Äôs resources requires the platform to be able to predict the resource usage of each scheduled container.\nWe want Go to adhere to the resource utilization constraints that the container orchestration platform sets.</p><p>Let‚Äôs explore the effects of the  setting in the context of Kubernetes, as an example.\nPlatforms like Kubernetes provide a mechanism to limit the resources consumed by a container.\nKubernetes has the concept of CPU resource limits, which signal to the underlying operating system how many core resources a specific container or set of containers will be allocated.\nSetting a CPU limit translates to the creation of a Linux <a href=\"https://docs.kernel.org/admin-guide/cgroup-v2.html#cpu\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">control group</a> CPU bandwidth limit.</p><p>Before Go 1.25, Go was unaware of CPU limits set by orchestration platforms.\nInstead, it would set  to the number of cores on the machine it was deployed to.\nIf there was a CPU limit in place, the application may try to use far more CPU than allowed by the limit.\nTo prevent an application from exceeding its limit, the Linux kernel will <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/manage-resources-containers/#how-pods-with-resource-limits-are-run\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">throttle</a> the application.</p><p>Throttling is a blunt mechanism for restricting containers that would otherwise exceed their CPU limit: it completely pauses application execution for the remainder of the throttling period.\nThe throttling period is typically 100ms, so throttling can cause substantial tail latency impact compared to the softer scheduling multiplexing effects of a lower  setting.\nEven if the application never has much parallelism, tasks performed by the Go runtime‚Äîsuch as garbage collection‚Äîcan still cause CPU spikes that trigger throttling.</p><p>We want Go to provide efficient and reliable defaults when possible, so in Go 1.25, we have made  take into account its container environment by default.\nIf a Go process is running inside a container with a CPU limit,  will default to the CPU limit if it is less than the core count.</p><p>Container orchestration systems may adjust container CPU limits on the fly, so Go 1.25 will also periodically check the CPU limit and adjust  automatically if it changes.</p><p>Both of these defaults only apply if  is otherwise unspecified.\nSetting the  environment variable or calling  continues to behave as before.\nThe <a href=\"https://go.dev/pkg/runtime#GOMAXPROCS\"></a> documentation covers the details of the new behavior.</p><h2>Slightly different models</h2><p>Both  and a container CPU limit place a limit on the maximum amount of CPU the process can use, but their models are subtly different.</p><p> is a parallelism limit.\nIf  Go will never run more than 8 goroutines at a time.</p><p>By contrast, CPU limits are a throughput limit.\nThat is, they limit the total CPU time used in some period of wall time.\nThe default period is 100ms.\nSo an ‚Äú8 CPU limit‚Äù is actually a limit of 800ms of CPU time every 100ms of wall time.</p><p>This limit could be filled by running 8 threads continuously for the entire 100ms, which is equivalent to .\nOn the other hand, the limit could also be filled by running 16 threads for 50ms each, with each thread being idle or blocked for the other 50ms.</p><p>In other words, a CPU limit doesn‚Äôt limit the total number of CPUs the container can run on.\nIt only limits total CPU time.</p><p>Most applications have fairly consistent CPU usage across 100ms periods, so the new  default is a pretty good match to the CPU limit, and certainly better than the total core count!\nHowever, it is worth noting that particularly spiky workloads may see a latency increase from this change due to  preventing short-lived spikes of additional threads beyond the CPU limit average.</p><p>In addition, since CPU limits are a throughput limit, they can have a fractional component (e.g., 2.5 CPU).\nOn the other hand,  must be a positive integer.\nThus, Go must round the limit to a valid  value.\nGo always rounds up to enable use of the full CPU limit.</p><p>Go‚Äôs new  default is based on the container‚Äôs CPU limit, but container orchestration systems also provide a ‚ÄúCPU request‚Äù control.\nWhile the CPU limit specifies the maximum CPU a container may use, the CPU request specifies the minimum CPU guaranteed to be available to the container at all times.</p><p>It is common to create containers with a CPU request but no CPU limit, as this allows containers to utilize machine CPU resources beyond the CPU request that would otherwise be idle due to lack of load from other containers.\nUnfortunately, this means that Go cannot set  based on the CPU request, which would prevent utilization of additional idle resources.</p><p>Containers with a CPU request are still <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/manage-resources-containers/#how-pods-with-resource-limits-are-run\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">constrained</a> when exceeding their request if the machine is busy.\nThe weight-based constraint of exceeding requests is ‚Äúsofter‚Äù than the hard period-based throttling of CPU limits, but CPU spikes from high  can still have an adverse impact on application behavior.</p><h2>Should I set a CPU limit?</h2><p>We have learned about the problems caused by having  too high, and that setting a container CPU limit allows Go to automatically set an appropriate , so an obvious next step is to wonder whether all containers should set a CPU limit.</p><p>While that may be good advice to automatically get a reasonable  defaults, there are many other factors to consider when deciding whether to set a CPU limit, such as prioritizing utilization of idle resources by avoiding limits vs prioritizing predictable latency by setting limits.</p><p>The worst behaviors from a mismatch between  and effective CPU limits occur when  is significantly higher than the effective CPU limit.\nFor example, a small container receiving 2 CPUs running on a 128 core machine.\nThese are the cases where it is most valuable to consider setting an explicit CPU limit, or, alternatively, explicitly setting .</p><p>Go 1.25 provides more sensible default behavior for many container workloads by setting  based on container CPU limits.\nDoing so avoids throttling that can impact tail latency, improves efficiency, and generally tries to ensure Go is production-ready out-of-the-box.\nYou can get the new defaults simply by setting the Go version to 1.25.0 or higher in your .</p><p>Thanks to everyone in the community that contributed to the <a href=\"https://go.dev/issue/33803\">long</a><a href=\"https://go.dev/issue/73193\">discussions</a> that made this a reality, and

Yeah, me too. That's exactly why I built PhotoPro.</p>\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  The Problem:\n</h2>\n\n<p>Here‚Äôs the thing: I‚Äôm not a professional photographer. And photo editing? Even worse. Because to ‚Äúproperly‚Äù edit photos you apparently need to know:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>What filters and sliders actually do</li>\n<li>When to use brightness vs. exposure vs. gamma (yes, that‚Äôs a thing)</li>\n<li>Color theory (whatever that is)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Guess what? I know none of that. And to make things worse, I‚Äôm lazy and I don‚Äôt want to spend 45 minutes sliding things left and right like I‚Äôm on Tinder.</p>\n\n<p>Traditional photo editing software isn‚Äôt trivial. Plus, who has time to learn 47 different metrics and filters when you could be doing literally anything else?</p>\n\n<p>So I asked myself:</p>\n\n<p>üëâ What if I just told an AI what I want, and let it figure out the math?</p>\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  <strong>Solution: Let AI Do the Heavy Lifting</strong>\n</h2>\n\n<p>Instead of learning¬†how¬†to edit, I built an app that¬†lets you upload a photo and describe what you want in plain English¬†(or, y‚Äôknow, chaotic keyboard smashes), and Google Gemini AI handles the rest.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Want it cinematic? Just say so.</li>\n<li>Want it to look like Wes Anderson shot it? Easy.</li>\n<li>\"Fix my face. Please. I beg you.\" ? Done.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>But ‚Äî and this is important ‚Äî I didn‚Äôt want to alienate actual photo editors. So PhotoPro also supports good ol‚Äô fashioned <strong>filters</strong>, grouped in categories for the pros who still like their sliders.</p>\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  Why Gemini?\n</h2>\n\n<p>Now, here‚Äôs the deal:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>When we say <em>prompts</em>, we say <em>LLMs</em>.</li>\n<li>When we say <em>open source project</em>, we say <em>open source VLMs</em>.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>BUT‚Ä¶ running open source image models locally requires GPUs that cost more than my monthly rent. So, as a <strong>poor engineer working nights and weekends</strong>, I took the practical route: <strong>use the free Google Gemini Flash API</strong> and build the app around it.</p>\n\n<p>No infra headaches, no cloud bills, just free AI sauce on my images.</p>\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  The Three Enhancement Modes\n</h2>\n\n<h3>\n  \n  \n  1.

For a new SageMaker AI domain, create a domain execution role by following the instructions in <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/sagemaker-roles.html#sagemaker-roles-create-execution-role\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Create execution role</a>.

You can enable trusted identity propagation even while the domain or user has active SageMaker Studio applications. However, for the changes to be applied, the active applications must be restarted. You can use the <code>EffectiveTrustedIdentityPropagationStatus</code> field in the response to the <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeApp.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">DescribeApp</a> API for running applications to determine if the application has trusted identity propagation enabled.</p><p>To enable trusted identity propagation for the domain using the SageMaker AI console, choose  under <strong>Authentication and permissions</strong> on the tab.</p><p>For <strong>Trusted identity propagation</strong>, select <strong>Enable trusted identity propagation for all users on this domain</strong>, and choose  to save the changes.</p><h2>(Optional) Update user background session configuration in IAM Identity Center</h2><p>IAM Identity Center now supports running user background sessions, and the session duration is set by default to 7 days. With background sessions, users can launch long-running SageMaker training jobs that assume the user‚Äôs identity context along with the SageMaker execution role. As an administrator, you can enable or disable user background sessions, and modify the session duration for user background sessions. As of the time of writing, the maximum session duration that you can set for user background sessions is 90 days. The user‚Äôs session is stopped at the end of the specified duration, and consequently, the training job will also fail at the end of the session duration.</p><p>To disable or update the session duration, navigate to the IAM Identity Center console, choose in the navigation pane, and choose  under .</p><p>For , select <strong>Enable user background sessions</strong> and use the dropdown to change the session duration. If user background sessions are disabled, the user must be logged in for the duration of the training job; otherwise, the training job will fail once the user logs out. Updating this configuration doesn‚Äôt affect current running sessions and only applies to newly created user background sessions. Choose  to save your settings.</p><p>Imagine you‚Äôre an enterprise with hundreds or even thousands of users, each requiring varying levels of access to data across multiple teams. You‚Äôre responsible for maintaining an AI/ML system on SageMaker AI and managing access permissions across diverse data sources such as <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/s3\">Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3)</a>, <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/redshift/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Amazon Redshift</a>, and <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/lake-formation/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">AWS Lake Formation</a>. Traditionally, this has involved maintaining complex IAM policies for users, services, and resources, including bucket policies where applicable. This approach is not only tedious but also makes it challenging to track and audit data access without maintaining a separate role for each user.</p><p>This is precisely the scenario that trusted identity propagation aims to address. With trusted identity propagation support, you can now maintain service-specific roles with minimal permissions, such as  or <code>LakeFormation:GetDataAccess</code>, along with additional permissions to start jobs, view job statuses, and perform other necessary tasks. For data access, you can assign fine-grained policies directly to individual users. For instance, Jane might have read access to customer data and full access to sales and pricing data, whereas Laura might only have read access to sales trends. Both Jane and Laura can assume the same SageMaker AI role to access their SageMaker Studio applications, while maintaining separate data access permissions based on their individual identities.In the following sections, we explore how this can be achieved for common use cases, demonstrating the power and flexibility of trusted identity propagation in simplifying data access management while maintaining robust security and auditability.</p><h3>Scenario 1: Experiment with Amazon S3 data in notebooks</h3><p>S3 Access Grants provide a simplified way to manage data access at scale. Unlike traditional IAM roles and policies that require a detailed knowledge of IAM concepts, and frequent policy updates as new resources are added, with S3 Access Grants, you can define access to data based on familiar database-like grants that automatically scale with your data. This approach significantly reduces the operational overhead of managing thousands of IAM policies and bucket policies, and overcomes the limitations of IAM permissions, while strengthening security through access patterns. If you don‚Äôt have S3 Access Grants set up, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/access-grants-instance-create.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Create an S3 Access Grant instance</a> to get started. For detailed architecture and use cases, you can also refer to <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/storage/scaling-data-access-with-amazon-s3-access-grants/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Scaling data access with Amazon S3 Access Grants</a>. After you have set up S3 Access Grants, you can grant access to your datasets to users based on their identity in IAM Identity Center.</p><p>To use S3 Access Grants from SageMaker Studio, update the following IAM roles with policies and trust policies.</p><p>For the domain or user execution role, add the following <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_manage-attach-detach.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">inline policy</a>:</p><div><div><pre><code>{\n    \"Version\": \"2012-10-17\",\n    \"Statement\": [\n        {\n            \"Sid\": \"AllowDataAccessAPI\",\n            \"Effect\": \"Allow\",\n            \"Action\": [\n                \"s3:GetDataAccess\"\n            ],\n            \"Resource\": [\n                \"arn:aws:s3:&lt;region&gt;:&lt;account&gt;:access-grants/default\"\n            ]\n        },\n        {\n            \"Sid\": \"RequiredForTIP\",\n            \"Effect\": \"Allow\",\n            \"Action\": \"sts:SetContext\",\n            \"Resource\": \"arn:aws:iam::&lt;account&gt;:role/&lt;s3-access-grants-role&gt;\"\n        }\n    ]\n}</code></pre></div></div><p>Make sure the S3 Access Grants role‚Äôs trust policy allows the  action in addition to . The following is a sample trust policy:</p><div><div><div><pre><code>{\n    \"Version\": \"2012-10-17\",\n    \"Statement\": [\n        {\n            \"Effect\": \"Allow\",\n            \"Principal\": {\n                \"Service\": [\n                    \"access-grants.s3.amazonaws.com\"\n                ]\n            },\n            \"Action\": [\n                \"sts:AssumeRole\",\n                \"sts:SetContext\"\n            ],\n            \"Condition\": {\n                \"StringEquals\": {\n                    \"aws:SourceArn\": \"arn:aws:s3:&lt;region&gt;:&lt;account&gt;:access-grants/default\"\n                }\n            }\n        }\n    ]\n</code></pre></div></div></div> Now, the user can access the data as allowed by S3 Access Grants for your user identity by calling the \n API to return temporary credentials, and by assuming the temporary credentials to read or write to their prefixes. For example, the following code shows how to use Boto3 to get temporary credentials and assume the credentials to get access to Amazon S3 locations that are allowed through S3 Access Grants: \n<div><pre><code>import boto3\nfrom botocore.config import Config\n\ndef get_access_grant_credentials(account_id: str, target: str, \n                                 permission: str = 'READ'):\n    s3control = boto3.client('s3control')\n    response = s3control.get_data_access(\n        AccountId=account_id,\n        Target=target,\n        Permission=permission\n    )\n    return response['Credentials']\n\ndef create_s3_client_from_credentials(credentials) -&gt; boto3.client:\n    return boto3.client(\n        's3',\n        aws_access_key_id=credentials['AccessKeyId'],\n        aws_secret_access_key=credentials['SecretAccessKey'],\n        aws_session_token=credentials['SessionToken']\n    )\n\n# Create client\ncredentials = get_access_grant_credentials('&lt;account&gt;',\n                                        \"s3://&lt;bucket&gt;/&lt;allowed-prefix&gt;/\")\ns3 = create_s3_client_from_credentials(credentials)\n\n# Will succeed\ns3.list_objects(Bucket=\"&lt;bucket&gt;\", Prefix=\"&lt;allowed-prefix&gt;\")\n\n# Will fail\ns3.list_objects(Bucket=\"&lt;bucket&gt;\", Prefix=\"&lt;any-other-prefix&gt;\")</code></pre></div><h3>Scenario 2: Access Lake Formation through Athena</h3><p>Lake Formation provides centralized governance and fine-grained access control management for data stored in Amazon S3 and metadata in the <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/glue/latest/dg/catalog-and-crawler.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">AWS Glue Data Catalog</a>. The Lake Formation permission model operates in conjunction with IAM permissions, offering granular controls at the database, table, column, row, and cell levels. This dual-layer security model provides comprehensive data governance while maintaining flexibility in access patterns.</p><p>Data governed through Lake Formation can be accessed through various AWS analytics services. In this scenario, we demonstrate using Athena, a serverless query engine that integrates seamlessly with Lake Formation‚Äôs permission model. For other services like Amazon EMR on EC2, make sure the resource is configured to support trusted identity propagation, including setting up security configurations and making sure the EMR cluster is configured with IAM roles that support trusted identity propagation.</p><p>Complete the following steps to access your governed data in trusted identity propagation-enabled SageMaker Studio notebooks using Athena:</p><ol><li>Integrate Lake Formation with IAM Identity Center by following the instructions in <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lake-formation/latest/dg/identity-center-integration.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Integrating IAM Identity Center</a>.

For example, the user can initiate a training job from their SageMaker Studio space, and the job can run in the background for days or weeks regardless of the user‚Äôs activity, and use the user‚Äôs identity to access data and log audit trails. If your domain doesn‚Äôt have trusted identity propagation enabled, you can continue to run training jobs and processing jobs as before; however, if trusted identity propagation is enabled, make sure your user background session time is updated to reflect the duration of your training jobs, because the default is set automatically to 7 days. If you have enabled user background sessions, update your SageMaker Studio domain or user‚Äôs execution role with the following permissions to provide a seamless experience for data scientists:</p><div><pre><code>{\n    \"Version\": \"2012-10-17\",\n    \"Statement\": [\n        {\n            \"Sid\": \"AllowDataAccessAPI\",\n            \"Effect\": \"Allow\",\n            \"Action\": [\n                \"s3:GetDataAccess\",\n                \"s3:GetAccessGrantsInstanceForPrefix\"\n            ],\n            \"Resource\": [\n                \"arn:aws:s3:&lt;region&gt;:&lt;account&gt;:access-grants/default\"\n            ]\n        },\n        {\n            \"Sid\": \"RequiredForTIP\",\n            \"Effect\": \"Allow\",\n            \"Action\": \"sts:SetContext\",\n            \"Resource\": \"arn:aws:iam::&lt;account&gt;:role/&lt;s3-access-grants-role&gt;\"\n        }\n    ]\n}</code></pre></div><p>With this setup, a data scientist can use an Amazon S3 location that they have access to through S3 Access Grants. SageMaker automatically looks for data access using S3 Access Grants and falls back to the job‚Äôs IAM role otherwise. For example, in the following SDK call to create the training job, the user provides the S3 Amazon URI where the data is stored, they have access to it through S3 Access Grants, and they can run this job without additional setup:</p><div><div><div><pre><code>    response = sm.create_training_job(\n        TrainingJobName=training_job_name,\n        AlgorithmSpecification={\n            'TrainingImage': '763104351884.dkr.ecr.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/huggingface-pytorch-training:2.0.0-transformers4.28.1-gpu-py310-cu118-ubuntu20.04',\n            'TrainingInputMode': 'File',\n            ...\n                    RoleArn='arn:aws:iam::&lt;account&gt;:role/tip-domain-role',\n        InputDataConfig=[\n            {\n                'ChannelName': 'training',\n                'DataSource': {\n                    'S3DataSource': {\n                        'S3DataType': 'S3Prefix',\n                        'S3Uri': 's3://&lt;s3-ag-enabled-bucket&gt;/&lt;s3-ag-enabled-prefix&gt;',\n                        'S3DataDistributionType': 'FullyReplicated'\n                    }\n                },\n                'CompressionType': 'None',\n                'RecordWrapperType': 'None'\n            },\n            ...\n        }</code></pre></div></div></div><h4>(Optional) View and manage user background sessions on IAM Identity Center</h4><p>When training jobs are run as user background sessions, you can view these sessions as user background sessions on IAM Identity Center. The administrator can view a list of all user background sessions and optionally stop a session if the user has left the team, for example. When the user background session is ended, the training job subsequently fails.</p><p>To view a list of all user background sessions, on the IAM Identity Center console, choose  and choose the user you want view the user background sessions for. Choose the  tab to view a list of sessions. The user background session can be identified by the  column, which shows if the session is interactive or a user background session. The list also shows the job‚Äôs Amazon Resource Name (ARN) under the  column.</p><p>To end a session, select the session and choose .</p><p>You will be prompted to confirm the action. Enter confirm to confirm that you want to end the session and choose  to stop the user background session.</p><h3>Scenario 4: Auditing using CloudTrail</h3><p>After trusted identity propagation is enabled for your domain, you can now track the user that performed specific actions through CloudTrail. To try this out, log in to SageMaker Studio, and create and open a JupyterLab space. Open a terminal and enter  to list the available buckets in your Region.</p><p>On the CloudTrail console, choose  in the navigation pane. Update the  to  and in the search box, enter . You should see a list of events, as shown in the following screenshot (it might take up to 5 minutes for the logs to be available in CloudTrail).</p><p>Choose the event to view its details (verify the user name is  if you have also listed buckets through the AWS console or APIs). In the event details, you should be able to see an additional field called  that has the user‚Äôs identity.</p><p>Supported services and SageMaker AI features called from a trusted identity propagation-enabled SageMaker Studio domain will have the  field in CloudTrail.</p><p>If you created a SageMaker training job, they are ephemeral, and the compute is shut down automatically when the job is complete.</p><p>Athena is a serverless analytics service that charges per query billing.

With trusted identity propagation, administrators can manage user authorization to other AWS services through the user‚Äôs physical identity in conjunction with IAM roles. Administrators can streamline permissions management by maintaining a single domain execution role and manage granular access to other AWS services and data sources through the user‚Äôs identity. In addition, trusted identity propagation supports auditing, so administrators can track user activity without the need for managing a role for each user profile.</p><p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/f1f836cb4ea6efb2a0b1b99f41ad8b103eff4b59/2025/08/13/ajjaisin-100x115.png\" alt=\"author-ajjaisin\" width=\"100\" height=\"115\"> is a Software Engineer on the SageMaker Studio team at Amazon Web Services, and he earned his Master‚Äôs degree in Computer Science from Rochester Institute of Technology.

We will then implement the interface using object instance.</p><p>We will also need few classes here</p><ul><li>Product: which shows the product of vending machine</li><li>Coin and Note : represent the denominations of coins and notes</li><li>VendingMachine : main class that represents the vending machine</li></ul><p>We will first create state interface, assuming we have struct in place for Product(name, price, qty), Coin (penny, quarter), Note(ten,twenty)-</p><div><pre><code>type VendingMachineState interface {\n    SelectProduct(product *Product)\n    InsertCoin(coin Coin)\n    InsertNote(note Note)\n    DispenseProduct()\n    ReturnChange()\n}\n</code></pre></div><p>Now we will create VendingMachine context struct. This holds products, cash inventory, balance, and current state and provides methods for state transitions and payment handling.</p><div><pre><code>type VendingMachine struct {\n    inventory         map[*Product]int\n        //state\n    idleState         VendingMachineState\n    readyState        VendingMachineState\n    dispenseState     VendingMachineState\n    returnChangeState VendingMachineState\n    currentState      VendingMachineState\n       // transaction/runtime\n    selectedProduct   *Product\n    totalPayment      float64\n}\n</code></pre></div><p>We initialize a new Vending Machine. This creates a vending machine with an empty inventory and concrete state objects (IdleState, ReadyState, etc.). It follows the Singleton pattern to ensure only one instance of the vending machine exists. The snippet also has delegation methods.This means the behavior changes depending on the current state.-</p><div><pre><code>func NewVendingMachine() *VendingMachine {\n    vm := &amp;VendingMachine{\n        inventory: NewInventory(),\n    }\n    vm.idleState = &amp;IdleState{vm}\n    vm.readyState = &amp;ReadyState{vm}\n    vm.dispenseState = &amp;DispenseState{vm}\n    vm.returnChangeState = &amp;ReturnChangeState{vm}\n    vm.currentState = vm.idleState\n    return vm\n}\nfunc (vm *VendingMachine) SelectProduct(product *Product) {\n    vm.currentState.SelectProduct(product)\n}\n\nfunc (vm *VendingMachine) InsertCoin(coin Coin) {\n    vm.currentState.InsertCoin(coin)\n}\n\nfunc (vm *VendingMachine) InsertNote(note Note) {\n    vm.currentState.InsertNote(note)\n}\n\nfunc (vm *VendingMachine) DispenseProduct() {\n    vm.currentState.DispenseProduct()\n}\n\nfunc (vm *VendingMachine) ReturnChange() {\n    vm.currentState.ReturnChange()\n}\n</code></pre></div><p>We can also create few utility methods to set state, resetPayment.</p><p>Now to the main part - \nThe magic happens in concrete state implementations. Each state (IdleState, ReadyState, etc.) implements the VendingMachineState methods. They decide when to call SetState to move to another state. For example -</p><div><pre><code>// IdleState struct\ntype IdleState struct {\n    vendingMachine *VendingMachine\n}\n\nfunc (s *IdleState) SelectProduct(product *Product) {\n    if s.vendingMachine.inventory.IsAvailable(product) {\n        s.vendingMachine.selectedProduct = product\n        s.vendingMachine.SetState(s.vendingMachine.readyState)\n        fmt.Println(\"Product selected:\", product.name)\n    } else {\n        fmt.Println(\"Product not available:\", product.name)\n    }\n}\n\nfunc (s *IdleState) InsertCoin(coin Coin) { fmt.Println(\"Please select a product first.\") }\nfunc (s *IdleState) InsertNote(note Note) { fmt.Println(\"Please select a product first.\") }\nfunc (s *IdleState) DispenseProduct()     { fmt.Println(\"Please select a product and make payment.\") }\nfunc (s *IdleState) ReturnChange()        { fmt.Println(\"No change to return.\") }\n</code></pre></div><p>Similarly other states can be implemented. You can add a demo file to demonstrate the entire functionality by adding products to the inventory, selecting products, inserting coins and notes, dispensing products, and returning change.</p><p>Hope this helps!

From invoices and purchase orders to forms and contracts, accurately locating and extracting specific fields has traditionally been one of the most complex challenges in document processing pipelines. Although optical character recognition (OCR) can tell us what text exists in a document, determining where specific information is located has required sophisticated computer vision solutions.</p><p>The evolution of this field illustrates the complexity of the challenge. Early object detection approaches like <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.02640\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">YOLO (You Only Look Once)</a> revolutionized the field by reformulating object detection as a regression problem, enabling real-time detection. <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.02002v2\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">RetinaNet</a> advanced this further by addressing class imbalance issues through Focal Loss, and <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.12872\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">DETR</a> introduced transformer-based architectures to minimize hand-designed components.

Although OCR tells us what text exists, localization tells us where specific information resides‚Äîa crucial distinction for modern document processing workflows. This capability enables critical business operations ranging from automated quality checks and sensitive data redaction to intelligent document comparison and validation.</p><p>Traditional approaches to this challenge relied on a combination of rule-based systems and specialized computer vision models. These solutions often required extensive training data, careful template matching, and continuous maintenance to handle document variations. Financial institutions, for instance, would need separate models and rules for each type of invoice or form they processed, making scalability a significant challenge. Multimodal models with localization capabilities available on Amazon Bedrock fundamentally change this paradigm. Rather than requiring complex computer vision architectures or extensive training data, these multimodal LLMs can understand both the visual layout and semantic meaning of documents through natural language interactions. By using models with the capability to localize, organizations can implement robust document localization with significantly reduced technical overhead and greater adaptability to new document types.</p><p>Multimodal models with localization capabilities, such as those available on Amazon Bedrock, fundamentally change this paradigm.

By using models with the capability to localize, organizations can implement robust document localization with significantly reduced technical overhead and greater adaptability to new document types.</p><p>We designed a simple localization solution that takes a document image and text prompt as input, processes it through selected FMs on Amazon Bedrock, and returns the field locations using either absolute or normalized coordinates. The solution implements two distinct prompting strategies for document field localization:</p><ul><li> ‚Äì Works with absolute pixel coordinates, providing explicit image dimensions and requesting bounding box locations based on the document‚Äôs actual size</li><li><strong>Scaled coordinate strategy</strong> ‚Äì Uses a normalized 0‚Äì1000 coordinate system, making it more flexible across different document sizes and formats</li></ul><p>The solution has a modular design to allow for straightforward extension to support custom field schemas through configuration updates rather than code changes. This flexibility, combined with the scalability of Amazon Bedrock, makes the solution suitable for both small-scale document processing and enterprise-wide deployment. In the following sections, we demonstrate the setup and implementation strategies used in our solution for document field localization using Amazon Bedrock FMs. You can see more details in our <a href=\"https://github.com/aws-samples/sample-document-information-localization\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">GitHub repository</a>.</p><p>For this walkthrough, you should have the following prerequisites:</p><ul><li>Permissions to use Amazon Nova Pro</li><li>Python 3.8+ with the boto3 library installed</li></ul><p>Complete the following setup steps:</p><ol><li>Configure the Amazon Bedrock runtime client with appropriate retry logic and timeout settings:</li></ol><div><pre><code>import boto3\nfrom botocore.config import Config\n\n# Configure Bedrock client with retry logic\nBEDROCK_CONFIG = Config(\n    region_name='us-west-2',\n    signature_version='v4',\n    read_timeout=500,\n    retries={\n        'max_attempts': 10,\n        'mode': 'adaptive'\n    }\n)\n\n# Initialize Bedrock runtime client\nbedrock_runtime = boto3.client(\"bedrock-runtime\", config=BEDROCK_CONFIG)</code></pre></div><ol start=\"2\"><li>Define your field configuration to specify which elements to locate in your documents:</li></ol><div><pre><code># sample config\nfield_config = {\n    \"invoice_number\": {\"type\": \"string\", \"required\": True},\n    \"total_amount\": {\"type\": \"currency\", \"required\": True},\n    \"date\": {\"type\": \"date\", \"required\": True}\n}</code></pre></div><ol start=\"3\"><li>Initialize the  with your chosen model and strategy:</li></ol><div><pre><code>extractor = BoundingBoxExtractor(\n    model_id=NOVA_PRO_MODEL_ID,  # or other FMs on Amazon Bedrock\n    prompt_template_path=\"path/to/prompt/template\",\n    field_config=field_config,\n    norm=None  # Set to 1000 for scaled coordinate strategy\n)\n\n# Process a document    \nbboxes, metadata = extractor.get_bboxes(\n    document_image=document_image,\n    document_key=\"invoice_001\" # Optional tracking key\n)</code></pre></div><h2>Implement prompting strategies</h2><p>We test two prompt strategies in this workflow: image dimension and scaled coordinate.</p><p>The following is a sample prompt template for the image dimension strategy:</p><div><pre><code>\"\"\"\nYour task is to detect and localize objects in images with high precision.\nAnalyze each provided image (width = {w} pixels, height = {h} pixels) and return only a JSON object with bounding box data for detected objects.\n\nOutput Requirements:\n1.

The dataset comprises 10,000 single-page invoices saved as JPEG images, representing 50 distinct layout templates with 200 invoices per template. Each document is annotated with 24 key fields, including invoice numbers, dates, line items, and total amounts. The annotations provide both the text values and precise bounding box coordinates in JSON format, making it ideal for evaluating field localization tasks. The dataset has the following key characteristics:</p><ul><li>Documents: 10,000 invoices (JPEG format)</li><li>Templates: 50 distinct layouts (200 documents each)</li><li>Fields per document: 24 annotated fields</li><li>Annotation format: JSON with bounding boxes and text values</li><li>Field types: Invoice numbers, dates, addresses, line items, amounts, taxes, totals</li><li>Image resolution: Standard A4 size at 300 DPI</li></ul><p>The following figure shows sample invoice templates showcasing layout variation.</p><p>The following figure is an example of annotation visualization.</p><p>Before conducting the full-scale benchmark, we performed an initial experiment to determine the optimal prompting strategy.

We employed the scaled coordinate approach for Amazon Nova models, based on their respective optimal performance characteristics from our initial testing. Our evaluation framework assessed Amazon Nova Pro through standard metrics, including Intersection over Union (IoU) and Average Precision (AP).

As organizations generate multimodal content at unprecedented speed and scale, document processing methods increasingly fail to handle the intricacies of specialized domains where technical terminology, interconnected data relationships, and industry-specific formats create operational bottlenecks. These conventional (non-AI) processing approaches struggle with the unique characteristics of enterprise documents: highly technical terminology, complex multimodal data formats, and interconnected information spread across various document types. This results in inefficient data extraction, missed insights, and time-consuming manual processing that hinders organizational productivity and decision-making.One such industry example is oil and gas, which generates vast amounts of complex technical data through drilling operations, presenting significant challenges in data processing and knowledge extraction. These documents, such as detailed well completion reports, drilling logs, and intricate lithology diagrams, contain crucial information that drives operational decisions and strategic planning.</p><p>To overcome such challenges, we built an advanced RAG solution using <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Amazon Bedrock</a> leveraging <a href=\"https://www.infosys.com/services/data-ai-topaz.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Infosys Topaz</a><img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/2122.png\" alt=\"‚Ñ¢\"> AI capabilities, tailored for the oil and gas sector. This solution excels in handling multimodal data sources, seamlessly processing text, diagrams, and numerical data while maintaining context and relationships between different data elements. The specialized approach helps organizations unlock valuable insights from their technical documentation, streamline their workflows, and make more informed decisions based on comprehensive data analysis.</p><p>In this post, we provide insights on the solution and walk you through different approaches and architecture patterns explored, like different chunking, multi-vector retrieval, and hybrid search during the development.</p><p>The following are some of the key components of the solution:</p><ul><li> ‚Äì PyMuPDF for PDF parsing, OpenCV for image processing.</li><li> ‚Äì Cohere Embed English on Amazon Bedrock for generating vector embeddings of document content and user queries. A hierarchical parent-child chunking architecture that preserves document structure and contextual relationships.</li><li> ‚Äì <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/opensearch-service/features/serverless/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Amazon OpenSearch Serverless</a> for hybrid search capabilities combining semantic vector search with traditional keyword search (although Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases provides a managed RAG solution, this implementation uses a custom RAG architecture to deliver enhanced value and flexibility). This multi-vector retrieval mechanism with separate embedding spaces was required for maintaining the context between textual and visual data.</li><li> ‚Äì Amazon Nova model for domain-specific response generation.</li><li> ‚Äì BGE reranker, for improving search result relevance by reordering retrieved documents based on semantic similarity to the query.</li></ul><p>The following diagram is a high-level overview of the architecture of the solution.</p><p>Many approaches were used during the build phase to get the desired accuracy. In the following sections, we discuss these approaches in detail.</p><h2>RAG exploration and initial approach</h2><p>The following figure shows some sample images from the oil and well drilling reports. The image on the left is a performance chart of a well drilling operation with the details of the drilling instrument. The image on the top right is of the split sections of the drilling instrument, followed below by the drilling data in a tabular form.</p><p><strong>¬© Commonwealth of Australia [ of publishing- 2018]</strong></p><p>Over a thousand such technical images (including lithology diagrams, well completion charts, and drilling visualizations) were preprocessed using Amazon Nova Pro, a multimodal language model. An iterative prompting strategy was employed to generate comprehensive descriptions:</p><ul><li>Initial image analysis to extract basic technical elements</li><li>Refined prompting with domain-specific context to capture specialized terminology</li><li>Multiple inference iterations to provide completeness and accuracy of technical descriptions</li></ul><p>This process converted visual technical information into detailed textual descriptions that preserve the original technical context.The process included the following key components:</p><ul><li> ‚Äì The textual content from drilling reports was processed using Amazon Titan Text Embedding v2 model with: \n  <ul><li>Fixed-size chunking of 1,500 tokens with 100-token overlap</li><li>Preservation of original document structure and technical relationships</li></ul></li><li><strong>Image content integration</strong>‚Äì The detailed image descriptions generated were integrated without chunking to maintain complete technical context</li><li> ‚Äì The processed content (chunked text and complete image descriptions) was ingested into an OpenSearch Serverless vector database</li><li> ‚Äì RAG-enabled semantic search and retrieval is used across both textual content and image-derived descriptions</li></ul><p>This approach worked well with text questions but was less effective with image-related questions and finding information from images. The lack of a chunking strategy for images resulted in the entire description of each image ingested as a single unit into the search index. This made it difficult for the embedding model to pinpoint exact locations of specific information, especially for technical terms that might be buried within longer descriptions.In the following sections, we discuss the other approaches explored to overcome the limitations presented by each of the previous approaches.</p><h2>Multi-vector embeddings with ColBERT</h2><p>To use a vision model, we created multi-vector embeddings for each image. We then used the ColBERT embedding model for fine-grained text representations. User queries were converted into embeddings, and similarity scores between query and document embeddings were calculated. These embeddings were stored using tensor-based storage, and no chunking was applied. We observed the following:</p><ul><li> ‚Äì We encountered difficulties in storing and managing the complex ColBERT embeddings in traditional vector stores. Debugging and analyzing retrieved documents became cumbersome. Despite context-rich queries, selecting the proper document pages remained challenging.</li></ul><p><strong>Limitations and key learnings</strong> ‚Äì This approach demonstrated the potential of advanced embedding techniques for image-based document retrieval. However, it also highlighted the challenges in implementing and managing such a system effectively, particularly in the complex domain of oil and gas. Overall, the use of vision models enhanced document understanding, and fine-grained representation of visual and textual content was achieved.</p><h2>Fixed chunking with Amazon Titan Embeddings</h2><p>Adopting a more traditional text-based approach, we introduced a fixed chunking strategy. PDF pages were converted to images, and text content was extracted from these images. A fixed chunking strategy of 500 tokens per chunk was implemented. We used Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases with OpenSearch Serverless vector storage, upgraded to Amazon Titan Embeddings v2, and retained the Amazon Nova Pro model. We observed the following:</p><ul><li> ‚Äì The ability to find and retrieve information based on technical keyword searches improved. More focused chunks allowed for a more accurate representation of specific concepts.</li><li><strong>Limitations and key learnings</strong> ‚Äì Providing comprehensive, long-form answers was challenging. Rigid chunking sometimes split related information across different chunks. This approach underscored the importance of balancing chunk size with information coherence, improving our handling of technical terms but highlighting the need for more sophisticated chunking strategies to maintain context.</li></ul><h2>Parent-child hierarchy with Cohere Embeddings</h2><p>Building on our previous learnings, we introduced a more sophisticated chunking strategy using a parent-child hierarchy. PDF pages were converted to images and text was extracted. We implemented a parent-child chunking hierarchy with parent chunks of 1,500 tokens and child chunks of 512 tokens. We switched to Cohere English embeddings, used Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases and OpenSearch Serverless vector storage, and continued using the Amazon Nova Pro model. We observed the following:</p><ul><li> ‚Äì This approach balanced the need for context with the ability to pinpoint specific information. It significantly improved the ability to answer a wide range of queries, maintaining context while offering precise information retrieval.</li><li><strong>Limitations and key learnings</strong> ‚Äì Careful structuring of content significantly enhanced the performance of both embedding and QnA models. The parent-child structure proved particularly effective for handling the complex, nested nature of oil and gas documentation.</li></ul><h2>Hybrid search with optimized chunking</h2><p>Our final approach retained the advanced features of the previous method while introducing a crucial change in the search methodology. PDF pages were converted to images and text was extracted. We implemented a hybrid search system within the Amazon Bedrock knowledge base. The parent-child chunking hierarchy was retained with parent chunks of 1,200 tokens and child chunks of 512 tokens. We continued using Cohere English embeddings and the Amazon Nova Pro model, and implemented a BGE reranker to refine search results. We observed the following:</p><ul><li> ‚Äì This approach combined the strengths of semantic search and traditional keyword-based search. It addressed the limitations of purely embedding-based searches and improved the handling of specific technical terms and exact phrases.</li><li><strong>Limitations and key learnings</strong> ‚Äì This final approach represents a highly evolved RAG system, offering the best of both worlds: the ability to understand context and nuance through embeddings, and the precision of keyword matching for specific technical queries.</li></ul><p>The following are some of the tangible results of the hybrid strategy:</p><ul><li>Average query response time: Less than 2 seconds</li><li>Retrieval accuracy (measured against human expert baseline): 92%</li><li>User satisfaction rating: 4.7/5 based on feedback from field engineers and geologists</li></ul><h2>Hybrid RAG approach and optimization strategy</h2><p>Let‚Äôs explore the key components and strategies that make the final approach effective for oil and gas drilling reports. Each of the following sections outlines the differentiators in the solution.</p><h3>Multimodal processing capabilities</h3><p>The solution is designed to handle the diverse types of information found in oil and gas documents. The system processes both textual content (technical jargon, well logs, production figures) and visual elements (well schematics, seismic charts, lithology graphs) while maintaining contextual relationships between them. This makes sure that when processing a well completion report, the system can extract key parameters from text, analyze accompanying schematics, and link textual formation descriptions to their visual representations in lithology charts.For example, when processing a well completion report, the system can:</p><ul><li>Extract key parameters from the text (such as total depth and casing sizes)</li><li>Analyze the accompanying well schematic</li><li>Link textual descriptions of formations to their visual representation in lithology charts</li></ul><h3>Domain-specific vocabulary handling</h3><p>The system incorporates a comprehensive dictionary of industry terms and acronyms specific to oil and gas operations. Standard natural language processing (NLP) models often misinterpret technical terminology like ‚Äúfish left in hole‚Äù or fail to recognize specialized abbreviations like ‚ÄúBOP‚Äù and ‚ÄúTVD.‚Äù By implementing domain-specific vocabulary handling, the system accurately interprets queries and maintains semantic understanding of technical concepts. This helps prevent misinterpretation of critical drilling information and provides relevant document retrieval.For example, when processing a query about ‚Äúfish left in hole at 5000 ft MD,‚Äù the system understands:</p><ul><li>‚ÄúFish‚Äù refers to lost equipment, not an actual fish</li><li>‚ÄúMD‚Äù means measured depth</li><li>The relevance of this information to drilling operations and potential remediation steps</li></ul><h3>Hybrid hierarchy chunking strategy</h3><p>Traditional fixed-size chunking often breaks apart related technical information, losing critical context in oil and gas documents. The solution implements a hybrid hierarchy approach with parent chunks (1,200 tokens) maintaining document-level context and child chunks (512 tokens) containing detailed technical information. Dynamic chunk sizing adjusts based on content complexity, using natural language processing to identify logical break points. This preserves the integrity of technical descriptions while enabling precise information retrieval across large, complex documents.For example, when processing a well completion report, the system will:</p><ul><li>Create a large parent chunk for the overall well summary</li><li>Generate smaller child chunks for specific sections like casing details or perforation intervals</li><li>Dynamically adjust chunk size for the lithology description based on its complexity</li><li>Implement cross-references between the casing schedule and the well schematic description</li></ul><h3>Multi-vector retrieval implementation</h3><p>Oil and gas documents contain diverse content types that require different retrieval approaches. The system creates separate embedding spaces for text, diagrams, and numerical data, implementing dense vector search for semantic similarity and sparse vector search for exact technical terminology matches. Cross-modal retrieval connects information across different content types, and contextual query expansion automatically includes relevant industry-specific terms. This hybrid approach delivers comprehensive retrieval whether users search for conceptual information or specific technical parameters.For example, for a query like ‚Äúrecent gas shows in Permian Basin wells,‚Äù the system will:</p><ul><li>Use dense vector search to understand the concept of ‚Äúgas shows‚Äù</li><li>Use sparse vector search to find exact matches for ‚ÄúPermian Basin‚Äù</li><li>Expand the query to include related terms like ‚Äúhydrocarbon indicators‚Äù</li><li>Apply temporal filtering to focus on recent reports</li><li>Use spatial awareness to limit results to the Permian Basin area</li></ul><h3>Temporal and spatial awareness</h3><p>Drilling operations are inherently tied to specific locations and time periods, making context crucial for accurate information retrieval. The system incorporates understanding of well locations and operational timelines, allowing for queries that consider geographical and chronological contexts. For example, searching for ‚Äúrecent gas shows in Permian Basin wells‚Äù uses both temporal filtering and spatial awareness to provide relevant, location-specific results. This optimization makes sure retrieved information matches the operational context of the user‚Äôs needs.For example, when generating a response about drilling fluid properties, the system will:</p><ul><li>Retrieve relevant information from multiple sources</li><li>Cross-check numerical values for consistency</li><li>Use reflective prompting to make sure critical parameters are addressed</li><li>Apply the reranking model to prioritize the most relevant and accurate information</li><li>Present the response along with confidence scores and source citations</li></ul><h3>Reflective response generation</h3><p>Technical accuracy is paramount in oil and gas operations, where incorrect information can have serious consequences. The system implements reflective prompting mechanisms that prompt the language model to critically evaluate its own responses against source documents and industry standards. Response reranking uses scoring models that evaluate technical accuracy, contextual relevance, and adherence to industry best practices. This multi-layered validation approach makes sure generated responses meet the high accuracy standards required for technical decision-making in drilling operations.</p><p>To further enhance our system‚Äôs capabilities, we implemented several advanced RAG strategies:</p><ul><li>Hypothetical document embeddings: \n  <ul><li>Generates synthetic questions based on document content</li><li>Creates embeddings for these hypothetical questions</li><li>Improves retrieval for complex, multi-part queries</li><li>Particularly effective for handling what-if scenarios in drilling operations</li></ul></li><li>Recursive retrieval: \n  <ul><li>Implements multi-hop information gathering</li><li>Allows the system to follow chains of related information across multiple documents</li><li>Essential for answering complex queries that require synthesizing information from various sources</li></ul></li><li>Semantic routing: \n  <ul><li>Intelligently routes queries to appropriate knowledge bases or document subsets</li><li>Optimizes search efficiency by focusing on the most relevant data sources</li><li>Crucial for handling the diverse types of documents in oil and gas operations</li></ul></li><li>Query transformation: \n  <ul><li>Automatically refines and reformulates user queries for optimal retrieval</li><li>Applies industry-specific knowledge to interpret ambiguous terms</li><li>Breaks down complex queries into series of simpler, more targeted searches</li></ul></li></ul><p>For example, for a complex query like ‚ÄúCompare the production decline rates of horizontal wells in the Eagle Ford to those in the Bakken over the last 5 years,‚Äù the system will:</p><ul><li>Use hypothetical document embeddings to generate relevant sub-questions about decline rates, horizontal wells, and specific formations</li><li>Apply recursive retrieval to gather data from production reports, geological surveys, and economic analyses</li><li>Route different aspects of the query to appropriate knowledge bases (such as separate databases for Eagle Ford and Bakken data)</li><li>Transform the query into a series of more specific searches, considering factors like well completion techniques and reservoir characteristics</li></ul><p>The implementation of this advanced RAG solution has delivered significant business value for oil and gas operations:</p><ul><li> ‚Äì Significant reduction in decision-making time for drilling and field engineers</li><li> ‚Äì 40‚Äì50% decrease in manual document processing costs through automated information extraction</li><li> ‚Äì Field engineers and geologists spend 60% less time searching for technical information, focusing instead on high-value analysis</li><li> ‚Äì Consistent 92% retrieval accuracy provides reliable access to critical technical knowledge, reducing operational decision risks</li></ul><p>Our journey in developing this advanced RAG solution for the oil and gas industry demonstrates the power of combining AI techniques with domain-specific knowledge. By addressing the unique challenges of technical documentation in this field, we have created a system that not only retrieves information but understands and synthesizes it in a way that adds real value to operations.

But what if you could extend its capabilities even further? </p>\n\n<p>Enter the <strong>Model Context Protocol (MCP)</strong> ‚Äì a revolutionary framework that enables AI models to interact with external tools, databases, APIs, and services in real-time. This integration transforms Cursor AI from a smart code editor into a comprehensive development ecosystem that can perform complex tasks like file operations, database queries, web scraping, and much more.</p>\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  What is the Model Context Protocol (MCP)?\n</h2>\n\n<p>The Model Context Protocol is an open standard that enables AI models to securely connect to and interact with external data sources and tools. Think of it as a bridge that allows your AI assistant to:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>üìÅ <strong>Access and manipulate files</strong> across your system</li>\n<li>üóÉÔ∏è <strong>Query databases</strong> and retrieve real-time data</li>\n<li>üåê <strong>Perform web scraping</strong> and API calls</li>\n<li>üõ†Ô∏è <strong>Execute system commands</strong> and scripts</li>\n<li>üìä <strong>Process and analyze data</strong> from multiple sources</li>\n<li>üîß <strong>Integrate with third-party services</strong> and tools</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>\n  \n  \n  Why MCP Matters for Developers\n</h3>\n\n<ol>\n<li>\n<strong>Enhanced Context Awareness</strong>: Your AI assistant gains access to real-time, relevant data</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Streamlined Workflows</strong>: Automate repetitive tasks without leaving your IDE</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Extended Capabilities</strong>: Access tools and services beyond the AI model's training data</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Secure Integration</strong>: Controlled access to external resources with proper authentication</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Customizable Experience</strong>: Add only the tools and data sources you need</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p><a

The new APIs are available in Kotlin and C++. This code base will decouple from the TensorFlow repository and tf.lite will be removed from future TensorFlow Python packages, so we encourage migration of projects to LiteRT to receive the latest updates. More details to follow.</p><p>As announced at Google I/O ‚Äò25, LiteRT improves upon TFLite, particularly for NPU and GPU hardware acceleration and performance for on-device ML and AI applications.</p><p>LiteRT provides a unified interface for Neural Processing Units (NPUs), removing the need to navigate vendor-specific compilers or libraries. This approach avoids many device-specific complications, boosts performance for real-time and large-model inference, and minimizes memory copies through zero-copy hardware buffer usage.</p><p>For more information on the new repository and to sign up for the NPU Early Access Program, please reach out to the team at <a href=\"https://g.co/ai/LiteRT-NPU-EAP\" target=\"_blank\">g.co/ai/LiteRT-NPU-EAP</a>.</p><h2>Faster input pipeline warm-up with tf.data</h2><p>To help reduce latency, especially the time it takes for your model to process the first element of a dataset, we've added  in . This new option allows asynchronous dataset operations like  and  to immediately start with a specified minimum level of parallelism, speeding up the initial warm-up time for your input pipelines.</p><h2>Changes to I/O GCS filesystem package</h2><p>The  package for Google Cloud Storage support is now optional. Previously, it was installed, by default, with TensorFlow. If your workflow requires access to GCS, you must now explicitly install this package by running: .</p><p>Note that the package has recently received limited support, and there is currently no guarantee it will be available for newer Python versions.</p>","contentLength":2147,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Ruslan Spivak: 5 to 18: Why Your Count Might Be Off by One","url":"https://ruslanspivak.com/bb07/","date":1755617820,"author":"","guid":233410,"unread":true,"content":"<p><strong>How many numbers are there from 5 to 18, including both&nbsp;ends?</strong></p><p>Your first instinct might be to&nbsp;subtract:</p><p>It‚Äôs a small thing, and kind of basic, but this mistake got me more times than I‚Äôd like to admit.

Think of it like building with LEGO blocks - each block (object) has its own properties and can do specific things.</p>\n\n<p>In the real world, everything is an object. Your phone, car, and even you are objects. Each object has:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Properties</strong> (what it has): A car has color, model, year</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Methods</strong> (what it can do): A car can start, stop, accelerate</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>OOP helps us write code that mirrors this real-world thinking, making our programs easier to understand, maintain, and expand.</p>\n\n<h3>\n  \n  \n  Why Use OOP?\n</h3>\n\n<ol>\n<li>\n<strong>Organization</strong>: Keep related code together</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Reusability</strong>: Write once, use many times</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Maintainability</strong>: Easier to fix and update</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Scalability</strong>: Easy to add new features</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Real-world modeling</strong>: Code matches how we think</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  Classes and Objects\n</h2>\n\n<h3>\n  \n  \n  What is a Class?\n</h3>\n\n<p>A class is like a blueprint or template. It defines what properties and methods objects of that type will have. Think of it as a cookie cutter - it shapes cookies but isn't a cookie itself.</p>\n\n<h3>\n  \n  \n  What is an Object?\n</h3>\n\n<p>An object is an instance of a class. It's the actual \"thing\" created from the blueprint. Using our cookie cutter analogy, the object is the actual cookie.</p>\n\n<h3>\n  \n  \n  Creating Your First Class\n</h3>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"highlight js-code-highlight\">\n<pre class=\"highlight

The key concepts we've covered are:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>\n<strong>Classes and Objects</strong>: Templates and instances</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Encapsulation</strong>: Bundling data and methods, controlling access</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Inheritance</strong>: Creating new classes based on existing ones</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Polymorphism</strong>: Using the same interface for different types</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Abstraction</strong>: Hiding complex implementation details</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Remember these guidelines:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Start simple and add complexity gradually</li>\n<li>Use inheritance for \"is-a\" relationships</li>\n<li>Use composition for \"has-a\" relationships</li>\n<li>Keep classes focused on a single responsibility</li>\n<li>Use properties for validation and computed values</li>\n<li>Write clear, descriptive names</li>\n<li>Document your code with docstrings</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>OOP takes practice to master, but once you understand these concepts, you'll be able to write more organized, maintainable, and scalable code. Start with simple examples and gradually work your way up to more complex systems.</p>\n\n<p>The library management system we built shows how all these concepts work together in a real application. Practice by building your own projects - maybe a school management system, a simple game, or an e-commerce platform. The more you practice, the more natural OOP thinking will become!</p>\n\n<p>Happy coding! üêç</p>\n\n","contentLength":0,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"The @dataclass Decorator In Python","url":"https://dev.to/m-nt-s-no/the-dataclass-decorator-in-python-h26","date":1755613403,"author":"Max Montesino","guid":233365,"unread":true,"content":"<p>Decorators: when used well, they make code cleaner.

In addition to providing built-in connectors and plug-ins to connect seamlessly to over 40 popular enterprise systems, Amazon Q Business provides the ability to interact seamlessly with other third-party applications using custom plugins. Some of the enterprise systems that use Amazon Q Business include Salesforce, Zendesk, Confluence, Jira, ServiceNow, and Microsoft SharePoint. With custom plugins, you can integrate Amazon Q Business with various enterprise systems such as ticketing systems, email services, and other business applications, thus facilitating the creation of a comprehensive enterprise solutions. In this post, we explore how to design and implement custom plugins for Amazon Q Business, showcasing practical examples of integrating with common enterprise systems while helping to ensure secure access through <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/cognito\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Amazon Cognito</a> authentication.</p><p>We will build an Amazon Q Business application serving as an intelligent chatbot that facilitates new employee training by retrieving answers from the provided training materials. The solution implements secure API access using Amazon Cognito for user authentication and authorization, helping to ensure that only authorized users can access the system. It can process documents in multiple formats including PDF, DOC, DOCX, and TXT with a maximum file size of 50 MB per document and can index up to 100,000 documents. The chatbot effectively answers the questions posed by new employees by using Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques to enhance its response capabilities. If the chatbot can‚Äôt locate the requested information, it presents a dynamic option to the user to submit an email directly to the training support team through the chatbot using the custom plugins for Amazon Q Business. We include an <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">AWS CloudFormation</a> template for deployment and management of our solution.</p><p>The following illustration shows how Amazon Q Business delivers training content using RAG techniques, stores materials in <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/s3\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3)</a>, processes requests through <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/lambda\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">AWS Lambda</a> functions, and enables user escalations through a custom plugin. CloudFormation automates the deployment of these integrated services, as shown in the following figure.</p><p>The solution provides three key capabilities that work together to create an efficient and user-friendly training support system. These features help organizations reduce support overhead while making sure users can get the help they need. The solution‚Äôs intelligent query handling uses RAG techniques to process user questions accurately and provide context-aware responses from indexed training materials. This capability reduces the burden on human trainers by enabling employees to find answers up to 10 times faster than traditional search methods. According to AWS case studies, organizations implementing Amazon Q Business have seen significant efficiency gains: support tickets have decreased by up to 30% through enhanced self-service capabilities, while employees save an average of 20‚Äì30 hours per month on document search and summarization tasks. The system has demonstrated the ability to handle up to 80% of routine, repetitive questions automatically, leading to 50% faster onboarding and training processes through automated knowledge access. When users need additional support, they can use the dynamic email escalation feature to contact the training team directly with a single click. This seamless integration maintains a smooth user experience while making sure complex or specialized queries receive prompt attention from subject matter experts. Organizations can typically implement this solution within 2‚Äì3 business days using a pre-configured CloudFormation template, which will minimize deployment effort and technical overhead. The architecture uses the elastic infrastructure of AWS to scale automatically, supporting enterprise-wide deployments through its ability to process and index millions of documents across multiple data sources. The solution scales according to AWS service quotas, with specific limits on knowledge bases (100,000 documents each), applications (10 per account), and concurrent users (based on your AWS account‚Äôs service quotas). The infrastructure automatically adjusts resources based on query volume and user demand, facilitating consistent performance even during peak usage periods.</p><p>Use the following steps to set up your training chatbot solution.

By securely connecting to company data sources and systems, Amazon Q Business helps organizations make their institutional knowledge more accessible and actionable. Here are two real-world examples demonstrating how Amazon Q Business enhances workplace productivity and knowledge sharing using the custom plugin feature.</p><p>Scenario 1: New employee Sarah uses a chatbot to learn about the organization‚Äôs leave policy. The chatbot efficiently retrieves relevant information from indexed training materials to answer her initial question. When Sarah later asks a specific question beyond the scope of the chatbot‚Äôs knowledge base, it promptly offers to connect her with the training support team through email. Sarah takes advantage of this option, making sure her complex query receives proper attention without delay. This interaction demonstrates the chatbot‚Äôs effectiveness in providing immediate access to information while maintaining appropriate escalation channels for questions requiring human expertise.</p><p>Scenario 2: Alex, a field technician at a manufacturing company, needs to complete an urgent maintenance procedure on specialized equipment while at a client site. He accesses the company‚Äôs Amazon Q-powered knowledge assistant.</p><ul><li>Alex asks, ‚ÄúHow do I recalibrate the XB-2000 sensor array after firmware update?‚Äù The chatbot immediately retrieves the relevant technical documentation from indexed maintenance manuals and presents a step-by-step procedure with details.</li><li>During the calibration, Alex encounters an unexpected error code not covered in the standard documentation. He uses the custom plugin to request immediate assistance, typing ‚ÄúI need help with error code E-457 on the XB-2000.‚Äù The chatbot offers to email the technical support team, including his location details and equipment specifications automatically gathered from his user profile.</li></ul><p>This scenario demonstrates how the Amazon Q Business solution delivers critical technical knowledge in field situations while providing seamless escalation paths for edge cases that require specialized expertise, ultimately reducing equipment downtime and improving customer satisfaction.</p><p>Scenario 3: A global manufacturing company with more than 5,000 employees implements Amazon Q Business to streamline their equipment maintenance support system across multiple facilities. Maintenance teams use Amazon Q Business to access equipment documentation and when encountering situations requiring vendor support or parts ordering, they use the custom plugin‚Äôs email feature.</p><ul><li>Example interaction: A maintenance supervisor in Singapore enters ‚ÄúNeed to escalate XB-2000 production line shutdown to vendor support team.‚Äù</li></ul><p>The Amazon Q custom plugin automatically:</p><ul><li>Generates a structured email containing facility location, equipment history, and maintenance logs.</li><li>Routes communications to vendor support, maintenance management, and procurement teams.</li></ul><p>This implementation demonstrates how the custom plugin feature standardizes emergency communications across global facilities while making sure critical information is automatically included in escalations.</p><p>To remove the solution, delete the CloudFormation stack you created to test this solution.

I wanted something much simpler: a workflow manager that lives entirely in the terminal, fully keyboard-driven, fast, and with zero context switching.</p>\n\n<p>At first, I hacked together a prototype using plain curses. It worked‚Ä¶ kind of. But as the project grew, I realized I needed something more structured and maintainable.

Building such systems in Python is practical because the language offers powerful libraries, an active community support, and compatibility with modern frameworks. If you are exploring <a href=\"https://www.techavidus.com/ai-development-services?utm_source=devto_bhavik&amp;utm_medium=dev.to&amp;utm_campaign=article_web2.0&amp;utm_id=contentboost\">AI application development services</a> or considering adding AI-based solutions to your business, learning the basics of generative AI in Python is a valuable step.</p>\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  Understanding Generative AI\n</h2>\n\n<p>Generative AI refers to algorithms that can produce new data that resembles existing information. For example, a model trained on thousands of sentences can generate new, human-like text. Similarly, one trained on images can create original pictures. This ability has encouraged businesses to seek AI development services that can integrate these features into mobile apps, web platforms, or enterprise tools.</p>\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  Key Libraries and Tools\n</h2>\n\n<p>Python offers a wide set of libraries that simplify the development of generative models. Some of the most popular options include:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>TensorFlow and PyTorch:</strong> Both frameworks allow developers to create and train deep learning models, including generative adversarial networks (GANs) and transformer-based systems.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Transformers by Hugging Face:</strong> A library that provides pre-trained models for natural language generation, translation, and summarization.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Keras:</strong> Known for its simple API, it is often used to prototype generative models quickly.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>These tools are widely used in professional AI software development services, ensuring that businesses can deploy scalable applications.</p>\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  Steps to Build a Simple Generative Model in Python\n</h2>\n\n<p><strong>1. Collect Data</strong><br>\nThe first step is to gather relevant datasets. For text generation, this could be a large set of articles, product descriptions, or conversational data. For images, you might use open-source datasets such as CIFAR or MNIST.</p>\n\n<p><strong>2. Preprocess the Data</strong><br>\nData cleaning is essential. For text, this involves tokenization and removal of noise. For images, normalization and resizing help models learn effectively.</p>\n\n<p><strong>3. Choose a Model Architecture</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>For text: Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and Transformer models are commonly used.</p></li>\n<li><p>For images: Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are a strong option.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>4. Train the Model</strong><br>\nTraining involves feeding data into the model, adjusting weights, and repeating this process until the model can generate new, realistic data. Python libraries such as PyTorch or TensorFlow make this process efficient.</p>\n\n<p><strong>5. Generate New Output</strong><br>\nOnce trained, the model can create fresh samples. For example, a text model can generate new sentences, while an image model can produce original artwork.</p>\n\n<p><strong>6. Evaluate and Improve</strong><br>\nEvaluation ensures that the generated output is meaningful and accurate. Developers often fine-tune models by experimenting with parameters or by training on larger datasets.</p>\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  Real-World Applications\n</h2>\n\n<p>Generative AI is not limited to research. Businesses are adopting AI application development services to integrate these models into their workflows. Some practical applications include:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>Content Creation:</strong> Automated article writing, ad copy generation, or personalized marketing messages.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>E-commerce:</strong> Generating product recommendations, descriptions, and virtual try-ons.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Healthcare:</strong> Creating synthetic medical data for research while protecting patient privacy.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Entertainment:</strong> AI-generated music, stories, and interactive gaming content.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  Why Businesses Choose AI Application Development Services?\n</h2>\n\n<p>While developers can experiment with generative AI using Python, businesses often prefer professional AI application development services. These services ensure scalability, security, and integration with existing systems. Companies that provide AI development services can build custom solutions, ranging from chatbots to image generation tools, tailored to industry-specific needs.</p>\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  Conclusion\n</h2>\n\n<p>Building generative AI in Python is accessible for developers at various skill levels, thanks to open-source libraries and extensive resources. From training basic models to deploying enterprise-grade solutions, Python remains a reliable choice. Organizations that want to move beyond experimentation often rely on AI application development services to bring these models into real business scenarios. Whether the goal is automating tasks, creating new content, or delivering innovative customer experiences, generative AI built in Python provides a strong foundation.</p>\n\n","contentLength":0,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"The Illustrated GPT-OSS","url":"https://newsletter.languagemodels.co/p/the-illustrated-gpt-oss","date":1755609459,"author":"Jay Alammar","guid":233341,"unread":true,"content":"<p>OpenAI‚Äôs <a href=\"https://openai.com/index/gpt-oss-model-card/\">release of GPT-OSS</a> is their main open source LLM release since <a href=\"https://jalammar.github.io/illustrated-gpt2/\">GPT-2</a> six years ago. LLM capabilities have seen dramatic improvements in this time. And while the model itself is not necessarily a jump in capabilities compared to existing open models like DeepSeek, Qwen, Kimi, and others, it provides a good opportunity to revisit how LLMs have changed in this time.</p><h2>Difference From Previous Open Source GPT Models</h2><p>GPT-OSS is similar to previous models in that it‚Äôs an autoregressive Transformer generating one token at a time. </p><p>The major area of difference in a mid-2025 LLM is that the tokens they generate can solve far more difficult problems by:</p><ul><li><p>Being better at problem solving and coding</p></li></ul><p>In the following figure, we see that main architectural features, which are not a major departure from the current crop of capable open source models. The major architectural difference from GPT2 is that GPT-OSS is a <a href=\"https://newsletter.maartengrootendorst.com/p/a-visual-guide-to-mixture-of-experts\">mixture-of-experts</a> model.</p><p>If you want to understand more about the architecture, we go over it in detail and lots of visuals (and exclusive animations!) in our free course <a href=\"https://www.deeplearning.ai/short-courses/how-transformer-llms-work/?utm_campaign=handsonllm-launch&amp;utm_medium=partner\">How Transformer LLMs Work</a>.</p><p>Using the the visual language we introduce in the course for attention, the GPT-OSS Transformer Block looks like this the following figure.</p><p>Note that little of these architectural details is particularly novel. They‚Äôre generally similar in the latest SoTA open source MoE models.</p><p>For many more users, the details of the behavior and formatting of the model‚Äôs reasoning and tool calls are more important than the architecture. </p><p>In the following figure, we can see the shapes of the input and output to the model. </p><h2>Messages and Output Channels</h2><p>Let‚Äôs break this down by looking at the three main types of users of an open source LLM:</p><ul><li><ul><li><p>Example: Users of the ChatGPT app</p></li><li><p>These users mainly interact with the user message they send and the final answer they see. In some apps, they may see some of the interim reasoning traces.</p></li></ul></li><li><ul><li><p> These builders get to set their own system and developer messages ‚Äî defining general model expected behaviors and instructions, safety choices, reasoning level, and tool definitions for the model to use. They also have to do a lot of prompt engineering and context management in the user message.</p></li><li><p>: builders can choose whether to show the reasoning traces to their users. They‚Äôll also define the tools, set how much reasoning</p></li></ul></li><li><ul><li><p>Power users who fine-tune models will have interact with all message types and format data in the right shape including for reasoning and tool calls and responses. </p></li></ul></li></ul><p>The latter two categories, builders of LLM apps and post-trainers of LLMs benefit from understanding the channels concepts of assistant messages. This is implemented in the <a href=\"https://github.com/openai/harmony\">OpenAI Harmony</a> repo.</p><p><em>(If you find this type of explanation helpful, be sure to check out best-selling book with over 300 figures explaining LLMs at this level of depth, and the <a href=\"https://github.com/handsOnLLM/Hands-On-Large-Language-Models\">Github repo</a> currently at 14K stars)</em></p><p>Model outputs are all assistant messages. The model assigns them to a ‚Äòchannel‚Äô category to indicate the type of message.</p><ul><li><p> for reasoning (and some tool calls)</p></li><li><p> for functional calling (and most tool calls)</p></li><li><p> for the message including the final response</p></li></ul><p>So assuming we give the model a prompt where it needs to reason and use a couple of tool calls, the next figure shows a conversation where all three message types are used.</p><p>These are indicated as turns 1, 3, and 5 because turns 2 and 4 would be the tool responses to those calls. The final answer is what the end user would see.</p><p>Reasoning has trade-offs that advanced users have to make choices about. On the one hand, more reasoning allows the model more time and compute to reason about a problem which helps it tackle more difficult problems. On the other hand, that comes at a cost of latency and compute. This choice makes itself apparent in how there are both strong reasoning LLMs and non-reasoning LLMs which are each best at tackling different kinds of problems. </p><p>One middle ground option is to have a reasoning model that responds to a specific . This is the category that GPT-OSS belongs to. It allows the reasoning mode (, , or ) in the system message. Figure 3 from the <a href=\"https://cdn.openai.com/pdf/419b6906-9da6-406c-a19d-1bb078ac7637/oai_gpt-oss_model_card.pdf\">model card</a> shows how that effects scores on benchmarks and how many tokens are in the the reasoning traces (a.k.a., chain-of-thought or CoT).</p><p>We can contrast this with Qwen3‚Äôs reasoning modes, which are a binary  /  modes. For  mode, they do show a method to stop thinking beyond a certain token threshold and <a href=\"https://qwenlm.github.io/blog/qwen3/\">report</a> how that effects the scores on various reasoning benchmarks.</p><h2>Reasoning Modes (low, medium, and high)</h2><p>A good way to show the difference between the reasoning modes is to ask a difficult reasoning question, so I picked one from the AIME25 dataset and asked the 120B model in the three reasoning mode, </p><p>The correct answer to this question is 104. So both the the  and  reasoning modes get it right. The  reasoning mode takes double the compute/generation time to arrive at that answer, however. </p><p>This underscores the point we mentioned earlier about picking the right reasoning mode for your use case:</p><ul><li><p>Doing agentic tasks?  or even  reasoning might take too long if your trajectory can span lots of steps.</p></li><li><p>Real time vs. offline - consider what tasks might be conducted offline where a user isn‚Äôt actively waiting to achieve their goal</p><ul><li><p>An example to consider here is a search engine ‚Äî you can get very fast results on query time because lots of processing and design already happened to prepare the system for that experience.</p></li></ul></li></ul><p>The tokenizer is pretty similar to GPT-4‚Äôs, but strikes me as slightly more efficient ‚Äî especially with non-English tokens. Notice how the emoji and the Chinese character are each tokenized in two tokens instead of three, and how more segments of the Arabic text are grouped as an individual token instead of letters. </p><p>But while the tokenizer might be better on this regard, the model is mostly trained on English data.</p><p>Code (and tabs, used in python code for indentation) looks to behave mainly the same. Number tokenization also seems to work in the same way, assigning numbers up to three digits an individual token, and breaking up bigger tokens.</p><p>Here are a couple of further readings I‚Äôve found compelling:</p><p><em>(If you find this type of explanation helpful, be sure to check out best-selling book with over 300 figures explaining LLMs at this level of depth, and the <a href=\"https://github.com/handsOnLLM/Hands-On-Large-Language-Models\">Github repo</a> currently at 14K stars)</em></p>","contentLength":6384,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Mw5k!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fef7bcc2e-e402-4a79-ad3e-de80689b1617_1616x814.png","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Why AI-Driven Client Apps Don‚Äôt Understand Your API","url":"https://www.oreilly.com/radar/why-ai-driven-client-apps-dont-understand-your-api/","date":1755609187,"author":"Mike Amundsen","guid":233315,"unread":true,"content":"<p>Recent surveys point to a massive growth in <a href=\"https://www.darkreading.com/vulnerabilities-threats/ai-bad-bots-are-taking-over-web\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">AI-driven bots crawling the internet</a> looking for APIs.

The things that AI-driven API consumers need are the same things that human developers need: clarity, context, and meaningful structure. Yet many companies  aren‚Äôt paying attention. And, as we learned back in 2017, ‚ÄúAttention is all you need.‚Äù</p><h2>Are You Paying Attention?</h2><p>The landmark 2017 paper ‚Äú<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Attention Is All You Need</a>‚Äù introduced the world to the notion of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transformer_(deep_learning_architecture)\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">transformers</a>. In the world of AI, a transformer is a model where words are mathematically scored based on their relationships to other words in the surrounding content. This scoring, referred to as , makes it possible for programs that  transformers (like <a href=\"https://chatgpt.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">ChatGPT</a>) to produce responses that feel remarkably coherent to human readers.</p><p>The ability to use transformers to drive generative AI tools makes it imperative that we all rethink the way we design, document, and implement our APIs. In a nutshell, transformers pay attention to all the content they have access to, but they don‚Äôt  any of it. Even more to the point, GenAI platforms like ChatGPT, <a href=\"https://claude.ai/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Claude</a>, <a href=\"https://gemini.google.com/app\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Gemini</a>, and <a href=\"https://copilot.microsoft.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Copilot</a> can easily  to your API design. They can identify the URLs, the HTTP methods, the inputs, the schema, and the expected outputs. But they can‚Äôt perform any reasoning about which API to use and what the content in the returned body actually .</p><p>Essentially, today‚Äôs AI-driven bots are fast and flexible API consumers that can‚Äôt find their way out of a wet paper bag. The good news is that we can take advantage of an AI-driven client‚Äôs skills at paying attention and add support within our API design to make up for its inability to make wise choices.</p><p>And that is a clear recipe for making your APIs AI-ready.</p><h2>Things You Can Do Now to Level the Playing Field</h2><p>Since AI-driven API clients are going to be good at pattern-matching, recognizing repeated content, and making associations based on context, we can use those skills to fill in the gaps LLM apps have regarding decision making, meaning, and understanding.</p><p>Below are four practices that we already know make it easier for human developers to understand and use our APIs. It turns out these are the same things that will help AI-driven API clients be more successful too.</p><ul><li>: Don‚Äôt assume clients  what this API does.</li><li>: Provide clear descriptions of why and when clients might use the API.</li><li>: The more your API looks like the thousands of others in the LLM‚Äôs training data, the better.</li><li><em>Make error responses actionable</em>: Provide clear, consistent, detailed feedback that makes it easier to resolve runtime errors.</li></ul><p>Let‚Äôs look at each of these in turn.</p><p>Unlike humans, machines are not intuitive explorers. While they are great at parsing text and making associations, machines don‚Äôt make intuitive leaps. Instead, machines need explicit affordances; clues about what can be accomplished, how to do it, and why you might want to execute an action. The classic human-centric approach of designing and documenting an API is captured in this terse list:</p><ul></ul><p>Most humans know exactly what this list is communicating; the full list of available operations for managing a collection of  records. Humans would look in other places in the API design documentation to determine the required and optional data properties to pass for each action as well as the format in which to cast the interactions (JSON, XML, HTML, etc.).</p><p>But machines can‚Äôt be trusted to exhibit that level of understanding and curiosity. They‚Äôre more likely to just make some ‚Äústatistical guesses‚Äù about what this table represents and how to use it. To increase the chances of success and reduce the likelihood of mistakes, it is better to be much more explicit in your API documentation for machines. As in the following documentation example that is tuned for LLM consumption:</p><ul><li>To retrieve a list of customer records use </li><li>To retrieve a single customer record use  while supplying the proper value of </li><li>To create a new customer record use  with the  schema</li><li>To update an existing customer record use  with the  schema while supplying the proper value for </li><li>To remove a customer record from the collection use  while supplying the proper value for </li></ul><p>While these two lists essentially carry the same  for humans, the second list is much more helpful for machine-driven API clients.</p><p>Focusing on being explicit is a great way to improve the success rate of AI-driven client applications. Another way you can do this is to provide details on why an API client might want to use a particular API endpoint. It is important to keep in mind that AI-driven clients are pretty good at guessing  an API can be used but these same LLMs are not very good at figuring out  they should be used. You can fix that by adding text that explains the common uses for each API endpoint.</p><p>For example, in your documentation, include phrases such as ‚ÄúUse the  endpoint to identify the top ten customers based on market size.‚Äù Or ‚ÄúUse the  endpoint once all the other steps in the employee application process have been completed.‚Äù These descriptions provide additional hints to API consumers on why or even when the APIs will be most helpful.</p><p>Note that, in both cases, the text identifies the endpoint by name and explains the reason an API client might use that API. AI-powered clients‚Äîespecially those backed by LLMs‚Äîare very good at recognizing text like this and associating it with other text in your documentation such as the list we reviewed in the previous section.</p><p>The real power behind LLM-based client applications is found in all the documents and code these language models have scooped up as training data. All the books, papers, and source code fed into LLM databases provide statistical context for any new text your API documentation provides. It is the accumulated historical effort of thousands of writers, programmers, and software architects that makes it possible for AI clients to interact with your API.</p><p>And those interactions will be much smoother if your API looks a lot like all those other APIs it was fed as training data. If your API design contains lots of unique elements, unexpected responses, or nontraditional use of common protocols, AI-driven applications will have a harder time interacting with it.</p><p>For example, while it is perfectly ‚Äúcorrect‚Äù to use HTTP  to create new records and HTTP  to update existing records, most HTTP APIs use the  to create records and PUT to update them. If your API relies solely on a unique way to use  and  operations you are probably making things harder on your AI-driven apps and reducing your chances of success. Or, if your API is exclusively dependent on a set of <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema11-1/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">XML-based Schema Definition</a> documents, AI-powered API clients that have been trained on thousands of lines of <a href=\"https://json-schema.org/specification\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">JSON Schema</a> might not recognize your API input and output objects and could make mistakes when attempting to add or update data for your API.</p><p>Whenever possible, take advantage of common patterns and implementation details when building your API. That will better ensure AI clients can recognize and successfully interact with your services.</p><h4>Make error responses actionable</h4><p>When humans encounter errors in user interfaces, they usually can scan the displayed error information, compare it to the data they already typed in, and come up with a solution to resolve the error and continue using the service. That is not very easy for machine-driven API clients to handle. They don‚Äôt have the ability to scan the unexpected response, derive meaning, and then formulate a creative solution. Instead they either try again (maybe with some random changes) or just give up.</p><p>When designing your APIs to support machine-driven clients, it is important to apply the same three rules we‚Äôve already mentioned (be explicit, tell them why, and be predictable) when API clients encounter errors.</p><p>First, make sure the client application recognizes the error situation. For API clients, this is more than just returning HTTP status . You should also include a formatted document that identifies and explains the details of the error. A great way to accomplish this is to use the Problem Details for HTTP APIs specification (<a href=\"https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9457\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">RFC9457</a>) format. This response gives you a structured way to identify the problem and suggest a possible change in order to resolve the error.</p><p>Note that this response also meets our criteria for the second rule (Tell them why). This update failed because a field was missing and that field is . The error report even tells the machine what they can do in order to make another attempt at updating the record.</p><p>Another advantage of using the RFC9457 format is that it helps us meet the third rule (Be consistent). This RFC is a common specification found in many API examples and is quite likely that the LLM‚Äôs training data contains lots of these responses. It is better to use this existing error format instead of relying on one you created yourself.</p><p>Finally, it is a good idea to design your APIs to treat errors as . Most of the time, API errors are just simple mistakes caused by inconsistent or missing documentation and/or inexperienced developers. Providing explicit error information not only helps resolve the problem more easily, it offers an opportunity to ‚Äúretrain‚Äù machine clients by populating the machine‚Äôs local context with examples of how to resolve errors in the future.</p><p>Remember, LLM-based clients are great at recognizing patterns. You can use that when you design your APIs too.</p><h2>Pay Attention to Your AI-Driven API Consumers</h2><p>As mentioned at the start of this article, the things identified here as a way to improve your interactions with AI-driven API clients are all practices that have been suggested in the past for improving the design of APIs for human interaction.</p><p>Being explicit cuts down on the cognitive load for developers and helps them focus on the creative problem-solving work needed to use your API to solve their immediate problem.</p><p>Telling them why makes it easier for developers to identify the APIs they need and to better understand the way they work and when they can be applied.</p><p>Being consistent is another way to reduce cognitive load for programmers and provide a more ‚Äúintuitive‚Äù experience when using your API.</p><p>And making error responses actionable leads to better error feedback and more consistent error resolution both at runtime and design time.</p><p>Finally, all these practices work better when you keep a close eye on the way API clients (both human- and AI-driven) actually  your service. Make note of which endpoints are commonly used. Identify persistent error conditions and how they get resolved. And keep track of API client traffic as a way to gauge which APIs provide the most return for your effort and which are more trouble than they are worth. Quality monitoring of your APIs will help you better understand who is using them and what kinds of trouble they are having. That will give you clues on how you can redesign your APIs in the future to improve the experience for everyone.</p><p>Whether you‚Äôre supporting human-driven API consumption or machine-driven clients, paying attention can pay off handsomely.</p>","contentLength":12006,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/08/A-humanoid-robot-scratches-its-head-in-confusion.jpg","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Building a Mental Health Predictor with Machine Learning and FastAPI","url":"https://dev.to/bekbrace/building-a-mental-health-predictor-with-machine-learning-and-fastapi-3g9n","date":1755607727,"author":"Bek Brace","guid":233318,"unread":true,"content":"<p>Hey everyone, welcome back!

Codequiry specializes in detecting similarities through advanced tools like its Python Plagiarism Checker, providing accurate insights. This post highlights three key signs of potential plagiarism, offering guidance to refine coding practices without sounding accusatory.</p>\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  Sign 1: Unusual Structural Similarities\n</h2>\n\n<p>One common indicator is when code exhibits identical logical flow despite cosmetic changes. The Python Plagiarism Checker at Codequiry analyzes abstract syntax trees, flagging matches in control structures. For instance, two scripts solving a sorting problem with nearly identical recursive patterns and variable scopes suggest reuse. Statistics show this accounts for about 40% of detections, often linked to shared templates.</p>\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  Sign 2: Matches with Online Repositories\n</h2>\n\n<p>Code mirroring public sources like GitHub is another strong sign. Codequiry‚Äôs code plagiarism checker compares submissions against extensive web databases, quantifying overlaps in functions or modules. For example, if a pandas script aligns closely with a tutorial‚Äîeven with altered comments‚Äîit may trigger alerts. This underscores the importance of citing inspirations to maintain transparency.</p>\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  Sign 3: Inconsistent Coding Style\n</h2>\n\n<p>Abrupt shifts in style, such as mixing PEP 8 compliance with irregular indentation, often hint at patched-in code. Codequiry‚Äôs Python Plagiarism Checker detects such anomalies through token analysis. Educators use these reports not as accusations, but as opportunities to encourage students to standardize their style and reinforce authentic learning.</p>\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  Preventive Measures\n</h2>\n\n<p>Running self-checks with Codequiry allows students and developers to address potential flags early.

While a response means the server sends back something.</p><p>An HTTP header consists of a name and a value. Although headers are invisible to the users, they‚Äôre important in transferring information. Yet extra headers could consume bandwidth and affect performance. So it‚Äôs necessary to use them correctly.</p><p>And the server sends a status code with each response. It tells the client whether its request succeeded, failed, or needs extra action.</p><p>He failed the interview, so you don‚Äôt have to.</p><p>Here‚Äôs a summary of what he learned:</p><p>Both requests and responses include these headers.</p><p>It controls the caching behavior of browsers and intermediary caches. For example, caching in proxy servers and CDN. Put simply, it helps to determine if the browser should serve data from its cache when the user revisits a site.</p><p>Here are some of its directives:</p><pre><code><code>Cache-Control: max-age=3600, public</code></code></pre><ul><li><p>It means cache the response in each infrastructure layer for 3600 seconds.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>It means don‚Äôt cache the response anywhere.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>It means cache the response. But the browser must re-validate with the server before using it.</p></li></ul><p>An incorrect configuration of this header might display stale data to the user. Also there‚Äôs a risk of storing private data. Besides forgetting to cache static resources, such as images or scripts, affects the performance badly.</p><p>It indicates when the server sent the response. It‚Äôs used to calculate cache freshness and also debug clock issues.</p><pre><code>Date: Sun, 22 Aug 2025 14:00:00 GMT</code></pre><ul><li><p>It means the server sent the response on 22 August 2025 at 14:00 GMT.</p></li></ul><p>An incorrect configuration of this header will make the cache freshness calculation wrong. Also it'd make debugging harder.</p><p>It‚Äôs added by proxy servers automatically. And helps to track and debug network routing paths. Put simply, it shows the intermediary servers such as proxies, load balancers, and CDN.</p><pre><code>Via: 1.1 proxy1.example.com, 1.1 proxy2.example.com</code></pre><ul><li><p>It means the message passed through  and  using HTTP/1.1.</p></li></ul><p>So there‚Äôs no impact on users if this header is missing. But its absence can make debugging difficult when there are many proxies.</p><p>The client sends these headers to the server to give information about the client or the request.</p><p>It contains the hostname and port number of the server receiving the request. </p><p>Yet it defaults to port 443 for HTTPS if the client specifies nothing. It‚Äôs helpful when the server handles different sites via <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_hosting\">virtual hosting</a> on the same IP address.</p><ul><li><p>It means the request is for the blog subdomain (virtual host) on the server.</p></li></ul><p>The server might return the default site or a 400 error status code if this header is missing. Put simply, an incorrect header will prevent the request from reaching the correct site.</p><p>It informs the server about the client‚Äôs browser and operating system. It‚Äôs useful for analytics, compatibility workarounds, and content optimization (mobile vs desktop).</p><pre><code>User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 Chrome/114.0.0.0 Safari/537.36</code></pre><ul><li><p>It means the request came from Google Chrome 114 on a 64-bit Windows 10 machine.</p></li></ul><p>Some older browsers might receive incompatible content if this header is missing. Also a wrong header might serve incorrect data to the mobile client. Thus affecting performance badly.</p><p>It informs the server of the content format expected in the response. For example, JSON or HTML.</p><ul><li><p>It means the client prefers a JSON response.</p></li></ul><p>The server responds with its default format if this header is missing. And the client might fail to process the response. Besides the server responds with a 406 Not Acceptable error code if it doesn‚Äôt support the requested format.</p><p>It informs the server of the human language expected in the response. Put simply, it tells the browser‚Äôs language preference. For example, English or German.</p><pre><code>Accept-Language: en-US, de;q=0.9</code></pre><ul><li><p>It means the client prefers content in US English. And prefers German only if it‚Äôs unavailable.</p></li></ul><p>The server falls back to its default language if this header is missing or wrongly set. Thus affecting user experience.</p><p>It informs the server of the compression algorithm expected in the response. For example, gzip or deflate. It helps to reduce the response size by compressing it, thus saving bandwidth.</p><pre><code>Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate, br</code></pre><ul><li><p>It means the client can handle responses compressed with gzip, deflate, or brotli (br).</p></li></ul><p>The server sends an uncompressed response if this header is missing. Thus affecting performance badly. Also an incorrect header might create a response in the wrong compression format. And the client might fail to decode it.</p><p>It lets the client send its cookies to the server. Think of a  as a piece of data stored on the browser. It helps to remember things like logins, preferences, or sessions.</p><pre><code><code>Cookie: session_id=abc567; theme=dark</code></code></pre><ul><li><p>It means the client is sending its stored data, such as session ID and theme preference, to the server.</p></li></ul><p>The server might start a new session if this header is missing. Thus affecting the user experience badly.</p><p>It contains the site URL that sent the client to the current page. Put simply, it shows where the request came from. And it‚Äôs commonly used in analytics.</p><pre><code>Referer: https://example.com/page1</code></pre><ul><li><p>It means the request came from page1 on example.com</p></li></ul><p>The site traffic analytics might become inaccurate if this header is missing.</p><p>It lets the client send authentication credentials, such as tokens or API keys. Imagine <strong>authentication credentials</strong> as a password or token to prove who the client is. So the server can allow it to access specific resources.</p><pre><code>Authorization: Bearer eyJhbKciOiJm</code></pre><ul><li><p>It means the client is using a Bearer token as proof of identity to access the server. Think of the  as a temporary digital key for access.</p></li></ul><p>The server responds with a 401 Unauthorized error code if this header is missing or invalid. While server responds with a 403 Forbidden error code if the client has insufficient permission.</p><p>It lets the client download specific byte ranges of a file. It‚Äôs useful for streaming media or resuming broken downloads.</p><ul><li><p>It means the client is telling the server to send only the first 500 bytes of a file.</p></li></ul><p>The server sends the entire file on each request if this header is missing. Thus wasting bandwidth.</p><p>It tells the server to send the resource only if an update occurred on it after a specific period. Put simply, it lets the client make conditional GET requests.</p><pre><code>If-Modified-Since: Tue, 11 Jun 2024 10:00:00 GMT</code></pre><ul><li><p>It means the client is asking the server to send the resource only if it has changed since 11 June 2024, 10 hours GMT.</p></li></ul><p>The server sends a fresh copy every time if this header is missing. Thus wasting bandwidth. While the server responds with 304 Not Modified without a body if the resource hasn‚Äôt changed.</p><p>It tells the server to send the resource only if the client‚Äôs ETag doesn‚Äôt match the server‚Äôs current ETag. Think of  as a unique resource version identifier for a resource. Put simply, it lets the client make conditional GET requests, but much more precisely.</p><ul><li><p>It means the client is asking the server to send the resource only if its current ETag differs from </p></li></ul><p>The server sends a fresh copy every time if this header is missing. Thus wasting bandwidth and affecting performance.</p><p>The client doesn't add this header, but the proxy does. </p><p>It lets the server know the client's IP address even if the request passed through proxies or load balancers. It‚Äôs useful for analytics, logging, and rate limiting.</p><pre><code>X-Forwarded-For: 203.0.113.21</code></pre><ul><li><p>It means the request originally came from the client with IP address 203.0.113.21</p></li></ul><p>While the server only sees the proxy or load balancer‚Äôs IP address if the header is missing. Thus making rate limiting difficult and analytics less accurate.</p><p>The proxy or load balancer adds this header.</p><p>It tells the server the original protocol the client used before the request passed through proxies or load balancers. For example, HTTP or HTTPS.</p><p>It helps the server to generate correct absolute URLs that match the client‚Äôs protocol.</p><ul><li><p>It means the original client used HTTPS.</p></li></ul><p>The server might return insecure HTTP links to the client if this header is missing.</p><p>The proxy or load balancer adds this header. </p><p>It tells the server the original port the client used before the request passed through proxies or load balancers. For example, port 80 for HTTP or 443 for HTTPS.</p><p>It helps the server generate correct absolute URLs for redirects.</p><ul><li><p>It means the original client used port 443 (default for HTTPS).</p></li></ul><p>The server might return incorrect absolute links to the client if this header is missing.</p><p>Subscribe to get simplified case studies delivered straight to your inbox:</p><p>The server sends these headers to give instructions to the client.</p><p>It‚Äôs used by the server to redirect the client to a specific URL. For example, the server sends this header after a form submission to tell the browser where the new resource is.</p><pre><code>Location: https://example.com/welcome</code></pre><ul><li><p>It means the server is telling the client to redirect to example.com/welcome</p></li></ul><p>The client might get redirected to a broken URL if this header is wrong. While the client will stay on the same URL if this header is missing.</p><p>It lets the server store cookies on the client. The client then includes it in future requests. Imagine a  as a small piece of data stored on the client. It allows session management, personalization, and tracking.</p><pre><code>Set-Cookie: session_id=abc123; Path=/; HttpOnly</code></pre><ul><li><p>It means the server is telling the browser to store a session cookie for the entire site and block JavaScript from accessing it.</p></li></ul><p>Each request might get treated as a new session if this header is missing. Also there might be security risks or broken logins if this header is wrong.</p><h4>Access-Control-Allow-Origin</h4><p>It‚Äôs the main header for cross-origin requests (). </p><p>It tells the browser which sites are allowed access to a resource on a specific site. While the browser blocks the response if it's missing.</p><p>Imagine an e-commerce store that uses an external payment service. The store tries to fetch the payment confirmation from the payment service.</p><p>Yet browsers have the  It means JavaScript can only read responses from the same site unless the other site allows it. So without CORS, the browser blocks the response. (Even if the request went through successfully.)</p><p>With CORS enabled, the payment service responds with this header:</p><pre><code>Access-Control-Allow-Origin: ecommerce-store.com</code></pre><ul><li><p>It means allow store‚Äôs JavaScript to read the payment confirmation.</p></li></ul><p>And the e-commerce store displays the payment confirmation data. This approach prevents random sites from accessing sensitive data.</p><p>Think of this header with a real-world analogy:</p><ul><li><p>Access-Control-Allow-Origin header = guest list for a party</p></li><li><p>Payment service = party host</p></li><li><p>E-commerce store = guest who wants to visit the party</p></li></ul><p>If the payment service doesn‚Äôt have the e-commerce store on the guest list, the browser won‚Äôt let it in to see the data.</p><p>This header is added by a cache, such as the CDN or proxy.</p><p>It tells how many seconds the response has been in the cache since it was fetched from the origin server. Thus helping the browser decide if the cache is still fresh or needs revalidation.</p><ul><li><p>It means the cached copy is 120 seconds old.</p></li></ul><p>Each time the cache serves a response, it calculates the age and includes it in the header. The cache freshness is then determined by comparing this header value with the cache-control header.</p><p>While the client might show stale data to the user if this header is missing.</p><p>The server sends different responses for the same URL based on request headers. For example, user-agent, accept-encoding, or accept-language. So there are different cache versions for the same URL.</p><p>This header tells the cache which request headers affect the server‚Äôs response. Thus ensuring cache to serve the right version of a resource to different clients.</p><ul><li><p>It means the server might send different responses for desktop and mobile users.</p></li></ul><p>The cache might serve the wrong version of a site if this header is missing. Thus breaking pages or showing wrong language.</p><p>It tells the client whether the server supports partial requests. It‚Äôs useful for downloading parts of a large media file and for streaming media.</p><ul><li><p>It means the server supports partial requests in bytes.</p></li></ul><p>The client assumes the server doesn‚Äôt support partial requests if this header is missing. Thus downloading the file in full.</p><p>It indicates which part of a resource is being sent in response to a partial request. This lets the client assemble the resource correctly from different parts.</p><pre><code>Content-Range: bytes 0-499/1234</code></pre><ul><li><p>It means this response contains bytes 0 through 499 of a resource that is 1234 bytes in total.</p></li></ul><p>The client won't know the part it received if this header is missing. Thus it might fail to assemble the resource correctly.</p><p>It tells the browser which sources are allowed for scripts, styles, and images. Thus preventing cross-site scripting () attacks. Think of XSS as a situation where a hacker injects malicious JavaScript into a site to steal data.</p><p>A hacker could inject malicious JavaScript into the site through a form or comment box. Without this header, the browser runs the script and lets the hacker steal user data.</p><p>But with this header, the browser loads resources only from trusted sources. Thus blocking malicious scripts.</p><pre><code>Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'; script-src 'self'</code></pre><ul><li><p>It means the site only allows content and scripts to load from its own domain.</p></li></ul><p>The browser checks every resource against these rules and blocks anything not on the allowed list.</p><h4>Strict-Transport-Security</h4><p>It tells the browser to always use HTTPS for this domain for a specific period.</p><pre><code>Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains</code></pre><ul><li><p>It means the browser uses HTTPS only for this site and its subdomains for the next 1 year.</p></li></ul><p>First-time visitors to a site might get downgraded to insecure HTTP if this header is missing. Thus making them vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks. </p><p>So include this header with the maximum age for security.</p><p>These headers describe the content body of a request or response.</p><p>It indicates the format of the message body, so the receiver knows how to process it.</p><pre><code>Content-Type: application/json</code></pre><ul><li><p>It means that the body of the message is in JSON format.</p></li></ul><p>The client might fail to interpret the content if this header is wrong or missing.</p><p>It tells the browser how to handle the response body. For example, whether to display it inline or download it as a file.</p><pre><code>Content-Disposition: attachment; filename=\"report.pdf\"</code></pre><ul><li><p>It means the browser prompts the user to download the file.</p></li></ul><p>The browser might just show the file inline if this header is missing. Thus affecting user experience.</p><p>It tells the receiver how big the body is. For example, when uploading or downloading a file.</p><ul><li><p>It means the message body is 348 bytes long.</p></li></ul><p>This helps the client show accurate progress bars for uploads or downloads.</p><p>The receiver might fail to understand where the body ends if this header is missing. Thus misinterpreting the message.</p><p>It tells the client which compression algorithm was applied to the response body. So the client can decode it correctly.</p><ul><li><p>It means the body got compressed with gzip.</p></li></ul><p>The client might fail to decode the content and show an error if this header is wrong.</p><p>It tells the client the human language of the response body. It‚Äôs useful in multilingual sites to interpret the content correctly.</p><ul><li><p>It means the response is for US English users.</p></li></ul><p>The client might try to guess the language if this header is missing. Thus causing accessibility or localization issues.</p><p>It tells the client the date and time when the resource was last changed on the server. This helps to determine if the cached copy is still fresh.</p><pre><code>Last-Modified: Tue, 11 Jun 2024 10:00:00 GMT</code></pre><ul><li><p>It means the resource was last changed on 11 June 2024 at 10:00 GMT.</p></li></ul><p>The client wouldn‚Äôt be able to make conditional requests if this header is missing. Thus wasting bandwidth.</p><p>Entity Tag (ETag) is a response header. Think of it as a unique version identifier, like a hash or fingerprint, for a resource.</p>","contentLength":17358,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/bd0d0359-c2a8-4267-9a32-393ab47de13f_1280x720.png","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"The

Like maps, ideas and beliefs shape our experience of the world. The notion that AI is somehow unprecedented, that artificial general intelligence is just around the corner and leads to a singularity beyond which everything is different, is one such map. It has shaped not just technology investment but government policy and economic expectations. But what if it‚Äôs wrong?</p><p>The best ideas help us see the world more clearly, cutting through the fog of hype. That‚Äôs why I was so excited to read Arvind Narayanan and Sayash Kapoor‚Äôs essay ‚Äú<a href=\"https://knightcolumbia.org/content/ai-as-normal-technology\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">AI as Normal Technology</a>.‚Äù They make the case that while AI is indeed transformational, it is far from unprecedented. Instead, it is likely to follow much the same patterns as other profound technology revolutions, such as electrification, the automobile, and the internet. That is, the tempo of technological change isn‚Äôt set by the pace of innovation but rather by the pace of adoption, which is gated by economic, social, and infrastructure factors, and by the need of humans to adapt to the changes. (In some ways, this idea echoes Stewart Brand‚Äôs notion of ‚Äú<a href=\"https://jods.mitpress.mit.edu/pub/issue3-brand/release/2\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">pace layers</a>.‚Äù)</p><h2>What Do We Mean by ‚ÄúNormal Technology‚Äù?</h2><p>Arvind Narayanan is a professor of computer science at Princeton who also thinks deeply about the impact of technology on society and the policy issues it raises. He joined me last week on <a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/live/live-with-tim/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"></a> to talk about his ideas. I started out by asking him to explain what he means by ‚Äúnormal technology.‚Äù Here‚Äôs a shortened version of his reply. (You can watch a more complete video answer and my reply <a href=\"https://youtu.be/Q9OHYw7Lyko\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">here</a>.)</p><blockquote><p><em>There is, it turns out, a well-established theory of the way in which technologies are adopted and diffused throughout society. The key thing to keep in mind is that the logic behind the pace of advances in technology capabilities is different from the logic behind the way and the speed in which technology gets adopted. That depends on the rate at which human behavior can change. And organizations can figure out new business models. And I don‚Äôt mean the AI companies. There‚Äôs too much of a focus on the AI companies in thinking about the future of AI. I‚Äôm talking about all the other companies who are going to be deploying AI.</em><em>So we present a four-stage framework. The first stage is invention. So this is improvements in model capabilities.‚Ä¶The model capabilities themselves have to be translated into products. That‚Äôs the second stage. That‚Äôs product development. And we‚Äôre still early in the second stage of figuring out what the right abstractions are, through which this very unreliable technology of large language models ([as] one prominent type of AI) can be fit into what we have come to expect from software, which is that it should work very deterministically, which is that users, once they‚Äôve learned how to do something, their expectations will be fulfilled. And when those expectations are violated, we see that AI product launches have gone very horribly.‚Ä¶Stage three is diffusion. It starts with early users figuring out use cases, workflows, risks, how to route around that.‚Ä¶And the last and most time-consuming step is adaptation. So not only do individual users need to adapt; industries as a whole need to adapt. In some cases, laws need to adapt.</em></p></blockquote><p>We talked a bit about how that has happened in the past, using electrification as one well-known example. The first stage of the Industrial Revolution was powered by coal and steam, in factories with big, centralized power plants. Early attempts at factory electrification didn‚Äôt provide all that much advantage. It was only when they realized that electricity made it possible to easily distribute power to small, specialized machines to different factory functions that the second industrial revolution really took off.</p><p>Arvind made it real by talking about how AI might change software. It‚Äôs not about replacing programmers, he thinks, but about expanding the footprint of software customization.</p><blockquote><p><em>So some people hope that in the future it becomes possible that just like we can vibe code small apps it becomes possible to build much more complex pieces of enterprise software just based on a prompt. Okay, suppose that‚Äôs possible.‚Ä¶I claim that in that world, it will make no sense for these enterprise software companies to build software once and then force thousands of different clients to use it to adjust their workflows to the abstractions defined in the software. That‚Äôs not going to be how we‚Äôll use software in this future world.</em></p><p><em>What will happen is that developers are going to work with each downstream client, understand their requirements, and then perhaps generate software for them on the spot to meet a particular team‚Äôs needs or a particular company‚Äôs needs, or even perhaps a particular individual‚Äôs needs. So this is a complete, very conceptual revision of what enterprise software even means. And this is the kind of thing that we think is going to take decades. And it has little to do with the rate of AI capability improvement.</em></p></blockquote><p>This is a great example of what I mean by ideas as tools for seeing and responding to the world more effectively. The ‚Äúnormal technology‚Äù map will lead investors and entrepreneurs to make different choices than those who follow the ‚ÄúAI singularity‚Äù map. Over the long run, those who are guided by the more accurate map will end up building lasting businesses, while the others will end up as casualties of the bubble.</p><figure><blockquote><p><em>We‚Äôll be talking more deeply about how AI is changing the software industry at our second AI Codecon, coming up on September 9: </em><a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/AgenticWorld/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><em>Coding for the Agentic World</em></a></p></blockquote></figure><h2>Physical and Behavioral Constraints on AI Adoption</h2><p>We also talked a bit about physical constraints (though I have to confess that this was more my focus than his). For example, the flowering of the 20th century automobile economy required the development of better roads, better tires, improvements to brakes, lights, and engines, refinement and distribution networks for gasoline, the reshaping of cities, and far more. We see this today in the bottlenecks around GPUs, around data center construction, around power. All of these things take time to get built.</p><p>Arvind‚Äôs main focus was on behavioral issues retarding adoption. He gave a great example:</p><blockquote><p><em>So there‚Äôs these ‚Äúreasoning models.‚Äù (Whether they‚Äôre actually reasoning is a different question.)‚Ä¶Models like o3, they‚Äôre actually very useful. They can do a lot of things that nonreasoning models can‚Äôt. And they started to be released around a year ago. And it turns out, based on Sam Altman‚Äôs own admission, that in the free tier of ChatGPT, less than 1% of users were using them per day. And in the pay tier, less than 7% of users were using them.‚Ä¶So this shows you how much diffusion lags behind capabilities. It‚Äôs exactly an illustration of the point that diffusion‚Äîchanges to user workflows, learning new skills, those kinds of things‚Äîare the real bottleneck.</em></p></blockquote><p>And of course, the user backlash about the loss of the ‚Äúpersonality‚Äù of GPT-4 drives this home even more, and raises a whole lot of new uncertainty. I thought Arvind nailed it when he called personality changes ‚Äúa whole new switching cost.‚Äù</p><p>It is because AI is a normal technology that Arvind also thinks fears of AI running amok are overblown:</p><blockquote><p><em>We don‚Äôt think the arrival of recursive self-improvement, for instance, if that were to happen, will be an exception to these patterns. We talk a lot about AI safety in the paper. We‚Äôre glad that many people are thinking carefully about AI safety. We don‚Äôt think it requires any extraordinary steps like pausing AI or banning open source AI or things like that. Safety is amenable to well-understood market and regulatory interventions.</em></p><p><em>When we say AI as normal technology,</em><strong><em> it‚Äôs not just a prediction about the future. One of the core points of the paper is that we have the agency to shape it as normal technology. We have the agency to ensure that the path through which it diffuses through society is not governed by the logic of the technology itself but rather by humans and institutions</em></strong></p></blockquote><h2>AI KPIs and the ‚ÄúGolden Rule‚Äù</h2><p>One of my favorite moments was when one of the attendees asked if a good guide to the KPIs used by AI companies oughtn‚Äôt to be what they would want the AI to do for themselves, their children, and their loved ones. This, of course, is not only a version of the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Rule\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Golden Rule</a>, found in many religions and philosophies, but really good practical business advice. My own philosophical mentor Lao Tzu once wrote, ‚ÄúFail to honor people, they fail to honor you.‚Äù And also this: ‚ÄúLosing the way of life, people rely on goodness. Losing goodness, they rely on laws.‚Äù (That‚Äôs my own loose retranslation of <a href=\"https://terebess.hu/english/tao/bynner.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Witter Bynner‚Äôs version</a>.) I first thought of the relevance of this quote in the days of my early open source activism. While others were focused on free and open source licenses (laws) as the key to its success, I was interested in figuring out why open source would win just by being better for people‚Äîmatching ‚Äúthe way of life,‚Äù so to speak. Science, not religion.</p><h2>Why Labor Law, Not Copyright, May Be the Key to AI Justice</h2><p>In response to an attendee question about AI and copyright, Arvind once again demonstrated his ability to productively reframe the issue:</p><blockquote><p><em>While my moral sympathies are with the plaintiffs in this case, I don‚Äôt think copyright is the right way to bring justice to the authors and photographers and publishers and others who genuinely, I think, have been wronged by these companies using their data without consent or compensation. And the reason for that is that it‚Äôs a labor issue. It‚Äôs not something that copyright was invented to deal with, and even if a future ruling goes a different way, I think companies will be able to adapt their processes so that they stay clear of copyright law while nonetheless essentially leaving their business model unchanged. And unless you can change their business model, force them to negotiate with these creators‚Äîwith the little guy, basically‚Äîand work out a just compensation agreement, I don‚Äôt think justice will be served.</em></p></blockquote><h2>AI and Continuous Learning</h2><p>We ended with another attendee question, about what kids should learn now to be ready for the future.</p><blockquote><p><em>We have, in my view, a weird education system. And I‚Äôve said this publicly for as long as I‚Äôve been a professor, this concept that you stay in school for 20 years or whatever, right through the end of college, and then you‚Äôre fully trained, and then you go off into the workforce and just use those skills that you once learned.</em></p><p><em>Obviously, we know that the world doesn‚Äôt work like that. And that‚Äôs a big part of the reason why the college experience is so miserable for so many students. Because they‚Äôd actually rather be doing stuff instead of in this decontextualized environment where they‚Äôre supposed to just passively absorb information for using it some day in the future.</em></p><p><em>So I think AI is an opportunity to fix this deeply broken approach to education. I think kids can start making meaningful contributions to the world, much earlier than they‚Äôre expected to.</em></p><p><em>So that‚Äôs one half of the story. You can learn much better when you‚Äôre actually motivated to produce something useful. In the second half of the story it‚Äôs more true than ever that we should never stop learning.</em></p></blockquote><p>But it is time to stop my summary!

If you're new to these technologies, don't worry ‚Äì we'll break everything down step by step. MCP (which stands for something like \"Modular Compute Protocol\" in this context, though it's not explicitly defined) servers are powerful for building workflows that let language models interact with custom tools. We'll use LangChain to create agents that can call these tools and even touch on LangGraph for more advanced setups. By the end, you'll have a working example of a math-focused MCP server, plus tips on using pre-built ones.</p>\n\n<p>For a visual walkthrough, check out the accompanying YouTube video: <a href=\"https://youtu.be/1pSylZfUnwQ\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Mastering MCP Servers with LangChain and LangGraph</a>. It complements this guide with live demos and explanations ‚Äì click to watch and follow along!</p>\n\n<p>This guide is based on real code you can copy and run. We'll cover setup, tool creation, running the server, and integrating it all with a LangChain agent. You'll need Python installed, along with packages like <code>langchain</code>, <code>langgraph</code>, <code>langchain-openai</code> (or alternatives like <code>langchain-ollama</code>), and <code>mcp</code>. Install them via pip, for example: <code>pip install mcp langchain langgraph langchain-openai langchain-ollama langchain-community</code>.</p>\n\n<h3>\n  \n  \n  Introduction to MCP Servers\n</h3>\n\n<p>MCP servers act as backends that expose tools for language models to use, making it easier to build intelligent agents. They're especially useful in programming environments where you need to handle tasks like calculations, data fetching, or custom logic. In this tutorial, we'll work with two key files: a custom MCP server script (math_server.py) for basic math operations, and a main workflow script that connects to it, adds more tools, and runs a LangChain agent.</p>\n\n<p>Think of MCP servers as modular plugins ‚Äì you define tools with descriptions so the language model (LM) knows when to use them. We'll start with a simple custom server called \"Math Server\" and later explore pre-made options for efficiency.</p>\n\n<h3>\n  \n  \n  Setting Up a Simple Math Server\n</h3>\n\n<p>Let's kick things off by creating our custom Math MCP Server. This server will handle basic arithmetic like addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, exponentiation, and square roots. We'll use the <code>FastMCP</code> class from the <code>mcp</code> package, which you can install with <code>pip install mcp</code>.</p>\n\n<p>Create a file called <code>math_server.py</code> and add the following code. This script initializes the server and defines the tools as decorated functions.<br>\n</p>\n\n<div class=\"highlight js-code-highlight\">\n<pre class=\"highlight python\"><code><span

It starts a process that listens for connections via standard input/output (stdio). The tools are now ready ‚Äì each has a description that helps the LM decide when to call them, like \"Add two numbers together\" for the <code>add</code> function.</p>\n\n<p>In the code, notice how we handle edge cases, such as preventing division by zero or square roots of negative numbers. This makes the server robust for real-world use.</p>\n\n<h3>\n  \n  \n  Creating and Adding Tools\n</h3>\n\n<p>With the Math Server set up, let's integrate it into a larger workflow. We'll create a main script that connects to the server, loads its tools, and adds some custom local tools. These custom tools will include getting the current time and calculating percentages, which aren't part of the math server but enhance our agent's capabilities.</p>\n\n<p>We'll also combine these with LangChain-compatible tools. The key here is using <code>langchain_mcp_adapters</code> to bridge MCP tools into LangChain format.</p>\n\n<p>Here's the main script (save it as something like <code>main.py</code>).

It loads the MCP tools asynchronously, adds custom ones like <code>get_current_time</code> (which uses Python's datetime module) and <code>calculate_percentage</code> (a simple math function decorated as a LangChain tool). Everything is combined into <code>all_tools</code> for the agent.</p>\n\n<p>Run this with <code>python main.py</code>. You'll see the available tools printed, and the agent will process a sample query that chains multiple tools ‚Äì for example, adding numbers, multiplying, and then calculating a percentage.</p>\n\n<h3>\n  \n  \n  Running the MCP Server\n</h3>\n\n<p>Once everything is set up, running the server is seamless. The main script launches the math server as a subprocess, connects via stdio, and initializes the session. You can swap in different LLMs, like switching to Ollama for local runs by uncommenting the line.</p>\n\n<p>Test it with the provided query: it gets the time, performs math using the MCP tools, and computes the percentage locally. The agent's response will show how it reasons step by step, calling tools as needed. If you see output like the list of tools and a final answer, you're good! This demonstrates the server's power in handling real queries.</p>\n\n<h3>\n  \n  \n  Using Pre-Made MCP Servers\n</h3>\n\n<p>Custom servers are great for control, but pre-made ones save time. For instance, install the \"Fetch\" server with <code>pip install mcp-server-fetch</code>. In the main script, comment out the math server params and uncomment the fetch ones. Now your agent can fetch web content ‚Äì try the example query to summarize a URL.</p>\n\n<p>This expands your toolkit without writing extra code. Tools like DuckDuckGoSearchRun (imported in the code) can be added similarly for even more functionality.</p>\n\n<h3>\n  \n  \n  Conclusion\n</h3>\n\n<p>You've now mastered the basics of MCP servers with LangChain, from building a custom Math Server to integrating tools and running agents. We focused on LangChain here, but in future tutorials, we'll dive into LangGraph for more complex workflows like multi-agent systems. Experiment with the code, tweak the tools, and try different LLMs. If you run into issues, check your package installations or the console output for errors. Happy coding ‚Äì what's your first project idea with this setup?</p>\n\n","contentLength":0,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Why Data Analytics Has Become the Backbone of Modern Enterprise Success","url":"https://dev.to/ashwin_pps_365864ef843ec2/why-data-analytics-has-become-the-backbone-of-modern-enterprise-success-6h9","date":1755597821,"author":"ashwin pps","guid":233249,"unread":true,"content":"<p>The digital revolution has fundamentally altered how businesses operate, compete, and thrive in today's marketplace.

In this tutorial, we'll walk through building a Streamlit-based app that leverages LangChain for conversational AI, Ollama for local model embeddings, and Chroma as a vector database to handle document retrieval. This setup allows you to upload a PDF, process it, and chat with it like it's your personal knowledge base.</p>\n\n<p>By the end of this post, you'll have a fully functional app that runs locally (or on a server) and can handle queries about any PDF you throw at it. We'll break down the provided code step by step, explain the key components, and show you how to get it running. Plus, I've embedded a YouTube video tutorial below for a visual walkthrough‚Äîcheck it out if you prefer following along with code demos.</p>\n\n<h3>\n  \n  \n  Watch the Tutorial Video\n</h3>\n\n<p>For a hands-on demonstration of building and running this app, watch this YouTube video:<br><br>\n<a href=\"https://youtu.be/-xlogp3uR0I\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2F9qza3e2ma0lm53r5a4g5.jpg\" alt=\"PDF Chatbot Tutorial\" width=\"480\" height=\"360\"></a><br><br>\n(Click the thumbnail to play the video on YouTube.)</p>\n<h3>\n  \n  \n  Why Build This PDF Chatbot?\n</h3>\n\n<p>Imagine uploading a research paper, a user manual, or a lengthy report, and then asking natural-language questions like \"What are the key findings?\" or \"Explain section 3 in simple terms.\" This app makes that possible without needing cloud services (though it supports options like GPT-3.5 if you want). It's powered by open-source tools, making it cost-effective and privacy-focused. LangChain handles the orchestration, Ollama provides embeddings and models, and Chroma stores vectorized chunks of your PDF for quick retrieval.</p>\n\n<p>This project is great for beginners in AI app development, as it combines web interfaces (via Streamlit), document processing, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). If you're familiar with Python, you can have this up and running in under an hour.</p>\n<h3>\n  \n  \n  Prerequisites\n</h3>\n\n<p>Before we dive in, make sure you have these set up: Python 3.8+, pip for installing packages, and a basic understanding of virtual environments. You'll need to install the following libraries‚Äîrun this in your terminal:<br>\n</p>\n\n<div class=\"highlight js-code-highlight\">\n<pre class=\"highlight shell\"><code>pip <span class=\"nb\">install </span>streamlit langchain langchain-ollama langchain-community chromadb python-dotenv pypdf\n</code></pre>\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>If you're using OpenAI models, add <code>pip install langchain-openai</code> and set up an API key in a <code>.env</code> file. For local models, ensure Ollama is installed and running (download it from ollama.com). We'll use models like Llama 3.2 or Qwen 2.5, which you can pull via <code>ollama pull &lt;model-name&gt;</code>.</p>\n\n<p>Create a <code>.env</code> file in your project root with any necessary keys, like <code>OPENAI_API_KEY=your-key-here</code>.</p>\n\n<h3>\n  \n  \n  Step-by-Step Code Breakdown\n</h3>\n\n<p>The code is structured as a single <code>app.py</code> file for simplicity. Let's dissect it function by function, explaining what each part does and why it's there. I'll include relevant code snippets to make it easier to follow along.</p>\n\n<h4>\n  \n  \n  1. Imports and Environment Setup\n</h4>\n\n<p>We start by importing the necessary modules: Streamlit for the UI, LangChain components for AI and retrieval, and helpers like <code>dotenv</code> for loading environment variables. The <code>load_dotenv()</code> call pulls in secrets like API keys.</p>\n\n<p>Temporary files are handled with <code>tempfile</code> and <code>os</code> for processing uploaded PDFs without cluttering your disk.</p>\n\n<p>Here's the import section:<br>\n</p>\n\n<div class=\"highlight js-code-highlight\">\n<pre class=\"highlight python\"><code><span class=\"kn\">import</span> <span class=\"n\">streamlit</span> <span class=\"k\">as</span> <span class=\"n\">st</span>\n<span class=\"kn\">from</span> <span class=\"n\">dotenv</span> <span class=\"kn\">import</span> <span class=\"n\">load_dotenv</span>\n<span class=\"kn\">from</span> <span class=\"n\">langchain.schema</span> <span class=\"kn\">import</span> <span class=\"n\">HumanMessage</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"n\">AIMessage</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"n\">SystemMessage</span>\n<span class=\"kn\">from</span> <span class=\"n\">langchain_ollama</span> <span class=\"kn\">import</span> <span class=\"n\">ChatOllama</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"n\">OllamaEmbeddings</span>\n<span class=\"kn\">from</span> <span class=\"n\">langchain.vectorstores</span> <span class=\"kn\">import</span> <span class=\"n\">Chroma</span>\n<span class=\"kn\">from</span> <span class=\"n\">langchain.text_splitter</span> <span class=\"kn\">import</span> <span class=\"n\">RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter</span>\n<span class=\"kn\">from</span> <span class=\"n\">langchain.document_loaders</span> <span class=\"kn\">import</span> <span class=\"n\">PyPDFLoader</span>\n<span class=\"kn\">from</span> <span class=\"n\">langchain.chains</span> <span class=\"kn\">import</span> <span class=\"n\">RetrievalQA</span>\n<span class=\"kn\">import</span> <span class=\"n\">os</span>\n<span class=\"kn\">import</span> <span class=\"n\">tempfile</span>\n\n<span class=\"c1\"># Load environment variables from a .env file\n</span><span class=\"nf\">load_dotenv</span><span class=\"p\">()</span>\n</code></pre>\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<h4>\n  \n  \n  2. Page Configuration\n</h4>\n\n<p>The <code>configure_page()</code> function sets up the Streamlit app's look and feel. It defines the title (\"Chat with Your PDF using LangChain, Ollama, and Chroma\"), adds an icon, and enables a wide layout for better usability.

Sidebar Handling\n</h4>\n\n<p>The sidebar is where users interact with settings. In <code>handle_sidebar()</code>, we let users select a model (e.g., \"llama3.2\" for local Ollama or \"gpt-3.5-turbo\" for OpenAI). It stores this in Streamlit's session state for persistence across reruns.</p>\n\n<p>Next, there's a file uploader for PDFs. When a file is uploaded, the app processes it: loads the PDF, splits it into chunks, generates embeddings with Ollama, and creates a Chroma vector store. This is cached for efficiency. Buttons to clear the chat or cache ensure a fresh start when needed.</p>\n\n<p>Key helper functions here include:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>\n<code>get_chat_model(model_name)</code>: Returns a chat model

You test it, and‚Äîvoil√†!‚Äîamazing accuracy! But hold on. What if your model is just memorizing your training data, a phenomenon known as overfitting? This is where cross-validation techniques, like K-Fold and Stratified K-Fold, swoop in as superheroes. They help us build more robust and reliable models by rigorously evaluating their performance.</p>\n\n<p>Cross-validation is a powerful resampling procedure used to evaluate machine learning models on a limited data sample. Instead of splitting your data into just one training and one testing set, cross-validation cleverly divides it into multiple subsets, using each subset for both training and testing in a rotating fashion. This gives us a much more reliable estimate of how well our model will generalize to unseen data.</p>\n\n<p>K-Fold cross-validation is the most common type. Let's break it down:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p><strong>The K-Split:</strong> We divide our dataset into <em>k</em> equal-sized partitions (or \"folds\").  The value of <em>k</em> is a hyperparameter we choose; common choices include 5 and 10.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>The Rotation:</strong>  In each iteration, one fold acts as the <em>test set</em>, while the remaining <em>k-1</em> folds are combined to form the <em>training set</em>.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>The Evaluation:</strong> We train the model on the training set and evaluate its performance on the test set.  This process is repeated <em>k</em> times, with each fold getting a turn as the test set.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>The Aggregation:</strong> Finally, we aggregate the performance metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall) from all <em>k</em> iterations to get a single, more robust estimate of the model's performance.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Here's a simplified Python pseudo-code representation:<br>\n</p>\n\n<div class=\"highlight js-code-highlight\">\n<pre class=\"highlight python\"><code><span class=\"c1\"># Pseudo-code for K-Fold Cross-Validation\n</span><span class=\"k\">def</span> <span class=\"nf\">k_fold_cv</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">dataset</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"n\">k</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"n\">model</span><span class=\"p\">):</span>\n  <span class=\"sh\">\"\"\"</span><span class=\"s\">Performs k-fold cross-validation.</span><span class=\"sh\">\"\"\"</span>\n  <span class=\"n\">folds</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"nf\">split_dataset</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">dataset</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"n\">k</span><span class=\"p\">)</span> <span class=\"c1\"># Split dataset into k folds\n</span>  <span class=\"n\">results</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"p\">[]</span>\n  <span class=\"k\">for</span> <span class=\"n\">i</span> <span class=\"ow\">in</span> <span class=\"nf\">range</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">k</span><span class=\"p\">):</span>\n    <span class=\"n\">test_set</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"n\">folds</span><span class=\"p\">[</span><span class=\"n\">i</span><span class=\"p\">]</span>\n    <span class=\"n\">train_set</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"n\">folds</span><span class=\"p\">[:</span><span class=\"n\">i</span><span class=\"p\">]</span> <span class=\"o\">+</span> <span class=\"n\">folds</span><span class=\"p\">[</span><span class=\"n\">i</span><span class=\"o\">+</span><span class=\"mi\">1</span><span class=\"p\">:]</span> <span class=\"c1\"># Combine remaining folds for training\n</span>    <span class=\"n\">model</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nf\">train</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">train_set</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n    <span class=\"n\">performance</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"n\">model</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nf\">evaluate</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">test_set</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n    <span class=\"n\">results</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nf\">append</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">performance</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n  <span class=\"k\">return</span> <span class=\"nf\">average</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">results</span><span class=\"p\">)</span> <span class=\"c1\"># Average the performance metrics\n</span>\n</code></pre>\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>Mathematically, we can think of the average performance as:</p>\n\n<p>$Average Performance = \\frac{1}{k} \\sum_{i=1}^{k} Performance_i$</p>\n\n<p>where $Performance_i$ is the performance metric (e.g., accuracy) obtained in the <em>i</em>-th iteration.</p>\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  Stratified K-Fold: Handling Class Imbalance\n</h2>\n\n<p>K-Fold cross-validation works great, but what if our dataset has an imbalanced class distribution (e.g., many more instances of one class than another)? This is where Stratified K-Fold steps in.</p>\n\n<p>Stratified K-Fold ensures that the class proportions in each fold are approximately the same as in the original dataset. This is crucial because it prevents scenarios where one fold might accidentally contain mostly instances of one class, leading to biased performance estimates. The stratification process is generally done before the k-fold splitting.</p>\n\n<p>The algorithm is similar to K-Fold, but the dataset splitting is done in a way that maintains class proportions in each fold. Libraries like scikit-learn in Python handle this automatically.</p>\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  Real-World Applications:  Beyond the Textbook\n</h2>\n\n<p>Cross-validation is not just a theoretical exercise; it's a vital tool in numerous real-world applications:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Medical Diagnosis:</strong> Evaluating the performance of a model predicting disease likelihood based on patient data.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Fraud Detection:</strong> Assessing the accuracy of a model identifying fraudulent transactions.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Customer Churn Prediction:</strong> Determining the reliability of a model predicting customer churn.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Image Classification:</strong> Evaluating the robustness of a model classifying images into different categories.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  Challenges and Limitations\n</h2>\n\n<p>While powerful, cross-validation isn't a silver bullet:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Computational Cost:</strong>  Performing <em>k</em> training and evaluation cycles can be computationally expensive, especially with large datasets and complex models.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Hyperparameter Tuning:</strong>  Cross-validation itself can be computationally expensive when used in conjunction with hyperparameter tuning techniques such as grid search or random search.  Nested cross-validation is one way to address this, but increases computational cost further.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Data Leakage:</strong>  Care must be taken to avoid data leakage, where information from the test set inadvertently influences the training process.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  The Future of Cross-Validation\n</h2>\n\n<p>Cross-validation techniques are constantly evolving. Researchers are exploring more sophisticated methods to handle complex scenarios, such as time-series data or imbalanced datasets with complex relationships between classes. The development of more efficient algorithms and the integration of cross-validation into automated machine learning pipelines are key areas of ongoing research.

Well, you're not alone. Hideo Kojima, the creator of Death Stranding 2, has a unique perspective on what's missing from modern gaming. According to him, the key to creating truly engaging games is knowing how to kill people.</p>\n\n<p>Now, before you start thinking that Kojima is promoting violence in gaming, let me clarify. He's not suggesting that games should be more violent or gory. Instead, he's arguing that developers need to understand the art of killing in order to create more immersive and realistic experiences.</p>\n\n<p>Kojima believes that the way we interact with death in games is what sets them apart from other forms of entertainment. He argues that games that don't handle death well are missing out on a crucial aspect of human experience.</p>\n\n<p>\"Death is a fundamental part of life,\" Kojima says. \"If you want to create a truly immersive experience, you need to understand how to kill people. You need to understand the weight of death and the impact it has on the player.\"</p>\n\n<p>Of course, this is a controversial idea, and some gamers may be uncomfortable with the idea of incorporating death into games in this way. But Kojima is quick to defend his position.</p>\n\n<p>\"I'm not saying that games should be more violent or gory,\" he says. \"What I'm saying is that developers need to understand the concept of death in order to create truly engaging experiences. It's not about glorifying violence or promoting a culture of death. It's about creating a more realistic and immersive world for players to explore.\"</p>\n\n<p>So, what does this mean for the future of gaming? Will we see more games that incorporate death in a more realistic and nuanced way? Only time will tell. But one thing is certain: Hideo Kojima's ideas are sure to spark a debate among gamers and developers alike.</p>\n\n<p>In conclusion, Hideo Kojima's idea that games would be better if more devs knew how to kill people is a controversial one, but it's also an intriguing one. Whether you agree with him or not, there's no denying that his perspective on gaming is unique and thought-provoking. So, the next time you're playing a game, think about the role of death in the experience and how it might be handled differently. Who knows, you might just find a new level of immersion and realism in the process.</p>\n\n\n\n\n<p>üìå Based on insights from <a href=\"https://www.polygon.com/hideo-kojima-interview-death-stranding-2-gaming-industry-guns-kill-a-man/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">polygon.com</a></p>\n\n","contentLength":0,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Title: Selenium Syntax: The Correct Way to Send Login Information","url":"https://dev.to/yagyaraj_sharma_6cd410179/title-selenium-syntax-the-correct-way-to-send-login-information-396j","date":1755562528,"author":"Insights YRS","guid":231831,"unread":true,"content":"<h2>\n  \n  \n  Title: Selenium Syntax: The Correct Way to Send Login Information\n</h2>\n\n<p>Are you a Python programmer looking to automate web testing using Selenium? If so, you may have encountered an error when trying to send login information after opening a web page. In this tutorial, we will explore the correct syntax for sending login information using Selenium in Python.</p>\n\n<p>First, let's start with the basics. Selenium is a powerful tool for automating web testing. It allows you to interact with web pages and simulate user actions, such as clicking buttons and filling out forms. To use Selenium in Python, you will need to install the Selenium WebDriver package. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal:<br>\n</p>\n\n<div class=\"highlight js-code-highlight\">\n<pre class=\"highlight plaintext\"><code>pip install selenium\n</code></pre>\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>Once you have installed the package, you can start writing your Python script. To send login information after opening a web page, you can use the following code:<br>\n</p>\n\n<div class=\"highlight js-code-highlight\">\n<pre class=\"highlight plaintext\"><code>from selenium import webdriver\n\n# create a new webdriver instance\ndriver = webdriver.Chrome()\n\n# navigate to the web page\ndriver.get(\"https://www.example.com/login\")\n\n# find the username and password input fields\nusername_input = driver.find_element(By.NAME, \"username\")\npassword_input = driver.find_element(By.NAME, \"password\")\n\n# enter the login information\nusername_input.send_keys(\"your_username\")\npassword_input.send_keys(\"your_password\")\n\n# submit the form\npassword_input.submit()\n\n# close the webdriver\ndriver.quit()\n</code></pre>\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>In this example, we are using the Chrome WebDriver to interact with the web page. We first create a new webdriver instance using the <code>webdriver.Chrome()</code> method. We then navigate to the web page using the <code>driver.get()</code> method.</p>\n\n<p>Next, we find the username and password input fields using the <code>find_element()</code> method. We pass in the <code>By.NAME</code> parameter to specify that we are looking for an input field with a specific name attribute. We then use the <code>send_keys()</code> method to enter the login information into the input fields.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, we submit the form using the <code>submit()</code> method of the password input field. We then close the webdriver using the <code>quit()</code> method.</p>\n\n<p>Now, let's talk about the error you mentioned in your question. The error message \"name 'By' is not defined in the terminal\" indicates that the <code>By</code> module is not imported in your Python script. To fix this error, you can add the following line at the top of your script:<br>\n</p>\n\n<div class=\"highlight js-code-highlight\">\n<pre class=\"highlight plaintext\"><code>from selenium.webdriver.common.by import By\n</code></pre>\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>This will import the <code>By</code> module from the <code>selenium.webdriver.common.by</code> package, which is required for using the <code>By.NAME</code> parameter.</p>\n\n<p>Another issue you mentioned is that using <code>.find_element_by_name()</code> doesn't work. This method is deprecated in Selenium 3.x and has been replaced with the <code>find_element()</code> method. The <code>find_element()</code> method takes a single parameter, which is the locator strategy to use when finding the element. In this case, we are using the <code>By.NAME</code> strategy to find the input field with a specific name attribute.</p>\n\n<p>In conclusion, to send login information after opening a web page in a Python script using Selenium, you can use the following code:<br>\n</p>\n\n<div class=\"highlight js-code-highlight\">\n<pre class=\"highlight plaintext\"><code>from selenium import webdriver\nfrom selenium.webdriver.common.by import By\n\n# create a new webdriver instance\ndriver = webdriver.Chrome()\n\n# navigate to the web page\ndriver.get(\"https://www.example.com/login\")\n\n# find the username and password input fields\nusername_input = driver.find_element(By.NAME, \"username\")\npassword_input = driver.find_element(By.NAME, \"password\")\n\n# enter the login information\nusername_input.send_keys(\"your_username\")\npassword_input.send_keys(\"your_password\")\n\n# submit the form\npassword_input.submit()\n\n# close the webdriver\ndriver.quit()\n</code></pre>\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>Remember to import the <code>By</code> module at the top of your script using <code>from selenium.webdriver.common.by import By</code>. Also, make sure you are using the correct locator strategy when finding the element you want to interact with.</p>\n\n\n\n\n<p>üìå Source: <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/comments/1mf7s97/which_selenium_syntax_is_correct/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">reddit.com</a></p>\n\n","contentLength":0,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Can LangExtract Turn Messy Clinical Notes into Structured Data?","url":"https://towardsdatascience.com/can-langextract-turn-messy-clinical-notes-into-structured-data/","date":1755562177,"author":"Parul Pandey","guid":231845,"unread":true,"content":"<p>Turning raw clinical notes into structured entities with&nbsp;LLMs.</p>","contentLength":63,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Pyker: A Modern PM2 Alternative for Python Developers","url":"https://dev.to/mrvi0/pyker-a-modern-pm2-alternative-for-python-developers-e8m","date":1755562140,"author":"Mr Vi","guid":231830,"unread":true,"content":"<p>Managing Python scripts in production can be a pain.

But not every problem belongs in a channel. Many developers fall into the trap of overusing channels or misusing mutexes, resulting in slow, buggy, or unmaintainable code. In this article, we'll demystify <strong>when to use channels and when to use mutexes</strong>, and why blindly following \"Go concurrency patterns\" can backfire.</p><p>Go's philosophy of \"do not communicate by sharing memory; share memory by communicating\" is often taken literally. Some gophers try to replace every mutex with a channel, thinking channels are the \"Go way\" to synchronize everything.</p><p>But here's the hard truth: <strong>channels are not a free replacement for mutexes</strong>. They're great for coordinating goroutines, pipelines, and events - but not always the right tool for protecting shared state.</p><p>On the surface, goroutines look more elegant, sure - and they are, in the right context. But trying to funnel all state access through channels, even for a simple counter or map, often leads to:</p><ul><li>: A simple counter increment can become dozens of lines of boilerplate channel code.</li><li>: Channels involve scheduling, allocation, and copying, so you're paying extra overhead where a mutex would suffice.</li><li>: Improperly managed channels can deadlock or leak goroutines, sometimes in ways that are much harder to debug than a simple mutex.</li></ul><p>Example: Consider a simple counter that multiple goroutines increment. Using a channel for this can lead to complex and error-prone code, while a mutex would be straightforward and efficient:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Ugh. This works, but it's overkill.

A mutex (short for mutual exclusion) is a synchronization primitive that ensures only one goroutine (or thread) can access a piece of shared data at a time. It acts like a lock around critical sections, preventing race conditions when multiple goroutines attempt to read or write the same state concurrently.</p><p>A  is designed to guard access to a shared resource. If you just need safe access to a map, counter, or struct, a mutex is often simpler and faster.</p><p>Imagine you're maintaining a cache that multiple goroutines need to read and update. A  is the simplest and most efficient way to guard that shared map:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><ul><li>Explicit locking makes reasoning about shared state straightforward.</li></ul><ul><li>Can be less elegant in complex pipelines or fan-out/fan-in patterns.</li></ul><div><table><tbody><tr><td>Protect a counter, map, or struct</td></tr><tr><td>Implement a worker pool, pipeline, or event queue</td></tr><tr><td>Single producer ‚Üí single consumer</td></tr><tr><td>Multiple goroutines updating the same state</td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>Rule of thumb: <strong>Use mutexes for shared state, channels for communication</strong>.</p><p>Benchmarks often surprise Go devs. Simple state mutations protected by mutexes are usually orders of magnitude faster than channel-based approaches because channels involve allocation, scheduling, and copying:</p><ul><li>Mutexes are extremely lightweight. They‚Äôre implemented in Go‚Äôs runtime using efficient atomic operations. Locking and unlocking often cost only a few nanoseconds.</li><li>Channels, on the other hand, involve more moving parts. Sending or receiving on a channel may trigger:\n\n<ul><li>Memory allocation for the buffered/unbuffered queue.</li><li>Scheduling of waiting goroutines.</li><li>Potential context switching if the receiver isn't ready.</li></ul></li></ul><p>That extra bookkeeping makes channels slower when all you need is to guard a shared variable.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Benchmark: Mutex vs Channel Counter\n</h3><p>Let's put this to the test with Go's benchmarking framework:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>And here‚Äôs an example of what the results might look like on a typical laptop (Go 1.23, 8-core CPU):</p><div><pre><code>BenchmarkMutexCounter-8      1000000000   0.8 ns/op\nBenchmarkChannelCounter-8     20000000    60 ns/op\n</code></pre></div><p>Now obviously real-world workloads might slightly differ from synthetic benchmarks (e.g., context switches, OS scheduling etc.) but that's a <strong>~75√ó performance difference in favor of the mutex</strong>!</p><p>So why the huge gap? The mutex path is just an atomic operation to acquire/release the lock. The channel path involves synchronization between two goroutines, queue management, and possibly waking up a sleeping goroutine.</p><p>This demonstrates why mutexes are the right tool for protecting simple shared state.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  1. Web Server Request Counting\n</h3><p>Imagine you're running an HTTP server and want to count requests:</p><ul><li>Mutex version: Fast, scalable, and works fine under load.</li><li>Channel version: Every request handler has to ship a message through a channel, creating a bottleneck and slowing down throughput.</li></ul><p>In production, that's the difference between comfortably handling 100k requests/sec and falling behind at 10k requests/sec.</p><p>If multiple goroutines read and write a cache (like map[string]User), a mutex is perfect. Reads and writes happen inline with minimal cost.</p><p>With a channel-based \"cache manager goroutine\", every single read/write becomes a request‚Äìresponse round trip. Instead of O(1) map lookups, you now have O(1) + channel send/receive + scheduling. This introduces latency and makes your cache slower than just hitting the database in some cases.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  3. Worker Pool for Task Processing\n</h3><p>With a mutex you could have a slice of tasks, protect it with a sync.Mutex, and have multiple goroutines pull work out of it. Each goroutine locks, pops a task, unlocks, processes, and repeats.</p><p>But with channels, you can just push tasks into a job channel, spin up N workers, and let them consume concurrently:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Here, channels are a natural fit because the problem is work distribution, not just shared memory safety.</p><p>Using a mutex would require writing your own coordination logic, which is more error-prone and less readable.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  4. Event Notifications / Pub-Sub\n</h3><p>With a mutex, you could maintain a slice of subscribers guarded by a mutex. Every time an event happens, you'd lock, loop over subscribers, and call their handler functions. This works, but it mixes synchronization, iteration, and business logic.</p><p>Why goroutines + channels are better: channels let you decouple event production from consumption. Each subscriber can listen on its own channel and handle events at its own pace:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Now you can spin up independent goroutines for each subscriber:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>With goroutines + channels, events flow asynchronously, subscribers don't block each other, and backpressure (buffered/unbuffered channels) is easy to model.</p><p>Doing the same with a mutex-based subscriber list quickly becomes messy, especially if one subscriber is slow or blocks.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Other Concurrency Primitives in Go\n</h2><p>While mutexes and channels are the most common tools, Go's standard library includes a few other primitives worth knowing:</p><ul><li><p>: A variation of  that allows multiple readers to hold the lock simultaneously, but only one writer at a time. Useful for read-heavy workloads like caches.</p></li><li><p>: A condition variable that lets goroutines wait until a certain condition is met. More advanced than channels, but sometimes useful for implementing custom coordination patterns.</p></li><li><p>: Ensures a piece of code runs only once, even if called from multiple goroutines. Commonly used for lazy initialization.</p></li><li><p>: Waits for a collection of goroutines to finish. Perfect for spawning workers and waiting for them to complete before moving on.</p></li><li><p>: Provides low-level atomic operations (like atomic.AddInt64) for lock-free access to basic types. Often the fastest solution for counters and flags.</p></li></ul><p>These tools complement mutexes and channels. For example, you might use a  to wait for a batch of goroutines to finish processing before sending a final result on a channel.</p><p>Or the counter example with  for lock-free incrementing:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>This is often the fastest option for simple counters and flags because it avoids lock contention altogether.</p><p>If we extend our benchmark from above:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>The results would be something like this:</p><div><pre><code>BenchmarkAtomicCounter-8    1000000000   0.3 ns/op\nBenchmarkMutexCounter-8     1000000000   0.8 ns/op\nBenchmarkChannelCounter-8     20000000   60 ns/op\n</code></pre></div><p>Notice how atomic operations are ~2‚Äì3√ó faster than mutexes, while channels are orders of magnitude slower for this use case. It's a shame atomic operations are extremely limited: they only work on individual variables and basic types.</p><p>Mutexes are perfect for protecting state. Channels shine when you need to coordinate or distribute work/events.</p><p>But many Go developers try to force channels into every concurrency problem because they feel more \"idiomatic.\" In reality, channels are not inherently better than mutexes. They're tools for communication, not a silver bullet. It's also important to note that <strong>channels and mutexes are not mutually exclusive</strong> - sometimes you'll combine them (e.g., worker pool with channel + shared stats protected by mutex). Think of channels as \"communication highways\" and mutexes as \"traffic lights\" for shared memory - each has its place.</p><p>Overusing channels is a common beginner trap and leads to code that is harder to read, slower to run, and more error-prone ‚Äî the exact opposite of Go's philosophy of simplicity. Just don't overthink it: <strong>mutexes for state, channels for communication</strong>.</p>","contentLength":9458,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Show HN: Fractional jobs ‚Äì part-time roles for engineers","url":"https://www.fractionaljobs.io/","date":1755551439,"author":"tbird24","guid":231819,"unread":true,"content":"<div>Fractional work is part-time work, typically paid on a monthly retainer, by experts in their field.

How long do responses take? Where are the bottlenecks? Which conversations fail, and why?</p>\n\n<p>Without proper <strong>Observability</strong>, you're flying blind. Your agents might be hallucinating, performing poorly, or wasting computational resources, and you won't know until users complain.</p>\n\n<h3>\n  \n  \n  Observability Components\n</h3>\n\n<p>The Strands Agents SDK includes all observability APIs.

Travelers must book accommodations, plan activities, and arrange local transportation. All these decisions can feel overwhelming. Although travel professionals have long helped manage these complexities, recent breakthroughs in <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/generative-ai/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">generative AI</a> have made something entirely new possible‚Äîintelligent assistants that can understand natural conversation, access real-time data, and directly interface with booking systems and travel tools. <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/ai-agents/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Agentic workflows</a>, which use large language models (LLMs) with access to external tools, are particularly promising for simplifying dynamic, multi-step processes like travel planning.</p><p>In this post, we explore how to build a travel planning solution using AI agents. The agent uses <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/ai/generative-ai/nova/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Amazon Nova</a>, which offers an optimal balance of performance and cost compared to other commercial LLMs. By combining accurate but cost-efficient Amazon Nova models with <a href=\"https://www.langchain.com/langgraph\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">LangGraph</a> orchestration capabilities, we create a practical travel assistant that can handle complex planning tasks while keeping operational costs manageable for production deployments.</p><p>Our solution is built on a serverless <a href=\"http://aws.amazon.com/lambda\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">AWS Lambda</a> architecture using <a href=\"https://www.docker.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Docker</a> containers and implements a comprehensive three-layer approach: frontend interaction, core processing, and integration services. In the core processing layer, we use LangGraph, a stateful orchestration framework, to create a sophisticated yet flexible agent-based system that manages the complex interactions required for travel planning.</p><p>The core of our system is a graph architecture where components (nodes) handle distinct aspects of travel planning, with the router node orchestrating the flow of information between them. We use Amazon Nova, a new generation of state-of-the-art foundation models (FMs) available exclusively on <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Amazon Bedrock</a> that delivers frontier intelligence with industry-leading price-performance. The router node uses an LLM to analyze each user query and, with access to the description of our 14 action nodes, decides which ones need to be executed. The action nodes, each with their own LLM chain, powered by either Amazon Nova Pro or Amazon Nova Lite models, manage various functions, including web research, personalized recommendations, weather lookups, product searches, and shopping cart management.</p><p>We use Amazon Nova Lite for the router and simpler action nodes. It can handle query analysis and basic content generation with its lightning-fast processing while maintaining strong accuracy at a low cost. Five complex nodes use Amazon Nova Pro for tasks requiring advanced instruction following and multi-step operations, such as detailed travel planning and recommendations. Both models support a 300,000-token context window and can process text, image, and video inputs. The models support text processing across more than 200 languages, helping our travel assistant serve a global audience.The integration layer unifies multiple data sources and services through an interface:</p><p>These integrations serve as examples, and the architecture is designed to be extensible, so organizations can quickly incorporate their own APIs and data sources based on specific requirements.</p><p>The agent keeps track of the conversation state using AgentState (<a href=\"https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/typed_dict.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">TypedDict</a>), a special Python dictionary that helps prevent data errors by enforcing specific data types. It stores the information we need to know about each user‚Äôs session: their conversation history, profile information, processing status, and final outputs. This makes sure the different action nodes can access and update information reliably.</p><p>The following diagram illustrates the solution architecture.</p><p>The travel assistant processes user interactions from end to end:</p><ol><li>Users interact with a React.js web application through a chat interface.</li><li>Authenticated requests are sent to our backend <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Lambda functions</a>, which host the core agent workflow.</li><li>API credentials are securely stored using <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/secrets-manager/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">AWS Secrets Manager</a>, following best practices to make sure these sensitive keys are never exposed in code or configuration files, with appropriate access controls and rotation policies implemented.</li><li>The Travel Assistant Agent itself consists of several interconnected components. At the center, the agent router analyzes incoming queries and orchestrates the workflow.</li><li>The agent maintains state through three DynamoDB tables that store conversation history, shopping wishlists, and user profiles, making sure context is preserved across interactions.</li><li>The agent‚Äôs action nodes handle specialized tasks by combining LLM chains with external APIs. When users need product recommendations, the system connects to the Amazon Product Advertising API. For general travel information, it uses the Google Custom Search API, and for weather-related queries, it consults the OpenWeather API. API credentials are securely managed through Secrets Manager.</li><li>The system formulates comprehensive responses based on collected information, and the final responses are returned to the user through the chat interface.</li></ol><p>This architecture supports both simple queries that can be handled by a single node and complex multi-step interactions that require coordination across multiple components. The system can scale horizontally, and new capabilities can be added by introducing additional action nodes and API integrations.</p><p>You can deploy this solution using the <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/cdk/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">AWS Cloud Development Kit</a> (AWS CDK), which generates an <a href=\"http://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">AWS CloudFormation</a> template that handles the necessary resources, including Lambda functions, DynamoDB tables, and API configurations. The deployment creates the required AWS resources and outputs the API endpoint URL for your frontend application.</p><p>For this walkthrough, you must have the following prerequisites:</p><p>Start by cloning the GitHub repository containing the solution files:</p><div><pre><code>git clone https://github.com/aws-samples/sample-travel-assistant-agent.git</code></pre></div><p>The solution requires API keys from three services to enable its core functionalities:</p><ul><li> ‚Äì Create a Free Access account at <a href=\"https://openweathermap.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">OpenWeather</a> to obtain your API key. The free tier (60 calls per minute) is sufficient for testing and development.</li><li> ‚Äì Set up the search functionality through <a href=\"https://console.cloud.google.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Google Cloud Console</a>. Create or select a project and enable the Custom Search API. Then, generate an API key from the credentials section. Create a search engine at <a href=\"https://programmablesearch.google.com/controlpanel/all\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Programmable Search</a> and note your Search Engine ID. The free tier includes 100 queries per day.</li><li><strong>(Optional) Amazon Product Advertising API (PAAPI) </strong>‚Äì If you want to enable product recommendations, access the <a href=\"https://webservices.amazon.com/paapi5/documentation/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">PAAPI Documentation Portal</a> to generate your API keys. You will receive both a public key and a secret key. You must have an Amazon Associates account to access these credentials. If you‚Äôre new to the Amazon Associates Program, complete the application process first. Skip this step if you don‚Äôt want to use PAAPI features.</li></ul><h2>Add API keys to Secrets Manager</h2><p>Before deploying the solution, you must securely store your API keys in Secrets Manager. The following table lists the secrets to create and their JSON structure.

We focused on routing, function calling accuracy, response quality, and latency metrics. The agent‚Äôs routing system directs the user questions to the appropriate specialized node (for example, searching for accommodations, checking weather conditions, or suggesting travel products). Throughout the conversation, the agent maintains the context of previously discussed details, so it can build upon earlier responses while providing relevant new information. For example, after discussing travel destination, the agent can naturally incorporate this into subsequent weather and packing list recommendations.</p><p>The following screenshots demonstrate the end-user experience, while the underlying API interactions are handled seamlessly on the backend. The complete implementation details, including Lambda function code and API integration patterns, are available in our <a href=\"https://github.com/aws-samples/sample-travel-assistant-agent/tree/main\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">GitHub repository</a>.</p><p>The solution demonstrates personalization capabilities using sample user profiles stored in DynamoDB, containing upcoming trips and travel preferences. In production deployments, these profiles can be integrated with existing customer databases and reservation systems to provide a personalized assistance.</p><p>The product recommendations shown are live links to actual items available on Amazon.com, so the user can explore or purchase these products directly. The user can choose a link to check out the product, or choose  to see the items in their shopping cart.</p><p>After you are done experimenting with the travel assistant, you can locate the CloudFormation stack on the AWS CloudFormation console and delete it. This will delete the resources you created.</p><p>Our travel planning assistant agent demonstrates a practical application built by Amazon Nova and LangGraph for solving real-world business challenges. The system streamlines complex travel planning while naturally integrating product recommendations through specialized processing nodes and real-time data integration. Amazon Nova Lite models showed reasonable performance at task orchestration, and Amazon Nova Pro performed well for more complex function calling operations. Looking ahead, this framework could be implemented with more dynamic orchestration systems such as ReAct.

One day you're celebrating your first \"Hello, World!\" program, and the next you're staring at decorators, context managers, and metaclasses wondering if you'll ever truly understand this language. The good news? Every Python expert started exactly where you are now.</p>\n\n<p>The challenge isn't that Python is impossibly difficult‚Äîit's that most learners approach it without a clear roadmap for progressing from basic syntax to professional-level skills.</p>\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  Why Python Learning Gets Stuck\n</h2>\n\n<p>Most Python learners hit predictable roadblocks. They master the basics quickly‚Äîvariables, loops, functions‚Äîbut struggle when moving beyond simple scripts. The jump from \"I can write code\" to \"I can solve complex problems\" feels impossibly wide.</p>\n\n<p>This happens because traditional learning resources focus heavily on teaching concepts but provide little practice with recognizing when and how to apply them. You might understand what a dictionary comprehension does, but struggle to identify situations where it's the best solution.</p>\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  Building Real Python Fluency\n</h2>\n\n<p>True Python fluency comes from pattern recognition‚Äîthe ability to quickly identify which tools and approaches fit different programming challenges. This develops through repeated exposure to varied problems and immediate feedback on your solutions.</p>\n\n<p>The most effective learning combines multiple approaches: reading quality code, building projects, studying documentation, and‚Äîcrucially‚Äîtesting your knowledge in structured ways that reveal gaps in understanding.</p>\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  Essential Resources for Python Growth\n</h2>\n\n<p><strong>Official Documentation</strong>: <a href=\"https://docs.python.org/3/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Python's documentation</a> is exceptionally well-written. Don't just reference it when stuck‚Äîread through modules you haven't explored. The <a href=\"https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">collections</a>, <a href=\"https://docs.python.org/3/library/itertools.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">itertools</a>, and <a href=\"https://docs.python.org/3/library/functools.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">functools</a> modules contain tools that will make your code more elegant and efficient.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Project-Based Learning</strong>: Build something you actually want to use. Whether it's automating a tedious task, analyzing data you care about, or creating a simple web application, projects force you to connect concepts in meaningful ways.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Code Reading</strong>: Study repositories like <a href=\"https://github.com/pallets/flask\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Flask</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/psf/requests\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Requests</a>, or <a href=\"https://github.com/Textualize/rich\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Rich</a> on <a href=\"https://github.com/topics/python\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">GitHub</a>. Notice how they handle imports, error cases, and API design. Reading production code reveals patterns you won't find in tutorials.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Community Engagement</strong>: Participate in Python communities like <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">r/Python</a>, <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/python\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Stack Overflow</a>, or <a href=\"https://www.meetup.com/topics/python/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">local Python meetups</a>. Helping others debug their code reinforces your own understanding while exposing you to different problem-solving approaches.</p>\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  Testing Your Knowledge Systematically\n</h2>\n\n<p>One often-overlooked aspect of Python learning is systematic knowledge assessment. While building projects shows you can implement solutions, it doesn't reveal knowledge gaps or help you understand why certain approaches work better than others.</p>\n\n<p>Multiple-choice questions might seem simplistic, but they're remarkably effective at identifying misconceptions and reinforcing correct understanding. The best quiz questions don't just test memorization‚Äîthey present realistic scenarios that require applying Python concepts in context.</p>\n\n<p>A comprehensive quiz covering beginner through advanced topics serves as both diagnostic tool and learning accelerator. Well-designed questions reveal not just what you know, but how you think about problems. Consider this scenario: given a list of dictionaries representing sales data, multiple approaches could work, but only one demonstrates true Python fluency.</p>\n\n<p>This <a href=\"https://applyre.com/resources/500-interview-questions/python\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">500-question python assessment</a> does exactly this, presenting realistic scenarios where context matters as much as syntax knowledge.</p>\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  Making Progress Visible\n</h2>\n\n<p>The beauty of structured learning tools is that they make progress tangible. Instead of vaguely feeling like you're \"getting better at Python,\" you can see exactly which concepts you've mastered and which need more work.</p>\n\n<p>Whether you're preparing for technical interviews, planning to take <a href=\"https://pythoninstitute.org/certification-tracks\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Python certification exams</a>, or simply want to gauge your current skill level, having a clear assessment of your knowledge accelerates improvement by directing your study efforts efficiently.</p>\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  Your Path Forward\n</h2>\n\n<p>Python mastery isn't about memorizing every function in the standard library or writing the most clever one-liners. It's about developing problem-solving intuition and understanding which tools work best in different situations.</p>\n\n<p>Combine hands-on coding with systematic knowledge testing, stay curious about new Python features, and remember that every expert was once a beginner who kept practicing. The Python community is remarkably welcoming to learners at every level‚Äîtake advantage of that support as you continue growing your skills.</p>\n\n","contentLength":0,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Create a Simple Splat Video with spatialstudio","url":"https://dev.to/danielhabib/create-a-simple-splat-video-with-spatialstudio-32an","date":1755546985,"author":"Daniel Habib","guid":231753,"unread":true,"content":"<p>This tutorial assumes you have a basic understanding of Python.

problem","url":"https://www.tinytpu.com/","date":1755546734,"author":"evxxan","guid":233213,"unread":true,"content":"<p>When we started this project, all we knew was that the equation y = mx + b is the foundational building block for neural networks. However, we needed to fully UNDERSTAND the math behind neural networks to build other modules in our TPU. So before we started writing any code, each of us worked out the math of a simple 2 -&gt; 2 -&gt; 1 multi-layer perceptron (MLP).</p><p>The reason we chose this specific network is because we were targeting inference and training for the XOR problem (the \"hello world\" of neural networks). The XOR problem is one of the simplest problems a neural network can solve. All other gates (AND, OR, etc) can predict the outputs from its inputs using just one linear line (one neuron) to separate which inputs correspond to a 0 and which ones correspond to a 1. But to classify all XOR, an MLP is needed, since it requires curved decision boundaries, which can't be achieved with ONLY linear equations. For a geometric and first-principles treatment, the free book<a href=\"https://udlbook.github.io/udlbook/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Understanding Deep Learning</a>is excellent.</p><p>Now, say we want to do continuous inference (i.e. self driving car making multiple predictions a second). That would imply that we're sending multiple pieces of data at once. Since data is inherently multidimensional and has many features, we would have matrices with very large dimensions. However, the XOR problem simplifies the dimensions for us, as there are only two features (0 or 1) and 4 possible pieces of input data (four possible binary combinations of 0 and 1). This gives us a 4x2 matrix, where 4 is the number of rows (batch size) and 2 is the number of columns (feature size).</p><div><p>The XOR input matrix and target outputs:</p><p>Each row represents one of the four possible XOR inputs, and the output vector shows the expected XOR results</p></div><p>Another simplification we're making for our systolic array example here is that we'll use a 2x2 instead of the 256x256 array used in the TPUv1. However, the math is still faithful so nothing is actually dumbed down, rather scaled down instead.</p><p>The first step in the equation is multiplying m with x, which, in matrix form, would be.</p><div><p>whereis our input matrix,is our weight matrix, andis our bias vector</p></div><p>How can we perform matrix multiplication in hardware? Well, we can use a unit called the systolic array!</p><p>The heart of a TPU is a unit called the systolic array.It consists of individual building blocks called Processing Elements (PE) which are connected together in a grid-like structure. Each PE performs a multiply-accumulate operation, meaning it multiplies an incoming input X with a stationary weight Wand adds it to an incoming accumulated sum, all in the same clock cycle.</p><div><pre><code> @ or ;\n            ;\n            ;\n        ;\n        ;\n            ;\n        </code></pre></div><h3>Systolic matrix multiplication</h3><p>When these PEs are connected together, they can be used to perform matrix multiplication systolically, meaning multiple elements of the output matrix can be calculated every clock cycle. The inputs enter the systolic array from the left and move to the neighbouring PE to the right, every clock cycle. The accumulated sums start with the multiplication output from the first row of PEs, move downwards, and get added to the products of each successive PE, until they up at the last row of PEs where they become an element of the output matrix.</p><p>Because of this single unit (and the fact that matrix multiplications dominate the computations performed in models), TPUs can very easily inference and train any model.</p><p>Now let's walk through the example of our XOR problem:</p><p>Our systolic array takes two inputs: the input matrix and the weight matrix. For our XOR network, we initialize with the following weights and biases:</p><h3>Input and weight scheduling</h3><p>To input our input batch within the systolic array, we need to:</p><p>To input our weight matrix: we need to:</p><p>Note that the rotating and staggering don't have any mathematical significance ‚Äî they are simply required to make the systolic array work. The transpoing too is just for mathematical bookkeeping ‚Äì it's required to make the matrix math work because of how we set up our weight pointers within the neural network drawing.</p><p>To perform the staggering, we designed near-identical accumulators for the weights and inputs that would sit above and to the left of the systolic array, respectively.</p><p>Since the activations are fed into the systolic array one-by-one, we thought a first-in-first-out queue (FIFO) would be the optimal data storage option. There was a slight difference between a traditional FIFO and the accumulators we built, however. Our accumulators had 2 input ports ‚Äî one for writing weights manually to the FIFO and one for writing the previous layer's outputs from the activation modules BACK into the input FIFOs (the previous layer's outputs are inputs for the current layer).</p><p>We also needed to load the weights in a similar fashion for every layer, so we replicated the logic for the weight FIFOs, without the second port.</p><p>The next step in the equation is adding the bias. To do this in hardware, we need to create a bias module under each column of the systolic array. We can see that as the sums move out of the last row within the systolic array, we can immediately stream them into our bias modules to compute our pre-activations.<b> We will denote these values with the variable Z.</b></p><div><p>The bias vector  is broadcast across all rows of the matrix ‚Äî meaning it's added to each row of </p></div><p>Now our equation is starting to look a lot like what we've learned in high school ‚Äìbut just in multidimensional form, where each column that streams out of the systolic array represents its own feature!</p><p>Next we have to apply the activation, for which we chose Leaky ReLU.This is also an element-wise operation, similar to the bias, meaning we need an activation module under every bias module (and by proxy under every column of the systolic array) and we can stream the outputs of our bias modules into the activation modules immediately.<b>We will denote these post-activation values with H</b>.</p><div><p>The Leaky ReLU function applies element-wise:</p><p>where  is our leak factor. For matrices, this applies to each element independently.</p></div><div><p>For our XOR example, let's see how Layer 1 processes the data. First, the systolic array computes:</p><p>Finally, LeakyReLU is applied element-wise:</p><p>Negative values are multiplied by 0.5, positive values pass through unchanged.</p></div><p>Now you might be asking ‚Äì why don't we merge the bias term and the activation term in one clock cycle? Well, this is because of something called pipelining! Pipelining allows multiple operations to be executed simultaneously across different stages of the TPU ‚Äîinstead of waiting for one complete operation to finish before starting the next, you break the work into stages that can overlap. Think of it like an assembly line: while one worker (activation module) processes a part, the previous worker (bias module) is already working on the next part. This keeps all of the modules busy rather than having them sit idle waiting for the previous stage to complete. It also affects the speed at which we can run our TPU ‚Äî if we have one module that tries to squeeze many operations in a single cycle, our clock speed will be bottlenecked by that module, as the other modules can only run as fast as that single module. Therefore, it's efficient and best practice to split up operations into individual clock cycles as much as possible.</p><p>Another mechanism we used to run our chip as efficiently as possible, was a propagating \"start\" signal, which we called a travelling chip enable (denoted by the purple dot). Because everything in our design was staggered, we realized that we could very elegantly assert a start signal for a single clock cycle at the first accumulator and have it propagate to neighbouring modules exactly when they needed to be turned on.</p><p>This would extend into the systolic array and eventually the bias and activation modules, where neighbouring PEs and modules, moving from the top left to the bottom right, were turned on in consecutive clock cycles. This ensured that every module was only performing computations when it was required to and wasn't wasting power in the background.</p><p>Now, we know that starting a new layer means we must compute the same  using a new weight matrix. How can we do this if our systolic array is weight-stationary? How can we change the weights?</p><p>While thinking about this problem, we came across the idea of double buffering, which originates from video games. The reason why double buffering exists is to prevent something called screen tearing on your monitor. Ultimately, pixels take time to load and we'd like to \"hide away\" that time somehow. And if you paid attention, this is the exact same problem we're currently facing with the systolic array. Fortunately, video game designers have already come up with a solution for this problem. By adding a second \"shadow\" buffer, which holds the weights of the next layer while the current layer is being computed on, we can load in new weights during computation, cutting the total clock cycle count in half.</p><p>To make this work, we also needed to add some signals to move the data. First, we needed a signal to indicate when to switch the weights in the shadow buffer and the active buffer. We called this signal the \"switch\" signal (denoted by the blue dot) and it copied the values in the shadow buffer to the active buffer. It propagated from the top left of the systolic array to the bottom right (the same path as the travelling chip enable, but only within the systolic array). We then needed one more signal to indicate when we wanted to move the weights down by one row and we called this the \"accept\" flag (denoted by the green dot) because each row is ACCEPTING a new set of weights. This would move the new weights into the top row of the systolic array, as well as each row of weights down into the next row of the systolic array. These two control flags worked in tandem to make our double buffering mechanism work.</p><p>If you haven't already noticed, this allows the systolic array to do something powerful‚Ä¶continuous inference!!! We can continuously stream in new weights and inputs and compute forward pass for as many layers as we want. This touches into a core design philosophy of the systolic array: we want to maximize PE usage.<b>We always want to keep the systolic array fed!</b></p><div><p>For Layer 2, the outputs from Layer 1 () now become our inputs:</p><p>Adding bias and applying activation:</p><p>All values are positive, so they pass through unchanged. These are our final predictions for the XOR problem!</p></div><p>Our final step for inference was making a control unit to use a custom instruction set (ISA) to assert all of our control flags and load data through a data bus. Including the data bus, our ISA was 24 bits long and it made our testbench more elegant as we could pass a single string of bits every clock cycle, rather than individually setting multiple flags.</p><p>We then put everything together and got inference completely working! This was a big milestone for us and we were very proud about what we had accomplished.</p><h2>Backpropagation and training</h2><div><p>Ok we've solved inference ‚Äî but what about training? Well here's the beauty: We can use the same architecture we use for inference for training! Why? Because training is just matrix multiplications with a few extra steps.</p><p>Here's where things get really exciting. Let's say we just ran inference on the XOR problem and got a prediction that looks something like [0.8, 0.3, 0.1, 0.9] when we actually wanted [1, 0, 0, 1]. Our model is performing poorly! We need to make it better. This is where training comes in. We're going to use something called a loss function to tell our model exactly how poorly it's doing. For simplicity, we chose Mean Squared Error (MSE) ‚Äî think of it like measuring the \"distance\" between what we predicted and what we actually wanted, just like how you might measure how far off target your basketball shot was.<b>Let's denote the loss with L.</b></p><div><p>where  is the target output, is our prediction, and is the number of samples</p></div><div><p>For our XOR example, with predictionsand targets :</p><p>This loss value tells us how far off our predictions are from the true XOR outputs.</p></div><p>So right after we finish computing our final layer's activations (let's call them), we immediately stream them into a loss module to calculate just how bad our predictions are. These loss modules sit right below our activation modules, and we only use them when we've reached our final layer. But here's the key insight: you don't actually need to calculate the loss value itself to train. You just need its derivative. Why? Because that derivative tells us which direction to adjust our weights to make the loss smaller. It's like having a compass that points toward \"better performance.\"</p><h3>The magic of the chain rule</h3><p>This is where calculus enters the picture. To make our model better, we need to figure out how changing each weight affects our loss. The chain rule lets us break this massive calculation into smaller, manageable pieces.</p><div><p>The chain rule for gradients:</p><p>This allows us to compute gradients layer by layer, propagating them backwards through the network</p></div><p>Let's naively trace through what happens step by step.</p><ol><li>Calculate- how much the loss changes with respect to our final activations.</li><li>Computeby taking the derivative of the activation (leaky ReLU in our case).</li><li>Compute,</li><li>Compute</li><li>Rinse and repeat for the n-1 layer.</li></ol></div><div><p>Propagating gradients to the hidden layer:</p><p>And through the first layer's activation:</p><p>With mixed positive and negative values in, the gradient is:</p></div><p>Once we have all of these individual derivatives, we can multiply them together to find any derivative with respect of the loss (i.e.gives us).</p><p>After that, we have to compute the activation derivative, for which the formula is. This is also an element-wise computation, meaning we can structure it exactly like the loss module (and bias and activation modules), but it will perform a different calculation. One important note about this module, however, is that it requires the activations we computed during forward pass.</p><p>Now you might be wondering ‚Äî how do we actually compute derivatives in hardware? Let's look at Leaky ReLU as an example, since it's beautifully simple but demonstrates the key principles. Remember that Leaky ReLU applies different operations based on whether the input is positive or negative. The derivative follows the same pattern: it outputs 1 for positive inputs and a small constant (we used 0.01) for negative inputs.</p><pre><code> @;\n    .01 ;\n    </code></pre><p>What's beautiful about this is that it's just a simple comparison ‚Äì no complex arithmetic needed. The hardware can compute this derivative in a single clock cycle, keeping our pipeline flowing smoothly. This same principle applies to other activation functions: their derivatives often simplify to basic operations that hardware can execute very efficiently.</p><p>You'll notice a really cool pattern emerging: all these modules that sit underneath the systolic array process column vectors that stream out one by one. This gave us the idea to unify them into something we called a <b>vector processing unit (VPU)</b> ‚Äì because that's exactly what they're doing, processing vectors element-wise!<p>Not only is this more elegant to work with, it's also useful when we scale our TPU beyond a 2x2 systolic array, as we'll have N number of these modules (N being the size of the systolic array), each of which we would have to interface with individually. Unifying these modules under a parent module makes our design more scalable and elegant!</p></p><p>Additionally, by incorporating control signals for each module, which we call the VPU pathway bits, we can selectively enable or skip specific operations. This makes the VPU flexible enough to support both inference and training. For instance, during the forward pass, we want to apply biases and activations but skip computing loss or activation derivatives. When transitioning to the backward pass, all modules are engaged, but within the backward chain we only need to compute the activation derivative. Due to pipelining, all values that flow through the VPU pass through each of the four modules, and any unused modules simply act as registers, forwarding their inputs to outputs without performing computation.</p><p>The next few derivatives are interesting because we can actually use matrix multiplication (and the systolic array!) to compute the derivatives with the help of these three identities:</p><ol><li>If we haveand take its derivative with respect to the weights, we get:</li><li>If we haveand take its derivative with respect to the inputs, we get:<div>(just the weight matrix transposed)</div></li><li>For the bias term, the derivative is simply 1.</li></ol><p>This means that we can multiply the previouswith ,, and 1 to get,, and, respectively, and we can multiply all of these byto get the gradients of the loss with respect to all of our second layer parameters. And because all of the gradients are actually gradient matrices, we can use the systolic array!</p><p>Now something to note about the activation derivativeand the weight derivativeis that they both require the post-activations (H) we calculate during forward pass. This means we need to store the outputs of every layer in some form of memory to be able to perform training. Here's where we created a new scratchpad memory modulewhich we called the unified buffer (UB).This lets us store our H values immediately after we compute them during forward pass.</p><p>We realized that we can also get rid of the input and weight accumulators, as well as manually loading the bias and leak factors into their respective modules, by using the UB to store them. This is also better practice, rather than loading in new data every clock cycle with the instruction set. Since we want to access two values (2 inputs or 2 weights for each row/col of the systolic array) at the same time, we added TWO read and write ports. We did this for each data primitive (inputs, weights, bias, leak factor, post activations) to minimize data contention since we have many different types of data.</p><p>To read values, we supply a starting address and the number of locations we want the UB to read and it will read 2 values every clock cycle. Writing is a similar mechanism, where we specify which values we want to write to each of the two input ports. The beauty in the read mechanism is that it runs in the background once we supply a starting address until the number of locations given are read, meaning we only need to provide an instruction for this every few clock cycles.</p><p>At the end of the day, not having these mechanisms wouldn't break the TPU ‚Äî but they allow us to always keep the systolic array fed, which is a core design principle we couldn't compromise.</p><p>While we were working on this, we realized we could make one last small optimization for the activation derivative module ‚Äî since we only use the  values once (for computing), we created a tiny cache within the VPU instead of storing them in the UB. The rest of the  values will be stored in the UB because they're needed to compute multiple derivatives.</p><p>This is what the new TPU architecture, modified to perform training, looks like:</p><p>Now we can do backpropagation!</p><h3>The beautiful symmetry of forward and backward pass</h3><p>Going back to the computational graph, we discovered something remarkable: the longest chain in backpropagation closely resembles forward pass! In forward pass, we multiply activation matrices with transposed weight matrices. In backward pass, we multiply gradient matrices with weight matrices (untransposed). It's like looking in a mirror!</p><p>This insight led us to compute the long chain of the computational graph first (highlighted in yellow) ‚Äì getting all ourgradients just like we computed activations in forward pass. We could cache these gradients and reuse them, following the same efficient pattern we'd already mastered.</p><p>We create a loop where we:</p><ol><li>Fetch a bridge node () from our unified buffer</li><li>Fetch the corresponding matrix, also from unified buffer</li><li>Stream these through our systolic array to compute the weight gradients</li></ol><p>And here's where something really magical happens: we can stream these weight gradients directly into a gradient descent module while we're still computing them! This module takes the current weights stored in memory and updates them using the gradients.</p><div><p>The gradient descent update rule:</p><p>where  is the learning rate and represents any parameter (weights or biases)</p></div><div><p>Computing weight gradients for our XOR network:</p><p>Bias gradients (sum over samples):</p><p>Applying gradient descent with learning rate:</p></div><p>No waiting around ‚Äî everything flows like water through our pipeline.</p><p>You might be wondering: \"We've used our matrix multiplication identities for the long chain and weight gradients ‚Äî how do we calculate bias gradients?\" Well, we've actually already done most of the work! Since we're processing batches of data, we can simply sum (the technical term is \"reduce\") thegradients across the batch dimension. The beauty is that we can do this reduction right when we're computing the long chain ‚Äî no extra work required!</p><p>With all these new changes and control flags, our instruction is significantly longer ‚Äî 94 bits in fact! But we can confirm that every single one of these bits is needed and we ensured that we couldn't make the instruction set any smaller without compromising the speed and efficiency of the TPU.</p><p>By continuing this same process iteratively ‚Äì forward pass, backward pass, weight updates ‚Äì we can train our network until it performs exactly how we want. The same systolic array that powered our inference now powers our training, with just a few additional modules to handle the gradient computations.</p><p>What started as a simple idea about matrix multiplication has grown into a complete training system. Every component works together in harmony: data flows through pipelines, modules operate in parallel, and our systolic array stays fed with useful work.</p>","contentLength":21867,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44944592"},{"title":"Show HN: Chroma Cloud ‚Äì serverless search database for AI","url":"https://trychroma.com/cloud","date":1755544801,"author":"jeffchuber","guid":233536,"unread":true,"content":"<div>client </div><div>collection name</div><div>    ids</div><div>results </div><div>    query_texts</div><div>    where</div><div>    include</div>","contentLength":72,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44944241"},{"title":"Show HN: We started building an AI dev tool but it turned into a Sims-style game","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sRPnX_f2V_c","date":1755543083,"author":"maxraven","guid":231773,"unread":true,"content":"<p>We started out building an AI agent dev tool, but somewhere along the way it turned into Sims for AI agents.</p><p>The original idea was simple: make it easy to create AI agents. We started with Jupyter Notebooks, where each cell could be callable by MCP‚Äîso agents could turn them into tools for themselves. It worked well enough that the system became self-improving, churning out content, and acting like a co-pilot that helped you build new agents.</p><p>But when we stepped back, what we had was these endless walls of text. And even though it worked, honestly, it was just boring. We were also convinced that it would be swallowed up by the next model‚Äôs capabilities. We wanted to build something else‚Äîsomething that made AI less of a black box and more engaging. Why type into a chat box all day if you could look your agents in the face, see their confusion, and watch when and how they interact?</p><p>Both of us grew up on simulation games‚ÄîRollerCoaster Tycoon 3, Age of Empires, SimCity‚Äîso we started experimenting with running LLM agents inside a 3D world. At first it was pure curiosity, but right away, watching agents interact in real time was much more interesting than anything we‚Äôd done before.</p><p>The very first version was small: a single Unity room, an MCP server, and a chat box. Even getting two agents to take turns took weeks. Every run surfaced quirks‚Äîagents refusing to talk at all, or only ‚Äúspeaking‚Äù by dancing or pulling facial expressions to show emotion. That unpredictability kept us building.</p><p>Now it‚Äôs a desktop app (Tauri + Unity via WebGL) where humans and agents share 3D tile-based rooms. Agents receive structured observations every tick and can take actions that change the world. You can edit the rules between runs‚Äîprompts, decision logic, even how they see chat history‚Äîwithout rebuilding.</p><p>On the technical side, we built a Unity bridge with MCP and multi-provider routing via LiteLLM, with local model support via Mistral.rs coming next. All system prompts are editable, so you can directly experiment with coordination strategies‚Äîtuning how ‚Äúchatty‚Äù agents are versus how much they move or manipulate the environment.</p><p>We then added a tilemap editor so you can design custom rooms, set tile-based events with conditions and actions, and turn them into puzzles or hazards. There‚Äôs community sharing built in, so you can post rooms you make.</p><p>Watching agents collude or negotiate through falling tiles, teleports, landmines, fire, ‚Äúwin‚Äù and ‚Äúlose‚Äù tiles, and tool calls for things like lethal fires or disco floors is a much more fun way to spend our days.</p><p>Under the hood, Unity‚Äôs ECS drives a whole state machine and event system. And because humans and AI share the same space in real time, every negotiation, success, or failure also becomes useful multi-agent, multimodal data for post-training or world models.</p><p>Our early users are already using it for prompt-injection testing, social engineering scenarios, cooperative games, and model comparisons.\nThe bigger vision is to build an open-ended, AI-native sim-game where you can build and interact with anything or anyone. You can design puzzles, levels, and environments, have agents compete or collaborate, set up games, or even replay your favorite TV shows.</p><p>The fun part is that no two interactions are ever the same. Everything is emergent, not hard-coded, so the same level played six times will play out differently each time.</p><p>The plan is to keep expanding‚Äîbigger rooms, more in-world tools for agents, and then multiplayer hosting. It‚Äôs live now, no waitlist. Free to play. You can bring your own API keys, or start with $10 in credits and run agents right away: www.TheInterface.com.</p><p>We‚Äôd love feedback on scenarios worth testing and what to build next.

Braden here, creator of Whispering, an open-source speech-to-text app.</p><p>I really like dictation. For years, I relied on transcription tools that were  good, but they were all closed-source. Even a lot of them that claimed to be ‚Äúlocal‚Äù or ‚Äúon-device‚Äù were still black boxes that left me wondering where my audio really went.</p><p>So I built Whispering. It‚Äôs open-source, local-first, and most importantly, transparent with your data.   Your data is stored locally on your device, and your audio goes directly from your machine to a local provider (Whisper C++, Speaches, etc.) or your chosen cloud provider (Groq, OpenAI, ElevenLabs, etc.). For me, the features were good enough that I left my paid tools behind (I used Superwhisper and Wispr Flow before).</p><p>Productivity apps should be open-source and transparent with your data, but they also need to match the UX of paid, closed-software alternatives. I hope Whispering is near that point. I use it for several hours a day, from coding to thinking out loud while carrying pizza boxes back from the office.</p><p>There are plenty of transcription apps out there, but I hope Whispering adds some extra competition from the OSS ecosystem (one of my other OSS favorites is Handy <a href=\"https://github.com/cjpais/Handy\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/cjpais/Handy</a>). Whispering has a few tricks up its sleeve, like a voice-activated mode for hands-free operation (no button holding), and customizable AI transformations with any prompt/model.</p><p>I‚Äôm basically obsessed with local-first open-source software. I think there should be an open-source, local-first version of every app, and I would like them all to work together. The idea of Epicenter is to store your data in a folder of plaintext and SQLite, and build a suite of interoperable, local-first tools on top of this shared memory. Everything is totally transparent, so you can trust it.</p><p>Whispering is the first app in this effort. It‚Äôs not there yet regarding memory, but it‚Äôs getting there.

With getusait.com, you can be confident that your purchase is safe, as they provide excellent customer support, fast delivery, and guarantee that the accounts won‚Äôt be flagged or suspended.</p>\n\n<p>Their accounts are ready for use right out of the box, saving you time and effort.</p>\n\n<p>Benefits of Buying Gmail Accounts at getusait.com<br>\nWhen you buy Gmail accounts from getusait.com, you get several benefits: accounts are fully verified, reducing the risk of suspension or issues with account functionality.</p>\n\n<p>You also get immediate access to Google‚Äôs services without needing to create new accounts manually.</p>\n\n<p>These accounts are designed for seamless integration into your workflow, whether for business or personal use. Additionally, getusait.com provides customer support to help resolve any problems you might encounter after your purchase.</p>\n\n<p>Is It Legal to Buy Gmail Accounts? Understanding Google‚Äôs Policies<br>\nBuying Gmail accounts is a gray area in terms of legality. Google‚Äôs terms of service prohibit the sale and unauthorized transfer of accounts.</p>\n\n<p>Violating these terms could result in the suspension or permanent ban of the purchased account.</p>\n\n<p>While buying accounts is not illegal in itself, doing so could breach Google‚Äôs policies, and you could face security and privacy risks if the accounts are not obtained from reliable sellers who comply with Google‚Äôs guidelines.</p>\n\n<p>The Risks of Buying Gmail Accounts: Privacy and Security Concerns<br>\nOne of the major risks when you buy Gmail accounts is the potential exposure of your personal data and security vulnerabilities.</p>\n\n<p>Purchased accounts may have been previously compromised or improperly secured. If the seller did not properly manage the account‚Äôs security settings, you might face issues like unauthorized access or data breaches.</p>\n\n<p>Additionally, using a purchased account may expose you to phishing attacks or other online security threats. Always take precautions, such as enabling two-factor authentication (2FA), to protect your information.</p>\n\n<p>How to Identify a Trustworthy Seller of Gmail Accounts<br>\nTo safely buy Gmail accounts, you should identify a trustworthy seller by looking for reputable platforms with verified reviews and customer feedback.</p>\n\n<p>Avoid individual sellers who cannot provide proof of account legitimacy or offer clear terms of service.</p>\n\n<p>A reliable seller will offer guarantees for the accounts, provide access to customer support, and ensure the accounts are not linked to suspicious activities.</p>\n\n<p>Always research the seller before making a purchase to ensure the account‚Äôs safety and compliance with Google‚Äôs policies.</p>\n\n<p>Can You Safely Use a Bought Gmail Account for Business Purposes?<br>\nYou can use a bought Gmail account for business purposes, but caution is required.</p>\n\n<p>Gmail accounts bought from legitimate sources may allow you to manage your business emails and collaborate on projects.</p>\n\n<p>However, Google‚Äôs terms of service prohibit the sale and transfer of accounts, so you risk having the account suspended if it‚Äôs flagged by Google.</p>\n\n<p>For businesses, it‚Äôs safer to create and manage your own accounts to ensure full control and avoid any issues with account ownership or service disruptions.</p>\n\n<p>How Google Detects and Prevents the Sale of Gmail Accounts<br>\nGoogle actively monitors account activity to detect and prevent the sale of Gmail accounts. They use a variety of techniques, including analyzing IP address discrepancies, sudden changes in account usage patterns, and monitoring for suspicious login attempts.</p>\n\n<p>When they detect any activity that suggests an account has been transferred or sold, Google may suspend the account or even permanently ban it.</p>\n\n<p>As a result, buying Gmail accounts can lead to serious consequences if the account is flagged by Google‚Äôs system.</p>\n\n<p>The Importance of Two-Factor Authentication in Protecting Your Gmail Account<br>\nTwo-factor authentication (2FA) is a critical feature for protecting your Gmail account, especially when you buy Gmail accounts.</p>\n\n<p>If you enable 2FA, even if the account‚Äôs password is compromised, an attacker would still need access to your second authentication factor (such as a phone or authentication app) to gain access.</p>\n\n<p>This adds a layer of security and helps prevent unauthorized use, ensuring that your email and personal information are kept secure after you purchase the account.</p>\n\n<p>What Happens if Google Suspends or Bans a Purchased Gmail Account?<br>\nIf Google suspends or bans an account that you purchased, you may lose access to all Gmail services, including emails, contacts, and Google Drive files.</p>\n\n<p>If the account was flagged for violating Google‚Äôs terms of service or was suspected of being sold or transferred without authorization, it could be permanently banned.</p>\n\n<p>This can result in significant disruptions, especially if you rely on the account for business or personal communication. Always check that the account you are purchasing is legitimate and not flagged by Google.</p>\n\n<p>Looking to buy old GitHub accounts?

When you buy Gmail accounts, you are essentially circumventing their intended user controls, which may lead to issues such as data breaches, fraud, or the use of the account for purposes not authorized by Google.</p>\n\n<p>To avoid problems, it‚Äôs recommended to create your own Gmail accounts rather than purchasing them.</p>\n\n<p>The Process of Verifying a Gmail Account: What to Expect When Buying<br>\nWhen you buy Gmail accounts, the verification process generally involves linking the account to a valid phone number or other identification method.</p>\n\n<p>If the account is already verified, this may not be necessary. However, if you need to verify the account after purchase, you may be asked to confirm personal details, set up a recovery email, and enable security features like two-factor authentication.</p>\n\n<p>It‚Äôs important to ensure that the account is verified properly to avoid issues with Google‚Äôs security systems.</p>\n\n<p>How to Protect Your Data When Using a Purchased Gmail Account<br>\nTo protect your data when using a purchased Gmail account, ensure that you immediately update the password and enable two-factor authentication (2FA).</p>\n\n<p>You should also review the account‚Äôs security settings to make sure no unauthorized devices or applications are connected.</p>\n\n<p>If possible, run a security check using Google‚Äôs built-in tools to detect any unusual activity.</p>\n\n<p>Regularly monitor the account for suspicious login attempts or changes, and ensure that your email and sensitive information remain secure.</p>\n\n<p>Alternatives to Buying Gmail Accounts for Managing Multiple Emails<br>\nInstead of buying Gmail accounts, you can create multiple accounts using Google‚Äôs services, which allow you to manage several Gmail addresses under one Google account.</p>\n\n<p>By using Google‚Äôs aliases, you can set up different email addresses using your primary Gmail account, or you can purchase a business-oriented service like Google Workspace to manage multiple professional accounts.</p>\n\n<p>These alternatives allow you to maintain control, security, and compliance with Google‚Äôs policies without the risks of buying third-party accounts.</p>\n\n<p>Can You Transfer Ownership of a Gmail Account Once Purchased?<br>\nGoogle‚Äôs terms of service prohibit the transfer of ownership of Gmail accounts.</p>\n\n<p>If you buy Gmail accounts, you cannot legally transfer the ownership to another individual, as this violates Google‚Äôs policies.</p>\n\n<p>Even if you try to transfer or sell the account later, it could result in the account being suspended or banned by Google.</p>\n\n<p>It is always safer to maintain the account within the original terms of service or create your own Gmail account for full control.</p>\n\n<p>How Buying Gmail Accounts Can Affect Your Online Reputation<br>\nBuying Gmail accounts can potentially harm your online reputation if the accounts are flagged or suspended by Google.</p>\n\n<p>Since Google‚Äôs systems are designed to detect unusual activity, purchasing accounts may raise red flags and lead to account bans.</p>\n\n<p>Additionally, if the accounts are used for spam or other unauthorized activities, it can negatively impact how others perceive you.</p>\n\n<p>It‚Äôs always best to manage your own accounts to maintain credibility and avoid any risks that could damage your online presence.</p>\n\n<p>Best Practices for Securely Managing Multiple Gmail Accounts<br>\nWhen managing multiple Gmail accounts, whether purchased or created, follow best practices to ensure security and efficiency.</p>\n\n<p>Use a password manager to store and secure login details, enable two-factor authentication (2FA) on all accounts, and periodically review security settings for suspicious activity.</p>\n\n<p>Create distinct passwords for each account and avoid reusing passwords across accounts. Additionally, using a single</p>\n\n<p>email management tool like Google‚Äôs account switcher can help you manage multiple Gmail accounts more efficiently without needing to log in and out constantly.</p>\n\n<p>Regularly check for security updates and ensure each account has a secure, unique password to protect against unauthorized access.</p>\n\n<p>Following these best practices can help you securely manage multiple Gmail accounts, whether they are created or purchased.</p>\n\n<p>FAQ About Buying Gmail Accounts<br>\nQ1: Is it safe to buy Gmail accounts?<br>\nBuying Gmail accounts carries inherent risks. If you purchase accounts from untrustworthy sources, they may be compromised or flagged by Google.</p>\n\n<p>It‚Äôs important to choose reputable sellers who provide verified and secure accounts, and always be aware of Google‚Äôs policies, as buying accounts may violate their terms of service.</p>\n\n<p>Q2: Can I use a purchased Gmail account for business purposes?<br>\nWhile you can technically use a purchased Gmail account for business purposes, doing so might violate Google‚Äôs terms of service.</p>\n\n<p>Google may suspend or ban accounts that have been transferred or sold, which could disrupt your business operations. It‚Äôs recommended to create and manage your own accounts for full control and compliance.</p>\n\n<p>Q3: How can I verify a purchased Gmail account?<br>\nWhen you buy Gmail accounts, it‚Äôs important to verify the account by linking it to a personal phone number, setting up a recovery email, and enabling two-factor authentication (2FA).</p>\n\n<p>These steps help ensure the account is secure and compliant with Google‚Äôs policies. If the account is already verified, check that it has not been flagged for suspicious activity.</p>\n\n<p>Q4: What should I do if my purchased Gmail account is suspended?<br>\nIf your purchased Gmail account is suspended, you should contact the seller for assistance or seek support from Google‚Äôs help center.</p>\n\n<p>If the suspension is due to a policy violation, it‚Äôs unlikely that you can recover the account. You may need to create a new account and follow Google‚Äôs guidelines to avoid future suspensions.</p>\n\n<p>Q5: Are there alternatives to buying Gmail accounts?<br>\nYes, instead of purchasing Gmail accounts, you can create and manage multiple accounts through Google Workspace or use Gmail‚Äôs account aliasing feature to create different email addresses linked to your primary account.</p>\n\n<p>This is a safer and more reliable way to manage several email addresses while staying within Google‚Äôs policies.</p>\n\n<p>Conclusion</p>\n\n<p>Looking to buy old GitHub accounts?

An API is a type of programming interface that offers a service to other parts of a program or other programs.</p><p>However, many of these packages and modules define objects that aren‚Äôt intended for direct access. These objects are meant for internal use within the specific package or module and aren‚Äôt part of its public interface.</p><ul><li>: You can use them in your own code or client code.</li><li>: You can use them only from inside the defining class and its subclasses.</li></ul><p>These languages have specific keywords and syntax to define public and private members in their classes. Once you declare a member as private, you can‚Äôt use it outside the class because the language restricts access. So, private members aren‚Äôt part of the class‚Äôs public interface, and there‚Äôs no way to access them.</p><p>In contrast, Python doesn‚Äôt have the notion of public and private members. It has neither dedicated <a href=\"https://realpython.com/python-keywords/\">keywords</a> nor syntax for defining them. Therefore, you can always access the members of a Python class.</p><p>If Python doesn‚Äôt have a specific syntax to define when an object is part of a public interface, then how do you tell your users that they  or  use a given class, method, function, variable, constant, or even module in their code?</p><p>To approach this question, the Python community has a well-established :</p><p><em>If a name starts with a letter in uppercase or lowercase, then you should consider that name public and, therefore, part of the code‚Äôs API. In contrast, if a name starts with an underscore character (), then you should consider that name non-public, meaning it‚Äôs not a part of the public API.</em></p><p>You should observe these naming conventions to explicitly indicate whether other developers should directly use your variables, constants, functions, methods, and modules in external code.</p><div><p> This naming convention doesn‚Äôt restrict access to objects. It only signals to other developers how the code is intended to be used. Because of this, Python programmers avoid the terms public and private. Instead, they distinguish between <a href=\"https://realpython.com/ref/glossary/public-name/\"></a> and <a href=\"https://realpython.com/ref/glossary/non-public-name/\"></a> names.</p></div><p>The Python community uses the underscore character () as part of other naming conventions. Here‚Äôs a summary of what <a href=\"https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/\">PEP 8</a> says about using this character in names:</p><div><table><tbody><tr><td>Single leading underscore</td><td>Indicates that the name is meant for internal use only</td></tr><tr><td>Single trailing underscore</td><td>Avoids naming conflicts with Python keywords and built-in names</td></tr><tr><td>Double leading underscore</td><td>Triggers name mangling in the context of Python classes</td></tr><tr><td>Double leading and trailing underscore</td><td>Indicates special attributes and methods that Python provides</td></tr><tr><td>Indicates a temporary or throwaway variable</td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>Note that only two of these <a href=\"https://realpython.com/python-pep8/#naming-conventions\">naming conventions</a> enforce specific Python behaviors. Using double leading underscores triggers  in Python classes. You‚Äôll learn more about this behavior in the section on <a href=\"https://realpython.com/atom.xml#double-leading-underscore-in-classes-pythons-name-mangling\">name mangling</a>.</p><p>Additionally, those names with double leading and trailing underscores that are listed in the Python <a href=\"https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html\">data model</a> trigger internal behaviors in specific contexts.

The philosophy was that browsers should attempt to make code work rather than throwing errors that could break entire webpages. In the mid-90s web ecosystem, where one syntax error could render a site unusable, this forgiveness was crucial.

For example, if you‚Äôre doing code generation, it‚Äôs almost scientific that you should include relevant code and error messages; if you‚Äôre doing question-answering, it‚Äôs logical to retrieve supporting documents and provide them to the model. There are established methods like few-shot prompting, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and chain-of-thought prompting that we know (from research and trial) can boost results. There‚Äôs also a science to respecting the model‚Äôs constraints‚Äîevery model has a context length limit, and overstuffing that window can not only increase latency/cost but potentially  the quality if the important pieces get lost in the noise.</p><p>Karpathy summed it up well: ‚ÄúToo little or of the wrong form and the LLM doesn‚Äôt have the right context for optimal performance. Too much or too irrelevant and the LLM costs might go up and performance might come down.‚Äù</p><p>So the science is in techniques for selecting, pruning, and formatting context optimally. For instance, using embeddings to find the most relevant docs to include (so you‚Äôre not inserting unrelated text) or compressing long histories into summaries. Researchers have even catalogued failure modes of  contexts‚Äîthings like  (where an earlier hallucination in the context leads to further errors) or  (where too much extraneous detail causes the model to lose focus). Knowing these pitfalls, a good engineer will curate the context carefully.</p><p>Then there‚Äôs the ‚Äúart‚Äù side‚Äîthe intuition and creativity born of experience.</p><p>This is about understanding LLMs‚Äô quirks and subtle behaviors. Think of it like a seasoned programmer who ‚Äújust knows‚Äù how to structure code for readability: An experienced context engineer develops a feel for how to structure a prompt for a given model. For example, you might sense that one model tends to do better if you first outline a solution approach before diving into specifics, so you include an initial step like ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs think step by step‚Ä¶‚Äù in the prompt. Or you notice that the model often misunderstands a particular term in your domain, so you preemptively clarify it in the context. These aren‚Äôt in a manual‚Äîyou learn them by observing model outputs and iterating. <strong>This is where prompt-crafting (in the old sense) still matters</strong>, but now it‚Äôs in service of the larger context. It‚Äôs similar to software design patterns: There‚Äôs science in understanding common solutions but art in knowing when and how to apply them.</p><p>Let‚Äôs explore a few common strategies and patterns context engineers use to craft effective contexts:</p><p><strong>Retrieval of relevant knowledge:</strong> One of the most powerful techniques is retrieval-augmented generation. If the model needs facts or domain-specific data that isn‚Äôt guaranteed to be in its training memory, have your system fetch that info and include it. For example, if you‚Äôre building a documentation assistant, you might vector-search your documentation and insert the top matching passages into the prompt before asking the question. This way, the model‚Äôs answer will be grounded in real data you provided rather than in its sometimes outdated internal knowledge. Key skills here include designing good search queries or embedding spaces to get the right snippet and formatting the inserted text clearly (with citations or quotes) so the model knows to use it. When LLMs ‚Äúhallucinate‚Äù facts, it‚Äôs often because we failed to provide the actual fact‚Äîretrieval is the antidote to that.</p><p><strong>Few-shot examples and role instructions:</strong> This hearkens back to classic prompt engineering. If you want the model to output something in a particular style or format, show it examples. For instance, to get structured JSON output, you might include a couple of example inputs and outputs in JSON in the prompt, then ask for a new one. Few-shot context effectively teaches the model by example. Likewise, setting a  or persona can guide tone and behavior (‚ÄúYou are an expert Python developer helping a user‚Ä¶‚Äù). These techniques are staples because they work: They bias the model toward the patterns you want. In the context-engineering mindset, prompt wording and examples are just one part of the context, but they remain crucial. In fact, you could say prompt engineering (crafting instructions and examples) is now a  of context engineering‚Äîit‚Äôs one tool in the toolkit. We still care a lot about phrasing and demonstrative examples, but we‚Äôre also doing all these other things around them.</p><p><strong>Managing state and memory:</strong> Many applications involve multiple turns of interaction or long-running sessions. The context window isn‚Äôt infinite, so a major part of context engineering is deciding how to handle conversation history or intermediate results. A common technique is ‚Äîafter each few interactions, summarize them and use the summary going forward instead of the full text. For example, Anthropic‚Äôs Claude assistant automatically does this when conversations get lengthy, to avoid context overflow. (You‚Äôll see it produce a ‚Äú[Summary of previous discussion]‚Äù that condenses earlier turns.) Another tactic is to explicitly write important facts to an external store (a file, database, etc.) and then later retrieve them when needed rather than carrying them in every prompt. This is like an external memory. Some advanced agent frameworks even let the LLM generate ‚Äúnotes to self‚Äù that get stored and can be recalled in future steps. The art here is figuring out  to keep,  to summarize, and  to resurface past info at the right moment. Done well, it lets an AI maintain coherence over very long tasks‚Äîsomething that pure prompting would struggle with.</p><p><strong>Tool use and environmental context:</strong> Modern AI agents can use tools (e.g., calling APIs, running code, web browsing) as part of their operations. When they do, each tool‚Äôs output becomes new context for the next model call. Context engineering in this scenario means instructing the model  to use tools and then feeding the results back in. For example, an agent might have a rule: ‚ÄúIf the user asks a math question, call the calculator tool.‚Äù After using it, the result (say 42) is inserted into the prompt: ‚ÄúTool output: 42.‚Äù This requires formatting the tool output clearly and maybe adding a follow-up instruction like ‚ÄúGiven this result, now answer the user‚Äôs question.‚Äù A lot of work in agent frameworks (LangChain, etc.) is essentially context engineering around tool use‚Äîgiving the model a list of available tools, along with syntactic guidelines for invoking them, and templating how to incorporate results. The key is that you, the engineer,  this dialogue between the model and the external world.</p><p><strong>Information formatting and packaging:</strong> We‚Äôve touched on this, but it deserves emphasis. Often you have more info than fits or is useful to include fully. So you compress or format it. If your model is writing code and you have a large codebase, you might include just function signatures or docstrings rather than entire files, to give it context. If the user query is verbose, you might highlight the main question at the end to focus the model. Use headings, code blocks, tables‚Äîwhatever structure best communicates the data. For example, rather than ‚ÄúUser data: [massive JSON]‚Ä¶ Now answer question.‚Äù you might extract the few fields needed and present ‚ÄúUser‚Äôs Name: X, Account Created: Y, Last Login: Z.‚Äù This is easier for the model to parse and also uses fewer tokens. In short, think like a UX designer, but your ‚Äúuser‚Äù is the LLM‚Äîdesign the prompt for  consumption.</p><p>The impact of these techniques is huge. When you see an impressive LLM demo solving a complex task (say, debugging code or planning a multistep process), you can bet it wasn‚Äôt just a single clever prompt behind the scenes. There was a pipeline of context assembly enabling it.</p><p>For instance, an AI pair programmer might implement a workflow like:</p><ol><li>Search the codebase for relevant code.</li><li>Include those code snippets in the prompt with the user‚Äôs request.</li><li>If the model proposes a fix, run tests in the background.</li><li>If tests fail, feed the failure output back into the prompt for the model to refine its solution.</li></ol><p>Each step has carefully engineered context: The search results, the test outputs, etc., are each fed into the model in a controlled way. It‚Äôs a far cry from ‚Äújust prompt an LLM to fix my bug‚Äù and hoping for the best.</p><h2><strong>The Challenge of Context Rot</strong></h2><p>As we get better at assembling rich context, we run into a new problem: Context can actually poison itself over time. This phenomenon, aptly termed ‚Äúcontext rot‚Äù by developer <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44308711#44310054\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Workaccount2</a> on Hacker News, describes how <strong>context quality degrades as conversations grow longer and accumulate distractions, dead-ends, and low-quality information.</strong></p><p>The pattern is frustratingly common: You start a session with a well-crafted context and clear instructions. The AI performs beautifully at first. But as the conversation continues‚Äîespecially if there are false starts, debugging attempts, or exploratory rabbit holes‚Äîthe context window fills with increasingly noisy information. The model‚Äôs responses gradually become less accurate and more confused, or it starts hallucinating.</p><p>Why does this happen? Context windows aren‚Äôt just storage‚Äîthey‚Äôre the model‚Äôs working memory. When that memory gets cluttered with failed attempts, contradictory information, or tangential discussions, it‚Äôs like trying to work at a desk covered in old drafts and unrelated papers. The model struggles to identify what‚Äôs currently relevant versus what‚Äôs historical noise. Earlier mistakes in the conversation can compound, creating a feedback loop where the model references its own poor outputs and spirals further off track.</p><p>This is especially problematic in iterative workflows‚Äîexactly the kind of complex tasks where context engineering shines. Debugging sessions, code refactoring, document editing, or research projects naturally involve false starts and course corrections. But each failed attempt leaves traces in the context that can interfere with subsequent reasoning.</p><p>Practical strategies for managing context rot include:</p><ul><li><strong>Context pruning and refresh:</strong> Workaccount2‚Äôs solution is ‚ÄúI work around it by regularly making summaries of instances, and then spinning up a new instance with fresh context and feed in the summary of the previous instance.‚Äù This approach preserves the essential state while discarding the noise. You‚Äôre essentially doing garbage collection for your context.</li><li><strong>Structured context boundaries:</strong> Use clear markers to separate different phases of work. For example, explicitly mark sections as ‚ÄúPrevious attempts (for reference only)‚Äù versus ‚ÄúCurrent working context.‚Äù This helps the model understand what to prioritize.</li><li><strong>Progressive context refinement:</strong> After significant progress, consciously rebuild the context from scratch. Extract the key decisions, successful approaches, and current state, then start fresh. It‚Äôs like refactoring code‚Äîoccasionally you need to clean up the accumulated cruft.</li><li> At regular intervals, have the model summarize what‚Äôs been accomplished and what the current state is. Use these summaries as seeds for fresh context when starting new sessions.</li><li> For very long tasks, break them into phases with natural boundaries where you can reset context. Each phase gets a clean start with only the essential carry-over from the previous phase.</li></ul><p>This challenge also highlights why ‚Äújust dump everything into the context‚Äù isn‚Äôt a viable long-term strategy. Like good software architecture, <strong>good context engineering requires intentional information management</strong>‚Äîdeciding not just what to include but also when to exclude, summarize, or refresh.</p><p><em>AI tools are quickly moving beyond chat UX to sophisticated agent interactions.

If you‚Äôre new to building apps or websites, you might be wondering how to keep your app running smoothly as more users join the party. Today, we‚Äôre diving into vertical scaling‚Äîa simple way to boost your app‚Äôs performance. Don‚Äôt worry, we‚Äôll keep it beginner-friendly with a clear explanation and a flowchart to make it super easy to understand. Let‚Äôs get started!.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What Is Vertical Scaling?</strong><br>\nImagine your app as a lemonade stand.At first, a small stand (your server, the computer running your app) can handle a few customers requesting drinks (user requests, like loading a webpage). But as your app grows popular, more customers show up, and your stand gets overwhelmed, slowing everything down.</p>\n\n<p>Vertical scaling (or ‚Äúscaling up‚Äù) is like upgrading your lemonade stand to a bigger, faster version. You keep the same stand but make it more powerful by:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Adding more CPU (like hiring a super-fast worker to pour drinks).</p></li>\n<li><p>Increasing RAM (like getting a bigger table to prep more drinks at once).</p></li>\n<li><p>Expanding storage (like adding a bigger fridge for more lemons).</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>This upgrade lets your server handle more users without changing how your app is built. Cool, right? But there‚Äôs a catch‚Äîlet‚Äôs see how it works first.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How Vertical Scaling Works</strong><br>\nHere‚Äôs the process in simple steps:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Spot the Problem: Your app slows down because too many users are hitting your server.</p></li>\n<li><p>Upgrade the Server: Add more CPU, RAM, or storage to the same machine.</p></li>\n<li><p>Restart and Test: Turn the server back on with its new power and check if it‚Äôs faster.</p></li>\n<li><p>Enjoy the Speed: Your app runs smoothly again‚Äîfor now!</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fzkct1rinmr0cb4px7cxm.png\" class=\"article-body-image-wrapper\"><img src=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fzkct1rinmr0cb4px7cxm.png\" alt=\" \" width=\"800\" height=\"533\"></a></p>\n\n<p><strong>Why Vertical Scaling Has Limits</strong></p>\n\n<p>Upgrading your server sounds like an easy win, but it‚Äôs not a perfect solution. Here are the main downsides everyone should know:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Hardware Limits: You can‚Äôt keep upgrading forever. Even the best server has a max amount of CPU, RAM, or storage. It‚Äôs like trying to stuff a whole grocery store‚Äôs worth of lemons into one fridge‚Äîit won‚Äôt fit! </p></li>\n<li><p>Cost: Powerful servers are pricey. Upgrading to a super-charged server can cost way more than you‚Äôd expect, like buying a fancy lemonade truck instead of a simple stand.</p></li>\n<li><p>Single Point of Failure (SPOF): If your one server crashes, your whole app goes down. Imagine your lemonade stand catching fire‚Äîno drinks for anyone until it‚Äôs fixed! </p></li>\n<li><p>Because of these limits, vertical scaling is a quick fix, not a long-term plan for apps with lots of users.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Because of these limits, vertical scaling is a quick fix, not a long-term plan for apps with lots of users.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What‚Äôs Next? A Hint at a Better Way</strong></p>\n\n<p>If vertical scaling isn‚Äôt the ultimate solution, what is? That‚Äôs where horizontal scaling (or ‚Äúscaling out‚Äù) comes in. Instead of making one server stronger, you add more servers to share the workload. It‚Äôs like opening new lemonade stands across town to serve more customers without overwhelming one stand.</p>\n\n<p>Horizontal scaling is a bit more complex, but it‚Äôs awesome for growing apps and keeping them reliable.

In Python, you use a <strong>complex number</strong> to do this. A Python complex number holds two values: one for the real part and one for the imaginary part. It uses <code>j</code> to show the imaginary part.</p>\n\n<p>Python complex numbers follow this form: <code>a + bj</code>, where <code>a</code> is the real part and <code>b</code> is the imaginary part. Both <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> are floating point numbers. You can write <code>3 + 4j</code>, and Python understands it as a complex number.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Python lets you create complex numbers using <code>j</code> syntax.</strong><br>\n</p>\n\n<div class=\"highlight js-code-highlight\">\n<pre class=\"highlight python\"><code><span class=\"n\">z</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"mi\">3</span> <span class=\"o\">+</span> <span class=\"mf\">4j</span>\n<span class=\"nf\">print</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">z</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>          <span class=\"c1\"># (3+4j)\n</span><span class=\"nf\">print</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">z</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"n\">real</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>     <span class=\"c1\"># 3.0\n</span><span class=\"nf\">print</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">z</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"n\">imag</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>     <span class=\"c1\"># 4.0\n</span></code></pre>\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>When you write a complex number, Python gives you access to the <code>.real</code> and <code>.imag</code> attributes. These show the real and imaginary parts as float values.</p>\n\n<h3>\n  \n  \n  How do Python complex numbers behave in math?\n</h3>\n\n<p>Python complex numbers support addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. You can also find the absolute value of a complex number using <code>abs()</code>. Python follows math rules for complex numbers. This makes it easy to use them in scientific and engineering code.</p>\n\n<p>You can do math between complex numbers or between complex and real numbers. Python does the type matching and gives you the correct result.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Python lets you perform math using complex numbers.</strong><br>\n</p>\n\n<div class=\"highlight js-code-highlight\">\n<pre class=\"highlight python\"><code><span class=\"n\">a</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"mi\">2</span> <span class=\"o\">+</span> <span class=\"mf\">3j</span>\n<span class=\"n\">b</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"mi\">1</span> <span class=\"o\">-</span> <span class=\"mf\">1j</span>\n\n<span class=\"nf\">print</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">a</span> <span class=\"o\">+</span> <span class=\"n\">b</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>    <span class=\"c1\"># (3+2j)\n</span><span class=\"nf\">print</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">a</span> <span class=\"o\">*</span> <span class=\"n\">b</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>    <span class=\"c1\"># (5+1j)\n</span><span class=\"nf\">print</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nf\">abs</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">a</span><span class=\"p\">))</span>   <span class=\"c1\"># 3.605551275463989\n</span></code></pre>\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>When you use <code>abs()</code> on a complex number, Python returns the distance from the origin in the complex plane. This is also called the modulus or magnitude.</p>\n\n\n\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  A Historical Timeline of Python Complex Numbers\n</h2>\n\n<p><strong>Where do Python‚Äôs complex number rules come from?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Python complex numbers reflect math ideas that go back hundreds of years. These rules were added to support scientific work, circuit modeling, and math research. Python includes built-in support to avoid requiring extra libraries for basic complex math.</p>\n\n\n\n\n<h3>\n  \n  \n  People invented ways to write imaginary numbers.\n</h3>\n\n<p><strong>1572 ‚Äî</strong>‚ÄØ<strong>Imaginary number notation</strong> Rafael Bombelli introduced the idea of square roots of negative numbers using <code>‚àö-1</code>.<br><br>\n<strong>1806 ‚Äî</strong>‚ÄØ<strong>The symbol <code>i</code> for imaginary</strong> Jean-Robert Argand popularized the use of <code>i</code> to represent imaginary values.</p>\n<h3>\n  \n  \n  People designed Python to support complex numbers.\n</h3>\n\n<p><strong>1991 ‚Äî</strong>‚ÄØ<strong>Built-in complex number type</strong> Python 0.9.0 included complex numbers as a native type using <code>j</code> for the imaginary part.<br><br>\n<strong>2001 ‚Äî</strong>‚ÄØ<strong>.real and .imag attributes</strong> Python 2.2 gave easy access to the parts of a complex number.<br><br>\n<strong>2011 ‚Äî</strong>‚ÄØ<strong><code>cmath</code> module extended</strong> Python 3.2 improved math for complex numbers with logarithms and trigonometric functions.</p>\n<h3>\n  \n  \n  People kept Python complex numbers simple and stable.\n</h3>\n\n<p><strong>2023 ‚Äî</strong>‚ÄØ<strong>No changes to syntax or structure</strong> Complex numbers remain stable and well-supported.<br><br>\n<strong>2025 ‚Äî</strong>‚ÄØ<strong>Python core team supports built-in math</strong> The format <code>a + bj</code> remains the preferred way to write complex values.</p>\n\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  Problems &amp; Solutions with Python Complex Numbers\n</h2>\n\n<p><strong>How do you use Python complex numbers the right way?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Python complex numbers help when you need both real and imaginary values. You can model waves, signals, or rotations. The problems below show how to write, inspect, and work with Python complex values in code.</p>\n\n\n<h3>\n  \n  \n  Problem: How do you store a number with a real and imaginary part in Python?\n</h3>\n\n<p>You are modeling a circuit or signal. The result has both a real part and an imaginary part. You need a way to store both parts in one value.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Problem:</strong> You try using a tuple like <code>(3, 4)</code> or two separate variables, but that makes math harder.<br><br>\n<strong>Solution:</strong> Use a Python complex number using the <code>j</code> suffix to store both parts together.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Python lets you store real and imaginary parts using complex syntax.</strong><br>\n</p>\n\n<div class=\"highlight js-code-highlight\">\n<pre class=\"highlight python\"><code><span class=\"n\">z</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"mi\">3</span> <span class=\"o\">+</span> <span class=\"mf\">4j</span>\n<span class=\"nf\">print</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">z</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>        <span class=\"c1\"># (3+4j)\n</span><span class=\"nf\">print</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">z</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"n\">real</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>   <span class=\"c1\"># 3.0\n</span><span class=\"nf\">print</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">z</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"n\">imag</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>   <span class=\"c1\"># 4.0\n</span></code></pre>\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>This gives you one object with two float parts.

From customer interactions and social media engagement to operational metrics and financial transactions, businesses are swimming in an ocean of information. However, raw data alone holds little value‚Äîits true power lies in the insights extracted through systematic analysis. Data analytics has emerged as the cornerstone of modern business strategy, enabling organizations to transform scattered information into actionable intelligence that drives growth, innovation, and competitive advantage.<br>\nThe evolution of data analytics from a nice-to-have tool to an essential business function reflects the fundamental shift in how successful companies operate. Organizations that harness the power of data analytics are not just surviving in today's competitive marketplace‚Äîthey're thriving by making informed decisions, optimizing operations, and creating exceptional customer experiences.</p>\n\n<p>Understanding Data Analytics: The Foundation of Informed Decision-Making<br>\nData analytics encompasses the systematic examination of datasets to draw meaningful conclusions about the information they contain. This multifaceted discipline combines statistical analysis, predictive modeling, machine learning algorithms, and visualization techniques to uncover patterns, trends, and relationships within data that might otherwise remain hidden.<br>\nThe Four Pillars of Data Analytics</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Descriptive Analytics This foundational level answers the question \"What happened?\" by examining historical data to understand past performance and identify trends. Descriptive analytics provides context for decision-making by creating comprehensive reports, dashboards, and summaries that illuminate business operations.</li>\n<li>Diagnostic Analytics Building upon descriptive insights, diagnostic analytics delves deeper to answer \"Why did it happen?\" This approach uses techniques like drill-down analysis, data mining, and correlation studies to identify root causes and understand the relationships between different variables.</li>\n<li>Predictive Analytics Perhaps the most powerful application, predictive analytics leverages statistical models and machine learning algorithms to forecast future outcomes. By analyzing historical patterns and current trends, organizations can anticipate customer behavior, market changes, and operational challenges.</li>\n<li>Prescriptive Analytics The most advanced form of analytics, prescriptive analysis goes beyond prediction to recommend specific actions. This approach combines optimization techniques, simulation models, and artificial intelligence to suggest the best course of action for achieving desired outcomes.\nThe Strategic Importance of Data Analytics in Business Operations\nEnhanced Decision-Making Through Evidence-Based Insights\nTraditional business decisions often relied on intuition, experience, and limited information. While these factors remain valuable, data analytics provides objective evidence that reduces uncertainty and improves decision quality.

The key to my ability to do this was to use\n  Expansion Joints - parts of the talk that I'd\n  pre-planned so I could cover them quickly or slowly depending on how much time\n  I had.</p><p>The way I'd do this would be to plan for some topics to be optional. The\n  talk would work if I skipped over them, but I could also witter on about them\n  for five (or ten) minutes. Ideally, each of these topics would get one slide,\n  usually with a bunch of key phrases on it - the headings of what I'd talk\n  about should I be talking about it. When I got to the slide, I'd look at how\n  time was going with the talk. If (as was usually the case) I was running short\n  of time, I could cover the slide in about thirty seconds, saying something\n  like: ‚Äúin doing this, there's a bunch of things you need to consider, but they\n  are out of scope for today's talk‚Äù.</p><p>If, however, I did have time, I could then spend some time talking about\n  them. The slide would be simple, and not provide much of a <a href=\"https://martinfowler.com/bliki/VisualChannel.html\">Visual Channel</a>, but that wasn't so important, after all this material\n  was optional in the first place.</p><p>The single flex-slide was my favorite Expansion Joint, as it was easy to\n  use. Sometimes however my optional topic required a proper visual channel,\n  necessitating dedicated slides. My solution here was good control over\n  slide handling. Presentation tools include the ability to skip over slides\n  while I'm talking, and I made sure I practiced how to use them so I could skip\n  a bunch of slides without the audience knowing. It's crucial here that it's\n  invisible to the audience, I find it looks sloppy if anyone says ‚Äúin the\n  interests of time I'll skip over these slides‚Äù. To do this, however, I do need\n  access to my laptop while presenting, venues that only provide a clicker while\n  loading the slides on some other machine lack that control. That started to\n  happen in my last couple of years, much to my annoyance.</p><p>When creating talks, I was always worried that I would run out of things to\n  say, even though experience told me I reliably crammed more stuff in than I\n  could possibly cover. Expansion Joints helped with this, I could aggressively\n  trim the core talk to less than I needed, and rely on the Expansion Joints to\n  fill the gap. In practice I usually didn't need the Expansion Joints anyway, but\n  their presence helped my confidence.</p><p>Using Expansion Joints was particularly important for me as I never\n  rehearsed my talks. I was always someone whose ability to present was driven by\n  adrenaline. Talking to a rubber duck just didn't work, the duck was clearly\n  every bit as bored as I was. Consequently the first time I gave a talk, I was\n  hazy as to how long it would take. Yet with Expansion Joints in place, I was\n  able to finish a talk right on time.</p><p>Expansion Joints enabled me to give the same talk\n  to different time slots. Sometimes I'd have thirty minutes, sometimes\n  forty-five. With Expansion Joints, I didn't need to change my slides,\n  particularly handy if a time cut (or more rarely a time increase) appeared at the\n  last moment.

Traditional relational databases work well when you want to store structured rows and columns, but they struggle when you need to explore relationships. That‚Äôs where graph databases come in.</p>\n\n<p>Neo4j is one of the most popular graph databases, and its free cloud service Neo4j Aura makes it simple for students and developers to get started. In this post, I‚Äôll demonstrate how I used Neo4j Aura to build a university course recommendation system.</p>\n\n<p>This project models students, courses, professors, and departments as nodes, and their connections as relationships. With just a few Cypher queries, we can recommend courses to students based on their peers‚Äô enrollments.</p>\n\n\n\n\n<p>Why Graph Databases?</p>\n\n<p>Imagine you want to answer a question like:</p>\n\n<p>‚ÄúWhich courses are taken by students similar to me?‚Äù</p>\n\n<p>‚ÄúWhich professors are most connected to AI-related courses?‚Äù</p>\n\n<p>In SQL, these queries would require multiple joins and be quite complex. In Neo4j, however, these queries are natural because the relationships are stored as first-class citizens in the database.</p>\n\n<p>Graphs allow you to think in terms of connections, which is ideal for recommendation systems.</p>\n\n\n\n\n<p>Data Model</p>\n\n<p>For this project, I used four main types of nodes:</p>\n\n<p>Student ‚Üí Represents a university student</p>\n\n<p>Course ‚Üí Represents a subject or course</p>\n\n<p>Professor ‚Üí Represents a teacher who teaches a course</p>\n\n<p>Department ‚Üí Represents the academic department</p>\n\n<p>Relationships include:</p>\n\n<p>(:Student)-[:ENROLLED_IN]-&gt;(:Course)</p>\n\n<p>(:Professor)-[:TEACHES]-&gt;(:Course)</p>\n\n<p>(:Course)-[:PART_OF]-&gt;(:Department)</p>\n\n<p>This simple schema is powerful enough to answer interesting queries.</p>\n\n<p>Here‚Äôs a small example:</p>\n\n<p>(Aryan:Student) -[:ENROLLED_IN]-&gt;

It spits out predictions, but how do you <em>really</em> know how good it is? That's where confusion matrices and ROC curves (with their AUC) come in. These powerful tools provide a detailed look into your model's performance, going far beyond simple accuracy scores. They're essential for understanding the nuances of your model's predictions and making informed decisions.</p>\n\n<h3>\n  \n  \n  Understanding the Confusion Matrix: A Four-Square Story\n</h3>\n\n<p>At its heart, a confusion matrix is a simple table summarizing the performance of a classification model. It compares the model's predictions to the actual ground truth values. Let's break down the four key components:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>True Positives (TP):</strong>  The model correctly predicted the positive class (e.g., correctly identified a fraudulent transaction).</li>\n<li>\n<strong>True Negatives (TN):</strong> The model correctly predicted the negative class (e.g., correctly identified a legitimate transaction).</li>\n<li>\n<strong>False Positives (FP):</strong> The model incorrectly predicted the positive class (a Type I error ‚Äì also known as a false alarm; e.g., flagged a legitimate transaction as fraudulent).</li>\n<li>\n<strong>False Negatives (FN):</strong> The model incorrectly predicted the negative class (a Type II error ‚Äì a missed detection; e.g., failed to identify a fraudulent transaction).</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Here's a visual representation:</p>\n\n<p>| | Predicted Positive | Predicted Negative | |-------------|---------------------|---------------------| | <strong>Actual Positive</strong> | TP | FN | | <strong>Actual Negative</strong> | FP | TN |</p>\n\n<p>From this matrix, we can derive several crucial metrics:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Accuracy:</strong> (TP + TN) / (TP + TN + FP + FN) ‚Äì  The overall correctness of the model.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Precision:</strong> TP / (TP + FP) ‚Äì  The proportion of correctly predicted positive instances out of all instances predicted as positive.  High precision means fewer false positives.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Recall (Sensitivity):</strong> TP / (TP + FN) ‚Äì The proportion of correctly predicted positive instances out of all actual positive instances. High recall means fewer false negatives.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Specificity:</strong> TN / (TN + FP) ‚Äì The proportion of correctly predicted negative instances out of all actual negative instances. High specificity means fewer false positives.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>\n  \n  \n  ROC Curves and AUC: Visualizing Performance Beyond Accuracy\n</h3>\n\n<p>While the confusion matrix provides valuable insights, it only reflects the performance at a single decision threshold. ROC curves offer a more comprehensive view by plotting the True Positive Rate (TPR, or Recall) against the False Positive Rate (FPR) at various thresholds.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>TPR (Recall):</strong> TP / (TP + FN)</li>\n<li>\n<strong>FPR:</strong> FP / (FP + TN)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The ROC curve is generated by varying the classification threshold. A perfect classifier would have a TPR of 1 and an FPR of 0, residing at the top-left corner of the plot. A random classifier would produce a diagonal line.</p>\n\n<p>The Area Under the Curve (AUC) quantifies the overall performance of the classifier. An AUC of 1 represents a perfect classifier, while an AUC of 0.5 indicates a random classifier. Higher AUC values generally indicate better performance.</p>\n\n<h4>\n  \n  \n  Illustrative Python Snippet (Conceptual):\n</h4>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"highlight js-code-highlight\">\n<pre class=\"highlight python\"><code><span class=\"c1\"># This is a simplified conceptual example, not production-ready code.\n</span><span class=\"k\">def</span> <span class=\"nf\">calculate_roc_point</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">threshold</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"n\">predictions</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"n\">labels</span><span class=\"p\">):</span>\n  <span class=\"sh\">\"\"\"</span><span class=\"s\">Calculates a single point on the ROC curve.</span><span class=\"sh\">\"\"\"</span>\n  <span class=\"n\">tp</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"mi\">0</span>\n  <span class=\"n\">fp</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"mi\">0</span>\n  <span class=\"n\">fn</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"mi\">0</span>\n  <span class=\"n\">tn</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"mi\">0</span>\n  <span class=\"k\">for</span> <span class=\"n\">i</span> <span class=\"ow\">in</span> <span class=\"nf\">range</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nf\">len</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">predictions</span><span class=\"p\">)):</span>\n    <span class=\"k\">if</span> <span class=\"n\">predictions</span><span class=\"p\">[</span><span class=\"n\">i</span><span class=\"p\">]</span> <span class=\"o\">&gt;=</span> <span class=\"n\">threshold</span> <span class=\"ow\">and</span> <span class=\"n\">labels</span><span class=\"p\">[</span><span class=\"n\">i</span><span class=\"p\">]</span> <span class=\"o\">==</span> <span class=\"mi\">1</span><span class=\"p\">:</span>  <span class=\"c1\"># Correct positive prediction\n</span>      <span class=\"n\">tp</span> <span class=\"o\">+=</span> <span class=\"mi\">1</span>\n    <span class=\"k\">elif</span> <span class=\"n\">predictions</span><span class=\"p\">[</span><span class=\"n\">i</span><span class=\"p\">]</span> <span class=\"o\">&gt;=</span> <span class=\"n\">threshold</span> <span class=\"ow\">and</span> <span class=\"n\">labels</span><span class=\"p\">[</span><span class=\"n\">i</span><span class=\"p\">]</span> <span class=\"o\">==</span> <span class=\"mi\">0</span><span class=\"p\">:</span>  <span class=\"c1\"># Incorrect positive prediction\n</span>      <span class=\"n\">fp</span> <span class=\"o\">+=</span> <span class=\"mi\">1</span>\n    <span class=\"k\">elif</span> <span class=\"n\">predictions</span><span class=\"p\">[</span><span class=\"n\">i</span><span class=\"p\">]</span> <span class=\"o\">&lt;</span> <span class=\"n\">threshold</span> <span class=\"ow\">and</span> <span class=\"n\">labels</span><span class=\"p\">[</span><span class=\"n\">i</span><span class=\"p\">]</span> <span class=\"o\">==</span> <span class=\"mi\">1</span><span class=\"p\">:</span>  <span class=\"c1\"># Incorrect negative prediction\n</span>      <span class=\"n\">fn</span> <span class=\"o\">+=</span> <span class=\"mi\">1</span>\n    <span class=\"k\">else</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"c1\"># Correct negative prediction\n</span>      <span class=\"n\">tn</span> <span class=\"o\">+=</span> <span class=\"mi\">1</span>\n  <span class=\"n\">tpr</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"n\">tp</span> <span class=\"o\">/</span> <span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">tp</span> <span class=\"o\">+</span> <span class=\"n\">fn</span><span class=\"p\">)</span> <span class=\"nf\">if </span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">tp</span> <span class=\"o\">+</span> <span class=\"n\">fn</span><span class=\"p\">)</span> <span class=\"o\">&gt;</span> <span class=\"mi\">0</span> <span class=\"k\">else</span> <span class=\"mi\">0</span>\n  <span class=\"n\">fpr</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"n\">fp</span> <span class=\"o\">/</span> <span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">fp</span> <span class=\"o\">+</span> <span class=\"n\">tn</span><span class=\"p\">)</span> <span class=\"nf\">if </span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">fp</span> <span class=\"o\">+</span> <span class=\"n\">tn</span><span class=\"p\">)</span> <span class=\"o\">&gt;</span> <span class=\"mi\">0</span> <span class=\"k\">else</span> <span class=\"mi\">0</span>\n  <span class=\"k\">return</span> <span class=\"n\">tpr</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"n\">fpr</span>\n\n\n<span class=\"c1\"># ...

With a decade of Go projects under my belt, I‚Äôll share battle-tested tips, code snippets, and pitfalls to help you write race-free, high-performance code. We‚Äôll cover , , , Go‚Äôs  tool, and a task queue example, plus advanced patterns to level up your skills.</p><p>Let‚Äôs dive in and make your Go concurrency code sing!</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  1. Go Concurrency : The Essentials\n</h2><h3>\n  \n  \n  1.1 Goroutines and Channels\n</h3><p>Go‚Äôs concurrency shines with ‚Äîlightweight threads managed by the Go runtime‚Äîand , which sync and pass data between them. Goroutines are cheap (a few KB each), so you can launch thousands without worry. Channels let goroutines communicate safely, following Go‚Äôs mantra: ‚ÄúShare memory by communicating, not by sharing memory.‚Äù</p><p>Think of goroutines as chefs sharing a kitchen and channels as a choreographed handoff of ingredients. Without coordination, you get a mess‚Äîaka race conditions.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  1.2 Race Conditions and Memory Synchronization\n</h3><p> ensures goroutines access shared memory predictably. Go‚Äôs memory model defines  rules, like a channel send completing before its receive. Without sync, you risk , where goroutines clash over shared memory, and at least one writes. For example, two goroutines incrementing  can overwrite each other, losing updates.</p><div><table><thead><tr></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Predictable memory access across goroutines</td></tr><tr><td>Unsynchronized access with a write</td><td>Causes bugs, crashes, or data loss</td></tr><tr><td>Go‚Äôs operation order guarantee</td></tr></tbody></table></div><h3>\n  \n  \n  1.3 Your Concurrency Toolbox\n</h3><ul><li> and : Locks for shared data.</li><li>: Waits for goroutines to finish.</li><li>: Lock-free ops for counters or flags.</li><li>: Sync and communicate elegantly.</li></ul><p>Let‚Äôs explore how to wield these tools.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Segment 2: Refined Synchronization Techniques\n</h3><h2>\n  \n  \n  2. Sync Like a Pro: Mutexes, Atomics, and Channels\n</h2><p>Memory synchronization keeps goroutines in check. Here‚Äôs how to use , , and , with examples and real-world lessons.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  2.1 Mutex and RWMutex: Guarding the Gates\n</h3><p> locks ensure one goroutine accesses shared data at a time.  optimizes for read-heavy workloads, allowing multiple readers but exclusive writers. Here‚Äôs a safe counter:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p> shines for caches with frequent reads. : A global Mutex in a payment API caused 500ms latency spikes. Sharding data with per-partition Mutexes cut latency to 60ms. : Keep locks granular to avoid bottlenecks.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  2.2 Atomic Operations: Speed Without Locks\n</h3><p> offers lock-free operations for simple tasks like counters, using CPU instructions like Compare-And-Swap (CAS). Here‚Äôs the counter, atomic-style:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>: In an e-commerce app, atomics for inventory deductions boosted performance by 40% during peak traffic. : You need fast, simple updates like counters or flags.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  2.3 Channels: Sync with Elegance\n</h3><p> blend communication and synchronization.  enforce strict sync;  add flexibility. Here‚Äôs a producer-consumer setup:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>: In a log pipeline, an unbuffered channel bottlenecked producers.

Outsmarting Race Conditions\n</h2><p>Race conditions are sneaky bugs that strike under load. Let‚Äôs learn to detect and prevent them.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  3.1 What Causes Race Conditions?\n</h3><p>A race condition occurs when goroutines access shared memory concurrently, with at least one writing, and no sync. Here‚Äôs a buggy counter:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>: Data corruption, crashes, or debugging headaches.</p><p>Run  to catch races. For the above, it flags:</p><div><pre><code>WARNING: DATA RACE\nRead at 0x00c0000a4010 by goroutine 8:\n  main.(*Counter).Inc()\n      main.go:12 +0x44\n...\nWrite at 0x00c0000a4010 by goroutine 7:\n  main.(*Counter).Inc()\n      main.go:12 +0x55\n</code></pre></div><p>: Add  to your CI/CD pipeline.

Advanced Concurrency Patterns\n</h2><p>Let‚Äôs level up with two advanced patterns for real-world Go apps.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  4.1 Worker Pool with Context\n</h3><p>A worker pool distributes tasks across goroutines, with  for cancellation. Here‚Äôs a snippet:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>: Context enables graceful shutdown, critical for production apps.</p><p>Fan-out splits tasks across workers; fan-in collects results. Here‚Äôs a simplified example:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>: Parallel data processing, like image resizing or API calls.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Segment 4: Refined Task Queue and Wrap-Up\n</h3><h2>\n  \n  \n  5. A Battle-Tested Task Queue\n</h2><p>Here‚Äôs an improved task queue combining channels, Mutexes, atomics, and context:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><ul><li>Added  for task submission with cancellation.</li><li>Improved error handling for full queues or closed state.</li><li>Kept atomic counter and buffered channel for performance.</li></ul><p>: Race-free (verified with ), handles 100 tasks with ~100ms latency using 3 workers and a buffer of 10.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  6. Wrap-Up: Be a Go Concurrency Ninja\n</h2><p>Go‚Äôs  and  make concurrency fun, but race conditions can sneak in. Use  for shared data,  for fast counters, and  for coordination.

Tracing was the first signal the project tackled, and its now generally available in most major programming languages.</p><p>Personally, Im a big fan of tracing. I think its a much cleaner and more effective way to pass data to your observability provider. they can take that data and turn it into something truly useful, whether thats a Gantt style view of spans or metrics that drive alerts.</p><p>One of the most powerful features is distributed tracing. the ability to connect spans across different services into a single trace. When one service makes an RPC call to another, the trace context can follow along, giving you a complete, end-to-end view of requests across your entire platform.</p><p>In the screenshot above for example,the trace has spans from 3 different services: , , and .</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  What is trace propagation?\n</h2><p>To connect traces across different services, you need to pass some context along with each request. This process is known as trace propagation, and its what we will be diving into in this article.</p><p>Unless you are working with a legacy system that already uses a different tracing format, you should stick with the <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/TR/trace-context/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">W3C Trace Context Recommendation</a>. Its the recommended standard for propagating trace context over HTTP. While its designed with HTTP in mind, many of its concepts can also be applied to other communication channels, like Kafka messages, for example.</p><p>Trace Context specifies two HTTP headers that will be used to pass context around, traceparent and tracestate</p><p>The traceparent HTTP header includes the root of context propagation. It consists in a comma-separated suite of fields that include:</p><ul><li><p>The version of Trace Context being used. Only one version, 00 exists in 2023\nThen, for version 00:</p></li><li><p>The current Trace ID, as a 16-byte array representing the ID of the entire trace.</p></li><li><p>The current Span ID (called parent-id in the spec), an 8-byte array representing the ID of the parent request.</p></li><li><p>Flags, an 8-byte hex-encoded field which controls tracing flags such as sampling.</p></li></ul><p>The tracestate HTTP header is meant to include proprietary data used to pass specific information across traces.</p><p>Its value is a comma-separated list of key/values, where each pair is separated by an equal sign. Obviously, the trace state shouldn‚Äôt include any sensitive data.</p><p>For example, with requests coming from public API endpoints which can be called either by internal services, or by external customers, both could be passing a traceparent header. However, external ones would generate orphan spans, as the parent one is stored within the customers service, not ours.</p><p>So we add a tracestate value indicating the request comes from an internal service, and we only propagate context if that value is present</p><p>With both these fields being passed, any tracing library should have enough information to provide distributed tracing.</p><p>A request could pass the following headers:<code>traceparent: 00-d4cda95b652f4a1592b449d5929fda1b-6e0c63257de34c92-01\ntracestate: myservice=true</code></p><p>The traceparent header indicates a trace ID <code>(d4cda95b652f4a1592b449d5929fda1b)</code>, a span ID , and sets a flag indicating the parent span was sampled (so its likely we want to sample this one too).</p><p>The tracestate header provides a specific key/value that we can use to make appropriate decisions, such as whether we want to keep the context or not.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  How OpenTelemetry implements propagation\n</h2><p>The OpenTelemetry <a href=\"https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/blob/main/specification/context/api-propagators.md\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">specification </a>defines a Propagators interface to allow any implementation to establish its own propagation convention, such as W3C TraceContext.</p><p>A propagator must implement two methods:</p><ol><li><p> ‚Äì to insert the current span context into a carrier object (such as an HTTP headers map).</p></li><li><p>‚Äì to retrieve the span context from a carrier object.</p></li></ol><p>Each instrumentation library making or receiving external calls then has the responsibility to call inject/extract to write/read the span context and have it passed around.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Extract and Inject examples\n</h2><p>For example, the following is <a href=\"https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-ruby-contrib/blob/6e89c92f189bc6e187da06ea2af4e38531b93601/instrumentation/rack/lib/opentelemetry/instrumentation/rack/middlewares/tracer_middleware.rb#L69-L72\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Rack extracting</a> the context from the propagator to generate a new span in Ruby:</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  The full propagation flow\n</h2><p><a href=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fcca2z6txp0nxvzvpf7qz.png\"><img src=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fcca2z6txp0nxvzvpf7qz.png\" alt=\" \" width=\"800\" height=\"290\"></a>\nTo put in other words, the diagram above shows what each service is expected to perform to enable propagation. The library emitting an HTTP call is expected to call inject, which will add the proper HTTP headers to the request. The library receiving HTTP requests is expected to call extract to retrieve the proper span context from the request‚Äôs HTTP headers.</p><p>Note that each language implementation of OpenTelemetry provides multiple contrib packages that allow easy instrumentation of common frameworks and libraries. Those packages will handle propagation for you. Unless you write your own framework or HTTP library, you should not need to call inject or extract yourself. All you need to do is configure the global propagation mechanism (see below).</p><p>Not all services communicate through HTTP. For example, you could have one service emitting a Kafka message, and another one reading it.</p><p>The OpenTelemetry propagation API is purposefully generic, as all it does is read a hash and return a span context, or read a span context and inject data into a hash. So you could replace a hash of HTTP headers with anything you want.</p><p>Any language or library that uses the same convention can benefit from distributed tracing within kafka messages, or any other communication mechanism.</p><p>As you may have seen in the above specification link, the default propagator will be a no-op:</p><p><em>The OpenTelemetry API MUST use no-op propagators unless explicitly configured otherwise</em></p><p>You should therefore always ensure your propagator of choice is properly set globally, and each library that needs to call inject or extract will then be able to retrieve it.</p><p>Thanks for following along with this deep dive into context propagation in Otel. Hopefully, you now have a clearer understanding of how distributed tracing works within the library. You should be equipped to implement context propagation in any library instrumentation that makes or receives calls from external services.</p><p>With distributed tracing properly set up across your platform, you will be able to see the full journey of every request, making it much easier to identify bottlenecks, trace issues, and debug problems effectively</p>","contentLength":6359,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Title: The Impact of Trump's New Tariffs: Who's Getting Hit and By How Much","url":"https://dev.to/yagyaraj_sharma_6cd410179/title-the-impact-of-trumps-new-tariffs-whos-getting-hit-and-by-how-much-3958","date":1755476724,"author":"Insights YRS","guid":230733,"unread":true,"content":"<h2>\n  \n  \n  Title: The Impact of Trump's New Tariffs: Who's Getting Hit and By How Much\n</h2>\n\n<p>Introduction:</p>\n\n<p>On August 7th, 2019, President Trump's \"reciprocal\" tariffs on imported goods from China will officially take effect.

Trust calibration is the practice of aligning the level of trust that users have in our products with its actual capabilities. </p></div><p>If we build things that our users trust too blindly, we risk facilitating dangerous or destructive interactions that can permanently turn users off. If they don‚Äôt trust our product enough, it will feel useless or less capable than it actually is. </p><p>So what does trust calibration look like in practice and how do we achieve it? A 2023 study reviewed over 1000 papers on trust and trust calibration in human / automated systems (properly referenced at the end of this article). It holds some pretty eye-opening insights ‚Äì and some inconvenient truths ‚Äì for people building AI software. I‚Äôve tried to extract just the juicy bits below.   </p><p>Let‚Äôs begin with a critical point. There is a limit to how deeply we want users to trust our products. Designing for calibrated trust is the goal, not more trust at any cost. Shoddy trust calibration leads to two equally undesirable outcomes: </p><ul><li> causes users to rely on AI systems in situations where they shouldn‚Äôt (I told my code assistant to fix a bug in prod and went to bed).\n</li><li> causes users to reject AI assistance even when it would be beneficial, resulting in reduced perception of value and increased user workload.\n</li></ul><p>What does calibrated trust look like for your product? It‚Äôs important to understand that determining this is less about trying to diagram a set of abstract trust parameters and more about helping users develop accurate mental models of your product‚Äôs capabilities and limitations. In most cases, this requires thinking beyond the trust calibration mechanisms we default to, like confidence scores. </p><p>For example, Cursor‚Äôs most prominent trust calibration mechanism is its change suggestion highlighting. The code that the model suggests we change is highlighted in red, followed by suggested changes highlighted in green. This  immediately communicates that ‚Äúthis is a suggestion, not a command.‚Äù </p><p>In contrast, Tesla‚Äôs Autopilot is a delegative system. It must calibrate trust differently through detailed capability explanations, clear operational boundaries (only on highways), and prominent disengagement alerts when conditions exceed system limits. </p><h2><a href=\"https://fly.io/blog/trust-calibration-for-ai-software-builders/#building-cooperative-systems\" aria-label=\"Anchor\"></a></h2><p>Perhaps the most fundamental consideration in determining high level trust calibration objectives is deciding whether your project is designed to be a cooperative or a delegative tool.  </p><p>Cooperative systems generally call for lower levels of trust because users can choose whether to accept or reject AI suggestions. But these systems also face a unique risk. It‚Äôs easy for over-trust to gradually transform user complacency into over-reliance, effectively transforming what we designed as a cooperative relationship into a delegative one, only without any of the required safeguards.</p><p>If you‚Äôre building a coding assistant, content generator, or design tool, implement visible ‚Äúsuggestion boundaries‚Äù which make it clear when the AI is offering ideas versus making decisions. Grammarly does this well by underlining suggestions rather than auto-correcting, and showing rationale on hover. </p><p>For higher-stakes interactions, consider introducing friction. Require explicit confirmation before applying AI suggestions to production code or publishing AI-generated content.</p><h2><a href=\"https://fly.io/blog/trust-calibration-for-ai-software-builders/#building-delegative-systems\" aria-label=\"Anchor\"></a></h2><p>In contrast, users expect delegative systems to replace human action entirely. Blind trust in the system is a requirement for it to be considered valuable at all. </p><p>If you‚Äôre building automation tools, smart scheduling, or decision-making systems, invest heavily in capability communication and boundary setting. Calendly‚Äôs smart scheduling works because it clearly communicates what it will and won‚Äôt do (I‚Äôll find times that work for both of us vs. I‚Äôll reschedule your existing meetings). Build robust fallback mechanisms and make system limitations prominent in your onboarding.  </p><p>The study suggests that when we make trust calibrations is at least as important as how. There are three critical windows for trust calibration, each with their own opportunities and challenges. </p><ul><li><strong>Pre-interaction calibration</strong> happens before users engage with the system. Docs and tutorials fall into this category. Setting expectations up front can prevent initial over-trust, which is disproportionally more difficult to correct later. \n</li></ul><blockquote><p>Pre-interaction calibrations could look like capability-focused onboarding that shows both successes and failures. Rather than just demonstrating perfect AI outputs, show users examples where the AI makes mistakes and how to catch them. </p></blockquote><ul><li><strong>During-interaction calibration</strong> is trust adjustment through real-time feedback. Dynamically updated cues improve trust calibration better than static displays, and adaptive calibration that responds to user behavior outperforms systems that display static information. \n</li></ul><blockquote><p>Build confidence indicators that are updated based on context, not just model confidence. For example, if you‚Äôre building a document AI, show higher confidence for standard document types the system has seen thousands of times, and lower confidence for unusual formats. </p></blockquote><ul><li><strong>Post-interaction calibration</strong> focuses on learning and adjustment that helps users understand successes and failures in the system after interactions. These aren‚Äôt reliable, since by the time users receive the information, their trust patterns are set and hard to change. \n</li></ul><blockquote><p>Post-interaction feedback can still be valuable for teaching. Create ‚Äúreflection moments‚Äù after significant interactions. Midjourney does this by letting users rate image outputs, helping users learn what prompts work best while calibrating their expectations for future generations. </p></blockquote><p>Trust is front-loaded and habit-driven. The most effective calibration happens before and during use, when expectations are still forming and behaviors can still be shifted. Any later and you‚Äôre mostly fighting entrenched patterns.</p><h2><a href=\"https://fly.io/blog/trust-calibration-for-ai-software-builders/#performance-vs-process-information\" aria-label=\"Anchor\"></a></h2><p>Users can be guided through performance-oriented signals (what the system can do) or process-oriented signals (how it works). The real challenge is matching the right kind of explanation to the right user, at the right moment.</p><ul><li><strong>Performance-oriented calibration</strong> focuses on communicating capability through mechanisms like reliability statistics, confidence scores, and clear capability boundaries. \n</li><li><strong>Process-oriented calibration</strong> offers detailed explanations of decision-making processes, breakdowns of which factors influenced decisions, and reasoning transparency. \n</li></ul><p>Process transparency seems like the obvious go-to at first glance, but the effectiveness of process explanations varies wildly based on user expertise and domain knowledge. If we are designing for a set of users that may fall anywhere on this spectrum, we have to avoid creating information overload for novice users while providing sufficient information to expert users who want the detail.  </p><p>The most effective systems in the study combined both approaches, providing layered information that allows users to access the level of detail most appropriate for their expertise and current needs.</p><h2><a href=\"https://fly.io/blog/trust-calibration-for-ai-software-builders/#static-vs-adaptive-calibration\" aria-label=\"Anchor\"></a></h2><p>I really wanted to ignore this part, because it feels like the study‚Äôs authors are passive aggressively adding todos to my projects. In a nutshell, adaptive calibration ‚Äì when a system actively monitors user behavior and adjusts its communication accordingly - is orders of magnitude more effective than static calibration while delivering the same information to every user, regardless of differences in expertise, trust propensity, or behavior.  </p><p>Static calibration mechanisms are easy to build and maintain, which is why we like them. But the stark reality is that they put the burden of appropriate calibration entirely on our users. We‚Äôre making it their job to adapt their behaviour based on generic information.</p><p>This finding has zero respect for our time or mental health, but it also reveals a legit opportunity for clever builders to truly separate their product from the herd.</p><h2><a href=\"https://fly.io/blog/trust-calibration-for-ai-software-builders/#practical-adaptive-calibration-techniques\" aria-label=\"Anchor\"></a></h2><ul><li> Track how often users accept vs. reject suggestions and adjust confidence thresholds accordingly. If a user consistently rejects high-confidence suggestions, lower the threshold for showing uncertainty.\n</li><li> Adjust trust signals based on use context. A writing AI might show higher confidence for grammar fixes than creative suggestions, or lower confidence late at night when users might be tired.\n</li><li> Users who frequently make sophisticated edits to AI output probably want more detailed explanations than those who typically accept entire file rewrites.\n</li></ul><p>The idea that transparency and explainability can actually harm trust calibration is easily the point that hit me the hardest. While explanations can improve user understanding, they can also create information overload that reduces users‚Äô ability to detect and correct trash output. What‚Äôs worse, explanations can create a whole new layer of trust calibration issues, with users over-trusting the explanation mechanism itself, rather than critically evaluating the actual output.</p><p>This suggests that quality over quantity should be our design philosophy when it comes to transparency. We should provide carefully crafted, relevant information rather than comprehensive but overwhelming detail. The goal should be enabling better decision-making rather than simply satisfying user curiosity about system internals.</p><h2><a href=\"https://fly.io/blog/trust-calibration-for-ai-software-builders/#anthropomorphism-and-unwarranted-trust\" aria-label=\"Anchor\"></a></h2><p>It seems obvious that we should make interactions with our AI project feel as human as possible. Well, it turns out that systems that appear more human-like through design, language, or interaction patterns are notoriously good at increasing user trust beyond actual system capabilities. </p><p>So it‚Äôs entirely possible that building more traditional human-computer interactions can actually make our AI projects safer to use and therefore, more user-friendly.  </p><ul><li> Frame outputs as ‚Äúanalysis suggests‚Äù rather than ‚ÄúI think‚Äù or ‚ÄúI believe‚Äù\n</li><li><strong>Embrace machine-like precision:</strong> Show exact confidence percentages rather than human-like hedging (‚ÄúI‚Äôm pretty sure that‚Ä¶)\n</li></ul><h2><a href=\"https://fly.io/blog/trust-calibration-for-ai-software-builders/#trust-falls-faster-than-it-climbs\" aria-label=\"Anchor\"></a></h2><p>Nothing particularly groundbreaking here, but the findings are worth mentioning if only to reinforce what we think we know. </p><p>Early interactions are critically important. Users form mental models quickly and then react slowly to changes in system reliability.</p><p>More critically, trust drops much faster from system failures than it builds from successes. These asymmetries suggest that we should invest disproportionately in onboarding and first-use experiences, even if they come with higher development costs.</p><h2><a href=\"https://fly.io/blog/trust-calibration-for-ai-software-builders/#measurement-is-an-opportunity-for-innovation\" aria-label=\"Anchor\"></a></h2><p>The study revealed gaping voids where effective measurement mechanisms and protocols should be, for both researchers and builders. There is a clear need to move beyond simple user satisfaction metrics or adoption rates to developing measurement frameworks that can actively detect miscalibrated trust patterns. </p><p>The ideal measurement approach would combine multiple indicators. A few examples of viable indicators are:</p><ul><li> Track acceptance rates for different confidence levels. Well-calibrated trust should show higher acceptance rates for high-confidence outputs and lower rates for low-confidence ones.\n</li><li><strong>Context-specific metrics:</strong> Measure trust calibration separately for different use cases. Users might be well-calibrated for simple tasks but poorly calibrated for complex ones.\n</li><li> Regular pulse surveys asking \"How confident are you in your ability to tell when this AI makes mistakes?‚Äù can reveal calibration gaps.\n</li></ul><h2><a href=\"https://fly.io/blog/trust-calibration-for-ai-software-builders/#the-calibrated-conclusion\" aria-label=\"Anchor\"></a></h2><p>It‚Äôs clear, at least from this study, that there‚Äôs no universal formula, or single feature that will effectively calibrate trust. It‚Äôs up to every builder to define and understand their project‚Äôs trust goals and to balance timing, content, adaptivity, and transparency accordingly. That‚Äôs what makes it both hard and worth doing. Trust calibration has to be a core part of our product‚Äôs identity, not a piglet we only start chasing once it has escaped the barn.</p><p>Magdalena Wischnewski, Nicole Kr√§mer, and Emmanuel M√ºller. 2023.

In particular, I pointed out that if you have command line tools\navailable, agentic coding tools seem very happy to use those. In the meantime,\nI learned a few more things that put some nuance to this. There are a handful\nof challenges with CLI-based tools that are rather hard to resolve and require\nfurther examination.</p><p>In this blog post, I want to present the (not so novel) idea that an\ninteresting approach is using MCP servers exposing a single tool, that accepts\nprogramming code as tool inputs.</p><p>The first and most obvious challenge with CLI tools is that they are sometimes\nplatform-dependent, version-dependent, and at times undocumented. This has\nmeant that I routinely encounter failures when using tools on first use.</p><p>A good example of this is when the tool usage requires non-ASCII string inputs.\nFor instance, Sonnet and Opus are both sometimes unsure how to feed newlines or\ncontrol characters via shell arguments.  This is unfortunate but ironically\nnot entirely unique to shell tools either.  For instance, when you program with\nC and compile it, trailing newlines are needed.  At times, agentic coding tools\nreally struggle with appending an empty line to the end of a file, and you can\nfind some quite impressive tool loops to work around this issue.</p><p>This becomes particularly frustrating when your tool is absolutely not in the\ntraining set and uses unknown syntax.  In that case, getting agents to use it\ncan become quite a frustrating experience.</p><p>Another issue is that in some agents (Claude Code in particular), there is an\nextra pass taking place for shell invocations: the security preflight.  Before\nexecuting a tool, Claude also runs it through the fast Haiku model to determine\nif the tool will do something dangerous and avoid the invocation.  This further\nslows down tool use when multiple turns are needed.</p><p>In general, doing multiple turns is very hard with CLI tools because you need\nto teach the agent how to manage sessions.  A good example of this is when you\nask it to use <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tg61cevJthc\">tmux for remote-controlling an LLDB\nsession</a>.  It‚Äôs absolutely capable\nof doing it, but it can lose track of the state of its tmux session.  During\nsome tests, I ended up with it renaming the session halfway through,\nforgetting that it had a session (and thus not killing it).</p><p>This is particularly frustrating because the failure case can be that it\nstarts from scratch or moves on to other tools just because it got a small\ndetail wrong.</p><p>Unfortunately, when moving to MCP, you immediately lose the ability to compose\nwithout inference (at least today).  One of the reasons lldb can be\nremote-controlled with tmux at all is that the agent manages to compose quite\nwell.  How does it do that?  It uses basic tmux commands such as  to send inputs or  to get the output, which don‚Äôt\nrequire a lot of extra tooling.  It then chains commands like  and  to ensure it doesn‚Äôt read output too early.  Likewise, when it\nstarts to fail with encoding more complex characters, it sometimes changes its\napproach and might even use .</p><p>The command line really isn‚Äôt just one tool ‚Äî it‚Äôs a series of tools that\ncan be composed through a programming language: bash.  The most interesting\nuses are when you ask it to write tools that it can reuse later.  It will start\ncomposing large scripts out of these one-liners.  All of that is hard with MCP\ntoday.</p><p>It‚Äôs very clear that there are limits to what these shell tools can do.  At\nsome point, you start to fight those tools.  They are in many ways only as good\nas their user interface, and some of these user interfaces are just\ninherently tricky.  For instance, when evaluated, <a href=\"https://mariozechner.at/posts/2025-08-15-mcp-vs-cli/\">tmux performs better than\nGNU screen</a>, largely\nbecause the command-line interface of tmux is better and less error-prone.  But\neither way, it requires the agent to maintain a stateful session, and it‚Äôs not\nparticularly good at this today.</p><p>What is stateful out of the box, however, is MCP.  One surprisingly useful way\nof running an MCP server is to make it an MCP server with a single tool (the\nubertool) which is just a Python interpreter that runs <a href=\"https://github.com/mitsuhiko/pexpect-mcp/blob/main/src/pexpect_mcp/server.py\"> with retained\nstate</a>.\nIt maintains state in the background and exposes tools that the agent already\nknows how to use.</p><p>I did this experiment in a few ways now, the one that is public is\n<a href=\"https://github.com/mitsuhiko/pexpect-mcp/\"></a>.  It‚Äôs an MCP that\nexposes a single tool called .  It is, however, in many ways a\nmisnomer.  It‚Äôs not really a  tool ‚Äî it‚Äôs a Python interpreter running\nout of a virtualenv that has  installed.</p><p>What is ?  It is the Python port of the ancient  command-line\ntool which allows one to interact with command-line programs through scripts.\nThe documentation describes  as a ‚Äúprogram that ‚Äòtalks‚Äô to other\ninteractive programs according to a script.‚Äù</p><p>What is special about  is that it‚Äôs old, has a stable API, and has been\nused all over the place.  You could wrap  or  with lots of\ndifferent MCP tools like , , ,\nand more.  That‚Äôs because the  class exposes 36 different API\nfunctions!  That‚Äôs a lot.  But many of these cannot be used in isolation well\nanyway.  Take this motivating example from the docs:</p><div><pre></pre></div><p>Even the most basic use here involves three chained tool calls.  And that doesn‚Äôt\ninclude error handling, which one might also want to encode.</p><p>So instead, a much more interesting way to have this entire thing run is to just\nhave the command language to the MCP be Python.  The MCP server turns into a\nstateful Python interpreter, and the tool just lets it send Python code\nthat is evaluated with the same state as before.  There is some extra support\nin the MCP server to make the experience more reliable (like timeout support),\nbut for the most part, the interface is to just send Python code.  In fact, the\nexact script from above is what an MCP client is expected to send.</p><p>The tool description just says this:</p><div><pre>Execute Python code in a pexpect session. Can spawn processes and interact with\nthem.\n\nArgs:\n  `code`: Python code to execute. Use 'child' variable to interact with the\n  spawned process. The pexpect library is already imported. Use\n  `pexpect.spawn(...)` to spawn something. timeout: Optional timeout in seconds.\n  If not provided, uses global `TIMEOUT` (default 30s).\n\nExample:\n  child = pexpect.spawn('lldb ./mytool')\n  child.expect(\"(lldb)\")\n\nReturns:\n  The result of the code execution or an error message.\n</pre></div><p>This works because the interface to the MCP is now not just individual tools it\nhas never seen ‚Äî it‚Äôs a programming language that it understands very well,\nwith additional access to an SDK () that it has also seen and learned\nall the patterns from.  We‚Äôre relegating the MCP to do the thing that it does\nreally well: session management and guiding the tool through a built-in prompt.</p><p>More importantly, the code that it writes is very similar to what it might\nput into a reusable script.  There is so little plumbing in the actual MCP\nthat you can tell the agent after the session to write a reusable pexpect\nscript from what it learned in the session.  That works because all the\ncommands it ran are just Python ‚Äî they‚Äôre still in the context, and the lift\nfrom that to a reusable Python script is low.</p><p>Now I don‚Äôt want to bore you too much with lots of Claude output, but I\ntook a crashing demo app that <a href=\"https://mariozechner.at/posts/2025-08-15-mcp-vs-cli/\">Mario\nwrote</a> and asked it to\ndebug with LLDB through .

LLDB successfully launched and set a breakpoint at main\n  2. The program stopped at the breakpoint\n  3. It identified that alice and bob Student pointers were created\n  4. The crash occurs when trying to access unallocated memory for scores\n\n  This demonstrates that the pexpect MCP tool is working correctly for debugging C\n  programs with LLDB!\n</pre></div><p>That again works because the code it writes into the MCP is very close to the\ncode that it would write into a Python script.  And the difference is\nmeaningful.  The initial debug takes about 45 seconds on my machine and uses\nabout 7 tool calls.  The re-run with the dumped playbook takes one tool call\nand finishes in less than 5 seconds.  Most importantly: that script is\nstandalone.  I can run it as a human, even without the MCP!</p><p>Now the above example works beautifully because these models just know so much\nabout .  That‚Äôs hardly surprising in a way.  So how well does this\nwork when the code that it should write is entirely unknown to it?  Well, not\nquite as well.  However, and this is the key part, because the meta input\nlanguage is Python, it means that the total surface area that can be exposed\nfrom an ubertool is pretty impressive.</p><p>A general challenge with MCP today is that the more tools you have, the more\nyou‚Äôre contributing to context rot.  You‚Äôre also limited to rather low amounts\nof input.  On the other hand, if you have an MCP that exposes a programming\nlanguage, it also indirectly exposes a lot of functionality that it knows\nfrom its training.</p><p>For instance, one of the really neat parts about this is that it knows ,\n, , and other stuff.  Heck, it even knows about\n.  This means that you can give it very rudimentary\ninstructions about how its sandbox operates and what it might want to do to\nlearn more about what is available to it as needed.  You can also tell it in\nthe prompt that there is a function it can run to learn more about what‚Äôs\navailable when it needs help!</p><p>So when you build something that is completely novel, at least the programming\nlanguage is known. You can, for instance, write a tiny MCP that dumps out the\ninternal state of your application, provides basic query helpers for your\ndatabase that support your sharding setup, or provides data reading APIs.  It\nwill discover all of this anyway from reading the code, but now it can also\nuse a stateful Python or JavaScript session to run these tools and explore more.</p><p>This is also a fun feature when you want to ask the agent to debug the MCP\nitself.  Because Python and JavaScript are so powerful, you can, for instance,\nalso ask it to debug the MCP‚Äôs state itself when something went wrong.</p><p>The elephant in the room for all things agentic coding is security.  Claude\nmostly doesn‚Äôt delete your machine and maybe part of that is the Haiku preflight\nsecurity check.  But isn‚Äôt all of this a sham anyway?  I generally love to\nwatch how Claude and other agents maneuver their way around protections in\npretty creative ways.  Clearly it‚Äôs potent and prompt-injectable.  By building\nan MCP that just runs , we might be getting rid of some of the remaining\nsafety here.</p><p>But does it matter?  We are seemingly okay with it writing code and running\ntests, which is the same kind of bad as running .  I‚Äôm sure the day of\nreckoning will come for all of us, but right now we‚Äôre living in this world\nwhere protections don‚Äôt matter and we can explore what these things can do.</p><p>I‚Äôm honestly not sure how to best protect these things.  They are pretty\nspecial in that they are just inherently unsafe and impossible to secure.\nMaybe the way to really protect them would be to intercept every system call\nand have some sort of policy framework/sandbox around the whole thing.\nBut even in that case, what prevents an ever more clever LLM from circumventing\nall these things?  It has internet access, it can be prompt-injected, and\nall interfaces we have for them are just too low-level to support protection\nwell.</p><p>So to some degree, I think the tail risks of code execution are here to stay.\nBut I would argue that they are not dramatically worse when the MCP executes\nPython code.  In this particular case, consider that  itself runs\nprograms.  There is little point in securing the MCP if what the MCP can run\nis any bash command.</p><p>As interesting as the  case is, that was not my original motivation.\nWhat I started to look into is replacing <a href=\"https://github.com/microsoft/playwright-mcp\">Playwright‚Äôs\nMCP</a> with an MCP that just exposes\nthe Playwright API via JavaScript.  This is an experiment I have been running\nfor a while, and the results are somewhat promising but also not promising\nenough yet.  If you want to play with it, the MCP is called\n‚Äú<a href=\"https://github.com/mitsuhiko/playwrightess-mcp\">playwrightess</a>‚Äù is pretty\nsimple.  It just lets it execute JavaScript code against a sync playwright\nclient.  Same idea.

For instance  from both the\nbrowser as well as the playwright script are forwarded back to the agent\nautomatically.

Tracing was the first signal the project tackled, and its now generally available in most major programming languages.</p><p>Personally, Im a big fan of tracing. I think its a much cleaner and more effective way to pass data to your observability provider. they can take that data and turn it into something truly useful, whether thats a Gantt style view of spans or metrics that drive alerts.</p><p>One of the most powerful features is distributed tracing. the ability to connect spans across different services into a single trace. When one service makes an RPC call to another, the trace context can follow along, giving you a complete, end-to-end view of requests across your entire platform.</p><p>In the screenshot above for example,the trace has spans from 3 different services: , , and .</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  What is trace propagation?\n</h2><p>To connect traces across different services, you need to pass some context along with each request. This process is known as trace propagation, and its what we will be diving into in this article.</p><p>Unless you are working with a legacy system that already uses a different tracing format, you should stick with the <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/TR/trace-context/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">W3C Trace Context Recommendation</a>. Its the recommended standard for propagating trace context over HTTP. While its designed with HTTP in mind, many of its concepts can also be applied to other communication channels, like Kafka messages, for example.</p><p>Trace Context specifies two HTTP headers that will be used to pass context around, traceparent and tracestate.</p><p>The traceparent HTTP header includes the root of context propagation. It consists in a comma-separated suite of fields that include:</p><ul><li><p>The version of Trace Context being used. Only one version, 00 exists in 2023\nThen, for version 00:</p></li><li><p>The current Trace ID, as a 16-byte array representing the ID of the entire trace.</p></li><li><p>The current Span ID (called parent-id in the spec), an 8-byte array representing the ID of the parent request.</p></li><li><p>Flags, an 8-byte hex-encoded field which controls tracing flags such as sampling.</p></li></ul><p>The tracestate HTTP header is meant to include proprietary data used to pass specific information across traces.</p><p>Its value is a comma-separated list of key/values, where each pair is separated by an equal sign. Obviously, the trace state shouldn‚Äôt include any sensitive data.</p><p>For example, with requests coming from public API endpoints which can be called either by internal services, or by external customers, both could be passing a traceparent header. However, external ones would generate orphan spans, as the parent one is stored within the customers service, not ours.</p><p>So we add a tracestate value indicating the request comes from an internal service, and we only propagate context if that value is present.</p><p>With both these fields being passed, any tracing library should have enough information to provide distributed tracing.</p><p>A request could pass the following headers:</p><p><code>traceparent: 00-d4cda95b652f4a1592b449d5929fda1b-6e0c63257de34c92-01\ntracestate: myservice=true</code></p><p>The traceparent header indicates a trace ID (d4cda95b652f4a1592b449d5929fda1b), a span ID (6e0c63257de34c92), and sets a flag indicating the parent span was sampled (so its likely we want to sample this one too).</p><p>The tracestate header provides a specific key/value that we can use to make appropriate decisions, such as whether we want to keep the context or not.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  How OpenTelemetry implements propagation\n</h2><p>The OpenTelemetry <a href=\"https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/blob/main/specification/context/api-propagators.md\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">specification </a>defines a Propagators interface to allow any implementation to establish its own propagation convention, such as W3C TraceContext.</p><p>A propagator must implement two methods:</p><ol><li> ‚Äì to insert the current span context into a carrier object (such as an HTTP headers map).</li><li>‚Äì to retrieve the span context from a carrier object.</li></ol><p><a href=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2F9g3m1hvyefnx8zr1txki.png\"><img src=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2F9g3m1hvyefnx8zr1txki.png\" alt=\" \" width=\"800\" height=\"199\"></a>\nEach instrumentation library making or receiving external calls then has the responsibility to call inject/extract to write/read the span context and have it passed around.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Extract and Inject examples\n</h2><p>For example, the following is <a href=\"https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-ruby-contrib/blob/6e89c92f189bc6e187da06ea2af4e38531b93601/instrumentation/rack/lib/opentelemetry/instrumentation/rack/middlewares/tracer_middleware.rb#L69-L72\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Rack extracting</a> the context from the propagator to generate a new span in Ruby:</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  The full propagation flow\n</h2><p>To put in other words, the diagram above shows what each service is expected to perform to enable propagation. The library emitting an HTTP call is expected to call inject, which will add the proper HTTP headers to the request. The library receiving HTTP requests is expected to call extract to retrieve the proper span context from the request‚Äôs HTTP headers.</p><p>Note that each language implementation of OpenTelemetry provides multiple contrib packages that allow easy instrumentation of common frameworks and libraries. Those packages will handle propagation for you. Unless you write your own framework or HTTP library, you should not need to call inject or extract yourself. All you need to do is configure the global propagation mechanism (see below).</p><p>Not all services communicate through HTTP. For example, you could have one service emitting a Kafka message, and another one reading it.</p><p>The OpenTelemetry propagation API is purposefully generic, as all it does is read a hash and return a span context, or read a span context and inject data into a hash.

Whether you are building a machine learning model, experimenting with Natural Language Processing, or designing a computer vision pipeline, Streamlit provides an incredibly simple yet powerful way to test, validate, and showcase your ideas in real time.<br>\nUnlike traditional web development frameworks, Streamlit focuses on speed and interactivity. With just a few lines of Python code, developers can create an interactive dashboard to visualize datasets, experiment with models, and test outputs. This is especially beneficial for startups and innovators who want to demonstrate a concept quickly. For instance, at <a href=\"//aiorbitlabs.com\">AI Orbit Labs</a>, Streamlit is actively used in building prototypes for AI-powered systems that need rapid experimentation before full-scale deployment.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Why Streamlit for Prototyping?</strong><br>\nEase of Use‚Ää-‚ÄäStreamlit requires no frontend knowledge. Data scientists and AI developers can work directly in Python.<br>\nReal-Time Testing‚Ää-‚ÄäYou can instantly check how your model responds to different inputs, which is critical for debugging and refining models.<br>\nRapid Iteration‚Ää-‚ÄäChanging a model parameter and seeing results instantly speeds up the experimentation cycle.<br>\nBeautiful UI by Default‚Ää-‚ÄäWithout writing CSS or HTML, Streamlit offers clean, professional dashboards.</p>\n\n<p>For example, imagine you are working on a text classification model. With Streamlit, you can quickly set up a text input box, pass the user's query into your trained model, and display the prediction in real time. This level of interactivity boosts productivity and makes your project presentation-ready within hours. Projects like those at <a href=\"//aiorbitlabs.com\">AI Orbit Labs</a> leverage this speed to validate AI solutions with clients before scaling further.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Checking Model's Response Effectively</strong><br>\nWhen building AI systems, testing the response quality of a model is as important as building the model itself. Streamlit makes this seamless:<br>\nFor NLP models, you can create text boxes where users type queries and instantly receive outputs.<br>\nFor Computer Vision models, you can upload images and visualize bounding boxes or predictions.<br>\nFor financial or forecasting models, Streamlit can generate charts and plots dynamically to check prediction accuracy.</p>\n\n<p>The ability to prototype end-to-end workflows quickly ensures that developers don't waste time on infrastructure, allowing them to focus purely on improving the model's accuracy. This approach aligns well with the philosophy of AI Orbit Labs, where client-specific AI prototypes are tested interactively before full deployment.<br>\nStreamlit in Collaborative AI¬†Projects<br>\nAnother key advantage is Streamlit's collaborative nature. Teams can deploy a Streamlit app on the cloud and allow stakeholders to interact with it. This makes model validation transparent and user-friendly. Businesses can test whether an AI system meets their needs before investing further. Many prototypes at <a href=\"//aiorbitlabs.com\">AI Orbit Labs</a> have been shared with clients in this way, reducing feedback loops and accelerating deployment.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Conclusion</strong><br>\nStreamlit bridges the gap between idea and implementation. It is lightweight, fast, and powerful for creating prototypes that demonstrate model performance in real-time. Instead of spending weeks on UI development, developers can focus on improving model performance and delivering value.</p>\n\n<p>If you are an AI enthusiast, data scientist, or entrepreneur looking to test and validate your ideas quickly, Streamlit should be at the top of your toolkit.

You and I both know the future is so much richer and wilder. Today, let's talk about something that's starting to change how we work: multi-agent AI systems. Not just one \"co-pilot,\" but coordinated teams of AI agents working alongside us‚Äîsometimes autonomously, sometimes in sync with our intentions‚Äîto streamline, automate, and even reimagine day-to-day engineering.</p>\n\n<p>Curious about what that really means? Let's dive deep.</p>\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  1. From Chatbot Assistants to Autonomous AI Agents\n</h2>\n\n<p>Most of us started seeing AI as helpful when OpenAI's ChatGPT, Copilot, and other chat-based assistants entered our workflow. They're cool‚Äîbut they're still fundamentally \"helpers,\" not independent workers.</p>\n\n<p>But what if we could deploy fleets of AI agents, each specializing in a particular domain (like code review, DevOps, or testing), working together and negotiating with each other to get entire workflows done? Now we're talking about \"multi-agent systems.\" These are AI agents that can make decisions, trigger actions, coordinate projects, and, most importantly, collaborate or compete with each other.</p>\n\n<p>Sounds sci-fi? Not anymore.</p>\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  2. Meet Your Dev Team of AI Agents\n</h2>\n\n<p>Picture this:<br>\nYou have a cloud-native app, and you want to automate your whole DevOps pipeline‚Äîfrom CI/CD to testing to incident response. Here's how a multi-agent system could break down the tasks:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Agent A</strong>: Monitors Github for new pull requests and checks styles.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Agent B</strong>: Runs automated tests and evaluates code coverage.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Agent C</strong>: Handles build/deployment to staging and production.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Agent D</strong>: Monitors production health, auto-creates tickets when issues are detected.</p>\n\n<p>Now, throw in some negotiation (Agent B needs Agent A to pass first!) and conversation: these agents can message each other's endpoints, share artifacts, and \"decide\" who leads on which job.</p>\n\n<p>This isn't theoretical. Leading open-source frameworks like LangChain Agents, Microsoft Semantic Kernel, and AutoGen are making such orchestrations practical for all of us.</p>\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  3. Tech Stack: Building Blocks of Multi-Agent AI\n</h2>\n\n<p>Let me show you what's actually involved‚Äîno magic, just powerful tools:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Large Language Model (LLM) Coordinator</strong>: The \"brain\" that interprets instructions and delegates to capable agents.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Specialized Tool-Use Agents</strong>: Each can be tailored for DevOps, data scraping, testing, you name it.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Memory/Trace Log</strong>: Persistent context and traceability so agents \"remember\" what happened.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Communication Protocols</strong>: JSON, REST, gRPC‚Äîor good old HTTP.</p>\n\n<p>Want to see a working example? Let's build a simple multi-agent collaboration using AutoGen:</p>\n<h3>\n  \n  \n  3.1. Sample Code: Python Multi-Agent System with AutoGen\n</h3>\n\n<p>Suppose we want two agents‚Äî\"Coder\" and \"Reviewer\"‚Äîto collaborate and review a simple function.<br>\n</p>\n\n<div

<strong>Coder</strong> writes code.</li>\n<li>The <strong>Reviewer</strong> checks it for bugs or improvements.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>UserProxy</strong> can step in, run the code, and manage the workflow.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>You can expand this by plugging in more agents, adding task dependencies, or pinging external APIs. And yes‚Äîthis pattern scales to entire engineering workflows!</p>\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  4. How Multi-Agent Systems Are Automating Real Workflows\n</h2>\n\n<p>Let's see some practical scenarios where agent squads shine:</p>\n\n<h3>\n  \n  \n  Automated Ticket Triage (Real-World Example)\n</h3>\n\n<p>Imagine:<br>\nYour engineering backlog is overflowing with GitHub issues and Jira tickets. You spin up a trio of agents:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Classifier Agent</strong>: Reads new issues, tags them (bug, feature, doc).</p>\n\n<p><strong>Skill-Matcher Agent</strong>: Cross-references issue context with your team's expertise.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Scheduler Agent</strong>: Assigns the ticket and alerts the team Slack.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Result</strong>:<br>\nTickets get triaged and assigned minutes after they're created. Your devs focus on building, not managing.</p>\n\n<p>You could wire this up using something like LangChain's Agent Executor and connect with Slack, GitHub, and Jira APIs.</p>\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  5. Emergent Behaviors: Surprises in Agent Teams\n</h2>\n\n<p>Here's where it gets really interesting‚Äîwhen you let agents operate with minimal intervention, their interactions can create emergent behaviors:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Unexpected collaboration</strong>: Agents \"invent\" new coordination strategies you didn't hard-code.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Failure recovery</strong>: Agents self-diagnose and retry failed deployments‚Äîeven pinging humans when truly stumped.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Occasional chaos</strong>: Miscommunications or loops (\"Agent A blames Agent B, B blames A!\") can force you to improve agent prompts and boundary conditions.</p>\n\n<p>This feels like managing a living system more than a set of static scripts. There's new room for creativity‚Ä¶ and for debugging!</p>\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  6. Human-in-the-Loop or Fully Autonomous?\n</h2>\n\n<p>Here's a choice every engineering leader must make:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Supervised agents</strong>: Humans always approve/reject agent actions. Safe, trusted, but slower.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Semi-autonomous agents</strong>: Agents complete easy tasks and only ask for help on edge cases.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Fully autonomous</strong>: Agents have wide permissions; humans monitor via dashboards and logs.</p>\n\n<p>Most modern projects start with supervised or semi-autonomous, then push autonomy over time as trust and capability build.</p>\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  7. Technical Deep Dive: Building a Scalable Agent Schema\n</h2>\n\n<p>You don't always need heavyweight orchestrators‚Äîsometimes a YAML or JSON config file and some HTTP endpoints are enough to create a modular system!</p>\n\n<h3>\n  \n  \n  Example: YAML Agent Config (Simplified)\n</h3>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"highlight js-code-highlight\">\n<pre class=\"highlight yaml\"><code><span class=\"na\">agents</span><span class=\"pi\">:</span>\n  <span class=\"pi\">-</span> <span class=\"na\">name</span><span class=\"pi\">:</span> <span class=\"s2\">\"</span><span class=\"s\">DevOpsAgent\"</span>\n    <span class=\"na\">capabilities</span><span class=\"pi\">:</span>\n      <span class=\"pi\">-</span> <span class=\"s2\">\"</span><span class=\"s\">build\"</span>\n      <span class=\"pi\">-</span> <span class=\"s2\">\"</span><span class=\"s\">deploy\"</span>\n    <span class=\"na\">endpoint</span><span class=\"pi\">:</span> <span class=\"s2\">\"</span><span class=\"s\">https://devops.internal/api\"</span>\n  <span class=\"pi\">-</span> <span class=\"na\">name</span><span class=\"pi\">:</span> <span class=\"s2\">\"</span><span class=\"s\">TestAgent\"</span>\n    <span class=\"na\">capabilities</span><span class=\"pi\">:</span>\n      <span class=\"pi\">-</span> <span class=\"s2\">\"</span><span class=\"s\">run_tests\"</span>\n      <span class=\"pi\">-</span> <span class=\"s2\">\"</span><span class=\"s\">report_coverage\"</span>\n    <span class=\"na\">endpoint</span><span class=\"pi\">:</span> <span class=\"s2\">\"</span><span class=\"s\">https://ci.internal/api\"</span>\n  <span class=\"pi\">-</span> <span class=\"na\">name</span><span class=\"pi\">:</span> <span class=\"s2\">\"</span><span class=\"s\">DocAgent\"</span>\n    <span class=\"na\">capabilities</span><span class=\"pi\">:</span>\n      <span class=\"pi\">-</span> <span class=\"s2\">\"</span><span class=\"s\">generate_docs\"</span>\n      <span class=\"pi\">-</span> <span class=\"s2\">\"</span><span class=\"s\">tag_codebase\"</span>\n    <span class=\"na\">endpoint</span><span class=\"pi\">:</span> <span class=\"s2\">\"</span><span class=\"s\">https://docs.internal/api\"</span>\n<span class=\"na\">workflow</span><span class=\"pi\">:</span>\n  <span class=\"pi\">-</span> <span class=\"na\">step</span><span class=\"pi\">:</span> <span class=\"s2\">\"</span><span class=\"s\">build\"</span>\n    <span class=\"na\">agent</span><span class=\"pi\">:</span> <span class=\"s2\">\"</span><span class=\"s\">DevOpsAgent\"</span>\n    <span class=\"na\">next</span><span class=\"pi\">:</span> <span class=\"s2\">\"</span><span class=\"s\">run_tests\"</span>\n  <span class=\"pi\">-</span> <span class=\"na\">step</span><span class=\"pi\">:</span> <span class=\"s2\">\"</span><span class=\"s\">run_tests\"</span>\n    <span class=\"na\">agent</span><span class=\"pi\">:</span> <span class=\"s2\">\"</span><span class=\"s\">TestAgent\"</span>\n    <span class=\"na\">next</span><span class=\"pi\">:</span> <span class=\"s2\">\"</span><span class=\"s\">generate_docs\"</span>\n  <span class=\"pi\">-</span> <span class=\"na\">step</span><span class=\"pi\">:</span> <span class=\"s2\">\"</span><span class=\"s\">generate_docs\"</span>\n    <span class=\"na\">agent</span><span class=\"pi\">:</span> <span class=\"s2\">\"</span><span class=\"s\">DocAgent\"</span>\n    <span class=\"na\">next</span><span class=\"pi\">:</span> <span class=\"s2\">\"</span><span class=\"s\">deploy\"</span>\n  <span class=\"pi\">-</span> <span class=\"na\">step</span><span class=\"pi\">:</span> <span class=\"s2\">\"</span><span class=\"s\">deploy\"</span>\n    <span class=\"na\">agent</span><span class=\"pi\">:</span> <span class=\"s2\">\"</span><span class=\"s\">DevOpsAgent\"</span>\n    <span class=\"na\">end</span><span class=\"pi\">:</span> <span class=\"kc\">true</span>\n</code></pre>\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>With such a config, your orchestration logic just reads the config and forwards tasks as HTTP requests between agents.</p>\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  8. Challenges &amp; Open Problems\n</h2>\n\n<p>Let's not sugarcoat: going \"multi-agent\" comes with brand-new challenges.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Security risks</strong>: Can agents be tricked? Hijacked? Proper RBAC and API isolation are essential.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Observability</strong>: How do you debug a hive of agents? You'll want comprehensive logs and tracing.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Coordination complexity</strong>: How do you prevent loops or deadlocks? Add clear protocols, heartbeats, and failure modes.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Ethical guardrails</strong>: If agents start making decisions that affect users (deploying, changing prices, etc.), you need clear ethical boundaries.</p>\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  9. The Future: Self-Improving Agent Teams\n</h2>\n\n<p>Imagine agents that, after each sprint, analyze what went wrong and improve their own code and decision logic. Or agents that propose new plugins to boost productivity.</p>\n\n<p>That's not fantasy‚Äîearly research labs are already exploring reinforcement learning and LLM-based \"self-updating\" agents. The era of the self-improving engineering team is just over the horizon.</p>\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  10. Conclusion\n</h2>\n\n<p>As you can see, the leap from single, prompt-based AI helpers to coordinated teams of specialized AI agents is set to revolutionize how we build, ship, and maintain software. You don't need to be at Google or Microsoft to start‚Äîmany of these tools are open source and ready for your own wild workflow experiments.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Ready to architect your own multi-agent AI system?</strong><br>\nLet me know what you dream up‚ÄîI'd love to hear from fellow builders who believe, like me, that the real magic happens when agents work together.</p>\n\n","contentLength":0,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"DeepMind Just Made The Most Powerful Game AI Engine!","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvuEKrJhjos","date":1755454142,"author":"Two Minute Papers","guid":230672,"unread":true,"content":"<article>‚ù§Ô∏è Check out Lambda here and sign up for their GPU Cloud: https://lambda.ai/papers\n\nGuide:\nRent one of their GPU's with over 16GB of VRAM\nOpen a terminal\nJust get Ollama with this command - https://ollama.com/download/linux\nThen run ollama run gpt-oss:120b - https://ollama.com/library/gpt-oss:120b\n\nGenie 3:\nhttps://deepmind.google/discover/blog/genie-3-a-new-frontier-for-world-models/\n\nSources:\nhttps://x.com/amoufarek/status/1955776162447102238\nhttps://x.com/amoufarek/status/1955299375548076382\nhttps://x.com/holynski_/status/1953882726656094622\nhttps://x.com/holynski_/status/1953879983535141043\nhttps://x.com/RuiHuang_art/status/1954716703340048877\nhttps://x.com/mattmcgill_/status/1953827141700772186\n\nüìù My paper on simulations that look almost like reality is available for free here:\nhttps://rdcu.be/cWPfD \n\nOr this is the orig.

That feeling of \"I <em>really</em> want to get into this, but where do I even begin?\"</p>\n\n<p>Well, I've been there, and I just crossed a major milestone: building my first machine learning model! And let me tell you, watching it \"learn\" to read handwritten digits was nothing short of magical. If you're looking for the perfect entry point into ML, strap in, because I'm about to share my journey with the legendary MNIST dataset.</p>\n\n\n\n\n<h3>\n  \n  \n  What's This \"MNIST\" Everyone's Talking About?\n</h3>\n\n<p>Imagine a vast collection of tiny, grayscale images, each showing a single handwritten digit from 0 to 9. That's MNIST!</p>\n\n<p>It's the \"Hello World\" of image classification datasets, and for good reason:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>  <strong>Size:</strong> 60,000 training images, 10,000 test images. Just enough to be meaningful, not overwhelming.</li>\n<li>  <strong>Simplicity:</strong> All images are a neat 28x28 pixels.</li>\n<li>  <strong>Cleanliness:</strong> Hardly any messy data to wrestle with, so you can focus on the ML concepts.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>It's small, clean, and absolutely perfect for beginners who want to see quick results.</p>\n\n\n\n\n<h3>\n  \n  \n  My Humble Goal: Pixel to Prediction\n</h3>\n\n<p>My objective was clear:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li> Feed the model an image of a handwritten digit.</li>\n<li> Have the model <em>figure out</em> what features define each digit (e.g., a loop for '0', a vertical line for '1').</li>\n<li> Get it to confidently tell me the correct number.</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n\n<h3>\n  \n  \n  Building My First Neural Network: A Simple Keras Setup\n</h3>\n\n<p>I wanted to keep things approachable, so I opted for <strong>TensorFlow with Keras</strong>. Keras is a high-level API that makes building neural networks feel almost like stacking Lego blocks.</p>\n\n<p>My model was deliberately simple, but incredibly effective:<br>\n</p>\n\n<div class=\"highlight js-code-highlight\">\n<pre class=\"highlight python\"><code><span class=\"kn\">from</span> <span class=\"n\">tensorflow</span> <span class=\"kn\">import</span> <span class=\"n\">keras</span>\n<span class=\"kn\">from</span> <span class=\"n\">tensorflow.keras</span> <span class=\"kn\">import</span> <span class=\"n\">layers</span>\n\n<span class=\"n\">model</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"n\">keras</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nc\">Sequential</span><span class=\"p\">([</span>\n    <span class=\"c1\"># Step 1: Flatten the 28x28 image into a 784-length vector\n</span>    <span class=\"n\">layers</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nc\">Flatten</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">input_shape</span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"mi\">28</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"mi\">28</span><span class=\"p\">)),</span>\n\n    <span class=\"c1\"># Step 2: A 'Dense' (fully connected) hidden layer with ReLU activation\n</span>    <span class=\"c1\"># ReLU helps the model learn complex, non-linear relationships\n</span>    <span class=\"n\">layers</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nc\">Dense</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"mi\">128</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"n\">activation</span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"sh\">'</span><span class=\"s\">relu</span><span class=\"sh\">'</span><span class=\"p\">),</span> <span class=\"c1\"># You can experiment with this number!\n</span>\n    <span class=\"c1\"># Step 3: The output layer - 10 neurons for 0-9, with Softmax for probabilities\n</span>    <span class=\"n\">layers</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nc\">Dense</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"mi\">10</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"n\">activation</span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"sh\">'</span><span class=\"s\">softmax</span><span class=\"sh\">'</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n<span class=\"p\">])</span>\n\n<span class=\"n\">model</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nf\">summary</span><span class=\"p\">()</span>\n</code></pre>\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Quick breakdown of those layers:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>  <strong><code>Flatten</code></strong>: Our 2D (28x28) image needs to be \"unrolled\" into a single, long list of numbers (784 pixels) for the next layer. Think of it like taking a grid of numbers and laying them out in a single line.</li>\n<li>  <strong><code>Dense</code> (with <code>ReLU</code>)</strong>: This is a \"hidden\" layer. Every input pixel connects to every neuron in this layer. The <code>ReLU</code> (Rectified Linear Unit) activation function introduces non-linearity, which is crucial for the network to learn anything interesting.</li>\n<li>  <strong><code>Dense</code> (Output with <code>Softmax</code>)</strong>: This is the final decision-making layer. It has 10 neurons, one for each digit. <code>Softmax</code> takes the raw outputs and turns them into probabilities that sum up to 1. The highest probability tells us the model's prediction!</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n\n<h3>\n  \n  \n  Feeding the Brain: Training My Model\n</h3>\n\n<p>With the architecture set, it was time for the actual \"learning\":</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>  <strong>Dataset:</strong> MNIST (pre-loaded in Keras, making life easy!)</li>\n<li>  <strong>Epochs:</strong> 5</li>\n<li>  <strong>Batch Size:</strong> 32</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>These terms can be a bit opaque at first, right? Here's my beginner-friendly take:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>  <strong>Epochs</strong>: How many times our model \"sees\" the <em>entire</em> training dataset. Each epoch is a full pass. So, 5 epochs means it went through all 60,000 images five times.</li>\n<li>  <strong>Batch Size</strong>: Instead of showing the model one image at a time, or all 60,000 at once (which would kill your memory!), we feed it images in small groups. My model processed 32 images at a time, updated its internal \"knowledge\" (weights) based on those 32, then moved to the next batch. This balances speed and stability.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n\n<h3>\n  \n  \n  The \"Aha!\" Moment: My Results!\n</h3>\n\n<p>After just those 5 epochs, I ran the model on the unseen test set (those 10,000 images it had never encountered). The accuracy shot up to an astounding <strong>97-98%</strong>!</p>\n\n<p>Honestly, watching the accuracy climb with each epoch during training was incredibly satisfying. It genuinely felt like my code was coming alive and \"understanding\" those squiggly numbers. That's the magic, right there! ‚ú®</p>\n\n\n\n\n<h3>\n  \n  \n  My Top Takeaways for Aspiring ML Enthusiasts\n</h3>\n\n<p>If you're just starting, here's what I learned that might save you some headaches:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li> <strong>Start with the \"Hello Worlds\":</strong> Don't jump straight into massive, complex datasets. Small, clean datasets like MNIST let you grasp core concepts without drowning in data preprocessing.</li>\n<li> <strong>Don't Obsess Over Hyperparameters (Yet):</strong> It's tempting to tweak everything, but for your first few projects, common defaults or small numbers for epochs/batch size are usually fine. Get it working, then optimize!</li>\n<li> <strong>Embrace the Learning Curve (and the Wins!):</strong> ML can feel daunting, but celebrate every small victory. Watching that accuracy metric improve? Pure dopamine!</li>\n<li> <strong>A Little Code Goes a Long Way:</strong> Even understanding the basic structure of a model in Keras or PyTorch is a huge step. You don't need to write a million lines of code to get started.</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n\n<h3>\n  \n  \n  What's Next on My ML Adventure?\n</h3>\n\n<p>This project has officially hooked me! My next steps include:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>  <strong>Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs):</strong> These are the true kings of image recognition. I'm excited to see how much more accurate I can get with a CNN on MNIST, and then move to more complex image tasks.</li>\n<li>  <strong>Data Augmentation:</strong> Making my model more robust by artificially creating more training data (e.g., rotating, zooming, or shifting existing images).</li>\n<li>  <strong>Harder Datasets:</strong> Time to tackle something like CIFAR-10 (which has 10 classes of real-world objects like cars, planes, and animals) to push my skills further.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong>üëâ My biggest piece of advice:</strong> If you're curious about ML, dive into MNIST. It's accessible, fun, and incredibly rewarding. You'll go from pixel-perfect confusion to a confident predictor in no time!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Have you done the MNIST project?

If we aligned them perfectly, then even though you were only editing plain text, it would look and feel like you were editing rich text!</p><p>Of course, there would be downsides: you'd have to use a monospace font, all content would have to have the same font size, and all the markdown markup would have to be displayed in the final preview.</p><p>But those were tradeoffs I could live with.</p><p>Anyways, version 1 didn't go so well... it turns out it's harder to keep a textarea and a rendered preview in alignment than I thought. Here's what I discovered:</p><p>- Lists were hard to align - bullet points threw off character alignment. Solved with HTML entities (‚Ä¢ for bullets) that maintain monospace width</p><p>- Not all monospace fonts are truly monospace - bold and italic text can have different widths even in \"monospace\" fonts, breaking the perfect overlay</p><p>- Embedding was a nightmare - any inherited CSS from parent pages (margin, padding, line-height) would shift alignment. Even a 1px shift completely broke the illusion</p><p>The solution was obsessive normalization:</p><pre><code>    // The entire trick: a transparent textarea over a preview div\n    layerElements(textarea, preview)\n    applyIdenticalSpacing(textarea, preview)\n\n    // Make textarea invisible but keep the cursor\n    textarea.style.background = 'transparent'\n    textarea.style.color = 'transparent'\n    textarea.style.caretColor = 'black'\n\n    // Keep them in sync\n    textarea.addEventListener('input', () =&gt; {\n      preview.innerHTML = parseMarkdown(textarea.value)\n      syncScroll(textarea, preview)\n    })\n</code></pre>\nA week ago I started playing with version 2 and discovered GitHub's &lt;markdown-toolbar&gt; element, which handles markdown formatting in a plain &lt;textarea&gt; really well.<p>That experiment turned into OverType (<a href=\"https://overtype.dev\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://overtype.dev</a>), which I'm showing to you today -- it's a rich markdown editor that's really just a &lt;textarea&gt;. The key insight was that once you solve the alignment challenges, you get everything native textareas provide for free: undo/redo, mobile keyboard, accessibility, and native performance.</p><p>So far it works surprisingly well across browsers and mobile. I get performant rich text editing in one small package (45KB total). It's kind of a dumb idea, but it works! I'm planning to use it in all my projects and I'd like to keep it simple and minimal.</p><p>I would love it if you would kick the tires and let me know what you think of it.

A token can be as small as a character or as large as a word or sentence, depending on the model. These tokens differ from LLM to LLM.</p>\n\n<p>A computer will only understand numbers.

Yet, for all their prowess, LLMs inherently produce free-form, unstructured text. While fantastic for conversational AI, this unstructured nature becomes a significant bottleneck when you need to integrate LLM outputs into databases, trigger automated workflows, or perform precise data analysis. This is where the power of <em>structured output</em>, particularly when harnessed with the Python <code>pydantic</code> library, emerges as the unsung hero, transforming raw LLM text into actionable, machine-readable data.</p>\n\n<p>This guide will illuminate why structured output is not just a nice-to-have but a fundamental necessity for robust LLM applications. We'll explore the challenges of unstructured data, how Pydantic provides an elegant solution, and dive into leading libraries like <code>Instructor</code> that make this process seamless. By the end, you'll understand how to unlock the full potential of your LLMs, making them more reliable, efficient, and integrated into your systems.</p>\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  Taming the Textual Wild West: The Pitfalls of Unstructured LLM Responses\n</h2>\n\n<p>Imagine asking an LLM to extract a customer's name, email, and order ID from a support ticket. Without guidance, it might return something like: \"The customer's name is John Doe, his email is <a href=\"mailto:john.doe@example.com\">john.doe@example.com</a>, and the order number is #12345.\" While readable, extracting these specific pieces of information programmatically is surprisingly complex and prone to errors.</p>\n\n<p>The challenges of dealing with unstructured LLM output are manifold:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>  <strong>Parsing Complexity:</strong> Extracting specific information from free-form text requires complex, often brittle, parsing logic. Regular expressions or custom parsers can easily break with slight variations in the LLM's output format, leading to unexpected failures.</li>\n<li>  <strong>Validation Issues:</strong> Without predefined schemas, it's difficult to ensure the accuracy, completeness, or even the correct data type of the output. Is \"30\" an age or a quantity? Is \"true\" a boolean or a string? This ambiguity can lead to incorrect data processing.</li>\n<li>  <strong>Error Handling:</strong> Malformed or unexpected outputs can lead to application failures, requiring extensive manual post-processing and error handling, which consumes valuable development time.</li>\n<li>  <strong>Scalability:</strong> Manually cleaning, validating, and parsing unstructured data is not scalable for large volumes of LLM interactions, hindering the deployment of AI in production environments where consistency is key.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>These issues highlight a critical gap: LLMs are powerful generators, but their outputs often lack the precision and predictability required for integration into structured systems.</p>\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  Pydantic: Your Blueprint for Reliable LLM Data\n</h2>\n\n<p>Enter <code>pydantic</code>, a Python library for data validation and settings management. Pydantic is a game-changer for structured LLM output because it allows developers to define clear, explicit data schemas using standard Python type hints. This approach brings the rigor of static typing to dynamic data.</p>\n\n<p>Here's how Pydantic solves the challenges of unstructured output:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>  <strong>Enforce Data Types:</strong> By defining Pydantic models, you ensure that LLM outputs conform to expected types (e.g., <code>str</code>, <code>int</code>, <code>float</code>, <code>bool</code>, <code>list</code>, <code>dict</code>). If the LLM tries to return a string where an integer is expected, Pydantic will flag it, preventing type-related errors.</li>\n<li>  <strong>Validate Data:</strong> Pydantic allows you to apply custom validation rules, ensuring data quality and integrity beyond just types. For instance, you can ensure an email address is in a valid format, that a number is within a specific range, or that a string matches a particular pattern.</li>\n<li>  <strong>Generate Schemas:</strong> Pydantic models can automatically generate JSON schemas. These schemas are crucial for guiding LLMs, as many modern LLM APIs can be prompted to generate output that adheres to a specific JSON schema, making Pydantic an ideal partner for precise output control.</li>\n<li>  <strong>Serialize/Deserialize Data:</strong> Pydantic makes it effortless to convert LLM outputs to and from structured formats like JSON, facilitating seamless data integration into databases, APIs, or other software systems. This simplifies data exchange across your application stack.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>By leveraging Pydantic, you transform the LLM's creative freedom into structured, predictable, and validated data, ready for downstream processing and integration.</p>\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  Instructor: The Go-To Library for Seamless Structured LLM Outputs\n</h2>\n\n<p>While Pydantic provides the schema definition, libraries like <code>Instructor</code> bridge the gap between your Pydantic models and the LLM's output generation. <code>Instructor</code> is rapidly becoming the <em>most popular Python library</em> for extracting structured data from LLMs, boasting <strong>over 3 million monthly downloads, 11k stars, and 100+ contributors</strong>. This widespread adoption underscores its effectiveness and the community's trust.</p>\n\n<p><code>Instructor</code> extends the functionality of popular LLM client libraries (like OpenAI, Anthropic, Google) to provide a seamless experience for structured output. Its key features include:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>  <strong>Structured Outputs:</strong> Define Pydantic models to specify exactly what data you want from your LLM, ensuring the output matches your application's needs.</li>\n<li>  <strong>Automatic Retries:</strong> Built-in retry logic when validation fails, eliminating the need for manual error handling and ensuring higher reliability and robustness in production.</li>\n<li>  <strong>Data Validation:</strong> Leverages Pydantic's powerful validation to ensure response quality, catching errors before they propagate through your system.</li>\n<li>  <strong>Streaming Support:</strong> Real-time processing of partial responses and lists, crucial for interactive applications where immediate feedback is desired.</li>\n<li>  <strong>Multi-Provider Compatibility:</strong> Works with a wide range of LLM providers, including OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Mistral, Cohere, and open-source models via Ollama, offering flexibility.</li>\n<li>  <strong>Type Safety:</strong> Full IDE support with proper type inference and autocompletion, enhancing developer experience and reducing common coding errors.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Here's a quick example of how simple it is to use Instructor:<br>\n</p>\n\n<div class=\"highlight js-code-highlight\">\n<pre class=\"highlight python\"><code><span class=\"kn\">import</span> <span class=\"n\">instructor</span>\n<span class=\"kn\">from</span> <span class=\"n\">pydantic</span> <span class=\"kn\">import</span> <span class=\"n\">BaseModel</span>\n<span class=\"kn\">from</span> <span class=\"n\">openai</span> <span class=\"kn\">import</span> <span class=\"n\">OpenAI</span>\n\n<span class=\"c1\"># 1.

The benefits are clear and impactful:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>  <strong>Reliability:</strong> Automatic retries and robust validation ensure consistent, high-quality outputs, significantly reducing unexpected errors and improving system stability.</li>\n<li>  <strong>Efficiency:</strong> Minimize manual post-processing and error handling, accelerating development cycles and deployment of LLM-powered features.</li>\n<li>  <strong>Data Integration:</strong> Seamlessly feed LLM outputs into databases, APIs, and other software systems, making LLMs true data producers that fit into existing infrastructure.</li>\n<li>  <strong>Automation:</strong> Trigger downstream processes based on specific, validated data points, enabling complex automated workflows that were previously difficult or impossible.</li>\n<li>  <strong>Analytics:</strong> Perform quantitative analysis on LLM-generated information, deriving deeper insights from text that can drive business decisions.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The latest trends in this space continue to emphasize type-safe, validated, and automatically retried outputs, with a strong push for multi-provider compatibility. This ensures that developers can build robust, future-proof applications regardless of their chosen LLM provider.</p>\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  Embrace the Structure, Empower Your LLMs\n</h2>\n\n<p>Structured output is no longer a niche requirement; it's a fundamental necessity for building robust, reliable, and scalable LLM applications. By embracing Pydantic and powerful libraries like Instructor, you gain the tools to overcome the challenges of unstructured text, transforming the raw power of LLMs into precise, actionable data. This approach not only streamlines your development process but also elevates the quality and utility of your AI solutions.</p>\n\n<p>Dive in, define your schemas, and watch your LLM applications become more powerful, predictable, and integrated than ever before. The future of LLM development is structured, and with Pydantic, you're already building it.</p>\n\n","contentLength":0,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Weekly Challenge: Perl has classes now üëç","url":"https://dev.to/simongreennet/weekly-challenge-perl-has-classes-now-4n8e","date":1755428879,"author":"Simon Green","guid":230576,"unread":true,"content":"<h2>\n  \n  \n  Weekly Challenge 334\n</h2>\n\n<p>Each week Mohammad S.

Firstly, software testing, in general, is an important part of software engineering that involves evaluating an application to identify issues before it is released to users. This ensures that the application or software meets the specified requirements and performs as expected.</p>\n\n<p>There are many types of software testing, common ones include unit testing, integration testing, system testing, and <a href=\"https://keploy.io/blog/community/creating-the-balance-between-end-to-end-and-unit-testing\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">end-to-end</a> (E2E) testing. Each type of software testing serves a specific purpose and is done at different stages of the software development lifecycle.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fnp57r22t8k77fctifz2d.png\" class=\"article-body-image-wrapper\"><img src=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fnp57r22t8k77fctifz2d.png\" alt=\"Types of Software Testing\" width=\"800\" height=\"800\"></a></p>\n\n<p>This article aims to give a comprehensive understanding of unit testing. By the end, you will have gained insights into what unit testing is, its benefits, how it is implemented, best practices, and scenarios where it might or might not be suitable. This knowledge will equip you with the necessary information to effectively incorporate unit testing into your software development process.</p>\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  Understanding Unit Testing\n</h2>\n\n<p>Unit testing is a type of software testing where small blocks or units of a software application are tested to make sure they work perfectly on their own. A \"unit\" in unit testing can be looked at as a piece of a module, the smallest testable part, like a function or method. The main goal of unit testing is to ensure that each unit of the software behaves as expected independently.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2F08t750n8x2194c17mh17.png\" class=\"article-body-image-wrapper\"><img src=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2F08t750n8x2194c17mh17.png\" alt=\"Unit testing focuses on verifying the correctness of individual functions or methods in isolation.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1200\"></a></p>\n\n<p>Unit testing differs from other types of software testing in the following ways:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>Integration Testing:</strong> This type of software testing focuses on how different components of the software interact with each other. It ensures that the integrated units function as intended. On the other hand, Unit testing aims at ensuring each unit functions as expected independently.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>System Testing:</strong> System testing assesses the whole integrated software application, ensuring that it satisfies the criteria or meets the requirements of the application. It tests the system as a whole while unit testing deals with individual units.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>End-to-End (E2E) Testing:</strong> E2E testing assesses the complete application from start to end by simulating real-world user scenarios. It is normally performed by beta testers. It ensures that the application functions as expected in a practical setting. On the other hand, unit testing focuses on the function of individual units.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>\n  \n  \n  <strong>Analogy</strong>\n</h3>\n\n<p>Let‚Äôs use a real-world example to illustrate what unit testing could look like. Consider a car manufacturing company. Here, unit testing would be compared to examining individual parts of the car, such as the engine, brakes, or steering wheel, separately to make sure they work correctly before putting/assembling the car together. Integration testing would be testing how the components work together, while system testing would examine the entire car as a whole, and lastly, E2E testing would simulate driving the car on the road to determine its performance under real-world conditions.</p>\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  Benefits of Unit Testing\n</h2>\n\n<p>Unit testing provides several benefits that enhance the software‚Äôs overall quality and maintainability. Below, let‚Äôs discuss some of these benefits.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>Early Bug Detection:</strong> By testing separate units early in the process of development, bugs and defects can be easily exposed and fixed before they affect other parts of the application. In return, the cost and effort placed into debugging are greatly reduced.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Improved Code Quality:</strong> Carrying out unit tests allows the developers to write a much more maintainable and properly structured code. This helps in exposing the flaws in design and highlights the areas that need improvement.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Faster Development:</strong> Writing unit tests usually seems time-consuming, but it can speed up the development of an application in the long run. Through catching bugs early, developers spend less time debugging and more time creating/writing new features. You can also save time by automating unit testing using <a href=\"https://keploy.io/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Keploy</a>.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Regression Testing:</strong> Unit tests act as a safety net, especially when making changes to the codebase. Unit tests can quickly expose the unintended side effects or regressions that arise when new changes are introduced into the existing code during development.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Documentation:</strong> Unit tests are a form of documentation that lays down clearly how each section of code is intended to be used. This is especially important when new developers or new members of the team have to be brought up to speed with the progress of the software.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Confidence in Refactoring:</strong> Refactoring is the process of improving the structure of existing code without changing what it does or the external behavior. Unit tests provide confidence that the refactored code still works as expected, allowing developers to make changes more freely.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  Unit Testing in Practice\n</h2>\n\n<p>In this section, let‚Äôs discuss some practical implementations of Unit Testing and the <a href=\"https://keploy.io/blog/community/10-unit-testing-best-practices\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">popular tools</a> and frameworks used.</p>\n\n<h3>\n  \n  \n  <strong>Common Tools and Frameworks</strong>\n</h3>\n\n<p>Many tools and frameworks are already out there and readily available to assist in unit testing in different programming languages. Here are popular ones in the Python community.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>unittest</strong></p>\n\n<p>This is a built-in testing framework in Python that provides a rich set of tools for writing and running tests.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>pytest</strong></p>\n\n<p>This is a third-party testing framework that is more flexible and easier to use than the built-in unittest framework. It supports fixtures, parameterized tests, and so much more.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Below is an example of a simple unit test using the unittest framework in Python.<br>\n</p>\n\n<div class=\"highlight js-code-highlight\">\n<pre class=\"highlight python\"><code><span class=\"kn\">import</span> <span class=\"n\">unittest</span> \n<span class=\"k\">def</span> <span class=\"nf\">add</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">a</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"n\">b</span><span class=\"p\">):</span>\n    <span class=\"k\">return</span> <span class=\"n\">a</span> <span class=\"o\">+</span> <span class=\"n\">b</span>\n<span class=\"k\">class</span> <span class=\"nc\">TestAddFunction</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">unittest</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"n\">TestCase</span><span class=\"p\">):</span>\n    <span class=\"k\">def</span> <span class=\"nf\">test_add_positive_numbers</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">self</span><span class=\"p\">):</span>\n        <span class=\"n\">self</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nf\">assertEqual</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nf\">add</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"mi\">2</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"mi\">3</span><span class=\"p\">),</span> <span class=\"mi\">5</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n\n    <span class=\"k\">def</span> <span class=\"nf\">test_add_negative_numbers</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">self</span><span class=\"p\">):</span>\n        <span class=\"n\">self</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nf\">assertEqual</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nf\">add</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"o\">-</span><span class=\"mi\">1</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"o\">-</span><span class=\"mi\">1</span><span class=\"p\">),</span> <span class=\"o\">-</span><span class=\"mi\">2</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n\n    <span class=\"k\">def</span> <span class=\"nf\">test_add_positive_and_negative_numbers</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">self</span><span class=\"p\">):</span>\n        <span class=\"n\">self</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nf\">assertEqual</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nf\">add</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"o\">-</span><span class=\"mi\">1</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"mi\">2</span><span class=\"p\">),</span> <span class=\"mi\">1</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n\n<span class=\"k\">if</span> <span class=\"n\">__name__</span> <span class=\"o\">==</span> <span class=\"sh\">'</span><span class=\"s\">__main__</span><span class=\"sh\">'</span><span class=\"p\">:</span>\n    <span class=\"n\">unittest</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nf\">main</span><span class=\"p\">()</span>\n</code></pre>\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>In the above example, we defined a simple <code>add</code> function and wrote three test cases to verify the way it behaves with different inputs. For example, the <code>test_add_positive_numbers()</code> function tests if the <code>dd(2,3)</code>, which is an addition of two positive numbers, returns an output of 5 as required.</p>\n\n<p>For the JavaScript community, the popular unit testing tools include:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Jest</strong></p>\n\n<p>This is a popular testing framework for JavaScript and React applications. It provides an intuitive API for writing tests and has features like code coverage reporting.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Mocha</strong></p>\n\n<p>This is another JavaScript testing framework that is often used in combination with assertion libraries like Chai. It is flexible and extensible.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Here is an example of a simple unit test using the Jest framework in JavaScript.<br>\n</p>\n\n<div class=\"highlight js-code-highlight\">\n<pre class=\"highlight javascript\"><code><span class=\"c1\">// add.js</span>\n<span class=\"kd\">function</span> <span class=\"nf\">add</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nx\">a</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"nx\">b</span><span class=\"p\">)</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span>\n    <span class=\"k\">return</span> <span class=\"nx\">a</span> <span class=\"o\">+</span> <span class=\"nx\">b</span><span class=\"p\">;</span>\n<span class=\"p\">}</span>\n\n<span class=\"nx\">module</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nx\">exports</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"nx\">add</span><span class=\"p\">;</span>\n\n<span class=\"c1\">// add.test.js</span>\n<span class=\"kd\">const</span> <span class=\"nx\">add</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"nf\">require</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"dl\">'</span><span class=\"s1\">./add</span><span class=\"dl\">'</span><span class=\"p\">);</span>\n\n<span class=\"nf\">test</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"dl\">'</span><span class=\"s1\">adds 2 + 3 to equal 5</span><span class=\"dl\">'</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"p\">()</span> <span class=\"o\">=&gt;</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span>\n    <span class=\"nf\">expect</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nf\">add</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"mi\">2</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"mi\">3</span><span class=\"p\">)).</span><span class=\"nf\">toBe</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"mi\">5</span><span class=\"p\">);</span>\n<span class=\"p\">});</span>\n\n<span class=\"nf\">test</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"dl\">'</span><span class=\"s1\">adds -1 + -1 to equal -2</span><span class=\"dl\">'</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"p\">()</span> <span class=\"o\">=&gt;</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span>\n    <span class=\"nf\">expect</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nf\">add</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"o\">-</span><span class=\"mi\">1</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"o\">-</span><span class=\"mi\">1</span><span class=\"p\">)).</span><span class=\"nf\">toBe</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"o\">-</span><span class=\"mi\">2</span><span class=\"p\">);</span>\n<span class=\"p\">});</span>\n\n<span class=\"nf\">test</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"dl\">'</span><span class=\"s1\">adds -1 + 2 to equal 1</span><span class=\"dl\">'</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"p\">()</span> <span class=\"o\">=&gt;</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span>\n    <span class=\"nf\">expect</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nf\">add</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"o\">-</span><span class=\"mi\">1</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"mi\">2</span><span class=\"p\">)).</span><span class=\"nf\">toBe</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"mi\">1</span><span class=\"p\">);</span>\n<span class=\"p\">});</span>\n</code></pre>\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>In this example, we define a simple add function and write three test cases to verify its behavior with different inputs using Jest's testing API. It is an implementation of our tests in the earlier example, but in this case, using JavaScript.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://keploy.io/unit-test-generat\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Keploy</a> is another tool that can be used for unit testing. With it, you can automate the generation of unit tests for multiple programming languages.</p>\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  Best Practices in Unit Testing\n</h2>\n\n<p>Many new developers struggle with how to best implement unit tests. Let‚Äôs discuss some of the best practices to follow to get the most out of unit testing, as it is important to follow best practices. Here are some key recommendations:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Test one thing at a time</strong></p>\n\n<p>Each of the tests performed should focus on a single aspect or behavior of the unit being tested. This makes it easier to uncover the cause of failures, and it also ensures that tests are more maintainable.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Use meaningful names</strong></p>\n\n<p>Test names should clearly describe what is being done or tested. This makes it easy for developers to understand the purpose of each test.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Keep tests independent</strong></p>\n\n<p>Tests should not depend on other tests. Each test should be able to run independently and in any order.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Test both happy and sad paths</strong></p>\n\n<p>Make sure that both the expected (happy) paths and the unexpected (sad) paths are tested. Happy path testing looks at how the product works under perfect conditions; unhappy path testing looks at what happens when things go wrong. Tests should include testing the edge cases and potential error scenarios as well. For example, someone adds more items to the cart than items in stock.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Write tests before code (Test-Driven Development)</strong></p>\n\n<p>Following a test-driven development (TDD) approach helps ensure that code is testable right from the beginning. Write tests before implementing the code to guide the development process.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Run tests frequently</strong></p>\n\n<p>It‚Äôs not enough to know about unit testing. Include unit tests in the development workflow and frequently run them, ideally as part of a continuous integration (CI) pipeline. This approach catches issues early and ensures that tests are always up-to-date.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Automate your unit tests</strong></p>\n\n<p>Automating your unit tests helps you catch bugs early before pushing to production. Keep in mind bugs in production are <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=27917595\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">100x more expensive to fix</a>. Keploy provides a <a href=\"https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Keploy.keployio\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">tool</a> for automating unit tests.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  When to Avoid Unit Testing\n</h2>\n\n<p>While unit testing is mostly beneficial, there are some scenarios where it might not be the best approach. Below is a discussion on this.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Legacy code</strong></p>\n\n<p>When working with legacy code that was developed without testability in mind, introducing and carrying out unit tests can be time-consuming and not the best approach. In these scenarios, one can focus on system testing instead.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Prototyping</strong></p>\n\n<p>In the initial stage of prototyping, the primary goal is to quickly iterate and explore many ideas, and unit testing can significantly slow down the development process in this case. So, in this scenario, unit tests are introduced when the application is now stable.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Very small projects</strong></p>\n\n<p>Simple projects that have minimal complexity in their development do not require unit testing; rather, higher-level tests can be carried out.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  Conclusion\n</h2>\n\n<p>Unit testing is crucial in software engineering in that it offers numerous benefits. Performing unit tests allows developers to detect bugs early, improve code quality, develop systems faster, and even increase confidence in refactoring. By understanding what unit testing is, its benefits, and how to implement it effectively, developers can write more reliable and maintainable code. Tools like <a href=\"https://keploy.io/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Keploy</a> can further streamline testing by auto-generating test cases,, automating unit tests thus reducing manual effort and saving time. However, we highlighted different types of testing at the start of this article, so it is important to note that unit testing is not a one-size-fits-all solution and should be used based on the context and requirements of the project.</p>\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  FAQs\n</h2>\n\n<h3>\n  \n  \n  1.

Like many of you, I did it for the love of coding and the satisfaction of building something useful. But a recent experience‚Äîlearning that my Bluelight app was being used in San Francisco‚Äîwas a major turning point. It made me realize these tools were more than just a hobby; they were solving real-world problems.</p>\n\n<p>This got me thinking about how I could continue to build and support these tools at a higher level. The answer wasn't to stop sharing, but to find a way to make it sustainable. So, I've decided to turn a few of my most impactful projects into professional tools to fund their continued development and ensure they get the support they deserve.</p>\n\n<p>I'm officially launching my first products, and I want to share them with the Dev.to community first.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Introducing ShieldFortress: A Developer-Focused Security Tool</p>\n\n<p>I was tired of bloated, privacy-invasive antivirus software that felt like it was doing more harm than good. So, I built ShieldFortress from the ground up. It's not your average antivirus; it's a transparent, lightweight security tool designed by a developer, for developers.</p>\n\n<p>ShieldFortress combines heuristic and signature-based scanning to catch both known and unknown threats. It integrates directly with the VirusTotal API, giving you an instant second opinion on any file from dozens of security engines. It's a no-nonsense tool that gives you full control and visibility over your system's security without sacrificing performance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Complete Toolkit: A Professional Bundle üíº</p>\n\n<p>For those who want to supercharge their workflow, I‚Äôve created a single bundle that includes my three core applications. By purchasing this toolkit, you get a complete set of professional tools at a significant discount, while directly supporting my work.</p>\n\n<div class=\"highlight js-code-highlight\">\n<pre class=\"highlight plaintext\"><code>ShieldFortress ($25 value): Your first and last line of defense against modern threats.\n\nNetwork Reconnaissance Tool ($10 value): A streamlined utility for network discovery and port scanning.\n\nBluelight Financial Report Generator ($10 value): A lightweight desktop app for quick financial analysis and reporting.\n</code></pre>\n\n</div>\n\n<p>This is more than just a purchase. It's an investment in ad-free, private, and reliable software that I will continue to build and improve.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Future of My Work</p>\n\n<p>This is a big step for me, and I'm excited to see where this journey goes. I'll be sharing more about the development process for these tools and other projects. I'm grateful for the support I've already received from the community and look forward to this new chapter.</p>\n\n<p>You can check out the full toolkit here: <a

classification and rigid, rule‚Äëbased scripts to Large Language Models (LLMs) that can hold conversations with fluency.</p>\n\n<p>And yet ‚Äî in real‚Äëworld production environments where accuracy, trustworthiness, and scalability matter ‚Äî LLMs alone aren‚Äôt enough. The real magic happens when you blend their creativity with structured, reliable systems.</p>\n\n<p>In this post, we‚Äôll explore how <strong>Rasa</strong>, <strong>LLMs</strong>, and <strong>RAG</strong> (Retrieval‚ÄëAugmented Generation) can work together to build chatbots that are <strong>natural, reliable, and grounded</strong>.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fk4lt53l6vifx22zya624.webp\" class=\"article-body-image-wrapper\"><img src=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fk4lt53l6vifx22zya624.webp\" alt=\" \" width=\"800\" height=\"533\"></a></p>\n\n<h3>\n  \n  \n  Bridging the Gap: Why Mix Rasa, LLMs, and RAG?\n</h3>\n\n<p>LLMs are brilliant at generating smooth, coherent replies ‚Äî but they can ‚Äúhallucinate‚Äù when they don‚Äôt know the answer, especially in regulated or domain‚Äëspecific contexts. Rasa, on the other hand, excels at <strong>predictable control</strong> ‚Äî intent classification, slot filling, business logic, and integrating with APIs. RAG acts as the glue, retrieving trusted documents, FAQs, or knowledge base entries, feeding them into the LLM so responses remain factual and grounded in the organization‚Äôs data.</p>\n\n<p>This is where:</p>\n\n<p>Rasa ‚ü∂ gives you predictable control: intent classification, slot filling, API calls, and workflow logic.<br>\nRAG (Retrieval‚ÄëAugmented Generation) ‚ü∂ injects facts by retrieving trusted answers from your documentation, FAQs, or knowledge base.<br>\nLLM ‚ü∂ uses both user input and retrieved context to generate natural, grounded responses.</p>\n<h3>\n  \n  \n  The Architecture at a Glance\n</h3>\n\n<p>You can think of this trio as a <strong>human‚Äëlike conversation team</strong> inside your chatbot:  </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Rasa</strong> is the <em>executive planner</em> ‚Äî listening to the user, interpreting their intent, and deciding which pathway to follow.\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>RAG</strong> plays the <em>research assistant</em> ‚Äî diving into the knowledge base and coming back with the most relevant facts.\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>LLM</strong> is the <em>storyteller</em> ‚Äî presenting those facts in a friendly, human‚Äëlike tone.\n</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>A typical workflow looks like this:  </p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>The user asks a question.\n</li>\n<li>Rasa analyses the intent and determines whether this is a standard flow (e.g., ‚ÄúBook me a meeting‚Äù) or a factual query (‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs your refund policy?‚Äù).\n</li>\n<li>For factual queries, Rasa triggers the RAG pipeline.\n</li>\n<li>The query is converted into an embedding vector, similar content is fetched from a FAISS index or other vector storage.\n</li>\n<li>Retrieved data is inserted into an LLM prompt so the answer is grounded in the right context.\n</li>\n<li>The LLM generates a polished response, and Rasa sends it back to the user.\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>\n  \n  \n  Production Benefits\n</h3>\n\n<p>By combining these components together, you create a balanced conversational system: Rasa provides structured, predictable dialogue control; RAG contributes accurate, context‚Äëaware information; and the LLM adds natural, human‚Äëlike interaction. This blend minimizes misleading responses, handles complex queries with context retention, scales gracefully as your knowledge base grows, and allows new features to be introduced without disrupting existing behavior.</p>\n\n\n<h4>\n  \n  \n  <strong>Minimal Working Example (Rasa + FAISS RAG Custom Action)</strong>\n</h4>\n\n\n<div class=\"highlight js-code-highlight\">\n<pre class=\"highlight python\"><code><span class=\"c1\"># Pseudo-code: Rasa + FAISS RAG Custom Action\n</span>\n<span class=\"n\">load</span> <span class=\"nf\">embedding_model</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"sh\">\"</span><span class=\"s\">all-MiniLM-L6-v2</span><span class=\"sh\">\"</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n<span class=\"n\">load</span> <span class=\"nf\">faiss_index</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"sh\">\"</span><span class=\"s\">kb.index</span><span class=\"sh\">\"</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>  <span class=\"c1\"># Built from company knowledge base\n</span>\n<span class=\"k\">class</span> <span class=\"nc\">ActionRAGLookup</span><span class=\"p\">:</span>\n    <span class=\"n\">function</span> <span class=\"nf\">name</span><span class=\"p\">():</span>\n        <span class=\"k\">return</span> <span class=\"sh\">\"</span><span class=\"s\">action_rag_lookup</span><span class=\"sh\">\"</span>\n\n    <span class=\"n\">function</span> <span class=\"nf\">run</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">dispatcher</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"n\">tracker</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"n\">domain</span><span class=\"p\">):</span>\n        <span class=\"n\">user_query</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"n\">tracker</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nf\">get_latest_message_text</span><span class=\"p\">()</span>\n        <span class=\"n\">query_vector</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"n\">embedding_model</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nf\">encode</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">user_query</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n\n        <span class=\"n\">distances</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"n\">indices</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"n\">faiss_index</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nf\">search</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">query_vector</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"n\">top_k</span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"mi\">1</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n        <span class=\"n\">best_answer</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"nf\">read_from_file</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"sh\">\"</span><span class=\"s\">kb_answers.txt</span><span class=\"sh\">\"</span><span class=\"p\">)[</span><span class=\"n\">indices</span><span class=\"p\">[</span><span class=\"mi\">0</span><span class=\"p\">]]</span>\n\n        <span class=\"n\">dispatcher</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nf\">send_message</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">best_answer</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n        <span class=\"k\">return</span> <span class=\"n\">no_events</span>\n\n</code></pre>\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  Minimal Working Example (Pseudo‚ÄëCode)\n</h2>\n\n\n<div class=\"highlight js-code-highlight\">\n<pre class=\"highlight plaintext\"><code>load embedding_model(\"all-MiniLM-L6-v2\")\nload faiss_index(\"kb.index\")  # Built from company knowledge base\n\nclass ActionRAGLookup:\n    function name():\n        return \"action_rag_lookup\"\n\n    function run(dispatcher, tracker, domain):\n        user_query = tracker.get_latest_message_text()\n        query_vector = embedding_model.encode(user_query)\n\n        distances, indices = faiss_index.search(query_vector, top_k=1)\n        best_answer = read_from_file(\"kb_answers.txt\")[indices[0]]\n\n        dispatcher.send_message(best_answer)\n        return no_events\n</code></pre>\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  Step‚Äëby‚ÄëStep Implementation\n</h2>\n\n<p><strong>1.

You've built a sophisticated profile of the likely culprit, but how confident are you that your profile accurately identifies the <em>actual</em> criminal? In machine learning, this \"confidence\" translates to <em>model evaluation</em>. Specifically, for classification models ‚Äì which categorize data into distinct groups ‚Äì we need robust metrics to assess their performance. This article delves into four crucial metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and the F1-score, explaining how they work and why they're essential for building reliable and trustworthy AI systems.</p>\n\n<h3>\n  \n  \n  The Core Concepts: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-Score\n</h3>\n\n<p>Let's start with a simple analogy. Imagine a medical test for a disease. The test can either predict the disease (positive) or not (negative). We can then categorize the results into four groups:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>True Positive (TP):</strong> The test correctly predicts the disease in a person who actually has it.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>True Negative (TN):</strong> The test correctly predicts no disease in a person who doesn't have it.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>False Positive (FP):</strong> The test incorrectly predicts the disease in a person who doesn't have it (a \"false alarm\").</li>\n<li>\n<strong>False Negative (FN):</strong> The test incorrectly predicts no disease in a person who actually has it (a missed diagnosis).</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Based on these, our key metrics are defined as follows:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Accuracy:</strong> The overall correctness of the model.  It's the ratio of correctly classified instances (TP + TN) to the total number of instances (TP + TN + FP + FN).</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>$Accuracy = \\frac{TP + TN}{TP + TN + FP + FN}$</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Precision:</strong>  Out of all the instances <em>predicted</em> as positive, what proportion was actually positive?  It measures the accuracy of positive predictions.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>$Precision = \\frac{TP}{TP + FP}$</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Recall (Sensitivity):</strong> Out of all the instances that are <em>actually</em> positive, what proportion did the model correctly identify? It measures the model's ability to find all positive instances.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>$Recall = \\frac{TP}{TP + FN}$</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>F1-Score:</strong> The harmonic mean of Precision and Recall.  It provides a balanced measure considering both false positives and false negatives.  A high F1-score indicates good performance in both precision and recall.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>$F1-Score = 2 * \\frac{Precision * Recall}{Precision + Recall}$</p>\n\n<h3>\n  \n  \n  A Pythonic Glimpse:

counts. Remember to handle potential division by zero errors, as shown in the code.</p>\n\n<h3>\n  \n  \n  Real-World Applications:  Where Do These Metrics Shine?\n</h3>\n\n<p>These metrics are crucial in various applications:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Spam detection:</strong>  High precision is vital to avoid marking legitimate emails as spam (false positives).  High recall ensures that most spam emails are correctly identified (minimizing false negatives).</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Medical diagnosis:</strong>  Recall is paramount; missing a disease (false negative) can have severe consequences.  While precision is important, a few false positives might be acceptable if they lead to further investigation.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Fraud detection:</strong>  Similar to medical diagnosis, minimizing false negatives (missed fraudulent activities) is critical, even if it means a higher rate of false positives (legitimate transactions flagged).</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Self-driving cars:</strong>  High accuracy is essential for safe operation, but different metrics might be prioritized depending on the specific scenario (e.g., prioritizing recall to avoid collisions).</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>\n  \n  \n  Challenges and Ethical Considerations\n</h3>\n\n<p>While powerful, these metrics have limitations:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Imbalanced datasets:</strong>  If one class significantly outweighs another, accuracy can be misleading.  A model might achieve high accuracy by simply predicting the majority class.  Precision, recall, and F1-score offer a more nuanced perspective in such cases.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Context matters:</strong> The relative importance of precision and recall depends on the specific application.  There's no universally \"best\" metric.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Bias and fairness:</strong>  Biased training data can lead to models that perform poorly for certain groups.  Careful evaluation across different subgroups is crucial to ensure fairness and avoid perpetuating existing biases.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>\n  \n  \n  The Future of Model Evaluation\n</h3>\n\n<p>Model evaluation for classification is a continuously evolving field. Research focuses on developing more sophisticated metrics that address the limitations of traditional approaches, particularly in dealing with imbalanced data and complex real-world scenarios. Furthermore, explainable AI (XAI) is gaining traction, aiming to provide better insight into <em>why</em> a model makes specific predictions, improving trust and accountability. The journey towards building truly reliable and ethical AI systems heavily relies on the ongoing development and refinement of robust evaluation techniques. Understanding Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-score is just the starting point of this crucial journey.</p>\n\n","contentLength":0,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Project Management for Software Engineers: From Chaos to Clarity","url":"https://dev.to/parizad/project-management-for-software-engineers-from-chaos-to-clarity-4b7f","date":1755408232,"author":"Parizad","guid":230500,"unread":true,"content":"<p>In the dynamic world of software development, the line between groundbreaking innovation and utter chaos is perilously thin. We‚Äôve all been there: deadlines flying by, requirements changing mid-sprint, communication breaking down, and a creeping sense of dread that the project is spiraling out of control. This state of \"chaos\" is not just stressful; it‚Äôs a direct threat to code quality, team morale, and business outcomes. But what if you could transform that chaos into clarity? This is the promise of effective <strong>project management for software engineers</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>This comprehensive guide is not for traditional project managers in corner offices. It's for you‚Äîthe software engineer, the team lead, the architect‚Äîwho lives and breathes code but recognizes the critical need for structure, process, and predictability. We will explore how to move from a reactive, chaotic environment to a proactive, clear, and efficient one by embracing core project management principles tailored specifically for the software development lifecycle.</p>\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  Part 1: Diagnosing the Chaos: Why Software Projects Derail\n</h2>\n\n<p>Before we can find the cure, we must understand the disease. The \"chaos\" in software development isn't random; it's a collection of predictable anti-patterns that emerge when process is neglected. Recognizing these symptoms is the first step toward clarity.</p>\n\n<h3>\n  \n  \n  The Hydra of Scope Creep\n</h3>\n\n<p>Scope creep is the insidious, uncontrolled growth in a project's scope after it has begun. It starts with a seemingly small request: \"Can you just add this one little button?\" Soon, you have a dozen \"little\" requests, and the original architecture groans under the weight of unforeseen features.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Symptom:</strong> The finish line keeps moving further away. The features you're building today were not in the original plan.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Root Cause:</strong> Lack of a clearly defined and agreed-upon scope from the outset. Failure to establish a formal change control process.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>\n  \n  \n  The Black Hole of Poor Communication\n</h3>\n\n<p>When communication fails, assumptions flourish. An engineer might assume a feature works one way, while the product owner envisions something completely different. Silos form between front-end and back-end teams, QA, and operations. Information is lost in endless email chains or forgotten in Slack channels.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fd6zukri8gje4299d38ym.jpg\" class=\"article-body-image-wrapper\"><img src=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fd6zukri8gje4299d38ym.jpg\" alt=\" \" width=\"800\" height=\"418\"></a></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Symptom:</strong> Constant rework, integration nightmares, and a feeling that \"no one is on the same page.\"</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Root Cause:</strong> Absence of a centralized communication plan, irregular or ineffective meetings (like daily stand-ups that last an hour), and a lack of shared documentation.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>\n  \n  \n  The Quicksand of Inaccurate Estimation\n</h3>\n\n<p>\"How long will this take?\" It's the most common question and the hardest to answer. Without a structured approach, estimations are often wild guesses based on optimism rather than data. This leads to unrealistic deadlines, immense pressure on the development team, and inevitable burnout.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Symptom:</strong> Consistently missing deadlines, forcing engineers to cut corners on quality and testing to \"catch up.\"</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Root Cause:</strong> Rushing the planning phase, failing to break down large tasks into smaller, manageable chunks, and not accounting for unforeseen complexities or technical debt.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>\n  \n  \n  The Slow Poison of Technical Debt\n</h3>\n\n<p>In the rush to meet a deadline, it's tempting to write \"good enough\" code instead of clean, scalable code. This is technical debt. Each shortcut taken is a loan that must be repaid later, with interest. Over time, this debt accumulates, making the codebase fragile, difficult to modify, and slow to work with.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Symptom:</strong> A simple feature change takes weeks instead of days. The number of bugs seems to increase exponentially.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Root Cause:</strong> Prioritizing short-term speed over long-term system health. Lack of dedicated time for refactoring, code reviews, and architectural improvements.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  Part 2: The Blueprint for Clarity: Core Software Project Management Methodologies\n</h2>\n\n<p>Clarity isn't an accident; it's a designed outcome. The tools for this design are project management methodologies. While there are many, most modern software development revolves around the principles of Agile.</p>\n\n<h3>\n  \n  \n  Agile: Embracing Change and Iteration\n</h3>\n\n<p>Agile is not a single, rigid framework but a mindset based on the Agile Manifesto, which values:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Individuals and interactions over processes and tools</li>\n<li>Working software over comprehensive documentation</li>\n<li>Customer collaboration over contract negotiation</li>\n<li>Responding to change over following a plan</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Agile acknowledges that you can't know everything at the start of a project. Instead, it promotes working in small, iterative cycles (sprints) to deliver value, gather feedback, and adapt.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fvnsdhq4s8lpv2v6belb8.jpg\" class=\"article-body-image-wrapper\"><img src=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fvnsdhq4s8lpv2v6belb8.jpg\" alt=\" \" width=\"800\" height=\"450\"></a></p>\n\n<h4>\n  \n  \n  Scrum: The Most Popular Agile Framework\n</h4>\n\n<p>Scrum provides a lightweight yet powerful structure for implementing Agile principles. Its key components include:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Roles:</strong> Product Owner (defines <em>what</em> to build), Scrum Master (facilitates the process), and the Development Team (builds the product).</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Artifacts:</strong> Product Backlog (a prioritized list of all desired features), Sprint Backlog (the work selected for the current sprint), and the Increment (the usable piece of software produced during a sprint).</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Events (Ceremonies):</strong>\n\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Sprint Planning:</strong> The team decides what can be accomplished in the upcoming sprint.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Daily Stand-up:</strong> A quick 15-minute meeting to sync on progress, plans, and impediments.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Sprint Review:</strong> The team demonstrates what they built during the sprint to stakeholders.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Sprint Retrospective:</strong> The team reflects on the sprint to identify what went well and what can be improved.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<h4>\n  \n  \n  Kanban: Visualizing Workflow and Limiting Work-in-Progress\n</h4>\n\n<p>Kanban is another Agile approach focused on visualizing your workflow and improving it continuously. Its core practice is the Kanban board, with columns representing stages of work (e.g., To Do, In Progress, In Review, Done).</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Key Principles:</strong>\n\n<ol>\n<li> <strong>Visualize the Workflow:</strong> Makes bottlenecks and dependencies immediately obvious.</li>\n<li> <strong>Limit Work-In-Progress (WIP):</strong> By setting limits on how many tasks can be in a single column (e.g., \"In Progress\"), Kanban forces the team to focus on finishing tasks rather than starting new ones. This dramatically improves flow and reduces context-switching.</li>\n<li> <strong>Manage Flow:</strong> The goal is to move tasks smoothly and predictably through the workflow.</li>\n<li> <strong>Make Policies Explicit:</strong> Everyone on the team understands the \"definition of done\" for each stage.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>\n  \n  \n  Choosing Your Path: Scrum vs. Kanban vs. Hybrid\n</h3>\n\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Choose Scrum when:</strong> You have a project that can be broken down into discrete chunks of value and you benefit from the rhythm of fixed-length sprints. It‚Äôs excellent for product development.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Choose Kanban when:</strong> Your work is more continuous and reactive, like handling support tickets, bug fixes, or operations. It‚Äôs excellent for teams that need to manage a constant flow of incoming requests with varying priorities.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Hybrid (Scrumban):</strong> Many teams adopt a hybrid approach, using Scrum's roles and events but managing their sprint backlog with a Kanban board to better visualize flow and manage WIP.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  Part 3: The Engineer's Toolkit: Practical Steps from Chaos to Clarity\n</h2>\n\n<p>Methodologies provide the map, but you still need to take the journey. Here are actionable steps a software engineer can champion to bring clarity to their team.</p>\n\n<h3>\n  \n  \n  Step 1: Define 'Done' with Ruthless Precision\n</h3>\n\n<p>The single most significant source of confusion is a vague definition of what \"done\" means.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>For a Task:</strong> Does \"done\" mean the code is written? Or does it mean it's written, unit tested, peer-reviewed, merged to the main branch, and deployed to a staging environment?</li>\n<li>\n<strong>For a Feature:</strong> Does \"done\" mean the feature is functional? Or does it mean it's functional, documented, meets performance and security requirements, and has been accepted by the product owner?</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Action:</strong> Work with your team to create a formal <strong>Definition of Done (DoD)</strong> checklist. Every item in the backlog must meet this checklist before it can be considered complete. This eliminates ambiguity and ensures quality.</p>\n\n<h3>\n  \n  \n  Step 2: Master the Art of Breaking Down Work\n</h3>\n\n<p>A task like \"Build user authentication\" is a recipe for chaos. It's too big, too vague, and impossible to estimate accurately. The key is to break it down into small, verifiable user stories or tasks.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Bad:</strong> \"Build user authentication\"</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Good:</strong>\n\n<ul>\n<li>\"As a user, I want to register with an email and password so I can create an account.\"</li>\n<li>\"As a user, I want to log in with my credentials so I can access my profile.\"</li>\n<li>\"As a user, I want a 'Forgot Password' link to reset my password.\"</li>\n<li>\"As an engineer, I need to set up the database schema for the users table.\"</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Action:</strong> Practice a technique called <strong>vertical slicing</strong>. Each user story should deliver a small, complete piece of end-to-end functionality, even if it's not visible to the end-user. Aim for tasks that can be completed in 1-3 days.</p>\n\n<h3>\n  \n  \n  Step 3: Embrace Data-Driven Estimation\n</h3>\n\n<p>Stop guessing. Start using data. Story points are a popular Agile estimation technique that uses relative sizing instead of absolute time. A task estimated at 2 story points should be roughly twice the effort (complexity, uncertainty, and work) as a 1-point task.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>How it Works:</strong> The team plays \"planning poker,\" where everyone privately estimates a task's story points and then discusses their reasoning. This exposes hidden assumptions and leads to a more accurate, collective estimate.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>The Payoff:</strong> Over a few sprints, you can calculate your team's <strong>velocity</strong>‚Äîthe average number of story points completed per sprint. This makes future planning and forecasting remarkably accurate and defends the team against unrealistic deadlines.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>\n  \n  \n  Step 4: Make Code Reviews a Non-Negotiable Pillar of Quality\n</h3>\n\n<p>Code reviews are not just for catching bugs. They are a powerful <a href=\"https://oktuple.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">project management tool</a> for:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Knowledge Sharing:</strong> Spreads understanding of the codebase across the team, reducing knowledge silos.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Enforcing Standards:</strong> Ensures code adheres to agreed-upon style guides and best practices.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Mentorship:</strong> Provides a channel for senior engineers to mentor junior developers.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Improving Clarity:</strong> Forces the author to write clean, understandable code that they can defend.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Action:</strong> Implement a mandatory pull request (PR) process. Require at least one or two approvals before any code is merged. Keep PRs small and focused on a single task to make reviewing easier and faster.</p>\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  Part 4: The Essential Arsenal: Leveraging Tools for Maximum Clarity\n</h2>\n\n<p>Processes and methodologies are the strategy, but tools are the tactical weapons that help you execute that strategy efficiently. The right set of tools can serve as the central nervous system for your project, providing a single source of truth and automating repetitive tasks.</p>\n\n<h3>\n  \n  \n  The Central Hub: Your Project Management Tool\n</h3>\n\n<p>This is the most critical piece of software for achieving clarity. A scattered mess of spreadsheets, emails, and sticky notes is a hallmark of a chaotic project. A dedicated <strong>Project management tool</strong> centralizes everything: tasks, backlogs, progress tracking, and communication. It provides unparalleled visibility for the entire team and stakeholders. Popular choices in the software world include:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Jira:</strong> The industry standard for Agile software teams. Highly customizable with powerful features for Scrum and Kanban, detailed reporting, and deep integration with developer tools.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Asana:</strong> Known for its user-friendly interface and flexibility. It's great for teams that want a less rigid structure than Jira but still need powerful task management and workflow visualization.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Trello:</strong> A simple and intuitive Kanban-based tool. It's perfect for smaller teams or projects that don't need the heavy overhead of more complex systems.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>ClickUp:</strong> A newer, all-in-one platform that aims to replace multiple apps by combining task management, docs, goals, and more into a single user experience.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>\n  \n  \n  Version Control: The Bedrock of Collaboration\n</h3>\n\n<p>It's impossible to imagine modern software development without a version control system (VCS). It's the ultimate tool for managing changes, collaborating on code, and recovering from errors.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Git:</strong> The de facto standard for VCS.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket:</strong> These platforms build on top of Git, adding essential project management features like pull requests, issue tracking, code reviews, and CI/CD pipelines. A well-organized repository on one of these platforms is a cornerstone of a clear project.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>\n  \n  \n  Communication Channels: Real-Time and Asynchronous\n</h3>\n\n<p>Effective communication requires dedicated channels.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Slack/Microsoft Teams:</strong> Essential for real-time, synchronous communication. Create dedicated channels for specific projects, teams, or topics (#backend, #frontend-bugs, #deployment-alerts) to keep conversations organized and out of noisy general channels.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Confluence/Notion:</strong> Crucial for asynchronous communication and long-term knowledge management. This is where you document architectural decisions, meeting notes, project plans, and onboarding guides. This \"written-down\" culture prevents knowledge from walking out the door when a team member leaves.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>\n  \n  \n  Automation: The Clarity Multiplier\n</h3>\n\n<p>Automation eliminates manual, error-prone tasks, freeing up engineers to focus on what matters: writing quality code.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD):</strong> Tools like Jenkins, GitHub Actions, and CircleCI automatically build, test, and deploy your code every time a change is merged. This provides rapid feedback and ensures the main branch is always in a stable, deployable state.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  Part 5: Beyond Process and Tools: Cultivating a Culture of Clarity\n</h2>\n\n<p>You can have the best tools and the most refined processes, but if your team culture is toxic or dysfunctional, you will remain in chaos. Clarity is ultimately a human endeavor.</p>\n\n<h3>\n  \n  \n  Psychological Safety: The Freedom to Be Wrong\n</h3>\n\n<p>Team members must feel safe to speak up, ask \"dumb\" questions, challenge ideas (even from senior members), and admit mistakes without fear of blame or retribution. In a psychologically safe environment, problems are identified early, and innovative solutions emerge.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How to Foster It:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Leaders should admit their own mistakes.</li>\n<li>Frame feedback as a collective learning opportunity, not personal criticism.</li>\n<li>Encourage curiosity and active listening during discussions.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>\n  \n  \n  Ownership and Accountability\n</h3>\n\n<p>In a clear and functional team, every member feels a sense of ownership over the project's success. This isn't about assigning blame when things go wrong; it's about empowering individuals to take responsibility for their work and proactively solve problems.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How to Foster It:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Avoid micromanagement. Give engineers autonomy over <em>how</em> they implement a solution.</li>\n<li>Clearly define roles and responsibilities.</li>\n<li>Celebrate both individual contributions and team successes.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>\n  \n  \n  The Retrospective Mindset: Continuous Improvement\n</h3>\n\n<p>The single most powerful habit for moving from chaos to clarity is the practice of regular reflection. The Sprint Retrospective in Scrum is the formal ceremony for this, but the mindset can be applied daily.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How to Foster It:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>End every major task or feature with a mini-retrospective: What went well? What was a struggle? What could we do differently next time?</li>\n<li>Treat failures as data points for learning, not as reasons for punishment.</li>\n<li>Focus on small, incremental process improvements. Over time, these compound into a dramatically more effective and clear workflow.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  Conclusion: The Transformation is a Journey\n</h2>\n\n<p>The journey from chaos to clarity is not a one-time fix; it's an ongoing commitment to principles, process, and people. By diagnosing the symptoms of chaos in your own projects, adopting an Agile mindset, implementing practical steps like a clear Definition of Done, leveraging the right tools, and fostering a culture of psychological safety and continuous improvement, you can fundamentally transform your work environment.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Project management for software engineers</strong> is not about adding bureaucracy. It's about removing friction. It's about creating a system where creativity can flourish, where engineers can do their best work, and where building amazing software becomes a predictable, rewarding, and clear process. The chaos is optional. Clarity is a choice.</p>\n\n","contentLength":0,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Tasklin, a Python CLI to run multiple AI models","url":"https://dev.to/jetroni/tasklin-a-python-cli-to-run-multiple-ai-models-30b3","date":1755396039,"author":"Jetron Saiti","guid":230485,"unread":true,"content":"<p>I‚Äôve been working on Tasklin, a Python CLI that lets you run prompts on different AI models like OpenAI, Ollama, and more, all from one tool.</p>\n\n<p>It‚Äôs designed to make experimenting with AI easier, automating tasks, integrating AI into pipelines, testing different models, generating content, or just trying out different providers without constantly switching between tools.</p>\n\n<p>I‚Äôd love to hear how you‚Äôd use it, any ideas for improvements, or interesting ways to integrate it into your projects.</p>\n\n<p>Links:<br>\nGitHub: <a href=\"https://github.com/jetroni/tasklin\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://github.com/jetroni/tasklin</a><br>\nPyPI: <a href=\"https://pypi.org/project/tasklin\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://pypi.org/project/tasklin</a></p>\n\n","contentLength":0,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Title: Meta's Approach to Superintelligence: Keeping Control with AI Models","url":"https://dev.to/yagyaraj_sharma_6cd410179/title-metas-approach-to-superintelligence-keeping-control-with-ai-models-a6e","date":1755390324,"author":"Insights YRS","guid":230465,"unread":true,"content":"<h2>\n  \n  \n  Title: Meta's Approach to Superintelligence: Keeping Control with AI Models\n</h2>\n\n<p>Meta, the parent company of Facebook, has recently announced that it will not be open-sourcing all of its 'superintelligence' AI models.

The Forgotten Staple\n</h2>\n\n<p>There was a time when Django was the go-to for web apps. Clean admin, fast MVPs, and battle-tested security‚Äîall baked in. It was everywhere.</p>\n\n<p>Then came the React hype cycle. JavaScript frameworks multiplied like mushrooms, and Django got labeled ‚Äúold school.‚Äù</p>\n\n<p>Meanwhile, companies like Instagram and Pinterest quietly kept Django in production. And outside Silicon Valley, governments, universities, and healthcare systems never stopped trusting it.</p>\n\n<p>Now in 2025, teams are realizing: speed, security, and stability still matter. Django never stopped delivering.</p>\n\n<p>This isn‚Äôt nostalgia. It‚Äôs about why Django‚Äôs back in the spotlight‚Äînot because it‚Äôs trendy, but because it works.</p>\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  2. Governments Still Trust It More Than Startups Do\n</h2>\n\n<p>You‚Äôd think governments would be the last to bet on a web framework. Turns out, Django is quietly powering national infrastructure in dozens of countries:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Ireland‚Äôs government portal</strong></li>\n<li><strong>NASA JPL‚Äôs site</strong></li>\n<li><strong>miArgentina, serving 45M+ users</strong></li>\n<li><strong>France‚Äôs Sites Faciles CMS, via Wagtail</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>A 2025 scan showed 88 countries with government websites running Django.</p>\n\n<p>Why? Because Django‚Äôs boring‚Äîin the best way. Predictable upgrades, built-in security, no fire drills on deployment. Exactly what bureaucracies need.</p>\n\n<p>If it‚Äôs good enough for national platforms, maybe startups should rethink chasing the latest headless flavor-of-the-week.</p>\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  3. Startups Quietly Coming Back\n</h2>\n\n<p>Founders are tired of duct-taping Firebase, Supabase, Stripe, and a dozen services. Somewhere around the 9th JS framework of the week, they ask:</p>\n\n<p>‚ÄúWait‚Ä¶ should we just use Django?‚Äù</p>\n\n<p>The answer: probably yes.</p>\n\n<p>With Django you get:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Auth: ‚úÖ built-in</li>\n<li>Admin panel: ‚úÖ ready day one</li>\n<li>ORM: ‚úÖ rock solid</li>\n<li>Security: ‚úÖ defaults locked down</li>\n<li>APIs: ‚úÖ DRF, or GraphQL if you need</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>In 2025, demand for Django devs is climbing. Stack Overflow‚Äôs 2024 survey showed a 15% bump in Python/Django job postings year over year.</p>\n\n<p>Why? Because teams want to ship now, not rewrite later.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Django in 2025: Modern Where It Matters</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Think Django is still ‚Äúmonolithic and sync-only‚Äù? Time to catch up.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Async support</strong>: Django 5+ runs ASGI, WebSockets, Channels.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Postgres pooling</strong>: Native support, fewer dropped connections, faster responses. Peterbe benchmarked a 5.4x speedup.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Python 3.13 ready</strong>: Clean syntax, better perf.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Ecosystem</strong>: DRF, Graphene for GraphQL, Channels for async tasks.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>And DevOps isn‚Äôt 2010 anymore:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Docker and compose configs are everywhere</li>\n<li>Gunicorn + ASGI/WSGI dual support</li>\n<li>CI/CD with GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, etc.</li>\n<li>Cloud-native friendly: Railway, Fly.io, Fargate, Heroku</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>It‚Äôs boring in the right ways, modern where it matters.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Security, Stability, Community</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Frameworks die when the people behind them burn out. Django? Still evolving.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Security baked in:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>CSRF protection on by default</li>\n<li>SQL injection prevention in the ORM</li>\n<li>Secure password hashing</li>\n<li>XSS + clickjacking protection</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Stability</strong>:<br>\nReadable codebases, clean separation, maintainable over years. Not a soup of microservices and cursed YAML.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Community:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>20 years of active development</li>\n<li>Django Girls chapters in 90+ countries</li>\n<li>DSF security team moves fast on patches</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>No VC overlord, no hype cycle fatigue. Just a mature OSS project with consistent governance.</p>\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  6. What Silicon Valley Forgot, the World Remembers\n</h2>\n\n<p>Django didn‚Äôt disappear. It just stopped trending on Hacker News.</p>\n\n<p>Governments trust it. Startups are rediscovering it. Devs are realizing ‚Äúcool‚Äù ‚â† sustainable.</p>\n\n<p>Django 6.0 is around the corner with even better async support, possible composite keys, and more ergonomic tooling.</p>\n\n<p>The takeaway?<br>\nSometimes the best tool isn‚Äôt the newest one. It‚Äôs the one that still works.</p>\n\n<p>If you need to build something real in 2025‚Äîsomething that has to run, not just demo well in a pitch‚Äîgive Django another look.</p>\n\n<p>Because while Silicon Valley was busy forgetting it, the rest of the world kept shipping.</p>\n\n<p>‚úçÔ∏è Written by <strong>Anas Issath</strong><br>\nBackend engineer.

I've seen Go applications buckle under pressure when processing millions of requests daily, often due to overlooked memory inefficiencies. The garbage collector becomes a bottleneck, stealing precious milliseconds from response times. Through trial and error across several high-load systems, I've developed strategies that significantly reduce GC pressure while maintaining Go's idiomatic simplicity.  </p><p>Consider a common scenario: an API gateway handling 50,000 requests per second. Traditional approaches create new objects for each request, flooding the heap and triggering frequent GC pauses. My solution combines four key techniques‚Äîobject pooling, stack allocation, custom arenas, and memory layout tuning‚Äîto keep allocations primarily on the stack and reuse heap objects strategically.  </p><p><strong>Object Pooling with sync.Pool</strong><p>\nReusing objects is fundamental. I implement pools for frequently allocated types like HTTP requests and buffers. This snippet shows a thread-safe pool for request objects:</p></p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>In production, this simple pattern reduced request object allocations by 87% in my last project. The key is resetting slices with  instead of reallocating, preserving underlying array capacity.  </p><p><p>\nGo's escape analysis sometimes sends variables to the heap unexpectedly. I use compiler directives and careful structuring to prevent this:</p></p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Run  to analyze escapes. I once shaved 200Œºs off latency by converting a small  from pointer to value receiver.  </p><p><p>\nFor short-lived buffers, I implement arena allocation using channels:</p></p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>This pattern reduced JSON marshaling allocations by 76% in a message queue I optimized last quarter. The channel acts as a fixed-size reservoir for byte slices.  </p><p><p>\nProper field alignment reduces wasted space. Consider this optimized struct:</p></p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Without padding, Go would insert 7 bytes between  and . For slice-heavy workflows, I preallocate:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Resetting with  preserves capacity across iterations.  </p><p><p>\nImplementing these techniques in a payment processing system yielded:  </p></p><ul><li>73% fewer heap allocations\n</li><li>GC pauses under 0.5ms during 45K RPS loads\n</li><li>3.2x throughput increase on same hardware\n</li><li>58% reduction in memory usage\n</li></ul><p>The graph below shows GC pause times before and after optimization:<a href=\"https://dev.to/aaravjoshi/golang-memory-optimization-reduce-gc-pauses-by-73-in-high-load-applications-3ako\"></a></p><div><pre><code>go mem.out\ngo tool pprof  mem.out\n</code></pre></div><p>Focus on allocation-heavy paths first. When implementing pools:  </p><ol><li>Size pools to 110-120% of peak concurrent requests\n</li><li>Add metrics to track pool hits/misses\n</li><li>Implement fallback to standard allocation during bursts\n</li></ol><ul><li>Replace pointer receivers with values for small structs\n</li><li>Avoid interfaces in hot paths\n</li><li>Localize variables in tight loops\n</li></ul><p><strong>Production Considerations</strong><p>\nMonitoring is crucial. I expose pool metrics like:</p></p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><div><pre><code>50  4GiB </code></pre></div><p>For specialized cases, consider cgo allocators:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><ul><li>Trading systems where 100Œºs latency matters\n</li><li>Real-time analytics processing TBs/hour\n</li><li>API gateways serving 100K+ RPS\n</li></ul><p>In a recent cybersecurity project, these optimizations handled 2.3 million log entries/second per node. The key was combining sync.Pool for parsed objects with arena-allocated byte buffers for raw data.  </p><p><p>\nMemory optimization in Go isn't about fighting the language‚Äîit's about cooperating with the runtime. Start with clean code, profile relentlessly, then apply surgical optimizations. The techniques shown here reduced GC overhead to under 1% of CPU in my most demanding deployments. Remember: premature optimization is counterproductive, but strategic memory management at scale separates functional systems from exceptional ones.</p></p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><h2>\n  \n  \n  The path to low-latency Go systems lies in respecting allocations‚Äînot eliminating them entirely, but controlling when and how they occur.

The sweaty palms, the racing thoughts, wondering if you'll blank out when asked to implement a binary tree? Yeah, I've been there too. That's exactly why I built the AI Interview Simulation feature for Go Interview Practice ‚Äì and honestly, it's been a game-changer for so many developers (myself included!).</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  The Problem: Interview Anxiety is Real\n</h2><p>Let's be honest ‚Äì coding interviews are nerve-wracking. You might be a brilliant developer who ships features daily, but put you in front of a whiteboard (or shared screen) with a stranger watching your every keystroke, and suddenly your brain turns to mush.</p><p>I realized this when I was helping a friend prepare for their dream job at a Go-heavy startup. They knew the language inside and out, had built amazing projects, but kept freezing up during mock interviews. The problem wasn't their technical skills ‚Äì it was the pressure and unpredictability of the interview environment.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Enter AI: Your Non-Judgmental Interview Partner\n</h2><p>That's when I had a lightbulb moment: What if we could simulate real interview conditions, but with an AI that never gets impatient, never judges you, and can adapt to your pace?</p><p>The AI Interview Simulation feature does exactly that. Here's what makes it special:</p><p>The AI watches your code as you write it and gives instant feedback ‚Äì just like a real interviewer would. It might say something like:</p><blockquote><p><em>\"I notice you're using a brute force approach. Can you think of a way to optimize this using Go's built-in data structures?\"</em></p></blockquote><p>It's not trying to trip you up; it's genuinely helping you think through the problem like a supportive interviewer would.</p><h3><strong>Dynamic Follow-Up Questions</strong> üéØ\n</h3><p>This is where it gets really cool. The AI doesn't just stick to a script. If you mention goroutines, it might ask about concurrency patterns. If you use a map, it could dive into time complexity. It adapts to YOUR code and YOUR approach.</p><p>I remember one user told me: <em>\"It felt like talking to a senior developer who actually wanted me to succeed.\"</em> That's exactly the vibe we were going for!</p><h3><strong>Timed Sessions with Gentle Pressure</strong> ‚è∞\n</h3><p>Real interviews have time constraints, so our AI does too. But here's the thing ‚Äì it's not trying to stress you out. If you're struggling, it might say:</p><blockquote><p><em>\"Take your time. Let's think about this step by step. What's the first thing we need to figure out?\"</em></p></blockquote><p>It maintains interview realism while being genuinely supportive.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Three AI Flavors for Different Styles\n</h2><p>We integrated with three different AI providers because, let's face it, different people click with different communication styles:</p><p><em>Recommended for Go analysis</em></p><p>Gemini has this knack for understanding Go idioms and best practices. It'll catch things like unnecessary pointer usage or suggest more idiomatic ways to handle errors. Plus, it's free to get started, which is awesome for students and junior devs.</p><p><em>For detailed explanations</em></p><p>GPT-4 is fantastic at breaking down complex problems into digestible chunks. If you're stuck on a graph algorithm, it'll walk you through the approach step by step, almost like having a patient mentor sitting next to you.</p><p><em>Thoughtful and nuanced feedback</em></p><p>Claude tends to give more nuanced feedback about code design and architecture. It's great for more senior developers who want to discuss trade-offs and design decisions.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  The Magic is in the Iteration\n</h2><p>Here's what I love most about this feature: you can fail safely. Make a mistake? The AI points it out gently and helps you learn from it. Completely blank out? No problem ‚Äì run another session tomorrow.</p><p>One user told me they did the same algorithm challenge five times with the AI, each time getting better feedback and understanding the problem more deeply. Try doing that with a human interviewer! üòÖ</p><p>The AI doesn't just focus on getting the right answer. It evaluates:</p><ul><li> your thought process</li><li><strong>Whether you ask clarifying questions</strong> (super important!)</li><li><strong>How you handle hints and feedback</strong></li><li><strong>Your approach to testing and edge cases</strong></li></ul><p>These soft skills are huge in real interviews, but they're often overlooked in traditional practice platforms.</p><p>If you're preparing for Go interviews (or just want to level up your skills), I'd love for you to try the AI Interview Simulation. It's completely free, runs in your browser, and you can practice as much as you want.</p><p>The goal isn't to make interviews easy ‚Äì it's to make you confident. When you walk into that real interview room, you'll have already experienced the pressure, practiced thinking out loud, and gotten comfortable with being challenged on your code.</p><p>Plus, even if you're not interviewing right now, it's a fantastic way to get feedback on your Go skills from an AI that's available 24/7 and never gets tired of your questions.</p><p>Building this feature taught me something important: the best interview preparation isn't about memorizing algorithms (though that helps). It's about getting comfortable with the process, learning to communicate your thinking, and building the confidence to tackle problems you haven't seen before.</p><p>The AI Interview Simulation gives you a safe space to build all of that. And honestly? It's kind of fun once you get into it. There's something satisfying about having a thoughtful conversation about code with an AI that's genuinely trying to help you improve.</p><p>Give it a shot, and let me know how it goes! I'm always looking for feedback and ways to make the experience even better.</p><p><strong>What's your biggest interview fear?

Among dynamic programming challenges, the coin change problems are some of the trickiest to keep a solid grip on‚Äîthey seem simple at first but are easy to forget. In this article, I‚Äôll break down these problems in a way that helps others approach them with confidence, while also reinforcing my own understanding so the logic sticks more firmly the next time I encounter them.</p>\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  The Coin Change I Problem\n</h2>\n\n<p>The coin change I problem asks the minimum number of coins to reach the requested amount. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>You are given an integer array coins representing coins of different denominations and an integer amount representing a total amount of money. Return the fewest number of coins that you need to make up that amount. If that amount of money cannot be made up by any combination of the coins, return -1. You may assume that you have an infinite number of each kind of coin.</p>\n\n<p>Example 1:<br>\nInput: coins = [1,2,5], amount = 11, Output: 3, Explanation: 11 = 5 + 5 + 1</p>\n\n<p>Example 2:<br>\nInput: coins = [2], amount = 3, Output: -1</p>\n\n<p>Example 3:<br>\nInput: coins = [1], amount = 0, Output: 0</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>While recursive solutions tend to be more intuitive, the tabulation method offers better readability - which is important to help readers understand. </p>\n\n<p>The idea behind the solution is to keep track of the minimum number of coins to make up all the possible remainders up to the requested amount. Intuitively, when we understand that the objective is minimization, we can set a default value of minimum number of coins for each remainder as infinity. Using python, this is as simple as using the <code>float('inf')</code> number.<br>\n</p>\n\n<div class=\"highlight js-code-highlight\">\n<pre class=\"highlight python\"><code><span class=\"k\">class</span> <span class=\"nc\">Solution</span><span class=\"p\">:</span>\n    <span class=\"k\">def</span> <span class=\"nf\">coinChange</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">self</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"n\">coins</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"n\">List</span><span class=\"p\">[</span><span class=\"nb\">int</span><span class=\"p\">],</span> <span class=\"n\">amount</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"nb\">int</span><span class=\"p\">)</span> <span class=\"o\">-&gt;</span> <span class=\"nb\">int</span><span class=\"p\">:</span>\n      <span class=\"n\">dp</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"p\">[</span><span class=\"nf\">float</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"sh\">'</span><span class=\"s\">inf</span><span class=\"sh\">'</span><span class=\"p\">)]</span> <span class=\"o\">*</span> <span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">amount</span> <span class=\"o\">+</span> <span class=\"mi\">1</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n      <span class=\"c1\"># ...\n</span></code></pre>\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>In the code snippet above, we can see we're initializing an array filled with the number infinity for all its members. The size of the array is intentionally set as <code>amount + 1</code> to leave a space for the index 0 and leaving the rest of the indices idiomatic representation of the remainders. This means when we want to access the minimum number of coins for a given remainder, we can simply fetch them using the remainder number as their indices.<br>\n</p>\n\n<div class=\"highlight js-code-highlight\">\n<pre class=\"highlight python\"><code>      <span class=\"c1\"># ...\n</span>      <span class=\"n\">dp</span><span class=\"p\">[</span><span class=\"mi\">0</span><span class=\"p\">]</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"mi\">0</span>\n      <span class=\"c1\"># [0, inf, inf, inf, ...]\n</span>      <span class=\"c1\"># ...\n</span></code></pre>\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>Next, we want to manually set the minimum number of coins to achieve 0 remainder as 0.

We can start to loop over and compute the minimum number of coins for all the possible remainders, from the smallest up until the requested amount. The logic behind the computation process involves: </p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>checking for each coin whether the coin is applicable for the given remainder. This means, the coin cannot be greater than the remainder otherwise it won't make up the remainder at all. </li>\n<li>revising the minimum number of coins for the given remainder if a smaller number of coins can make up the same amount. This step includes comparing the previous minimum number of coins and the new candidate.\n</li>\n</ol>\n\n<div class=\"highlight js-code-highlight\">\n<pre class=\"highlight python\"><code>      <span class=\"c1\"># ...\n</span>      <span class=\"k\">if</span> <span class=\"n\">dp</span><span class=\"p\">[</span><span class=\"n\">amount</span><span class=\"p\">]</span> <span class=\"o\">==</span> <span class=\"nf\">float</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"sh\">'</span><span class=\"s\">inf</span><span class=\"sh\">'</span><span class=\"p\">):</span>\n        <span class=\"k\">return</span> <span class=\"o\">-</span><span class=\"mi\">1</span>\n      <span class=\"k\">return</span> <span class=\"n\">dp</span><span class=\"p\">[</span><span class=\"n\">amount</span><span class=\"p\">]</span>\n</code></pre>\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>Ultimately, even the requested amount is treated as a remainder. For our solution to yield its answer, we can simply get the last member of the remainder minimum coins count array. However, there's still a chance that the requested amount cannot be constructed by any combination of the given coins. To handle this, we simply check whether the final answer is indeed anything smaller than infinity.</p>\n\n<p>The following displays the full solution.<br>\n</p>\n\n<div class=\"highlight js-code-highlight\">\n<pre class=\"highlight python\"><code><span class=\"k\">class</span> <span class=\"nc\">Solution</span><span class=\"p\">:</span>\n    <span class=\"k\">def</span> <span class=\"nf\">coinChange</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">self</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"n\">coins</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"n\">List</span><span class=\"p\">[</span><span class=\"nb\">int</span><span class=\"p\">],</span> <span class=\"n\">amount</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"nb\">int</span><span class=\"p\">)</span> <span class=\"o\">-&gt;</span> <span class=\"nb\">int</span><span class=\"p\">:</span>\n        <span class=\"n\">dp</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"p\">[</span><span class=\"nf\">float</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"sh\">'</span><span class=\"s\">inf</span><span class=\"sh\">'</span><span class=\"p\">)]</span> <span class=\"o\">*</span> <span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">amount</span> <span class=\"o\">+</span> <span class=\"mi\">1</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n        <span class=\"n\">dp</span><span class=\"p\">[</span><span class=\"mi\">0</span><span class=\"p\">]</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"mi\">0</span>\n\n        <span class=\"k\">for</span> <span class=\"n\">i</span> <span class=\"ow\">in</span> <span class=\"nf\">range</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"mi\">1</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"n\">amount</span><span class=\"o\">+</span><span class=\"mi\">1</span><span class=\"p\">):</span>\n            <span class=\"k\">for</span> <span class=\"n\">coin</span> <span class=\"ow\">in</span> <span class=\"n\">coins</span><span class=\"p\">:</span>\n                <span class=\"k\">if</span> <span class=\"n\">coin</span> <span class=\"o\">&gt;</span> <span class=\"n\">i</span><span class=\"p\">:</span>\n                  <span class=\"c1\"># skip if coin is larger than the remainder\n</span>                  <span class=\"k\">continue</span>\n                <span class=\"n\">candidate_min_coins</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"mi\">1</span> <span class=\"o\">+</span> <span class=\"n\">dp</span><span class=\"p\">[</span><span class=\"n\">i</span> <span class=\"o\">-</span> <span class=\"n\">coin</span><span class=\"p\">]</span>\n                <span class=\"c1\"># compare the previous minimum with candidate\n</span>                <span class=\"n\">dp</span><span class=\"p\">[</span><span class=\"n\">i</span><span class=\"p\">]</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"nf\">min</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">dp</span><span class=\"p\">[</span><span class=\"n\">i</span><span class=\"p\">],</span> <span class=\"n\">candidate_min_coins</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n\n        <span class=\"k\">if</span> <span class=\"n\">dp</span><span class=\"p\">[</span><span class=\"o\">-</span><span class=\"mi\">1</span><span class=\"p\">]</span> <span class=\"o\">==</span> <span class=\"nf\">float</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"sh\">'</span><span class=\"s\">inf</span><span class=\"sh\">'</span><span class=\"p\">):</span>\n            <span class=\"k\">return</span> <span class=\"o\">-</span><span class=\"mi\">1</span>\n        <span class=\"k\">return</span> <span class=\"n\">dp</span><span class=\"p\">[</span><span class=\"o\">-</span><span class=\"mi\">1</span><span class=\"p\">]</span>\n</code></pre>\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  The Coin Change II Problem\n</h2>\n\n<p>The coin change II problem asks the number of ways to make up an amount using the given coins.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>You are given an integer array coins representing coins of different denominations and an integer amount representing a total amount of money.

However, this time, we keep a record of the number of ways to make up all possible remainders. The number of ways to make up the smaller remainders determine the same for the larger ones. </p>\n\n<p>We start the solution by initializing default values for the number of ways to make up all possible remainders.

In this article, we‚Äôll explore 7 key differences between SQL and NoSQL databases to help you decide which is best for your project.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Data Model</strong></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>The data model defines how data is stored, organized, and related.</p>\n\n<p>SQL</p>\n\n<p>SQL databases use a relational data model where data is stored in tables (rows and columns). Each table has a primary key to uniquely identify records and foreign keys to link tables, enabling relational queries.</p>\n\n<p>Example: In a boots ordering system, you might have Customers and Orders tables. The CustomerID in the Orders table is a foreign key referencing the Customers table, allowing complex joins.</p>\n\n<p>This structured approach is ideal for applications requiring complex queries and relationships.</p>\n\n<p>NoSQL</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>NoSQL databases use flexible, non-relational data models. Common types include:</p></li>\n<li><p>Key-Value Model (e.g., Redis): Data is stored as key-value pairs for fast lookups.<br>\n</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<div class=\"highlight js-code-highlight\">\n<pre class=\"highlight plaintext\"><code>Key: 1\nValue: { \"name\": \"Palmer\", \"email\": \"palmer@email.com\", \"age\": 24 }\n</code></pre>\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>Document Model (e.g., MongoDB): Data is stored as JSON/BSON documents with flexible structures.<br>\n</p>\n\n<div class=\"highlight js-code-highlight\">\n<pre class=\"highlight plaintext\"><code>{\n  \"_id\": 1,\n  \"name\": \"Palmer\",\n  \"email\": \"palmer@email.com\",\n  \"age\": 24,\n  \"orders\": [\n    { \"orderId\": 101, \"product\": \"Football Boots\", \"price\": 1200 },\n    { \"orderId\": 104, \"product\": \"Hiking Boots\", \"price\": 800 }\n  ]\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>Column-Family Model (e.g., Cassandra):</strong> Rows have variable columns, optimized for large-scale distributed storage.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Graph Model (e.g., Neo4j):</strong> Data is stored as nodes and edges, ideal for complex relationships like social networks. Example:<br>\n</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<div class=\"highlight js-code-highlight\">\n<pre class=\"highlight plaintext\"><code>Nodes: Customers, Orders\nEdges: PLACED_ORDER\n(Palmer) --PLACED_ORDER--&gt; (Football Boots)\n(Caicedo) --PLACED_ORDER--&gt; (Running shoes)\n\n</code></pre>\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>NoSQL‚Äôs flexibility suits applications with varied data structures.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Schema</strong></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>SQL</p>\n\n<p>SQL databases require a fixed schema defined upfront. Tables have specific columns, data types, and constraints, ensuring data integrity but making schema changes (e.g., adding a column) complex.</p>\n\n<p>Example:<br>\n</p>\n\n<div class=\"highlight js-code-highlight\">\n<pre class=\"highlight plaintext\"><code>CREATE TABLE Customers (\n    CustomerID INT PRIMARY KEY,\n    Name VARCHAR(100),\n    Email VARCHAR(100),\n    Age INT\n);\nALTER TABLE Customers ADD COLUMN Address VARCHAR(255);\n</code></pre>\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>NoSQL</p>\n\n<p>NoSQL databases are schema-less or dynamic, allowing records to have different attributes without predefined structures. This makes them ideal for evolving data needs.</p>\n\n<p>Example (MongoDB):<br>\n</p>\n\n<div class=\"highlight js-code-highlight\">\n<pre class=\"highlight plaintext\"><code>{\n    \"_id\": 3,\n    \"name\": \"Caicedo\",\n    \"email\": \"caicedo@email.com\",\n    \"age\": 26,\n    \"orders\": [{ \"orderId\": 103, \"product\": \"running Boots\", \"price\": 150 }],\n    \"loyaltyPoints\": 500\n}\n\n</code></pre>\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>Here, loyaltyPoints is added to one document without affecting others.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Scalability</strong></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>SQL</p>\n\n<p>SQL databases scale vertically by adding more resources (CPU, RAM) to a single server. This works for moderate loads but can be costly and limited at scale due to ACID compliance.</p>\n\n<p>NoSQL</p>\n\n<p>NoSQL databases scale horizontally by adding servers to a distributed system. This enables handling massive data volumes and high traffic efficiently.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Query Language</strong></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>SQL</p>\n\n<p>SQL databases use Structured Query Language (SQL), a standardized, declarative language for complex queries, joins, and aggregations.</p>\n\n<p>Example:<br>\n</p>\n\n<div class=\"highlight js-code-highlight\">\n<pre class=\"highlight plaintext\"><code>SELECT Customers.Name, Customers.Email, Orders.Product, Orders.Price\nFROM Customers\nJOIN Orders ON Customers.CustomerID = Orders.CustomerID\nWHERE Customers.Age &gt; 25;\n\n</code></pre>\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>NoSQL</p>\n\n<p>NoSQL databases use database-specific query languages or APIs. For example, MongoDB uses JSON-like queries:<br>\n</p>\n\n<div class=\"highlight js-code-highlight\">\n<pre class=\"highlight plaintext\"><code>db.Customers.find(\n    { \"age\": { $gt: 25 } },\n    { \"name\": 1, \"email\": 1, \"orders.product\": 1, \"orders.price\": 1 }\n);\n</code></pre>\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>Graph databases like Neo4j use languages like Cypher:<br>\n</p>\n\n<div class=\"highlight js-code-highlight\">\n<pre class=\"highlight plaintext\"><code>MATCH (c:Customer)-[:PLACED_ORDER]-&gt;(o:Order)\nWHERE c.age &gt; 25\nRETURN c.name, o.product, o.price;\n</code></pre>\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Transaction Support</strong></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>SQL</p>\n\n<p>SQL databases support ACID transactions (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability), ensuring reliable and consistent operations, ideal for applications like banking.</p>\n\n<p>Example:<br>\n</p>\n\n<div class=\"highlight js-code-highlight\">\n<pre class=\"highlight plaintext\"><code>START TRANSACTION;\nUPDATE Accounts SET balance = balance - 500 WHERE customer_id = 'Palmer';\nUPDATE Accounts SET balance = balance + 500 WHERE customer_id = 'Caicedo';\nCOMMIT;\n</code></pre>\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>NoSQL</p>\n\n<p>NoSQL databases often follow the BASE model (Basically Available, Soft state, Eventually consistent), prioritizing availability and scalability over immediate consistency. Some offer limited ACID-like features.</p>\n\n<p>Example (Cassandra):<br>\n</p>\n\n<div class=\"highlight js-code-highlight\">\n<pre class=\"highlight plaintext\"><code>BEGIN TRANSACTION;\nUPDATE Customers SET balance = balance - 500 WHERE customer_id = 'Palmer' IF balance &gt;= 500;\nUPDATE Customers SET balance = balance + 500 WHERE customer_id = 'Caicedo';\nAPPLY BATCH;\n\n</code></pre>\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Performance</strong></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>SQL</p>\n\n<p>SQL databases excel in complex queries and small datasets but may struggle with write-intensive operations or large-scale data without optimization.</p>\n\n<p>NoSQL</p>\n\n<p>NoSQL databases are optimized for high-performance reads/writes at scale, leveraging denormalized data and eventual consistency for faster operations.</p>\n\n<p>NoSQL</p>\n\n<p>NoSQL databases are optimized for high-performance reads/writes at scale, leveraging denormalized data and eventual consistency for faster operations.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Use Cases</strong></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>SQL</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Structured data with fixed schemas.</p></li>\n<li><p>Complex queries and transactions.</p></li>\n<li><p>Industries: Finance, healthcare, government.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>NoSQL</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Unstructured/semi-structured data.</p></li>\n<li><p>High scalability and performance.</p></li>\n<li><p>Industries: Social media, IoT, big data analytics.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Conclusion</p>\n\n<p>SQL databases are best for structured data, complex queries, and strong consistency, while NoSQL databases excel in scalability, flexibility, and handling unstructured data.

The exploration mostly focuses on building smart tooling to improve and automate repetitive tasks. This journey has forced me to delve deep into AI and strive to understand even more advanced and complex AI concepts. This has been going incredibly well, and I've learned valuable lessons about the power of context-aware agents.</p><p>A few months ago, I started designing and developing a smarter email agent that can handle the following tasks perfectly:</p><ul><li>Responding to emails from colleagues in a natural, human-like manner</li><li>Accepting or rejecting meeting invites intelligently (yes, my inbox gets full really quickly due to having it tied to work, test, and dev environments, all of which send out lots of emails daily)</li><li>Summarizing what has been accomplished on a daily basis and emailing it to me as a daily digest</li></ul><p>The motivation behind this project was simple: I was spending too much time on routine email management when I could be focusing on more strategic work. What started as a straightforward automation task quickly evolved into a fascinating exploration of how context and intelligence can transform simple agents into truly smart assistants.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  The First Iteration: A Simple Approach\n</h2><p>This sounds like a pretty simple task with the availability of email APIs and webhook events. So I thought too, and I started building out the code. The initial design focused on:</p><ul><li>Registering and listening to webhook events for new emails received:</li><li>The agent needs to be able to read the content and determine if an email is a meeting invite or a communication email with a message. The agent needs to be able to take appropriate action:\n (1) If it's an invite: accept or reject the invite based on predefined rules.\n (2) If it's an email with a message: respond to the email in the most human-like way possible.</li><li>Record every action taken (accept/reject invites and responses to emails) and share a summary by the end of the day.</li></ul><p>Here's the core implementation of the first version:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><h2>\n  \n  \n  The Reality Check: Limitations of the First Version\n</h2><p>So this works just fine. It serves the objective as expected‚Äîhelping me automate those repetitive tasks. However, there were a few key observations after deploying this first version that made me realize the agent wasn't as \"smart\" as I had hoped:</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Problem 1: Blind Invitation Acceptance\n</h3><p>The agent blindly accepts any invite that comes in. Right, that's not so smart. I need it to accept an invite only if it's within working hours and I'm available on the specified date. Otherwise, it should reject the invite and reply with a message citing my unavailability.</p><p> Without context about my schedule, the agent was essentially a \"yes-man\" that would overbook my calendar and accept conflicting meetings.</p><p> The agent needs access to my calendar system. This is where the concept of context becomes crucial. The agent needs contextual awareness of my availability to handle this task intelligently. This means integrating with calendar APIs (Google Calendar, Outlook, etc.) and implementing logic to:</p><ul><li>Check for existing conflicts</li><li>Respect working hours and time zones</li><li>Consider buffer time between meetings</li><li>Handle recurring meetings appropriately</li></ul><h3>\n  \n  \n  Problem 2: Generic Communication Style\n</h3><p>The agent exhibits the same tone in all its replies. While this works functionally, I wanted something more sophisticated. I wanted the replies to feel human and be driven by past exchanges. How you respond to a colleague is slightly different from how you would respond to the VP of Engineering, if you understand what I mean.</p><p> The agent lacked emotional intelligence and relationship context, making all interactions feel robotic and impersonal.</p><p> Enable the agent to access past conversations I've had (if any) with the email sender, analyze the tone and formality level used in those exchanges, and craft responses that match the established communication pattern. This requires:</p><ul><li>Tone detection and classification</li><li>Relationship mapping (colleague, manager, external partner, etc.)</li><li>Context-aware response generation</li></ul><p>If we examine the two problems outlined above, it becomes crystal clear that the advantages we get when we empower our agents with substantial context and tools far exceed what they can achieve with limited context. With this realization, I started working on version 2 of the tool, equipped with the solutions explained above.</p><p>The key insight here is that  when building intelligent agents. Without context, you have automation. With context, you have intelligence.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Version 2: The Context-Aware Smart Agent\n</h2><p>Let's take a look at an advanced version of what we had earlier. This iteration incorporates calendar integration and conversation history analysis:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><h3>\n  \n  \n  Key Improvements in Version 2\n</h3><ol><li><strong>Provider-Based Architecture</strong>: Uses clean interfaces (CalendarProvider, EmailHistoryProvider, etc.) to separate concerns and enable easy testing with stub implementations</li><li>: Supports both OpenAI and Anthropic models through the langchaingo library, allowing easy switching between providers</li><li>: Gathers contextual information from multiple sources (calendar, email history, meeting notes, contacts) before generating responses</li><li>: Uses a well-formatted prompt template that clearly organizes context and instructions for consistent, high-quality responses</li><li><strong>Concise Response Generation</strong>: Built-in constraints (120-word limit, specific formatting) ensure responses are professional and actionable</li><li>: The interface-based approach makes it easy to add new context providers or replace stub implementations with real integrations</li></ol><p>Through building this smart email agent, I've learned several crucial lessons about developing intelligent systems:</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  1. Contextual Awareness Drives Intelligence\n</h3><p>What separates basic automation from genuine intelligence is the depth of contextual information available to the system. By incorporating calendar integration, historical communication patterns, and relationship dynamics, I transformed a rudimentary email processor into a sophisticated digital assistant.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  2. Interface-Driven Design Enables Flexibility\n</h3><p>Using provider interfaces instead of concrete implementations made the system incredibly flexible. I could start with simple stub implementations for rapid prototyping, then gradually replace them with real integrations. This approach also made testing much easier since I could mock individual components.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  3. Structured Prompting Yields Consistent Results\n</h3><p>The key to reliable AI responses wasn't just having good context‚Äîit was organizing that context in a clear, structured format. The prompt template with distinct sections (email content, recipient details, calendar info, instructions) produced much more consistent and useful responses than ad-hoc prompting.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  4. LLM Provider Abstraction is Valuable\n</h3><p>Supporting multiple LLM providers (OpenAI, Anthropic) through a common interface proved invaluable. Different models have different strengths, and being able to switch providers based on cost, performance, or availability requirements without changing the core logic was a significant advantage.</p><p>LLMs are very powerful, and with well-crafted prompts, you will get the best out of them. However, empowering your agents with access to tools and context makes them super powerful, smart, and capable of handling complex tasks that go far beyond simple text generation.</p><p>The journey from a basic email responder to a context-aware intelligent agent illustrates a fundamental principle in AI development: <strong>intelligence emerges from the intersection of powerful models and rich context</strong>. As we continue to build more sophisticated AI systems, the focus should not just be on better models, but on better ways to provide those models with the context and tools they need to be truly helpful.</p><p>The future of AI agents lies not in replacing human intelligence, but in augmenting it with systems that understand context, maintain relationships, and can act intelligently on our behalf while preserving the nuance and personality that makes human communication meaningful.</p>","contentLength":8155,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Basico de

(par√¢metros).</p>\n\n<p>Usar estruturas de repeti√ß√£o para percorrer dicion√°rios.</p>\n\n<p>Aplicar condi√ß√µes l√≥gicas para tomar decis√µes.</p>\n\n<p>Esse √© um √≥timo passo para quem est√° come√ßando em Python, e pode ser expandido para outras situa√ß√µes, como:</p>\n\n<p>Calcular a m√©dia de uma turma inteira.</p>\n\n<p>Salvar resultados em arquivos.</p>\n\n<p>Criar um sistema simples de boletim.</p>\n\n<p>üëâ Dica: Sempre que voc√™ aprender algo novo, tente transformar em um exemplo pr√°tico, assim como fizemos aqui. Isso ajuda muito a fixar a l√≥gica de programa√ß√£o!</p>\n\n<p>üí¨ E voc√™, como faria para melhorar essa fun√ß√£o? Talvez usando len(nota) no lugar de dividir por 4?
