I had WiFi, sound, usb, webcam, memory card reader, correct screen resolution. I even got battery status and management! It even came with a nice litte 'app center' making installation of a bunch of software as simple as a click!</p><p>And I remember thinking any Windows user could  install Linux and would get comfortable using it in an afternoon.</p><p>I'm pretty 'comfortable' in anything PC and have changed boot orders and created bootable things since the early 90's and considered that part of the installation the easiest part.</p><p>However, most people have never heard about any of them, and that makes the two steps seem 'impossible'.</p><p>I recently convinced a friend of mine, who also couldn't stand Window11, to install Linux instead as it would easily cover all his PC needs. </p><p>And while he is definitely in the upper half of people in terms of 'tech savvyness', both those \"two easy first steps\" made it virtually impossible for him to install it. </p><p>He easily managed downloading the .iso, but turning that iso into a bootable USB-stick turned out to be too difficult. But after guiding him over the phone he was able to create it.</p><p>But he wasn't able to get into bios despite all my attempts explaining what button to push and when</p><p>Next day he came over with his laptop. And just out of reflex I just started smashing the F2 key (or whatever it was) repeatingly and got right into bios where I enabled USB boot and put it at the top at the sequence.</p><p>After that he managed to install Linux just fine without my supervision.</p><p>But it made me realise that the two first steps in installing Linux, that are second nature to me and probably everyone involved with Linux from people just using it to people working on huge distributions, makes them virtually impossible for most people to install it.</p><p>I don't know enough about programming to know of this is possible:</p><p>Instead of an .iso file for download some sort of .exe file can be downloaded that is able to create a bootable USB-stick and change the boot order?</p><p>That would 'open up' Linux to  more people, probably orders of magnitude..</p>","contentLength":2460,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"what was the Linux expirance like in the 90's and 00's?","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/1ipql9k/what_was_the_linux_expirance_like_in_the_90s_and/","date":1739583310,"author":"/u/mrcrabs6464","guid":570,"unread":true,"content":"<div><p>I started using Linux about 2 years ago really right at the beginning of the proton revolution.
