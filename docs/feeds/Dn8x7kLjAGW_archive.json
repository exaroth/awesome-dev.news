Software engineer Flavia Circiumaru and host Hannes Lowette dive deep into how this London-based regulatory compliance company transformed from a support-free-for-all to a streamlined powerhouse.\n\nFlavia Circiumaru reveals the behind-the-scenes story of building a three-desk support system that turned their support team into the ultimate connector, bridging customers, developers, and business teams like never before. From battling context-switching nightmares to creating communication magic, Flavia and Hannes explore actionable insights on scaling support without losing your sanity.\n\nThe twist? Their ultimate goal is to make support so seamless that dedicated teams won't even be needed.

It so perfectly models the problem at hand that even a trained house cat could generate business value. You just have one problem, your interpreter runs 100x slower than a shell script launching JVMs in a loop.\n\n#DomainSpecificLanguages (DSLs) are able to offer the abstraction benefits of a high-level language, while when compiled, competing with low-level languages on performance. Because DSLs have a much smaller problem area, many specialised optimisations can be performed which are not feasible for a general purpose language.\n\nIn this talk, we will explain a number of optimisations which are useful for DSLs, and show our solutions to the practical issues we faced when implementing them in our #QueryLanguage, #Icicle.\n\nIcicle is a query language for processing large amounts of time-series data. Its type system enforces that queries require only a single pass over the data, and that multiple queries over the same data can be fused together. By using a combination of high level optimisations such as partial evaluation and common subexpression elimination, and low level optimisations such as parsing code which is specialised for the given input, our queries are faster than the equivalent hand-written C code.\n\nFrom this talk, the audience will learn how the focused point of view that DSLs provide can be useful in performance critical systems, as well as a number of concrete techniques for optimising their own DSLs.\n\nRECOMMENDED BOOKS\nKenneth E.

At a conference, an attendee noticed that my badge said \"architect\" and told me \"I want to be an architect too, but I don't know enough about Kubernetes yet\".\n\nArchitecture, in the systems age, is not (just) Kubernetes. It's not the implementation of any particular toolset. Architecture is designing relationships between parts and adapting those relationship patterns as circumstances change. This requires engaging our mental models and working together to transform them.\n\nThe architecture skillset is socio-technical -- a blend of social and technology skills. It is a way of thinking and communicating. In the modern age, there is no division between the way we think together and the code running in production. Our thinking designs our architecture.\n\nArchitecture is structuring good systems thinking.\n\nIn this talk, I will admit that sometimes architecture is Kubernetes. And share five essential qualities that make a good architect a great architect, regardless of the toolset they employ.
