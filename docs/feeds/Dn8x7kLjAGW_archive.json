You’ll learn the counter-intuitive concepts hidden in the term and why really using them is so hard. You’ll learn about techniques that will ultimately help you find smaller successful releases, test your ideas faster, develop higher quality software more predictably, and release more confidently than ever before. Because hidden in this nasty little term are clues that can help you do all that.\n\nJeff Patton helps companies adopt a way of working that’s focused on building great products, not just building stuff faster. Jeff blends a mixture of Agile thinking, Lean and Lean Startup Thinking, and UX Design and Design Thinking to end up with a holistic product-centric way of working. Jeff is author of the bestselling O’Reilly book User Story Mapping which describes a simple holistic approach to using stories in Agile development without losing sight of the big picture.

But don't just throw on a chatbot and call it done, as people may not even use it. Let's explore how language models can integrate into your existing web UIs, anticipating your users' needs and completing their tasks faster.\n\nWhile this is a technical, demo-centric talk, it isn't about how LLMs or transformers work internally, nor just how to use Open AI SDKs from a particular language. Instead, it focuses on practical, end-to-end uses for AI in web apps, making your users happier and more productive. [...]\n\nTIMECODES\n00:00 Intro\n01:15 Useful\n03:58 1.

It is often lauded for its approach to memory safety, particularly through making previously implicit concepts like data ownership explicit. On top of it comes a powerful reference validation system, the borrow checker.\n\nHowever, Rust is often reduced to those two concepts. This talk will give an accessible overview to using Rust core principles - Ownership and Borrowing - together with other, lesser known concepts of the language to build safe and efficient APIs.\n\nFor Rust practicioners, this talk gives insight into known concepts in more detail. It does so by looking at examples from the Rust standard library first and foremost. For people who don't practice Rust regularly, it gives an insight into properties of the language that are less spoken about.

However, for this discussion, we will focus on designing a  that is integrated into or called by  directly.</p></blockquote><h2>3.1 Single-Node Rate Limiting</h2><p>For small-scale applications with <strong>low traffic and a single application server</strong>, rate limiting can be implemented entirely , without relying on external systems like Redis. This approach is lightweight, fast, and easy to set up.</p><p>You maintain a simple  in the application process where:</p><ul><li><p> represent client identifiers (e.g., user ID, API key, or IP address)</p></li><li><p> represent request counts within the current time window</p></li></ul><p>For each incoming request:</p><ol><li><p>Checks if the user exists in the map</p></li><li><p>If not, create a new entry with a count of 1</p></li><li><p>If the user exists, increments their counter</p></li><li><p>Compare the count against the defined rate limit</p></li><li><p>If the count is within the limit, allow the request; otherwise, reject it</p></li></ol><p>You can also add a time-based mechanism (e.g., timestamps or TTL logic) to reset counters after each time window.</p><p>Despite its simplicity, this approach comes with  that make it unsuitable for production environments at scale:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Single Point of Failure (SPOF): </strong>If the server crashes, all in-memory counters are lost. After a restart, the system \"forgets\" users' recent request history potentially allowing them to exceed their limits until the counters rebuild.</p></li><li><p><strong>No Horizontal Scalability: </strong>The rate limiter lives on a so it doesn’t scale with traffic.</p></li><li><p>Without proper eviction or TTL logic, memory usage can grow unbounded over time, especially if you're tracking many users or long-duration windows.</p></li></ol><p>Now, lets explore two common strategies to implement rate limiting in a distributed environment.</p><h2>3.2 Distributed Rate Limiting</h2>","contentLength":5166,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F92234a57-99c1-41af-9d3c-91a4c045c413_1188x902.png","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Cofun with Cofree Comonads • David Laing • YOW! 2015","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddaxlm6ajhI","date":1749988868,"author":"GOTO Conferences","guid":155565,"unread":true,"content":"<article>This presentation was recorded at YOW! 2015. #GOTOcon #YOW\nhttps://yowcon.com\n\nDavid Laing - Senior Software Engineer at Skedulo\n\nRESOURCES\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/in/david-laing\nhttp://comonad.com/reader/2008/the-cofree-comonad-and-the-expression-problem\nhttp://blog.sigfpe.com/2014/05/cofree-meets-free.html\n\nRECOMMENDED BOOKS\nEdsger W.
