He explains how uncertainty defines the architect's role and introduces residuality‚Äîa method where architects deliberately stress their conceptual models until they collapse, then optimize the resulting \"residues\" or leftovers to create more resilient systems.\n\nUnlike traditional software engineering approaches, that try to eliminate uncertainty through rigid requirements, residuality embraces random stressors (even far-fetched scenarios like giant lizards) to uncover architectural fault lines.\n\nO'Reilly argues that this playful yet mathematically sound approach produces more robust architectures than conventional methods, and his second book explores how inherited philosophical thinking often undermines software architecture's effectiveness in complex business contexts.\n\nRECOMMENDED BOOKS\nBarry O'Reilly ‚Ä¢ Residues\n (https://leanpub.com/residuality) Barry O'Reilly ‚Ä¢ The Architect's Paradox\n (https://leanpub.com/architectsparadox) Jacqui Read ‚Ä¢ Communication Patterns\n (https://amzn.to/3E37lvv) Anne Currie &amp; Jamie Dobson ‚Ä¢ The Cloud Native Attitude\n (https://amzn.to/3R0exeT) Gregor Hohpe ‚Ä¢ The Software Architect Elevator\n (https://amzn.to/3F6d2ax) Gregor Hohpe ‚Ä¢ Enterprise Integration Patterns, Vol 2 (https://amzn.to/3TNedQ3) \n\n\nBluesky (https://bsky.app/profile/gotocon.com) \nTwitter (https://twitter.com/GOTOcon) \nInstagram (https://www.instagram.com/goto_con) \nLinkedIn (https://www.linkedin.com/company/goto-) \nFacebook (https://www.facebook.com/GOTOConferences) \n\nCHANNEL MEMBERSHIP BONUS\nJoin this channel to get early access to videos &amp; other perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCs_tLP3AiwYKwdUHpltJPuA/join\n\nLooking for a unique learning experience?\nAttend the next GOTO conference near you!
