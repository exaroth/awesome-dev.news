This has happened throughout computing history, with the computer terminal, with early smartphones, and now it's happening again with AI.\n\nAt tldraw, we’ve been working on moving AI interaction away from the chat-based interface, towards a richer canvas environment. It hasn't been easy! I'll show you all the challenges we've faced, and how we're currently overcoming them. Some of the solutions have been surprising.

If not, your colleague most probably is. Either way, this talk is for you.\n\nIn this session, Katrine will shine a light on neurodiversity and the transformative impact it can have on your life, your team, and your business.\n\nNeurodiversity is not only abundantly prevalent in tech organizations; it is a powerful, often underutilized asset that manifests in every corner of our work environments. It is paramount that we adjust our understanding and strategies around this diversity to thrive. Katrine will explore how neurodiversity shows up in the most unexpected ways and why it’s both surprisingly easy and surprisingly challenging to harness its potential in team collaboration and leadership.\n\nThis talk will emphasize practical daily strategies to strengthen collaboration and leverage the advantages of neurodiversity in everyday work contexts, whether it’s adopting clear communication methods, allowing flexible work arrangements, or designing team workflows that play to diverse cognitive strengths.

We'll discuss the key benefits of using Apache Iceberg tables in your data lake such as schema evolution, ACID transactions, hidden partitioning, time traveling and efficient querying.\n\nNext, we'll dive into how to efficiently stream data from Kafka into Iceberg-based data lakes. Confluent Tableflow will be introduced as a potential solution for streamlining the ingestion of Kafka streams into Iceberg tables within your data lake. A live demo will showcase the seamless integration of Kafka with Iceberg, equipping participants with practical knowledge to enhance their data architectures for powerful real-time analytics.\n\n• The role of Kafka in real-time data streaming\n• Why Apache Iceberg is essential for data lakes and data warehouses\n• Iceberg fundamentals: Core concepts and key features\n• Streaming data from Kafka to Iceberg tables in data lakes\n• Use case: Leveraging Confluent Tableflow to stream Kafka data into data lakes and warehouses [...]\n\nTIMECODES\n00:00 Intro\n01:10 Overview\n02:06 Kafka is the standard for operational data\n03:41 Iceberg for analytical data in data lakes\n04:42 Apache Iceberg\n05:27 Why Iceberg?\n12:24 Structure of an Iceberg table\n16:40 Streaming to data lakes is complicated\n20:47 Tableflow materialize Kafka topics as Iceberg tables\n23:47 Demo\n35:37 Outro\n\nDownload slides and read the full abstract here:\nhttps://gotochgo.com/2024/sessions/3370\n\nRECOMMENDED BOOKS\nKasun Indrasiri &amp; Sriskandarajah Suhothayan • Design Patterns for Cloud Native Applications • https://amzn.to/3szGx0p\nKasun Indrasiri &amp; Danesh Kuruppu • gRPC: Up and Running • https://amzn.to/3sBGBJJ\nKasun Indrasiri &amp; Prabath Siriwardena • Microservices for the Enterprise • https://amzn.to/40FhxkQ\nKasun Indrasiri • Beginning WSO2 ESB • https://amzn.to/3sx9NF0\n\nhttps://bsky.app/profile/gotocon.com\nhttps://twitter.com/GOTOcon\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/company/goto-\nhttps://www.instagram.com/goto_con\nhttps://www.facebook.com/GOTOConferences\n#ApacheKafka #Kafka #ApacheIceberg #Iceberg #AmazonAthena #DataStreaming #DataLake #DataWarehouse #ACIDTransactions #KafkaStreams #Confluent #Tableflow #ConfluentTableflow #KasunIndrasiri\n\nCHANNEL MEMBERSHIP BONUS\nJoin this channel to get early access to videos &amp; other perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCs_tLP3AiwYKwdUHpltJPuA/join\n\nLooking for a unique learning experience?\nAttend the next GOTO conference near you!

If you navigate away to browse more items and then return to your cart, your items are still there, waiting for you to check out.</p></blockquote><h2>Common Patterns in Stateful Architecture</h2><p>If you use  session storage (i.e., each app server keeps its own sessions locally), you can configure your load balancer for “sticky sessions.” </p><p>This means: Once a client is assigned to , all subsequent requests from that client are routed to .</p><blockquote><p>: If Server A fails, the user’s session data is lost or the user is forced to re-log in. Sticky sessions are also less flexible when scaling because you can’t seamlessly redistribute user traffic to other servers.</p></blockquote><h3>2. Centralized Session Store</h3><p>A more robust approach is to store session data in a  or  store (e.g., Redis). </p><ul><li><p>: All servers can access and update session data for any user. Any server can handle any request, because the session data is not tied to a specific server’s memory.</p></li></ul><blockquote><p>: You introduce network overhead and rely on an external storage. If the centralized storage fails, you lose session data unless you have a fallback strategy.</p></blockquote><ul><li><p><strong>Personalized Experiences:</strong> Stateful systems can deliver highly tailored interactions, as they remember user preferences and past actions.</p></li><li><p> Users can seamlessly resume activities where they left off, even if they disconnect and reconnect.</p></li><li><p> Certain operations can be faster because the server already possesses necessary data.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p> Maintaining state for a large number of users can become resource-intensive and complex, as each server needs to keep track of specific sessions.</p></li><li><p> Managing and synchronizing state across multiple servers (if needed) introduces additional challenges.</p></li><li><p> If a server holding a user's state fails, their session data might be lost.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p><strong>E-commerce Shopping Carts</strong> – Stores cart contents and user preferences across multiple interactions, even if the user navigates away and returns.</p></li><li><p><strong>Video Streaming Services (Netflix, YouTube)</strong> – Remembers user watch progress, recommendations, and session data for a seamless experience.</p></li><li><p><strong>Messaging Apps (WhatsApp, Slack)</strong> – Maintains active user sessions and message history for real-time communication.</p></li></ul><p>In a  architecture, the server does  preserve client-specific data between individual requests.</p><ul><li><p>Each request is treated as , with no memory of previous interactions.</p></li><li><p>Every request must include <strong>all necessary information</strong> for processing.</p></li><li><p>Once the server responds, it <strong>discards any temporary data</strong> used for that request.</p></li></ul><blockquote><p>: Most  follow a stateless design. For instance, when you request weather data from a public API, you must provide all required details (e.g., location) in each request. The server processes it, sends a response, and forgets the interaction.</p></blockquote><h2>Common Patterns in Stateless Architecture</h2><h3>1. Token-Based Authentication (JWT)</h3><p>A very popular way to implement statelessness is through tokens, particularly  (JSON Web Tokens):</p><ol><li><p><strong>Client Authenticates Once</strong>: The user logs in using credentials (username/password) for the first time, and the server issues a signed .</p></li><li><p>: The client includes JWT token in each request (e.g., <code>Authorization: Bearer &lt;token&gt;</code> header).</p></li><li><p>: The server validates the token’s signature and any embedded claims (e.g., user ID, expiry time).</p></li><li><p>: The server does  need to store session data; it just verifies the token on each request.</p></li></ol><blockquote><p>Many APIs, including OAuth-based authentication systems, use JWTs to enable stateless, scalable authentication.</p></blockquote><p>Stateless architectures benefit from , ensuring that repeated requests produce the same result. This prevents inconsistencies due to network retries or client errors.</p><p> A  request with the same payload  updates the user’s data but doesn’t create duplicates.</p><blockquote><p>Idempotent APIsensures consistency and reliability, especially in distributed systems where requests might be retried automatically.</p></blockquote><ul><li><p> Stateless systems are inherently easier to scale horizontally. New servers can be added effortlessly, as they don't need to maintain any specific user sessions.</p></li><li><p> Since servers don't track state, the architecture is generally simpler and easier to manage.</p></li><li><p> The failure of a single server won't disrupt user sessions, as data isn't tied to specific servers.</p></li><li><p>With no session data stored on the server, you free up memory that would otherwise be reserved for session management.</p></li><li><p><strong>Easier to Cache Responses: </strong>Since requests are self-contained, caching layers (like CDNs) can more easily store and serve responses.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p> Stateless systems can't provide the same level of personalization or context awareness as stateful systems without additional effort (like using cookies or tokens).</p></li><li><p>The client must keep track of the authentication token or relevant data. If it loses the token, it must re-authenticate.</p></li><li><p> Every request needs to carry all the required information, potentially leading to larger payloads.</p></li></ul><ol><li><p><strong>Microservices Architecture: </strong>Each service handles requests independently, relying on external databases or caches instead of maintaining session data.</p></li><li><p><strong>Public APIs (REST, GraphQL): </strong>Clients send tokens with each request, eliminating the need for server-side sessions.</p></li><li><p>Tokens are securely stored on the device and sent with every request to authenticate users.</p></li><li><p>Stateless endpoints make caching easier since responses depend only on request parameters, not stored session data. A CDNcan cache and serve repeated requests, improving performance and reducing backend load.</p></li></ol><p>There's no one-size-fits-all answer when choosing between stateful and stateless architectures.</p><p>The best choice depends on your application’s needs, scalability goals, and user experience expectations.</p><h3><strong>When to Choose Stateful Architecture</strong></h3><p>Stateful systems are ideal when <strong>user context and continuity</strong> are critical. </p><p>Consider a stateful approach if your application:</p><ul><li><p>Requires personalization (e.g., user preferences, session history)</p></li><li><p>Needs real-time interactions (e.g., chat applications, multiplayer gaming)</p></li><li><p>Manages multi-step workflows (e.g., online banking transactions, checkout processes)</p></li><li><p>Must retain authentication sessions for security and convenience</p></li></ul><blockquote><p> A shopping cart in an e-commerce app should persist, so users don’t have to re-add items after refreshing the page.</p></blockquote><h3><strong>When to Choose Stateless Architecture</strong></h3><p>Stateless systems work best when <strong>scalability, simplicity, and resilience</strong> are top priorities. </p><p>Use a stateless approach if your application:</p><ul><li><p>Handles a high volume of requests and needs to scale efficiently</p></li><li><p>Doesn’t require storing client-specific data between requests</p></li><li><p>Needs fast, distributed processing without server dependencies</p></li><li><p>Must ensure reliability and failover readiness</p></li></ul><blockquote><p> A weather API doesn’t need to remember previous requests. Each query includes the location, and the response is processed independently.</p></blockquote><h3><strong>Hybrid Approaches: The Best of Both Worlds</strong></h3><p>Many modern applications  stateful and stateless components for flexibility.</p><p>This hybrid approach allows:</p><ul><li><p>Stateless APIs for core functionality, ensuring high scalability</p></li><li><p>Stateful sessions for personalization, improving user experience</p></li><li><p>External session stores (e.g., Redis) to manage state while keeping app servers stateless</p></li></ul><blockquote><p> A video streaming platform (e.g., Netflix) uses a stateless backend for streaming but retains stateful user sessions to track watch history and recommendations.</p></blockquote><p>If you found it valuable, hit a like ❤️ and consider subscribing for more such content every week.</p><p>If you have any questions or suggestions, leave a comment.</p><div data-attrs=\"{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://blog.algomaster.io/p/how-i-mastered-data-structures-and-algorithms?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share&amp;token=eyJ1c2VyX2lkIjo4MzYwMjc0MywicG9zdF9pZCI6MTQ1NjU1MjUyLCJpYXQiOjE3MjE1MjE3MzEsImV4cCI6MTcyNDExMzczMSwiaXNzIjoicHViLTIyMDIyNjgiLCJzdWIiOiJwb3N0LXJlYWN0aW9uIn0.2cNY811YEugd5iH9XJQhakBzyahGqF7PcATBlFj5J2w&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share&quot;}\" data-component-name=\"CaptionedButtonToDOM\"><div><p>This post is public so feel free to share it.</p></div></div><p> If you’re enjoying this newsletter and want to get even more value, consider becoming a .</p><p>I hope you have a lovely day!</p>","contentLength":8861,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/7e4801c3-e3aa-4ab6-8fe6-759af4a1f91a_1684x1196.png","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"@osherove about Pipeline Driven Organizations","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOKEXaxRdfs","date":1739192491,"author":"GOTO Conferences","guid":421,"unread":true,"content":"<article>Check out the full version on our YouTube channel now! #GOTOcon #GOTOams #PipelineDriven #Cooperative #CooperativePipeline #CoOpsPipelines #ContinuousDelivery #CICD #DevOps #DevSecOps #DevTestOps #Programming #DevOps2 #SDLC #RoyOsherove #Viral #ViralShorts #GOTO\n\nFull version available here:\nhttps://youtu.be/zmA5fhV-FGk\n\nRoy Osherove - Author of \"The Art Of Unit Testing\" and \"Elastic Leadership: Growing Self-Organizing Teams\" @osherove \n\nRECOMMENDED BOOK\nRoy Osherove • The Art of Unit Testing • https://bit.ly/3obiKNB\nRoy Osherove • Elastic Leadership • https://amzn.to/3fxEgID\nRoy Osherove • Notes to a Software Team Leader • https://amzn.to/3wjroxJ\nGoldratt &amp; Cox • The Goal: A Process of Ongoing Improvement • https://amzn.to/3jqNpZv\n\nCHANNEL MEMBERSHIP BONUS\nJoin this channel to get early access to videos &amp; other perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCs_tLP3AiwYKwdUHpltJPuA/join\n\nLooking for a unique learning experience?\nAttend the next GOTO conference near you!
