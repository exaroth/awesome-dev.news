How do Xi Jinping, Vladimir Putin, or Ali Khamenei assess Trump’s willingness to defend America’s allies? The short-order withdrawals from Iraq and Afghanistan have already raised doubts about American willpower; casting out Ukraine—a nation enduring extreme suffering to retain its freedom and become a liberal society—would have consequences not only in Europe but also for Taiwan and other embattled democracies. It doesn’t take a seasoned expert in alliance management to recognize that lecturing the Europeans to double down and recommit to the fight won’t be convincing if it’s delivered over the shoulder as the American secretary of defense turns tail and runs.</p><p>It gets worse. Hegseth suggested that the United States would maintain some nuclear umbrella over the European continent but “require our European allies to step into the arena and take ownership of conventional security on the continent.” The next step in this process most likely would be a withdrawal of U.S. forces now stationed in Europe. This is a recipe for mischief. It goes a long way to undercut the deterrent value of American power while encouraging nuclear proliferation. Extended deterrence—i.e., the nuclear umbrella—rests on the assumption that the United States would be willing to use nuclear weapons in a war in Europe in which its forces were already engaged. With no forces engaged, the reason to use nuclear weapons—or even threaten their use—dwindles, and with no American nukes, others will seek their own.</p><p>It should not be assumed that a Europe confident in its ability to protect itself is ipso facto a good thing. European states have a very long history of quarreling with one another; part of the European Union’s success has been that, with the United States and NATO in the background, it has not had to worry about collective security. Who would doubt that in 1914 or 1939, Europe was more than capable of defending itself?</p><p>But even—perhaps especially—if the Europeans can hang together and reclaim great-power capabilities, there is no guarantee that Europe’s interests will always and perfectly align with ours. Europeans have tolerated our Middle East adventures, but in no small measure because they thought it would keep NATO strong. Germans, for example, would like to do more business in China and perhaps return to the salad days of cheap Russian energy.
