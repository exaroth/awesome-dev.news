One of the key challenges in modern agriculture is the accurate classification of agricultural products, which directly impacts quality control, pricing, and supply chain management. Traditional methods of classification often rely on manual inspection, which can be time-consuming and prone to errors.</p><p>With the rise of data-driven technologies, Machine Learning (ML) offers a powerful alternative to automate and enhance agricultural product classification. By analyzing dimensional and shape factors, ML algorithms can accurately classify various agricultural products, reducing manual labor and increasing efficiency. This project explores how machine learning techniques can be applied to classify agricultural products using real-world data, leading to smarter agricultural practices and better decision-making.</p><p>📊 Project Overview\nThis project focuses on classifying agricultural products based on dimensional and shape factors using machine learning.

Everything looks great in dev, the logs are clean, requests are snappy, and life is good. Then… disaster strikes. A user reports a bug. Another complains about slow response times. You check your logs—wait, where are they? You SSH into the server, tail some logs, guess what went wrong, and hope for the best. Sound familiar?</p><p>Observability—knowing what’s happening inside your app in real time—shouldn’t be this hard. But setting up an observability stack often feels like assembling IKEA furniture with missing instructions. That’s where  comes in.</p><p><a href=\"https://pydantic.dev/logfire\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Pydantic Logfire</a> is a platform that makes it ridiculously easy to add observability to your application, no matter the size. In this post, I’ll show you how to integrate Logfire into a  app to get instant insights into logs, traces, and metrics—without the usual setup headaches. By the end, you’ll have real-time visibility into what’s happening under the hood, so you can debug, optimize, and sleep better at night.</p><p>We will build two services that handles orders and shipping for BigHuge Corp Inc. To keep things straightforward, we'll put both the services in the same repo and run a FastAPI for each of them to emulate two services talking to each other.</p><div><pre><code>fastapi-logfire\nfastapi-logfire\n</code></pre></div><p>We'll create a virtual environment and activate it:</p><p>Let's install the necessary packages:</p><div><pre><code>pip </code></pre></div><h3> and  services\n</h3><p>The ordering service will contain just two endpoints - one to place an order and one to get the details of a specific order. Similarly the shipping service will have two endpoints - one to initiate the shipping process and one to get the status of a shipment. </p><p>The ordering service will invoke the shipping service in both its endpoints. \nHere's the code for both the services:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Now we'll create  and  which will be used to start both the services</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>You can run both services on separate terminals using the  command.</p><div><pre><code>fastapi dev 8001 app/main2.py\n</code></pre></div><p>You can go to  to try the ordering service out and see if everything is working as expected.</p><p>Before we integrate logfire, you need to create a token from Logfire so that you can write data to the logfire dashboard.  You can read on how to generate the token <a href=\"https://logfire.pydantic.dev/docs/#overview\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">here</a>. Once you have the token, you can save it as an environment variable in a  file (You might need to install  to use it).</p><p>We'll start small. We'll integrate logfire into our app such that all logs generated by the app will be sent to the logfire dashboard. We'll integrate logfire into the  standard library. (Tip: you can also emit logs directly using logfire methods like )</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>We've defined a  function that we can call anywhere in our project to send logs.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>You can add similar statements in the  handler as well.</p><p>In  and , we'll add the logic to configure logfire</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Do the same for , but with  as shipping.</p><p>If you run both the apps again, and try out some requests, you will see some logs displaying on the Live tab of the logfire dashboad:</p><p>Great! Now we see our logging statements in the dashboard. But Logfire lets us instrument fastapi directly to get even more data for each request. Let's implement that. </p><p>Under the  in both  and , add a new line of code:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Now all your requests to both servers are instrumented automatically.</p><p>Now all the service level logs are neatly nested under the respective requests. But get this - it can get even better. </p><p>So we set up our application in such a way the  endpoint will call  endpoint inside it. It would be really nice if our dashboard could display this sequential flow instead of showing both the calls as separate (like we saw before). We can do this using tracing. </p><p>For tracing to work, context has to be propagated across services. This \"context\" helps keep track of the parent trace/span of a new span/log so that they can be viewed in tandem.  Thankfully logfire gives us an easy way to do this. Since we're using  to use the  service, we'll install the associated library from logfire.</p><div><pre><code>pip </code></pre></div><p>We'll update the code in  to add <code>logfire.instrument_requests()</code></p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>We don't need to update  (the shipping one) because we aren't sending any requests in that server for now.</p><p> will make sure that the traceparent header is automatically set when making requests.  makes sure that the  header is extracted correctly from incoming requests. Thats it. !</p><p>Run the servers again, and try sending some requests. You'll see something like this in your logfire dashboard:</p><p>And heavens forbid, if something were to go wrong in one of the services, you now know exactly where it went wrong. Let's test this out:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>If we try  now, we'll see something like this:</p><p>Metrics signify how much of something exists. When paired with a time series, we can know the metric value at a point in time. This is useful for observing data like number of requests over a period of time, or things like CPU utilisation over time etc.</p><p>Setting up system metric tracking is pretty straightforward with logfire, so we'll do that first.</p><div><pre><code>pip </code></pre></div><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Now go to the logfire platform on your browser, select the \"Dashboards\" tab. Click on the \"New Dashboard\" button. Select \"Basic System Metrics (Logfire)\" from the drop down.</p><p>Run the server again and you should be seeing the graph populate with your system data.</p><p>if you choose \"Web Server Metrics\" from the create dashboard drop down, you'll get another readymade dashboard containing useful metrics from our services.</p><p>Now let's add a custom metric to see the orders placed over time. We'll use a counter for this one.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Now on the logfire platform, create a new dashboard and choose \"Start from scratch\" from the dropdown. Click on \"Add Chart\". We have to retrieve the data we need from logfire using SQL. To get an idea of how to structure your SQL queries, use the \"Explore\" tab in the logfire platform. </p><p>To get the total orders placed in a time period we'll use the following query:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Set the visualisation type as \"Values\" and save the chart. Now the chart will get updated based on the time period that you select on top.</p><p>To chart this in a time series, use the following query:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Choose the visualisation as \"Time Series\", and set the metrics to \"scalar_value\". </p><p>In this post, we took a  to setting up observability in a FastAPI app using , covering <strong>logging, distributed tracing, and real-time metrics</strong> with minimal setup.

To make this possible, we need a REST API to handle book data efficiently.</p><p>REST APIs are the backbone of modern web applications, enabling seamless communication between frontend and backend systems. Django REST Framework (DRF) simplifies API development by providing a powerful toolkit built on top of Django. In this guide, we'll build a simple REST API to manage books.</p><p>Before starting this tutorial, you should have:</p><p>✅ Basic understanding of Python programming\n✅ Familiarity with web development concepts<p>\n✅ Python 3.8+ installed on your system</p>\n✅ Basic knowledge of the Django framework<p>\n✅ Understanding of HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)</p>\n✅ Experience using the command-line interface</p><p>By the end of this tutorial, you will be able to:</p><p>✅ Set up a Django REST Framework project from scratch\n✅ Create API endpoints using function-based views (FBVs) and class-based views (CBVs)<p>\n✅ Implement model serialization for JSON responses</p>\n✅ Perform CRUD operations via a REST API<p>\n✅ Test API endpoints using browsable API and cURL commands</p></p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Why Django REST Framework?\n</h3><p>Django REST Framework has become the go-to choice for building APIs with Django because it offers:</p><p>✔️ Powerful serialization capabilities\n✔️ Built-in authentication and permissions<p>\n✔️ Browsable API interface for easy testing</p>\n✔️ Extensive documentation and strong community support<p>\n✔️ Flexible request/response handling</p>\n✔️ Support for pagination, filtering, and throttling</p><p>Let’s start building our REST API step by step.</p><p>Step 1: Environment Setup</p><p>First, create a clean development environment:</p><div><pre><code># Create a project folder\nmkdir book-api &amp;&amp; cd book-api\n\n# Create a virtual environment\npython -m venv venv\n\n# Activate the virtual environment (Windows)\nvenv\\Scripts\\activate\n\n# Activate the virtual environment (Mac/Linux)\nsource venv/bin/activate\n\n# Install Django and Django REST Framework\npip install django djangorestframework\n\n</code></pre></div><p>Now, create a Django project and an app for managing books.</p><div><pre><code># Create a Django project\ndjango-admin startproject bookapi\n\ncd bookapi\n\n# Create a Django app\npython manage.py startapp books\n\n</code></pre></div><p>Register Django REST Framework and the books app in settings.py:</p><div><pre><code>INSTALLED_APPS = [\n    'django.contrib.admin',\n    'django.contrib.auth',\n    'django.contrib.contenttypes',\n    'django.contrib.sessions',\n    'django.contrib.messages',\n    'django.contrib.staticfiles',\n\n    # Third-party apps\n    'rest_framework',\n\n    # Local apps\n    'books',\n]\n\n</code></pre></div><p>Define a Book model in books/models.py:</p><div><pre><code>from django.db import models\n\nclass Book(models.Model):\n    title = models.CharField(max_length=255)\n    author = models.CharField(max_length=255)\n    published_date = models.DateField()\n    isbn = models.CharField(max_length=13, unique=True)\n\n    def __str__(self):\n        return self.title\n</code></pre></div><div><pre><code>python manage.py makemigrations books\npython manage.py migrate\n</code></pre></div><p><strong>Step 5: Serializer Creation</strong></p><p>Create books/serializers.py to handle data conversion:</p><div><pre><code>from rest_framework import serializers\nfrom .models import Book\n\nclass BookSerializer(serializers.ModelSerializer):\n    class Meta:\n        model = Book\n        fields = '__all__'\n</code></pre></div><p>We'll implement both function-based views (FBVs) and class-based views (CBVs).</p><p><strong>Function-Based Views (FBVs)</strong></p><div><pre><code>from rest_framework.response import Response\nfrom rest_framework.decorators import api_view\nfrom .models import Book\nfrom .serializers import BookSerializer\n\n@api_view(['GET'])\ndef book_list(request):\n    books = Book.objects.all()\n    serializer = BookSerializer(books, many=True)\n    return Response(serializer.data)\n\n@api_view(['POST'])\ndef book_create(request):\n    serializer = BookSerializer(data=request.data)\n    if serializer.is_valid():\n        serializer.save()\n        return Response(serializer.data, status=201)\n    return Response(serializer.errors, status=400)\n\n\n</code></pre></div><p>For a more scalable approach, use Django REST Framework’s generic views:</p><div><pre><code>from rest_framework import generics\nfrom .models import Book\nfrom .serializers import BookSerializer\n\nclass BookListCreateView(generics.ListCreateAPIView):\n    queryset = Book.objects.all()\n    serializer_class = BookSerializer\n\n</code></pre></div><p><strong>Step 7: URL Configuration</strong></p><div><pre><code>from django.urls import path\nfrom .views import book_list, book_create, BookListCreateView\n\nurlpatterns = [\n    # Function-based views\n    path('books/', book_list, name='book-list'),\n    path('books/create/', book_create, name='book-create'),\n\n    # Class-based views\n    path('books/cbv/', BookListCreateView.as_view(), name='book-list-cbv'),\n]\n\n</code></pre></div><p>**Update bookapi/urls.py:</p><div><pre><code>from django.contrib import admin\nfrom django.urls import path, include\n\nurlpatterns = [\n    path('admin/', admin.site.urls),\n    path('api/', include('books.urls')),\n]\n\n</code></pre></div><p>Run the server and visit:</p><p><code>📌 http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/books/</code></p><p>Django REST Framework provides an interactive browsable API that allows you to test endpoints without external tools!</p><p>You can also test the API using cURL commands:</p><div><pre><code># GET request\ncurl -X GET http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/books/\n\n# POST request\ncurl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/books/create/ \\\n     -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n     -d '{\"title\": \"Django for Beginners\", \"author\": \"William Vincent\", \"published_date\": \"2021-09-01\", \"isbn\": \"9781735467207\"}'\n</code></pre></div><p><strong>Next Steps: Enhancing Your API</strong></p><p>Now that you have a working API, consider improving it with:\n✔️ Authentication &amp; Permissions (e.g., only authenticated users can add books)<p>\n✔️ Pagination for Large Datasets</p>\n✔️ Filtering &amp; Searching<p>\n✔️ ViewSets &amp; Routers for cleaner URL management</p></p><p>🎉 Congratulations! You have successfully built a simple REST API using the Django REST Framework.

While the documentation is comprehensive, it can be overwhelming to navigate, especially when you're trying to build advanced AI agents.</p><p>This guide is my attempt to consolidate the key concepts and practical implementations of LangGraph in one place. Whether you're building a conversational agent that needs to remember context, a multi-step reasoning agent, or a complex workflow that coordinates multiple AI components, LangGraph provides the framework to make it happen. I created this reference for myself but I hope it helps others who want a more straightforward explanation of how to use LangGraph effectively.</p><p>LangGraph is a framework that brings state machines to Large Language Model (LLM) applications. It's particularly useful when you need to build complex, stateful applications with LLMs. The framework allows you to structure your application as a graph, where each node represents a specific task or state, and edges represent transitions between states.</p><p>Let's start with a simple example to understand the core concepts: we are developing a simple agent that collects information and  processes it, the actions  of collecting and processing information are just fixed actions but they can be replaced with more complex actions.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>This example shows the basic structure of a LangGraph application:</p><ol><li>Define your state using TypedDict, it contains the information that the workflow will need to keep track of.</li><li>Create functions for each state, these functions are the actions that the workflow will perform.</li><li>Build a graph with nodes and edges, the nodes are the states and the edges are the transitions between them.</li><li>Compile the graph into a runnable application, this will create a callable object that can be invoked with an initial state.</li><li>I also added a simple way to save the graph visualization as a PNG file, this will work if you are running this example locally and should save a file that will show the graph structure like below.</li></ol><p>The graph is a good way to understand the workflow, it shows the nodes and the edges between them, the entry and finish points and the state of the workflow.</p><p>This particular example is not very useful but it shows the core concepts of LangGraph, you can simply replace the fixed actions with more complex ones and build a useful agent.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Serving LangGraph as a Web Service\n</h2><p>While LangGraph itself doesn't include built-in server capabilities, you can easily create a web service using <a href=\"https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">FastAPI</a> to serve your LangGraph workflows. Below I have modified the previous example to add a simple FastAPI server that allows you to run the workflow from a web interface.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>You can run this locally or using the <a href=\"https://huggingface.co/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Hugging Face</a> space below, this is the URL to access the swagger API for this example <a href=\"https://jstoppa-langgraph-basic-example-api.hf.space/docs\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://jstoppa-langgraph-basic-example-api.hf.space/docs</a>, the API has an end point to run the agent and it returns the messages we've seen in our previous example (see below the results). In simple words, the API has an end point to run the agent and it returns the messages we've seen in our previous example.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Making it all work with a more interesting example\n</h2><p>We are now going to create a more interesting example, an AI agent that does code reviews, this is far from a production-ready agent but it will give us a better understanding of how to use LangGraph.</p><p>The screenshot below shows the interface for the code review agent, the user can enter a code and the agent will return a report with the code analysis. This interface uses the <a href=\"https://www.gradio.app/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Gradio library</a> to create a simple web interface, this saves a lot of time compared to building a full web app.</p><p>The full code is provided after this but the most impportant part of the example is the graph, it shows the nodes and the edges between them, the entry and finish points and the state of the workflow, this is how the graph will look through the code and analyse the code with different agents that are especialised on different aspects. This is a very similar apporach we've seen in the previous example but it contains more actions and the actions do use LLMs to analyse the code.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>the full code for the agent is below and it can also be found in Hugging Face below.<a href=\"https://huggingface.co/spaces/jstoppa/langgraph_agent_code_reviewer\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fimg.shields.io%2Fbadge%2F%25F0%259F%25A4%2597%2520Run%2520in-Hugging%2520Face-blue\" alt=\"Run example in Hugging Face\" width=\"144\" height=\"20\"></a></p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>LangGraph makes it easier to build AI agents that need to manage complex workflows.

While OpenAI’s GPT models are widely used, many developers want to understand how these models work and even train their own versions from scratch. In this in-depth guide, we will explore how to build a lightweight LLM using Python, train it on Hacker News data, optimize its performance, and deploy it for real-world usage.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  What is a Language Model?\n</h3><p>A Language Model (LM) is a type of artificial intelligence model that predicts the likelihood of a sequence of words in a given language. It learns patterns, grammar, and context from a large corpus of text data, enabling it to generate coherent and contextually relevant text. For example, given the phrase \"I love to code in,\" an LM might predict \"Python\" as the next word, based on patterns observed in its training data.</p><p>LMs are used in various applications, including:</p><ul><li>Text generation: Creating articles, stories, or dialogues.</li><li>Machine translation: Translating text from one language to another.</li><li>Text classification: Sentiment analysis or spam detection.</li><li>Autocomplete: Suggesting words or phrases in search engines or text editors.</li><li>In this article, we'll focus on building a simple autoregressive LM that predicts the next word in a sequence, trained specifically on HackerNews data.</li></ul><ul><li>Understanding how LLMs work</li><li>Collecting and preprocessing Hacker News data</li><li>Tokenizing text and creating structured datasets</li><li>Training a transformer-based model using PyTorch and Hugging Face Transformers</li><li>Fine-tuning and optimizing for better performance</li><li>Evaluating model performance using loss metrics and perplexity</li><li>Deploying the model with FastAPI and making it accessible via an API</li><li>Improving the model with reinforcement learning and knowledge distillation</li><li>Scaling the model with distributed training</li><li>Reducing computational costs through quantization and pruning</li><li>Enhancing model security with adversarial training</li></ul><p>Before we start, install the necessary dependencies:</p><div><pre><code>pip torch transformers datasets tokenizers accelerate fastapi uvicorn matplotlib deepspeed bitsandbytes\n</code></pre></div><ul><li> for deep learning computations</li><li> for leveraging pre-built architectures like GPT-2</li><li> for handling large text corpora efficiently</li><li> for high-speed text processing</li><li> and  for deploying the model as an API</li><li> for visualizing loss curves and performance metrics</li><li> for optimizing large-scale model training</li><li> for quantization to reduce memory footprint</li></ul><h2>\n  \n  \n  Step 1: Understanding Large Language Models\n</h2><p>Before diving into code, it's essential to grasp how LLMs function. At their core, these models are neural networks trained to predict the next word in a sequence given an input context. They use:</p><ul><li> to break text into numerical representations</li><li><strong>Transformer architectures</strong> (such as GPT-2) with attention mechanisms to understand long-range dependencies</li><li> to train on vast amounts of unstructured text data</li><li> to adapt to specific tasks, such as chatbots or code generation</li></ul><h2>\n  \n  \n  Step 2: Collecting Hacker News Data\n</h2><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><h2>\n  \n  \n  Step 3: Preprocessing and Tokenization\n</h2><p>Data cleaning ensures better training results. We remove HTML tags, non-text characters, and normalize text.</p><blockquote><p>Tokenization is the process of breaking down text into smaller units, called tokens, which can be words, subwords or even characters. This step is critical to transforming text into a numerical representation that deep learning models can understand and process.</p></blockquote><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><h2>\n  \n  \n  Step 4: Creating a Dataset and DataLoader\n</h2><p>We format our text for training using PyTorch’s  class.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><h2>\n  \n  \n  Step 5: Training the Transformer Model\n</h2><p>We fine-tune a pre-trained GPT-2 model on our dataset.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><h2>\n  \n  \n  Step 6: Model Optimization\n</h2><p>Model optimization focuses on improving the efficiency of a trained model by reducing its memory usage and increasing its inference speed. Two key techniques used for optimization are:</p><p>Quantization reduces the precision of model parameters (e.g., converting 32-bit floating point numbers to 8-bit integers). This helps decrease memory consumption and speeds up inference, especially on resource-limited devices.\nIn the code, we achieve this using <code>BitsAndBytesConfig(load_in_8bit=True)</code>, which loads the GPT-2 model in an 8-bit format, reducing its size and computational requirements.</p><p>Pruning removes unnecessary parameters from the model, reducing the number of computations required during inference. While pruning is not explicitly implemented in the code, it can be done by eliminating less significant weights from the neural network.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><h2>\n  \n  \n  Step 7: Deploying as an API\n</h2><p>We use FastAPI to make our model accessible.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>We have successfully built, trained, optimized, and deployed a custom LLM using Hacker News data. Future improvements could involve:</p><ul><li>Training on a larger dataset</li><li>Optimizing hyperparameters</li><li>Implementing reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF)</li><li>Deploying in a production-grade environment</li><li>Enhancing security against adversarial attacks</li></ul>","contentLength":4936,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"This Week In Python","url":"https://dev.to/bascodes/this-week-in-python-1gc6","date":1740155047,"author":"Bas Steins","guid":8694,"unread":true,"content":"<p>This Week in Python is a concise reading list about what happened in the past week in the Python universe.</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://github.com/Goldziher/kreuzberg\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">kreuzberg</a> – A text extraction library supporting PDFs, images, office documents and more</li><li><a href=\"https://github.com/kevinpdev/gpt-from-scratch\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">gpt-from-scratch</a> – Educational implementation of a small GPT model from scratch in a single Jupyter Notebook</li><li><a href=\"https://github.com/seemoo-lab/opendrop\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">opendrop</a> – An open Apple AirDrop implementation written in Python</li></ul>","contentLength":373,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"RandomRotation in PyTorch","url":"https://dev.to/hyperkai/randomrotation-in-pytorch-58g","date":1740151517,"author":"Super Kai (Kazuya Ito)","guid":8656,"unread":true,"content":"<ul><li>The 1st argument for initialization is (Required-Type:,  or /( or )):\n*Memos:\n\n<ul><li>It's the range of the degrees  so it must be .</li><li>A tuple/list must be the 1D with 2 elements.</li><li>A single value must be .</li><li>A single value means .</li></ul></li><li>The 2nd argument for initialization is (Optional-Default:<code>InterpolationMode.NEAREST</code>-Type:<a href=\"https://pytorch.org/vision/main/_modules/torchvision/transforms/functional.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">InterpolationMode</a>).</li><li>The 3rd argument for initialization is (Optional-Default:-Type:).</li><li>The 4th argument for initialization is (Optional-Default:-Type:/( or )):\n*Memos:\n\n<ul><li>It can change the center position of an image.</li><li>It must be the 1D with 2 elements.</li></ul></li><li>The 5th argument for initialization is (Optional-Default:-Type:,  or /( or )):\n*Memos:\n\n<ul><li>It can change the background of an image. *The background can be seen when rotating an image.</li><li>A tuple/list must be the 1D with 1 or 3 elements.</li></ul></li><li>The 1st argument is (Required-Type: or ()):\n*Memos:\n\n<ul></ul></li></ul><div><pre><code></code></pre></div>","contentLength":832,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"I Just Found Out You Can Switch Search Engines—Here’s How! 😁","url":"https://dev.to/kihuni/i-just-found-out-you-can-switch-search-engines-heres-how-52g5","date":1740150310,"author":"kihuni","guid":8655,"unread":true,"content":"<p>Hey, 😎 folks!

Java is one of the oldest and most robust programming languages. It is also an object-oriented language mainly used for Android application development. This is one of the main reasons it is still used today. However, with the advent of programming languages ​​like Kotlin (also suitable for Android development), Java is becoming less popular.</p><p>However, Java remains one of the most expensive programming languages ​​and is in great demand. According to Indeed, software developers are interested in Java developers and pay more than $ 100,000 a year.</p><p>Swift iOS application development is currently very popular. Swift is a very stable programming language and worth studying. It’s easier to learn than Java. YouTube has a lot of resources to help you learn, and programming with them is fun. If you’re a freelance developer in Swift now, or if you work for a job related to it, your annual salary can reach $ 115,000.</p><p>SQL or Sequel is a structured search language. Some people think it’s not really a programming language. SQL is mainly used for data management and interactive.

JavaScript is a very popular language. If you check GitHub, you’ll always see new frameworks that support JavaScript. In addition, all browsers support JavaScript. Therefore, learning JavaScript is one of the skills that software development must know. JavaScript developers can earn income in the range of $ 90,000 to $ 113,000.</p><p>According to Google Trends and the PyPI Popularity Index, Python is one of the most popular programming languages ​​in the world and certainly one of the most expensive programming languages. Google was built in Python, and YouTube was also developed in Python.</p><p>The amazing thing about Python is that it’s a general-purpose programming language used to build a wide range of applications. Furthermore, it is active in artificial intelligence. Self-driving cars, Wal-Mart auto-payment, and many automation and machine learning (ML) apps were developed through Python. This makes this language more important and rapidly popularizes. In addition, Python is easier to learn than all other languages ​​and is easy for beginners. You can also build complex applications relatively easily and quickly.

A Beginner’s Guide","url":"https://dev.to/kihuni/what-is-a-restful-api-a-beginners-guide-4hdg","date":1740124827,"author":"kihuni","guid":8439,"unread":true,"content":"<p>In today’s digital world, applications need to communicate seamlessly with each other. Whether you log into a website, check the weather on your phone, or order food online, you're likely interacting with a RESTful API in the background.</p><p>But what exactly is a RESTful API? In this guide, we'll break it down in a simple and digestible way.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  What Does \"RESTful\" Even Mean?\n</h3><p>Let’s start with the basics.</p><p>An API (Application Programming Interface) is a way for different software applications to communicate with each other. Think of it like a waiter in a restaurant:</p><ul><li>You (the client) place an order.</li><li>The waiter (API) takes your request to the kitchen (server).</li><li>The kitchen prepares the food and the waiter brings it back to you.</li></ul><p>In technical terms, an API allows a client (e.g., a web app or mobile app) to request and receive data from a server.</p><p><em>So, What Are RESTful APIs??</em></p><p>REST stands for Representational State Transfer—don’t worry, it’s not as complicated as it sounds! It’s just a set of instructions for how computers and apps should share info over the internet. Think of it like a simple rulebook for keeping their conversations clear and organized.</p><p>A RESTful API is an API that follows these REST rules. It’s like calling a café “specialty” because it makes coffee in a certain way. RESTful APIs have their principles which APIs must follow to qualify as \"RESTFUL APIs\".</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  What Makes an API 'RESTful'\n</h3><p>For an API to be RESTful, it must follow these principles:</p><ol><li><p>Client-Server Architecture – The client (e.g., a mobile app) and server (e.g., a database) remain separate so they can evolve independently.</p></li><li><p>Statelessness – The server does not store client data between requests. Every request contains all the necessary information.</p></li><li><p>Cacheability – Responses can be cached to improve performance.</p></li><li><p>Uniform Interface – Consistent resource naming and use of HTTP methods.</p></li><li><p>Layered System – Requests can pass through intermediaries (e.g., load balancers) without affecting how they function.</p></li></ol><p>RESTful APIs rely on standard HTTP methods to perform actions on resources. Imagine an online payslip system::</p><div><table><thead><tr></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td> (Get payslip with ID 123)</td></tr><tr><td> (Add a new payslip)</td></tr><tr><td> (Update payslip with ID 123)</td></tr><tr><td> (Delete payslip with ID 123)</td></tr></tbody></table></div><p><em>Example API Request (Python)</em></p><p>Here’s a simple Python example using the requests library to fetch a payslip:</p><div><pre><code>import requests\n\nresponse = requests.get(\"https://api.example.com/payslips/123\")\nif response.status_code == 200:\n    print(response.json())\nelse:\n    print(\"Error fetching data\")\n</code></pre></div><p>This request retrieves a payslip from the API and prints the JSON response.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  RESTful APIs vs. Other API Styles\n</h3><ul><li>REST: Uses lightweight JSON or XML over HTTP.</li><li>SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol): More complex, uses XML, and requires additional protocols like WS-Security.</li></ul><ul><li>REST: Fixed endpoints (/users, /orders).</li><li>GraphQL: Allows flexible queries, fetching only necessary data</li></ul><h3>\n  \n  \n  Authentication in RESTful APIs\n</h3><p>APIs often require authentication to protect sensitive data. Common methods include:</p><ul><li>API Keys – Unique keys assigned to users.</li><li>OAuth 2.0 – Secure authorization protocol used by platforms like Google and GitHub.</li><li>JWT (JSON Web Tokens) – Tokens used for secure authentication between client and server.</li></ul><p>Example authentication using a Bearer Token:</p><div><pre><code>headers = {\"Authorization\": \"Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN\"}\nresponse = requests.get(\"https://api.example.com/payslips/123\", headers=headers)\nprint(response.json())\n</code></pre></div><p>RESTful APIs are a clever and organized way for apps and computers to share stuff over the internet. They use simple ideas like resources (think of them as items they’re working with), HTTP methods (like “get” or “send”), and web addresses (called URIs), plus some cool tricks like not remembering past chats (statelessness) and saving info for later (caching). All of this keeps things fast and smooth. Whether you’re creating payslips or playing music on an app, RESTful APIs are quietly making it happen every day.</p><p>Next time you’re using an app, think about the RESTful magic working behind the scenes—it’s pretty awesome! If you’re curious, try playing with a free API (like a <a href=\"https://openweathermap.org/api\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">weather API</a>—it’s a fun way to start!).</p>","contentLength":4179,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Talk Python to Me: #494: Update on Flet: Python + Flutter UIs","url":"https://talkpython.fm/episodes/show/494/update-on-flet-python-flutter-uis","date":1740124800,"author":"","guid":8782,"unread":true,"content":"<article>As Python developers, we're incredibly lucky to have over half a million packages that we can use to build our applications with over at PyPI.

If you're passionate about storytelling and want to bring your ideas to life through a visual medium, learning Ren'Py is a great first step.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.renpy.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Ren'Py</a> is a free and open-source engine that simplifies visual novel development. Whether you're an aspiring writer, artist, or programmer, Ren'Py provides all the tools you need to create professional-quality visual novels without requiring extensive technical knowledge.</p><p>In this article, we'll explore why Ren'Py is the perfect tool for beginners, the key concepts you need to learn, and how you can accelerate your journey with the right resources.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  1. Why Choose Ren'Py for Your Visual Novel Projects?\n</h2><p>Ren'Py has earned its place as the go-to tool for many visual novel developers, and for good reason. Here’s why it’s the best option for beginners:</p><p> Ren'Py uses a simple, Python-based scripting language that is easy to learn, even if you have no programming experience. Despite its simplicity, Ren'Py offers a wide range of features, such as branching narratives, interactive elements, character animations, and more. You can easily tweak Ren'Py to suit your needs, whether you’re a beginner or an advanced user. Ren'Py has a supportive community of developers, writers, and artists who share their knowledge, assets, and advice.\nIf you’re serious about creating high-quality visual novels, Ren'Py provides the perfect balance of simplicity and flexibility.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  2. Key Concepts to Understand in Ren'Py\n</h2><p>Learning Ren'Py can seem overwhelming at first, but once you break it down, it’s not as difficult as it seems. Here are some essential concepts you’ll need to grasp to get started:</p><p>Ren'Py’s scripting language is simple and intuitive. To create a scene, you’ll write commands that define the characters, backgrounds, and dialogue. For example:</p><div><pre><code>label start:\n    scene bg room\n    show char1 happy\n    \"Welcome to my visual novel!\"\n</code></pre></div><p>This basic script shows how easy it is to get started with Ren'Py. The syntax is straightforward, allowing you to focus on writing the story rather than wrestling with complex code.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Creating Characters &amp; Backgrounds\n</h3><p>You’ll need to create character sprites and backgrounds to bring your story to life. Ren'Py makes it easy to display images and manage character emotions or poses:</p><p>This line will show char1 with a sad expression. You can swap out different images, backgrounds, and even animate characters, adding life to your narrative.</p><p>Choice Menus and Branching Narratives\nOne of Ren'Py’s strongest features is its ability to let players make choices that impact the story. With a simple menu command, you can create branching paths for the player to follow:</p><div><pre><code>menu:\n    \"Go left\":\n        jump left_path\n    \"Go right\":\n        jump right_path\n</code></pre></div><p>This simple choice mechanic adds replayability and depth to your visual novel.</p><p>Ren'Py offers a variety of transitions and visual effects, like fades, wipes, and custom animations. This is where you can start adding some flair to your visual novel, creating smooth scene changes or dramatic visual effects.</p><p>For example, to fade out a scene, you can use:</p><p>This creates a smoother transition between scenes, enhancing the overall experience.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Interactivity &amp; Minigames\n</h3><p>You can also incorporate minigames into your visual novel, providing an interactive element beyond the traditional choices. For example, in my own project, I developed a puzzle mini-game, where players could engage with the game to unlock new parts of the story.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  3. Resources to Accelerate Your Learning\n</h2><p>While Ren'Py is beginner-friendly, the best way to learn is by combining hands-on experience with structured learning. There are many great resources to help you along the way:</p><p> The official Ren'Py Documentation is the best place to start. It covers everything from basic scripting to advanced features. The Ren'Py forums are filled with tips, tutorials, and code snippets from experienced developers.<strong>Tutorial Blogs and YouTube Channels:</strong> There are numerous free tutorials online, many of which provide step-by-step guides to help you create your first visual novel.</p><p>If you’re looking for a more structured approach, I’ve created a comprehensive Udemy course titled <a href=\"https://www.udemy.com/course/mastering-renpy-create-visual-novels-like-a-pro/?referralCode=9A4732B0C1A919F10AA6&amp;couponCode=ST3MT200225B\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Mastering Ren'Py: Create Visual Novels Like a Pro</a>. In this course, I cover everything from the basics to advanced techniques like creating custom screens, implementing animations, and designing minigames. It's a one-stop resource for anyone serious about mastering Ren'Py.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  4. Common Mistakes Beginners Make (and How to Avoid Them)\n</h2><p>Even the most experienced developers make mistakes, but the good news is that you can avoid common pitfalls by learning from others. Here are a few mistakes beginners often make and how to avoid them:</p><p><strong>Overcomplicating the Story:</strong> While it’s tempting to have a complex plot with endless branching, it’s better to start with a simple story. Focus on making each choice meaningful and impactful. It’s easy to get lost in a pile of code. Make sure to organize your scripts properly and comment on your code to avoid confusion later on. Testing is crucial. Playtest your visual novel frequently to catch bugs or awkward pacing before it’s too late.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  5. Tips for Creating an Engaging Visual Novel\n</h2><p>Now that you understand the basics, here are a few tips to make your visual novel stand out:</p><p>Great visual novels are driven by compelling stories. Develop deep, relatable characters and create an engaging narrative that keeps the player invested. The power of a visual novel lies in its ability to connect emotionally with players.</p><p>Visual novels rely heavily on artwork and music to set the tone. Good visuals and sound can elevate your storytelling to new heights. Whether you're an artist or working with a team, make sure your assets complement your story.</p><p>Once you have the basic structure of your visual novel, go back and refine it. Customize the user interface, add smooth transitions, and tweak the audio to create a more polished experience.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  6. How Long Does It Take to Learn Ren'Py?\n</h2><p>How long it takes to learn Ren'Py depends on your prior experience and how much time you can dedicate to learning. If you’re starting from scratch, expect to spend a few weeks getting comfortable with the basics. However, with dedicated effort, you can create a simple visual novel within a month.</p><p>For those who want to accelerate their learning, my <a href=\"https://www.udemy.com/course/mastering-renpy-create-visual-novels-like-a-pro/?referralCode=9A4732B0C1A919F10AA6&amp;couponCode=ST3MT200225B\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Udemy course</a> is designed to help you get up to speed quickly.

Essentially, it’s a mutex that ensures only one thread executes Python bytecode at a time, protecting internal data structures—especially the reference counting used by the garbage collector—from race conditions. .</p><p>Excitingly, Python 3.13 is the first release featuring an experimental build mode that disables the GIL, opening the door to significant performance improvements for multi-threaded applications.</p><p>Before discussing these new changes, let’s do a quick recap of the pros and cons of the GIL.</p><p>The GIL offers several advantages, including:</p><ul><li><strong>Simplified Memory Management</strong>: By blocking threads from concurrently modifying an object’s reference count, the GIL prevents race conditions and ensures the garbage collector doesn’t free an object while it’s still referenced, making the core implementation simpler and more robust.</li><li><strong>Ease of C Extension Integration</strong>: Many C libraries and extensions, which are not inherently thread-safe, can be used safely under the GIL’s protection.</li><li><strong>Single-thread Performance</strong>: Since CPython uses reference counting for memory management, the garbage collector has minimal impact compared to mark-and-sweep algorithms used in languages - ex: Java -, which can be unpredictable and cause pauses.</li></ul><p>But if only one thread can use the interpreter at a given time, how does Python run multiple threads?</p><p>Thread switching is a complex topic; even the interpreter doesn’t always decide which thread runs next, as the operating system also influences scheduling. In this blog, we will focus solely on the Python side of thread management.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  what happens when a thread holds the GIL?\n</h3><p>When a thread holds the GIL, it may encounter one of the following scenarios:</p><ul><li>If it reaches an I/O task, the thread willingly releases the lock while waiting, allowing other threads to run.</li><li>During CPU-intensive operations, the lock is automatically released after a defined timeout (typically 5ms).</li></ul><p>Now that we understand how thread switching works, it’s clear that one of the main downsides of the GIL is limited true multi-threaded parallelism in CPU-bound programs. Removing the GIL requires a solution that grants safe, concurrent access to objects and memory management without compromising single-thread performance.</p><p>Sam Gross, the author of <a href=\"https://peps.python.org/pep-0703/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">PEP 703</a>, has proposed an ingenious solution to remove the GIL from CPython while ensuring thread safety. The proposal rethinks CPython’s memory management and introduces three key techniques:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Biased Reference Counting</strong>:\nMany objects are primarily modified by a single thread, so biased reference counting lets that thread update an object’s reference count without atomic overhead. If another thread intervenes, the system safely falls back to slower, thread-safe operations—optimizing the common single-threaded case.</p></li><li><p><strong>Deferred Reference Counting</strong>:\nFor objects like top-level functions, code objects, modules, and methods that are accessed concurrently, deferred reference counting postpones immediate atomic updates. It batches reference count changes to reduce contention, thereby minimizing overhead for dynamic objects that aren’t immortal.</p></li><li><p>:\nCertain objects—such as interned strings, small integers, PyTypeObjects, and the True, False, and None—live for the duration of the program. These are marked as immortal (their reference count is set to UINT32_MAX), so Py_INCREF and Py_DECREF become no-ops, avoiding contention when accessed by multiple threads.</p></li></ul><p>Together, these techniques pave the way for enhanced parallelism and a more efficient, concurrent CPython.</p><p>From the Steering Council’s notice about the adoption of PEP 703:</p><blockquote><ul><li>:\nWe will add the no-GIL build as an experimental build mode, presumably in Python 3.13 (if it slips to 3.14, that is not a problem). The build mode is experimental to clarify that, although the core developers support it, we cannot expect the community to adopt it immediately. We need time to determine the necessary changes in API design, packaging, and distribution, and we want to discourage distributors from shipping the experimental no-GIL build as the default interpreter.</li><li>:\nOnce there is sufficient community support for production use of no-GIL, we will support the no-GIL build—but not as the default—while setting a target date or Python version for making it the default. This timing will depend on factors such as backward compatibility of API changes (e.g., the stable ABI) and the remaining work identified by the community. We expect this phase to take at least a year or two, possibly more. Some distributors may start shipping no-GIL by default, though this will vary with package support.</li><li>:\nOur goal is for no-GIL to become the default, eventually removing any vestiges of the GIL without unnecessarily breaking backward compatibility. We do not want to maintain two common build modes indefinitely, as this can double testing resources and debugging efforts. However, the transition cannot be rushed and may take as much as five years.</li></ul></blockquote><p>The move to remove the GIL marks a major evolution in CPython’s design. By rethinking memory management with biased and deferred reference counting, plus immortal objects, PEP 703 offers a practical path to better multi-threaded performance without losing single-thread efficiency. As Python gradually shifts toward a no-GIL future, we can look forward to an interpreter that’s more capable on today’s multi-core systems.</p>","contentLength":5509,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"## Master Django Redirects in Under 3 Minutes 🚀","url":"https://dev.to/ebereplenty/-master-django-redirects-in-under-3-minutes-4f6","date":1740082395,"author":"NJOKU SAMSON EBERE","guid":7422,"unread":true,"content":"<p>Django provides a powerful way to redirect users from one page to another using the  function.

That little snippet of code at the top of the script is like a preamble, a clearing of the throat before the real business begins. What purpose does it serve? Well, the header is a kind of introduction, letting the reader know what's to come with some basic information.</p><blockquote><p><em>Let the Code be governed by a singular, mighty function</em></p></blockquote><p>Ah, the main() function - now there's a topic! It's like the heart and soul of your code, the place where everything comes together. See, when you're working on a code project, it's like you're building a big machine, right? And the main() function, well, that's the control panel, the place where you pull all the levers and push all the buttons to make the whole thing rock. In order to use that machine, you gotta follow a certain set of steps right? Turn the key, check the fuel, prime the pump.. Well, that's what the main() function is all about - it's the sequence of events that gets your code up and running.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  The parameters, guardians of function\n</h3><blockquote><p><em>Each one a gatekeeper, ensuring the proper flow of information.</em></p></blockquote><p>Parameters are those little vessels that carry the lifeblood of our functions.\nNow, I know what you're thinkin' - \"But George, how do I know which one to use?\" Well, my friend, it all comes down to the task at hand.<p>\nIf you're dealing with a relatively simple setup like here, them variables-as-parameters might be just the ticket you need. But if you're working on somethin' a little more complex, with all sorts of moving parts and interdependencies, well, them classes, they're the way to go. Classes, are the real MVPs of the bunch, and they will help keeping everything organized and running smooth as silk.</p></p><h3>\n  \n  \n  The docstrings, the illuminating scrolls\n</h3><blockquote><p><em>Where the function's purpose, its workings, and its returns are documented.</em></p></blockquote><p>Alright, people, let me tell you about these things called docstrings. Now, I know what you're thinking - \"Docstrings? What in the Sam Hill are those?\" Let me break it down for you.\nThese docstrings, they're like little notes, little snippets of information that you tack on to your code, just to give folks a heads up on what's going on. It's like when you're doing some work around the house, and you leave a little note for the neighbour, just to let ‘em know what you're up to.<p>\nNow, these docstrings, they come in all shapes and sizes. But the way I see it, these docstrings, they're not just about the code, no sir. They're about the people too. So, when you write one of these things, you're not just explaining what the code does, you're telling a story. You're givin' people a little glimpse into your mind and your thought process. And this makes </p> difference because on bigger projects, we all know you will never code alone.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Type hints as vigilant sentinels\n</h3><blockquote><p><em>Ensuring the integrity of the data.</em></p></blockquote><p>Listen up, I'm about to let you in on a little secret when it comes to this Python business. It's all about them type hints, they're guardrails that keep you from taking a wrong turn by telling your fellow programmers, \"hey, this is what I'm expecting here, so don't go messing it up, y'hear?\"\nSee, these type hints, they're some kind of guardians of your program, keeping a watchful eye to make sure you don't go trying to mix apples and oranges, so to speak. When you're dealing with a language as flexible as Python, that's a darn good thing to have in your corner.

In the realm of the browser, a puppet is forged\n</h3><blockquote><p>Where the mighty browser is bound to our will, as if by sorcery.</p></blockquote><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>First up, we've got this  business. Now, I know what you're thinking - \"George, what in the world is a driver service?\" Well, let me tell you, it's the piece of code that's gonna make this whole Selenium thing work. It's like a bridge between our script and the middleman, I name the ! And after that service is up, the gecko’s gonna turn our Firefox into a nice .\nAnd where do we get this driver service, you ask? From the , of course! That's the path to the executable that's gonna make Firefox dance to our tune. Do you know what else it's gonna do? It's gonna log everything that's happening, right into the  file. That way, if anything goes sideways, we can take a peek under the hood and see why’s that.\nNow, the options. See, we're creating a shiny new set of , and we're gonna deck them out with some goodies. First up, we're pointing it to the , making sure we've got the right browser to work with.\nAnd then, if that  variable is set to True, we're gonna add a little  argument to the mix. That means the browser's gonna run without a visible window, stealthier than your average ninja. No need for all the bells and whistles (and windows), we're just here to get the job done, right?\nAnd finally, we're wrapping it all up by returning a brand-spankin' new instance of the , complete with our custom service and options. This one's like a well-oiled machine, and we're the ones behind the wheel.\nJust remember: if you ever find yourself scratching your head, wondering what in the world is going on, just take a peek at that  file. It's like a crystal ball, and it might tell you everything you need to know.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  II. The opening of the file\n</h3><blockquote><p>Like an ancient tome unveiling its secrets.</p></blockquote><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Alright, folks, gather 'round, because we're about to dive into some more of this code. Now, this right here, this is the kind of stuff that separates the wheat from the chaff.\nFirst up, we've got this  block. Now, I know what you're thinking: \"George, what in the world is a  block?\" Well, let me tell you, it's the statement that’s gonna keep us from running headfirst into a brick wall every time something goes wrong. And trust me, in the universe of programming, something's always going wrong.\nSee, what we're doing here is we're trying to open a file, right? And we're using this fancy-schmancy  function to do it. And that's where the  block comes in.\nIf everything goes according to plan, and the file is there, waiting for us with open arms, we're gonna read the contents and hand 'em back, no problem.  \"But George, what could possibly go wrong?\" Well, my friends, the world is a cruel and unpredictable place ( when you’re learning software development), and sometimes, those files, they just up and disappear. But don't you worry, we've got a plan and that's where the  block comes in.\nIf that  rears its ugly head, we're gonna print out a nice, friendly message, letting the user know that the file they were looking for is.. not there..\nIt's like a safety net, a way to keep the wheels from falling off even when the road gets a little bumpy. And you know what they say, \"the more you plan for the unexpected, the less unexpected it becomes.\" Or something like that.. I don't know, I'm just making it up as I go along.</p><p>Anyway, the point is when life hands you lemons, you make lemonade. And when life hands you , you just smile ;)</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  III. Sentence splitting action unleashed\n</h3><blockquote><p>The fellowship of words is broken.</p></blockquote><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Okay, listen up, because we're about to dive into some serious sentence-splitting action.\nNow, you might be looking at this line of code and thinking: \"what in the world is going on here?\" Well, let me tell you, it's a thing of beauty: we're taking this text that we've been handed, and we're gonna break it down into its individual sentences.<p>\nAnd how are we doing it, you ask? With the power of regular expressions (</p>) and its  implementation, that's how. \"But George, what's a regular expression?\" Well, my friends, it's a language all its own, a way of describing patterns in ways that would make your head spin. You can tinker with it <a href=\"https://regex101.com/r/rsVgaP/1\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">here</a>.\nBut don't worry, we're not gonna get too deep into the weeds here. All you need to know is that this little regular expression is the key to our success. It's gonna look for those periods, question marks, and exclamation marks, and it's gonna use them as the boundaries to split our text into individual sentences. But careful, this regex has its limits, see, every language is like a delicate little dance, with each word and phrase movin' in perfect harmony. Some Pros, they’re like aware of that more than us so they built up nice little tools using carefully crafted and more accurate natural language processing (NLP)  formulas (for example you can experiment with the <a href=\"https://www.nltk.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">nltk</a> library). For the sake of simplicity, let’s stick to the basics with the regex way.</p><p>The next time you find yourself staring at a wall of text, wondering how in the world you're gonna make sense of it all, just remember this little line of code and no more trying to figure out where one sentence ends and the next one begins. And who knows, maybe one day, you'll be the one writing the regular expressions turning chaos of strings into order.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  IV. The forging of the chunks\n</h3><blockquote><p>The awakening of mighty blocks of text.</p></blockquote><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Hmm, we're about to dive into some serious text-chunking action now. You see, we've got this text that we need to translate, but we can't just send the whole thing off to the translation service all at once. Nah, that would be way too easy. Instead, we've gotta break it down into manageable chunks, little bite-sized pieces that the service can handle without breaking a sweat. That's where this  function comes in handy. It's like a master chef, carefully slicing and dicing the text, making sure each piece is the perfect size.\nFirst, we set up a little , a fancy data structure that's gonna help us keeping track of the current chunk.</p><blockquote><p>A , that's just a  way of saying double-ended queue, obviously we deal with small amounts of data here but I wanted to give a try to this exotic thing. Your less sophisticated arrays would work fine there too. Just remember that usual  and  methods don’t perform fast on items on the opposite side of the line. So Python’s  module provides that class called deque that’s specially designed to provide fast and memory-efficient ways to append and pop item from both ends.</p></blockquote><p>And then, we start looping through the sentences of the \"text\" block  (we provided it as an argument when we called the function), and for each sentence, we're gonna figure out its length, -including the space character at the end.\nNow, you might be wondering, \"But George, how do you know when to start a new chunk?\" Well, my friends, it's all about that  variable and the one called  that we use as a counter to keep a running tally of the length of the current chunk. If the current sentence is gonna fit within the chunk size character limit, well, we're just gonna add it on and update the chunk length accordingly. That’s the normal way to go. Got it?\nNow, if the length of the current sentence, plus the length of the chunk we've got so far, pushes us  the character limit we've set, well, we're gonna do a few things. First, we're gonna take all the sentences in the chunk and join 'em up with spaces, and then we're gonna yield that beasty. That just means we're gonna spit it out and move on to a new chunk.\nMoving on to the next chunk means we're gonna clear out the chunk variable and start fresh, adding the current sentence to it and resetting the chunk length to just the length of that sentence, and then, just like before, we’ll keep rolling until we hit the limit again.<p>\nFinally, after we've gone through all the sentences, we're gonna yield the last chunk, if there is one.</p></p><p>That’s it for our symphony of text-chunking perfection. And who knows.. maybe you'll even find yourself singing the praises of them deques and character limits soon.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  V. Print statements illuminate the path\n</h3><blockquote><p>The chronicles of progress are Written.</p></blockquote><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Alright, but George, why do we need all these print statements? Isn't the script just supposed to, you know, just work?\"\nWell see, we've got this script that's doing all sorts of stuff, translating text and whatnot. But how are we supposed to know if it's working, huh? That's where these print statements come in, my friends, they're like the canaries in the coal mine. They're the early warning system that's gonna deal us some intel to let us know something's gone awry.<p>\nWe're gonna print out the length of the input text. Because let's be real, how are we supposed to know if this thing is working if we don't know how much text we're dealing with, am I right? It's like trying to bake a cake without knowing how much flour you've got. There's more.. We're also gonna print out the number of chunks that the script has generated. And to top it all off, we're gonna print out the length of each of those chunks. Because, honestly, who doesn't love a good old-fashioned character count? It's like a little treasure hunt, but instead of finding gold, we're finding out how many letters are in each sentence.</p>\nA little  for when you will be contributing to bigger projects: there is that other breed of statements called . They're the quiet ones, they slip in the back door and get the job done without all the fanfare of the print. Just keep in mind they're the ones that keep a careful  when things start to get a little hairy.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  VI. The sorcery of the selectors\n</h3><blockquote><p>Their spell cast the way.</p></blockquote><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Now it’s time to jump into some serious Selenium wizardry.</p><p><a href=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2F582dkzvjknbphi4nxa9m.png\"><img src=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2F582dkzvjknbphi4nxa9m.png\" title=\"A screenshot showing the input field of deepL's website.\" alt=\"DeepL website's input field\" width=\"800\" height=\"336\"></a><em>The input field our marionette will search for.</em>\nYou see, we've got this input field that we need to find on the web page, and we can't just go barging in there, hoping it'll be there. Instead, we've gotta harness the power of Selenium, which is gonna help us navigate this digital bytescape.<p>\nTo understand this whole pasta here, We need to know more about’em selectors. See, when you're coding a website, just like a building, you got all sorts of elements fitting together - your headings, your paragraphs, buttons, an' the like. Each one of those elements, it's got its own little personality, just like a set of traits and characteristics. And to identify them, you can use all sorts of different selectors:  element selectors, class selectors, ID selectors, and many more other lads. Find out more </p><a href=\"https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/trysel.php\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">here</a>.</p><p>That's where this <code>get_input_textarea_element()</code> function comes in. It's like a secret agent, carefully scanning the page, looking for that elusive  where you insert the text you want to translate.\nBut there’s a challenge to it: what's the point of finding the input field if it's not even ready for us to use? So first, we create a  object, and we instruct it to wait for up to  seconds (we've set it at the beginning as a parameter, by the way) for the element to be loaded and clickable thanks to this intriguing <code>EC.element_to_be_clickable()</code> thing that tells Selenium exactly what we're looking for. In this case, we're saying, \"Hey, Selenium, find me an element that's clickable, and it's gotta match this . But.. how did I found that damn selector we've got here? Well, invoke the inspector by hitting  in Firefox. Then try the  combo, point &amp; clic your target and in the inspector you'll be able to right clic the highlighted piece of code and extract its info.</p><p>Concretely we’re looking to mimic human behavior just like when you paste your first chunk of text. Let’s break it down again:</p><ul><li>You select the input field by clicking on it (it’s selected).</li><li>Depending of your laziness level, either you start typing or you just paste some text into that area.</li></ul><p>Well, our driver should be instructed to do the same.\nNow, I know what you're thinking, \"But George, what if the element never becomes clickable? What then?\" Well, friends, that's where the  comes to the rescue. If the element doesn't become clickable within the  period, the whole thing is gonna throw an exception, and we'll know that something's gone wrong. Maybe the website has been updated and our old CSS selector pal is no more, or a networking problem occured somewhere. Whatever.\nIf everything goes according to plan, and Selenium manages to find that input field and confirm that it's ready for us to use, well, that's when the wonder happens. We're gonna return that element, and the rest of the script is gonna be able to work its magic.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  VII. The bridge of translation is crossed\n</h3><blockquote><p>Meaning is conveyed across the void.</p></blockquote><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Alright, friends, gather 'round, because we're about to witness the main event, the grand finale and the moment you've all been waiting for - the translation process! Now, I know what you're thinking, \"But George, how in the world is this script gonna take all those chunks of text and turn them into a beautiful translation?\" Well, my friends, watch out.</p><p>First, we're gonna set up an empty list called . Our little treasure trove of linguistic gold. This is where we're gonna store all the translated chunks.\nAnd then, we're gonna start looping through those chunks, one by one. Now, I know what you're thinking, \"But George, how are we gonna keep track of which chunk we're on?\" Well, that's where the  function comes in, my friends. It's gonna give us the  of each chunk, so we can keep tabs on our progress.\nAs we loop through each chunk, we're gonna print out a little separator, just to let the user know that we're hard at work. And then, we're gonna send that chunk of text to the input field, using the  method. It's like we're typing the text over to the translation service, saying, \"Here, take a look at this! A new text chunk for you to translate.\"\nBut we can't just sit back and wait, oh no, that would be way too easy. Instead, we're gonna print out a little message, letting the user know that we're fetching the translation. And then, we're gonna hit the  function, giving the translation service some time to achieve its task.\nWhen the time is up, we're gonna use Selenium again to find the output area on the web page, and we're gonna grab the text that's been translated by now. We're talking about pure algorithmic alchemy, folks, turning one language into another with the click of a button. The thing there is just that we’re not behind the wheels anymore.<p>\nSo once we've put our hands on that translated chunk, we're gonna append it to our translation list. And then, just to be on the safe side, we're gonna clear out the input field, making sure we're ready for the next chunk.</p>\nWhen we've gone through all the chunks, and collected all those translated gems, we're gonna return the whole  list  which is the result of all the translations we’ve collected.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  VIII. The file is written\n</h3><blockquote><p>The chronicle of the realm is inscribed.</p></blockquote><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>The last step starts by calling , and let me tell you, it's one of the unsung hero of this whole operation. Because, let's be honest, what's the point of all this translation process if we can't actually, you know, save the results somewhere?\nSo, here's how it works. First, we're gonna open up a file, using that  statement. And let me tell you, that , it's like a handshake that tells Python, \"Hey, I'm about to do some serious file-handling business, so don't you dare interrupt me!\" And what are we gonna do with this file, you ask? Well, my friends, we're gonna write some text to it. But not just any text, oh no, we're talking about the fruits of our labor, the translated chunks that we've been slaving over for who knows how long.\nNow, I know what you're thinking, \"But George, how are we gonna get all those chunks into the file?\" Well, that's where the  function comes in. It's like a magic wand, taking our list of translated chunks and turning them into a cohesive piece of writing. When that file finally gets saved, it's gonna be all those chunks of text, neatly packaged up into a tangible reality: a file!\nBut you know, it's not just about the end result, folks. It's about the journey, the process of getting there. And this  function, was the final step in that journey. A cherry on top, mic drop moment that says, \"We did it, folks, we translated the heck out of that text!\"</p><ul><li>Managing files (<em>loading a source file and writing results into another one</em>).</li><li>Witnessing that the true sorcery of this tutorial lies in the automated process of translating a text by <em>splitting it into sentences</em>, stacking them into  sent one by one to the <em>online translation service</em>, through Selenium, without ever exceeding a </li><li>And the <a href=\"https://dev.to/atomictangerline/basic-selenium-bonus-41dp\">goodies</a>: raise a glass to the coder's toolkit, by implementing some good practices <em>(using a header, organizing the code using functions, parameters and a main(), use docstrings and type hints)</em>.</li></ul><p>That's just the beginning, isn't it?

The possibilities, they're practically endless, my friends. <strong>So I want you to take this code, tinker with it, experiment, see what else you can make it do</strong>. You’re ready to go.\nTry it out on different translation services, see how it handles the variations. Heck, see if you can make it do your taxes while you're at it (okay, maybe not that, but you get the idea). The point is, this is tip of the iceberg. So, what are you waiting for?

Well, functions, they make your code a whole lot easier to read and understand. I mean, think about it: instead of trying to decipher a tangled web of spaghetti code, you got these nice, neat little packages that do one thing and do it well. And when you need to make a change, well, you just gotta tweak the function, and b-a-m, problem solved. No muss, no fuss.</p><p> Embrace 'em, you love 'em. Trust me, your future self is gonna thank you for it.</p></blockquote><p>First, let's have a look at this  version of the main function:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><h3>\n  \n  \n  The Initialization of the Browser\n</h3><blockquote><p><em>In which the Selenium-forged steed is summoned, and the journey begins.</em></p></blockquote><p>First, we've got the  function.

No need for a window to appear, we're going full stealth mode here.</p><blockquote><p><em>Where the words are divided into manageable chunks, as if by the wisdom of the regex.</em></p></blockquote><p>Next, we've got . This one's pretty straightforward - it's just reading the contents of a file and handing us back the text.\nThen there's <code>split_text_into_sentences()</code>. This is where the script takes that input text and breaks it down into individual sentences. Gotta make sure we're not overwhelming the translation service, you know? Bite-sized chunks are the way to go.\nAnd speaking of those chunks, that's where  comes in. It's taking those sentences and slicing them, making sure each sentence-block is small enough to play nice with the translation service. No more hitting character limits.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  The Gathering of the Fields\n</h3><blockquote><p><em>In which the input field is sought and found.</em></p></blockquote><p>Now, the real showstoppers: <code>get_input_textarea_element()</code>. This is the function that use Selenium to find the right spot on the web page to do our work. I mean the input field, where we're gonna pour in our text.

But trust me, it's worth it. Once you've got all that squared away, you're gonna be almost ready to start automating like never before.</p><p>Alright, folks, time to dive into the nitty-gritty of this configuration stuff. Because let me tell you, if you don't get this part right, the whole thing's gonna be about as useful as.. a lawn mower in the middle of the Mojave.\nFirst up, we've got those  and  variables. Now, I know what you're thinking - \"But how in the world am I supposed to know where these things are hiding on my system?\" Well, fellas, depending on the one you’re looking for, there's a little bash command you can run to ferret that out:</p><p>About the Gecko.. Remember that installation process we went through earlier? Well, the path you set up there is the one you'll want to use here. Not sure about it? No problem, same sauce, Just run:</p><p>And Zap! Paste that info into the right place. Easy, right?\nNow, the  parameter - this one's a bit of a wild card. See, you can run this whole thing in headless mode, which means the browser will run and do its job but won't actually show up on your screen. Kinda like a ninja, you know? But if you want to see what's going on, and watch your Firefox acting like possessed by a spirit you can set it to  and watch the magic unfold – try and see.</p><p>As for the  and , well, pretty self-explanatory. Just pick the languages you want to translate to (source) and from (output), and the script will handle the rest.

Tinker with them as needed, but be careful - you don't want to break the whole machine.\nThe  and  - those are the ones you'll want to point to your own input and output files. Simple enough, right? Just make sure you're pointing the input to something that actually contains text, because that's what this script is built to handle.\nNow, a quick word of warning – the script is not perfect - if the output file doesn't exist yet, the script's gonna go ahead and create it for you. But if it does exist, well, buckle up, because the script's gonna overwrite it every time you run it. So, you know, maybe keep an eye on that (and specify a different output each time) if you don’t want to see your previous achievements disappear..</p><blockquote><p>Wait.. I almost forgot..

It enables efficient data extraction, manipulation, and analysis, making it a crucial tool in the data science workflow. However, even experienced data professionals often make avoidable mistakes when working with SQL, leading to performance issues, inaccurate results, or inefficient queries.</p>\n\n<p>If you're looking to sharpen your SQL skills and advance your career in data science, enrolling in the data science course can help you master SQL while avoiding these common pitfalls.</p>\n\n<p>Why SQL is Important in Data Science</p>\n\n<p>Before diving into the common mistakes, it’s essential to understand why SQL plays a vital role in data science. SQL allows data scientists to:</p>\n\n<p>Retrieve, filter, and aggregate data efficiently.</p>\n\n<p>Clean and preprocess raw data before analysis.</p>\n\n<p>Join multiple datasets for a comprehensive view.</p>\n\n<p>Optimize queries for performance in big data scenarios.</p>\n\n<p>Implement database best practices in production environments.</p>\n\n<p>Despite its importance, many data scientists fall into common SQL traps that impact their workflow and results.</p>\n\n<p>Common SQL Mistakes and How to Avoid Them</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Ignoring Indexing for Performance Optimization</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>One of the most frequent mistakes data scientists make is not considering indexing, which can lead to slow query performance. Without indexes, databases perform full table scans, slowing down execution times.</p>\n\n<p>Understanding indexing strategies and knowing when to use them is crucial for efficient SQL query performance.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Using SELECT * Instead of Specifying Columns</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>A common habit, especially among beginners, is using SELECT * instead of specifying the required columns. This can lead to unnecessary data retrieval, increasing query execution time and memory usage.</p>\n\n<p>Optimizing queries by selecting only the needed columns helps in improving efficiency and readability.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Not Handling NULL Values Properly</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Many data scientists overlook how NULL values behave in SQL queries, which can result in incorrect aggregations or filtering issues. Handling NULL values appropriately using functions like COALESCE() ensures accurate results.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Writing Inefficient Joins</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Joins are fundamental in SQL, yet many data scientists struggle with them. Poorly written joins can lead to slow queries and incorrect results. Understanding the differences between INNER, LEFT, RIGHT, and FULL OUTER JOIN can prevent unnecessary data duplication or data loss.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Forgetting to Use Proper Data Types</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Using incorrect data types in SQL can cause performance bottlenecks and memory inefficiencies. Ensuring that each column is assigned the correct data type improves storage efficiency and query execution speed.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Overusing Subqueries Instead of Common Table Expressions (CTEs)</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Excessive use of subqueries can lead to complex and slow queries. Instead, using Common Table Expressions (CTEs) enhances readability and maintains performance while breaking down complex queries.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Not Utilizing Window Functions</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Window functions allow advanced calculations across partitions of data. Ignoring them and relying on basic aggregate functions can lead to repetitive queries. Learning how to use window functions improves query efficiency and analysis depth.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Misusing GROUP BY and Aggregations</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Many data scientists mistakenly use GROUP BY without fully understanding its implications, leading to incorrect summaries. Ensuring that grouping aligns with business logic prevents data discrepancies.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Ignoring Query Execution Plans</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Databases provide execution plans that help in analyzing query performance. Ignoring these plans often leads to unoptimized queries. Understanding how to interpret execution plans helps in fine-tuning SQL queries.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Not Testing Queries on Small Sample Data</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Running queries on full datasets without testing on a smaller subset first can lead to inefficiencies. Testing on smaller datasets helps in debugging issues before scaling up.</p>\n\n<p>How to Improve Your SQL Skills</p>\n\n<p>To avoid these mistakes, continuous learning and hands-on practice are necessary. If you're serious about mastering SQL for data science, enrolling in the best data science course in Mumbai will provide:</p>\n\n<p>Comprehensive SQL training covering fundamental and advanced concepts.</p>\n\n<p>Hands-on projects to gain real-world experience.</p>\n\n<p>Industry expert guidance to navigate complex data problems.</p>\n\n<p>Career support and networking opportunities to secure top job roles.</p>\n\n<p>Conclusion</p>\n\n<p>SQL is an indispensable tool for data scientists, but making common mistakes can hinder efficiency and accuracy. By understanding and avoiding these pitfalls, data professionals can enhance their querying skills and deliver better insights.</p>\n\n<p>If you're looking to refine your SQL skills and accelerate your data science career, consider joining the <a href=\"https://bostoninstituteofanalytics.org/india/mumbai/andheri/school-of-technology-ai/data-science-and-artificial-intelligence/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">best data science course in Mumbai</a> today.

What’s up with that? Big names like 2captcha have scrubbed any mention of bypassing hCaptcha from their playbook. A flurry of edgy tweets—and even some official statements—hints that the game has changed. Let’s cut through the BS: why did 2captcha drop the ball, and what’s solvecaptcha got up its sleeve to reinvent the bypass hCaptcha?</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Ftqksoxxi8022jz4psgk8.jpg\" class=\"article-body-image-wrapper\"><img src=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Ftqksoxxi8022jz4psgk8.jpg\" alt=\"Image description\" width=\"519\" height=\"148\"></a><br>\n<a href=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fhxo9alf2pm2mlgtl9exn.jpg\" class=\"article-body-image-wrapper\"><img src=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fhxo9alf2pm2mlgtl9exn.jpg\" alt=\"Image description\" width=\"800\" height=\"1049\"></a></p>\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  The Backlash: When “Don’t bypass Our Captcha” Became a Thing\n</h2>\n\n<p>It’s not just 2captcha getting the heat; Capsolver’s been in the crosshairs too. Rumor has it that someone slammed them with a “don’t solve our captcha” memo. We can only guess the real reasons, but my street-smart instincts point to a simple complaint. Even if the big guys aren’t bypass hCaptcha anymore, the hunger for captcha-breaking tools isn’t going anywhere.</p>\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  Is There a Way Out Without the Industry Giants?\n</h2>\n\n<p>Truth is, hCaptcha has always been a pain to crack—even when the mainstream players had solutions up their sleeves. This monster comes in multiple difficulty levels, each with its own twists and checks that make it tough to outsmart. No wonder standard automated solvers rarely hit the mark—a process some nostalgically refer to as “probing” (yep, a term that’s been around since the early 2020s).</p>\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  What’s hCaptcha Anyway? The Real Lowdown\n</h2>\n\n<p>For anyone still living under a rock: hCaptcha is basically the rebellious cousin of reCaptcha. At first glance, they’re nearly twins, using similar methods to throw puzzles at you. The twist? hCaptcha ramps up the challenge with different token validation servers and a significantly higher difficulty—especially in its hardest mode. In short, it’s reCaptcha on steroids.</p>\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  The DIY Python hCaptcha Solver in Action\n</h2>\n\n<p>Enough chatter—here’s the real deal. I resurrected an old Python hack I once used to bypass hCaptcha, polished it up, and now it’s back in the game.

Booting Up and Loading the Page</strong><br>\nThe script kicks off by firing up Chrome via Selenium WebDriver to hit your target URL. In the demo, I ran it across three different pages showcasing hCaptcha in its easiest, middling, and downright savage modes.</p>\n\n<p><strong>2. Snatching the Sitekey</strong><br>\nEvery hCaptcha-laden page carries a unique <code>data-sitekey</code>—its secret sauce. The script waits for this element to pop up and then snags its value on the fly. This trick means it can work on nearly any site using hCaptcha. If it flubs, you might need to play detective with the page’s code.</p>\n\n<p><strong>3. Calling in the API Reinforcements</strong><br>\nArmed with the sitekey, the script sends a POST request to the API endpoint (<a href=\"https://api.solvecaptcha.com/in.php\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://api.solvecaptcha.com/in.php</a>), packing in your API key, the method (\"hcaptcha\"), the sitekey, the full page URL, and a flag to get a JSON response. The API fires back a unique captcha ID—your ticket to tracking the solution.</p>\n\n<p><strong>4. Waiting for the Hack to Land</strong><br>\nWith the captcha ID in hand, the script enters a loop, hammering the API with GET requests to see if the solution is ready. If it gets a “CAPCHA_NOT_READY” reply, it chills for 5 seconds before trying again. Once the magic happens, the API returns the solution token along with a useragent string.</p>\n\n<p><strong>5. Slapping the Token into the Page</strong><br>\nOnce the token is ready, the script checks for the hidden fields (<code>h-captcha-response</code> and <code>g-recaptcha-response</code>). If they’re missing, it conjures them up with some JavaScript and then plugs in the token—tricking the site into thinking the captcha is solved.</p>\n\n<p><strong>6. Extra Provocative Visuals</strong><br>\nFor that extra splash of flair, the script also drops a bold banner reading “Captcha Solved!” right on the page. Not a fan? Feel free to comment it out. And if you want the form to auto-submit after cracking the captcha, just uncomment the relevant line.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://youtu.be/VuC9OpDvlO0\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"></a></p>\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  The Bottom Line\n</h2>\n\n<p>This script is a no-nonsense, edgy solution for bypassing hCaptcha—proving once again that no captcha is truly unbreakable.

This \"batteries included\" motto was well known and described in <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20120420010049/http://www.python.org/about/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">the Python about page</a>.</p>\n\n<p>But today it's clear to me that including batteries in a coding language is a deadly flaw. Because of the packaging hurdle and because of library rot. Details follow.</p>\n\n<h1>\n  \n  \n  Why include libraries? Why have a larger standard library?\n</h1>\n\n<p>Batteries included implies that you don't need to worry about downloading or depending on external packages to get stuff done. You can just go. Yes, with Python I did many times find myself productive without worrying about downloading packages. No <code>npm install</code> or <code>go get</code> necessary.</p>\n\n<p>Another important benefit of batteries included is that they make libraries more likely to be interoperable. Packages want to support standard library usage patterns and types. It's better if there's an official <code>set</code> and <code>Promise</code> so there isn't an ecosystem battle over such things.</p>\n\n<h1>\n  \n  \n  The rotting flaw\n</h1>\n\n<p>The problem with including libraries in Python is that the language itself has to evolve carefully and slowly. But what happens when inevitably there's a new way to do something? A new and better library is created - and now the batteries you included are suboptimal this year, and a decade later your batteries are actual trash you lug around.</p>\n\n<p>Backwards compatibility is critical. I don't want to fix my code once a year when the new Python version rolls out. Moving from Python 2 to 3 sucked for everyone. Even the main language designer Guido was still <a href=\"https://youtu.be/Oiw23yfqQy8?si=WSWoAFXprdp5dmPA&amp;t=1520\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">talking about the painful transition</a> 10 years later.</p>\n\n<p>So you can't just rip out a standard library and replace it with a new one. If you include a library in your core language distribution - you're either married to it for FOREVER, or you've come to terms with eventually causing your users great pain in updates of old code they don't remember they wrote.</p>\n\n<h1>\n  \n  \n  Rotting examples\n</h1>\n\n<p>Python's standard library has 3 option parsing libraries: <code>getopt</code>, <code>optparse</code>, and <code>argparse</code>. I personally voted to include <code>argparse</code> because at the time I thought that was a good idea.</p>\n\n<p>Python includes the <code>urllib.request</code> module though most folks nowadays prefer the <code>requests</code> library for making HTTP requests.</p>\n\n<p>There are a few xml parsing libraries in the standard library I'm aware of (<code>xml.dom.minidom</code>, <code>xml.sax</code>, <code>xml.parsers.expat</code>, <code>etree</code>) but folks today often go for <code>BeautifulSoup</code>.</p>\n\n<p>I'm sure there are many more examples.</p>\n\n<h1>\n  \n  \n  The packaging hurdle\n</h1>\n\n<p>Aside from the eventual rot of libraries - coders that rely on included batteries are incentivized to avoid the packaging system entirely if they can. That's the whole value you get out of the batteries, right? So your helloworld app does not include a \"get packages\" step. But then that results in fewer developers engaging with the packaging system.</p>\n\n<p>But packaging is really where every piece of software ends up. By incentivizing devs to avoid it, by causing devs to want to use the batteries, we are getting a less battle-tested, and lower quality packaging system.</p>\n\n<h1>\n  \n  \n  Counter-argument - the JS package explosion\n</h1>\n\n<p>Almost every package you <code>npm install</code> today will cause thousands of files and dependencies to show up in your <code>node_modules</code> folder. If Python's standard library didn't have a <code>math</code> module then every complicated enough package would end up having to depend on all of the popular math packages transitively because each dependency might use a different one. I'm not sure how to incentivize library creators to reduce this problem.</p>\n\n<h1>\n  \n  \n  The confusing state of Python packaging\n</h1>\n\n<p>What happens when I <code>import abc</code>? I honestly don't know. The package <code>abc</code> might be a local file (<code>py</code> or <code>pyc</code>) or folder in my <code>$PATH</code>, next to my script, pip-installed, or already somehow in memory.</p>\n\n<p>What is <code>import abc.xyz</code>? Is <code>xyz</code> a function in the package? A sub-folder?</p>\n\n<p>This isn't just confusing for the user, it's also confusing for the library builders setting up their package for distribution, and for package system authors.</p>\n\n<p>Setting up a package for distribution in Python, and downloading packages is terribly complicated. I love NodeJS's <code>npm</code> even though it has its own flaws and competitors. Everyone agrees to use <code>package.json</code> and <code>node_modules</code> as the \"virtual env\". <code>npm</code> covers all the ground of installing code and binary dependencies on all platforms and generally just works. But with Python, <code>pip</code> is only one step in a longer process - you probably need a virtualenv, uv, poetry, conda, chocolatey, apt-get, winget, or something else to avoid version conflicts with other Python scripts on your system, and to install binary packages.</p>\n\n<p>Part of why this packaging story is so confusing is because Python does not include it in its \"helloworld\". If Python did show everyone the packaging story - then it would get fixed.</p>\n\n<h1>\n  \n  \n  Summary\n</h1>\n\n<p>A language's standard library should really just provide the bare minimum it can. The bare minimum is probably:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>A packaging system</li>\n<li>Operating system APIs</li>\n<li>Types (numbers, strings, arrays, promises, etc)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>A core language distribution should only contain what's necessary to install packages, and for packages to be compatible with each other. Leave all the rest to downloadable packages. I hope Python 4 standardizes the packaging circus on a common data structure like <code>package.json</code> did for NodeJS, and that most of today's standard library packages will be removed from the executable distribution and posted on PyPI.</p>\n\n<p>Cheers.</p>\n\n","contentLength":0,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Python Progress: Lists, Logic, and Building Interactive Tools","url":"https://dev.to/codingtides/python-progress-lists-logic-and-building-interactive-tools-1m64","date":1740036627,"author":"Moh","guid":7020,"unread":true,"content":"<h4>\n  \n  \n  Introduction\n</h4>\n\n<p>Learning Python is like peeling an onion—every layer reveals something new, exciting, and occasionally tear-inducing (hello, off-by-one errors). Over the past week, I’ve delved deeper into lists, slicing, the <code>range()</code> function, conditional logic with <code>if</code> statements, and the powerful <code>zip()</code> function. Alongside learning PEP 8 and using Ruff as a linter, I also started building interactive tools and tackling challenges from <em>Impractical Python Projects</em>.</p>\n\n<p>These experiences have deepened my understanding of Python and emphasized the importance of writing clear, maintainable code.</p>\n\n<h4>\n  \n  \n  Lists: Flexible and Fun (Most of the Time)\n</h4>\n\n<p>Lists continue to impress me with their versatility. Whether I’m appending items or removing them with <code>pop()</code>, I’m starting to see how lists play a central role in many of the tools I want to build.</p>\n\n<h5>\n  \n  \n  Slicing and Range\n</h5>\n\n<p>I’ve also explored slicing, which makes accessing subsets of data intuitive—except when I forget that Python starts counting at zero. Combining slicing with <code>range()</code> has been a game changer for generating sequences and working with lists dynamically. It’s elegant, but the occasional off-by-one error keeps me on my toes.</p>\n\n<h5>\n  \n  \n  List Comprehensions: Strange but Powerful\n</h5>\n\n<p>When I first encountered list comprehensions, they felt backward—why put the variable before the value? But after a bit of practice, I’ve realized their true power. For example, I can now condense a multi-line loop into a single line:<br>\n</p>\n\n<div class=\"highlight js-code-highlight\">\n<pre class=\"highlight python\"><code><span class=\"n\">squares</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"p\">[</span><span class=\"n\">x</span><span class=\"o\">**</span><span class=\"mi\">2</span> <span class=\"k\">for</span> <span class=\"n\">x</span> <span class=\"ow\">in</span> <span class=\"nf\">range</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"mi\">1</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"mi\">6</span><span class=\"p\">)]</span>\n</code></pre>\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>List comprehensions have started to feel like a Python superpower. They simplify tasks like filtering data or transforming lists, and I’m excited to see how I can use them in future projects.</p>\n\n\n\n\n<h4>\n  \n  \n  Adding Logic with If Statements\n</h4>\n\n<p>Recently, I took my first steps into conditional logic with <code>if</code> statements, adding a new dimension to my programs. I practiced scenarios like checking if a list is empty, filtering data, and creating dynamic outputs.</p>\n\n<p>For example, splitting a list into odd and even numbers is now as simple as:<br>\n</p>\n\n<div class=\"highlight js-code-highlight\">\n<pre class=\"highlight python\"><code><span class=\"n\">even_numbers</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"p\">[</span><span class=\"n\">x</span> <span class=\"k\">for</span> <span class=\"n\">x</span> <span class=\"ow\">in</span> <span class=\"n\">numbers</span> <span class=\"k\">if</span> <span class=\"n\">x</span> <span class=\"o\">%</span> <span class=\"mi\">2</span> <span class=\"o\">==</span> <span class=\"mi\">0</span><span class=\"p\">]</span>\n<span class=\"n\">odd_numbers</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"p\">[</span><span class=\"n\">x</span> <span class=\"k\">for</span> <span class=\"n\">x</span> <span class=\"ow\">in</span> <span class=\"n\">numbers</span> <span class=\"k\">if</span> <span class=\"n\">x</span> <span class=\"o\">%</span> <span class=\"mi\">2</span> <span class=\"o\">!=</span> <span class=\"mi\">0</span><span class=\"p\">]</span>\n</code></pre>\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s empowering to see how these small decisions can lead to smarter, more interactive programs.</p>\n\n\n\n\n<h4>\n  \n  \n  Exploring the Zip Function\n</h4>\n\n<p>The <code>zip()</code> function has been a revelation. This tool allows me to combine multiple lists into pairs or tuples, creating a more structured way to work with related data.</p>\n\n<p>For instance, pairing grades with their numeric values felt effortless using <code>zip</code>:<br>\n</p>\n\n<div class=\"highlight js-code-highlight\">\n<pre class=\"highlight python\"><code><span class=\"n\">numbers</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"p\">[</span><span class=\"mi\">90</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"mi\">85</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"mi\">78</span><span class=\"p\">]</span>\n<span class=\"n\">grades</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"p\">[</span><span class=\"sh\">'</span><span class=\"s\">A</span><span class=\"sh\">'</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"sh\">'</span><span class=\"s\">B</span><span class=\"sh\">'</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"sh\">'</span><span class=\"s\">C</span><span class=\"sh\">'</span><span class=\"p\">]</span>\n<span class=\"n\">summary</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"nf\">list</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nf\">zip</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">numbers</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"n\">grades</span><span class=\"p\">))</span>\n<span class=\"nf\">print</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">summary</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>  <span class=\"c1\"># Output: [(90, 'A'), (85, 'B'), (78, 'C')]\n</span></code></pre>\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>This concise approach integrates neatly into real-world tasks like summaries or comparisons. It’s also a reminder of how Python’s built-in functions simplify everyday programming challenges.</p>\n\n\n\n\n<h4>\n  \n  \n  Following PEP 8 with Ruff\n</h4>\n\n<p>PEP 8, Python’s style guide, lays out conventions for writing clean and consistent code. As I’ve started applying these standards, I’ve realized how they make code easier to read and collaborate on. From proper indentation to descriptive variable names, PEP 8 is a helpful blueprint for maintainable Python projects.</p>\n\n<p>To enforce these guidelines, I’ve been using Ruff, a fast and lightweight linter. Ruff not only identifies style violations but also provides suggestions for improvement. For example, it’s helped me catch redundant imports, ensure consistent whitespace, and write cleaner list comprehensions.</p>\n\n<p>Here’s a quick example of how Ruff keeps my code in check:<br>\n</p>\n\n<div class=\"highlight js-code-highlight\">\n<pre class=\"highlight python\"><code><span class=\"c1\"># Before Ruff's suggestions\n</span><span class=\"n\">numbers</span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"p\">[</span><span class=\"mi\">1</span><span class=\"p\">,</span><span class=\"mi\">2</span><span class=\"p\">,</span><span class=\"mi\">3</span><span class=\"p\">]</span>\n<span class=\"nf\">print</span><span class=\"p\">(</span> <span class=\"p\">[</span><span class=\"n\">x</span><span class=\"o\">*</span><span class=\"mi\">2</span> <span class=\"k\">for</span> <span class=\"n\">x</span> <span class=\"ow\">in</span> <span class=\"n\">numbers</span><span class=\"p\">]</span> <span class=\"p\">)</span>\n\n<span class=\"c1\"># After applying Ruff's recommendations\n</span><span class=\"n\">numbers</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"p\">[</span><span class=\"mi\">1</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"mi\">2</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"mi\">3</span><span class=\"p\">]</span>\n<span class=\"nf\">print</span><span class=\"p\">([</span><span class=\"n\">x</span> <span class=\"o\">*</span> <span class=\"mi\">2</span> <span class=\"k\">for</span> <span class=\"n\">x</span> <span class=\"ow\">in</span> <span class=\"n\">numbers</span><span class=\"p\">])</span>\n</code></pre>\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>This process has not only improved the quality of my code but also taught me to appreciate the importance of clean formatting.</p>\n\n\n\n\n<h4>\n  \n  \n  Building My First Interactive Tool\n</h4>\n\n<p>With my new skills, I decided to create a tool that ties everything together.

It also showed me where I can improve, like handling invalid user inputs and modularizing my code with functions.</p>\n\n\n\n\n<h4>\n  \n  \n  The To-Do App Debate: Resolved\n</h4>\n\n<p>For days, I debated whether to start building a To-Do app as my first substantial project or wait until I’ve mastered more concepts like loops and functions. After creating this interactive tool, I realized that waiting for “perfect” knowledge would hold me back.</p>\n\n<p>Instead, I’ve decided to tackle projects now and use them as opportunities to learn along the way. My next step is to dive into <em>Impractical Python Projects</em> and implement a real-world challenge. This will supplement my learning with practical problem-solving while also giving me the freedom to experiment.</p>\n\n\n\n\n<h4>\n  \n  \n  Reflections\n</h4>\n\n<p>Balancing structured learning with practical exploration has been one of the most rewarding challenges of this journey. Implementing projects like the interactive tool and tools involving <code>zip()</code> reminds me that programming is best learned by doing.</p>\n\n<p>If you’re learning Python, I highly recommend exploring PEP 8, trying out a linter like Ruff, and starting small projects to consolidate your knowledge. These small steps will greatly improve your coding skills and make your projects shine.</p>\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Thanks for reading, and let’s see what the tide brings tomorrow!</strong></p>\n\n\n\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  Join Me on My Journey\n</h2>\n\n<p>If you’d like to follow along, I’ll be sharing more about my learning process, projects, and insights here and on my <a href=\"https://github.com/mohallahham/mytoolbox.git\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">GitHub repository</a>.

We also replaced the global WebSocket connection list with <code>weakref.WeakSet</code> for more robust connection management during shutdown. To maintain persistent connections during long-running processes like zero-shot classification, we implemented a ping/pong mechanism.</p>\n\n<p>Next, we consolidated common utility functions into a new <code>src/utils/base.py</code> file. This included functions like <code>validate_and_convert_transactions</code>, <code>get_device</code>, <code>detect_anomalies</code>, <code>analyze_spending</code>, <code>predict_trends</code>, <code>calculate_trend</code>, and <code>calculate_percentage_change</code>, previously located in <code>utils/summarize.py</code> and <code>utils/analyze.py</code>. We also introduced new functions to estimate financial health (<code>calculate_financial_health</code>) and detect recurring transactions (<code>analyze_recurring_transactions</code>). The anomaly detection was enhanced to identify single-instance anomalies, and the transaction grouping algorithm now uses <code>difflib</code> for fuzzy matching of descriptions. For example, <code>difflib</code> might consider these descriptions to be similar (approximately 69% match): \"Target T-12345 Anytown USA\" and \"Target 12345 Anytown USA\":<br>\n</p>\n\n<div class=\"highlight js-code-highlight\">\n<pre class=\"highlight python\"><code><span class=\"k\">def</span> <span class=\"nf\">group_transactions_by_description</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">transactions</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"nb\">list</span><span class=\"p\">[</span><span class=\"n\">Transaction</span><span class=\"p\">],</span> <span class=\"n\">cutoff</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"nb\">float</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"mf\">0.69</span><span class=\"p\">)</span> <span class=\"o\">-&gt;</span> <span class=\"nb\">dict</span><span class=\"p\">[</span><span class=\"nb\">str</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"nb\">list</span><span class=\"p\">[</span><span class=\"nb\">float</span><span class=\"p\">]]:</span>\n    <span class=\"sh\">\"\"\"</span><span class=\"s\">\n    Group transactions by description using fuzzy matching with difflib.\n\n    Returns a dictionary mapping a representative description (the group key)\n    to a list of transaction amounts.

This significantly improves accuracy, although at the cost of speed. For multilingual support, <code>joeddav/xlm-roberta-large-xnli</code> is another option.</li>\n<li> <strong>Hybrid Classification Approach:</strong> We now use a hybrid approach, first attempting to classify transactions using pattern matching. Any remaining unclassified transactions are then processed by the ML model. To improve performance, we process transactions in batches, releasing the event loop after each batch to allow other operations to proceed and to clear memory.</li>\n<li> <strong>Offloading Calculations:</strong> To reduce the load on the classification process, we moved the calculation of <code>anomalies</code>, <code>spending_analysis</code>, <code>spending_trends</code>, <code>recurring_transactions</code>, and <code>financial_health</code> to <code>src/utils/summarize.py</code>, which is significantly faster.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h3>\n  \n  \n  Step 2: Enforcing Type Safety, Security, and Style\n</h3>\n\n<p>Our type annotations are currently only decorative. To enforce type safety, ensure code security, and maintain consistent code style, we'll use the following tools:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>\n<code>mypy</code>: A static type checker.</li>\n<li>\n<code>bandit</code>: A security linter.</li>\n<li>\n<code>black</code>: An uncompromising code formatter.</li>\n<li>\n<code>isort</code>: A tool for sorting imports.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><span><b>Tip:</b> Consider using <code>Prospector</code></span></p>\n\n<p>\n<code>Prospector</code> provides comprehensive static analysis and ensures your code conforms to PEP8 and other style guidelines.

In this case, we're using the latest Ubuntu distribution as the environment. We use <a href=\"https://github.com/actions/checkout\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">version 4 of the actions/checkout action</a> to check out our repository. We also install system dependencies required by some of the Python packages, such as <code>poppler-utils</code> for <code>pdf2image</code> and <code>tesseract-ocr</code> and <code>libtesseract-dev</code> for <code>pytesseract</code>. Since our project doesn't have database interaction, we don't need a <code>services</code> section. The remaining steps are self-explanatory. We then execute our bash script to check the codebase against our defined standards. We also supply environment variables and run the tests (which we'll write later). This CI/CD pipeline runs on every pull request or push to the utility branch.</p>\n\n<h3>\n  \n  \n  Step 3: Writing the tests\n</h3>\n\n<p>The last part of our CI/CD was running tests and getting coverage reports. In the Python ecosystem, <a href=\"https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">pytest</a> is an extremely popular testing framework. Though very tempting and might still be used later on, we will stick with Python's built-in testing library, <a href=\"https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">unittest</a>, and use <a href=\"https://coverage.readthedocs.io/en/7.6.12/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">coverage</a> for measuring code test coverage of our program.

The <code>Base</code> class makes the <code>create_transaction_dict</code> method available to all its children, simplifying the creation of transaction data for tests. The <code>FakeWebSocket</code> class simulates aiohttp WebSocket behavior, which is essential for unit testing the project's WebSocket utilities. All asynchronous unit tests inherit from <code>BaseAsyncTestClass</code>, while synchronous tests inherit from <code>BaseTestClass</code>. <code>BaseAioHTTPTestCase</code> is used for integration-style tests that involve the aiohttp application. The <code>get_application</code> is required in this class to return our app's instance.</p>\n<div class=\"highlight js-code-highlight\">\n<pre class=\"highlight plaintext\"><code>&lt;span&gt;&lt;b&gt;Note:&lt;/b&gt; Unit vs Integration tests&lt;/span&gt;\n&lt;p&gt; A unit test focuses on testing a single piece of code (like a function such as &lt;code&gt;analyze_recurring_transactions&lt;/code&gt;) whereas integration tests examine how multiple units of code interact with each other within a system (this is like testing the behavior of sending a request to &lt;code&gt;/ws&lt;/code&gt;)\n&lt;/p&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n</div>\n<p>Let's take an example integration-style test, especially for our websocket, and another unit test for some

We also created a dummy version of <code>ping_server</code> to properly close it and prevent memory leaks. With the dummy functions in place, we created test cases that interact with our WebSocket endpoint. Using async patches and mocks, we fed predictable responses to the tests. Note that we used our async dummy methods as the <code>side_effect</code> of the <code>AsyncMock</code>. Using <code>return_value</code> instead of <code>side_effect</code> in the mocks prolonged the processes and caused timeout errors.</p>\n\n<p>The other test cases handle various scenarios to provide better test coverage.</p>\n<div class=\"highlight js-code-highlight\">\n<pre class=\"highlight plaintext\"><code>&lt;span&gt;&lt;b&gt;Warning:&lt;/b&gt; The file path in patch&lt;/span&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\nWhen supplying file paths in &lt;code&gt;patch&lt;/code&gt;, use the path where the program is used, not where it was defined. For instance, &lt;code&gt;src.app.app_instance.analyze_transactions&lt;/code&gt; was defined in &lt;code&gt;src/utils/analyzer.py&lt;/code&gt; but since it was used in &lt;code&gt;src/app/app_instance.py&lt;/code&gt;, we used &lt;code&gt;src.app.app_instance.analyze_transactions&lt;/code&gt;.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n</div>\n<p>However, the integration testing approach poses some limitations. We can't modify the internals of the <code>aiohttp</code> WebSocket instance. This is where unit testing comes to the rescue, as we can modify internals and mock them as needed to thoroughly test the desired feature. Hence the other test file for our WebSocket, <a href=\"https://github.com/Sirneij/finance-analyzer/blob/utility/tests/app/websocket_handler/test_ping.py\" rel=\"noopener

To effectively scrape data from Google Maps, it's essential to understand its interface and the key data points it provides.</p>\n\n<h3>\n  \n  \n  Overview of Google Maps' Interface:\n</h3>\n\n<p>When you search for a business or location on Google Maps, the results are displayed in a structured layout. Here’s a breakdown of the interface:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Ffwk74qkygx196jqtn2p8.png\" class=\"article-body-image-wrapper\"><img src=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Ffwk74qkygx196jqtn2p8.png\" alt=\"Google Maps\" width=\"800\" height=\"369\"></a></p>\n\n<p><strong>1. Search Results Panel:</strong></p>\n\n<p>On the left side of the screen, Google Maps displays a list of businesses or locations matching your search query. Each listing typically includes:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Business Name</strong>: The name of the business or place.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Address</strong>: The physical location of the business.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Phone Number</strong>: Contact information for business.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Ratings</strong>: A star rating based on user reviews.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Number of Reviews</strong>: The total count of reviews left by users.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Category</strong>: The type of business (e.g., restaurant, hotel, retail store).</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>2. Info Cards:</strong></p>\n\n<p>When you click on a specific listing, an info card pops up with more detailed information. This card often includes:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Website Link</strong>: A direct link to the business's official website.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Operating Hours</strong>: The business' opening and closing times.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Popular Times</strong>: A graph showing how busy the location is at different times.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Photos and Videos</strong>: User-uploaded media related to the business.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Additional Details</strong>: Information like amenities, services, or special features.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>3. Map View:</strong></p>\n\n<p>The right side of the screen displays a map with markers for each business or location. Clicking on a marker also triggers the corresponding info card.</p>\n\n<h3>\n  \n  \n  Identifying Key Data Points:\n</h3>\n\n<ol>\n<li>🏬 Business Names</li>\n<li>📍Addresses</li>\n<li>☎️ Phone Numbers</li>\n<li>🌟 Ratings and Reviews</li>\n<li>🌐 Website Links</li>\n<li>⏰ Operating Hours</li>\n<li>🛒 Categories</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  Does Google Maps include all business contact details?\n</h2>\n\n<p>No. Google Maps is an ever-expanding free business database: marketers can find place names, addresses, phone numbers, and official websites. However, Google Maps does not provide information on business email addresses or social media accounts.</p>\n\n<p>Fortunately, most businesses list their contact details in one place - their website, which is usually mentioned on their Google Maps details card.</p>\n\n<p>What if you need to contact many businesses at the same time? You must have thought of manually clicking on each card to understand the merchant rating and contact information before making a decision. But you know there are hundreds of similar businesses around you.</p>\n\n<p>How can you quickly complete the collection of contact information and review information? At this time, Google Maps API will help you quickly and accurately obtain all the information!</p>\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  Scraping API: Effective and Simple Method to Scrape Google Maps\n</h2>\n\n<p>Scrapeless Google Maps API helps you get all the information on the map within 3 minutes.

They only extract data that businesses choose to share publicly on the web. However, you should be aware that some results, such as reviews, may contain personal data. Unless you have a legitimate reason, you should not scrape personal data.</p>\n\n<h3>\n  \n  \n  Can I extract longitude and latitude from Google Maps?\n</h3>\n\n<p>Yes, every place on Google has a longitude and latitude assigned to it. You can easily scrape these.</p>\n\n<h3>\n  \n  \n  Can I scrape contact details for an entire city?\n</h3>\n\n<p>Of course, you can! If your area has a name (city, state, or country), you can scrape places on Google Maps by just entering the name. But you can also extract data by geographic location (multiple longitude and latitude points).</p>\n\n<h3>\n  \n  \n  Can I scrape restaurant chains and their contact details?\n</h3>\n\n<p>Sure! For example, you can use the search options parameter in Google Maps Scraper to scrape all Starbucks or KFCs in the area. Then, use the Google Maps email extractor to enhance your dataset with all the contact details, as we do in this tutorial.</p>\n\n","contentLength":0,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Armin Ronacher: Ugly Code and Dumb Things","url":"http://lucumr.pocoo.org/2025/2/20/ugly-code","date":1740009600,"author":"","guid":7094,"unread":true,"content":"<p>This week I had a conversation with one of our engineers about “shitty\ncode” which lead me to sharing with him one of my more unusual\ninspirations: <a href=\"https://github.com/exflickr/flamework/\">Flamework</a>, a\npseudo framework created at Flickr.</p><div><h2>Two Passions, Two Approaches</h2><p>There are two driving passions in my work.  One is the love of creating\nbeautiful, elegant code — making Open Source libraries and APIs that focus\non clear design and reusability.  The other passion is building quick,\npragmatic solutions for real users (who may not even be developers).  The\nlatter usually in a setting of building a product, where the product is\nnot the code.  Here, speed and iteration matter more than beautiful code\nor reusability, because success hinges on shipping something people want.</p><p>Flamework is in service of the latter, and in crass violation of the\nformer.</p><p>Early on, I realized that creating reusable code and directly solving\nproblems for users are often at odds.  My first clue came when I helped\nrun the German\n<a href=\"https://www.ubuntuusers.de/\">ubuntuusers</a> website.  It was powered by\na heavily modified version of phpBB, which despite how messy it was,\nscaled to a large user base when patched properly.  It was messy, but easy\nto adjust.  The abstractions were one layer deep.</p><p>Back then, me and a friend tried to replace it by writing my own bulletin\nboard software, <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20070502223619/http://flying.circus.pocoo.org/\">Pocoo</a>.\nWorking in isolation, without users, led me down a path of\nover-engineering.  While we learned a lot and ended up creating popular\nOpen Source libraries (like Jinja, Werkzeug and Pygments), Pocoo never\nbecame a solid product.  Later, my collaborators and I <a href=\"https://github.com/inyokaproject/inyoka/\">rebuilt\nubuntuusers</a>, without the\ngoal of making it into a reusable product.  That rewrite shipped\nsuccessfully and it lives to this very day.</p><p>But it took me years to fully realize what was happening here: reusability\nis not that important when you’re building an application, but it’s\ncrucial when you’re building a library or framework.</p></div><div><p>If you are unfamiliar with Flamework you should watch a talk that Cal\nHenderson gave in 2008 at DjangoCon (<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6Fr65PFqfk\">Why I hate Django</a>).  He talked about scale\nand how Django didn't solve for it.  He enumerated all the things\nimportant to him: sharding, using custom sequences for primary keys,\nforgoing joins and foreign keys, supporting database replication setups,\ndenormalizing data to the extreme.  This is also were I first learned\nabout the possibility of putting all session data into cookies via\nsigning.  It was a memorable talk for me because it showed me that there\nare shortcomings.  Django (which I used for ubuntuusers) had beautiful\nAPIs but at the time solved for little of that Cal needed.  The talk\nreally stuck with me.</p><p>At the time of the talk, Flamework did not really exist.  It was more of\nan idea and principles of engineering at Flickr.</p><p>A few years later, Flamework appeared on GitHub, not as an open-sourced\npiece of Flickr code but as a reimplementation of those same ideas.  You\ncan explore its repository and see code like this:</p><div><pre></pre></div><p>Instinctively it makes me cringe.  Is that a SQL injection?  Well you were\nsupposed to use the PHP <a href=\"https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.addslashes.php\">addslashes</a> function\nbeforehand.  But notice how it caters to sharding and clustering directly\nin the query function.</p></div><div><p>Code like this often triggers a visceral reaction, especially in engineers\nwho prize clean design.</p><p>How does something like that get created?  Cal Henderson described\nFlickr's principle as “doing the dumbest possible thing that will work.”\nMaybe “dumb” is too strong — “simple” might be more apt.  Yet simplicity\ncan look messy to someone expecting a meticulously engineered codebase.\nThis is not at all uncommon and I have seen it over and over.  The first\nlarge commercial project that got traction that I ever worked on (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plurk\">Plurk</a>) was also pretty pragmatic and\nmessy inside.  My former colleague Ben Vinegar also <a href=\"https://benv.ca/blog/posts/the-hardest-problem\">recently shared</a> a story of early,\nmessy FreshBooks code and how he came to terms with it.  Same story at\n<a href=\"https://sentry.io/welcome\">Sentry</a>.  We moved fast, we made a mess.</p><p>None of this is surprising in retrospective.  Perfect code doesn't\nguarantee success if you haven't solved a real problem for real people.\nPursuing elegance in a vacuum leads to abandoned side projects or\nframeworks nobody uses.  By contrast, clunky but functional code often\ncomes with just the right compromises for quick iteration.  And that in\nturn means a lot of messy code powers products that people love —\nsomething that's a far bigger challenge.</p></div><div><p>I have shown Flamework's code to multiple engineers over the years and it\nusually creates such a visceral response.  It blind sights one by\nseemingly disregarding all rules of good software engineering.</p><p>That makes Flamework serve as a fascinating Rorschach test for engineers.\nAre you <a href=\"https://github.com/exflickr/flamework\">looking at it</a> with\nadmiration for the focus on some critical issues like scale, the built-in\nobservability and debugging tools.  Or are you judging it, and its\ncreators, for manually constructing SQL queries, using global variables,\nnot using classes and looking like messy PHP4 code?  Is it a pragmatic\ntool, intentionally designed to iterate quickly at scale, or is it a naive\nmess made by unskilled developers?</p><p>Would I use Flamework?  Hello no.  But I appreciate the priorities behind\nit.  If these ugly choices help you move faster, attract users and\nvalidate the product, then a rewrite, or large refactorings later are a\nsmall price to pay.</p></div><div><p>At the end of the day, where you stand on “shitty code” depends on your\nprimary goal:</p><ul><li>Are you shipping a product and racing to meet user needs?</li><li>Or are you building a reusable library or framework meant to stand the\ntest of time?</li></ul><p>Both mindsets are valid, but they rarely coexist harmoniously in a single\ncodebase.  Flamework is a reminder that messy, simple solutions can be\npowerful if they solve real problems.  Eventually, when the time is right,\nyou can clean it up or rebuild from the ground up.</p><p>The real challenge is deciding which route to take — and when.  Even with\nexperience, it is can be hard to know when to move from quick fixes to\nmore robust foundations.  The principles behind Flamework are also\nreflected in <a href=\"https://develop.sentry.dev/getting-started/philosophy/\">Sentry's development philosophy</a>.  One more\npoignant one being “Embrace the Duct Tape”.  Yet as Sentry matured, much\nof our duct tape didn't stand the test of time, and was re-applied at\nmoments when the real solution would have been a solid foundation poured\nwith concrete.</p><p>That's because successful projects eventually grow up.  What let you\niterate fast in the beginning might eventually turn into an unmaintainable\nmess and will be rebuilt from the inside out.</p><p>I personally would never have built Flamework, it repulses me a bit.  At the\nsame time, I have a enormous respect for the people who build it.  Their\nwork and thinking has shaped how I solve problems and think of product\nengineering.</p></div>","contentLength":6742,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Gemini manual function

This time, I want to dive into the progress I’ve made so far—along with the headaches and roadblocks that came along for the ride.</p>\n\n<h1>\n  \n  \n  What’s New: Our Recent Wins\n</h1>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p><strong>Auto Scaling Group for EC2</strong><br>\nA major focus has been setting up an Auto Scaling Group (ASG) for EC2 instances. Having ASG in place lets me spin up or shut down instances as needed without manual intervention. This means I can simulate any number of IoT devices just by adjusting the capacity of the group.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>IoT Device Simulation on Boot</strong>🤖<br>\nI’ve also configured these EC2 instances to run Python scripts for simulating IoT devices on boot. The idea is that, as soon as an instance spins up, it automatically starts sending data to the rest of the pipeline. Getting that “plug-and-play” behavior has been really satisfying to see in action.</p></li>\n<li><p>🌊<strong>Data Flow</strong>: EC2 → Kinesis → Lambda → S3 &amp; DynamoDB<br>\nA functional data flow was an essential next step. With the pipeline in place:</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>EC2 runs the Python scripts that generate or collect telemetry.<br>\nThe data streams into Amazon Kinesis in near real-time.<br>\nA Lambda function processes and transforms this data.<br>\nFinally, it lands in a DynamoDB Table for longer-term storage and analytics and a copy of the unprocessed data is sent to an S3 bucket for post-analysis. I haven't set up the DynamoDB table yet, so all data is sent to the S3 Bucket.<br>\nIt’s a clean flow that captures the essence of a scalable IoT pipeline.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fzl9hubjq2wnoutpu1euy.png\" class=\"article-body-image-wrapper\"><img src=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fzl9hubjq2wnoutpu1euy.png\" alt=\"A diagram describing the above workflow\" width=\"800\" height=\"311\"></a></p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>🔄️<strong>CI/CD Integration</strong>\nAnother accomplishment has been setting up a CI/CD pipeline so that pushing new code automatically triggers updates across all instances. Specifically, whenever there’s a pull request to the main branch:</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>The pipeline reboots all IoT devices (the EC2 instances).<br>\nIt runs updated code to ensure everything remains consistent and in sync.<br>\nHaving this quick, reproducible deployment cycle makes it easy to iterate on features without worrying about manual redeployments.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>✅<strong>Polished and Tested Python Code</strong>\nFinally, I spent a good chunk of time refactoring and cleaning up the Python code to ensure that each piece is thoroughly tested. This not only helped improve reliability but also made the codebase much easier to reason about and maintain over time.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h1>\n  \n  \n  🧑‍🏫Challenges and Lessons Learned\n</h1>\n\n<h4>\n  \n  \n  Of course, no progress comes without a few hiccups.\n</h4>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p><strong>CI/CD Pipeline IAM Role Issues</strong><br>\nOne of the biggest hurdles was GitHub Actions not being able to assume the necessary IAM role for making requests to my API Gateway. I lost a fair bit of time troubleshooting, and it turned out the role trust policies and permissions weren’t aligned properly. Lesson learned: always verify which entity (GitHub Actions in this case) needs to assume which role, and ensure your trust relationships are explicitly set.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Code Errors on EC2 Instances</strong><br>\nDespite the automation, running code on the EC2 instances has been an ongoing game of whack-a-mole. Each time I solve one error, another pops up—from missing dependencies to library version conflicts. My takeaway here is to keep an eye on how the base AMI and Python environment get provisioned. Small changes can introduce big problems.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Refactor Friction and Module Errors</strong><br>\nAfter making the Python code more modular and test-friendly, I ran into a series of module-related errors. Some modules weren’t being imported correctly, or path issues surfaced only in the production environment. It was a reminder that thorough testing has to include realistic deployment scenarios as well—local tests aren’t always enough.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  🤔Next Steps\n</h2>\n\n<h4>\n  \n  \n  Fix EC2 Python Script Issues:\n</h4>\n\n<p>The first priority is to stabilize the environment on each EC2 instance. I’ll refine the provisioning scripts, ensure dependencies are properly installed, and tackle the recurring module path errors once and for all.</p>\n\n<h4>\n  \n  \n  Experiment with Different Instance Types:\n</h4>\n\n<p>Once the scripts run consistently, I plan to tinker with various EC2 instance types (e.g., t3.medium, m5.large) to strike a good balance between cost and performance. The goal is to simulate loads of varying magnitudes while keeping the budget in check.</p>\n\n<h4>\n  \n  \n  Set Up a DynamoDB Table:\n</h4>\n\n<p>Storing stateful data—like metadata about the simulated IoT devices—could be hugely beneficial. I’ll spin up a DynamoDB table to maintain device configurations, health stats, or anything else that’ll help manage and analyze this distributed system more effectively.</p>\n\n<h4>\n  \n  \n  Work on Analysis:\n</h4>\n\n<p>With the core pipeline (EC2 → Kinesis → Lambda → S3) in place, it’s time to shift focus to actual analytics. By integrating tools like Athena, QuickSight, or even custom ML pipelines, I can start transforming the raw stream data into actionable insights.</p>\n\n<p>I’m excited for what’s next—especially now that I’ll have a more stable, scalable, and analytics-friendly backbone for Project Nairobi. Stay tuned for more updates as I tackle these to-dos and continue refining this platform into an end-to-end, production-grade solution!</p>\n\n<p>Have any tips, suggestions, or want to share your own experiences wrestling with IAM roles and pipelines? Feel free to drop a comment. I’m always keen to hear how others navigate these complexities. And if you’re new here, be sure to check out my previous posts to see how Project Nairobi got started.</p>\n\n<p>Stay tuned for more progress updates as I continue to refine this platform into a smoothly running, production-grade analytics engine!</p>\n\n<p>😁Thanks for reading, and see you in the next update.</p>\n\n","contentLength":0,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Host a FastAPI Application Without a Server","url":"https://dev.to/lightningdev123/host-a-fastapi-application-without-a-server-43n7","date":1739991534,"author":"Lightning Developer","guid":5998,"unread":true,"content":"<p><a href=\"https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">FastAPI</a> is one of the fastest and most efficient frameworks for building APIs with Python.

LangGraph, an extension of LangChain, provides a graph-based approach to create structured and dynamic AI workflows. This guide will walk you through building an AI agent with LangGraph and highlight the <a href=\"https://github.com/hulk-pham/LangGraph-AI-Agent\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">LangGraph-AI-Agent</a> repository by hulk-pham—a project that demonstrates advanced multi-agent conversational systems, dynamic workflow orchestration, custom agent behaviors, and robust state management.</p>\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  What is LangGraph?\n</h2>\n\n<p>LangGraph is an innovative framework that leverages directed graphs to model AI workflows. Unlike traditional sequential or decision-tree-based logic, LangGraph allows you to define nodes (representing tasks or actions) and edges (representing the flow of information) for more flexible and scalable AI applications.</p>\n\n<h3>\n  \n  \n  Key Features:\n</h3>\n\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Graph-based Execution:</strong> Define workflows as nodes and edges.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Parallel Execution:</strong> Run multiple tasks simultaneously.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>State Management:</strong> Maintain context and handle conversation history.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Error Handling:</strong> Gracefully manage and recover from failures.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  Exploring the LangGraph-AI-Agent Repository\n</h2>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://github.com/hulk-pham/LangGraph-AI-Agent\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">LangGraph-AI-Agent</a> repository is a practical implementation that showcases how to build multi-agent conversational workflows using LangGraph. Here’s a quick overview of what the repository offers:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Multi-Agent Conversations:</strong> The project supports interactions between multiple AI agents, each designed for specific tasks.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Dynamic Workflow Orchestration:</strong> Easily adapt and extend conversation flows as needed.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Custom Agent Behaviors:</strong> Define specialized behaviors for each agent to handle diverse queries.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>State Management:</strong> Keep track of conversation context across interactions.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>\n  \n  \n

One night, deep in an Uber ride, I struck up a conversation with the driver. The topic of Bitcoin came up, and he mentioned that he once lost his wallet containing $50,000.<br>\nI thought this would be the end of the story-something like regret, lessons learned, and moving on. But then he said something that stuck with me: \"Thankfully, I found WIZARD WEB RECOVERY SERVICES . They got everything back.\" I nodded, really interested but unconcerned. After all, I was very careful with my wallet security. I thought, That's rough, but it could never happen to me. A week later, it happened to me. I lost the wallet holding $300,000 while overhauling my crypto storage system. In one wrong move, my funds became completely unreachable. I retraced passwords, checked backups, tried everything that normally works, but nothing worked. Panic kicked in. My mind was racing, trying to figure out my next move. And then, I remembered the Uber driver's story.<br>\nI didn't waste a moment and contacted WIZARD WEB RECOVERY SERVICES . Right upon connecting to their team, I could feel my nerves calm down. They did not right away get to work but also asked questions, analyzed my situation, and explained how the recovery would go. It was next-level professionalism; they didn't just work on how to return my money but also how to make me understand what happened and how I could avoid it in the future. Finally, after what felt like the longest wait of my life, came the message that I had been waiting for: My wallet was recovered successfully.<br>\nRelief doesn't even begin to describe my feeling at that moment. That $300,000 wasn't just money; it was years of careful investments and strategic planning. And in an instant, it was all back where it belonged. In retrospect, I owe more than a five-star rating to that Uber driver. His story gave me a lifeline which I didn't know I needed. Lesson learned: Pay attention to those random conversations-you never know when they might save you a fortune.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://wizardwebrecoveryservices.com\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://wizardwebrecoveryservices.com</a><br>\nEmail info@&gt;wizardwebrecoveryservices.com<br>\nWhatsApp number:&gt;+447510743083<br>\nEmail&gt;<a href=\"mailto:wizardwebrecovery@programmer.net\">wizardwebrecovery@programmer.net</a> </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fb0wdw9tlwhbn7zqiosk4.jpg\" class=\"article-body-image-wrapper\"><img src=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fb0wdw9tlwhbn7zqiosk4.jpg\" alt=\"Image description\" width=\"800\" height=\"800\"></a></p>\n\n","contentLength":0,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"What do you think?","url":"https://dev.to/techtech/what-do-you-think-42l3","date":1739977921,"author":"techtech","guid":5884,"unread":true,"content":"<div class=\"ltag__link\">\n  <a href=\"/techtech\" class=\"ltag__link__link\">\n    <div class=\"ltag__link__pic\">\n      <img src=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fuser%2Fprofile_image%2F1110585%2F6025dd24-0eb3-4de9-96f7-8a600fdc0bfb.jpeg\" alt=\"techtech\">\n    </div>\n  </a>\n  <a href=\"https://dev.to/techtech/i-created-my-own-search-engine-41m3\" class=\"ltag__link__link\">\n    <div class=\"ltag__link__content\">\n      <h2>I created my own search engine</h2>\n      <h3>techtech ・ Feb 19</h3>\n      <div class=\"ltag__link__taglist\">\n        <span class=\"ltag__link__tag\">#webdev</span>\n        <span class=\"ltag__link__tag\">#python</span>\n        <span class=\"ltag__link__tag\">#mongodb</span>\n        <span class=\"ltag__link__tag\">#bootstrap</span>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n  </a>\n</div>\n\n\n","contentLength":0,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"[Boost]","url":"https://dev.to/techtech/-3mld","date":1739977888,"author":"techtech","guid":5883,"unread":true,"content":"<div class=\"ltag__link\">\n  <a href=\"/techtech\" class=\"ltag__link__link\">\n    <div class=\"ltag__link__pic\">\n      <img src=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fuser%2Fprofile_image%2F1110585%2F6025dd24-0eb3-4de9-96f7-8a600fdc0bfb.jpeg\" alt=\"techtech\">\n    </div>\n  </a>\n  <a href=\"https://dev.to/techtech/i-created-my-own-search-engine-41m3\" class=\"ltag__link__link\">\n    <div class=\"ltag__link__content\">\n      <h2>I created my own search engine</h2>\n      <h3>techtech ・ Feb 19</h3>\n      <div class=\"ltag__link__taglist\">\n        <span class=\"ltag__link__tag\">#webdev</span>\n        <span class=\"ltag__link__tag\">#python</span>\n        <span class=\"ltag__link__tag\">#mongodb</span>\n        <span class=\"ltag__link__tag\">#bootstrap</span>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n  </a>\n</div>\n\n\n","contentLength":0,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"I created my own search engine","url":"https://dev.to/techtech/i-created-my-own-search-engine-41m3","date":1739977631,"author":"techtech","guid":5882,"unread":true,"content":"<p>Hello everyone,</p>\n\n<p>I'm excited to share some new features and improvements in my custom search engine project.

It ensures that developers can easily understand and utilize your API, reducing confusion and speeding up the integration process. One of the best tools for achieving this is Swagger UI, which provides an interactive interface for your API documentation based on the OpenAPI Specification (OAS). In this guide, we will explore how to integrate Swagger UI with a Django Blog API project, making your API documentation user-friendly and accessible.</p>\n\n<h3>\n  \n  \n  Why Use Swagger UI?\n</h3>\n\n<p>Swagger UI is a powerful tool that automatically generates interactive API documentation from an OpenAPI specification. It allows developers to:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Explore API endpoints through a visual interface.</li>\n<li>Test API requests directly from the browser.</li>\n<li>Understand request and response structures without needing to sift through the code.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>While other documentation tools like <a href=\"https://github.com/Redocly/redoc\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">ReDoc</a> offer various features, Swagger UI stands out for its interactive design and ease of implementation. This makes it a valuable tool for helping developers understand and test your API directly from the documentation.</p>\n\n<h3>\n  \n  \n  Project Setup: Our Blog API\n</h3>\n\n<p>We will create a simple Blog API using Django REST Framework to demonstrate the integration of Swagger UI. Our API will allow users to:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Create, read, update, and delete blog posts.</li>\n<li>Add and manage comments on blog posts.</li>\n<li>Tag and categorize blog posts.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>\n  \n  \n  Prerequisites\n</h3>\n\n<p>Before we begin, ensure you have the following:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Python 3.8 or higher installed.</li>\n<li>Basic familiarity with Django and Django REST Framework.</li>\n<li>A code editor (e.g., VS Code, PyCharm).</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Step 1. Create a New Django Project</strong></p>\n\n<p>Let’s start by setting up a new Django project.<br>\n</p>\n\n<div class=\"highlight js-code-highlight\">\n<pre class=\"highlight plaintext\"><code># Create a virtual environment\npython -m venv blogapi_env\nsource blogapi_env/bin/activate  # On Windows: blogapi_env\\Scripts\\activate\n\n# Install Django and DRF\npip install django djangorestframework\n\n# Start a new Django project\ndjango-admin startproject blogapi\ncd blogapi\n\n# Create the blog app\npython manage.py startapp blog\n</code></pre>\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Step 2. Define Models</strong></p>\n\n<p>Next, let’s define the models for our blog in blog/models.py.<br>\n</p>\n\n<div class=\"highlight js-code-highlight\">\n<pre class=\"highlight plaintext\"><code>from django.db import models\nfrom django.contrib.auth.models import User\n\nclass Category(models.Model):\n    name = models.CharField(max_length=100)\n\n    def __str__(self):\n        return self.name\n\nclass Post(models.Model):\n    title = models.CharField(max_length=200)\n    content = models.TextField()\n    author = models.ForeignKey(User, on_delete=models.CASCADE)\n    created_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)\n    updated_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now=True)\n    categories = models.ManyToManyField(Category, related_name='posts')\n\n    def __str__(self):\n        return self.title\n\nclass Comment(models.Model):\n    post = models.ForeignKey(Post, on_delete=models.CASCADE, related_name='comments')\n    author = models.ForeignKey(User, on_delete=models.CASCADE)\n    content = models.TextField()\n    created_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)\n\n    def __str__(self):\n        return f\"Comment by {self.author.username} on {self.post.title}\"\n</code></pre>\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Step 3. Create Serializers</strong></p>\n\n<p>Now, let’s create serializers in blog/serializers.py to convert our models into JSON format.<br>\n</p>\n\n<div class=\"highlight js-code-highlight\">\n<pre class=\"highlight plaintext\"><code>from rest_framework import serializers\nfrom .models import Category, Post, Comment\nfrom django.contrib.auth.models import User\n\nclass UserSerializer(serializers.ModelSerializer):\n    class Meta:\n        model = User\n        fields = ('id', 'username', 'email')\n\nclass CategorySerializer(serializers.ModelSerializer):\n    class Meta:\n        model = Category\n        fields = ('id', 'name')\n\nclass CommentSerializer(serializers.ModelSerializer):\n    author = UserSerializer(read_only=True)\n\n    class Meta:\n        model = Comment\n        fields = ('id', 'post', 'author', 'content', 'created_at')\n        read_only_fields = ('post',)\n\nclass PostSerializer(serializers.ModelSerializer):\n    author = UserSerializer(read_only=True)\n    comments = CommentSerializer(many=True, read_only=True)\n    categories = CategorySerializer(many=True, read_only=True)\n\n    class Meta:\n        model = Post\n        fields = ('id', 'title', 'content', 'author', 'created_at', 'updated_at', 'categories', 'comments')\n</code></pre>\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Step 4. Create Views</strong></p>\n\n<p>Let’s create our views using DRF’s ViewSets in blog/views.py.<br>\n</p>\n\n<div class=\"highlight js-code-highlight\">\n<pre class=\"highlight plaintext\"><code>from rest_framework import viewsets\nfrom .models import Category, Post, Comment\nfrom .serializers import CategorySerializer, PostSerializer, CommentSerializer\nfrom rest_framework.permissions import IsAuthenticatedOrReadOnly\n\nclass CategoryViewSet(viewsets.ModelViewSet):\n    queryset = Category.objects.all()\n    serializer_class = CategorySerializer\n\nclass PostViewSet(viewsets.ModelViewSet):\n    queryset = Post.objects.all()\n    serializer_class = PostSerializer\n    permission_classes = [IsAuthenticatedOrReadOnly]\n\n    def perform_create(self, serializer):\n        serializer.save(author=self.request.user)\n\nclass CommentViewSet(viewsets.ModelViewSet):\n    queryset = Comment.objects.all()\n    serializer_class = CommentSerializer\n    permission_classes = [IsAuthenticatedOrReadOnly]\n\n    def perform_create(self, serializer):\n        post_id = self.kwargs.get('post_pk')\n        post = Post.objects.get(pk=post_id)\n        serializer.save(author=self.request.user, post=post)\n</code></pre>\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Step 5.

Takeaways:</strong></p>\n\n<p>✅ Threads are useful for I/O-bound tasks (e.g., network requests, file operations).<br>\n✅ Python threads run on a single CPU core due to the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL).<br>\n✅ Use join() to ensure a thread finishes before proceeding.</p>\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  3️⃣ Multiprocessing in Python (Parallelism for CPU-Bound Tasks)\n</h2>\n\n<p>For CPU-intensive tasks, Python provides the multiprocessing module to run code on multiple CPU cores.</p>\n\n<p><strong>✅ Basic Multiprocessing Example</strong><br>\n</p>\n\n<div class=\"highlight js-code-highlight\">\n<pre

El proyecto MIT Automated Programmed Tools (APT) dio origen a un nuevo lenguaje, también llamado APT, diseñado para controlar operaciones de fresado, revolucionando el control de la manufactura. Era como si un hechizo tecnológico hubiera transformado el proceso de fabricación.</p>\n\n<p>En una escena que evoca una película de ciencia ficción (recuerda, esto fue en 1959), un general de la Fuerza Aérea de EE. UU. predijo que esta tecnología permitiría la creación de una \"máquina de guerra invencible\". Un sentido de asombro y anticipación llenaba el aire mientras la nueva era de la manufactura tomaba forma.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2F5bsi7zx57kzt0otk9xxv.png\" class=\"article-body-image-wrapper\"><img src=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2F5bsi7zx57kzt0otk9xxv.png\" alt=\"Image description\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\"></a></p>\n\n<p>En medio de este telón de fondo, las máquinas, actuando como auténticos magos, cobraron vida. Con destreza mecánica, produjeron ceniceros conmemorativos para cada asistente, reliquias de la transformación impulsada por CAM. Esta tecnología representó un salto inimaginable en ese momento, y ahora algunos de nosotros tenemos impresoras 3D en casa, accediendo a la tecnología de fabricación como pasatiempo. 🛠️</p>\n\n<p><strong>Un Escenario Revolucionario</strong><br>\nAl igual que otros avances notables en el ámbito de la ingeniería de software, la era de la IA se ha arraigado firmemente y ha llegado para quedarse. </p>\n\n<p>Vivimos en un mundo totalmente dominado por el software. Construir, ejecutar y mantener este software nunca ha sido más complejo. Como desarrolladores, ya no basta con crear un gran producto; necesitamos construirlo de manera segura, rápida y frecuente. Una nueva experiencia de desarrollo aguarda, una en la que todo lo necesario para codificar de manera productiva, mantener el flujo y, en última instancia, encontrar alegría en nuestro trabajo, está al alcance. Así como el software transformó el mundo, ahora es el turno de la IA. Hoy aprenderemos cómo podemos aprovechar esta nueva fase en nuestro beneficio.</p>\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  <strong>La Evolución del Lenguaje</strong>\n</h2>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fc80q6anu7mt0lozy0a0d.png\" class=\"article-body-image-wrapper\"><img src=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fc80q6anu7mt0lozy0a0d.png\" alt=\"Image description\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\"></a><br>\nEl lenguaje natural se está convirtiendo en una herramienta esencial en el campo de la programación y la informática. No es necesariamente un \"lenguaje de programación\" en el sentido tradicional, pero cada vez desempeña un papel más vital en la interacción con sistemas informáticos y en la facilitación de tareas de desarrollo. Comunicarse con las máquinas en términos parecidos a los humanos está abriendo nuevas posibilidades y haciendo que la tecnología sea más accesible y eficiente.</p>\n\n<p><strong>El Arte de la Ingeniería de Prompts</strong><br>\nLa ingeniería de prompts implica el proceso de diseñar y optimizar \"prompts\" o instrucciones utilizadas para comunicarse con modelos de lenguaje como GPT-3. Estos modelos generan respuestas o realizan tareas en función de las instrucciones que reciben. Imagina que estás creando una invitación para Alan. La ingeniería de prompts se está convirtiendo en una habilidad valiosa para desarrollar aplicaciones y servicios basados en lenguaje natural.</p>\n\n<p>La belleza de los modelos de lenguaje modernos y las bibliotecas disponibles es que no necesariamente tienes que comprender los intrincados detalles internos para usarlos de manera efectiva. Con una comprensión básica de cómo integrar estos modelos en nuestras aplicaciones y servicios, podemos aprovechar eficientemente su potencial.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fkfu894kc1gvuetucvjv1.png\" class=\"article-body-image-wrapper\"><img src=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fkfu894kc1gvuetucvjv1.png\" alt=\"Image description\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\"></a></p>\n\n<p>El diagrama comienza a la izquierda con la entrada de pestañas abiertas, datos del editor y bases de datos vectoriales, que alimentan una biblioteca de prompts. Estos elementos luego pasan al prompt, que atraviesa un modelo de filtro contextual y un modelo GPT. (En el contexto de Copilot, por ejemplo, se trabaja constantemente en motores de modelo nuevos y mejorados optimizados para el desarrollo.) Este modelo proporciona completaciones para llenar en el medio del prefijo y el sufijo del prompt. A partir de los modelos, se generan n completaciones y se muestran como n completaciones menores o iguales.</p>\n\n<p>Puedes pensar en los prompts como argumentos en una función, y el Modelo de Lenguaje (ML) como la función específica a la que proporcionas estos argumentos. En este contexto, cada solicitud es una entrada que se le da a la función, y el ML procesa estas entradas, aplicando reglas y algoritmos definidos, para producir una respuesta o resultado. Es una forma de comprender cómo interactúas con el modelo y cómo puedes manipular y controlar su comportamiento.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Descifrando la Esencia de un Prompt</strong><br>\nAprovechar eficazmente el poder de los prompts nos permite utilizar estos encantamientos lingüísticos. Pero en su núcleo, ¿qué constituye exactamente un prompt?</p>\n\n<p>Un prompt se compone de cinco componentes fundamentales: un marco de contexto rico, instrucciones (que pueden abarcar directivas individuales o múltiples, e incluso preguntas), ejemplos ilustrativos y una estructura de salida deseada especificada. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2F1bzvaj4cf950n2l1we0l.png\" class=\"article-body-image-wrapper\"><img src=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2F1bzvaj4cf950n2l1we0l.png\" alt=\"Image description\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\"></a></p>\n\n<p>Sin embargo, es importante destacar que ninguno de estos componentes es obligatorio. Como enfoque alternativo, es viable iniciar una oración directamente y aprovechar las capacidades del modelo.

De ellos, 45 contaron con la asistencia de GitHub Copilot, mientras que los otros 45 trabajaron sin él. Al analizar los resultados, descubrimos que el 78% de los desarrolladores que utilizaron Copilot completaron la tarea, en comparación con el 70% que no lo usó. Sin embargo, la cifra más impactante, en mi opinión, radica en el tiempo necesario para finalizar la tarea. Aquellos que colaboraron con GitHub Copilot terminaron en tan solo 1 hora y 11 minutos, en contraste con los 2 horas y 41 minutos que les tomó a quienes trabajaron sin él.</p>\n\n<p>En conclusión, nuestro experimento en el ámbito del desarrollo web con JavaScript, que involucró a 90 desarrolladores divididos equitativamente entre aquellos que utilizaron GitHub Copilot y aquellos que trabajaron de manera independiente, ha arrojado perspicaces conclusiones. Las estadísticas revelan que Copilot mejoró significativamente las tasas de finalización de tareas, con un 78% de los desarrolladores que aprovecharon su asistencia logrando completar exitosamente sus asignaciones, en contraste con el 70% que confió únicamente en sus habilidades.</p>\n\n<p>No obstante, la revelación más destacada radica en la eficiencia en el tiempo lograda a través del uso colaborativo de GitHub Copilot. Los desarrolladores que adoptaron Copilot y participaron en la programación en pareja completaron sus tareas en un sorprendentemente ágil tiempo de 1 hora y 11 minutos, en comparación con las 2 horas y 41 minutos que tomaron sus contrapartes que trabajaron sin la ayuda de Copilot.</p>\n\n<p>Este experimento subraya el potencial transformador de herramientas impulsadas por IA como GitHub Copilot en el desarrollo de software. No solo Copilot aumenta las tasas de finalización de tareas, sino que también acelera significativamente el proceso de desarrollo, demostrando el valor de la colaboración inteligente entre los desarrolladores humanos y la tecnología de vanguardia. Al encontrarnos en la intersección entre la creatividad humana y el avance de la IA, la colaboración entre estas fuerzas tiene el potencial de reformar el panorama del desarrollo de software y allanar el camino para nuevas cotas de eficiencia e innovación.</p>\n\n","contentLength":0,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"🔥 13 Most Exciting GitHub Projects This Week - 2025-02-19","url":"https://dev.to/bruh_buh_f683772f171823db/13-most-exciting-github-projects-this-week-2025-02-19-280c","date":1739967760,"author":"Bruh Buh","guid":5784,"unread":true,"content":"<h1>\n  \n  \n  🔥 13 Most Exciting GitHub Projects This Week - 2025-02-19\n</h1>\n\n<p>Every week, thousands of developers contribute to exciting new projects on GitHub.

What are Decorators\n</h2>\n\n<p>In Python, a decorator is essentially a Python function. It has unique capabilities that allow it to add additional functionality to other functions without modifying their original code. The return value of a decorator is also a function object. In simple terms, it is a function specifically designed to return another function.</p>\n\n<p>Decorators play a crucial role in many scenarios where aspect - oriented requirements exist. For example:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Inserting Logs</strong>: Facilitates recording the execution process and relevant information of functions, which is helpful for debugging and system monitoring.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Performance Testing</strong>: Can calculate the execution time of a function, thereby evaluating its performance.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Transaction Processing</strong>: Ensures that a series of operations either all succeed or all fail, guaranteeing data consistency and integrity.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Caching</strong>: For functions with high computational costs, caches their calculation results. When the same input occurs next time, it directly returns the cached value, improving efficiency.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Permission Verification</strong>: Checks whether a user has the corresponding permissions before executing a function, ensuring the security of the system.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Decorators provide an excellent design solution for solving such problems. By using decorators, we can extract a large amount of code that is unrelated to the core functionality of the function but appears repeatedly, achieving high - level code reuse.</p>\n\n<p>In summary, the core function of a decorator is to add additional functionality to existing objects, making the code structure clearer and the functions more abundant and flexible.</p>\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  II. Why are Decorators Needed\n</h2>\n\n<h3>\n  \n  \n  (I) A Simple Example\n</h3>\n\n<p>First, consider a simple function:<br>\n</p>\n\n<div class=\"highlight js-code-highlight\">\n<pre class=\"highlight python\"><code><span class=\"k\">def</span> <span class=\"nf\">foo</span><span class=\"p\">():</span>\n    <span class=\"nf\">print</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"sh\">'</span><span class=\"s\">i am foo</span><span class=\"sh\">'</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n</code></pre>\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>This function simply prints the string <code>i am foo</code>.</p>\n\n<h3>\n  \n  \n  (II) Adding Requirements\n</h3>\n\n<p>Now, there is a new requirement to record the execution log of the function. So, add log - related code to the code:<br>\n</p>\n\n<div class=\"highlight js-code-highlight\">\n<pre class=\"highlight python\"><code><span class=\"k\">def</span> <span class=\"nf\">foo</span><span class=\"p\">():</span>\n    <span class=\"nf\">print</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"sh\">'</span><span class=\"s\">i am foo</span><span class=\"sh\">'</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n    <span class=\"nf\">print</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"sh\">\"</span><span class=\"s\">foo is running</span><span class=\"sh\">\"</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n</code></pre>\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>At this point, the <code>foo</code> function, in addition to its original functionality, has added the function of printing logs.</p>\n\n<h3>\n  \n  \n  (III) Requirements for More Functions\n</h3>\n\n<p>Suppose there are 100 functions that all need to add such log - recording requirements, and in the future, it may be necessary to add the requirement of printing logs before execution for these 100 functions. If we modify the function code one by one, a large amount of duplicate code will be generated, which is obviously not a good solution.</p>\n\n<p>To reduce duplicate code writing, we can re - define a function to specifically handle log - related operations. After the log processing is completed, the actual business code is executed. An example is as follows:<br>\n</p>\n\n<div class=\"highlight js-code-highlight\">\n<pre class=\"highlight python\"><code><span class=\"k\">def</span> <span class=\"nf\">use_logging</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">func</span><span class=\"p\">):</span>\n    <span class=\"nf\">print</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"sh\">\"</span><span class=\"s\">%s is running</span><span class=\"sh\">\"</span> <span class=\"o\">%</span> <span class=\"n\">func</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"n\">__name__</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n    <span class=\"nf\">func</span><span class=\"p\">()</span>\n\n<span class=\"k\">def</span> <span class=\"nf\">bar</span><span class=\"p\">():</span>\n    <span class=\"nf\">print</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"sh\">'</span><span class=\"s\">i am bar</span><span class=\"sh\">'</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n\n<span class=\"nf\">use_logging</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">bar</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n</code></pre>\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>The running result is:<br>\n</p>\n\n<div class=\"highlight js-code-highlight\">\n<pre class=\"highlight plaintext\"><code>bar is running\ni am bar\n</code></pre>\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>In this example, the function <code>use_logging</code> is a decorator. It wraps the <code>func</code> that executes the actual business method inside the function. Formally, it seems that the <code>bar</code> function is decorated by <code>use_logging</code>. The log - recording operations when the function enters and exits are called an aspect, and this programming method is called Aspect - Oriented Programming.</p>\n\n<p>Through this <code>use_logging</code> function, we have successfully added a logging function to the function. In the future, no matter how many functions need to add a logging function, or if we need to modify the log format, we only need to modify the <code>use_logging</code> function and call <code>use_logging(the decorated function)</code> to achieve the desired effect. For example:<br>\n</p>\n\n<div class=\"highlight js-code-highlight\">\n<pre class=\"highlight python\"><code><span class=\"k\">def</span> <span class=\"nf\">use_logging</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">func</span><span class=\"p\">):</span>\n    <span class=\"nf\">print</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"sh\">\"</span><span class=\"s\">%s is running</span><span class=\"sh\">\"</span> <span class=\"o\">%</span> <span class=\"n\">func</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"n\">__name__</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n    <span class=\"k\">return</span> <span class=\"n\">func</span>\n\n<span class=\"nd\">@use_logging</span>\n<span class=\"k\">def</span> <span class=\"nf\">bar</span><span class=\"p\">():</span>\n    <span class=\"nf\">print</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"sh\">'</span><span class=\"s\">i am bar</span><span class=\"sh\">'</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n\n<span class=\"nf\">bar</span><span class=\"p\">()</span>\n</code></pre>\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  III. Introduction to Basic Decorators\n</h2>\n\n<h3>\n  \n  \n  (I) Decorator Syntax Sugar\n</h3>\n\n<p>Python provides the <code>@</code> symbol as the syntax sugar for decorators, which makes it more convenient for us to apply decorating functions. However, there is a requirement for using syntax sugar, that is, the decorating function must return a function object. Therefore, we usually wrap the function to be decorated with an inner function and return this inner function.</p>\n\n<p>Take the following code as an example. The decorator <code>use_logging</code> is equivalent to first executing this function and then returning the decorated function <code>bar</code>. So when <code>bar()</code> is called, it is actually equivalent to executing two functions, which is equivalent to directly calling <code>use_logging(bar)()</code>.<br>\n</p>\n\n<div class=\"highlight js-code-highlight\">\n<pre class=\"highlight python\"><code><span class=\"k\">def</span> <span class=\"nf\">use_logging</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">func</span><span class=\"p\">):</span>\n    <span class=\"k\">def</span> <span class=\"nf\">_deco</span><span class=\"p\">():</span>\n        <span class=\"nf\">print</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"sh\">\"</span><span class=\"s\">%s is running</span><span class=\"sh\">\"</span> <span class=\"o\">%</span> <span class=\"n\">func</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"n\">__name__</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n        <span class=\"nf\">func</span><span class=\"p\">()</span>\n    <span class=\"k\">return</span> <span class=\"n\">_deco</span>\n\n<span class=\"nd\">@use_logging</span>\n<span class=\"k\">def</span> <span class=\"nf\">bar</span><span class=\"p\">():</span>\n    <span class=\"nf\">print</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"sh\">'</span><span class=\"s\">i am bar</span><span class=\"sh\">'</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n\n<span class=\"nf\">bar</span><span class=\"p\">()</span>\n</code></pre>\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<h3>\n  \n  \n  (II) Decorating Functions with Parameters\n</h3>\n\n<p>When our function needs to receive two parameters and perform calculations, we need to make corresponding changes to the inner function to receive the two parameters <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> passed in. At this time, calling <code>bar(1, 2)</code> is equivalent to calling <code>use_logging(bar)(1, 2)</code>. The sample code is as follows:<br>\n</p>\n\n<div class=\"highlight js-code-highlight\">\n<pre class=\"highlight python\"><code><span class=\"k\">def</span> <span class=\"nf\">use_logging</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">func</span><span class=\"p\">):</span>\n    <span class=\"k\">def</span> <span class=\"nf\">_deco</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">a</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"n\">b</span><span class=\"p\">):</span>\n        <span class=\"nf\">print</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"sh\">\"</span><span class=\"s\">%s is running</span><span class=\"sh\">\"</span> <span class=\"o\">%</span> <span class=\"n\">func</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"n\">__name__</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n        <span class=\"nf\">func</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">a</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"n\">b</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n    <span class=\"k\">return</span> <span class=\"n\">_deco</span>\n\n<span class=\"nd\">@use_logging</span>\n<span class=\"k\">def</span> <span class=\"nf\">bar</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">a</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"n\">b</span><span class=\"p\">):</span>\n    <span class=\"nf\">print</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"sh\">'</span><span class=\"s\">i am bar:%s</span><span class=\"sh\">'</span> <span class=\"o\">%</span> <span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">a</span> <span class=\"o\">+</span> <span class=\"n\">b</span><span class=\"p\">))</span>\n\n<span class=\"nf\">bar</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"mi\">1</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"mi\">2</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n</code></pre>\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>However, in practical applications, the number and types of parameters of the functions we decorate may vary. It is obviously not scientific to modify the decorator for different parameter situations each time. To solve this parameter problem, we can use Python's variable - length parameters <code>*args</code> and <code>**kwargs</code>.</p>\n\n<h3>\n  \n  \n  (III) Uncertain Number of Function Parameters\n</h3>\n\n<p>The following is the version of the decorator without parameters, and this format is suitable for decorating functions without parameters. By using <code>*args</code> and <code>**kwargs</code>, our decorator can already adapt to parameters of various lengths and types, that is, this version of the decorator can decorate any type of parameter - free function. The sample code is as follows:<br>\n</p>\n\n<div class=\"highlight js-code-highlight\">\n<pre class=\"highlight python\"><code><span class=\"k\">def</span> <span class=\"nf\">use_logging</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">func</span><span class=\"p\">):</span>\n    <span class=\"k\">def</span> <span class=\"nf\">_deco</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"o\">*</span><span class=\"n\">args</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"o\">**</span><span class=\"n\">kwargs</span><span class=\"p\">):</span>\n        <span class=\"nf\">print</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"sh\">\"</span><span class=\"s\">%s is running</span><span class=\"sh\">\"</span> <span class=\"o\">%</span> <span class=\"n\">func</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"n\">__name__</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n        <span class=\"nf\">func</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"o\">*</span><span class=\"n\">args</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"o\">**</span><span class=\"n\">kwargs</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n    <span class=\"k\">return</span> <span class=\"n\">_deco</span>\n\n<span class=\"nd\">@use_logging</span>\n<span class=\"k\">def</span> <span class=\"nf\">bar</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">a</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"n\">b</span><span class=\"p\">):</span>\n    <span class=\"nf\">print</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"sh\">'</span><span class=\"s\">i am bar:%s</span><span class=\"sh\">'</span> <span class=\"o\">%</span> <span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">a</span> <span class=\"o\">+</span> <span class=\"n\">b</span><span class=\"p\">))</span>\n\n\n<span class=\"nd\">@use_logging</span>\n<span class=\"k\">def</span> <span class=\"nf\">foo</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">a</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"n\">b</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"n\">c</span><span class=\"p\">):</span>\n    <span class=\"nf\">print</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"sh\">'</span><span class=\"s\">i am bar:%s</span><span class=\"sh\">'</span> <span class=\"o\">%</span> <span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">a</span> <span class=\"o\">+</span> <span class=\"n\">b</span> <span class=\"o\">+</span> <span class=\"n\">c</span><span class=\"p\">))</span>\n\n\n<span class=\"nf\">bar</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"mi\">1</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"mi\">2</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n<span class=\"nf\">foo</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"mi\">1</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"mi\">2</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"mi\">3</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n</code></pre>\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<h3>\n  \n  \n  (IV) Decorators with Parameters\n</h3>\n\n<p>In some cases, we need to make the decorator take parameters. This requires writing a higher - order function that returns a decorator, which is relatively more complex to implement.

For example, information such as the function's <code>docstring</code>, <code>__name__</code>, and parameter list. First, look at the following example:<br>\n</p>\n\n<div class=\"highlight js-code-highlight\">\n<pre class=\"highlight python\"><code><span class=\"k\">def</span> <span class=\"nf\">use_logging</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">func</span><span class=\"p\">):</span>\n    <span class=\"k\">def</span> <span class=\"nf\">_deco</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"o\">*</span><span class=\"n\">args</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"o\">**</span><span class=\"n\">kwargs</span><span class=\"p\">):</span>\n        <span class=\"nf\">print</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"sh\">\"</span><span class=\"s\">%s is running</span><span class=\"sh\">\"</span> <span class=\"o\">%</span> <span class=\"n\">func</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"n\">__name__</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n        <span class=\"nf\">func</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"o\">*</span><span class=\"n\">args</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"o\">**</span><span class=\"n\">kwargs</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n    <span class=\"k\">return</span> <span class=\"n\">_deco</span>\n\n\n<span class=\"nd\">@use_logging</span>\n<span class=\"k\">def</span> <span class=\"nf\">bar</span><span class=\"p\">():</span>\n    <span class=\"nf\">print</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"sh\">'</span><span class=\"s\">i am bar</span><span class=\"sh\">'</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n    <span class=\"nf\">print</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">bar</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"n\">__name__</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n\n\n<span class=\"nf\">bar</span><span class=\"p\">()</span>\n<span class=\"c1\"># The output result is:\n# bar is running\n# i am bar\n# _deco\n</span></code></pre>\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>It can be seen that the function name has become <code>_deco</code> instead of the original <code>bar</code>. When we use reflection features, this situation will cause problems. To solve this problem, we can introduce <code>functools.wraps</code>. The sample code using <code>functools.wraps</code> is as follows:<br>\n</p>\n\n<div class=\"highlight js-code-highlight\">\n<pre class=\"highlight python\"><code><span class=\"kn\">import</span> <span class=\"n\">functools</span>\n\n\n<span class=\"k\">def</span> <span class=\"nf\">use_logging</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">func</span><span class=\"p\">):</span>\n    <span class=\"nd\">@functools.wraps</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">func</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n    <span class=\"k\">def</span> <span class=\"nf\">_deco</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"o\">*</span><span class=\"n\">args</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"o\">**</span><span class=\"n\">kwargs</span><span class=\"p\">):</span>\n        <span class=\"nf\">print</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"sh\">\"</span><span class=\"s\">%s is running</span><span class=\"sh\">\"</span> <span class=\"o\">%</span> <span class=\"n\">func</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"n\">__name__</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n        <span class=\"nf\">func</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"o\">*</span><span class=\"n\">args</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"o\">**</span><span class=\"n\">kwargs</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n    <span class=\"k\">return</span> <span class=\"n\">_deco</span>\n\n\n<span class=\"nd\">@use_logging</span>\n<span class=\"k\">def</span> <span class=\"nf\">bar</span><span class=\"p\">():</span>\n    <span class=\"nf\">print</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"sh\">'</span><span class=\"s\">i am bar</span><span class=\"sh\">'</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n    <span class=\"nf\">print</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">bar</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"n\">__name__</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n\n\n<span class=\"nf\">bar</span><span class=\"p\">()</span>\n<span class=\"c1\"># The output result is:\n# bar is running\n# i am bar\n# bar\n</span></code></pre>\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>As can be seen from the above results, after using <code>functools.wraps</code>, we get the expected result and successfully retain the name of the original function.</p>\n\n<h3>\n  \n  \n  (VI) Achieving Adaptability for Decorators with and without Parameters\n</h3>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"highlight js-code-highlight\">\n<pre class=\"highlight python\"><code><span class=\"kn\">import</span> <span class=\"n\">functools</span>\n\n\n<span class=\"k\">def</span> <span class=\"nf\">use_logging</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">arg</span><span class=\"p\">):</span>\n    <span class=\"k\">if</span> <span class=\"nf\">callable</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">arg</span><span class=\"p\">):</span>  <span class=\"c1\"># Determine whether the passed parameter is a function.

Follow a Clean Folder Structure</strong></p>\n\n<p>For larger projects, use the following structure:<br>\n</p>\n\n<div class=\"highlight js-code-highlight\">\n<pre class=\"highlight shell\"><code>my_project/\n│── main.py  <span class=\"c\"># Entry point of the application</span>\n│── modules/  <span class=\"c\"># Custom modules</span>\n│   │── __init__.py\n│   │── utils.py\n│   │── database.py\n│── tests/  <span class=\"c\"># Unit tests</span>\n│── README.md  <span class=\"c\"># Documentation</span>\n│── requirements.txt  <span class=\"c\"># Dependencies</span>\n</code></pre>\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>✅ 2. Use Meaningful Module and Package Names</strong></p>\n\n<div class=\"highlight js-code-highlight\">\n<pre class=\"highlight plaintext\"><code>Good: data_processing.py, user_auth.py\nBad: stuff.py, temp.py\n</code></pre>\n\n</div>\n\n<p><strong>✅ 3. Avoid Circular Imports</strong></p>\n\n<p>If module_a.py imports module_b.py, and module_b.py imports module_a.py, it creates a circular dependency.</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>✅ Solution: Move shared logic to a separate module.</em></strong></p>\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  🔹 Conclusion\n</h2>\n\n<p>✅ Modules help organize Python code into reusable files.<br>\n✅ Packages group related modules together for better project structure.<br>\n✅ Built-in modules like math, random, and os provide powerful utilities.<br>\n✅ Best practices like structured folders and avoiding circular imports improve maintainability.</p>\n\n<p>Mastering modules and packages will help you write scalable and maintainable Python applications. 🚀</p>\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  What’s Next?\n</h2>\n\n<p>In the next post, we’ll explore File Handling in Python, including reading/writing files, working with CSV/JSON, and handling exceptions.

These AI hormones are specialized skills with a shallow reference attribute to the Chobit Object, allowing them to interact and manage other skills in real-time. Here's how AI hormones work:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>\n<strong>Add or Remove Skills</strong>: AI hormones can add or remove (non-AI hormone) skills from the Chobit.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Skill Awareness</strong>: AI hormones are aware of the skills the Chobit is equipped with and can access these skills' notes via their skillNotes method.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Custom Logic</strong>: Each AI hormone can use custom logic to manage skills, such as enabling a set of skills for a specific duration, similar to how biological hormones regulate bodily functions.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h3>\n  \n  \n  Key Concepts\n</h3>\n\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Chobit Object</strong>: The core object that holds various skills.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>addSkillAware Method</strong>: Adds self-aware skills, also known as AI Hormones (with Chobit attribute), to the Chobit Object.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>\n  \n  \n  Examples\n</h3>\n\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Adding an Awareness Skill</strong>:\n</li>\n</ul>\n\n<div class=\"highlight js-code-highlight\">\n<pre class=\"highlight python\"><code>  <span class=\"n\">brain</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nf\">add_skillAware</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nc\">AHAware</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">brain</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"n\">logicChobit</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"sh\">\"</span><span class=\"s\">potato</span><span class=\"sh\">\"</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"sh\">\"</span><span class=\"s\">fukurou</span><span class=\"sh\">\"</span><span class=\"p\">))</span>\n</code></pre>\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Removing a Skill</strong> (from AHAware's input method):\n</li>\n</ul>\n\n<div class=\"highlight js-code-highlight\">\n<pre class=\"highlight python\"><code>  <span class=\"n\">self</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"n\">chobit</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nf\">removeSkill</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">self</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"n\">chobit</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"n\">_dClasses</span><span class=\"p\">[</span><span class=\"n\">index</span><span class=\"p\">])</span>\n</code></pre>\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>These examples show how AI Hormones enable dynamic skill management using self-awareness, much like a command terminal or shell. Self-aware skills can add or remove other skills while the LivinGrimoire is running.</p>\n\n<h3>\n  \n  \n  Comparison to Biological Hormones\n</h3>\n\n<p>Biological hormones play a crucial role in regulating various bodily functions by acting as chemical messengers. They are released by glands and travel through the bloodstream to target organs, where they trigger specific responses. Here are some key parallels between AI Hormones in LivinGrimoire and biological hormones:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Regulation and Management</strong>:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Biological Hormones</strong>: Regulate processes such as growth, metabolism, and mood. For example, insulin regulates blood sugar levels, and cortisol helps the body respond to stress.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>AI Hormones</strong>: Regulate the addition and removal of skills in the Chobit, enabling dynamic adaptation based on current needs and conditions.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Targeted Action</strong>:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Biological Hormones</strong>: Act on specific target organs or tissues to elicit a response. For instance, adrenaline increases heart rate and energy levels in response to stress.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>AI Hormones</strong>: Target specific skills within the Chobit, enabling or disabling them based on custom logic, much like how hormones activate or deactivate certain cellular processes.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Feedback Mechanisms</strong>:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Biological Hormones</strong>: Operate within feedback loops to maintain homeostasis. For example, the release of thyroid hormones is regulated by feedback from the hypothalamus and pituitary gland.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>AI Hormones</strong>: Can use feedback from the Chobit’s skill set and environment to adjust skill management dynamically, ensuring optimal performance and adaptability.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Temporal Control</strong>:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Biological Hormones</strong>: Can have short-term or long-term effects depending on the hormone and its function. For example, melatonin regulates sleep cycles, while growth hormones have long-term effects on development.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>AI Hormones</strong>: Can enable or disable skills for specific periods, allowing temporary boosts or reductions in certain capabilities, similar to how hormones might prepare the body for immediate action or long-term changes.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h3>\n  \n  \n  Final Thoughts\n</h3>\n\n<p>The concept of AI Hormones in LivinGrimoire offers a powerful tool for dynamic skill management, drawing inspiration from the sophisticated mechanisms of biological hormones. By integrating self-aware skills that can regulate other skills in real-time, LivinGrimoire mimics the adaptive and regulatory functions seen in living organisms. This innovation not only enhances the AI's capabilities but also brings a new level of complexity and adaptability to the system, much like the intricate dance of hormones within the human body.</p>\n\n","contentLength":0,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"From JavaScript to Python - Day 1","url":"https://dev.to/jgar514/from-javascript-to-python-day-1-413h","date":1739938625,"author":"Joshua Garvey","guid":5566,"unread":true,"content":"<p>I'm going to be converting my notes as I learn Python into blog posts by comparing it to a language I already know - JavaScript.

A Beginner's Guide to Attention","url":"https://dev.to/angu10/ever-wonder-how-ai-sees-like-you-do-a-beginners-guide-to-attention-30m3","date":1739930721,"author":"angu10","guid":4537,"unread":true,"content":"<h2>\n  \n  \n  Understanding Attention in Large Language Models: A Beginner's Guide\n</h2>\n\n<p>Have you ever wondered how ChatGPT or other AI models can understand and respond to your messages so well? The secret lies in a mechanism called ATTENTION - a crucial component that helps these models understand relationships between words and generate meaningful responses. Let's break it down in simple terms!</p>\n\n<h3>\n  \n  \n  What is Attention?\n</h3>\n\n<p>Imagine you're reading a long sentence: \"The cat sat on the mat because it was comfortable.\" When you read \"it,\" your brain naturally connects back to either \"the cat\" or \"the mat\" to understand what \"it\" refers to. This is exactly what attention does in AI models - it helps the model figure out which words are related to each other.</p>\n\n<h3>\n  \n  \n  How Does Attention Work?\n</h3>\n\n<p>The attention mechanism works like a spotlight that can focus on different words when processing each word in a sentence. Here's a simple breakdown:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li> For each word, the model calculates how important every other word is in relation to it.</li>\n<li> It then uses these importance scores to create a weighted combination of all words.</li>\n<li> This helps the model understand context and relationships between words.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Let's visualize this with an example:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fmnmsyiealc4pjtqe8ufm.png\" class=\"article-body-image-wrapper\"><img src=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fmnmsyiealc4pjtqe8ufm.png\" alt=\"Image description\" width=\"800\" height=\"1309\"></a></p>\n\n<p>In this diagram, the word \"it\" is paying attention to all other words in the sentence. The thickness of the arrows could represent the attention weights. The model would likely assign higher attention weights to \"cat\" and \"mat\" to determine which one \"it\" refers to.</p>\n\n<h3>\n  \n  \n  Multi-Head Attention: Looking at Things from Different Angles\n</h3>\n\n<p>In modern language models, we don't just use one attention mechanism - we use several in parallel! This is called Multi-Head Attention. Each \"head\" can focus on different types of relationships between words.</p>\n\n<p>Let's consider the sentence: The chef who won the competition prepared a delicious meal.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>  Head 1 could focus on subject-verb relationships (chef - prepared)</li>\n<li>  Head 2 might attend to adjective-noun pairs (delicious - meal)</li>\n<li>  Head 3 could look at broader context (competition - meal)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Here's a diagram:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fbg4zwcmb6dz3jfu31p40.png\" class=\"article-body-image-wrapper\"><img src=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fbg4zwcmb6dz3jfu31p40.png\" alt=\"Image description\" width=\"800\" height=\"306\"></a></p>\n\n<p>This multi-headed approach helps the model understand text from different perspectives, just like how we humans might read a sentence multiple times to understand different aspects of its meaning.</p>\n\n<h3>\n  \n  \n  Why Attention Matters\n</h3>\n\n<p>Attention mechanisms have revolutionized natural language processing because they:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li> Handle long-range dependencies better than previous methods.</li>\n<li> Can process input sequences in parallel.</li>\n<li> Create interpretable connections between words.</li>\n<li> Allow models to focus on relevant information while ignoring irrelevant parts.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h3>\n  \n  \n  Recent Developments and Research\n</h3>\n\n<p>The field of LLMs is rapidly evolving, with new techniques and insights emerging regularly. Here are a few areas of active research:</p>\n\n<h4>\n  \n  \n  Contextual Hallucinations\n</h4>\n\n<p>Large language models (LLMs) can sometimes hallucinate details and respond with unsubstantiated answers that are inaccurate with respect to the input context.</p>\n\n<p>The Lookback Lens technique analyzes attention patterns to detect when a model might be generating information not present in the input context.</p>\n\n<h4>\n  \n  \n  Extending Context Window\n</h4>\n\n<p>Researchers are working on extending the context window sizes of LLMs, allowing them to process longer text sequences.</p>\n\n<h3>\n  \n  \n  Conclusion\n</h3>\n\n<p>While the math behind attention mechanisms can be complex, the core idea is simple: help the model focus on the most relevant parts of the input when processing each word. This allows language models to understand the context and relationships between words better, leading to more accurate and coherent responses.</p>\n\n<p>Remember, this is just a high-level overview - there's much more to learn about attention mechanisms! Hopefully, this will give you a good foundation for understanding how modern AI models process and understand text.</p>\n\n","contentLength":0,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"JPEG in PyTorch","url":"https://dev.to/hyperkai/jpeg-in-pytorch-11kl","date":1739929787,"author":"Super Kai (Kazuya Ito)","guid":4536,"unread":true,"content":"<p><a href=\"//ko-fi.com/superkai\">Buy Me a Coffee</a>☕</p>\n\n<p>*Memos:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>\n<a href=\"https://dev.to/hyperkai/oxfordiiitpet-in-pytorch-17kk\">My post</a> explains <a href=\"https://pytorch.org/vision/stable/generated/torchvision.datasets.OxfordIIITPet.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">OxfordIIITPet()</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://pytorch.org/vision/main/generated/torchvision.transforms.v2.JPEG.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">JPEG()</a> can randomly apply JPEG compression to an image as shown below:</p>\n\n<p>*Memos:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>The 1st argument for initialization is <code>quality</code>(Required-Type:<code>int</code>):\n*Memos:\n\n<ul>\n<li>It's the range of the quality <code>[min, max]</code> so it must be <code>min &lt;= max</code>.</li>\n<li>It must be <code>0 &lt;= x &lt;= 100</code>.</li>\n<li>A tuple/list must be the 1D with 2 elements.</li>\n<li>A single value means <code>[quality, quality]</code>.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n</li>\n\n<li>There is the 1st argument(Required-Type:<code>PIL Image</code> or <code>tensor</code>(<code>int</code>(<code>uint8</code>))). *A tensor must be 3D.</li>\n\n<li>\n<code>v2</code> is recommended to use according to <a href=\"https://pytorch.org/vision/0.20/transforms.html#v1-or-v2-which-one-should-i-use\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">V1 or V2?

For small projects, and hobby projects, it's free. 🎉\n\n!!! note I'm not affiliated with Render, and they do not sponsor me in any way.\n\nAfter you create an account, you'll see this **Overview** page:\n\n![Render Deployment](https://cdn.zuplo.com/www/media/posts/2025-01-26-fastapi-tutorial/image.png)\n\nClick on the **Deploy a Web Service**, and you'll see this page:\n\n![Deploy a web service](https://cdn.zuplo.com/www/media/posts/2025-01-26-fastapi-tutorial/image-1.png)\n\nIf there's no repository on the list, you can click on the **Credentials** tab, and connect to your GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket account.\n\nI usually only give permissions to the repositories I want to deploy. I follow the security principle of least privilege, whenever possible. 🤓\n\nCool! Now we can select the repository, and configure the deployment settings.\n\n![Render deployment settings](https://cdn.zuplo.com/www/media/posts/2025-01-26-fastapi-tutorial/image-2.png)\n\nYou shouldn't need to change anything here, maybe you can select a region closer to you. I live in The Netherlands, so I selected Frankfurt.\n\nIf you go down, you'll see the **Build command**, change it to:\n\n\n\n```bash\npip install fastapi uvicorn\n</code></pre>\n\n</div>\n\n\n<p>You can also change it to <code>pip install -r requirements.txt</code>, and create a <code>requirements.txt</code> file with the dependencies. For now, we'll keep it simple.</p>\n\n<p>On the <strong>Start command</strong>, change it to:<br>\n</p>\n\n<div class=\"highlight js-code-highlight\">\n<pre class=\"highlight shell\"><code>uvicorn main:app <span class=\"nt\">--host</span> 0.0.0.0\n</code></pre>\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>Just remove the <code>--reload</code> flag from the command we ran before, because that flag is only for development.</p>\n\n<p>On the <strong>Instance Type</strong>, select the <strong>Free</strong> plan. Since we're just playing around, we don't need to pay for it. 🎉</p>\n\n<p>Let's click on <strong>Deploy Web Service</strong>, and that's it! 🚀</p>\n\n<p>Wait a few minutes, and you'll be able to go to <code>https://&lt;your_project_name&gt;.onrender.com/docs</code> and see the Swagger UI documentation generated by FastAPI.</p>\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  Explore Zuplo's features\n</h2>\n\n<p>I haven't used <strong>Zuplo</strong> before, so I'm going to explore it with you. 🚀</p>\n\n<p>Let's go to <a href=\"https://portal.zuplo.com/?utm_source=blog\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Zuplo's Portal</a>, and create an account.

The <code>get_historic_price</code> params are manipulated to be the options/params of the request.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Data Processing:</strong> The response to the request has the relevant price data extracted and converted into floats.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Create DataFrame:</strong> The organized data is transformed into a DataFrame through the method of <code>.DataFrame()</code>The field <code>CloseTime</code> is converted and set and the DataFrame is returned.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  Creating Fetch Parameters\n</h2>\n\n<p>Now that the fetch function is created, it requires the parameters of the symbol and data. </p>\n\n<p>When working with time-series data, you may need to fetch data from a specific time range. Pandas provide convenient functions to manipulate dates and times.<br>\n</p>\n\n<div class=\"highlight js-code-highlight\">\n<pre class=\"highlight plaintext\"><code>last_week = (pd.Timestamp.now() - pd.offsets.Day(7)) # Pandas function to get the current date and time - 7 days\n</code></pre>\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<h3>\n  \n  \n  Pandas methods\n</h3>\n\n<ol>\n<li>\n<code>.Timestamp.now()</code> - Gets the current date and time.</li>\n<li>\n<code>.offsets.Days(7)</code> - Represents an offset of 7 days </li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>The variable <code>last_week</code> reflects the current date minus seven days, making it exactly one week ago.</p>\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  Calling the fetch\n</h2>\n\n<p>After the <code>last_week</code> variable is set, we can call the fetch on the historical Bitcoin (BTC). The returned data is formatted into a Pandas DataFrame, making it easier for future analysis and visualization.<br>\n</p>\n\n<div class=\"highlight js-code-highlight\">\n<pre class=\"highlight plaintext\"><code>btc = get_historic_price('btc', after=last_week) # running fetch\n</code></pre>\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  Data Inspection &amp; Exploration\n</h2>\n\n<p>Before diving into data analysis, it's crucial to inspect and explore the dataset.

It provides you with powerful features while still remaining fairly unopinionated (relative to something like Django).</p>\n\n<p>In this post, we’ll create a full example backend that includes libraries/tools you’ll need to get ready to ship to production. Here’s a quick rundown of what we’ll use:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p><a href=\"https://github.com/amacneil/dbmate\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>dbmate</strong></a> – A simple, language-agnostic approach to managing database migrations.</p></li>\n<li><p><a href=\"https://pugsql.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>PugSQL</strong></a> – For interacting with your database.

It’s “the most widely used data validation library for Python” and integrates easily with FastAPI.</p></li>\n<li><p><a href=\"https://github.com/ai/nanoid\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>nanoid</strong></a> – A library for generating short, unique IDs (like <code>NxWDZ-j95C</code>).</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Our example backend will be a multi-tenant “bookmark aggregator.” Users will be able to bookmark URLs and share them with their team. Let’s get started by setting up the database.</p>\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  Setting up the Database with dbmate\n</h2>\n\n<p>No matter what language or framework you are using, you’ll need something to manage your database schema. <code>dbmate</code> offers a simple approach - write migrations directly in SQL ⇒ use a CLI to apply or revert migrations.</p>\n\n<p>After installing <code>dbmate</code>, we can create our initial migration:<br>\n</p>\n\n<div class=\"highlight js-code-highlight\">\n<pre class=\"highlight shell\"><code>dbmate new create_bookmarks_table\n</code></pre>\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>You’ll see a file like <code>20250101235959_create_bookmarks_table.sql</code> in a <code>migrations</code> folder. Let’s define our <code>bookmarks</code> table:<br>\n</p>\n\n<div class=\"highlight js-code-highlight\">\n<pre class=\"highlight sql\"><code><span class=\"c1\">-- migrate:up</span>\n<span class=\"k\">CREATE</span> <span class=\"k\">TABLE</span> <span class=\"n\">bookmarks</span> <span class=\"p\">(</span>\n  <span class=\"n\">bookmark_id</span> <span class=\"nb\">TEXT</span> <span class=\"k\">NOT</span> <span class=\"k\">NULL</span> <span class=\"k\">PRIMARY</span> <span class=\"k\">KEY</span><span class=\"p\">,</span>\n  <span class=\"n\">link</span> <span class=\"nb\">TEXT</span> <span class=\"k\">NOT</span> <span class=\"k\">NULL</span>\n<span class=\"p\">);</span>\n\n<span class=\"c1\">-- migrate:down</span>\n<span class=\"k\">DROP</span> <span class=\"k\">TABLE</span> <span class=\"n\">bookmarks</span><span class=\"p\">;</span>\n</code></pre>\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>This allows us to define both the migration and how to revert it. Before we can run the migration, we’ll need to tell dbmate where our DB lives.

using FastAPI, dbmate, PugSQL, PropelAuth, and nanoid. In just a few steps, you can handle database migrations, secure your routes by organization membership and roles, and keep your SQL clean and maintainable. FastAPI’s built-in support for Pydantic means you’ll never wrestle with request validation or data integrity concerns again.</p>\n\n<p>From here, the sky’s the limit. Maybe add tagging for bookmarks, or store user analytics. The best part is how easily you can extend all of this.

What remain are the time-zone differences and the language barrier. In order to make it easier for you to find events that match those constraints I started to collect the <a href=\"https://events.code-maven.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">online events</a> where you can filter by topic and time. Above I took the events and included the starting time in a few selected time-zones. I hope it makes it easier to find an event that is relevant to you. The data and the code generating the pages are all on <a href=\"https://github.com/szabgab/events/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">GitHub</a>.

So far, only one major piece of our software relies on reading barcodes in documents and images. Since Cache did not have a means of reading barcodes in the past, we have always achieved our goals by using a Visual Basic 6 application. However, it is no longer an ideal solution because it is currently complicated to maintain it. IRIS also lacks this capability, but it has recently got an option that makes up for it: embedded Python!</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>\n\n<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>To be able to read barcodes, we must install a couple of packages. We will need the pyzbar and the cv2 module for Python, so we should install the pyzbar and opencv-python packages. If we were utilizing a typical Python installation, we would require the following:</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>\n\n<pre><code>py -m pip install opencv-python pyzbar</code></pre>\n\n<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>However, to get packages installed correctly for embedded Python, we should take a different approach for a few reasons. First, embedded Python will look for packages in the /mgr/python directory of the IRIS installation. We could make the installation process target that folder by using the --target option for pip. Yet, as I learned the hard way, it can cause another problem. I had Python 3.13 installed on my machine, but the embedded Python on my version of IRIS is Python 3.9. As a result, when I ran pip, it would install packages for the wrong version of Python! To make sure we are going to get the correct and compatible version of those packages, we will utilize the irispython command found in the bin directory of our IRIS installation. Note that my IRIS instance is named “NEWIRIS”, so you will have to modify the path according to your needs.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>\n\n<pre><code>cd C:\\InterSystems\\NEWIRIS\\bin\nirispython -m pip install --target C:\\InterSystems\\NEWIRIS\\mgr\\python opencv-python pyzbar</code></pre>\n\n<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>The abovementioned line will install the required packages and their prerequisites. As a side note, one of those prerequisites is Numpy, a package with which I ran into compatibility errors when I used the wrong pip command for installation! As a result, the version meant for Python 3.13 was installed instead of the one compatible with Python 3.9.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>\n\n<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>We will also need to bridge the gap between ObjectScript and Python. One simple way to do that is to write Python methods that return JSON, and then use the JSON in ObjectScript. We will be required to utilize the JSON package to do that. However, since it is a default Python package, we will not have to take extra steps to install it.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>\n\n<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>If you wish to verify that the packages are installed correctly and will be functional in embedded Python, you can use an easy solution provided by the Python shell. To do that, we should open a terminal, invoke the Python shell, and attempt to import all the packages to check for errors.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>\n\n<pre><code><span class=\"hljs-keyword\">Do</span> <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">##class</span>(<span class=\"hljs-built_in\">%SYS.Python</span>).Shell()\nImport cv2\nImport pyzbar\nImport json</code></pre>\n\n<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>If all of those commands work without errors, we are ready to go!</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>\n\n<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>Next, we will create a new class which I will name User.PyBarScan and write a class method that uses embedded Python. Our class method will take a file path as an argument and return information about the barcodes it finds as a JSON array. We will need to import the packages that we have just installed (or at least parts of them), and we have a couple of options for how to do it. One of them is to include an XData block in our class definition. If we choose this option, we must name the XData block %import, and its MimeType should be application/python. We can place our import statements there. We might define this as follows (note that we only need the decode function from pyzbar, so we have imported </span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span>only</span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span> that part, not the whole package):</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>\n\n<pre><code>XData <span class=\"hljs-built_in\">%import</span> [ MimeType = application/python ]{\n    import cv2\n    from pyzbar.pyzbar import decode\n    import json\n}</code></pre>\n\n<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>The other option is to include the import statements in the method itself making them usable only in that method.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>\n\n<pre><code>ClassMethod Scan(path As %String) [ Language = python ]\n{\n        <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">import</span> cv2\n        <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">from</span> pyzbar.pyzbar <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">import</span> decode\n        <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">import</span> json\n}</code></pre>\n\n<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>Either option will work equally well, but each has advantages and disadvantages. The XData block will make the imported packages available to every method in the class, meaning that you will not need to import them again for each method. It will also keep all of the import statements together in one place which you may consider beneficial from a code management perspective. On the other hand, if you have a class that has a lot of methods but only some of them use the imports, every instance of the class will still import those items every single time.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>\n\n<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>We can easily see which packages are needed in each method if we import statements into the methods. If we delete the last method in the class that uses a particular package, it will no longer get imported since that method will not be called. The downside to this approach is the need to remember to do our imports into every method. Additionally, if we ever want to replace an imported package, we should do it in multiple places throughout the class.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>\n\n<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>We can also blend both approaches if we wish. First, we could import packages that will be used by several methods in the XData block. Then, we could import a certain package in a specific method that will utilize it for a reason that no other ones will. It will also do the job.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>\n\n<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>For my purposes today, I will include the import statements in my method simply because that will keep everything together in one place and help me make a neater code snippet to show you.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>\n\n<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>Be aware that in this method you will see some things that work similarly to the way the %DyanmicObject and %DynamicArray classes in ObjectScript would work with JSON. However, they are not quite the same. The curly brackets represent an object known as a Dictionary in Python. It will look like our good friend %DynamicObject in many ways. Likewise, the square brackets will describe a list in Python that will resemble a %DynamicArray. Yet, if we try to return either of those objects directly, we will get a %SYS.Python object handle. Also, the data therein will utilize values and keys surrounded by single quotes instead of double ones, and null values will be handled a bit differently compared to JSON as well. Since it is not valid JSON, we can not construct our dynamic object and arrays from it in ObjectScript. This is why we should use the json.dumps method from the JSON package. It ensures that the null values are handled correctly, and the JSON is in the right format. Below you can find a full text of the method we will employ:</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>\n\n<pre><code>ClassMethod Scan(path As %String) [ Language = python ]\n{\n        <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">import</span> cv2\n        <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">from</span> pyzbar.pyzbar <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">import</span> decode\n        <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">import</span> json\n        image = cv2.imread(path)\n        gray = cv2.cvtColor(image, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)\n        barcodes = decode(gray)\n        code_data = []\n        <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">for</span> barcode <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">in</span> barcodes:\n            barcode_data = barcode.data.decode(<span class=\"hljs-string\">\"utf-8\"</span>)\n            barcode_type = barcode.type\n            print(<span class=\"hljs-string\">\"Barcode Data: \"</span>, barcode_data)\n            print(<span class=\"hljs-string\">\"Barcode Type: \"</span>, barcode_type)\n            (x,y,w,h) = barcode.rect\n            thiscode = {}\n            thiscode.update({<span class=\"hljs-string\">\"data\"</span>:barcode_data})\n            thiscode.update({<span class=\"hljs-string\">\"type\"</span>:barcode_type})\n            thiscode.update({<span class=\"hljs-string\">\"x\"</span>:x})\n            thiscode.update({<span class=\"hljs-string\">\"y\"</span>:y})\n            thiscode.update({<span class=\"hljs-string\">\"w\"</span>:w})\n            thiscode.update({<span class=\"hljs-string\">\"h\"</span>:h})\n            code_data.append(thiscode)\n        <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">return</span> json.dumps(code_data)\n}</code></pre>\n\n<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>You can see our imports at the top (we have already discussed it). Our next step is to use cv2 to read the file specified by the path we have passed to the method. Then we must convert the image to a grayscale image making barcode recognition work slightly better. We will later employ the decode method we imported from pyzbar.pyzbar. After that, we will set the code_data variable to an empty list. Finally, we will start a for loop. If we had a list of objects in ObjectScript, our for loop may look as the following:</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>\n\n<pre><code><span class=\"hljs-keyword\">For</span> i=<span class=\"hljs-number\">1</span>:<span class=\"hljs-number\">1</span>:<span class=\"hljs-built_in\">$LISTLENGTH</span>(barcodes){\n    <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">set</span> barcode = <span class=\"hljs-built_in\">$LISTGET</span>(barcodes,i)\n    <span class=\"hljs-comment\">//do the things here</span>\n}</code></pre>\n\n<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>In Python, “for barcode in barcodes” means to iterate through the list using the variable name “barcode” for the current element of the list. We should find the barcode type and data. In my usage case, we operate Code218 barcodes. However, the same method works just as easily with UPCs or even QR codes. First, we write them out. Next, we get the bounding rectangle of the barcode. It includes the x and y coordinates of the top right corner, the width, and the height. There are a few other pieces of information available, but we will not need them today.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>\n\n<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>At this point, we start creating an empty dictionary object called thiscode. Then we use the dictionary’s update method to set some values there. The update method will create a new key/value pair if the key does not exist, or update it if it does exist. It will ensure that we do not have any duplicate keys in our final JSON. Our next step is to append this dictionary to the list, so we return the JSON using the json.dumps method to fix those potential formatting errors we mentioned above. At this point, we should have a familiar JSON object that is comfortable enough for our ObjectScript users to manipulate! For instance, in the terminal, I should be able to do the following now:</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>\n\n<pre><code><span class=\"hljs-meta\">USER&gt;</span><span class=\"bash\"><span>set</span> barcodes = <span>##class(User.PyBarScan).Scan(\"C:\\path\\to\\file\\barcodes.jpg\")</span></span>\nBarcode Data:  SHIPPER\nBarcode Type:  CODE128\nBarcode Data:  12345601\nBarcode Type:  CODE128\n<span class=\"hljs-meta\">USER&gt;</span><span class=\"bash\">w barcodes</span>\n[{\"data\": \"SHIPPER\", \"type\": \"CODE128\", \"x\": 8, \"y\": 157, \"w\": 280, \"h\": 75}, {\"data\": \"12345601\", \"type\": \"CODE128\", \"x\": 4, \"y\": 0, \"w\": 258, \"h\": 75}]\n<span class=\"hljs-meta\">USER&gt;</span><span class=\"bash\"><span>set</span> mybc = mybcarray.%Get(1)</span>\n<span class=\"hljs-meta\">USER&gt;</span><span class=\"bash\">w mybc.%Get(<span>\"type\"</span>),!,mybc.%Get(<span>\"data\"</span>)</span>\nCODE128\n12345601</code></pre>\n\n<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>This is just one of many great options embedded Python can offer us once we find and install the right libraries!</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>\n\n","contentLength":0,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Why I'm Building Stelvio","url":"https://dev.to/michal-stlv/why-im-building-stelvio-2cik","date":1739896468,"author":"Michal","guid":4278,"unread":true,"content":"<p>Before, I wrote about <a href=\"https://dev.to/michal-stlv/the-future-of-software-development-in-the-cloud-17np\">The future of software development in the cloud</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Today, I want to tell you why I'm building <a href=\"https://stelvio.dev\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Stelvio</a> and what problems it solves.</p>\n\n<p>I've been writing code for 20+ years, with the last decade mostly focused on Python and cloud. Past few years I've been deep in AWS, building and deploying cloud systems daily. </p>\n\n<p>Long enough to see what works, what doesn't, and where developers waste too much time.</p>\n\n<p>The drill is always the same: create a function, set up an API Gateway (resources, methods, integrations), add IAM permissions, set up environment variables and so on. <br>\nI've done it a hundred times—through the console, CLI, or using IaC (Infrastructure asCode).</p>\n\n<p><em>At some point last year it hit me.</em></p>\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  The Problem: Cloud is Too Complex\n</h2>\n\n<p>Why am I doing this again and again? Why do I write similar configs over and over?</p>\n\n<p>Why do I have to be an AWS expert to do this properly - making sure logs go where they should, permissions are tight but working, ports are closed etc.</p>\n\n<p>AWS is powerful but it's huge and complex so it's hard and <br>\ntedious to get everything right. </p>\n\n<p><em>Not because it's rocket science.</em> </p>\n\n<p>It just takes a lot of time to learn and configure everything correctly. </p>\n\n<p>The worst part is that most of it is distraction from your main job (implementing business logic). </p>\n\n<p>In the end the more you understand about underlying infrastructure the better. You should strive to learn and understand it but that doesn't mean you need to be expert before you start. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>It shouldn't be slow and tedious. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It's hard to be expert on everything - coding complex systems as well as managing infrastructure. One distracts from the other.</p>\n\n<p>Many teams need separate infra or DevOps people. While it's OK for big projects (where pace tends to be slower) it doesn't play nice with small and medium teams that need to move fast. They don't want to wait for infra guys to do their part so devs can finish theirs.</p>\n\n<p>You shouldn't need an infra expert on your team unless you’re working on a very big project. </p>\n\n<p><em>Developers should be able to handle everything themselves.</em></p>\n\n<p>Stelvio aims to give them tools to make this much easier, effective and safe.</p>\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  The Missing Piece: Current Solutions Aren't Enough\n</h2>\n\n<p>There are some existing solutions which allow you to create your infrastructure.</p>\n\n<p>One of the first was Cloud Formation - only for AWS. Then came cloud independent Terraform.</p>\n\n<p>These are good tools and they were revolutionary in the sense they let you define your infra as IaC. (If you consider YAML or JSON/HCL to be code :)). </p>\n\n<p>But these have two problems: </p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>They're not real code - it's more of a config </li>\n<li>They're infrastructure focused </li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Why are these problems? It depends who's looking at it. For infra people none of this is a problem. They think in infra terms, they're experts in infra and YAML/JSON/HCL is not a problem for them at all. </p>\n\n<p><em>But from a developer perspective it's far from ideal.</em></p>\n\n<p>Using YAML/JSON/HCL is not the same as using Python. It's easy to learn but switching from Python to this is pain. It's like using a digger to build your app and then using a shovel to build your infrastructure.</p>\n\n<p>Oh, and there is a lot of it! With Cloud Formation your templates can get to many thousands of lines pretty fast. With Terraform it's better but still far from ideal.</p>\n\n<p>I've been looking for tools to make this faster and simpler. </p>\n\n<p>There are tools that allow you to define your infra with actual programming language: <strong>AWS CDK</strong> and <strong>Pulumi</strong>. </p>\n\n<p>They're great, you can define your infra with Python (or TypeScript, Go, C#, Java).</p>\n\n<p>I'm using them daily but they still have problem #2 from above: </p>\n\n<p>They're focused on infrastructure rather than developers. They aim to do everything possible in the cloud, which makes them complex. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>You can use the language you want but you'll still write a lot of it.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>You'll still need to write a lot of repetitive boilerplate and configurations (IAM etc.). It is less tedious but still tedious.</p>\n\n<p>On the other end of the spectrum are simple deployment platforms and click-to-deploy solutions. They're super simple and cool - that's good - but they're limited (very narrow focused) and expensive (even 5x markup on top of AWS prices). </p>\n\n<p>For small-medium projects you might be willing to pay more if it makes you much more productive. But I know from experience that too limited without the options of extension doesn't work in real life.</p>\n\n<p>One more problem I see with these solutions is that they focus on UI instead of code (IaC).<br>\nThat means you lose all the good stuff - you can't track changes, can't reproduce builds easily, can't automate properly etc. </p>\n\n<p>Some of these platforms are moving towards a Framework Defined <br>\nInfrastructure (FDI) which is an interesting idea but here's the thing - real life is messy. You're often building solutions with different frameworks - so being stuck with one doesn't work.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Developers need better tools focused on DX (Developer Experience) and productivity.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>With the right tools, most projects shouldn't need dedicated infrastructure experts.</p>\n\n<p>I wanted something that would just work. Something that would let me write Python and deploy to AWS without thinking too much about AWS internals. </p>\n\n<p><em>Something that would handle boring and repetitive stuff on autopilot.</em></p>\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  The Solution: Developer-First Infrastructure\n</h2>\n\n<p><em>That's how Stelvio was born.</em></p>\n\n<h3>\n  \n  \n  Python first approach\n</h3>\n\n<p>Python devs should use only Python to define their infra. Think about it - switching between Python, YAML/JSON/HCL and AWS Console isn't just annoying. </p>\n\n<p><em>It breaks your flow.</em></p>\n\n<p>When I started building Stelvio, it was clear to me it must be Python only. </p>\n\n<p>With Stelvio, you stay in Python. Not because you can't learn other tools, but because it's faster and more productive.</p>\n\n<h3>\n  \n  \n  Why IaC?\n</h3>\n\n<p>When everything is code, we get many benefits:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Version control and history - we can track, review (in Pull Request), and reverse every infra change</li>\n<li>Reproducibility - dev, staging and prod environments stay consistent because they're built from the same code</li>\n<li>Testing &amp; validation - we can test our infrastructure before deployment. We can catch misconfigurations and security issues through automated scans</li>\n<li>Automation &amp; reuse - we can package common patterns into reusable components. CI/CD will handle deployment. No more console clicking</li>\n<li>Documentation as Code: Our infrastructure is self-documenting. Devs can read and understand how things work instead of relying on external (out of date) docs</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Our infrastructure becomes as good as our application code.</p>\n\n<h3>\n  \n  \n  Right level of abstraction - from top to bottom\n</h3>\n\n<p>Once we have infrastructure defined in Python, the next trick is in the right level of abstraction and control.</p>\n\n<p>Infrastructure based tools focus on basic components of the cloud - core underlying constructs. You have to configure everything. UI based platforms focus on high level abstraction. It works - until you need to configure some details or do things your way.</p>\n\n<p>The best way is to have a high-level abstractions with smart defaults that can be easily used with only a few lines of code. Yet every detail should be configurable - but only when needed. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Complexity should be visible, but only when it's necessary. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Stelvio aims to be a tool that will allow dev teams to ship your app without infra experts. It will make devs capable of developing, deploying and monitoring your infrastructure whether it's dev or production.</p>\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  The Vision: Beyond Just Another Tool\n</h2>\n\n<p>My vision is to have a tool that will automate boring repetitive stuff and provide high-level but customizable constructs. </p>\n\n<p>But it doesn't stop there. </p>\n\n<p>I want to change how we work with infrastructure.</p>\n\n<p>There is a whole world of things that are missing. We need a better developer experience. Not only when defining our infrastructure but also when using it, whether in development or production. </p>\n\n<p>Below are some of the things I have on my list:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>easy way to create, manage and clone whole environments</li>\n<li>better &amp; automated deployments</li>\n<li>better, easier and faster logs viewing</li>\n<li>monitoring</li>\n<li>cost understanding, analysis and prediction</li>\n<li>security checks</li>\n<li>architecture overview</li>\n<li>backups management</li>\n<li>easy way to run tests in the cloud</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>and many others. </p>\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  The Time is Right\n</h2>\n\n<p>Why now? First, because I got frustrated with this. </p>\n\n<p>But also time is right because Python has become one of the most <br>\nused languages in the world and it keeps growing. Even if we disregard its use for AI/ML it's still one of the most used languages with heavy use in the cloud.</p>\n\n<p>Also cloud platforms are now very mature and it's not a new cool tool for startups. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Pydantic and Astral showed that there is a demand for better developer tools which makes them more productive and helps produce <br>\nbetter software.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Stelvio aims to offer such tool for Python cloud developers.</p>\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  Join the Journey\n</h2>\n\n<p>Soon, I'll release the first developer preview of Stelvio as an open source project <br>\non GitHub.</p>\n\n<p>If you're interested in Stelvio:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://x.com/michal_stlv\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Follow on X</a></li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"https://github.com/michal-stlv/stelvio\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Star on GitHub</a> </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Let's make cloud development better for Python developers, together. </p>\n\n<p>I can't wait - it's going to be a great ride!</p>\n\n","contentLength":0,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Javascript => Python","url":"https://dev.to/christopher_jimenez_42e47/javascript-python-42pc","date":1739896013,"author":"Christopher Jimenez","guid":4277,"unread":true,"content":"<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>\n\n<p>In JavaScript, developers often rely on various array methods to perform operations efficiently.

Joining Elements with .join() (JavaScript) vs. join() Method (Python)<br>\n*<br>\nJavaScript<br>\n The .join() method concatenates array elements into a string.<br>\n</p>\n\n<div class=\"highlight js-code-highlight\">\n<pre class=\"highlight plaintext\"><code>const words = ['Hello', 'World'];\nconst sentence = words.join(' ');\nconsole.log(sentence);  // Logs \"Hello World\"\n</code></pre>\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>Python<br>\n Python’s join() string method achieves the same.<br>\n</p>\n\n<div class=\"highlight js-code-highlight\">\n<pre class=\"highlight plaintext\"><code>words = ['Hello', 'World']\nsentence = ' '.join(words)\nprint(sentence)  # Prints \"Hello World\"\n</code></pre>\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Summary Table</strong></p>\n\n<div class=\"table-wrapper-paragraph\"><table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>JavaScript Method</th>\n<th>Python Equivalent</th>\n<th>Description</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>.at()</td>\n<td>[] with negative index</td>\n<td>Access element by index</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>.concat()</td>\n<td>+</td>\n<td>Combine arrays into a new list</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>.every()</td>\n<td>all()</td>\n<td>Check if all elements pass a condition</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>.fill()</td>\n<td>Slice assignment</td>\n<td>Replace list elements in a range</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>.filter()</td>\n<td>List comprehension</td>\n<td>Create a new list with filtered elements</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>.forEach()</td>\n<td>for loop</td>\n<td>Iterate over elements</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>.includes()</td>\n<td>in keyword</td>\n<td>Check if an element exists</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>.join()</td>\n<td>join() method</td>\n<td>Combine elements into a string</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table></div>\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Key Takeaways</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>Concept Over Syntax</strong> – While JavaScript and Python use different syntax, many array and list operations share the same fundamental concepts. Learning the equivalent method helps with the transition.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Built-in Methods vs. Operators</strong> – JavaScript often provides built-in methods for common tasks (e.g., .concat()), whereas Python sometimes relies on operators (+) or different approaches like list comprehensions.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n\n<p>Transitioning between JavaScript and Python becomes seamless with practice. Keep exploring—both languages offer powerful tools for working with data!</p>\n\n","contentLength":0,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"[Boost]","url":"https://dev.to/arindam_1729/-3gob","date":1739888735,"author":"Arindam Majumder","guid":4215,"unread":true,"content":"<div class=\"ltag__link\">\n  <a href=\"/arindam_1729\" class=\"ltag__link__link\">\n    <div class=\"ltag__link__pic\">\n      <img src=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fuser%2Fprofile_image%2F965723%2Fe0982512-4de1-4154-b3c3-1869d19e9ecc.png\" alt=\"arindam_1729\">\n    </div>\n  </a>\n  <a href=\"https://dev.to/arindam_1729/11-exciting-github-repositories-you-should-check-right-now-37cg\" class=\"ltag__link__link\">\n    <div class=\"ltag__link__content\">\n      <h2>🤯 11 Exciting GitHub Repositories You Should Check Right Now⚡️</h2>\n      <h3>Arindam Majumder  ・ Feb 13</h3>\n      <div class=\"ltag__link__taglist\">\n        <span class=\"ltag__link__tag\">#opensource</span>\n        <span class=\"ltag__link__tag\">#javascript</span>\n        <span class=\"ltag__link__tag\">#webdev</span>\n        <span class=\"ltag__link__tag\">#python</span>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n  </a>\n</div>\n\n\n","contentLength":0,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"How to write a DRY combined sync / async Python package","url":"https://dev.to/spwoodcock/how-to-write-a-dry-combined-sync-async-python-package-4kj8","date":1739887986,"author":"Sam","guid":4214,"unread":true,"content":"<h2>\n  \n  \n  Async Python\n</h2>\n\n<p>Directly from the Python docs:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>asyncio is a library to write concurrent code using the async/await syntax.</p>\n\n<p>asyncio is used as a foundation for multiple Python asynchronous frameworks that provide high-performance network and web-servers, database connection libraries, distributed task queues, etc.</p>\n\n<p>asyncio is often a perfect fit for IO-bound and high-level structured network code.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>A typical use case for asynchronous code is web servers based on the ASGI-spec, such as FastAPI, LiteStar, etc.</p>\n\n<p>However, sync and async code do not play nicely together.</p>\n\n<p>Often, we need an async library, but there isn't one available, or vice versa.</p>\n\n<p>This article will discuss a simple pattern for <strong>writing Python packages compatible with both Synchronous and Asynchronous code</strong>, while only having to write the functionality once! (no separate libraries)</p>\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  Combining Sync and Async Code\n</h2>\n\n<p>First I will briefly describe the issues with mixing these two paradigms.</p>\n\n<h3>\n  \n  \n  How Async Works\n</h3>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Each Python interpreter runs in a <strong>process</strong> on the system.</li>\n<li>Each Python process has an <strong>event loop</strong> that can run async code.</li>\n<li>An event loop can run multiple pieces of code (<strong>coroutines</strong>) <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concurrency_(computer_science)\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">concurrently</a>, awaiting the return of something while another piece of code is executing.</li>\n<li>This has huge benefits for IO-bound tasks, such as downloading multiple files or sending simultaneous database queries.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>\n  \n  \n  Sync From Async\n</h3>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Doing this will typically block the event loop for executing other async code.</li>\n<li>This means that when you hit a piece of synchronous code, you essentially block everything below it from running until it completes, negating most of the benefits of async.</li>\n<li>It also means that if async tasks were started prior to the sync code running, the execution of these tasks will not proceed until the sync code  allows the event loop to run again. This problem is compounded by CPU-heavy tasks, which do not yield control back to the event loop.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>\n  \n  \n  Async From Sync\n</h3>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Synchronous code cannot use the <code>async</code>/<code>await</code> keywords, hence async code cannot be executed in it's normal manner.</li>\n<li>To get around this, async code can be run in a newly spawned event loop (<code>asyncio.run()</code> or <code>loop.run_until_complete()</code>), a separate thread (<code>ThreadpoolExecutor</code>) or process (<code>ProcessPoolExecutor</code>).</li>\n<li>Doing this significantly complicates codes (possibly introducing threading issues, multiple loops, and unexpected blocking), while providing none of the benefits of having async code in the first place.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  How To Write A Package That Is Both Sync / Async\n</h2>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Always write async first!</li>\n<li>It's much easier to remove the async specific tokens from code using a tokeniser script.</li>\n<li>Once we have our asynchronous implementation, we can use a script to convert it into a synchronous equivalent.</li>\n<li>This way you can release a package with both implementations available to your users: use the correct implementation for your use case.</li>\n<li>There is a nice package called <a href=\"https://github.com/python-trio/unasync\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">unasync</a> that can do this for you, but the simplest and cleanest implementation I have found was in the <a href=\"https://github.com/encode/httpcore/blob/master/scripts/unasync.py\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>encode/httpcore</strong> package</a>:\n</li>\n</ul>\n\n<div class=\"highlight

href=\"https://github.com/encode\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">encode</a> for the implementation.</p>\n\n<p>Without digging into the code too deeply, it should be quite obvious from the <code>SUBS</code> param what this script does - converting async syntax to sync syntax.</p>\n\n<h3>\n  \n  \n  Integrating Unasync.py\n</h3>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Add the above <code>unasync.py</code> code to your repo.</li>\n<li>Place your async code in a <code>_async</code> directory.</li>\n<li>Modify the <code>SUBS</code> param and <code>unasync_dir</code> usage in <code>main()</code> to match your project structure.</li>\n<li>Run the script to generate the sync code equivalent in the <code>_sync</code> directory.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>I followed this exact approach in a recent project I worked on with a volunteer at HOTOSM (<a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/emir-fabio-cognigni-4222a1216\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Emir</a>, an excellent dev!).</p>\n\n<p>We were looking at a nice approach for making the package available for both sync and async (FastAPI) use cases, and the solution was surprisingly simple, but poorly documented online!</p>\n\n<p>The full project an implementation can be viewed <a href=\"https://github.com/hotosm/pg-nearest-city\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">here</a></p>\n\n<h3>\n  \n  \n  Optional: Use Via Pre-Commit Hook\n</h3>\n\n<ul>\n<li>In the linked project above, I set a pre-commit hook to trigger the <code>unasync.py</code> script on each commit.</li>\n<li>This means the synchronous code never gets out of sync (ha!) with the asynchronous code.</li>\n<li>The config for the hook was:\n</li>\n</ul>\n\n<div class=\"highlight js-code-highlight\">\n<pre class=\"highlight yaml\"><code><span class=\"na\">repos</span><span

It’s represented as a string that contains five groups of 32 hexadecimal digits separated by hyphens. Here is an example:<br>\n</p>\n\n<div class=\"highlight js-code-highlight\">\n<pre class=\"highlight plaintext\"><code>f6a7f195-8220-408c-9906-7395b870db61\n</code></pre>\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  Why it’s so useful?\n</h2>\n\n<p>The question arises as to why <code>UUID</code> is better than the typical sequential integer Primary Key (PK) generated by the database, which seems to be handled efficiently.<br>\nWe have been using integer IDs for many years, as this is what databases and Django does by default. We decided to move to UUID for a few reasons.</p>\n\n<p>Firstly, <code>UUIDs</code> are unpredictable, unlike standard integer IDs. This lack of predictability enhances security.</p>\n\n<p>Secondly, consider a system usable both online and offline, where users can create new content. When the user reconnects to the internet, the new instances are merged into the database. With conventional auto-incrementing primary keys, there's a significant chance of conflicts. However, by employing UUIDs as primary keys, the likelihood of encountering such conflicts is nearly eliminated, providing a robust solution to potential problems.</p>\n\n<p>Aside from that UUIDs are less prone to human error when writing queries and working with code, it's hard to spot that a wrong field has been used in a JOIN statement and using integer IDs is less likely to cause an error in cases like that. With UUIDs it's less likely.</p>\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  How to migrate my data from ID to UUID while ensuring both the wolves are satisfied and the sheep remain unharmed\n</h2>\n\n<p>So, what should you do if you decide that UUIDs are necessary and want to migrate your database objects to use UUIDs as primary keys? If you’re in the early stages, without a production environment, the transition is relatively straightforward. However, if your system is already in production, hosting millions of objects with complex relationships, you’ll need to carefully consider this decision. The process can be challenging and require significant effort. But don’t worry, I’ll guide you through it to make it as smooth as possible. 🙂</p>\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  Happy scenario\n</h2>\n\n<p>To illustrate the problem, imagine we have the following <code>Order</code> model, which represents an order placed by a customer in an online store.<br>\n</p>\n\n<div class=\"highlight js-code-highlight\">\n<pre class=\"highlight python\"><code><span class=\"k\">class</span> <span class=\"nc\">Order</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">models</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"n\">Model</span><span class=\"p\">):</span>\n    <span class=\"nb\">id</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"n\">models</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nc\">PositiveIntegerField</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">unique</span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"bp\">True</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n    <span class=\"n\">created_at</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"n\">models</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nc\">DateTimeField</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">auto_now_add</span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"bp\">True</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n    <span class=\"n\">total_price</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"n\">models</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nc\">DecimalField</span><span class=\"p\">(</span>\n        <span class=\"n\">max_digits</span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"mi\">10</span><span class=\"p\">,</span>\n        <span class=\"n\">decimal_places</span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"mi\">2</span><span class=\"p\">,</span>\n    <span class=\"p\">)</span>\n    <span class=\"n\">currency</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"n\">models</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nc\">CharField</span><span class=\"p\">(</span>\n        <span class=\"n\">max_length</span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"mi\">3</span><span class=\"p\">,</span>\n    <span class=\"p\">)</span>\n\n</code></pre>\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>The most straightforward solution, that probably came to your mind, is to add a new <code>UUID</code> field that will be the new primary key (PK).  Let’s name it <code>token</code>. Populate it with unique values and make this field the new PK. Let's illustrate this process using the <code>Order</code> model as an example.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> All examples in this article are for illustration purposes; production systems will

following error:</p>\n\n<p><code>django.db.utils.InternalError: cannot drop constraint order_ordereditem_pkey on table order_order because other objects depend on it</code>. </p>\n\n<p>Why is that?</p>\n\n<p>The reason is that your related models will still have primary key columns pointing to the obsolete <code>pk</code> values, which will no longer exist. If things seem a bit foggy, no worries! Check out the next section that explains in detail how relationships are established in the database.</p>\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  How the relations are defined in your database?\n</h2>\n\n<p>Before we go on let me explain how the relations that you define in ORM are implemented in the database. If it’s clear to you, you can skip this section and go directly to <code>So what is the problem?</code></p>\n\n<p>The relational database consists of tables with columns and constraints that specify the rules for the data in tables. All limitations are ensured by the constraints, like uniqueness, value requirement, primary keys, and relations.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Many-to-one</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>In the <strong>many-to-one</strong> relation, we have two models where the entity of <code>model A</code> can have multiple associations with entities of <code>model B</code>, but the entity of <code>model B</code> can have only one association with the entity of <code>model A</code>.</p>\n\n<p>In the Django framework, it’s defined with the use of <code>ForeignKey</code> in <code>model B</code>, which points the <code>model A</code>. Under the hood, the new column is added to the <code>model B</code>, and the foreign key constraint is created. The column name is the field name with <code>_id</code> ending and will keep the <code>id</code>s of associated entities. The foreign key constraint is just the rule of the database table (<code>model A</code>) that says the values in a given column must match the values (in our case the <code>id</code>) of a column in some other table (<code>model A</code>). The referenced column (in our case <code>is</code> on <code>mode a</code>)  must contain only unique values. So the foreign key constraint depends on the unique or primary key constraint from the relational table.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fhlqjgce6n6jvlfyney79.png\" class=\"article-body-image-wrapper\"><img src=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fhlqjgce6n6jvlfyney79.png\" alt=\"Many-to-one class model illustration\" width=\"800\" height=\"380\"></a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2F3qc67szi570spyski367.png\" class=\"article-body-image-wrapper\"><img src=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2F3qc67szi570spyski367.png\" alt=\"Many-to-one DB tables illustration\" width=\"800\" height=\"127\"></a></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>One-to-one</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>In <strong>one-to-one</strong> relationship, the entity of <code>model A</code> can have only one association with entities of <code>model B</code>, and the same rule applies to <code>model A</code> in relation to <code>model B</code>.

In Django framework, it’s defined with the use of the <code>ManyToMany</code> field on any model. Under the hood, this case is a little bit more complex than the previous ones. As we can have multiple connections from both sides of the relationship, we cannot just create a new column on one of the tables. Instead, a new table is created that keeps the ids from both sides of relations. The new table contains columns, one for each site of relations, that keep the corresponding entity field value. To ensure references, for each field the foreign key constraint is created. Additionally, a unique constraint is added to ensure that there is only one row responsible for the relationship between every two instances.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fn1imfnk8sxbeqxa5msn7.png\" class=\"article-body-image-wrapper\"><img src=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fn1imfnk8sxbeqxa5msn7.png\" alt=\"Many-to-many class model illustration\" width=\"800\" height=\"258\"></a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fx6a0z1qpnymx6l90e9ve.png\" class=\"article-body-image-wrapper\"><img src=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fx6a0z1qpnymx6l90e9ve.png\" alt=\"Many-to-many DB tables illustration\" width=\"800\" height=\"266\"></a></p>\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  So what is the problem?\n</h2>\n\n<p>As we learned in the previous section, relationships based on foreign key constraints utilize a primary key or unique constraint. Modifying the model's <code>pk</code> to <code>UUID</code> involves recreating the primary key, which deletes the old constraint and creates a new one. If you try to change the primary key, you might encounter errors such as:</p>\n\n<p><code>django.db.utils.InternalError: cannot drop constraint order_ordereditem_pkey on table order_order because other objects depend on it</code>. </p>\n\n<p>This error implies that the primary key constraint of the <code>id</code> field, which defines <code>foreign key</code> relations, cannot be dropped.</p>\n\n<p>That's why we had to update the relations before modifying the <code>pk</code>.</p>\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  The solution in a nutshell\n</h2>\n\n<p>To solve the issue, we will introduce a new field called <code>old_id</code> to keep a copy of the old <code>Order</code> <code>id</code>. Then, we will redirect our existing relationships to this new field, and create another field on related models to store the new <code>UUID</code> values (that will become the <code>pk</code> values) of related instances. After changing the <code>ID</code> to <code>UUID</code> in our target model, on the related models, we'll transform the fields that store related instances' <code>UUID</code> values into relational fields, and remove the old relational fields pointing to <code>old_id</code>s. This way, we’ll maintain the same relationships, but with pointing to new <code>UUID</code> values. Sounds complicated? Let’s explore the whole process in the example to make it clear.</p>\n\n<p>💡 Solution Shortcut</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>On the target model (e.g. <code>Order</code>) create the new fields, one the UUID field (e.g. <code>token</code> field) that will become a PK, and one for keeping the old ID (e.g. <code>old_id</code> field)</li>\n<li>Populate those fields</li>\n<li>Redirect each existing relation to the field with the old id (<code>old_id</code> field)</li>\n<li>On each relation model create a new field that will keep the new UUID values of the related instances (e.g. <code>order_token</code>)</li>\n<li>Change the <code>UUID</code> field into the primary key.</li>\n<li>On each relation model, change the field that keeps new UUID values (<code>order_token</code>) into the relation field (e.g.<code>ForeginKey</code>)</li>\n<li>On each relation model, remove the old relation field</li>\n<li>On each relation model, rename the new relation field to the initial name</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  Preparation\n</h2>\n\n<p>Before delving into managing relationships, let's add an <code>old_id</code> field to store a copy of the previous integer primary key. We also need a <code>token</code> field, which will later serve as our new primary key.

relations? </p>\n\n<p>We need to handle all relations:  <code>many to one</code>, <code>many to many</code> and <code>one to one</code>. In all cases, we can split the changes into two parts: before model <code>id</code> migration to <code>UUID</code>, and after.</p>\n\n<p>Now, let's examine each step for each relation type in detail.</p>\n\n<h3>\n  \n  \n  Few tips at the beginning:\n</h3>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Make sure that at each stage of the migration, you hold the identifier of the related objects that will allow to recreate the relationships.</li>\n<li>Always create a full backup and test the code before running the migrations. If something goes wrong, it might be challenging or even impossible to undo.</li>\n<li>Be patient. If the model you're migrating has numerous relations, preparing everything might take some time, but don’t give up it’s doable!</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>💡 Our goal in this data migration is to preserve the references between objects.</p>\n\n<h3>\n  \n  \n  Before <code>UUID</code> migration\n</h3>\n\n<p>This phase comprises two steps:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Redirect each existing relation to the <code>old_id</code> field.</li>\n<li>For each relation model, create and populate a new field (<code>order_token</code>) that will store the new <code>UUID</code> values of the related <code>order</code> instances.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Let’s see how to apply those steps to both <code>many-to-one</code>, <code>one-to-one</code>, and <code>many-to-many</code> relations.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Many-to-one and one-to-one relationship</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The <code>many-to-one</code> and <code>one-to-one</code> relations are similar. The only difference is that the <code>one-to-one</code> relation has an additional unique constraint. Therefore, the method for handling these relations is the same.<br>\nIn those cases, we need to prepare migrations on the model where the relation is defined. Let’s see the process on an example of <code>Invoice</code> that has <code>Many-to-one</code> relation with <code>Order</code> model:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>The first step is to define the <code>UUID</code> field that will hold the new <code>UUID</code> values of related objects. In the example below, we have the <code>Invoice</code> model that is related to <code>Order</code>. We're adding a new field, <code>order_token</code>, which will be filled with the new <code>token</code> value of the corresponding <code>Order</code> instances.<br>\n</p>\n\n<pre class=\"highlight python\"><code><span class=\"k\">class</span> <span class=\"nc\">Invoice</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">models</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"n\">Model</span><span class=\"p\">):</span>\n    <span class=\"n\">order</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"n\">models</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nc\">ForeignKey</span><span class=\"p\">(</span>\n        <span class=\"n\">Order</span><span class=\"p\">,</span>\n        <span class=\"n\">related_name</span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"sh\">\"</span><span class=\"s\">invoices</span><span class=\"sh\">\"</span><span class=\"p\">,</span>\n        <span class=\"n\">null</span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"bp\">True</span><span class=\"p\">,</span>\n        <span class=\"n\">blank</span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"bp\">True</span><span class=\"p\">,</span>\n        <span class=\"n\">on_delete</span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"n\">models</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"n\">SET_NULL</span><span class=\"p\">,</span>\n    <span class=\"p\">)</span>\n    <span class=\"n\">order_token</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"n\">models</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nc\">UUIDField</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">null</span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"bp\">True</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>The migration as follows:<br>\n</p>\n\n<pre class=\"highlight python\"><code><span class=\"kn\">from</span> <span class=\"n\">django.db</span> <span class=\"kn\">import</span> <span class=\"n\">migrations</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"n\">models</span>\n\n<span class=\"k\">class</span> <span class=\"nc\">Migration</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">migrations</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"n\">Migration</span><span class=\"p\">):</span>\n\n    <span class=\"n\">dependencies</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"p\">[</span>\n        <span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"sh\">\"</span><span class=\"s\">invoice</span><span class=\"sh\">\"</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"sh\">\"</span><span class=\"s\">0006_invoiceevent_app</span><span class=\"sh\">\"</span><span class=\"p\">),</span>\n    <span class=\"p\">]</span>\n\n    <span class=\"n\">operations</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"p\">[</span>\n        <span class=\"n\">migrations</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nc\">AddField</span><span class=\"p\">(</span>\n            <span class=\"n\">model_name</span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"sh\">\"</span><span class=\"s\">invoice</span><span class=\"sh\">\"</span><span class=\"p\">,</span>\n            <span class=\"n\">name</span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"sh\">\"</span><span class=\"s\">order_token</span><span class=\"sh\">\"</span><span class=\"p\">,</span>\n            <span class=\"n\">field</span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"n\">models</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nc\">UUIDField</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">null</span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"bp\">True</span><span class=\"p\">),</span>\n        <span class=\"p\">),</span>\n    <span class=\"p\">]</span>\n</code></pre>\n\n\n\n\n</li>\n\n<li>\n\n<p>The next step is to populate this new field with corresponding <code>token</code> values.

The quickest solution is to write a simple SQL operation:<br>\n</p>\n\n<pre class=\"highlight python\"><code><span class=\"kn\">from</span> <span class=\"n\">django.db</span> <span class=\"kn\">import</span> <span class=\"n\">migrations</span>\n\n<span class=\"k\">class</span> <span class=\"nc\">Migration</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">migrations</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"n\">Migration</span><span class=\"p\">):</span>\n\n    <span class=\"n\">dependencies</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"p\">[</span>\n        <span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"sh\">\"</span><span class=\"s\">invoice</span><span class=\"sh\">\"</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"sh\">\"</span><span class=\"s\">0007_invoice_order_token</span><span class=\"sh\">\"</span><span class=\"p\">),</span>\n                <span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"sh\">\"</span><span class=\"s\">order</span><span class=\"sh\">\"</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"sh\">\"</span><span class=\"s\">0137_fulfil_order_token_and_old_id</span><span class=\"sh\">\"</span><span class=\"p\">),</span>\n    <span class=\"p\">]</span>\n\n    <span class=\"n\">operations</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"p\">[</span>\n        <span class=\"n\">migrations</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nc\">RunSQL</span><span class=\"p\">(</span>\n            <span class=\"sh\">\"\"\"</span><span class=\"s\">\n            UPDATE invoice_invoice\n            SET order_token = (\n                SELECT token\n                FROM order_order\n                WHERE invoice_invoice.order_id = order_order.id\n            )\n            WHERE order_id IS NOT NULL;\n            </span><span class=\"sh\">\"\"\"</span><span class=\"p\">,</span>\n            <span class=\"n\">reverse_sql</span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"n\">migrations</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"n\">RunSQL</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"n\">noop</span><span class=\"p\">,</span>\n        <span class=\"p\">),</span>\n    <span class=\"p\">]</span>\n</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>So, what's going on here? We're updating the <code>order_token</code> column in the <code>invoice_invoice</code> table, which corresponds to the <code>Invoice</code> model. For all instances where the <code>Order</code> relation exists, we populate the new <code>order_token</code> field with the <code>token</code> value from the corresponding <code>Order</code> instance. This <code>token</code> value is sourced from the <code>order_order</code> table, where the <code>id</code> matches the <code>order_id</code> from <code>invoice_invoice</code> table.</p>\n\n<p>Also, note that the dependencies list is extended with the order migration. We need to ensure that this migration is applied after the migration that populates the new <code>token</code> field in the order model.</p>\n\n<p>💡 To write an SQL operation, it's essential to know the table and column names. In Django, the table name is formed by joining the app name and model name with an underscore. If you are unsure about your table name, you can always check it in your database shell.</p>\n\n\n</li>\n\n<li>\n\n<p>The final step is to change the current relation field to point to the <code>old_id</code> field. This action will drop the existing foreign key constraint that relies on the primary key constraint, and create a new one for the <code>old_id</code> field.

Also, reconsider the default ordering. If your default ordering uses <code>pk</code>, it will no longer work as before, since the instances won't be sorted in the creation order due to the random value of <code>UUID</code>. If you wish to maintain the order of instance creation, consider adding a creation date to your model, if one doesn't exist, and sort by this value.</p>\n\n<p>The field responsible for the creation date can be added in the same step where <code>token</code> and <code>old_id</code> are added. To preserve the old order, fill the instances with the current date and time, replacing the seconds with the old id value.</p>\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  Conclusion\n</h2>\n\n<p>As you can see, there are lots of steps to do, but I hope that this tutorial helps you go smoothly through this process with an understanding of each step. </p>\n\n<p>You can also check our <a href=\"https://github.com/saleor/saleor\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://github.com/saleor/saleor</a> repository for real-life examples.

In the project where I used this solution<br>\nElasticsearch or other \"external\" centralized log collection was not an option and I had to handle multiple outputs<br>\nlike console, file and for certain logs a database. In the project I was working on I had multiple processes running<br>\nso I had to find a way to write all the logs into file / database without any race condition.</p>\n\n<p>So my solution was this create a centralized logging server that would receive logs from multiple clients and handle <br>\nthem to run a separated server process that would handle the logs.</p>\n\n<p>The code is on GitHub, you can read it throuhg: <a href=\"https://github.com/kubenetic/centralized-logging\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://github.com/kubenetic/centralized-logging</a></p>\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  How Everything Works Together\n</h2>\n\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>The Server:</strong> It starts at startup and listens for incoming connections from clients. Parses the incoming data,\nconverts it to a log record and send through the appropriate log handlers.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>The Client:</strong> It sends log records to the server using a socket handler.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Handlers:</strong> I used in this PoC Pythons original logging handlers: StreamHandler and FileHandler to write logs out\nand the SocketHandler to send logs to the server.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  Why Use This Architecture?\n</h2>\n\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Scalability:</strong> The server can handle logs from multiple processes or systems, centralizing the log collection.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Flexibility:</strong> You can add custom handlers on the server (e.g., write logs to a database, send alerts, etc.).</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Decoupling:</strong> The client processes only need to send logs, without worrying about the details of log handling.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  logging.handlers.SocketHandler\n</h2>\n\n<p>The logging server is a standard TCP server that listens for incoming connections from clients. The clients send log data<br>\nwith the SocketHandler as I described above. It sends the data in binary format. The first 4 bytes contains the length of<br>\nthe log record, followed by the serialized log record.</p>\n<h3>\n  \n  \n  What is that <code>&gt;L</code> format in Python's struct module?\n</h3>\n\n<p>The &gt;L format in Python's struct module is a format specifier used for packing and unpacking binary data. It specifies <br>\nthe byte order, data type, and size of the data to be packed or unpacked. </p>\n<h4>\n  \n  \n  Breaking Down &gt;L\n</h4>\n\n<p>The character <strong>&gt;</strong> specifies the byte order (also called endianness).</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>'<strong>&gt;</strong>' means big-endian (most significant byte first).</li>\n<li>'<strong>&lt;</strong>' would mean little-endian (the least significant byte first).</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Big-endian and little-endian define how multibyte data is stored in memory. For example, the number 0x12345678 would <br>\nbe stored as:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Big-endian: 0x12 0x34 0x56 0x78</li>\n<li>Little-endian: 0x78 0x56 0x34 0x12</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>L</strong>: Specifies the data type that is an unsigned long integer (typically 4 bytes on most platforms).

Control Flow, and Loops","url":"https://dev.to/pydev/python-fundamentals-data-types-control-flow-and-loops-2mnk","date":1739876017,"author":"NK","guid":4086,"unread":true,"content":"<p>Before diving into advanced Python topics, it’s essential to have a solid understanding of basic data types, control flow, and loops. These fundamental building blocks are what make Python such a flexible and powerful language.</p>\n\n<p>In this post, we’ll cover:</p>\n\n<p>✅ Python's core data types and how they work<br>\n✅ Control flow statements like if-else, match-case, and try-except<br>\n✅ Loops in Python (for, while, and iterators)</p>\n\n<p>Let’s get started! 🚀</p>\n\n<p><strong>1️⃣ Python’s Built-in Data Types</strong></p>\n\n<p>Python provides several built-in data types, categorized as follows:</p>\n\n<div class=\"table-wrapper-paragraph\"><table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Category</th>\n<th>Data Type</th>\n<th>Example</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Numbers</td>\n<td>int, float, complex</td>\n<td>42, 3.14, 1+2j</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Text</td>\n<td>str</td>\n<td>\"Hello, Python!\"</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Boolean</td>\n<td>bool</td>\n<td>True, False</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Sequences</td>\n<td>list, tuple, range</td>\n<td>[1, 2, 3], (1, 2, 3), range(5)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Mapping</td>\n<td>dict</td>\n<td>{\"name\": \"Alice\", \"age\": 25}</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Sets</td>\n<td>set, frozenset</td>\n<td>{1, 2, 3}, frozenset({1, 2, 3})</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Binary</td>\n<td>bytes, bytearray, memoryview</td>\n<td>b'hello', bytearray(5), memoryview(bytes(5))</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>NoneType</td>\n<td>None</td>\n<td>None</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table></div>\n\n<p><strong>🔍 Examples of Basic Data Types in Python</strong></p>\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  Numbers\n</h2>\n\n\n<div class=\"highlight js-code-highlight\">\n<pre class=\"highlight python\"><code><span class=\"n\">x</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"mi\">10</span>

need to declare them explicitly.<br>\n✅ list and tuple are ordered, while set is unordered and unique.<br>\n✅ dict stores key-value pairs.</p>\n\n<p><strong>2️⃣ Control Flow: Making Decisions in Python</strong></p>\n\n<p>Python provides several control flow statements that help us direct program execution based on conditions.</p>\n\n<p><strong>🔹 1. if-elif-else Statements</strong></p>\n\n<p>Python executes blocks of code based on conditions.<br>\n</p>\n\n<div class=\"highlight js-code-highlight\">\n<pre class=\"highlight python\"><code><span

Our latest <a href=\"https://lp.jetbrains.com/python-developers-survey-2023/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Python Developer Survey Results</a> confirm that these three frameworks remain developers’ top choices for backend web development with Python.</p><p>All three frameworks are open-source and compatible with the latest versions of Python.&nbsp;</p><p>But how do you determine which web framework is best for your project? Here, we’ll look at the pros and cons of each and compare how they stack up against one another.</p><p>Django is a “batteries included”, full-stack web framework used by the likes of Instagram, Spotify, and Dropbox, to name but a few. Pitched as “the web framework for perfectionists with deadlines”, the <a href=\"https://blog.jetbrains.com/pycharm/2023/11/what-is-the-django-web-framework/\">Django framework</a> was designed to make it easier and quicker to build robust web apps.</p><p>First made available as an open-source project in 2005, Django is a mature project that remains in active development 20 years later. It’s suitable for many web applications, including social media, e-commerce, news, and entertainment sites.</p><p>Django follows a model-view-template (MVT) architecture, where each component has a specific role. Models are responsible for handling the data and defining its structure. The views manage the business logic, processing requests and fetching the necessary data from the models. Finally, templates present this data to the end user – similar to views in a model-view-controller (MVC) architecture.&nbsp;</p><p>As a full-stack web framework, Django can be used to build an entire web app (from database to HTML and JavaScript frontend).</p><p>Alternatively, you can use the <a href=\"https://blog.jetbrains.com/pycharm/2023/11/what-is-the-django-web-framework/\">Django REST Framework</a> to combine Django with a frontend framework (such as React) to build both mobile and browser-based apps.</p><p>Explore our comprehensive <a href=\"https://blog.jetbrains.com/pycharm/2024/01/how-to-learn-django/\">Django guide</a>, featuring an overview of prerequisite knowledge, a structured learning path, and additional resources to help you master the framework.&nbsp;</p><p>There are plenty of reasons why Django remains one of the most widely used Python web frameworks, including:</p><ul><li>: With a “batteries included” approach, Django offers built-in features like authentication, caching, data validation, and session management. Its <a href=\"https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/misc/design-philosophies/#don-t-repeat-yourself-dry\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">don’t repeat yourself (DRY)</a> principle speeds up development and reduces bugs.&nbsp;</li><li>: Django simplifies dependency management with its built-in features, reducing the need for external packages. This helps streamline the initial setup and minimizes compatibility issues, so you can get up and running sooner.&nbsp;</li><li>: Django’s ORM (object-relational mapping) makes data handling more straightforward, enabling you to work with databases like SQLite, MySQL, and PostgreSQL without needing SQL knowledge. However, it’s less suitable for non-relational databases like MongoDB.</li><li>: Built-in defenses against common vulnerabilities such as cross-site scripting (XSS), SQL injection, and clickjacking help quickly secure your app from the start.&nbsp;</li><li>: Despite being monolithic, Django allows for horizontal scaling of the application’s architecture (business logic and templates), caching to ease database load, and asynchronous processing to improve efficiency.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Community and documentation</strong>: Django has a vast, active community and detailed <a href=\"https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">documentation</a>, with tutorials and support readily available.&nbsp;</li></ul><p>Despite its many advantages, there are a few reasons you might want to look at options other than Django when developing your next web app.</p><ul><li>: Its “batteries included” design can be too much for smaller apps, where a lightweight framework like Flask may be more appropriate.&nbsp;</li><li>: Django’s extensive features naturally come with a steeper learning curve, though there are plenty of resources available to help new developers.</li><li>: Django is generally slower compared to other frameworks like Flask and FastAPI, but built-in caching and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lkkxTceQft8\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">asynchronous processing</a> can help improve the response times.</li></ul><p>Flask is a Python-based micro-framework for backend web development. However, don’t let the term “micro” deceive you. As we’ll see, Flask isn’t only limited to smaller web apps.&nbsp;</p><p>Instead, Flask is designed with a simple core based on <a href=\"https://palletsprojects.com/p/werkzeug/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Werkzeug WSGI</a> (Web Server Gateway Interface) and <a href=\"https://palletsprojects.com/p/jinja/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Jinja2 templates</a>. Well-known users of Flask include Netflix, Airbnb, and Reddit.</p><p>Flask was initially created as an April Fools’ Day joke and released as an open-source project in 2010, a few years after Django. The micro-framework’s approach is fundamentally different from Django’s. While Django takes a “batteries included” style and comes with a lot of the functionality you may need for building web apps, Flask is much leaner.</p><p>The philosophy behind the micro-framework is that everyone has their preferences, so developers should be free to choose their own components. For this reason, Flask doesn’t include a database, ORM (object-relational mapper), or ODM (object-document mapper).&nbsp;</p><p>When you build a web app with Flask, very little is decided for you upfront. This can have significant benefits, as we’ll discuss below.</p><p>Some reasons for choosing Flask as a backend web framework include:</p><ul><li>: Flask’s minimalist approach offers a flexible alternative to Django, making it ideal for smaller applications or projects where Django’s extensive features may feel excessive. However, Flask isn’t limited to small projects – you can extend it as needed.</li><li>: Flask allows you to choose the libraries and frameworks for core functionality, such as data handling and user authentication. This enables you to select the best tools for your project and extend it in unforeseen ways.&nbsp;</li><li>: Flask’s modular design makes it easy to scale horizontally. Using a NoSQL database layer can further enhance scalability.&nbsp;</li><li>: Its simple design makes Flask easy to learn, though you may need to explore extensions for more complex apps.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Community and documentation</strong>: Flask has extensive (if somewhat technical) <a href=\"https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/3.0.x/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">documentation</a> and a clear codebase. While its community is smaller than Django’s, Flask remains active and is growing steadily.&nbsp;</li></ul><p>While Flask has a lot to offer, there are a few things to consider before you decide to use it in your next web development project.</p><ul><li><strong>Bring your own everything:</strong> Flask’s micro-framework design and flexibility require you to handle much of that core functionality, including data validation, session management, and caching. While this flexibility can be beneficial, it can also slow the development process, as you’ll need to find existing libraries or build features from scratch. Additionally, dependencies must be managed over time to ensure they remain compatible with Flask.&nbsp;</li><li> Flask has minimal built-in security. Beyond securing client-side cookies, you must implement web security best practices and ensure the security of the dependencies you include, applying updates as needed.&nbsp;</li><li>: While Flask performs slightly better than Django, it lags behind FastAPI. Flask offers some <a href=\"https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/stable/deploying/asgi/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">ASGI support</a> (the standard used by FastAPI), but it is more tightly tied to WSGI.</li></ul><p>As the name suggests, FastAPI is a micro-framework for building high-performance web APIs with Python. Despite being relatively new – it was first released as an open-source project in 2018 ­– FastAPI has quickly become popular among developers, ranking third in our list of the most popular Python web frameworks since 2021.</p><p>FastAPI is based on <a href=\"https://www.uvicorn.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Uvicorn</a>, an ASGI (Asynchronous Server Gateway Interface) server, and <a href=\"https://www.starlette.io/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Starlette</a>, a web micro-framework. FastAPI adds data validation, serialization, and documentation to streamline building web APIs.</p><p>When developing FastAPI, the micro-framework’s creator drew on the experiences of working with many different frameworks and tools. Whereas Django was developed before frontend JavaScript web frameworks (such as React or Vue.js) were prominent, FastAPI was designed with this context in mind.&nbsp;</p><p>The emergence of <a href=\"https://www.openapis.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">OpenAPI</a> (formerly Swagger) as a format for structuring and documenting APIs in the preceding years provided an industry standard that FastAPI could leverage.</p><p>Beyond the implicit use case of creating RESTful APIs, FastAPI is ideal for applications that require real-time responses, such as messaging platforms and dashboards. Its high performance and asynchronous capabilities make it a good fit for data-intensive apps, including machine learning models, data processing, and analytics.</p><p>Since then, usage has increased to 20%, alongside a slight dip in the use of Flask and Django.&nbsp;</p><p>These are some of the reasons why developers are choosing FastAPI:</p><ul><li>: Designed for speed, FastAPI supports asynchronous processing and bi-directional web sockets (courtesy of Starlette). It outperformed both Django and Flask in benchmark tests, making it ideal for high-traffic applications.&nbsp;</li><li>: Like Flask, FastAPI is highly modular, making it easy to scale and ideal for containerized deployments.</li><li><strong>Adherence to industry standards</strong>: FastAPI is fully compatible with <a href=\"https://oauth.net/2/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">OAuth 2.0</a>, OpenAPI (formerly Swagger), and JSON Schema. As a result, you can implement secure authentication and generate your API documentation with minimal effort.</li><li>: FastAPI use of <a href=\"https://pydantic.dev/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Pydantic</a> for type hints and validation speeds up development by providing type checks, auto-completion, and request validation.</li><li>: FastAPI comes with a sizable body of documentation and growing third-party resources, making it accessible for developers at all levels.</li></ul><p>Before deciding that FastAPI is the best framework for your next project, bear in mind the following:</p><ul><li>: FastAPI, being newer, lacks the maturity of Django or Flask. Its community is smaller, and the user experience may be less streamlined due to less extensive use.&nbsp;</li><li>: As a micro-framework, FastAPI requires additional functionality for fully featured apps. There are fewer compatible libraries compared to Django or Flask, which may require you to develop your own extensions.&nbsp;</li></ul><h2>Choosing between Flask, Django, and FastAPI</h2><p>So, which is the best Python web framework? As with many programming things, the answer is “it depends”.</p><p>The right choice hinges on answering a few questions: What kind of app are you building? What are your priorities? How do you expect your project to grow in the future?</p><p>All three popular Python web frameworks come with unique strengths, so assessing them in the context of your application will help you make the best decision.&nbsp;</p><p>is a great option if you need standard web app functionality out of the box, making it suitable for projects that require a more robust structure. It’s particularly advantageous if you’re using a relational database, as its ORM simplifies data management and provides built-in security features. However, the extensive functionality may feel overwhelming for smaller projects or simple applications.</p><p>, on the other hand, offers greater flexibility. Its minimalist design enables developers to pick and choose the extensions and libraries they want, making it suitable for projects where you need to customize features. This approach works well for startups or MVPs, where your requirements might change and evolve rapidly. While Flask is easy to get started with, keep in mind that building more intricate applications will mean exploring various extensions.</p><p>is a strong contender when speed is of the essence, especially for API-first or <a href=\"https://blog.jetbrains.com/pycharm/2024/09/how-to-use-fastapi-for-machine-learning/\">machine learning</a> projects. It uses modern Python features like type hints to provide automatic data validation and documentation. FastAPI is an excellent choice for applications that need high performance, like microservices or data-driven APIs. Despite this, it may not be as feature-rich as Django or Flask in terms of built-in functionality, which means you might need to implement additional features manually.&nbsp;</p><p>For a deeper comparison between Django and the different web frameworks, check out our other guides, including:</p><h2>Python web framework overview</h2><table><tbody><tr><td>Full-stack framework designed for web apps with relational databases.</td><td>Lightweight backend micro-framework.</td><td>Lightweight micro-framework for building web APIs.</td></tr><tr><td>“Batteries included” approach means everything you need is in the box, accelerating development.

This way, since the work is usually a collaborative effort, I won’t be constantly left in the lurch when communicating with these Programmers or trying to troubleshoot collaborative errors.</p>\n\n<p>More specifically, I was advised to choose Python as the Programming language and/or type to learn. And phew! I was off to codecademy.com. Here, I have learnt only a few things about Python so far. I have also consulted Edglow on YouTube, thereby watching very concise and edifying videos about Python. Sadly, Edglow uploaded only two videos and stopped. I was salivating like a dog at the sight of a bone after seeing his videos, in the excitement to see the next one, but there was none.</p>\n\n<p>The Initial Lessons </p>\n\n<p>I have learnt that there are three basic things to learn in PYTHON namely Data types, Keywords and Variables. Data to the computer is anything fed into the computer which is either an alphabet, a number or a combination of both. Integers, float, character, string and Boolean are the five examples of Data types.</p>\n\n<p>For Keywords, there are a ton of keywords that are identified by the computer but some of the top ones needed for programming include:</p>\n\n<p>TRUE, FALSE, RETURN, FOR, WHILE, AND, IF and OR.</p>\n\n<p>Variables are the names given to a piece of information or data so that the computer can recognise those data each time the variable is fed into it.</p>\n\n<p>Somewhat, this is beyond the binaries of 0s and 1s I learnt about computers in College. From my communication knowledge, the only concept close to this is Man-Machine communication as one of the types of Communication.</p>\n\n<p><em>A Sharp Contrast</em> </p>\n\n<p>But step by step, I am beginning to enjoy the journey. It is difficult to think of a language the computer understands as it differs from the normal human language. What I have learnt so far shows me that the language of the computer is not one alien language I haven’t heard before. It is just a mismatch, a combination of the alphabet and numbers I already know, thereby using them as instructions for the computer to act or not to act at certain times when it is interacted with by something (human or non-human).</p>\n\n<p>It also amazes me that some part of this computer language is the opposite of how humans use them. For instance, using the asterisk sign (*) in normal human language denotes something of importance that must not be ignored. In computers, it is an indication that whatever comes after this sign is to be ignored.</p>\n\n<p><em>Why I think Technical Writers are Interpreters</em></p>\n\n<p>Summarily, technical writers are like interpreters (not the ones between a Higher Level language and the Machine Language in the Computer language process), but human interpreters who act as middlemen to interpret computer or tech-based products to users.</p>\n\n<p>I cannot wait to uncover more in this journey of learning. Since Focus is sacrosanct to growth, in my next post, I shall be digressing a little into what I may have found as the different classes of Technical Writing and which I should be focusing on.</p>\n\n<p>Au revoir</p>\n\n","contentLength":0,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Yield in Python - beyond the data generation","url":"https://dev.to/pikotutorial/yield-in-python-beyond-the-data-generation-4nnn","date":1739870220,"author":"pikoTutorial","guid":4058,"unread":true,"content":"<p>Welcome to the next <a href=\"https://pikotutorial.com\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">pikoTutorial</a> !</p>\n\n<p><code>yield</code> is a well known keyword in Python which allows to optimize the code by generating data streams on the fly instead of generating the same data all at once. To get started, let's look at a simple example where we need to create a data stream of squares of numbers from 0 to 100 million. The naive approach would be to just create a list of these numbers:<br>\n</p>\n\n<div class=\"highlight js-code-highlight\">\n<pre class=\"highlight python\"><code><span class=\"n\">data</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"p\">[</span><span class=\"n\">i</span><span class=\"o\">**</span><span class=\"mi\">2</span> <span class=\"k\">for</span> <span class=\"n\">i</span> <span class=\"ow\">in</span> <span class=\"nf\">range</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"mi\">100_000_000</span><span class=\"p\">)]</span>\n</code></pre>\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>However, this approach ignores the fact that such data has to be fully allocated in memory, which is, of course, a waste of resources because we may end up not needing certain values, and we almost certainly won't need them all at once. So the better approach is to use a generator function by utilizing keyword <code>yield</code>:<br>\n</p>\n\n<div class=\"highlight js-code-highlight\">\n<pre class=\"highlight python\"><code><span class=\"k\">def</span> <span class=\"nf\">generate_data</span><span class=\"p\">():</span>\n    <span class=\"k\">for</span> <span class=\"n\">i</span> <span class=\"ow\">in</span> <span class=\"nf\">range</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"mi\">100_000_000</span><span class=\"p\">):</span>\n        <span class=\"k\">yield</span> <span class=\"n\">i</span><span class=\"o\">**</span><span class=\"mi\">2</span>\n</code></pre>\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>This function will generate individual values on the fly by pausing the function execution at <code>yield</code> keyword after the new value has been returned. Thanks to this mechanism, there's no need for space allocation for all the 100 millions values - we get every subsequent value one by one and only when it is really needed.</p>\n\n<p>That's a well known application of <code>yield</code> keyword, but what more can we do with it?</p>\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  Yield from\n</h2>\n\n<p>Let's look at an example in which we have 2 generator functions and we want to use the first one in the body of the second one:<br>\n</p>\n\n<div class=\"highlight js-code-highlight\">\n<pre class=\"highlight python\"><code><span class=\"k\">def</span> <span class=\"nf\">sub_generator</span><span class=\"p\">():</span>\n    <span class=\"k\">yield</span> <span class=\"mi\">1</span>\n    <span class=\"k\">yield</span> <span class=\"mi\">2</span>\n\n<span class=\"k\">def</span> <span class=\"nf\">main_generator</span><span class=\"p\">():</span>\n    <span class=\"k\">for</span> <span class=\"n\">value</span> <span class=\"ow\">in</span> <span class=\"nf\">sub_generator</span><span class=\"p\">():</span>\n        <span class=\"k\">yield</span> <span class=\"n\">value</span>\n    <span class=\"nf\">print</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"sh\">\"</span><span class=\"s\">Finally able to proceed to main generator logic!</span><span class=\"sh\">\"</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n    <span class=\"k\">yield</span> <span class=\"mi\">3</span>\n\n<span class=\"k\">for</span> <span class=\"n\">output</span> <span class=\"ow\">in</span> <span class=\"nf\">main_generator</span><span class=\"p\">():</span>\n    <span class=\"nf\">print</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">output</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n</code></pre>\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>The output of such code is:<br>\n</p>\n\n<div class=\"highlight js-code-highlight\">\n<pre class=\"highlight plaintext\"><code>1\n2\nFinally able to proceed to main generator logic!\n3\n</code></pre>\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>In such situations, when we first want to obtain values from the sub-generator, we can use the <code>yield from</code> keyword to avoid explicit loop iterating over the sub-generator:<br>\n</p>\n\n<div class=\"highlight js-code-highlight\">\n<pre class=\"highlight python\"><code><span class=\"k\">def</span> <span class=\"nf\">sub_generator</span><span class=\"p\">():</span>\n    <span class=\"k\">yield</span> <span class=\"mi\">1</span>\n    <span class=\"k\">yield</span> <span class=\"mi\">2</span>\n\n<span class=\"k\">def</span> <span class=\"nf\">main_generator</span><span class=\"p\">():</span>\n    <span class=\"k\">yield</span> <span class=\"k\">from</span> <span class=\"nf\">sub_generator</span><span class=\"p\">()</span>\n    <span class=\"nf\">print</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"sh\">\"</span><span class=\"s\">Finally able to proceed to main generator logic!</span><span class=\"sh\">\"</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n    <span class=\"k\">yield</span> <span class=\"mi\">3</span>\n\n<span class=\"k\">for</span> <span class=\"n\">output</span> <span class=\"ow\">in</span> <span class=\"nf\">main_generator</span><span class=\"p\">():</span>\n    <span class=\"nf\">print</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">output</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n</code></pre>\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  Coroutines\n</h2>\n\n<p>Untill this moment, all the examples above showed <code>yield</code> in a role of slightly different <code>return</code> statement - we write yield on the left and the value to be returned on the right.

It's worth noting that the role of sub-generator can be played by...the generator function itself!

But how does it work behind the scenes? In this post, we’ll dive deep into reference counting, garbage collection, and memory optimization techniques in Python.</p>\n\n<p><strong>1️⃣ Reference Counting: The Core of Python’s Memory Management</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>✅ What is Reference Counting?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Python uses a technique called reference counting to keep track of objects in memory. Every object in Python has a reference count that indicates how many variables or data structures are pointing to it.</p>\n\n<p><strong>🔍 How It Works:</strong></p>\n\n<div class=\"highlight js-code-highlight\">\n<pre class=\"highlight plaintext\"><code>When an object is created, its reference count is set to 1.\nEvery time a new reference is made to the object, the count increases.\nWhen a reference is deleted or reassigned, the count decreases.\nWhen the count reaches zero, Python automatically deletes the object to free memory.\n</code></pre>\n\n</div>\n\n<p><strong>🚀 Example of Reference Counting in Action:</strong><br>\n</p>\n\n<div class=\"highlight js-code-highlight\">\n<pre class=\"highlight python\"><code><span class=\"kn\">import</span> <span class=\"n\">sys</span>\n\n<span class=\"n\">x</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"p\">[</span><span class=\"mi\">1</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"mi\">2</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"mi\">3</span><span class=\"p\">]</span>  <span class=\"c1\"># A list object is created\n</span><span class=\"nf\">print</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">sys</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nf\">getrefcount</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">x</span><span class=\"p\">))</span>  <span class=\"c1\"># Reference count (should be 2 due to function argument)\n</span>\n<span class=\"n\">y</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"n\">x</span>  <span class=\"c1\"># Another reference to the same object\n</span><span class=\"nf\">print</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">sys</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nf\">getrefcount</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">x</span><span class=\"p\">))</span>  <span class=\"c1\"># Reference count increases\n</span>\n<span class=\"k\">del</span> <span class=\"n\">x</span>  <span class=\"c1\"># Removing one reference\n</span><span class=\"nf\">print</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">sys</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nf\">getrefcount</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">y</span><span class=\"p\">))</span>  <span class=\"c1\"># Count decreases, but object still exists\n</span>\n<span class=\"k\">del</span> <span class=\"n\">y</span>  <span class=\"c1\"># Now no references remain, object is deleted\n</span></code></pre>\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>🔥 Key Takeaways:</strong></p>\n\n<p>✅ Python automatically deallocates memory when an object is no longer needed.<br>\n✅ Circular references (where two objects reference each other) can cause memory leaks.</p>\n\n<p><strong>2️⃣ Garbage Collection: Handling Circular References</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>✅ Why is Garbage Collection Needed?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Reference counting works well except for one major problem: circular references. If two objects reference each other, their reference count never reaches zero, leading to memory leaks.</p>\n\n<p><strong>🔍 Example of a Circular Reference:</strong><br>\n</p>\n\n<div class=\"highlight js-code-highlight\">\n<pre class=\"highlight python\"><code><span class=\"kn\">import</span> <span class=\"n\">gc</span>\n\n<span class=\"k\">class</span> <span class=\"nc\">Node</span><span class=\"p\">:</span>\n    <span class=\"k\">def</span> <span class=\"nf\">__init__</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">self</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"n\">value</span><span class=\"p\">):</span>\n        <span class=\"n\">self</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"n\">value</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"n\">value</span>\n        <span class=\"n\">self</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nb\">next</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"bp\">None</span>  <span class=\"c1\"># Creates a reference cycle\n</span>\n<span class=\"n\">a</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"nc\">Node</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"mi\">10</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n<span class=\"n\">b</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"nc\">Node</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"mi\">20</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n\n<span class=\"n\">a</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nb\">next</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"n\">b</span>  <span class=\"c1\"># a references b\n</span><span class=\"n\">b</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nb\">next</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"n\">a</span>  <span class=\"c1\"># b references a (circular reference)\n</span>\n<span class=\"k\">del</span> <span class=\"n\">a</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"n\">b</span>  <span class=\"c1\"># Deleting references, but the objects remain in memory\n</span>\n<span class=\"n\">gc</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nf\">collect</span><span class=\"p\">()</span>  <span class=\"c1\"># Python's garbage collector removes them\n</span></code></pre>\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>🚀 How Python’s Garbage Collector Works:</strong></p>\n\n<div class=\"highlight js-code-highlight\">\n<pre class=\"highlight plaintext\"><code>Identifies unreachable objects (those involved in circular references).\nUses a technique called generational garbage collection, dividing objects into three generations based on how long they have been in memory.\nOlder objects are scanned less frequently, improving performance.\n</code></pre>\n\n</div>\n\n<p><strong>🔥 Key Takeaways:</strong></p>\n\n<p>✅ Python's garbage collector handles circular references automatically.<br>\n✅ You can manually trigger garbage collection using gc.collect().<br>\n✅ Use gc.disable() if you want to disable garbage collection for performance reasons.</p>\n\n<p><strong>3️⃣ Memory Optimization Techniques in Python</strong></p>\n\n<p>Even though Python automates memory management, poor memory usage can slow down your program. Here are some best practices to optimize memory in Python:</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>🔹 1.

These characteristics contribute to its ease of use, flexibility, and widespread adoption. But what do these terms actually mean, and why do they matter? Let’s break them down one by one.</p>\n\n\n\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  <strong>1️⃣ Python is a High-Level Language</strong>\n</h2>\n\n<h3>\n  \n  \n  ✅ <strong>What Does \"High-Level\" Mean?</strong>\n</h3>\n\n<p>A <strong>high-level language</strong> is one that abstracts away the complexities of hardware, allowing developers to focus on logic rather than low-level system details. Python is designed to be human-readable and closer to natural language compared to low-level languages like C or Assembly.</p>\n\n<h3>\n  \n  \n  🔍 <strong>Key Characteristics of High-Level Languages:</strong>\n</h3>\n\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Abstraction from hardware:</strong> You don’t need to manage memory manually or worry about CPU instructions.\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Simple syntax:</strong> Python’s syntax is clean and concise, making code easier to write and understand.\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Built-in data structures:</strong> Lists, dictionaries, sets, and tuples are readily available.\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Automatic memory management:</strong> Python’s <strong>Garbage Collector (GC)</strong> handles memory allocation and deallocation for you.\n</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>\n  \n  \n  🚀 <strong>Why It Matters?</strong>\n</h3>\n\n<p>✅ Reduces development time and effort.<br><br>\n✅ Makes Python accessible to beginners.<br><br>\n✅ Easier debugging and maintenance.<br><br>\n✅ More focus on problem-solving rather than low-level implementation details.  </p>\n<h3>\n  \n  \n  🆚 <strong>Comparison: Python vs. Low-Level Languages</strong>\n</h3>\n\n<div class=\"table-wrapper-paragraph\"><table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Feature</th>\n<th>Python (High-Level)</th>\n<th>C (Low-Level)</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Memory Management</td>\n<td>Automatic (Garbage Collection)</td>\n<td>Manual (malloc, free)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Syntax Complexity</td>\n<td>Simple, readable</td>\n<td>More complex, requires explicit memory handling</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Machine Dependency</td>\n<td>Portable, works across platforms</td>\n<td>Often requires platform-specific code</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Learning Curve</td>\n<td>Beginner-friendly</td>\n<td>Steeper learning curve</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table></div>\n\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  <strong>2️⃣ Python is an Interpreted Language</strong>\n</h2>\n<h3>\n  \n  \n  ✅ <strong>What Does \"Interpreted\" Mean?</strong>\n</h3>\n\n<p>An <strong>interpreted language</strong> executes code <strong>line by line</strong> at runtime, instead of compiling it all at once before execution. Python uses an interpreter that reads and executes the code dynamically.</p>\n<h3>\n  \n  \n  🔍 <strong>How Python's Interpreter Works:</strong>\n</h3>\n\n<ul>\n<li>You write a Python script (<code>.py</code> file).\n</li>\n<li>Python’s <strong>interpreter</strong> reads the code and executes it line by line.\n</li>\n<li>There’s no separate compilation step like in C, where source code is converted into a <code>.exe</code> before execution.\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>\n  \n  \n  🚀 <strong>Why It Matters?</strong>\n</h3>\n\n<p>✅ <strong>Faster development cycle</strong> – No need for separate compilation; just write and run.<br><br>\n✅ <strong>Cross-platform portability</strong> – The same Python code runs on Windows, macOS, and Linux without modifications.<br><br>\n✅ <strong>Interactive execution</strong> – Python supports REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop) using the interactive shell (<code>python</code> or <code>ipython</code>), making it great for quick testing and debugging.  </p>\n<h3>\n  \n  \n  🆚 <strong>Comparison: Interpreted vs. Compiled Languages</strong>\n</h3>\n\n<div class=\"table-wrapper-paragraph\"><table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Feature</th>\n<th>Interpreted (Python)</th>\n<th>Compiled (C, Java)</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Execution Process</td>\n<td>Line-by-line execution</td>\n<td>Entire code compiled before execution</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Speed</td>\n<td>Slower due to runtime interpretation</td>\n<td>Faster because of precompiled machine code</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Debugging</td>\n<td>Easier, no need to recompile after changes</td>\n<td>Requires recompilation after changes</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Portability</td>\n<td>High – runs on any OS with Python installed</td>\n<td>Requires recompilation for different OS</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table></div>\n<h4>\n  \n  \n  🔥 <strong>Note:</strong>\n</h4>\n\n<p>Python code <strong>is not purely interpreted</strong>. It is first converted into <strong>bytecode (.pyc files)</strong> and then executed by the Python Virtual Machine (<strong>PVM</strong>). This makes it slightly more efficient than a purely interpreted language.</p>\n\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  <strong>3️⃣ Python is Dynamically Typed</strong>\n</h2>\n<h3>\n  \n  \n  ✅ <strong>What Does \"Dynamically Typed\" Mean?</strong>\n</h3>\n\n<p>A <strong>dynamically typed</strong> language allows variable types to be determined at runtime rather than explicitly defining them at compile time. In Python, you don’t need to declare the type of a variable; Python infers it automatically.</p>\n<h3>\n  \n  \n  🔍 <strong>Example of Dynamic Typing in Python:</strong>\n</h3>\n\n\n<div class=\"highlight js-code-highlight\">\n<pre class=\"highlight python\"><code><span class=\"n\">x</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"mi\">10</span>       <span class=\"c1\"># x is an integer\n</span><span class=\"n\">x</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"sh\">\"</span><span class=\"s\">Hello</span><span class=\"sh\">\"</span>  <span class=\"c1\"># Now x is a string\n</span><span class=\"n\">x</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"p\">[</span><span class=\"mi\">1</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"mi\">2</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"mi\">3</span><span class=\"p\">]</span>  <span class=\"c1\"># Now x is a list\n</span></code></pre>\n\n</div>\n\n\n<p>In contrast, statically typed languages like C or Java require explicit type declarations:<br>\n</p>\n\n<div class=\"highlight js-code-highlight\">\n<pre class=\"highlight c\"><code><span class=\"kt\">int</span> <span class=\"n\">x</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"mi\">10</span><span class=\"p\">;</span>   <span class=\"c1\">// Variable x must always be an integer</span>\n<span class=\"n\">x</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"s\">\"Hello\"</span><span class=\"p\">;</span>  <span class=\"c1\">// Error: Cannot assign string to an integer variable</span>\n</code></pre>\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>🚀 <strong>Why It Matters?</strong></p>\n\n<p>✅ More flexibility – You don’t have to worry about type declarations.<br>\n✅ Less boilerplate code – No need for unnecessary type specifications.<br>\n✅ Faster prototyping – Helps in rapid application development.</p>\n\n<h3>\n  \n  \n  🆚 Comparison: Dynamic vs. Static Typing\n</h3>\n\n<div class=\"table-wrapper-paragraph\"><table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Feature</th>\n<th>Dynamically Typed (Python)</th>\n<th>Statically Typed (C, Java)</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Variable Declaration</td>\n<td>No need to specify type</td>\n<td>Must declare type explicitly</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Flexibility</td>\n<td>High – can change variable types</td>\n<td>Low – fixed type assignment</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Error Detection</td>\n<td>Errors occur at runtime</td>\n<td>Errors detected at compile-time</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Code Readability</td>\n<td>Less cluttered</td>\n<td>More explicit but verbose</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table></div>\n\n<p>🔥 <strong><em>Potential Downsides of Dynamic Typing:</em></strong></p>\n\n<div class=\"highlight js-code-highlight\">\n<pre class=\"highlight plaintext\"><code>Runtime errors: Since type checking happens at runtime, some errors that would be caught at compile-time in statically typed languages may go unnoticed until execution.\nPerformance: Dynamically typed languages can be slower since type checking occurs at runtime rather than during compilation.\nMaintainability challenges: Large codebases might suffer from unexpected type changes.\n</code></pre>\n\n</div>\n\n<p>🔹 <strong>Conclusion</strong></p>\n\n<p>Python’s high-level, interpreted, and dynamically typed nature makes it one of the most flexible and beginner-friendly languages.</p>\n\n<div class=\"highlight js-code-highlight\">\n<pre class=\"highlight plaintext\"><code>High-Level: Easier to read and write, abstracting low-level complexities.\nInterpreted: Executes line by line, enabling quick development and debugging.\nDynamically Typed: No need to declare variable types, allowing for greater flexibility.\n</code></pre>\n\n</div>\n\n<p>While these features make Python powerful and easy to use, they also introduce trade-offs such as slower performance compared to compiled languages and potential runtime errors. Understanding these characteristics helps you write better Python code, optimize performance, and use the language effectively.</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>What’s Next?</em></strong></p>\n\n<p>In the next post, we’ll take a closer look at Python’s memory management, including concepts like reference counting, garbage collection, and memory optimization techniques.

By the end, you’ll not only have a private package but also a sense of accomplishment rivaled only by successfully debugging a <code>KeyError</code> at first glance.</p>\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  What is Poetry? (Not the Rhyming Kind)\n</h2>\n\n<p>Before you start imagining yourself as a wordsmith crafting verses under the moonlight, let me clarify: <strong>Poetry</strong> in this context is a tool for managing Python projects. It simplifies dependency management, package versioning, and publishing. Think of it as your Python project’s personal assistant—organizing everything neatly so you can focus on writing code (and googling stack traces).</p>\n\n<p>Key Features of Poetry:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Dependency Management</strong>: Specify, resolve, and manage your project dependencies in one place.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Virtual Environment Integration</strong>: Automatically creates virtual environments for your project.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Packaging Made Easy</strong>: Build and publish Python packages with minimal effort—no need to wrestle with <code>setup.py</code>.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>In short, Poetry is like that one coworker who always keeps their desk tidy and remembers everyone’s birthday.</p>\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  What is pypiserver? (Hint: It’s Not a Fancy Dessert)\n</h2>\n\n<p>Now, let’s talk about <strong>pypiserver</strong>: a simple, lightweight PyPI (Python Package Index) server you can host yourself. Why would you want this? Well, maybe you’re building proprietary software, or maybe you just want to feel like a Python supervillain hoarding private packages. Either way, pypiserver lets you securely host and serve your own packages without relying on public repositories like PyPI.</p>\n\n<p>Key Features of pypiserver:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Private Package Hosting</strong>: Store your own packages locally or on a private server.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Lightweight</strong>: Minimal setup and resource usage, perfect for small-scale hosting.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Compatibility</strong>: Works seamlessly with pip and other Python tools.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Essentially, it’s like running your own private PyPI, but without needing a degree in server management.</p>\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  Why Would You Want a Private Package Anyway?\n</h2>\n\n<p>Good question! Here are some common reasons:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>You have proprietary code you don’t want to share with the world.</li>\n<li>You’re building reusable modules for internal use within your organization.</li>\n<li>You just want to flex on your teammates by saying, “Oh, I have my own PyPI server.”</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Now that we’ve got the basics down, let’s jump into the fun part: creating a private package and deploying it on pypiserver.</p>\n\n\n\n\n<h3>\n  \n  \n  Step 1: Install Poetry\n</h3>\n\n<p>First, install Poetry. If you don’t already have it, run the following command:<br>\n</p>\n\n<div class=\"highlight js-code-highlight\">\n<pre class=\"highlight shell\"><code>curl <span class=\"nt\">-sSL</span> https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 -\n</code></pre>\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>After installation, make sure Poetry is accessible by checking its version:<br>\n</p>\n\n<div class=\"highlight js-code-highlight\">\n<pre class=\"highlight shell\"><code>poetry <span class=\"nt\">--version</span>\n</code></pre>\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>If you see something like <code>Poetry version 1.6.0</code>, congratulations—you’re ready to roll. If not, double-check your installation steps, and try not to curse too loudly.</p>\n\n\n\n\n<h3>\n  \n  \n  Step 2: Create Your Python Package\n</h3>\n\n<p>Let’s create that private package. For this example, we’re going to make a package called <code>my_private_package</code> because creativity is overrated. Run the following:<br>\n</p>\n\n<div class=\"highlight js-code-highlight\">\n<pre class=\"highlight shell\"><code>poetry new my_private_package\n</code></pre>\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>This command creates a new directory with the following structure:<br>\n</p>\n\n<div class=\"highlight js-code-highlight\">\n<pre class=\"highlight plaintext\"><code>my_private_package/  \n├── my_private_package/  \n│   └── __init__.py  \n├── tests/  \n│   └── __init__.py  \n├── pyproject.toml  \n</code></pre>\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>The <code>pyproject.toml</code> file is Poetry’s version of a project blueprint. It defines everything about your project, from its dependencies to its version number.</li>\n<li>The <code>tests/</code> directory is where you can write tests… you know, once you stop procrastinating.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n\n<h3>\n  \n  \n  Step 3: Write Some Code\n</h3>\n\n<p>Now, let’s add some code to your package. Open <code>my_private_package/__init__.py</code> and add the following:<br>\n</p>\n\n<div class=\"highlight js-code-highlight\">\n<pre class=\"highlight python\"><code><span class=\"k\">def</span> <span class=\"nf\">greet</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">name</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"nb\">str</span><span class=\"p\">)</span> <span class=\"o\">-&gt;</span> <span class=\"nb\">str</span><span class=\"p\">:</span>  \n    <span class=\"k\">return</span> <span class=\"sa\">f</span><span class=\"sh\">\"</span><span class=\"s\">Hello, </span><span class=\"si\">{</span><span class=\"n\">name</span><span class=\"si\">}</span><span class=\"s\">! Welcome to your private package.</span><span class=\"sh\">\"</span>  \n</code></pre>\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s simple, but hey, it gets the job done.</p>\n\n\n\n\n<h3>\n  \n  \n  Step 4: Build the Package\n</h3>\n\n<p>To build your package, navigate to the root directory of your project and run:<br>\n</p>\n\n<div class=\"highlight js-code-highlight\">\n<pre class=\"highlight shell\"><code>poetry build\n</code></pre>\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>This will create a <code>dist/</code> directory containing <code>.tar.gz</code> and <code>.whl</code> files for your package. These are the files you’ll upload to your private PyPI server (or, as I like to call it, your “Python treasure chest”).</p>\n\n\n\n\n<h3>\n  \n  \n  Step 5: Set Up pypiserver\n</h3>\n\n<h4>\n  \n  \n  Install pypiserver\n</h4>\n\n<p>Now it’s time to set up your private PyPI server. First, install pypiserver:<br>\n</p>\n\n<div class=\"highlight js-code-highlight\">\n<pre class=\"highlight shell\"><code>pip <span class=\"nb\">install </span>pypiserver\n</code></pre>\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<h4>\n  \n  \n  Create a Directory for Your Packages\n</h4>\n\n<p>Decide where you want to store your private packages. For example:<br>\n</p>\n\n<div class=\"highlight js-code-highlight\">\n<pre class=\"highlight shell\"><code><span class=\"nb\">mkdir</span> ~/private_packages\n</code></pre>\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<h4>\n  \n  \n  Add security using htpasswd\n</h4>\n\n<p>Create a user and choose a beautiful password for your private PyPi Server<br>\n</p>\n\n<div class=\"highlight js-code-highlight\">\n<pre class=\"highlight shell\"><code>htpasswd <span class=\"nt\">-sc</span> ~/private_packages/htpasswd.txt admin\n</code></pre>\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<h4>\n  \n  \n  Start the Server\n</h4>\n\n<p>Run the following command to start pypiserver:<br>\n</p>\n\n<div class=\"highlight js-code-highlight\">\n<pre class=\"highlight shell\"><code>pypi-server run <span class=\"nt\">-p</span> 8060 ~/private-packages <span class=\"nt\">-P</span> ~/private-packages/htpasswd.txt <span class=\"nt\">--hash-algo</span><span class=\"o\">=</span>sha256\n</code></pre>\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>This will start the server on <code>http://localhost:8060</code>. You can now upload and serve packages from this directory.</p>\n\n\n\n\n<h3>\n  \n  \n  Step 6: Deploy Your Package to pypiserver\n</h3>\n\n<p>Let’s back to <code>my_private_package</code>project directory, and add this on your private PyPi Server (let name it as “treasure_chest”) to the pyproject.toml:<br>\n</p>\n\n<div class=\"highlight js-code-highlight\">\n<pre class=\"highlight toml\"><code><span class=\"nn\">[[tool.poetry.source]]</span>  \n<span class=\"py\">name</span> <span class=\"p\">=</span> <span class=\"s\">\"treasure_chest\"</span>  \n<span class=\"py\">url</span> <span class=\"p\">=</span> <span class=\"s\">\"http://localhost:8060/simple/\"</span>  \n<span class=\"py\">priority</span> <span class=\"p\">=</span> <span class=\"s\">\"supplemental\"</span>\n</code></pre>\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>To upload packages to a server with Poetry, you must first configure it.<br>\n</p>\n\n<div class=\"highlight js-code-highlight\">\n<pre class=\"highlight shell\"><code>poetry config repositories.treasure_chest http://localhost:8060/  \npoetry config http-basic.treasure_chest admin <span class=\"s2\">\"&lt;your_beautiful_password&gt;\"</span>\n</code></pre>\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>Then, yeah this time for upload your packages using this command:<br>\n</p>\n\n<div class=\"highlight js-code-highlight\">\n<pre class=\"highlight shell\"><code>poetry publish <span class=\"nt\">--repository</span> treasure_chest\n</code></pre>\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>This will upload your package on <code>dist/</code>to your private PyPi Server, and you will see your packages on <code>http://localhost:8060/simple/</code>.</p>\n\n\n\n\n<h3>\n  \n  \n  Step 7: Install Your Private Package\n</h3>\n\n<h4>\n  \n  \n  Using pip install\n</h4>\n\n<p>To install your private package from pypiserver, use pip with the <code>--extra-index-url</code> option:<br>\n</p>\n\n<div class=\"highlight js-code-highlight\">\n<pre class=\"highlight shell\"><code>pip <span class=\"nb\">install</span> <span class=\"nt\">--extra-index-url</span> http://localhost:8080 my_private_package\n</code></pre>\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<h4>\n  \n  \n  Using poetry\n</h4>\n\n<p>Or.. you can install it using poetry, with add your private PyPi server configuration on your <code>pyproject.toml</code> like in the package directory earlier<br>\n</p>\n\n<div class=\"highlight js-code-highlight\">\n<pre class=\"highlight toml\"><code><span class=\"nn\">[[tool.poetry.source]]</span>  \n<span class=\"py\">name</span> <span class=\"p\">=</span> <span class=\"s\">\"treasure_chest\"</span>  \n<span class=\"py\">url</span> <span class=\"p\">=</span> <span class=\"s\">\"http://localhost:8060/simple/\"</span>  \n<span class=\"py\">priority</span> <span class=\"p\">=</span> <span class=\"s\">\"supplemental\"</span>\n</code></pre>\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>Then running this command<br>\n</p>\n\n<div class=\"highlight js-code-highlight\">\n<pre class=\"highlight shell\"><code>poetry add <span class=\"nt\">--source</span> treasure_chest my_private_package\n</code></pre>\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>If you see <code>Successfully installed my_private_package</code>, congratulations—you’ve officially entered the realm of private package ninjas.</p>\n\n\n\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  Wrapping Up\n</h2>\n\n<p>And there you have it! You’ve created a private Python package using Poetry and deployed it on pypiserver. Whether you’re building an empire of proprietary modules or just trying to impress your developer friends, you now have the tools to do it.</p>\n\n<p>Remember, with great power comes great responsibility. Use your private PyPI server wisely, and don’t forget to share this tutorial with your favorite Python buddies. Or don’t—it’s your secret package lair, after all.</p>\n\n","contentLength":0,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Oxford Summer School Online Strategies to Motivate Your Students","url":"https://dev.to/oxford_scholars_bf3be47fa/oxford-summer-school-online-strategies-to-motivate-your-students-376c","date":1739853756,"author":"Oxford Scholars","guid":3940,"unread":true,"content":"<p>Motivating students in an online learning environment can be challenging, but with the right strategies, it’s entirely possible to create an engaging and inspiring experience. At Oxford <a href=\"https://www.oxfordscholars.org/programmes\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Summer School Online</a>, we understand the importance of keeping students motivated, especially when they’re learning remotely. Here are some simple, effective, and human-centered strategies to help your students stay excited, focused, and eager to learn.</p>\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  1. Set Clear Goals and Expectations\n</h2>\n\n<p>One of the best ways to motivate students is by setting clear, achievable goals. When students know what’s expected of them, they’re more likely to stay on track and feel a sense of accomplishment as they progress.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Break it down:</strong> Divide larger tasks into smaller, manageable steps. For example, instead of saying, “Write a 10-page essay,” break it into steps like Research the topic, Create an outline, and Write the introduction.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Celebrate milestones:</strong> Acknowledge when students complete a task or reach a goal. A simple “Well done!” or a virtual badge can go a long way in boosting their confidence.</p>\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  2. Create a Supportive and Inclusive Environment\n</h2>\n\n<p>Online learning can sometimes feel isolating, so it’s important to foster a sense of community. When students feel connected and supported, they’re more likely to stay motivated.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Encourage collaboration:</strong> Use group projects, discussion boards, or breakout rooms to help students interact with their peers. At Oxford Summer School Online, we often use collaborative tools like Google Docs or Zoom breakout rooms to encourage teamwork.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Be approachable:</strong> Let students know you’re there for them. A quick check-in message like, “How are you finding the course?” can make a big difference.</p>\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  3. Make Learning Interactive and Fun\n</h2>\n\n<p>Let’s face it—online learning can sometimes feel monotonous. To keep students engaged, incorporate interactive and fun elements into your lessons.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Use multimedia:</strong> Mix things up with videos, podcasts, infographics, and interactive quizzes. For example, instead of a long lecture, you could share a short, engaging video explaining a concept.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Gamify the experience:</strong> Turn learning into a game by introducing points, leaderboards, or rewards. For instance, you could award points for completing assignments on time or participating in discussions.</p>\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  4. Provide Regular Feedback\n</h2>\n\n<p>Feedback is crucial for keeping students motivated. It helps them understand what they’re doing well and where they can improve.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Be specific:</strong> Instead of saying, “Good job,” try something like, “Your analysis of the topic was really thorough—great use of examples!”</p>\n\n<p><strong>Offer constructive criticism:</strong> If a student needs improvement, frame it positively. For example, “Your essay had some great ideas. Next time, try to focus more on structuring your arguments.”</p>\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  5. Connect Learning to Real-Life Applications\n</h2>\n\n<p>Students are more motivated when they see how what they’re learning applies to the real world. At Oxford<a href=\"https://www.oxfordscholars.org/programmes\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"> Summer School course Online</a>, we always try to make this connection clear.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Use real-world examples:</strong> If you’re teaching economics, discuss current events like inflation or global markets. For engineering, talk about recent innovations in technology.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Invite guest speakers:</strong> Bring in professionals from different fields to share their experiences. This not only makes learning more relevant but also inspires students.</p>\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  6. Encourage Self-Directed Learning\n</h2>\n\n<p>Empower students to take charge of their own learning. When they feel a sense of ownership, they’re more likely to stay motivated.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fi997qvgpvterxg5k02av.jpg\" class=\"article-body-image-wrapper\"><img src=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fi997qvgpvterxg5k02av.jpg\" alt=\"Image description\" width=\"800\" height=\"533\"></a></p>\n\n<p><strong>Offer choices:</strong> Let students choose topics for projects or assignments. For example, in a literature course, they could pick a book from a list to analyze.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Promote curiosity:</strong> Encourage students to explore topics that interest them. You could suggest additional resources like articles, videos, or podcasts.</p>\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  7. Recognize and Reward Effort\n</h2>\n\n<p>Everyone likes to feel appreciated. Recognizing students’ hard work can boost their motivation and encourage them to keep going.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Shout-outs</strong>: Publicly acknowledge students’ achievements during virtual classes or on discussion boards. For example, “Great job, Sarah, on your presentation!”</p>\n\n<p><strong>Small rewards:</strong> Offer incentives like certificates, virtual badges, or even a mention in a newsletter.</p>\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  8. Be Flexible and Understanding\n</h2>\n\n<p>Online learning comes with its own set of challenges, from technical issues to personal distractions. Being flexible and understanding can help students stay motivated.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Offer extensions when needed:</strong> If a student is struggling to meet a deadline, consider giving them a little extra time.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Check in regularly:</strong> A simple message like, “Is everything okay? Let me know if you need help,” can make students feel supported.</p>\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  9. Incorporate Breaks and Downtime\n</h2>\n\n<p>Studying online can be mentally exhausting. Encourage students to take breaks and recharge.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Schedule breaks:</strong> During longer sessions, include short breaks to help students relax and refocus.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Promote self-care:</strong> Remind students to take care of themselves by getting enough sleep, eating well, and staying active.</p>\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  10. Lead by Example\n</h2>\n\n<p>Your enthusiasm and passion for teaching can be contagious. If you’re excited about the subject, your students are more likely to be too.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Show your passion:</strong> Share why you love the subject you’re teaching. For example, “I find AI fascinating because it’s changing the way we live and work.”</p>\n\n<p><strong>Stay positive</strong>: Even when things get tough, maintain a positive attitude. Your energy will inspire your students to keep going.</p>\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  Final Thoughts\n</h2>\n\n<p>Motivating students in an online environment requires creativity, empathy, and a willingness to adapt. At Oxford Summer School Course Online, we believe that every student has the potential to thrive when given the right support and encouragement. By setting clear goals, creating a supportive community, making learning fun, and recognizing students’ efforts, you can help them stay motivated and achieve their full potential.</p>\n\n<p>Remember, the key is to keep things simple, human, and engaging. With these strategies, you’ll not only motivate your students but also create a memorable and rewarding learning experience for everyone involved. Happy teaching!</p>\n\n","contentLength":0,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Is Python Still Necessary in 2025?","url":"https://dev.to/lekshmi_525/is-python-still-necessary-in-2025-di7","date":1739853265,"author":"Lekshmi","guid":3939,"unread":true,"content":"<p>As we progress further into the digital age, programming languages continue to evolve, with new technologies, frameworks, and tools constantly emerging. However, despite the rapid pace of change, Python has managed to maintain its position as one of the most popular and versatile programming languages. As we look toward 2025, the question arises: Is Python still necessary?</p>\n\n<p>The answer, in short, is yes. Python is not only still relevant in 2025, but it is also expected to continue being a dominant language in the tech industry. Here’s why Python remains essential for developers, data scientists, engineers, and businesses in the coming years:</p>\n\n<p><strong>1. Simplicity and Accessibility</strong></p>\n\n<p>One of Python's strongest attributes is its simplicity and readability. Known for its clean syntax and easy-to-understand structure, Python has long been a favorite for beginners and seasoned professionals alike. Its simplicity allows developers to focus more on solving problems than on complex language intricacies. As technology continues to evolve, this ease of use will remain one of Python’s greatest advantages.</p>\n\n<p>In 2025, programming education is expected to emphasize ease of learning and productivity, making Python an even more attractive language for newcomers.

Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-4, LLaMA, and Gemini. However, as the demand for more autonomous and intelligent systems grows, AI is evolving beyond traditional models into <strong>AI agents</strong>. While both serve powerful functions, their roles, capabilities, and potential applications differ significantly.</p>\n\n<p>In this blog, we'll explore the key differences between <strong>traditional AI models (LLMs)</strong> and <strong>AI agents (Agentic AI)</strong> to understand where the future of AI is heading.</p>\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  What Are Traditional AI Models?\n</h2>\n\n<p>Traditional AI models, particularly <strong>LLMs</strong>, are designed to process and generate text-based responses based on input prompts.

Proxy IPs, short for proxy servers with dedicated IP addresses, play a pivotal role in achieving these objectives. This article delves into how Proxy IPs can significantly enhance API performance and security, with a brief mention of 98IP Proxy as an example. By understanding the mechanisms and benefits, API developers and administrators can leverage Proxy IPs to fortify their digital infrastructure.</p>\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  I. Understanding Proxy IPs and Their Role in API Management\n</h2>\n\n<h3>\n  \n  \n  A. What are Proxy IPs?\n</h3>\n\n<p>Proxy IPs act as intermediaries between a client's request and the server hosting the API. They forward requests from clients to the API server and return responses back to the client, often modifying the request or response in the process.</p>\n\n<h3>\n  \n  \n  B. Why Use Proxy IPs with APIs?\n</h3>\n\n<p><strong>Load Balancing:</strong> Proxy IPs distribute incoming API requests across multiple servers, preventing any single server from becoming a bottleneck.<br>\n<strong>Caching:</strong> By caching frequently requested data, Proxy IPs reduce the load on the API server and decrease response times.<br>\n<strong>Security Enhancements:</strong> Proxy IPs can filter and sanitize incoming requests, blocking malicious traffic and protecting the API from attacks.<br>\n <br></p>\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  II. Enhancing API Performance with Proxy IPs\n</h2>\n<h3>\n  \n  \n  A.

Construct\n</h2>\n\n<p>All programming languages revolve around functions as fundamental building blocks. We encapsulate code within functions and invoke them at runtime.

Colored boxes represent the function's input arguments.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h3>\n  \n  \n  Function Input Arguments\n</h3>\n\n<p>A caller function must be aware of all required data and pass it to the called function through input arguments.</p>\n\n<p>In <strong>object-oriented programming (OOP),</strong> additional data can be accessed through object member variables, reducing the reliance on function arguments. However, this approach is limited to the member variables of the specific object. Furthermore, adding new member variables to a class or object still requires passing them as arguments during object construction.</p>\n\n<h3>\n  \n  \n  Explosion of Function Variations\n</h3>\n\n<p>As a software system expands its functionality, the number of functions grows exponentially. Variations of functions emerge to accommodate different use cases, leading to an increasingly complex codebase.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fgi020earb8ihy6l5r23h.png\" class=\"article-body-image-wrapper\"><img src=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fgi020earb8ihy6l5r23h.png\" alt=\"The complexity of the codebase grows exponentially.\" width=\"800\" height=\"438\"></a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Figure 2.</strong> The complexity of the codebase grows exponentially, even with continuous code refactoring.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Each layer represents an application layer, such as the API, business logic, domain-specific components, or data transformation. Sub-numbers indicate variations in use cases and branching within these layers.</p>\n\n<h3>\n  \n  \n  Why Can't Refactoring Help?\n</h3>\n\n<p>The extent of codebase refactoring is irrelevant because refactoring merely <strong>shifts complexity</strong> from one form to another. It can reduce a small number of massive, branching-heavy functions, but in doing so, it often <strong>explodes into an enormous number of smaller, interdependent functions, forming a complex execution graph</strong>.  </p>\n\n<p><strong>Figure 2</strong> is actually more representative of a refactored codebase—one where complexity is distributed across a large number of smaller, interconnected functions. However, real-world software architectures are far more intricate than this diagram suggests. These diagrams serve only to illustrate the core idea.  </p>\n\n<p>For applications with <strong>a small number of features and use cases,</strong> copying and pasting a few functions is rarely a concern. However, in <strong>enterprise software,</strong> the sheer scale of features and customizations <strong>drives exponential growth in branching and function variations</strong>, making complexity unavoidable.  </p>\n\n<h3>\n  \n  \n  Handling a Code Change\n</h3>\n\n<p>Code changes often require the introduction of a new data element. The most common way to deliver data is through input arguments. As a result, all functions involved in the feature must expand their input arguments to accommodate the change. This effect is known as <strong>“argument drilling.”</strong>  </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fg0s3cjyzsa2vgfvsgeg2.png\" class=\"article-body-image-wrapper\"><img src=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fg0s3cjyzsa2vgfvsgeg2.png\" alt=\"Argument drilling\" width=\"800\" height=\"647\"></a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Figure 3.</strong> <em>\"Argument drilling\"</em> – A red box represents a new input argument required by <em>Func 4</em>. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Unfortunately, <strong>argument drilling</strong> has a significant impact, as it requires modifying not only all functions in the chain but also creating new function variations.  </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fs6wgy7zwnjmw1yw64rkr.png\" class=\"article-body-image-wrapper\"><img src=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fs6wgy7zwnjmw1yw64rkr.png\" alt=\"The magnitude of a code change\" width=\"800\" height=\"369\"></a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p><em><strong>Figure 4.</strong> The magnitude of a “simple” code change in a large system.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>\"Simple code changes\" become complex in large systems because the number of touchpoints <strong>grows exponentially</strong>.</p>\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  Execution Flows Programming Paradigm\n</h2>\n\n<p>The benefits of the <strong>Execution Flows</strong> programming paradigm stem from three key characteristics:</p>\n\n<p>1) <strong>Functions take no arguments</strong>.<br><br>\n2) <strong>Functions are mixins</strong>.<br><br>\n3) <strong>Functions use alias names</strong>.  </p>\n\n<p>Let’s explore each of these in more detail.</p>\n\n<h3>\n  \n  \n  Introducing Methods and Properties as Nullary Functions\n</h3>\n\n<p>The first significant difference in the <strong>Execution Flows</strong> programming paradigm is that a function (referred to as a <strong>method</strong>) can access any data point (referred to as a <strong>property</strong>) available in the flow context.  </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Ffv77rlijjs85a6m5zajq.png\" class=\"article-body-image-wrapper\"><img src=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Ffv77rlijjs85a6m5zajq.png\" alt=\"Methods have direct access to properties\" width=\"800\" height=\"1277\"></a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>_<strong>Figure 5.</strong> Execution flow provides data properties (<strong>colored boxes</strong>) to its methods directly from the flow context, eliminating the need to pass them as arguments.  </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Because data properties are directly available to any method, methods rarely require arguments. When they do, these arguments are <strong>local and ephemeral</strong>, such as an index or the current item in a loop, which is readily available within the method's scope.  </p>\n\n<h3>\n  \n  \n  Methods and Properties as Mixins\n</h3>\n\n<p>The second key characteristic of methods and properties in the <strong>Execution Flows</strong> paradigm is that they function as <strong>mixins</strong>.

Instead, the <strong>Flow</strong> determines which implementation of <em>Method 2</em> will be used: either <em>Method 2-1</em> or <em>Method 2-2</em>.</p>\n\n<p>Because:<br><br>\n1) <strong>Methods take no arguments</strong>, reducing dependency on explicit data passing.<br>\n2) <strong>Methods are mixins</strong> and can be added to any flow.<br>\n3) <strong>Methods use alias names</strong> to access other mixins instead of direct references.</p>\n\n<p>As a result, we achieve <strong>multiple orders of magnitude fewer variations</strong> in function implementations.  </p>\n\n<p>Now, let’s explore how much this reduces complexity.  </p>\n\n<h3>\n  \n  \n  The Complexity of a Code Change in the Execution Flows Programming Paradigm Is...\n</h3>\n\n<p>Unlike other programming paradigms, where code changes lead to variations of functions, <strong>code changes in the Execution Flows paradigm</strong> are highly localized. A change affects only the <strong>method</strong> that requires modification and involves adding a new <strong>property</strong> to the execution flow.  </p>\n\n<p>Adding a property to a flow is a <strong>one-line change</strong>.  </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fpuhp4q3wlu5dgas75izw.png\" class=\"article-body-image-wrapper\"><img src=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fpuhp4q3wlu5dgas75izw.png\" alt=\"Adding a change in Execution Flows\" width=\"798\" height=\"1358\"></a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p><em><strong>Figure 7.</strong> The red box represents a new data property used by <em>Method 4</em>.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>To better understand how localized a code change is, let’s examine what it takes to modify multiple flows that are variations of a similar use case.  </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2F7a05fghvokb91xcpp5lb.png\" class=\"article-body-image-wrapper\"><img src=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2F7a05fghvokb91xcpp5lb.png\" alt=\"Adding a change to many Flows\" width=\"800\" height=\"247\"></a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p><em><strong>Figure 8.</strong> Implementing a change across multiple flows.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The code change is limited to <em>Method 4-1</em> and involves adding a new <strong>property mixin</strong> to the flows that use <em>Method 4-1</em>.  </p>\n\n<p>Adding a property mixin to a flow is a <strong>one-line code change</strong>.  </p>\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  <strong>Conclusion</strong>\n</h2>\n\n<p>By adopting the <strong>Execution Flows</strong> paradigm, we reduce the <strong>exponential complexity</strong> of a code change from <strong>O(kⁿ)</strong> to <strong>constant complexity O(1)</strong>.  </p>\n\n<p>For example, the code change shown in <strong>Figure 8</strong> required modifying only a single <strong>method</strong> and adding a <strong>property</strong> to a fixed number of flows.  </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>You can check out the Python open-source project <a href=\"https://github.com/execution-flows/flow-compose\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Flow Compose</a>, a tool that facilitates the implementation of the <strong>Execution Flows</strong> programming paradigm.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n","contentLength":0,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Chatbot with Semantic Kernel - Part 6: AI Connectors 🔌","url":"https://dev.to/davidgsola/chatbot-with-semantic-kernel-part-6-ai-connectors-4b63","date":1739833663,"author":"David Sola","guid":2093,"unread":true,"content":"<p>One of Semantic Kernel's key features is the ability to easily swap between different AI providers.

Running models locally is very useful for AI developers since it allows us to maintain everything offline, switch between open models effortlessly, and avoid unnecessary complexity and costs associated with cloud-based models.</p>\n\n<p>Ollama can be installed on Windows, Linux, and macOS from its  <a href=\"https://ollama.com/download\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">webpage</a>. Once installed, we can explore their <a href=\"https://ollama.com/search\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">library of models</a> to find a model that fits our purpose. Keep in mind that each model requires different hardware capacity to run locally. Although the reality is more complex, you can consider the size of the model (number of billions of parameters) to estimate its hardware needs. Additionally, each model in the library includes tags with useful information: function calling (tool) support, modality, etc. To run the model locally, simply open a <code>terminal</code> and run <code>ollama run &lt;model-name&gt;:&lt;flavour&gt;</code> (e.g., <code>ollama run phi4</code> or <code>ollama run llama3.2:1b</code>).</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fwray7zwti9mglingftl5.png\" class=\"article-body-image-wrapper\"><img src=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fwray7zwti9mglingftl5.png\" alt=\"Ollama - Run model\" width=\"800\" height=\"48\"></a></p>\n\n<p>Once the model is running, it can be accessed via <a href=\"https://github.com/ollama/ollama/blob/main/README.md#cli-reference\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><code>terminal</code></a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/ollama/ollama/blob/main/docs/api.md#generate-a-chat-completion\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><code>api</code></a> or via libraries/frameworks.

Instead of just generating text, the LLM can determine that a specific action needs to be taken, and then request that action to be performed by an external function.</p>\n\n<p>Function calling allows users to interact with complex systems using natural language while the LLM handles the underlying function executions. So the LLMs can focus on solving practical problems instead of just generating text.</p>\n\n<p><em>For example</em>, if a user asks for the weather, the model can call a weather API to get real-time data instead of just generating a generic response. It might help you to remind you to take an umbrella with you, if there’s a chance of rain.</p>\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  Function calling process explained\n</h2>\n\n<p>Let’s break down how function calling works inside an LLM</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fj5d8gv36nzaq12dkpko6.jpg\" class=\"article-body-image-wrapper\"><img src=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fj5d8gv36nzaq12dkpko6.jpg\" alt=\"Function calling process explained\" width=\"800\" height=\"421\"></a></p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>\n<strong>User Query:</strong> The process starts when a user asks a question or requests an action (e.g., \"What's the weather today?\" or \"Check if product X is in stock\").</li>\n<li>\n<strong>LLM Processing:</strong> The LLM analyzes the query and recognizes it needs external data or an action to fulfill the request. For example:\n\n<ul>\n<li>If the user asks about the weather, the LLM identifies the need to fetch live data.</li>\n<li>If the user wants inventory details, it triggers a database lookup.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Function Call Decision:</strong> The LLM decides to execute a function call, which can be either:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>API Calls: Connects to external services (e.g., a Weather API to retrieve real-time forecasts).</li>\n<li>Custom Functions: Accesses internal tools or databases (e.g., Inventory Access to check stock levels).</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Data Retrieval:</strong> The function fetches the required data (e.g., temperature from the Weather API, product availability from a warehouse database).</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Data Integration:</strong> The retrieved data is sent back to the LLM, which processes it and generates a contextual, accurate response for the user.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  Function calling use-cases and how it improve the performance\n</h2>\n\n<p>By being able to call functions, the LLM isn't just limited to text generation. It can perform actions like retrieving live data or interacting with other software. That makes the model more dynamic and useful in real-world applications. Like:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Providing up-to-date information:</strong> If the model can pull in up-to-date information through function calls, it can provide more accurate answers. For instance, answering questions about current events without function calling might lead to outdated info, but with access to a news API, the answers stay current.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Automation of repetitive tasks:</strong> Function calling could automate repetitive tasks. Like, if a user wants to schedule a meeting, the LLM could call a calendar API to add an event automatically. This saves time and reduces the need for manual input.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Connecting with other services:</strong> LLMs can become part of a larger ecosystem, connecting with databases, CRMs, or other enterprise systems. This makes them more versatile in professional environments.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Handling complex workflows:</strong> Instead of just answering a single question, the LLM can orchestrate multiple function calls to solve a multi-step problem. Like planning a trip by checking flight availability, booking a hotel, and renting a car through different APIs.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Update information without re-training:</strong> As new functions or APIs become available, the LLM can be updated to use them without retraining the entire model. This keeps the system up-to-date with minimal effort.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>\n  \n  \n  Some examples of function calling\n</h3>\n\n<p>You might have already seen or experienced function calling if you've used any GPTs from the ChatGPT marketplace. These GPTs execute custom functions let people create specialized tools like to-do list builders, prompt enhancers, app connectors, and Q&amp;A bots. The built-in 'Tasks' feature in ChatGPT uses this too – it can set reminders by triggering functions at specific times.</p>\n\n<p>Claude’s Model Context Protocol (MCP) does something similar. With Sonnet 3.5, Claude can activate tools like Brave Search for web results, tap into its graph memory system, or link to other apps. Both systems show how AI now uses these \"function calls\" to connect its core intelligence to real-world tools.</p>\n\n<h3>\n  \n  \n  AI Models that support function calling\n</h3>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> Sometimes function calling is also known as tool calling. These two are the same terms.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Some of the models that support function calling are:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>GPT-4o</li>\n<li>Llama 3.2</li>\n<li>Google’s Gemini 2.0 Flash Experimental</li>\n<li>Claude</li>\n<li>Mistral </li>\n<li>Cohere’s Command R</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><em>While there are many more, these models are easily accessible via API and some are open source available for local use via Ollama</em></p>\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  Function Calling in Action — Let’s create an AI Search Tool using Ollama\n</h2>\n\n<p>We’re building a search tool where Llama 3.2 acts as a decision-maker – it first analyzes whether a query requires real-time web data. If yes, it triggers the web_search tool automatically via Ollama’s tool-calling API. This mimics how Perplexity balances AI reasoning with live data.<br>\n<strong>What we will need:</strong></p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Ollama: Hosts the Llama 3.2 model locally.</li>\n<li>Python 3.11+: Required for async/await patterns (critical for performance)</li>\n<li>SearchAPI: Free tier supports 100 requests/day. (<a href=\"https://www.searchapi.io/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Link</a>)</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>\n  \n  \n  Let’s start with defining the function:\n</h3>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>Note</em>: Ollama calls this as tool calling which is same as function calling.<br>\nThis is going to be our tool, whose parameters are based on the answers returned by <a href=\"https://www.searchapi.io/docs/google\"

Instead of generic answers, they solve real problems by bridging natural language with software and real-world data.

Do not do what I did. This is a bad use of generative AI. This is pure silliness with no real practical value whatsoever. This is a really, really, bad idea. But it was fun as hell, so here goes.</p>\n\n<p>Last year I did two investigations into recipe parsing on the web. As we all know, most recipe sites go out of their way to make the actual recipe, you know, the thing you want to read, obfuscated and buried beneath a lot of stuff that is... well not the actual recipe. I first investigated JSON-LD and using that to parse web recipes into data: <a href=\"https://www.raymondcamden.com/2024/06/12/scraping-recipes-using-nodejs-pipedream-and-json-ld\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Scraping Recipes Using Node.js, Pipedream, and JSON-LD</a>. This worked <em>really</em> well. I then followed it up with a more generic approach using Gemini and generative AI: <a href=\"https://www.raymondcamden.com/2024/11/27/using-generative-ai-to-parse-web-pages-into-data\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Using Generative AI to Parse Web Pages into Data</a>. This worked pretty good as well, and could be adapted for other purposes and types of content.</p>\n\n<p>This came up in conversation with my friends today, and on a whim, because, this is how my 50+ year brain works, I wondered if it was possible to take a nice, filtered out recipe and go the <em>other</em> way? I.e., fill it with crap and obfuscate the simple recipe into a SEO-ridden nightmare and wall of text?</p>\n\n<p>Yes, the answer is yes, you can. Let's get started, shall we?</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fl0f0rkdwnd2qf0ehuqrg.gif\" class=\"article-body-image-wrapper\"><img src=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fl0f0rkdwnd2qf0ehuqrg.gif\" alt=\"Evil cat rubbing hands together\" width=\"480\" height=\"480\"></a></p>\n\n<p>I began by prototyping in Gemini's <a href=\"https://aistudio.googl.ecom\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">AI Studio</a>. I used this as a system instruction:<br>\n</p>\n\n<div class=\"highlight js-code-highlight\">\n<pre class=\"highlight plaintext\"><code>You take a simple recipe and do your best to expand upon it with\nsuperfluous text, including a made up story about the author's childhood\nand why the recipe means so much to them.

Where do I even begin? This isn't just a recipe; it's a time capsule. A portal back to simpler days, filled with laughter, scraped knees, and the comforting aroma of… well, probably not this, because we didn't have slow cookers back then.</p>\n\n<p>You see, growing up in… let's just call it a 'coastal region,' pot roasts weren't exactly a staple. We were more about the seafood paella. But one summer, my aunt Mildred, bless her heart, came to visit. Mildred was from Mississippi, and she brought with her a suitcase full of stories, a thick Southern drawl, and this recipe.</p>\n\n<p>I remember being a picky eater, turning up my nose at anything that wasn't fish sticks or ice cream. But Mildred insisted. She said this pot roast was 'magic,' capable of curing any bad mood. She might have said it with a wink, but the point is that this stuck. After a great deal of digging in my memories, here is the recipe:</p>\n\n<p>First, procure the following ingredients, they're rather important: one should plan to have about 3-pounds of chuck roast. Additionally, there must be one half (12-ounce) jar pepperoncini peppers (with juice). The butter must be unsalted. 1 (1-ounce) packet ranch dressing mix. A similar sized packet, 1 (1-ounce), of au jus gravy mix is also required. Salt and pepper to taste is, of course, assumed, however is listed for completeness.</p>\n\n<p>Now, in a methodical way, we can start to assemble the recipe. Carefully place the chuck roast in the bottom of a slow cooker. Once you've placed it, sprinkle the ranch dressing mix and au jus gravy mix over the top of the roast. After that, add the butter and pepperoncini peppers (with juice) on top. At this point, season with salt and pepper to taste. Once seasoned, cover and cook on low for 8 hours or until the meat is tender and easily shredded with a fork. Finally, serve with mashed potatoes, crusty bread, or in sandwiches.</p>\n\n<p>And that, my friends, is Mississippi Pot Roast. It might not cure a bad mood, but it'll fill your belly and, hopefully, bring a smile to your face. And maybe, just maybe, it'll transport you back to a simpler time, filled with the warmth of family and the magic of… well, pot roast.</p>\n\n\n\n\n<p>Beautiful. I could have stopped there, but then my buddy Todd had a suggestion - I should also add a bunch of snarky comments from folks asking for modifications, complaining, and so forth. And for fun, a few random political ones as well.</p>\n\n<p>That sounded great. So I modified my system instruction to include:<br>\n</p>\n\n<div class=\"highlight js-code-highlight\">\n<pre class=\"highlight plaintext\"><code>Also return ten to twenty comments from slight angry, snarky commentors\ndemanding different versions, like a vegan one, or one that will work\non Mars. the comments should not be helpful in anyway. Within the\ncomments, sprinkle a few that are political and completely out of context.\n</code></pre>\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>The results were delicious:</p>\n\n\n\n\n<p>VeganVixen: Can this be made vegan?</p>\n\n<p>WokeWarrior77: This is cultural appropriation!</p>\n\n<p>BirdBrain: Can I use turkey instead of beef?</p>\n\n<p>CalorieCounter: What is the nutritional information?</p>\n\n<p>DisappointedDiner: I tried this and it was terrible. My roast was dry!</p>\n\n<p>SpaceChef: How do I make this on Mars? I need specific instructions for Martian atmosphere.</p>\n\n<p>SimpleSimon: This recipe is too complicated. Can you make it simpler?</p>\n\n<p>PepperHater: What if I don't like pepperoncini peppers?</p>\n\n<p>PeacefulProtester: This recipe supports the military industrial complex!</p>\n\n<p>DairyDisaster: I am allergic to dairy, what can I substitute for the butter?</p>\n\n<p>PressureCookerPro: Can I make this in an Instant Pot?</p>\n\n<p>TruthSeeker: This recipe is fake news!</p>\n\n<p>GlutenFreeGal: Is there a gluten-free version of this recipe?</p>\n\n<p>SaltySue: My roast came out too salty. What did I do wrong?</p>\n\n<p>OrganicOnly: This recipe uses too many processed ingredients.</p>\n\n<p>SelfSufficientSally: Please provide instructions on how to raise the cow, slaughter it, and butcher the roast. This recipe is incomplete.</p>\n\n\n\n\n<p>That last one was <em>perfect</em>.</p>\n\n<p>The final step I took was to define a structured output such that I'd get a JSON result with the recipe and an array of comments with name and the comment text. In case you're curious, this is how that looks in AI Studio:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Foy7l47qdjqctboaauxy1.jpg\" class=\"article-body-image-wrapper\"><img src=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Foy7l47qdjqctboaauxy1.jpg\" alt=\"Visual editor for the output schema\" width=\"650\" height=\"552\"></a></p>\n\n<p>I then took the code output from AI Studio and dropped into a Cloudflare Worker. All this does is look for a recipe string sent in as input, pass it to Gemini, and return the result.

Web Hosting</a></strong></p>\n\n<h1>\n  \n  \n  In - depth Understanding of Base64: Principles, Applications, and Front - end Practices\n</h1>\n\n<p>In front-end development, project optimization is a crucial aspect of improving performance. One common optimization strategy is to appropriately replace embedded small images with Base64 strings to reduce the number of HTTP requests on a page. Meanwhile, it's emphasized that these should be small images, usually with a size not exceeding a specific number of kilobytes. So, what exactly is Base64? And why can it play a role in front - end optimization? Let's explore in depth together.</p>\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  Initial Understanding\n</h2>\n\n<p>You may not be unfamiliar with a string like this:<br>\n</p>\n\n<div class=\"highlight js-code-highlight\">\n<pre class=\"highlight plaintext\"><code>data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0c......\n</code></pre>\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>Through this fixed format, we can represent an image, and the browser can recognize it and display the corresponding image completely. The above example shows an SVG - formatted image. In fact, we can also load images in any format supported by the browser. This string is generated based on Base64 encoding, and the long string of characters after <code>base64,</code> is the Base64 - encoded string.</p>\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  How Base64 Came into Being\n</h2>\n\n<p>In the early days of the Internet's development, email was one of the most effective applications. However, in the early days, the SMTP transmission protocol for email could only be used to transmit 7 - bit ASCII codes. Since ASCII codes were designed based on the English language, it led to the inability to send resources such as text from non - English - speaking countries through this protocol. To solve this problem, the Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (MIME) emerged later. MIME added the main structure of emails and defined the encoding and transmission rules for non - ASCII codes, which is the origin of Base64. If you want to understand the knowledge of character encoding in depth, you can refer to the character encoding knowledge that needs to be understood in front - end development.</p>\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  Basic Definition\n</h2>\n\n<p>Base64 is an encoding and decoding method that represents binary data based on 64 printable characters. Because of its encoding and decoding characteristics, its main function is not security, but to ensure that content can be transmitted error - free between various gateways. These 64 printable characters include 26 uppercase letters A - Z, 26 lowercase letters a - z, 10 digits 0 - 9, a total of 62 characters, plus two other characters <code>+</code> and <code>/</code>. Base64 is an index - based encoding, and each character corresponds to an index. The specific relationship diagram is as follows:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://leapcell.io/?lc_t=d_base64\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fe1umzx0m33zyu6tuorjy.png\" alt=\"Image description\" width=\"653\" height=\"478\"></a></p>\n\n<p>This is also the origin of the \"64\" in the name.</p>\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  Encoding Method\n</h2>\n\n<p>Since 64 is equal to 2 to the power of 6, a Base64 character actually represents 6 binary bits (bit). However, in binary data, 1 byte corresponds to 8 bits (bit). Therefore, a string or binary data of 3 bytes (3 x 8 = 24 bits) can be exactly converted into 4 Base64 characters (4 x 6 = 24 bits). Why is it grouped in 3 - byte units? Because the least common multiple of 6 and 8 is 24, and 24 bits is exactly 3 bytes. The specific encoding method is as follows:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Take every 3 bytes as a group. Three bytes have a total of 24 binary bits.</li>\n<li>Divide these 24 binary bits into 4 groups, with each group having 6 binary bits.</li>\n<li>Add two 00s in front of each group of 6 binary bits to expand it to 32 binary bits, that is, four bytes.</li>\n<li>Each byte corresponds to a number less than 64, which is the character number.</li>\n<li>Then, according to the character index relationship table, each character number corresponds to a character, and the Base64 - encoded characters are obtained.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://leapcell.io/?lc_t=d_base64\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2F90n053s6pzn0y2s9t2va.png\" alt=\"Image description\" width=\"541\" height=\"190\"></a></p>\n\n<p>For example, the string <code>two</code> in the above figure is converted to obtain the corresponding encoding.</p>\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  Volume Increase\n</h2>\n\n<p>When 3 characters are encoded through Base64 conversion, they finally become 4 characters. This is because each 6 - bit position is padded with 2 0s to become 8 - bit positions, corresponding to 1 byte. Here, it is exactly one - third more. So, under normal circumstances, the volume of Base64 - encoded data is usually one - third larger than the original data. This is why when optimizing images using Base64 encoding as mentioned earlier, it is necessary to emphasize that they are small icons. If all images are processed in this way, the static files will increase significantly, which is not appropriate.</p>\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  The \"=\" Sign\n</h2>\n\n<p>Three English characters can be exactly converted into 4 Base64 characters. What if the character length is not a multiple of 3? What rules should be followed? In actual use of Base encoding, we often find the existence of a 65th character, which is the <code>=</code> symbol. This equal sign is a handling method for this special situation. For parts with less than 3 bytes, 0s are actually added at the end until there are 24 binary bits. However, it should be noted that when calculating the number of bytes, the total length is directly divided by 3. If the remainder is 1, a <code>=</code> is directly added at the end. If the remainder is 2, two <code>=</code>s are added. Therefore, the suffix equal sign that needs to be added to the transcoded string is either 1 or 2. The specific situation can be seen in the following figure:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://leapcell.io/?lc_t=d_base64\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fa4tna1jrqfduallelqm1.png\" alt=\"Image description\" width=\"800\" height=\"410\"></a></p>\n\n<p>In the second case in the figure, the single character <code>d</code> is used to distinguish the index 0 in the index character table. At this time, in the obtained encoding, there will be an <code>A</code> character corresponding to the index 0, and two <code>=</code>s are directly added.</p>\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  Non - ASCII Characters\n</h2>\n\n<p>Since Base64 can only encode ASCII characters, for non - ASCII characters such as Japanese characters, the Japanese characters need to be converted into ASCII characters first and then encoded.</p>\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  Encoding and Decoding Methods\n</h2>\n\n<h3>\n  \n  \n  btoa and atob\n</h3>\n\n<p>JavaScript provides two native methods for handling Base64 encoding: <code>btoa()</code> and <code>atob()</code>.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>\n<code>btoa()</code>: Converts a string or binary value into a Base64 - encoded string. It should be noted that the <code>btoa</code> method can only directly handle ASCII - code characters. For non - ASCII - code characters, it will report an error.</li>\n<li>\n<code>atob()</code>: Decodes a Base64 - encoded string. If the string parameter passed to the <code>atob</code> method is not a valid Base64 encoding (such as non - ASCII characters) or its length is not a multiple of 4, it will report an error.\n</li>\n</ul>\n\n<div class=\"highlight js-code-highlight\">\n<pre class=\"highlight javascript\"><code><span class=\"nf\">btoa</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"dl\">'</span><span class=\"s1\">you</span><span class=\"dl\">'</span><span class=\"p\">)</span> <span class=\"c1\">// 'eW91'</span>\n<span class=\"nf\">atob</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"dl\">'</span><span class=\"s1\">eW91</span><span class=\"dl\">'</span><span class=\"p\">)</span> <span class=\"c1\">// 'you'</span>\n<span class=\"nf\">btoa</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"dl\">'</span><span class=\"s1\">馬鹿</span><span class=\"dl\">'</span><span class=\"p\">)</span> <span class=\"c1\">// Uncaught DOMException: The string to be encoded contains characters outside of the Latin1 range.</span>\n<span class=\"nf\">atob</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"dl\">'</span><span class=\"s1\">y</span><span class=\"dl\">'</span><span class=\"p\">)</span> <span class=\"c1\">// Uncaught DOMException: The string to be decoded is not correctly encoded.</span>\n</code></pre>\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<h3>\n  \n  \n  Handling Japanese Characters\n</h3>\n\n<p>Since <code>btoa</code> and <code>atob</code> only support encoding ASCII characters, that is, single - byte characters, and Japanese characters we usually encounter are 2 - 4 - byte characters. Therefore, Japanese characters can be first converted into UTF - 8 encoding, and the UTF - 8 encoding is regarded as a character, so that multiple single - byte characters can be encoded. For Japanese, two methods can be used: <code>encodeURIComponent()</code> and <code>decodeURIComponent()</code>.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>\n<code>encodeURIComponent()</code>: Encodes non - ACSII characters into UTF - 8.</li>\n<li>\n<code>decodeURIComponent()</code>: Used for decoding.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The following is the way to encode and decode Japanese:<br>\n</p>\n\n<div class=\"highlight js-code-highlight\">\n<pre class=\"highlight javascript\"><code><span class=\"nb\">window</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nf\">btoa</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nf\">encodeURIComponent</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"dl\">'</span><span class=\"s1\">馬鹿</span><span class=\"dl\">'</span><span class=\"p\">))</span>\n<span class=\"c1\">// 'JUU5JUE2JUFDJUU5JUI5JUJG'</span>\n<span class=\"nf\">decodeURIComponent</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nb\">window</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nf\">atob</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"dl\">'</span><span class=\"s1\">JUU5JUE2JUFDJUU5JUI5JUJG</span><span class=\"dl\">'</span><span class=\"p\">))</span>\n<span class=\"c1\">// '馬鹿'</span>\n</code></pre>\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<h3>\n  \n  \n  Third - Party Libraries\n</h3>\n\n<p>For example, <code>js - base64</code>. In front - end development, we can also use such third - party libraries to more conveniently handle Base64 - related operations.</p>\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  Common Front - end Applications\n</h2>\n\n<p>Next, let's take a look at some common usage scenarios of Base64 encoding in front - end development. Most of the applications of Base64 in the front - end are for image processing, generally based on the DataURL method. A Data URL consists of four parts: a <code>data:</code> prefix, a MIME type (indicating the data type), a <code>base64</code> flag (optional if it is text), and the data itself. The specific format is: <code>data:[&lt;mime type&gt;][;base64],&lt;data&gt;</code>. The fourth part <code>&lt;data&gt;</code> here, the data itself, is a Base64 string.</p>\n\n<h3>\n  \n  \n  Small Image Transcoding\n</h3>\n\n<p>That is, the scenario of using Base64 to reduce the number of requests for image optimization mentioned at the beginning. It can be used under the <code>img</code> tag or in <code>css</code>:<br>\n</p>\n\n<div class=\"highlight js-code-highlight\">\n<pre class=\"highlight html\"><code><span class=\"nt\">&lt;img</span> <span class=\"na\">src=</span><span class=\"s\">\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0c......Ii8+PC9nPjwvc3ZnPg==\"</span><span class=\"nt\">&gt;</span>\n</code></pre>\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"highlight js-code-highlight\">\n<pre class=\"highlight css\"><code><span class=\"nc\">.icon</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span>\n  <span class=\"nl\">background</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"sx\">url(data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0c......Ii8+PC9nPjwvc3ZnPg==)</span><span class=\"p\">;</span>\n<span class=\"p\">}</span>\n</code></pre>\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>When using Vue or React frameworks, we can also configure through <code>url - loader</code> to set the size of icons to be converted to Base64:<br>\n</p>\n\n<div class=\"highlight js-code-highlight\">\n<pre class=\"highlight javascript\"><code><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nf\">loader</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"dl\">'</span><span class=\"s1\">url - loader</span><span class=\"dl\">'</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n<span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nf\">tap</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nx\">options</span> <span class=\"o\">=&gt;</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span>\n  <span class=\"nx\">options</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nx\">limit</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"mi\">10240</span> <span class=\"c1\">// 10kb</span>\n  <span class=\"k\">return</span> <span class=\"nx\">options</span>\n<span class=\"p\">})</span>\n</code></pre>\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<h3>\n  \n  \n  File Reading\n</h3>\n\n<p>In the Web environment, the <code>FileReader</code> API is provided to read the data of files.

Let's consider data stored in a list, for example. Once we close the program, all the data in the List is lost. </p>\n\n<p>With file io, we can read from, that is, load data from a file or write to, that is, save data into a file, ensuring that data persists even after ending the program.</p>\n\n<h3>\n  \n  \n  The advantages of file I/O\n</h3>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Simple and easy to understand hence, it can be used by both experienced and junior developer</li>\n<li>It supports various file formats therefore. It provides flexibility in working with different file formats.</li>\n<li>Python provides many built-in functions for file I/O, hence reducing the need for using external libraries, which are not reliable sometimes.</li>\n<li>Python file I/O provides functionality for error handling.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>\n  \n  \n  Disadvantages of file I/O\n</h3>\n\n<ul>\n<li>It does not provide perform well for large files compared to low-level languages like C and C#. </li>\n<li>It consumes memory space, which can lead to memory issues in memory-constrained environments.</li>\n<li>Python file I/O has limited concurrency hence, it is less suitable for highly parallel tasks.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>\n  \n  \n  Practical uses of file I/O in Python\n</h3>\n\n<p>File I/O is fundamental for storing and retrieving data in applications and databases. It's used in automating tasks such as report generation and data transformation in big data.</p>\n\n<p>Additionally, it's used when handling downloads and uploads in web development.</p>\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  File modes\n</h2>\n\n<p>File modes are used to perform different tasks, such as reading and appending files. Here are some of the common modes:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>\n<code>'+'</code>: Update mode.Used to open a file for both reading and writing.</li>\n<li>\n<code>'a'</code>: Append mode. Opens the file for appending.</li>\n<li>\n<code>'b'</code>: Binary mode. Used when dealing with files in the binary mode.</li>\n<li>\n<code>'r'</code>: Read mode. Opens the file for reading.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  - <code>'w'</code>: Writing mode. Opens the file for writing.\n</h2>\n\n<h3>\n  \n  \n  Opening and writing files\n</h3>\n\n<p>The <code>open</code> function in Python is used to open a file in Python for reading or writing. Let's write a program that opens a file, allows the user to enter data, and finally saves.<br>\n</p>\n\n<div class=\"highlight js-code-highlight\">\n<pre class=\"highlight python\"><code><span class=\"n\">cars</span><span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"nf\">input</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"sh\">\"</span><span class=\"s\">what is the model of your car?</span><span class=\"sh\">\"</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n\n<span class=\"nb\">file</span><span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"nf\">open</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"sh\">'</span><span class=\"s\">cars.txt</span><span class=\"sh\">'</span><span class=\"p\">,</span><span class=\"sh\">'</span><span class=\"s\">w</span><span class=\"sh\">'</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n<span class=\"nb\">file</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nf\">write</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"sa\">f</span><span class=\"sh\">'</span><span class=\"si\">{</span><span class=\"n\">cars</span><span class=\"si\">}</span><span class=\"se\">\\n</span><span class=\"sh\">'</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n<span class=\"nb\">file</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nf\">close</span><span class=\"p\">()</span>\n</code></pre>\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>In the code above, we are declaring a variable called cars used to store the input of the car model.

The MedTech Talent website was conceived as a transformative online hub, designed to empower medical professionals with advanced training, career consulting, and interactive learning experiences. This article provides a comprehensive narrative on how the website was created—from ideation and planning through design, development, and deployment—emphasizing the integration of powerful programming languages and cutting-edge web technologies.</p>\n\n<p>At its core, the website’s objective is to offer an engaging, intuitive, and secure platform where users can access courses in Pharmacovigilance, Drug Safety, Clinical Research, and Medical Device Safety, among other topics. By blending innovative pedagogy with modern web development techniques, the creators of <strong><a href=\"https://medtechtalents.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">MedTech Talent</a></strong> set out to build not just another online course portal, but a community-driven ecosystem that drives professional excellence in the pharmaceutical sector.</p>\n\n<p>The Planning Phase: Laying the Foundation</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Market Research and Conceptualization\nEvery successful project begins with understanding the market landscape. Before any lines of code were written, the team behind MedTech Talent conducted extensive market research. They assessed the needs of pharmaceutical professionals, analyzed competitor platforms, and identified unique value propositions that could set their platform apart. The result was a clear mission statement: to provide a comprehensive, interactive, and future-proof learning environment that caters specifically to the evolving needs of medtech professionals.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Key steps in the planning phase included:</p>\n\n<p>Stakeholder Interviews: Engaging with industry experts, educators, and potential users to gather insights.<br>\nUser Persona Development: Crafting detailed personas representing different segments of the pharmaceutical community—doctors, researchers, pharmacists, and nurses—to ensure that the platform’s features and design were aligned with real-world needs.<br>\nFeature Prioritization: Identifying core functionalities such as course enrollment, interactive test-to-learn modules, video lessons, and integrated educational tools. The team used agile methodologies to prioritize features based on impact and feasibility.<br>\nTechnology Stack Evaluation: Early discussions centered around choosing the right programming languages and frameworks. While web technologies like HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript were obvious choices for front-end development, the decision to incorporate languages like C++, Java, and Python was driven by the need for performance optimization, enterprise-level scalability, and data-driven analytics.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Defining Objectives and KPIs\nThe planning phase also involved setting clear objectives and key performance indicators (KPIs) that would serve as benchmarks for success. These included:</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>User Engagement Metrics: Average session duration, course completion rates, and interactive tool usage.<br>\nPerformance Benchmarks: Page load times, server response times, and scalability under heavy user loads.<br>\nSecurity and Compliance: Ensuring that the platform met data protection regulations and industry-specific compliance standards.<br>\nLearning Outcomes: Monitoring improvements in professional competencies among users, which would be measured through pre- and post-course assessments.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Architectural Blueprint and System Design\nAn architectural blueprint was crafted to outline how various components of the platform would interact. This blueprint included:</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Modular Architecture: The platform was designed using a microservices architecture, enabling independent deployment and scaling of different components such as user authentication, course management, and analytics.<br>\nService-Oriented Approach: Critical backend services were developed in Java to leverage its robust ecosystem and enterprise capabilities, particularly for handling transactional data and complex business logic.<br>\nHigh-Performance Modules: Certain computationally intensive tasks, such as real-time analytics and interactive simulation modules, were implemented in C++ to ensure optimal performance.<br>\nData Processing and Machine Learning: Python was selected for its extensive libraries and frameworks (e.g., Pandas, NumPy, TensorFlow) to power data analytics, recommendation systems, and adaptive learning algorithms.<br>\nBy establishing a clear plan, the MedTech Talent team set a strong foundation that would guide the subsequent phases of design and development.</p>\n\n<p>The Design Phase: Marrying Functionality with Aesthetics</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>User Experience (UX) Strategy\nDesigning a platform for a specialized audience meant that the user experience needed to be both intuitive and engaging. The design phase began with a focus on understanding user workflows and expectations:</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Wireframing and Prototyping: The team used tools like Sketch and Figma to create wireframes, which provided a visual representation of the website’s structure. Multiple prototypes were iterated upon, incorporating feedback from potential users to ensure that navigation was clear and interactions were smooth.<br>\nInformation Architecture: The content was organized into clearly defined sections such as Courses, Career Consulting, and Educational Tools. Each section was designed to be easily accessible, with logical pathways guiding users from high-level overviews to detailed content.<br>\nAccessibility: With a diverse user base that included professionals of varying technical abilities, the design prioritized accessibility. This included considerations for color contrast, text size, and keyboard navigation, ensuring that the website was usable by all.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Visual Design and Branding\nVisual identity is a critical aspect of any web platform, and MedTech Talent was no exception. The visual design phase involved:</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Brand Identity: The creators established a modern yet professional aesthetic, blending clean lines with dynamic elements to evoke a sense of innovation and expertise. The color palette was chosen to be both calming and authoritative—blues and grays paired with energetic accent colors.<br>\nResponsive Design: With mobile usage on the rise, a mobile-first design approach was adopted. This ensured that the website was fully responsive, providing an optimal viewing experience across desktops, tablets, and smartphones.<br>\nInteractive Elements: Given the platform’s emphasis on a test-to-learn approach, interactive elements such as quizzes, mind maps, and real-time feedback modules were seamlessly integrated into the design. Animations and micro-interactions were used sparingly to enhance user engagement without overwhelming the experience.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>UX Research and User Testing\nBefore finalizing the design, the team conducted extensive usability testing:</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>A/B Testing: Different versions of the user interface were tested with target groups. Feedback was collected on navigation ease, content readability, and overall engagement.<br>\nFocus Groups: Small focus groups consisting of medtech professionals provided qualitative insights, ensuring that the design was both technically robust and intuitively navigable.<br>\nIterative Refinement: Insights from usability tests were fed back into the design process, leading to refinements in layout, typography, and interactive elements.<br>\nThe result was a design that balanced technical sophistication with user-centric simplicity—an essential foundation for the website’s success.</p>\n\n<p>The Development Phase: Turning Vision into Reality</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Front-End Development\nThe front-end of MedTech Talent was built to be both visually appealing and highly responsive. The development team leveraged a modern tech stack:</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript: These core technologies were used to create a dynamic and responsive interface.

Basically, it means that each virtual environment has its own set of dependencies to third-party packages usually installed from <a href=\"https://pypi.org\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">PyPI</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Virtual environments are helpful if you develop multiple Python projects on the same machine. Also, when you distribute your Python code to others or on servers, virtual environments come in very handy to reproducibly create the same environment as on your development machine.</p>\n\n<p>Today, we'll learn</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>which tools exist to create isolated environments</li>\n<li>which tools help with package management in Python projects</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  Getting Started\n</h2>\n\n<h3>\n  \n  \n  What is <code>uv</code>?\n</h3>\n\n<p>Over the past years, Python developers have used <code>venv</code> and <code>pip</code> to create virtual environments and manage packages. However, <code>uv</code> is a new tool that combines the best of both worlds: virtual environments and package management. It is a modern tool that helps you to create isolated environments and manage packages in your Python projects. It is written in Rust and maintained by <a href=\"https://astral.dev\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Astral</a>.</p>\n\n<h3>\n  \n  \n  Installing <code>uv</code>\n</h3>\n\n<p>Installing <code>uv</code> is straightforward. It is even published on <a href=\"https://pypi.org/project/uv/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">PyPI</a>, so you can install it with <code>pip</code>:<br>\n</p>\n\n<div class=\"highlight js-code-highlight\">\n<pre class=\"highlight shell\"><code>pip <span class=\"nb\">install </span>uv\n</code></pre>\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>For more information about different installation methods, check out the <a href=\"https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">official documentation</a>.</p>\n\n<h3>\n  \n  \n  Initializing a project\n</h3>\n\n<p><code>uv</code> has an <code>init</code> command that will create a new Python project with a <code>pyproject.toml</code> file as well as a <code>.gitignore</code> file, a <code>README.md</code>, and a <code>hello.py</code>.<br>\n</p>\n\n<div class=\"highlight js-code-highlight\">\n<pre class=\"highlight shell\"><code>uv init my-test-project\n</code></pre>\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<h3>\n  \n  \n  Managing Python Versions\n</h3>\n\n<p>Other than the classic <code>pip</code>, <code>uv</code> manages versions of the Python interpreter for you.</p>\n\n<p>With<br>\n</p>\n\n<div class=\"highlight js-code-highlight\">\n<pre class=\"highlight shell\"><code>uv python list\n</code></pre>\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>you get a list of all available Python versions on your system. Installing other versions is as simple as<br>\n</p>\n\n<div class=\"highlight js-code-highlight\">\n<pre class=\"highlight shell\"><code>uv python <span class=\"nb\">install </span>3.10.0\n</code></pre>\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<h3>\n  \n  \n  Managing Dependencies\n</h3>\n\n<p><code>uv</code> uses a <code>pyproject.toml</code> file to manage dependencies. You can add dependencies with<br>\n</p>\n\n<div class=\"highlight js-code-highlight\">\n<pre class=\"highlight shell\"><code>uv add requests\n</code></pre>\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>The package names are the same as on PyPI.</p>\n\n<p>With <code>uv lock</code>, you can create a <code>Lockfile</code> that holds all dependencies and their versions. This file can be used to install the exact same versions on other machines.</p>\n\n<h3>\n  \n  \n  <code>uv sync</code>\n</h3>\n\n<p><code>uv sync</code> is a command that installs all dependencies from the <code>pyproject.toml</code> file. It is similar to <code>pip install -r requirements.txt</code>.</p>\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  Ad-hoc environments\n</h2>\n\n<p>One of the killer features of <code>uv</code> is the ability to create ad-hoc environments. This means that you can create a new environment with a single command and run a Python script in it.</p>\n\n<p>Let's say, we want a project in Python 3.10 with the <code>requests</code> package. We can create a new environment with</p>\n\n<p>Using <code>pyenv</code> and <code>pip</code>, we would have to create a new virtual environment, activate it, and install the package:<br>\n</p>\n\n<div class=\"highlight js-code-highlight\">\n<pre class=\"highlight shell\"><code>pyenv <span class=\"nb\">install </span>3.10\npyenv <span class=\"nb\">local </span>3.10\npython <span class=\"nt\">-m</span> venv .venv\n<span class=\"nb\">source</span> .venv/bin/activate\npip <span class=\"nb\">install </span>requests\npython hello.py\n</code></pre>\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>Using <code>uv</code>, this can be done with a single command:<br>\n</p>\n\n<div class=\"highlight js-code-highlight\">\n<pre class=\"highlight shell\"><code>uv run <span class=\"nt\">--python</span> 3.10 <span class=\"nt\">--with</span> requests python hello.py\n</code></pre>\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  Conclusion\n</h2>\n\n<p><code>uv</code> is a modern tool that combines the best of both worlds: virtual environments and package management. It is a great tool to manage dependencies in your Python projects.

This approach keeps sensitive data secure.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Creating the Email Message:</strong><br><br>\nAn <code>EmailMessage</code> object is created, with both plain text and HTML versions of the email. This ensures that the email displays well in all clients.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Sending the Email:</strong><br><br>\nThe script connects securely to the SMTP server using TLS, logs in with your credentials, and sends the email.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n\n<h3>\n  \n  \n  Step 4: Automate the Script\n</h3>\n\n<p>To automate your invoice reminders:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Schedule with Cron (Linux/macOS):</strong>\nOpen your crontab with <code>crontab -e</code> and add a line like:\n</li>\n</ul>\n\n<div class=\"highlight js-code-highlight\">\n<pre class=\"highlight plaintext\"><code>  0 9 * * * /usr/bin/python3 /path/to/invoice_reminder.py\n</code></pre>\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>This runs the script every day at 9 AM.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Windows Task Scheduler:</strong>\nCreate a new task to run the Python script on your desired schedule.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  Enhancements and Next Steps\n</h2>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>Bulk Processing:</strong><br><br>\nInstead of sending a single email, modify the script to read invoice data from a CSV file or database. Loop through each record and call <code>send_invoice_reminder()</code> for each invoice.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>API Integration:</strong><br><br>\nIf Credit-IQ offers an API, you can extend this script to pull live invoice data directly from your AR system, ensuring reminders are always up-to-date.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Error Handling and Logging:</strong><br><br>\nAdd robust error handling to manage failed email sends and log results for audit purposes.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  Conclusion\n</h2>\n\n<p>By automating your invoice reminder process with Python, you free up valuable time and reduce the manual workload of chasing payments—allowing your team to focus on growth and strategy. With Credit-IQ’s focus on automating and centralizing accounts receivable, integrating a custom script like this can further optimize your cash flow management.</p>\n\n<p>Try out this script, customize it to fit your needs, and join the movement toward smarter, more <a href=\"https://www.credit-iq.com\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">efficient AR processes</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Happy coding and smoother collections!</p>\n\n","contentLength":0,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Fast Data Entry: Automating Data Entry for Efficiency","url":"https://dev.to/roopkumar/fast-data-entry-automating-data-entry-for-efficiency-5h2n","date":1739784537,"author":"Roopkumar Das","guid":1717,"unread":true,"content":"<h2>\n  \n  \n  Introduction\n</h2>\n\n<p>Data entry is a crucial but often time-consuming task. Instead of manually entering data into Excel, we can use <strong>Python and Pandas</strong> to speed up the process significantly. While some basic Python knowledge is required, don't worry—most of it is just plain English reasoning.</p>\n\n<p>In this blog, we'll explore different methods of data entry based on the format of the source data, such as <strong>physical documents, images, PDFs</strong>, and more.</p>\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  Methods of Data Entry\n</h2>\n\n<p>There are two main approaches to data entry:</p>\n\n<h3>\n  \n  \n  1. Automated Data Entry: Using OCR &amp; Pandas in Python\n</h3>\n\n<p>If the data is in <strong>image or scanned document format</strong>, we can extract text using <strong>OCR (Optical Character Recognition)</strong> and process it with <strong>Pandas</strong>.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Example: Extracting Data from an Image</strong></p>\n\n<p>We'll use the <strong>EasyOCR</strong> library to extract text from an image file.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fc2zd471na8z26xogfez7.png\" class=\"article-body-image-wrapper\"><img src=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fc2zd471na8z26xogfez7.png\" alt=\"small_business_loan.png\" width=\"677\" height=\"245\"></a><br>\n</p>\n\n<div class=\"highlight js-code-highlight\">\n<pre class=\"highlight python\"><code><span class=\"kn\">import</span> <span class=\"n\">easyocr</span>\n\n<span class=\"c1\"># Creating a reader that processes English text\n</span><span class=\"n\">reader</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"n\">easyocr</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nc\">Reader</span><span class=\"p\">([</span><span class=\"sh\">'</span><span class=\"s\">en</span><span class=\"sh\">'</span><span class=\"p\">])</span>\n\n<span class=\"c1\"># Reading text from the image\n</span><span class=\"n\">result</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"n\">reader</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nf\">readtext</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"sh\">'</span><span class=\"s\">small_business_loan.png</span><span class=\"sh\">'</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"n\">detail</span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"mi\">0</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n\n<span class=\"k\">for</span> <span class=\"n\">text</span> <span class=\"ow\">in</span> <span class=\"n\">result</span><span class=\"p\">:</span>\n    <span class=\"nf\">print</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">text</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n</code></pre>\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Output (Example OCR Result)</strong>:<br>\n</p>\n\n<div class=\"highlight js-code-highlight\">\n<pre class=\"highlight plaintext\"><code>Table B: Value of Small Business Loans Outstanding by Depository Lender Size, 2016 to 2020\nBillions of Dollars, Nominal\nPercentage Change,\nLenders by Total Asset Size\n...\n</code></pre>\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>As you can see, OCR might introduce <strong>errors</strong> in the extracted text. Rather than relying entirely on AI to correct it, a <strong>manual review and correction step</strong> is often necessary. Once corrected, we can save the text in a structured format like a <strong>CSV file</strong>.</p>\n\n<h4>\n  \n  \n  Converting OCR Output to a CSV File\n</h4>\n\n<p>Once we have a cleaned text file, we can structure it into a <strong>CSV format</strong> for easy import into Excel.<br>\n</p>\n\n<div class=\"highlight js-code-highlight\">\n<pre class=\"highlight python\"><code><span

If you're entering data row-wise (e.g., filling out a <strong>loan application form</strong>), Excel forces you to press <strong>Tab</strong> or <strong>Arrow keys</strong> to navigate between columns.</p>\n\n<p>A <strong>faster alternative</strong> is to enter data into a <strong>CSV file</strong> using only the keyboard. <strong>Commas</strong> (,) separate values, making it easier to stay focused without switching keys frequently.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Example: Small Business Loan Data in CSV Format</strong><br>\n</p>\n\n<div class=\"highlight js-code-highlight\">\n<pre class=\"highlight plaintext\"><code>Lenders by Total Asset Size,2016,2017,2018,2019,2020,Percentage Change (2019-2020)\nLess than $100 million,11.5,10.4,10,8.5,7.4,-13.4\n$100 million to $499.9 million,96,90.5,86.4,82.2,87.4,6.3\n$500 million to $999.9 million,52.8,55.6,54,51.9,70.7,36.1\n$1 billion to $9.9 billion,139.5,133,127,129.9,215.4,65.8\n$10 million to $49.9 billion,73.5,85.6,106.9,114.5,162,41.5\n$50 billion or more,240.5,243.7,248.2,257.4,352.4,36.9\n</code></pre>\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>This structured format allows for quick keyboard entry <strong>without mouse interaction</strong>.</p>\n\n<h4>\n  \n  \n  Converting CSV to Excel Using Python\n</h4>\n\n<p>Once the data is entered in CSV format, we can easily convert it into an <strong>Excel file</strong> using Pandas<br>\n</p>\n\n<div class=\"highlight js-code-highlight\">\n<pre class=\"highlight python\"><code><span class=\"kn\">import</span> <span class=\"n\">pandas</span> <span class=\"k\">as</span> <span class=\"n\">pd</span>\n\n<span class=\"n\">df</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"n\">pd</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nf\">read_csv</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"sh\">\"</span><span class=\"s\">small_business_loans.csv</span><span class=\"sh\">\"</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n<span class=\"n\">df</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nf\">to_excel</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"sh\">\"</span><span class=\"s\">small_business_loans.xlsx</span><span class=\"sh\">\"</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"n\">index</span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"bp\">False</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n</code></pre>\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  Conclusion: Choosing the Right Data Entry Method\n</h2>\n\n<p>To <strong>speed up data entry</strong>, choose the most efficient method based on your data format:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>If the data is in an image/PDF</strong> → Use <strong>OCR + Python</strong> for automation.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>If the data is already in text format</strong> → Convert it directly into <strong>CSV</strong>.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>If manual entry is necessary</strong> → Use <strong>CSV format</strong> instead of Excel to speed up typing.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>By using these techniques, you can <strong>automate and streamline data entry</strong>, saving <strong>time and effort</strong> while ensuring <strong>accuracy</strong>. 🚀</p>\n\n","contentLength":0,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Python OOP","url":"https://dev.to/anvo0000/python-oop-4b80","date":1739784188,"author":"An Vo","guid":1716,"unread":true,"content":"<p><u>I.

And that is because I do not see myself as a media guru, but many people do. I see myself as a student who has enjoyed learning within the media space for over a decade. From being a newsroom rat at Tribune Newspapers to the Ministry of Information in Ogun State, Complete Sports in Lagos, OOH firm in Abuja, Digital Ad agency, development media and BTL Marketing. Looks like I have seen it all, right? Enough of media, how did tech get into the story?</p>\n\n<p>Well, the tech industry is a rapidly growing one and it is almost a ubiquitous trade. This may explain why I met Sukanmi Fafowora, a corps member at my office. A calm, focused and very ambitious young man. A Computer science graduate from the University of Lagos and expectedly a programmer. In our short time of meeting, Sukanmi seems to have observed a few of my strengths and is mean about getting me to be better at it and perhaps try something new. I hope nobody has a problem with learning from someone younger. If you do, then you are missing a lot in life and about life.</p>\n\n<p>So, what did Sukanmi want me to do? He simply said, “Mr Moshood, I think you can be a technical writer, and you can earn more than you presently do after learning. Every tech skill requires a minimum of 6 months for the newbie to learn but I believe you can learn in 3 months. These words were enough for me to get into it. And I did.</p>\n\n<p>But at first, my understanding of technical writing was that is it a special kind of writing meant for a specific field of knowledge using jargon or lexicons peculiar to the field. But when Sukanmi sent me a handful of materials to read, I discovered I knew nothing about technical writing.</p>\n\n<p>In my discovery, I found that technical writing is about breaking down and explaining technical terms in software development and tech generally in a simpler, easy-to-understand language to the end user of these products. It includes product features, user guides or manuals, FAQs, and much more. I also found that there are two broad types of technical writing (there could be more). User-focus technical writing and Developer-focus technical writing. My readings summarised that I needed to understand programming to be a respected technical writer. This was an onion bulb for me. I didn’t see it coming.</p>\n\n<p>So, Sukanmi again suggested a few online resources to learn programming from. He advised that I go for Python, stating that it would give me an easy landing to learn as a newbie.</p>\n\n<p>To cut the story short, I have taken the first step on codecademy.com by learning the first module out of 13 modules. Learning to write codes using the # sign and parenthesis is interesting. I know there will be more challenges up front, and I can’t wait to deal with them over time.</p>\n\n<p>For now, the next move is to sign up for the 7-day free trial on codecademy.com and see if I can complete the course before the free trial expires. Meanwhile, this article is also an assignment from my tech mentor, Sukanmi Fafowora. And I want you to watch this space for my progress. I wish myself the best.</p>\n\n","contentLength":0,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Python Bytes: #420 90% Done in 50% of the Available Time","url":"https://pythonbytes.fm/episodes/show/420/90-done-in-50-of-the-available-time","date":1739779200,"author":"","guid":2169,"unread":true,"content":"<article>&lt;strong&gt;Topics covered in this episode:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n\t&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://peps.python.org/pep-0772/?featured_on=pythonbytes\"&gt;PEP 772 – Packaging governance process&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.mongodb.com/blog/post/mongodb-django-backend-now-available-public-preview?utm_source=www.pythonweekly.com&amp;utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=python-weekly-issue-687-february-13-2025&amp;_bhlid=ac970bf5150af48b53b11f639dd520db04c9a2aa&amp;featured_on=pythonbytes\"&gt;Official Django MongoDB Backend&lt;/a&gt; Now Available in Public Preview&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://qntm.org/devphilo?featured_on=pythonbytes\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Developer Philosophy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://docs.python.org/release/3.13.2/whatsnew/changelog.html#python-3-13-2\"&gt;Python 3.13.2&lt;/a&gt; released&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Extras&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Joke&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n\n&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW4mZ3XNfY8' style='font-weight: bold;'data-umami-event=\"Livestream-Past\" data-umami-event-episode=\"420\"&gt;Watch on YouTube&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About the show&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sponsored by us!

Developers can use Django &lt;a href=\"https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.1/topics/db/models/?featured_on=pythonbytes\"&gt;models&lt;/a&gt; to represent MongoDB documents, with support for Django forms, validations, and authentication.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Django admin support&lt;/strong&gt;. The package allows users to fire up the Django admin page as they normally would, with full support for &lt;a href=\"https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.1/topics/migrations/#module-django.db.migrations\"&gt;migrations&lt;/a&gt; and database schema history.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Native connecting from settings.py&lt;/strong&gt;. Just as with any other database provider, developers can customize the database engine in settings.py to get MongoDB up and running.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MongoDB-specific querying optimizations&lt;/strong&gt;. Field lookups have been replaced with aggregation calls (aggregation stages and aggregate operators), JOIN operations are represented through $lookup, and it’s possible to build indexes right from Python.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Limited advanced functionality&lt;/strong&gt;. While still in development, the package already has support for time series, projections, and XOR operations.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Aggregation pipeline support&lt;/strong&gt;. Raw querying allows aggregation pipeline operators. Since aggregation is a superset of what traditional MongoDB Query API methods provide, it gives developers more functionality.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brian #3:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=\"https://qntm.org/devphilo?featured_on=pythonbytes\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Developer Philosophy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;by qntm&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Intended as “advice for junior developers about personal dev philosophy”, I think these are just great tips to keep in mind.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The items\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Avoid, at all costs, arriving at a scenario where the ground-up rewrite starts to look attractive\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;This is less about “don’t do rewrites”, but about noticing the warning signs ahead of time.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Aim to be 90% done in 50% of the available time\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Great quote: “The first 90% of the job takes 90% of the time.

Documenting and testing what you think of as the happy path is a testing start and helps others understand your idea of how things are supposed to work.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;There’s usually a simpler way to write it&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Write code to be testable&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;It is insufficient for code to be provably correct; it should be obviously, visibly, trivially correct\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Brian’s note: Even if it’s obviously, visibly, trivially correct, it will still break. So test it anyway.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Michael #4:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=\"https://docs.python.org/release/3.13.2/whatsnew/changelog.html#python-3-13-2\"&gt;Python 3.13.2&lt;/a&gt; released&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Python 3.13’s second maintenance release. &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;About 250 changes went into this update&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Also Python 3.12.9, Python 3.12’s ninth maintenance release already.

audience. BrushinBella, a company dedicated to providing innovative and thoughtfully designed baby and feeding products, recognized that their website needed to embody the values of care, creativity, and reliability. The goal was to create an engaging, easy‑to‑navigate e‑commerce platform that not only showcased their products but also helped parents seamlessly integrate these solutions into their busy lives.</p>\n\n<p>This article recounts the comprehensive journey behind the creation of the <a href=\"https://www.brushinbella.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Brush in Bella</a> website, from the initial planning and design phases to the intricate development work that involved custom integrations using C++, Java, and Python. We will explore the challenges encountered along the way, the solutions that were implemented, and share expert insights on current trends and best practices in web development.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>The Vision and Planning Phase\n1.1.

Saving and Recreating the Virtual Environment with <code>requirements.txt</code>\n</h2>\n\n<p>To save the list of installed packages in the virtual environment, use:<br>\n</p>\n\n<div class=\"highlight js-code-highlight\">\n<pre class=\"highlight plaintext\"><code>pip freeze &gt; requirements.txt\n</code></pre>\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>To recreate the same environment on another system:<br>\n</p>\n\n<div class=\"highlight js-code-highlight\">\n<pre class=\"highlight plaintext\"><code>pip install -r requirements.txt\n</code></pre>\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  5. Conclusion\n</h2>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Virtualenv helps you run Python projects in an isolated and conflict-free manner.</p></li>\n<li><p>You can install it with pip install virtualenv.</p></li>\n<li><p>Create and activate a virtual environment with venv.</p></li>\n<li><p>Use requirements.txt to store and restore dependencies.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Thanks for reading❤️<br>\nI hope this guide helps you understand and use virtual environments effectively.

for automated web crawling, it is often detected and blocked by the target website. This is usually because Selenium's automation features are more obvious and can be easily identified by the website's anti-crawler mechanism. This article will explore in depth how to deal with the problem of Selenium crawler being detected, including methods such as hiding automation features and using proxy IPs, and provide specific code examples. At the same time, 98IP proxy will be briefly mentioned as one of the solutions.</p>\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  I. Reasons for Selenium crawlers being detected\n</h2>\n\n<h3>\n  \n  \n  1.1 Obvious automation features\n</h3>\n\n<p>Selenium's default browser behavior is significantly different from manual user operations, such as specific fields in the request header, fixed browser window size, uniform operation speed, etc., which may be used by websites to identify automated scripts.</p>\n\n<h3>\n  \n  \n  1.2 Frequent request frequency\n</h3>\n\n<p>Crawlers usually send requests at a frequency much higher than normal users, which can also easily alert websites.</p>\n\n<h3>\n  \n  \n  1.3 Fixed IP address\n</h3>\n\n<p>If the crawler always sends requests from the same IP address, the IP address will soon be blacklisted by the website.</p>\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  II.

Summary and Outlook\n</h2>\n\n<p>It is a common problem for Selenium crawlers to be detected, but by hiding automation features, using proxy IPs, controlling request frequency, etc., we can effectively reduce the risk of being detected. In particular, using high-quality proxy services such as 98IP Proxy can significantly improve the stability and success rate of crawlers.</p>\n\n<p>In the future, with the continuous advancement of website anti-crawler technology, we also need to continuously update and improve crawler strategies. For example, introducing more complex browser simulation technology, using machine learning to predict and circumvent blocking strategies, etc. are all directions worth exploring.</p>\n\n<p>In short, dealing with the problem of Selenium crawlers being detected requires comprehensive consideration of multiple factors and taking corresponding measures.</p>\n\n","contentLength":0,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Writing Pythonic Code With Python Data Model","url":"https://dev.to/noble47/writing-pythonic-code-with-python-data-model-2j3o","date":1739751292,"author":"Noble-47","guid":847,"unread":true,"content":"<h2>\n  \n  \n  <strong>Special Methods</strong>\n</h2>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>This apparent oddity is the tip of an iceberg that, when properly understood, is the key to everything we call Pythonic. The iceberg is called the Python data model, and it describes the API that you can use to make your own objects play well with the most idiomatic language features.</em> - Luciano Ramalho (Fluent Python: clear, concise, and effective programming)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>What's so special about the Python data model one may ask. Rather than giving a personal answer, why don't we do a little dive in and see what we can accomplish by understanding the data model. Data model simply speaks about how data is represented. In Python, data is represented by objects or to sound a bit technical, objects are Python's abstraction for data. The data model provides us with an API that allows our objects to play well with the 'under the hood' of Python programming.</p>\n\n<p>In our little dive into Python data model, we are going to specifically focus on the special methods. Special methods are class functions with special names that are invoked by special syntax. Defining these special methods in our class definitions can give our class instances some really cool Python powers like iteration, operator overloading, working well with context managers (the 'with' keyword), proper string representation and formatting, and many more. To show you how you could implement these special functions into your classes, we will consider two examples of situations where using these special functions would make our codes clearer and more Pythonic.</p>\n\n<p><em>The first example is a little bit outside-the-box solution I came up with for creating a simple game of Rock-Paper-Scissors in Python and the second is going to be a bit mathematical in nature but I'm going to walk you through each line of code</em></p>\n\n<h3>\n  \n  \n  <strong>A Simple Game Of Rock Paper Scissors</strong>\n</h3>\n\n<p>Just in case you are not familiar with the Rock-Paper-Scissors game, it is originally a hand game usually played among two people that involves making signs of either Rock or paper or scissors. Knowing the whole history of the game doesn't really matter what is important is knowing how to determine the winner. In a conventional setting, a hand sign of rock would always win against scissors but will lose against paper, a hand sign of scissors would win against paper and lose to rock and obviously, paper would lose to scissors and win against rock. we can summarize this as shown below</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2F52xdy54sjsum25wtqk2c.png\" class=\"article-body-image-wrapper\"><img src=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2F52xdy54sjsum25wtqk2c.png\" alt=\"Image of rock, paper, scissors game\" width=\"460\" height=\"440\"></a></p>\n\n<p>For our Python emulation of this game, we will limit the number of players to just two, one player would be the computer and the other would be the user. Also, this is not a machine learning article or a write-up about computer vision, our users would still have to type in an option between rock, paper, and scissors on the terminal for our program to work.<br>\nBefore we go into the actual coding, it's good that we take a step back and consider how we want our Python script to be. For my solution to this challenge, I will use the random module to enable the computer select a random option of either rock, paper, or scissors. To implement how our code evaluates the winner, I'm going to make the following assumptions:</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"ltag_gist-liquid-tag\">\n  \n</div>\n\n\n<p>I'm also going to take an OOP approach; our rock, paper, and scissors will be treated as objects and not string variables. Rather than creating three separate classes for each, I'll create only one that can represent any of them. This approach would also allow me to show you how special methods make life easier. Now to the fun aspect!</p>\n\n<h4>\n  \n  \n  <strong>Class Definition</strong>\n</h4>\n\n\n<div class=\"ltag_gist-liquid-tag\">\n  \n</div>\n\n\n<p>Naming our class RPS may sound a bit odd, but I found the name 'RPS' to be a good fit cause each letter comes from the initials, R for Rock, P for Paper, and S for Scissors. What's important to note here is that creating an instance of our class requires two arguments: pick and name. We already stated that the users of our script would have to type in their selected option on the terminal, instead of making our users type in 'Paper' (which could be so stressful for them) why don't we just allow our user to type in 'P' (or 'p') to select 'Paper', that's what the pick stands for. The name property is the actual name e.g 'Paper'. So now that we know what each parameters is for, we can now inspect our class by creating an instance<br>\n</p>\n\n<div class=\"highlight js-code-highlight\">\n<pre class=\"highlight plaintext\"><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; p = RPS('P', 'Paper') # create an instance\n&gt;&gt;&gt; p.name\n# return : Paper\n&gt;&gt;&gt; p.pick\n# return : P\n&gt;&gt;&gt; print(p)\n# return : &lt;__main__.RPS object at 0x...&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n</div>\n\n\n<p>Our class instance was created and has the right attributes but notice what we get when we try to print the contents of the variable holding our class instance. Before getting into the technical details of how our class instance returns the odd-looking string, let's update our class definition by adding a single special function and see the difference.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"ltag_gist-liquid-tag\">\n  \n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>Now let's create an instance and try printing our class instance again<br>\n</p>\n\n<div class=\"highlight js-code-highlight\">\n<pre class=\"highlight plaintext\"><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; p = RPS('P', 'Paper')\n&gt;&gt;&gt; print(p)\n# return : RPS(P, Paper)\n</code></pre>\n\n</div>\n\n\n<p>As we can see, by defining the '<strong>repr</strong>' method we can achieve a better looking result. Let's make one more change to our class definition.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"ltag_gist-liquid-tag\">\n  \n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>Now let's create an instance and test it again.<br>\n</p>\n\n<div class=\"highlight js-code-highlight\">\n<pre class=\"highlight plaintext\"><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; p = RPS('P', 'Paper')\n&gt;&gt;&gt; p\n# return : RPS(P, Paper)\n&gt;&gt;&gt; print(p)\n# return : Paper\n&gt;&gt;&gt; str(p)\n# return : 'Paper'\n&gt;&gt;&gt; repr(p)\n# return : 'RPS(P, Paper)'\n</code></pre>\n\n</div>\n\n\n<p>To know what's going on here, we need to know a little about the print function. The print function converts all non-keyword arguments(like our p variable) to string using the built-in Python class <code>str</code>. If calling <code>str()</code> on our variable fails, python falls back on the built-in <code>repr</code> function. When <code>str</code> is called on our object, it looks for a <code>__str__</code> method, if it finds none, it fails and then searches for a <code>__repr__</code> method. Both the <code>__str__</code> and the <code>__repr__</code> methods are special methods used for string representation of our object. The <code>__repr__</code> method gives the official string representation of our object while the <code>__str__</code> method gives a friendly string representation of our object. I usually say that the <code>__repr__</code> method is like talking to another developer and it usually shows how to call our class and the <code>__str__</code> is like talking to a user of our program (like the player in this case), you would usually just want to return a simple string like \"Paper\" to show the user what he picked.</p>\n\n<p>Although I stated the <code>__repr__</code> and <code>__str__</code> as the two special functions in our class definition, there's actually a third special method, and yes it is the most common one, the <code>__init__</code> function. It is used for initializing our class and called by the <code>__new__</code> special method just before returning our class instance. Did I just mention another special method we haven't defined? yes, I did. It may also interest you to know that Python automatically adds some other special methods to our class. You can check them out by calling the built-in function <code>dir</code> on our class instance like this<br>\n</p>\n<div class=\"highlight js-code-highlight\">\n<pre class=\"highlight plaintext\"><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; dir(p)\n# returns : ['__class__', '__delattr__', '__dict__', '__dir__', '__doc__', '__eq__', '__format__', '__ge__', '__getattribute__', '__gt__', '__hash__', '__init__', '__init_subclass__', '__le__', '__lt__', '__module__', '__ne__', '__new__', '__reduce__', '__reduce_ex__', '__repr__', '__setattr__', '__sizeof__', '__str__', '__subclasshook__', '__weakref__', 'name', 'pick']\n</code></pre>\n\n</div>\n\n\n<p>Special functions or methods can be identified by the way they are named, they always begin with double underscores '<strong>' and end with double underscores '</strong>' Because of this special way of naming these methods, they are commonly called daunder methods (Double + UNDERscores = DUNDER). So if a method name begins with double underscores, it is most likely but not certainly a special method. Why not certainly? this is simply because Python does not stop us from defining our own methods using the dunder syntax. Alright back to our game script.</p>\n\n<p>All that's left for us now is for us to let our script know how to determine a winner. As stated earlier, I will use comparison to evaluate a winner.<br>\n</p>\n<div class=\"highlight js-code-highlight\">\n<pre class=\"highlight plaintext\"><code># comparison logic\nRock &gt; Scissors\nScissors &gt; Paper\nPaper &gt; Rock\n</code></pre>\n\n</div>\n\n\n<p>To implement this solution, I will add a dictionary and use the daunder greater_than method. The dictionary key would be the initials of Rock, Paper and Scissors. The value of each key would be the only other element that the key can defeat.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"ltag_gist-liquid-tag\">\n  \n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>Notice the new lines of code, first the options dictionary and then the <code>__gt__</code> method definition. With these new lines of code, let's see what new functionality our code now has.<br>\n</p>\n\n<div class=\"highlight js-code-highlight\">\n<pre class=\"highlight plaintext\"><code># create a rock instance\n&gt;&gt;&gt; r = RPS('R', 'Rock')\n\n# create a paper instance\n&gt;&gt;&gt; p = RPS('P', 'Paper')\n\n# create a scissors instance\n&gt;&gt;&gt; s = RPS('S', 'Scissors')\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt; print(r,p,s)\n# return : Rock Paper Scissors\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt; p &gt; r # paper wins against rock\n# return : True\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt; r &gt; s # rock wins against scissors\n# return : True\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt; s &gt; p # scissors wins against paper\n# return : True\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt; p &lt; s # paper lose to scissors\n# return : True\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt; p &lt; r # paper lose to rock\n# return : False\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt; p &lt; s &lt; r# paper lose to scissors which lose to rock\n# return : True\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt; p &gt;= r paper wins or tie to rock\n# return : Traceback (most recent call last): \n  File \"&lt;stdin&gt;\", line 1, in &lt;module&gt; \nTypeError: '&gt;=' not supported between instances of 'RPS' and 'RPS'\n</code></pre>\n\n</div>\n\n\n<p>Just by adding to <code>__gt__</code> special method, our class instances have gained magical powers (daunder methods are sometimes called magic methods and we can see why). By implementing the daunder gt method, our class instance now relates well with the <code>&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;</code> symbols but not the <code>≥</code> and <code>≤</code> symbols. The reason is that <code>&lt;</code> is just the negation of <code>&gt;</code>. The special method for <code>&lt;</code> is <code>__lt__(self, x)</code> which can just be the negation of calling <code>__gt__(self,x)</code>.</p>\n\n<p>For the ≥ symbol, its special method is the <code>__ge__(self, x)</code> and it must be defined for our object to work well with the <code>≥</code> sign. But in this program, we can do without it. </p>\n\n<p>Another missing piece would be to check if two separate instances of Paper are equal.<br>\n</p>\n<div class=\"highlight js-code-highlight\">\n<pre class=\"highlight plaintext\"><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; p1 = RPS(\"P\", \"Paper\")\n&gt;&gt;&gt; p2 = RPS(\"P\", \"Paper\")\n&gt;&gt;&gt; p3 = p1\n&gt;&gt;&gt; p1 == p2\n# return : False\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt; p1 == p3\n# return : True\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt; id(p1)\n# return : 140197926465008\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt; id(p2)\n# return : 140197925989440\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt; id(p3)\n# return : 140197926465008\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt; id(p1) == id(p3)\n# return : True\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt; id(p2) == id(p1)\n# return False\n</code></pre>\n\n</div>\n\n\n<p>The default operation of the equal comparison sign is to compare the id of the object. p1 and p2 are different class instances that happen to have the same attributes but their id differs and therefore are not equal. When we assign a variable to a class instance, we make that variable point to the address of the instance which is what we observe for p3 which has the same id as p1. We have the option of overriding how the equality comparison works on our object by defining and implementing our own <code>__eq__(self, other)</code> method. But for this script, I will compare two instances using their pick attribute. Now that we have defined our class and know how it works, we are now ready to see the full implementation of the Python script</p>\n<h4>\n  \n  \n  <strong>Putting It All Together</strong>\n</h4>\n\n\n<div class=\"ltag_gist-liquid-tag\">\n  \n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>Let me walk you through the code. We are already familiar with the RPS class definition. If you recall, our code is meant to allow the computer to select choices at random and that's what the random module is for. The random module makes available the <code>choice</code> function which allows the 'random' selection of an element from an iterable object e.g. a list in Python. The list in this case is the <code>option_list</code>. Because our class is made to work with uppercase letters for comparison, it is necessary that we always initialize our objects with uppercase for the pick attribute. This is why we first convert the user's input to upper case (line 34) with the <code>.upper()</code>. It is also possible that our user types in an unexpected character like 'Q' so we have to validate our user input by checking if the uppercase character is part of the valid options in <code>option_list</code>. The mapping dictionary allows us to quickly convert the user's input to a corresponding instance of RPS after being validated. The evaluate_winner function makes use of the comparison symbol to determine the winner. Because we want the code to run in a loop until a winner is found, we make use of a while loop and when a winner is found, the evaluate_winner function returns True which will then break the loop and exit the game.</p>\n\n<p>Here is one of the various results of running the code</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fllgqmarh3ss70o8xrnmi.png\" class=\"article-body-image-wrapper\"><img src=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fllgqmarh3ss70o8xrnmi.png\" alt=\"Image of running the python script\" width=\"722\" height=\"396\"></a></p>\n\n<p>Our Python code runs as expected, although there could be a couple of improvements or new features to add. The most important thing is that we see how using special methods in our class definition gives our code a more Pythonic feel. Assuming we were to take a different approach such as using nested if statements, our evaluate_winner method would look something like this<br>\n</p>\n\n<div class=\"highlight js-code-highlight\">\n<pre class=\"highlight plaintext\"><code>def evaluate_winner(user_choice, comp_choice):\n    # check if user choice is 'R'\n    if user_choice == 'R':\n        # check if comp_choice is 'R'\n        if comp_choice == 'R':\n            # it is a tie\n            ...\n        elif comp_choice == 'S':\n            # user wins\n            ...\n        else:\n          # computer wins\n          ...\n    if ... \n     # do the same for when user_choice is 'S' and then for\n     # when user_choice is 'P'\n</code></pre>\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>A problem with this approach other than the lengthy code is that if we desire to add a new element, diamond which can beat both rock and scissors but not paper (for an unknown reason), our if statements would begin to look really awkward. Whereas in our OOP approach, all we have to do is to modify the options dict like so<br>\n</p>\n\n<div class=\"highlight js-code-highlight\">\n<pre class=\"highlight plaintext\"><code>options = {\"R\" : [\"S\"], \"P\" : [\"R\"], \"S\" : [\"P\"], \"D\" : [\"R\", \"S\"]}\n</code></pre>\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>and then we change the if statement in <code>__gt__</code> to be<br>\n</p>\n\n<div class=\"highlight js-code-highlight\">\n<pre class=\"highlight plaintext\"><code>def __gt__(self,x):    \n    if x.pick in self.options[self.pick]:\n        return True\n    else:\n        return False\n</code></pre>\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>we can make the statement shorter<br>\n</p>\n\n<div class=\"highlight js-code-highlight\">\n<pre class=\"highlight plaintext\"><code>def __gt__(self, x):\n   return True if x.pick in self.options[self.pick] else False\n</code></pre>\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>To conclude, here are some things you should note about using special methods:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>You hardly (or never) call them directly yourself, let Python do the calling for you</p></li>\n<li><p>When defining functions that use the dunder naming syntax, you should consider that Python could one day define such a function and give it a different meaning. This could break your code or make it behave in unexpected ways</p></li>\n<li><p>You certainly don't have to implement every special method there is. Just a couple that you are really sure you need. Remember, simple is better than complex. If there's a simpler way you should use that instead</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>To learn more about the Python data model I recommend the <a href=\"https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">official Python documentation</a>.</p>\n\n<p>I'll also recommend reading <a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/fluent-python/9781491946237/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Fluent Python by Luciano Ramalho</a></p>\n\n<p>This is the first part of the topic, in the next part, we are going to be dealing with operator overloading and making iterable objects</p>\n\n<p>Hope you enjoyed this article!!!</p>\n\n","contentLength":0,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Quansight Labs Blog: Mastering DuckDB when you're used to pandas or Polars","url":"https://labs.quansight.org/blog/duckdb-when-used-to-frames","date":1739750400,"author":"","guid":2129,"unread":true,"content":"<article>It's not as scary as you think</article>","contentLength":30,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"RandomPosterize in PyTorch","url":"https://dev.to/hyperkai/randomposterize-in-pytorch-35e6","date":1739744052,"author":"Super Kai (Kazuya Ito)","guid":799,"unread":true,"content":"<p><a href=\"//ko-fi.com/superkai\">Buy Me a Coffee</a>☕</p>\n\n<p>*Memos:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>\n<a href=\"https://dev.to/hyperkai/oxfordiiitpet-in-pytorch-17kk\">My post</a> explains <a href=\"https://pytorch.org/vision/stable/generated/torchvision.datasets.OxfordIIITPet.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">OxfordIIITPet()</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://pytorch.org/vision/main/generated/torchvision.transforms.v2.RandomPosterize.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">RandomPosterize()</a> can randomly posterize an image with a given probability as shown below:</p>\n\n<p>*Memos:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>The 1st argument for initialization is <code>bits</code>(Required-Type:<code>int</code>):\n*Memos:\n\n<ul>\n<li>It's the number of bits to keep for each channel.</li>\n<li>It must be <code>x &lt;= 8</code>.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n</li>\n\n<li>The 1st argument for initialization is <code>p</code>(Optional-Default:<code>0.5</code>-Type:<code>int</code> or <code>float</code>):\n*Memos:\n\n<ul>\n<li>It's the probability of whether an image is posterized or not.</li>\n<li>It must be <code>0 &lt;= x &lt;= 1</code>.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n</li>\n\n<li>The 1st argument is <code>img</code>(Required-Type:<code>PIL Image</code> or <code>tensor</code>(<code>int</code>)):\n*Memos:\n\n<ul>\n<li>A tensor must be 2D or 3D.</li>\n<li>Don't use <code>img=</code>.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n</li>\n\n<li>\n<code>v2</code> is recommended to use according to <a href=\"https://pytorch.org/vision/0.20/transforms.html#v1-or-v2-which-one-should-i-use\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">V1 or V2?

Let's dive in! You can check out my <a href=\"https://github.com/DeXtreme/translate\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">GitHub</a> for the complete code.</p>\n\n<h3>\n  \n  \n  The Setup\n</h3>\n\n<p>We create a new project with the directory structure shown in the picture<br>\nThen we install the dependency, namely boto3, with pip. We also make sure to create a requirements.txt file so we know which version to install when the script is packaged.</p>\n\n<p>We'll be employing Hexagonal(Layered) Architecture in the design of our API. Hexagonal Architecture or Ports and Adpaters is a design pattern that aims at creating loosely coupled components. A helpful guide can be found <a href=\"https://dev.to/xoubaman/understanding-hexagonal-architecture-3gk\">here</a>. Although python is a dynamically typed language, we can still use this pattern.</p>\n\n<p>We'll be using the project directory structure shown below<br>\n<a href=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fyys8ctber2fmle1icagi.png\" class=\"article-body-image-wrapper\"><img src=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fyys8ctber2fmle1icagi.png\" alt=\"Project structure\" width=\"330\" height=\"385\"></a></p>\n<h3>\n  \n  \n  The Translation Record Model\n</h3>\n\n<p>Let's start with a simple but effective model to track our translations. We'll use Python's dataclasses - they're clean, efficient, and give us nice features out of the box.<br>\n</p>\n\n<div class=\"highlight js-code-highlight\">\n<pre class=\"highlight python\"><code><span class=\"c1\">#translate/models.py\n</span>\n<span class=\"kn\">from</span> <span class=\"n\">dataclasses</span> <span class=\"kn\">import</span> <span class=\"n\">dataclass</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"n\">field</span>\n<span class=\"kn\">from</span> <span class=\"n\">datetime</span> <span class=\"kn\">import</span> <span class=\"n\">datetime</span>\n\n<span class=\"nd\">@dataclass</span>\n<span class=\"k\">class</span> <span class=\"nc\">Record</span><span class=\"p\">:</span>\n    <span class=\"nb\">id</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"nb\">str</span>\n    <span class=\"n\">input_text</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"nb\">str</span>\n    <span class=\"n\">output_text</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"nb\">str</span>\n    <span class=\"n\">created_at</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"n\">datetime</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"nf\">field</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">default</span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"n\">datetime</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"n\">now</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n\n</code></pre>\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>Let's break down what each field does:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>\n<code>id</code>: A unique identifier for each translation record</li>\n<li>\n<code>input_text</code>: The original text that needs translation</li>\n<li>\n<code>output_text</code>: The translated result</li>\n<li>\n<code>created_at</code>: Timestamp of when the translation was performed, automatically set to the current time</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>You might wonder why we're using <code>@dataclass</code> instead of a regular class. Here's what makes dataclasses great for our use case:</p>\n\n<p>Less Boilerplate: We don't need to write <strong>init</strong>, <strong>repr</strong>, or <strong>eq</strong> methods<br>\nDefault Values: Easy handling of default values with the field function<br>\nType Hints: Built-in support for type hints, making our code more maintainable</p>\n\n<p>Next, we'll define our ports using Python's Protocol class - a more Pythonic approach to interfaces. Let's dive in!<br>\nWhy Protocols Over Abstract Base Classes?<br>\nBefore we jump into the code, let's understand why we're choosing Protocols:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>More Pythonic - follows duck typing principles</li>\n<li>Structural subtyping instead of nominal subtyping</li>\n<li>Better integration with static type checkers</li>\n<li>No explicit inheritance required\n</li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"highlight js-code-highlight\">\n<pre class=\"highlight python\"><code><span class=\"c1\">#translate/ports.py\n</span>\n<span class=\"kn\">from</span> <span class=\"n\">typing</span> <span class=\"kn\">import</span> <span class=\"n\">Protocol</span>\n<span class=\"kn\">from</span> <span class=\"n\">models</span> <span class=\"kn\">import</span> <span class=\"n\">Record</span>\n\n\n<span class=\"k\">class</span> <span class=\"nc\">TextPersistencePort</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">Protocol</span><span class=\"p\">):</span>\n    <span class=\"k\">def</span> <span class=\"nf\">save</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">self</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"n\">input_text</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"nb\">str</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"n\">output_text</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"nb\">str</span><span class=\"p\">)</span> <span class=\"o\">-&gt;</span> <span class=\"n\">Record</span><span class=\"p\">:</span>\n        <span class=\"k\">pass</span>\n\n\n<span class=\"k\">class</span> <span class=\"nc\">TranslationPort</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">Protocol</span><span class=\"p\">):</span>\n    <span class=\"k\">def</span> <span class=\"nf\">translate</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">self</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"n\">text</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"nb\">str</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"n\">lang</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"nb\">str</span><span class=\"p\">)</span> <span class=\"o\">-&gt;</span> <span class=\"nb\">str</span><span class=\"p\">:</span>\n        <span class=\"k\">pass</span>\n\n</code></pre>\n\n</div>\n\n\n<p>Now we define the adapters that implement the ports. The <code>DynamoDBPersistenceAdapter</code> stores the input and output in DynamoDB and return a Record object.

What started as an idea a few weeks earlier turned into a diverse community event, laying the foundation for Python Dhaka’s journey.</p>\n\n<p>Here’s how we made it happen and what we learned along the way.</p>\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  Arranging the Meetup\n</h2>\n\n<p>The whole event was organized through our Facebook group. In Bangladesh, Facebook is the primary hub for tech enthusiasts to form communities and organize events. Unlike platforms like Meetup or Discord, Facebook groups often serve as the starting point for grassroots tech movements here. I launched a Facebook group for Python Dhaka a few weeks prior, and thanks to my personal network, it grew to 250 members within two weeks.</p>\n\n<p>The next logical step was to organize an in-person meetup, because I want this group to be all about connecting with the local Python enthusiasts. After thinking about it for a few days, I locked in a date and venue for the first meetup.</p>\n\n<p>I choose the 15th of February because it's the mid-month, and a Saturday. In Bangladesh, Fridays and Saturdays are official holidays. Friday is the most popular day for events, followed by Saturdays. I picked Chandrima Udyan for two reasons: 1. It has easy access to the bus and metro route; 2. It's a public park we can access for free.</p>\n\n<p>I created the event on Facebook and started spreading the word on the FB group, my profile, Twitter, Linkedin, and my Instagram handle. I even created a short video announcing the event and posted it on all of my socials.</p>\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  How the Meetup Went\n</h2>\n\n<p>At 5 PM local time, I waited near the park entrance, feeling a mix of excitement and nerves. Soon, one by one, attendees started arriving, their calls guiding me to them. Here’s me waiting:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fjl0ysrrbspa6g25leekx.jpeg\" class=\"article-body-image-wrapper\"><img src=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fjl0ysrrbspa6g25leekx.jpeg\" alt=\"Tamal waiting for attendees\" width=\"800\" height=\"599\"></a></p>\n\n<p>As we entered the park, a cool evening breeze greeted us—washing away the stress of city life and setting the perfect mood for our first meetup.</p>\n\n<p>I started the meeting by sharing the Python Software Foundation's missions with the attendees, and how it relates to us:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>To grow a diverse and international community of Python programmers:</strong> Organizing the Python Dhaka community is helping this mission.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Encourage knowledge sharing, collaboration, and support devs of all backgrounds:</strong> Students from three universities joined this event. They were able to share knowledge and build future collaboration opportunities. This community is open to all levels of developer experience.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Grow a diverse and welcoming community; support underrepresented communities in tech:</strong> One participant came from a non-computer science background, eager to transition into tech. This is exactly why Python Dhaka exists—to welcome everyone, regardless of their starting point.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>I then shared how I started evangelizing Python.</p>\n\n<p>I am a professional JavaScript developer with React and NextJS expertise. I use JS for my daily work. My cousin wanted to learn Python, so I got into learning it. I found Python to be easy to learn and easy to teach. I was looking for a Python community in Dhaka, but there was none. That's why I decided to organize the Python User Group Dhaka.</p>\n\n<p>I also mentioned that I don't own Python Dhaka. I am only organizing it for the time being. As this community grows, and if in the future I have to move cities, I will pass the torch to the next person to continue organizing our community activities.</p>\n\n<p>We are not strictly Python fanatics. We would love to collaborate with our friends in the JavaScript, PHP, and Kotlin communities too from time to time.</p>\n\n<p>We heard personal stories from the attendees, how they got into programming, and how they are using Python. Two students are doing competitive programming with C, C++ and thinking of switching to Python for CP and ML.</p>\n\n<p>Two of the attendees came from different districts just so they could attend this meetup. </p>\n\n<p><strong>One attendee traveled over 80 kilometers from Tangail just to be here. That level of dedication reminded me why this community matters.</strong></p>\n\n<p>I shared many tech tips, and also informed them about the free GitHub Student Developer pack and how to avail it. We also discussed getting real-world experiences by putting an app out in the world.</p>\n\n<p>We also announced the Campus Ambassador Program for Python Dhaka and nominated Abdullah to be the ambassador at Southeast University. A campus ambassador is a person in your college/university who will promote and evangelize Python programming language on your campus.</p>\n\n<p>As the meetup was about to end, it was getting dark when we clicked this group photo.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2F2hdmvez9h8k7jm1fhvaz.jpg\" class=\"article-body-image-wrapper\"><img src=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2F2hdmvez9h8k7jm1fhvaz.jpg\" alt=\"Python Dhaka first event group photo\" width=\"800\" height=\"599\"></a></p>\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  Next Steps\n</h2>\n\n<p>Our journey is just beginning. We plan to host monthly meetups around the 15th of each month, but our ambition goes beyond that. We want to nurture the next generation of Python developers in Bangladesh, and one day, bring PyCon Bangladesh to life.</p>\n\n<p>If you’re as passionate about Python as we are—whether you’re in Dhaka or anywhere in the world—we’d love your support.
