The root cause? A  object, used to track feature flag exposure, silently overflowed its maximum value due to an unexpected surge in traffic. This wasn’t a simple integer overflow; it was a consequence of using a naive implementation of a counter within a heavily concurrent, async environment. The incident highlighted a critical truth: even the most basic data structures require careful consideration when deployed at scale. This post dives deep into the world of  in Python, moving beyond the basics to explore its nuances in production systems, focusing on performance, reliability, and best practices.

What is \"Counter\" in Python?\n</h3><p>The  class, found in the  module, is a specialized dictionary subclass designed for counting hashable objects.  It’s not defined by a PEP directly, but its functionality is well-documented (<a href=\"https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html#collections.Counter\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html#collections.Counter</a>).  Internally, it leverages a standard Python dictionary to store element counts.  However, it provides convenient methods like , , and arithmetic operations for combining counters.</p><p>From a typing perspective,  is generic: , where  is the type of the hashable objects being counted.  This type hinting is crucial for static analysis with .  While the CPython implementation is efficient for many use cases, it’s important to understand its limitations, particularly regarding concurrency and potential overflow issues with the underlying integer representation.</p><p>Here are several production scenarios where  proves invaluable:</p><ul><li><strong>FastAPI Request Rate Limiting:</strong>  We use  to track requests per user within a sliding window.  This allows us to enforce rate limits and prevent abuse.  The  is reset periodically by an async task.</li><li><strong>Async Job Queue Monitoring:</strong>  In a Celery-based system,  tracks the number of successful, failed, and pending tasks per queue. This provides real-time visibility into job processing health.</li><li><strong>Type-Safe Data Models (Pydantic):</strong>  When validating large datasets,  can efficiently determine the frequency of invalid data types, helping identify schema issues.</li><li><strong>CLI Tool Argument Parsing:</strong>  Counting the occurrences of specific command-line flags or options.</li><li><strong>ML Preprocessing Feature Frequency:</strong>  Calculating the frequency of categorical features during data preprocessing for machine learning models. This informs feature engineering and model selection.</li></ul><h3>\n  \n  \n  4.

The root cause wasn’t a database outage or a network hiccup, but a subtle race condition within a utility function used for feature engineering. This function, intended to be purely computational and independent of instance state, was incorrectly implemented as an instance method.  The implicit  argument, even when unused, introduced a lock contention point when multiple asynchronous workers attempted to call it concurrently.  This incident highlighted a fundamental truth: seemingly innocuous language features like  are crucial for building robust, scalable Python applications, especially in cloud-native environments.  This post dives deep into , moving beyond textbook definitions to explore its practical implications in production systems, focusing on architecture, performance, and debugging.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  What is \"@staticmethod\" in Python?\n</h3><p> is a decorator that transforms a method within a class into a function bound to the class itself, rather than to an instance of the class.  PEP 105 defines it as a way to define methods that are logically related to the class but don’t require access to instance-specific data.  Technically, it doesn’t enforce any access restrictions; it’s a semantic marker.  CPython’s method table lookup handles  differently than instance methods or class methods (). Instance methods receive the instance () as the first argument, while  receives no implicit first argument.  This distinction is critical for performance and concurrency.  From a typing perspective,  doesn’t alter the function’s signature; it’s purely a runtime behavior modifier.  Tools like  treat it as a regular function within the class namespace.</p><ol><li><strong>FastAPI Request Validation:</strong>  We use  extensively in FastAPI applications for request body validation.  Instead of tying validation logic to a specific instance of a data model, we define static methods that perform schema validation using Pydantic. This keeps the validation logic separate from the model’s core data representation and allows for easy reuse across different endpoints.\n</li></ol><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><ol><li><p> In our asynchronous task queue (built on Celery and Redis),  is used for utility functions that process data without needing access to the worker’s state.

However, it’s crucial to type-hint the function signature correctly.   can test  methods directly without needing to instantiate the class.   models can leverage  for custom validation logic.</p><p>Here's a  snippet demonstrating our typical configuration:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>We enforce strict type checking with  to catch potential errors related to  usage, particularly incorrect type hints.  We also use  hooks to run  and  on every commit.</p><p>Consider a geometric shape class:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>This example demonstrates a clear separation of concerns. The  and  calculations are logically related to the  class but don’t require access to a specific  instance.

This can lead to unexpected behavior and difficult-to-debug errors.  For example:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Debugging such issues requires careful examination of the traceback and understanding the scope of variables.

Runtime assertions can also help catch these errors early:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><h3>\n  \n  \n  Performance &amp; Scalability\n</h3><p> offers a slight performance advantage over instance methods because it avoids the overhead of instance lookup and method binding.  However, the difference is usually negligible unless the method is called millions of times.  The real performance benefit comes from avoiding unnecessary context switching and lock contention, as demonstrated in the initial data pipeline incident.  Using  to profile your code can help identify performance bottlenecks related to method calls.</p><p>While  itself doesn’t introduce direct security vulnerabilities, it’s crucial to ensure that the logic within the static method is secure.  If the method processes user-provided input, it must be properly validated to prevent code injection or other attacks.  Avoid deserializing untrusted data within a  without strict validation.</p><p>We use a combination of unit tests, integration tests, and property-based tests (using Hypothesis) to verify the correctness of  methods.  Unit tests focus on testing the method’s logic in isolation, while integration tests verify its interaction with other components.

We were experiencing intermittent failures in our data labeling pipeline, specifically during the dynamic instantiation of custom data validation rules. These rules, defined as classes inheriting from a base validator, were being instantiated based on configuration loaded from a distributed key-value store (etcd). The root cause wasn’t the validation logic itself, but a race condition during class resolution when the configuration changed mid-deployment.  The dynamic nature of our system, coupled with aggressive caching, meant we were sometimes instantiating validators with stale class definitions.  A careful refactoring leveraging  as a factory method resolved the issue, ensuring consistent class resolution and preventing the intermittent failures. This incident highlighted that  isn’t just a syntactic sugar; it’s a crucial tool for building robust, dynamically configurable systems in Python.  It matters in modern Python ecosystems – cloud-native services, data pipelines, web APIs, and machine learning ops – because these systems often require dynamic behavior and factory patterns.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  What is  in Python?\n</h3><p> is a decorator that transforms a method within a class into a class method. Technically, it binds the method to the class itself, rather than to an instance of the class. This means the first argument passed to the method is the class itself (), not the instance ().  This is defined in PEP 3 (Python Enhancement Proposal 3) and further clarified in the official documentation (<a href=\"https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#classmethod\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#classmethod</a>).</p><p>From a CPython internals perspective,  essentially modifies the method descriptor to set its  method to return the function bound to the class object, rather than an instance.  This is crucial for understanding how it differs from instance methods and static methods.  The typing system recognizes  through , allowing for static type checking of the  argument.  Tools like  leverage this to ensure type safety when working with class methods.</p><ol><li><p><strong>FastAPI Dependency Injection with Dynamic Configuration:</strong>  We use  to create factory methods for database connection pools in FastAPI. The connection parameters (host, port, credentials) are loaded from environment variables or a configuration service.  A class method dynamically configures the pool based on the current environment, ensuring each deployment uses the correct database settings. This avoids hardcoding credentials and simplifies environment-specific configurations.</p></li><li><p><strong>Async Job Queues with Task Factories:</strong> In a Celery-based asynchronous task queue, we use  to create task factories.  The class method receives the task configuration (e.g., retry policy, queue name) and returns an instance of the task class, pre-configured with the specified parameters. This allows us to dynamically adjust task behavior without modifying the task code itself.</p></li><li><p><strong>Type-Safe Data Models with Alternate Constructors:</strong>  We’ve implemented a system for defining data models using Pydantic.  Sometimes, we need to construct objects from data sources that don’t directly map to the Pydantic model’s fields.   provides a clean way to define alternate constructors that handle these specific data formats, ensuring type safety and validation.</p></li><li><p><strong>CLI Tools with Subcommand Factories:</strong>  For a complex CLI tool built with Click, we use  to create factories for subcommand classes.  The class method receives the command-line arguments and returns an instance of the appropriate subcommand class, allowing for dynamic subcommand resolution based on user input.</p></li><li><p><strong>ML Preprocessing Pipelines with Dynamic Feature Engineering:</strong> In our machine learning pipelines, we use  to create factory methods for feature engineering steps. The class method receives the feature configuration (e.g., scaling method, transformation parameters) and returns an instance of the feature engineering class, pre-configured with the specified parameters. This allows us to dynamically adjust the feature engineering process without modifying the core pipeline code.</p></li></ol><h3>\n  \n  \n  Integration with Python Tooling\n</h3><p> integrates seamlessly with modern Python tooling.</p><ul><li> correctly infers the type of the  argument and performs static type checking.

The  method dynamically loads validator classes based on the configuration, caching them for performance.  The  annotation ensures that  is a class variable, shared across all instances.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Failure Scenarios &amp; Debugging\n</h3><p>A common failure scenario is incorrect handling of inheritance when using . If a subclass overrides a class method without calling the superclass’s implementation, it can break the inheritance chain and lead to unexpected behavior.</p><p>Another issue is race conditions when dynamically loading classes, as experienced in our production incident.  Caching is essential for performance, but stale cache entries can lead to incorrect behavior.</p><p>Debugging these issues requires careful use of logging and tracing.  We use structured logging with correlation IDs to track requests through the system.   can be used to step through the code and inspect the state of the  argument.   can help identify performance bottlenecks in the class method.  Runtime assertions can be used to verify that the  argument is of the expected type.</p><p>Example traceback (simplified):</p><div><pre><code>Traceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"...\", line 10, in from_config\n    return cls.VALIDATOR_CACHE[validator_type](config)\n  File \"...\", line 20, in __init__\n    super().__init__(config)\nTypeError: __init__() missing 1 required positional argument: 'config'\n</code></pre></div><p>This indicates a mismatch between the expected arguments in the superclass's  method and the arguments being passed.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Performance &amp; Scalability\n</h3><p> itself doesn’t introduce significant performance overhead. However, the code within the class method can impact performance.  Avoid global state and unnecessary allocations.  If the class method performs I/O operations, consider using asynchronous programming to improve scalability.  Caching, as demonstrated in the example above, is crucial for performance when dynamically loading classes.  We use Redis as a distributed cache to store the loaded validator classes.</p><p>We benchmarked the  method using  and found that caching reduced the instantiation time by over 90%.</p><p>Dynamically loading classes based on configuration can introduce security risks.  Ensure that the configuration source is trusted and that the loaded classes are properly validated.  Avoid using  or  to execute arbitrary code.  Implement input validation to prevent code injection attacks.  Consider using a sandbox environment to isolate the loaded classes.</p><p>We use a combination of unit tests, integration tests, and property-based tests to verify the correctness of class methods.  Unit tests verify the logic within the class method in isolation.  Integration tests verify that the class method interacts correctly with other components of the system.  Property-based tests (using Hypothesis) generate random inputs to test the class method against a wide range of scenarios.</p><p>Our CI/CD pipeline includes the following steps:</p><ul><li> runs unit and integration tests.</li><li> performs static type checking.</li><li> runs tests in multiple Python environments.</li><li>GitHub Actions automatically runs the CI/CD pipeline on every pull request.</li><li>Pre-commit hooks enforce code style and linting.</li></ul><h3>\n  \n  \n  Common Pitfalls &amp; Anti-Patterns\n</h3><ol><li><strong>Forgetting to call :</strong>  This breaks the inheritance chain.</li><li><strong>Using  for instance-specific logic:</strong>  This defeats the purpose of the decorator.</li><li>  Simple instance methods are often more appropriate.</li><li>  This reduces the benefits of static type checking.</li><li><strong>Not caching dynamically loaded classes:</strong>  This leads to performance bottlenecks.</li><li><strong>Lack of input validation when dynamically loading classes:</strong> This introduces security vulnerabilities.</li></ol><h3>\n  \n  \n  Best Practices &amp; Architecture\n</h3><ul><li> Always use type hints to improve code readability and maintainability.</li><li>  Keep class methods focused on a single responsibility.</li><li>  Validate inputs and handle exceptions gracefully.</li><li>  Break down complex systems into smaller, reusable modules.</li><li>  Use a layered configuration approach to manage environment-specific settings.</li><li>  Use dependency injection to improve testability and flexibility.</li><li>  Automate testing, linting, and deployment.</li><li>  Use Docker to create reproducible build environments.</li><li>  Write clear and concise documentation.</li></ul><p> is a powerful tool for building robust, scalable, and maintainable Python systems.

I will look into all requests as soon as I can.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Peering into the GRPO equation\n</h2><p>We will dissect is this scary-looking (at least to me!) equation: </p><p>This is the theoretical expectation, which theoretically considers every possible prompt, generates a group of responses for each, and then average the improvement we get from the  (see below) over all these possibilities.</p><p>This is the sample-based  (the \"estimator\"). Since we cannot possibly compute the true expectation over all prompts and outputs, we approximate it during training where we take one batch ( a prompt  and its  generated outputs \n\n and we compute the numerical estimate of our objective using the objective function. We then use this numerical estimate to calculate a gradient and update our model's weights, i.e. (\n\n becomes \n\n).</p><p>I will break down the equations into the following parts:</p><ul><li><p>Part 1: \n</p></li><li><p>Part 2: \n</p></li><li><p>Part 3: \n</p></li><li><p>Part 4: \n</p></li><li><p>Part 5: \n</p></li></ul><p>The equation that will be dissected in this part is:</p><ul><li><p>The tilde (~): It means \"distributed according to\" or \"is sampled from\". So:</p><ul><li>\n This represents questions (q) sampled from the overall distribution of questions (P(Q)). This is a standard practice where models learn to respond to various prompts during training.</li><li>\n: This means the group of G outputs \n\n is sampled from the policy \n\n given question q.</li></ul></li><li><p>The expectation function i.e. \n signifies a joint expectation over multiple random variables. One commonly seen example is \n which means taking the expectation over the combined process of first sampling X from P(X), and then sampling Y from P(Y|X). The expectation then applies to the function of both X and Y.</p></li><li><p>In probability theory, \n can be written as \n for discrete variables, or \n for continuous variables. The comma notation is a shorthand for this sequential or joint sampling process.</p></li><li><p>Applying to our equation:</p><ul><li>q ~ P(Q): First, a question  is randomly chosen from the pool of all possible questions.</li><li>\n: Given that specific question , a group of  outputs \n\n is then generated by the old policy \n\n.</li><li>The expression \n\n that follows (the GRPO objective function) then depends on both  and the generated output \n\n.</li><li>So, the expectation is taken over the entire data collection process: first randomly pick a question from the bank of available questions, and then generating multiple responses for that question using the \n\n policy.</li></ul></li></ul><ul><li>The tilde (~) tells you how the data is being generated (which distribution).</li><li>The comma (,) separates independent (or conditionally independent) sampling steps that define the full set of random variables over which the expectation is taken. It implies a joint probability distribution, often constructed sequentially.</li></ul><h4>\n  \n  \n  Why \n\n instead of simply \n\n?\n</h4><ul><li>The notation \n\n explicitly states that q is the random variable being sampled, and P(Q) is its probability distribution.</li><li>Similarly, \n\n states that \n\n are the random variables (the sampled outputs), and \n\n is the conditional probability distribution from which they are drawn (conditioned on q).</li></ul><p>Without q ~ and \n\n, the expression \n\n is ambiguous as it is not clear which variables are being sampled or how are they related to the function \n\n. The P(Q) and \n\n are distributions, not actual values that vary and contribute to the average.</p><p>To implement the Expectation operator E[...]. we can use a loop where each iteration processes a new, randomly sampled mini-batch of prompts, calculate the loss for that batch, and performs an update. Over many iterations, this process approximates the expected value of the objective over the entire data distribution.</p><p>Do not fret that the code is long. I will break it down and explain each piece accordingly.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><h3>\n  \n  \n  The rollout phase: \n</h3><p>For each prompt q in our batch, we need to generate a group G possible outputs (\n\n) using the fixed, old policy \n\n.

The outer loop iterates through prompts in the batch, and the inner loop runs  (G) times to generate each output \n\n for that prompt.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><h3>\n  \n  \n  Part 2: \n</h3><p>The concept behind this equation is importance sampling:</p><ul><li><p> This represents the probability of generating a specific output \n\n (a complete reasoning trace and answer) given the input question \n\n, using the . The \"old\" policy is the version of the model that was used to generate the batch of data for the current training step. It is frozen during this step.</p></li><li><p> This represents the probability of generating that \n given the question \n\n, but using the \n. This is the policy we are actively training and updating in this step.</p></li><li><p> The ratio \n\n is the  or .</p><ul><li>  If \n\n, the new policy \n\n is  to generate output \n\n than the old one was.</li><li>  If \n\n, the new policy \n\n is  to generate output \n\n.</li><li>  If \n\n, the policy has not changed with respect to this specific output.</li></ul></li></ul><h4>\n  \n  \n  What is its purpose? (Off-Policy Learning)\n</h4><p>The primary purpose of this ratio is to enable .</p><p>In reinforcement learning, the ideal way to evaluate a policy is to use it to generate actions and see what rewards you get. However, generating new outputs (\n\n) from the model for every single gradient update is computationally very expensive.</p><p>Off-policy methods solve this. We can:</p><ol><li> Generate a large batch of experiences (the outputs \n\n) using the \n\n policy.</li><li> Then, perform several steps of optimization on our \n\n policy using that same batch of data.</li></ol><p>The importance sampling ratio is the mathematical \"correction factor\" that allows us to estimate how good an action is under the  policy (\n\n) using data that was collected by the  policy (\n\n).</p><p>For the ease of discussion, I will equate:</p><p>The objective function multiplies this ratio by the advantage \n\n (how good the output \n\n was). So, the update logic is:</p><ul><li>  If \n\n was a good output (\n\n), we want to increase its probability. Maximising \n\n will push \n\n to be greater than 1, which in turn pushes \n\n to increase.</li><li>  If \n\n was a bad output (\n\n), we want to decrease its probability. Maximising \n\n (a negative number) will push \n\n to be less than 1, making the overall term less negative and thus decreasing \n\n.</li></ul><h4>\n  \n  \n  Why is it designed that way? (Stability and PPO)\n</h4><p>While the ratio allows for efficient learning, it is also a source of instability. If the new policy \n\n becomes very different from the old one \n\n, the ratio \n\n can become extremely large or close to zero. A very large ratio would lead to a massive, noisy gradient update, potentially destroying all the learning the model has already done.</p><p>This is the problem that <strong>Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)</strong>, from which GRPO's objective is derived, was designed to solve. The design in Equation 1 is a direct implementation of the  (source: <a href=\"https://spinningup.openai.com/en/latest/algorithms/ppo.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Proximal Policy Optimization</a>).</p><p>The goal is to keep the new policy \"proximal\" (i.e., close) to the old policy. This creates a \"trust region\" where we can be confident the update is beneficial.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Part 3: \n</h3><p>This is the core of the PPO algorithm, which encourages making the new policy \n\n more likely to produce high-advantage outputs, but \"clips\" the update to prevent it from changing to drastically and destabilsing training.</p><p>Take for instance we set \n\n to be 0.2. We then get the following clipping equation:</p><p>Examples of how the clipping equation works is below:</p><ul><li>\n because the value is within the range.</li><li>\n because the value is beyond the range and is clipped down to the maximum value of 1.2.</li></ul><p>We can see that with clipping, when the optimiser gets \"greedy\" and suggests a huge change, the model is still encouraged to make the output more likely, but is prevented from making a dangerously large jump in the policy.</p><p>This logic is encapsulated within the .</p><p>The probability ratio \n\n is calculated in log-space for \nnumerical stability: \n\n).</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>The helper function  is responsible for computing log P(o_i | q) for a given policy.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><h3>\n  \n  \n  Part 4: \n</h3><p>The purpose of this  function is to act as a floor, i.e.:</p><ul><li> When an output is good (positive \n\n), it prevents the update from becoming too rewarding.</li><li> When an output is bad (negative \n\n), it acts as a floor on the penalty.</li></ul><p>In both cases, the  function prevents the model from making a large policy change too quickly.</p><p>Using back the same clipping function in Part 3, where we set \n\n, \n\n, and we now assume we have an advantage value \n\n. The equation we thus get is:</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Part 5: \n</h3><p>This function acts as a regulariser, penalising the policy \n\n for deviating from a reference policy \n\n. <em>(Note: When we say policy, we are actually referring to the LLM as weights, so \n\n refers to the LLM with updated weights, while \n\n usually refers to the original stock LLM.)_</em></p><p>The paper defines the term as:</p><p>What is key is to recognise that this equation is not the standard Kulback-Leibler (KL) divergence, but a more specific, per-sample approximation chosen for being computationally cheaper. This compares to the standard KL divergence which can be expressed as:</p><p>Compared to the standard definition, there are two main differences:</p><ol><li> The standard definition is an  over the entire distribution \n\n, whereas the paper's variant is an expression for a \n.</li><li> The functional form of the paper's variant is different from the term inside the standard expectation.</li></ol><h4>\n  \n  \n  Deconstruction and Analysis of the variant of KL divergence\n</h4><p>For simplicity, let the probability ratio be :</p><p>Then Equation (2) defines a function \n\n:</p><p>This function is evaluated for a single sample \n\n, which itself was drawn from the  policy, \n\n.</p><p>In order for \n\n to be a valid divergence measure, it must satisfy two properties:</p><ol><li>\n.</li><li><strong>Identity of Indiscernibles:</strong>\n if and only if \n\n. </li></ol><p>Proof that \n\n satisfies the two properties is in Appendix A. </p><p>This term is a regularizer. It penalizes the objective if the trainable policy π_θ strays too far from the original, trusted reference policy π_ref, helping to prevent catastrophic forgetting.</p><p>Code Implementation: Also within .</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>The Advantage Function \n\n is a central component in modern policy gradient methods. Intuitively, the advantage tells us not just if an action was \"good\" (positive reward), but if it was \"better than average\". It is designed to reduce sensitivity to reward scaling, and stabilises training by preventing outlier rewards.

In reinforcement learning, the simplest policy gradient update rule uses the total reward \n\n to scale the gradient \n\n. However, this approach suffers from high variance, meaning the gradient estimates can fluctuate wildly from one batch of samples to another, leading to unstable training.</p><p>The core idea to reduce this variance is to subtract a \n from the reward. The baseline should ideally be an estimate of the average reward from state \n\n. This leads to the Advantage Function:</p><p>Intuitively, the advantage tells us not just if an action was \"good\" (positive reward), but if it was \"better than average\". If \n\n, the action \n\n was better than expected, and its probability should be increased. If \n\n, the action was worse than expected, and its probability should be decreased.</p><p><strong>Key Theorem (Baseline Invariance of Policy Gradient):</strong>\nThe introduction of a baseline \n\n that depends only on the state  (or in our case, the prompt \n\n) does not introduce bias into the gradient estimate.</p><p>\nWe need to show that \n\n.</p><p>This proves that subtracting a baseline does not change the expected gradient, \n\n. While the expectation is the same, the variance of the gradient estimator \n\n is significantly reduced.</p><p>The paper's specific implementation of the advantage function for a group of \n\n outputs \n\n is:</p><p>where \n\n are the rewards for the corresponding outputs.</p><h4>\n  \n  \n  Step-by-Step Component Breakdown\n</h4><p>Let's deconstruct the formula for the advantage of the -th sample, \n\n.</p><h4>\n  \n  \n  1. The Rewards: \n</h4><ul><li>: This is the numerical reward assigned to the -th output \n\n, which was generated for a given prompt \n\n.</li><li> The paper specifies (in Section 2.2.2) that these are rule-based rewards.\n\n<ul><li> A binary or continuous score evaluating if the final answer in \n\n is correct. For a math problem, this could be checking if the result matches the known solution. For a coding problem, it could be the percentage of test cases passed.</li><li> A score evaluating if the output \n\n adheres to a desired format (e.g., using  and  tags).</li></ul></li><li> The existence of a reward function \n\n is a fundamental axiom of the reinforcement learning framework. \n\n.</li></ul><h4>\n  \n  \n  2. The Baseline: \n</h4><ul><li> This is the  (or sample average) of the rewards obtained from the  outputs generated for the same prompt .</li></ul><ul><li> This term serves as the baseline . It's an estimate of the expected reward for the given prompt  under the current (old) policy \n\n. Instead of using a separate, learned \"critic\" network to predict the expected reward, the GRPO algorithm uses this simple and efficient empirical estimate from the group of samples.</li><li> The numerator \n\n is the raw, unnormalized advantage. It measures whether the -th output was better or worse than the average performance within its group.</li></ul><h4>\n  \n  \n  3. The Normalization Factor: \n</h4><ul><li> This is the <strong>empirical standard deviation</strong> of the rewards from the group.</li></ul><p><em>(Note: Sometimes the denominator is  for the biased estimator, but  for the unbiased estimator. In practice, for large , the difference is negligible. We will assume the standard definition.)</em></p><ul><li><strong>Purpose of Normalization:</strong> Dividing the raw advantage by the standard deviation is a form of data standardization. It rescales the advantages for a given prompt so that their distribution has a standard deviation of 1.</li><li><strong>Mathematical Justification:</strong>\nLet the set of raw advantages for a group be \n\n .\n\n<ul><li>  The mean of this set is \n\n . The advantages are centered at zero.</li><li>  The standard deviation of this set is \n\n .\nBy dividing each element of \n\n  by \n\n , the resulting set of normalized advantages \n\n  will have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.</li></ul></li></ul><h4>\n  \n  \n  Why is this Normalization Important?\n</h4><ol><li><p><strong>Reduces Sensitivity to Reward Scaling:</strong> Imagine two different tasks. In Task 1, rewards are either 0 or 1. The advantages will be small fractions. In Task 2, rewards are 0 or 1000. The advantages will be large numbers. Without normalization, the gradient updates for Task 2 would be 1000 times larger than for Task 1, potentially destabilizing learning when training on a mix of tasks. Normalization ensures that the scale of the advantage signal is consistent across different prompts and reward schemes.</p></li><li><p> It prevents outlier rewards (a single very high or very low reward in a group) from generating excessively large gradients that could harm the policy. By scaling everything relative to the variation within the group, the updates become more measured and stable.</p></li></ol><p>Equation (3) defines a specific form of the advantage function, known as  in its simplest form, with an additional normalization step.</p><ol><li> It first calculates a raw advantage for each sample \n\n  by subtracting a baseline from its reward \n\n .</li><li><strong>Uses an Empirical Baseline:</strong> The baseline is not a learned value but is efficiently estimated as the mean reward of all samples \n\n generated for the same prompt \n\n . This conforms to the requirement that the baseline depends only on the prompt \n\n  (and the policy that generated the samples), thus not introducing bias into the policy gradient.</li><li><strong>Normalizes the Advantage:</strong> The raw advantage is then divided by the standard deviation of the rewards within the group. This standardizes the advantages, making them have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1 for that group.</li><li> This process results in a well-behaved, normalized advantage signal \n\n that robustly indicates whether an output was better or worse than average, independent of the absolute scale of the rewards for that particular task. This standardized signal is then used in Equation (1) to provide stable and effective gradient updates for the policy \n\n .</li></ol>","contentLength":24725,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"My first innovative code !","url":"https://dev.to/vishwa_xii_1417a4e94e7240/my-first-innovative-code--4242","date":1750523365,"author":"Vishwa XII","guid":164341,"unread":true,"content":"<h2>\n  \n  \n  ** Today I found how cloud in working, how it stores all the data of any type in a single storage place, I solve it in a 9 lines of python code, not accurately, but I tried logically !**\n</h2><p>from ast import literal_eval</p><p>file = input(\"Enter anything: \").split()</p><div><pre><code>    cloud.append(literal_eval(file))\nexcept:\n    cloud.append(item)\n</code></pre></div><p>I know this is dumb, but I hate to watch tutorials !`</p>","contentLength":385,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Mastering the Command Line: 25 Essential Scripting Resources for Developers","url":"https://dev.to/vaib/mastering-the-command-line-25-essential-scripting-resources-for-developers-4284","date":1750521812,"author":"Coder","guid":164315,"unread":true,"content":"<p>Scripting languages are the unsung heroes of modern software development.

The root cause wasn’t a database outage or network hiccup, but a subtle interaction between a third-party risk scoring service and our internal data transformation layer. The risk service’s API had undergone a minor version bump, adding optional parameters. Our transformation layer, designed with extensive use of  for flexibility,  to handle the new parameters gracefully. However, under heavy load, the dynamic unpacking and attribute access within the transformation functions led to significant performance degradation and, eventually, timeouts. This incident highlighted a crucial truth:  is a powerful tool, but its unchecked use can introduce subtle performance and reliability issues in production systems. This post dives deep into , exploring its intricacies, best practices, and potential pitfalls for experienced Python engineers building large-scale applications.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  What is  in Python?\n</h3><p> (short for \"keyword arguments\") is a Python feature allowing functions to accept an arbitrary number of keyword arguments. Technically, it unpacks a dictionary into keyword arguments.  Defined in PEP 3102, it leverages Python’s function call mechanism to dynamically bind keys in the dictionary to function parameters. </p><p>From a CPython internals perspective,  translates to creating a frame object with a local variable representing the dictionary. The function then iterates through this dictionary, attempting to match keys to parameter names. This dynamic lookup is where performance concerns arise.  The typing system, via  or , acknowledges its existence but offers limited static checking without explicit type annotations. Tools like Pydantic and type hints are crucial for mitigating this.</p><ol><li><p><strong>FastAPI Request Handling:</strong> FastAPI leverages  extensively in route handlers.  While providing flexibility, it necessitates careful validation using Pydantic models to ensure type safety and prevent unexpected behavior.  Without validation, a malicious actor could potentially inject arbitrary parameters.</p></li><li><p><strong>Async Job Queues (Celery/RQ):</strong>  Asynchronous task queues often use  to pass context and configuration to worker functions. This allows for dynamic task execution without modifying the core task definition.  However, serializing and deserializing these dictionaries for inter-process communication can become a bottleneck.</p></li><li><p><strong>Type-Safe Data Models (Pydantic):</strong> Pydantic’s  method allows for flexible data serialization.  However, passing untrusted  directly can bypass validation, leading to data integrity issues.</p></li><li><p>  Command-line interface libraries use  to handle optional arguments.  This simplifies argument parsing but requires robust error handling to manage invalid or unexpected options.</p></li><li><p><strong>Machine Learning Preprocessing (Scikit-learn Pipelines):</strong>  Many Scikit-learn transformers accept  to configure their behavior.  This allows for customization but can make pipelines harder to debug if the configuration is not explicitly documented.</p></li></ol><h3>\n  \n  \n  Integration with Python Tooling\n</h3><p> integration with tooling is critical for maintaining code quality.</p><ul><li><p>  Without explicit type hints, mypy treats  as , effectively disabling static type checking.  Using  is a starting point, but ideally, you should define a more specific type using  or a Pydantic model.</p></li><li><p>  Parameterizing tests with  is common, but requires careful consideration of test coverage.  Ensure you test all possible combinations of keyword arguments.</p></li><li><p> Pydantic models can be used to validate  before passing them to functions. This provides a strong type safety net.</p></li><li><p> can define interfaces for functions accepting , enabling static analysis of expected arguments.</p></li><li><p>  Logging functions often accept  for custom formatting.  Be mindful of sensitive data being logged through these dynamic arguments.</p></li></ul><p><strong> example (mypy config):</strong></p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>This example demonstrates using a  for common configuration options and  for less frequent ones. This approach balances flexibility with type safety.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Failure Scenarios &amp; Debugging\n</h3><p>A common failure scenario is passing unexpected keyword arguments to a function. This can lead to  exceptions or, worse, silent failures if the function ignores the extra arguments.</p><div><pre><code>TypeError: process_data() got an unexpected keyword argument 'invalid_param'\n</code></pre></div><p>Debugging -related issues can be challenging.   is useful for inspecting the contents of the  dictionary at runtime.   can track the values of keyword arguments as they are passed to functions.   can identify performance bottlenecks caused by dynamic attribute access. Runtime assertions can validate the presence and type of expected arguments.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Performance &amp; Scalability\n</h3><p>The dynamic nature of  introduces performance overhead.  Attribute access on dictionaries is slower than direct attribute access on objects.  In performance-critical sections of code, avoid excessive use of .  Consider using explicit parameters or data classes instead.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>This demonstrates that  is significantly faster than .</p><p> can introduce security vulnerabilities if used improperly.  Specifically, deserializing untrusted data into  can lead to code injection or privilege escalation.  Always validate and sanitize input before passing it to functions via .  Avoid using  or  with data from .</p><p>Testing -based functions requires comprehensive test coverage.  Use property-based testing (e.g., Hypothesis) to generate a wide range of input values.  Use type validation tools (e.g., Pydantic) to ensure that the arguments passed to functions are of the correct type.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><h3>\n  \n  \n  Common Pitfalls &amp; Anti-Patterns\n</h3><ol><li> Passing untrusted data directly into .</li><li> Using  when explicit parameters would be clearer.</li><li> Failing to use type hints with .</li><li>kwargs<strong>kwargs<code> to functions that also accept </code></strong>kwargs`, creating a complex and hard-to-debug call stack.</li><li><strong>Mutable Default Arguments:</strong> Using mutable default arguments in conjunction with .</li><li> Failing to document the expected keyword arguments.</li></ol><h3>\n  \n  \n  Best Practices &amp; Architecture\n</h3><ul><li> Always use type hints with , preferably with  or Pydantic models.</li><li>  Separate common configuration options from less frequent ones.</li><li> Validate and sanitize input before passing it to functions via .</li><li>  Design functions with a clear and well-defined interface.</li><li> Use configuration layering to manage different environments and settings.</li><li>  Use dependency injection to provide configuration options to functions.</li><li> Automate testing, linting, and type checking.</li></ul><p> is a powerful feature that can enhance the flexibility and extensibility of Python code.

However, as datasets grow exponentially in size and complexity, the performance limitations of Python's built-in data structures (like lists, dictionaries, and tuples) become apparent. While excellent for general-purpose programming, they are not optimized for large-scale numerical operations. Python lists, for instance, store heterogeneous data, meaning each element can be of a different type, requiring individual memory allocations and type checking during operations. This overhead significantly slows down computations on vast amounts of data.</p><p>To overcome these bottlenecks, the data science community embraced \"vectorized operations.\" This paradigm shifts from explicit looping over individual elements to applying operations on entire arrays or columns of data at once. This approach leverages highly optimized, often compiled, underlying implementations, leading to dramatic performance improvements.</p><p>NumPy Arrays: The Foundation of Numerical Computing</p><p>At the heart of high-performance numerical computing in Python lies NumPy, and its fundamental data structure, the  (N-dimensional array). Unlike Python lists, NumPy arrays store homogeneous data (all elements are of the same type) contiguously in memory. This contiguous storage is crucial because it allows CPUs to perform operations on chunks of data efficiently, leveraging modern processor architectures and SIMD (Single Instruction, Multiple Data) instructions.</p><p>Consider a simple arithmetic operation on a large dataset:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>You'll observe that the NumPy operation completes significantly faster. This efficiency is why NumPy arrays are the bedrock for almost all numerical and scientific computing libraries in Python. For more details on NumPy, refer to the <a href=\"https://numpy.org/doc/stable/user/absolute_beginners.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">NumPy Documentation</a>.</p><p>Pandas DataFrames and Series: Structured Data Powerhouse</p><p>Building directly on NumPy arrays, Pandas provides powerful, high-level data structures for structured data: the DataFrame and Series. A Pandas Series can be thought of as a single column of data, essentially an enhanced NumPy array with an associated label (index). A DataFrame, then, is a collection of Series objects, sharing a common index, forming a tabular data structure with labeled rows and columns.</p><p>While Pandas DataFrames don't implement columnar storage in the same strict sense as some other systems (like Apache Arrow, which we'll discuss next), they conceptually operate very efficiently on columns. Each column in a DataFrame is typically a NumPy array, allowing Pandas to leverage NumPy's vectorized operations for common data manipulation tasks like filtering, aggregation, and transformations. This design makes Pandas incredibly efficient for data cleaning, transformation, and analysis.</p><p>Common operations in Pandas, such as , , or , are highly optimized under the hood, making complex data workflows surprisingly fast. The design allows for intuitive and readable code while maintaining strong performance for most data science tasks. Dive deeper into its capabilities with the <a href=\"https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Pandas Documentation</a>.</p><p>Apache Arrow: The Game Changer for Interoperability and Performance</p><p>As data science workflows became more complex, involving multiple languages and systems (e.g., Python for analysis, Spark for big data processing, R for statistics), the need for an efficient and standardized in-memory data format emerged. This led to Apache Arrow.</p><p>Apache Arrow is not a data structure library in the traditional sense, but rather a language-agnostic, columnar memory format. It defines a standard way to represent tabular data in memory, enabling zero-copy data exchange between different systems and programming languages (Python, R, Java, C++, etc.). This eliminates the costly serialization/deserialization overhead that typically occurs when data moves between different environments.</p><p>Libraries like Pandas (especially with its newer \"Arrow backend\" option) and Polars leverage Arrow to significantly improve performance and reduce memory footprint, particularly when dealing with mixed-type data or large strings. For instance, converting a Pandas DataFrame to an Arrow Table is efficient because both are designed to work with columnar data principles.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>This seamless conversion highlights Arrow's role in facilitating high-performance data pipelines across disparate tools. Learn more about its capabilities at the <a href=\"https://arrow.apache.org/docs/python/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Apache Arrow Documentation</a>.</p><p>Polars: The Blazing-Fast DataFrame Library (Rust-powered)</p><p>Polars is a relatively new, yet incredibly powerful, DataFrame library that has gained significant traction for its blazing speed and memory efficiency. Written in Rust, it leverages the performance benefits of a compiled language while providing a Pythonic API. Polars is built natively on Apache Arrow, which is a key factor in its high performance.</p><p>Key features of Polars include:</p><ul><li> Operations are not executed immediately but are instead built into a query plan, allowing Polars to optimize the execution order and reduce redundant computations.</li><li> Polars encourages an expressive, functional style of data manipulation, which can lead to more readable and performant code.</li><li><strong>Native Apache Arrow Integration:</strong> By using Arrow as its in-memory format, Polars benefits from efficient data storage and zero-copy operations.</li></ul><p>Let's look at a comparative benchmark between Pandas and Polars for a moderately complex data transformation:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>The performance difference, especially on larger datasets, can be substantial, making Polars an attractive option for data scientists dealing with performance-critical applications.

This is where Narwhals comes in. Narwhals is an emerging project that aims to provide a unified API across different DataFrame libraries. Its goal is to allow developers to write code that is agnostic to the underlying DataFrame implementation, making it easier to switch between backends (e.g., Pandas, Polars, Modin, cuDF) based on specific performance needs or deployment environments without rewriting significant portions of the codebase.</p><p>By offering a common interface, Narwhals simplifies the development of libraries and applications that need to be compatible with various DataFrame frameworks, fostering greater interoperability and reducing the learning curve for users transitioning between them.

Each of these tools offers distinct advantages and caters to specific use cases:</p><ul><li><strong>Standard Python Data Structures (lists, dictionaries):</strong> Ideal for general-purpose programming, small datasets, and when data heterogeneity is a requirement. They offer flexibility but lack the performance for large-scale numerical computations.</li><li> The fundamental building block for numerical computing. Essential for any task involving large, homogeneous numerical arrays where vectorized operations are key to performance.</li><li><strong>Pandas DataFrames and Series:</strong> Your go-to for structured data manipulation, cleaning, and analysis. They provide a rich, intuitive API built on top of NumPy's efficiency, suitable for most medium to large datasets.</li><li> Crucial for interoperability and efficient data exchange between different systems and languages, especially in big data ecosystems. It underpins many modern high-performance libraries.</li><li> An excellent choice when raw speed and memory efficiency are paramount, particularly for very large datasets or complex transformations. Its Rust backend and lazy evaluation offer significant performance gains over traditional Pandas for certain workloads.</li></ul><p>Understanding these specialized data structures and their underlying mechanisms is vital for any Python developer looking to optimize their data processing workflows and stay at the forefront of the data science ecosystem. The right tool, applied judiciously, can unlock significant performance improvements and enable the tackling of increasingly complex data challenges.

On the surface, both get the job done — but under the hood, they’re built for different worlds. In this blog, we’ll break down the real-world <strong>differences between Bash and Python scripting</strong>, their  and most importantly — <strong>when you should use each.</strong></p></blockquote><p>Scripting, at its core, is about giving your computer a to-do list — a set of instructions it can follow automatically, step by step. Think of it like writing a recipe: instead of telling a person how to cook a dish, you’re telling the computer how to carry out a task.</p><p>Let’s be honest — nobody enjoys doing the same repetitive tasks every day. Whether it’s moving files, cleaning up logs, or setting up your dev environment for the 10th time this week, it gets old fast. That’s where scripting comes in — and it’s a total game changer.</p><p>Scripting is like giving your computer a checklist and saying, “You handle this. I’ve got better things to do.” Once you write a script, it takes over the boring stuff — no complaints, no forgetfulness, just results. Scripting helps you reduce errors, save time, and focus on the stuff that actually matters. Trust me the moment you start automating even the smallest tasks, you’ll wonder how you ever lived without it.</p><blockquote><p><strong>Some of the most popular scripting languages include:</strong></p></blockquote><ul><li> for system tasks on Unix/Linux.</li><li> for more complex automation and cross-platform scripting.</li><li> for client-side browser scripting.</li><li> for automation in Windows environments.</li></ul><p>Bash () is the default shell on most Linux distributions and macOS. It’s designed to interact directly with the operating system. Think of Bash as a glue that connects other CLI tools together.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  What Makes Bash So Special?\n</h2><p>Bash isn’t just that black box you type commands into — it’s much more than that. It’s like your backstage pass to the entire operating system. With Bash, you’re not just running commands, you’re  them,  them, and  them like a pro.</p><p>Think of Bash as your personal assistant for the command line. You can write a small script to do boring, repetitive things — like moving files, cleaning up folders, or checking system health — and Bash will handle it all for you, without breaking a sweat.</p><p>The real magic? Bash lets you glue together tons of other tools — like , , , , , and . On their own, these tools are powerful. But with Bash, you can make them work together like a well-rehearsed orchestra. One command filters, another searches, another renames — and Bash makes it all flow smoothly in just a few lines of script.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Advantages of Bash Scripting\n</h2><ol><li>Perfect for interacting with the OS, managing files, users, permissions, services, etc.</li><li>Executes quickly with minimal overhead — ideal for short scripts or quick fixes.</li><li>Easily connects tools like , , , , etc. in one-liners or scripts.</li><li>No need for setup — just open the terminal and start scripting.</li><li>Bash is often the go-to choice for scheduled tasks and sysadmin routines.</li></ol><h2>\n  \n  \n  Few Common Bash Commands :\n</h2><ol><li> — it is a command that is used to List Directory , Files and also Folders in long format (with all the permissions , Date and size)\n</li></ol><ol><li>cd — it is a command which is used to change a directory or also move from one directory to an another .\n</li></ol><p>Use  to go up one level, or  alone to return to your home directory.</p><ol><li> — this is used to create a New Empty File . For example shown below it creates a text file called </li></ol><ol><li> — its the most commonly used command when your required to make a Directory because without making a directory you can’t survive. Now in the below example it creates a () called </li></ol><ol><li> — used to remove Files or Directories recursively and forcefully . But be carefull because there’s </li></ol><ol><li> — this is used to Copy Files or Folders into your desired location or directory. Use  for copying directories: </li></ol><ol><li> — . You can also use it to rename: <code>mv oldname.txt newname.txt</code> .\n</li></ol><div><pre><code>mv data.csv archive/data.csv\n</code></pre></div><ol><li> — commanly used to display the content or Print something in the Terminal. For an example  would be printed onto the screen.\n</li></ol><ol><li> — this command is used to view File Contents with opening the file itself .\n</li></ol><ol><li> — command mainly used for searching or matching. Used for Text in files, file names present inside a directory.\n</li></ol><h2>\n  \n  \n  Python Scripting — The Swiss Army Knife of Automation\n</h2><p>Python wasn’t built solely for scripting, but it’s one of the best tools out there when it comes to getting things done efficiently. It’s like that reliable friend who somehow knows how to fix your Wi-Fi, automate your spreadsheet, and build a website — all before lunch. The beauty of Python lies in its readability and simplicity. You don’t need to write 20 lines of code to do something basic. Want to rename 500 files? Scrape data from a website? Monitor a folder for changes? Python makes all of that feel incredibly straightforward.</p><p>And thanks to its massive library ecosystem — from  and  for file handling, to  for working with APIs, to  for data wrangling — you rarely start from scratch. It’s versatile enough to automate daily tasks, yet powerful enough to build entire applications. Whether you’re a beginner writing your first script or a pro building robust automation pipelines, Python is the kind of language that scales with you — and always has your back.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  What Makes Python So Special?\n</h2><p>Python is special because it’s simple, powerful, and insanely versatile. The code reads like plain English, so it’s easy to learn and easy to remember. Whether you’re automating tasks, building websites, crunching data, or diving into AI — Python can handle it all. Plus, with thousands of libraries, there’s a tool for pretty much anything you want to do. It’s the kind of language that grows with you, no matter where you start.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Advantages of Python Scripting\n</h2><ol><li> Clean syntax that feels like English — great for beginners and large teams.</li><li> From file handling to web scraping to machine learning — there’s a library for almost everything.</li><li><p>Perfect for logic-heavy tasks, data manipulation, API integration, and beyond.</p></li><li><p>Python scripts run smoothly on Windows, macOS, and Linux.\nYou can start with a simple script and grow it into a full-blown application.</p></li></ol><h2>\n  \n  \n  Few Common Python Commands :\n</h2><ol><li> — command used to displays text or variables on the screen.\n</li></ol><ol><li> — commonly used to take input from the user_._\n</li></ol><div><pre><code>name = input(\"What's your name? \")\n</code></pre></div><ol><li> — Returns the length of a string, list, or other data types.\n</li></ol><ol><li> — Tells you the data type (e.g., int, str, list).\n</li></ol><ol><li> —Generates a sequence of numbers, often used in loops_._\n</li></ol><div><pre><code>for i in range(5):\n    print(i)\n</code></pre></div><ol><li>, ,  — command widely used for decision-making in your script. It’s outcome solely depends on the conditions.\n</li></ol><div><pre><code>if age &lt; 18:\n    print(\"Minor\")\nelse:\n    print(\"Adult\")\n</code></pre></div><ol><li> — Used to define functions (reusable blocks of code).\n</li></ol><div><pre><code>def greet():\n    print(\"Hello!\")\n</code></pre></div><ol><li> — Lets you use built-in or used to extract the external modules\n</li></ol><div><pre><code>import math\nprint(math.sqrt(25))\n</code></pre></div><ol><li> — Adds an item to the end of a list_._\n</li></ol><div><pre><code>fruits = [\"apple\", \"banana\"]\nfruits.append(\"orange\")\n</code></pre></div><ol><li> — Opens a file for reading or writing\n</li></ol><div><pre><code>file = open(\"data.txt\", \"r\")\n</code></pre></div><h2>\n  \n  \n  Python vs Bash — Side-by-Side Example\n</h2><ul><li><strong>files and count how many lines contain the word “error”</strong></li></ul><div><pre><code>#!/bin/bash\nfor file in *.log; do\n  echo \"$file: $(grep -i error \"$file\" | wc -l) error(s)\"\ndone\n</code></pre></div><div><pre><code>#!/usr/bin/env python3\nimport glob\nfor file in glob.glob(\"*.log\"):\n    with open(file, \"r\") as f:\n        count = sum(1 for line in f if \"error\" in line.lower())\n    print(f\"{file}: {count} error(s)\")\n</code></pre></div><ul><li>  Bash is concise, efficient, and perfect for file processing.</li><li>  Python is clearer, easier to maintain, and handles edge cases more gracefully.</li></ul><h2>\n  \n  \n  When to Use Bash vs Python: The Right Tool for the Right Task\n</h2><p>Let’s be real — when you’re diving into scripting, it’s not about which language is better. It’s about <strong>which one makes your life easier for the task you’re tackling</strong>.</p><p>If you’re working closely with the , Bash is often your best friend. It’s great for those quick-and-dirty tasks like moving files around, starting or stopping services, scheduling cron jobs, or stringing together commands with pipes. Bash is fast, lightweight, and made for interacting with the shell. It really shines in , like managing EC2 instances, running shell scripts during deployments, or automating things through AWS CLI.</p><p>Now, if your task involves <strong>more logic or data crunching</strong>, Python is the way to go. Need to parse a massive log file? Read and write JSON or CSV? Call APIs? Handle errors gracefully and keep your script maintainable? Python does all that and more. It’s clean, powerful, and has a huge set of libraries that make complex tasks feel simple. It’s also great if your script might evolve into something bigger over time — like a command-line tool, automation framework, or even a web service.</p><p>Sometimes, though, the smartest move is to use . For example, you might use a Bash script to keep an eye on your system, and then let Python jump in when there’s real work to do — like processing data or sending out a notification. It’s a powerful combo: Bash handles the grunt work, Python brings the brains.</p><p>So here’s the bottom line:</p><ul><li> when you’re doing quick shell-level stuff.</li><li> when your logic gets heavier or your task gets smarter.</li></ul><p>Choosing between Bash and Python isn’t about picking a winner — it’s about using the right tool for the job.  is unbeatable for quick, low-level system tasks and chaining CLI commands like a pro.  steps in when your scripts need structure, logic, or cross-platform flexibility. In reality, the best automation setups often use , playing to each of their strengths. So instead of asking <em>“Which one should I learn?”</em>, ask <em>“When should I use which?”</em> Master both, and you won’t just write scripts — you’ll build smart, elegant solutions that actually make your life easier.</p>","contentLength":9965,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"🌿 Herbal Remedy Advisor – Grandma's Wisdom Meets LLMs","url":"https://dev.to/avradeep_nayak_fa8d5f6995/herbal-remedy-advisor-grandmas-wisdom-meets-llms-2loj","date":1750491468,"author":"Avradeep Nayak","guid":164096,"unread":true,"content":"<p>“Because your grandma’s tea deserves LLM-level respect.”</p><p>A few weeks ago, while sipping ginger tea during a coding session (thanks, Grandma!), a curious thought struck me:\nWhat if ancient herbal remedies could be queried like ChatGPT?<p>\nWhat if we could combine AI, semantic search, and knowledge graphs to revive traditional wisdom in a modern, developer-friendly way?</p></p><p>That's how Herbal Remedy Advisor was born. 💡</p><p>🔮 Meet the App\nHerbal Remedy Advisor is an AI-powered herbal medicine search engine.

You wouldn't just recall each word in isolation; you'd focus on key details, discarding less important information, and linking events together to understand the narrative. This is similar to what Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) strive for in the world of artificial intelligence, but traditional RNNs often struggle with remembering information over long periods. This is where Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) networks come in, offering powerful solutions to this \"long-term memory\" problem.</p><p>These specialized RNN architectures are crucial for processing sequential data – anything with an order, like text, speech, time series data (stock prices, weather patterns), and even video. They overcome the limitations of basic RNNs by incorporating sophisticated \"gates\" that control the flow of information, allowing them to learn long-range dependencies – connections between events separated by significant time gaps.</p><p><strong>Understanding the Core Concepts:  LSTMs and GRUs</strong></p><p>Think of a basic RNN as a conveyor belt carrying information. Each item on the belt is processed, but the belt's capacity to remember earlier items is limited; they get progressively overwritten. LSTMs and GRUs add a more complex system of storage and retrieval, like adding memory compartments to our conveyor belt.</p><p><strong>LSTM: The Master of Memory Management</strong></p><p>An LSTM network uses three gates:</p><ul><li> Decides what new information should be stored in the cell state (our long-term memory).  It acts like a filter, selecting only the most relevant information.</li><li> Decides what information should be removed from the cell state.  Think of this as discarding irrelevant or outdated details.</li><li> Decides what information from the cell state should be passed on to the next step in the network.  It carefully selects and shares only the necessary information.</li></ul><p>This intricate system allows LSTMs to remember information for extended periods, even across long sequences, making them adept at handling complex patterns. Imagine remembering the beginning of a long sentence while processing the end; an LSTM can do this effectively.</p><p><strong>GRU: A Simpler, Yet Powerful Alternative</strong></p><p>The GRU, a more recent innovation, simplifies the LSTM architecture by combining the forget and input gates into a single \"update gate.\" This makes GRUs computationally less expensive and faster to train than LSTMs, while still retaining impressive performance in many applications. While less complex, GRUs still possess the ability to selectively remember and forget information, effectively learning long-range dependencies.</p><p><strong>The Significance and Impact</strong></p><p>The ability to effectively process sequential data has revolutionized several fields. LSTMs and GRUs are responsible for many breakthroughs in:</p><ul><li><strong>Natural Language Processing (NLP):</strong>  Machine translation, sentiment analysis, text summarization, and chatbot development all benefit significantly from these architectures.  They allow for a deeper understanding of context and meaning in text.</li><li>  Accurately transcribing spoken language, even in noisy environments, is made possible by the ability of LSTMs and GRUs to model the temporal dynamics of speech.</li><li>  Predicting future values based on historical data, whether it's stock prices, weather patterns, or energy consumption, is enhanced by these networks' capacity for long-term memory.</li><li>  Understanding and classifying actions within video sequences relies heavily on these architectures' ability to process temporal information.</li></ul><p><strong>Challenges, Limitations, and Ethical Considerations</strong></p><p>Despite their power, LSTMs and GRUs face challenges:</p><ul><li> Training these models, especially on large datasets, can be computationally expensive and time-consuming.</li><li><strong>Vanishing/Exploding Gradients:</strong>  While mitigated compared to basic RNNs, the problem of gradients becoming too small or too large during training can still hinder performance.</li><li> Understanding  an LSTM or GRU makes a particular prediction can be difficult, hindering trust and accountability in certain applications.</li><li>  If the training data contains biases, the model will learn and perpetuate those biases, leading to unfair or discriminatory outcomes.  Careful data curation and bias mitigation techniques are crucial.</li></ul><p><strong>Looking Ahead: The Future of LSTMs and GRUs</strong></p><p>LSTMs and GRUs have undeniably transformed the landscape of AI. While challenges remain, ongoing research focuses on improving their efficiency, interpretability, and robustness. We can expect further advancements in their applications, leading to more sophisticated and impactful AI systems across various industries. The ability to effectively manage and utilize information over time, a core strength of these architectures, will continue to be a cornerstone of future AI development. As we continue to push the boundaries of what's possible with these powerful tools, careful consideration of ethical implications and responsible development will be paramount to ensuring their beneficial application for society.</p>","contentLength":4990,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"📝 Beginner-Friendly Guide \"Minimum Deletions to Make String K-Special\" LeetCode 3085 (C++ | Python | JavaScript)","url":"https://dev.to/om_shree_0709/beginner-friendly-guide-minimum-deletions-to-make-string-k-special-leetcode-3085-c-python-2dn7","date":1750469113,"author":"Om Shree","guid":163949,"unread":true,"content":"<p> |  | <strong>Greedy + Frequency Analysis</strong></p><ul><li>A string  consisting of lowercase letters.</li></ul><p>A string is  if for every pair of characters ,  in the string:</p><div><pre><code>|freq(word[i]) - freq(word[j])| &lt;= k\n</code></pre></div><p>Your task is to <strong>minimize the number of deletions</strong> required to make  k-special.</p><p>To make a string k-special, the difference between the <strong>maximum and minimum frequency</strong> of any two letters should be ≤ .</p><ul><li>Count the frequency of each character.</li><li>Try to  frequencies around every possible frequency value.</li><li>For each candidate frequency , adjust higher values to be ≤ , and remove characters with frequency less than  completely.</li></ul><p>This problem becomes a greedy scan over frequency values to find the configuration with .</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><ul><li>Frequencies are sorted for easier range-based analysis.</li><li>Try making every valid  the base frequency.</li><li>If any frequency is too large, trim it down; if too small, delete it.</li><li>Time Complexity: O(26^2) ~= O(1)</li></ul><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><ul><li>The power of  and .</li><li>How to turn a \"global condition\" (equalizing freq) into a  via range loops.</li></ul><ul><li>Frequency array manipulation</li><li>Greedy analysis on sorted data</li></ul><p>Drop a ❤️ if this helped, and stay tuned for more algorithm insights and optimizations!</p>","contentLength":1120,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Build Your Own Local License Server for Popular Software (Windows Setup Guide)","url":"https://dev.to/roman_muslikhov_2ab4ae3a2/build-your-own-local-license-server-for-popular-software-windows-setup-guide-4omk","date":1750460498,"author":"Roman Muslikhov","guid":163921,"unread":true,"content":"<blockquote><p>Full version originally published on <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/verification-server-roman-muslikhov-4l7tc/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">LinkedIn</a></p></blockquote><p>In today’s digital ecosystem...</p>","contentLength":78,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Query YAML Like a Database — Why I Built YamlQL (And How It Works)","url":"https://dev.to/sarav_ak/query-yaml-like-a-database-why-i-built-yamlql-and-how-it-works-4hfg","date":1750456978,"author":"Sarav AK","guid":163899,"unread":true,"content":"<p>Have you ever tried to grep through large set of Kubernetes YAML files just to figure out which pods are missing CPU limits?</p><p>So I built <a href=\"https://github.com/AKSarav/YamlQL/tree/main\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">YamlQL</a> — a tool that lets you query YAML files using SQL.</p><p>YAMLQL has three mode of opeartions</p><ul><li>Discover the schema of your YAML file</li><li>Run manual SQL queries over YAML</li><li>Use AI to generate SQL (schema-aware, no data sent)</li></ul><p>YamlQL is a CLI + Python tool that converts YAML into DuckDB tables, so you can query it like a database.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  😵‍💫 YAML is beautiful until it is not\n</h3><p>YAML is beautiful for humans to write — but a nightmare to audit or analyze at scale.

Whether you are using tools like Claude Desktop, ChatGPT, Cursor, Cline, Postman, you name it; If a developer can plug in an MCP to it, they will. Having built a number of MCP servers recently at <a href=\"https://airbyte.io\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Airbyte</a>, and running my own side hustle at <a href=\"https://mycaminoguide.com\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">mycaminoguide.com</a> as an AI agent for the past year, I've learned a few things about what it really takes to build and run MCP servers. </p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Know the main components of an MCP server.\n</h3><p>This might sound obvious, but knowing the main components of an MCP server is incredibly helpful as you build your own. It gives you a roadmap on what and how you want to implement services, and will save you significant time trying to custom code your own solutions when you should have used native MCP decorators and support.</p><ul><li>\nTools are functions clients can call to perform an action. Tools are what show up in something like Cursor. When designing an MCP, I typically start by thinking about the domain I want to work in. eg: functions a developer needs when working with my product, or calendar functions etc. From there I have a scope and can decide what actaul functions are available. If I find I am exceeding the domain, I typically create a separate MCP server. </li></ul><ul><li>\nResources allow your client to return specific data based on parameters. Resources are very helpful if your MCP service is going to perform some sort of query on a backend system. eg: My MCP offers a calendar service and I want to pass in a particular date to get availability.\n</li></ul><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><ul><li>\nPrompts are messages templates that include parameterized values that you can pass to an LLM to perform a query. I use prompts extensively within the PyAirbyte MCP server to allow the user to specify source and destination connectors. The MCP server then uses a consistent prompt and the OpenAI chat completion API to query the vector store for highly relevant results.</li></ul><h2>\n  \n  \n  Understand the Transports\n</h2><p>Clients support different transports depending on your deployment model. </p><p>If you are running locally, the transport is going to be stdio. Effectively, you configuring your mcp to execute a shell command to run a local file. I use stdio MCP services that I have built to help me automate frequent daily tasks such as checking the health of pipelines, looking at usage analytics, slack summaries etc from within Claude Desktop. I wouldn't recommend stdio for broader developer community facing tools. There is too much local config that the user needs to manage.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Server Sent Events, or SSE, is the original transport for remote MCP servers. MCP servers built using this model require you to run a server such as Express or FastMCP to serve endpoints, both a POST and GET. Remote servers in general are not supported by Claude Desktop, but are supported in Cursor and Cline, although there are limitations, which I'll cover shortly. If you are starting to write MCP servers today, I would not recommend using SSE transports as they have been deprecated in favor of Streamable transports.</p><p>Streamable HTTP transports removes the need to create two endpoints - a POST and GET - like you see in SSE transports and are slightly more complex to set up. Once you do have them configured though, there is a lot of benefits through scalability and resumable connections. In addition, they can work stateless meaning you can deploy them quite easily on Vercel vs. SSE services which you need to deploy on something like Railway or Heroku. The downside is that the Streamable HTTP transport is very new with Client tool vendors only now implementing it. There are positive sign though that this transport will become the most dominant. I've already see Claude Code implement a  parameter, for example.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Most of my MCP development is done in python. Thankfully, there is a rich ecosystem of libraries available to that make working with MCP much easier. </p><p>FastMCP is the defacto standard. It is fully spec-compliant, supports streaming transport, and is easily deployed.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>It's been interesting to see OpenAI support a competitors 'standard' (Anthrophic were the original authors of the MCP spec). As a heavy user of the Responses API in mycaminoguide.com, I've been excited to see that <a href=\"https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/tools-remote-mcp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">models can now use MCP servers to perform tasks</a>. Currently the implementation doesn't feel very natural and there it's overly complex but the idea of an agent or model using my MCP server has me watching this space closely. Google is also pushing the same approach with their <a href=\"https://google.github.io/adk-docs/tools/mcp-tools/?utm_source=chatgpt.com#step-3-run-adk-web-and-interact\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Agent SDK</a>. </p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Not all Clients are created equal\n</h2><p>When it client tools such as Claude Desktop, Cline, and Cursor, etc, the level of support for the MCP spec, and how this is represented in the mcp.json a user needs to add to connect a server can often lead to wasted time trying to figure out why an error is being raised. I have not found a centralized place where these differences are listed. Here are the ones I have encountered</p><ul><li>Local MCP server support: Claude Desktop, Cline, Cursor, Claude Code. </li><li>Remote MCP server support: Cline, Cursor, Claude Code</li><li>Remote MCP server passing env in mcp.json: Cursor, Claude Code</li></ul><p>The remote MCP server with support for passing environment variables is a interesting case. For example, we just deployed an MCP server for <a href=\"https://airbyte.com/product/pyairbyte\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">PyAirbyte</a>. This server uses openAI and a vector store to generate data pipelines. It is deployed on Heroku. As part of the client config, we require that you pass in your OpenAI API key. This works great within Cursor, but unfortunately it not supported in Cline. You can, of course, add values to a serverside .env file, but we did not want to do this due to the risk of someone spamming the MCP server and running up a bit OpenAI bill.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>MCP protocols are still evolving. Change is constant and can be frustrating when building services. Sometimes logging errors are not very helpful, and LLMs like ChatGPT often send you down a rabbit hole, only to find out that the spec has changed and the LLM doesn't have the most recent information. Vibe coding MCP servers can be an exercise in frustration. I hope these tips help you get started in building your own MCP servers and avoid some of the pitfalls I made when starting out. </p>","contentLength":6138,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"The Python Coding Stack: I Want to Remove Duplicates from a Python List • How Do I Do It?","url":"https://www.thepythoncodingstack.com/p/remove-duplicates-from-python-list","date":1750444612,"author":"","guid":163807,"unread":true,"content":"<p>Another short article today to figure out ways to remove duplicate values from a list. The ideal solution depends on what you really need.</p><p>Well, we need a list first–ideally, one with duplicate values. So, let's assume we have an online queue (line). But some people put their name in the queue more than once:</p><div><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!GBYN!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1f0fdbcb-7236-4635-9713-4d0459488b9d_1272x168.png\"></a>All code blocks are available in text format at the end of this article • #1 • <em>The code images used in this article are created using <a href=\"https://snappify.cello.so/f4AsFrwgwov\">Snappify</a>. [Affiliate link]</em></div><p>Note how James and Kate were eager to ensure they were in the queue, so they put their name down twice.</p><h2><strong>Removing Duplicates: The Ugly Way</strong></h2><p>I was initially tempted not to include this section, but I changed my mind, as you can see. You can come up with several algorithms to perform this task \"manually\". It's only a few lines of code. Here's one option:</p><p>You have a  empty list ready to collect unique names. Next, you iterate using  and add names to  if they don't appear in the rest of the original list. Note that I'm using <a href=\"https://www.thepythoncodingstack.com/p/a-python-slicing-story\">slicing</a> in the  statement to slice the list from  to the end of the list.</p><p>Let me show you another option. I'll discuss the outputs from these two manual versions later in this article:</p><p>This time, you reverse the list so you can loop through the names in reverse order. The  doesn't start as an empty list this time but as a copy of the original reversed list.</p><p>In the loop, you remove names from  if the name appears later in the reversed list. A reminder that the  list method only removes the first occurrence of an item. It doesn't remove all of them.</p><p>Both algorithms remove duplicates. Great. But compare the output from the two versions. The difference between these output lists gives a clue to what's coming next.</p><p>But I won't dwell on these versions any longer.</p><p><em>and PS: there are better versions of manual algorithms for this, but that's not the point of this first section, so let's move on!</em></p><h2><strong>Removing Duplicates: The Set Way</strong></h2><p>When you learn about data structures, you learn about the various characteristics they have. Then, you start comparing data structures based on these characteristics. For example, lists, dictionaries, tuples, and strings are all <a href=\"https://www.thepythoncodingstack.com/p/python-iterable-data-structures\">iterable</a>. But lists and dictionaries are mutable, whereas tuples and strings are immutable. And lists, tuples, and strings are all <a href=\"https://www.thepythoncodingstack.com/p/sequences-in-python-data-structure-2\">sequences</a>, but dictionaries are not–they're <a href=\"https://www.thepythoncodingstack.com/p/mappings-in-python-data-structure-3\">mappings</a>. You can read more about some of these categories here: <a href=\"https://www.thepythoncodingstack.com/p/the-main-data-structure-categories\">The Python Data Structure Categories Series</a></p><p>And some data structures enforce uniqueness while others don't. Lists, as you've seen above, can have several equal items–in the example above, you have several strings that are equal to each other.</p><p>However, sets are a Python data structure that can only have unique values:</p><p>So, the easiest way to remove duplicates from a list is to cast it into a set:</p><p>Or, if you prefer the output to still be a list, and perhaps you also want to overwrite the original variable name, then you can write the following:</p><p>Now, that was easy! Much better than the several lines of code in the previous section.</p><p>However, there's an issue. If this is a queue of customers, then the order in which they joined the queue is somewhat important, I would say!</p><p>Note how the new  list, the one without duplicates, no longer maintains the original order of the people within it. James was the first to join the queue, but Andy appears to have moved to the front when you removed duplicates.</p><p>Note that this also happened with the first of the manual algorithms in the previous section.</p><p>Sometimes, you don't care about the order of the elements in a list. If that's the case, you can cast the list into a set and then back into a list to remove duplicates.</p><p>But sometimes, the order matters. It certainly matters when dealing with a queue of customers. Let's look at another option.</p><h2><strong>Removing Duplicates: The Dictionary Way</strong></h2><p>If you haven't, now is a good time to read it. Like this one, it's a short article, so it won't take you too long.</p><p>So, you now know that since Python 3.7, there's a guarantee that the order of insertion of items in a dictionary is maintained. And dictionary keys must also be unique–you cannot have the same key appear twice in a dictionary.</p><p>Therefore, if you could create a dictionary from the elements in the list , you would remove duplicates but also maintain the order. And there's a dictionary class method for that:</p><p>You create a dictionary from the list . The items in the list become keys, and each key has a default value of . You can customise this default value, but you don't need to in this case, as you'll see in the next paragraph.</p><p>Great, you removed duplicates while maintaining order since dictionaries maintain order. The dictionary is created by iterating through the list, which explains why this version maintains the order of the items. But you don't want a dictionary, and you don't care about the values within it. So, you can cast this dictionary back into a list. You only keep the keys when you cast a dictionary into a list:</p><p>You've now removed duplicates from the list  maintained the original order by converting the list into a dictionary and then back into a list.</p><p>Simple–once you know this idiom.</p><p><em>Do you want to join a forum to discuss Python further with other Pythonistas?

Your support will help me keep this content coming regularly and, importantly, will help keep it free for everyone.</em></p><p>Both the set and dictionary routes have an important limitation. Items in a set must be hashable objects. And keys in a dictionary must also be hashable. Therefore, you can't use these techniques if you have a list that includes non-hashable objects, such as a list that contains other lists.</p><p>You may need to remove duplicates from a list in Python.</p><p>Don't write your own algorithm. Life's too short for that.</p><p>If you don't care about the order of the items in the list, cast the list into a set and then back into a list: </p><p>If you  care about the order, create a dictionary from the list using  and then cast it back into a list: <code>list(dict.fromkeys(queue))</code>.</p><p>And the set and dictionary routes to removing duplicates are also more efficient than the manual ones shown above.

In reality, they are your proactive sidekicks that can streamline complex workflows and eliminate repetitive tasks. Think of them as the next evolutionary step beyond chatbots: they do not just simply wait for prompts; they , coordinate multiple steps, and adapt as they go.</p><p>Back in the day, crafting a “smart” system meant juggling separate models for language understanding, code generation, data lookup, you name it, and then duct-taping them together. Half of your time used to vanish in integration hell, whereas the other half you spent debugging the glue.</p><p>Agents flip that script. They bundle context, initiative, and adaptability into a single orchestrated flow. It is not just automation; it is intelligence with a mission. And thanks to such frameworks as , assembling an agent squad of your own can actually be… dare I say, fun?  </p><h2>\n  \n  \n  What Is LangGraph, Exactly?\n</h2><p>LangGraph is an innovative framework that revolutionizes the way we build complex applications involving Large Language Models (LLMs).</p><p>Imagine that you are conducting an orchestra: every instrument (or “node”) needs to know when to play, how loud, and in what sequence.  in this case** is your baton, giving you the following:</p><ul><li>: It employs a graph-like structure with nodes and edges, enabling developers to design flexible, non-linear workflows that accommodate branches and loops. It mirrors complex decision-making processes resembling the way neural pathways might work.\n</li><li>: LangGraph offers built-in tools for state persistence and error recovery, simplifying the maintenance of contextual data across various stages within an application. It can effectively switch between short-term and long-term memory, enhancing interaction quality thanks to such tools as Zep.\n</li><li>: With LangGraph, LLM agents can easily collaborate with external services or databases to fetch real-world data, improving the functionality and responsiveness of your applications.\n</li><li>: Beyond automation, LangGraph accommodates human interventions in workflows, which are crucial for decision-making processes that require analytical oversight or ethical consideration.</li></ul><p>Whether you are building a chatbot with real memory, an interactive story engine, or a team of agents tackling a complex problem, LangGraph turns headache-inducing plumbing into a clean, visual state machine.</p><p>To start with LangGraph, you will need a basic setup that typically involves installing such essential libraries as langgraph and langchain-openai. From there, you can define the nodes (tasks) and edges (connections) within the graph, effectively implementing checkpoints for short-term memory and utilizing Zep for more persistent memory needs.</p><p>When operating LangGraph, keep in mind the following:</p><ul><li>: Leverage the powerful graph structure to account for potential workflow branches and interactions that are not strictly linear.\n</li><li><strong>Interact with Tools Thoughtfully</strong>: Enhance but do not replace LLM capabilities with external tools. Provide each tool with comprehensive descriptions to enable precise usage.\n</li><li><strong>Employ Rich Memory Solutions</strong>: Use memory efficiently, be mindful of the LLM's context window, and consider integrating external solutions for automatic fact management.</li></ul><p>Now that we have covered the basics of LangGraph, let's dive into a practical example. To achieve this, we will develop an AI agent specifically designed for customer support.</p><p>This agent will receive email requests, analyze the problem description in the email body, and then determine the request's priority and appropriate topic/category/sector.</p><p>So buckle up and let's go!</p><p>To begin, we need to define what a 'Tool' is. You can think of it as a specialized \"assistant manager\" for your agent, allowing it to interact with external functionalities.</p><p>The  decorator is essential here. LangChain simplifies custom tool creation, meaning that first, you define a Python function, and then apply the  decorator.</p><p>Let's illustrate this by creating our first tool. This tool will help the agent classify the priority of an IT support ticket based on its email content:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Excellent! Now we have a prompt that instructs the AI to receive the email body, analyze it, and classify its priority as High, Medium, or Low.</p><p>That’s it! You have just composed a tool your agent can call!</p><p>Next, let's create a similar tool to identify the main topic (or category) of the support request:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Now we need to create a state, and in LangGraph this little piece is, kind of, a big deal.</p><p>Think of it as the central nervous system of your graph. It is how nodes talk to each other, passing notes like overachievers in class.</p><p>“A state is a shared data structure that represents the current snapshot of your application.”</p><p>In practice? The state is a structured message that moves between nodes. It carries the output of one step as the input for the next one. Basically, it is the glue that holds your entire workflow together.</p><p>Therefore, before constructing the graph, we must first define the structure of our state. In this example, our state will include the following:</p><ul><li>The user’s request (email body)\n</li><li>The identified topic (category)</li></ul><p>It is simple and clean, so you can move through the graph like a pro.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><h2>\n  \n  \n  Nodes vs. Edges: Key Components of LangGraph\n</h2><p>The fundamental building blocks of LangGraph include  and </p><ul><li>: They are the operational units within the graph, performing the actual work. A node typically consists of Python code that can execute any logic, ranging from computations to interactions with language models (LLMs) or external integrations. Essentially, nodes are like individual functions or agents in traditional programming.\n</li><li>: Edges define the flow of execution between nodes, determining what happens next. They act as the connectors that allow the state to transition from one node to another based on predefined conditions. In the context of LangGraph, edges are crucial in orchestrating the sequence and decision flow between nodes.</li></ul><p>To grasp the functionality of edges, let’s consider a simple analogy of a messaging application:</p><ul><li> are akin to users (or their devices) actively participating in a conversation.\n</li><li> symbolize the chat threads or connections between users that facilitate communication.</li></ul><p>When a user selects a chat thread to send a message, an edge is effectively created, linking them to another user. Each interaction, be it sending a text, voice, or video message, follows a predefined sequence, comparable to the structured schema of LangGraph’s state. It ensures uniformity and interpretability of data passed along edges.</p><p>Unlike the dynamic nature of event-driven applications, LangGraph employs a static schema that remains consistent throughout execution. It simplifies communication among nodes, enabling developers to rely on a stable state format, thereby ensuring seamless edge communication.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Designing a Basic Workflow\n</h2><p>Flow engineering in LangGraph can be conceptualized as designing a state machine. In this paradigm, each node represents a distinct state or processing step, while edges define the transitions between those states. This approach is particularly beneficial for developers aiming to strike a balance between deterministic task sequences and the dynamic decision-making capabilities of AI. Let's begin constructing our flow by initializing a StateGraph with the TicketState class we defined earlier.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>: Nodes are fundamental building blocks, defined to execute such specific tasks as classifying ticket priority or identifying its topic.</p><p>Each node function receives the current state, performs its operation, and returns a dictionary to update the state:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>The classify_priority_node and identify_topic_node methods will change the TicketState and send the parameter input.</p><p>: Define edges to connect nodes:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>The classify_priority establishes the start, whereas the identify_topic determines the end of our workflow so far.</p><p><strong>Compilation and Execution</strong>:  Once nodes and edges are configured, compile the workflow and execute it.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Great! You can also generate a visual representation of our LangGraph flow.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>If you were to run the code up to this point, you would observe a graph similar to the one below:</p><p>This illustration visualizes a sequential execution: start, followed by classifying priority, then identifying the topic, and, finally, ending.</p><p>One of the most powerful aspects of LangGraph is its flexibility, which allows us to create more complex flows and applications. For instance, we can modify the workflow to add edges from START to both nodes with the following line:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>This change will imply that the agent executes classify_priority and identify_topic simultaneously.</p><p>Another highly valuable feature in LangGraph is the ability to use conditional edges. They allow the workflow to branch based on the evaluation of the current state, enabling dynamic routing of tasks.</p><p>Let's enhance our workflow. We will create a new tool that analyzes the content, priority, and topic of the request to determine whether it is a high-priority issue requiring escalation (i.e., opening a ticket for a human team). If not, an automated response will be generated for the user.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Furthermore, if the request is determined to be of low or medium priority (leading to an \"auto_respond\" decision), we will perform a vector search to retrieve historical answers. This information will then be used to generate an appropriate automated response. However, it will require two additional tools:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Now, let's define the corresponding nodes for those new tools:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>The conditional edge will then use the output of the make_decision node to direct the flow:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>If the make_escalation_decision tool (via decision_node) results in \"auto_respond\", the workflow will proceed through the rag node (to retrieve examples), then to generate_reply (to craft the response), and finally to execute_action (to log the auto-response).</p><p>Conversely, if the decision is \"escalate\", the flow will bypass the RAG and take generation steps, moving directly to execute_action to handle the escalation. To complete the graph by adding the remaining standard edges, do the following:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><blockquote><p> For this project, the dataset we used to power the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) was sourced from the <a href=\"https://huggingface.co/datasets/Tobi-Bueck/customer-support-tickets\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Customer Support Tickets dataset on Hugging Face</a>. The dataset was filtered to include exclusively the items categorized as  and restricted to  entries. It ensured that the RAG system retrieved only highly relevant and domain-specific examples for technical support tasks.</p></blockquote><p>At this point, our graph should resemble the one below:</p><p>When you execute this graph with an email that results in a high priority classification and an \"escalate\" decision, you will see the following response:</p><p>At the same time, a request that is classified as low priority and results in an \"auto_respond\" decision will trigger a reply resembling the one below:</p><p>Not entirely. There a few bumps to watch out for:</p><ul><li> Be careful with sensitive info — these agents require guardrails.\n</li><li> Some advanced setups require serious resources.\n</li><li> LLMs can occasionally make things up (still smarter than most interns, though).\n</li><li> The same input might return different outputs, which is great for creativity, but tricky for strict processes.</li></ul><p>However, most of these weak spots can be managed with good planning, the right tools, and — you guessed it — a bit of reflection.</p><p>LangGraph turns AI agents from buzzwords into real, working solutions. Whether you want to automate customer support, handle IT tickets, or build autonomous apps, this framework makes it doable and, actually, enjoyable.</p><p>Have you got any questions or feedback?

I didn’t expect to enjoy a calculus book this much. Shocking, I know. But that’s exactly what happened with .</p><p>Can calculus feel intuitive? Even fun? From the first few pages? For me, the answer was yes. (Okay, from page 8 to be&nbsp;exact.)</p><p><strong>Why This Book Clicked for&nbsp;Me</strong></p><p>As part of <a href=\"https://newsletter.ruslanspivak.com/p/im-back-math-ai-and-me\">my self-study</a>, I’m reviewing select chapters from the books I work through. This post covers Chapter 1 of  by Seth&nbsp;Braver.</p><p>Before I stumbled on , I tried a few limit-based calculus books and textbooks, but none of them spoke to me. Luckily, there’s no shortage of calculus material these days, so it’s easy to shop around and try different&nbsp;sources.</p><p>Braver’s book grabbed me right away. The early focus on infinitesimals, the tight writing, and the emphasis on intuition won me over. I even caught myself smiling more than once. Rare for a math&nbsp;book.</p><p>Chapter 1 starts with : “an infinitely small number, smaller than any positive real number, yet greater than zero.” One early example shows how a circle, imagined as a polygon with infinitely many infinitesimal sides, leads to the familiar area formula πr². If your geometry or trig is rusty, don’t worry - it still makes sense. Braver then uses the same idea to show how curves appear straight on a small enough (infinitesimal) scale, which is the heart of differential&nbsp;calculus.</p><p>Things really clicked for me in the section titled <em>A Gift From Leibniz: d-Notation</em>. Braver’s explanation of  shows how it captures infinitesimal change in a way that just makes sense. It helped me understand why derivatives represent slopes and rates in a way I could explain to a 10-year-old. Working through the derivative of x² from first principles was also deeply&nbsp;satisfying. </p><p>Practically speaking, Chapter 1&nbsp;covers:</p><ul><li>how they help us define rates of&nbsp;change</li><li>the geometric meaning of&nbsp;derivatives</li><li>the elegant dy/dx notation from&nbsp;Leibniz</li><li>why we ignore higher-order infinitesimals like (dx)² or du *&nbsp;dv</li><li>and a first-principles derivation of the derivative of&nbsp;x² </li></ul><p>The chapter ends with two powerful tools: the power rule and linearity properties. These let you compute derivatives of polynomials using just basic mental&nbsp;math.</p><p>The writing is sharp and often funny, in a math kind of way. There’s even a cameo by the Sumerian beer goddess Ninkasi, who helps explain rate of change and derivatives using a vat of beer. It sounds quirky, but it&nbsp;works.</p><p>The book’s style, clarity, and focus on intuition made me want to keep going.

It’s not always light reading, and the exercises are essential, but it might click for you like it did for me. <a href=\"https://www.bravernewmath.com/\">Chapter 1 is available for free on the author’s site</a>, so you can explore it before deciding whether to dive&nbsp;in. </p><p>If you do decide to dive into the book, here are a few tips to get the most out of&nbsp;it:</p><ol><li>If you’re rusty on pre-calculus (I was), make sure you’ve got slope, rate of change, the point-slope formula, and the slope-intercept form down cold before the  section on page 10. For that, Seth Braver’s other book <em>Precalculus Made Difficult</em> has excellent material on those topics. You can probably get through it in a&nbsp;day.</li><li>Read slowly, with a pen or pencil in hand. Write in the margins (get a paperback copy). It might feel painfully slow at times (pun intended), but it’s a recipe for deeper&nbsp;understanding.</li><li>The book includes answers to many exercises and is great for self-study. But the solutions are compact, so I recommend using Grok or ChatGPT to expand on them and deepen your&nbsp;understanding.</li><li>Once you’ve finished the chapter and exercises, check out <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLFFekKQwSI_1q-qGq1WLSxw3oGfXXzAeH\">the author’s YouTube videos</a> that go along with the book. They’re criminally underrated and oddly hard to find. You might enjoy them as much as I&nbsp;do. </li><li>For topics that are hard to retain, try spaced repetition with active recall. Anki works great for that, or use whatever tool you&nbsp;prefer.</li></ol><p>\nChapter 1 sealed the deal. This is the calculus book I’m sticking with. Looking forward to seeing how Braver develops the ideas from&nbsp;here.</p><p>More to come. Stay&nbsp;tuned.</p><p> I’m not affiliated with the author. I just really enjoy the book and wanted to share&nbsp;it.</p>","contentLength":4455,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Unlocking Unprecedented Benefits with AI-Powered Web Applications.","url":"https://dev.to/sparkout/unlocking-unprecedented-benefits-with-ai-powered-web-applications-gpo","date":1750424306,"author":"AI Development Company","guid":163526,"unread":true,"content":"<p>In the relentless march of digital evolution, web applications have transitioned from static information hubs to dynamic, interactive platforms.

In Glitch Runner, the \"glitches\" are random and require the player to adjust to a new situation every few seconds. </p><p>Every effect changes the difficulty the game plays and can turn the precision platforming into a creative way of parkouring through the glitches.

Actually, it works really well, especially when you've got libraries like web3.py doing the heavy lifting.</p><p>I spent way too much time at the beginning trying to figure out how to connect my Python backend to blockchain networks. Turns out, once you get past the initial setup hurdles, it's surprisingly straightforward.</p><p>If you’re a Python dev curious about crypto, or working on a backend that needs to talk to a blockchain, this guide is for you.</p><p>Imagine your blockchain network as a complex smart home, filled with devices like smart lights, thermostats, and security cameras. Each device understands a unique, complicated set of signals.  Controlling them manually would be chaos.</p><p>Now imagine having one remote that works with everything. You press \"lights on\" and it figures out the exact signals to send. That's basically what web3.py does for blockchain interaction.</p><p>Without it, you'd be manually crafting JSON-RPC requests (which I definitely tried at first - not fun). With it, you write normal Python code and let the library handle all that network protocol stuff behind the scenes.</p><p><strong>What Actually Is web3.py?</strong></p><p>It's a Python library that translates your regular Python commands into the JSON-RPC calls that Ethereum nodes understand. Remember those RPC requests we talked about before? This library handles all of that for you.</p><p>So instead of manually constructing this:</p><blockquote><p>{\"jsonrpc\": \"2.0\", \"method\": \"eth_blockNumber\", \"params\": [], \"id\": 1}</p></blockquote><p>With web3.py you can query data, send transactions, and interact with smart contracts, all with clean Python code.</p><p><strong>Getting Started: Installation and Setup</strong></p><p>Let's get this thing working. First, the usual Python project setup:</p><div><pre><code>mkdir my-web3-app\ncd my-web3-app\npython3 -m venv venv\nsource venv/bin/activate  # Windows: venv\\Scripts\\activate\npip install web3 python-dotenv\n</code></pre></div><p><strong>Connecting to an Ethereum Node (Your RPC Provider)</strong></p><p>Here's where I got stuck initially. To talk to any blockchain, you need to connect to a node. These are computers running blockchain software that maintain copies of the ledger.</p><p>You've got two main options:</p><p>*<em>1: Use a service like Infura or Alchemy *</em></p><p>These companies run blockchain nodes for you. Sign up, get an API key, and you're connected to the real Ethereum network. Great for production</p><p>How to get one: Sign up for a free account at Infura.io](<a href=\"https://www.infura.io/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://www.infura.io/</a>) or <a href=\"https://www.alchemy.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Alchemy.com</a>. Create a new project for the Ethereum Mainnet or a testnet (e.g., Sepolia) and copy your HTTP endpoint URL.</p><p>*<em>2: Run your own local blockchain *</em></p><p>When I first started, I didn’t know this was a thing. I was constantly hunting for testnet faucets and hitting request limits. Then I discovered Ganache.</p><p>It spins up a personal Ethereum blockchain on your machine. Perfect for local testing, and it gives you free ETH (fake, of course).</p><p>For this tutorial, we're going with Option 2 using Ganache. Trust me on this one - it'll save you so much hassle while learning.</p><p>\n          * Download <a href=\"https://trufflesuite.com/ganache/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Ganache Desktop</a> (easiest for beginners).\n          * Install it and launch. It will automatically start a local blockchain with pre-funded accounts and display its RPC server address (usually ).</p><p>If you're having trouble setting it up, check this put</p><p>If you use local you can get your url here in Gananche once you've installed it.</p><p><strong>Keeping Your Secrets Safe</strong></p><p>Before we write any code, let's set up environment variables. Create a .env file in your project folder:</p><div><pre><code># .env\nRPC_URL=\"http://127.0.0.1:7545\"\n\n# Later, when you want to use Infura:\n# RPC_URL=\"https://mainnet.infura.io/v3/YOUR_PROJECT_ID\"\n</code></pre></div><p>And add this to a .gitignore file so you don't accidentally commit your API keys:</p><p>Now for the actual Python code. Create app.py:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Run it with python app.py. If Ganache is running, you should see the success message.</p><p>If you've set up Ganache and it's running, you should see <code>✅ Successfully connected...</code>. If you use Infura, you'll see a similar message.</p><p><strong>Actually Reading From the Blockchain</strong></p><p>Now comes the fun part. Let's ask the blockchain some questions:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Run  again, and you'll see all this blockchain data printed to your console!</p><p>You probably noticed all those w3.from_wei() calls. Here's the deal: Ethereum uses really tiny units internally to avoid floating-point math errors.</p><ul><li>1 ETH = 1,000,000,000,000,000,000 wei (that's 18 zeros)</li><li>1 ETH = 1,000,000,000 gwei (9 zeros)</li></ul><p>So when the blockchain returns 20000000000, that's actually 20 gwei, not 20 ETH. The conversion functions save you from doing that math yourself.</p><p><strong>What You Just Accomplished</strong></p><p>Pretty cool, right? You just:</p><p>Connected Python to a blockchain network</p><ul><li>Queried live blockchain data</li><li>Handled the weird unit conversions automatically</li><li>Did it all with clean, readable Python code</li></ul><p>No manual JSON-RPC construction, no hex encoding/decoding headaches, no network protocol debugging. Just Python talking to blockchain.</p><p>Next time, we're going to deploy and interact with smart contracts. That's where things get really interesting - calling functions, sending transactions, handling events.</p><p>But first, play around with this code.</p><blockquote><p>Quick troubleshooting: If Ganache won't start, check if port 7545 is already in use. If you're getting connection errors, make sure your .env file is in the right directory and the RPC_URL is uncommented.</p></blockquote>","contentLength":5281,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Build a Simple Number Guessing Game in Python 🎯 (Beginner Friendly)","url":"https://dev.to/nasakib143/build-a-simple-number-guessing-game-in-python-beginner-friendly-2ji","date":1750408757,"author":"Tasib","guid":163380,"unread":true,"content":"<p>Here’s a fun and beginner-friendly project: a  using Python! 🎯</p><ul><li>Randomly picks a number between 1 and 100</li><li>7,5,3 attempts(based on your level) to guess the correct number</li><li>Friendly feedback: 📉 Too low / 📈 Too high</li><li>Tells you if your guess is too high or too low</li><li>Includes input validation and emojis for fun!</li></ul><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><ul><li>Add a “Play Again” option</li></ul><p>Hope this helps fellow learners! 💻✨<p>\nFeel free to fork and improve!</p><p>\nLeave a comment if you built something similar 😊</p></p>","contentLength":461,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Crafting Perfect Cold Messages: My AI-Powered Streamlit App Journey 🧊","url":"https://dev.to/asutoshk_09/crafting-perfect-cold-messages-my-ai-powered-streamlit-app-journey-4i36","date":1750401644,"author":"Asutosh Kataruka","guid":163336,"unread":true,"content":"<p>The digital world thrives on connections, and often, those connections start with a \"cold\" message.

You simply upload your resume in PDF format using the designated file uploader.</li></ul><p>Once your resume is uploaded, the application immediately gets to work behind the scenes:</p><ul><li> The system rapidly extracts all textual content from your PDF resume.</li><li> Simultaneously, it scans the extracted text for any visible URLs.</li></ul><h3>\n  \n  \n  Step 2: Intelligent Link Classification &amp; Summarization 🧠\n</h3><p>This is where the AI and smart processing truly shine, transforming raw data into actionable insights.</p><ul><li><strong>Hidden Link Classification:</strong> Beyond simple extraction, the app employs a specialized utility that goes through the discovered links. It intelligently classifies ambiguous or \"hidden\" links, ensuring that your LinkedIn, GitHub, and personal portfolio URLs are correctly identified and categorized, ready for easy inclusion in your message.</li><li><strong>AI-Powered Resume Summarization:</strong> The full text of your resume is then sent to an advanced LLM. This AI model doesn't just condense text; it analyzes your experience and skills to generate a concise, professional, and impactful summary. This summary is automatically populated into a dedicated text area on the screen, ready for your review. This feature saves you the significant effort of crafting a summary from scratch.</li></ul><p>At this point, you'll see the AI-generated summary and any automatically detected and classified links pre-filled into input fields, allowing you to easily review and make any minor adjustments or add links if they weren't detected.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Step 3: Message Tailoring &amp; Template Generation ✍️\n</h3><p>With your profile data processed, you guide the AI in crafting the perfect message.</p><ul><li> You select the desired message type from a dropdown, such as \"Cold Email,\" \"LinkedIn Message,\" or \"Other,\" indicating the communication channel.</li><li> You input the specific job title or role you're targeting (e.g., \"Software Engineer,\" \"Data Scientist\"). This critical piece of information allows the AI to tailor the message's content directly to the context of that role.</li><li> With a simple click of the \"Generate Template\" button, the application sends all your prepared inputs – the refined resume summary, your social links, the chosen message type, and the target job type – back to the LLM.</li></ul><p>The AI then processes this comprehensive input to produce a customized message template. This template is designed for immediate use and includes dynamic placeholders, specifically  and .</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Step 4: Final Personalization &amp; Send-Ready Message ✨\n</h3><p>The last mile of customization is in your hands, leading to a complete, ready-to-send message.</p><ul><li> You'll see dedicated input fields where you simply type in the specific recipient's name and the company's name for your current outreach.</li><li> Upon clicking \"Generate Message,\" the application seamlessly substitutes your entered recipient and company names into the template's placeholders.</li></ul><p>The result is a fully formatted, personalized message displayed in a large text area, ready for you to copy and paste directly into your email client or LinkedIn message window. This entire process significantly reduces manual effort, allowing you to scale your outreach while maintaining a personalized touch.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Why Groq &amp; Streamlit? (Under the Hood Efficiency)\n</h2><ul><li> The choice of Groq's API for the LLM inference is crucial. Its Language Processing Units (LPUs) provide incredible speed, making the AI summarization and message generation almost instantaneous. This eliminates frustrating wait times, providing a snappy user experience that truly saves time.</li><li><strong>Streamlit's User-Friendliness:</strong> For building interactive Python web applications, Streamlit is a fantastic choice. Its simplicity allowed me to focus primarily on the core AI logic and user workflow, rather than getting bogged down in complex web development frameworks.</li><li> Leveraging libraries like LangChain helps orchestrate the LLM calls and ensures structured outputs. Pydantic schemas enforce data consistency, guaranteeing that the AI's responses are always in the expected format, leading to reliable processing at every step.</li></ul><p>I'm always thinking about how to make this tool even better:</p><ul><li> Introducing options for networking events, informational interview requests, and more diverse outreach scenarios.</li><li> Allowing users to specify the desired tone (e.g., formal, friendly, direct, assertive) for their messages.</li><li><strong>ATS Keyword Optimization:</strong> Integrating functionality to analyze job descriptions and suggest relevant keywords to include in the message for Applicant Tracking System (ATS) compatibility.</li><li> Exploring options for simple export functionality to popular Customer Relationship Management (CRM) tools.</li></ul><p>Ready to automate your outreach and make impactful first impressions?</p><p>I'm keen to hear your feedback, suggestions, or ideas for future improvements!

Yes, you heard that right. I have no formal software engineering education, and my only past experience was a bit of HTML and PHP. But right now, I have a software project with 85% test coverage, a benchmark dashboard, and over 310 pytest test cases, featuring a custom compression engine: .</p><p>So how did I achieve this?</p><p>🤖 <strong>My Team: ChatGPT + GitHub Copilot</strong></p><p>Before starting this project, I had been interested in software development for years but always stayed one step away. Everything began about a month ago when a friend showed me GitHub Copilot. \"You don't have to write code,\" he said, \"just tell it what you want to do.\"</p><p>I took this seriously. My goal became creating a modern, open-source alternative to WinRAR. That's how Pagonic was born.</p><p>My initial plans were very simple. Plain .txt files with basic headings:</p><ul><li>Step 1: Set up test infrastructure\n</li></ul><p>But then my friend  showed me his planning examples. Plans with emojis, headers, graphics. That's when I realized something: Software development isn't just about code—it's also about organization, design, and strategy. Inspired by these examples, I created 12 main planning files. Each worked like a sprint, with steps, sub-headers, platform targets, and performance metrics.</p><p>I first showed these plans to ChatGPT for analysis, then created my own version. Then I fed this plan to Copilot to generate code. I tested the generated code, got feedback, and reorganized. This cycle—Plan &gt; Generate &gt; Test &gt; Improve—is still ongoing.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  🛠️ <strong>Development Process: Planning &gt; Testing &gt; Code</strong></h2><p>I ran the project not with the classic \"write code first, fix later\" approach, but entirely planning-centered. My plans included user scenarios, sprint days, module targets, and other details. Every day, I aimed for small but meaningful progress.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  🔬 <strong>Phase 1: Test Infrastructure</strong></h2><p>I spent the first 2 weeks just writing infrastructure files like ,  and creating their tests. With files like , I increased test coverage from 12% to 85%. During this time, I established the software's testing architecture. I had to be able to test the code before understanding its behavior. This testing architecture gave me confidence. Now I was ready to move on to the compression engine.</p><p>Here's an example of the registry system I built:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>When developing the ZIP module, I created daily sprint plans. I progressed step by step each day. I first wrote the compression engine, then included parts like entropy control, performance monitoring, and buffer management. At each step, I consulted ChatGPT and guided Copilot. But the most challenging step was \"Day 5, Step 4.\" When ChatGPT's AI-assisted optimization strategies combined with Copilot, the  file exceeded 3000+ lines. Copilot was now reversing operations and couldn't scan the code from scratch. Finally, I completely rolled back that day, replanned, and re-implemented it in a modular way.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  😳 <strong>My Embarrassing Oversight: The Forgotten Half</strong></h2><p>Here's where I have to admit something really embarrassing that I only discovered weeks later during performance testing.</p><p>: While I was obsessing over compression performance, achieving 500+ MB/s speeds and celebrating my AI-guided optimization breakthroughs, I had completely forgotten about the other half of the equation—decompression.</p><p> When I finally ran end-to-end tests, I discovered my \"decompression engine\" was literally just one line of code:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>: This wasn't even using my custom ZIP parser, SIMD optimizations, or buffer pools. It was just delegating to Python's standard library. While my compression was blazing at 500+ MB/s, decompression was crawling at 2.8 MB/s.</p><p>: Picture this—I'm showing my friend Ömer these amazing compression benchmarks, proudly talking about entropy analysis and AI-guided parameter tuning. Then he asks: \"Cool, but how fast does it extract files?\" </p><p>I run the test. 2.8 MB/s.</p><p><strong>The silence was deafening.</strong></p><p>: This taught me that AI-assisted development has the same pitfall as traditional development—you can get so excited about the interesting problems that you neglect the \"boring\" parts. The most sophisticated compression engine in the world is useless if you forget to build the extraction engine.</p><p>: Once I realized my mistake, fixing it became my biggest breakthrough...</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  🚀 <strong>The ZIP Decompression Breakthrough: From Embarrassment to 90x Performance</strong></h2><p>After that humiliating discovery, the decompression module became my redemption challenge. What happened next was unexpected—a performance breakthrough that transformed my biggest oversight into my proudest achievement.</p><p>: My embarrassing 2.8 MB/s one-liner that wasn't even using my own code.</p><p>: When I finally ran performance tests on the complete pipeline, the decompression bottleneck was glaring. While my compression engine was hitting 500+ MB/s, decompression was limping at 2.8 MB/s. This wasn't just a performance gap—it was a development oversight that needed immediate attention.</p><p>: Three AI-guided optimization strategies that transformed everything—from a forgotten one-liner to industry-competitive performance:</p><h3><strong>1. Hybrid Fast Path Strategy (10MB Threshold)</strong></h3><p>ChatGPT analyzed my performance bottlenecks and suggested an intelligent file size strategy:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p> Thread startup cost is ~3ms. Below 10MB, thread overhead &gt; benefit. Above 10MB, parallel processing &gt; overhead.</p><h3><strong>2. SIMD CRC32 Hardware Acceleration</strong></h3><p>ZIP files require CRC32 validation for every file—a major bottleneck. ChatGPT suggested hardware acceleration:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>: 899% speedup on Intel/AMD CPUs with hardware CRC32 instructions.</p><h3><strong>3.

Not just the last piece of information, but the entire sequence of events, allowing it to understand context and predict future outcomes based on past experiences. This isn't science fiction; this is the power of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs). Unlike traditional neural networks that process data independently, RNNs possess a unique \"memory\" that allows them to analyze sequential data, making them ideal for tackling problems that involve order and context.</p><p><strong>Understanding the Core Concept: A Network with a Memory</strong></p><p>Traditional neural networks are like static snapshots. They process a single input and produce an output, forgetting everything about the previous input. RNNs, however, are more like a video recording. They maintain an internal state, a kind of memory, that's updated with each new input. This memory allows the network to consider the sequence of inputs, understanding not just what happened but  it happened.</p><p>Think of reading a sentence. Understanding \"The cat sat on the mat\" requires remembering \"the cat\" to understand where it \"sat.\" A traditional neural network would process each word independently, failing to grasp the relationship. An RNN, however, would maintain a memory of \"the cat,\" allowing it to correctly interpret the entire sentence.</p><p>Technically, this memory is achieved through loops in the network's architecture. The output of a layer is fed back into the same layer, allowing the network to retain information from previous inputs. This loop, combined with the network's weights (which determine the importance of different inputs), enables the RNN to learn complex patterns and dependencies within sequential data.</p><p><strong>The Significance of RNNs: Tackling Sequential Challenges</strong></p><p>The ability to process sequential data opens up a vast array of possibilities. Many real-world problems involve sequences: time series data (stock prices, weather patterns), natural language (text, speech), and even genetic sequences. RNNs excel in these domains, offering solutions where traditional methods struggle.</p><p><strong>Applications and Transformative Impact:</strong></p><p>The impact of RNNs is already being felt across various industries:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Natural Language Processing (NLP):</strong>  RNNs are revolutionizing NLP, powering applications like machine translation, text summarization, chatbots, and sentiment analysis.  They excel at understanding the nuances of language, capturing context and generating coherent text.</p></li><li><p>  RNNs are crucial for converting spoken language into text, significantly improving the accuracy and efficiency of voice assistants and dictation software.</p></li><li><p>  From predicting stock market trends to forecasting weather patterns, RNNs provide powerful tools for analyzing and predicting changes over time.  This has implications for finance, meteorology, and other fields.</p></li><li><p>  RNNs, particularly those advanced architectures like LSTMs and GRUs, have significantly improved the quality of machine translation, enabling more natural and accurate translations between languages.</p></li><li><p>  RNNs are used for analyzing medical images, predicting patient outcomes, and even assisting in drug discovery.  The ability to process sequential data like patient records allows for more personalized and effective healthcare.</p></li></ul><p><strong>Challenges and Ethical Considerations:</strong></p><p>Despite their power, RNNs also present challenges:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Vanishing Gradient Problem:</strong>  During training, information can be lost as it's passed through the recurrent loops, making it difficult to learn long-range dependencies.  Advanced architectures like Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) networks were developed to mitigate this issue.</p></li><li><p>  Training RNNs can be computationally expensive, requiring significant processing power and time, particularly for large datasets.</p></li><li><p>  Like all machine learning models, RNNs are susceptible to biases present in the training data. This can lead to unfair or discriminatory outcomes, highlighting the need for careful data curation and model evaluation.</p></li><li><p>  Understanding  an RNN makes a particular prediction can be challenging, limiting their transparency and accountability, especially in critical applications like healthcare and finance.</p></li></ul><p><strong>A Forward-Looking Summary:</strong></p><p>Recurrent Neural Networks represent a significant advancement in artificial intelligence, offering powerful tools for processing sequential data and tackling complex problems across diverse fields. While challenges remain, particularly regarding computational cost and explainability, ongoing research and development are continuously refining RNN architectures and addressing these limitations. As we move forward, the transformative potential of RNNs will undoubtedly continue to reshape industries and offer innovative solutions to some of humanity's most pressing challenges. The ability to build systems that learn from sequences, remember context, and predict future outcomes based on past experiences is a cornerstone of truly intelligent systems, and RNNs are leading the way.</p>","contentLength":5005,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Why Is Python Good For Rapid Prototyping Applications?","url":"https://dev.to/shriyansh_iot_98734929139/why-is-python-good-for-rapid-prototyping-applications-4e7i","date":1750382829,"author":"Shriyansh IOT","guid":163226,"unread":true,"content":"<p>Python is an excellent language for rapid prototyping due to its simplicity, readability, and extensive ecosystem of libraries and frameworks.

Handling Nested Relationships for Read/Write\n</h3><p>For OrderItems, I used a powerful DRF pattern:</p><p>For Reading (GET requests): I use product = ProductSerializer(read_only=True) to show detailed product information nested within the OrderItem.\nFor Writing (POST/PUT requests): I use product_id = serializers.PrimaryKeyRelatedField(queryset=Product.objects.all(), write_only=True) to expect just the product's ID from the client, simplifying the input payload.</p><div><pre><code># orders/serializers.py (inside OrderItemSerializer)\n# Assuming ProductSerializer is correctly imported from products.serializers\nfrom products.serializers import ProductSerializer \n\nclass OrderItemSerializer(serializers.ModelSerializer):\n    product = ProductSerializer(read_only=True) # Full product details on read\n    product_id = serializers.PrimaryKeyRelatedField( # Product ID on write\n        queryset=Product.objects.all(), \n        write_only=True\n    )\n    # ...\n</code></pre></div><h3>\n  \n  \n  The Sweet Taste of Success!\n</h3><p>After implementing these changes and restarting my server, the API calls from Swagger were finally successful!</p><div><pre><code>[19/Jun/2025 02:57:30] \"POST /api/orders/ HTTP/1.1\" 201 378\n[19/Jun/2025 02:57:59] \"GET /api/orders/ HTTP/1.1\" 200 742\n</code></pre></div><h3>\n  \n  \n  This journey reinforced the immense value of:\n</h3><p>Thorough Unit Testing: Pinpointing where the issue truly lies (model vs. serializer).\nUnderstanding DRF's Mechanics: Especially read_only_fields and custom create/update methods for nested writes.<p>\nData Integrity: Ensuring fields meet database constraints.</p>\nDjango Signals: Leveraging them for automated calculations and maintaining data consistency.<p>\nI'm incredibly grateful for the guidance received throughout this process.

Offers were wild. I saw junior devs making $180K+. Everyone was hiring. Everyone was growing. Engineers were being treated like kings.</p><p>Fast forward to today, and it’s a different game.</p><ul><li>Layoffs hit hard. Not just at startups, but at , you name it.</li><li>Projects were cut.

The brand name? The approval of other developers?</p><p>I never stopped to think whether I’d actually enjoy working in a massive organization where you’re just one cog in a huge machine. Where \"impact\" means shipping a feature behind a feature flag that 0.02% of users might see for a week.</p><p>I didn’t want to spend my days optimizing signup buttons or writing glue code between microservices I couldn’t control.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  The Interview Process Burned Me Out\n</h2><p>Honestly? Interviewing at FAANG companies started to feel like a second job.</p><p>I was coding all day… and then spending nights grinding algorithms I’d never use at work. Just to be asked some tree traversal question by someone who wouldn’t remember my name 10 minutes later.</p><p>And even when I did well? Ghosted.

It features over 20 core developers and takes us on a journey from the first days of Python to the latest developments.&nbsp;</p><p>At EuroPython, we’re excited to share a special preview of the film, followed by a Q&amp;A with Brett Cannon, Paul Everitt, and Armin Ronacher.&nbsp;</p><p>As part of EuroPython, we will be holding a memorial session to commemorate Michael Foord.&nbsp;</p><p>Michael Foord (1974-2025) was a central figure in the Python community. He was an original thinker whose warmth, passion, and unfiltered humor touched the lives of many. A core Python developer and the creator of the influential unittest.mock module, he played a pivotal role in shaping testing practices and helped establish the Language Summit at PyCon. More than a brilliant engineer, Michael was a beloved mentor and friend, known for his elaborate vaping setup, colorful attire, and heartfelt conversations. His passing earlier this year left a profound void in the community, but his legacy lives on through his contributions to Python, his generous spirit, and the countless moments of camaraderie he inspired.</p><p>Friends of Michael are invited to attend this session and share their memories. We will provide more details about it closer to the event.</p><p>On Saturday 19th July, we’ll be hosting a Beginners’ Day to help introduce people to Python programming and its applications. Beginners’ Day will feature three tracks running in parallel; The Unconference, Django Girls, and Humble Data. The events are designed to welcome newcomers to the Python ecosystem, including a series of talks and panels by junior developers and two workshops designed to introduce complete beginners to web development and data science.</p><p>We are running the following three tracks:</p><ul><li>, a series of panels and discussions designed to help people just getting into tech to start or grow their career</li><li>, a hands-on workshop teaching the basics of web development</li><li>, a hands-on workshop teaching the basics of data science</li></ul><p>Beginners’ Day is open to everyone, and you don’t need a EuroPython ticket to attend (although note that some tracks will cost €5 to attend otherwise).

Growing. And most importantly, building a solid foundation in coding.<p>\nThis is the story of my first week learning Python, and if you're someone who's just starting out, or someone who loves seeing others learn, I hope this post finds you with a spark of joy.</p></p><p>🐍 \nPython felt like the perfect companion for this journey — simple to read, powerful under the hood, and used across so many fields: web development, automation, AI, data science, you name it!<p>\nBut I didn’t want to just read about Python. I wanted to understand it, to try things, to break things, and fix them again. And so, I dove in.</p></p><p>💫 <strong>Reflections From a Beginner’s Heart</strong>\nI’m not perfect. I’ve written buggy code. I’ve stared at error messages like they were ancient riddles. But in every moment of frustration, there’s also this tiny flicker that says —<strong>“Hey, you’re learning. This is how growth looks.”</strong>\nI may be at the start of this journey, but I am walking with wonder. And even when the road feels steep, I remind myself that every coder was once a confused beginner — just like me.</p><p>🔹** What I’ve Learned in Week 1**\nHere’s what my mind is full of right now:<p>\n🌸 Basics of Python Syntax</p>\nThe way Python talks is… soft-spoken and neat. No messy semicolons, no curly brackets. Just logic and indentation — like poetry for machines.</p><p>🌸 Variables and Data Types\nFrom strings to integers, floats to booleans — I learned how to store and juggle different kinds of data. And yes, Python makes it very beginner-friendly.</p><p>🌸 Input/Output Functions\nUsing input() and print() gave me a sense of interaction — like the code wasn’t just doing things for me, but with me.</p><p>🌸 Python 2 vs Python 3\nThis was so eye-opening! I learned key differences like:<p>\nprint being a statement in Python 2, but a function in Python 3 and much more.</p>\n(P.S. Python 3 is the future and the now!)</p><p>🌸 Pattern Printing\nThis was my first taste of real logic-building. Those triangle stars!<p>\nThey look innocent — but they're sneaky logic puzzles in disguise. I loved trying different loops and seeing shapes appear.</p></p><p>✨** Let’s Grow Together**\nIf you’re also on a coding journey — whether you’re at Day 1 or Year 5 — I’d love to hear from you. Share your favorite resources, tips, or just say hi in the comments! Let’s cheer each other on.<p>\nThanks for reading my little update. Until next time, keep coding, keep blooming. </p></p>","contentLength":2634,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Untitled","url":"https://dev.to/ozen_temeozen_e88de16e9a/untitled-228p","date":1750357320,"author":"Ozen Teme Ozen","guid":163057,"unread":true,"content":"<p>Check out this Pen I made!</p>","contentLength":26,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"🤖 From Using Bots to Building One","url":"https://dev.to/panicatthekernel/from-using-bots-to-building-one-2775","date":1750355695,"author":"PanicAtTheKernel","guid":163040,"unread":true,"content":"<p>In the last post, I talked about this cool bot I  — a Telegram bot that handed out disposable emails and pinged you when you got mail.

The AI was parsing commands and providing genuinely helpful guidance. It felt like magic. ✨</p><p>But as I tried to make it more precise, the magic started to fade.

It works locally on Windows, has its own GUI with an avatar, understands voice commands via a wake-word, and even runs a full large language model (LLM) offline to handle AI tasks.</p><p>And now... it’s open-source. The project is up and running, but I need help with polishing, debugging, and expanding it. If you're a Python dev, AI enthusiast, or just someone curious about real offline AI automation — this is for you.</p><p>What is Great SAGE?\nGreat SAGE is a full-featured AI assistant designed to run completely offline on your PC. It doesn’t send anything to the cloud, doesn’t rely on APIs, and doesn’t need internet access to function.</p><p>Detects a wake word (“Hey SAGE”) using local wake-word detection</p><p>Understands voice input with offline speech recognition (Vosk)</p><p>Processes AI queries using a local LLM (MythoMax 13B, via llama.cpp or ollama)</p><p>Responds via TTS and GUI output</p><p>Controls apps and files with your voice — open programs, move/delete files, organize folders</p><p>Sets reminders and fetches daily info like weather or news</p><p>Supports image generation from voice prompts using Stable Diffusion</p><p>Includes Android sync features via KDE Connect and Scrcpy</p><p>Has a login system secured with password + facial recognition</p><p>Comes with a GUI and animated assistant avatar built in Tkinter</p><p>It’s a real, functioning system — not a concept, not a mockup, not a UI template.</p><p>Why I Built It\nTo be honest, I built it to challenge myself. I wanted to prove that a full AI assistant could be done without the cloud. No Google APIs, no OpenAI keys, no server dependencies.</p><p>Just Python, local models, open-source tools, and a lot of trial-and-error.</p><p>I also wanted something that felt personal — not a generic bot. So I added the avatar. The GUI. The wake word. The local AI engine.</p><p>I’m proud of what I managed to build alone — but I know it could be so much better with help.</p><p>What It Needs Now\nThe core of Great SAGE is solid — but it's rough around the edges.

While the buzz around Artificial Intelligence has been consistent, a new paradigm is emerging: Agentic AI. This isn't just about automation; it's about giving AI the power to perceive, reason, plan, and execute tasks autonomously, transforming operations from reactive to proactive. The impact of agentic AI on businesses will be profound, fundamentally reshaping how work gets done, value is created, and competitive advantages are forged.</p><p>At its core, agentic AI refers to AI systems that possess a degree of autonomy. Unlike traditional AI, which typically performs predefined tasks or provides insights for human action, an agentic AI system can take initiative, make decisions within defined parameters, and execute multi-step processes to achieve a high-level goal. Think of it less as a tool and more as a digital colleague capable of independent thought and action. This shift demands a strategic approach, and businesses will increasingly look to specialized partners, such as an <a href=\"https://www.sparkouttech.com/agentic-ai-development/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Agentic ai development company</a>, to navigate this complex yet rewarding journey.</p><p><strong>The Transformative Power of Agentic AI</strong>\nThe transition to agentic AI isn't merely an incremental upgrade; it's a fundamental re-imagining of operational efficiency and strategic capability.

Imagine an AI agent not just scheduling a meeting, but coordinating across different time zones, finding optimal availability, sending invitations, booking a virtual room, and even sending pre-meeting summaries. This level of automation means:</p><p>Elimination of Repetitive Tasks: Tedious, high-volume, and rule-based processes can be entirely offloaded to AI agents, freeing human employees from mundane work. This includes tasks like data entry, routine reporting, compliance checks, and basic customer support inquiries.</p><p>Faster Processing Times: Agentic AI operates 24/7, without breaks or fatigue. This translates to significantly reduced processing times for everything from claims handling in insurance to supply chain adjustments in manufacturing.</p><p>Reduced Errors: By automating steps and adhering strictly to logic, AI agents minimize human error, leading to higher quality outputs and fewer costly mistakes.</p><p><strong>2. Enhanced Decision-Making and Strategic Insights:</strong></p><p>Agentic AI doesn't just execute; it reasons. This capability elevates its impact beyond simple automation:</p><p>Real-time Data Analysis: Agents can continuously monitor vast streams of data – from market trends and customer behavior to internal system performance – identifying patterns and anomalies that humans might miss.</p><p>Proactive Problem Solving: Instead of reacting to issues, agentic AI can predict potential problems (e.g., a supply chain disruption, a system failure, or a fraudulent transaction) and initiate corrective actions or alert human counterparts, minimizing downtime and losses.</p><p>Optimized Resource Allocation: In areas like logistics or financial trading, agents can dynamically allocate resources, adjust routes, or rebalance portfolios in real-time based on evolving conditions, maximizing efficiency and profitability.</p><p><strong>3. Revolutionizing Customer Experience:</strong></p><p>Agentic AI can deliver highly personalized and instantaneous customer interactions at scale:</p><p>24/7 Intelligent Support: Beyond basic chatbots, agentic AI can handle complex customer queries, troubleshoot issues, process returns, and even offer tailored recommendations, providing consistent and immediate support across all channels.</p><p>Personalized Interactions: By analyzing customer history, preferences, and real-time context, agents can deliver hyper-personalized service, making each interaction feel unique and valuable.</p><p>Proactive Engagement: Agents can anticipate customer needs and reach out with relevant information, offers, or support before the customer even realizes they need it, fostering stronger relationships and loyalty.</p><p><strong>4. Empowering Human-AI Collaboration:</strong></p><p>Contrary to fears of job displacement, agentic AI is largely seen as an augmentative technology. It reshapes roles, allowing humans to focus on higher-value activities:</p><p>Upskilling and Reskilling Opportunities: Employees previously tied to repetitive tasks can be upskilled to manage, oversee, and strategically direct AI agents, transitioning into roles that require creativity, critical thinking, and complex problem-solving.</p><p>Strategic Focus for Humans: With agents handling the operational minutiae, human teams can dedicate more time to innovation, strategic planning, relationship building, and tackling unique, unstructured problems.</p><p>Accelerated Learning and Development: Agentic AI can power personalized training programs, identify skill gaps within a workforce, and even act as intelligent coaches for employees, accelerating professional development.</p><p><strong>Key Applications Across Industries</strong>\nThe versatility of agentic AI means its impact will be felt across virtually every sector:</p><p>Financial Services: Fraud detection, personalized financial advisory, automated compliance checks, algorithmic trading, and dynamic risk management. An agentic AI development company can help financial institutions build sophisticated systems to monitor markets and execute complex strategies.</p><p>Healthcare: Patient care coordination, automated medical record management, personalized treatment plan recommendations, remote patient monitoring, and drug discovery acceleration.</p><p>Manufacturing &amp; Supply Chain: Predictive maintenance for machinery, dynamic supply chain optimization (forecasting demand, managing inventory, optimizing logistics), quality control, and factory automation.</p><p>Retail &amp; E-commerce: Hyper-personalized product recommendations, automated inventory management, dynamic pricing, customer service automation, and fraud prevention in online transactions.</p><p>Human Resources: Automated resume screening, personalized onboarding experiences, intelligent talent matching, employee support, and compliance monitoring for HR policies.</p><p>IT Operations: Proactive system monitoring, automated incident response, intelligent ticket routing, security threat detection, and automated deployment and management of IT infrastructure. An AI development company specializing in IT solutions can provide critical agentic AI development services to streamline operations.</p><p><strong>The Development Journey: Partnering for Success</strong>\nAdopting agentic AI is not simply about acquiring software; it's a strategic transformation that requires careful planning, robust development, and continuous iteration.

SpeechDown is the natural successor and, yes, a playground for practicing software-craft principles and experimenting with AI-driven development.</p><p>This post is a brief tour of that journey so far.</p><p>First things first: I don't recommend using SpeechDown for any critical work . It's a work in progress. However, I believe the code and the development practices behind it can serve as a useful, real-world example for the concepts I'm about to discuss.</p><ul><li><ul><li>Capture and organise my own voice notes in a searchable Markdown corpus\n</li><li>Personal sandbox to practise software-craft principles\n</li><li>Test-bed for AI-assisted coding workflows\n</li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Architecture in a nutshell</strong></p><ul><li>Domain-Driven Design (DDD) keeps core logic pure and language-aligned\n</li><li>Ports &amp; Adapters (Hexagonal) pattern isolates I/O, letting adapters swap freely\n</li><li>Four layers: , , , </li></ul></li><li><ul><li>Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) capture the “why” of each big choice\n</li><li>Design / PRD docs outline features up front for both humans  AIs\n</li></ul></li><li><ul><li>Design docs serve as rich prompts for Copilot, Codex, Claude Code, etc.\n</li><li>A single  file synchronizes naming, layout, and testing rules across tools\n</li></ul></li><li><ul><li><code>sd transcribe --within-hours 24</code> turns recent audio into timestamped Markdown\n</li><li>Adding a new speech-to-text engine is as simple as implementing another adapter\n</li></ul></li><li><ul><li>Pre-v1 playground: solid for learning and tinkering, not yet production-grade</li></ul></li><li><ul><li>See the  section at the end for a curated set of recent deep-dive posts and tools that extend these ideas.</li></ul></li></ul><h2>\n  \n  \n  Part 1: A Playground for Software Craftsmanship\n</h2><p>One of my main goals with SpeechDown was to apply and practice established software design patterns in a Python context.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Domain-Driven Design (DDD) &amp; Ports and Adapters Pattern\n</h3><p>I structured the project using a layered architecture inspired by DDD and the Ports and Adapters (or Hexagonal) pattern. This helps keep the core logic of the application separate from the tools and technologies it uses.</p><p>The project is split into four distinct layers:</p><ul><li>: Contains the core business logic, entities, and value objects. It has zero external dependencies.</li><li>: Orchestrates the use cases. It defines interfaces (Ports) for external interactions.</li><li>: Provides concrete implementations (Adapters) for the ports. This is where database connections, file system access, and API calls live.</li><li>: The user-facing layer, in this case, the Command-Line Interface (CLI).</li></ul><p>This structure is reflected in the source code directory:</p><div><pre><code>src/speechdown/\n├── application/\n│   ├── ports/\n│   └── services/\n├── domain/\n│   ├── entities.py\n│   └── value_objects.py\n├── infrastructure/\n│   ├── adapters/\n│   └── database.py\n└── presentation/\n    └── cli/\n</code></pre></div><p>A  is just an interface. For example, to get a timestamp from a file, the application layer defines a simple contract:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>The  is the concrete implementation. This one parses filenames or falls back to the file's modification time:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>This separation makes the system incredibly flexible and testable. I can easily swap out the  for one that reads metadata from the audio file without changing any of the application's core logic.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Documenting Decisions with ADRs and Design Docs\n</h3><p>To keep track of  certain decisions were made, I use <strong>Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)</strong>. They are simple Markdown files that document a decision, its context, and its consequences. You can see them in .</p><p>For more detailed feature planning, I use , which outline the —covering product requirements, UX, and technical design. This practice is especially useful when working with AI assistants.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Part 2: A Playground for AI Collaboration\n</h2><p>The second major goal of SpeechDown is to explore how to work effectively with modern AI coding assistants. Simply asking an AI to \"add a feature\" often results in code that breaks the established architecture.</p><p>My solution involves two key practices:</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  1. Design Documents (PRDs) as AI Prompts\n</h3><p>I write detailed design documents before starting a feature. These documents serve as a comprehensive prompt for the AI, giving it the necessary context to generate code that fits the project's structure. I'm considering renaming my  folder to  (Product Requirement Documents), as this seems to be emerging as a standard term for this practice.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  2. Explicit Rules for AI Assistants\n</h3><p>I maintain a master rule file, , that explicitly defines the project's architecture, naming conventions, and testing requirements.</p><div><pre><code> Follow Domain-Driven Design with four layers: , , , .\n Domain layer () contains entities and value objects only. No external dependencies.\n Application layer () defines ports (interfaces) under ...\n Dependencies point inward...\n\n Interfaces end with  (e.g., ).\n Implementations end with  (e.g., ).\n Service classes end with .\n</code></pre></div><p>A simple Python script (<code>scripts/generate_ai_rules.py</code>) then generates specific configuration files for different AI assistants from this master file:</p><ul><li><code>.github/copilot-instructions.md</code> for GitHub Copilot</li><li> for OpenAI Codex</li><li> for Anthropic's Claude</li></ul><p>This ensures that no matter which tool I'm using—GitHub Copilot, Google's Jules, or Claude Code—it has the same set of instructions. This has dramatically improved the quality and compliance of AI-generated code.</p><p>Despite being a playground, SpeechDown is a usable CLI tool. After initializing a project with , you can run a transcription with a simple command:</p><div><pre><code>\nsd transcribe  24\n</code></pre></div><p>This processes the audio files and groups the transcriptions into daily Markdown files, like :</p><div><pre><code>\n\nThis is the transcribed text from my first audio note. I should remember to talk about the AI rules.\n\n\nAnother transcription from a different file, automatically appended and sorted chronologically.\n</code></pre></div><p>This section gathers the core references mentioned above plus a hand-picked set of very recent articles for anyone who wants to dig deeper into the architecture patterns, ADR discipline, AI-assisted coding.</p><p>This project has been an incredible learning experience. It's a practical exercise in applying software architecture principles and a fascinating exploration of human-AI collaboration in coding.</p><p>I'm sharing this not as a finished product, but as a collection of ideas and examples. I'd love to hear your thoughts on this approach.</p><ul><li>  What are your strategies for maintaining clean architecture in your projects?</li><li>  How do you guide AI assistants to produce code that fits your standards?</li></ul>","contentLength":6811,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"BJ's Wholesale Club Grocery Data Powers Retail Product Intelligence Growth","url":"https://dev.to/mobileapp1/bjs-wholesale-club-grocery-data-powers-retail-product-intelligence-growth-8e9","date":1750332798,"author":"mobileapp","guid":162829,"unread":true,"content":"<p><a href=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fhd37y7q85opxbckpwyi6.jpg\"><img src=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fhd37y7q85opxbckpwyi6.jpg\" alt=\"Image description\" width=\"800\" height=\"421\"></a>\nModern wholesale retail environments require sophisticated intelligence systems to navigate complex market dynamics and consumer purchasing patterns.

This powerful synergy is giving rise to Web3 <a href=\"https://www.sparkouttech.com/ai-agent-development/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">AI Agents – autonomous</a>, intelligent entities that can perceive, reason, plan, and act within decentralized ecosystems, promising a new frontier in digital interaction, automation, and value creation.</p><p>Gone are the days when AI was confined to centralized servers, opaque algorithms, and corporate control. Web3 AI Agents embody a future where intelligence is distributed, transparent, and user-centric, fundamentally altering how we interact with the internet and manage digital assets. This blog delves into what Web3 AI Agents are, their transformative potential, the challenges they face, and the exciting future they herald.</p><p><strong>What are Web3 AI Agents? A Fusion of Intelligence and Decentralization</strong>\nAt its core, a Web3 AI Agent is an AI-powered software program that can independently interact with blockchain networks and decentralized applications (dApps). It's not just a smart contract; it's an intelligent entity that can:</p><p>Perceive (Web3 Data): These agents are designed to \"see\" and interpret the vast amount of data residing on blockchains. This includes real-time transaction streams, smart contract states, NFT metadata, DeFi protocol data (liquidity pools, lending rates), DAO proposals, and even market sentiment from decentralized social platforms.</p><p>Reason (AI Models): Equipped with advanced AI models, primarily Large Language Models (LLMs) but also other machine learning algorithms, the agents process the perceived data. They understand complex contexts, identify patterns, infer knowledge, and analyze situations to make informed decisions.</p><p>Plan (Goal-Oriented Logic): Unlike reactive chatbots, Web3 AI Agents can formulate multi-step plans to achieve specific, often complex, goals. This involves breaking down a high-level objective into a series of actionable steps within the decentralized environment. Businesses seeking to implement these sophisticated systems will often look for specialized expertise in crafting <a href=\"https://www.sparkouttech.com/ai-agent-development/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">cutting-edge AI agent development solutions</a>.</p><p>Act (On-Chain Interactions): This is where the \"Web3\" truly comes into play. Agents can execute actions directly on the blockchain by:</p><p>Sending signed transactions.</p><p>Calling smart contract functions.</p><p>Participating in decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) by voting or proposing.</p><p>Managing crypto wallets and digital assets (tokens, NFTs).</p><p>Interacting with various dApps and decentralized protocols.</p><p>Learn &amp; Adapt (Continuous Improvement): They are designed for continuous improvement, learning from the outcomes of their actions, market feedback, and new information to refine their strategies and behaviors over time. Their \"memory\" can be sustained through decentralized storage solutions, allowing for persistent context and evolving intelligence.</p><p>Self-Custody (Potential): In advanced iterations, a Web3 AI Agent might even possess its own crypto wallet, managing its own digital assets and participating directly in decentralized economies.</p><p>This combination of AI intelligence with Web3's decentralization, transparency, verifiability, and censorship resistance makes Web3 AI Agents fundamentally different from traditional, centralized AI systems.</p><p><strong>The Driving Force: Why Web3 AI Agents Now?</strong>\nThe rise of Web3 AI Agents isn't accidental; it's a culmination of several technological advancements and growing demands for a more open and efficient internet:</p><p>Maturity of LLMs: The exponential growth in LLM capabilities provides the \"brain\" for agents, enabling sophisticated natural language understanding, reasoning, and planning.</p><p>Robustness of Blockchain Infrastructure: More scalable, efficient, and interconnected blockchain networks (Layer 2s, cross-chain bridges) make on-chain interactions feasible and cost-effective for automated agents.</p><p>Demand for Decentralized Automation: As Web3 ecosystems grow in complexity (DeFi, DAOs, GameFi), the need for intelligent automation that doesn't rely on centralized intermediaries becomes critical.</p><p>Emergence of Agent Development Frameworks: Specialized frameworks (which we'll touch upon later) are making it easier for developers to build, deploy, and manage these sophisticated agents.</p><p>Focus on User Empowerment: Web3's core tenet is returning ownership and control to users. AI agents, when decentralized, align with this by offering personalized, autonomous assistance without compromising privacy or inviting censorship.</p><p>Transformative Use Cases: A Glimpse into the Future\nThe implications of Web3 AI Agents span across virtually every sector touching digital economies:</p><p><strong>Decentralized Finance (DeFi) Revolution:</strong></p><p>Autonomous Portfolio Management: AI agents can monitor countless market variables (gas fees, liquidity pool rates, token prices, lending/borrowing yields) across multiple DeFi protocols in real-time. They can then autonomously execute strategies like rebalancing portfolios, optimizing yield farming positions, or engaging in arbitrage opportunities to maximize returns and minimize risk, all without manual intervention.</p><p>Risk Management &amp; Security: Proactively identifying and responding to potential exploits or anomalies in DeFi protocols. Imagine an agent detecting a flash loan attack in progress and initiating countermeasures.</p><p>Liquidity Provisioning: Dynamically adjusting liquidity positions in decentralized exchanges based on market conditions to ensure optimal impermanent loss mitigation and fee generation.</p><p>Empowering DAO Governance:</p><p>Intelligent Proposal Summarization &amp; Analysis: DAOs often face \"voter fatigue\" due to overwhelming numbers of complex proposals. AI agents can analyze proposals, summarize key points, highlight potential impacts, and even simulate voting outcomes, providing digestible insights to human members.</p><p>Automated Voting Delegation: Members can delegate their voting power to an AI agent based on predefined criteria (e.g., \"vote for proposals promoting sustainable energy,\" \"vote against proposals increasing protocol fees\"). The agent then consistently participates on their behalf, increasing decentralization and active governance.</p><p>Treasury Management &amp; Allocation: Agents can analyze market conditions and community needs to propose or even execute optimal asset allocation strategies for DAO treasuries.</p><p><strong>Revolutionizing Web3 Gaming &amp; the Metaverse:</strong></p><p>Intelligent NPCs (Non-Player Characters): Beyond scripted behaviors, AI agents can power NPCs with dynamic personalities, adaptive dialogue, and the ability to learn and evolve. These NPCs could own their own wallets, participate in the game's economy (buying/selling NFTs, trading resources), and even initiate interactions with players based on their behavior.</p><p>Dynamic Content Generation: AI agents can procedurally generate unique in-game assets, quests, or storylines that adapt to individual player choices and game states, creating endlessly engaging experiences.</p><p>In-Game Economy Balancing: AI agents can monitor the health of a game's decentralized economy, dynamically adjusting token rewards, resource scarcity, and NFT minting rates to prevent inflation or deflation and ensure long-term sustainability.</p><p>Anti-Cheat &amp; Fraud Detection: AI agents can analyze player behavior on-chain and off-chain to detect sophisticated cheating, botting, or fraudulent activities that compromise fair play.</p><p><strong>Personalized Web3 Assistants:</strong></p><p>Onboarding &amp; Education: For new users navigating the complexities of Web3, AI agents can act as personalized guides, explaining concepts like gas fees, wallet management, token standards, and guiding them through their first dApp interactions.</p><p>Curated Information &amp; Alerts: Agents can monitor specific blockchain addresses, NFT collections, or DeFi protocols, alerting users to important events, price changes, or new opportunities tailored to their interests.</p><p>Digital Asset Management: Beyond trading, agents could help manage users' entire digital footprint, including NFT collections, managing proofs of identity, or organizing decentralized file storage.</p><p><strong>Cross-Chain Interoperability and Bridging:</strong></p><p>AI agents can monitor opportunities and liquidity across different blockchain networks, enabling seamless and optimized asset transfers or swaps between chains. They could identify the most efficient bridge or swap path for a user's assets.\nChallenges on the Path to Widespread Adoption<p>\nDespite the immense promise, Web3 AI Agents face significant hurdles that development companies and researchers are actively working to overcome:</p></p><p>Computational Cost &amp; Scalability: Running complex AI models and frequent on-chain interactions can be computationally intensive and incur high gas fees. While Layer 2 solutions and off-chain computation (with on-chain verification) are mitigating factors, optimizing efficiency remains crucial.</p><p>Data Privacy vs. Data Needs: AI models thrive on vast amounts of data, but Web3 prioritizes user privacy and data self-sovereignty. Striking a balance between providing enough data for effective AI operations and maintaining user privacy and decentralization is a complex challenge.</p><p>Security Vulnerabilities: Autonomous agents interacting with real assets on a blockchain present high-stakes security risks. Bugs in the AI's logic, vulnerabilities in smart contract interactions, or susceptibility to adversarial attacks could lead to significant financial losses. Robust auditing, formal verification, and secure execution environments are paramount.</p><p>Trust and Explainability (XAI): When an autonomous agent makes a critical decision (e.g., executing a large trade or voting on a crucial DAO proposal), users and stakeholders need to understand why that decision was made. Ensuring explainability and verifiability of agent actions is vital for building trust.</p><p>Regulatory Landscape: The legal and regulatory frameworks for autonomous AI agents, especially those handling financial transactions in a decentralized manner, are still in their infancy. This uncertainty can hinder adoption by larger institutions.</p><p>Interoperability and Standardization: While many individual agents are being developed, achieving seamless communication and collaboration between diverse AI agents across different blockchains and protocols requires common standards and robust interoperability layers.</p><p>\"Hallucinations\" and Unintended Actions: AI models, especially LLMs, can \"hallucinate\" or generate incorrect information. When this translates to autonomous actions on-chain, the consequences can be severe and irreversible. Robust guardrails, validation mechanisms, and human-in-the-loop oversight are crucial.</p><p><strong>The Road Ahead: A New Digital Frontier</strong>\nThe journey to fully realized Web3 AI Agents is a collaborative effort involving AI researchers, blockchain developers, cryptographers, and regulatory experts. Key areas of ongoing development include:</p><p>Decentralized AI Infrastructure: Building robust, scalable, and cost-effective decentralized networks that can host and power AI agents. This includes decentralized compute, storage, and oracle networks.</p><p>Agent-Specific Frameworks: Developing specialized frameworks and libraries that simplify the creation, deployment, and management of Web3 AI Agents, integrating LLM capabilities with blockchain interaction logic.</p><p>Security Primitives: Innovations in zero-knowledge proofs, secure multi-party computation, and on-chain verification to enhance the security and verifiability of agent actions.</p><p>Ethical AI Governance: Establishing clear guidelines and technical mechanisms to ensure Web3 AI Agents operate ethically, transparently, and in alignment with human values.</p><p>The emergence of Web3 AI Agents marks a pivotal moment in the digital age. They are not merely tools for automation; they are intelligent, self-sovereign entities poised to transform industries, empower individuals, and unlock unprecedented levels of efficiency and innovation in decentralized environments.</p><p>For businesses looking to fully embrace this paradigm shift, engaging with a reputable AI agent development company will be essential. If you're considering building your own intelligent entities, you'll want to <a href=\"https://www.sparkouttech.com/ai-agent-development/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">hire AI agent developer</a> talent with a deep understanding of blockchain and advanced AI. The burgeoning field of agentic AI development company will be at the forefront of this evolution, guiding organizations in integrating these powerful agents into their operations.</p><p>Web3 AI Agents promise a future where digital interactions are more intelligent, autonomous, and aligned with the principles of decentralization, setting the stage for a truly transformative digital frontier.</p>","contentLength":12669,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Best IT Company in Ahmedabad, Gujarat, India","url":"https://dev.to/cmpglobalsolutions/best-it-company-in-ahmedabad-gujarat-india-1fed","date":1750332150,"author":"CMP Global Solutions","guid":162827,"unread":true,"content":"<p><a href=\"https://www.cmpglobalsolutions.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">CMP Global Solutions</a> is a leading IT solutions company based in Ahmedabad, India, delivering cutting-edge web development, software, and mobile app services globally.

The project is <a href=\"https://github.com/The-Pocket/PocketFlow-Tutorial-Website-Chatbot\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">open-sourced on GitHub</a>.</em></p></blockquote><h2>\n  \n  \n  1. That \"Simple\" Chatbot Project... Isn't\n</h2><p>So, you want to build an AI chatbot for your website. It sounds easy enough. You call an API, write a clever prompt, and you're basically done, right?</p><p>Except for one tiny, soul-crushing detail: Your brand-new AI knows... .</p><p>It has no idea what your company sells, what your return policy is, or who you are. It's just an empty brain in a box. To make it useful, you have to feed it knowledge. And that's where the \"simple\" project becomes a total nightmare.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  The Old, Broken Way to Build a Chatbot's Brain\n</h3><p>Here’s the standard, painful process everyone seems to follow:</p><ol><li><p> First, you go on a company-wide scavenger hunt, digging through folders and old emails to find every PDF, FAQ, and policy document you can.</p></li><li><p> Then, you become a data janitor. You write a bunch of tedious scripts to chop all that messy information into clean little \"chunks\" the AI can understand.</p></li><li><p><strong>The Expensive Brain Surgery.</strong> Finally, you perform some expensive brain surgery. You set up a complicated (and often pricey) \"vector database\" and shove all those data chunks into it.</p></li></ol><p>After all that, you  have a chatbot that knows things. For about a day.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  And Now... Your Chatbot Is a Liar\n</h3><p>The moment your bot goes live, it starts to rot.</p><p>The marketing team updates the pricing page. The engineers release a new feature. Suddenly, your chatbot is confidently telling customers the wrong price. It's a walking, talking liability. You didn't build a smart AI assistant. You built a manual-syncing, high-maintenance chore that you have to babysit forever.</p><p>But what if this entire approach is wrong? What if the knowledge base wasn't some clunky database you have to constantly update? What if...  was the brain? That’s the chatbot we’re building today. A bot so simple, it feels like cheating.</p><p>This project is powered by <a href=\"https://github.com/the-pocket/PocketFlow\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">PocketFlow</a>, a tiny but mighty AI framework that makes building this kind of intelligent, looping agent incredibly straightforward. Forget vector databases and manual updates. Let's build a chatbot that just works.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  2. Our Solution: A \"Dumb\" Crawler That's Actually Smart\n</h2><p>Let's throw that entire, complicated process in the trash. We are not going to hunt for documents, clean up data, or set up a single database.</p><p>Instead, our chatbot will get its information directly from the source: your live website. Think of it like this. The old way is like printing a map once a year and hoping the roads don't change. Our new way is like using Google Maps on your phone—it's always live, always current.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  The Master Plan: Let the Bot Read\n</h3><p>Our chatbot works like a very fast, very focused intern. When a user asks a question, the bot doesn't look up the answer in some dusty old database. Instead, it visits your website and starts reading, right then and there.</p><p>Let's imagine your website has a realistic structure. A user asks a question that requires information from multiple places: <strong>\"How do I get a refund for Product A?\"</strong></p><p>The bot needs to be smart. It has to navigate the site to find  the relevant pieces of the puzzle. In the diagram below, the lines show all the possible links. The  shows the  our bot takes to find the answer.</p><p>Here's a play-by-play of the bot's clever thought process:</p><ol><li><strong>It starts on the Homepage.</strong> It sees both \"refund\" and \"Product A\" in the question. It decides to find the product page first to confirm the product's details.</li><li><strong>It navigates to the \"Product A\" page.</strong> It reads the content and finds key info, like a \"30-day warranty,\" but it doesn't find the  for actually getting a refund.</li><li><strong>It intelligently changes course.</strong> It realizes the refund steps aren't on the product page. So, it thinks like a human would: \"Okay, I need to find the general company policies.\" It navigates back to the site's main \"Support\" section to find the official information. It doesn't need a direct link; it understands the site's structure.</li><li><strong>It finds the final piece of the puzzle.</strong> On the Support page, it sees a link to \"Shipping &amp; Returns Policy,\" reads it, and learns the exact steps to submit a refund request.</li></ol><p>Now, it combines the \"30-day warranty\" from the product page with the \"how-to steps\" from the returns policy to give a perfect, comprehensive answer.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Why This is So Much Better\n</h3><p>The beauty of this approach is its simplicity.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Your Knowledge is Always Fresh:</strong> You change your pricing? The bot knows instantly. You update your team bio? The bot knows that too. There is no sync step. There is no \"stale data.\" Ever.</p></li><li><p><strong>There is Zero Maintenance:</strong> You never have to tell the bot about updates. Just update your website like you normally would, and the chatbot takes care of the rest.</p></li></ul><p>But what stops it from wandering off your site and crawling the entire internet? Simple. We give it a leash. We provide a list of approved website domains (like ) and tell it: \"You are only allowed to visit links on these sites. Don't go anywhere else.\"</p><p>This all sounds great, but building an agent that can make decisions and get stuck in a loop sounds complicated, right? You'd think you need a massive, heavy framework to manage that kind of logic.</p><p>Actually, you don't. And that’s where PocketFlow comes in.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  3. PocketFlow: The Tiny Engine That Powers Our Bot\n</h2><p>You wouldn't use a bulldozer to plant a single flower. In the same way, we don't need a massive, heavyweight AI framework for our straightforward crawling task. We need something small, fast, and built for exactly this kind of job.</p><p>That's why we're using . PocketFlow is a minimalist AI framework that's just 100 lines of code. It has zero dependencies and zero fluff. Let's look at its three core ideas.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  The Node: A Specialist Worker\n</h3><p>In PocketFlow, each task is a . A Node is like a specialist worker who is a pro at . Here’s what a Node looks like in the actual PocketFlow code:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Don't worry if  or  look weird; they're just Python things! The important bit is the  cycle:</p><ol><li>: \"Hey, I'm about to start. What info do I need from the  whiteboard?\"</li><li>: \"Okay, I have my info. Now I'll do my main job!\" (Like calling an AI).</li><li>: \"Job's done! I'll write my results to the  whiteboard and tell the manager what to do next by returning a signal (like a keyword, e.g.,  or ).\"</li></ol><h3>\n  \n  \n  The Shared Store: The Central Whiteboard\n</h3><p>This is just a plain old Python dictionary (we'll call it ). All our Node workers can read from it and write to it. It's how they pass information—like the user's question or the list of URLs to visit—to each other.</p><p>For our chatbot, it might look like this initially:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>As Nodes do their work, they'll update this  dictionary.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  The Flow: The Workshop Manager\n</h3><p>A  object is the manager of your workshop. You tell it which Node to start with, and it handles the rest. When you  a Flow, it just keeps doing one thing over and over:</p><ol><li> The Node finishes and returns a  (just a string, like ).</li><li> The Flow looks at the Node's connections to see where that signal leads, and moves to the next Node.</li></ol><p>Here's how tiny the  manager class actually is in PocketFlow:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>That's it! It starts a  loop, runs a node, gets a signal, and finds the next node. If there's no next node for that signal, the loop ends.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Tiny Math Example: PocketFlow in Action!\n</h3><p>Let's build a super-tiny workflow: take a number, add 5, then multiply by 2.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p><em>Notice  doesn't return anything? PocketFlow automatically treats that as the signal .</em></p><p><strong>Worker 2: The Multiplier Node</strong></p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p><strong>Connecting the Workers and Running the Flow:</strong></p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>If you run this, you get exactly what you'd expect:</p><div><pre><code>Starting math game with: {'number_to_process': 10}\nAddFive Node: Added 5, result is 15\nMultiplyByTwo Node: Multiplied, final answer is 30\nMath game finished. Whiteboard looks like: {'number_to_process': 10, 'intermediate_result': 15, 'final_answer': 30}\n</code></pre></div><p>See? Each Node is simple. The  dictionary carries the data. The  manager makes sure  runs, then .</p><p>Now, just swap our math workers for chatbot workers:</p><ul><li> becomes .</li><li> becomes .</li><li>  And instead of just a  signal,  will return  to loop back or  to move forward.</li></ul><p>The pattern is exactly the same. Now that we have our blueprint, let's build the three \"workers\" that make our chatbot come to life.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  4. Building the Brain: A Look Under the Hood\n</h2><p>Alright, theory's over. Let's look at the actual code that makes our chatbot's brain tick. By the end of this section, you'll understand the entire backend, from the high-level workflow down to the individual \"workers.\"</p><p><em>(Note: We've simplified the code below to focus on the core ideas. For the complete, unabridged version, you can view the full code in the <a href=\"https://github.com/The-Pocket/Website-AI-Chatbot\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">project on GitHub</a>.)</em></p><p>First, let's look at our workflow diagram. This is the entire brain of our operation: a simple loop.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  The Assembly Line Instructions ()\n</h3><p>Before we build the individual workers, let's look at the instructions that tell them how to work together. This is our  file, and it's the \"manager\" that directs the assembly line.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>That's the entire orchestration logic. It's a simple, readable blueprint for our agent's behavior.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  The Shared Whiteboard ( dictionary)\n</h3><p>Next, our workers need a central place to read and write information. This is just a simple Python dictionary that holds the state of our operation.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Now let's look at the simplified code for our three specialist nodes.</p><h4>\n  \n  \n  1. : The Librarian\n</h4><p>This  efficiently processes a list of URLs. Its job is to read a page and return its text and any new links it finds.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p> It crawls each page on its to-do list, stores the content, and adds any new, unique links to the master URL list.</p><h4>\n  \n  \n  2. : The Brain\n</h4><p>This node looks at what we've learned and decides what to do next, returning a signal to the Flow.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p> It asks the AI for a strategy ( or ) and returns that exact signal to the Flow, which knows what to do next.</p><h4>\n  \n  \n  3. : The Writer\n</h4><p>Once the Brain says , this node crafts the final response.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p> It gathers all the text we found, gives it to the AI, and asks it to write a beautiful, helpful response.</p><p>And that's the core of the system. Three simple nodes, each with a clear job, passing data through a simple dictionary.</p><p>Now that the magic is revealed (and you see it's not so magical after all), let's give our chatbot a pretty face so you can put it on your website.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  5. Giving Our Bot a Face: From Terminal to Website\n</h2><p>Okay, we have a functional AI brain that runs in the terminal. That's a great start, but it's not very useful for your website visitors.</p><p>Let's connect that brain to a user-friendly chat bubble. This is a classic web development pattern with two simple parts: a  (our Python script) and a  (the chat bubble on a website).</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  The Architecture: A Brain and a Face\n</h3><ol><li> This is our Python script, . Its only job is to wait for a question, run our PocketFlow logic to find the answer, and send the answer back. It's the powerhouse that does all the heavy lifting.</li><li> This is a small piece of JavaScript, , that you add to your website. It creates the chat icon and the chat window. When a user types a question, the JavaScript simply sends it to our backend for processing.</li></ol><p>They communicate over the network. The frontend asks a question, and the backend provides the answer.</p><p>Let's look at the minimal code that makes each part work.</p><p>We use a lightweight Python framework called  to create a simple web server. Its job is to expose a single \"endpoint\" (like a URL) that the frontend can send questions to.</p><p>Here’s the core logic in :</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p> The server waits for a POST request at . When it gets one, it runs the same PocketFlow we built before and sends the result back.</p><p>This is the JavaScript that lives on your website. It listens for the user to click \"send,\" then makes a simple web request to our Python backend.</p><p>Here's the simplified logic from :</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p> When the user sends a message, it packages up the question and sends it to the  endpoint on our server. When the server responds, it displays the answer.</p><p>Now the process is clear:</p><ol><li> First, you need to run the brain. In your terminal, run . This starts the web server and gets it ready to answer questions.</li><li><strong>Add the Frontend to a Page:</strong> Next, you add the <code>&lt;script src=\"chatbot.js\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</code> tag to your website's HTML. This makes the chat bubble appear.</li></ol><p>To make testing easy, the project includes a sample  file that already has the script included. Once your server is running, just open that file in your browser to see your live, interactive chatbot in action</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  6. Conclusion: Simple, Maintainable, and Live\n</h2><p>Let's take a step back. We just built a fully-functional AI chatbot that can intelligently answer questions about any website.</p><p>And we did it without touching a single vector database, writing a complex data-syncing script, or worrying about our information ever going stale. Its brain is your live website, which means its knowledge is always up-to-date.</p><p>This isn't just another chatbot. This is a better, simpler way to build one. Here’s why this approach wins:</p><ul><li> Your bot’s knowledge is never stale. When you update your website, you've instantly updated your chatbot. There is no sync step, ever.</li><li><strong>Practically Zero-Maintenance.</strong> You can finally \"set it and forget it.\" Your only job is to keep your website current—something you were already doing anyway.</li><li> Because the entire system is built on PocketFlow and a few straightforward Python scripts, the logic is easy to read and modify. There are no black boxes to fight with.</li></ul><p>The days of babysitting your AI are over. You now have the blueprint for a system that’s not only intelligent but also practical and sustainable.</p><p>Ready to add a real-time brain to your own website?</p><p><em>The complete, open-source code for this chatbot is waiting for you on GitHub.

This detailed, focused observation is similar to how Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) \"see\" images. These powerful algorithms are revolutionizing how computers process visual information, unlocking possibilities previously confined to the human mind.</p><p>CNNs are a specialized type of artificial neural network, designed specifically for processing data with a grid-like topology, such as images and videos. Unlike traditional neural networks that treat data as a flat sequence, CNNs leverage the spatial relationships within data, making them exceptionally effective at image recognition, object detection, and more.</p><p><strong>Understanding the Core Concepts:</strong></p><p>At the heart of a CNN lies the \"convolution\" operation. Think of it like a magnifying glass sliding across an image. This magnifying glass, called a filter or kernel, is a small matrix of weights. As it moves across the image, it multiplies its weights with the corresponding pixel values under it, summing the results to produce a single number. This number represents a feature extracted from that specific area of the image. For example, one filter might be sensitive to edges, another to corners, and another to textures.</p><p>This process is repeated across the entire image, creating a feature map – a representation of the image highlighting the presence and location of specific features. Multiple filters are used simultaneously, each detecting different features, resulting in multiple feature maps. These maps are then typically passed through a pooling layer, which downsamples the data, reducing its dimensionality while preserving important features. This process helps to make the network more efficient and less sensitive to small variations in the input.</p><p>The output of the pooling layer then feeds into further convolutional and pooling layers, progressively extracting higher-level features. Finally, the extracted features are fed into a fully connected layer, similar to those in traditional neural networks, which performs the final classification or prediction.</p><p><strong>Significance and Problem Solving:</strong></p><p>CNNs address the long-standing challenge of enabling computers to understand and interpret visual information. Before CNNs became prevalent, image recognition relied on hand-crafted features and rules, a laborious and often inaccurate process. CNNs, however, learn these features directly from the data, achieving remarkable accuracy and efficiency.</p><p><strong>Applications and Transformative Impact:</strong></p><p>The impact of CNNs is far-reaching and spans numerous industries:</p><ul><li>  CNNs are used for disease detection in X-rays, MRIs, and CT scans, assisting radiologists in making faster and more accurate diagnoses.  They can detect subtle anomalies often missed by the human eye.</li><li>  Object detection and recognition are crucial for autonomous vehicles.  CNNs enable cars to identify pedestrians, vehicles, traffic signs, and other obstacles, ensuring safe navigation.</li><li>  From unlocking smartphones to security systems, CNNs power facial recognition technologies.  While raising ethical concerns (discussed below), their accuracy is continuously improving.</li><li><strong>Satellite Imagery Analysis:</strong>  CNNs analyze satellite images to monitor deforestation, track urban sprawl, and assess the impact of natural disasters.</li><li>  CNNs help robots navigate complex environments, recognize objects, and perform tasks requiring visual input.</li><li><strong>Image Enhancement and Restoration:</strong>  CNNs are used to improve the quality of images, removing noise, sharpening details, and even inpainting missing parts of an image.</li></ul><p><strong>Challenges, Limitations, and Ethical Considerations:</strong></p><p>Despite their remarkable success, CNNs face several challenges:</p><ul><li>  CNNs require vast amounts of labeled data for training, which can be expensive and time-consuming to obtain.</li><li>  Training large CNNs can be computationally intensive, requiring powerful hardware and significant energy consumption.</li><li><strong>Explainability (Black Box Problem):</strong>  Understanding why a CNN makes a particular prediction can be difficult, raising concerns about transparency and accountability, especially in critical applications like medical diagnosis.</li><li>  CNNs can inherit biases present in the training data, leading to unfair or discriminatory outcomes.  Addressing this requires careful data curation and model evaluation.</li><li><strong>Security and Adversarial Attacks:</strong>  CNNs can be vulnerable to adversarial attacks, where small, almost imperceptible changes to an image can lead to misclassification.  This poses security risks in applications like autonomous driving and security systems.</li></ul><p><strong>Conclusion: A Future Shaped by Sight</strong></p><p>Convolutional Neural Networks represent a significant advancement in artificial intelligence, revolutionizing our ability to process and understand visual information. While challenges remain, particularly concerning data bias and explainability, the potential benefits are immense. As research continues and computational power increases, CNNs will undoubtedly play an even more crucial role in shaping the future across various sectors, from healthcare and transportation to environmental monitoring and beyond.

This was the challenge that sparked \"Yuh Hear Dem,\" our submission for the . The project began as a father-daughter mentoring journey into AI and evolved into a powerful tool for civic engagement in Barbados. It combines deep experience in backend AI architecture with a fresh perspective on user experience, guided by principles from the world of education. This blend allowed us to build a system that is not only technically sophisticated but also genuinely accessible, transforming the way citizens can interact with their government.</p><p>This post details our technical journey, from the initial data pipeline to a crucial architectural pivot, all powered by Google's Agent Development Kit (ADK), Gemini, and a Knowledge Graph backend.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  The Problem: From Hours of Video to Actionable Insight\n</h3><p>Parliamentary sessions in Barbados, like in many places, are published as long-form YouTube videos. Finding what a specific minister said about a particular topic, like the \"sugar tax,\" requires manually scrubbing through hours of footage. This creates a significant barrier to civic engagement.</p><p>Our goal was to transform this unstructured data into a structured, queryable format, allowing any citizen to ask a natural language question and get a direct, source-verified answer.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  The Solution: An AI-Powered Parliamentary Research Assistant\n</h3><p>\"Yuh Hear Dem\" (Bajan dialect for \"Did you hear them?\") is a conversational agent that allows users to query parliamentary data. A user can ask, <em>\"What has been discussed about the sugar tax?\"</em> and receive a concise summary, direct quotes from MPs, and links to the exact moments in the source videos.</p><p>The system is built on a sophisticated Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline that combines the semantic power of vector search with the structured precision of a knowledge graph.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  The Technical Architecture: A Three-Stage Pipeline\n</h3><p>Our system is built on a robust data processing and retrieval pipeline.</p><p><strong>1. Ingest, Clean, Extract</strong></p><p>The foundation of our system is a structured knowledge base built from raw, messy transcripts.</p><ul><li> We start by ingesting the full YouTube transcripts from hundreds of parliamentary session videos—over 1,200 hours of content.</li><li> The raw transcripts are often riddled with grammatical errors and misattributions. We use  to clean and structure this text, correcting grammar, identifying speakers, and aligning the text with accurate video timestamps.</li><li> With clean, timestamped text, we use Gemini again to perform entity and relationship extraction. It identifies people, topics, bills, and the connections between them (e.g., \"Minister X  Bill Y\"). This structured data, including over 33,000 nodes and 86,000 statements, is stored in .</li></ul><p>This process creates a rich, interconnected Knowledge Graph that forms the backbone of our agent's \"brain.\"</p><p><strong>2. Hybrid Retrieval with GraphRAG</strong></p><p>When a user asks a question, the agent doesn't just rely on a simple semantic search. It uses a hybrid retrieval strategy:</p><ul><li> We run a vector search over MongoDB Atlas embeddings to find semantically similar transcript segments. This is great for broad, topic-based queries.</li><li> We traverse the entities and relationships in our knowledge graph to find precise connections (e.g., <code>Minister -&gt; Topic -&gt; Session</code>). This excels at specific, factual queries.</li></ul><p>The results are combined and ranked using a hybrid scoring model (GraphRAG), giving us the best of both worlds. Critically, every piece of information is grounded in video timestamps, allowing us to generate direct links to the source.</p><p><strong>3. The Agent Architecture Evolution: A Lesson in Pragmatism</strong></p><p>Our journey with ADK taught us a valuable lesson about the current state of multi-agent frameworks.</p><p><strong>The Original Vision: A Multi-Agent Pipeline</strong></p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Initially, we designed a classic multi-agent system using a . The idea was to have a clear separation of concerns:</p><ul><li> The main entry point.</li><li><strong>ResearchPipeline ():</strong><ul><li> Collects data from our knowledge graph.</li><li> Enriches the data with video sources and timestamps.</li><li> Synthesizes the final response.</li></ul></li></ul><p><strong>The Roadblock: Session State Management</strong></p><p>We quickly hit a wall. We found that  was not being reliably shared between the agents in our  pipeline. The  would fetch data, but by the time the flow reached the  or , the state was often empty or corrupted.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>This appears to be a known challenge, which we tracked in <a href=\"https://github.com/google/adk-python/issues/1119\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">GitHub Issue #1119</a>. This roadblock became a critical learning moment: while the theory of multi-agent systems is powerful, the practical implementation can be fraught with state management complexities.</p><p><strong>The Pivot: A Robust Single-Agent Solution</strong></p><p>To solve this, we refactored our architecture into a <strong>single intelligent agent with a set of specialized function tools</strong>. This approach proved to be far more reliable and easier to debug.</p><p>The agent maintains context reliably, and the tools are called synchronously, ensuring data is passed correctly.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>This pragmatic pivot allowed us to achieve our desired modularity—with each tool handling a specific task—without the overhead and unreliability of inter-agent state management.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  The User Experience: Making AI Accessible\n</h3><p>Technology is only as good as its interface. Our focus on educational design was instrumental here. The frontend was built to make the agent's powerful capabilities accessible to everyone.</p><p>Key design principles included:</p><ul><li> Information is presented in expandable cards, preventing cognitive overload. Users see a high-level summary first and can expand for details.</li><li> We used D3.js to create interactive knowledge graphs, helping users visually understand the relationships between speakers, topics, and sessions.</li><li> The agent uses the knowledge graph to generate relevant follow-up questions, guiding users on natural exploration paths.</li></ul><h3>\n  \n  \n  Conclusion and What's Next\n</h3><p>\"Yuh Hear Dem\" is more than just a technical demo; it's a functioning tool for enhancing democratic transparency. Our journey taught us several key lessons:</p><ol><li> Combining knowledge graphs and vector search provides superior retrieval accuracy.</li><li> While multi-agent state sharing needs maturing, ADK’s single-agent with function tools model is incredibly robust for building complex, reliable AI systems.</li><li> A simpler, more reliable architecture is often better than a theoretically \"purer\" but fragile one.</li><li><strong>Human-Centered Design is Key:</strong> An intuitive UI, grounded in learning principles, is essential for making powerful AI accessible and useful.</li></ol><p>We invite you to explore the project yourself.</p><p>Our next steps involve expanding the data sources to include official legislative documents and exploring a return to a multi-agent architecture as the ADK framework evolves. For now, we're proud to have built a tool that helps citizens hear what really matters.</p>","contentLength":6914,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"QuCode - 21DaysChallenge - Day 18","url":"https://dev.to/paulobmsousa/qucode-21dayschallenge-day-18-2im1","date":1750287826,"author":"Paulo B.M.

Here's a complete AI tracer bullet for a document classification system—the kind of thing that could take months to \"do properly\" but can be validated in days.</p><p>I'll show you two implementations: Python (Flask) for data science teams and JavaScript (Node.js) for frontend-heavy teams:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p><strong>For JavaScript/Node.js teams</strong>, here's the equivalent tracer bullet:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><h3>\n  \n  \n  🔍 What Makes This a Tracer Bullet?\n</h3><p>This isn't just a prototype—it's a  that proves the concept:</p><ol><li>: Accepts messy input, handles edge cases</li><li>: Uses a real model, not mock responses</li><li>: Other systems can integrate with it</li><li>: Runs as a service, includes health checks</li><li>: Logs performance, catches errors</li></ol><p>You can deploy this to a cloud service today and start getting real user feedback.

When it wasn't viable, I pivoted early instead of doubling down on a doomed approach.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  🔧 <strong>Real Integration Challenges</strong></h3><p>I discovered that our \"95% accurate\" sentiment model was useless because inference took 45 seconds. The tracer bullet forced us to find a faster model before we'd invested months in the slow one.</p><p>Showing a working demo (even a simple one) gets way more excitement than showing accuracy charts. Non-technical stakeholders can actually  the tracer bullet.</p><p>Each iteration adds one more critical piece. Maybe it's better data processing, maybe it's model optimization, maybe it's UI improvements. You're always building on something that works.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  📊 Real Case Study: E-commerce Content Moderation\n</h2><p>Let me share a concrete example from a client project that demonstrates the power of AI tracer bullets:</p><p>: An e-commerce platform needed to automatically moderate user-generated product reviews for inappropriate content (spam, hate speech, fake reviews).</p><p> (what they almost did):</p><ul><li>📊 Spend 8-12 weeks building a custom classification model\n</li><li>🧪 Achieve 94% accuracy on curated test data</li><li>💾 Require 16GB RAM and custom GPU infrastructure</li><li>📝 Total estimated cost: $150k and 6 months to production</li></ul><p><strong>Our Tracer Bullet Approach</strong> (what we actually did):</p><p>: Built the Node.js tracer bullet using OpenAI's moderation API</p><ul><li>⚡ 3 days to working end-to-end demo</li><li>🔧 Integrated with their existing review system</li><li>📊 Started processing real user reviews immediately</li></ul><ul><li>✅  on real production data (better than planned custom model!)</li><li>⚡ <strong>200ms average response time</strong> (vs. projected 45 seconds)</li><li>💰 <strong>$500/month operational cost</strong> (vs. $150k development cost)</li><li>🚀 <strong>Zero infrastructure changes</strong> needed</li></ul><p> that saved the project:</p><ol><li><strong>API latency was acceptable</strong>: 200ms vs. feared \"too slow for real-time\"</li><li>: 10k reviews/day fit well within API limits\n</li><li><strong>Edge cases were different</strong>: Real spam was simpler than test data suggested</li><li><strong>Integration was the hard part</strong>: Not the AI, but webhook reliability and error handling</li></ol><ul><li>🎯  instead of 6 months</li><li>💰  in development costs</li><li>📈  due to cleaner review sections</li><li>🔄 : Easy to swap AI providers or add custom models later</li></ul><p>This is the power of AI tracer bullets: <strong>real validation with real metrics in real time</strong>.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  🚀 Beyond POCs: Production-Ready Thinking\n</h2><p>The magic of AI tracer bullets isn't just speed—it's that they force you to think like a production system from day one:</p><ul><li>: How do you validate inputs?</li><li>: How do you know if it's working?</li><li>: Can it handle real load?</li><li>: How do you update the model?</li></ul><p>According to recent research:</p><ul><li> show that 85% of AI projects fail to reach production</li><li> indicate average AI POC takes 6 months, but 70% never see production</li><li> demonstrate API-based inference is 3-10x faster than local deployment for most use cases</li></ul><p>The primary reason for failures? Teams focus on model accuracy instead of system integration. AI tracer bullets flip this priority.</p><p>💡 : Use Hugging Face Inference Endpoints for your first tracer bullet—they handle scaling, caching, and model optimization automatically. Perfect for validating concepts before committing to infrastructure.</p><p>💡 : Always log three metrics from day one: inference time, input size, and error rate. These will guide your scaling decisions later.</p><p>💡 : Network timeouts kill user experience. Set aggressive timeouts (5-10s max) and always have fallback responses ready.</p><p>The next time you're tempted to spend weeks perfecting a model in isolation, try this instead:</p><div><table><thead><tr></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Identify smallest end-to-end slice</td><td>Clear success/failure criteria</td></tr><tr><td>Use pre-trained models, cloud APIs</td><td>Working demo in days, not weeks</td></tr><tr><td>Use messy, incomplete real data</td><td>Discover real blockers early</td></tr><tr><td>Track performance, accuracy, UX</td><td>Data-driven decisions for v2</td></tr><tr><td>Let usage drive next improvements</td><td>Continuous value delivery</td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>Remember: The goal isn't to build the perfect AI system. It's to prove your concept can work in the real world, then make it better.</p><p>💡 : Pick one of the code examples above, replace the model with your use case (OpenAI API, Google Vision, etc.), and deploy to Vercel/Heroku in under an hour. You'll learn more in that hour than in weeks of model tweaking.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  📚 Resources &amp; Further Reading\n</h2><h3>\n  \n  \n  🎯 Recommended Tools for Tracer Bullets\n</h3><ul><li> - Rapid deployment of ML model interfaces</li><li> - Ultra-fast APIs for AI services</li><li> - Containerization for reproducible deployments</li></ul><h3>\n  \n  \n  📊 Share Your Experience: AI Tracer Bullets in Practice\n</h3><p>Help improve this methodology by sharing your experience in the comments or on social media with :</p><p><strong>Key questions to consider</strong>:</p><ul><li>What's the shortest time you've gone from AI idea to working prototype?</li><li>Which cloud AI services surprised you with speed/accuracy for rapid validation?</li><li>What integration challenges did you discover that notebooks never showed?</li><li>Have you found cases where the tracer bullet became your production system?</li></ul><p><em>Your insights help the AI development community learn faster validation techniques.</em></p><p>In our next commandment, we'll explore why your AI models should be \"good enough\" instead of perfect, and how optimization can actually hurt your project's success.</p><p>Have you tried building AI tracer bullets?

You're not alone! Many developers find themselves wrestling with boilerplate code and confusing configurations. FastAPI swoops in as a modern, high-performance web framework for building APIs with Python 3.7+ that's actually  to use. This guide will walk you through creating your first production-ready FastAPI application, even if you're a complete beginner.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  What Makes FastAPI So Special?\n</h2><p>Why choose FastAPI over other frameworks like Flask or Django REST Framework? Well, FastAPI offers several key advantages:</p><ul><li> Built on top of Starlette and Pydantic, FastAPI delivers blazing-fast performance, comparable to NodeJS and Go.</li><li><strong>Automatic Data Validation:</strong> Pydantic handles data validation and serialization, reducing errors and simplifying your code.</li><li><strong>Automatic API Documentation:</strong> FastAPI generates interactive API documentation (using Swagger UI and ReDoc) automatically, making it easy to test and explore your API.</li><li> Leverages Python type hints for improved code readability and maintainability.</li><li> A powerful design pattern built right in that simplifies testing and code organization.</li></ul><p>Let's dive into creating a simple \"To-Do\" API to illustrate these features.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Setting Up Your Environment\n</h2><p>Before we write any code, let's set up our development environment. I recommend using a virtual environment to isolate your project's dependencies.</p><ol><li><p><strong>Create a Virtual Environment:</strong></p><p>Open your terminal and navigate to your project directory. Then, run the following command:</p></li><li><p><strong>Activate the Virtual Environment:</strong></p></li></ol><div><pre><code>*   On macOS/Linux:\n\n    bash\n    source venv/bin/activate\n\n*   On Windows:\n\n    bash\n    venv\\Scripts\\activate\n</code></pre></div><ol><li><p><strong>Install FastAPI and Uvicorn:</strong></p><p>Uvicorn is an ASGI (Asynchronous Server Gateway Interface) server that we'll use to run our FastAPI application. Run this command to install both:</p><p>bash\npip install fastapi uvicorn</p></li></ol><p>That's it! Your environment is ready.</p><p> A virtual environment keeps your project dependencies separate, avoiding conflicts. Always activate it before working on your project.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Building Your First API Endpoint\n</h2><p>Now for the fun part! Let's create a simple API endpoint that returns a list of to-do items. Create a file named  in your project directory and add the following code:</p><p>python\nfrom fastapi import FastAPI\nfrom pydantic import BaseModel</p><p>class Todo(BaseModel):\n    id: int\n    completed: bool = False</p><p>todos = [\n    Todo(id=1, task=\"Learn FastAPI\", completed=True),<p>\n    Todo(id=2, task=\"Build a to-do API\", completed=True),</p>\n    Todo(id=3, task=\"Deploy the API\", completed=False),</p><p>@app.get(\"/todos\", response_model=List[Todo])\nasync def get_todos():<p>\n    \"\"\"Retrieves all to-do items.\"\"\"</p>\n    return todos</p><p>@app.post(\"/todos\", response_model=Todo)\nasync def create_todo(todo: Todo): # Notice the type hinting! FastAPI validates the incoming data against the Todo model<p>\n    \"\"\"Creates a new to-do item.\"\"\"</p>\n    todos.append(todo)</p><p>Let's break down what's happening here:</p><ol><li> We import  to create our application,  for type hinting, and  from  to define our data model.</li><li> We define a  class using . This class represents a to-do item and includes fields for , , and . Pydantic handles automatic validation and serialization based on this model.</li><li> We create an instance of the  class, which will be our main application object.</li><li>  We create a list of sample  objects for demonstration purposes.</li><li> We define a GET endpoint at  using the  decorator.  The <code>response_model=List[Todo]</code> argument tells FastAPI to serialize the returned data as a list of  objects. The  keyword indicates that this is an asynchronous function, which is crucial for FastAPI's performance.</li><li> We define a POST endpoint also at  using the  decorator. This endpoint takes a  object as input (notice the type hint ). FastAPI automatically validates the incoming data against the  model. If the data is invalid, FastAPI will return an error response. The new  is appended to the  list and returned.</li></ol><p>✅   FastAPI uses type hints extensively.  This not only improves code readability but also enables automatic data validation and API documentation.</p><p>To run your API, execute the following command in your terminal:</p><p>bash\nuvicorn main:app --reload</p><ul><li> is the name of the file where your FastAPI application is defined.</li><li> is the name of the FastAPI instance.</li><li> enables automatic reloading, so your server will restart whenever you make changes to your code.   Don't use  in production!</li></ul><p>Now, open your browser and navigate to <code>http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs</code>. You should see the Swagger UI, which provides interactive documentation for your API. You can use it to test your endpoints.</p><p> Uvicorn runs your FastAPI app. The  flag is great for development but avoid it in production.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Going Further: Automatic API Documentation\n</h2><p>One of the coolest features of FastAPI is its automatic API documentation. As you saw in the previous step, navigating to  provides a Swagger UI interface.  FastAPI also provides an alternative documentation interface at .</p><p>FastAPI generates this documentation based on the type hints and docstrings in your code. This makes it incredibly easy to keep your API documentation up-to-date.</p><p>✅   Write clear and concise docstrings for your API endpoints.  These docstrings will be displayed in the API documentation.</p><p> Embrace FastAPI's auto-generated docs. It saves time and keeps your API understandable.</p><p>In this tutorial, you've learned how to create a simple yet powerful API using FastAPI. You've seen how FastAPI leverages type hints, Pydantic, and automatic documentation to streamline the development process.</p><p>Next steps?

Should I refactor it?\"</em></p>\n\n<p>Picture this: It's Monday morning ☕, you're cranking through tickets, and your AI assistant just spit out two nearly identical authentication functions for different microservices. Your inner developer screams \"DRY violation!\" 🚨 and you're about to extract that shared logic into a utility function.</p>\n\n<p>But hold up. What if that knee-jerk reaction is actually wrong in 2025?</p>\n\n<p>Look, I've been there. We've all been trained to spot duplication and eliminate it like it's a bug 🐛. But working with AI assistants has made me question everything. When your AI can regenerate 50 lines of code in 10 seconds ⚡, when your microservices are owned by different teams 👥, and when that \"simple\" abstraction turns into a configuration nightmare 😵‍💫—maybe duplication isn't the enemy we thought it was.</p>\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  📚 DRY: The Rule We All Learned (And Maybe Learned Too Well)\n</h2>\n\n<p>If you've read <em>The Pragmatic Programmer</em> (and if you haven't, go fix that 📖), you know DRY stands for \"Don't Repeat Yourself.\" Hunt and Thomas taught us that every piece of knowledge should have a single, authoritative representation in our system.</p>\n\n<p>And honestly? It's been great advice for 25 years. DRY gave us:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>🎯 One place to fix bugs</strong>: Change once, fix everywhere</li>\n<li>\n<strong>🔄 Consistent behavior</strong>: No more hunting down that one function that does validation slightly differently</li>\n<li>\n<strong>🧹 Less code to maintain</strong>: Fewer places for things to go wrong</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>But here's the thing—DRY also creates coupling 🔗. And if you're building microservices in 2025, coupling is basically kryptonite ☢️.</p>\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  🤖 Why AI Changes Everything (And I Mean Everything)\n</h2>\n\n<p>Working with AI assistants like GitHub Copilot has completely flipped the script on duplication. Here's what I've noticed in my own projects:</p>\n\n<h3>\n  \n  \n  ⚡ \"Just Generate It Again\"\n</h3>\n\n<p>Remember spending an hour crafting the perfect abstraction? Now my AI can regenerate that validation logic in 30 seconds. The math has changed—sometimes it's faster to just ask for a new version than to understand and modify an existing abstraction.</p>\n\n<h3>\n  \n  \n  🤷‍♂️ AI Doesn't Know Your Codebase\n</h3>\n\n<p>Your AI assistant is brilliant at patterns, but it doesn't know about that <code>AuthUtils</code> class you wrote six months ago. It'll happily generate new code instead of reusing existing modules. Fighting this feels like swimming upstream 🏊‍♂️.</p>\n\n<h3>\n  \n  \n  🏃‍♂️💨 Teams Move at Different Speeds\n</h3>\n\n<p>When your user service team needs to ship GDPR compliance changes while your billing team is still figuring out PCI requirements, shared code becomes a coordination nightmare 😱.</p>\n\n<p>Let me show you three real scenarios where I've actually been <em>glad</em> my AI generated duplicate code:</p>\n\n<h3>\n  \n  \n  🔧 Scenario 1: \"Why Won't This Shared Validator Work?\"\n</h3>\n\n<p>My AI generated input validation for user registration across three services. Each service had <em>slightly</em> different requirements. I spent two hours trying to make a generic validator that could handle all three cases. The result? A mess of configuration flags and optional parameters that nobody on my team could understand without reading the implementation.</p>\n\n<h3>\n  \n  \n  🚰 Scenario 2: \"The ETL That Couldn't Be Shared\"\n</h3>\n\n<p>Similar data transformation logic across multiple ETL pipelines, but each one had weird edge cases for different data sources. Every time I tried to abstract it, I ended up with callback hell or configuration objects that were longer than the original functions.</p>\n\n<h3>\n  \n  \n  📡 Scenario 3: \"API Responses That Look Similar But Aren't\"\n</h3>\n\n<p>Three different endpoints that format responses in similar ways, but with service-specific metadata, error codes, and business logic. The shared formatter became this frankenstein 🧟‍♂️ of conditional logic that was harder to understand than just having three focused functions.</p>\n\n<p>Sound familiar? If you've been working with AI-generated code, I bet you've hit these exact situations.</p>\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  ✅ My 5-Question \"Should I DRY This?\" Checklist\n</h2>\n\n<p>After getting burned by premature abstraction one too many times 🔥, I developed this simple checklist. When my AI generates duplicate code, I ask myself these five questions:</p>\n\n<h3>\n  \n  \n  1. 👥 <strong>Who Owns This Code?</strong>\n</h3>\n\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Keep it separate if</strong>: Different teams, different repos, different deploy schedules</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Maybe refactor if</strong>: Same team, same codebase, releases happen together</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><em>Real talk: Cross-team shared code is a coordination nightmare. I learned this the hard way. 💀</em></p>\n\n<h3>\n  \n  \n  2. 🔄 <strong>Will This Logic Evolve Differently?</strong>\n</h3>\n\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Keep it separate if</strong>: Each instance will likely change for different business reasons</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Maybe refactor if</strong>: Changes will always happen in lockstep</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><em>User management auth rules change differently than payment processing rules. Always. 🏦 vs 👤</em></p>\n\n<h3>\n  \n  \n  3. 🧩 <strong>How Complex Would the Abstraction Be?</strong>\n</h3>\n\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Keep it separate if</strong>: You'd need config objects, callbacks, or feature flags</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Maybe refactor if</strong>: The shared function would be genuinely simpler</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><em>If your abstraction needs a README to explain how to use it, you've gone too far. 📄➡️😵</em></p>\n\n<h3>\n  \n  \n  4. ⚡ <strong>Can AI Regenerate This Faster Than I Can Modify It?</strong>\n</h3>\n\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Keep it separate if</strong>: \"Just ask Copilot\" is faster than \"figure out the shared utility\"</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Maybe refactor if</strong>: The abstraction is so simple that modification is trivial</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><em>This one still feels weird to me, but it's true. Sometimes regeneration beats refactoring. 🤯</em></p>\n\n<h3>\n  \n  \n  5. 🐛 <strong>Which Approach Makes Debugging Easier?</strong>\n</h3>\n\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Keep it separate if</strong>: Service-specific functions give clearer stack traces and test scenarios</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Maybe refactor if</strong>: Centralized logic would actually simplify troubleshooting</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><em>When your payment processing fails at 2 AM 🌙, you want obvious, focused functions, not a generic validator with 20 configuration options.</em></p>\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  💻 Real Code: When Duplication Actually Won\n</h2>\n\n<p>Let me show you a real example from a project I worked on.

Different teams (user team vs. payments team)</li>\n<li>\n<strong>🔄 Evolution</strong>: ✅ User management rules change for compliance, payment rules change for fraud prevention</li>\n<li>\n<strong>🧩 Complexity</strong>: ✅ A shared function would need configuration for admin checks, transaction limits, different email validation rules</li>\n<li>\n<strong>⚡ Speed</strong>: ✅ Copilot can regenerate these in seconds if needed</li>\n<li>\n<strong>🐛 Debugging</strong>: ✅ When payments fail, I want to see <code>validate_payment_authentication</code> in my stack trace, not <code>generic_validator</code>\n</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>The alternative would've been some monster function with config objects:<br>\n</p>\n\n<div class=\"highlight js-code-highlight\">\n<pre

I'll take the readable, focused functions every time. 👍</p>\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  🎯 The Bottom Line\n</h2>\n\n<p>Look, I'm not saying DRY is dead ⚰️. I'm saying the context has changed, and we need to adapt.</p>\n\n<p>In 1999, writing code was expensive and slow 🐌. Abstractions saved us time and mental energy. In 2025, AI can generate code faster than we can think 🧠💨, and the real cost is coordination overhead and cognitive load.</p>\n\n<p><strong>My new rule</strong>: <em>Optimize for team velocity and understanding, not just eliminating duplication.</em> 🚀</p>\n\n<p>Here's what this looks like in practice:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>🏠 Within a service/team</strong>: Still DRY. Same team, same codebase, same release cycle.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>🌐 Across service boundaries</strong>: Be okay with duplication. Different teams, different constraints, different evolution paths.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>🤖 When AI suggests duplication</strong>: Ask the 5 questions before reflexively refactoring.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>🤔 When abstractions get complex</strong>: Step back. Maybe duplication is the right choice.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  🔮 What's Next\n</h2>\n\n<p>This is just the first \"commandment\" in what I hope will be a useful series about AI-assisted development. The goal isn't to throw out everything we've learned—it's to evolve our practices for a world where AI is our pair programming partner 🤝.</p>\n\n<p>Next up: Why your AI should generate <em>imperfect</em> code, and why that's actually a feature, not a bug. 🐛➡️✨</p>\n\n\n\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  💬 Your Turn\n</h2>\n\n<p>I'm curious about your experiences 🤔. Have you found yourself keeping AI-generated duplication? What's your threshold for when to refactor vs. when to leave it alone?</p>\n\n<p>Drop a comment below—I read every one 👀, and I'm genuinely interested in how other developers are navigating this new world 🌍.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Tags</strong>: #ai #dry #pragmatic #python #microservices #softwarearchitecture</p>\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong>References:</strong><br>\n[1] Hunt, A., &amp; Thomas, D.

By adding a Python bridge layer, I actually simplified the overall system while gaining standard compliance and better security.</p>\n\n<p>If you're building MCP support into your macOS app, consider whether a bridge architecture might work better than direct implementation. The initial setup might seem more complex, but the long-term benefits are worth it.</p>\n\n<p>The complete code for Chimr is available on GitHub, and I'd love to hear about your experiences implementing MCP in native applications!</p>\n\n\n\n\n<p><em>Have you implemented MCP in a native application?<br>\nWhat architecture did you choose?

It’s free and easy to get. On the other hand, other types of data that could be useful for forecasting, like financial statements or market sentiment, are often harder to find, and can be really (sometimes really) expensive.</p>\n\n<p>Because of that, a lot of people have tried to predict the stock market using just price data, especially the closing price. You can find plenty of articles showing models that seem to do a good job, with predicted prices that look very close to the actual ones. But in many cases, these articles don’t include proper evaluation, even basic metrics like MAE or MSE are often missing.</p>\n\n<p>So that got me thinking: Can we actually forecast stock prices using only past prices? In this article, I’ll try to answer that by testing some of the popular models floating around online and evaluating them using a simple (but honest) approach.</p>\n\n<p>If you’re curious or want to dig into the details, everything’s available on <a href=\"https://github.com/yoest/estytech-labs/blob/master/can-we-forecast-closing-price/code.ipynb\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Github</a>. I didn’t include the import statements here to keep things clean, but you’ll find all the code, data, and setup over there.</p>\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  What data am I using?\n</h2>\n\n<p>Stock price data is easy to find online, so feel free to use whatever source you prefer. For this article, I’m using a dataset I’ve already parsed and cleaned. It includes 17,610 rows of data from 10 well-known companies, covering the period from January 1, 2018 to January 1, 2025.<br>\n</p>\n\n<div class=\"highlight js-code-highlight\">\n<pre class=\"highlight python\"><code><span class=\"n\">df</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"n\">pd</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nf\">read_csv</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"sh\">'</span><span class=\"s\">data.csv</span><span class=\"sh\">'</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"n\">index_col</span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"mi\">0</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n<span class=\"n\">df</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nf\">head</span><span class=\"p\">()</span>\n</code></pre>\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"table-wrapper-paragraph\"><table>\n  <thead>\n    <tr>\n      <th></th>\n      <th>symbol</th>\n      <th>date</th>\n      <th>close</th>\n    </tr>\n  </thead>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <th>0</th>\n      <td>AAPL</td>\n      <td>2024-12-31</td>\n      <td>250.42</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>1</th>\n      <td>AAPL</td>\n      <td>2024-12-30</td>\n      <td>252.20</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>2</th>\n      <td>AAPL</td>\n      <td>2024-12-27</td>\n      <td>255.59</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>3</th>\n      <td>AAPL</td>\n      <td>2024-12-26</td>\n      <td>259.02</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>4</th>\n      <td>AAPL</td>\n      <td>2024-12-24</td>\n      <td>258.20</td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table></div>\n\n<p>I’m framing this as a time series problem, where the input (X) is just the past closing prices, and the target is the return over the next x days. Why use return instead of the price itself? Mainly because prices can vary a lot between companies: a $10 stock and a $1,000 stock behave very differently in raw numbers.

But at least now you have some code handy if you want to try it out yourself.</p>\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  Time to Run Some Models\n</h2>\n\n<p>Now for the fun part: forecasting! But before we jump in, let’s set up all the models we’ll need. I’m a big fan of Object-Oriented Programming, so we’ll start by creating some classes to keep things organized.</p>\n\n<h3>\n  \n  \n  Our Base Classes\n</h3>\n\n<p>Since some models require a PyTorch dataset, we’ll create a simple one using our X and y data.<br>\n</p>\n\n<div class=\"highlight js-code-highlight\">\n<pre class=\"highlight python\"><code><span class=\"k\">class</span> <span class=\"nc\">TimeSeriesDataset</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">Dataset</span><span class=\"p\">):</span>\n\n    <span class=\"k\">def</span> <span class=\"nf\">__init__</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">self</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"n\">X</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"n\">np</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"n\">ndarray</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"n\">y</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"n\">np</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"n\">ndarray</span><span class=\"p\">):</span>\n        <span class=\"n\">self</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"n\">X</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"n\">torch</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nf\">tensor</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">X</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"n\">dtype</span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"n\">torch</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"n\">float32</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n        <span class=\"n\">self</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"n\">y</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"n\">torch</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nf\">tensor</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">y</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"n\">dtype</span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"n\">torch</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"n\">float32</span><span class=\"p\">).</span><span class=\"nf\">unsqueeze</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"mi\">1</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n\n    <span class=\"k\">def</span> <span class=\"nf\">__len__</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">self</span><span class=\"p\">):</span>\n        <span class=\"k\">return</span> <span class=\"nf\">len</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">self</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"n\">y</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n\n    <span class=\"k\">def</span> <span class=\"nf\">__getitem__</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">self</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"n\">idx</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"nb\">int</span><span class=\"p\">):</span>\n        <span class=\"k\">return</span> <span class=\"n\">self</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"n\">X</span><span class=\"p\">[</span><span class=\"n\">idx</span><span class=\"p\">],</span> <span class=\"n\">self</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"n\">y</span><span class=\"p\">[</span><span class=\"n\">idx</span><span class=\"p\">]</span>\n</code></pre>\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>Now let’s look at our base class. You can think of it like a blueprint for all the models we’ll use. It helps keep things simple and organized. Basically, the class just needs to handle three things: predicting from input, training if needed, and evaluating how well it did.</p>\n\n<p>For evaluation, we’ll keep it simple with MAE, MSE, and RMSE. But since we’re dealing with stock forecasting, I also added a little custom metric: it checks if the predicted and actual returns have the same sign. If yes, it counts as 1, if not, 0. Then we average this over the test set. It’s a neat way to measure if the model got the direction right, which, in stock trading, is often as important as the exact price.<br>\n</p>\n\n<div class=\"highlight js-code-highlight\">\n<pre class=\"highlight python\"><code><span class=\"k\">class</span> <span class=\"nc\">Model</span><span class=\"p\">:</span>\n\n    <span class=\"k\">def</span> <span class=\"nf\">__init__</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">self</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"n\">name</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"nb\">str</span><span class=\"p\">):</span>\n        <span class=\"n\">self</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"n\">name</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"n\">name</span>\n        <span class=\"n\">self</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"n\">abbr</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"sh\">''</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nf\">join</span><span class=\"p\">([</span><span class=\"n\">c</span> <span class=\"k\">for</span> <span class=\"n\">c</span> <span class=\"ow\">in</span> <span class=\"n\">name</span> <span class=\"k\">if</span> <span class=\"n\">c</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nf\">isupper</span><span class=\"p\">()])</span> <span class=\"k\">if</span> <span class=\"nf\">len</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">name</span><span class=\"p\">)</span> <span class=\"o\">&gt;</span> <span class=\"mi\">10</span> <span class=\"k\">else</span> <span class=\"n\">name</span>\n        <span class=\"n\">self</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"n\">model</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"bp\">None</span>  <span class=\"c1\"># Placeholder for the actual model instance\n</span>\n    <span class=\"k\">def</span> <span class=\"nf\">predict</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">self</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"n\">X</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"n\">as_numpy</span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"bp\">True</span><span class=\"p\">):</span>\n        <span class=\"c1\"># This method should be implemented by subclasses\n</span>        <span class=\"k\">raise</span> <span class=\"nc\">NotImplementedError</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"sh\">\"</span><span class=\"s\">Subclasses should implement this method.</span><span class=\"sh\">\"</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n\n    <span class=\"k\">def</span> <span class=\"nf\">train</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">self</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"n\">X_train</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"n\">y_train</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"n\">X_val</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"n\">y_val</span><span class=\"p\">):</span>\n        <span class=\"c1\"># Optional method to train the model (if applicable).

I Using?\n</h3>\n\n<p>We’ll be trying out 6 models, ranging from the very simple to the more advanced. These are the kinds you’ll often see in online articles: a naive baseline, linear regression, random forest, an MLP, an LSTM, and a transformer-based model. I won’t dive into the inner workings of each one here (there are tons of great explanations out there, or just ask ChatGPT), but we’ll see how they perform on our task.</p>\n\n<p>Let’s start with a naive model. It simply assumes that the best prediction is no change at all, that the price will stay the same. Sure, it sounds trivial, but it’s actually a really useful baseline. If more complex models don’t outperform this one, it’s a good sign that something might be off in how we’re approaching the problem.<br>\n</p>\n\n<div class=\"highlight js-code-highlight\">\n<pre class=\"highlight python\"><code><span class=\"k\">class</span> <span class=\"nc\">NaiveModel</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">Model</span><span class=\"p\">):</span>\n\n    <span class=\"k\">def</span> <span class=\"nf\">__init__</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">self</span><span class=\"p\">):</span>\n        <span class=\"nf\">super</span><span class=\"p\">().</span><span class=\"nf\">__init__</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"sh\">\"</span><span class=\"s\">Naive</span><span class=\"sh\">\"</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n\n    <span class=\"k\">def</span> <span class=\"nf\">predict</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">self</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"n\">X</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"n\">np</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"n\">ndarray</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"n\">as_numpy</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"nb\">bool</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"bp\">True</span><span class=\"p\">):</span>\n        <span class=\"k\">return</span> <span class=\"n\">np</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nf\">zeros</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">X</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"n\">shape</span><span class=\"p\">[</span><span class=\"mi\">0</span><span class=\"p\">])</span>\n</code></pre>\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>Next up are two classics: a simple linear regression and a random forest.

alt=\"Results of our analysis with based metrics like RMSE, MAE, and so on.\" width=\"790\" height=\"590\"></a></p>\n\n<p>Alright, here comes the reality check. I hope you weren’t expecting anything crazy, because the results say otherwise. From the simple naive model all the way to the transformer, the MAE numbers are pretty much the same. No big difference there. The only metric that makes a bit of sense is the “correct direction,” which is zero for the naive model since it doesn’t actually try to predict if the price goes up or down. The other models hover around 50%, which basically means they’re guessing the direction as well as flipping a coin. The other metrics are just as low across the board.</p>\n\n<p>So what does this mean? Either the models weren’t trained properly or didn’t have enough data (which seems unlikely here), or, more likely, the closing prices alone just don’t hold enough clues to make accurate predictions. Bit of a bummer, but that’s the reality.</p>\n\n<p>If you want to take a look at some price predictions over time for a specific stock, I’ve got you covered:<br>\n</p>\n\n<div class=\"highlight

alt=\"Price prediction over a given period for the baselines for AAPL\" width=\"800\" height=\"578\"></a></p>\n\n<p>You’ll notice that most of the predictions just lag behind the actual curve, basically following the true prices, but with a 10-day delay. This is something you’ll often see in many articles, except they usually use a 1-day forecast, which can misleadingly make the model look perfect. But in reality, it’s not performing as well as it seems.</p>\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  So... is it all hopeless?\n</h2>\n\n<p>Not quite, but let’s be honest: trying to forecast the market using just the closing price might be no better than rolling a dice. You can experiment by adding open, high, low, and volume, but chances are, it won’t drastically change the outcome. And indicators? Sure, they might help a bit, but in the end, they’re just nonlinear combinations of those same variables. I’m not saying they’re useless, just don’t expect miracles.</p>\n\n<p>So, am I saying it’s impossible to predict the market? Definitely not. But I am saying that freely available data like this is... well, freely available for a reason. If you really want to move the needle, you probably need access to richer, harder-to-get data. Think sentiment, fundamentals, financial reports, macro stuff. The kind of data that’s not sitting in a CSV file online.</p>\n\n<p>That said, even if the predictions don’t blow your mind, this kind of project is still one of the coolest ways to dive into machine learning, data science, and finance all at once. So seriously, go explore, test things, tweak models. It’s a great learning experience.</p>\n\n<p>Tiny disclaimer before I wrap up: I’m one of the co-founders of <a href=\"https://zelyos.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Zelyos</a>, an AI-powered stock picker that focuses exactly on this: bringing in the not-so-easy-to-find data to build better forecasts. So of course, I’m biased. But I’m also just sharing the lessons we’ve learned from building and experimenting. And hey, I genuinely hope you don’t fully agree with me. I’d love to hear your take.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>None of this is financial advice. I’m pretty sure by now it’s clear that it’s not nearly enough to rely on. This is all for learning and exploration, nothing more.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Thanks so much for reading. I hope you had fun, and I’d really love to hear your thoughts!</p>\n\n","contentLength":0,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"I made a custom social media platform.

But with the rise of asynchronous programming, FastAPI has entered the scene as a modern, lightning-fast alternative. In this post, we’ll compare FastAPI and Flask head-to-head to help you decide which framework is the best fit for your next project.</p>\n\n<p><strong>1. Setup &amp; Simplicity</strong><br>\n<strong>Flask</strong>: Minimalist, very easy to get started</p>\n\n<p><strong>FastAPI</strong>: Also easy, but requires understanding of type hints and Pydantic</p>\n\n<p>Code snippets for basic “Hello World” app in both</p>\n\n<p><strong>2. Performance</strong><br>\nBenchmark comparison (Uvicorn + FastAPI outperforms Flask with WSGI)</p>\n\n<p>Async support is built-in for FastAPI</p>\n\n<p>Flask can do async but it’s limited and requires extra setup</p>\n\n<p><strong>3. Data Validation</strong><br>\n<strong>FastAPI</strong>: Uses Pydantic for auto-validation</p>\n\n<p><strong>Flask</strong>: Needs manual validation or libraries like Marshmallow</p>\n\n<p>Example: input validation for a POST API</p>\n\n<p><strong>4. Dependency Injection &amp; Modular Code</strong><br>\nFastAPI has built-in dependency injection</p>\n\n<p>Flask needs third-party packages (e.g., Flask-Injection)</p>\n\n<p><strong>5. Swagger &amp; Documentation</strong><br>\nFastAPI auto-generates Swagger UI and ReDoc</p>\n\n<p>Flask requires extensions like Flask-RESTPlus or Flask-Swagger</p>\n\n<p><strong>🛠 6. Ecosystem &amp; Maturity</strong><br>\nFlask: Larger community, tons of extensions</p>\n\n<p>FastAPI: Rapidly growing, backed by strong devs like Sebastián Ramírez</p>\n\n<p>Flask better for older, stable enterprise apps</p>\n\n<p>FastAPI better for modern, async-first microservices</p>\n\n<p><strong>When to Choose What? (Decision Table)</strong></p>\n\n<div class=\"table-wrapper-paragraph\"><table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Criteria</th>\n<th>Choose Flask if...</th>\n<th>Choose FastAPI if...</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Simplicity &amp; Setup</td>\n<td>You want a minimal setup</td>\n<td>You prefer modern tooling with type hints</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Performance</td>\n<td>Performance isn’t a top priority</td>\n<td>You need async support and speed</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Validation</td>\n<td>You’re okay with manual validation</td>\n<td>You want auto-validation using Pydantic</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>API Documentation</td>\n<td>You’ll write docs manually or use plugins</td>\n<td>You want Swagger/ReDoc out-of-the-box</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Dependency Injection</td>\n<td>Not a major requirement</td>\n<td>You prefer built-in DI for clean modular code</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Community &amp; Ecosystem</td>\n<td>You rely on a large, mature community</td>\n<td>You want a modern and fast-growing framework</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Best Use Case</td>\n<td>Monoliths, small projects</td>\n<td>Microservices, modern scalable APIs</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table></div>\n\n<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>\n\n<p>Flask is still a strong choice for simple, traditional web apps, but FastAPI is rapidly becoming the preferred framework for high-performance APIs.

nearly every web application — from login and registration to onboarding and settings. In this tutorial, we’ll explore how to construct a <strong>modular, reusable form interface</strong> using <strong>Tailwind CSS</strong> alongside <strong>Django</strong>, the popular Python web framework.</p>\n\n\n\n\n<h3>\n  \n  \n  Why Tailwind + Django?\n</h3>\n\n<p>Django provides powerful form abstractions like validation, rendering, and error handling. But the default rendering isn’t styled for modern UI. Tailwind solves this with a <strong>utility-first</strong> approach — giving you full control over styling, responsiveness, and accessibility.</p>\n\n\n\n\n<h3>\n  \n  \n  Styling Django Forms with Tailwind\n</h3>\n\n<p>To make Django forms look great with Tailwind, you can:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Override default widgets</li>\n<li>Inject custom CSS classes into form fields</li>\n<li>Use third-party packages like <code>django-crispy-forms</code> or <code>django-widget-tweaks</code>\n</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Here’s how to style a text input manually:<br>\n</p>\n\n<div class=\"highlight js-code-highlight\">\n<pre class=\"highlight python\"><code><span class=\"kn\">from</span> <span class=\"n\">django</span> <span class=\"kn\">import</span> <span class=\"n\">forms</span>\n\n<span class=\"k\">class</span> <span class=\"nc\">ContactForm</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">forms</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"n\">Form</span><span class=\"p\">):</span>\n    <span class=\"n\">name</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"n\">forms</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nc\">CharField</span><span class=\"p\">(</span>\n        <span class=\"n\">widget</span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"n\">forms</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nc\">TextInput</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">attrs</span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"p\">{</span>\n            <span class=\"sh\">'</span><span class=\"s\">class</span><span class=\"sh\">'</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"sh\">'</span><span class=\"s\">block w-full px-4 py-2 border rounded-md text-gray-900 focus:ring-2 focus:ring-indigo-500 focus:outline-none</span><span class=\"sh\">'</span>\n        <span class=\"p\">})</span>\n    <span class=\"p\">)</span>\n</code></pre>\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>Tailwind’s classes give your input a clean, accessible look with smooth focus styles.</p>\n\n\n\n\n<h3>\n  \n  \n  Form Layout with Tailwind Utilities\n</h3>\n\n<p>Use Tailwind’s layout utilities to structure the form:<br>\n</p>\n\n<div class=\"highlight js-code-highlight\">\n<pre class=\"highlight html\"><code><span class=\"nt\">&lt;form</span> <span class=\"na\">class=</span><span class=\"s\">\"space-y-6\"</span><span class=\"nt\">&gt;</span>\n  <span class=\"nt\">&lt;div&gt;</span>\n    <span class=\"nt\">&lt;label</span> <span class=\"na\">for=</span><span class=\"s\">\"email\"</span> <span class=\"na\">class=</span><span class=\"s\">\"block text-sm font-medium text-gray-700\"</span><span class=\"nt\">&gt;</span>Email<span class=\"nt\">&lt;/label&gt;</span>\n    <span class=\"nt\">&lt;input</span> <span class=\"na\">id=</span><span class=\"s\">\"email\"</span> <span class=\"na\">name=</span><span class=\"s\">\"email\"</span> <span class=\"na\">type=</span><span class=\"s\">\"email\"</span> <span class=\"na\">required</span>\n      <span class=\"na\">class=</span><span class=\"s\">\"mt-1 block w-full px-4 py-2 border rounded-md text-gray-900 focus:ring-indigo-500 focus:ring-2 focus:outline-none\"</span><span class=\"nt\">&gt;</span>\n  <span class=\"nt\">&lt;/div&gt;</span>\n\n  <span class=\"nt\">&lt;div&gt;</span>\n    <span class=\"nt\">&lt;button</span> <span class=\"na\">type=</span><span class=\"s\">\"submit\"</span>\n      <span class=\"na\">class=</span><span class=\"s\">\"bg-indigo-600 hover:bg-indigo-700 text-white font-semibold py-2 px-4 rounded-md\"</span><span class=\"nt\">&gt;</span>\n      Submit\n    <span class=\"nt\">&lt;/button&gt;</span>\n  <span class=\"nt\">&lt;/div&gt;</span>\n<span class=\"nt\">&lt;/form&gt;</span>\n</code></pre>\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>For multi-column forms:<br>\n</p>\n\n<div class=\"highlight js-code-highlight\">\n<pre class=\"highlight html\"><code><span class=\"nt\">&lt;div</span> <span class=\"na\">class=</span><span class=\"s\">\"grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 gap-6\"</span><span class=\"nt\">&gt;</span>\n  <span class=\"c\">&lt;!-- Two inputs side-by-side --&gt;</span>\n<span class=\"nt\">&lt;/div&gt;</span>\n</code></pre>\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<h3>\n  \n  \n  Error Handling with Style\n</h3>\n\n<p>Render Django form errors like this:<br>\n</p>\n\n<div class=\"highlight js-code-highlight\">\n<pre class=\"highlight html\"><code>{% if form.name.errors %}\n  <span class=\"nt\">&lt;p</span> <span class=\"na\">class=</span><span class=\"s\">\"text-sm text-red-600 mt-1\"</span><span class=\"nt\">&gt;</span>{{ form.name.errors.0 }}<span class=\"nt\">&lt;/p&gt;</span>\n{% endif %}\n</code></pre>\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>Maintain clear feedback without breaking your layout.</p>\n\n\n\n\n<h3>\n  \n  \n  Reusable Patterns &amp;

<strong>critical part of building reliable APIs</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>In this FastAPI example, you learned how to:</p>\n\n<p>✅ Raise built-in exceptions like <code>HTTPException</code> for standard error cases<br><br>\n🌐 Register global handlers (e.g., for <code>ValueError</code>) to keep your code DRY and consistent<br><br>\n🧑‍🎨 Create custom exceptions like <code>PaymentFailedError</code> to match real-world business scenarios  </p>\n\n\n\n\n<h3>\n  \n  \n  🔍 Real-World Relevance\n</h3>\n\n<p>Here’s how this maps to real-world applications:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>\n<code>HTTPException</code>: Missing resources like <code>/user/0</code>, <code>/product/9999</code> → <strong>404 Not Found</strong>\n</li>\n<li>\n<code>ValueError</code>: Invalid input like dividing by zero or parsing errors → <strong>400 Bad Request</strong>\n</li>\n<li>\n<code>Custom Exceptions</code>: Payment failures, quota limits, licensing errors → <strong>Business-specific error codes</strong> like <strong>402 Payment Required</strong>, <strong>429 Too Many Requests</strong>, etc.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n\n<h3>\n  \n  \n  🚀 Pro Tip\n</h3>\n\n<p>With well-structured exception handling:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Your API becomes more <strong>developer-friendly</strong>\n</li>\n<li>Your errors are easier to <strong>log, debug, and trace</strong>\n</li>\n<li>You leave room to plug in <strong>monitoring tools</strong>, <strong>custom logging</strong>, or even <strong>alerting systems</strong>\n</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  🙏 Credits\n</h2>\n\n<p>Huge thanks to the <a href=\"https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/\"

They’ve become a go-to assistant for both day-to-day questions and deeper research tasks.</p>\n\n<p>Whether the goal is business innovation or a personal project, building an effective GenAI workflow means understanding a handful of core capabilities and components. One of the most important is component is <strong>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  🧠 What is RAG?\n</h2>\n\n<p><strong>RAG</strong> is a technique/design pattern that improves the quality and relevance of LLM responses by combining two core capabilities:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Retrieval</strong>: Pulling relevant documents or facts from an external knowledge source (like a vector database or search engine).</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Generation</strong>: Using a foundational model (e.g., from OpenAI, AWS, etc.) to generate natural language answers.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Augmentation</strong>: Enriching the model’s input prompt by injecting the retrieved content to provide context that the LLM alone wouldn't otherwise have.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n\n<h3>\n  \n  \n  ⚽ Example Use Case\n</h3>\n\n<p>Imagine you’re building a sports Q&amp;A assistant. A user asks:<br><br>\n<strong>\"Who scored the winning goal in the last Barcelona match?\"</strong></p>\n\n<p>Rather than relying solely on the LLM’s trained knowledge (which may be outdated), the RAG pipeline:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Retrieves up-to-date match stats, player performance data, and venue context from your internal index or search service.</li>\n<li>Appends that information to the user's question.</li>\n<li>Sends the enriched prompt to the LLM, which then generates a precise and relevant answer.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2F2z83hkhqx6do9t2hq56j.jpeg\" class=\"article-body-image-wrapper\"><img src=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2F2z83hkhqx6do9t2hq56j.jpeg\" alt=\"RAG Architecture\" width=\"800\" height=\"804\"></a></p>\n\n\n\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  Build a Simple GenAI Workflow with ES and OpenAI\n</h2>\n\n<h3>\n  \n  \n  🛠️ Setup and Code Walkthrough\n</h3>\n\n<h4>\n  \n  \n  1.

Here are some reasons why you should use Glowscript:</p>\n\n<p>Number one, Glowscript is simple and intuitive. Glowscript has no indentation, and a lot of possibilities. Looping works like a goto/call, and if statements are contained within loops.</p>\n\n<p>Number two, Glowscript allows you to handle data simply and easily. While Glowscript doesn't currently have tools for exporting or editing files, it can process data, and edit it simply and easily.</p>\n\n<p>Number three, Glowscript is free. Glowscript is completely free and open source, and all you need to use it is a python compiler and the github repo shown at the top of the article.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, Glowscript is fun!

This, in essence, is the basic idea behind a Feedforward Neural Network (FNN), also known as a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP). While the \"gossip\" might be data, and the \"whisper\" a calculation, the underlying principle of information flowing in one direction remains the same. These networks, a cornerstone of artificial intelligence, are surprisingly simple in their fundamental design yet capable of solving incredibly complex problems.</p>\n\n<p>FNNs are a type of artificial neural network – a computer system inspired by the biological neural networks in our brains. Unlike their biological counterparts, however, FNNs are structured in layers. These layers are typically organized into three main sections: the input layer, one or more hidden layers, and the output layer.</p>\n\n<p><strong>The Information Highway: How FNNs Process Data</strong></p>\n\n<p>Think of the input layer as the starting point of our gossip chain. Each \"gossip\" (neuron) in this layer represents a single feature of the input data. For example, if we're trying to predict house prices, input neurons might represent square footage, number of bedrooms, and location. Each input neuron passes its information to the neurons in the next layer – the hidden layer(s).</p>\n\n<p>The hidden layers are where the magic happens. Each neuron in a hidden layer receives weighted inputs from the previous layer. These weights represent the strength of the connection between neurons – a strong connection means a higher weight. The neuron then sums up these weighted inputs and applies an activation function. This function introduces non-linearity, allowing the network to learn complex patterns that a simple linear model couldn't. Think of the activation function as the \"gossip's opinion\" – it modifies the information before passing it on. This process repeats through multiple hidden layers, with each layer learning increasingly complex features from the data.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, the output layer receives information from the last hidden layer and produces the final result – the prediction. For our house price prediction example, the output layer would provide a predicted price. The entire process is \"feedforward,\" meaning information flows only in one direction, from input to output, without loops or feedback.</p>\n\n<p><strong>The Significance of FNNs:  Solving Real-World Problems</strong></p>\n\n<p>FNNs are significant because of their remarkable ability to learn complex patterns from data. This ability allows them to solve problems that are difficult or impossible for traditional algorithms to handle. They excel at tasks involving pattern recognition, classification, and prediction. This makes them incredibly versatile and applicable to a wide range of fields.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Applications Across Industries:</strong></p>\n\n<p>The transformative impact of FNNs is evident across various sectors:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Image Recognition:</strong> FNNs are at the heart of image recognition systems used in self-driving cars, facial recognition software, and medical image analysis.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Natural Language Processing:</strong>  From machine translation to sentiment analysis, FNNs power many NLP applications, enabling computers to understand and generate human language.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Financial Modeling:</strong>  Predicting stock prices, detecting fraud, and assessing credit risk are just some applications of FNNs in finance.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Medical Diagnosis:</strong>  FNNs can analyze medical images and patient data to assist in diagnosing diseases like cancer, improving accuracy and speed.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Robotics:</strong>  FNNs enable robots to learn and adapt to their environment, performing complex tasks with greater autonomy.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Challenges and Ethical Considerations:</strong></p>\n\n<p>Despite their power, FNNs are not without limitations:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Data Dependency:</strong>  FNNs require large amounts of high-quality data to train effectively.  Biased or incomplete data can lead to inaccurate or discriminatory results.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Black Box Nature:</strong>  Understanding exactly how an FNN arrives at its predictions can be challenging, making it difficult to interpret its decisions and identify potential errors.  This \"black box\" nature raises concerns about transparency and accountability.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Computational Cost:</strong>  Training large FNNs can be computationally expensive, requiring significant processing power and time.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Overfitting:</strong>  FNNs can sometimes overfit the training data, performing well on the training set but poorly on unseen data.  Techniques like regularization and cross-validation are used to mitigate this risk.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Ethical Concerns:</strong>  The use of FNNs in areas like facial recognition and loan applications raises ethical concerns about privacy, bias, and potential misuse.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>The Future of FNNs:</strong></p>\n\n<p>FNNs, despite their challenges, remain a cornerstone of modern AI. Ongoing research focuses on improving their efficiency, transparency, and robustness. Techniques like deep learning, which involves using multiple hidden layers to create \"deep\" networks, have significantly expanded the capabilities of FNNs. As computational power continues to increase and data availability expands, we can expect FNNs to play an even greater role in shaping the future of technology and various industries. Their ability to learn and adapt from data makes them invaluable tools for solving complex problems and driving innovation across diverse fields. However, addressing the ethical implications and ensuring responsible development and deployment will be crucial to harnessing their full potential for the benefit of society.</p>\n\n","contentLength":0,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"📦Beginner-Friendly Guide \"Divide Array Into Arrays With Max Difference\" LeetCode

Yeah, that's exactly what happened with my async event bus.</p>\n\n<p>So I’ve made this post a while ago. <a href=\"https://www.kubaszwajka.com/Simple-Yet-Powerful-Building-an-In-Memory-Async-Event-Bus-in-Python-18a2997bdce3805f8bdcfd5ee4431a21\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Simple Yet Powerful: Building an In-Memory Async Event Bus in Python</a>. And now I’ve changed my mind. I’ve found some serious problems while debugging the app. And I learn something? </p>\n\n<p>Approach described in this post have some flaws. And we need to talk about them to be more aware about what we are doing. </p>\n\n<p>Ofc. I encourage you to read this but short TLDR. </p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>We have Fastapi server with async event bus. </li>\n<li>Something important in our app happened → <code>EventBus.publish(event)</code>  and forget. </li>\n<li>We return the response to the user and we don’t care if handler succeed or not. </li>\n<li><strong>fire, forget and don’t care</strong></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>For more context I will add that this bus was implemented with sync SQLAlchemy engine. Which is somehow connected also to all the problems I had and how I found them. The second problem was (And here's where it gets interesting…) <em>the scope of the db transaction</em>. </p>\n\n<p>To the point. I will give you a few scenarios that my system was ✨<em>supporting✨.</em> </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>There was a meeting between two people. Person A did cancel the meeting and notification system failed. Person B is still waiting cuz there was no notification. Risk? Lets say moderate.</li>\n<li>Someone was in onboarding process. Based on the role he choose, proper stripe account should be created. If I had error in stripe request, This person never got his account onboarded cuz there was no retry to create this account. Risk? A bit higher?</li>\n<li>Person A requested additional payment from Person B. Person B agreed (<code>EventBus.publish(dispute.resolved)</code>). Stripe failed because there were funds missing on a card. Risk? <strong>🚨 Money == high risk 🚨</strong>\n</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>And other problems. I don’t want to go into this domain details but I’ve noticed that as soon as we leave the ‘happy path’ the problems appears. And they are all the same: </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>We are loosing events.</strong></li>\n<li><strong>We have wrong transaction scope.</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><em>So the refactor started…</em> </p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>First I’ve tackled the scope of transaction. I’ve moved the scope from single operation in repo to be a http request scope. So the commit was on the very end. Only when <strong>ALL</strong> operations succeeded.\n</li>\n<li>Then I’ve reworked all methods to be async and switched the SQLAlchemy to be async engine. Still I don’t know why I initially do it sync. 🤷 There was so many problems I’ve found here with lazy loading to be fixed. Basically I found that I was lazy loading half of my app. </li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Ok, at this point we’ve tackled the <strong>wrong transaction scope.</strong> Right now if I choose the role of the user, related to stripe connected account, and the second part will fail, the role setup will fail also. And just to be clear. This was the design decision to avoid weird states. </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>user clicks → <strong>Role123</strong> → Response: Ups! we couldn’t setup your account correctly. Please try again.   ****</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>We don’t have any leftovers because we were in single transaction scope and there was a rollback because of exception. This was something I wanted. </p>\n\n<p>But now, we not only can loose events but also we are publishing events we shouldn’t! </p>\n\n<p>Look here.

So we have this table of events to be processed. Periodically we can fetch them and ask <code>EventBus</code> to point the correct event handler by <code>event_type</code>. <br>\nThat’s it. I’ve used FastApi background task for it.<br>\n</p>\n\n<div class=\"highlight js-code-highlight\">\n<pre class=\"highlight python\"><code><span class=\"k\">async</span> <span class=\"k\">def</span> <span class=\"nf\">_loop</span><span class=\"p\">():</span>\n    <span class=\"k\">while</span> <span class=\"bp\">True</span><span class=\"p\">:</span>\n        <span class=\"k\">try</span><span class=\"p\">:</span>\n            <span class=\"n\">events_count</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"k\">await</span> <span class=\"n\">EventBus</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nf\">flush_outbox</span><span class=\"p\">()</span>\n        <span class=\"k\">except</span> <span class=\"nb\">Exception</span> <span class=\"k\">as</span> <span class=\"n\">exc</span><span class=\"p\">:</span>\n            <span class=\"n\">_logger</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nf\">error</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"sa\">f</span><span class=\"sh\">'</span><span class=\"s\">outbox loop error: </span><span class=\"si\">{</span><span class=\"n\">exc</span><span class=\"si\">}</span><span class=\"sh\">'</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n        <span class=\"k\">await</span> <span class=\"n\">asyncio</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nf\">sleep</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"mf\">0.2</span><span class=\"p\">)</span> <span class=\"c1\"># Check every 200ms -

With big traffic we can now monitor if we are falling behind with event processing. Look here.<br>\n</p>\n\n<div class=\"highlight js-code-highlight\">\n<pre class=\"highlight python\"><code><span class=\"c1\"># Simple monitoring query I use:\n</span><span class=\"n\">SELECT</span> <span class=\"nc\">COUNT</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"o\">*</span><span class=\"p\">)</span> <span class=\"n\">FROM</span> <span class=\"n\">events_outbox</span> <span class=\"n\">WHERE</span> <span class=\"n\">status</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"sh\">'</span><span class=\"s\">pending</span><span class=\"sh\">'</span><span class=\"p\">;</span>\n<span class=\"c1\"># If this keeps growing, something's broken \n</span></code></pre>\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>I throw this into a simple dashboard. If I see the number climbing, I know either:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>My handlers are too slow</li>\n<li>I need more workers</li>\n<li>Something's broken in the processing loop</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Before? I had no clue if events were getting lost. Now I can actually see the queue building up.</p>\n\n<p>And this story more or less ends here right now. From my perspective? Easier to test, easier to compose, more predictable… </p>\n\n<p>But..</p>\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  🚨 Risks and problems\n</h2>\n\n<p>Now, this solution isn't perfect - let me show you what's still broken. I can see two of them right now. </p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Two workers picks the same event to process. So lets say you are scaling up and suddenly two processes can pick the same event to process and publish. That means we have <strong>At least one delivery</strong>. Maybe more? </p>\n\n<p>Quick fix I can think of is to create some kind of lock on events we are processing. But this is not covered here. </p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>What if we have multiple handlers of the same events. <code>event.status=PROCESSES</code> means who processed? First? Second? All of them? </p>\n\n<p>And this is probably the biggest issue here. If we fail on processing in one handler and second will succeed we break <strong>At least one delivery.</strong> </p>\n\n<p>From the publisher perspective (outbox) we did our job. And here comes the role of the consumer. Solution? Maybe next blog post will be about inbox pattern? </p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Anyway, that's how I stopped losing events before they could cost me real money. Pretty sure there are more edge cases waiting to bite me…</p>\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  Want more? 🤔\n</h2>\n\n<p>Leave a like or comment and feed the algorithm! Easy for you and give me a lot of boost.

However, the inherent complexity of these architectures often results in \"black-box\" models, making it difficult to interpret how specific inputs influence corresponding outputs. This paper proposes a novel mechanism called <strong>Multi-layer Attentional Interception Layer (MAIL)</strong>. MAIL is a customizable layer that can be integrated into MIMO-DL architectures to provide granular interpretability, allowing for the \"interception\" and analysis of learned interactions between subsets of specific inputs and outputs. We present the theoretical formulation of MAIL, a detailed Python implementation using TensorFlow/Keras, and discuss its potential to advance the interpretability of MIMO-DL systems.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Keywords:</strong> Multiple Inputs Multiple Outputs (MIMO), Deep Learning, Interpretability, Attention, Neural Networks, Keras, Python, XAI (Explainable AI).</p>\n\n<p><strong>1. Introduction</strong></p>\n\n<p>Deep neural networks have demonstrated remarkable success across a wide range of applications. Particularly, systems with Multiple Inputs and Multiple Outputs (MIMO) are essential in scenarios where diverse sources of information need to be processed to generate a set of responses or predictions. Examples include recommendation systems, robotics, signal processing in telecommunications (e.g., Massive MIMO), and modeling complex systems in healthcare.</p>\n\n<p>Despite their predictive power, the interpretability of deep learning models, especially MIMO ones, remains a significant challenge. The ability to understand <em>which</em> inputs or input features are most influential for <em>which</em> specific outputs is crucial for model debugging, domain knowledge validation, trust-building, and ensuring fairness. Traditional interpretability approaches often provide global insights or are applied post-hoc, potentially not fully capturing the specific internal dynamics of input-output pathways in MIMO systems.</p>\n\n<p>Attention mechanisms have proven effective in highlighting relevant parts of the input that contribute to a given output, particularly in natural language processing and computer vision tasks. Inspired by this success, we propose the <strong>Multi-layer Attentional Interception Layer (MAIL)</strong>, a neural layer designed to be integrated into MIMO-DL models. MAIL aims to explicitly learn and expose attention weights governing the relationships between groups of specific inputs and outputs, allowing for a clear \"interception\" of these influences.</p>\n\n<p>Our contributions are:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>  The formulation of a new attentional layer, MAIL, for MIMO-DL systems.</li>\n<li>  A detailed implementation of the MAIL layer in Python using TensorFlow/Keras, demonstrating its practical applicability.</li>\n<li>  A discussion on how MAIL can be utilized to enhance interpretability and facilitate the analysis of MIMO-DL models.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>2. Related Works</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>2.1. MIMO Neural Networks</strong><br>\nMIMO architectures in deep learning vary considerably, from simple concatenations of input feature vectors processed by a shared network to more complex structures with multiple processing branches that eventually merge or generate independent outputs. The Keras Functional API, for example, facilitates the creation of such models. The central challenge lies in managing and interpreting the flow of information through these multiple pathways. Works like MixMo explore ways to mix multiple inputs for multiple outputs through sub-networks.</p>\n\n<p><strong>2.2. Attention Mechanisms</strong><br>\nAttention mechanisms were introduced to allow models to focus on specific parts of the input sequence when generating an output. The core concept involves calculating attention weights (scores) which are then used to create a weighted representation of the inputs. Variations such as self-attention and multi-head attention have become fundamental components of state-of-the-art architectures like Transformers. The application of attention in MIMO systems, while promising, is still a developing area, with some research focused on specific applications like channel estimation in wireless communications.</p>\n\n<p><strong>2.3. Interpretability in Deep Learning (XAI)</strong><br>\nInterpretability in machine learning, and more specifically in deep learning, is an active research field. XAI methods can be broadly categorized into:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>  <strong>Inherently interpretable models:</strong> Models like shallow decision trees, linear regression, or generalized additive models (GAMs).</li>\n<li>  <strong>Post-hoc methods:</strong> Techniques that explain an already trained model, such as LIME, SHAP, or gradient-based analysis.</li>\n<li>  <strong>Attention-based methods:</strong> Where the attention weights themselves can serve as a form of explanation, indicating which parts of the input were considered important.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Researchers from institutions like Stanford have actively explored interpretability, including optimizing models to be inherently interpretable or developing new explanation techniques. Our work aligns with the idea of building interpretability directly into the model's architecture through custom attention mechanisms.</p>\n\n<p><strong>3. Proposed Methodology: MAIL (Multi-layer Attentional Interception Layer)</strong></p>\n\n<p>We propose a MAIL layer that can be inserted into a MIMO-DL architecture. The core idea is that for a set of <code>N</code> input streams and <code>M</code> desired output streams, the MAIL layer will learn attentional representations that explicitly model the contribution of each input stream (or a processed combination thereof) to each output stream.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Conceptual Architecture of MAIL:</strong></p>\n\n<ol>\n<li> <strong>Multiple Inputs:</strong> The layer accepts a list of input tensors <code>[X_1, X_2, ..., X_N]</code>, where each <code>X_i</code> represents a distinct data stream.</li>\n<li> <strong>Input Processing/Combination (Optional, but Recommended):</strong> Before the main attention mechanism, inputs can be processed individually (e.g., by CNNs, RNNs, or Dense layers) and/or combined (e.g., concatenation, weighted sum). To simplify the initial presentation of MAIL, we will assume that the inputs are concatenated, forming a tensor <code>X_concat</code>.</li>\n<li> <strong>Attention Heads per Output:</strong> For each of the <code>M</code> output streams, MAIL instantiates a dedicated \"attention head.\" Each attention head <code>j</code> (for <code>j=1...M</code>) is responsible for learning a set of attention weights <code>alpha_j</code> over <code>X_concat</code>. These weights indicate the relevance of different features in <code>X_concat</code> for generating the output <code>Y_j</code>.\n\n<ul>\n<li>  Mathematically, for each output head <code>j</code>, the attention weights <code>alpha_j</code> can be calculated, for example, through a small neural network (e.g., a Dense layer with softmax activation) that maps <code>X_concat</code> to the weights:\n<code>e_j = Dense_j(X_concat)</code>\n<code>alpha_j = softmax(e_j)</code>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li> <strong>Attention Application:</strong> The attention weights <code>alpha_j</code> are then used to modulate <code>X_concat</code>, creating a representation <code>C_j</code> (context vector) specific to output <code>j</code>:\n<code>C_j = alpha_j * X_concat</code> (element-wise multiplication)</li>\n<li> <strong>Generation of Multiple Outputs:</strong> Each context vector <code>C_j</code> is then processed by an output sub-network (e.g., one or more Dense layers) to produce the final output <code>Y_j</code>.\n<code>Y_j = OutputDense_j(C_j)</code>\n</li>\n<li> <strong>Interception:</strong> The learned attention weights <code>alpha_j</code> for each output head can be extracted and visualized. This allows for \"intercepting\" and analyzing which parts of the concatenated inputs (and, by extension, the original input streams if the mapping is clear) were considered most important for each specific output task.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>This architecture allows the model to dynamically learn to prioritize different aspects of the combined inputs for each of its output tasks. \"Interceptability\" comes from the ability to inspect the <code>alpha_j</code> vectors, which provide a proxy for the importance of input features for each output.</p>\n\n<p><strong>4.

For each output stream, two sequential <code>Dense</code> layers (one with <code>tanh</code> and another with <code>softmax</code> over the concatenated input dimension) are created to calculate attention weights, and one <code>Dense</code> layer to process the weighted input and generate the stream's output.</li>\n<li>  <strong><code>call</code></strong>:\n\n<ol>\n<li> Inputs are concatenated (if multiple).</li>\n<li> For each output stream <code>i</code>:\n\n<ul>\n<li>  Attention weights (<code>attention_weights</code>) are calculated using the corresponding <code>Dense</code> sublayers, applying <code>softmax</code> so weights sum to 1 (or behave like importance probabilities) over the features of the concatenated input.</li>\n<li>  The concatenated input is weighted by element-wise multiplication with <code>attention_weights</code>.</li>\n<li>  The weighted input (<code>attended_inputs</code>) is passed through the output processing layer to generate <code>stream_output</code>.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n</li>\n\n<li> Calculated attention weights (<code>current_attention_weights</code>) are stored in the instance variable <code>self.learned_attention_weights</code> for inspection (mainly useful for the last processed batch).</li>\n\n<li> Returns a list of output tensors.</li>\n\n</ol>\n\n</li>\n\n<li>  <strong><code>get_config</code> / <code>from_config</code></strong>: Allow the layer to be serialized and deserialized by Keras.</li>\n\n<li>  <strong>Usage Example</strong>: Demonstrates how to instantiate the MAIL layer in a Keras model with two inputs and three outputs, compile it, and train it with dummy data. It also outlines how attention weights could be extracted, highlighting that the most robust way is to build a model that explicitly returns these weights as part of its outputs.</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>5. Experiments and Results (Conceptual)</strong></p>\n\n<p>To validate the MAIL layer, a set of hypothetical experiments would be conducted:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>  <strong>Dataset:</strong> A synthetic or real dataset with multiple heterogeneous inputs (e.g., tabular data, time series, text embeddings) and multiple output tasks (e.g., one regression and two classifications). For example, in an industrial predictive maintenance scenario:\n\n<ul>\n<li>  <strong>Inputs:</strong> Sensor data (vibration, temperature, pressure), maintenance logs (text processed into embeddings), machine specifications (tabular).</li>\n<li>  <strong>Outputs:</strong> Risk of failure (regression), probable failure type (classification), remaining useful life (regression).</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n</li>\n\n<li>  <strong>Baseline Model:</strong> A standard MIMO-DL architecture without the MAIL layer (e.g., simple concatenation of processed inputs followed by branches for each output).</li>\n\n<li>  <strong>Model with MAIL:</strong> The same baseline architecture but with the MAIL layer inserted before the output branches.</li>\n\n<li>  <strong>Metrics:</strong>\n\n<ul>\n<li>  <strong>Task Performance:</strong> Appropriate metrics for each output task (e.g., MSE for regression, Accuracy/F1-score for classification).</li>\n<li>  <strong>Interpretability:</strong> Qualitative analysis of attention weights (<code>alpha_j</code>). Visualizations of the weights can show which input features (or which original input streams, if the mapping is clear after concatenation) receive the most attention for each output task. For example, it is expected that to predict \"failure type,\" \"maintenance logs\" might receive higher attention, while for \"risk of failure,\" \"sensor data\" would be more heavily weighted.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n</li>\n\n<li>  <strong>Expected Results:</strong>\n\n<ul>\n<li>  The model with MAIL should achieve comparable or slightly superior performance to the baseline model, due to attention's ability to focus on relevant features.</li>\n<li>  Analysis of attention weights should provide insights into the input-output relationships learned by the model, ideally aligning with domain knowledge or revealing new interactions. For example, if input <code>X_1</code> is consistently weighted more heavily for output <code>Y_1</code> than for <code>Y_2</code>, this provides interpretable evidence of information flow specialization.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>6. Discussion</strong></p>\n\n<p>The proposed MAIL layer offers a mechanism to dissect the complex interactions within MIMO-DL models. By forcing the model to learn explicit attention weights for each output pathway, we gain a window into its internal workings. \"Intercepting\" these weights allows researchers and practitioners to:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>  <strong>Validate model behavior:</strong> Verify if the model is focusing on relevant features as expected by domain knowledge.</li>\n<li>  <strong>Discover new relationships:</strong> Identify unexpected interactions between inputs and outputs that could lead to new hypotheses.</li>\n<li>  <strong>Debug the model:</strong> If a specific output is underperforming, analyzing attention weights might indicate whether the model is failing to attend to the correct inputs.</li>\n<li>  <strong>Improve model architecture:</strong> Insights about feature importance can guide feature engineering or the design of more efficient architectures.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Limitations:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>  Interpretability provided by attention weights is not a definitive causal explanation but rather a correlation learned by the model.</li>\n<li>  If inputs are extensively pre-processed and transformed before the MAIL layer, mapping attention weights back to original features can be complex.</li>\n<li>  The complexity of the MAIL layer itself increases with the number of input/output streams and data dimensionality.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Future Work:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>  Explore more sophisticated attention mechanisms within the MAIL layer (e.g., location-based attention, hierarchical self-attention between input streams).</li>\n<li>  Develop more advanced visualization methods for attention weights in MIMO contexts.</li>\n<li>  Apply MAIL to real-world problems in domains like healthcare, finance, and autonomous systems to evaluate its practical utility.</li>\n<li>  Integrate the MAIL layer with other XAI techniques to obtain richer and more robust explanations.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>7. Conclusion</strong></p>\n\n<p>The MAIL (Multi-layer Attentional Interception Layer) is a novel approach for embedding interpretability into deep neural networks with multiple inputs and multiple outputs. By explicitly learning the relevance of inputs to specific outputs through dedicated attention heads, MAIL allows for the \"interception\" and analysis of these relationships. The provided Python implementation demonstrates the feasibility of integrating such a layer into existing deep learning workflows. We believe MAIL represents a step towards more transparent and understandable MIMO-DL models, facilitating their adoption in critical applications.</p>\n\n<p><strong>8.

key: fruit\napple\nDeleting item for key: fruit\n</code></pre>\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>Now your custom object now supports square bracket operations.</p>\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  Deep Dive into Each Method\n</h2>\n\n<h3>\n  \n  \n  1. <code>__getitem__(self, key)</code>\n</h3>\n\n<p>This method is triggered when you access an item like <code>obj[key]</code>. The syntax is like below:<br>\n</p>\n\n<div class=\"highlight js-code-highlight\">\n<pre class=\"highlight python\"><code><span class=\"k\">def</span> <span class=\"nf\">__getitem__</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">self</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"n\">key</span><span class=\"p\">):</span>\n    <span class=\"k\">return</span> <span class=\"n\">self</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"n\">_data</span><span class=\"p\">[</span><span class=\"n\">key</span><span class=\"p\">]</span>\n</code></pre>\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>You can also support slicing, like <code>obj[1:4]</code>, by checking if the <code>key</code> is a <code>slice</code> object.</li>\n<li>Great for building lists, matrices, caches, etc.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Let’s look at a little example.<br>\n</p>\n\n<div class=\"highlight js-code-highlight\">\n<pre class=\"highlight python\"><code><span class=\"k\">class</span> <span class=\"nc\">MyList</span><span class=\"p\">:</span>\n    <span class=\"k\">def</span> <span class=\"nf\">__init__</span><span

Python how to handle it.</p>\n\n<p>If you want to support slicing too, you can implement it like that:<br>\n</p>\n\n<div class=\"highlight js-code-highlight\">\n<pre class=\"highlight

Imagine you're building a configuration system for your application, something that holds settings like <code>\"DEBUG\"</code>, <code>\"TIMEOUT\"</code>, or <code>\"HOST\"</code>. You want to make sure only specific keys are allowed, that values are the right type like <code>str</code> or <code>bool</code>, and that small mistakes like capitalization errors or invalid types don’t silently break your app.</p>\n\n<p>This is where container protocol methods come in handy.</p>\n\n<p>In the example below, we’ll build a custom class called <code>StrictConfigStore</code>. It behaves like a dictionary but with extra powers: it validates keys, enforces value types, treats keys case-insensitively, and even logs every time you get, set, or delete a value. This is the kind of tool you'd use in real projects where reliability and safety matter.</p>\n\n<p>Let’s dive in!<br>\n</p>\n\n<div class=\"highlight js-code-highlight\">\n<pre class=\"highlight

She is part of the Code of Conduct Working Group and she is a Django Girls organizer in Australia. She has been a DSF member since July 2014. \nYou can learn more about Elena by visiting <a href=\"https://elena.github.io/\">Elena's website</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/elena/\">her GitHub Profile</a>.</p><p>Let’s spend some time getting to know Elena better!</p><h4>Can you tell us a little about yourself (hobbies, education, etc)</h4><p>My background is that I was always interested in computers, though my parents were more creative types, my Dad was an Architect (of built structures). When I was a kid we had computers for CAD around the house before it was common. I was always into STEM subjects, but unfortunately in that era for girls to do engineering it was a bit too hostile for me, so I trained in finance instead and worked in that industry (finance and banking, MNE orgs) for nearly a decade. I kept coming back to coding and was always building computers, and was obsessed with the internet as a technology from pretty early on. Just after I discovered Django I did a Masters in Computing at ANU. To this day my main hobbies are programming/webdev (very much a person who codes for fun) and the open source community. My persistent other hobbies are hackspace activities, I like CNC and laser stuff, but will pick up any and all tools/mediums and give them a go, lately been spending time with blender and cabinetry. When I can, I like to get away to snowboard or kitesurf, and this wild Australian long distance endurance navigation sport called rogaining. Really at the moment I’m mostly focussed on being a parent (which is an awesome experience), my friends (mostly python related), my job and working on the community here in Australia. With my family we go camping/hiking more than most. I’ve also continued to be a sessional academic at ANU teaching software engineering for many years. </p><h4>How did you start using Django?</h4><p>Golly, I’ve been using Django forever. I’d started doing web stuff in the early ‘00s and worked in a range of languages and paradigms. I was working in a physics research institute at a high profile university in Australia doing web stuff and made friends with a bunch of the doctoral students. In around 2007, one of these students, and my good mate, Dave, randomly recommended this new framework Django and Python (and emacs also actually but that’s a different story). Basically I got into it immediately and never looked back and went on to build a career around Django (actually Dave later gave up physics and did the same thing too). I’ve been engaged with the Python and Django communities to varying degrees since about 2011 as well. To be honest when I discovered the language and the framework I really didn’t expect to still be passionate about them all these years later but I really am! Hopefully I can continue to be well into the future also.</p><h4>What other framework do you know and if there is anything you would like to have in Django if you had magical powers?</h4><p>Over the years (being a curious person) I’ve worked with many many web frameworks and technologies, the vast majority of the big ones. In recent years I’ve been spending time with FastAPI and SQLAlchemy as well as non-python technologies. Django is better though.</p><p>Not using Django as much at the moment makes me love it even more and realise how lucky we are with such a well designed and well supported framework. It’s not perfect but it’s outstanding. </p><p>Having said that: at a technical level I’d love to have “cheaper” ways (in every sense) to deploy. Even though deployment methods have changed beyond recognition several times over the years, I always thought this would get easier over time and am kind of surprised that it hasn’t.</p><p>Very specific to me is that I need Django to have stronger support for many database schemas in the same project, but honestly this is just a specific problem I have inherited in a project at the moment, but it’ll pass eventually.</p><h4>What projects are you working on now?</h4><p>Over the last few years I’ve helped organise a number of events, including PyConAU, though realised I’d been taking on too many projects and trying to pull back actually! Still: Internationally I’m on DSF CoC with a great team. Nationally this year I’ve been serving on the committee of our main Australian open source foundation body, Linux Australia, as well as working in a small team trying to bring together all of the Australian python user groups under a banner we hope to call Python Australia and I’ve had a keen interest in python user groups around the world. In my home town I’ve been organising our local user groups for some time with an awesome team, as well as our fantastic local PyLadies.</p><p>For work I’m flat-chat working in a senior role on a Platform team in a small data company that provides “critical digital infrastructure” for Australia. Though my most important project of all at the moment really is my family, and I do really prioritise my friends and being healthy nowadays. I’m an avid hackerspace person and do have a couple of purportedly active projects (I’m obsessed with maps among other things) but these are relatively neglected at the moment as I just don’t have the bandwidth.</p><h4>Which Django libraries are your favorite (core or 3rd party)?</h4><p>I just love the ORM. We’re so spoiled in the Django community we don’t realise how mature and feature-rich the ORM is. Maybe I’m biased because I’ve been using it for so long I just “think” in Django ORM and I’ve been working away from it lately. It’s such a (comparative) pleasure to use. You can nit-pick at it but compared to anything else it’s so beautifully thought through.</p><p>The admin was the Django “killer app” in 2008 and I’d argue still is in 2025. To be some dozens of seconds away from a custom CMS backend at any time is still magical. Pony magical. It’s still as impressive as ever to show off to people. Also in the same way that Guido says python makes a great calculator: Django makes a great quick tool for really fast data munging, can’t describe how liberating it feels using it for this purpose.</p><p>Writing tests in Django is under-rated too.</p><p>There are so many amazing 3rd party libraries, too many to mention. For shout-outs I don’t think I have any projects without Debug Toolbar. The 3rd party caching libraries Memcache and Redis are both great. I’m also usually happy when I turn on Celery, and excited to see DEP-0014 on its way. Danny and Audrey’s Django Cookiecutter project is a great reference even if you don’t take the whole enchilada.</p><h4>What are the top three things in Django that you like?</h4><p>I’ve been lucky to generally have had a pretty great time with Django. Generally I’ve used it for projects where it was a really good fit and so it wasn’t painful. As such I like weird little quirky things about Django. Haters-can-hate but I actually really like a bunch of this controversial stuff, for example I like settings.py as a pattern for projects that aren’t out of control; I enjoy using and customising the management commands framework; I think Meta class as an approach to that type of awkward problem is neat; I’ve generally had a pretty nice time with the template language; I dig into utils and reuse them probably more often than most; ORM and the Tests obviously (it’s trivial to plugin pytest of course). Everything is a trade-off in software engineering and while I’m very biased: I just like the trade-offs that Django has chosen, they’re some of the best-in-class.</p><p>The top 3 things though? This is tough. I just like it. To nail down actual answers though: </p><ul><li>the framework workflow overall;</li><li>that the project has stayed so consistently high quality and battle-hardened for so many years; </li><li>and the community and my friends (shout out sp-wg)</li></ul><h4>I know you have start Django with one of the first version, what do you think of the evolution of the framework?</h4><p>This is a great question! Thanks for being interested in this history, the Django history is a nice story of having good values and persisting and this actually being successful over the long run. </p><p>For me there’s all the “back in my day” stuff that’s not obvious now, like Python not being taken seriously as a “real” programming language, let alone javascript, but now those tides have very much turned, and web development is considered extremely respectable and high profile, which was unimaginable when I started. Django started in Web1.0 (whatever that meant), and actually grew substantially during Web2.0 and now even in the modern Web3 era is kind of establishing itself into being part of the backbone of the large parts of the internet that aren’t obvious. Thibaud has a list he maintains of websites that he believes use Django, this is great if you haven’t seen it.</p><p>One of the most impressive parts of the evolution has been how decisions have been made and implemented. In normal “work” you just have to make things as fast as possible and endlessly add features consequences-be-damned. Open source gets to be fundamentally the opposite. Traditionally one of the defining characteristics of Open Source is that “time is no object”. That is good design and implementation can be allowed the time to breathe and be excessively thought through. There is no rush or deadline. While there’s always conflict and drama I think there has been less so in Django than in most other projects as design decisions have been painstakingly threshed out and perfected in mailing lists, tickets, DEPs and forums over the months and years it takes to make them. The people inside see the drama but we’re in the news almost never compared to most projects in the same space. The point is that hypothetically it’s possible to try to make the best possible design decisions. In practice most projects don’t do this, but I think Django has demonstrated exemplary maturity in trying to pursue this ideal, and is regularly recognised for it. </p><p>The original founding team deserve full credit for instilling this culture and each successive group of stewards deserve credit for preserving it. </p><p>There have (and always will be) missteps. For example CBVs are such an obviously good idea on paper, but in practice people don’t think so. On the other hand Andrew Godwin’s implementation of migrations back in the day, that was completely re-writing South from scratch, was truly lovely, even though it was a battle to get to the point of having migrations at all. There’s the history around the db module, which pretty much everyone was too scared to touch after Malcolm died until there were some impressive breakthroughs in it during the “under the hood” sessions not long after DjangoGirls people started coming on board.</p><p>Django consciously has decided to be extremely considered in its adoption of change and this has been a great thing. Other frameworks have generally been more cavalier, while Django has been steady, careful and reliable. The other full-feature frameworks are kind of in decline, or have hurt themselves by too-much-change-too-fast, while Django has steadily slowly grown and is the trusty go-to tool for a certain kind of job.</p><p>Now moving forward I see focus on the very subtle things that make the framework nicer to use and understand, On just making the core capabilities better and more reliable and performant, and only very very carefully adding features. </p><p>In an age where so much quality degradation is occurring, it inspires hope that projects like Django can persist as beacons of high quality, held together by a small group and big community of thoughtful, caring individuals. Hopefully this is something we can continue for a long time into the future also!</p><h4>You are part of the Code of Conduct working group, how is it to work with the working group? Do you have space available for new members? What does it require according to you?</h4><p>Code of Conduct WGs are slightly niche and exposed to a certain kind of work and responsibility. Not to mention that respecting many sensitives and view-points is necessary. It also means having the guts to tell people “that’s not how it’s done here” when it needs to be said. Personally it’s a kind of work I’ve grown to be passionate about. I truly believe having a great culture is at the core of community (and really anything good) and can be a complex balancing act of competing factors and emotions. It’s certainly not the kind of thing everyone is into, but if you are, the WG is looking for more diversity, if nothing else it’s tending slightly older at the moment.</p><p>Having said that: Within all of the open source communities from local to international levels there’s always space for people who are willing to turn up and help!</p><p>Join your local community! Find the parts of community that “speak” to you. Maybe it’s starting a meetup, helping your local conference, running a DjangoGirls. Maybe it’s something engineer-related like finally adding something to an open source library that you’re into, adding some beginner docs somewhere, or engaging with Djangonaut Space. Maybe it’s something online like helping out in forum.djangoproject.com, Reddit or Discord.</p><p>As organisers we have this cheat code for finding new people to invite to help more, it’s called “looking for chair-stackers”, that is people who engage to help in the little ways, such as helping stack chairs at the end of an event or generally pack down, wipe up, carry boxes or put things away. Or online: people who go out of their way to try to understand and chip in to manage extra rules, or answer the unanswered thing that’s been sitting there for a while. Or people who just ask “can I help out with that?” when the organisers seem tired or stressed out. Having people around who help in these ways has huge value and has been the beginning of many people being involved in communities and making life-long friends and connections.</p><p>Now more than ever though, it’s so important to connect to your community. We are stronger, better and healthier when we are connected to and relied on by other people and we have others we can share our experiences with. </p><p>Particularly us computer people tend not to be as good with connecting with other people, but everyone should find their way to get out and connect! It’s sometimes hard but it’s always better.</p><h4>You have organized many DjangoGirls in Australia, how did you start? Do you have any advice for someone who would like to organize a DjangoGirls event?</h4><p>In 2014 I was living in Perth, Australia, where Russell Keith Magee is based and we had a budding Python/Django User Group. At one of the meetings news emerged about how Ola and Ola were running this thing called “DjangoGirls” at EuroPython in a few weeks. PyConAU was scheduled a couple of weeks after this. I was like, that’s a great idea, I can absolutely have a go at doing that and emailed them immediately asking if I could copy their materials and plan. We pulled it together with an amazing bunch of people and I think this was technically the 2nd DjangoGirls event ever. In the following years I’ve been involved in many more, including the first North American DjangoGirls. From our Perth series of events a successful organisation was spun off called SheCodes.</p><p>In the more-than-a-decade since then the world has changed so much! Particularly in the tech world. I would say specifically for DjangoGirls events, they are very region specific. My first advice for organising an event in your region is to see if there’s been one previously and reach out to the event organisers, or at least the nearest organisers – I think these days there are few places on earth that haven’t had a DjangoGirls event nearish-by. The resources on the website are actually great for getting going and the international DjangoGirls team are lovely, but also always looking for more help.</p><p>Where I live now, back in the capital, Canberra, we are very well supported for education services. We held a DjangoGirls event a couple of years ago, but for the attendees what emerged was that what we really wanted was just to connect with other technical women.</p><p>Now what has been very successful for us is an ongoing PyLadies/Women’s Software group who meet up regularly and talk about things that matter to our experience. We use the “lean-coffee” model and it’s been unexpectedly functional. This has been one of the best groups I’ve ever been in with a range of technical women regularly sharing our weird and statistically unusual experiences together, it feeds the soul, and is strongly recommended if you don’t participate in a group like this already.</p><h4>Is there anything else you’d like to say?</h4><p>A final shout out to the original leaders of the Django community, for me personally Russell, Jeff, Jacob, Andrew and Baptiste in particular, but everyone who has persisted over the years in just turning up over the long haul and keeping our part of the world as beautiful as can be. My friends Dave, Matt and Jonah. Thibaud is a great president right now. Rarely is there a dedicated Django person who is not absolutely delightful and I feel both proud and honoured to be part of this community. A big thank you to everyone (especially you Sarah! And all the Sarahs, Natalias, Lillys and Olas) who help to make Django what it is.</p><p><strong>Thank you for doing the interview, Elena !</strong></p>","contentLength":17504,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Jekyll auto posts from YouTube feeds","url":"https://dev.to/solvecomputerscience/jekyll-auto-posts-from-youtube-feeds-h1k","date":1750179600,"author":"Solve Computer Science","guid":159797,"unread":true,"content":"<h2>\n  \n  \n  🧩 The problem\n</h2>\n\n<p>I wanted to automate this boring and repetitive workflow: my idea is that every<br>\ntime a YouTube video is published on my channel I want to have an associated<br>\npost on my personal <a href=\"https://jekyllrb.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Jekyll</a> blog.</p>\n\n<p>Until very recently I handled all this by hand.

The description <br>\n(<code>summary</code>) was left out on purpose. The idea to implement in the future is to<br>\nget the video trascription and let a LLM (via Ollama) generate a summary.<br>\nOf course I then need to manually proofread it.

I've seen countless debugging sessions transform from week-long hunts to hour-long investigations when teams implement structured approaches. Let's explore practical methods that deliver real impact.  </p>\n\n<p>Structured logging revolutionizes how we process diagnostic data. In my API projects, replacing plain text with JSON objects cut log parsing time by 70%.

This stopped an audit finding before it became an incident.  </p>\n\n<h3>\n  \n  \n  Logging Architecture Patterns\n</h3>\n\n<p>In our Kubernetes deployments, I combine these techniques into a cohesive pipeline:<br>\n</p>\n\n<div class=\"highlight js-code-highlight\">\n<pre class=\"highlight plaintext\"><code>graph LR\nA[App Pods] --&gt;|Structured JSON| B(Fluentd DaemonSet)\nB --&gt; C[Elasticsearch Cluster]\nC --&gt; D[Kibana Dashboards]\nE[Prometheus] --&gt; F[Grafana Alerts]\nA --&gt;|Metrics| E\n</code></pre>\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>Correlation IDs link logs and metrics. Sampling controls volume. Sensitive fields never leave the pod. This architecture handled 2M RPM during last Black Friday without dropping critical data.  </p>\n\n<h3>\n  \n  \n  Performance Considerations\n</h3>\n\n<p>Logging introduces overhead. In load tests, I discovered these optimizations:  </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Use <code>logging.DEBUG</code> checks before expensive operations:\n</li>\n</ul>\n\n<div class=\"highlight js-code-highlight\">\n<pre class=\"highlight python\"><code>  <span class=\"k\">if</span> <span class=\"n\">logger</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nf\">isEnabledFor</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">logging</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"n\">DEBUG</span><span class=\"p\">):</span>\n      <span class=\"n\">logger</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nf\">debug</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"sa\">f</span><span class=\"sh\">\"</span><span class=\"s\">Order details: </span><span class=\"si\">{</span><span class=\"nf\">generate_large_report</span><span class=\"p\">()</span><span class=\"si\">}</span><span class=\"sh\">\"</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n</code></pre>\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Set <code>logging.raiseExceptions = False</code> in production to prevent logging failures from crashing apps\n</li>\n<li>Batch log writes with BufferingHandler when using network sinks\n</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Our benchmarks showed 40% lower CPU usage after implementing these.  </p>\n\n<h3>\n  \n  \n  Evolution of Practices\n</h3>\n\n<p>I've refined my logging approach over 12 years. Early mistakes taught valuable lessons:  </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Mistake</strong>: Logging entire HTTP bodies\n<strong>Solution</strong>: Sample body snippets when status &gt;= 400\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Mistake</strong>: Unique error IDs in separate systems\n<strong>Solution</strong>: Embed correlation IDs in error responses\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Mistake</strong>: Alerting on every error\n<strong>Solution</strong>: Multi-window error rate thresholds\n</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>These practices became our team's operational playbook.  </p>\n\n<h3>\n  \n  \n  Final Insights\n</h3>\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  Great logging balances detail and efficiency. Start with structured foundations, add context through correlation, and control volume via sampling. Instrument key metrics alongside logs. Most importantly – treat logging as a living system. Review your outputs quarterly. I've found teams that evolve their logging practices prevent 30% more production issues annually.

From AI startups to enterprise transformation projects, Python remains a leading choice for innovation. But hiring skilled Python talent remotely isn’t just about posting a job online. It’s about having the right playbook — one that blends technical insight, cultural fit, and long-term thinking.</p>\n\n<p>Whether you're a startup looking for your first Python hire or a scale-up seeking Python programmers for hire to expand your global team, this guide shares the proven steps we use to find, vet, and retain top-tier remote Python talent.</p>\n\n<p><strong>1. Define Roles with Precision</strong><br>\nSuccess starts with clarity. Are you looking for a backend-focused developer? A full-stack engineer with Flask or Django experience? Or perhaps a data-centric Python pro with Pandas and NumPy expertise?</p>\n\n<p>Create role definitions that go beyond “Python Developer.” Include required frameworks, libraries, and domain knowledge — whether that’s API development, machine learning, or data pipeline optimization.</p>\n\n<p><strong>2. Source from Developer-Centric Platforms</strong><br>\nGeneric job boards may attract quantity — not quality. We focus our search on developer-first ecosystems like:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>GitHub &amp; GitLab: Review contributors on open-source projects</p></li>\n<li><p>Stack Overflow Talent: For community-active developers</p></li>\n<li><p>Remote OK / We Work Remotely: High-signal platforms for remote-ready professionals</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>These platforms often reveal more than resumes — including actual code contributions, collaborative behaviors, and reputation within the Python community.</p>\n\n<p><strong>3. Use Real-World Skills Assessments (Not Whiteboard Tests)</strong><br>\nTop developers today expect evaluations that reflect real problems. Instead of algorithm puzzles or trick questions, we build short take-home projects using tools like:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>GitHub repositories for collaborative submissions</p></li>\n<li><p>Jupyter Notebooks for data-centric roles</p></li>\n<li><p>FastAPI or Flask mini-APIs to test backend logic</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>These tests simulate actual on-the-job tasks, giving both the candidate and the hiring team a realistic preview.</p>\n\n<p><strong>4. Prioritize Asynchronous Communication Skills</strong><br>\nIn a remote-first world, coding skills aren’t enough. Great remote Python developers also need strong written communication — whether it’s documenting code, updating tasks in Jira, or explaining trade-offs in Slack.</p>\n\n<p>During our process, we assess async communication by asking for written architecture explanations or pull request reviews, giving us insight into clarity, empathy, and professionalism.</p>\n\n<p><strong>5. Vet for Cultural and Time-Zone Fit</strong><br>\nHiring globally means navigating time zones, cultural norms, and work habits. We focus on:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Time-zone overlap (at least 2–4 hours with core team)</p></li>\n<li><p>Cultural alignment with company values</p></li>\n<li><p>Remote work readiness: ability to self-manage, prioritize, and collaborate digitally</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>We’ve found that the best remote hires are not just skilled — they’re autonomous and proactive, two qualities that don't always show up on resumes.</p>\n\n<p><strong>6. Leverage AI and Automation Tools</strong><br>\nIn 2025, we're using AI-enhanced hiring tools to speed up and streamline the vetting process. Platforms like Codility, HireVue, and even ChatGPT-powered bots help with:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Resume screening</p></li>\n<li><p>Code review analysis</p></li>\n<li><p>Candidate scoring based on job-requirement matches</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Automation doesn’t replace judgment — it enhances consistency and reduces human bias.</p>\n\n<p><strong>7. Focus on Python Ecosystem Experience</strong><br>\nNot all Python developers are the same. Look for candidates who are comfortable with popular libraries relevant to your domain:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Data science: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn</p></li>\n<li><p>Web development: Django, FastAPI</p></li>\n<li><p>ML/AI: PyTorch, TensorFlow</p></li>\n<li><p>Big data &amp; performance: Dask, Cython</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Developers with deep ecosystem experience bring more than code — they bring architectural insight and proven solutions.</p>\n\n<p><strong>8. Run Paid Trial Projects</strong><br>\nBefore making a full-time commitment, we often offer paid trial projects. These are:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Time-bound (1–2 weeks)</p></li>\n<li><p>Clearly scoped (e.g., “Build an internal API or dashboard”)</p></li>\n<li><p>Collaborative (working with our current team)</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>This not only helps validate skills but also gauges collaboration, commitment, and long-term fit.</p>\n\n<p><strong>9. Set Up an Excellent Onboarding Process</strong><br>\nRemote onboarding can make or break a hire. Our process includes:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Clear documentation (internal wikis, codebase walkthroughs)</p></li>\n<li><p>Assigned mentors or onboarding buddies</p></li>\n<li><p>Scheduled check-ins for feedback and goal alignment</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>A strong start ensures that even highly skilled developers become productive faster — and feel like a real part of the team.</p>\n\n<p><strong>10. Retain with Culture, Not Just Compensation</strong><br>\nAttracting talent is only half the game — retention matters more. Our strategies include:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Monthly learning budgets for courses and certifications</p></li>\n<li><p>Async town halls and team-building activities</p></li>\n<li><p>Public recognition for contributions (on GitHub, Slack, or all-hands)</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Happy, motivated developers are far more likely to stick around and grow with your company.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Conclusion: Remote Python Hiring Done Right</strong></p>\n\n<p>In today’s landscape, hiring remote Python developers isn’t a stopgap — it’s a strategic advantage. When done right, remote hiring delivers access to global talent, faster product cycles, and sustainable growth.</p>\n\n<p>Our proven playbook — refined across dozens of hires and multiple industries — helps us consistently match companies with the right Python programmers for hire, at the right time.</p>\n\n<p>If you’re scaling your team and want expert help sourcing and onboarding top-tier remote Python talent, we’d love to support your journey.</p>\n\n","contentLength":0,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Adrarsh Divakaran: Will AI Replace Junior Developers?

Isn't it? I know the struggle.</p>\n\n<p><em>That’s a tough combo.</em></p>\n\n<p>But here’s the good news: AI isn’t just hype anymore, it’s quietly transforming how we build and maintain software. I’ve seen it firsthand. With the right tools, you can automate the boring stuff, catch bugs before they bite, and even tighten up your code reviews without burning out your team.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fs9pmiqutxbh4clu7nrlr.gif\" class=\"article-body-image-wrapper\"><img src=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fs9pmiqutxbh4clu7nrlr.gif\" alt=\"Python code\" width=\"480\" height=\"270\"></a></p>\n\n<p>In this article, I’ll walk you through six powerful ways AI can instantly boost your Python code quality. From <a href=\"https://dub.sh/PyTyY3V\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">AI-powered review agents</a> to smarter test generation, these techniques are already helping top teams ship cleaner, more reliable code &amp; faster.</p>\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  1. Automated AI-Powered Code Reviews\n</h2>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fifnv4dr3pfy33hcdcp9l.gif\" class=\"article-body-image-wrapper\"><img src=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fifnv4dr3pfy33hcdcp9l.gif\" alt=\"ai review\" width=\"480\" height=\"238\"></a></p>\n\n<p>Manual code reviews can be slow, inconsistent, and easy to overlook minor errors, especially at enterprise scale. AI changes this by automating large parts of the review process. For example, intelligent code review agents can scan an entire pull request in seconds and flag issues like style deviations, potential bugs, or missing error checks. I personally use Entelligence AI’s PR Review agent and recommend trying it out if you want more consistent improvements. Tools like <a href=\"https://dub.sh/PyTyY3V\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Entelligence AI</a>  run inside your development workflow (VS Code) to give real-time feedback on Python code, making reviews faster and more thorough. Studies of AI code review show that these systems complete reviews “in a fraction of the time,” analyzing vast amounts of code quickly and making actionable recommendations.</p>\n\n<p>Critically, AI-driven reviews are also much more consistent than purely human ones. An AI agent never gets tired or distracted, so it applies the same coding rules uniformly across every file. This means common errors (like missing null checks or inconsistent naming) get flagged reliably. Many enterprise tools use machine learning to automatically identify defects, security vulnerabilities, and performance issues in Python and other languages. By integrating such AI code review services into your <a href=\"https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/ci-cd-pipeline\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">CI/CD pipeline</a>, every pull request can be scanned for problems before it’s merged. In short, automated AI reviews speed up the feedback loop and help enforce team coding standards, leading to cleaner Python code with less manual effort.</p>\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  2. Advanced Static Analysis and Bug Detection\n</h2>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Flk73oqcycmhstna2obrp.gif\" class=\"article-body-image-wrapper\"><img src=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Flk73oqcycmhstna2obrp.gif\" alt=\"bug detection\" width=\"480\" height=\"356\"></a></p>\n\n<p>Beyond high-level reviews, AI excels at deep static analysis of code. Modern AI analysis tools use machine learning to detect subtle bugs and security flaws that traditional linters or human reviewers might miss. For example, an AI model can trace through complex code paths and identify edge-case errors or race conditions. A research firm analysed that AI-based code review notes that these tools are “highly effective at detecting errors that are difficult to spot through manual review”. In practice, integrating AI-based scanners into your workflow means every commit is checked for hard-to-find issues. These tools have been trained on millions of code examples, so they catch patterns of bugs (like SQL injection risks or memory leaks) even in unfamiliar code.</p>\n\n<p>Enterprise surveys confirm this benefit: developers report that AI tools help them deliver more secure software with higher quality. For instance, the <a href=\"https://github.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">GitHub</a>/<a href=\"https://www.accenture.com/us-en\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Accenture</a> research found 90% of developers saw an improvement in code security and quality when using AI-assisted coding tools. In practice, you might configure an AI scanner to run on every pull request, ensuring that even minor security or reliability issues (say, unchecked exceptions or unused variables) are caught immediately. By detecting these bugs early and automatically, AI-driven static analysis significantly reduces the risk of defects slipping into production, making your Python applications more robust.</p>\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  3. AI-Generated Testing and Coverage\n</h2>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2F6biwo6ron3dsx3ny6fg2.gif\" class=\"article-body-image-wrapper\"><img src=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2F6biwo6ron3dsx3ny6fg2.gif\" alt=\"testing\" width=\"480\" height=\"430\"></a></p>\n\n<p>Writing comprehensive unit and integration tests is one of the best ways to ensure code quality – but it’s also labor-intensive. AI can help automate this tedious task. New AI assistants (like <a href=\"https://github.com/features/copilot\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">GitHub Copilot</a>) can analyze <a href=\"https://www.python.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Python</a> functions and automatically generate meaningful test cases. As one developer puts it, “progress in AI has opened doors to automated test generation…presenting developers with an innovative method for creating code tests.”. With these tools, you can often click a button or prompt the AI with a function, and it will produce a suite of unit tests covering normal and edge-case inputs. The generated tests can be easily reviewed and tweaked, saving developers hours of manual writing.</p>\n\n<p>The benefits are clear: automated test generation improves coverage and catches bugs early. In fact, respondents in a GitHub survey specifically noted “improved test case generation” as a key advantage of AI coding tools. By letting AI propose tests, teams find and fix hidden logic errors and regressions much sooner. Crucially for enterprises, AI test tools integrate into IDEs and pipelines, so you can automatically generate or update tests as part of development. The result is higher confidence in your code – every new Python module gets thoroughly tested by AI, ensuring defects are caught before they reach production.</p>\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  4. AI-Driven Documentation and Code Consistency\n</h2>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fo4tgni2qum081dvgmz0f.gif\" class=\"article-body-image-wrapper\"><img src=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fo4tgni2qum081dvgmz0f.gif\" alt=\"documentation\" width=\"480\" height=\"362\"></a></p>\n\n<p>Clean, maintainable code needs good documentation, and AI is starting to automate that too. LLMs like GPT-4 can analyze a Python function’s code and generate explanatory docstrings or comments in natural language. These models work by understanding the function’s logic and translating it into readable descriptions. This means trivial documentation tasks – like writing the “Args/Returns” in a docstring – can be done in seconds by AI rather than minutes by hand. The payoff is huge: better documentation makes the codebase easier to understand and reduces bugs caused by misusing a function.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://dub.sh/PyTyY3V\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">AI documentation tools</a> also enforce consistency across the codebase. They apply the same style and naming conventions everywhere, so all docstrings or comments follow unified templates. For example, if your team has a standard format for function descriptions, an AI tool will stick to that format in every file. This uniform approach saves hours of manual editing and makes the code easier to skim and review. Entelligence AI notes that AI generation yields “documentation that would take hours to write manually…in seconds,” and ensures consistent standards across the project. By integrating an AI doc generator into reviews or CI, you can auto-generate or validate docs on each commit. In short, AI-powered commenting and docstring generation keep your Python code self-explanatory and maintainable at enterprise scale.</p>\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  5. AI-Powered Developer Assistants and Autocompletion\n</h2>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fbaihjwz7kzf4kd8p0uyj.gif\" class=\"article-body-image-wrapper\"><img src=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fbaihjwz7kzf4kd8p0uyj.gif\" alt=\"AI ASSISTANCE\" width=\"480\" height=\"480\"></a></p>\n\n<p>AI isn’t just for post-checks; it can help you write better code from the get-go. Intelligent coding assistants such as GitHub Copilot, Entelligence ai,<a href=\"https://www.tabnine.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Tabnine</a>, or <a href=\"https://windsurf.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Windsurf</a> run inside your IDE and suggest code snippets or completions as you type. For example, as you start writing a function, Copilot might auto-complete it with the correct loop or library call. This on-the-fly advice often leads to more idiomatic, error-free code. Aimultiple describes Copilot as “an AI-powered code completion tool that assists developers by suggesting code snippets and entire functions as they type”. By catching simple mistakes (like syntax errors or wrong API usage) instantly, these tools reduce the number of bugs in the code you write.</p>\n\n<p>More importantly, AI pair programmers accelerate development and boost confidence. In an enterprise study with Accenture, developers using Copilots coded up to 55% faster and 85% reported feeling more confident in their code quality. In practical terms, this means teams spend less time on mundane coding tasks and more time on design and complex problems. As these AI assistants learn from millions of open-source examples, they also inject best practices automatically. For instance, suggesting secure coding patterns or efficient data structures. The bottom line is that using an AI coding assistant during development helps enforce quality by preventing issues early and speeding up coding, leading to cleaner Python code right from the first draft.</p>\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  6. AI-Powered Code Refactoring and Maintenance\n</h2>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Ft9nxiums1xlrrukqkohs.gif\" class=\"article-body-image-wrapper\"><img src=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Ft9nxiums1xlrrukqkohs.gif\" alt=\"Code\" width=\"480\" height=\"270\"></a></p>\n\n<p>Large enterprise codebases accumulate technical debt over time. Refactoring (cleaning up and reorganizing code) is essential but time-consuming. Here too, AI can help. Advanced “AI coding agents” can analyze your Python code and recommend systematic refactors. For example, they might detect that certain code blocks are duplicated or too complex, and suggest a function to encapsulate that logic. Zencoder’s guide on refactoring notes that AI agents can “analyze vast amounts of code in the blink of an eye” and “quickly identify areas ripe for improvement, saving developers countless hours of manual review.”. This efficiency boost means you can safely refactor large sections of code under AI guidance, freeing engineers to focus on high-level design rather than tedious cleanup.</p>\n\n<p>AI refactoring tools also ensure consistency and accuracy during large-scale changes. Because the AI applies the same transformation rules everywhere, your code’s style and structure become more uniform. For instance, if your team decides on a new class naming convention or wants to replace a deprecated API, an AI agent can update it across the entire codebase without missing spots. Importantly, these tools track code dependencies, so they avoid introducing new bugs. As Zencoder explains, “AI agents are less prone to errors…they can meticulously analyze code dependencies and potential impacts, reducing the risk of introducing bugs during the refactoring process.”. By periodically running AI-driven refactoring passes, enterprise teams can keep their Python code clean, well-structured, and up-to-date with modern standards.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fu96yvlvih5kjubexvsv6.gif\" class=\"article-body-image-wrapper\"><img src=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fu96yvlvih5kjubexvsv6.gif\" alt=\"pheww\" width=\"500\" height=\"303\"></a></p>\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  Conclusion\n</h2>\n\n<p>AI is no longer just a nice-to-have it’s quickly becoming a must-have for any team serious about writing high-quality Python code at scale.

I’ve seen it firsthand. With the right tools, you can automate the boring stuff, catch bugs before they bite, and even tighten up your code reviews without burning out your team.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fs9pmiqutxbh4clu7nrlr.gif\" class=\"article-body-image-wrapper\"><img src=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fs9pmiqutxbh4clu7nrlr.gif\" alt=\"Python code\" width=\"480\" height=\"270\"></a></p>\n\n<p>In this article, I’ll walk you through six powerful ways AI can instantly boost your Python code quality. From <a href=\"https://dub.sh/PyTyY3V\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">AI-powered review agents</a> to smarter test generation, these techniques are already helping top teams ship cleaner, more reliable code &amp; faster.</p>\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  1. Automated AI-Powered Code Reviews\n</h2>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fifnv4dr3pfy33hcdcp9l.gif\" class=\"article-body-image-wrapper\"><img src=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fifnv4dr3pfy33hcdcp9l.gif\" alt=\"ai review\" width=\"480\" height=\"238\"></a></p>\n\n<p>Manual code reviews can be slow, inconsistent, and easy to overlook minor errors, especially at enterprise scale. AI changes this by automating large parts of the review process. For example, intelligent code review agents can scan an entire pull request in seconds and flag issues like style deviations, potential bugs, or missing error checks. I personally use Entelligence AI’s PR Review agent and recommend trying it out if you want more consistent improvements. Tools like <a href=\"https://dub.sh/PyTyY3V\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Entelligence AI</a>  run inside your development workflow (VS Code) to give real-time feedback on Python code, making reviews faster and more thorough. Studies of AI code review show that these systems complete reviews “in a fraction of the time,” analyzing vast amounts of code quickly and making actionable recommendations.</p>\n\n<p>Critically, AI-driven reviews are also much more consistent than purely human ones. An AI agent never gets tired or distracted, so it applies the same coding rules uniformly across every file. This means common errors (like missing null checks or inconsistent naming) get flagged reliably. Many enterprise tools use machine learning to automatically identify defects, security vulnerabilities, and performance issues in Python and other languages. By integrating such AI code review services into your <a href=\"https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/ci-cd-pipeline\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">CI/CD pipeline</a>, every pull request can be scanned for problems before it’s merged. In short, automated AI reviews speed up the feedback loop and help enforce team coding standards, leading to cleaner Python code with less manual effort.</p>\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  2. Advanced Static Analysis and Bug Detection\n</h2>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Flk73oqcycmhstna2obrp.gif\" class=\"article-body-image-wrapper\"><img src=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Flk73oqcycmhstna2obrp.gif\" alt=\"bug detection\" width=\"480\" height=\"356\"></a></p>\n\n<p>Beyond high-level reviews, AI excels at deep static analysis of code. Modern AI analysis tools use machine learning to detect subtle bugs and security flaws that traditional linters or human reviewers might miss. For example, an AI model can trace through complex code paths and identify edge-case errors or race conditions. A research firm analysed that AI-based code review notes that these tools are “highly effective at detecting errors that are difficult to spot through manual review”. In practice, integrating AI-based scanners into your workflow means every commit is checked for hard-to-find issues. These tools have been trained on millions of code examples, so they catch patterns of bugs (like SQL injection risks or memory leaks) even in unfamiliar code.</p>\n\n<p>Enterprise surveys confirm this benefit: developers report that AI tools help them deliver more secure software with higher quality. For instance, the <a href=\"https://github.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">GitHub</a>/<a href=\"https://www.accenture.com/us-en\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Accenture</a> research found 90% of developers saw an improvement in code security and quality when using AI-assisted coding tools. In practice, you might configure an AI scanner to run on every pull request, ensuring that even minor security or reliability issues (say, unchecked exceptions or unused variables) are caught immediately. By detecting these bugs early and automatically, AI-driven static analysis significantly reduces the risk of defects slipping into production, making your Python applications more robust.</p>\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  3. AI-Generated Testing and Coverage\n</h2>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2F6biwo6ron3dsx3ny6fg2.gif\" class=\"article-body-image-wrapper\"><img src=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2F6biwo6ron3dsx3ny6fg2.gif\" alt=\"testing\" width=\"480\" height=\"430\"></a></p>\n\n<p>Writing comprehensive unit and integration tests is one of the best ways to ensure code quality – but it’s also labor-intensive. AI can help automate this tedious task. New AI assistants (like <a href=\"https://github.com/features/copilot\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">GitHub Copilot</a>) can analyze <a href=\"https://www.python.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Python</a> functions and automatically generate meaningful test cases. As one developer puts it, “progress in AI has opened doors to automated test generation…presenting developers with an innovative method for creating code tests.”. With these tools, you can often click a button or prompt the AI with a function, and it will produce a suite of unit tests covering normal and edge-case inputs. The generated tests can be easily reviewed and tweaked, saving developers hours of manual writing.</p>\n\n<p>The benefits are clear: automated test generation improves coverage and catches bugs early. In fact, respondents in a GitHub survey specifically noted “improved test case generation” as a key advantage of AI coding tools. By letting AI propose tests, teams find and fix hidden logic errors and regressions much sooner. Crucially for enterprises, AI test tools integrate into IDEs and pipelines, so you can automatically generate or update tests as part of development. The result is higher confidence in your code – every new Python module gets thoroughly tested by AI, ensuring defects are caught before they reach production.</p>\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  4. AI-Driven Documentation and Code Consistency\n</h2>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fo4tgni2qum081dvgmz0f.gif\" class=\"article-body-image-wrapper\"><img src=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fo4tgni2qum081dvgmz0f.gif\" alt=\"documentation\" width=\"480\" height=\"362\"></a></p>\n\n<p>Clean, maintainable code needs good documentation, and AI is starting to automate that too. LLMs like GPT-4 can analyze a Python function’s code and generate explanatory docstrings or comments in natural language. These models work by understanding the function’s logic and translating it into readable descriptions. This means trivial documentation tasks – like writing the “Args/Returns” in a docstring – can be done in seconds by AI rather than minutes by hand. The payoff is huge: better documentation makes the codebase easier to understand and reduces bugs caused by misusing a function.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://dub.sh/PyTyY3V\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">AI documentation tools</a> also enforce consistency across the codebase. They apply the same style and naming conventions everywhere, so all docstrings or comments follow unified templates. For example, if your team has a standard format for function descriptions, an AI tool will stick to that format in every file. This uniform approach saves hours of manual editing and makes the code easier to skim and review. Entelligence AI notes that AI generation yields “documentation that would take hours to write manually…in seconds,” and ensures consistent standards across the project. By integrating an AI doc generator into reviews or CI, you can auto-generate or validate docs on each commit. In short, AI-powered commenting and docstring generation keep your Python code self-explanatory and maintainable at enterprise scale.</p>\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  5. AI-Powered Developer Assistants and Autocompletion\n</h2>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fbaihjwz7kzf4kd8p0uyj.gif\" class=\"article-body-image-wrapper\"><img src=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fbaihjwz7kzf4kd8p0uyj.gif\" alt=\"AI ASSISTANCE\" width=\"480\" height=\"480\"></a></p>\n\n<p>AI isn’t just for post-checks; it can help you write better code from the get-go. Intelligent coding assistants such as GitHub Copilot, Entelligence ai,<a href=\"https://www.tabnine.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Tabnine</a>, or <a href=\"https://windsurf.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Windsurf</a> run inside your IDE and suggest code snippets or completions as you type. For example, as you start writing a function, Copilot might auto-complete it with the correct loop or library call. This on-the-fly advice often leads to more idiomatic, error-free code. Aimultiple describes Copilot as “an AI-powered code completion tool that assists developers by suggesting code snippets and entire functions as they type”. By catching simple mistakes (like syntax errors or wrong API usage) instantly, these tools reduce the number of bugs in the code you write.</p>\n\n<p>More importantly, AI pair programmers accelerate development and boost confidence. In an enterprise study with Accenture, developers using Copilots coded up to 55% faster and 85% reported feeling more confident in their code quality. In practical terms, this means teams spend less time on mundane coding tasks and more time on design and complex problems. As these AI assistants learn from millions of open-source examples, they also inject best practices automatically. For instance, suggesting secure coding patterns or efficient data structures. The bottom line is that using an AI coding assistant during development helps enforce quality by preventing issues early and speeding up coding, leading to cleaner Python code right from the first draft.</p>\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  6. AI-Powered Code Refactoring and Maintenance\n</h2>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Ft9nxiums1xlrrukqkohs.gif\" class=\"article-body-image-wrapper\"><img src=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Ft9nxiums1xlrrukqkohs.gif\" alt=\"Code\" width=\"480\" height=\"270\"></a></p>\n\n<p>Large enterprise codebases accumulate technical debt over time. Refactoring (cleaning up and reorganizing code) is essential but time-consuming. Here too, AI can help. Advanced “AI coding agents” can analyze your Python code and recommend systematic refactors. For example, they might detect that certain code blocks are duplicated or too complex, and suggest a function to encapsulate that logic. Zencoder’s guide on refactoring notes that AI agents can “analyze vast amounts of code in the blink of an eye” and “quickly identify areas ripe for improvement, saving developers countless hours of manual review.”. This efficiency boost means you can safely refactor large sections of code under AI guidance, freeing engineers to focus on high-level design rather than tedious cleanup.</p>\n\n<p>AI refactoring tools also ensure consistency and accuracy during large-scale changes. Because the AI applies the same transformation rules everywhere, your code’s style and structure become more uniform. For instance, if your team decides on a new class naming convention or wants to replace a deprecated API, an AI agent can update it across the entire codebase without missing spots. Importantly, these tools track code dependencies, so they avoid introducing new bugs. As Zencoder explains, “AI agents are less prone to errors…they can meticulously analyze code dependencies and potential impacts, reducing the risk of introducing bugs during the refactoring process.”. By periodically running AI-driven refactoring passes, enterprise teams can keep their Python code clean, well-structured, and up-to-date with modern standards.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fu96yvlvih5kjubexvsv6.gif\" class=\"article-body-image-wrapper\"><img src=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fu96yvlvih5kjubexvsv6.gif\" alt=\"pheww\" width=\"500\" height=\"303\"></a></p>\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  Conclusion\n</h2>\n\n<p>AI is no longer just a nice-to-have it’s quickly becoming a must-have for any team serious about writing high-quality Python code at scale.

A language that used to dominate quietly fades. A new one rises, grabbing developer attention and company budgets. If you’re trying to figure out what’s worth learning or using in your next project, you’re not alone.</p>\n\n<p>Let’s talk about the most in-demand programming languages 2025 has to offer. These aren’t based on hype—they’re being used in real-world jobs, greenfield software development, and serious product builds. Whether you’re coding for fun, paychecks, or launching your own thing, this breakdown can help you figure out what’s worth your time.</p>\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  Python: Still the King of Versatility\n</h2>\n\n<p>Python’s grip on the developer world hasn’t loosened. Why? It’s simple to learn, quick to write, and has libraries for just about anything—data analysis, web development, automation, machine learning, and more. Companies keep using it in greenfield software development because it allows fast prototyping and smooth integrations.</p>\n\n<p>In 2025, it’s showing up in more backend systems than ever, especially in startups where time and cost matter more than squeezing out every last drop of performance. It’s also dominating scripting tasks and automating workflows across industries.</p>\n\n<p>It’s not flashy. It’s not the newest. But it gets stuff done. And in greenfield projects, that’s everything.</p>\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  JavaScript: The Language That Won’t Quit\n</h2>\n\n<p>People like to hate it, but no one’s dropping it. JavaScript still powers the web—everything from SPAs to full-stack systems with Node.js. It’s everywhere: browsers, mobile apps, even servers.</p>\n\n<p>What’s new in 2025? TypeScript has become the preferred flavor. It keeps JavaScript's flexibility but adds type safety. That matters when you're scaling teams or building large applications. Greenfield software development teams are picking JavaScript with React or Vue for frontend, and Node.js or Deno on the backend.</p>\n\n<p>It’s fast to launch with. Tons of developer support. Huge community. If you’re building a web-based product, it’s still a top pick.</p>\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  Go: Clean and Fast for Scalable Backends\n</h2>\n\n<p>Go has carved a space where speed and concurrency meet simplicity. Born at Google, it’s made for servers, cloud-native tools, and backend APIs. In 2025, it’s now a regular choice for companies scaling their infrastructure.</p>\n\n<p>It’s not the most elegant language. But it compiles fast, handles concurrency well, and reduces a lot of overhead in managing services. In greenfield software development where performance and reliability are top priorities, Go is used to set the foundation right.</p>\n\n<p>You’ll see it in SaaS platforms, DevOps tooling, microservices, and even some CLI tools.</p>\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  Rust: For When Performance and Safety Matter\n</h2>\n\n<p>Rust isn’t for the faint of heart. It takes longer to learn. But if your project needs low-level control, memory safety, and blazing speed—Rust wins.</p>\n\n<p>By 2025, more teams are embracing it in <a href=\"https://www.weblineindia.com/blog/greenfield-software-development-offshore-teams/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">greenfield software development</a>, especially in areas like embedded systems, blockchain, real-time processing, and gaming. It’s not just a niche anymore. Even major browsers and cloud tools are shipping Rust code in production.</p>\n\n<p>It’s the kind of language that rewards commitment. If you’re building something serious—like performance-critical applications—Rust is worth investing time in.</p>\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  Kotlin: The Android Favorite That’s Expanding\n</h2>\n\n<p>Kotlin started out as a better Java for Android, but now it’s more than that. It runs on the JVM, plays nice with existing Java code, and feels modern. Cleaner syntax. Less boilerplate.</p>\n\n<p>In 2025, Kotlin is being used not just for mobile apps but also backend services and even full-stack applications with Kotlin Multiplatform. It’s one of those “quietly growing” languages, especially in teams that want a safe upgrade path from Java.</p>\n\n<p>It’s especially useful in greenfield software development where Android is the focus or when you want flexibility without rewriting your whole stack.</p>\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  Swift: Locked In for iOS Projects\n</h2>\n\n<p>Apple wants everyone using Swift—and they’re getting their way. It’s replacing Objective-C in most iOS and macOS projects. The language is faster, cleaner, and better supported across Apple’s development ecosystem.</p>\n\n<p>In 2025, Swift is being used in most new iOS projects. If your team’s working on a greenfield app for the App Store, this is your go-to language. Apple keeps improving the language and adding features like better async support and tools for UI development (like SwiftUI).</p>\n\n<p>Not a huge leap in usage, but it’s entrenched and strong.</p>\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  C#: Solid, Stable, and Game-Ready\n</h2>\n\n<p>C# may not be flashy, but it’s powering enterprise software, games, and even cross-platform mobile apps via tools like Xamarin and MAUI. Backed by Microsoft, it’s staying up to date with the times.</p>\n\n<p>In 2025, it’s especially popular in desktop applications, backend APIs for Microsoft shops, and game development (hello, Unity). It’s also a strong candidate in greenfield software development inside businesses already running .NET infrastructure.</p>\n\n<p>C# just works. It’s structured, safe, and widely supported.</p>\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  SQL and NoSQL: Still Required Knowledge\n</h2>\n\n<p>No matter what language you write in, you’ll end up needing to deal with data. That’s where SQL and NoSQL systems come in. PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite, MongoDB, and DynamoDB are everywhere.</p>\n\n<p>Knowing how to work with relational and non-relational databases is still a must. You don’t need to master them, but you do need to be comfortable writing queries, setting indexes, and designing schemas that won’t cause headaches later.</p>\n\n<p>Greenfield software development means making clean choices from the start. If your data structure’s a mess early, it’s tough to fix later.</p>\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  Which Language Should You Learn in 2025?\n</h2>\n\n<p>That really depends on what you want to build and where you want to work.</p>\n\n<p>Web development? JavaScript and TypeScript.</p>\n\n<p>Backend systems? Go, Python, or C#.</p>\n\n<p>High-performance tools? Rust.</p>\n\n<p>Android apps? Kotlin.</p>\n\n<p>iOS apps? Swift.</p>\n\n<p>Game dev? C# with Unity.</p>\n\n<p>Data-heavy apps? Python and SQL.</p>\n\n<p>You don’t need to master them all. Pick one that aligns with your goals and stick with it long enough to get comfortable. Once you know one well, it’s easier to pick up others.</p>\n\n<p>Want to work on a startup idea? Or join a small team? Learn languages that get you from concept to prototype fast—like JavaScript or Python. Want to build large, high-performance systems? Dig into Go or Rust.</p>\n\n<p>It’s not about what’s trendy. It’s about what helps you solve real problems.</p>\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  Final Thoughts: Making the Right Bet\n</h2>\n\n<p>There’s no universal “best” language. Each one exists for a reason. The best choice is the one that helps you build, scale, and maintain your product without getting in your way.</p>\n\n<p>Keep your ear to the ground. Stay hands-on. And don’t worry about trying to chase every trend. The best developers in 2025 are the ones who know how to solve problems—not just those who know every language.</p>\n\n<p>Whatever you pick, make sure it fits your project, your team, and your goals. And if you're building something from the ground up, keep your choices lean and focused. That's how you keep momentum.</p>\n\n","contentLength":0,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Why Project Euler Might Be the Most Powerful DSA Trainer You're Not Using Yet","url":"https://dev.to/sanukhandev/why-project-euler-might-be-the-most-powerful-dsa-trainer-youre-not-using-yet-293c","date":1750146064,"author":"Sanu Khan","guid":159432,"unread":true,"content":"<blockquote>\n<p><em>“Most coders know LeetCode.

Phase 3: Think Algorithmically (Problems 41–80)\n</h3>\n\n<p>Time to introduce <strong>sieves</strong>, <strong>prefix sums</strong>, and <strong>backtracking</strong>.</p>\n\n<p><strong>🧩 Example:</strong><br><br>\n<strong>Problem 50 – Consecutive Prime Sum</strong><br><br>\nFind the prime below 1 million that can be written as the longest sum of consecutive

Tailwind solves this with a <strong>utility-first</strong> approach — giving you full control over styling, responsiveness, and accessibility.</p>\n\n\n\n\n<h3>\n  \n  \n  Styling Django Forms with Tailwind\n</h3>\n\n<p>To make Django forms look great with Tailwind, you can:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Override default widgets</li>\n<li>Inject custom CSS classes into form fields</li>\n<li>Use third-party packages like <code>django-crispy-forms</code> or <code>django-widget-tweaks</code>\n</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Here’s how to style a text input manually:<br>\n</p>\n\n<div class=\"highlight js-code-highlight\">\n<pre class=\"highlight python\"><code><span class=\"kn\">from</span> <span class=\"n\">django</span> <span class=\"kn\">import</span> <span class=\"n\">forms</span>\n\n<span class=\"k\">class</span> <span class=\"nc\">ContactForm</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">forms</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"n\">Form</span><span class=\"p\">):</span>\n    <span class=\"n\">name</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"n\">forms</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nc\">CharField</span><span class=\"p\">(</span>\n        <span class=\"n\">widget</span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"n\">forms</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nc\">TextInput</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">attrs</span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"p\">{</span>\n            <span class=\"sh\">'</span><span class=\"s\">class</span><span class=\"sh\">'</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"sh\">'</span><span class=\"s\">block w-full px-4 py-2 border rounded-md text-gray-900 focus:ring-2 focus:ring-indigo-500 focus:outline-none</span><span class=\"sh\">'</span>\n        <span class=\"p\">})</span>\n    <span class=\"p\">)</span>\n</code></pre>\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>Tailwind’s classes give your input a clean, accessible look with smooth focus styles.</p>\n\n\n\n\n<h3>\n  \n  \n  Form Layout with Tailwind Utilities\n</h3>\n\n<p>Use Tailwind’s layout utilities to structure the form:<br>\n</p>\n\n<div class=\"highlight js-code-highlight\">\n<pre class=\"highlight html\"><code><span class=\"nt\">&lt;form</span> <span class=\"na\">class=</span><span class=\"s\">\"space-y-6\"</span><span class=\"nt\">&gt;</span>\n  <span class=\"nt\">&lt;div&gt;</span>\n    <span class=\"nt\">&lt;label</span> <span class=\"na\">for=</span><span class=\"s\">\"email\"</span> <span class=\"na\">class=</span><span class=\"s\">\"block text-sm font-medium text-gray-700\"</span><span class=\"nt\">&gt;</span>Email<span class=\"nt\">&lt;/label&gt;</span>\n    <span class=\"nt\">&lt;input</span> <span class=\"na\">id=</span><span class=\"s\">\"email\"</span> <span class=\"na\">name=</span><span class=\"s\">\"email\"</span> <span class=\"na\">type=</span><span class=\"s\">\"email\"</span> <span class=\"na\">required</span>\n      <span class=\"na\">class=</span><span class=\"s\">\"mt-1 block w-full px-4 py-2 border rounded-md text-gray-900 focus:ring-indigo-500 focus:ring-2 focus:outline-none\"</span><span class=\"nt\">&gt;</span>\n  <span class=\"nt\">&lt;/div&gt;</span>\n\n  <span class=\"nt\">&lt;div&gt;</span>\n    <span class=\"nt\">&lt;button</span> <span class=\"na\">type=</span><span class=\"s\">\"submit\"</span>\n      <span class=\"na\">class=</span><span class=\"s\">\"bg-indigo-600 hover:bg-indigo-700 text-white font-semibold py-2 px-4 rounded-md\"</span><span class=\"nt\">&gt;</span>\n      Submit\n    <span class=\"nt\">&lt;/button&gt;</span>\n  <span class=\"nt\">&lt;/div&gt;</span>\n<span class=\"nt\">&lt;/form&gt;</span>\n</code></pre>\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>For multi-column forms:<br>\n</p>\n\n<div class=\"highlight js-code-highlight\">\n<pre class=\"highlight html\"><code><span class=\"nt\">&lt;div</span> <span class=\"na\">class=</span><span class=\"s\">\"grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 gap-6\"</span><span class=\"nt\">&gt;</span>\n  <span class=\"c\">&lt;!-- Two inputs side-by-side --&gt;</span>\n<span class=\"nt\">&lt;/div&gt;</span>\n</code></pre>\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<h3>\n  \n  \n  Error Handling with Style\n</h3>\n\n<p>Render Django form errors like this:<br>\n</p>\n\n<div class=\"highlight js-code-highlight\">\n<pre class=\"highlight html\"><code>{% if form.name.errors %}\n  <span class=\"nt\">&lt;p</span> <span class=\"na\">class=</span><span class=\"s\">\"text-sm text-red-600 mt-1\"</span><span class=\"nt\">&gt;</span>{{ form.name.errors.0 }}<span class=\"nt\">&lt;/p&gt;</span>\n{% endif %}\n</code></pre>\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>Maintain clear feedback without breaking your layout.</p>\n\n\n\n\n<h3>\n  \n  \n  Reusable Patterns &amp;

You show it what to do, reward it for getting closer to the desired outcome, and correct it when it’s wrong. This iterative process of trial, feedback, and adjustment is analogous to how artificial neural networks learn – a process powered by backpropagation. This seemingly complex algorithm is the engine behind many of the remarkable advancements in artificial intelligence, from image recognition to self-driving cars. But what exactly <em>is</em> backpropagation, and how does it work its magic?</p>\n\n<p>At its heart, backpropagation is an algorithm used to train artificial neural networks. These networks, inspired by the human brain, consist of interconnected nodes (neurons) organized in layers. Information flows forward through these layers, undergoing transformations at each step until a final output is produced. Think of it like an assembly line: raw materials (input data) enter, undergo various processes (transformations within the layers), and finally emerge as a finished product (the network's prediction).</p>\n\n<p>The magic of backpropagation lies in how it determines the adjustments needed to improve the network’s accuracy. Let's break it down:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Forward Pass: The Prediction Phase</strong></p>\n\n<p>First, the input data is fed into the network. Each connection between neurons has an associated weight – a numerical value that determines the strength of the connection. As the data travels through the network, these weights modify the data at each layer, ultimately leading to a final output, or prediction. For example, if the network is trained to identify images of cats, the input would be an image, and the output would be a probability score indicating how likely the image is to be a cat.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Backward Pass: The Learning Phase</strong></p>\n\n<p>This is where the brilliance of backpropagation shines. Once the network makes a prediction, it compares this prediction to the actual, known value (the \"ground truth\"). The difference between the prediction and the ground truth is the error. Backpropagation then uses this error to adjust the weights of the connections within the network. It does this by working backward through the network, layer by layer.</p>\n\n<p>Imagine the error as a ripple in a pond. Backpropagation traces this ripple back to its source, identifying which connections contributed most significantly to the error. It then proportionally adjusts the weights of these connections, reducing the influence of those that contributed negatively to the prediction. This adjustment is done using calculus (specifically, the chain rule of differentiation), but the core concept is simple: reduce the error by tweaking the weights.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Iterative Refinement: The Path to Accuracy</strong></p>\n\n<p>The forward and backward passes are repeated iteratively, with the network continuously refining its weights based on the errors it makes. This process, akin to the dog learning its trick through repeated attempts and corrections, gradually improves the network’s accuracy in making predictions. The more iterations (epochs) the network undergoes, the more refined its weights become, and the better it performs on new, unseen data.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Significance and Applications:</strong></p>\n\n<p>Backpropagation’s significance cannot be overstated. It’s the foundation of modern deep learning, enabling the development of sophisticated AI systems capable of:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Image recognition:</strong>  Powering facial recognition software, medical image analysis, and self-driving car vision systems.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Natural language processing:</strong>  Driving machine translation, chatbots, and sentiment analysis tools.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Speech recognition:</strong>  Enabling voice assistants like Siri and Alexa.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Drug discovery:</strong>  Accelerating the identification of potential drug candidates.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Financial modeling:</strong>  Improving risk assessment and fraud detection.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Challenges and Limitations:</strong></p>\n\n<p>Despite its power, backpropagation faces challenges:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Vanishing gradients:</strong>  In very deep networks, the error signal can become extremely small as it propagates backward, hindering learning in the early layers.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Computational cost:</strong>  Training large neural networks can be computationally expensive, requiring significant processing power and time.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Data dependency:</strong>  The performance of a network heavily relies on the quality and quantity of training data.  Biased or insufficient data can lead to inaccurate and unfair predictions.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Interpretability:</strong>  Understanding <em>why</em> a deep neural network makes a particular prediction can be challenging, raising concerns about transparency and accountability.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Ethical Considerations:</strong></p>\n\n<p>The widespread adoption of backpropagation-powered AI raises ethical concerns. Bias in training data can perpetuate and amplify existing societal biases, leading to unfair or discriminatory outcomes. The lack of transparency in complex neural networks can make it difficult to identify and address these biases. Careful consideration of ethical implications is crucial for responsible AI development and deployment.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong></p>\n\n<p>Backpropagation, despite its technical complexity, is a remarkably elegant algorithm that has revolutionized the field of artificial intelligence. It's the engine driving the advancements we see in various sectors, from healthcare to finance. While challenges remain, ongoing research continues to address limitations and mitigate ethical concerns. As we refine our understanding and application of this powerful technique, we can expect even more transformative advancements in the years to come. The future of AI, in many ways, rests upon the shoulders of this seemingly simple yet profoundly impactful algorithm.</p>\n\n","contentLength":0,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Day 9: Supercharge FastAPI with Async Programming","url":"https://dev.to/awslearnerdaily/day-9-supercharge-fastapi-with-async-programming-3op4","date":1750133030,"author":"Utkarsh Rastogi","guid":159349,"unread":true,"content":"<p>Welcome to <strong>Day 9</strong> of our <strong>FastAPI Zero to Hero</strong> series!</p>\n\n<p>Today we unlock one of the most powerful (yet misunderstood) tools in modern web development — <strong>Async Programming</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  🧠 What is Async Programming?\n</h2>\n\n<p>Writing <strong>non-blocking code</strong> can be accomplished through async programming.</p>\n\n<p>This implies that your program doesn't <strong>wait</strong> for sluggish operations (such as file reads or API requests) to complete before continuing.

FastAPI\n</h2>\n\n<p>✅ <strong>Great for</strong>:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Calling external APIs</li>\n<li>Fetching data from databases with async drivers</li>\n<li>File or network I/O</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>❌ <strong>Not ideal for</strong>:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Heavy CPU tasks (e.g., image processing, number crunching)\n&gt; Use tools like <strong>Celery</strong> or <strong>background workers</strong> for those scenarios.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  ✅ Wrap-Up\n</h2>\n\n<p>In this post, we explored the real-world difference between <strong>sync</strong> and <strong>async</strong> code in FastAPI by simulating delayed external API calls.</p>\n\n<p>🔍 We discovered:</p>\n\n<p>Synchronous routes reduce down performance by blocking execution.<br>\nHow asynchronous routes that use <code>async def</code> and <code>httpx</code> scale and   operate more quickly.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li> How <code>asyncio.gather()</code> enables I/O-bound tasks to be executed in parallel.\nJust by altering the way we create and organise our code, <strong>async can cut total time roughly in half</strong>!</li>\n</ul>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Async programming is a game-changer for creating scalable and responsive online APIs; it's not simply a trendy term.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Whether you're developing real-time dashboards, microservices, or API connections, using async may greatly enhance

Whether it's data scraping, automating tasks, or enhancing user experience, AI is at the forefront of innovation. However, one often overlooked but crucial component in AI’s development and application is the use of proxy IPs. In this article, we will explore the application and development of proxy IPs in AI and how they are used for optimizing web scraping, enhancing privacy, and supporting data processing for AI models.</p>\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  The Future of Proxy IPs in AI Development\n</h2>\n\n<p>As AI continues to evolve, so too will the role of proxy IPs in its development. The growing need for high-quality data to train AI models, coupled with the increasing sophistication of anti-scraping technologies, will push the demand for smarter and more efficient proxy solutions. The future of proxy IPs in AI could include the integration of:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Machine Learning for Proxy Selection: AI systems will be able to intelligently select the most effective proxies for each task, enhancing efficiency and reducing the risk of detection.</li>\n<li>Proxy IPs with Enhanced Security: With privacy concerns at the forefront, we will see an increased focus on proxies that offer better encryption, secure tunneling, and greater protection against hacking attempts.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  Best Practices for Using Proxy IPs in AI\n</h2>\n\n<p>To ensure that your AI projects benefit from proxy IPs without running into legal or ethical issues, consider the following best practices:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Adhere to Legal Regulations: Always review the terms of service of the websites you are scraping. Ensure that your use of proxies complies with local laws and regulations.</li>\n<li>Avoid Overloading Servers: When using proxies for web scraping, ensure that you are not making too many requests in a short period, as this can lead to server overloads and possible legal action.</li>\n<li>Maintain Ethical Standards: Scraping data for malicious purposes or without proper authorization can damage your reputation and harm your AI project. Use proxies responsibly and ethically.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>AI model training requires a large amount of labeled data, which usually needs to be captured from multiple websites or APIs. Using proxy IP can disperse requests and avoid a single IP being blocked due to frequent access, thereby improving the efficiency of data capture.</p>\n\n<p>Technical implementation example (Python):<br>\n<a href=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fg23s789uwkt22wo88y1u.png\" class=\"article-body-image-wrapper\"><img src=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fg23s789uwkt22wo88y1u.png\" alt=\"Image description\" width=\"800\" height=\"419\"></a></p>\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  Conclusion\n</h2>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.thordata.com/?ls=dev&amp;lk=d1\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Proxy IPs</a> play a vital role in the development and application of AI, especially in web scraping, privacy protection, and overcoming geographical restrictions.

I\ntook some notes for myself to reflect on that experience.  I won't bore\nyou with another vibecoding post, but you can read <a href=\"https://steipete.me/posts/2025/vibetunnel-turn-any-browser-into-your-mac-terminal\">Peter's post</a>\nabout how that went.</p><p>As fun as it was, it also was frustrating in other ways and in entire\npredictable ways.  It became a meme about how much I hated working with\nXcode for this project.  This got me thinking quite a bit more that this\nhas been an entirely unacceptable experience for a long time, but with\nprogramming agents, the pain becomes measurable.</p><p>When I first dove into programming I found the idea of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RTFM\">RTFM</a> quite hilarious.  “Why are you\nasking dumb questions, just read it up.”  The unfortunate reality is that\nthe manual often doesn't exist — or is wrong.  In fact, we as engineers\nare quite willing to subject each others to completely inadequate tooling,\nbad or missing documentation and ridiculous API footguns all the time.\n“User error” is what we used to call this, nowadays it's a “skill issue”.\nIt puts the blame on the user and absolves the creator, at least\nmomentarily.  For APIs it can be random crashes if you use a function\nwrong, for programs it can be impossible to navigate UI or lack of error\nmessages.  There are many different ways in which we humans get stuck.</p><p>What agents change about this is, is that I can subject them to something\nI wouldn't really want to subject other developers to: measuring.  I\npicked the language for my current project by running basic evals and it\nworked well.  I learned from that, that there are objectively better and\nworse language when it comes to my particular problem.  The choice however\nis not just how much the AI knows about the language from the corpus of\nexamples during training.  It's also tooling, the inherent capabilities\nof the language, ecosystem churn and other aspects.</p><p>Using agents to measure code quality is great because agents don't judge\nme, but they do judge the code they are writing.  Not all agents will\nswear, but they will <a href=\"https://x.com/ankrgyl/status/1934415308800053485\">express frustration with libraries</a> when loops don't go\nwell or give up.  That opens up an opportunity to bring some measurements\ninto not agent performance, but the health of a project.</p><p>We should pay more attention to how healthy engineering teams are, and\nthat starts with the code base.  Using agents we can put some numbers to\nit in which we cannot do with humans (or in a very slow and expensive\nway).  We can figure out how successful agents are in using the things are\nare creating in rather objective ways which is in many ways a proxy for\nhow humans experience working with the code.  Getting together with fresh\nsouls to walk them through a tutorial or some tasks is laborious and\nexpensive.  Getting agents that have never seen a codebase start using a\nlibrary is repeatable, rather cheap, fast and if set up the right way very\nobjective.  It also takes the emotion out of it or running the experiment\nmultiple times.</p><p>Now obviously we can have debates over if the type of code we would write\nwith an agent is objectively beautiful or if the way agents execute tools\ncreates the right type of tools.  This is a debate worth having.  Right at\nthis very moment though what programming agents need to be successful is\nrather well aligned with what humans need.</p><p>So what works better than other things?  For now these are basic\nindicators, for agents and humans alike:</p><ul><li> they help with future code writing but they also\ngreatly help preventing regressions.  Hopefully no surprise to anyone.\nI would add though that this is not just for the tests, but also for\nexamples and small tools that a user and agent can run to validate\nbehavior manually.</li><li> a compiler, tool or an API that does not\nprovide good error reporting is a bad tool.  I have been harping on this\nfor years when working at Sentry, but with agents it becomes even\nclearer that this investment pays off.  It also means errors should be\nwhere they can be found.  If errors are hidden in an obscure log neither\nhuman nor agent will find it.</li><li><strong>High ecosystem stability:</strong> if your ecosystem churns a lot, if APIs keep\nchanging you will not just upset humans, you will also slow down the\nagent.  It will find outdated docs, examples and patterns and it will\nslow down / write bad code.</li><li><strong>Few superfluous abstractions:</strong> too many layers just make data flow and\nrefactoring expensive.  We might even want to start questioning the\nvalue proposition of (most) ORMs today because of how much harder they\nmake things.</li><li><strong>Everything needs to be fast and user friendly:</strong> The quicker tools\nrespond (and the less useless output they produce) the better.\nCrashes are tolerable; hangs are problematic.   for instance is a\nmuch better experience in Python than any of the rest of the ecosystem,\neven though most of the ecosystem points at .  Agents are super\nhappy to use and keep using  because they get good infos out of it,\nand low failure rates.</li><li> If stuff only reproduces in CI you have to move\nyour agent into CI.  That's not a good experience.  Give your agent a\nway to run Docker locally.  If you write a backend, make sure there is a\ndatabase to access and introspect, don't just mock it out (badly).\nDeferring things into a CI flow is not an option.  It's also important\nthat it's clear when the devenv is broken vs the code is broken.  For\nboth human and agent it can be hard to distinguish this if the tooling\nis not set up correctly.</li></ul><p>When an agent struggles, so does a human.  There is a lot of code and\ntooling out there which is objectively not good, but because of one reason\nor another became dominant.  If you want to start paying attention to\ntechnology choices or you want to start writing your own libraries, now\nyou can use agents to evaluate the developer experience.</p><p>Because so can your users.  I can confidently say it's not just me that\ndoes not like Xcode, my agent also expresses frustration — measurably so.</p>","contentLength":5929,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"My Journey with the Zen of Python: Learning to Code, Learning to Grow","url":"https://dev.to/pounds_lord/my-journey-with-the-zen-of-python-learning-to-code-learning-to-grow-423c","date":1750116456,"author":"Pounds Lord","guid":157656,"unread":true,"content":"<p>When I signed up for the <em>\"From Zero to Hero\"</em> Python Mentorship Program, I wasn’t just hoping to learn how to code — I was looking for something deeper. A fresh start. A new direction. Like many people starting in tech, I’ve had moments of doubt. I’ve looked at lines of code and felt lost. But I’ve also looked at tech and seen a future where I could thrive.</p>\n\n<p>Then I found something that really clicked: <strong>The Zen of Python</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>At first, I thought it was just a list of programming rules. But I soon realized it’s so much more — it’s a mindset. It’s about how we think, how we write, and how we grow. As I’ve begun learning Python, a few of these principles have stuck with me in ways I didn’t expect.</p>\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  🧘🏾‍♂️ The Zen of Python and Me\n</h2>\n\n<h3>\n  \n  \n  “Simple is better than complex.”\n</h3>\n\n<p>Early on, I thought great coding meant writing complicated solutions. But I’m learning that the real challenge — and beauty — is in simplicity. Simple code is easier to understand, easier to improve, and easier to trust. I now aim to keep things clear and straightforward. Mastering the basics, not skipping them, is my new superpower.</p>\n\n<h3>\n  \n  \n  “Readability counts.”\n</h3>\n\n<p>This principle made me rethink how I write code entirely. If someone else can read and understand my code without needing a decoder ring, that’s a win. It pushes me to be thoughtful with my structure, naming, and even comments. Code isn’t just for machines — it’s for humans too.</p>\n\n<h3>\n  \n  \n  “Now is better than never.”\n</h3>\n\n<p>This one hits home. I’ve spent too much time waiting — waiting to feel ready, waiting for the “perfect” moment. But truth is, the perfect time rarely comes. This mentorship reminded me that <em>starting now</em>, even imperfectly, is better than standing still. I’m in motion, and I’m not turning back.</p>\n\n<h3>\n  \n  \n  “There should be one — and preferably only one — obvious way to do it.”\n</h3>\n\n<p>In a world full of choices, this principle is grounding. It helps me pause and ask: “What’s the cleanest, most understandable way to solve this?” I want my code to be solid, not just functional — and this idea is helping shape that mindset.</p>\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  🌱 What I Want from This Journey\n</h2>\n\n<p>My goals for this mentorship go beyond just “learning Python.” I want to become confident applying Python to <strong>cybersecurity and data analysis</strong> — two areas that really excite me. Whether it’s writing scripts to analyze attacks, build automations, or make systems safer, I want to build the skills that matter.</p>\n\n<p>I also want to grow personally — in focus, in resilience, and in belief. Learning to code is teaching me how to break problems down, how to stay calm under pressure, and how to keep moving forward when things get hard.</p>\n\n<p>Eventually, I see myself building a career that gives me <strong>freedom</strong> — financial, creative, and personal. Tech opens doors, and I want to walk through them not just as a developer, but as a builder of real impact.</p>\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  💡 Why I Joined\n</h2>\n\n<p>Honestly? I joined because I was tired of watching from the sidelines. I wanted to be part of something that pushed me forward. This program came at the right time — and it feels like a lifeline.</p>\n\n<p>It’s not always easy. But with every lesson, every mistake, every small win, I’m becoming the person I imagined when I signed up: someone with skills, confidence, and direction.</p>\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  🙏🏾 Thank You\n</h2>\n\n<p>A heartfelt thank you to <strong>Black Python Dev</strong> for creating this opportunity.

Jupyter notebooks let you mix runnable code, notes, and pretty plots in one share‑able file. In this guide we’ll spin up a notebook, load data, build a logistic regression classifier, and visualize the results. No sweat!</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>tldr; We’ll install Jupyter with pip, crack open a notebook, wrangle a CSV in pandas, train &amp; evaluate a scikit‑learn model, and chart its performance. All inside a single <code>.ipynb</code>. You’ll finish with a repeatable workflow you can fork for any ML idea.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  Setting Up / Prerequisites\n</h2>\n\n<ul>\n<li>\n<code>Python</code> ≥ 3.9 (use pyenv or the official installer)</li>\n<li>\n<code>pip</code> or <code>conda</code> package manager</li>\n<li>\n<code>Virtual environment</code> (e.g., <code>python -m venv venv</code> or <code>conda create -n ml-jupyter python=3.11</code>)</li>\n<li>A terminal with <code>git</code> (optional, for dataset download)</li>\n<li>The following Python packages:\n</li>\n</ul>\n\n<div class=\"highlight js-code-highlight\">\n<pre class=\"highlight shell\"><code>pip <span class=\"nb\">install </span>jupyterlab pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn\n</code></pre>\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  Why Jupyter Rocks (and How to Use it Well)\n</h2>\n\n<p>Jupyter isn't just a place to run Python. It's a digital lab notebook built for messy, iterative exploration. You don't have to write a full script before running your code. Instead, you write and run cells one at a time, keeping results visible as you go.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Tip: Think of each cell as a test tube: Mix something new, see what happens, make notes, then move on.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Some key notebook best-practices:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>\n<code>Break work into small cells</code> - Each step (importing, loading data, preprocessing, training, etc.) should be its own cell. This helps with debugging and lets you rerun only the parts you need.</li>\n<li>\n<code>Use markdown cells to narrate</code> - Don't just write code, explain it! You can use markdown cells to add headings, lists.... Markdown and even LaTeX math for formulas.</li>\n<li>\n<code>Restart &amp; run all often</code> - Use <code>Kernal -&gt; Restart Kernal and Run All Cells</code> to ensure your notebook runs from top to bottom.</li>\n<li>\n<code>Name your notebooks clearly</code> - Use descriptive names like <code>edh-staple-classifier.ipynb</code> so you can find them later.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  Implementation Steps\n</h2>\n\n<h3>\n  \n  \n  Launch Jupyter\n</h3>\n\n<p>Before you write a single line of Python you need a notebook server running. <code>jupyter lab</code> boots up a lightweight web server on <code>localhost:8888</code> (or the next free port) and opens your default browser. From here every notebook lives in the directory you launched the command from, so start it at the root of your project folder.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Tip: If you prefer the classic interface, swap <code>lab</code> for <code>notebook</code>. Add <code>--port 9000</code>.<br>\n</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<div class=\"highlight js-code-highlight\">\n<pre class=\"highlight shell\"><code>jupyter lab <span class=\"c\"># or: jupyter notebook</span>\n</code></pre>\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<h3>\n  \n  \n  Create a Notebook\n</h3>\n\n<p>In the Jupyter UI choose File → New → Notebook and select <code>Python 3</code>. A new tab appears with an empty code cell and an auto‑generated filename like <code>Untitled.ipynb</code>. Rename it to something memorable (e.g., <code>edh-staple-classifier.ipynb</code>) so future‑you can find it quickly.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Note: Every notebook is tied to a kernel. A kernal is an active Python process that keeps variables in memory between cell runs.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h3>\n  \n  \n  Import Libraries\n</h3>\n\n<p>Your first code cell should gather every library you’ll need. Keeping imports together makes it easier to debug missing packages and rerun the whole notebook end‑to‑end. Notice we pull in <code>matplotlib</code> before <code>seaborn</code>; the latter piggybacks on the former for plotting.<br>\n</p>\n\n<div class=\"highlight js-code-highlight\">\n<pre class=\"highlight python\"><code><span class=\"kn\">import</span> <span class=\"n\">pandas</span> <span class=\"k\">as</span> <span class=\"n\">pd</span>\n<span class=\"kn\">from</span> <span class=\"n\">sklearn.model_selection</span> <span class=\"kn\">import</span> <span class=\"n\">train_test_split</span>\n<span class=\"kn\">from</span> <span class=\"n\">sklearn.linear_model</span> <span class=\"kn\">import</span> <span class=\"n\">LogisticRegression</span>\n<span class=\"kn\">from</span> <span class=\"n\">sklearn.metrics</span> <span class=\"kn\">import</span> <span class=\"n\">classification_report</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"n\">confusion_matrix</span>\n<span class=\"kn\">import</span> <span class=\"n\">matplotlib.pyplot</span> <span class=\"k\">as</span> <span class=\"n\">plt</span>\n<span class=\"kn\">import</span> <span class=\"n\">seaborn</span> <span class=\"k\">as</span> <span class=\"n\">sns</span>\n</code></pre>\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Tip: Add <code>%reload_ext autoreload</code> and <code>%autoreload 2</code> if you’re developing helper modules alongside the notebook. Jupyter will hot‑reload them on every cell run.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h3>\n  \n  \n  Load &amp; Inspect Data\n</h3>\n\n<p>Jupyter automatically renders pandas DataFrames as slick HTML tables, so a simple <code>df.head()</code> becomes an instant mini‑dashboard. Always eyeball the first few rows and call <code>df.info()</code> to catch missing values or wonky dtypes before you train.<br>\n</p>\n\n<div class=\"highlight js-code-highlight\">\n<pre class=\"highlight python\"><code><span class=\"n\">df</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"n\">pd</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nf\">read_csv</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"sh\">'</span><span class=\"s\">cards.csv</span><span class=\"sh\">'</span><span class=\"p\">)</span> <span class=\"c1\"># sample MTG card dataset\n</span><span class=\"nf\">display</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">df</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nf\">head</span><span class=\"p\">())</span>\n<span class=\"n\">df</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nf\">info</span><span class=\"p\">()</span>\n</code></pre>\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Gotcha: If your CSV lives on the web, read it directly with <code>pd.read_csv('https://...')</code>—no download step required!</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h3>\n  \n  \n  Pre‑process Features\n</h3>\n\n<p>Feature engineering is where ML wins or loses.

Yet in order to do so, we have to deal with it.</p>\n\n<p>Now, one could go ahead and have the function actually read a file, but this leads to follow up problems like:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Will the file be cleaned up after the test?</li>\n<li>Will it also be cleaned up if something fails?</li>\n<li>What if there is already a file with the needed name?</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>As mentioned before, we do not actually want to test <code>Path.open</code> so why not take it out of the equation completely?</p>\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  About monkeypatching\n</h2>\n\n<p>Definition of monkeypatching according to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monkey_patch\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">wikipedia</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>In computer programming, monkey patching is a technique used to dynamically update the behavior of a piece of code at run-time. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>We will see how to use monkeypatching to replace functionality with mock objects that make testing easier.</p>\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  First step\n</h2>\n\n<p>Let us assume the following folder structure<br>\n</p>\n\n<div class=\"highlight js-code-highlight\">\n<pre class=\"highlight plaintext\"><code>mp_test/\n    utils.py\n    testing.py\n</code></pre>\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>where <code>utils.py</code> contains the code from above. As a first step, lets try to do this:<br>\n</p>\n\n<div class=\"highlight js-code-highlight\">\n<pre class=\"highlight python\"><code><span class=\"c1\"># testing.py\n</span><span class=\"kn\">from</span> <span class=\"n\">mp_test.utils</span> <span class=\"kn\">import</span> <span class=\"n\">read_file</span>\n\n<span class=\"k\">def</span> <span class=\"nf\">test_read_file</span><span class=\"p\">():</span>\n    <span class=\"n\">value</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"nf\">read_file</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"sh\">'</span><span class=\"s\">test_file</span><span class=\"sh\">'</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n\n</code></pre>\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>Running this test will give us the expected error<br>\n</p>\n\n<div class=\"highlight js-code-highlight\">\n<pre class=\"highlight plaintext\"><code>FAILED testing.py::test_read_file - FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'test_file_foo'\n</code></pre>\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>Based on the documentation on the <a href=\"https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/reference/reference.html#pytest.MonkeyPatch.setattr\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">monkeypatch fixture</a> lets try something like this:<br>\n</p>\n\n<div class=\"highlight js-code-highlight\">\n<pre class=\"highlight python\"><code><span class=\"c1\"># testing.py\n</span><span class=\"kn\">from</span> <span class=\"n\">mp_test.utils</span> <span class=\"kn\">import</span> <span class=\"n\">read_file</span>\n<span class=\"kn\">import</span> <span class=\"n\">pathlib</span>\n\n<span class=\"k\">def</span> <span class=\"nf\">test_read_file</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">monkeypatch</span><span class=\"p\">):</span>\n    <span class=\"n\">monkeypatch</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nf\">setattr</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">pathlib</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"sh\">\"</span><span class=\"s\">Path</span><span class=\"sh\">\"</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"k\">lambda</span> <span class=\"n\">x</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"nf\">print</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">x</span><span class=\"p\">))</span>\n    <span class=\"n\">value</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"nf\">read_file</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"sh\">'</span><span class=\"s\">test_file</span><span class=\"sh\">'</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n</code></pre>\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>What did happen here?</p>\n\n<p>First of all we are using the <code>monkeypatch</code> fixture and use it to replace how <code>Path</code> is working in <code>pathlib</code>. For starters, I just want it to print the name of the path that was given to it.</p>\n\n<p>But there is a problem, when we execute this code, the same error like before does occur.<br>\n</p>\n\n<div class=\"highlight js-code-highlight\">\n<pre class=\"highlight plaintext\"><code># pytest output\nFAILED testing.py::test_read_file - FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'test_file_foo'\n</code></pre>\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>So what went wrong here? Did we do something wrong? Is monkey-patching just a scheme which does not really work?</p>\n\n<p>Turns out, the problem is what (or better where) we have patched. To understand that, we should take a look at this part of the <a href=\"https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.mock.html#where-to-patch\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">unittest.mock documentation</a> which is linked in the pytest documentation:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>patch() works by (temporarily) changing the object that a name points to with another one. There can be many names pointing to any individual object, so for patching to work you must ensure that you patch the name used by the system under test.</p>\n\n<p>The basic principle is that you patch where an object is looked up, which is not necessarily the same place as where it is defined.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>If we look again at the content of <code>utils.py</code> we see that <code>Path</code> is also imported there. So in order for the patch to work, you have to also patch it there.<br>\n</p>\n\n<div class=\"highlight js-code-highlight\">\n<pre class=\"highlight python\"><code><span class=\"c1\"># testing.py\n</span><span class=\"kn\">from</span> <span class=\"n\">mp_test.utils</span> <span class=\"kn\">import</span> <span class=\"n\">read_file</span>\n<span class=\"kn\">import</span> <span class=\"n\">mp_test</span>\n\n<span class=\"k\">def</span> <span class=\"nf\">test_read_file</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">monkeypatch</span><span class=\"p\">):</span>\n    <span class=\"n\">monkeypatch</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nf\">setattr</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">mp_test</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"n\">utils</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"sh\">\"</span><span class=\"s\">Path</span><span class=\"sh\">\"</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"k\">lambda</span> <span class=\"n\">x</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"nf\">print</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">x</span><span class=\"p\">))</span>\n    <span class=\"n\">value</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"nf\">read_file</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"sh\">'</span><span class=\"s\">test_file</span><span class=\"sh\">'</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n</code></pre>\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>This code leads to some progress ... a different error message.<br>\n</p>\n\n<div class=\"highlight js-code-highlight\">\n<pre class=\"highlight plaintext\"><code># pytest output\n--------------------- Captured stdout call ------------------\ntest_file_foo\n========== short test summary info ================\nFAILED testing.py::test_read_file - AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'open'\n</code></pre>\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>This error is also to be expected because we replaced <code>Path</code> with the <code>print</code> function.

Instead of writing unit tests like this, I would not have written <code>create_file</code> like this to begin with. Instead, I took it, because it is an easy to understand example.</p>\n\n<p>Usually, I try to avoid having functions that mix logic - determining the name, processing the content - with the code that gets data from an interface. Instead, I like putting all logic into isolated functions that take \"primitive\" Python data types as input. This makes testing really easy.</p>\n\n<p>But there is a middle ground between those two extremes and that would be using abstraction.</p>\n\n<p>For example, one could do the following thing in <code>utils.py</code><br>\n</p>\n\n<div class=\"highlight js-code-highlight\">\n<pre class=\"highlight python\"><code><span class=\"c1\"># utils.py\n</span><span class=\"kn\">from</span> <span class=\"n\">pathlib</span> <span class=\"kn\">import</span> <span class=\"n\">Path</span>\n\n<span class=\"k\">class</span> <span class=\"nc\">Reader</span><span class=\"p\">:</span>\n    <span class=\"k\">def</span> <span class=\"nf\">__init__</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">self</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"n\">path</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"n\">mode</span><span class=\"p\">):</span>\n        <span class=\"n\">self</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"n\">path</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"n\">path</span>\n        <span class=\"n\">self</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"n\">mode</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"n\">mode</span>\n\n    <span class=\"k\">def</span> <span class=\"nf\">__enter__</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">self</span><span class=\"p\">):</span>\n        <span class=\"n\">self</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"n\">stream</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"nc\">Path</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">self</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"n\">path</span><span class=\"p\">).</span><span class=\"nf\">open</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">self</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"n\">mode</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n        <span class=\"k\">return</span> <span class=\"n\">self</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"n\">stream</span>\n\n    <span class=\"k\">def</span> <span class=\"nf\">__exit__</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">self</span><span class=\"p\">):</span>\n        <span class=\"n\">self</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"n\">stream</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nf\">close</span><span class=\"p\">()</span>\n\n<span class=\"k\">class</span> <span class=\"nc\">ReaderContext</span><span class=\"p\">:</span>\n    <span class=\"k\">def</span> <span class=\"nf\">__init__</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">self</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"n\">path</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"nb\">str</span><span class=\"p\">):</span>\n        <span class=\"n\">self</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"n\">path</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"nc\">Path</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">path</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n\n    <span class=\"k\">def</span> <span class=\"nf\">open</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">self</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"n\">mode</span><span class=\"p\">):</span>\n        <span class=\"k\">return</span> <span class=\"nc\">Reader</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">self</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"n\">path</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"n\">mode</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n\n\n<span class=\"k\">def</span> <span class=\"nf\">read_file</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">name</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"nb\">str</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"n\">context</span><span class=\"p\">):</span>\n    <span class=\"n\">complete_name</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"n\">name</span> <span class=\"o\">+</span> <span class=\"sh\">\"</span><span class=\"s\">_foo</span><span class=\"sh\">\"</span>\n    <span class=\"n\">ctx</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"nf\">context</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">complete_name</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n    <span class=\"k\">with</span> <span class=\"n\">ctx</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nf\">open</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"sh\">'</span><span class=\"s\">r</span><span class=\"sh\">'</span><span class=\"p\">)</span> <span class=\"k\">as</span> <span class=\"nb\">file</span><span class=\"p\">:</span>\n        <span class=\"n\">content</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"nb\">file</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nf\">read</span><span class=\"p\">()</span>\n\n    <span class=\"k\">return</span> <span class=\"nf\">len</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">content</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n</code></pre>\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>Some things have changed here. Let's take a closer look.</p>\n\n<p>The biggest change is that we now have two classes <code>Reader</code> and <code>ReaderContext</code>. </p>\n\n<p>The naming is questionable, I know, please ignore that for now and focus on what is happening. The <code>ReaderContext</code> is just a wrapper around the <code>Reader</code>class which is again a wrapper around <code>Path.open</code>. Also note that the signature of the <code>read_file</code> function has changed. A context is now passed in which is called.</p>\n\n<p>All in all, this should seem familiar to you because it is very similar to the setup of our Mock objects. <br>\nThese objects already where an abstraction of the functionality that we need to execute <code>read_file</code>. In the code above we are only wrapping the <code>Path.open</code> method in this abstraction.</p>\n\n<p>Now we can also simplify our test, because we no longer need to mock anything. Instead we can pass our mock classes directly to <code>read_file</code>:<br>\n</p>\n\n<div class=\"highlight js-code-highlight\">\n<pre class=\"highlight python\"><code><span class=\"c1\"># testing.py\n</span><span class=\"k\">def</span> <span class=\"nf\">test_read_file</span><span class=\"p\">():</span>\n    <span class=\"n\">value</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"nf\">read_file</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"sh\">'</span><span class=\"s\">test_file</span><span class=\"sh\">'</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"n\">MockPath</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n    <span class=\"k\">assert</span> <span class=\"n\">value</span> <span class=\"o\">==</span> <span class=\"mi\">13</span>\n    <span class=\"k\">assert</span> <span class=\"sh\">'</span><span class=\"s\">test_file_foo</span><span class=\"sh\">'</span> <span class=\"o\">==</span> <span class=\"n\">MockPath</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"n\">paths</span><span class=\"p\">[</span><span class=\"mi\">0</span><span class=\"p\">]</span>\n</code></pre>\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>One last comment, the code could probably be simplified to the point where only one class is needed instead of two, but I intentionally mirrored what was already there in the test. So it is easier to understand. Feel free to simplify the code yourself as an exercise. </p>\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  Next steps\n</h2>\n\n<p>There is one benefit that the more complex implementation brings with it and that is the fact that we are now in a position where we could write other <code>Reader</code> and <code>ReaderContext</code> classes that can handle different data sources.</p>\n\n<p>It would be cleaner to define <a href=\"https://docs.python.org/3/library/abc.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">abstract base classes</a> for both and derive every other class from those. But this is outside of the scope of what I wanted to achieve with this article, so I will leave that for another time.</p>\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  Conclusion\n</h2>\n\n<p>I hope that you found this short introduction to monkey-patching in your tests helpful. The focus was to touch upon different concepts without going too deep on any on them.</p>\n\n<p>Feedback is always appreciated and let me know whether you would like to read more about certain topics in the future.</p>\n\n","contentLength":0,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Building an Uncensored Multi-Agent AI Debate System locally with Ollama: A Step-by-Step Guide with full code.","url":"https://dev.to/k2wispp/building-an-uncensored-multi-agent-ai-debate-system-locally-with-ollama-a-step-by-step-guide-with-46nf","date":1750100606,"author":"kishore","guid":157528,"unread":true,"content":"<blockquote>\n<p>“What if AI agents could debate like real humans — structured, timed, and even judged?” That’s the crazy thought that sparked this project.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In an era where artificial intelligence increasingly shapes our daily lives, the potential of AI to simulate human-like interactions is remarkable. Imagine a world where AI doesn't just assist us but engages in vibrant debates, presenting arguments from distinct perspectives, much like a spirited discussion in a university lecture hall. Welcome to the world of multi-agent AI debates! In this guide, we’ll explore how to construct a robust Multi-Agent AI Debate System using Ollama’s local LLMs, effortlessly simulating structured debates on complex topics.</p>\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  Our Vision: A Virtual Arena for Ideas\n</h2>\n\n<p>At the heart of our project is the desire to create a platform where ideas clash, flourish, and ultimately shape our understanding of critical issues. The hallmark of an Oxford-style debate is its structured approach and respect for differing viewpoints. To this end, our system will feature:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Affirmative Agents:</strong> These entities take a stand in favor of a designated topic.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Negative Agents:</strong> Tasked with opposing the affirmative position, these agents challenge and question.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Judge Agent:</strong> Bringing a sense of closure, this agent summarizes the debate and provides critical insights.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Debate Orchestrator:</strong> This acts as the moderator, guiding the flow of the debate and ensuring a balanced discussion.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Debate State:</strong> A repository of the entire debate history used for reference and analysis.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  The Debate Topic: A Case Study\n</h2>\n\n<p>We’ve chosen the thought-provoking topic: <strong>“Should autonomous vehicles be implemented on a large scale within the next decade?”</strong> This subject invites a myriad of perspectives, from technological advancements and safety concerns to ethical considerations and societal impact. Imagine the diverse narratives that could unfold through this debate, with our AI agents simulating the reasoning of human debaters, each with their arguments, rebuttals, and analyses.</p>\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  Project Setup: Preparing for the Fight\n</h2>\n\n<p>Full code: <a href=\"https://github.com/kishore2494/Uncensored-Multi-Agent-AI-Debate-System\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">here</a><br>\nMedium: <a href=\"https://medium.com/ai-simplified-in-plain-english/building-an-uncensored-multi-agent-ai-debate-system-locally-with-ollama-a-guide-with-full-code-359c7b85bd68\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Here</a></p>\n\n<p>The journey begins with essential preparations.

Could they reason, argue, and persuade like humans? Inspired by college debates where articulate students dissect every angle of an issue, we wondered if we could harness the power of AI to do the same. This project transformed into a modular system not just for entertainment or experimentation, but as a potential educational tool for teaching structured reasoning and critical thinking.</p>\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  Future Aspirations: Expanding the Boundaries\n</h2>\n\n<p>This project is just the tip of the iceberg. The potential for applications is vast:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Evaluating Legal Arguments: Imagine using this format to simulate court cases, providing legal students with a virtual courtroom experience.</li>\n<li>Political Debates: AI agents could mimic real political figures, allowing users to explore political ideologies in depth.</li>\n<li>Educational Tools: The system could serve as a teaching aid for reasoning and debate structures in schools.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  Final Thoughts\n</h2>\n\n<p>Our multi-agent debate system illustrates how structured prompting, few-shot examples, and strategic orchestration can elevate AI beyond mere chatbots into dynamic systems capable of complex reasoning. The excitement of bringing together different perspectives creates a rich learning environment not just for humans but for AI too.</p>\n\n<p>Medium:<a href=\"https://medium.com/ai-simplified-in-plain-english/building-an-uncensored-multi-agent-ai-debate-system-locally-with-ollama-a-guide-with-full-code-359c7b85bd68\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Here</a></p>\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  Want to Extend It?\n</h2>\n\n<p>If you’re eager for more, consider:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Incorporating emotional scoring for arguments to add depth to debates.</li>\n<li>Exploring varying AI models for each character to diversify perspectives.</li>\n<li>Adding a graphical user interface for real-time engagement and visualization of the debate.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  Bonus: Your First Debate Awaits\n</h2>\n\n<p>Take a step back and witness your AI agents engaging in a lively debate. Whether you are seeking entertainment or a deeper understanding of structured reasoning, this project has something to offer.</p>\n\n<p>If you enjoyed this journey, share your debates, your results, and let’s continue to explore the frontier of AI together — one passionate argument at a time!</p>\n\n","contentLength":0,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"First Star on My Repo.

I've found its simplicity and extensive libraries make it ideal for sensor integration and device control. Let me share practical techniques that have proven reliable across my IoT deployments.</p>\n\n<p>Controlling GPIO pins forms the foundation of hardware interaction. On Raspberry Pi or similar boards, libraries like gpiozero abstract complex operations into intuitive interfaces. I remember setting up a motion-activated light system for a client's warehouse using just a few lines of code. The beauty lies in how these libraries handle underlying complexities:<br>\n</p>\n\n<div class=\"highlight js-code-highlight\">\n<pre class=\"highlight python\"><code><span class=\"kn\">from</span> <span class=\"n\">gpiozero</span> <span class=\"kn\">import</span> <span class=\"n\">MotionSensor</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"n\">LED</span>\n<span class=\"kn\">import</span> <span class=\"n\">time</span>\n\n<span class=\"n\">sensor</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"nc\">MotionSensor</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"mi\">21</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n<span class=\"n\">relay</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"nc\">LED</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"mi\">12</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n\n<span class=\"k\">def</span> <span class=\"nf\">activate_security</span><span class=\"p\">():</span>\n    <span class=\"n\">relay</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nf\">on</span><span class=\"p\">()</span>\n    <span class=\"nf\">log_event</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"sh\">\"</span><span class=\"s\">Motion detected - lights activated</span><span class=\"sh\">\"</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n    <span class=\"n\">time</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nf\">sleep</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"mi\">30</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n    <span class=\"n\">relay</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nf\">off</span><span class=\"p\">()</span>\n\n<span class=\"n\">sensor</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"n\">when_motion</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"n\">activate_security</span>\n</code></pre>\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>This event-driven approach efficiently manages hardware resources while responding instantly to physical changes. For industrial applications, I often add debounce logic to prevent false triggers from electrical noise.</p>\n\n<p>Communicating with I2C and SPI devices expands your sensor capabilities. These protocols connect multiple peripherals using minimal pins. When working with environmental sensors, I prefer the smbus2 library for its reliability. Here's how I handle a BME280 sensor measuring temperature, humidity, and pressure:<br>\n</p>\n\n<div class=\"highlight js-code-highlight\">\n<pre class=\"highlight python\"><code><span class=\"kn\">from</span> <span class=\"n\">smbus2</span> <span class=\"kn\">import</span> <span class=\"n\">SMBus</span>\n<span class=\"kn\">import</span> <span class=\"n\">bme280</span>\n\n<span class=\"n\">port</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"mi\">1</span>\n<span class=\"n\">address</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"mh\">0x76</span>\n<span class=\"n\">bus</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"nc\">SMBus</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">port</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n\n<span class=\"n\">calibration_params</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"n\">bme280</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nf\">load_calibration_params</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">bus</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"n\">address</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n\n<span class=\"k\">def</span> <span class=\"nf\">read_climate</span><span class=\"p\">():</span>\n    <span class=\"n\">data</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"n\">bme280</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nf\">sample</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">bus</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"n\">address</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"n\">calibration_params</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n    <span class=\"k\">return</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span>\n        <span class=\"sh\">'</span><span class=\"s\">temp</span><span class=\"sh\">'</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"nf\">round</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">data</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"n\">temperature</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"mi\">1</span><span class=\"p\">),</span>\n        <span class=\"sh\">'</span><span class=\"s\">hum</span><span class=\"sh\">'</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"nf\">round</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">data</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"n\">humidity</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"mi\">1</span><span class=\"p\">),</span>\n        <span class=\"sh\">'</span><span class=\"s\">press</span><span class=\"sh\">'</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"nf\">round</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">data</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"n\">pressure</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"mi\">1</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n    <span class=\"p\">}</span>\n\n<span class=\"c1\"># Returns {'temp': 23.5, 'hum': 45.2, 'press': 1013.2}\n</span></code></pre>\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>Sensor calibration is crucial here. I always perform baseline measurements before deployment.

You can either directly reference them in your prompt by adding <code>#getPythonEnvironmentInfo</code> and , or agent mode will automatically call the tool as applicable based on your prompt. These tools seamlessly detect appropriate environment information, based on file or workspace context, and handle package installation with accurate environment resolution.</p><p>The “Configure Python Environment” tool ensures that the Python environment is set up correctly for the workspace. This includes creating a virtual environment if needed, and selecting it as the active Python environment for your workspace.</p><p>Tools that were previously introduced in the Python Environments extension (preview) have been migrated to the Python extension, thereby making these tools available to all users with the Python extension installed.</p><p>Language server completions are now available in the terminal for interactive Python REPL sessions. This brings the same language completions you receive in the editor, now inside the terminal making terminal interactions more efficient.</p><p>To try it out, ensure the following settings are enabled:</p><ul><li><code>setting(terminal.integrated.shellIntegration.enabled:true)</code></li><li><code>setting(python.terminal.shellIntegration.enabled:true)</code></li><li><code>setting(terminal.integrated.suggest.enabled:true)</code></li><li><code>setting(python.analysis.supportAllPythonDocuments:true)</code></li></ul><p>The <a href=\"https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.vscode-python-envs\">Python Environments extension</a> (preview) now supports project creation for Python packages and basic scripts, allowing you to bypass scaffolding and get coding more quickly. Use the <strong>Python Envs: Create Project from Template</strong> command in the Command Palette to select whether you want to create a package or a script and let the command handle the rest!</p><p>For package creation, you can expect to name the package, create a virtual environment, and receive a scaffolded project which includes a tests subfolder, , , and boilerplate  and  files.</p><p>For scripts, a new Python file with the name of your choice and boilerplate code will be created.</p><p>We added support for pyenv for environment management, and poetry for both package and environment management in the Python Environments extension. This ensures you can manage pyenv and poetry environments as your normally would in the support UI contributed by the Python Environments extension. When pyenv or poetry are installed on your machine, they will appear as support environment managers in the Python panel accessed in the Activity Bar.</p><p>We’re starting to roll-out the <a href=\"https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.vscode-python-envs\">Python Environments extension</a> as an optional dependency with the Python extension beginning with a subset of pre-release users this month. What this means is you may now begin seeing the Python Environments extension automatically installed along side the Python extension, similar to the Python Debugger and Pylance extensions. This controlled rollout allows us to gather early feedback and ensure reliability before general availability. The Python Environments extension includes all the core capabilities we’ve introduced so far including: Quick Create for <a href=\"https://devblogs.microsoft.com/python/python-in-visual-studio-code-may-2025-release/#python-environments-quick-create-command\">one-click environment setup using Quick Create</a>, <a href=\"https://devblogs.microsoft.com/python/python-in-visual-studio-code-may-2025-release/#automatic-environment-activation-with-python-environments-(experimental)\">automatic terminal activation</a> (via <code>\"python-envs.terminal.autoActivationType\"</code> setting), and all supported <a href=\"https://devblogs.microsoft.com/python/python-in-visual-studio-code-december-2024-release/\">UI for environment an package management</a>.</p><p>You can install the preview version of the Python Environments extension from the Extension Marketplace if you would like to try it out. Please let us know if there are any issues or feature requests via our <a href=\"https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-python-environments\">vscode-python-environments</a> repo.</p><h2>We would also

Traditional approaches involve:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Manual searching across multiple retailers</li>\n<li>Copy-pasting prices into spreadsheets\n</li>\n<li>Inconsistent data formats</li>\n<li>No confidence scoring</li>\n<li>Time-consuming manual analysis</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>What if we could automate this entire process with AI?</strong></p>\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  🏗️ Solution Architecture\n</h2>\n\n<p>I designed a simple yet powerful 3-stage workflow using <strong>LangGraph</strong> as the orchestration framework.</p>\n\n<h3>\n  \n  \n  Why LangGraph?\n</h3>\n\n<p>LangGraph excels at building <strong>stateful, multi-step AI workflows</strong>. Unlike simple LLM chains, it provides:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>State management</strong> between nodes</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Error handling</strong> at each stage</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Conditional routing</strong> based on results</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Easy testing</strong> of individual components</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  🛠️ Tech Stack\n</h2>\n\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>🧠 LangGraph</strong>: Workflow orchestration</li>\n<li>\n<strong>🌐 Bright Data</strong>: Web scraping with MCP integration</li>\n<li>\n<strong>🤖 Google Gemini</strong>: LLM with structured outputs</li>\n<li>\n<strong>💬 Streamlit</strong>: Interactive chat interface</li>\n<li>\n<strong>🐍 Python</strong>: Core implementation language</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  📋 Implementation Deep Dive\n</h2>\n\n<h3>\n  \n  \n

Here's a simplified roadmap based on the listing journey of viral tokens like PEPE:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p><strong>Build the Smart Contract</strong><br>\nWrite your token using Solidity on platforms like Hardhat, Remix, or Truffle. Include safeguards like anti-bot logic or capped supply to avoid inflation and exploitation.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Run a Security Audit</strong><br>\nBefore anything else, get your code audited. This step verifies your contract’s integrity and reassures users that the project is not a scam or honeypot.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Create Token Docs</strong><br>\nPut together a clear whitepaper and define your tokenomics—supply limits, transaction fees, deflation mechanics, use cases. Think of it as your token’s blueprint.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>List on <a href=\"https://dexifier.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Dexifier</a></strong><br>\nDexifier makes the listing process easy. You don’t need to beg centralized platforms. Just submit your token, pass basic checks, and you’re good to go. Optional DAO tools even allow community-driven listing approvals.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Launch Marketing Campaigns</strong><br>\nGet loud. Use Twitter, Telegram, meme contests, airdrops, and Discord channels to spark awareness. Pre-listing hype often determines a token’s momentum.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Go Live and Grow</strong><br>\nOnce live on <a href=\"https://dexifier.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Dexifier</a>, nurture your community.

You throw, and it lands somewhat close, but not quite in the center. To improve your aim, you need a way to measure how far off you are and adjust your throw accordingly. In the world of machine learning, this \"measuring how far off\" is done using a <strong>loss function</strong>, and the \"adjusting your throw\" is handled by <strong>optimization</strong>. These two concepts are the engines that drive the power of artificial intelligence, allowing computers to learn from data and make increasingly accurate predictions.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What are Loss Functions?</strong></p>\n\n<p>A loss function, also known as a cost function or error function, is a mathematical function that quantifies the difference between the predicted output of a machine learning model and the actual target value. Think of it as a scorecard that tells us how well our model is performing. The lower the score (the loss), the better the model's performance.</p>\n\n<p>For example, if we're building a model to predict house prices, the loss function might measure the difference between the price predicted by our model and the actual sale price of a house. A large difference means a high loss, indicating a poor prediction. A small difference means a low loss, signifying a more accurate prediction.</p>\n\n<p>Different types of problems call for different loss functions. Some common examples include:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Mean Squared Error (MSE):</strong>  Calculates the average of the squared differences between predicted and actual values.  This is commonly used for regression problems (predicting continuous values like house prices or temperatures).</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Mean Absolute Error (MAE):</strong> Calculates the average of the absolute differences between predicted and actual values.  It's less sensitive to outliers than MSE.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Binary Cross-Entropy:</strong> Used for binary classification problems (predicting one of two outcomes, like spam or not spam).  It measures the difference between the predicted probability and the actual outcome (0 or 1).</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Categorical Cross-Entropy:</strong>  An extension of binary cross-entropy used for multi-class classification problems (predicting one of multiple outcomes, like different types of fruits).</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>What is Optimization?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Optimization is the process of finding the best possible set of parameters for a machine learning model that minimizes the loss function. In our dart analogy, optimization is the process of adjusting your throw (parameters) to get closer to the bullseye (minimize the loss).</p>\n\n<p>This involves using various algorithms that iteratively adjust the model's parameters, gradually reducing the loss. Popular optimization algorithms include:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Gradient Descent:</strong>  A widely used algorithm that iteratively moves the parameters in the direction of the steepest descent of the loss function, like rolling a ball down a hill to find the lowest point.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD):</strong> A variation of gradient descent that uses only a small subset of the data at each iteration, making it faster for large datasets.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Adam:</strong>  A more sophisticated algorithm that adapts the learning rate for each parameter, often leading to faster convergence.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Significance and Applications</strong></p>\n\n<p>Loss functions and optimization are fundamental to almost every aspect of modern machine learning. They are crucial for:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Image Recognition:</strong>  Training models to identify objects, faces, and scenes in images.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Natural Language Processing (NLP):</strong>  Building chatbots, machine translation systems, and sentiment analysis tools.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Self-Driving Cars:</strong>  Training models to perceive their surroundings and make driving decisions.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Medical Diagnosis:</strong>  Developing models to detect diseases from medical images or patient data.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Financial Modeling:</strong>  Predicting stock prices, assessing risk, and detecting fraud.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The impact is transformative. Better optimization techniques lead to more accurate and efficient models, enabling breakthroughs in various fields.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Challenges and Ethical Considerations</strong></p>\n\n<p>While powerful, loss functions and optimization present challenges:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Overfitting:</strong>  Models can become overly specialized to the training data, performing poorly on unseen data.  Regularization techniques are employed to mitigate this.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Computational Cost:</strong>  Training complex models with large datasets can be computationally expensive and time-consuming.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Bias and Fairness:</strong>  If the training data is biased, the resulting model will likely be biased, leading to unfair or discriminatory outcomes.  Careful data curation and bias mitigation techniques are crucial.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Interpretability:</strong>  Understanding why a model makes a particular prediction can be difficult, especially for complex models.  This lack of transparency raises concerns about accountability and trust.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Conclusion:  A Continuous Pursuit of Perfection</strong></p>\n\n<p>Loss functions and optimization are the cornerstone of successful machine learning. They provide the framework for building intelligent systems that can learn from data and make increasingly accurate predictions. While challenges remain, ongoing research and development in these areas continue to push the boundaries of what's possible, leading to more sophisticated, efficient, and ethical AI systems. The pursuit of minimizing loss and optimizing performance is an ongoing journey, constantly refining our ability to build intelligent machines that benefit humanity.</p>\n\n","contentLength":0,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"How to Scrape Unlimited Google Maps Leads Using AI","url":"https://dev.to/kaymen99/how-to-scrape-unlimited-google-maps-leads-using-ai-4kem","date":1750076750,"author":"Aymen K","guid":157279,"unread":true,"content":"<p>Finding quality leads for your business is often expensive and time-consuming.

During my first look, I immediately noticed two clear options:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Having a subscription to a database provider like <strong>Apollo</strong> or <strong>Zoominfo</strong>, but for me this was too expensive as most of them charge $50-300/month</p></li>\n<li><p>The obvious second option is <strong>Manual research</strong> which is completely free but for a good outreach at scale, it's incredibly time-consuming</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>I made some research and found some good scrapers on Apify like <a href=\"https://apify.com/compass/google-maps-extractor\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Apify's Google Maps scrapers</a> or even <a href=\"https://apify.com/code_crafter/apollo-io-scraper\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Apollo Lead scraper</a> which offer a pay-per-use more affordable pricing model costing from $2-10 per 1000 results.</p>\n\n<p>This seemed good enough for me, but when I looked at the Apify Google Maps scraper, I noticed they were using a simple logic in the background - they get business details from the Google Maps API and then crawl each business details page to get more contact information. As I had experience with the Serper API, I thought why not try to build my own local business scraper tool.</p>\n\n<p>That's why I created this tool — to give you:</p>\n\n<p>🔹 <strong>Comprehensive data extraction</strong> - Not just names and addresses, but emails and social profiles too<br>\n🔹 <strong>Cost-efficiency</strong> - About $0.2 per 1000 leads (50x cheaper than alternatives!)<br>\n🔹 <strong>Full customization</strong> - Search any business type in any location<br>\n🔹 <strong>AI-powered enhancement</strong> - Uses LLMs to intelligently extract contact information or other business details<br>\n🔹 <strong>Ready-to-use format</strong> - Export directly to Excel for immediate use in your campaigns</p>\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  🛠️ How The Tool Works\n</h2>\n\n<p>Our lead generator follows a three-step process that combines traditional API calls with AI-powered data enrichment:</p>\n<h3>\n  \n  \n  1️⃣ Initial Data Collection\n</h3>\n\n<p>First, we use the Serper Maps API to collect basic

the Serper API requires specific longitude and latitude of the place we want to search for, so we can't directly provide a city name like \"New York\" for example. To get around this, we use the free Nominatim API which returns the coordinates of a place/city from its name. This is done using the <code>get_coordinates</code> function:<br>\n</p>\n\n<div class=\"highlight js-code-highlight\">\n<pre class=\"highlight python\"><code><span class=\"k\">def</span> <span class=\"nf\">get_coordinates</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">city</span><span class=\"p\">):</span>\n    <span class=\"sh\">\"\"\"</span><span class=\"s\">\n    Convert a city name to latitude and longitude coordinates.\n\n    Args:\n        city (str): Name of the city to geocode\n\n    Returns:\n        tuple: (latitude, longitude) if successful, (None, None) if not\n    </span><span class=\"sh\">\"\"\"</span>\n    <span class=\"k\">try</span><span class=\"p\">:</span>\n        <span class=\"n\">response</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"n\">requests</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nf\">get</span><span class=\"p\">(</span>\n            <span class=\"sh\">\"</span><span class=\"s\">https://nominatim.openstreetmap.org/search</span><span class=\"sh\">\"</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> \n            <span class=\"n\">params</span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"p\">{</span><span class=\"sh\">\"</span><span class=\"s\">q</span><span class=\"sh\">\"</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"n\">city</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"sh\">\"</span><span class=\"s\">format</span><span class=\"sh\">\"</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"sh\">\"</span><span class=\"s\">json</span><span class=\"sh\">\"</span><span class=\"p\">},</span> \n            <span class=\"n\">headers</span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"p\">{</span><span class=\"sh\">\"</span><span class=\"s\">User-Agent</span><span class=\"sh\">\"</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"n\">USER_AGENTS</span><span class=\"p\">[</span><span class=\"mi\">2</span><span class=\"p\">]}</span>\n        <span class=\"p\">)</span>\n        <span class=\"n\">data</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"n\">response</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nf\">json</span><span class=\"p\">()</span>\n        <span class=\"k\">if</span> <span class=\"n\">data</span><span class=\"p\">:</span>\n            <span class=\"k\">return</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span><span class=\"sh\">\"</span><span class=\"s\">lat</span><span class=\"sh\">\"</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"n\">data</span><span class=\"p\">[</span><span class=\"mi\">0</span><span class=\"p\">][</span><span class=\"sh\">'</span><span class=\"s\">lat</span><span class=\"sh\">'</span><span class=\"p\">],</span> <span class=\"sh\">\"</span><span class=\"s\">lon</span><span class=\"sh\">\"</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"n\">data</span><span class=\"p\">[</span><span class=\"mi\">0</span><span class=\"p\">][</span><span class=\"sh\">'</span><span class=\"s\">lon</span><span class=\"sh\">'</span><span class=\"p\">]}</span>\n        <span class=\"k\">else</span><span class=\"p\">:</span>\n            <span class=\"k\">return</span> <span class=\"bp\">None</span>\n    <span class=\"k\">except</span> <span class=\"nb\">Exception</span> <span class=\"k\">as</span> <span class=\"n\">e</span><span class=\"p\">:</span>\n        <span class=\"nf\">print</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"sa\">f</span><span class=\"sh\">\"</span><span class=\"s\">Error getting coordinates: </span><span class=\"si\">{</span><span class=\"n\">e</span><span class=\"si\">}</span><span class=\"sh\">\"</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n        <span class=\"k\">return</span> <span class=\"bp\">None</span>\n</code></pre>\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>Up to this point We get the basic business data - name, address, phone number, website URL, and reviews.

Tip</strong></p>\n\n<p>Instead of providing the full scraped page content to the AI, we first use regex to extract all the page links and email addresses, then we instruct an AI agent to identify which are the correct social media and contact links, and which are the correct email addresses.</p>\n\n<p>This allows to save money on LLM calls and also to get more accurate results by avoiding hallucinations.</p>\n\n<p>For example, for the email extraction we use the following regex pattern to identify all email addresses within the page content:<br>\n</p>\n\n<div class=\"highlight

Who knew this oft-touted phrase was referring to Python bytecode?</p>\n\n<p>Last time we acted on learning <a href=\"https://fromscratchcode.com/blog/how-local-variables-work-in-python-bytecode/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">how local variables work</a>, today let’s think about how global variables might work.</p>\n\n<p>I came into my own bytecode journey assuming that a “global” was no different than a “local,” it was just at the outermost scope of a module. And boy, was I mistaken.</p>\n\n<p>While the VM isn’t even aware of a local variable’s name, just its index, the VM performs dynamic name resolution to resolve each global variable. <em>This is a key part of Python’s dynamism</em>.</p>\n\n<p>Once again, this post will discuss the mechanics of <a href=\"https://fromscratchcode.com/memphis/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Memphis</a>, my Python interpreter built in Rust. While it doesn’t match CPython 100%, the model is simple and maps closely to how most Python runtimes behave under the hood.</p>\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  Bytecode Compilation\n</h2>\n\n<p>Consider the following Python program.<br>\n</p>\n\n<div class=\"highlight js-code-highlight\">\n<pre class=\"highlight python\"><code><span class=\"c1\"># A global variable which we'll later reference inside our function\n</span><span class=\"n\">y</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"mi\">11</span>\n\n<span class=\"c1\"># A function which adds an unknown number (via global var) to the input\n# parameter x, returning the result.\n</span><span class=\"k\">def</span> <span class=\"nf\">add_useless</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">x</span><span class=\"p\">):</span>\n    <span class=\"k\">return</span> <span class=\"n\">x</span> <span class=\"o\">+</span> <span class=\"n\">y</span>\n</code></pre>\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>Here is the bytecode for our function, <code>add_useless</code>:<br>\n</p>\n\n<div class=\"highlight js-code-highlight\">\n<pre class=\"highlight plaintext\"><code>LOAD_FAST    0 (x)\nLOAD_GLOBAL  0 (y)\nADD\nRETURN_VALUE\n</code></pre>\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>Our <code>CodeObject</code> looks like the one below. Again, pardon my pseudo-Rust syntax!<br>\n</p>\n\n<div class=\"highlight js-code-highlight\">\n<pre class=\"highlight plaintext\"><code>CodeObject {\n  name: \"add_useless\",\n  varnames: [\"x\"], // names of each local accessed by the function\n  names: [\"y\"], // names of each global accessed by the function\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>We don’t see a constant of 11 here because this code object is specific to our <code>add_useless</code> function. The function will have to look up that value at runtime via the global store, since it isn’t embedded in the code object itself.</p>\n\n<p>If you haven’t read <a href=\"https://fromscratchcode.com/blog/how-local-variables-work-in-python-bytecode/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">the previous post</a>, I’d encourage you to pause here and give it a read. It walks through the evaluation stack step-by-step and shows how the <code>ADD</code> operation gets its two operands off the stack.</p>\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  VM Execution\n</h2>\n\n<p>What we’re interested in today is what, exactly, <code>LOAD_GLOBAL</code> is doing. First, let’s define a runtime concept I blew past earlier.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Global Store</strong>: a mapping from a variable name to an object reference. The object being referenced lives on the heap. This is roughly what you get when you call <code>globals()</code> in Python or CPython.</p>\n\n<p>Let’s see what happens when the VM begins executing the bytecode. Like last time, we’ll ignore how the bytecode actually enters the function.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>\n<code>LOAD_FAST 0</code> means: read from slot 0 on the frame’s execution stack.</li>\n<li>\n<code>LOAD_GLOBAL 0</code> means: look up the identifier in <code>names</code> at index 0. It finds <code>y</code>, then goes to the global store to look for the key <code>y</code>, where it finds an object reference to the value of 11.</li>\n<li>The remaining instructions, <code>ADD</code> and <code>RETURN_VALUE</code>, work just as they did in the previous post: the VM pops two operands off the stack, computes the result, and returns it.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>You may have noticed: global variables don’t need to be defined when the function is defined, only when it is called. If <code>y</code> doesn’t exist at function call time, a <code>NameError</code> will be thrown. This differs from local variables, which must exist at the time they are first referenced. Otherwise, the bytecode compiler will assume you are referring to a global with that same name.</p>\n\n<p>See how there is an extra level of indirection when resolving the global compared to the local? This is key to Python’s dynamism. Here’s an example to illustrate this.<br>\n</p>\n\n<div class=\"highlight js-code-highlight\">\n<pre class=\"highlight python\"><code><span class=\"n\">y</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"mi\">11</span>\n\n<span class=\"k\">def</span> <span class=\"nf\">add_useless</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">x</span><span class=\"p\">):</span>\n    <span class=\"k\">return</span> <span class=\"n\">x</span> <span class=\"o\">+</span> <span class=\"n\">y</span>\n\n<span class=\"nf\">print</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nf\">add_useless</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"mi\">9</span><span class=\"p\">))</span> <span class=\"c1\"># prints 20\n</span>\n<span class=\"n\">y</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"mi\">1</span>\n\n<span class=\"nf\">print</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nf\">add_useless</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"mi\">9</span><span class=\"p\">))</span> <span class=\"c1\"># prints 10\n</span></code></pre>\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>This example highlights the perils of impure functions, but otherwise might not seem that surprising at first.</p>\n\n<p>Before we continue, it’s worth mentioning that the global store is specific to the module, while the heap is shared across modules. This means that multiple modules can have a global named <code>y</code>, which matches what we expect as users. Imagine having to know if every other module in your project, including those from third-party libraries, had previously used a global identifier? That would be a nightmare!</p>\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  Global Store Mutations\n</h2>\n\n<p>To further illustrate how globals can be modified, let’s consider two more examples. These below move away from my Memphis implementation and focus on how dynamic global behavior shows up in CPython.<br>\n</p>\n\n<div class=\"highlight js-code-highlight\">\n<pre class=\"highlight python\"><code><span class=\"n\">a</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"sh\">\"</span><span class=\"s\">First</span><span class=\"sh\">\"</span>\n<span class=\"nf\">globals</span><span class=\"p\">()[</span><span class=\"sh\">'</span><span class=\"s\">a</span><span class=\"sh\">'</span><span class=\"p\">]</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"sh\">\"</span><span class=\"s\">Second</span><span class=\"sh\">\"</span>\n<span class=\"nf\">print</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">a</span><span class=\"p\">)</span> <span class=\"c1\"># prints \"Second\" \n</span></code></pre>\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>This one accomplishes something similar to the previous example (reassigning a global), but by mutating the global store directly via <code>globals()</code>. We see here that <code>a</code> doesn’t point to a fixed memory location, but is resolved dynamically by name at runtime.</p>\n\n<p>To take it one step further, consider the same idea applied across modules. We’ll also reassign a function rather than an integer.<br>\n</p>\n\n<div class=\"highlight js-code-highlight\">\n<pre class=\"highlight python\"><code><span class=\"c1\"># main.py\n</span><span class=\"kn\">import</span> <span class=\"n\">other</span>\n\n<span class=\"k\">def</span> <span class=\"nf\">monkey_patch_foo</span><span class=\"p\">():</span>\n    <span class=\"nf\">print</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"sh\">\"</span><span class=\"s\">Got ya!</span><span class=\"sh\">\"</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n\n<span class=\"n\">other</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"n\">foo</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"n\">monkey_patch_foo</span>\n<span class=\"n\">other</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nf\">bar</span><span class=\"p\">()</span> <span class=\"c1\"># prints \"Got ya!\"\n</span>\n<span class=\"c1\"># other.py\n</span><span class=\"k\">def</span> <span class=\"nf\">foo</span><span class=\"p\">():</span>\n    <span class=\"nf\">print</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"sh\">\"</span><span class=\"s\">I am foo.</span><span class=\"sh\">\"</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n\n<span class=\"k\">def</span> <span class=\"nf\">bar</span><span class=\"p\">():</span>\n    <span class=\"nf\">foo</span><span class=\"p\">()</span>\n</code></pre>\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>Our <code>main</code> module modifies the behavior of a function defined in an<code>other</code> module, and that change affects the <code>other</code> module itself. Said another way: you can change the behavior of code from the outside, and <em>the function itself doesn’t know</em>.</p>\n\n<p>This is referred to as monkey patching and is one of the most mind-bending things about Python. Monkey patching is often used to inject patch fixes or replace functionality at runtime. And it’s only possible because of Python’s dynamic name resolution for global variables.</p>\n\n<p>To be transparent, Memphis doesn’t fully support this yet! I'm still working through object mutability and shared references, and how these vary across my treewalk implementation and bytecode VM. Monkey patching: WIP.</p>\n\n<p>You might wonder why Python treats locals and globals so differently in bytecode.</p>\n\n<p>The reason is to balance performance and flexibility. Functions are called frequently during the lifetime of a program, its locals are accessed often, so Python optimizes for speed using slot-based indexing. At the module level, the dynamic name resolution introduces a performance hit, but the language is more dynamic as a result.</p>\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  The End\n</h2>\n\n<p>I didn’t fully appreciate this design until I implemented it myself. You really start to see how much of Python’s feel comes from how its variables are resolved in bytecode.</p>\n\n<p>If you’re curious to explore more, I recommend trying out the <a href=\"https://docs.python.org/3/library/dis.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">dis module</a> to inspect your own functions! It’ll be confusing at first, but you may begin to pick up one new tidbit each time.</p>\n\n<p>Now that we’ve tackled <a href=\"https://fromscratchcode.com/blog/how-local-variables-work-in-python-bytecode/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">locals</a> and globals, we’re free to think about free variables next!

A developer might use Django to build a corporate website in the morning, analyze user data with Pandas and Scikit-learn in the afternoon, and maintain a Scrapy crawler at night. This raises a question: How can you switch smoothly between these vastly different projects without wasting precious time on environment configuration?</p>\n\n<p>The traditional path—venv/Conda + Docker—is powerful but introduces its own complexities: tedious command-line operations, maintaining different docker-compose.yml files for each project, and the significant resource footprint of Docker itself. All of these can become obstacles to productivity.</p>\n\n<p>This has given rise to a new class of solutions: integrated <a href=\"https://www.servbay.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">local dev environments</a>. Tools like MAMP and ServBay, for instance, offer a completely different approach. They don't aim to replace Docker but provide a more lightweight and intuitive option for many day-to-day development scenarios.</p>\n\n<p>The core advantage of such tools lies in deep integration and simplification:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Painless <a href=\"https://www.servbay.com/features/python\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Multi-Version Python Management</a></strong>: Install multiple versions like Python 2.7, 3.8, 3.10, and 3.12 with a single click and run them concurrently. Enabling the latest Python version for a new project (like FastAPI) or specifying an older version for a legacy project (like an old Django site) is just a matter of selecting from a dropdown menu. This completely eliminates the command-line hassles of pyenv or conda.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2F1wesb77ucglvhm3ucr0k.png\" class=\"article-body-image-wrapper\"><img src=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2F1wesb77ucglvhm3ucr0k.png\" alt=\"Image description\" width=\"800\" height=\"495\"></a></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>\"Plug-and-Play\" Service Stack</strong>: Starting a web project no longer requires writing a docker-compose file to orchestrate databases and caches. In ServBay's panel, you can start or stop services like MariaDB, PostgreSQL, Redis, and Memcached with a simple click. These services run natively with high performance and can be seamlessly accessed by all your Python projects, drastically lowering the barrier and time cost to start a project.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Smooth Transition from Development to a \"Near-Production\" Environment</strong>: Taking it a step further, these tools often integrate web servers like Nginx or Caddy. You can easily configure local domain names (e.g., my-api.test) and automatically issued SSL certificates for your local projects. This allows you to simulate a highly realistic production-like environment locally, helping you identify and solve deployment issues early on.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Its fundamental philosophy is to free developers from the complexities of \"infrastructure management\" and allow them to return to what matters most: \"creating business logic.\" By providing a unified \"control tower,\" it integrates a series of isolated operations—like managing Python versions, databases, and web servers—into a single, coherent, and smooth workflow. This \"one-stop\" model is the critical glue that efficiently translates the potential of Python's diverse ecosystem into real productivity.</p>\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  Conclusion: Achieving Both Breadth and Efficiency\n</h2>\n\n<p>Mastering the breadth of the Python ecosystem makes you a more well-rounded and competitive developer. And having an efficient, unified development environment is the catalyst that transforms that breadth into actual productivity.</p>\n\n<p>Therefore, as you strive to explore different Python frameworks, also invest time in building or choosing a development environment that streamlines your workflow. Because, after all, tools exist to serve creation, and the best tool is the one you don't even notice.</p>\n\n","contentLength":0,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"How AI and Machine Learning Are Revolutionizing Emergency Care?","url":"https://dev.to/visonaryvoguesmagazine/how-ai-and-machine-learning-are-revolutionizing-emergency-care-2g65","date":1750065453,"author":"visionary vogues magazine","guid":157145,"unread":true,"content":"<p>How AI and Machine Learning Are Revolutionizing Emergency Care?</p>\n\n<p>Healthcare is a challenging and complex sphere for those in the emergency care sector niche. <a href=\"https://www.visionaryvogues.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Artificial intelligence (AI)</a> &amp; Machine Learning (ML) have been emerging in the arena of healthcare to disrupt the conventional methods of giving patient care. This integration of AI in emergency nursing can significantly transform patient treatment &amp; be life-saving, which was not possible a decade ago. The promise of AI in improving emergency healthcare practices and patient care is clear, yet the identified challenges must be carefully navigated to promote safe and ethical use</p>\n\n<p>According to a report by Accenture, AI applications in healthcare could save the industry $150 billion annually by 2026. Additionally, a study published in Nature Medicine found that machine learning algorithms can diagnose medical conditions with an accuracy rate of over 90%, surpassing human physicians in some cases.</p>\n\n<p>As AI-driven solutions become more integrated into emergency care, hospitals and healthcare providers must understand how these technologies can be leveraged to enhance efficiency and patient safety.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>AI-Powered Triage and Faster Diagnosis\nOne of the most time-sensitive aspects of emergency care is triage—the process of determining the severity of a patient's condition and prioritizing treatment accordingly. Traditionally, triage has relied on human judgment, but AI-powered triage systems are now being deployed to reduce human error and accelerate decision-making.\nKey Benefits:\nAI-driven chatbots and virtual assistants can assess symptoms before a patient even reaches the hospital, reducing congestion in emergency rooms.\nMachine learning algorithms analyze patient data in real time to predict critical conditions, such as strokes and heart attacks, before symptoms become life-threatening.\nAI systems like Viz.ai are already being used in hospitals to detect strokes with a 96% accuracy rate, ensuring patients receive immediate intervention.</li>\n<li>Predictive Analytics for Emergency Preparedness</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Hospitals often struggle with unexpected surges in emergency room visits. AI-powered predictive analytics can forecast patient inflows, allowing healthcare facilities to allocate resources more effectively.<br>\nHow It Works:<br>\nAI models analyze historical hospital data, patient demographics, and environmental factors (e.g., seasonal flu outbreaks and air pollution levels) to predict spikes in emergency care demand.<br>\nPredictive systems help reduce emergency room overcrowding, optimize staffing, and prevent shortages of essential medical supplies.<br>\nA study by the Mayo Clinic found that predictive models improved hospital readiness by 30%, leading to better patient outcomes and resource management.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>AI-Assisted Diagnostics and Imaging\nMedical imaging is a cornerstone of emergency care, especially for diagnosing conditions such as fractures, brain injuries, and internal bleeding. AI algorithms can analyze X-rays, MRIs, and CT scans faster and more accurately than human radiologists.\nNotable AI Developments:\nGoogle's DeepMind AI can detect eye diseases and lung cancer with a 95% accuracy rate, reducing the risk of misdiagnosis.\nAI-based imaging tools help detect intracranial hemorrhages in trauma patients within seconds, enabling faster surgical intervention.\nThe American College of Radiology reports that AI-powered radiology tools can improve diagnosis efficiency by up to 40%.</li>\n<li>Enhancing Ambulance Services with AI</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>AI is transforming not only hospitals but also pre-hospital emergency care. Ambulances equipped with AI-driven systems can optimize routes, predict patient conditions en route, and communicate with hospital teams for better preparedness.<br>\nAI Innovations in Ambulance Services:<br>\nSmart navigation systems use real-time traffic data to reduce ambulance arrival times by up to 25%.<br>\nWearable AI devices monitor paramedic vital signs to prevent fatigue-related errors in high-pressure environments.<br>\nAI-based communication tools allow EMTs to transmit real-time patient data to hospitals, ensuring a seamless transition upon arrival.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Reducing Administrative Burden in Emergency Departments\nEmergency rooms often suffer from administrative bottlenecks, causing delays in patient care. AI-driven automation helps reduce paperwork and streamline hospital workflows.\nAI-Driven Administrative Improvements:\nNatural Language Processing (NLP) tools transcribe and summarize doctor-patient conversations, cutting documentation time by 70%.\nAI chatbots assist in insurance verification and patient registration, minimizing wait times at check-in.\nAutomated billing systems reduce claim processing errors by analyzing insurance policies and patient records.</li>\n<li>Ethical Considerations and Challenges</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>While AI in emergency care offers significant benefits, its implementation comes with challenges:<br>\nData privacy concerns: AI systems require vast amounts of patient data, raising concerns about security and compliance with HIPAA regulations.<br>\nBias in AI algorithms: If training data lacks diversity, AI models may produce biased results, potentially leading to disparities in emergency treatment.<br>\nAcceptance by healthcare professionals: Some doctors and nurses are skeptical of AI’s decision-making abilities, emphasizing the need for human-AI collaboration rather than full automation.<br>\nConclusion<br>\nThe integration of AI and machine learning into emergency care is revolutionizing how hospitals and healthcare providers operate. From AI-assisted diagnostics and predictive analytics to smart ambulance navigation and administrative automation, these technologies are enhancing efficiency, improving patient outcomes, and reducing costs.</p>\n\n<p>However, as AI continues to evolve, healthcare leaders must address ethical considerations, data security, and workforce adoption to ensure a seamless transition. With the right balance of AI innovation and human expertise, emergency care can become more responsive, accurate, and life-saving than ever before.</p>\n\n<p>As businesses and healthcare organizations invest in AI-driven solutions, one thing is clear: The future of emergency care is being shaped by intelligent technology, and the potential for life-saving advancements is only just beginning.</p>\n\n<p>Uncover the latest trends and insights with our articles on Visionary Vogues</p>\n\n","contentLength":0,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Python Bytes: #436 Slow tests go last","url":"https://pythonbytes.fm/episodes/show/436/slow-tests-go-last","date":1750060800,"author":"","guid":157599,"unread":true,"content":"<article>&lt;strong&gt;Topics covered in this episode:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n\t&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;* Free-threaded Python no longer “experimental” as of Python 3.14&lt;/em&gt;*&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://github.com/livingbio/typed-ffmpeg?featured_on=pythonbytes\"&gt;typed-ffmpeg&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://github.com/deepankarm/pyleak?featured_on=pythonbytes\"&gt;pyleak&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;* &lt;a href=\"https://timonweb.com/django/optimizing-test-execution-running-live_server-tests-last-with-pytest/?featured_on=pythonbytes\"&gt;Optimizing Test Execution: Running live_server Tests Last with pytest&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;*&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Extras&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Joke&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n\n&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mt7X3Q54lU4' style='font-weight: bold;'data-umami-event=\"Livestream-Past\" data-umami-event-episode=\"436\"&gt;Watch on YouTube&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About the show&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sponsored by &lt;strong&gt;PropelAuth&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;a href=\"https://pythonbytes.fm/propelauth66\"&gt;pythonbytes.fm/propelauth66&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Connect with the hosts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Michael: &lt;a href=\"https://fosstodon.org/@mkennedy\"&gt;@mkennedy@fosstodon.org&lt;/a&gt; / &lt;a href=\"https://bsky.app/profile/mkennedy.codes?featured_on=pythonbytes\"&gt;@mkennedy.codes&lt;/a&gt; (bsky)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Brian: &lt;a href=\"https://fosstodon.org/@brianokken\"&gt;@brianokken@fosstodon.org&lt;/a&gt; / &lt;a href=\"https://bsky.app/profile/brianokken.bsky.social?featured_on=pythonbytes\"&gt;@brianokken.bsky.social&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Show: &lt;a href=\"https://fosstodon.org/@pythonbytes\"&gt;@pythonbytes@fosstodon.org&lt;/a&gt; / &lt;a href=\"https://bsky.app/profile/pythonbytes.fm\"&gt;@pythonbytes.fm&lt;/a&gt; (bsky)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Join us on YouTube at &lt;a href=\"https://pythonbytes.fm/stream/live\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;pythonbytes.fm/live&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to be part of the audience.

Thanks to Claude 4 and a powerful new open-source framework called <a href=\"https://www.trycua.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">C/ua</a>, that futuristic scenario is quickly becoming a reality.</p>\n\n<p>In this post, we’ll dive into how you can build your first <em>computer-use</em> and <em>iPhone-use</em> agent using Anthropic’s Claude 4. We’ll walk through what’s already possible, what’s still a bit experimental, and where this is all heading in the fast-evolving landscape of AI agent-based automation.</p>\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  What is C/ua?\n</h2>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.trycua.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">C/ua</a> is an emerging open-source framework designed to help you build agents that can directly interact with your computer and even your phone. Instead of limiting agents to just answering questions or managing text-based workflows, C/ua lets them operate applications, click buttons, type in fields and navigate apps just like a human would.</p>\n\n<p>It’s built to support a wide range of language models, including OpenAI, Claude by Anthropic, and a growing list of open-source LLMs. For this demo, I used Claude 4 because the setup was simpler and more reliable.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fxdlttmzdav3i2t42fy1h.png\" class=\"article-body-image-wrapper\"><img src=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fxdlttmzdav3i2t42fy1h.png\" alt=\"C/ua\" width=\"700\" height=\"467\"></a></p>\n\n<p><strong>Standout Features:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Native support for Claude API</p></li>\n<li><p>Experimental iPhone-use automation (currently in beta)</p></li>\n<li><p>MCP support</p></li>\n<li><p>Suite of tools to build and run AI Agents on Apple Silicon</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  Why I Decided to Try It\n</h2>\n\n<p>Over the past few months, I’ve experimented with a variety of agent frameworks like Agent Development Kit andAgno, most of which focus on search, summarization or Q&amp;A-style use cases. While those are useful, they don’t really simulate how a real user interacts with software. C/ua is the interesting tool I found that lets agents interact with a computer (and now mobile apps) just like we do.</p>\n\n<p>When I discovered its experimental support for iPhone interaction, actually launching apps, tapping through screens, and entering text. I had to try it out for myself.</p>\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  What I Built\n</h2>\n\n<p>Basic Desktop Computer-Use Agent. Using Claude 4 and C/ua, I built a desktop agent capable of:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Navigating websites via a browser</p></li>\n<li><p>Opening applications and performing clicks</p></li>\n<li><p>Typing into text fields and responding to basic prompts</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Setting it up was pretty straightforward. I did hit some rate limits with Claude’s API, which slowed things down a bit, but once up and running, the agent behavior felt very natural.</p>\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  Experimental iPhone-Use Agent\n</h2>\n\n<p>C/ua recently introduced early support for controlling iPhones, and I gave it a shot. While the feature is still under development and a bit unstable, it was able to:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Attempt app launches on iPhone</p></li>\n<li><p>Mimic basic touch interactions</p></li>\n<li><p>Showcase the potential for voice-less, hands-free mobile automation</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Although I encountered some errors (expected in a beta feature), the direction is clear: we’re moving toward agents that can operate across both desktop and mobile environments.</p>\n\n<p>Imagine the possibilities:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Booking an Uber or ordering food through voice-initiated agents</p></li>\n<li><p>Opening and editing notes, emails or reminders without touching your phone</p></li>\n<li><p>Automating repetitive mobile tasks while you focus on more important work</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  What I Learned\n</h2>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>Claude 4</strong> is very capable, but rate limits are real, expect to optimize or batch your requests.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>C/ua’s</strong> mobile support (app-use experimental) is promising but not production-ready. Still, it’s impressive how far it’s come.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Start simple</strong>: build basic desktop agents before jumping into mobile automation to better understand the framework and avoid early frustration.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  What’s Next\n</h2>\n\n<p>I plan to explore:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Integrating DeepSeek or OpenAI’s CUA models once setup hurdles are resolved</p></li>\n<li><p>Testing MCP</p></li>\n<li><p>Building long-running, persistent agents that can handle sequences of actions across devices or Virtual environments</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The C/ua is evolving rapidly. Its roadmap highlights upcoming support for new devices beyond macOS and Linux, including experimental iPhone control — as well as more robust error handling through sandboxed VM environments and richer integration with popular LLMs and orchestration tools. It leverages lightweight Docker containers with Apple’s Virtualization Framework to deliver near-native performance, and future releases promise smoother multi-computer workflows andenhanced architecture.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Curious how this works in practice? I recorded a full walkthrough video where I:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Compare Claude 4</p></li>\n<li><p>Set up 2 Computer Use Agent from scratch</p></li>\n<li><p>Test app-use with real app interactions on Mac</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Click <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KoO9Sha6SUY\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">here</a> to watch the video</p>\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  Final Thoughts\n</h2>\n\n<p>This was my first real project using Claude’s APIs and it left me optimistic. We’re no longer talking about AI as just a chatbot. With tools like C/ua, we’re looking at a near-future where agents can truly assist with real workflows, right inside your apps and devices.</p>\n\n<p>Sure, there are limitations. Rate limits, software updates, and model constraints all exist. But the ability to simulate user behavior — on both computers and phones — is a huge leap forward.</p>\n\n<p>If you’ve built something with Claude’s computer-use capabilities or are exploring agent automation on mobile or desktop, I’d love to hear your story.

Here’s how to get started:</p>\n\n<p>Step 1: Install Python<br>\nDownload Python: Visit the official Python website (python.org) and download the latest version of Python for your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux).<br>\nInstall Python: Follow the installation instructions, ensuring that you check the box to add Python to your system PATH. This will allow you to run Python from the command line.<br>\nStep 2: Choose an Integrated Development Environment (IDE)<br>\nWhile you can write Python code in any text editor, using an IDE can enhance your coding experience. Some popular IDEs for Python include:</p>\n\n<p>PyCharm: A powerful IDE with many features for professional developers.<br>\nVisual Studio Code: A lightweight and customizable code editor with excellent Python support.<br>\nJupyter Notebook: Ideal for data analysis and visualization, allowing you to create interactive notebooks.<br>\nEssential Python Concepts for New Programmers<br>\nNow that you have your environment set up, let’s explore some essential concepts that every new Python programmer should understand.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Variables and Data Types\nIn Python, variables are used to store data. You can create a variable by simply assigning a value to it:</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>name = \"Alice\"<br>\nage = 30</p>\n\n<p>Python supports several data types, including:</p>\n\n<p>Strings: Text data enclosed in quotes (e.g., \"Hello, World!\").<br>\nIntegers: Whole numbers (e.g., 42).<br>\nFloats: Decimal numbers (e.g., 3.14).<br>\nBooleans: True or false values (True or False).</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Control Structures\nControl structures allow you to dictate the flow of your program. The most common control structures in Python are:</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Conditional Statements: Use if, elif, and else to execute code based on certain conditions.</p>\n\n<p>if age &gt;= 18:<br>\nprint(\"You are an adult.\")<br>\n...<br>\nLoops: Use for and while loops to repeat actions.</p>\n\n<p>for i in range(5):<br>\nprint(i) # Prints numbers 0 to 4<br>\n...</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Functions\nFunctions are reusable blocks of code that perform a specific task. You can define a function using the def keyword:</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>def greet(name):<br>\nreturn f\"Hello, {name}!\"<br>\n...<br>\nFunctions help organize your code and make it more modular.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Data Structures\nPython provides several built-in data structures to store collections of data:</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Lists: Ordered, mutable collections of items.</p>\n\n<p>fruits = [\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\"]<br>\nTuples: Ordered, immutable collections of items.<br>\npython<br>\n1 lines<br>\nClick to expand<br>\ncoordinates = (10.0, 20.0)<br>\nDictionaries: Unordered collections of key-value pairs.</p>\n\n<p>person = {\"name\": \"Alice\", \"age\": 30}<br>\nSets: Unordered collections of unique items.</p>\n\n<p>unique_numbers = {1, 2, 3, 4}</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>File Handling\nPython makes it easy to work with files. You can read from and write to files using built-in functions:</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>**# Writing to a file<br>\n**with open(\"example.txt\", \"w\") as file:<br>\n...</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Error Handling\nAs you write code, errors are inevitable. Python provides a way to handle errors gracefully using try and except blocks:</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>try:<br>\nresult = 10 / 0<br>\n...<br>\nConclusion<br>\nIn this \"Python Tutorial: Essential Concepts for New Programmers,\" we’ve covered the foundational concepts that will set you on the path to becoming a proficient Python programmer. By understanding variables, control structures, functions, data structures, file handling, and error handling, you’ll be well-equipped to tackle more complex programming challenges.</p>\n\n<p>As you continue your journey, remember that practice is key. Work on small projects, participate in coding challenges, and explore Python’s extensive libraries to deepen your understanding. The programming community is vast and supportive, so don’t hesitate to seek help and share your progress.</p>\n\n<p>With dedication and practice, you’ll unlock the full potential of Python and open doors to exciting opportunities in the world of programming. Happy coding!</p>\n\n","contentLength":0,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"🚀 Building a Space Shooter Game with Amazon Q CLI and Python","url":"https://dev.to/pixie_0e8379490974b86be8c/building-a-space-shooter-game-with-amazon-q-cli-and-python-m8g","date":1750049290,"author":"Pixie","guid":156977,"unread":true,"content":"<p>Ever wondered if an AI assistant could help you build a fully playable game from scratch?<br>\nI tried exactly that with Amazon Q CLI, and what started as curiosity turned into a full-fledged Space Shooter game using Python’s pygame library.</p>\n\n<p>Key Highlights:</p>\n\n<p>🎯 What You’ll Learn in This Post</p>\n\n<p>💡 How I used Amazon Q CLI to generate the base</p>\n\n<p>📘 What I learned along the way</p>\n\n<p>🎨 How I added my custom assets and enhancements</p>\n\n<p>🧑‍💻 How you can build or improve it too!</p>\n\n<p>🛠 Tech Stack Used</p>\n\n<p>🐍 Language: Python</p>\n\n<p>🎮 Library: pygame</p>\n\n<p>🤖 AI Tool: Amazon Q CLI</p>\n\n<p>🖼 Assets: Custom PNGs and WAVs</p>\n\n<p>📁 Project Folder Structure</p>\n\n<p>space-shooter/<br>\n│<br>\n├── assets/<br>\n│   ├── player_ship.png<br>\n│   ├── enemy_ship.png<br>\n│   ├── background.png<br>\n│   ├── laser_player.png<br>\n│   ├── laser_enemy.png<br>\n│   ├── background.wav<br>\n│   ├── laser.wav<br>\n│   └── explosion.wav<br>\n│<br>\n├── highscore.txt<br>\n├── space_shooter.py</p>\n\n<p>🔄 Game Features Implemented (Thanks to Amazon Q)</p>\n\n<p>🚀 Player ship that moves in 4 directions</p>\n\n<p>🔫 Shooting mechanism using space bar</p>\n\n<p>👾 Enemy waves increasing each level</p>\n\n<p>🎯 Collision detection with Pygame masks</p>\n\n<p>🔊 Sound effects – music, lasers &amp;

You’re immediately faced with choices. Will you write a minimal implementation to pass the test? Or will you craft a modular command resolver that can scale?</p>\n\n<p>This is where your coding craftsmanship shines. The challenge isn't just technical—it's philosophical. You begin questioning your language of choice, its capabilities, and limitations. At times, you'll find yourself diving deep into documentation, searching for the best pattern or idiomatic approach.</p>\n\n<p>Here’s a quick snippet in Python to get started:<br>\n</p>\n\n<div class=\"highlight js-code-highlight\">\n<pre class=\"highlight python\"><code><span class=\"kn\">import</span> <span class=\"n\">sys</span>\n\n<span class=\"k\">def</span> <span class=\"nf\">shell_echo</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">args</span><span class=\"p\">):</span>\n    <span class=\"nf\">print</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"sh\">'</span><span class=\"s\"> </span><span class=\"sh\">'</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nf\">join</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">args</span><span class=\"p\">))</span>\n\n<span class=\"k\">if</span> <span class=\"n\">__name__</span> <span class=\"o\">==</span> <span class=\"sh\">\"</span><span class=\"s\">__main__</span><span class=\"sh\">\"</span><span class=\"p\">:</span>\n    <span class=\"nf\">shell_echo</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">sys</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"n\">argv</span><span class=\"p\">[</span><span class=\"mi\">1</span><span class=\"p\">:])</span>\n</code></pre>\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  Proofs\n</h2>\n\n<p>I know if I don't give you the proof you won't believe me.

Whether it's <a href=\"https://dev.to/wescpy/series/23343\">Workspace/GWS</a>, Cloud/GCP (<a href=\"https://dev.to/wescpy/text-based-language-processing-enhanced-with-aiml-1b1h\">AI/ML</a>, <a href=\"https://dev.to/wescpy/series/30098\">serverless</a>), <a href=\"https://dev.to/wescpy/series/29655\">Maps</a>, <a href=\"https://dev.to/wescpy/intro-to-the-youtube-apis-searching-for-videos-5a0o\">YouTube</a>, GenAI with <a href=\"https://dev.to/wescpy/series/27183\">Gemini</a>, or boilerplate like credentials (see below), there's something for everyone. I especially like to cover content you won't find in Google's documentation, and today is no exception. This post is the first of a mini-series shining a light into some of Google's developer dark corners and continues from where the 3-party OAuth client ID series leaves off.</p>\n\n<p>Numerous Google APIs require developers to implement auth security code while others provide higher-level libraries that abstract auth away from you. APIs that use the lower-level <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/api-client-library\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Google APIs client library</a> for <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/api-client-library/python\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Python</a> are the ones affected and what this post focuses on. These include APIs for GWS (e.g., Drive, Sheets, Gmail, etc), <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/youtube\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">YouTube</a>, other, older APIs, and surprisingly, a subset of GCP APIs that <strong>do not</strong> provide a <a href=\"https://github.com/googleapis/google-cloud-python\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Cloud client library</a>. (That's right, not all of them do!)</p>\n\n<p>Old code samples live forever online, so this post is meant to \"ground\" <strong>you</strong> and to future-finetune LLMs to produce consistent output and internalize the differences between both libraries, for both command-line interfaces (CLIs) as well as web apps. (CLIs are covered in this post; web apps are addressed in an upcoming post [link will be updated once that's published].)</p>\n\n<p>As discussed in other posts in this blog, there are three different types of user credentials when accessing Google APIs:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"https://dev.to/wescpy/series/25404\">API keys</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://dev.to/wescpy/series/25403\">OAuth client IDs</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://dev.to/wescpy/getting-started-with-google-apis-service-accounts-part-1-2fi0\">Service accounts</a></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>This change only applies to credentials used for authorized access, meaning OAuth client IDs and service accounts. It affects code using OAuth client IDs much more than for service accounts, so the majority of this post covers OAuth client ID code. Service accounts are addressed towards the end though.</p>\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  Background\n</h2>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://github.com/googleapis/oauth2client\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><code>oauth2client</code></a> library was <a href=\"https://github.com/googleapis/oauth2client/pull/714\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">deprecated in 2017</a> in favor of replacements, <a href=\"https://github.com/googleapis/google-auth-library-python\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><code>google-auth</code></a> (includes <code>google.auth</code> and <code>google.oauth2</code>) and <a href=\"https://github.com/googleapis/google-auth-library-python-oauthlib\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><code>google_auth_oauthlib</code></a>. While there's no post or other public announcement on the deprecation, the <code>google-auth</code> documentation <a href=\"https://google-auth.readthedocs.io/en/latest/oauth2client-deprecation.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">cites some reasoning</a> behind it.</p>\n\n<p>One of the biggest differences in code is that the new/current libraries do not (yet?) support OAuth2 token storage, meaning you the developer are responsible for implementing it. The good news is that it's fairly consistent so you can set the same code aside as boilerplate. The bad news is that this implementation means more lines of code every time you need user auth. At the time of this writing, <code>oauth2client</code> still functions properly, even in maintenance mode, providing automated, threadsafe, and Python 2/3-compatible storage of and access to OAuth2 tokens for your apps. Okay, let's dive in.</p>\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  Client library installation\n</h2>\n\n<p>Regardless of whether you use the old or new auth libraries, the <a href=\"https://github.com/googleapis/google-api-python-client\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Google API client library for Python (<code>google-api-python-client</code>)</a> is required. Optionally, instead of using <code>pip</code> directly to install the packages, you can use <a href=\"https://github.com/astral-sh/uv\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><code>uv</code></a>, a much faster alternative. To do so, update <code>pip</code> and install <code>uv</code> with this command:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>\n<code>pip install -U pip uv</code> (or <code>pip3</code> or <code>python3 -m pip</code> depending on your Python installation)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>\n  \n  \n  OLD\n</h3>\n\n<p>In your system or <code>virtualenv</code> environment, update <code>pip</code> and install the API client library and the OG auth libraries with this command:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><code>pip install -U pip google-api-python-client oauth2client</code></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>If using <code>uv</code>, use this instead:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><code>uv pip install -U google-api-python-client oauth2client</code></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Expect the typical install output.</p>\n\n<p>To confirm all required packages have been installed correctly, run this one:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><code>python -c \"import googleapiclient, httplib2, oauth2client\"</code></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>No errors and no output means the installation was successful!</p>\n\n<h3>\n  \n  \n  NEW\n</h3>\n\n<p>In your system or <code>virtualenv</code> environment, update <code>pip</code> and install the API client library and the new/current auth libraries with this command:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><code>pip install -U pip google-api-python-client google-auth-httplib2 google-auth-oauthlib</code></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>If using <code>uv</code>, use this instead:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><code>uv pip install -U google-api-python-client google-auth-httplib2 google-auth-oauthlib</code></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Expect the typical install output.</p>\n\n<p>To confirm all required packages have been installed correctly, run this one:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><code>python -c \"import googleapiclient, google.auth, google.oauth2, google_auth_oauthlib\"</code></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>No errors and no output means the installation was successful!</p>\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  Code\n</h2>\n\n<p>The code discussed here is independent of any specific APIs thus can be used as boilerplate. It's also 2.x/3.x-compatible. I'll now show code, discuss differences, then provide entire examples.</p>\n\n<p>The shortest code samples using the boilerplate that make the most sense to demo are featured as part of the <a href=\"http://g.co/codelabs/gsuite-apis-intro\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">GWS APIs intro codelab</a>, showcasing the <a href=\"http://developers.google.com/drive\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Drive API</a>. All the Drive API documentation has switched to the current library, but I have both old and new examples in one of my repos, so let's look at the diffs between <a href=\"https://github.com/wescpy/gsuite-apis-intro/blob/master/python/drive_list.py\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><code>python/drive_list.py</code></a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/wescpy/gsuite-apis-intro/blob/master/python/drive_list-new.py\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><code>python/drive_list-new.py</code></a>.</p>\n\n<h3>\n  \n  \n  Imports\n</h3>\n\n<h4>\n  \n  \n  OLD\n</h4>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"highlight js-code-highlight\">\n<pre class=\"highlight python\"><code><span class=\"kn\">from</span> <span class=\"n\">__future__</span> <span class=\"kn\">import</span> <span class=\"n\">print_function</span>\n\n<span class=\"kn\">from</span> <span class=\"n\">googleapiclient</span> <span class=\"kn\">import</span> <span class=\"n\">discovery</span>\n<span class=\"kn\">from</span> <span class=\"n\">httplib2</span> <span class=\"kn\">import</span> <span class=\"n\">Http</span>\n<span class=\"kn\">from</span> <span class=\"n\">oauth2client</span> <span class=\"kn\">import</span> <span class=\"nb\">file</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"n\">client</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"n\">tools</span>\n</code></pre>\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<h4>\n  \n  \n  NEW\n</h4>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"highlight js-code-highlight\">\n<pre class=\"highlight python\"><code><span class=\"kn\">from</span> <span class=\"n\">__future__</span> <span class=\"kn\">import</span> <span class=\"n\">print_function</span>\n<span class=\"kn\">import</span> <span class=\"n\">os.path</span>\n\n<span class=\"kn\">from</span> <span class=\"n\">google.auth.transport.requests</span> <span class=\"kn\">import</span> <span class=\"n\">Request</span>\n<span class=\"kn\">from</span> <span class=\"n\">google.oauth2</span> <span class=\"kn\">import</span> <span class=\"n\">credentials</span>\n<span class=\"kn\">from</span> <span class=\"n\">google_auth_oauthlib.flow</span> <span class=\"kn\">import</span> <span class=\"n\">InstalledAppFlow</span>\n<span class=\"kn\">from</span> <span class=\"n\">googleapiclient</span> <span class=\"kn\">import</span> <span class=\"n\">discovery</span>\n</code></pre>\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>Python standard library <code>import</code>s come first followed by 3rd-party package imports.

These imports <strong><em>only target</em></strong> CLIs -- web apps are covered in a future post.</p>\n\n<p>Regardless of whether your app is a CLI script or web app, the interface end-users see is the same: asking them for the permissions (the \"authorization\" or <em>authz</em>) for your app to access their data:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fj7m2l5r1lfaq3nyf2o3u.png\" class=\"article-body-image-wrapper\"><img src=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fj7m2l5r1lfaq3nyf2o3u.png\" alt=\"OAuth2 permissions authz prompt dialog\" width=\"462\" height=\"980\"></a></p>\nOAuth2 permissions/scope flow end-user authz prompt dialog\n\n\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<p>As mentioned already, the old library features built-in OAuth token storage while the current does not, so <code>os.path</code>' file utilities are needed if you want to implement storage. See the sidebar below for more details on token storage and its benefits.</p>\n\n<h4>\n  \n  \n  📝 <strong>Implement OAuth token storage</strong>\n</h4>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>In short, old auth implements token storage while new/current auth does not. This means that if you want it, you have to implement it on your own. Why bother? The consequence of <strong><em>not</em></strong> implementing token storage is that your users will have to see that OAuth2 permission dialog above <em>every time they try to access an API</em> with an expired <em>access token</em>. (Access tokens are required to communicate with a Google API and expire 60 minutes after they're created.)</p>\n\n<p>The key benefit to implementing this storage is that when end-users run your app calling an API with an expired access token, the stored <em>refresh token</em> is used to request a new (valid) access token from Google servers, all without troubling your users with yet-another permissions request. Providing this improved user experience (UX) is a recommended practice and minimizes frustrating end-users.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h3>\n  \n  \n  Security\n</h3>\n\n<p>The greatest differences between using the old and current auth libraries takes place in the OAuth flow part of the boilerplate.</p>\n\n<h4>\n  \n  \n  OLD\n</h4>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"highlight js-code-highlight\">\n<pre class=\"highlight python\"><code><span class=\"n\">SCOPES</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"sh\">'</span><span class=\"s\">https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.metadata.readonly</span><span class=\"sh\">'</span>\n<span class=\"n\">store</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"nb\">file</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nc\">Storage</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"sh\">'</span><span class=\"s\">storage.json</span><span class=\"sh\">'</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n<span class=\"n\">creds</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"n\">store</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nf\">get</span><span class=\"p\">()</span>\n<span class=\"k\">if</span> <span class=\"ow\">not</span> <span class=\"n\">creds</span> <span class=\"ow\">or</span> <span class=\"n\">creds</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"n\">invalid</span><span class=\"p\">:</span>\n    <span class=\"n\">flow</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"n\">client</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nf\">flow_from_clientsecrets</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"sh\">'</span><span class=\"s\">client_secret.json</span><span class=\"sh\">'</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"n\">SCOPES</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n    <span class=\"n\">creds</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"n\">tools</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nf\">run_flow</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">flow</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"n\">store</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n\n<span class=\"n\">DRIVE</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"n\">discovery</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nf\">build</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"sh\">'</span><span class=\"s\">drive</span><span class=\"sh\">'</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"sh\">'</span><span class=\"s\">v3</span><span class=\"sh\">'</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"n\">http</span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"n\">creds</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nf\">authorize</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nc\">Http</span><span class=\"p\">()))</span>\n</code></pre>\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>This snippet...</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Sets permission(s) requested from user... in this case, just read-only scope for user's Drive metadata (<code>SCOPES</code>)</li>\n<li>Sets file used for OAuth token storage, instantiating a <code>oauth2client.file.Storage</code> object (<code>store</code>)</li>\n<li>Attempts to retrieve any stored credentials (<code>creds</code>)</li>\n<li>Validates whether credentials exist <em>and</em> are valid</li>\n<li>If credentials do not exist or exist but are invalid\n\n<ul>\n<li>Builds OAuth <code>flow</code> from client ID &amp;

Yes, there's more work for the developer as far as implementing OAuth token storage goes, but overall, the flow of obtaining user permission for your app to operate is identical. Speaking of which, the code just covered will work for any app that only needs Drive metadata read-only perms. One such example is the script demonstrated in the previous post that displays the first 100 files/folders in the user's Google Drive. Here is the 3-line app unchanged from before:<br>\n</p>\n\n<div class=\"highlight js-code-highlight\">\n<pre class=\"highlight python\"><code><span class=\"n\">files</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"n\">DRIVE</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nf\">files</span><span class=\"p\">().</span><span class=\"nf\">list</span><span class=\"p\">().</span><span class=\"nf\">execute</span><span class=\"p\">().</span><span class=\"nf\">get</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"sh\">'</span><span class=\"s\">files</span><span class=\"sh\">'</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"p\">[])</span>\n<span class=\"k\">for</span> <span class=\"n\">f</span> <span class=\"ow\">in</span> <span class=\"n\">files</span><span class=\"p\">:</span>  <span class=\"c1\"># 4 fields returned: mimeType, kind, id, name\n</span>    <span class=\"nf\">print</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">f</span><span class=\"p\">[</span><span class=\"sh\">'</span><span class=\"s\">name</span><span class=\"sh\">'</span><span class=\"p\">],</span> <span class=\"n\">f</span><span class=\"p\">[</span><span class=\"sh\">'</span><span class=\"s\">mimeType</span><span class=\"sh\">'</span><span class=\"p\">])</span>\n</code></pre>\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Not mentioned</strong> in the previous post is an explanation of why it displays the first <em>100</em> files/folders (fewer if you don't have that many) in the requesting user's Drive. Simply put, the default is 100 if no <code>pageSize</code> value is provided to the <code>files().list()</code> method. (NOTE: For long-time developers, <code>pageSize</code> was named <code>maxResults</code> in Drive API v2).</p>\n\n<p>All other details are covered in the <a href=\"https://dev.to/googleworkspace/getting-started-using-google-apis-workspace-33-2me0\">previous post</a> along with sample output, Node.js versions, and even the video I produced that walks through the code. The Node.js and full versions of old and new scripts can be found in the repo at <a href=\"https://github.com/wescpy/gsuite-apis-intro\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://github.com/wescpy/gsuite-apis-intro</a>.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Command-line scripts vs. web apps vs. mobile backends</strong></p>\n\n<p>Command-line scripts aren't going to be the most widely implemented type of application. It's more likely you want to add GWS API usage to a web or mobile app. The calls will differ, but the OAuth flow will be similar. Google has a specific page in their docs for <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2/web-server\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">managing the OAuth flow process for web apps</a> as well as <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2/native-app\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">one for mobile apps</a>. Not to be lazy, but I'm <em>very</em> likely to do a follow-up post to this one that focuses on the web app version(s).</p>\n\n<p>To make these calls as part of a mobile backend, yet another common use case, developers can use of service accounts, because there is no end-users to ask for permissions, or, they <em>can</em> do that but cause the mobile app to launch a web page so the user can provide perms, then close the temporary mobile browser tab and resume operation back in the mobile app.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  Summary\n</h2>\n\n<p>Now you (and future LLMs via training from this post) know why code online showing up to use OAuth client ID credentials vary so much, and why you don't get an explanation from Google: they expect all old samples to disappear from the Internet and for everyone to follow what's in the current documentation. Unfortunately real life doesn't work that way.</p>\n\n<p>If you've made it this far, you'll know whether Python samples you found online or get while vibe-coding are based on the old or current auth libraries. You also have the knowledge to modernize any old code you come across.  Both code samples can be found in the <a href=\"http://g.co/codelabs/gsuite-apis-intro\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">codelab</a>'s open source <a href=\"https://github.com/wescpy/gsuite-apis-intro\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">repo</a></p>\n\n<p>While the code samples featured here use Drive, a GWS API, GWS APIs aren't the only family affected by the existence of code using both the old &amp; new auth libraries. You'll also come across this when using YouTube APIs, some (older or newer) GCP APIs, and other, older Google APIs. At some point, I'll do a follow-up to this post demonstrating code using other API families.</p>\n\n<p>Found errors or have suggestions on future content?

The dirty little secret is that Google has <em>two</em> auth libraries for Python, an \"OG\" and its replacement, and snippets for both live forever online, causing developer <em>and</em> LLM confusion. Google wants you to only use new/current stuff, so <strong>side-by-side examples in the docs using both old &amp; new</strong> (for compare/contrast or porting/migration) isn't happening.

Whether it's <a href=\"https://dev.to/wescpy/series/23343\">Workspace/GWS</a>, Cloud/GCP (<a href=\"https://dev.to/wescpy/text-based-language-processing-enhanced-with-aiml-1b1h\">AI/ML</a>, <a href=\"https://dev.to/wescpy/series/30098\">serverless</a>), <a href=\"https://dev.to/wescpy/series/29655\">Maps</a>, <a href=\"https://dev.to/wescpy/intro-to-the-youtube-apis-searching-for-videos-5a0o\">YouTube</a>, GenAI with <a href=\"https://dev.to/wescpy/series/27183\">Gemini</a>, or boilerplate like credentials (see below), there's something for everyone. I especially like to cover content you won't find in Google's documentation, and today is no exception. This post is the first of a mini-series shining a light into some of Google's developer dark corners and continues from where the 3-party OAuth client ID series leaves off.</p>\n\n<p>Numerous Google APIs require developers to implement auth security code while others provide higher-level libraries that abstract auth away from you. APIs that use the lower-level <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/api-client-library\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Google APIs client library</a> for <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/api-client-library/python\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Python</a> are the ones affected and what this post focuses on. These primarily include GWS APIs (e.g., Drive, Sheets, Gmail, etc) but also affect <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/youtube\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">YouTube</a>, other older APIs, and surprisingly, a subset of GCP APIs that <strong>do not</strong> provide a <a href=\"https://github.com/googleapis/google-cloud-python\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Cloud client library</a>. (That's right, not all of them do!)</p>\n\n<p>There <em>really</em> aren't any \"dirty secrets\" in this post, however Google does not acknowledge nor mention the previous library which had been around the past dozen years. Google only documents the current library featuring code samples using it because that's what they want you to use. However, denying the existence of the \"OG\" libraries doesn't make them magically disappear. Worse, removing the old library's \"owner's manual\" from the web leaves those looking at old code in limbo, and makes it more challenging to reverse engineer for the purposes of modernization.</p>\n\n<p>Old code samples, especially those <em>not</em> written by Google, live forever online, so this post is meant to \"ground\" <strong>you</strong> and to future-finetune LLMs to produce consistent output and internalize the differences between both libraries, for both command-line interfaces (CLIs) as well as web apps. (CLIs are covered in this post; I'll do web apps in an upcoming post.)</p>\n\n<p>As discussed in other posts in this blog, there are three different types of user credentials when accessing Google APIs:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"https://dev.to/wescpy/series/25404\">API keys</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://dev.to/wescpy/series/25403\">OAuth client IDs</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://dev.to/wescpy/getting-started-with-google-apis-service-accounts-part-1-2fi0\">Service accounts</a></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>This change only applies to credentials used for authorized access, meaning OAuth client IDs and service accounts. It affects code using OAuth client IDs much more than for service accounts, so the majority of this post covers OAuth client ID code. Service accounts are addressed towards the end though.</p>\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  Background\n</h2>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://github.com/googleapis/oauth2client\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><code>oauth2client</code></a> library was <a href=\"https://github.com/googleapis/oauth2client/pull/714\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">deprecated in 2017</a> in favor of replacements, <a href=\"https://github.com/googleapis/google-auth-library-python\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><code>google-auth</code></a> (includes <code>google.auth</code> and <code>google.oauth2</code>) and <a href=\"https://github.com/googleapis/google-auth-library-python-oauthlib\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><code>google_auth_oauthlib</code></a>. While there's no post or other public announcement on the deprecation, the <code>google-auth</code> documentation <a href=\"https://google-auth.readthedocs.io/en/latest/oauth2client-deprecation.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">cites some reasoning</a> behind it.</p>\n\n<p>One of the biggest differences in code is that the new/current libraries do not (yet?) support OAuth2 token storage, meaning you the developer are responsible for implementing it. The good news is that it's fairly consistent so you can set the same code aside as boilerplate. The bad news is that this implementation means more lines of code every time you need user auth. At the time of this writing, <code>oauth2client</code> still functions properly, even in maintenance mode, providing automated, threadsafe, and Python 2/3-compatible storage of and access to OAuth2 tokens for your apps. Okay, let's dive in.</p>\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  Client library installation\n</h2>\n\n<p>Regardless of whether you use the old or new auth libraries, the <a href=\"https://github.com/googleapis/google-api-python-client\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Google API client library for Python (<code>google-api-python-client</code>)</a> is required. Optionally, instead of using <code>pip</code> directly to install the packages, you can use <a href=\"https://github.com/astral-sh/uv\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><code>uv</code></a>, a much faster alternative. To do so, update <code>pip</code> and install <code>uv</code> with this command:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>\n<code>pip install -U pip uv</code> (or <code>pip3</code> or <code>python3 -m pip</code> depending on your Python installation)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>\n  \n  \n  OLD\n</h3>\n\n<p>In your system or <code>virtualenv</code> environment, update <code>pip</code> and install the API client library and the OG auth libraries with this command:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><code>pip install -U pip google-api-python-client oauth2client</code></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>If using <code>uv</code>, use this instead:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><code>uv pip install -U google-api-python-client oauth2client</code></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Expect the typical install output.</p>\n\n<p>To confirm all required packages have been installed correctly, run this one:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><code>python -c \"import googleapiclient, httplib2, oauth2client\"</code></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>No errors and no output means the installation was successful!</p>\n\n<h3>\n  \n  \n  NEW\n</h3>\n\n<p>In your system or <code>virtualenv</code> environment, update <code>pip</code> and install the API client library and the new/current auth libraries with this command:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><code>pip install -U pip google-api-python-client google-auth-httplib2 google-auth-oauthlib</code></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>If using <code>uv</code>, use this instead:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><code>uv pip install -U google-api-python-client google-auth-httplib2 google-auth-oauthlib</code></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Expect the typical install output.</p>\n\n<p>To confirm all required packages have been installed correctly, run this one:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><code>python -c \"import googleapiclient, google.auth, google.oauth2, google_auth_oauthlib\"</code></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>No errors and no output means the installation was successful!</p>\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  Code\n</h2>\n\n<p>The code discussed here is independent of any specific APIs thus can be used as boilerplate. It's also 2.x/3.x-compatible. I'll now show code, discuss differences, then provide entire examples.</p>\n\n<p>The shortest code samples using the boilerplate that make the most sense to demo are featured as part of the <a href=\"http://g.co/codelabs/gsuite-apis-intro\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">GWS APIs intro codelab</a>, showcasing the <a href=\"http://developers.google.com/drive\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Drive API</a>. All the Drive API documentation has switched to the current library, but I have both old and new examples in one of my repos, so let's look at the diffs between <a href=\"https://github.com/wescpy/gsuite-apis-intro/blob/master/python/drive_list.py\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><code>python/drive_list.py</code></a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/wescpy/gsuite-apis-intro/blob/master/python/drive_list-new.py\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><code>python/drive_list-new.py</code></a>.</p>\n\n<h3>\n  \n  \n  Imports\n</h3>\n\n<h4>\n  \n  \n  OLD\n</h4>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"highlight js-code-highlight\">\n<pre class=\"highlight python\"><code><span class=\"kn\">from</span> <span class=\"n\">__future__</span> <span class=\"kn\">import</span> <span class=\"n\">print_function</span>\n\n<span class=\"kn\">from</span> <span class=\"n\">googleapiclient</span> <span class=\"kn\">import</span> <span class=\"n\">discovery</span>\n<span class=\"kn\">from</span> <span class=\"n\">httplib2</span> <span class=\"kn\">import</span> <span class=\"n\">Http</span>\n<span class=\"kn\">from</span> <span class=\"n\">oauth2client</span> <span class=\"kn\">import</span> <span class=\"nb\">file</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"n\">client</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"n\">tools</span>\n</code></pre>\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<h4>\n  \n  \n  NEW\n</h4>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"highlight js-code-highlight\">\n<pre class=\"highlight python\"><code><span class=\"kn\">from</span> <span class=\"n\">__future__</span> <span class=\"kn\">import</span> <span class=\"n\">print_function</span>\n<span class=\"kn\">import</span> <span class=\"n\">os.path</span>\n\n<span class=\"kn\">from</span> <span class=\"n\">google.auth.transport.requests</span> <span class=\"kn\">import</span> <span class=\"n\">Request</span>\n<span class=\"kn\">from</span> <span class=\"n\">google.oauth2</span> <span class=\"kn\">import</span> <span class=\"n\">credentials</span>\n<span class=\"kn\">from</span> <span class=\"n\">google_auth_oauthlib.flow</span> <span class=\"kn\">import</span> <span class=\"n\">InstalledAppFlow</span>\n<span class=\"kn\">from</span> <span class=\"n\">googleapiclient</span> <span class=\"kn\">import</span> <span class=\"n\">discovery</span>\n</code></pre>\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>Python standard library <code>import</code>s come first followed by 3rd-party package imports.

These imports <strong><em>only target</em></strong> CLIs -- web apps are covered in a future post.</p>\n\n<p>Regardless of whether your app is a CLI script or web app, the interface end-users see is the same: asking them for the permissions (the \"authorization\" or <em>authz</em>) for your app to access their data:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fj7m2l5r1lfaq3nyf2o3u.png\" class=\"article-body-image-wrapper\"><img src=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fj7m2l5r1lfaq3nyf2o3u.png\" alt=\"OAuth2 permissions authz prompt dialog\" width=\"462\" height=\"980\"></a></p>\nOAuth2 permissions/scope flow end-user authz prompt dialog\n\n\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<p>As mentioned already, the old library features built-in OAuth token storage while the current does not, so <code>os.path</code>' file utilities are needed if you want to implement storage. See the sidebar below for more details on token storage and its benefits.</p>\n\n<h4>\n  \n  \n  📝 <strong>Implement OAuth token storage</strong>\n</h4>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>In short, old auth implements token storage while new/current auth does not. This means that if you want it, you have to implement it on your own. Why bother? The consequence of <strong><em>not</em></strong> implementing token storage is that your users will have to see that OAuth2 permission dialog above <em>every time they try to access an API</em> with an expired <em>access token</em>. (Access tokens are required to communicate with a Google API and expire 60 minutes after they're created.)</p>\n\n<p>The key benefit to implementing this storage is that when end-users run your app calling an API with an expired access token, the stored <em>refresh token</em> is used to request a new (valid) access token from Google servers, all without troubling your users with yet-another permissions request. Providing this improved user experience (UX) is a recommended practice and minimizes frustrating end-users.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h3>\n  \n  \n  Security\n</h3>\n\n<p>The greatest differences between using the old and current auth libraries takes place in the OAuth flow part of the boilerplate.</p>\n\n<h4>\n  \n  \n  OLD\n</h4>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"highlight js-code-highlight\">\n<pre class=\"highlight python\"><code><span class=\"n\">SCOPES</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"sh\">'</span><span class=\"s\">https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.metadata.readonly</span><span class=\"sh\">'</span>\n<span class=\"n\">store</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"nb\">file</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nc\">Storage</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"sh\">'</span><span class=\"s\">storage.json</span><span class=\"sh\">'</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n<span class=\"n\">creds</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"n\">store</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nf\">get</span><span class=\"p\">()</span>\n<span class=\"k\">if</span> <span class=\"ow\">not</span> <span class=\"n\">creds</span> <span class=\"ow\">or</span> <span class=\"n\">creds</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"n\">invalid</span><span class=\"p\">:</span>\n    <span class=\"n\">flow</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"n\">client</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nf\">flow_from_clientsecrets</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"sh\">'</span><span class=\"s\">client_secret.json</span><span class=\"sh\">'</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"n\">SCOPES</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n    <span class=\"n\">creds</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"n\">tools</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nf\">run_flow</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">flow</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"n\">store</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n\n<span class=\"n\">DRIVE</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"n\">discovery</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nf\">build</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"sh\">'</span><span class=\"s\">drive</span><span class=\"sh\">'</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"sh\">'</span><span class=\"s\">v3</span><span class=\"sh\">'</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"n\">http</span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"n\">creds</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nf\">authorize</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nc\">Http</span><span class=\"p\">()))</span>\n</code></pre>\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>This snippet...</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Sets permission(s) requested from user... in this case, just read-only scope for user's Drive metadata (<code>SCOPES</code>)</li>\n<li>Sets file used for OAuth token storage, instantiating a <code>oauth2client.file.Storage</code> object (<code>store</code>)</li>\n<li>Attempts to retrieve any stored credentials (<code>creds</code>)</li>\n<li>Validates whether credentials exist <em>and</em> are valid</li>\n<li>If credentials do not exist or exist but are invalid\n\n<ul>\n<li>Builds OAuth <code>flow</code> from client ID &amp;

(NOTE: For long-time developers, <code>pageSize</code> was named <code>maxResults</code> in Drive API v2).</p>\n\n<p>All other details are covered in the <a href=\"https://dev.to/googleworkspace/getting-started-using-google-apis-workspace-33-2me0\">previous post</a> along with sample output, Node.js versions, and even the video I produced that walks through the code. The Node.js and full versions of old and new scripts can be found in the repo at <a href=\"https://github.com/wescpy/gsuite-apis-intro\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://github.com/wescpy/gsuite-apis-intro</a>.</p>\n\n<p>While the code samples featured here use Drive, a GWS API, GWS APIs are the primary API family affected by the existence both libraries, but <em>it's not the only API family</em>. You'll also come across this when using YouTube APIs, some (older or newer) GCP APIs, and other, older Google APIs. At some point, I'll do a follow-up to this post demonstrating code using other API families.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Command-line scripts vs. web apps vs. mobile backends</strong></p>\n\n<p>Command-line scripts aren't going to be the most widely implemented type of application. It's more likely you want to add GWS API usage to a web or mobile app. The calls will differ, but the OAuth flow will be similar. Google has a specific page in their docs for <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2/web-server\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">managing the OAuth flow process for web apps</a> as well as <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2/native-app\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">one for mobile apps</a>. Not to be lazy, but I'm <em>very</em> likely to do a follow-up post to this one that focuses on the web app version(s).</p>\n\n<p>To make these calls as part of a mobile backend, yet another common use case, developers can use of service accounts, because there is no end-users to ask for permissions, or, they <em>can</em> do that but cause the mobile app to launch a web page so the user can provide perms, then close the temporary mobile browser tab and resume operation back in the mobile app.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  Summary\n</h2>\n\n<p>Now you (and future LLMs via training from this post) know why code online showing up to use OAuth client ID credentials vary so much, and why you don't get an explanation from Google: they expect all old samples to disappear from the Internet and for everyone to follow what's in the current documentation. Unfortunately real life doesn't work that way.</p>\n\n<p>If you've made it this far, you'll know whether Python samples you found online or get while vibe-coding are based on the old or current auth libraries. You also have the knowledge to modernize any old code you come across.  Both code samples can be found in the <a href=\"http://g.co/codelabs/gsuite-apis-intro\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">codelab</a>'s open source <a href=\"https://github.com/wescpy/gsuite-apis-intro\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">repo</a></p>\n\n<p>Found errors or have suggestions on future content?

Duru","guid":155888,"unread":true,"content":"<p>For the purpose of this lesson we will be looking at certain aspects </p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Type Checking</li>\n<li>Type Casting (implicit and Explicit Type Casting)</li>\n<li>Input function\n*<em>TYPE CHECKING:How to check the type of a data variable *</em>\nUsing the type function we can check whether the given variable data type is an integer, float, string or boolean. \ne.g x=200\nprint (type(x))----&gt;Integer\ny= \"adaobi\"\nprint(type(y))---&gt; string\nz= 120.23\nprint (type(z))----&gt; floating point </li>\n</ol>\n\n<p><strong>TYPE CASTING</strong><br>\nWe have implicit and Explicit type casting<br>\n<strong>Implicit  type casting</strong> (also called type coercion) is when Python automatically converts one data type to another during an operation, without you needing to do anything.<br>\ne.g <br>\nx=10   ====&gt; Integer<br>\ny=20.5 ====&gt; Float <br>\nz=x+y =====&gt; conversion<br>\nprint (type(z))===&gt; float as the final result is 30.5 which is a decimal number. <br>\n<strong>Explicit Type Casting</strong><br>\nIn this case a user has to convert from one data type to another.<br>\nFor example the int() function will convert any data type to an integer. <br>\na=10.4<br>\na=int(a)<br>\nprint (a)===&gt; if this code is run the output will be 10. Therefore the number has moved from being a decimal point to an integer. <br>\nTo convert from an integer to a float <br>\na=10<br>\na=float(a)<br>\nprint (a)==&gt; if this is run the result will be 10.0</p>\n\n<p>In python, it is important to note that \"10\"+\"10\" is considered a string not an integer because of the presence of quotation marks. In python + operator between strings means string CONCATENATION so in other words they are joined together \"10\" + \"10\"= 1010<br>\nIn the event that you type into your IDE<br>\na=\"10\"<br>\nb=\"20\"<br>\nif you go ahead to say c=a+ b you will get \"1020\" because both numbers are strings so there is a concatenation. <br>\nSo the right thing to do is <br>\na=\"10\"<br>\nb=\"20\"<br>\na=int(a)<br>\nb=int(b)<br>\nc=a+b<br>\nprint (c)==&gt; Result is 30 in this case because the string has been converted to the integer by virtue of the int() function</p>\n\n<p>To convert to string<br>\na=20<br>\nb=10<br>\na=str(a)<br>\nb=str(b)<br>\nc=a+b<br>\nprint (c)==&gt; The result will be \"2010\"</p>\n\n<p>To convert into a boolean value <br>\na=0<br>\nb=1<br>\na=bool(a)<br>\nb=bool(b)<br>\nprint (a)===&gt;false (returns zero as false<br>\nPrint(b)===&gt; True (returns non zero values as true)<br>\n*<em>INPUT FUNCTION *</em><br>\n What does input() do?<br>\nIt pauses the program and waits for the user to type something.<br>\nWhatever the user types is returned as a string.<br>\ne.g <br>\na=Input (\"Please Enter number 1\")<br>\nb=Input (\"Please Enter number 2\")<br>\nc=a+b<br>\nprint (c)<br>\nThe result is that in the terminal you will be asked to enter the value of number 1 and number 2. If it is 200 and 100 that is entered the result will be 200100 But in the event that <br>\na=int(a)<br>\nb=int(b) is inserted into the line of code it will be 300 because 200+100 is 300 as the string had been converted to an integer making it possible for an addition of the two values. <br>\nThis same code can be written in this shorter form. e.g a=int(input(\"Please enter Number 1:\"))<br>\n          b=int(input(\"Please enter number 2:\"))</p>\n\n<p>The following was discussed in this tutorial<br>\n==&gt;How to check data type using type function<br>\n==&gt; Type casting(implicit and explicit)<br>\n==&gt; Input Function</p>\n\n<p>The next topic will be on Strings in Python </p>\n\n","contentLength":0,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"🛡️ A Swahili SMS Scam Dataset and a Machine Learning Tool to Use It","url":"https://dev.to/henrylehd/a-swahili-sms-scam-dataset-and-a-machine-learning-tool-to-use-it-19li","date":1750019324,"author":"Henry Dioniz","guid":155844,"unread":true,"content":"<p>In Tanzania 🇹🇿, scammers are getting smarter.

Unlike ANNs, where neurons activate based on weighted sums of inputs, SNNs operate on discrete \"spikes\" or events. Neurons in an SNN fire only when their membrane potential, accumulated from incoming spikes, reaches a certain threshold. This event-driven nature offers significant advantages, particularly in terms of energy efficiency and suitability for processing real-time, asynchronous data streams.</p>\n\n<p>At their core, SNNs offer a promise of more energy-efficient and biologically plausible AI. While ANNs require constant computation, SNNs only process information when a spike occurs, leading to potentially massive power savings, especially for edge computing and always-on devices. This efficiency is crucial as the computational demands of AI continue to grow.

Open-source frameworks democratize access to this complex technology, allowing researchers, developers, and enthusiasts to experiment and innovate without the need for proprietary hardware or expensive licenses. This collaborative environment fosters rapid development, knowledge sharing, and the establishment of best practices, addressing the common challenges of \"programming complexity\" and the \"lack of standardized tools\" in neuromorphic research. The <a href=\"https://open-neuromorphic.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Open Neuromorphic community</a> serves as a central hub for these collaborative efforts, providing a rich repository of software and resources.</p>\n\n<h3>\n  \n  \n  Choosing Your Toolkit: BindsNET\n</h3>\n\n<p>For building your first SNN, selecting a user-friendly framework is crucial. While options like Brian (a Python SNN simulator known for its flexibility) and Lava (Intel's framework with strong hardware-mapping potential) exist, BindsNET stands out as an excellent choice for those familiar with deep learning, as it's built on top of the popular PyTorch library. This integration allows developers to leverage their existing PyTorch knowledge and ecosystem, making the transition to SNNs smoother. BindsNET is geared towards machine learning and reinforcement learning applications, providing tools for creating, managing, and simulating spiking neural networks with GPU/CPU acceleration. More information on BindsNET can be found on the <a href=\"https://open-neuromorphic.org/neuromorphic-computing/software/snn-frameworks/bindsnet/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Open Neuromorphic website</a>.</p>\n\n<h3>\n  \n  \n  Step-by-Step Tutorial: Building a Simple SNN\n</h3>\n\n<p>Let's walk through the process of building a simple SNN for a basic pattern recognition task, such as classifying MNIST digits, using BindsNET.</p>\n\n<h4>\n  \n  \n  Environment Setup\n</h4>\n\n<p>First, you'll need to install BindsNET and its dependencies.

Therefore, a crucial step is to convert static input data (like images) into a series of spikes. One common method is Poisson encoding, where pixel intensity is converted into a firing rate. Brighter pixels result in a higher probability of a neuron firing a spike.</p>\n\n<p>Here's how you can prepare the MNIST dataset for BindsNET using a Poisson encoder:<br>\n</p>\n\n<div class=\"highlight js-code-highlight\">\n<pre class=\"highlight python\"><code><span class=\"kn\">from</span> <span class=\"n\">bindsnet.datasets</span> <span class=\"kn\">import</span> <span class=\"n\">MNIST</span>\n<span class=\"kn\">from</span> <span class=\"n\">bindsnet.encoding</span> <span class=\"kn\">import</span> <span class=\"n\">PoissonEncoder</span>\n<span class=\"kn\">from</span> <span class=\"n\">torch.utils.data</span> <span class=\"kn\">import</span> <span class=\"n\">DataLoader</span>\n<span class=\"kn\">from</span> <span class=\"n\">torchvision.transforms</span> <span class=\"kn\">import</span> <span class=\"n\">Compose</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"n\">ToTensor</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"n\">Normalize</span>\n\n<span class=\"c1\"># Define transformations\n# Normalization is important for consistent input scaling\n</span><span class=\"n\">transforms</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"nc\">Compose</span><span class=\"p\">([</span>\n    <span class=\"nc\">ToTensor</span><span class=\"p\">(),</span>\n    <span class=\"nc\">Normalize</span><span class=\"p\">((</span><span class=\"mf\">0.1307</span><span class=\"p\">,),</span> <span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"mf\">0.3081</span><span class=\"p\">,))</span> <span class=\"c1\"># Standard MNIST normalization values\n</span><span class=\"p\">])</span>\n\n<span class=\"c1\"># Load MNIST dataset (training set)\n</span><span class=\"n\">dataset</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"nc\">MNIST</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">root</span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"sh\">\"</span><span class=\"s\">./data</span><span class=\"sh\">\"</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"n\">download</span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"bp\">True</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"n\">train</span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"bp\">True</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"n\">transform</span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"n\">transforms</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n<span class=\"n\">dataloader</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"nc\">DataLoader</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">dataset</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"n\">batch_size</span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"mi\">1</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"n\">shuffle</span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"bp\">True</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n\n<span class=\"c1\"># Define a Poisson encoder\n# This converts pixel intensities into spike trains over a specified time window\n</span><span class=\"n\">time_steps</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"mi\">50</span>  <span class=\"c1\"># Simulation time steps, representing the duration of each input presentation\n</span><span class=\"n\">encoded_dataset</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"nc\">PoissonEncoder</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">time</span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"n\">time_steps</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"n\">dt</span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"mf\">1.0</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n</code></pre>\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2F8f6r8cycgzl9sj08hduc.webp\" class=\"article-body-image-wrapper\"><img src=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2F8f6r8cycgzl9sj08hduc.webp\" alt=\"A visual representation of data encoding for SNNs, showing a grayscale image transforming into a series of spike trains over time.

A simple setup involves an input layer, an output layer, and a connection between them. We'll use Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) neurons, a common model in SNNs that simulates the accumulation of membrane potential and subsequent spiking. For learning, we'll employ Spike-Timing-Dependent Plasticity (STDP), a biologically inspired learning rule where the timing difference between pre- and post-synaptic spikes determines the change in synaptic weight.<br>\n</p>\n\n<div class=\"highlight js-code-highlight\">\n<pre class=\"highlight python\"><code><span class=\"kn\">from</span> <span class=\"n\">bindsnet.network</span> <span

Visualization is also key to understanding SNN behavior, allowing you to observe spike activity patterns within the network. BindsNET offers tools for this, which can help in debugging and gaining insights into how the SNN processes information.</p>\n\n<h3>\n  \n  \n  Challenges and Next Steps\n</h3>\n\n<p>While open-source frameworks like BindsNET make SNNs more accessible, the field still faces challenges. Training SNNs can be more complex than ANNs due to the discrete nature of spikes and the intricacies of spike-based learning rules. The lack of robust, standardized benchmarks for SNNs also makes direct comparison and performance evaluation challenging.</p>\n\n<p>However, the potential of neuromorphic computing is immense. As you gain experience, consider exploring more advanced SNN models, such as recurrent spiking neural networks, or delving into event-based datasets from dynamic vision sensors (DVS cameras), which are naturally suited for SNN processing. For those interested in hardware, investigating neuromorphic hardware platforms like Intel's Loihi or IBM's TrueNorth offers a glimpse into the future of ultra-efficient, brain-inspired computing. Intel's Lava framework, for instance, is specifically designed for developing applications that map to neuromorphic hardware and offers significant gains in energy efficiency and speed. You can find more details about <a href=\"https://lava-nc.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Lava on its official website</a>.</p>\n\n<h3>\n  \n  \n  Conclusion\n</h3>\n\n<p>Building your first Spiking Neural Network with open-source frameworks is a rewarding step into the exciting world of neuromorphic computing. By understanding the fundamentals of SNNs, leveraging accessible tools like BindsNET, and embracing the open-source community, you are well-equipped to contribute to and benefit from this rapidly evolving field. The journey beyond traditional AI models has just begun, and with SNNs, we are moving closer to creating intelligent systems that are not only powerful but also remarkably efficient, mirroring the elegance of the human brain.</p>\n\n","contentLength":0,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Stem Separation and it was ME who fixed spelling in CHATGPT images","url":"https://dev.to/djblackeye/stem-separation-2adp","date":1750017665,"author":"Toby Bell","guid":155815,"unread":true,"content":"<p><a href=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2F93593me62spjimna65v8.png\" class=\"article-body-image-wrapper\"><img src=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2F93593me62spjimna65v8.png\" alt=\"Image description\" width=\"800\" height=\"311\"></a>ok so after getting annoyed with Chat GPT continually breaking my code, and switching to Claude ;i have managed to get stem separation down to 4.7 secs for a 24 bit 5 min .wav track, in dos<br>\n<a href=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fxqe79wa53o4omcnfovdw.png\" class=\"article-body-image-wrapper\"><img src=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fxqe79wa53o4omcnfovdw.png\" alt=\"Image description\" width=\"800\" height=\"400\"></a></p>\n\n<p>in windows its about 10 seconds, im using the demucs protocol,and cuda enabled.</p>\n\n<p>the whole CHAT GPT thing really upset me, does it actively try to annoy you?

It's happened to all of us! This common social challenge inspired me to build the <strong>Name Match Memory Game</strong> a simple but effective tool to help people practice connecting faces with names.</p>\n\n<p>The idea was straightforward: create a game that shows users face images, presents multiple name options, and helps them practice making the right connections. What started as a simple command-line tool evolved into a full-fledged web application, all with the help of <strong>Amazon Q CLI</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  Setting Up Amazon Q CLI\n</h2>\n\n<p>Getting started with Amazon Q CLI on my Windows machine using WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) took a bit of setup, but was worth the effort.</p>\n\n<p>First, I needed to install the AWS CLI and configure it with my credentials:<br>\n</p>\n\n<div class=\"highlight js-code-highlight\">\n<pre class=\"highlight shell\"><code>curl <span class=\"s2\">\"https://awscli.amazonaws.com/awscli-exe-linux-x86_64.zip\"</span> <span class=\"nt\">-o</span> <span class=\"s2\">\"awscliv2.zip\"</span>\nunzip awscliv2.zip\n<span class=\"nb\">sudo</span> ./aws/install\naws configure\n</code></pre>\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>Then I installed Amazon Q CLI:<br>\n</p>\n\n<div class=\"highlight js-code-highlight\">\n<pre class=\"highlight shell\"><code>curl <span class=\"nt\">-Lo</span> <span class=\"s2\">\"/tmp/q-cli.deb\"</span> <span class=\"s2\">\"https://d3op2l77j7wnti.cloudfront.net/releases/amazon-q-cli/v0.1.0/amazon-q-cli_0.1.0_amd64.deb\"</span>\n<span class=\"nb\">sudo </span>dpkg <span class=\"nt\">-i</span> /tmp/q-cli.deb\n</code></pre>\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>I faced a couple of challenges during setup:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Getting the shell initialization right (needed to add Q CLI to my PATH)</li>\n<li>Understanding the correct commands to start a chat session</li>\n<li>Ensuring my AWS credentials were properly configured</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>After some troubleshooting, I was able to start Q CLI with a simple command:<br>\n</p>\n\n<div class=\"highlight js-code-highlight\">\n<pre class=\"highlight shell\"><code>q chat\n</code></pre>\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  Using Q CLI to Build the Game\n</h2>\n\n<p>Once I had Q CLI running, the development process was surprisingly smooth. I started by describing my game idea:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Create a Python CLI game that helps users remember people's names and faces.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Q CLI immediately understood what I wanted and helped me design the core game logic. We started with a command-line version that:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Stored people's data in a JSON file</li>\n<li>Displayed \"faces\" (as file paths in the CLI version)</li>\n<li>Presented multiple-choice

Image Handling\n</h3>\n\n<p>Images are stored in the <code>static/images/</code> directory and named according to person IDs (e.g., <code>alice.jpg</code>). The Flask application dynamically loads these images during gameplay.</p>\n\n\n\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  Running the Game\n</h2>\n\n<p>Getting the game running required a few steps:</p>\n\n<h3>\n  \n  \n  Prerequisites\n</h3>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Python 3.6+</li>\n<li>Flask</li>\n<li>Virtual environment</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>\n  \n  \n  Setup Process\n</h3>\n\n<p>I created a virtual environment and installed Flask:<br>\n</p>\n\n<div class=\"highlight js-code-highlight\">\n<pre class=\"highlight shell\"><code>python3 <span class=\"nt\">-m</span> venv venv\n<span class=\"nb\">source </span>venv/bin/activate\npip <span class=\"nb\">install </span>flask\n</code></pre>\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>This was another area where I faced challenges—initially getting a <code>ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'flask'</code> error. Q CLI helped me troubleshoot this by explaining I needed to install Flask in my virtual environment.</p>\n\n<h3>\n  \n  \n  Starting the Game\n</h3>\n\n<p>Once everything was set up, starting the game was simple:<br>\n</p>\n\n<div class=\"highlight js-code-highlight\">\n<pre class=\"highlight shell\"><code>python app.py\n</code></pre>\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>Then I could access the game by opening a browser and navigating to:<br><br>\n<code>http://127.0.0.1:5000/</code></p>\n\n<h3>\n  \n  \n  Adding New People\n</h3>\n\n<p>To add new people to the game:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Add their information to <code>people_data.json</code> with a unique ID</li>\n<li>Place their image in <code>static/images/</code> with the filename matching their ID</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  My Learnings and Reflections\n</h2>\n\n<p>Working with Amazon Q CLI to build this game taught me several valuable lessons:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>\n<strong>AI-assisted coding is powerful:</strong> Q CLI helped me go from concept to working application much faster than I could have alone. It understood my requirements and generated well-structured code.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Interactive problem-solving:</strong> When I hit roadblocks (like Flask installation issues), Q CLI provided clear, step-by-step solutions.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Learning by doing:</strong> The conversational nature of Q CLI allowed me to learn Flask web development concepts as we built the application together.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Iterative development:</strong> I could easily request changes or enhancements, like adding the start page, and Q CLI would help implement them.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>What I enjoyed most was how Q CLI maintained context throughout our conversation. It remembered what we had built earlier and could refer back to previous code when making improvements.</p>\n\n\n\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  What's Next?\n</h2>\n\n<p>This project is just the beginning! With the foundation in place, I'm planning several enhancements:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>User Authentication: Allow multiple users to track their individual progress</li>\n<li>Upload Interface: Web form to add new people and images directly</li>\n<li>Database Integration: Replace JSON files with a proper database</li>\n<li>Leaderboard: Compare performance with other users</li>\n<li>Difficulty Levels: Add timed challenges and harder modes</li>\n<li>Mobile Optimization: Make the game fully responsive for on-the-go practice</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  Conclusion\n</h2>\n\n<p>Building the Name Match Memory Game with Amazon Q CLI was both educational and enjoyable. The tool helped me transform a simple idea into a functional web application, even as someone relatively new to Flask development.</p>\n\n<p>If you have a project idea but aren't sure how to implement it, I highly recommend giving Amazon Q CLI a try. The interactive, conversational approach to coding makes development more accessible and helps bridge knowledge gaps as you build.</p>\n\n<p>Have you used Amazon Q CLI for any of your projects?

Among its many flavors, <strong>Error-based SQL Injection</strong> stands out as a powerful technique used to extract sensitive data or infer system behavior — even in <strong>blind contexts</strong> where no direct output is visible.</p>\n\n<p>Let’s take a deep dive into this fascinating attack vector using <strong>enhanced explanations</strong>, detailed query breakdowns, and real-world exploitation techniques.</p>\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  🔍 What is Error-Based SQL Injection? 💣\n</h2>\n\n<p>Error-based SQL injection is when an attacker <strong>intentionally causes database errors</strong> to either:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Extract sensitive information directly from <strong>verbose error messages</strong>, or</li>\n<li>Infer truth values (true/false) based on whether an <strong>error occurs</strong> — useful in blind SQL injection scenarios.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>\n  \n  \n  🔄 Two Main Use Cases:\n</h3>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p><strong>Conditional Errors</strong>:<br><br>\nTrigger an error only if a specific condition is true → infer results via differences in HTTP responses.<br><br>\n⚙️ <em>Useful for Blind SQL Injection</em>.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Data Extraction via Errors</strong>:<br><br>\nForce the database to include sensitive data inside an error message → full visibility of hidden data.<br><br>\n🕵️‍♂️ <em>Turns blind SQLi into visible SQLi</em>.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  🤖 Conditional Error-Based SQL Injection (Blind)\n</h2>\n\n<p>When <strong>no output is returned</strong>, and the app's behavior doesn't visibly change between <code>TRUE</code> and <code>FALSE</code> conditions, we can still exploit it by making the database <strong>throw an error conditionally</strong>.</p>\n\n<h3>\n  \n  \n  🧪 Example Scenario:\n</h3>\n\n<p>You're attacking a vulnerable web app that uses a <code>TrackingId</code> cookie like this:<br>\n</p>\n\n<div class=\"highlight js-code-highlight\">\n<pre class=\"highlight sql\"><code><span class=\"k\">SELECT</span> <span class=\"o\">*</span> <span class=\"k\">FROM</span> <span class=\"n\">tracking</span> <span class=\"k\">WHERE</span> <span class=\"n\">id</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"s1\">'xyz'</span>\n</code></pre>\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>You inject payloads to make the application behave differently <strong>only when an error occurs</strong>.</p>\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  🧩 Technique: Using <code>CASE</code> + <code>1/0</code> to Trigger Errors\n</h2>\n\n<h3>\n  \n  \n  ✅ Payload 1 (False Condition):\n</h3>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"highlight js-code-highlight\">\n<pre class=\"highlight sql\"><code><span class=\"n\">xyz</span><span class=\"s1\">' AND (SELECT CASE WHEN (1=2) THEN 1/0 ELSE '</span><span class=\"n\">a</span><span class=\"s1\">' END)='</span><span class=\"n\">a</span>\n</code></pre>\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<h4>\n  \n  \n  🧾 Breakdown:\n</h4>\n\n<div class=\"table-wrapper-paragraph\"><table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Part</th>\n<th>Purpose</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><code>'</code></td>\n<td>Closes the string input</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>CASE WHEN (1=2)</code></td>\n<td>Always false</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>THEN 1/0</code></td>\n<td>Causes divide-by-zero error (if condition is true)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>ELSE 'a' END</code></td>\n<td>Returns <code>'a'</code> if false → safe</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>='a'</code></td>\n<td>Ensures comparison

Instead of writing the same code again and again, you write a function once and use it whenever needed. However, it is important to note that there are built-in functions such as  print and type functions<br>\nFor example:<br>\na=200<br>\nb=100<br>\nc=300<br>\nprint(a+b+c)which will give the result 600 as output. <br>\n<strong>PRINT FUNCTION</strong><br>\nprint() therefore is a built-in function in Python that displays output on the screen (usually in the terminal or console). It's one of the first functions every Python programmer uses.<br>\n✅ Basic usage:</p>\n\n<p>print(\"Hello, world!\")</p>\n\n<p>📤 This prints:</p>\n\n<p>Hello, world!<br>\n<strong>TYPE FUNCTION</strong><br>\nThis function tells you the data type of a variable <br>\ne.g <br>\na=100<br>\nb=10.5<br>\nc= \"Joshua\"<br>\nx= True<br>\nTo find the data type of each variables the following will be inputed<br>\nprint(type(a)) #Output ---Showing data type is an integer<br>\nprint(type(b)) #Output --Showing data type is a float<br>\nprint(type(c)) #Output --- Showing data type is a string<br>\nprint(type(x)) #Output ---Showing data type is a boolean.</p>\n\n<p><strong>OPERATORS</strong><br>\nNow going into operators at the beginning of the tutorial i pointed out that operators are special symbols that perform arithmetic or logical operations. They require operands(Data) to perform their jobs. <br>\ne'g 100     +      200<br>\n     |      |       |<br>\nOperand  Operator Operand<br>\nWe have arithmetic, logical,bitwise, relational and identity operators. </p>\n\n<p><strong>ARITHMETIC OPERATORS</strong><br>\nArithmetic operators are used to perform basic mathematical calculations like addition, subtraction, division, multiplication etc<br>\nFor Example: <br>\n| Operator | Description                       | Example  | Result |<br>\n| -------- | --------------------------------- | -------- | ------ |<br>\n| <code>+</code>      | Addition                          | <code>5 + 3</code>  | <code>8</code>    |<br>\n| <code>-</code>      | Subtraction                       | <code>10 - 4</code> | <code>6</code>    |<br>\n| <code>*</code>      | Multiplication                    | <code>7 * 2</code>  | <code>14</code>   |<br>\n| <code>/</code>      | Division (float)                  | <code>9 / 3</code>  | <code>3.0</code>  |<br>\n| <code>//</code>     | Floor Division (integer division) | <code>9 // 4</code> | <code>2</code>    |<br>\n| <code>%</code>      | Modulus (remainder)               | <code>10 % 3</code> | <code>1</code>    |<br>\n| <code>**</code>     | Exponentiation (power)            | <code>2 ** 3</code> | <code>8</code>    |</p>\n\n<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>\n\n<p>a = 10<br>\nb = 3</p>\n\n<p>print(a + b)  # 13 which is 10+13<br>\nprint(a - b)  # 7  which is 10-3<br>\nprint(a * b)  # 30 which is 10 x3<br>\nprint(a / b)  # 3.3333333333333335 which is 10÷3<br>\nprint(a // b) # 3 which is the number of times 3 can go in 10 and which is rounded down to a whole number because both numbers are whole numbers. <br>\nprint(a % b)  # 1 which is the remainder when 10 is divided by 3<br>\nprint(a ** b) # 1000 which is 10 raised to power 3</p>\n\n<p><strong>RELATIONAL OPERATORS</strong><br>\nRelational operators are used to compare two values. The result of a comparison is always a Boolean value: True or False. <br>\nNote:Relational operators can be used to compare strings.<br>\nRelational operators are: &lt;,&gt;,=,==,&lt;=,&gt;=!=<br>\nE.g <br>\na=200<br>\nb=100<br>\ngreater_than= a&gt; b<br>\nprint (greater_than) The result of this will be True (boolean) bedcause 200 is greater than 100. <br>\nsimilarly if it was <br>\na=200<br>\nb=100<br>\nprint(a&lt;b) it will return false because 200 is not less than 100. <br>\nalso if it were <br>\na=200<br>\nb=100<br>\nprint(a&lt;=b) it will return false because 200 is not less than or equal to 100.</p>\n\n<p><strong>LOGICAL OPERATORS</strong><br>\nLogical operators are used to combine multiple conditions and return a Boolean result (True or False).</p>\n\n<p><strong>AND</strong>          | *<em>OR    *</em>   |<br>\nT and T = True   |T or T=True   |<br>\nT and f = False  |T or F=True   |<br>\nF and T = False  |F or T =True  |<br>\nF and F= False   |F or F =False |</p>\n\n<p>*<em>NOT *</em><br>\nThe not operator reverses the truth value of a condition.<br>\nIf the condition is True, not makes it False.<br>\nIf the condition is False, not makes it True.</p>\n\n<p><strong>ASSIGNMENT OPERATORS</strong><br>\nAssignment operators are used to assign values to variables. Besides the basic =, Python offers shorthand operators that combine an operation with assignment.<br>\n🔹 Common Assignment Operators:<br>\nOperator|  Meaning         |Example  |Explanation<br>\n=    Simple assignment     |x = 5    | Assigns 5 to x<br>\n+=   Add and assign        | x += 3  | Same as x = x + 3<br>\n-=   Subtract and assign   |x -= 2   | Same as x = x - 2<br>\n<em>=   Multiply and assign   |x *= 4   | Same as x = x * 4<br>\n/=   Divide and assign     |x /= 5   | Same as x = x / 5<br>\n//=  Floor divide and assign| x //=3  | Same as x = x // 3<br>\n%=   Modulus and assign |x %= 2  | Same as x = x % 2<br>\n*</em>=  Exponent and assign    |x *<em>= 3 | Same as x = x *</em> 3</p>\n\n<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>\n\n<p>x = 10<br>\nx += 5    # x = 10 + 5 = 15<br>\nprint(x)  # Output: 15</p>\n\n<p>x *= 2    # x = 15 * 2 = 30<br>\nprint(x)  # Output: 30</p>\n\n<p>x %= 7    # x = 30 % 7 = 2<br>\nprint(x)  # Output: 2</p>\n\n<p>Which brings this tutorial to an end.

with <em>PagedAttention</em> [<a href=\"https://blog.vllm.ai/2023/06/20/vllm.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">4</a>]</strong><br>\nvLLM utilizes <em>PagedAttention</em>, our new attention algorithm that effectively manages attention keys and values.<br>\nvLLM equipped with <em>PagedAttention</em> redefines the new state of the art in LLM serving: it delivers up to 24x higher throughput than HuggingFace Transformers, without requiring any model architecture changes.</p>\n\n<p><strong>SOSP 2023 (ACM Symposium on Operating Systems Principles): Efficient Memory Management for Large Language Model Serving with <em>PagedAttention</em> [<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.06180\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">5</a>]</strong><br>\n<em>PagedAttention</em> divides the request's KV cache into blocks, each of which can contain the attention keys and values of a fixed number of tokens.<br>\nIn <em>PagedAttention</em>, the blocks for the KV cache are not necessarily stored in contiguous space.<br>\nTherefore, we can manage the KV cache in a more flexible way as in OS's virtual memory: one can think of blocks as pages, tokens as bytes, and requests as processes.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>\n  \n  \n  Core Concepts and Motivation\n</h3>\n\n<p><em>PagedAttention</em> represents one of the fundamental technological breakthroughs that distinguishes vLLM from other LLM serving frameworks.<br>\nThis innovative approach addresses the critical memory management challenges inherent in large-scale language model deployment.</p>\n\n<p>Traditional attention mechanisms in transformer models face significant memory inefficiencies when handling variable-length sequences.<br>\nThe primary challenges include:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>\n<strong>Memory Fragmentation</strong>: Pre-allocated contiguous memory blocks for maximum sequence length</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Inefficient Utilization</strong>: Wasted memory when actual sequences are shorter than pre-allocated space</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Static Batching</strong>: Limited flexibility in request batching and scheduling</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Poor Scalability</strong>: Memory requirements grow quadratically with sequence length</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>\n  \n  \n  Virtual Memory Paradigm\n</h3>\n\n<p><em>PagedAttention</em> revolutionizes memory management by implementing a virtual memory system inspired by operating system design principles.<br>\nThe key innovation lies in treating attention computation similarly to how operating systems manage virtual memory:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Pages → Blocks</strong>: Fixed-size memory blocks containing attention keys and values</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Bytes → Tokens</strong>: Individual tokens within each block</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Processes → Requests</strong>: Individual inference requests with their own virtual address spaces</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>\n  \n  \n  Technical Implementation\n</h3>\n\n<p>The conventional approach allocates contiguous memory blocks for each sequence, leading to substantial memory fragmentation and inefficient GPU utilization.<br>\n<em>PagedAttention</em> breaks this paradigm by:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Block-based Memory Management</strong>: Dividing attention computation into fixed-size blocks</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Dynamic Memory Allocation</strong>: Enabling efficient memory reuse across different requests</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Reduced Memory Fragmentation</strong>: Minimizing wasted memory through intelligent block allocation</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Copy-on-Write Semantics</strong>: Sharing identical prefixes across multiple requests</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Non-contiguous Storage</strong>: Blocks can be stored anywhere in memory, linked through logical addressing</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>\n  \n  \n  Performance Benefits\n</h3>\n\n<p><em>PagedAttention</em> delivers remarkable memory efficiency gains, typically achieving 2-4x improvement in memory utilization compared to traditional approaches, directly translating to higher throughput and reduced infrastructure costs.

href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.08053\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">14</a>].<br>\nTherefore, I'll analyze the <code>UniProcExecutor</code>.</p>\n\n<p>The <code>UniProcExecutor</code> is designed for single-process execution scenarios where all model computation happens within a single process. This is the default choice for single-GPU deployments or when distributed execution is not required.</p>\n\n<p>Key characteristics of <code>UniProcExecutor</code>:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Single Process</strong>: All computation occurs within one process</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Direct Communication</strong>: No inter-process communication overhead</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Simplified Architecture</strong>: Straightforward execution path without distributed coordination</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Resource Efficiency</strong>: Minimal overhead for single-device scenarios</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The <code>_init_executor()</code> method initializes the worker and sets up the execution environment. The <code>rpc_rank</code> parameter represents the rank of the worker in the executor context, which is typically 0 for single-process execution.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p><a

acts like a smart filter — returning only what should be seen, and hiding what shouldn’t.</p>\n\n<h3>\n  \n  \n  🔒 Real-World Relevance\n</h3>\n\n<p>Think of situations like:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>👨‍⚖️

But you only want to show the user's name and balance on the dashboard — no PAN or password!</p></li>\n<li><p>🏥 <strong>Healthcare System</strong>: Patient data may include sensitive diagnosis history, insurance ID, and internal notes. But when accessed by reception or an external portal, only show basic details like name, age, and appointment time.</p></li>\n<li><p>📱 <strong>Social Media App</strong>: Each user has private settings, blocked users list, and email — but when you show profiles, you only show <code>username</code>, <code>bio</code>, and <code>follower count</code>.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>\n  \n  \n  ✅ With FastAPI + Pydantic:\n</h3>\n\n<ul>\n<li>You write <strong>cleaner code</strong> by separating internal and external models.</li>\n<li>You build <strong>safer APIs</strong> by preventing accidental data leaks.</li>\n<li>You help frontend developers by giving <strong>structured, predictable responses</strong>.</li>\n<li>You use <code>response_model</code> as a <strong>contract</strong> between your backend and client apps.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n\n<p>🔁 <strong>Revisit any day in the series</strong> or explore the full repo on GitHub (coming soon!).<br><br>\n🔔 Don’t forget to <strong>share what you learned</strong> and <strong>follow for more!</strong></p>\n\n<p>🧠 “Good APIs don’t just work — they protect, structure, and guide.”<br><br>\nSee you in the next lesson! 👋</p>\n\n\n\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  🙏 Credits\n</h2>\n\n<p>Huge thanks to the <a href=\"https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">FastAPI Official Documentation</a> by <strong>Sebastián Ramírez (<a class=\"mentioned-user\" href=\"https://dev.to/tiangolo\">@tiangolo</a>)</strong> — the best place to learn and explore everything about FastAPI.</p>\n\n\n\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  👨‍💻 About Me\n</h2>\n\n<p>Hey there!

But we can\nconfuse the escape analysis sufficiently by always keeping two instances alive\nat the same time:</p><div><pre></pre></div><p>(I confirmed that the allocation isn't being removed by looking at the C code\nthat the RPython compiler generates from this.)</p><p>This is doing a little bit more work than needed, because of the \ninstance attribute write. We can also (optionally) leave the field\nuninitialized.</p><div><pre></pre></div><p>Then we need to add some RPython scaffolding:</p><div><pre></pre></div><div><pre></pre></div><p>Which will turn the RPython code into C code and use a C compiler to turn that\ninto a binary, containing both our code above as well as the RPython garbage\ncollector.</p><p>Then we can run it (all results again from my AMD Ryzen 7 PRO 7840U, running\nUbuntu Linux 24.04.2):</p><div><pre>./targetallocatealot-c./targetallocatealot-c</pre></div><p>Let's compare it with the Boehm GC:</p><div><pre>pypyrpython/bin/rpython--gcboehm--outputtargetallocatealot-c-boehmtargetallocatealot.py./targetallocatealot-c-boehm./targetallocatealot-c-boehm</pre></div><p>This is not a fair comparison, because the Boehm GC uses conservative stack\nscanning, therefore it cannot move objects, which requires much more\ncomplicated allocation.</p><p>We can use  to get some statistics about the executions:</p><div><pre>perfstat-ecache-references,cache-misses,cycles,instructions,branches,faults,migrations./targetallocatealot-cperfstat-ecache-references,cache-misses,cycles,instructions,branches,faults,migrations./targetallocatealot-c</pre></div><p>This is pretty cool, we can run this loop with &gt;5 instructions per cycle. Every\nallocation takes <code>110116790943 / 10000000000 ≈ 11</code> instructions and\n<code>21074240395 / 10000000000 ≈ 2.1</code> cycles, including the loop around it.</p><h3>How often does the GC run?</h3><p>The RPython GC queries the L2 cache size to determine the size of the nursery.\nWe can find out what it is by turning on PYPYLOG, selecting the proper logging\ncategories, and printing to  via :</p><div><pre>gc-set-nursery-size,gc-hardware:-./targetallocatealot-c</pre></div><p>So the nursery is 4 MiB. This means that when we allocate 14.9 GiB the GC needs to perform <code>10000000000 * 16 / 4194304 ≈ 38146</code> minor collections. Let's confirm that:</p><div><pre>gc-minor:out./targetallocatealot-cheadout\ngrepoutwc-l\n</pre></div><p>Each minor collection is very quick, because a minor collection is\nO(surviving objects), and in this program only one object survive each time\n(the other instance is in the process of being allocated).\nAlso, the GC root shadow stack is only one entry, so walking that is super\nquick as well. The time the minor collections take is logged to the out file:</p><div><pre>grepouttail\ngrepoutgrep-onumsum\n</pre></div><p>(This number is super approximate due to float formatting rounding.)</p><p>that means that <code>0.0988160000000011 / 5.315511 ≈ 2%</code> of the time is spent in the GC.</p><h3>What does the generated machine code look like?</h3><p>The allocation fast path of the RPython GC is a simple bump pointer, in Python\npseudo-code it would look roughly like this:</p><div><pre></pre></div><p>So we can disassemble the compiled binary  and try to\nfind the equivalent logic in machine code. I'm super bad at reading machine\ncode, but I tried to annotate what I think is the core loop (the version\nwithout initializing the  field) below:</p><div><pre></pre></div><h3>Running the benchmark as regular Python code</h3><p>So far we ran this code as , i.e. type inference is performed and the\nprogram is translated to a C binary. We can also run it on top of PyPy, as a\nregular Python3 program. However, an instance of a user-defined class in regular\nPython when run on PyPy is actually a much larger object, due to <a href=\"https://pypy.org/posts/2010/11/efficiently-implementing-python-objects-3838329944323946932.html\">dynamic\ntyping</a>.\nIt's at least 7 words, which is 56 bytes.</p><p>However, we can simply use  objects instead. Integers are allocated on the\nheap and consist of two words, one for the GC and one with the\nmachine-word-sized integer value, if the integer fits into a signed 64-bit\nrepresentation (otherwise a less compact different representation is used,\nwhich can represent arbitrarily large integers).</p><p>Therefore, we can simply use this kind of code:</p><div><pre></pre></div><p>In this case we can't really leave the value uninitialized though.</p><p>We can run this both with and without the JIT:</p><div><pre>pypy3allocatealot.pypypy3--jitoffallocatealot.py</pre></div><p>This is obviously much less efficient than the C code, the PyPy JIT generates\nmuch less efficient machine code than GCC. Still, \"only\" twice as slow is kind\nof cool anyway.</p><p>(Running it with CPython doesn't really make sense for this measurements, since\nCPython ints are bigger –  reports 28 bytes.)</p><h3>The machine code that the JIT generates</h3><p>Unfortunately it's a bit of a journey to show the machine code that PyPy's JIT generates for this. First we need to run with all jit logging categories:</p><div><pre>jit:outpypy3allocatealot.py</pre></div><p>Then we can read the log file to find the trace IR for the loop under the logging category :</p><div><pre></pre></div><p>To find the machine code address of the trace, we need to search for this line:</p><div><pre>\\\n</pre></div><p>Then we can use a script in the PyPy repo to disassemble the generated machine code:</p><div><pre>pypyrpython/jit/backend/tool/viewcode.pyout\n</pre></div><p>This will dump all the machine code to stdout, and open a <a href=\"https://pypy.org/posts/2021/04/ways-pypy-graphviz.html\">pygame-based\ngraphviz cfg</a>. In there\nwe can search for the address and see this:</p><p>Here's an annotated version with what I think this code does:</p><div><pre></pre></div><p>The careful design of the RPython GC's allocation fast path gives pretty good\nallocation rates. This technique isn't really new, it's a pretty typical way to\ndesign a GC. Apart from that, my main conclusion would be that computers are\nfast or something? Indeed, when we ran the same code on my colleague's\ntwo-year-old AMD, we got quite a bit worse results, so a lot of the speed seems\nto be due to the hard work of CPU architects.</p>","contentLength":6076,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"🎯 Build “Target Collector” Using Amazon Q CLI and Pygame on Linux","url":"https://dev.to/adwitya_chakraborty_2235f/build-target-collector-using-amazon-q-cli-and-pygame-on-linux-3c5h","date":1749993886,"author":"Adwitya Chakraborty","guid":155609,"unread":true,"content":"<p>Remember those fast-paced arcade games where every second counts?<br>\nLet’s recreate that thrill with Target Collector, a simple reflex-based game built using <strong>Python</strong>, <strong>Pygame</strong>, and the AI-powered <strong>Amazon Q CLI</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>With Amazon Q CLI, you can generate and modify code in your terminal using plain English prompts — and combining that with Pygame makes the development process smoother and more interactive, especially on a Linux system.</p>\n\n<p><strong>🛠️ What You'll Need</strong><br>\nTo build Target Collector, I used the following tools:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Amazon Q CLI</strong> – An AI command-line coding assistant</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Python 3.8+</strong> – The language driving our game</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Pygame</strong> – A powerful library for building games in Python</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Linux (Ubuntu/Debian)</strong> – Recommended environment for easy setup</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>⚙️ Setting Up the Development Environment (Linux)</strong><br>\n<strong>Step 1: Install Dependencies</strong><br>\nOpen your terminal and run:<br>\n</p>\n\n<div class=\"highlight js-code-highlight\">\n<pre class=\"highlight plaintext\"><code>sudo apt update\nsudo apt install -y python3 python3-pip python3-venv git\n</code></pre>\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Step 2: Install Pygame</strong><br>\n</p>\n\n<div class=\"highlight js-code-highlight\">\n<pre class=\"highlight plaintext\"><code>pip3 install pygame\n</code></pre>\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>💻 Installing Amazon Q CLI on Linux</strong><br>\nAmazon provides a .deb installer for easy setup.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Step 1: Download the Installer</strong><br>\n</p>\n\n<div class=\"highlight js-code-highlight\">\n<pre class=\"highlight plaintext\"><code>\nwget https://desktop-release.q.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/latest/amazon-q.deb\n</code></pre>\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Step 2: Install Using dpkg</strong><br>\n</p>\n\n<div class=\"highlight js-code-highlight\">\n<pre class=\"highlight plaintext\"><code>sudo dpkg -i amazon-q.deb\n</code></pre>\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Step 3: Fix Any Dependency Issues</strong><br>\n</p>\n\n<div class=\"highlight js-code-highlight\">\n<pre class=\"highlight plaintext\"><code>sudo apt-get install -f\n</code></pre>\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Step 4: Verify Installation</strong><br>\n</p>\n\n<div class=\"highlight js-code-highlight\">\n<pre class=\"highlight plaintext\"><code>q --version\n</code></pre>\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>You should see the Amazon Q CLI version printed in your terminal.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Step 5: Launch the Interactive Chat</strong><br>\n</p>\n\n<div class=\"highlight js-code-highlight\">\n<pre class=\"highlight plaintext\"><code>q chat\n</code></pre>\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2F9pe2t4glmr68eir2nzlj.png\" class=\"article-body-image-wrapper\"><img src=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2F9pe2t4glmr68eir2nzlj.png\" alt=\"amazonqcli\" width=\"800\" height=\"423\"></a></p>\n\n<p>You're now ready to build with the help of Amazon Q!</p>\n\n<p><strong>🧠 Building the Game with Amazon Q CLI</strong><br>\nWith everything set up, I started developing the game by feeding prompts into Q CLI. Here's how the game came together, one feature at a time.</p>\n\n<p><strong>🎮 Game Concept</strong><br>\nIn Target Collector, you control a blue dot using arrow keys. Yellow targets appear randomly on the screen. You must reach each one within 5 seconds. If you do, your score increases. If not — game over!</p>\n\n<p><strong>🧱 Step-by-Step Prompts and Features</strong></p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Creating the Game Window and Player Movement\nPrompt:</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>“Create a game using Pygame where the player is a blue circle that moves with arrow keys in a 600x400 window.”</p>\n\n<p>Q CLI Outcome:</p>\n\n<p>Set up the window</p>\n\n<p>Added player movement</p>\n\n<p>Rendered the player as a blue circle</p>\n\n<p><strong>2. Spawning Targets Randomly</strong><br>\nPrompt:</p>\n\n<p>“Add yellow target circles that spawn at random positions and must be collected within 5 seconds.”</p>\n\n<p>Outcome:</p>\n\n<p>Targets appear randomly</p>\n\n<p>A timer starts as soon as one spawns</p>\n\n<p>Game ends if the player doesn’t collect it in time</p>\n\n<p><strong>3. Visual Timer</strong><br>\nPrompt:</p>\n\n<p>“Show a timer bar at the top of the screen that shrinks over 5 seconds.”</p>\n\n<p>Outcome:</p>\n\n<p>Timer bar dynamically decreases</p>\n\n<p>Immediate visual feedback on how much time is left</p>\n\n<p><strong>4. Scoring System</strong><br>\nPrompt:</p>\n\n<p>“Display a score at the top-left that increases each time a target is collected.”</p>\n\n<p>Outcome:</p>\n\n<p>Score starts at 0</p>\n\n<p>Increases with each successful target</p>\n\n<p>Updates in real-time on screen</p>\n\n<p><strong>5. Game Over and Restart</strong><br>\nPrompt:</p>\n\n<p>“On game over, show a message with the final score and allow the player to press R to restart.”</p>\n\n<p>Outcome:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fbp26xz1iopyjz5hmswxt.png\" class=\"article-body-image-wrapper\"><img src=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fbp26xz1iopyjz5hmswxt.png\" alt=\"game\" width=\"800\" height=\"424\"></a></p>\n\n<p>Game over screen with final score</p>\n\n<p>Option to press R to reset the game</p>\n\n<p><strong>✅ Final Feature Summary</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>🕹️ Smooth arrow-key movement</li>\n<li>🎯 Randomly spawning yellow targets</li>\n<li>⏳ Shrinking timer bar</li>\n<li>🔢 Real-time score display</li>\n<li>💀 Game over screen + restart support</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>🤖 Why I Used Amazon Q CLI</strong><br>\nAmazon Q CLI acted like a real-time coding assistant. Instead of Googling syntax or writing logic from scratch, I used prompts to guide development:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>It helped generate structured code quickly</li>\n<li>I got instant suggestions and bug fixes</li>\n<li>It allowed for rapid prototyping and iteration</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Perfect for solo developers or beginners looking to learn as they build.</p>\n\n<p><strong>🚀 Wrapping Up</strong><br>\nWith just Python, Pygame, and a few well-thought-out prompts in Amazon Q CLI, I built a complete, playable version of Target Collector in record time.</p>\n\n<p>Want to take it further? Try adding:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>A countdown sound effect</li>\n<li>Dynamic difficulty (timer shrinks faster over time)</li>\n<li>Persistent high scores stored in a file</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>📂 Try It Yourself</strong><br>\nYou can run the game like this:<br>\n</p>\n\n<div class=\"highlight js-code-highlight\">\n<pre class=\"highlight plaintext\"><code>python3 target_collector.py\n</code></pre>\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>Use the arrow keys to move. Collect yellow targets before time runs out. Press R to restart after the game ends.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks for reading!<br>\nIf you liked this post, consider leaving a 👏 or commenting on what game you’d like to build next using AI + Python.

Copilot never ceases to amaze me. At work I was struggling with understand a <a href=\"https://nginx.org/en/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">nginx</a> configuration file that was written by some one else. Copilot's explanation made everything make sense, and answered some questions I asked. This is something that Stack Overflow simple cannot do.</p>\n\n<p>Nearly every developer should be making good use of AI agents today, especially given that Copilot now has a very generous <a href=\"https://code.visualstudio.com/blogs/2024/12/18/free-github-copilot\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">free tier</a> for Visual Studio Code. For me, work pay for the premium plans.</p>\n\n<p>I read an interesting article this week about how Canva are encouraging potential employees to <a href=\"https://www.canva.dev/blog/engineering/yes-you-can-use-ai-in-our-interviews/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">use AI in interviews</a>. It discusses how they frame questions so AI can assist, but still require the interviewee to turn the requirements in to working code.</p>\n\n<p>Any way, back to <del>my</del> Copilot's solution. I'll let Copilot explain it.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>The <code>final_price</code> function calculates the final price for each item in a list after applying a specific discount rule. For each item in the prices list, the function looks for the first subsequent item (to the right) whose price is less than or equal to the current item's price. If such an item is found, its price is used as a discount for the current item; otherwise, no discount is applied (the discount remains zero).</p>\n\n<p>The function iterates through the list using a for-loop with index <code>i</code>. For each item at position <code>i</code>, it initializes a discount variable to zero. Then, it uses another for-loop with index <code>j</code> (starting from <code>i + 1</code>) to search for the first qualifying discount. If it finds a price at <code>j</code> that is less than or equal to the price at <code>i</code>, it sets discount to that value and breaks out of the inner loop. After determining the discount, it subtracts the discount from the original price and appends the result to the <code>solution</code> list (array in Perl). Once all items have been processed, the function returns the solution list containing the final prices after discounts.</p>\n\n<p>This approach ensures that each item's discount is determined only by the first qualifying item to its right, which matches the typical \"next smaller or equal element\" discount pattern seen in some shopping scenarios.

Data types can be divided into numeric data types (integers, floating point numbers and complex numbers ), strings and boolean. <br>\n<strong>Integers</strong>: represent whole numbers which can be negative, positive or zero. e.g x=0, y=12, z=-15. <br>\n<strong>Floating point numbers</strong>: represent decimal point numbers. e.g x=12.021, y= -30.12, z= 0.0<br>\n<strong>Complex numbers</strong>:this represents numbers with a real and an imaginary part.<br>\ne.g z=3+4j. 3 being the real part and 4j being the imaginary part. <br>\n<strong>Booleans</strong>: represent truth values and can only return two outcomes: true or false. e.g <br>\na=100 <br>\nb= 40 <br>\nc= a&gt;b <br>\nprint (c).<br><br>\nWhat happens here?</p>\n\n<div class=\"highlight js-code-highlight\">\n<pre class=\"highlight plaintext\"><code>a = 100 this assigns the value 100 to the variable a.\n\nb = 40 this assigns the value 40 to the variable b.\n\nc = a &gt; b compares a and b using the &gt; (greater than) operator.\n</code></pre>\n\n</div>\n\n<p>Why is c boolean?</p>\n\n<p>The expression a &gt; b asks: \"Is 100 greater than 40?\" This comparison results in either:</p>\n\n<div class=\"highlight js-code-highlight\">\n<pre class=\"highlight plaintext\"><code>True if the statement is correct (100 is greater than 40), or\n\nFalse if the statement is not correct.\n</code></pre>\n\n</div>\n\n<p>Since the result of this comparison is either True or False, the type of c is boolean (bool in Python), which is the data type used to represent truth values.<br>\nSo, when you run print(c), you get:</p>\n\n<p>True</p>\n\n<p>because 100 is indeed greater than 40.</p>\n\n<p>The last data type to consider is strings. A string in python can simply be defined as a sequence of characters that are enclosed in quotes.Strings are used to represent Texts. <br>\ne.g a= \"Alice\"<br>\n    b= 'Hello World!'<br>\n    c= \"Python is fun\"<br>\n<strong>Key points about strings in Python:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>You can use single quotes ('...') or double quotes (\"...\") to create a string.</li>\n<li>Strings can contain letters, numbers, spaces, symbols — basically anything you can type.</li>\n<li>Strings are immutable, which means once created, you can’t change individual characters inside them (but you can create new strings based on them).</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Example</strong>:</p>\n\n<p>message = \"Hello\"<br>\nprint(message)  # Output: Hello<br>\nprint(type(message))  # Output: <br>\nHere, message is a string variable.</p>\n\n<p>Lastly, we will be looking at what a variable is. A variable in Python is like a container that holds a value.<br>\nThink of it like this:Imagine a labeled box where you can store something — a variable is the labeled box, and the value is what's inside the box.<br>\nFor example:<br>\nx = 5<br>\nname = \"Alice\"<br>\nis_happy = True</p>\n\n<p><strong>x</strong> is a variable that stores the number 5<br>\n<strong>name</strong> stores the string \"Alice\"<br>\n<strong>is_happy</strong> stores the boolean value True</p>\n\n<p><strong>Rules for variables in Python:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Variable names must start with a letter or an underscore _.</li>\n<li>They can contain letters, numbers, and underscores — but no spaces.</li>\n<li>Python is case-sensitive, so Name and name are different variables.</li>\n<li>You don’t need to declare a type — Python figures it out automatically.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>This brings an end to the tutorial on basics of python programming . In the next lesson we will be exploring Python Operations. </p>\n\n","contentLength":0,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Sets - Python","url":"https://dev.to/datatoinfinity/sets-python-14fa","date":1749987307,"author":"datatoinfinity","guid":155554,"unread":true,"content":"<p>Set is a built-in data type that represents an unordered collection of unique elements.

Nós sabemos que a resposta está ali, em algum lugar, perdida no meio de centenas de arquivos SQL, Python ou YAML. Usar grep ou a busca nativa do editor resolve problemas pontuais, mas e se você pudesse simplesmente conversar com seu código?</p>\n\n<p>Mais do que apenas criar uma ferramenta útil, este artigo é um guia prático para quem deseja estudar e aplicar conceitos de Inteligência Artificial. Ao construir este projeto, você ganhará experiência hands-on com LLMs, a arquitetura RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation), bancos de dados vetoriais e, crucialmente, técnicas de pré-processamento de dados que são a base para qualquer sistema de IA eficaz.</p>\n\n<p>Neste guia, vamos construir um sistema de busca que roda inteiramente na sua máquina, de forma 100% privada, e responde a perguntas como:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><em>\"Quem é o responsável pela DAG <code>X</code>?\"</em></li>\n<li><em>\"Qual a finalidade da função <code>Y</code>?\"</em></li>\n<li><em>\"Mostre-me as queries que utilizam a tabela <code>XYZ</code>.\"</em></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Ao final, você terá uma ferramenta de linha de comando que pode ser adaptada para qualquer projeto. Vamos começar!</p>\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  Parte 1: A Ideia - Desvendando o RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)\n</h2>\n\n<p>A mágica por trás da nossa ferramenta se chama <strong>RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)</strong>. O nome pode parecer complexo, mas a ideia é simples e engenhosa: unimos o poder de uma busca eficiente com a capacidade de interpretação de um Modelo de Linguagem Grande (LLM), como o <code>GPT</code> ou o <code>Gemma</code>.</p>\n\n<p>O processo funciona em três etapas:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p><strong>A Base de Conhecimento (Vector Store):</strong> Não é viável enviar o repositório inteiro diretamente para o LLM. Por isso, primeiro, indexamos todo o conteúdo. Um script percorre cada arquivo, o divide em trechos lógicos (chunks) e utiliza um \"modelo de embedding\" para converter cada trecho em um vetor numérico. Esses vetores são armazenados em um banco de dados vetorial local. Pense nisso como a criação de um índice superinteligente para o seu código.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>O Detetive Inteligente (Retriever):</strong> Quando você faz uma pergunta, ela também é convertida em um vetor. O trabalho do \"detetive\" é buscar no banco de dados os vetores de código que mais se assemelham semanticamente ao vetor da sua pergunta. Nosso detetive será ainda mais esperto, utilizando o próprio LLM para pré-filtrar a busca (por exemplo, ao perguntar sobre a DAG X, ele focará apenas nos arquivos relacionados a ela).</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>O Intérprete (LLM):</strong> Por fim, os trechos de código mais relevantes encontrados pelo detetive são entregues ao LLM junto com a sua pergunta original. Com esse contexto \"mastigado\", o LLM consegue formular uma resposta precisa e direta, sem alucinações ou informações inventadas.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>O melhor de tudo? <strong>É tudo local!</strong> Seu código nunca sai da sua máquina. Não são necessárias chaves de API, nem conexão com a internet.</p>\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  Parte 2: Mãos à Obra - Preparando o Ambiente\n</h2>\n\n<p>Vamos reunir as ferramentas necessárias para o nosso projeto.</p>\n\n<h3>\n  \n  \n  Ambiente Python\n</h3>\n\n<p>Primeiro, certifique-se de ter o Python 3.8 (ou superior) instalado.

Em vez de tratar todos os arquivos como texto genérico, este módulo os analisa para extrair informações estruturadas e valiosas. É aqui que definimos o <code>page_content</code> e os <code>metadata</code> de cada \"documento\".</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>⚠️ Atenção: Ponto Crucial de Customização!</strong><br>\nAs classes de processamento (<code>YamlProcessor</code>, <code>SqlProcessor</code>, etc.) foram desenhadas para uma estrutura de projeto específica. O seu repositório provavelmente terá uma organização diferente.</p>\n\n<p>Pense neste código como um template. A estratégia fundamental é criar \"chunks\" de informação inteligentes. Você precisará adaptar a lógica dentro de cada classe <code>process</code> para que ela entenda e extraia as informações mais relevantes do <strong>seu</strong> contexto.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>A importância de <code>page_content</code> e <code>metadata</code></strong></p>\n\n<p>Definir bem esses dois parâmetros é o segredo para uma busca precisa. Pense neles como uma ficha de catalogação de uma biblioteca:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>page_content (O Conteúdo do Livro):</strong> É o texto que será efetivamente \"lido\" e vetorizado. Um <code>page_content</code> claro e rico em contexto gera uma representação vetorial muito mais fiel. Por exemplo, a frase <em>\"Este documento descreve a DAG com ID 'dag_exemplo'. O proprietário é 'ana.silva'.\"</em> tem um significado semântico muito mais forte do que um bloco YAML bruto. É também esse conteúdo que o LLM usará para formular a resposta final.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>metadata (A Etiqueta na Lombada):</strong> São os dados que descrevem o conteúdo, como <code>dag_id</code>, <code>table_name</code>, <code>author</code>, etc. A função mais poderosa do <code>metadata</code> é permitir a <strong>filtragem inteligente</strong>. Quando usamos um <code>SelfQueryRetriever</code>, ele primeiro usa os metadados para filtrar os documentos relevantes e <em>só então</em> faz a busca por similaridade semântica. Isso torna a busca dramaticamente mais rápida e precisa, evitando que o sistema se confunda com informações de arquivos não relacionados.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n</li>\n\n<li><p><strong><a href=\"https://github.com/richardson-souza/Ctrl-F-on-Steroids/blob/master/vector_store.py\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">vector_store.py</a></strong><br><br>\nEste arquivo gerencia a criação e o carregamento do nosso banco de dados vetorial persistente (ChromaDB).</p></li>\n\n<li><p><strong><a href=\"https://github.com/richardson-souza/Ctrl-F-on-Steroids/blob/master/indexer.py\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">indexer.py</a></strong><br><br>\nUm script independente que você executa uma única vez (ou sempre que houver mudanças significativas no código) para popular o banco de dados vetorial.</p></li>\n\n<li><p><strong><a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=https://github.com/richardson-souza/Ctrl-F-on-Steroids/blob/master/ask.py\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">ask.py</a></strong><br><br>\nEste é o script interativo para fazer perguntas ao seu código.

While the ultimate vision of fault-tolerant quantum computers is still on the horizon, the field of QML is not merely a theoretical construct. Today, developers and researchers can actively explore practical applications using existing quantum hardware and robust open-source libraries. This article moves beyond the abstract to showcase tangible examples of what you can achieve with QML right now, even with the inherent limitations of current quantum systems like qubit count and error rates. These challenges are actively being addressed through ongoing research and engineering, paving the way for increasingly sophisticated applications.</p>\n\n<h3>\n  \n  \n  The Power of Hybrid Algorithms\n</h3>\n\n<p>The most viable and widely adopted approach in contemporary QML is the use of hybrid quantum-classical algorithms. These algorithms leverage the strengths of both computational paradigms: quantum computers excel at specific, computationally intensive sub-routines that exploit quantum phenomena like superposition and entanglement, while classical computers handle the bulk of data processing, optimization, and overall algorithm control. This synergy allows us to tackle problems that might be intractable for classical computers alone, even with noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices. Quantum processors might be used for tasks such as generating quantum features, performing quantum Fourier transforms, or executing variational quantum circuits, while classical processors manage data preprocessing, optimization loops, and post-processing of quantum measurement results. This collaborative model is a cornerstone of current practical QML.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Foan53eluc5qlc3evwogf.webp\" class=\"article-body-image-wrapper\"><img src=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Foan53eluc5qlc3evwogf.webp\" alt=\"An abstract illustration representing the interaction between a classical computer and a quantum computer in a hybrid algorithm.

The core idea is to map classical data into a higher-dimensional quantum feature space, where it might become linearly separable, even if it wasn't in the original classical space. This mapping is performed by a quantum circuit, known as a quantum feature map.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Example:</strong> Consider a simple binary classification problem, like distinguishing between two classes within the Iris dataset. A quantum kernel can be constructed to potentially find a more effective decision boundary than a purely classical kernel.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Conceptual Code (using Qiskit's <code>QuantumKernel</code>):</strong><br>\n</p>\n\n<div class=\"highlight js-code-highlight\">\n<pre class=\"highlight python\"><code><span class=\"c1\"># from qiskit.algorithms.kernels import QuantumKernel\n# from qiskit.utils import QuantumInstance\n# from qiskit.circuit.library import ZZFeatureMap\n# from sklearn.svm import SVC\n# from sklearn.datasets import load_iris\n# from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\n</span>\n<span class=\"c1\"># Load dataset\n# X, y = load_iris(return_X_y=True)\n# X = X[y != 2] # Binary classification example\n# y = y[y != 2]\n</span>\n<span class=\"c1\"># Split data\n# X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)\n</span>\n<span class=\"c1\"># Define a quantum feature map\n# feature_map = ZZFeatureMap(feature_dimension=X.shape[1], reps=2)\n</span>\n<span class=\"c1\"># Set up a quantum instance (e.g., a simulator)\n# quantum_instance = QuantumInstance(Aer.get_backend('qasm_simulator'), shots=1024)\n</span>\n<span class=\"c1\"># Create the QuantumKernel\n# quantum_kernel = QuantumKernel(feature_map=feature_map, quantum_instance=quantum_instance)\n</span>\n<span class=\"c1\"># Initialize and train the SVM with the quantum kernel\n# svc = SVC(kernel=quantum_kernel.evaluate)\n# svc.fit(X_train, y_train)\n</span>\n<span class=\"c1\"># Evaluate the model\n# accuracy = svc.score(X_test, y_test)\n# print(f\"Quantum Kernel SVM Accuracy: {accuracy}\")\n</span></code></pre>\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>This conceptual example demonstrates how a <code>ZZFeatureMap</code> can encode classical data into a quantum state, and then how <code>QuantumKernel</code> computes the similarity between these quantum states, which is then used by a classical <code>SVC</code> from scikit-learn. You can find more detailed examples in the <a href=\"https://qiskit.org/documentation/tutorials/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Qiskit tutorials</a>.</p>\n\n<h4>\n  \n  \n  Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) for Optimization\n</h4>\n\n<p>While VQE is a cornerstone of quantum chemistry for finding the ground state energy of molecules, its underlying principle—variational optimization—can be extended to solve various optimization problems. VQE works by preparing a quantum state with a parameterized quantum circuit (ansatz) and then classically optimizing these parameters to minimize an objective function (Hamiltonian) measured on the quantum computer.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Example:</strong> A simplified application could be finding the ground state of a small molecule like H2 or solving a basic combinatorial optimization problem, such as the Max-Cut problem on a tiny graph.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Conceptual Code (using PennyLane for VQE):</strong><br>\n</p>\n\n<div class=\"highlight js-code-highlight\">\n<pre class=\"highlight python\"><code><span class=\"c1\"># import pennylane as qml\n# from pennylane import numpy as np\n</span>\n<span class=\"c1\"># Define the quantum device\n# dev = qml.device(\"default.qubit\", wires=2)\n</span>\n<span class=\"c1\"># Define the Hamiltonian for a simple problem (e.g., H2 molecule simplified)\n# H = qml.Hamiltonian([1.0, -0.5], [qml.PauliZ(0), qml.PauliX(0) @ qml.PauliX(1)])\n</span>\n<span class=\"c1\"># Define the parameterized ansatz circuit\n# @qml.qnode(dev)\n# def circuit(params):\n#     qml.RX(params[0], wires=0)\n#     qml.RY(params[1], wires=1)\n#     qml.CNOT(wires=[0, 1])\n#     qml.RZ(params[2], wires=1)\n#     return qml.expval(H)\n</span>\n<span class=\"c1\"># Initialize parameters\n# params = np.array([0.54, 0.12, 0.65], requires_grad=True)\n</span>\n<span class=\"c1\"># Define the optimizer\n# opt = qml.GradientDescentOptimizer(stepsize=0.4)\n</span>\n<span class=\"c1\"># Optimization loop\n# for i in range(50):\n#     params, energy = opt.step_and_cost(circuit, params)\n#     if i % 10 == 0:\n#         print(f\"Step {i}, Energy: {energy:.4f}\")\n</span>\n<span class=\"c1\"># print(f\"Optimized energy: {energy:.4f}\")\n</span></code></pre>\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>This snippet illustrates the basic structure of a VQE algorithm: a quantum circuit with tunable parameters, an objective function (Hamiltonian), and a classical optimizer.

It has a dedicated Qiskit Machine Learning module for QML applications. IBM also offers the IBM Quantum Experience for accessing real quantum hardware.</li>\n<li>  <strong>PennyLane:</strong> Developed by Xanadu, PennyLane is a quantum machine learning library that integrates with popular classical ML frameworks like PyTorch and TensorFlow. It's known for its differentiable programming approach, making it intuitive for ML practitioners.</li>\n<li>  <strong>Cirq:</strong> Google's open-source framework for programming quantum computers. While more focused on quantum circuits, it can be used to build QML algorithms, especially for those interested in lower-level control. Google also provides access to quantum resources through Google Cloud Quantum AI.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The choice of tool often depends on your existing expertise and the specific problem you're trying to solve. PennyLane's integration with classical ML frameworks makes it a strong contender for those with a deep ML background, while Qiskit offers a broad range of quantum computing functionalities.</p>\n\n<h3>\n  \n  \n  Accessing Quantum Hardware and Simulators\n</h3>\n\n<p>You don't need a quantum computer in your lab to start experimenting. Most QML development begins with quantum simulators, which run on classical computers and emulate quantum behavior.

Behind these seemingly magical feats lies a powerful technology inspired by the human brain: neural networks. These aren't networks of actual neurons, but rather sophisticated computer programs designed to mimic the way our brains learn and process information. This article will provide a clear and accessible introduction to this fascinating field, exploring its core concepts, applications, and future implications.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Understanding the Basics: Mimicking the Brain</strong></p>\n\n<p>At its core, a neural network is a system of interconnected nodes, or \"neurons,\" organized in layers. Imagine a simplified model of your brain: information (like an image of a cat) enters through your eyes (input layer). This information is then processed by various parts of your brain (hidden layers), eventually leading to you identifying the image as a \"cat\" (output layer). A neural network works similarly.</p>\n\n<p>Each connection between neurons has a \"weight,\" representing the strength of the connection. When information enters the network, it travels through these connections, with each neuron performing a simple calculation based on the input it receives and the weights of its connections. This process continues through the hidden layers, until a final output is produced.</p>\n\n<p>The \"learning\" part happens through a process called \"training.\" This involves feeding the network a massive dataset (e.g., thousands of images of cats and dogs) and adjusting the weights of the connections based on how accurately it classifies the images. If the network incorrectly identifies a cat as a dog, the weights are adjusted to improve its future performance. This iterative process of adjusting weights based on errors is akin to how we learn from our mistakes. The network essentially \"learns\" the patterns and relationships within the data.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Why Neural Networks Matter: Solving Complex Problems</strong></p>\n\n<p>Neural networks excel at tackling problems that are too complex for traditional programming approaches. Unlike traditional programs that rely on explicit instructions, neural networks learn from data, allowing them to identify patterns and make predictions even in situations with noisy or incomplete information. This makes them invaluable in various fields:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Image Recognition:</strong> Identifying objects, faces, and scenes in images and videos, crucial for applications like self-driving cars and medical image analysis.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Natural Language Processing:</strong> Understanding and generating human language, powering chatbots, machine translation, and sentiment analysis.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Predictive Modeling:</strong> Forecasting future events based on historical data, used in finance (stock prediction), weather forecasting, and healthcare (disease prediction).</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Recommendation Systems:</strong> Suggesting products, movies, or music based on user preferences, a cornerstone of e-commerce and entertainment platforms.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Applications and Transformative Impact:</strong></p>\n\n<p>The impact of neural networks is already profound and continues to grow. Consider these examples:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Healthcare:</strong>  Early detection of diseases through medical image analysis, personalized medicine based on patient data, and drug discovery.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Finance:</strong> Fraud detection, algorithmic trading, risk assessment, and customer service chatbots.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Manufacturing:</strong> Predictive maintenance of machinery, quality control, and process optimization.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Transportation:</strong> Self-driving cars, traffic optimization, and autonomous drones.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Challenges, Limitations, and Ethical Considerations:</strong></p>\n\n<p>Despite their potential, neural networks face several challenges:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Data Dependency:</strong> They require massive amounts of high-quality data to train effectively.  Bias in the data can lead to biased outcomes, perpetuating societal inequalities.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Computational Cost:</strong> Training large neural networks can be computationally expensive and time-consuming, requiring powerful hardware.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Explainability (\"Black Box\" Problem):</strong>  Understanding why a neural network makes a particular prediction can be difficult, raising concerns about transparency and accountability.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Ethical Concerns:</strong>  Bias in algorithms, job displacement due to automation, and the potential misuse of facial recognition technology are significant ethical considerations.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>The Future of Neural Networks:</strong></p>\n\n<p>Neural networks are a rapidly evolving field, with ongoing research focusing on improving their efficiency, explainability, and robustness. The development of more powerful hardware, innovative algorithms, and techniques to mitigate bias will be crucial for unlocking their full potential. We can expect to see even more transformative applications in the coming years, impacting virtually every aspect of our lives. However, addressing the ethical challenges associated with this powerful technology remains paramount to ensuring its responsible and beneficial use. The future of neural networks is bright, but navigating its ethical complexities will be crucial for a positive and equitable impact on society.</p>\n\n","contentLength":0,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"🔢 Beginner-Friendly Guide \"Maximize the Digit Swap Difference\" – LeetCode 1432 (C++ | Python | JavaScript)","url":"https://dev.to/om_shree_0709/beginner-friendly-guide-maximize-the-digit-swap-difference-leetcode-1432-c-python--3f5e","date":1749947017,"author":"Om Shree","guid":155295,"unread":true,"content":"<p><em>A Fun String Manipulation + Greedy Problem</em></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p>Hey Devs! 👋</p>\n\n<p>Let’s decode another cool number-manipulation problem today: <strong>1432.

He had spoken to the CEO and arranged for me to start. He even gave me access to older projects to study the coding standards and style.</p>\n\n<p>This was more than an opportunity.

From mainframes to servers to virtualization to cloud and everything in-between (and after). One thing, despite the constant change, always stays the same. Engineers and leadership teams want the ability to move faster, yet stay efficient and performant.</p>\n\n<p>What AI (in reference to LLMs) gives us at this time is exactly that.</p>\n\n<p>In this blog post, you'll learn why you should think about using AI in DevOps and how to jump in with one example, prompting Terraform configuration.</p>\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  Why Should We Use AI in DevOps?\n</h2>\n\n<p>There was a time where the only way to actually write code was to write your own editor or write it on a piece of paper with a pen. There was also a time when you had to build your own garbage collection (memory management) and compilers. Now, we have high-level programming languages with built-in garbage collection. We can write code in fancy editors that have plugins that do everything from make us more effective (ahem, <code>git blame</code> anyone?) and we can even change the color of our IDE <em>sparkle sparkle</em>.</p>\n\n<p>Throughout time, things in engineering have changed drastically and in a very short amount of time (software engineering is only 65 years old... that's 1 person ago). That's innovation and moving the needle; it's what we need as a society.</p>\n\n<p>\"AI\" (we need to come up with a better name for it)/LLMs are giving us the next path forward. Now, you can simply ask (prompt) an LLM to write some code and it'll do it. It may not be 100% right or exactly how you want it, but that's okay because your job as an engineer is to design, architect, update, and fix it up in the way that you're hoping it'll work.</p>\n\n<p>This is ultimately a great level of innovation because it allows us to move faster. We can use Claude Code, Gemini within Cursor/GitHub Copilot, or any other method of using an LLM to generate us a template of what we want to deploy. We now get to move that part of the acquisition to the \"low-hanging fruit\" category. Think about it; do you really need to write yet another unit test or Terraform resource block? You can, and if you don't know how to do either, you should do it manually to learn. However, if you're an experienced engineer in these areas, you don't have to.</p>\n\n<p>A great example of this is when Windows Sysadmins moved from just a GUI via Server Manager to PowerShell. It got to the point where everyone said, \"ya know, I really don't have to click the \"next\" button again for the millionth time. Let me automate this\".</p>\n\n<h3>\n  \n  \n  Why You Should Trust but Verify\n</h3>\n\n<p>In my consulting practice, I have clients that are making very heavy use in the LLM/AI realm. I also have clients who have made a mandate to not use it. For the clients I'm using AI with, what I can confidently say is it's speeding up certain aspects of the job (i.e, writing a Terraform Resource block), but it creates a lot more work. A great example of this is the hallucinations. I've had LLMs hallucinate so much about bugs, API endpoints that apparently exist but don't, and many other factors. It's to the point where you need to trust but verify. It's great as an assistant, but we're not going to be drinking mojitos, kicking back on the beach, and collecting a paycheck anytime soon.</p>\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  Choosing Your Tool\n</h2>\n\n<p>After you drink the AI Kool-Aid and convince yourself to start using it, you'll need to think about the tool you want to use. There's a very important distinction to the tooling.</p>\n\n<p>You have:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>The LLM you're going to use.</li>\n<li>The interaction point to the LLM.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>As an example, the LLM you may decide to use could be Claude-4-sonnet and the interaction point (tool) you decide to use to interact with Claude-4-sonnet could be GitHub Copilot.</p>\n\n<p>💡</p>\n\n<p>Anthropic released SDKs for Python and TypeScript to interact with Claude Models! <a href=\"https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/sdk#python\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/sdk#python</a></p>\n\n<p>Currently, if you're looking for an IDE experience to interact with an LLM, Cursor and GitHub Copilot appear to be the standards.</p>\n\n<p>If you're looking for a tool to interact with Claude Models via the CLI, there are <a href=\"https://www.anthropic.com/claude-code\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Claude Code</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/block/goose\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Goose</a>, and <a href=\"https://aider.chat/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Aider</a>. What's really great about Goose and Aider is that you can use them to interact with LLMs that aren't just Claude. For example, you can use them to interact with Gemini and GPT.</p>\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  Prompting in Cursor\n</h2>\n\n<p>In the previous section, you learned about some tool choices. In this section, you'll dive into one of many options when it comes to tools and interaction points - Cursor and Claude.</p>\n\n<p>If you'd like to follow along in this blog post from a hands-on perspective, you can download Cursor <a href=\"https://www.cursor.com/downloads\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">here</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The project that you'll build in this blog post is a Terraform Module to create Azure Virtual Machines (VM). If you don't use Azure and you use another cloud, you can still follow 99% of this blog post. Just replace anything that's Azure-related with the cloud you're using.</p>\n\n<p>For example, the prompt below (you'll see in step 3) says to create an Azure VM. If you're on AWS, change that to \"AWS EC2 instance\"</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Open up Cursor after you download it.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>You'll see that it looks VERY similar to VS Code, and that's because it's a fork of VS Code.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2F7g1x84uc2ckr232iv9nl.png\" class=\"article-body-image-wrapper\"><img src=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2F7g1x84uc2ckr232iv9nl.png\" alt=\"Image description\" width=\"800\" height=\"480\"></a></p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>On the right side, you'll see a chat window. This chat window is where you specify if you want to use an Agent to perform some work or the \"ask\" feature for a chatbot/ask a question experience.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>For the purposes of this blog post, you'll use Agent mode and choose Claude-4-sonnet as your LLM.</p>\n\n<p>💡</p>\n\n<p>You may see a different option than I do via the screenshot above (i.e - different Models). The reason why is because I pay the $20.00 per month for Cursor.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>When using LLM/AI tooling, you'll use something called a \"prompt\", which is really just a description of what you want to create. The key with a prompt is to be as specific from an architecture and design perspective as possible. As of right now, the output from an LLM is only as good as the detailed prompt.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Use the following prompt:<br>\n</p>\n\n<div class=\"highlight js-code-highlight\">\n<pre class=\"highlight plaintext\"><code>Within the `terraform-azure` directory, create me a Terraform Module for creating Azure Virtual Machines (VM). This module should be as agnostic as possible, so heavy use on variables and passing in values to said variables at runtime.\n\nThe module should have the ability to create more than one VM at a time.\n\nNo Resource Group, vNet, or subnets need to be created, but variables need to exist so they can be passed in at runtime.\n\nThere should be a variable to pass in the Azure subscription ID at runtime.\n\nThe server Operating System that will be used in Windows Server 2022.\n\nThe default size for the VM should be Standard B2.\n\nA Storage Account called `adtfstate` will be where the Terraform State is stored, so that should be in the backend configuration.\n</code></pre>\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n<li>You'll begin to see AI working. Look at what the output is, don't just accept everything it tells you (actually look at the output and what it's creating), and look through the code to ensure that it's what you're expecting. Remember - trust but verify.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fbjon2tjmr15xcy8balrw.png\" class=\"article-body-image-wrapper\"><img src=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fbjon2tjmr15xcy8balrw.png\" alt=\"Image description\" width=\"746\" height=\"874\"></a></p>\n\n<p>You should have an output similar to the one below.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fggmx6updadixjv5s9zfj.png\" class=\"article-body-image-wrapper\"><img src=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fggmx6updadixjv5s9zfj.png\" alt=\"Image description\" width=\"800\" height=\"359\"></a></p>\n\n<p>You'll have to, of course, go through the code (trust but verify) to ensure that it was everything you were hoping for. For example, I saw a few things that I wanted to change based on the specifics of the environment and some things I didn't like (too many outputs).</p>\n\n<p>That's the goal of using an LLM; to help you generate a template and with that template, you can go in and make it yours. It's just templating at a very fast pace.</p>\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  Getting Programmatic\n</h2>\n\n<p>You may have an IDE that has some LLM capabilities built in, but what about if you want to programmatically interact with an LLM?

You can then use another RPC method (eth_getTransactionReceipt) with this hash to check the transaction outcome.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Implementation Options</strong><br>\nTo send JSON-RPC requests to blockchain networks, you have two main approaches:</p>\n\n<p><strong>1. RPC Providers</strong></p>\n\n<p>RPC providers offer hosted blockchain nodes with exposed RPC endpoints. Popular options include:</p>\n\n<p>Infura<br>\nAlchemy (which I use)<br>\nQuickNode<br>\nEtherscan API<br>\nPolygon, Arbitrum, and other network-specific providers</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Pros</strong>: Convenient, scalable, maintained infrastructure, high uptime <br>\n<strong>Cons</strong>: Requires subscription, rate limits, ongoing costs, less control</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>2. Self-Hosted Nodes</strong></p>\n\n<p>You can run your blockchain node (like Hyperledger Besu for Ethereum) and connect directly to its RPC endpoint.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Pros</strong>: Full control, no rate limits, no ongoing subscription costs <br>\n<strong>Cons</strong>: Requires maintenance, storage, bandwidth, and technical expertise.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>🤯 My Early Struggles</strong></p>\n\n<p>Initially, I was doing it all manually:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Constructing JSON-RPC payloads by hand</li>\n<li>Sending them using requests in Python</li>\n<li>Decoding hexadecimal responses</li>\n<li>Handling edge cases and errors myself</li>\n</ul>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>essentially performing all the stub activities by hand.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Here's what that looked like:<br>\n</p>\n\n<div class=\"highlight js-code-highlight\">\n<pre class=\"highlight plaintext\"><code>\nimport requests\nimport json\n\n# Manual RPC call - the hard way\ndef get_block_number_manual():\n    payload = {\n        \"jsonrpc\": \"2.0\",\n        \"method\": \"eth_blockNumber\",\n        \"params\": [],\n        \"id\": 1\n    }\n\n    response = requests.post(\n        \"https://polygon-amoy.g.alchemy.com/v2/API_KEY\",\n        data=json.dumps(payload),\n        headers={'content-type': 'application/json'}\n    )\n\n    result = response.json()\n    # Convert hex to decimal manually\n    block_number = int(result['result'], 16)\n    return block_number\n\n</code></pre>\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>This approach was error-prone and tedious. Then I discovered the web3.py client library, which transformed my development experience:<br>\n</p>\n\n<div class=\"highlight js-code-highlight\">\n<pre class=\"highlight plaintext\"><code>from web3 import Web3\n\n# Using web3.py - the easy way\nw3 = Web3(Web3.HTTPProvider('https://mainnet.infura.io/v3/YOUR_API_KEY'))\nblock_number = w3.eth.block_number  # That's it!\n</code></pre>\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>The web3.py library acts as the client stub, handling all the complexity: error handling, encoding/decoding, connection management, and more.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Key Takeaways</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Understanding RPC in blockchain development opened up a whole new world for me. The key insights:</li>\n<li>RPC makes remote function calls feel local.</li>\n<li>JSON-RPC is the standard for blockchain communication</li>\n<li>Use established libraries like web3.py instead of manual implementation.</li>\n<li>RPC providers for convenience, self-hosted nodes for control</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The transition from traditional backend development to blockchain becomes much smoother once you grasp these RPC fundamentals.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>For a deeper dive into RPC in distributed systems, check out <a href=\"https://www.chriswirz.com/distributed-systems/02-understanding-rpc-in-distributed-systems\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Understanding RPC in Distributed Systems</a> by Christopher R.
