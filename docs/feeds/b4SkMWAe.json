While the component migration is now done, this leaves some additional\ncomplexity for users and installer projects (for example, kOps or Cluster API) . We will go\nover those additional steps and failure points and make recommendations for cluster owners.\nThis migration was complex and some logic had to be extracted from the core components,\nbuilding four new subsystems.</p><figure><img src=\"https://kubernetes.io/images/docs/components-of-kubernetes.svg\" alt=\"Components of Kubernetes\"></figure><p>One of the most critical functionalities of the cloud controller manager is the node controller,\nwhich is responsible for the initialization of the nodes.</p><p>As you can see in the following diagram, when the  starts, it registers the Node\nobject with the apiserver, Tainting the node so it can be processed first by the\ncloud-controller-manager. The initial Node is missing the cloud-provider specific information,\nlike the Node Addresses and the Labels with the cloud provider specific information like the\nNode, Region and Instance type information.</p><figure><img src=\"https://kubernetes.io/blog/2025/02/14/cloud-controller-manager-chicken-egg-problem/ccm-chicken-egg-problem-sequence-diagram.svg\" alt=\"Chicken and egg problem sequence diagram\"><figcaption><p>Chicken and egg problem sequence diagram</p></figcaption></figure><p>This new initialization process adds some latency to the node readiness. Previously, the kubelet\nwas able to initialize the node at the same time it created the node. Since the logic has moved\nto the cloud-controller-manager, this can cause a <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/running-cloud-controller/#chicken-and-egg\">chicken and egg problem</a>\nduring the cluster bootstrapping for those Kubernetes architectures that do not deploy the\ncontroller manager as the other components of the control plane, commonly as static pods,\nstandalone binaries or daemonsets/deployments with tolerations to the taints and using\n (more on this below)</p><h2>Examples of the dependency problem</h2><p>As noted above, it is possible during bootstrapping for the cloud-controller-manager to be\nunschedulable and as such the cluster will not initialize properly. The following are a few\nconcrete examples of how this problem can be expressed and the root causes for why they might\noccur.</p><p>These examples assume you are running your cloud-controller-manager using a Kubernetes resource\n(e.g. Deployment, DaemonSet, or similar) to control its lifecycle. Because these methods\nrely on Kubernetes to schedule the cloud-controller-manager, care must be taken to ensure it\nwill schedule properly.</p><h3>Example: Cloud controller manager not scheduling due to uninitialized taint</h3><p>As <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/running-cloud-controller/#running-cloud-controller-manager\">noted in the Kubernetes documentation</a>, when the kubelet is started with the command line\nflag <code>--cloud-provider=external</code>, its corresponding  object will have a no schedule taint\nnamed <code>node.cloudprovider.kubernetes.io/uninitialized</code> added. Because the cloud-controller-manager\nis responsible for removing the no schedule taint, this can create a situation where a\ncloud-controller-manager that is being managed by a Kubernetes resource, such as a \nor , may not be able to schedule.</p><p>If the cloud-controller-manager is not able to be scheduled during the initialization of the\ncontrol plane, then the resulting  objects will all have the\n<code>node.cloudprovider.kubernetes.io/uninitialized</code> no schedule taint. It also means that this taint\nwill not be removed as the cloud-controller-manager is responsible for its removal. If the no\nschedule taint is not removed, then critical workloads, such as the container network interface\ncontrollers, will not be able to schedule, and the cluster will be left in an unhealthy state.</p><h3>Example: Cloud controller manager not scheduling due to not-ready taint</h3><p>The next example would be possible in situations where the container network interface (CNI) is\nwaiting for IP address information from the cloud-controller-manager (CCM), and the CCM has not\ntolerated the taint which would be removed by the CNI.</p><blockquote><p>\"The Node controller detects whether a Node is ready by monitoring its health and adds or removes this taint accordingly.\"</p></blockquote><p>One of the conditions that can lead to a Node resource having this taint is when the container\nnetwork has not yet been initialized on that node. As the cloud-controller-manager is responsible\nfor adding the IP addresses to a Node resource, and the IP addresses are needed by the container\nnetwork controllers to properly configure the container network, it is possible in some\ncircumstances for a node to become stuck as not ready and uninitialized permanently.</p><p>This situation occurs for a similar reason as the first example, although in this case, the\n<code>node.kubernetes.io/not-ready</code> taint is used with the no execute effect and thus will cause the\ncloud-controller-manager not to run on the node with the taint. If the cloud-controller-manager is\nnot able to execute, then it will not initialize the node. It will cascade into the container\nnetwork controllers not being able to run properly, and the node will end up carrying both the\n<code>node.cloudprovider.kubernetes.io/uninitialized</code> and <code>node.kubernetes.io/not-ready</code> taints,\nleaving the cluster in an unhealthy state.</p><p>There is no one ‚Äúcorrect way‚Äù to run a cloud-controller-manager. The details will depend on the\nspecific needs of the cluster administrators and users. When planning your clusters and the\nlifecycle of the cloud-controller-managers please consider the following guidance:</p><p>For cloud-controller-managers running in the same cluster, they are managing.</p><ol><li>Use host network mode, rather than the pod network: in most cases, a cloud controller manager\nwill need to communicate with an API service endpoint associated with the infrastructure.\nSetting ‚ÄúhostNetwork‚Äù to true will ensure that the cloud controller is using the host\nnetworking instead of the container network and, as such, will have the same network access as\nthe host operating system. It will also remove the dependency on the networking plugin. This\nwill ensure that the cloud controller has access to the infrastructure endpoint (always check\nyour networking configuration against your infrastructure provider‚Äôs instructions).</li><li>Use a scalable resource type.  and  are useful for controlling the\nlifecycle of a cloud controller. They allow easy access to running multiple copies for redundancy\nas well as using the Kubernetes scheduling to ensure proper placement in the cluster. When using\nthese primitives to control the lifecycle of your cloud controllers and running multiple\nreplicas, you must remember to enable leader election, or else your controllers will collide\nwith each other which could lead to nodes not being initialized in the cluster.</li><li>Target the controller manager containers to the control plane. There might exist other\ncontrollers which need to run outside the control plane (for example, Azure‚Äôs node manager\ncontroller). Still, the controller managers themselves should be deployed to the control plane.\nUse a node selector or affinity stanza to direct the scheduling of cloud controllers to the\ncontrol plane to ensure that they are running in a protected space. Cloud controllers are vital\nto adding and removing nodes to a cluster as they form a link between Kubernetes and the\nphysical infrastructure. Running them on the control plane will help to ensure that they run\nwith a similar priority as other core cluster controllers and that they have some separation\nfrom non-privileged user workloads.<ol><li>It is worth noting that an anti-affinity stanza to prevent cloud controllers from running\non the same host is also very useful to ensure that a single node failure will not degrade\nthe cloud controller performance.</li></ol></li><li>Ensure that the tolerations allow operation. Use tolerations on the manifest for the cloud\ncontroller container to ensure that it will schedule to the correct nodes and that it can run\nin situations where a node is initializing. This means that cloud controllers should tolerate\nthe <code>node.cloudprovider.kubernetes.io/uninitialized</code> taint, and it should also tolerate any\ntaints associated with the control plane (for example, <code>node-role.kubernetes.io/control-plane</code>\nor <code>node-role.kubernetes.io/master</code>). It can also be useful to tolerate the\n<code>node.kubernetes.io/not-ready</code> taint to ensure that the cloud controller can run even when the\nnode is not yet available for health monitoring.</li></ol><p>For cloud-controller-managers that will not be running on the cluster they manage (for example,\nin a hosted control plane on a separate cluster), then the rules are much more constrained by the\ndependencies of the environment of the cluster running the cloud-controller-manager. The advice\nfor running on a self-managed cluster may not be appropriate as the types of conflicts and network\nconstraints will be different. Please consult the architecture and requirements of your topology\nfor these scenarios.</p><p>This is an example of a Kubernetes Deployment highlighting the guidance shown above. It is\nimportant to note that this is for demonstration purposes only, for production uses please\nconsult your cloud provider‚Äôs documentation.</p><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code>apiVersion: apps/v1\nkind: Deployment\nmetadata:\n  labels:\n    app.kubernetes.io/name: cloud-controller-manager\n  name: cloud-controller-manager\n  namespace: kube-system\nspec:\n  replicas: 2\n  selector:\n    matchLabels:\n      app.kubernetes.io/name: cloud-controller-manager\n  strategy:\n    type: Recreate\n  template:\n    metadata:\n      labels:\n        app.kubernetes.io/name: cloud-controller-manager\n      annotations:\n        kubernetes.io/description: Cloud controller manager for my infrastructure\n    spec:\n      containers: # the container details will depend on your specific cloud controller manager\n      - name: cloud-controller-manager\n        command:\n        - /bin/my-infrastructure-cloud-controller-manager\n        - --leader-elect=true\n        - -v=1\n        image: registry/my-infrastructure-cloud-controller-manager@latest\n        resources:\n          requests:\n            cpu: 200m\n            memory: 50Mi\n      hostNetwork: true # these Pods are part of the control plane\n      nodeSelector:\n        node-role.kubernetes.io/control-plane: \"\"\n      affinity:\n        podAntiAffinity:\n          requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:\n          - topologyKey: \"kubernetes.io/hostname\"\n            labelSelector:\n              matchLabels:\n                app.kubernetes.io/name: cloud-controller-manager\n      tolerations:\n      - effect: NoSchedule\n        key: node-role.kubernetes.io/master\n        operator: Exists\n      - effect: NoExecute\n        key: node.kubernetes.io/unreachable\n        operator: Exists\n        tolerationSeconds: 120\n      - effect: NoExecute\n        key: node.kubernetes.io/not-ready\n        operator: Exists\n        tolerationSeconds: 120\n      - effect: NoSchedule\n        key: node.cloudprovider.kubernetes.io/uninitialized\n        operator: Exists\n      - effect: NoSchedule\n        key: node.kubernetes.io/not-ready\n        operator: Exists\n</code></pre><p>When deciding how to deploy your cloud controller manager it is worth noting that\ncluster-proportional, or resource-based, pod autoscaling is not recommended. Running multiple\nreplicas of a cloud controller manager is good practice for ensuring high-availability and\nredundancy, but does not contribute to better performance. In general, only a single instance\nof a cloud controller manager will be reconciling a cluster at any given time.</p>","contentLength":11150,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/kubernetes/comments/1iw6fpj/the_cloud_controller_manager_chicken_and_egg/"},{"title":"Talos on IPv6 only network?","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/kubernetes/comments/1ivumee/talos_on_ipv6_only_network/","date":1740262538,"author":"/u/Moleventions","guid":9371,"unread":true,"content":"<div><p>Does anyone know if you can deploy Talos on an IPv6 only network in AWS?</p></div>   submitted by   <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Moleventions\"> /u/Moleventions </a>","contentLength":107,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Why K8s when there‚Äôs k3s with less resource requirements?","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/kubernetes/comments/1ivu87n/why_k8s_when_theres_k3s_with_less_resource/","date":1740261469,"author":"/u/Crafty0x","guid":9321,"unread":true,"content":"<div><p>I don‚Äôt get why a business will run the more demanding k8s instead of k3s.

If users wanted to clean this data on their own, CDK didn‚Äôt provide a clear way of determining which data is safe to delete. To solve this problem, we are excited to announce the preview launch of <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/v2/guide/ref-cli-cmd-gc.html\">CDK Garbage Collection</a>, a new feature of the CDK that automatically deletes old assets in your bootstrapped Amazon S3 Bucket and Amazon ECR Repository, saving users time and money. This feature is available starting in AWS CDK version 2.165.0.</p><p>We expect CDK Garbage Collection to help AWS CDK customers save on storage costs associated with using the product while not affecting how customers use CDK.</p><p>CDK Garbage Collection is exposed as a CDK CLI command named gc. To use CDK Garbage Collection in its default configuration, run the following command on a terminal in your CDK application.</p><p>The  flag is meant to acknowledge that CDK Garbage Collection is in preview mode. This indicates that the scope and API of the feature might still change, but otherwise the feature is generally production ready and fully supported.</p><p>CDK Garbage Collection works at the environment level, so it will attempt to delete isolated assets in the AWS account / region that you call it in. For the purposes of this walkthrough, you will be re-bootstrapping the environment with a custom qualifier so that you do not delete isolated assets before you are ready.</p><pre><code>cdk bootstrap --qualifier=abcdef --toolkit-stack-name=CDKToolkitDemo</code></pre><p>You now have a new bootstrap template under the name CDKToolkitDemo and bootstrap resources associated with it. Next, set up a CDK application with both Amazon S3 and Amazon ECR assets:</p><pre><code>mkdir garbage-collection-demo &amp;&amp; cd garbage-collection-demo\ncdk init -l typescript app\n</code></pre><p>Your next step is to replace the existing code In <code>lib/garbage-collection-demo-stack.ts</code> with the following CDK Stack:</p><pre><code>import * as path from 'path';\nimport * as cdk from 'aws-cdk-lib';\nimport { Construct } from 'constructs';\nimport * as lambda from 'aws-cdk-lib/aws-lambda';\n\nexport class GarbageCollectionDemoStack extends cdk.Stack {\n  constructor(scope: Construct, id: string, props?: cdk.StackProps) {\n    super(scope, id, props);\n\n    const fn1 = new lambda.Function(this, 'my-function-s3', {\n    code: lambda.Code.fromAsset(path.join(__dirname, '..', 'lambda')),\n    runtime: lambda.Runtime.NODEJS_LATEST,\n    handler: 'index.handler',\n    });\n\n    const fn2 = new lambda.Function(this, 'my-function-ecr', {\n    code: lambda.Code.fromAssetImage(path.join(__dirname, '..', 'docker')),\n    runtime: lambda.Runtime.FROM_IMAGE,\n    handler: lambda.Handler.FROM_IMAGE,\n    });\n  }\n}</code></pre><p>This creates two AWS Lambda functions, one which uses an Amazon S3 asset as its source code and one that uses an Amazon ECR image as its source code. You need to add the assets that are referenced to our CDK application. In  add a simple Lambda function:</p><pre><code>exports.handler = async function(event) {\n  const response = require('./response.json');\n  return response;\n};</code></pre><p>And in  add a simple Docker image:</p><div><pre><code>FROM public.ecr.aws/docker/library/alpine:latest</code></pre><p>Now you can run  and get your initial CDK application set up in your AWS Account.</p><pre><code>cdk deploy \\\n  --toolkit-stack-name=CDKToolkitDemo \\\n  --context='@aws-cdk/core:bootstrapQualifier=abcdef'</code></pre><p>At this point you can check to make sure that assets have been correctly added into the bootstrapped Amazon S3 bucket and Amazon ECR repository:</p><div><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-21521\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/7719a1c782a1ba91c031a682a0a2f8658209adbf/2025/02/21/Screenshot-2024-11-18-at-2.37.59-PM.png\" alt=\"cdk assets inside s3 bucket\" width=\"2608\" height=\"998\"><p>Two objects exist in the bootstrapped Amazon S3 Bucket after the initial AWS CDK Deploy.</p></div><div><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-21522\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/7719a1c782a1ba91c031a682a0a2f8658209adbf/2025/02/21/Screenshot-2024-11-18-at-2.36.32-PM.png\" alt=\"1 Image exists in the bootstrapped Amazon ECR Repository after the initial AWS CDK Deploy.\" width=\"2278\" height=\"580\"><p>One image exists in the bootstrapped Amazon ECR Repository after the initial AWS CDK Deploy.</p></div><p>The output shows that you have the data you expect in both bootstrapped resources.

Add a small change to the Amazon S3 asset that lives in :</p><pre><code>exports.handler = async function(event) {\n  console.log('hello world');\n  const response = require('./response.json');\n  return response;\n};</code></pre><p>And do the same in :</p><div><pre><code>FROM public.ecr.aws/docker/library/alpine:latest\nCMD echo 'Hello World'</code></pre></div><p>You can now run  again, and both assets should be re-uploaded under a new hash.</p><div><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-21523\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/7719a1c782a1ba91c031a682a0a2f8658209adbf/2025/02/21/Screenshot-2024-11-18-at-2.50.16-PM.png\" alt=\"4 Objects exist in the bootstrapped Amazon S3 Bucket after the second AWS CDK Deploy.\" width=\"2256\" height=\"1356\"><p>Four objects exist in the bootstrapped Amazon S3 Bucket after the second AWS CDK Deploy.</p></div><div><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-21524\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/7719a1c782a1ba91c031a682a0a2f8658209adbf/2025/02/21/Screenshot-2024-11-18-at-2.50.52-PM.png\" alt=\"2 Images exist in the bootstrapped Amazon ECR Repository after the second AWS CDK Deploy.\" width=\"2334\" height=\"682\"><p>Two images exist in the bootstrapped Amazon ECR Repository after the second AWS CDK Deploy.</p></div><p>This output confirms that everything is as expected and the new assets have been added in. Because you are using new bootstrapped resources, you can still tell which resources are currently isolated and which are not. Right now, only the zipfile prefixed with 50f409b9 is referenced in AWS CloudFormation, and in Amazon ECR, only the image prefixed  is referenced. That means that every other asset ‚Äî 3 objects in Amazon S3 and 1 object in Amazon ECR ‚Äî are isolated and can be deleted.</p><p>One item to note is the additional files in Amazon S3 that are not your local assets ‚Äî these are AWS CloudFormation templates that are uploaded to Amazon S3 as an intermediary step before being sent to AWS CloudFormation. They are not needed after being copied over and are a perfect candidate for deletion via CDK Garbage Collection.</p><p>Here is where CDK Garbage Collection comes in. With the right parameters, you are able to clean up the isolated objects while not disturbing the assets that are actively in use.</p><div><pre><code>cdk gc \\\n  --unstable=gc \\\n  --bootstrap-stack-name=CDKToolkitDemo \\\n  --rollback-buffer-days=0 \\\n  --created-buffer-days=0</code></pre></div><p>Because you want to delete assets immediately, and not tag them for deletion later, set rollback-buffer-days to 0. You also want to delete assets that were just created, so be sure to set created-buffer-days to 0 as well. The default for created-buffer-days is 1.</p><pre><code> ‚è≥ Garbage Collecting environment aws://912331974472/us-east-1...\nFound 3 objects to delete based off of the following criteria:\n- objects have been isolated for &gt; 0 days\n- objects were created &gt; 0 days ago\n\nDelete this batch (yes/no/delete-all)? </code></pre><p>CDK Garbage Collection found three assets to be deleted from Amazon S3, which is to be expected. It prompts you to verify that you want to delete, which you do, so enter . You will then get this response:</p><div><pre><code>[100.00%] 4 files scanned: 0 assets (0.00 MiB) tagged, 3 assets (0.02 MiB) deleted.</code></pre></div><div><pre><code>Found 1 image to delete based off of the following criteria:\n- images have been isolated for &gt; 0 days\n- images were created &gt; 0 days ago\n\nDelete this batch (yes/no/delete-all)?</code></pre></div><p>Once again, this is to be expected for Amazon ECR, so you enter yes again. You then get the response:</p><div><pre><code>[100.00%] 2 files scanned: 0 assets (0.00 MiB) tagged, 1 assets (3.90 MiB) deleted.</code></pre></div><p>At this point, CDK Garbage Collection is finished.</p><p>CDK Garbage Collection exposes some parameters to help you customize the experience to your specific scenario. These options help you determine how aggressive you want your garbage collection to be.</p><ul><li>rollback-buffer-days: this is the amount of days an asset has to be marked as isolated before it is eligible for deletion.</li><li>created-buffer-days: this is the amount of days an asset must live before it is eligible for deletion.</li></ul><p>Rollback Buffer Days should be considered when you are not using  and instead use a deployment method that operates on templates only, like a pipeline. If your pipeline can rollback without any involvement of the CDK CLI, this parameter will help ensure that assets are not prematurely deleted. When used, instead of deleting unused objects, cdk gc tags them with the current date. Subsequent runs of  will check this tag and delete the asset only after it has been tagged for longer than the specified buffer days.</p><p>Created Buffer Days should be considered if you want to be extra safe about assets that have been recently uploaded. When used,  filters out any assets that have not persisted that number of days. Note that this may not include assets that have been shared across multiple CDK Apps CDK reuses assets that are identical, and its possible that a recent deploy of a CDK App references an asset that was uploaded earlier.</p><p>For example, if you want to ensure that only assets that are over a month old and have been isolated for a week are deleted, you can specify:</p><pre><code>cdk gc --unstable --rollback-buffer-days=7 --created-buffer-days=30.</code></pre><div><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-21525\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/7719a1c782a1ba91c031a682a0a2f8658209adbf/2025/02/21/Screenshot-2025-02-13-at-1.38.54-PM.png\" alt=\"Decision flow diagram of an asset as it gets audited for garbage collection.\" width=\"1794\" height=\"738\"><p>Decision flow diagram of an asset as it gets audited for garbage collection.</p></div><h2>Limitations of CDK Garbage Collection</h2><p>During CDK Garbage Collection, we collect all stack templates to see what assets are in use. If garbage collection runs between the asset upload and stack deployment, there is a chance that it does not pick up the latest stack deployment, but it does pick up the latest asset. In this scenario, CDK Garbage Collection may delete those assets.</p><p>We recommend not deploying stacks while running CDK Garbage Collection. If that is unavoidable, setting  will help as garbage collection will avoid deleting assets that are recently created. Finally, if you do experience a failed deployment, the mitigation is to redeploy, as the asset upload step will be able to re-upload the missing asset. In practice, this race condition is only for a specific edge case and unlikely to happen. However, we are working on a new method of storing CDK Assets to reduce the risk of this race condition. That work is being tracked in this <a href=\"https://github.com/aws/aws-cdk/issues/32799\">issue</a>.</p><p>CDK Garbage Collection helps users manage the lifecycle of unused CDK Assets in their AWS account. As users continue to scale with the CDK, tools like CDK Garbage Collection will play a crucial role in maintaining clean, efficient, and cost-effective cloud environments. We encourage CDK users to explore this feature, provide <a href=\"https://github.com/aws/aws-cdk/issues/new/choose\">feedback</a>, and incorporate it into their workflows to optimize their AWS resource management.</p></div>","contentLength":9848,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Bugs with k8s snap and IPv6 only","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/kubernetes/comments/1iurtp1/bugs_with_k8s_snap_and_ipv6_only/","date":1740147192,"author":"/u/hblok","guid":8633,"unread":true,"content":"<p>I'm setting up an IPv6  cluster, using Ubuntu 24.04 and the k8s and kubelet snaps.

First, all device vendors expose their devices to containers in different ways. Second, device support in container runtimes is fragmented. </p><p dir=\"ltr\">This imposes high costs on both AI chip vendors and the open-source community. Yes, these circumstances clearly illustrate why a standard interface is necessary. </p><p dir=\"ltr\">Now AI chip vendors can support various container runtimes through standardized interfaces by implementing CDI. Docker also supports it as an experimental feature, but it is expected to become a default feature in the near future since containerd now supports it as a default feature. Originally, CDI was part of the DRA. However, it now has a greater influence on the entire container ecosystem.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">In addition to standardized device exposure, CDI delivers several benefits for enterprise deployments using different kinds of AI hardware (such as RNGD):</p><ul><li dir=\"ltr\"><p dir=\"ltr\">Simplified runtime support</p></li><li dir=\"ltr\"><p dir=\"ltr\">Reduced implementation costs</p></li></ul><p dir=\"ltr\">Furiosa has built RNGD to be the best accelerator for real world deployments using large language models, multimodal models and agentic AI systems. To achieve this, we will leverage new Kubernetes functionality like CDI and DRA.  RNGD uses the CDI to define how devices are assigned to containers. </p><p dir=\"ltr\">The CDI specification lays out the format, guidelines, and interfaces needed to properly describe these devices. For example, RNGD‚Äôs vendor-specific interfaces like device nodes and sysfs files can be expressed using the interfaces provided by the CDI. This makes it simpler for container-related systems to understand which system resources need to be present when running workloads on RNGD hardware. </p><p dir=\"ltr\">We‚Äôre currently building a DRA plugin for flexible and efficient resource scheduling. When we release the plugin in 2025, users will be able to request RNGD resources defined through the DRA interface. </p><p dir=\"ltr\">One key benefit of DRA is that it allows users to specify their desired hardware topology. For example, a user might say they need four RNGD devices under a single physical CPU socket, or two RNGD devices under a specific PCIe switch. They can even specify that multiple servers must be located beneath a particular network switch. </p><p>When the scheduler hands off the RNGD scheduling task to the Furiosa DRA plugin, the plugin calculates which server meets the user‚Äôs topology requirements. Among the servers that match these conditions, it then assigns the requested RNGD resources to the user‚Äôs container (reality is binding the user's pod on that server).</p><h2 dir=\"ltr\">Future outlook for Kubernetes and ML workloads</h2><p dir=\"ltr\">The evolution of Kubernetes, driven by advancements like DRA and CDI, is crucial for the future of AI. As the industry moves beyond traditional GPUs and embraces more efficient chip architectures like RNGD, the ability to effectively orchestrate and manage these resources will become even more critical.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">This will accelerate the adoption of specialized hardware, leading to faster, more efficient, and more cost-effective ML inference.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">The ongoing collaboration between the Kubernetes community and AI chip vendors is essential to ensure that Kubernetes continues to meet the evolving needs of the AI landscape. By working together, we can unlock the full potential of AI and drive innovation across industries. We believe that sharing our experience with developing and deploying RNGD will contribute to this important effort. We also hope to foster more open-source contributions that will speed progress toward an open ecosystem that supports a wide range of AI-specific hardware to serve different needs in the industry.</p>","contentLength":3579,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/kubernetes/comments/1itphl0/how_advancements_like_dynamic_resource_allocation/"},{"title":"Dapr.io - enterprise enabler for boosting developer productivity","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoNcJYoJkRY","date":1740001867,"author":"CNCF [Cloud Native Computing Foundation]","guid":6062,"unread":true,"content":"<article>Don't miss out!
