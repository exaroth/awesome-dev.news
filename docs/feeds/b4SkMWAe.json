Engineers must quickly correlate telemetry data across multiple services, review deployment history, and understand complex application dependencies—all while under pressure to restore service. AWS DevOps Agent changes this paradigm by bringing autonomous investigation capabilities to your operations team, reducing mean time to resolution (MTTR) from hours to minutes.</p><p>However, the effectiveness of AWS DevOps Agent depends heavily on how you configure your Agent Spaces which control resource access boundaries. An Agent Space that’s too narrow misses critical context during investigations. One that’s too broad introduces performance overhead and complexity. This post provides best practices for setting up Agent Spaces that balance investigation capability with operational efficiency, drawing from our experience onboarding early customers and using DevOps agent across our own teams.</p><p>By the end of this post, you’ll understand how to structure Agent Spaces for optimal investigation accuracy, determine the right scope of resource access, and use Infrastructure as Code (IaC) to streamline deployment. Let’s start by understanding the foundational concept that makes all of this possible: the Agent Space itself.</p><h2></h2><p>An Agent Space is a logical container that defines what AWS DevOps Agent can access and investigate. Think of it as the agent’s operational boundary—it determines which cloud accounts the agent can query, which third-party integrations are available, and who can interact with investigations.</p><p>Agent Spaces are critical because AWS DevOps Agent needs sufficient context to perform accurate root cause analysis.</p><p>When an incident occurs, the agent:</p><ol><li>Learns your resources and their relationships across accounts</li><li>Correlates telemetry data from logs, metrics, and traces</li><li>Reviews recent changes including deployments and configuration updates</li><li>Generates and tests hypotheses by querying additional data sources</li></ol><div><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-24923\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/7719a1c782a1ba91c031a682a0a2f8658209adbf/2026/01/28/AgentSpaceTopology.png\" alt=\"This view shows the key resources, entities, and relationships DevOps Agent has selected as a foundation for performing it's task efficently.\" width=\"1340\" height=\"1044\"><p>Figure 1: Agent Space Topology</p></div><p>If the Agent Space doesn’t include access to a critical account or integration, the agent might miss the root cause entirely. Conversely, an overly broad Agent Space introduces performance challenges as the agent considers more resource permutations during investigations.</p><p>Understanding these trade-offs between scope and performance is essential. The question becomes: how do you determine the right boundaries for your specific organization and operational model?”</p><h2></h2><p>We recommend thinking about Agent Space boundaries the same way you think about on-call responsibilities: grant access to accounts relevant to the application, but separate production from non-production environments.</p><p>This approach provides several benefits:</p><ul><li>Familiar mental model – Operations teams already understand on-call boundaries</li><li>Appropriate investigation scope – Mirrors how human engineers would investigate incidents</li><li>Two-way door decision – You can expand or narrow Agent Space scope as needs evolve</li><li>Performance balance – Provides sufficient context without overwhelming the agent</li></ul><h3></h3><p>Start by mapping your application architecture to Agent Space boundaries and consider the following questions:</p><ul><li><strong>What defines a logical application?</strong><ul><li>Does your team own multiple independent applications? If so, create separate Agent Spaces.</li><li>Is it a monolith spanning multiple accounts? Then one Agent Space with cross-account access makes sense.</li></ul></li><li><strong>How do you organize on-call rotations?</strong><ul><li>Separate teams for production versus non-production suggests separate Agent Spaces.</li><li>One team handling all environments might work with one Agent Space per application.</li></ul></li><li><strong>What are your investigation patterns?</strong><ul><li>Do production incidents require querying dependent services in other accounts? Include those accounts.</li><li>Are environments completely isolated? Keep Agent Spaces separate.</li></ul></li></ul><p><code>Application: E-commerce Platform</code><code>├── Production environment</code><code>│ ├── Account 111111111111 (Frontend)</code><code>│ ├── Account 222222222222 (API Gateway + Lambda)</code><code>│ └── Account 333333333333 (RDS + DynamoDB)</code><code>│ └── Account 444444444444 (All resources)</code><code>└── Development environment</code><code>└── Account 555555555555 (All resources)</code></p><p><code>Recommended Agent Spaces:</code><code>→ \"EcommerceProd\" (accounts 111111111111, 222222222222, 333333333333)</code><code>→ \"EcommerceNonProd\" (accounts 444444444444, 555555555555)</code></p><div><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-24863\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/7719a1c782a1ba91c031a682a0a2f8658209adbf/2026/01/27/DevOpsAgentOncall-1024x435.png\" alt=\"Create one Agent Space per oncall team.

The Non-Prod Oncall team manages the &quot;EcommerceNonProd&quot; Agent Space covering development and staging accounts. This 1:1 mapping provides operations teams with a familiar mental model where Agent Space boundaries match their existing oncall responsibilities.\" width=\"1024\" height=\"435\"><p>Figure 2: Agent Space boundaries mirror on-call team responsibilities</p></div><h3></h3><p>Beyond the basic single-application pattern, organizations encounter more complex scenarios that require careful consideration. Here are critical patterns to address that we’ve seen customers successfully adopt:</p><p><strong>Pattern 1: Investigations Spanning Multiple Teams. </strong>Large organizations with multiple teams (example: 3 teams managing 100+ production accounts) encounter situations where an issue originates in Team A’s infrastructure but the root cause lies in Team B’s services. The question becomes: how do you enable collaboration across Agent Spaces?</p><p> Create application-specific Agent Spaces that include read-only access to shared resource accounts e.g. dependencies. Establish clear on-call escalation procedures and add them as <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/devopsagent/latest/userguide/about-aws-devops-agent-devops-agent-runbooks.html\">runbooks</a> when investigations identify cross-team root causes for efficient communication (e.g. via chat in <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/devopsagent/latest/userguide/configuring-capabilities-for-aws-devops-agent-connecting-to-ticketing-and-chat-connecting-slack.html\">Slack</a>). Configure the shared service team’s resources with tags identifying which applications use them (example: <code>app-id: ecommerce-frontend</code>). Following a consistent tagging strategy provides investigation context for shared resources while maintaining clear resource ownership.</p><p><strong>Pattern 2: Shared Services and Network Operations Center (NOC) Teams. </strong>Some organizations have centralized teams that provide and support shared infrastructure services (databases, networking, monitoring, security) used by multiple applications across the organization. These NOC or central operations teams need visibility into their services without requiring access to every application’s Agent Space.</p><p> Create a dedicated Agent Space for the shared service team and configure an Agent Space scoped to the shared service team’s infrastructure and operational responsibilities:</p><ul><li>Include AWS accounts containing shared databases, network infrastructure, centralized logging, and monitoring systems</li><li>Add relevant CloudFormation stacks for shared platform services</li><li>Configure IAM roles that provide read-only access to the specific resources the team supports</li><li>Include runbooks and operational procedures specific to the shared services</li></ul><p>This follows the same principle as application-specific Agent Spaces: one Agent Space per on-call team, even when that Agent Space’s scope spans multiple applications. While shared services teams manage specific infrastructure domains, SRE teams often face an even larger challenge: operational responsibility for hundreds or thousands of applications at enterprise scale.</p><p><strong>Pattern 3: Central Operations Teams Managing Many Applications. </strong>Central operations teams responsible for operational tooling across hundreds or thousands of applications can efficiently manage Agent Spaces at scale using Infrastructure as Code.</p><p>Use the AWS <a href=\"https://github.com/aws-samples/sample-aws-devops-agent-cdk\">CDK</a> or <a href=\"https://github.com/aws-samples/sample-aws-devops-agent-terraform\">Terraform</a> samples available as starting points. These samples enable teams to:</p><ul><li>Define a standardized Agent Space template with your organization’s required IAM roles, integrations, resource boundaries and governance tags</li><li>Deploy Agent Spaces programmatically as part of application onboarding workflows</li><li>Enforce compliance through AWS Config rules or service control policies</li><li>Track all Agent Spaces through consolidated billing and tagging (application-id, team, cost-center, environment)</li></ul><p>Central operations teams manage the templates and governance policies, while application teams operate within those guardrails. This approach scales to thousands of applications with consistent configuration and automated deployment.

When new applications are registered, a CI/CD pipeline automatically deploys an Agent Space for that application team. This distributed pattern (one Agent Space per app team) scales to many applications without manual intervention, while maintaining investigation accuracy by avoiding a centralized &quot;monitoring account&quot; that would bias toward its primary application.\" width=\"547\" height=\"708\"><p>Figure 3: Enterprise scale pattern using Infrastructure as Code</p></div><p>Now that you understand how to design Agent Space boundaries aligned with your team structure and scale requirements, let’s walk through the practical implementation steps to bring these architectural patterns to life.</p><h2></h2><p>This section walks you through the practical steps of creating your first Agent Space—from verifying prerequisites and configuring IAM roles across accounts to integrating observability tools, setting up access controls, and testing your configuration to ensure investigations have the context they need.</p><h3></h3><p>Before setting up your first Agent Space, ensure you have:</p><ul><li> – At least one AWS account where your application resources run</li><li> – Sufficient access to create IAM roles and policies across accounts. AWS DevOps Agent requires two distinct sets of IAM permissions: \n  <ul><li><strong>Agent Space role permissions</strong> – The IAM role that AWS DevOps Agent assumes to query your AWS resources, access CloudWatch Logs, and discover topology. This role requires the  managed policy plus additional permissions for AWS Support and expanded capabilities. See the <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/devopsagent/latest/userguide/getting-started-with-aws-devops-agent-cli-onboarding-guide.html\">CLI onboarding guide</a> for the complete role configuration.</li><li><strong>Operator app role permissions</strong> – The IAM role that controls what human operators can do in the AWS DevOps Agent web application, such as starting investigations, viewing results, and creating AWS Support cases. This role is separate from the agent’s investigation permissions.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Service Control Policies (SCPs)</strong> – Verify that your organization’s SCPs allow AWS DevOps Agent API actions. Common issue: Teams complete Agent Space setup but investigations fail because SCPs block  actions or  actions. Review your AWS Organization’s SCPs and add exceptions for DevOps Agent if needed. Note that DevOps Agent and Amazon Bedrock inference are not impacted by policies that restrict customer content to specific AWS regions—Bedrock may use US regions other than US East (N. Virginia) for stateless inference.</li><li> – At minimum, Amazon CloudWatch (automatically available via IAM roles) and Amazon CloudTrail. For comprehensive investigations, integrate Application Performance Monitoring tools like Datadog, Dynatrace, New Relic, Grafana, or Splunk. See <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/devopsagent/latest/userguide/configuring-capabilities-for-aws-devops-agent-connecting-telemetry-sources-index.html\">Connecting telemetry sources</a> for supported integrations.</li><li><strong>Understanding third-party integration configuration</strong> – Some third-party tools require a two-step configuration process: \n  <ul><li><strong>Account-level registration</strong> – Tools that use OAuth (like GitHub, Dynatrace) must first be registered at the AWS account level through the DevOps Agent console. This establishes OAuth credentials that are shared across all Agent Spaces in your account.</li><li><strong>Agent Space-level association</strong> – After registration, each Agent Space individually specifies which resources from that tool to use. For example, after registering GitHub once, Agent Space “EcommerceProd” can associate only production repositories while Agent Space “EcommerceNonProd” associates development repositories.Other tools like Datadog, New Relic, and Splunk can be directly associated with an Agent Space using API keys or tokens without separate account-level registration. CloudWatch requires no additional configuration beyond IAM roles.</li></ul></li><li> – GitHub or GitLab repository access for code context and deployment correlation (optional but highly recommended)</li><li> – AWS CDK (TypeScript/Python), Terraform, AWS CLI, or AWS Management Console for Agent Space deployment</li></ul><p>With prerequisites verified, you’re ready to create your Agent Space and establish the IAM trust relationships that enable investigations.</p><h3></h3><p>AWS DevOps Agent requires IAM roles in each AWS account within the Agent Space boundary. The agent assumes these roles to query CloudWatch Logs, describe resources, and build application topology.</p><p>The AWS DevOps Agent is designed to retrieve operational data from multiple AWS Regions across all AWS accounts that you grant access to within the configured Agent Space, enabling comprehensive visibility into distributed infrastructure and applications regardless of their geographic deployment, while supporting multiple accounts through a configuration process that involves creating IAM roles with appropriate trust policies and permissions in secondary accounts</p><p>Navigate to the <a href=\"https://console.aws.amazon.com/devops-agent/\">AWS DevOps Agent console</a> and choose Create Agent Space and follow the guided setup to create IAM roles in each target account.</p><div><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-24878\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/7719a1c782a1ba91c031a682a0a2f8658209adbf/2026/01/27/DevOpsAgentSpaceSetup-1024x587.png\" alt=\"The Create an Agent Space setup wizard in the AWS Management Console showing Agent Space Details.\" width=\"1024\" height=\"587\"><p>Figure 4: Creating an Agent Space in the Console</p></div><p>The setup wizard helps in configuring cross-account trust relationships.</p><div><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-24881\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/7719a1c782a1ba91c031a682a0a2f8658209adbf/2026/01/27/DevOpsAgent-MultiAccount-1024x701.png\" alt=\"Shows the Agent Space Management Console and in particular the capability to configure your Agent Space to access multiple accounts.\" width=\"1024\" height=\"701\"><p>Figure 5: Multiple account configuration for your Agent Space</p></div><p>We provide sample <a href=\"https://github.com/aws-samples/sample-aws-devops-agent-cdk\">CDK</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/aws-samples/sample-aws-devops-agent-terraform\">Terraform</a> templates that automate Agent Space creation and IAM role deployment across multiple accounts.</p><p><strong>AWS CDK example (TypeScript):</strong></p><pre><code>//If you have many accounts, use a loop:\n\nconst accounts = [\n  { id: '111111111111', name: 'Prod', role: prodRole, stage: 'prod' },\n  { id: '222222222222', name: 'Dev', role: devRole, stage: 'dev' },\n  { id: '333333333333', name: 'Test', role: testRole, stage: 'test' },\n];\n\naccounts.forEach(account =&gt; {\n  const association = new devopsagent.CfnAssociation(this, `${account.name}Association`, {\n    agentSpaceId: agentSpace.ref,\n    serviceId: 'aws',\n    configuration: {\n      aws: {\n        assumableRoleArn: account.role.roleArn,\n        accountId: account.id,\n        accountType: 'monitor'\n      }\n    }\n  });\n\n  association.addDependency(agentSpace);\n  cdk.Tags.of(association).add('stage', account.stage);\n});</code></pre><p>For detailed instructions on setting up IAM roles and permissions across accounts, see the <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/devopsagent/latest/userguide/getting-started-with-aws-devops-agent-cli-onboarding-guide.html\">CLI Onboarding Guide</a>.</p><p>Once your Agent Space exists and has access to AWS accounts, the next critical step is connecting the observability and development tools that provide investigation context beyond AWS native services.</p><h3></h3><p>AWS DevOps Agent investigates incidents by correlating data from multiple sources. The more context available, the more accurate the root cause analysis.</p><p>Recommended integrations by priority:</p><ol><li> – Provides logs, metrics, and traces from AWS services. The agent queries CloudWatch Logs Insights automatically during investigations. No additional configuration is needed if IAM roles are properly configured.</li><li><strong>Application Performance Monitoring tools</strong> – Datadog, Dynatrace, New Relic, and Splunk provide distributed tracing, custom metrics, and application-level context. Configure via Agent Space integrations in the AWS Console.</li><li> – GitHub or GitLab integration enables the agent to review recent deployments and code changes. Requires OAuth or personal access token.</li><li> – GitHub Actions or GitLab workflows help the agent correlate incidents with deployment timing. Configured alongside code repository integration.</li><li> – Slack and ServiceNow integration enables DevOps Agent to post real-time investigation updates to team channels and automatically update incident tickets with findings, root cause analysis, and recommended mitigation steps throughout the investigation lifecycle.</li></ol><p>Beyond built-in integrations, AWS DevOps Agent supports webhook triggered investigations and custom MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers so you can bring-your-own observability tools.</p><p><strong>Webhook configuration for investigation triggers</strong>Webhooks allow external systems (Grafana, Prometheus, PagerDuty, custom monitoring tools) to automatically trigger DevOps Agent investigations when incidents occur. Each Agent Space receives a unique webhook URL that accepts JSON payloads describing the incident.</p><ul><li> Webhooks use HMAC signatures for security. Store the webhook secret in AWS Secrets Manager and rotate it according to your security policies.</li><li> Ensure your monitoring tool sends incident context including timestamps, affected resources, and symptom descriptions. Richer context enables more accurate investigations.</li></ul><p><strong>Bring-your-own MCP servers</strong>If you use observability tools beyond the built-in integrations (Grafana, Prometheus, custom telemetry systems), you can connect them via MCP servers. MCP servers expose your tool’s data through a standardized protocol that DevOps Agent queries during investigations.</p><ul><li><strong>Publicly accessible HTTPS endpoint</strong>: MCP servers must be reachable from the public internet. VPC-hosted servers are not currently supported.</li><li>: For security, only expose MCP tools that perform read operations. Write operations introduce prompt injection risks.</li><li>: Register MCP servers at the account level, then selectively enable specific tools per Agent Space. Don’t grant access to all tools—choose only those relevant to investigations.</li></ul><ul><li><strong>Authentication misconfiguration</strong>: MCP servers support OAuth 2.0 or API key authentication. Verify your OAuth client credentials are correct and that token exchange URLs are accessible from AWS infrastructure.</li><li>: MCP tool names have a maximum length of 64 characters. Longer names will fail registration.</li><li>: Use the full HTTPS URL including path. Example: <code>https://mcp.example.com/v1/mcp</code> not just .</li></ul><p><strong></strong>After configuring webhooks or MCP servers, trigger a test investigation to verify connectivity:</p><ul><li>For webhooks: Send a test payload from your monitoring tool and verify the investigation starts in the DevOps Agent web app</li><li>For MCP servers: Start an investigation manually and check the agent journal to confirm it successfully called your MCP tools</li><li>Review any errors in AWS CloudTrail logs which capture all DevOps Agent API calls including integration attempts</li></ul><p>With your data sources connected, you now need to ensure the right people have appropriate access to investigations while maintaining security boundaries.</p><h3></h3><p>Agent Spaces support fine-grained access controls to ensure only authorized team members can interact with investigations.</p><p><strong>Access control considerations:</strong></p><ul><li>Who should view investigations? Typically on-call engineers, SREs, and DevOps engineers. Consider including security teams for security-related incidents.</li><li>Who should create AWS Support cases? Typically on-call leads and senior engineers. Restrict this permission to prevent excessive case creation.</li><li>Who should modify Agent Space configuration? Typically central operations or infrastructure teams. Separate this from day-to-day investigation access.</li></ul><p><strong>IAM-based access control:</strong></p><p>AWS DevOps Agent uses IAM policies to control access to Agent Spaces. Attach policies to IAM users, groups, or roles:</p><pre><code>{\n  \"Version\": \"2012-10-17\",\n  \"Statement\": [\n    {\n      \"Effect\": \"Allow\",\n      \"Action\": [\n        \"devopsagent:GetAgentSpace\",\n        \"devopsagent:StartInvestigation\",\n        \"devopsagent:GetInvestigation\",\n        \"devopsagent:ListInvestigations\"\n      ],\n      \"Resource\": \"arn:aws:devopsagent:us-east-1:123456789012:agentspace/EcommerceProd\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n</code></pre><p>AWS DevOps Agent operates within your AWS environment with privileged access to operational data across multiple accounts. While general security foundations apply, Agent Space configuration introduces specific considerations. For comprehensive security guidance, see the <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/devopsagent/latest/userguide/aws-devops-agent-security.html\">AWS DevOps Agent Security</a> documentation.</p><p>Access controls are in place—now it’s time to validate that your Agent Space configuration provides the investigation coverage you need.</p><p>Agent Space configuration is a two-way door decision. Start with a focused scope and expand based on investigation results.</p><p><strong>Testing your Agent Space:&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Trigger a test investigation using the AWS DevOps Agent web app.</p><ul><li>Start an investigation and provide symptoms such as “High latency on /api/checkout endpoint”.</li><li>Observe which resources the agent queries.</li><li>Review investigation completeness. Did the agent identify the root cause?</li><li>Were any accounts or services missing from the investigation?</li><li>Did the agent have sufficient telemetry data?</li></ul><p>Adjust Agent Space boundaries based on results.</p><ul><li>Add accounts if investigations lack context.</li><li>Add integrations if telemetry gaps exist.</li><li>Narrow scope if performance degrades.</li></ul><p>AWS DevOps Agent transforms incident response from a manual, time-consuming process into an autonomous, data-driven investigation. However, the agent’s effectiveness depends on proper Agent Space configuration. By following the on-call based approach—granting access to accounts relevant to your application while separating production from non-production environments—you provide sufficient context for accurate root cause analysis without introducing unnecessary complexity.</p><ul><li>Think on-call boundaries – Agent Space scope should mirror how your team investigates incidents</li><li>Use Infrastructure as Code – CDK and Terraform templates ensure consistent, repeatable deployments</li><li>Integrate observability tools – More data sources equals more accurate investigations</li><li>Iterate based on results – Expand or narrow Agent Space scope as investigation patterns emerge</li></ul><p>We’re committed to making AWS DevOps Agent easier to adopt and more accurate in solving customer problems.

This poses an issue for us— trying to run or even grant permissions to the reusable workflow’s script will give us errors that the script doesn’t&nbsp;exist.</p><p>This may seem obvious because there is no scripts/changelog-quality-check.py path in ttn-frontend or ttn-backend, but it surprised me at first. I had assumed that the reusable workflow could access a script in its own repository with no problem — you might think that since it’s running, it would implicitly switch to the context of its own repo. As I found out, that’s not the case. Our caller workflow fired off first, so we’re running things from the context of its repository. Because of that, we have to checkout the ttn-workflows repo so we can access the&nbsp;script.</p><h4>How to Checkout Another Repository in a&nbsp;Workflow</h4><p>So  do we access this script? We checkout the reusable workflow’s repository, then point to it. It’s easier than you think — if you’ve used Github Actions at all, you’re familiar with the practically ubiquitous action <a href=\"https://github.com/actions/checkout\">actions/checkout</a>.</p><p>It’s commonly the first thing you see in several workflows. In this scenario we use it twice: first in the caller repo, and now again in the reusable workflow, this time with arguments!</p><p>Take a look at the changelog-quality-checks.yml gist&nbsp;below:</p><p>The “<em>Checkout ttn-workflows repo (if non-manually triggered)</em>” step assesses if we’re running the workflow manually (if we were, the checkout would be skipped since we’d already be in the context of the ttn-workflows repo). Since the workflow was triggered via workflow_call, the step will use actions/checkout in conjunction with the following arguments:</p><ul><li>repository: The specific repository to checkout. (: In the actions/checkout used in the caller workflow, we don’t need to specify this because the default activity checks out the caller workflow’s repository. Since we need to check out ttn-workflows, we specify it&nbsp;here.)</li><li>path: The directory in the runner to put the repository contents (: this is relative to GITHUB_WORKSPACE. It should be present at top-level. In this example we checkout the ttn-workflows repository into the ttn-workflows-repo directory).</li><li>token: The token that has the relevant permissions (specifically, the repo permission) necessary to checkout the reusable workflow’s repository. (: This is a generated token — we can’t use the pre-established GITHUB_TOKEN in the caller repo and pass it to the reusable workflow because <a href=\"https://docs.github.com/en/actions/concepts/security/github_token#about-the-github_token\">GITHUB_TOKEN’s permissions are scoped to a single repository</a>.)</li></ul><h3>Accessing the Contents of a Checked Out&nbsp;Repo</h3><p>After we’ve checked out the ttn-workflows repository into the ttn-workflows-repo path, we can then call the changelog-quality-check.py script simply by referencing its path like&nbsp;so:</p><p>The logic above also accounts changelog-quality-checks.yml being triggered manually or not. It isn’t in our case, so we set the REPO_PATH environmental variable to “ttn-workflows-repo”, the value of path used in the previous step. In other words, the full path used in the lower two steps would be ttn-workflows-repo/scripts/changelog-quality-check.py.</p><p>Based upon the results of the script, the changelog-quality-checks.yml workflow returns a status (not pictured) that can then be leveraged by the caller workflow, such as in a <a href=\"https://medium.com/devops-dev/building-and-testing-a-custom-status-check-with-a-github-actions-workflow-a-guide-9f3626682587\">branch protection rule</a>. Standard post-checkout activity occurs, and that’s it. Not bad at&nbsp;all!</p><p>Testing to see if the caller-reusable workflow relationship works as expected is very easy. All we need to do is create a release branch, make a commit on it, and then open a pull request to&nbsp;main.</p><p>The synchronize trigger is key here — I can just make another commit while the pull request is open and run a different test case. For example, let’s say in ttn-frontend I have a release/v1.2 branch, and my first commit is creating a CHANGELOG file named CHANGELOG-frontend-v1.2.txt (the happy path scenario). I open the pull request which will be the very first time the caller workflow is triggered.</p><p>I then go and look at the results. Things look great, but I still want to test scenarios like a bad CHANGELOG name. To do that, I can just rename my CHANGELOG file incorrectly in a new commit, and then push it. The pull request more or less detects that change (this is the synchronize activity). That triggers the caller workflow again; I can rinse and repeat from&nbsp;there.</p><p>As an aside, in previously displayed code snippets there is logic that allows one to test this reusable workflow via manually triggering it in its own repository in addition to calling it from a caller workflow. Basically, the reusable workflow assesses what repository called it and/or if it was manually executed. The evaluation of that determines whether the workflow will execute certain steps. It’s handy to have it set up like this in case you want to specifically test something related to the reusable workflow/script versus the caller-reusable workflow relationship, or if you want to iterate further on the reusable workflow.</p><p>This article has shown how to call upon a reusable workflow in a different repository and explained the how and why of checking out that workflow’s repository to execute desired behavior. Using the methodology explained here, you can see why it’s important to properly contain reusable workflows and their associated items (like scripts) in their own repository. Perhaps more importantly, you have been shown  to link it all together.</p><p>Are you as sick as I am of the word ‘reusable’ after getting to this point? Once you get over that malaise, try setting up something similar for yourself!

Whether you prefer writing templates directly in JSON or YAML, or using programming languages like Python, Java, and TypeScript with the <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/cdk/\">AWS Cloud Development Kit (CDK)</a>, CloudFormation and CDK provide the flexibility you need. For organizations adopting <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/organizing-your-aws-environment/organizing-your-aws-environment.html\">multi-account strategies</a>, CloudFormation <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/what-is-cfnstacksets.html\">StackSets</a> offers a powerful capability to deploy resources across multiple regions and accounts in parallel.</p><p>In 2025, we delivered a comprehensive set of major enhancements focused on three core areas: reducing dev-test cycle through early validation, improving deployment safety with improved configuration drift management, and integrating IaC context to AI-powered development tools.</p><p>These launches address common pain points in infrastructure development workflows, from catching deployment errors before resource provisioning to managing configuration drift systematically. The features span the entire development lifecycle, from template authoring in your IDE to multi-account deployments at scale.</p><p>This blog provides an overview of the key capabilities we launched in 2025 and how they improve your infrastructure development workflow.</p><h2>Early Validation &amp; Enhanced Troubleshooting: Pre-Deployment Error Detection</h2><p>CloudFormation now validates your templates during <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/using-cfn-updating-stacks-changesets.html\">change set</a> (preview of infrastructure changes before deployment) creation, catching common deployment errors before resource provisioning begins. The validation checks for invalid property syntax, resource name conflicts with existing resources in your account, and S3 bucket emptiness constraints on delete operations.</p><p><strong>Figure 1: Pre-deployment validations view</strong></p><p>When validation fails, the change set status shows ‘FAILED’ with detailed information about each issue, including the property path where problems occur. This early feedback helps you fix issues faster rather than waiting for deployment failures.</p><h2>Improved Deployment troubleshooting</h2><p>For runtime errors that occur during deployment, every stack operation now receives a unique operation ID. You can filter stack events by operation ID to quickly identify root causes, reducing troubleshooting time from minutes to seconds. The new <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/cloudformation/describe-events.html\">describe-events</a> API provides grouped access to events. You can query events for a specific operation, filter to FAILED status events, and extract the root cause without parsing through the entire stack event history.</p><h2>CloudFormation IDE Experience: Language Server Protocol Integration</h2><p>We launched the <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2025/11/aws-cloudformation-intelligent-authoring-ides/\">AWS CloudFormation Language Server</a>, bringing end-to-end infrastructure development directly into your IDE. Available through the AWS Toolkit for Visual Studio Code, Kiro, and other compatible IDEs, this capability transforms how you author CloudFormation templates.</p><p><strong>Figure 1: Initializing a CloudFormation project with environment configuration</strong></p><p>The Language Server provides context-aware auto-completion that understands CloudFormation semantics. When you define resources, it suggests only required properties automatically, while optional properties appear on hover. Built-in validation catches issues before deployment integrating early validation capabilities, flagging invalid resource properties, missing IAM permissions, and security policy violations using CloudFormation Guard.</p><p><strong>Figure 2: Hover information displaying optional properties and their documentation</strong></p><p>The drift-aware deployment view highlights differences between your template and deployed infrastructure, helping you spot configuration changes made outside CloudFormation. The Language Server also provides semantic navigation features, go-to-definition for logical IDs, find-all-references for resource dependencies, and hover documentation that pulls from the CloudFormation resource specification. These features work across intrinsic functions like !Ref, !GetAtt, and !Sub, understanding the CloudFormation template structure. By integrating validation and real-time feedback directly into your authoring experience, the Language Server keeps you in flow state, reducing context switching between your IDE, AWS Console, and documentation.</p><p><strong>Figure 3: Type-aware completions for intrinsic functions like !GetAtt &amp; !Ref</strong></p><h3><strong>Stack Refactoring: Adapt your infrastructure to your organization evolution</strong></h3><p>Stack Refactoring enables you to reorganize your CloudFormation and CDK infrastructure without disrupting deployed resources. You can move resources between stacks, rename logical IDs, and decompose monolithic stacks into focused components while maintaining resource stability and operational state.</p><p>Whether you’re modernizing legacy stacks, aligning infrastructure with evolving architectural patterns, or improving long-term maintainability, Stack Refactoring adapts your CloudFormation and CDK organization to changing requirements. The console and CDK experience, launched this year, extends the earlier CLI capability, making refactoring accessible through your preferred interface.</p><p>Configuration drift occurs when infrastructure managed by CloudFormation is modified through the AWS Console, SDK, or CLI. Drift-aware change sets address this challenge by providing a three-way comparison between your new template, last-deployed template, and actual infrastructure state.</p><p><strong>Figure 4: Examine the drift-aware change set to see the dangerous memory reduction that would occur</strong></p><p>This capability helps you prevent unexpected overwrites of drift. If your change set preview shows unintended changes, you can update your template values and recreate the change set before deployment. During execution, CloudFormation matches resource properties with template values and recreates resources deleted outside of CloudFormation.</p><p>Drift-aware change sets enable you to systematically revert drift and keep infrastructure in sync with templates, strengthening reproducibility for testing and disaster recovery while maintaining your security posture.</p><h2>CloudFormation Hooks: Control Catalog with Hooks</h2><p>AWS CloudFormation Hooks now supports managed proactive controls, enabling customers to validate resource configurations against AWS best practices without writing custom Hooks logic. Customers can select controls from the AWS Control Tower Controls Catalog and apply them during CloudFormation operations. When using CloudFormation, customers can configure these controls to run in warn mode, allowing teams to test controls without blocking deployments and giving them the flexibility to evaluate control behavior before enforcing policies in production. This significantly reduces setup time, eliminates manual errors, and ensures comprehensive governance coverage across your infrastructure.</p><p>AWS also introduced a new Hooks Invocation Summary page in the CloudFormation console. This centralized view provides a complete historical record of Hooks activity, showing which controls were invoked, their execution details, and outcomes such as pass, warn, or fail. This simplifies compliance reporting issues faster.</p><p>With this launch, customers can now leverage AWS-managed controls as part of their provisioning workflows, eliminating the overhead of writing and maintaining custom logic. These controls are curated by AWS and aligned with industry best practices, helping teams enforce consistent policies across all environments. The new summary page delivers essential visibility into Hook invocation history, enabling faster issue resolution and streamlined compliance reporting.</p><h2>StackSets Deployment Ordering</h2><p>CloudFormation StackSets now supports deployment ordering for auto-deployment mode, enabling you to define the sequence in which stack instances automatically deploy across accounts and regions. This capability coordinates complex multi-stack deployments where foundational infrastructure must be provisioned before dependent application components.</p><p>When creating or updating a StackSet, you can specify up to 10 dependencies per stack instance using the DependsOn parameter in the AutoDeployment configuration. StackSets automatically orchestrates deployments based on your defined relationships. For example, you can ensure networking and security stack instances complete deployment before application stack instances begin, preventing deployment failures due to missing dependencies.</p><p>StackSets includes built-in cycle detection to prevent circular dependencies and provides error messages to help resolve configuration issues. This feature is available at no additional cost in all AWS Regions where CloudFormation StackSets is available.</p><p>We introduced the <a href=\"https://awslabs.github.io/mcp/servers/aws-iac-mcp-server\">AWS Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) MCP Server</a>, bridging AI assistants with your AWS infrastructure development workflow. Built on the Model Context Protocol (MCP), this server enables AI assistants like <a href=\"https://kiro.dev/cli/\">Kiro CLI </a>to help you search CloudFormation and CDK documentation, validate templates, troubleshoot deployments, and follow best practices, all while maintaining the security of local execution.</p><p><strong>Figure 1: Kiro-CLI with AWS IaC MCP server</strong></p><p>The IaC MCP Server provides nine specialized tools organized into two categories. Remote documentation search tools connect to AWS knowledge bases to retrieve up-to-date information about CloudFormation resources, CDK APIs, and implementation guidance. Local validation and troubleshooting tools run entirely on your machine, performing syntax validation with cfn-lint, security checks with CloudFormation Guard, and deployment failure analysis with integrated CloudTrail events.</p><p><strong>Figure 4: Validate my CloudFormation template with AWS IaC MCP Server</strong></p><ol><li><strong>Intelligent Documentation Assistant</strong></li></ol><p>Instead of manually searching through documentation, ask your AI assistant natural language questions:</p><p>“How do I create an S3 bucket with encryption enabled in CDK?”</p><p>The server searches CDK best practice and samples, returning relevant code examples and explanations.</p><p><strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;2. Proactive Template Validation</strong></p><p>Before deploying infrastructure changes:</p><p>User: “Validate my CloudFormation template and check for security issues”</p><p>AI Agent: [Uses validate_cloudformation_template and check_cloudformation_template_compliance]</p><p>“Found 2 issues: Missing encryption on EBS volumes,</p><p>and S3 bucket lacks public access block configuration”</p><p><strong> &nbsp;3. Rapid Deployment Troubleshooting</strong></p><p>When a stack deployment fails:</p><p>User: “My stack ‘stack_03’ in us-east-1 failed to deploy. What happened?”</p><p>AI Agent: [Uses troubleshoot_stack_deployment with CloudTrail integration]</p><p>“The deployment failed due to insufficient IAM permissions.</p><p>CloudTrail shows AccessDenied for ec2:CreateVpc.</p><p>You need to add VPC permissions to your deployment role.”</p><p><strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;4. Learning and Exploration</strong></p><p>New to AWS CDK? The server helps you discover constructs and patterns:</p><p>User: “Show me how to build a serverless API”</p><p>AI Agent: [Searches CDK constructs and samples]</p><p>“Here are three approaches using API Gateway + Lambda…”</p><p>Here are some resources to help you get started learning and using CloudFormation to manage your cloud infrastructure:</p><p>As we begin 2026, our focus remains on making infrastructure deployment faster, safer, and more manageable. The launches in 2025 reflect our commitment to solving real customer challenges and improving the CloudFormation developer experience. From intelligent IDE integrations to AI-powered assistance, these capabilities help you build infrastructure with greater confidence and efficiency.</p><p>We encourage you to try these features and share your feedback.

href=\"https://cluster-api.sigs.k8s.io/\">Cluster API</a> brings declarative management to Kubernetes cluster lifecycle, allowing users and platform teams to define the desired state of clusters and rely on controllers to continuously reconcile toward it.</p><p>Similar to how you can use StatefulSets or Deployments in Kubernetes to manage a group of Pods, in Cluster API you can use KubeadmControlPlane to manage a set of control plane Machines, or you can use MachineDeployments to manage a group of worker Nodes.</p><p>The <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/cluster-api/releases/tag/v1.12.0\">Cluster API v1.12.0</a> release expands what is possible in Cluster API, reducing friction in common lifecycle operations by introducing in-place updates and chained upgrades.</p><h2>Emphasis on simplicity and usability</h2><p>With v1.12.0, the Cluster API project demonstrates once again that this community is capable of delivering a great amount of innovation, while at the same time minimizing impact for Cluster API users.</p><p>What does this mean in practice?</p><p>Users simply have to change the <a href=\"https://cluster-api.sigs.k8s.io/user/concepts#cluster\">Cluster</a> or the <a href=\"https://cluster-api.sigs.k8s.io/user/concepts#machine\">Machine</a> spec (just as with previous Cluster API releases), and Cluster API will automatically trigger in-place updates or chained upgrades when possible and advisable.</p><p>Like Kubernetes does for Pods in Deployments, when the <a href=\"https://cluster-api.sigs.k8s.io/user/concepts#machine\">Machine</a> spec changes also Cluster API performs rollouts by creating a new Machine and deleting the old one.</p><p>This approach, inspired by the principle of immutable infrastructure, has a set of considerable advantages:</p><ul><li>It is simple to explain, predictable, consistent and easy to reason about with users and engineers.</li><li>It is simple to implement, because it relies only on two core primitives, create and delete.</li><li>Implementation does not depend on Machine-specific choices, like OS, bootstrap mechanism etc.</li></ul><p>As a result, Machine rollouts drastically reduce the number of variables to be considered when managing the lifecycle of a host server that is hosting Nodes.</p><p>However, while advantages of immutability are not under discussion, both Kubernetes and Cluster API are undergoing a similar journey, introducing changes that allow users to minimize workload disruption whenever possible.</p><p>Over time, also Cluster API has introduced several improvements to immutable rollouts, including:</p><p>The new <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/cluster-api/blob/main/docs/proposals/20240807-in-place-updates.md\">in-place update</a> feature in Cluster API is the next step in this journey.</p><p>With the v1.12.0 release, Cluster API introduces support for <a href=\"https://cluster-api.sigs.k8s.io/tasks/experimental-features/runtime-sdk/implement-in-place-update-hooks\">update extensions</a> allowing users to make changes on existing machines in-place, without deleting and re-creating the Machines.</p><p>Both KubeadmControlPlane and MachineDeployments support in-place updates based on the new update extension, and this means that the boundary of what is possible in Cluster API is now changed in a significant way.</p><p>How do in-place updates work?</p><p>The simplest way to explain it is that once the user triggers an update by changing the desired state of Machines, then Cluster API chooses the best tool to achieve the desired state.</p><p>The news is that now Cluster API can choose between immutable rollouts and in-place update extensions to perform required changes.</p><p>Importantly, this is not immutable rollouts vs in-place updates; Cluster API considers both valid options and selects the most appropriate mechanism for a given change.</p><p>From the perspective of the Cluster API maintainers, in-place updates are most useful for making changes that don't otherwise require a node drain or pod restart; for example: changing user credentials for the Machine. On the other hand, when the workload will be disrupted anyway, just do a rollout.</p><p>Nevertheless, Cluster API remains true to its extensible nature, and everyone can create their own update extension and decide when and how to use in-place updates by trading in some of the benefits of immutable rollouts.</p><p><a href=\"https://cluster-api.sigs.k8s.io/tasks/experimental-features/cluster-class/\">ClusterClass</a> and managed topologies in Cluster API jointly provided a powerful and effective framework that acts as a building block for many platforms offering Kubernetes-as-a-Service.</p><p>Now with v1.12.0 this feature is making another important step forward, by allowing users to upgrade by more than one Kubernetes minor version in a single operation, commonly referred to as a <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/cluster-api/blob/main/docs/proposals/20250513-chained-and-efficient-upgrades-for-clusters-with-managed-topologies.md\">chained upgrade</a>.</p><p>This allows users to declare a target Kubernetes version and let Cluster API safely orchestrate the required intermediate steps, rather than manually managing each minor upgrade.</p><p>The simplest way to explain how chained upgrades work, is that once the user triggers an update by changing the desired version for a Cluster, Cluster API computes an upgrade plan, and then starts executing it. Rather than (for example) update the Cluster to v1.33.0 and then v1.34.0 and then v1.35.0, checking on progress at each step, a chained upgrade lets you go directly to v1.35.0.</p><p>Executing an upgrade plan means upgrading control plane and worker machines in a strictly controlled order, repeating this process as many times as needed to reach the desired state. The Cluster API is now capable of managing this for you.</p><p>Cluster API takes care of optimizing and minimizing the upgrade steps for worker machines, and in fact worker machines will skip upgrades to intermediate Kubernetes minor releases whenever allowed by the Kubernetes version skew policies.</p><p>Also in this case extensibility is at the core of this feature, and <a href=\"https://cluster-api.sigs.k8s.io/tasks/experimental-features/runtime-sdk/implement-upgrade-plan-hooks\">upgrade plan runtime extensions</a> can be used to influence how the upgrade plan is computed; similarly, <a href=\"https://cluster-api.sigs.k8s.io/tasks/experimental-features/runtime-sdk/implement-lifecycle-hooks\">lifecycle hooks</a> can be used to automate other tasks that must be performed during an upgrade, e.g. upgrading an addon after the control plane update completed.</p><p>From our perspective, chained upgrades are most useful for users that struggle to keep up with Kubernetes minor releases, and e.g. they want to upgrade only once per year and then upgrade by three versions (n-3 → n). But be warned: the fact that you can now easily upgrade by more than one minor version is not an excuse to not patch your cluster frequently!</p><p>I would like to thank all the contributors, the maintainers, and all the engineers that volunteered for the release team.</p><p>The reliability and predictability of Cluster API releases, which is one of the most appreciated features from our users, is only possible with the support, commitment, and hard work of its community.</p><p>Kudos to the entire Cluster API community for the v1.12.0 release and all the great releases delivered in 2025!\n​​\nIf you are interested in getting involved, learn about\n<a href=\"https://cluster-api.sigs.k8s.io/contributing\">Cluster API contributing guidelines</a>.</p><p>If you read the <a href=\"https://cluster-api.sigs.k8s.io/user/manifesto\">Cluster API manifesto</a>, you can see how the Cluster API subproject claims the right to remain unfinished, recognizing the need to continuously evolve, improve, and adapt to the changing needs of Cluster API’s users and the broader Cloud Native ecosystem.</p><p>As Kubernetes itself continues to evolve, the Cluster API subproject will keep advancing alongside it, focusing on safer upgrades, reduced disruption, and stronger building blocks for platforms managing Kubernetes at scale.</p><p>Innovation remains at the heart of Cluster API, stay tuned for an exciting 2026!</p>","contentLength":6886,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Complete Go Environment Setup for TSS Coordinator (MPC) with gRPC & Barbican","url":"https://blog.devops.dev/complete-go-environment-setup-for-tss-coordinator-mpc-with-grpc-barbican-58bda9ce7366?source=rss----33f8b2d9a328---4","date":1769525237,"author":"Tushar","guid":423829,"unread":true,"content":"<div><p>A step-by-step, production-ready guide to installing Go, configuring dependencies, and setting up a secure TSS (Threshold Signature…</p></div>","contentLength":134,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"The Four Knobs of AI Agent Reliability: A DevOps Perspective","url":"https://devops.com/the-four-knobs-of-ai-agent-reliability-a-devops-perspective/","date":1769503800,"author":"Arun Sanna","guid":423633,"unread":true,"content":"","contentLength":0,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"How DNS resolution works in custom docker bridge network and not on default docker0 bridge network?","url":"https://blog.devops.dev/how-dns-resolution-works-in-custom-docker-bridge-network-and-not-on-default-docker0-bridge-network-adab783cdb49?source=rss----33f8b2d9a328---4","date":1769501041,"author":"Sanjal S Eralil","guid":423658,"unread":true,"content":"<p>When you start working with Docker, one of the first surprises you encounter is that containers can’t find each other by name on the default network.

Choosing the right model matters because cluster cost, operational overhead, upgrade strategy, compliance, and automation capabilities all directly affect platform reliability and business outcomes.</p><p>While AWS offers UI-based provisioning for EKS and kOps provides direct CLI commands, this blog intentionally uses Terraform. UI or ad-hoc CLI deployment has no versioning, auditability, or repeatability. Terraform, in contrast, enables Infrastructure-as-Code, automation, resource traceability, and controlled lifecycle management. It allows teams to define the entire cluster and supporting services in code, version them, review changes, and re-provision environments consistently across development, staging, and production.</p><p>By the end of this blog, you will understand when to choose EKS vs kOps based on cost and operational needs, and why Terraform remains the preferred method for Kubernetes infrastructure provisioning on&nbsp;AWS.</p><h3>Choosing Between EKS and kOps: Which One Fits Your Use&nbsp;Case?</h3><p>When deciding between Amazon EKS and kOps for running Kubernetes on AWS, the choice largely depends on how much control, flexibility, and platform engineering maturity you need. EKS provides a managed control plane, easier onboarding, and reduced operational responsibility. However, it limits deep customization and often leads to higher overall cost due to managed control plane pricing, AWS-controlled versions/upgrades, and service add-ons that accumulate over&nbsp;time.</p><p>kOps, on the other hand, delivers full control over cluster architecture, networking, node lifecycle, and upgrade flows. It is cloud-agnostic, production-proven, and integrates well into custom platform engineering environments. With kOps you decide how the control plane runs, how networking is configured, how high-availability is achieved, and how infrastructure evolves — down to the EC2 instances, operating systems, VPC, DNS, and Kubernetes versioning. This makes kOps superior for organizations that need customization, vendor neutrality, advanced networking/security policies, or cost optimization at scale. The only real drawback is that it expects stronger Kubernetes and operations knowledge, but that is an engineering investment — not a financial cost — and ultimately improves team capability and infrastructure maturity.</p><h4>Benefits of Choosing&nbsp;kOps:</h4><ul><li>Full architectural and operational control (networking, DNS, OS, versions, HA,&nbsp;etc.)</li><li>Lower ongoing costs since no managed control plane&nbsp;fees</li><li>Easier customization for compliance, security, and topology requirements</li><li>Cloud-agnostic and not locked into AWS-specific managed&nbsp;services</li><li>Better alignment with platform engineering teams who prefer flexibility</li><li>Production-ready with mature HA and upgrade workflows</li><li>Works exceptionally well with Terraform for true end-to-end IaC</li></ul><h4>Drawbacks of Choosing&nbsp;kOps:</h4><ul><li>Requires deeper Kubernetes and infrastructure knowledge</li><li>Responsibility for control plane operations (not a monetary cost, just expertise)</li><li>More moving parts for teams unfamiliar with cluster internals</li></ul><h4>Benefits of Choosing&nbsp;EKS:</h4><ul><li>Managed control plane reduces operational responsibility</li><li>Faster onboarding for less experienced teams</li><li>Simplified upgrades and patching at the control plane&nbsp;level</li><li>Strong AWS ecosystem integrations (IAM, VPC CNI, ALB ingress,&nbsp;etc.)</li></ul><h4>Drawbacks of Choosing&nbsp;EKS:</h4><ul><li>Higher total cost (managed control plane + add-on dependencies)</li><li>Limited deep customization of Kubernetes internals</li><li>AWS-dependent upgrade schedules and compatibility constraints</li><li>Vendor lock-in and reduced infrastructure portability</li></ul><p>Before proceeding, the following prerequisites are recommended:</p><ol><li>AWS Account and IAM&nbsp;Access</li><li>kOps Installed (Only for kOps-based Cluster Walkthrough)</li></ol><pre>#install AWS CLI# macOS# Ubuntu/Debian<p>curl \"https://awscli.amazonaws.com/awscli-exe-linux-x86_64.zip\" -o \"awscliv2.zip\"</p>unzip awscliv2.zipaws configure<p># Enter your AWS Access Key ID, Secret Access Key, and default region (us-west-2)</p># macos# Ubuntu/Debian<p>wget -O- https://apt.releases.hashicorp.com/gpg | gpg --dearmor | sudo tee /usr/share/keyrings/hashicorp-archive-keyring.gpg</p>echo \"deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/hashicorp-archive-keyring.gpg] https://apt.releases.hashicorp.com $(lsb_release -cs) main\" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/hashicorp.list<p>sudo apt update &amp;&amp; sudo apt install terraform</p># macos# Ubuntu/Debian<p>curl -LO \"https://dl.k8s.io/release/$(curl -L -s https://dl.k8s.io/release/stable.txt)/bin/linux/amd64/kubectl\"</p>chmod +x kubectl<p>sudo mv kubectl /usr/local/bin/</p>kubectl version --client<p>#install kops (changed the url based on arm &amp; amd based)</p>curl -LO https://github.com/kubernetes/kops/releases/download/v1.30.0/kops-darwin-arm64    <p>chmod +x kops-darwin-arm64</p>sudo mv kops-darwin-arm64  /usr/local/bin/kops</pre><h3>Creating an EKS Cluster Using Terraform</h3><p>In this section, we will walk through provisioning a production-ready Amazon EKS cluster on AWS using Terraform. The goal is to eliminate manual provisioning steps, ensure repeatability, and maintain infrastructure through version-controlled IaC workflows.</p><h4>What This Terraform Setup&nbsp;Creates</h4><p>The Terraform configuration provisions the following resources in&nbsp;AWS:</p><ul><li>A dedicated  with public and private subnets across multiple Availability Zones</li><li> and  for routing public and private workloads</li><li> and networking associations required for EKS communication</li><li> and cluster endpoints</li><li><strong>Worker Node Groups (EC2 or Managed Node Groups)</strong> depending on configuration</li><li> for cluster operations, nodes, and service&nbsp;accounts</li><li> for cluster communication and load balancers</li><li>Associated services required for a fully functional Kubernetes cluster</li></ul><p>This ensures that once Terraform completes, you have a working Kubernetes environment where you can deploy workloads, ingress controllers, and add-on services like monitoring, logging, and autoscaling.</p><h4>Using the Terraform Module</h4><p>For this demonstration, we use an existing Terraform module hosted in the following GitHub repository, which contains reusable and modular Terraform code specifically structured for EKS provisioning. It abstracts away low-level complexity while keeping the configuration customizable.</p><p>Assuming Terraform and AWS CLI are configured locally.</p><pre>git clone https://github.com/sanskar153/EKS-clustercd EKS-clusterterraform plan</pre><p>The repository contains a <a href=\"https://github.com/sanskar153/EKS-cluster?tab=readme-ov-file#aws-eks-infrastructure-with-terraform\">README.md</a> which provides reference documentation, variable descriptions, and optional configurations. It is recommended to review the README.md for environment-specific adjustments or module parameters.</p><p>After running terraform plan, you will notice that a total of 53 resources are scheduled for creation. Review the plan output to confirm all resources, and then proceed with terraform apply</p><p>Once the apply command finishes &amp; cluster is created, use the following command to connect to it. After running it, you will also notice that your kubeconfig file (located at ~/.kube/config) has been updated with the required authentication token.</p><pre>aws eks update-kubeconfig --region &lt;region&gt; --name &lt;cluster-name&gt;</pre><p>Once provisioning is complete, your EKS cluster is ready for workloads. Application services, monitoring, and observability systems can be deployed through kubectl. You can also deploy my observability stack, linked below for reference.</p><h3>Creating an Inhouse Kubernetes Cluster Using kOps + Terraform</h3><p>kOps is a popular tool for provisioning production-grade Kubernetes clusters, especially for teams that require deeper customization, full infrastructure ownership, and cloud portability. Traditionally, kOps allows you to create clusters directly using the kops create cluster command, which provisions infrastructure on the fly. While this approach works, it lacks strong versioning, auditability, and controlled lifecycle management.</p><p>In this guide, we use kOps together with Terraform. Instead of directly applying changes through kOps, we generate Terraform manifests using the --target=terraform flag. This converts the cluster specification into Infrastructure-as-Code, enabling teams&nbsp;to:</p><ul><li>Maintain version control through&nbsp;Git</li><li>Track and review infrastructure changes before applying&nbsp;them</li><li>Integrate cluster provisioning into CI/CD pipelines</li><li>Manage upgrades gracefully through declarative state&nbsp;files</li><li>Enforce consistent and repeatable deployments across environments</li></ul><blockquote>A key detail to remember is that Kubernetes version compatibility is tied to the kOps version. If your target is Kubernetes v1.30, your kOps binary must also be v1.30 to ensure proper support and successful cluster provisioning.</blockquote><p>Prior to executing the kops create cluster command, an S3 bucket must be created to serve as the kOps state store. kOps relies on this state bucket to track configuration, updates, and cluster lifecycle. After creating the bucket, include it in the command via the --state&nbsp;flag.</p><p>Define the cluster configuration:</p><pre>kops create cluster \\  --name test.k8s.local \\<p>  --master-zones us-west-2b,us-west-2d \\</p>  --dns-zone cluster.local \\<p>  --zones us-west-2b,us-west-2d \\</p>  --topology private \\  --master-size t3.large \\  --node-size t3.large \\  --ssh-public-key ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub \\  --network-cidr 172.20.0.0/16 \\<p>  --state s3://test-cluster.state \\</p>  --target terraform \\  --yes</pre><p> Specifies the cluster name and DNS domain. For private DNS setups,&nbsp;.k8s.local is commonly&nbsp;used.</p><p><strong>--master-zones us-west-2b,us-west-2d</strong> Defines which Availability Zones will host the control plane (masters).<p> Multiple AZs enable high availability for the control&nbsp;plane.</p></p><p> Specifies the DNS zone used for resolving cluster internal DNS. In private topologies,&nbsp;.local DNS zones work without public&nbsp;records.</p><p><strong>--zones us-west-2b,us-west-2d</strong> Defines the Availability Zones for worker nodes. Matching control plane and worker zones improves latency and redundancy.</p><p> Creates a private topology where nodes are launched in private subnets without public IPs. Traffic flows through NAT gateways or bastion hosts for outbound access. This is recommended for production security.</p><p> Creates three master nodes for HA. With an odd number of nodes, etcd can maintain quorum during failures.</p><p> Instance type for control plane nodes. t3.large offers a balanced CPU/RAM profile for moderate workloads.</p><p> Creates two worker nodes. These run application workloads (pods).</p><p> Instance type for worker nodes. Can be tuned based on workload requirements, CPU-heavy vs memory-heavy applications, etc.</p><p> Defines worker node root volume size (in GB). Useful for container images, logs, and ephemeral data.</p><p><strong>--ssh-public-key ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub</strong> SSH key to access worker and master nodes via SSH if needed. Placed for troubleshooting or system management.</p><p> Selects the CNI plugin. Cilium provides advanced L3/L4/L7 observability, eBPF networking, and network security policies.</p><p><strong>--network-cidr 172.20.0.0/16</strong> CIDR range for the VPC overlay. Determines pod and node IP ranges inside the cluster&nbsp;network.</p><p><strong>--state s3://test-cluster.state</strong> Specifies the S3 bucket where kOps stores cluster configuration and state.<p> This acts as the source of truth for cluster management, upgrades, and operations.</p></p><p> Instead of provisioning directly, this outputs Terraform manifests.<p> Allows infrastructure to be version-controlled and applied via Terraform.</p></p><p> Output directory for generated Terraform files (in this case, the current directory).</p><p> Confirms execution without prompting for interactive approval.</p><p>Once you execute the above kops create cluster command with the --target=terraform flag, kOps will generate two important artifacts in the working directory:</p><ul><li>A kubernetes.tf file that defines all the AWS infrastructure components required to run the cluster (VPC, subnets, route tables, EC2 instances, security groups, IAM roles,&nbsp;etc.).</li><li>A data/ directory that contains Kubernetes manifest data and supporting templates generated by kOps for cluster bootstrapping.</li></ul><p>With these artifacts in place, you can now proceed using Terraform as the execution engine. This gives you full Infrastructure-as-Code capabilities rather than provisioning resources directly through&nbsp;kOps.</p><p>At this stage, run the following commands:</p><pre>terraform initterraform plan</pre><p>terraform plan will show all the AWS resources that are about to be created. After verifying the output and ensuring everything matches expectations, apply the changes by apply command.Terraform will then create the entire Kubernetes control plane and worker nodes along with the VPC infrastructure, networking, IAM roles, Route53 records (if applicable), and other required resources. This process effectively makes the cluster provisioning repeatable, traceable, and version-controlled through&nbsp;Git.</p><p>Once the Terraform apply step completes successfully, your Kubernetes cluster will be deployed at the infrastructure level. The next step is retrieving the kubeconfig so you can interact with the cluster using kubectl. You can obtain the kubeconfig file using&nbsp;kOps:</p><pre>kops export kubeconfig test.k8s.local --admin --admin=17520h  </pre><p>After exporting, verify connectivity:</p><p>If the nodes are in Ready state, your kOps-based Kubernetes cluster is up and running. You can now deploy applications, ingress controllers, monitoring stacks, and observability tooling using kubectl apply just like any other Kubernetes cluster.</p><p>With this setup, you have successfully provisioned your own in-house, production-ready Kubernetes cluster, independent of any managed Kubernetes service. This approach can significantly reduce AWS costs because you are only billed for the underlying EC2 instances, storage, and load balancers, rather than a managed control plane. Once the cluster is operational, it becomes crucial to monitor nodes, capture logs, and observe application behavior. For that, you can refer to my complete in-house logging and observability stack guide linked below. See you&nbsp;there.</p><p>For those interested in the complete architectural layout of the cluster from the AWS perspective, the <a href=\"https://github.com/sanskar153/kops-k8s-cluster?tab=readme-ov-file#kops-kubernetes-cluster-aws--terraform-kubernetestf\"></a> file contains comprehensive documentation. It explains which resources are provisioned, how networking is structured, and how the overall system is wired together, including diagrams and descriptions for better visualization.</p><p>From here, you retain full control over future upgrades by modifying the kOps cluster spec, regenerating Terraform manifests, and re-applying them — giving you a clean and auditable lifecycle for Kubernetes operations.</p><p>If you would like to see a follow-up article on performing zero-downtime Kubernetes version upgrades on a kOps-managed cluster, let me know. It is a topic I may cover in a future post.

It’s like the city’s main gate, everything entering the cluster must pass through here&nbsp;first.</p><p>Below is a YAML snippet of how you nornally creates a Loadbalancer service inside a kubernetes cluster:</p><pre>apiVersion: v1kind: Service  name: city-gate  type: LoadBalancer    app: city-entrance    - port: 80</pre><p>This LoadBalancer receives public traffic and forwards it to a target inside your cluster, often an Ingress Controller like  or&nbsp;.</p><h3>The Register (Ingress Resource)</h3><p><em>Spoiler: Ingress Resource itself doesn’t do anything. it’s just a set of&nbsp;rules</em></p><p>The  resource defines  incoming requests are routed once they have passed the gate.Each rule in the Ingress file is like an entry in the city’s register, mapping a hostname or path to the service that should handle&nbsp;it.</p><p>Below is a YAML snippet of how we normally define an Ingress resource:</p><pre>apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1kind: Ingress  name: city-register    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/rewrite-target: /  rules:<p>    - host: bakery.city.local</p>      http:          - path: /            backend:                name: bakery-service                  number: 80<p>    - host: library.city.local</p>      http:          - path: /            backend:                name: library-service                  number: 80</pre><p>Now when traffic for bakery.city.local arrives, the  consults this register and routes the request to the bakery&nbsp;service.</p><h3>The Guide (Ingress Controller)</h3><p>The  is the guide who makes it all&nbsp;happen.</p><p>It continuously watches your Ingress resources for the rules and act according to those rules. It ensures the routing rules are applied to your cluster’s proxy (like NGINX or HAProxy). Ingress Controller also runs as pods inside&nbsp;cluster.</p><p>You can deploy an nginx ingress controller via helm chart like&nbsp;this:</p><pre>helm repo add ingress-nginx https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginxhelm install city-guide ingress-nginx/ingress-nginx</pre><p>As soon as the ingress Controller is defined, it starts watching for any Ingress resouce. And if it found the ingress resource, it update itself according to the rules defined in that ingress resource.</p><p>Like any growing city, your Kubernetes environment needs <strong>structure, access control, and delegation</strong>.This design provides all&nbsp;three:</p><ul><li> for multiple&nbsp;services</li><li><strong>Host and path-based routing</strong> for efficient organization</li><li> through multiple controllers and classes (coming in Part&nbsp;02)</li><li> for SSL, authentication, and rate&nbsp;limiting</li></ul><p>Without this system, your services would be exposed individually&nbsp;, each with its own gate and rules&nbsp;, making it impossible to&nbsp;manage.</p><p>What will happen when the city grows&nbsp;? What if one directory (ingress resource) is unable to handle the rules of all the services that are there in our cluster&nbsp;?</p><p>T<strong>hat’s where Ingress Classes come in.

However, as these assistants gain more access to our private data, concerns about privacy, data residency, and long-term costs are at an all-time high.</p><p>By combining <a href=\"https://clawd.bot/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"></a> with <a href=\"https://docs.docker.com/ai/model-runner/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"></a>, you can build a high-performance, agentic personal assistant while keeping full control over your data, infrastructure, and spending.</p><p>This post walks through how to configure Clawdbot to utilize Docker Model Runner, enabling a privacy-first approach to personal intelligence.</p><h2>What Are Clawdbot and Docker Model Runner?</h2><p> is a self-hosted AI assistant designed to live where you already are. Unlike browser-bound bots, Clawdbot integrates directly with messaging apps like <strong>Telegram, WhatsApp, Discord, and Signal</strong>. It acts as a proactive digital coworker capable of executing real-world actions across your devices and services.</p><p><strong>Docker Model Runner (DMR)</strong> is Docker’s native solution for running and managing large language models (LLMs) as OCI artifacts. It exposes an OpenAI-compatible API, allowing it to serve as the private “brain” for any tool that supports standard AI endpoints.</p><p>Together, they create a unified assistant that can browse the web, manage your files, and respond to your messages without ever sending your sensitive data to a third-party cloud.</p><h2>Benefits of the Clawdbot + DMR Stack</h2><p>In a “Privacy-First” setup, your assistant’s memory, message history, and files stay on your hardware. Docker Model Runner isolates model inference, meaning:</p><ul><li> Your personal emails and schedules aren’t used to train future commercial models.</li></ul><ul><li> Models run in isolated environments, protecting your host system.</li></ul><ul><li> You decide exactly which “Skills” (web browsing, file access) the assistant can use.</li></ul><p>Cloud-based agents often become expensive when they use “long-term memory” or “proactive searching,” which consume massive amounts of tokens. With Docker Model Runner, inference runs on your own GPU/CPU. Once a model is pulled, there are . You can let Clawdbot summarize thousands of unread emails or research complex topics for hours without worrying about a surprise API bill at the end of the month.</p><h2>Configuring Clawdbot with Docker Model Runner</h2><h3><strong>Modifying the Clawdbot Configuration</strong></h3><p>Clawdbot uses a flexible configuration system to define which models and providers drive its reasoning. While the onboarding wizard (clawdbot onboard) is the standard setup path, you can manually point Clawdbot to your private Docker infrastructure.</p><p>You can define your provider configuration in:</p><ul><li> ~/.config/clawdbot/config.json</li><li><strong>Workspace-specific configuration:</strong> clawdbot.json in your active workspace root.</li></ul><h3>Using Clawdbot with Docker Model Runner</h3><p>To bridge the two, update your configuration to point to the DMR server. Assuming Docker Model Runner is running at its default address: http://localhost:12434/v1.</p><p>Your config.json should be updated as follows:</p><div><pre>{\n  \"models\": {\n    \"providers\": {\n      \"dmr\": {\n        \"baseUrl\": \"http://localhost:12434/v1\",\n        \"apiKey\": \"dmr-local\",\n        \"api\": \"openai-completions\",\n        \"models\": [\n          {\n            \"id\": \"gpt-oss:128K\",\n            \"name\": \"gpt-oss (128K context window)\",\n            \"contextWindow\": 128000,\n            \"maxTokens\": 128000\n          },\n          {\n            \"id\": \"glm-4.7-flash:128K\",\n            \"name\": \"glm-4.7-flash (128K context window)\",\n            \"contextWindow\": 128000,\n            \"maxTokens\": 128000\n          }\n        ]\n      }\n    }\n  },\n  \"agents\": {\n    \"defaults\": {\n      \"model\": {\n        \"primary\": \"dmr/gpt-oss:128K\"\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n\n</pre></div><p>This configuration tells Clawdbot to bypass external APIs and route all “thinking” to your private models.</p><div><p><strong>Note for Docker Desktop Users:</strong>Ensure TCP access is enabled so Clawdbot can communicate with the runner. Run the following command in your terminal:<p>docker desktop enable model-runner –tcp</p></p></div><h2>Recommended Models for Personal Assistants</h2><p>While coding models focus on logic, personal assistant models need a balance of instruction-following, tool-use capability, and long-term memory.</p><div><table><tbody><tr><td><p>Complex reasoning &amp; scheduling</p></td><td><p>docker model pull gpt-oss</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Fast coding assistance and debugging</p></td><td><p>docker model pull glm-4.7-flash</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>docker model pull qwem3-coder</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><h3>Pulling models from the ecosystem</h3><p>DMR can pull models directly from  and convert them into OCI artifacts automatically:</p><div><pre>docker model pull huggingface.co/bartowski/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct-GGUF\n</pre></div><h3><strong>Context Length and “Soul”</strong></h3><p>For a personal assistant, context length is critical. Clawdbot relies on a  file (which defines its personality) and a  (which stores your preferences).</p><p>If a model’s default context is too small, it will “forget” your instructions mid-conversation. You can use DMR to repackage a model with a larger context window:</p><div><pre>docker model package --from llama3.3 --context-size 128000 llama-personal:128k\n</pre></div><p>Once packaged, reference llama-personal:128k in your Clawdbot config to ensure your assistant always remembers the full history of your requests.</p><h2>Putting Clawdbot to Work: Running Scheduled Tasks&nbsp;</h2><p>With Clawdbot and DMR running, you can move beyond simple chat. Let’s set up a “Morning Briefing” task.</p><ol><li> docker model ls (Ensure your model is active).</li><li> Run clawdbot init-soul to define how the assistant should talk to you.</li><li>“Clawdbot, every morning at 8:00 AM, check my unread emails, summarize the top 3 priorities, and message me the summary on Telegram.”</li></ol><p>Because Clawdbot is connected to your private Docker Model Runner, it can parse those emails and reason about your schedule privately. No data leaves your machine; you simply receive a helpful notification on your phone via your chosen messaging app.</p><p>The Clawdbot and Docker Model Runner ecosystems are growing rapidly.

I have focused my degree to have a machine learning specialization and my first two classes were Machine Learning for Trading (ML4T) and Software Architecture and Design CS&nbsp;6310.</p><p>My Machine Learning for Trading Class focused on building a simulated trading system incrementally through the use of machine learning. I was assigned 8 projects throughout the class that helped me building this trading system while covering topics such as: market simulation, portfolio optimization, technical indicators, supervised learning, and reinforcement learning. Taking this class showed me the realistic capabilities of machine learning in the field of trading and understanding its limits in financial markets.</p><p>This project involved simulating an American Roulette Wheel to show us how the odds are set up for the House to always win. We are given the following betting strategy to implement:</p><ul><li>Start with 1 dollar and betting on Black&nbsp;only</li><li>If you win, keep betting 1 dollar, if you lose double your&nbsp;bet</li><li>Don’t stop playing until you win 80&nbsp;dollars.</li></ul><p>With this strategy I ran two experiments. The first experiment ran this strategy with an unlimited bankroll which meant you can keep betting forever until you win 80 dollars. This experiment’s expected value and probability had made it seem like a great strategy. In the second experiment, a bankroll was added to make it more realistic so that the person cannot keep betting if they keep losing forever. This experiment’s expected value and probability had showed that in the real world this scenario was very risky and not profitable. Thus through the expected value I learned that this strategy can still lose money long term even if I “win most of the time” which is just what the casinos want you to focus&nbsp;on.</p><p>Project 2: Optimize Something:</p><p>In this project I was exposed to metrics to evaluate portfolios such&nbsp;as:</p><ul><li>Cumulative Return: total gain or loss of portfolio.</li><li>Average Daily Return: mean of portfolio’s daily&nbsp;returns.</li><li>Volatility(std of daily returns): measure of how much a portfolio’s daily returns fluctuate.</li><li>Sharpe Ratio (return relative to risk): risk adjusted metric to measure how much return a portfolio gets per unit of volatility or&nbsp;risk.</li></ul><p>I got to use Scipy’s minimize function to minimize the negative Sharpe Ratio and return the portfolio statistics above to find out the optimal stock allocations or weights from a set of givens stocks to maximize&nbsp;returns.</p><p>Project 3: Assess&nbsp;Learners</p><p>This project focused on supervised machine learning. I implemented the following supervised learners from&nbsp;scratch:</p><ul><li>Decision Tree learner: makes decisions by splitting data based on feature values. Easy to understand but can overfit and become too specific to training&nbsp;data.</li><li>Random Tree learner: works the same as a decision tree but adds randomness when choosing which feature values to split the data on to help prevent overfitting.</li><li>Bag Learner: trains the same model on slightly different variations of data and averages the results to get a more general&nbsp;result.</li><li>Insane Learner: Combines a bunch of bag learners together and takes their average to further reduce variance.</li></ul><p>This project helped me understand the concept of overfitting and how a model can perform amazing on training data but then do poorly on out-of-sample data because it failed to properly generalize and pick up on the patterns in the data. I tested to see if leaf size is related to overfitting using the RMSE metric. I also got to see how using ensemble methods like bagging can reduce overfitting.</p><p>Project 4: Defeat&nbsp;Learners</p><p>This project built on project 3 and I had to try to change up the datasets to be able to defeat one of my learners. Here I got to see the strengths and weaknesses of different supervised learning models. I&nbsp;created:</p><ul><li>A dataset where linear regression outperformed the decision&nbsp;trees</li><li>A dataset where decision trees consistently outperformed linear regression</li></ul><p>Through this project I learned that there is no single best performing learned and that model performance relies on the data being&nbsp;used.</p><p>Here I got to build a market simulator that keeps track of how much money the portfolio given makes over time. This simulation took into&nbsp;account:</p><ul><li>Portfolio value computation</li><li>Commission and market&nbsp;impact</li></ul><p>I was given a list of stocks and their orders and had to calculate how much money is accumulated at the end as shown below:Input:</p><pre># InputDate,Symbol,Order,Shares 2008-12-8,AAPL,SELL,130 </pre><pre># Output2008-12-3 1000000 2008-12-5 999754.30</pre><p>Project 6: Indicator Evaluation</p><p>In project 6 I was introduced to and implemented the following 5 technical indicators:</p><ul><li>Bollinger Bands: measures how for stock price deviates from its moving average using standard deviation.</li><li>Stochastic Oscillator: Compares current stock price to its recent price range to indicate momentum and potential price reversals.</li><li>MACD: Looks at difference between two moving averages to identify changes in trend direction and momentum.</li><li>Simple Moving Average (SMA): Calculates average price over fixed window to identify changes in trend direction and momentum.</li><li>Momentum: Measures rate of change in price over time to indicate strength and direction of&nbsp;trend.</li></ul><p>These technical indicators were then visualized with graphs and used to determine the overbought and oversold conditions (short or long signals) for each indicator. To have an upper bound I implemented a Theoretically Optimal Strategy that assumes knowledge of future prices and always takes the correct short or long position. This strategy was evaluated against a benchmark which was buying and holding shares of a stock for the entire trading&nbsp;period.</p><p>Project 7: QLearning Robot</p><p>In this project I got to implement a Q-Learner from scratch and got a deeper understanding of reinforcement learning. This Q Learner learns through finding out the optimal action to take through trial and error with its environment and updating its Q table with the observed rewards and state transitions. I also learned and implemented a technique called Dyna-Q to improve learning speed by allowing the learner to simulate experiences to better accelerate convergence. This project showed me the importance between exploration and exploitation and how there needs to be a balance between the learner taking actions which it already knows the outcome/reward to versus taking new unexplored actions.</p><p>Project 8: Strategy Evaluation</p><p>For this final project I got to implement what I learned in the previous projects to create a stock trading bot. I implemented the following 2 strategies:</p><ul><li>Manual Strategy — a manual trading strategy based on 3 indicators of my choosing with manual thresholds on when to buy and sell for each indicator</li><li>Learner Strategy — Here I used my Q learner to use my 3 chosen indicators to learn the best trading strategy.</li></ul><p>On in sample data my strategy learner was able to outperform the manual and benchmark but when tested with out of sample data, my strategy learner did poorly which is shows that it overfitted to the training data and was not able to generalize properly.</p><p>Taking this Machine Learning for Trading class introduced be to the different supervised learning and reinforcement learning algorithms, how they work, and more importantly, when and how to use each one for real world applications such as&nbsp;trading.</p><p>My second class: Software Architecture and Design, helped me think beyond writing code, about designing systems that can scale and withstand change. Here I analyzed why systems fail, where complexity comes from and how design decisions early on can prevent costly problems&nbsp;later.</p><p>I was taught to slow down and ask these questions when thinking about implementing a&nbsp;system:</p><ul><li>What are the core responsibilities of this&nbsp;system?</li><li>Which components interact with each other and which are isolated?</li><li>How accepting to change will this system be as requirements evolve?</li></ul><p>This helped me think beyond files and functions and instead think in terms of modular components each with their own responsibilities and interactions.</p><p>Through this course I was introduced to UML (Unified Modeling Language). This language provides a visual representation of how a software system is structured and how its parts interact. I got hands on experience with class and sequence diagrams when I had to design a pokemon battle simulation. The class diagrams helped me take verbal descriptions of a system and be able to identify and categorize these requirements into classes while the sequence diagrams helped me visualize all the possible flows of the system to get a thorough understanding.</p><p>I learned about key system design concepts such&nbsp;as:</p><ul><li>Single Responsibility Principle: making sure each class only does one&nbsp;thing.</li><li>Coupling: how much components depend on each&nbsp;other.</li><li>Cohesion: degree to which components work together to fulfill a&nbsp;purpose</li></ul><p>and got to put these concepts to use through peer reviewing my fellow classmate’s submissions. This taught me how to spot inefficiencies in a system’s design such as spotting tight coupling, lack of modularity, and being able to explain why a system’s design is strong or&nbsp;weak.</p><p>I got to learn about the following architectural styles as&nbsp;well:</p><ul><li>Layered Architectures: a system with layers where each layer has a clear responsibility and only depends on the layer below&nbsp;it.</li><li>Object-Oriented Systems: software with interacting objects that combine data and behavior and promote encapsulation, modular design and code&nbsp;reuse.</li><li>Pipe-and-Filter: process in which data is passed through a sequence of independent steps otherwise known as filters, where each stage transforms the data and passes it onto the next&nbsp;filter.</li><li>Event-Driven Systems: Components communicating by emitting and responding to events at their own time allowing the system to be loosely coupled and react asynchronously.</li></ul><p>At the end of this class, I was left with these key takeaways:</p><ul><li>Design decisions matter most before code implementation</li><li>A good system design makes change easier not&nbsp;harder</li><li>Extracting requirements/diagraming out the system and having discussions regarding architecture are paramount to creating an efficient scalable&nbsp;system.</li></ul><p>Both these classes have taught me a lot and I can’t wait to get started on my next semester where I will be taking Machine Learning and Human Computer Interaction!</p><img src=\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=3be77e20a37c\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" alt=\"\">","contentLength":10341,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Docker Sandboxes: Run Claude Code and Other Coding Agents Unsupervised (but Safely)","url":"https://www.docker.com/blog/docker-sandboxes-run-claude-code-and-other-coding-agents-unsupervised-but-safely/","date":1769439600,"author":"Srini Sekaran","guid":421543,"unread":true,"content":"<p>We introduced Docker Sandboxes in experimental preview a few months ago.

Garbage collection refers to the automatic process of identifying and removing objects or resources that are no longer needed by the system. In programming languages, garbage collection generally deals with memory. However, in Kubernetes, it deals with resources such as pods, containers, and&nbsp;volumes.</p><p>Recently, I ran into an interesting issue while working with Kubernetes. I had a  where the desired replication count was set to 1 This mean there should be only one pod running at any given time. Surprisingly, when I checked the cluster, I found : one in a running state and another in an error state. This is not an ideal state. As per the Deployment specification, there should be only one pod&nbsp;active.</p><p>This anomaly sparked my curiosity about how Kubernetes handles resource cleanup and led me to explore <strong>garbage collection in Kubernetes</strong>. I wanted to understand why a pod in an error state wasn’t automatically removed and how Kubernetes decides which resources to clean&nbsp;up.</p><h3>What is Garbage Collection in Kubernetes?</h3><p>In Kubernetes,  is the process of automatically cleaning up resources that are no longer needed. This helps maintain cluster health and ensures that failed or unused objects don’t accumulate and consume resources over time. Kubernetes uses several mechanisms and policies to manage the lifecycle of resources and to perform cleanup of resources. Garbage collection helps in the prevention of issues such as orphaned pods, unused volumes, and other lingering resources.</p><p>Some of the resources that are commonly cleaned up&nbsp;include:</p><ul><li>: Pods that are completed and they are in failed or completed.</li><li>: ReplicaSets which are in used state due to Deployment updates.</li><li>: Stopped containers associated with pods that have been&nbsp;deleted.</li><li>: Unused PersistentVolumeClaims and their associated PersistentVolumes.</li><li>: ConfigMaps, Secrets, and other objects that might be orphaned when their owner is&nbsp;deleted.</li></ul><p>Understanding how Kubernetes garbage collection works is key to maintaining a healthy, efficient, and predictable cluster. In the next sections, I will dive deeper into the actual mechanisms, policies, and best practices for Kubernetes garbage collection.</p><h3>Garbage Collection of Completed Resources</h3><p>Kubernetes implements garbage collection to automatically clean up resources that have completed their lifecycle. This is particularly important for resources such as  and . These objects may terminate after completing their work, but could linger and consume cluster resources if not cleaned up by garbage collector.</p><h4>Garbage Collection for&nbsp;Pods</h4><p>The <strong>Pod Garbage Collector (PodGC)</strong> that is part of the . It is responsible for removing pods that have reached a completed state,  or&nbsp;.</p><p>The behaviour of PodGC is controlled by the --terminated-pod-gc-threshold flag in the kube-controller-manager. This threshold defines the maximum number of terminated pods that can exist in the cluster before the garbage collector starts cleaning them up. The default value is&nbsp;12500.</p><h4>Garbage Collection for&nbsp;Jobs</h4><p> are a special type of Kubernetes resource designed to run tasks to completion. Unlike regular pods, jobs track the completion of one or more pods until all tasks are finished.</p><p>The garbage collection of jobs works slightly differently. A job in  or  state whether in a  or  state can be automatically removed based on the spec.ttlSecondsAfterFinished attribute in the job definition. This attribute specifies how long the job information should be retained after completion and can be customised as per your requirements.</p><pre>apiVersion: batch/v1kind: Job  name: example-job  ttlSecondsAfterFinished: 3600     spec:      - name: example        command: [\"echo\", \"Hello Kubernetes!\"]</pre><p>In this example, the job will be automatically cleaned up after it finishes, whether the job succeeds or&nbsp;fails.</p><h3>Garbage Collection for Orphaned Resources</h3><p>Kubernetes also handles cleanup of  (resources that no longer have a parent object). This is managed through following ways:</p><ul><li>: Defines parent-child relationships between resources.</li><li>: Defines how dependent resources are removed when the parent is&nbsp;deleted.</li></ul><p>These mechanisms ensure that all associated child resources are automatically cleaned up, when a parent resource is removed. This prevents orphaned objects from lingering in the cluster and maintaining cluster&nbsp;hygiene.</p><p>When a Kubernetes object creates dependent resources, it defines  in those child objects. This configuration allows the Kubernetes garbage collector to determine which resources can be safely deleted when the owner is removed. Let’s consider an example of Deploymentresource:</p><ul><li>When a Deployment is created, Kubernetes automatically creates a ReplicaSet to maintain the desired number of pods. The ReplicaSet has an  pointing to the Deployment.</li></ul><pre>ownerReferences:  - apiVersion: apps/v1    controller: true    name: my-deployment<p>    uid: afa2b2df-5ae7-41aa-8f17-7c2b3d65b473</p></pre><ul><li>Each pod created by the ReplicaSet has an  pointing to its ReplicaSet as&nbsp;well.</li></ul><pre>ownerReferences:  - apiVersion: apps/v1    controller: true    name: my-deployment-56467d566<p>    uid: b5a5f94e-edbd-4deb-b080-9b9034152bf2</p></pre><p>The blockOwnerDeletion: true ensures that the Deployment cannot be deleted until the dependent ReplicaSet is cleaned up, and controller: true indicates that the parent is managing this child resource. When the Deployment object is deleted, the garbage collector uses these owner references to automatically remove the ReplicaSet and all the associated pods.</p><p>Kubernetes also supports  that defines how and when child resources are deleted when their parent resource is removed. Similar to owner references, cascading deletion ensures that dependent objects do not remain orphaned in the cluster. There are two&nbsp;types:</p><ul><li><strong>Foreground cascading deletion</strong>: The parent resource is marked for deletion first, but the deletion is  until all dependent resources are deleted. This ensures that no child resources remain after the parent is&nbsp;removed.</li></ul><pre>kubectl delete deployment my-deployment --cascade=foreground</pre><p>In this scenario, the Deployment will only be fully deleted after its ReplicaSets and Pods are&nbsp;removed.</p><ul><li><strong>Background cascading deletion: </strong>The parent resource is deleted immediately, and the garbage collector asynchronously deletes all dependent resources in the background.</li></ul><pre>kubectl delete deployment my-deployment --cascade=background</pre><p>In this case, the Deployment disappears immediately, while its ReplicaSets and Pods are cleaned up by the garbage collector afterward.</p><h3>Garbage Collection with&nbsp;Kubelet</h3><p>The  is responsible for garbage collection on the worker node that manages both  and  to prevent disk pressure and resource exhaustion.</p><p>The kubelet cleans up unused container images based on configurable parameters defined in the KubeletConfiguration:</p><ul><li>: Minimum age for unused images before they can be removed. Default value is&nbsp;2m.</li><li>: Maximum age for unused images before removal. Default value is 0s that means the attribute is disabled by&nbsp;default.</li><li><strong>imageGCHighThresholdPercent</strong>: Disk usage percentage that triggers garbage collection. Default value is&nbsp;85%.</li><li><strong>imageGCLowThresholdPercent</strong>: Disk usage percentage below which garbage collection stops. Must be lower than the high threshold. Default value is&nbsp;80%.</li></ul><p>When disk usage exceeds the high threshold, kubelet removes the least recently used images until usage drops below the low threshold.</p><p>Example KubeletConfiguration snippet:</p><pre>apiVersion: kubelet.config.k8s.io/v1beta1kind: KubeletConfigurationimageMaximumGCAge: \"0s\"<p>imageGCHighThresholdPercent: 85</p>imageGCLowThresholdPercent: 80</pre><blockquote><em> In Kubernetes v1.20+, older container-level flags such as </em><em>--minimum-container-ttl-duration, </em><em>--maximum-dead-containers, and </em><em>--maximum-dead-containers-per-container are deprecated. Container cleanup is now handled automatically based on node pressure.</em></blockquote><h4>Eviction-Based Garbage Collection</h4><p>Kubelet monitors node-level resource usage continuously. When resources such as memory, disk space, inodes, or PIDs drop below certain thresholds, kubelet triggers  to free up space and maintain node&nbsp;health:</p><ol><li>Kubelet first removes <strong>stopped or dead containers</strong>.</li><li>Next, it deletes  if space is still&nbsp;low.</li><li>Finally, if pressure persists, kubelet  based on their priority.</li></ol><p>These thresholds are controlled via the following configuration parameters:</p><ul><li>: Defines the eviction thresholds that immediately trigger garbage collection when breached.</li><li>: Defines the eviction thresholds that trigger cleanup after a grace period if still under pressure.</li><li>: Specifies how long kubelet waits after a soft threshold is crossed before performing GC.</li></ul><p>The aforementioned configuration parameters represent different types of node resource metrics tracked by the Kubelet that help it decide when to initiate eviction or garbage collection actions:</p><ol><li>: Triggers eviction if the amount of available memory on the node is below threshold (default value varies by setup, generally 100Mi-200Mi.</li><li>: Initiates DiskPressure eviction when percentage of free disk space on the root filesystem is below the defined threshold (default&nbsp;~10%).</li><li>Percentage of free inodes on the root filesystem. Triggers eviction when inode usage is high (default&nbsp;~5%).</li><li>Percentage of free disk space on the container image filesystem. Triggers eviction when low (default&nbsp;~15%).</li><li>Percentage of free inodes on the image filesystem. Triggers eviction when inode usage is high (default&nbsp;~5%).</li><li>Percentage of free disk space on the container writable layer filesystem; triggers eviction if low (default&nbsp;~10%).</li><li>Percentage of free inodes on the container writable layer filesystem; triggers eviction when inode usage is high (default&nbsp;~5%).</li><li>Triggers PIDPressure eviction when the number of available PIDs on the node are below threshold (default&nbsp;~1000).</li></ol><p>Example KubeletConfiguration for evictions:</p><pre>apiVersion: kubelet.config.k8s.io/v1beta1kind: KubeletConfiguration  memory.available: \"200Mi\"  imagefs.available: \"15%\"<p>  containerfs.available: \"10%\"</p>  pid.available: \"1000\"  memory.available: \"400Mi\"  imagefs.available: \"20%\"<p>  containerfs.available: \"15%\"</p>  pid.available: \"2000\"  memory.available: \"30s\"  imagefs.available: \"2m\"<p>  containerfs.available: \"1m\"</p>  pid.available: \"30s\"</pre><h3>Garbage Collection with Finalizers</h3><p>Finalizers are a mechanism that allows resources to perform custom cleanup actions before they are fully deleted. When a resource with a finalizer is deleted, Kubernetes does not immediately remove it. Instead, the resource remains in a terminating state until all finalizers complete their tasks. Let’s look at the working of finalizers:</p><ul><li>Finalizers are strings added to the metadata.finalizers list of a resource.</li><li>Kubernetes calls the associated cleanup logic for each finalizer, when the resource is&nbsp;deleted</li><li>Only after all finalizers are executed successfully does the resource get fully removed from the&nbsp;cluster.</li></ul><p>This ensures that important cleanup operations such as removing external dependencies or notifying other systems are completed before the resource is&nbsp;gone.</p><pre>apiVersion: v1kind: Pod  name: example-pod    - example.com/custom-cleanup</pre><p>In this example, the pod will remain in the Terminating state until the logic associated with example.com/custom-cleanup is executed successfully.</p><h3>Best Practices for Kubernetes Garbage Collection</h3><p>Properly managing garbage collection in Kubernetes is critical to ensure cluster stability, resource efficiency and predictable application behaviour. Following are key best practices to consider:</p><ol><li><strong>Monitor Garbage Collection Metrics: </strong>Monitoring is the first step to effective garbage collection. Kubernetes exposes metrics for pods, jobs, containers, and images that allow you to track how frequently resources are being removed and whether thresholds are being breached. Tools such as  and  can help visualize these metrics, providing insights into pod terminations, container cleanup events, image deletions, and eviction triggers. Regular monitoring ensures that garbage collection is functioning as expected and helps you detect anomalies before they impact workloads.</li><li><strong>Adjust Thresholds and Resource Limits: </strong>Kubelet and cluster-level garbage collection rely on thresholds such as imageGCHighThresholdPercent, imageGCLowThresholdPercent, and eviction parameters like memory.available or nodefs.available. These defaults may not suit all workloads, especially in clusters with high pod churn or large images. Adjust thresholds according to your resource usage patterns to avoid premature cleanup or excessive accumulation of unused resources. Proper configuration prevents unexpected evictions and maintains node&nbsp;health.</li><li>Regularly review the usage of CPU, memory, disk, and inodes across nodes. Excessive accumulation of terminated pods, unused images, or orphaned resources can degrade node performance and cluster stability. Use metrics-server or similar tools to keep track of resource consumption and proactively manage workloads to prevent resource pressure that would trigger garbage collection or evictions.</li><li><strong>Leverage PreStop Hooks and Finalizers: </strong>Custom cleanup logic can be handled with preStop hooks for containers and finalizers for Kubernetes objects. PreStop hooks allow you to gracefully terminate workloads that ensures tasks complete and connections close before the pod is removed. Finalizers provide a mechanism to perform cleanup of external resources or dependent objects before the parent resource is deleted. Using these mechanisms ensures controlled, predictable cleanup beyond what the default garbage collector handles automatically.</li><li><strong>Implement Image Lifecycle Management: </strong>Container images can occupy significant disk space. Regularly review and manage images using lifecycle policies to remove unused or outdated images. Combine this with Kubelet’s image garbage collection to ensure nodes do not run out of disk space. Tagging strategies, image pruning, and cleaning up dangling images help prevent unnecessary storage consumption and maintain cluster efficiency.</li><li><strong>Manage Completed and Orphaned Resources: </strong>Completed resources such as finished jobs or terminated pod should be configured with TTLs or rely on Kubelet cleanup policies to remove them automatically. Similarly, ensure that owner references and cascading deletion are correctly configured so that orphaned resources like ReplicaSets or Pods do not linger in the cluster. This keeps the resource hierarchy clean and prevents accumulation of unnecessary objects.</li><li>Periodically audit your cluster for stale resources, unexpected terminations, or blocked finalizers. This helps identify and resolve issues with misconfigured garbage collection, orphaned resources, or resource leaks. Audits combined with monitoring help maintain a healthy and predictable environment for workloads.</li></ol><p>Garbage collection is a silent yet essential guardian of Kubernetes clusters, ensuring that resources are used efficiently, nodes remain healthy, and workloads run smoothly. Kubernetes provides multiple layers of automated cleanup such as cleaning up completed pods, jobs and automatically removing orphaned resources through owner references and cascading deletions. On the node level, Kubelet’s garbage collection, coupled with eviction based mechanisms, keeps disk, memory, and PID usage under control. Also, finalizers allow developers to implement controlled and custom cleanup logic for critical resources.</p><p>By understanding how these mechanisms work and following best practices such as monitoring metrics, adjusting thresholds, managing images and leveraging hooks and finalizers. you can maintain a clean, efficient, and predictable Kubernetes environment. Proper garbage collection is not just about removing unused resources, it is about ensuring cluster stability, improving performance, and empowering teams to focus on delivering value rather than managing&nbsp;clutter.</p><p>In essence, mastering Kubernetes garbage collection transforms resource management from a reactive chore into a proactive strategy for healthy, scalable clusters.</p><p><strong><em>If you find my work valuable and would like to support it, you are welcome to </em></strong><a href=\"http://paypal.me/anishkumar14743\"></a></p><img src=\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=05a939989eda\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" alt=\"\">","contentLength":16181,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Ephemeral Storage in Kubernetes: The Power Behind Temporary Data","url":"https://blog.devops.dev/ephemeral-storage-in-kubernetes-the-power-behind-temporary-data-55e97f641e77?source=rss----33f8b2d9a328---4","date":1769414744,"author":"Anish Kumar","guid":421398,"unread":true,"content":"<p>When working with Kubernetes, storage is one of the most crucial and often misunderstood components of application deployment. While Persistent Volumes (PVs) receive most of the attention for maintaining data durability, ephemeral storage plays an equally important role for workloads where data persistence is not required.</p><p>Ephemeral storage refers to temporary data volumes that exist only for the duration of a Pod’s lifecycle. Once the Pod is deleted, the data disappears too. This makes ephemeral storage ideal for caching, logs, temporary files and other transient data. The following is a simple example of how to configure ephemeral storage in a&nbsp;Pod:</p><p>Anish Kumar is a reader-supported publication. To receive new posts and support my work, consider becoming a free or paid subscriber.</p><pre>apiVersion: v1kind: Pod  name: ephemeral-example  containers:    image: nginx    - name: cache-volume<p>      mountPath: /usr/share/nginx/cache</p>  volumes:    emptyDir: {}</pre><p>The emptyDir volume is created when the Pod starts and deleted when the Pod&nbsp;stops.</p><p>Ephemeral storage enables faster startup times and reduces unnecessary disk I/O for non-critical data. Additionally, it helps workloads remain stateless and portable. Since Kubernetes uses the underlying worker node’s local storage or ephemeral volumes, it delivers high performance.</p><h3>Types of Ephemeral Volumes</h3><p>Kubernetes provides multiple ways to use ephemeral storage that depends on the specific requirement of your application. The following is the comprehensive list of ephemeral volume&nbsp;types:</p><p>The emptyDir type is the most common form of ephemeral volume in Kubernetes. It is automatically created when a Pod is assigned to a node and exists only for as long as the Pod runs on that node. Once the Pod is deleted, evicted, or rescheduled the data stored inside the emptyDir volume is permanently removed.</p><pre>volumes:- name: temp-storage    sizeLimit: 500Mi</pre><p>You can specify medium: Memory to store data in RAM instead of the node’s disk. This configuration provides extremely fast I/O performance and is ideal for workloads that require quick read and write access such as caching or buffering. Since it relies on RAM, it is limited by the available memory on the&nbsp;node.</p><p>A configMap volume allows you to inject configuration data into Pods as files or environment variables. It is mainly used to decouple configuration details from container images that makes applications more flexible and easier to&nbsp;manage.</p><pre>volumes:- name: config-volume    name: app-config</pre><p>This setup ensures that configuration data is available to the container while the Pod is running, and it is automatically removed when the Pod is terminated. However, it is important to note that large ConfigMaps can increase Pod startup time and memory usage, they should be used primarily for lightweight configuration data.</p><p>The downwardAPI volume allows Pods to expose their own metadata and runtime information such as the Pod name, namespace, labels or annotations to containers as files or environment variables. It provides applications with visibility into their own configuration or environment without the need for external&nbsp;APIs.</p><pre>volumes:- name: podinfo    items:      fieldRef:<p>        fieldPath: metadata.labels</p></pre><p>This approach is particularly useful for monitoring agents, logging tools, or applications that need to access Pod-specific metadata at runtime for identification or configuration purposes. However, it should be used carefully to avoid exposing sensitive metadata and it is best suited for ephemeral data.</p><p>secret volumes are similar to ConfigMaps but are specifically designed to store and manage sensitive data such as credentials, API keys, tokens or certificates. Kubernetes ensures that this data is securely mounted into Pods as files that keeps it isolated from application code and container images.</p><pre>volumes:- name: secret-volume    secretName: db-credentials</pre><p>The secret data is automatically removed when the Pod is terminated. It is important to handle these volumes carefully to prevent accidental exposure through logs or debugging tools. Also, it is recommended to use Kubernetes RBAC to restrict who can view or modify&nbsp;secrets.</p><h4>5. image (container image&nbsp;layers)</h4><p>Every container image in Kubernetes uses ephemeral storage to store its unpacked layers when the Pod is created. These layers make up the container’s filesystem and are stored temporarily on the node’s local disk. When the Pod is deleted or rescheduled, the space used by these image layers is automatically reclaimed.</p><pre>apiVersion: v1kind: Pod  name: image-example  containers:    image: nginx:latest<p>    imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent</p></pre><p>The way Kubernetes handles these image layers depends on the imagePullPolicy that defines when and how images are pulled from the container registry.</p><ul><li> Forces Kubernetes to pull the latest image every time the Pod starts. This ensures freshness but increases network usage and ephemeral storage consumption.</li><li> Uses the locally cached image if it is already available on the node that reduces storage and network overhead.</li><li> Uses only pre-pulled images on the node and skips pulling from the registry entirely.</li></ul><p><strong>Container Storage Interface (CSI) Ephemeral Volumes</strong> provide a flexible way to dynamically attach short-lived storage directly to Pods using CSI drivers. These volumes are created and managed by the CSI driver on the node where the Pod runs and they are automatically deleted when the Pod is terminated.</p><pre>volumes:- name: csi-ephemeral    driver: example.csi.driver      size: \"2Gi”</pre><p>This makes them ideal for temporary workloads that need specialized storage features, such as encryption, compression, or performance tuning, without requiring persistent volume claims. The CSI ephemeral volume has following limitations:</p><ul><li>These volumes  between Pods as they are tied to a single Pod’s lifecycle.</li><li>The <strong>CSI driver must explicitly support ephemeral mode</strong> for this feature to work as not all drivers offer this capability.</li></ul><p>CSI ephemeral volumes are particularly useful for Pods that require temporary but customized storage provisioning. This offers the benefits of dynamic storage management while maintaining the transient nature of ephemeral data.</p><h4>7. Generic Ephemeral Volumes</h4><p><strong>Generic Ephemeral Volumes</strong> bridge the gap between basic ephemeral storage options such as emptyDir and more advanced persistent volumes. This allows developers to dynamically provision temporary storage using a <strong>PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC) template</strong> that is managed by Kubernetes. These volumes can take advantage of <strong>dynamic storage provisioning</strong> through existing StorageClasses that makes them more powerful and flexible for complex workloads that still need ephemeral behaviour.</p><pre>volumes:- name: gen-ephemeral    volumeClaimTemplate:        accessModes: [\"ReadWriteOnce\"]          requests:</pre><p>In this configuration, Kubernetes automatically creates a temporary PVC for the Pod using the provided template. The underlying storage is provisioned dynamically and it is automatically deleted when the Pod terminates.</p><h3>Ephemeral Storage&nbsp;Working</h3><p>Ephemeral storage in Kubernetes is designed to provide short-lived, high-performance space that exists only during the lifecycle of a Pod. It operates at multiple levels including the container’s writable layer, Pod-level volumes, and dynamically provisioned temporary PVCs. The following components define how ephemeral storage functions inside a&nbsp;cluster.</p><p>Each container in a Pod has its own  on top of the image layers. This writable layer is known as the . It is used to store temporary files generated by the application during runtime. This filesystem includes logs, caches, and transient data that are not written to mounted volumes. This data exists only while the container is running and is deleted once the Pod or container stops. Note that this layer consumes part of the node’s ephemeral storage and excessive writes to the root filesystem can lead to disk pressure.</p><p>Kubernetes allows you to manage ephemeral storage usage through <strong>resource requests and limits</strong>. These settings define how much temporary storage a Pod can use and prevents a single Pod from consuming too much disk space on a&nbsp;node.</p><pre>resources:  requests:<p>    ephemeral-storage: \"500Mi\"</p>  limits:</pre><p>This configuration ensures that the Pod has a guaranteed minimum amount of ephemeral storage (requests) while enforcing an upper boundary (limits). When the node detects that a Pod exceeds its storage limit or the node itself is running low on disk space, Kubernetes may trigger  to maintain cluster stability.</p><h4>Ephemeral Volume Lifecycle</h4><p>Ephemeral volumes follow the Pod’s lifecycle from creation to termination as&nbsp;below:</p><ul><li>When a Pod is created, the Kubernetes scheduler assigns it to a node that satisfies its resource requirements and ephemeral storage requests.</li><li><strong>Volume preparation by Kubelet: </strong>The Kubelet on the target node prepares all volumes defined in the Pod specification. For ephemeral volumes such as emptyDir, the Kubelet creates a directory on the node’s filesystem. For CSI or generic ephemeral volumes, the Kubelet interacts with the storage driver to provision the volume dynamically.</li><li>The containers within the Pod start and mount the prepared volumes. Pod can now write data to the Ephemeral volume.</li><li><strong>Pod execution and storage monitoring: </strong>The Kubelet continuously monitors ephemeral storage usage for each container and volume. If disk usage approaches node-defined thresholds then eviction policies gets triggered.</li><li><strong>Pod termination and cleanup: </strong>Once the Pod is deleted, the Kubelet unmounts and deletes the associated ephemeral volumes. For node-local volumes, the data is removed from the filesystem. For dynamically provisioned ephemeral volumes, Kubernetes automatically deletes the temporary PVCs and underlying storage&nbsp;objects.</li></ul><h4>PersistentVolumeClaim and Naming Convention</h4><p>Ephemeral volumes that rely on <strong>PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC) templates</strong> such as <strong>Generic Ephemeral Volumes</strong>, automatically generate temporary PVCs at Pod creation. Kubernetes assigns each ephemeral PVC a unique name derived from the Pod and volume names that follows the below&nbsp;format:</p><pre>&lt;pod-name&gt;-&lt;volume-name&gt;-&lt;unique-suffix&gt;</pre><p>For example, a Pod named test-app using a volume temp-store might have a PVC&nbsp;named:</p><pre>test-app-temp-store-pvc-abc12</pre><p>This naming convention ensures uniqueness across Pods and prevents conflicts between replicas.</p><h3>Local Ephemeral Storage Configuration</h3><p>Kubernetes provides several configuration options that determine how ephemeral storage is managed on each node. These configurations help ensure that temporary storage is used efficiently and that Pods do not interfere with system-level operations or each&nbsp;other.</p><p>Cluster administrators can define  at the namespace level using a ResourceQuota object. This setting limits the total amount of ephemeral storage that all Pods in a namespace can consume. It helps maintain cluster stability by reducing the likelihood of node-level storage exhaustion.</p><pre>apiVersion: v1kind: ResourceQuota  name: ephemeral-storage-quotaspec:    requests.ephemeral-storage: \"5Gi\"<p>    limits.ephemeral-storage: \"10Gi\"</p></pre><p>This configuration ensures that Pods in the app-namespace can collectively request up to 5 GiB and not exceed 10 GiB of ephemeral storage.</p><h4>Single vs Two Filesystems</h4><p>Kubernetes nodes can use one or two filesystems to manage local ephemeral storage. The difference lies in how storage for system processes and Pod data is isolated.</p><ul><li>The operating system, Kubelet and Pods share the same underlying disk. This setup can lead to competition between system and workload storage that make monitoring and troubleshooting more difficult.</li><li>odes separate the  (used by the OS and system components) from the  (generally /var/lib/kubelet). This separation improves performance, allows for clearer monitoring of Pod-level storage usage and reduces the risk of system instability caused by Pods consuming excessive space.</li></ul><h3>Use Cases of Ephemeral Storage</h3><p>Ephemeral storage is an essential part of many Kubernetes workloads that require <strong>high-speed and temporary data handling</strong>. It supports a variety of short-lived processes and intermediate workloads that benefit from local and fast-access storage. Following are some common use-cases:</p><ul><li><strong>CI/CD pipelines and build jobs: </strong>During application builds or automated testing, temporary files such as build artifacts, dependency caches, or test outputs can be stored in ephemeral volumes.</li><li><strong>Data preprocessing or temporary analytics tasks: </strong>Workloads that transform or analyze data often generate intermediate files that do not need to be stored permanently. Ephemeral storage allows these operations to run quickly using local disk or memory before sending the processed results to persistent storage.</li><li><strong>Caching or scratch space for short lived processes: </strong>Applications can use ephemeral volumes as scratch space for computations or as a cache layer to speed up operations without impacting persistent storage.</li><li><strong>Machine Learning Intermediate Data:</strong>Machine learning pipelines frequently produce temporary model checkpoints, transformed datasets, or preprocessed batches that are only required during training.</li></ul><h3>Best Practice for Ephemeral Storage</h3><p>Follow below best practices while configuring ephemeral storage in Kubernetes cluster to make most out of&nbsp;it.</p><ul><li><strong>Always requests and limits: </strong>Set requests and limits for ephemeral-storage in every Pod specification. This helps Kubernetes schedule Pods on nodes with sufficient space and prevents excessive disk consumption that could lead to eviction.</li><li>emptyDir.medium: MemoryMemory-backed ephemeral storage offers fast I/O performance but consumes RAM from the node. Use it only when memory usage is predictable and when you truly need ultra-fast temporary storage, such as for caching or buffering.</li><li><strong>Continuously monitor node-level storage metrics: </strong>Track storage utilization using monitoring tools such as Prometheus, Grafana, or CloudWatch. Keeping an eye on ephemeral storage usage helps prevent sudden node pressure or unplanned Pod evictions.</li><li><strong>Keep ephemeral and persistent data in separate paths: </strong>Avoid mixing temporary and permanent data in the same directory or volume. This separation ensures cleaner storage management and reduces the risk of accidental data&nbsp;loss.</li><li><strong>Use CSI or Generic Ephemeral Volumes for dynamic provisioning: </strong>When workloads need flexible or feature-rich temporary storage, useCSI Ephemeral Volumes or Generic Ephemeral Volumes. They offer better control, dynamic provisioning and integration with storage drivers while maintaining ephemeral behaviour.</li></ul><h3>Challenges of Ephemeral Storage</h3><p>While ephemeral storage provides flexibility and performance benefits, it also comes with certain limitations and management challenges that administrators and developers should be aware of. The following are some such challenges of Ephemeral Storage:</p><ul><li><strong>Difficult to track usage patterns over time: </strong>Since ephemeral data is deleted when Pods are terminated, it can be challenging to analyze long-term storage usage trends or identify workloads that frequently consume excessive temporary storage.</li><li><strong>Risk of Pod eviction when storage exceeds limits: </strong>If a Pod’s ephemeral storage usage grows beyond its defined limit or if the node runs out of local disk space, the Kubelet may evict Pods to free up resources.</li><li><strong>Disk space constraints on nodes in multi-tenant clusters: </strong>In shared or multi-tenant environments, multiple workloads may compete for the same node storage, leading to contention and potential performance issues if ephemeral storage is not properly monitored and&nbsp;limited.</li></ul><p>Ephemeral storage is one of the key building blocks that enables Kubernetes to handle short-lived, stateless and high-performance workloads efficiently. By understanding how ephemeral volumes such as emptyDir, configMap, secret and CSI types work, you can make better decisions about where and how to store temporary data in your Pods.

Among its many components, Kubernetes Services play a crucial role in connecting workloads and exposing applications reliably. Most engineers are familiar with common Kubernetes service types such as ClusterIP, NodePort, and LoadBalancer. However, there is another less commonly used but powerful variant of Kubernetes service known as the Headless&nbsp;Service.</p><p>Headless Service is particularly important for stateful applications, custom service discovery and direct pod-to-pod communication. This service offers more granular control over how traffic is routed within a&nbsp;cluster.</p><p>This Substack is reader-supported. To receive new posts and support my work, consider becoming a free or paid subscriber.</p><p>In this article, we’ll take a deep technical dive into what a Headless Service is, how it works under the hood, explore the DNS resolution process, and understand how it differs from other service types, with practical examples and real-world use cases that demonstrate its true potential.</p><h3>What is headless&nbsp;service?</h3><p>In Kubernetes, a Service acts as an abstraction layer that provides a single, stable network endpoint to access a group of pods (for example: pods managed by Deployment). Kubernetes assigns each Service a ClusterIP that functions as a virtual load balancer inside the cluster. This ensures that any incoming traffic to the Service is evenly distributed across all available pods.</p><p>However, in some cases, you might need more control on the traffic routing&nbsp;. For example, certain applications such as databases or distributed systems require direct communication between pods rather than going through a load balancer.</p><p>This is where a Headless Service shines and becomes useful. You can create a Headless Service by setting the following in your Service configuration:</p><p>With this configuration, Kubernetes does not assign ClusterIP. Instead, it updates the DNS records to return the IP addresses of the individual pods behind the Service. As a result, clients can resolve and connect to pods directly that enables fine-grained communication and discovery within the&nbsp;cluster.</p><h3>Working of Headless&nbsp;Service</h3><ul><li>When you create a Service with clusterIP: None, the API server registers it as a Headless Service. - This Service will be associated with StatefulSet/Deployment using selector.</li></ul><pre>apiVersion: v1kind: Service  name: my-headless-svc  clusterIP: None    app: my-app    - port: 80</pre><ul><li>The kube-controller-manager will automatically create the EndpointSlice resource that map the service to the individual pod IPs matching its label selector. - If pods are added, removed or their readiness changes, the kube-controller-manager updates the EndpointSlice dynamically.</li></ul><pre>apiVersion: discovery.k8s.io/v1kind: EndpointSlice  name: my-headless-svc-ghk85    kubernetes.io/service-name: myappports:    port: 80endpoints:      - 10.244.1.7      - 10.244.2.11      - 10.244.3.9</pre><ul><li>Kube-proxy does not create any iptables or IPVS rules for a Headless Service because it does not have a ClusterIP. - This configuration allows traffic to bypass load balancing or proxying and flow directly from the client to the individual pods.</li><li>CoreDNS detects that the Service is headless and returns multiple A records, one for each pod that matches the Service selector, instead of returning a single ClusterIP. This allows clients within the cluster to resolve the DNS name to all available pod IPs, enabling direct pod to pod communication without any load balancing by kube-proxy. - For example: nslookup to my-headless-svc.default.svc.cluster.local will return active pods IPs - 10.244.1.7, 10.244.2.11, 10.244.3.9</li></ul><h3>Use-cases of Headless&nbsp;Service</h3><p>Headless Services enable a variety of use-cases, following are some such use-cases:</p><ul><li>Headless Service is essential for StatefulSets, which are used to deploy stateful applications such as MongoDB, Cassandra, or Kafka. These applications require each pod to have a stable network identity to communicate reliably with other pods.- Kubernetes provides this stability using a combination of a Headless Service and a predictable DNS naming pattern. The Headless Service ensures that each pod gets its own DNS record instead of a single ClusterIP.<p>- Example of MongoDB StatefulSet with Headless&nbsp;Service:</p></li></ul><pre>apiVersion: apps/v1kind: StatefulSet  name: mongo  serviceName: \"mongo\"  selector:      app: mongo    metadata:        app: mongo      containers:          image: mongo:5            - containerPort: 27017            - name: mongo-data  volumeClaimTemplates:        name: mongo-data        accessModes: [\"ReadWriteMany\"]          requests:---kind: Service  name: mongo  clusterIP: None    - port: 27017    app: mongo</pre><p>- After deployment, each MongoDB pod of the StatefulSet gets a stable DNS&nbsp;name:</p><pre>mongo-0.mongo.default.svc.cluster.local  mongo-1.mongo.default.svc.cluster.local  <p>mongo-2.mongo.default.svc.cluster.local</p></pre><ul><li>Headless Services give applications the ability to implement client-side load balancing, instead of relying on Kubernetes to distribute traffic automatically. Applications such as gRPC clients or service meshes can make intelligent decisions about which pod to connect to based on custom logic or metrics.- When a client queries the DNS of a Headless Service, it receives the IP addresses of all pods that match the service selector. This allows the client to choose exactly which pod to send traffic to that gives more control over routing and improving flexibility in distributed systems.</li><li>With a Headless Service, applications can use DNS directly to discover backend pods instead of relying on kube-proxy or a ClusterIP. This provides the actual pod IPs that allows clients to communicate directly with each pod. - This approach is particularly useful for distributed databases, stateful applications, or microservices that have built-in service discovery logic.</li></ul><h3>Limitations of Headless&nbsp;Service</h3><p>While Headless Services provide powerful capabilities for direct pod-to-pod communication and service discovery, they are not suitable for every scenario. Following are some important limitations of Headless&nbsp;Service:</p><ul><li><strong>No automatic load balancing</strong>: Unlike ClusterIP or LoadBalancer Services, traffic is not distributed by Kubernetes. Users are responsible for implementing their own load balancing logic.</li><li>: When pods are restarted or rescheduled, IP addresses of pods may change that can be problematic for long-lived connections.</li><li><strong>Best suited for stateful workloads</strong>: Headless Services offer limited benefits for stateless applications where a standard ClusterIP or LoadBalancer Service is sufficient.</li><li><strong>External access requires extra setup</strong>: Additional configuration is required to reach pods from outside the cluster, such as setting up an ingress, NodePort, or other networking solutions.</li></ul><p>Kubernetes Headless Services are a subtle but powerful feature that provides direct DNS-based access to pods that bypasses the default kube-proxy load balancing. They form a cornerstone for stateful and distributed systems that enables stable pod identities, precise service discovery, and fine-grained control over communication.</p><p>Unlike standard Services, Headless Services trade abstraction for transparency that gives developers the ability to interact directly with pods. Whether you are building databases, message queues, or clustered applications, they offer the precision and control needed for advanced Kubernetes workloads.</p><p>If you find my work valuable and would like to support it, you are welcome to <a href=\"http://paypal.me/anishkumar14743\">sponsor</a>&nbsp;me.</p><img src=\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=98a45cca68e8\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" alt=\"\">","contentLength":7583,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Understanding the Role of customresourcedefinitions/status in Kubernetes CRDs","url":"https://blog.devops.dev/understanding-the-role-of-customresourcedefinitions-status-in-kubernetes-crds-4b06bee69652?source=rss----33f8b2d9a328---4","date":1769414735,"author":"Anish Kumar","guid":421396,"unread":true,"content":"<p>Kubernetes has become the foundation of modern cloud infrastructure, giving teams a powerful way to orchestrate containers and manage workloads at scale.

It happened during a recent Flux upgrade from version 2.6.4 to 2.7.0 and turned out to be a great learning&nbsp;moment.</p><pre>User \"AWS_SSO_Admin_Role\" cannot update resource \"customresourcedefinitions/status\" in API group \"apiextensions.k8s.io\"</pre><p>This permission often appears in discussions around Kubernetes RBAC, and it tends to confuse even seasoned engineers. So let’s dive deep to better understand this permission.</p><h3>What is customresourcedefinitions/status?</h3><p>Every Kubernetes resource, whether it’s a Pod, Deployment, or CRD, has  and&nbsp;:</p><ul><li>The spec defines the desired state of the resource (what you want Kubernetes to make happen to the resource).</li><li>The status reflects the actual state of the resource (what Kubernetes or controllers observe the state of the resource).</li></ul><p>For example, when you deploy a Pod, its spec describes what containers should run, and its status shows whether those containers are running, waiting, or&nbsp;failed.</p><p>Similarly, CRDs also have a status subresource that holds information about their current condition, version, and readiness. The /status subresource exists as a dedicated API endpoint that allows updates specifically to the status field of a CRD, without touching its specification.</p><p>The permission customresourcedefinitions/status refers to a user or service account’s ability to interact with this subresource. It essentially controls who can , , or  the status of CRDs within a&nbsp;cluster.</p><h3>Why does customresourcedefinitions/status permission exist?</h3><p>The reason for separating the  from the main resource  comes down to and.</p><p>In a typical Kubernetes setup, the spec is usually managed by administrators or CI/CD pipelines. The status, however, is managed by controllers or operators that continuously reconcile the desired state with the actual state of the&nbsp;system.</p><p>If both were handled together, it could open doors to unwanted or unsafe modifications. Imagine a controller trying to update a CRD’s observed state but accidentally modifying its schema or definition in the process. The /status subresource prevents that by giving Kubernetes a safe, scoped way to update just the status&nbsp;field.</p><p>To prevent accidental or unauthorised changes, Kubernetes exposes these through separate API subresources:</p><pre>spec: /apis/apiextensions.k8s.io/v1/customresourcedefinitions/&lt;crd-name&gt;status: /apis/apiextensions.k8s.io/v1/customresourcedefinitions/&lt;crd-name&gt;/status</pre><p>So, when the CRD’s&nbsp;.status field is patched or updated, the operation targets the  rather than the main CRD&nbsp;object.</p><h4>Example: A typical CRD structure</h4><pre>apiVersion: apiextensions.k8s.io/v1kind: CustomResourceDefinition  name: myresources.example.com  group: example.com    kind: MyResource  versions:      served: truestatus:    - type: Established    - type: NamesAccepted</pre><p>In the aforementioned example, the&nbsp;.status section reflects Kubernetes’ internal tracking of whether the CRD is established, served, and ready for&nbsp;use.</p><p>Therefore, the customresourcedefinitions/status permission allows specific roles such as controllers, admission webhooks, or automated processes to report back on CRD readiness and operational conditions without the risk of altering the CRD specification itself.</p><h3>When is the customresourcedefinitions/status permission required?</h3><p>The customresourcedefinitions/status permission is often required in situations where a ,  or  interacts directly with CRDs. This permission enables updates to the CRD’s status during the management or reconciliation of resources.</p><p>Following are some common scenarios where the customresourcedefinitions/status permission comes into&nbsp;play:</p><ul><li><strong>Custom Controller Development: </strong>When a custom Kubernetes controller or operator is developed to create or manage CRDs, it often needs to update the status field to reflect the resource’s health, version, or reconciliation progress. Without the customresourcedefinitions/status permission, the controller cannot update CRD statuses and may encounter  errors, as discussed in the introduction.</li><li><strong>Automated Upgrades or Migrations: </strong>When upgrading tools or frameworks that define CRDs such as Flux, Istio or Argo CD, background processes frequently patch CRD statuses to maintain compatibility or indicate the completion of migrations. Lack of this permission can disrupt these operations and cause upgrade failures.</li><li><strong>Monitoring and Observability: </strong>Some monitoring solutions rely on status updates from CRDs to track whether APIs, controllers or custom workloads are healthy. Without this permission, status updates won’t propagate, leading to outdated or inaccurate monitoring data.</li><li><strong>Admission Controllers and Validation Webhooks: </strong>In more advanced setups, validating or mutating webhooks may also interact with CRD statuses as part of enforcing policies or performing validation checks. These processes need explicit access to /status endpoints.</li></ul><h3>Granting the customresourcedefinitions/status Permission</h3><p>Access to the CRD status subresource can be granted to a user or service account by including the permission in a ClusterRole or Role definition as shown&nbsp;below:</p><pre>apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1kind: ClusterRole  name: crd-status  - apiGroups: [\"apiextensions.k8s.io\"]<p>    resources: [\"customresourcedefinitions/status\"]</p>    verbs: [\"get\", \"update\", \"patch\"]</pre><p>Next, associate the role with the relevant service account or user using a ClusterRoleBinding or RoleBinding:</p><pre>apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1kind: RoleBinding  name: crd-status  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io  name: crd-status  - kind: ServiceAccount    namespace: default</pre><p>This configuration ensures that the  can modify CRD statuses within the  without granting broader permissions on the CRD definitions themselves.</p><p>The customresourcedefinitions/status permission may seem like a minor detail, but it plays a crucial role in Kubernetes security and operational reliability. It ensures a clear separation between the declarative configuration defined in the spec and the observed runtime state recorded in the&nbsp;status.</p><p>This separation allows Kubernetes to maintain consistency, prevent unauthorized changes to CRD specifications, and enable controllers to safely update system conditions. It also ensures that only trusted controllers can modify runtime states, keeping automation predictable and&nbsp;secure.</p><p>When a  error appears for this permission, it is not a failure but rather Kubernetes enforcing the principle of least privilege. Ensuring that automation components and controllers have the appropriate status access keeps the cluster functioning smoothly, securely, and as intended.</p><p>If you find my work valuable and would like to support it, you are welcome to <a href=\"http://paypal.me/anishkumar14743\">sponsor</a>&nbsp;me.</p><img src=\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=4b06bee69652\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" alt=\"\">","contentLength":7459,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"How Git Stores Files Internally to Saves Space in Your Repository","url":"https://blog.devops.dev/how-git-stores-files-internally-to-saves-space-in-your-repository-61c5f9e25d6a?source=rss----33f8b2d9a328---4","date":1769414731,"author":"bhagirath00","guid":421395,"unread":true,"content":"<blockquote>Learn how Git stores files internally using snapshots, blobs, trees, and hashing to avoid duplication and save repository space efficiently.</blockquote><p>Git is the most widely used version control system in the world, and one of the key reasons for its popularity is its <strong>highly efficient storage model</strong>. At first glance, Git appears to store a complete copy of your project every time you commit. Surprisingly, repositories remain compact even after thousands of&nbsp;commits.</p><p>So how does Git duplicate files while still saving disk&nbsp;space?</p><p>In this article, we will explore <strong>how Git stores files internally</strong>, how it <strong>avoids unnecessary duplication</strong>, and why its storage mechanism is both . By the end, you will clearly understand how Git manages file data under the hood and why it scales so well for large projects.</p><h3>Overview: How Git Stores Data Efficiently</h3><p>Unlike traditional version control systems such as Subversion (SVN), which store between versions, Git takes a fundamentally different approach.</p><p>Git stores <strong>snapshots of the entire project state</strong> at every&nbsp;commit.</p><p>However, Git is smart enough <strong>not to duplicate unchanged data</strong>. If a file has not changed between commits, Git simply <strong>reuses the previously stored version</strong> instead of saving a new copy. This design enables Git to&nbsp;deliver:</p><ul><li>Faster operations (branching, merging, checkout)</li><li>Strong data integrity and reliability</li></ul><h3>1. How Git Stores Data Using Snapshots Instead of File Differences</h3><p>Most version control systems track  over time. Git does&nbsp;not.</p><p>Every time you create a commit, Git records a <strong>snapshot of the entire file structure</strong> at that&nbsp;moment.</p><h3>What Happens When Files Don’t&nbsp;Change?</h3><p>If a file remains unchanged between&nbsp;commits:</p><ul><li>Git does  store the file&nbsp;again</li><li>Git simply creates a reference to the existing stored&nbsp;content</li></ul><p>This means Git behaves like a <strong>content-addressable filesystem</strong>, where identical content is stored once and referenced many&nbsp;times.</p><p>This snapshot model allows Git&nbsp;to:</p><ul><li>Instantly switch between&nbsp;branches</li><li>Avoid recalculating diffs repeatedly</li></ul><h3>2. Git Object Model: How Files Are Stored Internally</h3><p>Git stores all repository data as  inside the&nbsp;.git/objects directory. Each object is identified by a  based on its&nbsp;content.</p><p>There are four primary object types in&nbsp;Git:</p><ul><li> — Directory structure</li><li> — A snapshot with&nbsp;metadata</li><li> — Named references to&nbsp;commits</li></ul><h3>2.1 Blob Objects: File Content&nbsp;Storage</h3><p>A <strong>blob (Binary Large Object)</strong> represents the .</p><p>Key characteristics of&nbsp;blobs:</p><ul><li>Store file data only (no filename or permissions)</li><li>Identical file contents result in </li><li>Stored only once, regardless of how many commits reference them</li></ul><h3>Why Blobs Enable De-duplication</h3><p>If two files — or the same file across commits — have identical content:</p><ul><li>Multiple commits point to the same&nbsp;blob</li></ul><p>This is the foundation of Git’s space-saving mechanism.</p><p>You can inspect blobs&nbsp;using:</p><pre>git ls-tree &lt;commit-hash&gt;</pre><h3>2.2 Tree Objects: Directory Structures</h3><p>A  represents a directory in your&nbsp;project.</p><ul><li>References to blob&nbsp;objects</li><li>References to other tree objects (subdirectories)</li></ul><p>Each directory in your project maps to a tree object, allowing Git to recreate the complete filesystem structure for any&nbsp;commit.</p><h3>2.3 Commit Objects: Snapshots in&nbsp;Time</h3><p>A  ties everything together.</p><ul><li>A reference to the root&nbsp;tree</li><li>Author and committer information</li></ul><pre>Commit└── Tree (Root Directory)    ├── Blob (File 2)        ├── Blob (File 3)</pre><p>Each commit represents a , but most data is reused from earlier&nbsp;commits.</p><h3>3. Inside the&nbsp;.git Directory: Git’s Internal Storage and Control&nbsp;System</h3><p>The&nbsp;.git directory is the <strong>core of every Git repository</strong>. It stores all metadata, objects, and references.</p><p>This directory stores all Git objects (blobs, trees, commits) in compressed form. Objects are named using their hash&nbsp;values.</p><p>References to branches and tags live here. Each branch is simply a pointer to a&nbsp;commit.</p><h3>3.3&nbsp;.git/index (Staging&nbsp;Area)</h3><p>The index tracks what will be included in the next commit. It bridges the gap between your working directory and the repository.</p><p>The HEAD file points to the currently checked-out branch or&nbsp;commit.</p><h3>4. How Git Uses Hashing, Compression, and De-duplication to Save&nbsp;Space</h3><p>Git’s efficiency comes from three core techniques.</p><h3>4.1 Content-Addressable Hashing</h3><p>Git computes a hash (SHA-1 by default, SHA-256 supported) for every object based on its&nbsp;content.</p><ul><li>Different content → different hash</li></ul><p>This guarantees data integrity and prevents duplication.</p><p>Git compresses objects using , reducing disk usage while maintaining fast&nbsp;access.</p><h3>4.3 Automatic De-duplication</h3><p>Git never stores the same content twice. If a file hasn’t&nbsp;changed:</p><ul><li>Existing blobs are&nbsp;reused</li></ul><p>This is how Git <strong>duplicates files logically without duplicating data physically</strong>.</p><h3>5. From Working Directory to Commits: How Git Builds and Stores Snapshots</h3><p>To fully understand how Git duplicates files while saving space, it is essential to understand the  through which every change flows: the , the , and the . These are not just conceptual layers — they directly influence how Git creates objects and reuses existing&nbsp;data.</p><p>The  is the actual project folder on your local machine. It contains real files that you edit using your editor or&nbsp;IDE.</p><ul><li>Files here exist  of Git’s object&nbsp;database</li><li>Changes are not tracked automatically</li><li>Git does not store anything permanently at this&nbsp;stage</li></ul><p>When you modify a file in the working directory:</p><ul><li>No new blob is created&nbsp;yet</li><li>No disk space inside&nbsp;.git/objects is&nbsp;used</li></ul><p>This design allows Git to remain fast and lightweight while you experiment with&nbsp;changes.</p><p>The , also called the , is where Git begins its internal storage optimization.</p><p>Git performs the following actions:</p><ul><li>Reads the file content from the working directory</li><li>Computes a hash based on the&nbsp;content</li><li>Checks whether an identical blob already&nbsp;exists</li><li>Reuses the existing blob or creates a new one if&nbsp;needed</li><li>Records the blob reference in&nbsp;.git/index</li></ul><ul><li>The staging area stores , not&nbsp;copies</li><li>Unchanged files reuse existing blob&nbsp;objects</li><li>Partial staging is supported, allowing fine-grained commits</li></ul><p>This is where Git’s  begins to take&nbsp;effect.</p><p>Git creates a , which includes:</p><ul><li>A reference to a tree&nbsp;object</li><li>Metadata (author, timestamp, message)</li><li>A reference to the parent&nbsp;commit</li></ul><ul><li>Git does  duplicate file&nbsp;content</li><li>The new tree references existing blobs whenever&nbsp;possible</li><li>Only changed files produce new&nbsp;blobs</li></ul><p>Each commit represents a , but internally, most data is shared across commits. This allows Git to maintain a full project history without ballooning repository size.</p><h3>6. Exploring Git’s Internals Using Low-Level Git&nbsp;Commands</h3><p>One of Git’s strengths is transparency. Git provides low-level commands that allow you to <strong>inspect its internal object database</strong>, making it easier to understand how files are stored and&nbsp;reused.</p><p>These commands are especially valuable for developers who want to understand Git beyond everyday workflows.</p><h3>6.1 git cat-file: Viewing Raw Git&nbsp;Objects</h3><p>The git cat-file command allows you to inspect any Git object directly.</p><pre>git cat-file -p &lt;object-hash&gt;</pre><ul><li>Author and committer details</li></ul><p>You can also inspect blob objects to see file content exactly as Git stores it, confirming that identical content is reused across&nbsp;commits.</p><h3>6.2 git ls-tree: Exploring Tree Structures</h3><p>The git ls-tree command shows how a commit or tree maps to files and directories.</p><pre>git ls-tree &lt;commit-hash&gt;</pre><ul><li>Object type (blob or&nbsp;tree)</li></ul><p>This command clearly demonstrates how Git builds directory snapshots using <strong>tree objects that reference blob objects</strong>, without duplicating data.</p><h3>6.3 git rev-parse: Resolving References to&nbsp;Hashes</h3><p>The git rev-parse command helps resolve symbolic references into their actual object&nbsp;hashes.</p><ul><li>Verifying which commit a branch points&nbsp;to</li><li>Debugging detached HEAD&nbsp;states</li><li>Understanding reference resolution</li></ul><p>This reinforces the idea that <strong>branches and tags are lightweight pointers</strong>, not copies of&nbsp;data.</p><h3>Conclusion: Why Git’s Storage Model Is So&nbsp;Powerful</h3><p>Git’s ability to duplicate files logically without duplicating data physically is the cornerstone of its performance and scalability. By storing content as immutable, hashed objects and reusing them across commits, Git ensures that repositories remain fast and space-efficient — even with extensive histories.</p><ul><li>Git stores , not file&nbsp;diffs</li><li>Identical file content is stored </li><li>Blobs, trees, and commits form Git’s object&nbsp;model</li><li>The&nbsp;.git directory contains all internal&nbsp;data</li><li>Hashing and compression ensure integrity and efficiency</li></ul><p>Understanding Git’s internal storage model gives you deeper confidence when working with branches, rebases, merges, and large repositories. It also explains why Git continues to outperform traditional version control systems in both speed and reliability.</p><img src=\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=61c5f9e25d6a\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" alt=\"\">","contentLength":8596,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"End-to-End CI/CD Pipeline Using Jenkins and Kubernetes","url":"https://blog.devops.dev/end-to-end-ci-cd-pipeline-using-jenkins-and-kubernetes-99be6542a07f?source=rss----33f8b2d9a328---4","date":1769414722,"author":"bhagirath00","guid":421394,"unread":true,"content":"<blockquote>Building Scalable, Cloud-Native CI/CD Pipelines with Jenkins and Kubernetes</blockquote><p>In modern , running on static or long-lived build agents often leads to scalability issues, inefficient resource usage, and maintenance overhead.

Why Integrate Jenkins with Kubernetes for&nbsp;CI/CD?</h3><p> provides a robust and scalable platform for running containerized applications, and Jenkins is a powerful tool for automating the. When integrated, these two tools can provide significant benefits:</p><ul><li><strong>Dynamic Agent Provisioning</strong>:  dynamically creates  as build agents for each . Agents are provisioned only when needed and automatically destroyed after job completion, eliminating idle infrastructure.</li><li>: scales  agents based on workload demand. Multiplecan run in parallel, allowing for faster builds and testing&nbsp;cycles.</li><li>: Each Jenkins job runs inside its own Kubernetes ensuring clean, reproducible, and conflict-free build environments across pipelines.</li><li>: Applications can be built, containerized, and deployed directly to Kubernetesenabling seamless end-to-end CI/CD workflows in cloud-native environments.</li><li>: Because agents are short-lived and container-based, system resources are consumed only during active pipeline execution, significantly reducing infrastructure costs.</li></ul><h3>2. Prerequisites for Jenkins and Kubernetes CI/CD Integration</h3><p>Before integrating Jenkins with Kubernetes, ensure you have the following prerequisites in place. These prerequisites form the foundation for a stable and production-ready CI/CD&nbsp;setup.</p><ul><li>: A running Kubernetes cluster is required to host Jenkins agents and deploy applications. This can be a managed Kubernetes service such as<strong> Amazon EKS, Google GKE, Azure AKS</strong>, or a self-managed on-premise</li><li>: Jenkins must be installed and accessible. It can run: — inside a Kubernetes cluster (recommended for cloud-native setups) or on a standalone virtual machine or&nbsp;server.</li><li><strong>Kubernetes Plugin for Jenkins</strong>: The Kubernetes enables Jenkins to dynamically provision Kubernetes pods as build agents. This plugin is essential for running CI/CD pipelines using Kubernetes-based agents.</li><li><strong>Cluster Access and Permissions</strong>: Jenkins must have <strong>permission to communicate </strong>with the server. This is typically achieved using a Kubernetes Service Account with the required RBAC&nbsp;roles.</li><li>: The kubectl CLI tool is useful for: — managing Kubernetes resources — debugging deployments — running deployment steps inside </li></ul><h3>3. Jenkins Kubernetes Integration Architecture</h3><p>Jenkins integrates with Kubernetes using the , which allows Jenkins to run CI/CD jobs inside Kubernetes pods instead of on static build&nbsp;agents.</p><p>In this setup, Jenkins focuses on <strong>orchestrating the pipeline</strong>, while Kubernetes handles <strong>executing jobs and managing resources</strong>. Whenever a pipeline starts, Jenkins asks Kubernetes to spin up a temporary pod to run the job. Once the job finishes, the pod is automatically removed.</p><p>This makes the entire CI/CD system dynamic, scalable, and cloud-native.</p><h3>How Jenkins and Kubernetes Work Together:</h3><ol><li>: Jenkins controller manages pipelines, jobs, and credentials.

CI/CD Pipeline Architecture with Jenkins and Kubernetes</h3><p>This CI/CD architecture uses Jenkins as the pipeline orchestrator and Kubernetes as the execution and deployment platform.

Kubernetes Agent Pods (Dynamic Build&nbsp;Agents)</h3><p>Using the Jenkins Kubernetes Plugin, Jenkins dynamically spins up  inside the Kubernetes cluster. Each pipeline run gets its own isolated pod, which is destroyed after completion.</p><ul><li>No long-running or idle&nbsp;agents</li><li>Clean environment for every&nbsp;build</li><li>Parallel pipelines without conflicts</li><li>Automatic scaling based on&nbsp;workload</li></ul><p>Each agent pod can include multiple containers (for example: Maven, Docker CLI, kubectl ), allowing different stages to run in the right environment.</p><h3>4.4. Docker Image Build &amp;&nbsp;Push</h3><p>Inside the Kubernetes agent pod, Jenkins builds the application and creates a Docker image using the project’s Dockerfile.The image is then pushed to a container registry such as <strong>Docker Hub, Amazon ECR, or&nbsp;GCR</strong>.</p><ul><li>Application is compiled and&nbsp;tested</li><li>Docker image is built inside the agent&nbsp;pod</li><li>Image is tagged with version or commit&nbsp;hash</li><li>Image is pushed to a container registry</li></ul><p>This ensures the same image is used across all environments.</p><h3>4.5. Kubernetes Deployment</h3><p>Once the Docker image is available in the registry, Jenkins deploys the application to Kubernetes using kubectl or&nbsp;Helm.</p><ul><li>Jenkins applies Kubernetes manifests or Helm&nbsp;charts</li><li>Kubernetes pulls the image from the&nbsp;registry</li><li>Pods are created or updated using rolling deployments</li><li>Application becomes available via Service or&nbsp;Ingress</li></ul><p>This completes the  from code commit to a running application in Kubernetes.</p><h3>5. How to Install and Run Jenkins on Kubernetes</h3><p>Getting Jenkinsfileup and running on Kubernetes is easier than you might think, especially with , the package manager for Kubernetes. Helm simplifies complex deployments and ensures you can get a production-ready Jenkins instance&nbsp;quickly.</p><h3>5.1 Installing Jenkins with&nbsp;Helm</h3><p>The easiest way to install Jenkins on Kubernetes is using&nbsp;Helm.</p><h4>Step 1: Create a Namespace for&nbsp;Jenkins</h4><p>It’s a good practice to isolate Jenkins in its own namespace:</p><pre>kubectl create namespace jenkins</pre><p>Helm is a package manager for Kubernetes that simplifies the installation of complex applications like Jenkins. To install Jenkins using&nbsp;Helm:</p><pre>helm repo add jenkins https://charts.jenkins.iohelm repo update<p>helm install jenkins jenkins/jenkins --namespace jenkins</p></pre><p>Once installed, you can access Jenkins via the Kubernetes service. To get the admin password:</p><pre>kubectl get svc --namespace jenkins</pre><pre>kubectl exec --namespace jenkins -it $(kubectl get pods --namespace jenkins -l \"app.kubernetes.io/component=jenkins-master\" -o jsonpath=\"{.items[0].metadata.name}\") -- cat /run/secrets/chart-admin-password</pre><p>Open Jenkins in your browser using the service IP and port, then log in using the retrieved admin password.</p><h3>5.2 Configuring the&nbsp;Cloud</h3><p>Once Jenkins is installed, configure it to use Kubernetes for dynamic agent provisioning:</p><ol><li><strong>Install the Kubernetes Plugin</strong>: Go to  &gt;  and install the . This plugin allows Jenkins to communicate with your cluster and provision agents on-demand.</li><li><strong>Configure Kubernetes Cloud</strong>:</li></ol><ul><li>Navigate to  &gt; .</li><li>Scroll down to  and click  &gt; .</li><li>Provide the , , and configure the <strong>Kubernetes Service Account</strong> so Jenkins can manage&nbsp;pods.</li></ul><p>: Pod templates define what containers are included in each Jenkins agent pod. You can create different templates for different types of jobs, for&nbsp;example:</p><ul></ul><h3>6. Jenkinsfile-Based CI/CD Pipeline Implementation</h3><p>With Jenkins configured to use Kubernetes, the next step is to set up CI/CD pipelines that build and deploy applications to Kubernetes.</p><p>A e allows you to describe your entire pipeline <em>— build, test, and deployment </em>as code, making it version-controlled, repeatable, and easy to maintain.</p><h3>6.1 Configuring Jenkins Pipeline for Kubernetes</h3><p>A defines <strong>what steps your pipeline runs</strong> and .When using Kubernetes integration, Jenkins dynamically creates a  for each pipeline execution.</p><p>Here’s an example of a  that uses Kubernetes agents and deploys an application to a Kubernetes cluster:</p><pre>pipeline {    agent {            label 'my-k8s-agent'            yaml '''            kind: Pod              containers:                image: maven:3.9.6-eclipse-temurin-17                - cat              - name: kubectl<p>                image: bitnami/kubectl:latest</p>                command:                tty: true        }    stages {            steps {                    sh 'mvn clean install'            }        stage('Test') {                container('maven') {                }        }<p>        stage('Deploy to Kubernetes') {</p>            steps {                    sh 'kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml'            }    }</pre><ul><li>Jenkins creates a  for this pipeline&nbsp;run</li><li>The pod includes multiple containers (Maven for build/test, for deployment)</li><li>Each stage runs in the most appropriate container</li><li>After the pipeline finishes, the pod is automatically destroyed</li></ul><p>This approach keeps builds <strong>clean, isolated, and scalable</strong>.</p><h3>6.2 Automating Deployments to Kubernetes</h3><p>In the pipeline above, the  stage uses kubectl to apply Kubernetes manifests.These YAML files typically define resources such&nbsp;as:</p><ul></ul><p>Because deployment happens only after successful build and test stages, Jenkins ensures that  reach your Kubernetes cluster.</p><p>This automation removes manual deployment steps and enables fast, consistent releases.</p><h3>6.3 Deploying Applications with&nbsp;Helm</h3><p>While kubectl apply works well, managing multiple YAML files can become difficult as applications grow.This is where  becomes extremely useful.</p><ul><li>Package Kubernetes resources into reusable&nbsp;charts</li><li>Easily upgrade or roll back&nbsp;releases</li></ul><p>Here’s a simpleexample that deploys an application using&nbsp;Helm:</p><pre>pipeline {    agent any        stage('Build') {                sh 'mvn clean install'        }<p>        stage('Deploy to Kubernetes with Helm') {</p>            steps {<p>                sh 'helm upgrade --install myapp ./helm-chart/'</p>            }    }</pre><ul><li>Application configuration becomes&nbsp;cleaner</li><li>Environment-specific values are easier to&nbsp;manage</li><li>Production deployments are more predictable</li></ul><h3>7. Best Practices for Jenkins Kubernetes CI/CD Pipelines</h3><p>To get the most out of Jenkins and Kubernetes, it’s important to follow a few proven best practices. These help keep your pipelines scalable, secure, and easy to maintain as workloads grow.</p><ul><li>: Define reusable pod templates for different job types to avoid duplication.</li><li><strong>Run Each Job in an Isolated Pod</strong>: Each Jenkins job should run in an isolated pod to ensure that builds are clean and independent.</li><li>: Enable auto-scaling in Kubernetes to dynamically adjust the number of nodes based on Jenkins job&nbsp;demand.</li><li>: Use Kubernetes secrets to securely manage credentials and sensitive information.</li><li>: Package your application as a Helm chart to simplify deployment and versioning.</li></ul><h3>8. Monitoring and Scaling Jenkins CI/CD Pipelines on Kubernetes</h3><p>As CI/CD pipelines grow in complexity and usage, monitoring and scaling become critical to maintaining performance and reliability. Kubernetes makes this much easier by providing built-in scalability and strong observability integrations.</p><ul><li>: The Jenkins dashboard gives a quick, high-level view of pipeline executions, build history, and agent activity. It’s useful for tracking failed jobs, build durations, and overall pipeline&nbsp;health.</li><li>For deeper visibility, Jenkins can be integrated with Prometheus and Grafana. This allows teams to monitor: — Resource usage of Jenkins controllers and agents — Build and job execution metrics — Pod and node performance inside the Kubernetes cluster — Grafana dashboards make it easy to visualize trends, detect bottlenecks, and proactively address performance issues before they impact deployments.</li></ul><h3>Scaling Jenkins with Kubernetes</h3><p>Kubernetes enables Jenkins to scale automatically based on workload demand. Jenkins agents can be created or destroyed as pods, allowing the CI/CD system to handle sudden spikes in build traffic without manual intervention.</p><p>By combining Kubernetes auto-scaling with proper monitoring, teams can ensure&nbsp;that:</p><ul><li>Builds remain fast during peak&nbsp;usage</li><li>Infrastructure costs stay optimized</li><li> remain reliable and resilient</li></ul><p>Integratingcreates a modern, cloud-native CI/CD platform that is scalable, efficient, and production-ready. By running Jenkins agents as Kubernetes pods, teams can dynamically provision build environments, optimize resource usage, and eliminate the limitations of static build&nbsp;agents.</p><p>Kubernetes features such as pod isolation, auto-scaling, and Helm-based deployments allow Jenkins pipelines to remain clean, reliable, and easy to manage as applications grow. This integration enables seamless automation — from code commits and builds to testing and deployment directly into Kubernetes clusters.</p><p>By combining , you can build CI/CD pipelines that are faster, more resilient, and ready for real-world production workloads — making continuous delivery a natural part of your </p><img src=\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=99be6542a07f\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" alt=\"\">","contentLength":14001,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Your Paper is a Blockbuster.

This brings us to the most common question engineers ask during a DHI trial: <em>what if I need a custom image?</em></p><p>Hardened images are minimal by design. They lack package managers (apt, apk, yum), utilities (wget, curl), and even shells like bash or sh. This is a security feature: if a bad actor breaks into your container, they find an empty toolbox.</p><p>However, developers often need these tools during setup. You might need to install a monitoring agent, a custom CA certificate, or a specific library.</p><p>In this final part of our series, we will cover the two strategies for customizing DHI: the Docker Hub UI (for platform teams creating “Golden Images”) and the multi-stage build pattern (for developers building applications).</p><h3>Option 1: The Golden Image (Docker Hub UI)</h3><p>If you are a Platform or DevOps Engineer, your goal is likely to provide a “blessed” base image for your internal teams. For example, you might want a standard Node.js image that  includes your corporate root CA certificate and your security logging agent.The <a href=\"https://docs.docker.com/dhi/how-to/customize/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Docker Hub UI</a> is the preferred path for this. The strongest argument for using the Hub UI is maintenance automation.</p><h3>The Killer Feature: Automatic Rebuilds</h3><p>When you customize an image via the UI, Docker understands the relationship between your custom layers and the hardened base. If Docker releases a patch for the underlying DHI base image (e.g., a fix in glibc or openssl), Docker Hub automatically rebuilds your custom image.</p><p>You don’t need to trigger a CI pipeline. You don’t need to monitor CVE feeds. The platform handles the patching and rebuilding, ensuring your “Golden Image” is always compliant with the latest security standards.</p><p>Since you have an Organization setup for this trial, you can explore this directly in Docker Hub.First, navigate to  in your organization dashboard. Locate the image you want to customize (e.g., dhi-node), then the Customizations tab and click the “Create customization” action. This initiates a customization workflow as follows:</p><p>In the “Add packages” section, you can search for and select OS packages directly from the distribution’s repository. For example, here we are adding bash to the image for debugging purposes. You can also add “OCI Artifacts” to inject custom files like certificates or agents.</p><p>Finally, configure the runtime settings (User, Environment Variables) and review your build. Docker Hub will verify the configuration and queue the build. Once complete, this image will be available in your organization’s private registry and will automatically rebuild whenever the base DHI image is updated.</p><p>This option is best suited for creating standardized “golden” base images that are used across the entire organization. The primary advantage is <strong>zero-maintenance security patching</strong> due to automatic rebuilds by Docker Hub. However, it is less flexible for rapid, application-specific iteration by individual development teams.</p><h2>Option 2: Multi-Stage Build</h2><p>If you are an developper, you likely define your environment in a Dockerfile that lives alongside your code. You need flexibility, and you need it to work locally on your machine.</p><p>Since DHI images don’t have apt-get or curl, you cannot simply RUN apt-get install my-lib in your Dockerfile. It will fail.</p><p>Instead, we use the multi-stage build pattern. The concept is simple:</p><ol><li>Stage 1 (Builder): Use a standard “fat” image (like debian:bookworm-slim) to download, compile, and prepare your dependencies.</li><li>Stage 2 (Runtime): Copy  the resulting artifacts into the pristine DHI base.</li></ol><p>This keeps your final image minimal, non-root, and secure, while still allowing you to install whatever you need.</p><h3>Hands-on Tutorial: Adding a Monitoring Agent</h3><p>Let’s try this locally. We will simulate a common real-world scenario: adding the Datadog APM library (dd-trace) globally to a Node.js DHI image.</p><p>Create a new directory for this test and add a simple server.js file. This script attempts to load the dd-trace library to verify our installation.</p><div><pre>// Simple Express server to demonstrate DHI customization\nconsole.log('Node.js version:', process.version);\ntry {\n  require('dd-trace');\n  console.log('dd-trace module loaded successfully!');\n} catch (e) {\n  console.error('Failed to load dd-trace:', e.message);\n  process.exit(1);\n}\nconsole.log('Running as UID:', process.getuid(), 'GID:', process.getgid());\nconsole.log('DHI customization test successful!');\n\n</pre></div><p>Now, create the Dockerfile. We will use a standard Debian image to install the library, and then copy it to our DHI Node.js image. Create a new directory for this test and add a simple server.js file. This script attempts to load the dd-trace library to verify our installation.</p><div><pre># Stage 1: Builder - a standard Debian Slim image that has apt, curl, and full shell access.\nFROM debian:bookworm-slim AS builder\n\n\n# Install Node.js (matching our target version) and tools\nRUN apt-get update &amp;amp;&amp;amp; \\\n    apt-get install -y curl &amp;amp;&amp;amp; \\\n    curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_24.x | bash - &amp;amp;&amp;amp; \\\n    apt-get install -y nodejs\n\n\n# Install Datadog APM agent globally (we force the install prefix to /usr/local so we know exactly where files go)\nRUN npm config set prefix /usr/local &amp;amp;&amp;amp; \\\n    npm install -g dd-trace@5.0.0\n\n\n# Stage 2: Runtime - we switch to the Docker Hardened Image.\nFROM &amp;lt;your-org-namespace&amp;gt;/dhi-node:24.11-debian13-fips\n\n\n# Copy only the required library from the builder stage\nCOPY --from=builder /usr/local/lib/node_modules/dd-trace /usr/local/lib/node_modules/dd-trace\n\n\n# Environment Configuration\n# DHI images are strict.

If successful, the container should start, find the library, and exit cleanly.</p><div><pre>docker run --rm dhi-monitoring-test\n</pre></div><div><pre>Node.js version: v24.11.0\ndd-trace module loaded successfully!\nRunning as UID: 1000 GID: 1000\nDHI customization test successful!\n\n</pre></div><p>Success! We have a working application with a custom global library, running on a hardened, non-root base.</p><p>We successfully customized the image. But did we compromise its security?</p><p>This is the most critical lesson of operationalizing DHI: hardened base images protect the OS, but they do not protect you from the code you add.Let’s verify our new image with <a href=\"https://docs.docker.com/scout/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Docker Scout</a>.</p><div><pre>docker scout cves dhi-monitoring-test --only-severity critical,high\n</pre></div><div><pre>    ✗ Detected 1 vulnerable package with 1 vulnerability\n...\n   0C     1H     0M     0L  lodash.pick 4.4.0           \npkg:npm/lodash.pick@4.4.0                               \n                                                        \n    ✗ HIGH CVE-2020-8203 [Improperly Controlled Modification of Object Prototype Attributes]\n\n</pre></div><p>This result is accurate and important. The base image (OS, OpenSSL, Node.js runtime) is still secure. However, the dd-trace library we just installed pulled in a dependency (lodash.pick) that contains a High severity vulnerability.</p><p>This proves that your verification pipeline works.</p><p>If we hadn’t scanned the  image, we might have assumed we were safe because we used a “Hardened Image.” By using Docker Scout on the final artifact, we caught a supply chain vulnerability introduced by  customization.</p><p>Let’s check how much “bloat” we added compared to the clean base.</p><div><pre>docker scout compare --to &amp;lt;your-org-namespace&amp;gt;/dhi-node:24.11-debian13-fips dhi-monitoring-test\n\n</pre></div><p>You will see that the only added size corresponds to the dd-trace library (~5MB) and our application code. We didn’t accidentally inherit apt, curl, or the build caches from the builder stage. The attack surface remains minimized.</p><h2>A Note on Provenance: Who Signs What?</h2><p>In Part 2, we verified the SLSA Provenance and cryptographic signatures of Docker Hardened Images. This is crucial for establishing a trusted supply chain. When you customize an image, the question of who “owns” the signature becomes important.</p><ol><li><strong>Docker Hub UI Customization</strong>: When you customize an image through the Docker Hub UI, Docker itself acts as the builder for your custom image. This means the resulting customized image inherits signed provenance and attestations directly from Docker’s build infrastructure. If the base DHI receives a security patch, Docker automatically rebuilds and re-signs your custom image, ensuring continuous trust. This is a significant advantage for platform teams creating “golden images.”</li></ol><ol start=\"2\"><li>: When you build a custom image using a multi-stage Dockerfile locally (as we did in our tutorial),  are the builder. Your docker build command produces a  image with a  digest. Consequently, the original DHI signature from Docker does not apply to your final custom image (because the bits have changed and you are the new builder).However, the chain of trust is not entirely broken:</li><ul><li>Base Layers: The underlying DHI layers within your custom image still retain their original Docker attestations.</li><li>Custom Layer: Your organization is now the “builder” of the new layers.</li></ul></ol><p>For production deployments using the multi-stage build, you should integrate <a href=\"https://docs.docker.com/dhi/how-to/verify/#verify-signatures-with-cosign\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Cosign</a> or <a href=\"https://docs.docker.com/engine/security/trust/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Docker Content Trust</a> into your CI/CD pipeline to sign your custom images. This closes the loop, allowing you to enforce policies like: <em>“Only run images built by MyOrg, which are based on verified DHI images and have our internal signature.”</em></p><h2>Measuring Your ROI: Questions for Your Team</h2><p>As you conclude your Docker Hardened Images trial, it’s critical to quantify the value for your organization. Reflect on the concrete results from your migration and customization efforts using these questions:</p><ul><li>: How significantly did DHI impact your CVE counts? Compare the “before and after” vulnerability reports for your migrated services. What is the estimated security risk reduction?</li><li> What was the actual engineering effort required to migrate an image to DHI? Consider the time saved on patching, vulnerability triage, and security reviews compared to managing traditional base images.</li><li>: How well does DHI integrate into your team’s existing development and CI/CD workflows? Do developers find the customization patterns (Golden Image / Builder Pattern) practical and efficient? Is your team likely to adopt this long-term?</li></ul><p>: Has DHI simplified your compliance reporting or audit processes due to its SLSA provenance and FIPS compliance? What is the impact on your regulatory burden?</p><p>Thanks for following through to the end! Over this 3-part blog series, you have moved from a simple trial to a fully operational workflow:</p><ol><li>: You replaced a standard base image with DHI and saw immediate vulnerability reduction.</li><li>: You independently validated signatures, FIPS compliance, and SBOMs.</li><li>: You learned to extend DHI using the Hub UI (for auto-patching) or multi-stage builds, while checking for new vulnerabilities introduced by your own dependencies.</li></ol><p>The lesson here is that the “Hardened” in Docker Hardened Images isn’t a magic shield but a clean foundation. By building on top of it, you ensure that your team spends time securing  application code, rather than fighting a never-ending battle against thousands of upstream vulnerabilities.</p>","contentLength":11446,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Dia Browser Keeps Sneaking into my Workflow in the Best Ways","url":"https://blog.devops.dev/dia-browser-keeps-sneaking-into-my-workflow-in-the-best-ways-23fa6dde49cc?source=rss----33f8b2d9a328---4","date":1769349415,"author":"Eduardo Barth","guid":420373,"unread":true,"content":"","contentLength":0,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Making the Most of Your Docker Hardened Images Enterprise Trial – Part 2","url":"https://www.docker.com/blog/making-the-most-of-your-docker-hardened-images-enterprise-trial-part-2/","date":1769286279,"author":"Aditya Tripathi","guid":420107,"unread":true,"content":"<h2>Verifying Security and Compliance of Docker Hardened Images</h2><p>In <a href=\"https://www.docker.com/blog/making-the-most-of-your-docker-hardened-images-trial-part-1/\">Part 1</a> of this series, we migrated a Node.js service to Docker Hardened Images (DHI) and measured impressive results: 100% vulnerability elimination, 90% package reduction, and 41.5% size decrease. We extracted the SBOM and saw compliance labels for FIPS, STIG, and CIS.</p><p>The numbers look compelling. But how do you  these claims independently?</p><p>Security tools earn trust through verification, not promises. When evaluating a security product for production, you need cryptographic proof. This is especially true for images that form the foundation of every container you deploy.This post walks through the verification process: signature validation, provenance analysis, compliance evidence examination, and SBOM analysis. We’ll focus on practical verification you can run during your trial, with links to the <a href=\"https://docs.docker.com/dhi/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">official DHI documentation</a> for deeper technical details. By the end, you’ll have independently confirmed DHI’s security posture and built confidence for a production scenario.</p><h2>Understanding Security Attestations available with Docker Hardened Images</h2><p>Before diving into verification, you need to understand what you’re verifying.</p><p>Docker Hardened Images include : cryptographically-signed metadata about the image’s build process, contents, and compliance posture. These are signed statements that can be independently verified.</p><div><table><tbody><tr><td></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>List all attestations for your hardened image:</p><div><pre>docker scout attestation list registry://&amp;lt;your-org-namespace&amp;gt;/dhi-node:24.11-debian13-fips\n</pre></div><p>This shows 16 different attestation types:</p><div><pre>https://slsa.dev/provenance/v0.2            SLSA provenance\nhttps://docker.com/dhi/fips/v0.1            FIPS compliance\nhttps://docker.com/dhi/stig/v0.1            STIG scan\nhttps://cyclonedx.org/bom/v1.6              CycloneDX SBOM\nhttps://spdx.dev/Document                   SPDX SBOM\nhttps://scout.docker.com/vulnerabilities    Scout vulnerabilities\nhttps://scout.docker.com/secrets/v0.1       Scout secret scan\nhttps://scout.docker.com/virus/v0.1         Scout virus/malware\nhttps://scout.docker.com/tests/v0.1         Scout test report\nhttps://openvex.dev/ns/v0.2.0               OpenVEX\n...\n\n</pre></div><p>Each attestation is a JSON document describing a specific aspect of the image.

Docker Scout provides a simple, integrated approach that handles DHI attestations natively and without the hassle of managing public keys or certificate chains.To validate an attestation, simply append the –verify flag, which provides explicit validation feedback. This process relies on cryptographic hashing: the digest is a hash of the attestation content, so even a single character change completely alters the hash. Moreover, the attestation’s signature is cryptographically bound to the specific image digest it describes, guaranteeing that the metadata you’re verifying corresponds exactly to the image you have and preventing substitution attacks.</p><h3>Retrieving an Attestation</h3><p>To extract a specific attestation (like SLSA provenance), use the attestation get command with the full predicate type URI:</p><div><pre>docker scout attestation get registry://&amp;lt;your-org-namespace&amp;gt;/dhi-node:24.11-debian13-fips \\\n  --predicate-type https://slsa.dev/provenance/v0.2 \\\n  --output provenance.json\n\n</pre></div><div><pre>✓ SBOM obtained from attestation, 32 packages found\n✓ Provenance obtained from attestation\n✓ Report written to provenance.json\n\n</pre></div><p>The checkmarks confirm Docker Scout successfully retrieved and verified the attestation.

It’s a comprehensive security configuration standard needed for deploying software for defense or government work.DHI images undergo STIG scanning before release. Docker uses a custom STIG based on the DoD’s General Operating System Security Requirements Guide. Each scan checks dozens of security controls and reports findings. You can extract and review STIG scan results:</p><div><pre>docker scout attestation get registry://&amp;lt;your-org-namespace&amp;gt;/dhi-node:24.11-debian13-fips \\\n  --predicate-type https://docker.com/dhi/stig/v0.1 \\\n  --output stig-attestation.json\n\n</pre></div><p>Check the STIG scan summary:</p><div><pre>jq '.predicate[0].summary' stig-attestation.json\n</pre></div><div><pre>{\n  \"failedChecks\": 0,\n  \"passedChecks\": 91,\n  \"notApplicableChecks\": 107,\n  \"totalChecks\": 198,\n  \"defaultScore\": 100,\n  \"flatScore\": 91\n}\n\n</pre></div><p>This shows DHI passed all 91 applicable STIG controls with zero failed checks and a 100% score.

The SBOM tells you what’s actually in your container—and that’s where the real security work begins.</p><h3>Identifying Transitive Dependencies</h3><p>When you add a package to your project, you see the direct dependency. What you don’t see: that package’s dependencies, and  dependencies, and so on. This is the transitive dependency problem.</p><p>A vulnerability in a transitive dependency you’ve never heard of can compromise your entire application. Real example: the Log4Shell vulnerability affected millions of applications because Log4j was a transitive dependency buried several levels deep in dependency chains.</p><p>Most vulnerabilities hide in transitive dependencies because:</p><ol><li>Developers don’t know they exist</li><li>They’re not updated when the direct dependency updates</li><li>Scanning tools miss them without an SBOM</li></ol><p>Minimal images reduce this risk dramatically. Fewer packages = fewer transitive dependencies = smaller attack surface.</p><p>Compare dependency counts:</p><ul><li>Official Node.js image: 321 packages, ~1,500 dependency relationships</li><li>DHI Node.js image: 32 packages, ~150 dependency relationships</li></ul><p>90% reduction in packages means 90% reduction in transitive dependency risk.</p><h3>Scanning for Known (Exploitable) Vulnerabilities</h3><p>With the SBOM extracted, scan for known vulnerabilities:</p><div><pre>docker scout cves registry://&amp;lt;your-org-namespace&amp;gt;/dhi-node:24.11-debian13-fips\n</pre></div><div><pre>Target: &amp;lt;your-org-namespace&amp;gt;/dhi-node:24.11-debian13-fips\n\n  0C     0H     0M     8L\n\n8 vulnerabilities found in 2 packages\n  CRITICAL  0\n  HIGH      0\n  MEDIUM    0\n  LOW       8\n\n</pre></div><p>Zero critical, high, or medium severity vulnerabilities. Docker Scout cross-references the SBOM against multiple vulnerability databases (NVD, GitHub Security Advisories, etc.).This is the payoff of minimal images: fewer packages means fewer potential vulnerabilities. The official Node.js image had 25 CVEs across CRITICAL, HIGH, and MEDIUM severities. The hardened version has zero actionable vulnerabilities—not because vulnerabilities were patched, but because vulnerable packages were removed entirely.</p><h3>Understanding Exploitability with VEX</h3><p>Not all CVEs are relevant to your deployment. A vulnerability in a library function your application never calls, or a flaw in a service that isn’t running, doesn’t pose real risk.&nbsp;Docker Hardened Images include signed VEX attestations that identify which reported CVEs are not actually exploitable in the image’s runtime context. This helps you distinguish between CVEs that exist in a package (reported), and CVEs that can  given how the package is used in this specific image (exploitable). <strong>In other words, VEX reduces false positives.</strong></p><div><table><tbody><tr><td></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>You can see which CVEs have been evaluated with this command:</p><div><pre>docker scout attestation get registry://&amp;lt;your-org-namespace&amp;gt;/dhi-node:24.11-debian13-fips \\\n  --predicate-type https://openvex.dev/ns/v0.2.0 \\\n  --output vex.json\n\n</pre></div><h3>License Compliance Analysis</h3><p>When you use open source software, you’re bound by license terms. Some licenses (MIT, Apache) are permissive and you can use them freely, even in commercial products. Others (GPL, AGPL) are copyleft: they require you to release your source code if you distribute software using them.</p><p>SBOMs make license compliance visible.

Organizations seek to reduce cloud costs and improve performance. AWS Graviton, Azure Cobalt, and Google Cloud Axion have made Arm-based computing mainstream, promising 20-40% cost savings and better performance for many workloads.</p><p>But here’s the challenge: How do you migrate your applications to Arm without breaking things?</p><p>Traditional migration approaches require:</p><ul><li>Manual code analysis for x86-specific dependencies</li><li>Tedious compatibility checks across multiple tools</li><li>Manual performance evaluation</li></ul><p>What if you could orchestrate the entire Arm migration workflow from a single interface? <a href=\"https://docs.docker.com/ai/mcp-catalog-and-toolkit/toolkit/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Docker MCP Toolkit</a> makes this possible.&nbsp;</p><p>By connecting specialized Arm migration tools directly to GitHub Copilot, you can automate compatibility analysis, intrinsic conversion, and performance prediction—all through natural conversation in VS Code.</p><p>Here’s what that looks like in practice: You ask GitHub Copilot to migrate your legacy C++ application to Arm64. Copilot doesn’t just tell you what needs changing—it actually executes: scanning your code for x86 intrinsics, converting x86 SIMD intrinsics to Arm SIMD intrinsics, updating your Dockerfile, predicting Arm performance improvements, and creating a pull request with all changes. All through natural conversation in VS Code. No manual porting. No up-front architecture expertise required.</p><p>If you have questions about any step in the process, you can directly ask Copilot, which will invoke the Arm MCP Server knowledge base tool. The knowledge base has information pulled directly from all Learning Paths on learn.arm.com, as well as knowledge of all Arm intrinsics, and will both summarize that information for you as well as provide links to the concrete documentation that you can peruse yourself.&nbsp;</p><p>Now you might ask – “Can’t I just rebuild my Docker image for Arm64?” True, for most applications. But when you hit that one legacy app with hand-optimized x86 assembly, AVX2 intrinsics, or architecture-specific compiler flags? That’s when Docker MCP Toolkit with the <a href=\"https://developer.arm.com/community/arm-community-blogs/b/ai-blog/posts/introducing-the-arm-mcp-server-simplifying-cloud-migration-with-ai\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Arm MCP Server</a> becomes essential.</p><p>By the end of this guide, you’ll migrate a real-world legacy application—a matrix multiplication benchmark written with AVX2 intrinsics for x86—to Arm64 automatically using GitHub Copilot and Docker MCP Toolkit.</p><p>What normally takes 5-7 hours of manual work will take you about 25 to 30 minutes.</p><h2>The Arm Migration Challenge</h2><p>Let me show you exactly what we’re solving. Consider a matrix multiplication benchmark originally written for x86-64 with AVX2 optimizations—the kind of code that makes Arm migration painful.</p><p>Here’s a Dockerfile that will cause problems when trying to migrate to Graviton:</p><div><pre>FROM centos:6\n\n# CentOS 6 reached EOL, need to use vault mirrors\nRUN sed -i 's|^mirrorlist=|#mirrorlist=|g' /etc/yum.repos.d/CentOS-Base.repo &amp;&amp; \\\n    sed -i 's|^#baseurl=http://mirror.centos.org|baseurl=http://vault.centos.org|g' /etc/yum.repos.d/CentOS-Base.repo\n\n# Install EPEL repository (required for some development tools)\nRUN yum install -y epel-release &amp;&amp; \\\n    sed -i 's|^mirrorlist=|#mirrorlist=|g' /etc/yum.repos.d/epel.repo &amp;&amp; \\\n    sed -i 's|^#baseurl=http://download.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel|baseurl=http://archives.fedoraproject.org/pub/archive/epel|g' /etc/yum.repos.d/epel.repo\n\n# Install Developer Toolset 2 for better C++11 support (GCC 4.8)\nRUN yum install -y centos-release-scl &amp;&amp; \\\n    sed -i 's|^mirrorlist=|#mirrorlist=|g' /etc/yum.repos.d/CentOS-SCLo-scl.repo &amp;&amp; \\\n    sed -i 's|^mirrorlist=|#mirrorlist=|g' /etc/yum.repos.d/CentOS-SCLo-scl-rh.repo &amp;&amp; \\\n    sed -i 's|^# baseurl=http://mirror.centos.org|baseurl=http://vault.centos.org|g' /etc/yum.repos.d/CentOS-SCLo-scl.repo &amp;&amp; \\\n    sed -i 's|^# baseurl=http://mirror.centos.org|baseurl=http://vault.centos.org|g' /etc/yum.repos.d/CentOS-SCLo-scl-rh.repo\n\n# Install build tools\nRUN yum install -y \\\n    devtoolset-2-gcc \\\n    devtoolset-2-gcc-c++ \\\n    devtoolset-2-binutils \\\n    make \\\n    &amp;&amp; yum clean all\n\nWORKDIR /app\nCOPY *.h *.cpp ./\n\n# AVX2 intrinsics are used in the code\nRUN scl enable devtoolset-2 \"g++ -O2 -mavx2 -o benchmark \\\n    main.cpp \\\n    matrix_operations.cpp \\\n    -std=c++11\"\n\nCMD [\"./benchmark\"]\n\n</pre></div><p>Now you might ask why this won’t work on Arm?

This is exactly where automated migration tools become essential.</p><p>Each of these issues blocks Arm migration in different ways. Manual migration requires not just converting intrinsics, but also modernizing the entire build infrastructure, finding Arm equivalents, and validating performance. For any substantial codebase, this becomes prohibitively expensive.</p><h2>What GitHub Copilot Can and Can’t Do Without Arm MCP</h2><p>Let’s be clear about what changes when you add the Arm MCP Server to Docker MCP Toolkit.</p><p>You ask GitHub Copilot to migrate your C++ application from x86 to Arm64. Copilot responds with general advice: “Convert AVX2 intrinsics to NEON”, “Update your Dockerfile to use ARM64 base image”, “Change compiler flags”. Then you must manually research NEON equivalents, rewrite hundreds of lines of intrinsic code, update the Dockerfile yourself, hope you got the conversion right, and spend hours debugging compilation errors.</p><p>Yes, Copilot can write code. But without specialized tools, it’s guessing based on training data—not using concrete knowledge base documentation or using purpose-built tools to analyze your actual application architecture.</p><h3>With Arm MCP + Docker MCP Toolkit</h3><p>You ask GitHub Copilot the same thing. Within minutes, it:</p><ol><li>Uses  tool to verify your base image supports ARM64</li><li>Runs  on your actual codebase to find x86-specific code</li><li>Uses  to find correct Arm SIMD equivalents for every x86 intrinsic</li><li>Converts your code with architecture-specific accuracy</li><li>Updates your Dockerfile with Arm-compatible base images</li><li>Creates a pull request with all changes.</li></ol><p>Real code gets scanned. Real intrinsics get converted. Real pull requests appear in your repository. Close VS Code, come back tomorrow, and the migration is ready to test, complete with documentation explaining every change.</p><p>The difference? Docker MCP Toolkit gives GitHub Copilot access to actual Arm migration tooling, not just general knowledge about Arm architecture.</p><h3>Why This Is Different from Manual Migration</h3><p>You could manually use Arm migration tools: install utilities locally, run checks, research intrinsics, update code. Here’s what that process looks like:</p><ol><li>Install Arm migration tools (15 minutes)</li><li>Run compatibility scans (5 minutes)</li><li>Research each x86 intrinsic equivalent (30 minutes per intrinsic)</li><li>Manually rewrite code (2-3 hours)</li><li>Update Dockerfile (15 minutes)</li><li>Fix compilation errors (1-2 hours)</li><li>Document changes (30 minutes)</li></ol><p><strong>Total: 5-7 hours per application</strong></p><p><strong>With Docker MCP Toolkit + Arm MCP:</strong></p><ol><li>Ask GitHub Copilot to migrate (20 minutes)</li><li>Review and approve changes (10-20 minutes)</li></ol><p><strong>Total: 30-40 minutes per application</strong></p><h2><strong>Setting Up Visual Studio Code with Docker MCP Toolkit</strong></h2><p>Before you begin, make sure you have:</p><ul><li>A machine with 8 GB RAM minimum (16GB recommended)</li><li>The latest Docker Desktop release</li><li>VS Code with GitHub Copilot extension</li><li>GitHub account with personal access token</li></ul><h3>Step 1.

In GitHub Copilot Chat, paste this prompt:</p><div><pre>Your goal is to migrate this codebase from x86 to Arm64. Use the Arm MCP Server tools to help you with this migration.\n\nSteps to follow:\n1. Check all Dockerfiles - use check_image and/or skopeo tools to verify Arm compatibility, changing the base image if necessary\n2. Scan the codebase - run migrate_ease_scan with the appropriate language scanner and apply the suggested changes\n3. Use knowledge_base_search when you need Arm architecture guidance or intrinsic equivalents\n4. Update compiler flags and dependencies for Arm64 compatibility\n5. **Create a pull request with all changes using GitHub MCP Server**\n\nImportant notes:\n- Your current working directory is mapped to /workspace on the MCP server\n- NEON lane indices must be compile-time constants, not variables\n- If you're unsure about Arm equivalents, use knowledge_base_search to find documentation\n- Be sure to find out from the user or system what the target machine is, and use the appropriate intrinsics. For instance, if neoverse (Graviton, Axion, Cobalt) is targeted, use the latest SME/SME2.\n\n\n**After completing the migration:**\n- Create a pull request with a detailed description of changes\n- Include performance predictions and cost savings in the PR description\n- List all tools used and validation steps needed\n\n</pre></div><h3>Step 2. Watch Docker MCP Toolkit Execute</h3><p>GitHub Copilot orchestrates the migration using Docker MCP Toolkit. Here’s what happens:</p><p>GitHub Copilot starts by analyzing the Dockerfile’s base image using the Arm MCP Server’s  tool.</p><p><em>Caption: GitHub Copilot uses the skopeo tool from the Arm MCP Server to analyze the centos:6 base image. The tool reports that this image&nbsp;has no arm64 build available. This is the first blocker identified – the container won’t even start on Arm hardware.</em></p><p>This immediately identifies that CentOS 6 has no Arm64 builds and must be replaced.</p><p>Next, Copilot runs the  tool with the C++ scanner on the codebase.</p><p><em>Caption: The migrate_ease_scan tool analyzes the C++ source code and detects AVX2 intrinsics, the -mavx2 compiler flag, and x86-specific headers. This automated scan identifies all architecture-dependent code that requires conversion – work that could take hours to find manually.</em></p><p>The scan results show exactly what needs to change for Arm compatibility. Each detected issue includes the file location, line number, and specific code that requires modification. This precision eliminates guesswork and ensures nothing is missed.</p><h4>Phase 3: Arm Optimization and Best Practices</h4><p>Forx86 intrinsics found in Phase 2, Copilot queries the Arm MCP Server’s knowledge base for Arm equivalents, if needed. It then makes replacements as necessary.</p><p><em>Caption: GitHub Copilot uses the knowledge_base_search tool to find Arm NEON equivalents for each AVX2 intrinsic.</em></p><p>The tool returns official Arm documentation showing the conversions:  becomes ,  becomes , and so on. This knowledge comes from learn.arm.com learning paths and intrinsic documentation.</p><p>The knowledge base provides not just the conversion mappings, but also architectural context: AVX2’s 256-bit vectors vs NEON’s 128-bit vectors, which means loop adjustments are needed. Copilot uses this information to rewrite the matrix multiplication code correctly.</p><h4>Phase 4: Create the GitHub PR and Summarize</h4><p>After completing the migration, Copilot creates a PR in GitHub and summarizes the changes made.</p><p>The changes are substantial:&nbsp;</p><ul><li><strong>Replaced centos:6 → ubuntu:22.04, added TARGETARCH for multi-arch builds</strong></li><li><strong>Added Arm64 detection and -march=armv8-a+simd compiler flag</strong></li><li><strong>Converted AVX2 → NEON intrinsics with architecture guards</strong></li></ul><p>The build is now simpler, modern, and Arm-compatible.</p><h4>Phase 5: Checking the Pull Request</h4><p>To verify performance, you can build and run the benchmark:</p><div><pre>docker buildx build --platform linux/arm64 -t benchmark:arm64 . --load\n\ndocker run --rm benchmark:arm64\n</pre></div><div><pre>SIMD Matrix Operations Benchmark\n================================\nRunning on Arm64 architecture with NEON optimizations\n=== Matrix Multiplication Benchmark ===\nMatrix size: 200x200\nTime: 17 ms\nResult sum: 1.98888e+08\n</pre></div><p>A very important thing to remember is that not all models will provide equal results, and while the Arm MCP Server provides deterministic context, the models themselves are stochastic. Always use a flagship latest-generation model to get the best results, and test any guesses the model makes regarding performance improvement.</p><h2>How Docker MCP Toolkit Changes Development</h2><p>Docker MCP Toolkit changes how developers interact with specialized knowledge and capabilities. Rather than learning new tools, installing dependencies, or managing credentials, developers connect their AI assistant once and immediately access containerized expertise.</p><p>The benefits extend beyond Arm migration:</p><ul><li> – Same tools, same results across all developers</li><li> – Containerized isolation prevents tool interference</li><li> – MCP server versions tracked with application code</li><li> – Migrations behave identically across environments</li><li> – Docker MCP Catalog makes finding the right server straightforward</li></ul><p>Most importantly, developers remain in their existing workflow.

If you don’t understand VPCs, subnets, and routing, everything above them breaks sooner or&nbsp;later.</p><p>The objective was straightforward but non-negotiable for production readiness:</p><ul><li>Configure a public subnet with automatic public IP assignment</li><li>Launch an EC2 instance inside&nbsp;it</li><li>Enable secure SSH access from the&nbsp;internet</li></ul><h3>Concept Explanation: Public VPC and Public&nbsp;Subnet</h3><p>A <strong>VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)</strong> is a logically isolated network in AWS where you&nbsp;control:</p><ul></ul><p>A  is defined by one key property:</p><blockquote></blockquote><p>Additionally, for EC2 instances to be reachable:</p><ul><li>The subnet must allow </li><li>The instance security group must allow inbound&nbsp;traffic</li></ul><p>In Amazon Web Services, this pattern is used&nbsp;for:</p><ul></ul><p>Public access is intentional — not accidental.</p><h3>Why This Matters in Real Environments</h3><p>Misconfigured networking is one of the <strong>top causes of broken deployments</strong>.</p><ul><li>Proper security group&nbsp;rules</li></ul><p>Your application is effectively invisible — even if it’s “running.”</p><p>This setup enables teams&nbsp;to:</p><ul><li>Deploy public-facing services&nbsp;safely</li><li>Maintain clear separation between public and private workloads</li><li>Scale infrastructure without redesigning the network&nbsp;later</li></ul><p>Common mistakes engineers make:</p><ul><li>Forgetting to attach an  to the&nbsp;VPC</li><li>Not enabling auto-assign public IP on the&nbsp;subnet</li><li>Opening SSH to the world without understanding the&nbsp;risk</li><li>Confusing public IPs with Elastic&nbsp;IPs</li><li>Assuming “public subnet” is a checkbox (it’s&nbsp;not)</li></ul><p>Public access is a result of , not&nbsp;naming.</p><h3>Hands-On Task: What I&nbsp;Did</h3><h3>1️⃣ Created the Public&nbsp;VPC</h3><ul><li>Created a VPC named nautilus-pub-vpc</li><li>Used an appropriate CIDR&nbsp;block</li><li>Attached an  to the&nbsp;VPC</li></ul><p>This established internet connectivity at the VPC&nbsp;level.</p><h3>2️⃣ Created the Public&nbsp;Subnet</h3><ul><li>Created a subnet named nautilus-pub-subnet within the&nbsp;VPC</li><li>Enabled <strong>auto-assign public IPv4&nbsp;address</strong></li><li>Associated the subnet with a route table containing:</li><li>0.0.0.0/0 → Internet&nbsp;Gateway</li></ul><p>This ensured resources launched here are internet-reachable.</p><h3>3️⃣ Launched the EC2&nbsp;Instance</h3><ul><li>Created an EC2 instance named nautilus-pub-ec2</li><li>Launched it inside nautilus-pub-subnet</li><li>Verified that it received a public IP automatically</li></ul><h3>4️⃣ Configured SSH&nbsp;Access</h3><ul><li>Created or updated a security&nbsp;group</li><li>Allowed inbound  from the&nbsp;internet</li><li>Attached the security group to nautilus-pub-ec2</li></ul><p>The instance was now accessible over the internet via&nbsp;SSH.</p><h3>What I Learned / Key Takeaways</h3><ul><li>Public access is defined by routing, not&nbsp;intent</li><li>Auto-assign public IP is critical for public&nbsp;subnets</li><li>Internet Gateway is mandatory for outbound/inbound traffic</li><li>Security groups are the last line of&nbsp;defense</li><li>Network design should be deliberate from day&nbsp;one</li></ul><p>Networking mistakes don’t fail loudly — they just block everything.</p><p>Creating a public VPC with a public subnet is a <strong>baseline cloud networking skill</strong>.</p><p>This challenge reinforced a core principle:<strong>If you don’t control the network, you don’t control the&nbsp;system.</strong></p><p>With this setup, the Nautilus DevOps Team now has a clean, scalable foundation for hosting public-facing applications in&nbsp;AWS.</p><p>On to the next challenge.</p><p>If you’re learning AWS or DevOps through <strong>hands-on infrastructure design</strong>, follow the journey.Each challenge focuses on building systems the way real teams&nbsp;do.</p><img

Kumar","guid":419352,"unread":true,"content":"<p>Kubernetes has become the standard platform for orchestrating containerized applications. It offers powerful abstractions for deploying, scaling and managing workloads. However, the compute layer beneath it often remains difficult to optimize. Managing the worker nodes that provide actual capacity can be challenging, when clusters experience rapid or unpredictable changes in&nbsp;demand.</p><p>Traditionally, teams relied on the Kubernetes  to add or remove capacity. This tool provided basic automation, but it also introduced limitations that will be explored in the next&nbsp;section.</p><p> was created to provide a more flexible and efficient way to manage cluster capacity. It is an open source and high performance provisioning engine that responds directly to pods that cannot be scheduled. Instead of depending on predefined cloud node groups, Karpenter evaluates the specific needs of pending pods and launches compute resources that match those requirements. This model allows clusters to scale quickly and cost effectively while meeting the unique constraints of each workload.</p><p>In the upcoming sections, we will look at the key building blocks of Karpenter such as NodeClasses, NodePools and NodeClaims. Also, we will explore in detail how Karpenter schedules new capacity and manages node lifecycles within a Kubernetes environment.</p><h3>Advantages of Karpenter over Cluster Autoscaler</h3><p>The Kubernetes Cluster Autoscaler has served as the traditional tool for adjusting cluster capacity, but its design is closely tied to cloud provider node groups and it becomes difficult to manage diverse workloads. Karpenter introduces a more flexible and responsive model for provisioning compute resources that offers below advantages.</p><ul><li><strong>Direct and faster provisioning: </strong>Cluster Autoscaler must work through predefined node groups that adds delay to the provisioning process. Karpenter observes pending pods directly and creates new nodes based on the exact resource requirements. This results in significantly faster reaction times and more efficient cluster scaling during workload&nbsp;spikes.</li><li><strong>Greater flexibility in instance selection: </strong>Cluster Autoscaler can only scale the instance types defined in each node group. Karpenter can choose from the full range of cloud provider instance types and select the best option at the moment of provisioning. This gives the scheduler more freedom to match compute resources to workload needs such as memory optimized, compute optimized or specialized architectures.</li><li><strong>Simplified infrastructure management: </strong>Karpenter removes the need for large numbers of node groups and instead uses a declarative and constraint based approach. This simplifies cluster configuration and reduces the burden of maintaining cloud specific autoscaling constructs.</li><li><strong>Improved cost efficiency: </strong>Karpenter can reduce wasted capacity by selecting the most suitable instance type in real time. It can consider options such as burstable instances or spot capacity when appropriate.</li><li><strong>Better support for dynamic workloads: </strong>Modern applications often require rapid changes in compute capacity. Karpenter is designed to respond quickly and adaptively that makes it a strong fit for environments with unpredictable traffic, batch processing, event driven systems and high scale workloads.</li></ul><h3>NodeClasses: Cloud-Specific Configuration</h3><p>A  represents the cloud specific configuration that is applied to the nodes Karpenter creates. While Kubernetes focuses on abstract concepts such as pods and nodes, a NodeClass connects those nodes to real infrastructure in your cloud provider account. It captures details such as subnet, security group, instance profile, tags, labels and other settings that are required to launch instances correctly and securely. NodePools and NodeClaims reference a NodeClass so that scheduling logic can remain focused on workload intent, while the NodeClass handles provider&nbsp;details.</p><p>Some important attributes you typically find in a provider specific NodeClass (for example  on )&nbsp;include:</p><ul><li>Specifies the AMI family to use when provisioning nodes. Determines the machine image and base configuration applied at&nbsp;launch.</li><li>Defines the IAM instance profile that the node will assume in order to access cloud APIs, fetch images, write logs and perform required operations.</li><li><strong>spec.subnetSelectorTerms: </strong>Selects which subnets the nodes can be launched into based on matching labels or criteria. This controls node placement, routing behaviour and overall network topology.</li><li><strong>spec.securityGroupSelectorTerms: </strong>Determines which security groups are attached to the nodes when they are created. This governs firewall rules, network access and communication boundaries for the&nbsp;nodes.</li><li>Provides key value tags applied to provisioned instances and associated resources. Supports cost tracking, ownership metadata and automation workflows.</li><li><strong>spec.blockDeviceMappings: </strong>Describes storage settings such as root volume type, size and encryption parameters applied to new&nbsp;nodes.</li><li>Optionally supplies bootstrap instructions or startup configuration that runs when a node initializes such as cluster join scripts or agent&nbsp;setup.</li></ul><p>The following is an example of an AWS specific NodeClass using the  resource. This is only an illustration, but it shows the typical structure you would define before wiring it with a NodePool:</p><pre>apiVersion: karpenter.k8s.aws/v1beta1kind: EC2NodeClass  name: default-ec2-nodeclass  amiFamily: AL2<p>  role: \"karpenter-node-role\"</p>  subnetSelectorTerms:      Environment: \"prod\"  securityGroupSelectorTerms:      KubernetesCluster: \"my-eks-cluster\"    Owner: \"platform-team\"  blockDeviceMappings:    ebs:      volumeType: gp3  detailedMonitoring: true</pre><h3>NodePools: Defining Node Constraints</h3><p>A  in Karpenter describes the intent for how new nodes should look and behave from the point of view of Kubernetes workloads. It focuses on scheduling constraints and policies. It tells Karpenter what kinds of nodes are allowed for a group of pods including labels, taints, instance type preferences and zone choices. This separation allows platform teams to encode infrastructure standards in NodeClasses and application or capacity strategies in NodePools.</p><p>When pods are pending and cannot be scheduled on existing nodes, Karpenter checks which NodePools satisfy the pod requirements and then chooses a suitable combination of NodePool and NodeClass to create new nodes. Additionally, NodePools define behaviour such as consolidation, node expiration and limits that control how the cluster grows and shrinks over&nbsp;time.</p><p>These are some important attributes of the  custom resource:</p><ul><li><strong>spec.template.metadata.labels: </strong>Default labels that will be applied to nodes created from this pool. These help select or identify nodes for specific workloads.</li><li><strong>spec.template.spec.nodeClassRef: </strong>A reference to the NodeClass that provides cloud provider configuration for the nodes in this&nbsp;pool.</li><li><strong>spec.template.spec.requirements: </strong>A list of scheduling requirements that restrict which instance families, sizes, architectures or zones are valid. These are expressed using standard Kubernetes style key, operator and values&nbsp;fields.</li><li>Settings that control how Karpenter performs consolidation, replacement or expiration. For example, you can choose when to remove underutilized nodes or how long nodes should&nbsp;live.</li><li>Optional soft limits on total resources. It is used to keep the overall capacity of a pool within a desired&nbsp;range.</li></ul><p>The following is an example  that uses the from the previous section and defines some common constraints and behaviours:</p><pre>apiVersion: karpenter.sh/v1beta1kind: NodePool  name: general-purpose  template:      labels:    spec:        name: default-ec2-nodeclass      - key: \"karpenter.k8s.aws/instance-family\"        values: [\"m5\", \"m6i\"]<p>      - key: \"karpenter.k8s.aws/instance-size\"</p>        operator: In<p>        values: [\"large\", \"xlarge\", \"2xlarge\"]</p>      - key: \"topology.kubernetes.io/zone\"        values: [\"us-east-1a\", \"us-east-1b\"]    consolidationPolicy: WhenUnderutilized  limits:    memory: 1000Gi</pre><h3>NodeClaims: The Node Request Lifecycle</h3><p>A  represents the lifecycle of a single node request in Karpenter. While NodePools describe the constraints for groups of nodes and NodeClasses define the cloud provider configuration, a NodeClaim is the actual request for a new node. Each NodeClaim corresponds to one physical or virtual machine and acts as the bridge between Kubernetes and the cloud provider. It captures the chosen instance type, zone, labels, capacity and the current state of node provisioning.</p><p>NodeClaims allow Karpenter to track the entire lifespan of a node from the moment pods cannot be scheduled through provisioning and registration until the node becomes ready. Since NodeClaims are created automatically, users rarely need to write or modify them directly but they are extremely valuable for understanding scheduling decisions, debugging scaling events or verifying cloud provider configuration.</p><h4>How NodeClaims Are Created Internally</h4><p>The lifecycle begins when Karpenter detects pods stuck in a Pending state. The controller continuously watches the Kubernetes API server and identifies pods that cannot be scheduled due to insufficient resources. Once detected, Karpenter runs its bin packing algorithm to evaluate pod requirements. It considers CPU, memory, volume requirements, taints, labels and all NodePool constraints. It selects the smallest and most cost efficient node shape that satisfies all conditions.</p><p>After determining the ideal configuration, Karpenter creates a  object. The NodeClaim contains fields that define the instance type, zone and references to the NodeClass that holds cloud provider settings. The controller reads the NodeClaim and issues cloud provider API calls such as ec2 RunInstances for AWS. The instance boots, joins the cluster as a Kubernetes Node and the NodeClaim progresses through states such as launching, registering and ready. Once the node reports , Karpenter schedules the pending pods onto&nbsp;it.</p><p>The following is a simplified example of a NodeClaim object that Karpenter generates:</p><pre>apiVersion: karpenter.sh/v1kind: NodeClaim  name: default-sfpsl    karpenter.sh/nodepool: default<p>    topology.kubernetes.io/zone: us-east-1a</p>    node.kubernetes.io/instance-type: m5.large  nodeClassRef:<p>    name: default-ec2-nodeclass</p>  # Other internal provisioning details  providerID: aws:///us-east-1a/i-0xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx<p>  nodeName: ip-10-0-12-34.us-east-1.compute.internal</p>  capacity:    memory: 7800Mi  conditions:    status: \"True\"</pre><h3>Karpenter’s Scheduling Workflow</h3><p>Karpenter’s scheduling workflow is proactive and works alongside the default Kubernetes scheduler. Instead of waiting for predefined node groups to scale, Karpenter analyzes real time pod demand and provisions the most suitable node based on workload and infrastructure constraints.</p><p>The following steps describe the Karpenter’s scheduling workflow:</p><ol><li>A new pod is created by a Deployment or other controller but the Kubernetes scheduler cannot place it on any existing node because there is not enough available capacity. The pod enters a Pending&nbsp;state.</li><li>The Karpenter controller continuously watches the Kubernetes API server and detects the unschedulable pod.</li><li>Karpenter gathers all scheduling constraints from the pending pod that gives Karpenter a complete picture of the pod’s needs. - Resource requests such as CPU, memory and GPU. - Node affinity rules.<p> - Tolerations for taints applied by NodePools.</p> - Topology spread constraints.<p> - Volume requirements if applicable.</p></li><li>Karpenter checks all available NodePools and determines which ones can satisfy the aggregated pod constraints. Only NodePools that match all requirements proceed to the next&nbsp;step.</li><li><strong>Bin packing and optimal selection: </strong>For the compatible NodePools, Karpenter performs a bin packing simulation: - It groups batches of pending pods.<p> - It evaluates all valid instance types and zones allowed by the NodePool.</p> - It chooses the smallest and most cost efficient instance shape that satisfies all constraints.</li><li><strong>NodeClaim creation and cloud launch: </strong>After selecting the best node configuration, Karpenter creates a NodeClaim. The NodeClaim includes: - Chosen instance type.<p> - Selected availability zone.</p> - Reference to the NodeClass for provider configuration.<p>Karpenter then calls the cloud provider API to launch the actual instance. The instance starts, bootstraps, and joins the cluster as a Kubernetes Node.</p></li><li>Once the new node becomes Ready, the Kubernetes scheduler places the previously pending pods onto it. The scaling cycle completes and applications resume normal operation.</li></ol><h3>Karpenter’s Disruption Workflow</h3><p>Disruption in Karpenter ensures that existing nodes are gracefully terminated and replaced in order to maintain efficiency, security and cost effectiveness within the cluster. While scaling brings new nodes into the system, disruption handles the responsible removal of nodes that are no longer needed or no longer compliant with cluster configuration. This workflow allows clusters to remain optimized over time without manual intervention. Disruptions are performed safely and strategically that always respects workload availability and Pod Disruption Budgets.</p><h4>Automated Disruption Methods</h4><ul><li>Nodes are disrupted when their current configuration no longer matches the NodeClass/EC2NodeClass. This includes differences in AMI, user data, tags or other provider settings. Drift ensures compliance with infrastructure as code&nbsp;updates.</li><li>Karpenter inspects cluster utilization and identifies opportunities to reduce&nbsp;costs.</li><li>: Removes nodes that have no workload&nbsp;pods.</li><li>: Attempts to pack the node’s pods onto other nodes or replace the node with a smaller or cheaper equivalent instance.</li><li>Nodes are replaced after the time specified in <strong>spec.template.spec.expireAfter</strong> of the NodePool. This ensures regular node recycling for security patches, kernel updates and base image&nbsp;changes.</li><li>Nodes are disrupted when a cloud provider issues events such as spot interruptions, maintenance events or hardware failures. Karpenter detects these signals and proactively replaces the affected nodes to maintain application availability.</li></ul><ol><li>The Disruption Controller identifies a node that meets criteria for disruption such as expiration or&nbsp;drift.</li><li>Karpenter applies the taint <strong>karpenter.sh/disrupted:NoSchedule</strong> to the node. This prevents any new pods from landing on the node during the disruption workflow.</li><li><strong>Simulation and Replacement: </strong>Karpenter performs a scheduling simulation to verify that all pods on the node can be safely rescheduled. This simulation ensures: - Ensures Pod Disruption Budgets (PDBs) are respected.<p> - Determines whether existing nodes can host the pods.</p> - Decides if a replacement node must be created via a new NodeClaim.<p> If the simulation fails, disruption is postponed.</p></li><li><strong>Draining and Termination: </strong>If simulation succeeds, Karpenter drains the node by evicting its pods. After draining the node: - Karpenter issues a cloud provider API call (such as EC2 terminate).<p> - The NodeClaim finalizer ensures that cloud resources are fully cleaned up.</p>- The node is removed from the&nbsp;cluster.</li></ol><p>This section ties together all previous concepts by walking through a practical end to end setup of Karpenter on Amazon EKS. By the end, you will understand how Karpenter installation, NodeClasses, NodePools, and NodeClaims come together to provision right sized compute for real workloads in response to&nbsp;demand.</p><h4>Installation and IAM&nbsp;Setup</h4><p>Karpenter relies on AWS IAM permissions to launch, manage and terminate EC2 instances. These permissions are assigned through IRSA (IAM Roles for Service Accounts), ensuring that the Karpenter controller can securely authenticate with&nbsp;AWS.</p><ul><li>Karpenter needs to launch, describe and terminate instances and query networking resources: - ec2:RunInstances - ec2:DescribeInstances<p> - ec2:DescribeInstanceTypes</p> - ec2:DescribeInstanceTypeOfferings - ec2:DescribeSubnets - ec2:DescribeSecurityGroups<p> - ec2:DescribeLaunchTemplates</p> - ec2:DescribeLaunchTemplateVersions<p> - ec2:DescribeAvailabilityZones</p> - ec2:DescribeSpotPriceHistory - ec2:DeleteTags</li><li>Karpenter itself should not assume the node role, but it must be allowed to attach it to new EC2 instances: - iam:PassRole - iam:ListInstanceProfiles</li><li>To choose the most cost effective instance types, Karpenter may query AWS pricing: - pricing:GetProducts</li><li><strong>SSM and SSM Parameter Store: </strong>If you rely on SSM parameters or use SSM to manage AMIs: - ssm:GetParameter - ssm:GetParametersByPath</li><li><strong>EKS (cluster level information): </strong>Karpenter sometimes needs to query details about the EKS cluster: - eks:DescribeCluster</li></ul><h4>Install Karpenter via&nbsp;Helm</h4><p>Once IAM and IRSA are configured, install the controller:</p><pre>helm upgrade --install karpenter oci://public.ecr.aws/karpenter/karpenter \\  --namespace karpenter --create-namespace \\<p>  --set settings.clusterName=&lt;your-cluster-name&gt; \\</p>  --set settings.clusterEndpoint=&lt;your-cluster-endpoint&gt; \\<p>  --set serviceAccount.annotations.\"eks\\.amazonaws\\.com/role-arn\"=&lt;KarpenterRoleARN&gt;</p></pre><p>This deploys Karpenter and gives it the necessary permissions to manage node provisioning in your EKS&nbsp;cluster.</p><h3>Define NodeClass and&nbsp;NodePool</h3><h4>NodeClass: Cloud Provider Configuration</h4><p>This is a simplified EC2NodeClass example that incorporates concepts explained earlier such as subnet selection, security groups, AMI family,&nbsp;tags:</p><pre>apiVersion: karpenter.k8s.aws/v1beta1kind: EC2NodeClass  name: default-ec2-nodeclass  amiFamily: AL2<p>  role: \"karpenter-node-role\"</p>  subnetSelectorTerms:        Environment: prod<p>  securityGroupSelectorTerms:</p>    - tags:<p>        KubernetesCluster: my-eks-cluster</p>  tags:    CostCenter: kubernetes</pre><h4>NodePool: Workload Constraints and Behaviour</h4><p>Next, create the NodePool that describes how nodes should be provisioned:</p><pre>apiVersion: karpenter.sh/v1beta1kind: NodePool  name: default  template:      labels:    spec:        name: default-ec2-nodeclass        - key: \"karpenter.k8s.aws/instance-family\"          values: [\"m5\", \"m6i\"]</pre><h3>Running a Deployment that Triggers&nbsp;Scaling</h3><p>Imagine deploying an application with a very high memory requirement. None of your existing nodes can fit these pods. So this is where Karpenter demonstrates its intelligent autoscaling capability.</p><pre>apiVersion: apps/v1kind: Deployment  name: high-mem-app  replicas: 3    matchLabels:  template:      labels:    spec:      - name: app-container<p>        image: public.ecr.aws/eks-distro/kubernetes/pause:3.2</p>        resources:            memory: \"8Gi\"</pre><p>Each pod requests 8 GiB of memory. With 3 replicas, we need 24 GiB of memory in total. Within seconds, a correctly sized node is created by karpenter that fits all workload pods in the most cost effective way.</p><p>Karpenter represents a major advancement in the way Kubernetes clusters manage and scale compute resources. It moves away from the older autoscaling approach that relies on predefined node groups and instead uses a workload aware provisioning model that responds directly to real time demand. This allows clusters to react faster and to launch nodes that match the exact needs of the workloads that leads to better performance and more efficient use of compute capacity.</p><p>Throughout this guide, we explored the key building blocks that make this possible. The  resource provides the cloud provider settings that define how nodes are created. The  resource captures the scheduling intent and the constraints used to guide provisioning decisions. The  resource represents the lifecycle of each individual node request. These concepts allow Karpenter to make smart provisioning decisions, optimize scheduling and gracefully manage node replacement through its disruption process.</p><p>For any organization running dynamic and modern cloud native applications that adopts Karpenter can lead to simpler operations, lower compute costs and a more responsive Kubernetes environment. As clusters continue to grow in size and complexity, a provisioning engine that can think in real time and react to actual workload needs becomes essential. Karpenter delivers exactly that and stands out as a powerful step forward for efficient and intelligent cluster management.</p><p><strong><em>If you find my work valuable and would like to support it, you are welcome to </em></strong><a href=\"http://paypal.me/anishkumar14743\"></a></p><img src=\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=04c688349f62\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" alt=\"\">","contentLength":20055,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"How ATM Withdrawals Work Across Banks: Inside the SBI to Axis to NPCI Flow","url":"https://blog.devops.dev/how-atm-withdrawals-work-across-banks-inside-the-sbi-to-axis-to-npci-flow-df7a03b415d4?source=rss----33f8b2d9a328---4","date":1769156202,"author":"Sanjay Singh","guid":419351,"unread":true,"content":"<div><p>When I withdraw money from an Axis Bank ATM using my SBI account, how does Axis Bank get my account information from SBI?
