In 2014, <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/the-fathers-of-the-internet-revolution-urge-todays-pioneers-to-reinvent-the-web\">Tim Berners-Lee</a> called for a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/mar/12/online-magna-carta-berners-lee-web\">“Magna Carta for the Web”</a> to restore the balance of power between individuals and institutions. This mirrors the original charter’s purpose: ensuring that those who occupy a territory have a meaningful stake in its governance.</p><p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web3\">Web 3.0</a>—the distributed, <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/decentralized-web\">decentralized Web</a> of tomorrow—is finally poised to change the Internet’s dynamic by returning ownership to data creators. This will change many things about what’s often described as the “CIA triad” of <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/digital-security\">digital security</a>: confidentiality, integrity, and availability. Of those three features, data integrity will become of paramount importance.</p><p>When we have agency in digital spaces, we naturally maintain their integrity—protecting them from deterioration and shaping them with intention. But in territories controlled by distant platforms, where we’re merely temporary visitors, that connection frays. A disconnect emerges between those who benefit from data and those who bear the consequences of compromised integrity. Like homeowners who care deeply about maintaining the property they own, users in the Web 3.0 paradigm will become stewards of their personal digital spaces.</p><p>This will be critical in a world where <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/ai-agents\">AI agents</a> don’t just answer our questions but act on our behalf. These agents may execute financial transactions, coordinate complex workflows, and autonomously operate critical infrastructure, making decisions that ripple through entire industries. As digital agents become more autonomous and interconnected, the question is no longer whether we will trust AI but what that trust is built upon. In the new age we’re entering, the foundation isn’t intelligence or efficiency—it’s integrity.</p><p>In information systems, integrity is the guarantee that data will not be modified without authorization, and that all transformations are verifiable throughout the data’s life cycle. While availability ensures that systems are running and confidentiality prevents unauthorized access, integrity focuses on whether information is accurate, unaltered, and consistent across systems and over time.</p><p>It’s a new idea. The undo button, which prevents accidental data loss, is an integrity feature. So is the reboot process, which returns a computer to a known good state. Checksums are an integrity feature; so are verifications of network transmission. Without integrity, security measures can backfire. Encrypting corrupted data just locks in errors. Systems that score high marks for availability but spread <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/misinformation\">misinformation</a> just become <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/amplifiers\">amplifiers</a> of risk.</p><p>All <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/it-systems\">IT systems</a> require some form of data integrity, but the need for it is especially pronounced in two areas today. First: <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/internet-of-things\">Internet of Things</a> devices interact directly with the physical world, so corrupted input or output can result in real-world harm. Second: AI systems are only as good as the integrity of the data they’re trained on, and the integrity of their decision-making processes. If that foundation is shaky, the results will be too.</p><p>Integrity manifests in four key areas. The first,  concerns the quality and authenticity of data entering a system. When this fails, consequences can be severe. In 2021, <a href=\"https://engineering.fb.com/2021/10/05/networking-traffic/outage-details/\">Facebook’s global outage</a> was triggered by a single mistaken command—an input error missed by automated systems. Protecting input integrity requires robust <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/authentication\">authentication</a> of data sources, cryptographic signing of sensor data, and diversity in input channels for cross-validation.</p><p>The second issue is  which ensures that systems transform inputs into outputs correctly. In 2003, the <a href=\"https://www.nerc.com/pa/rrm/ea/Documents/August_2003_Blackout_Final_Report.pdf\">U.S.-Canada blackout</a> affected 55 million people when a control-room process failed to refresh properly, resulting in damages exceeding US $6 billion. Safeguarding processing integrity means formally verifying algorithms, cryptographically protecting models, and monitoring systems for anomalous behavior.</p><p> covers the correctness of information as it’s stored and communicated. In 2023, the Federal Aviation Administration was <a href=\"https://www.thestack.technology/faa-outage-cause-notam-database-file-not-cyber/\">forced to halt</a> all U.S. departing flights because of a corrupted database file. Addressing this risk requires cryptographic approaches that make any modification computationally infeasible without detection, distributed storage systems to prevent single points of failure, and rigorous backup procedures.</p><p>Finally,  addresses the appropriate flow of information according to the norms of its larger context. It’s not enough for data to be accurate; it must also be used in ways that respect expectations and boundaries. For example, if a smart speaker listens in on casual family conversations and uses the data to build advertising profiles, that action would violate the expected boundaries of <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/data-collection\">data collection</a>. Preserving contextual integrity requires clear data-governance policies, principles that limit the use of data to its intended purposes, and mechanisms for enforcing information-flow constraints.</p><p>As AI systems increasingly make critical decisions with reduced human oversight, all these dimensions of integrity become critical.</p><h3>The Need for Integrity in Web 3.0</h3><p>As the digital landscape has shifted from Web 1.0 to <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/web-2-0\">Web 2.0</a> and now evolves toward Web 3.0, we’ve seen each era bring a different emphasis in the <a href=\"https://www.fortinet.com/resources/cyberglossary/cia-triad\">CIA triad</a> of confidentiality, integrity, and availability.</p><p>Returning to our home metaphor: When simply having shelter is what matters most, availability takes priority—the house must exist and be functional. Once that foundation is secure, confidentiality becomes important—you need locks on your doors to keep others out. Only after these basics are established do you begin to consider integrity, to ensure that what’s inside the house remains trustworthy, unaltered, and consistent over time.</p><p>Web 1.0 of the 1990s prioritized making information available. Organizations digitized their content, putting it out there for anyone to access. In Web 2.0, the Web of today, platforms for <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/e-commerce\">e-commerce</a>, <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/social-media\">social media</a>, and <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/cloud-computing\">cloud computing</a> prioritize confidentiality, as <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/personal-data\">personal data</a> has become the Internet’s currency.</p><p>Somehow, integrity was largely lost along the way. In our current Web architecture, where control is centralized and removed from individual users, the concern for integrity has diminished. The massive social media platforms have created environments where no one feels responsible for the truthfulness or quality of what circulates.</p><p>Web 3.0 is poised to change this dynamic by returning ownership to the data owners. This is not speculative; it’s already emerging. For example, <a href=\"https://activitypub.rocks/\">ActivityPub</a>, the protocol behind decentralized <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/social-networks\">social networks</a> like <a href=\"https://mastodon.social/explore\">Mastodon</a>, combines content sharing with built-in attribution. Tim Berners-Lee’s <a href=\"https://solidproject.org/\">Solid protocol</a> restructures the Web around personal data pods with granular access controls.</p><p>These technologies prioritize integrity through cryptographic verification that proves authorship, decentralized architectures that eliminate vulnerable central authorities, machine-readable semantics that make meaning explicit—structured data formats that allow computers to understand participants and actions, such as “Alice performed <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/surgery\">surgery</a> on Bob”—and transparent governance where rules are visible to all. As AI systems become more autonomous, communicating directly with one another via standardized protocols, these integrity controls will be essential for maintaining trust.</p><h3>Why Data Integrity Matters in AI</h3><p>For AI systems, integrity is crucial in four domains. The first is decision quality. With AI increasingly contributing to decision-making in <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/health-care\">health care</a>, justice, and finance, the integrity of both data and models’ actions directly impact human welfare. Accountability is the second domain. Understanding the causes of failures requires reliable logging, audit trails, and system records.</p><p>The third domain is the security relationships between components. Many authentication systems rely on the integrity of identity information and cryptographic keys. If these elements are compromised, malicious agents could impersonate trusted systems, potentially creating cascading failures as <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/agentic-ai\">AI agents</a> interact and make decisions based on corrupted credentials.</p><p>Finally, integrity matters in our public definitions of safety. Governments worldwide are introducing <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/ai-regulation-worldwide\">rules for AI</a> that focus on data accuracy, transparent algorithms, and verifiable claims about system behavior. Integrity provides the basis for meeting these legal obligations.</p><p>The importance of integrity only grows as AI systems are entrusted with more critical applications and operate with less human oversight. While people can sometimes detect integrity lapses, <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/autonomous-systems\">autonomous systems</a> may not only miss warning signs—they may exponentially increase the severity of breaches. Without assurances of integrity, organizations will not trust AI systems for important tasks, and we won’t realize the full potential of AI.</p><h3>How to Build AI Systems With Integrity</h3><p>Imagine an AI system as a home we’re building together. The integrity of this home doesn’t rest on a single security feature but on the thoughtful integration of many elements: solid foundations, well-constructed walls, clear pathways between rooms, and shared agreements about how spaces will be used.</p><p>We begin by laying the cornerstone: <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/pioneers-web-cryptography-future-authentication\">cryptographic verification</a>. Digital signatures ensure that data lineage is traceable, much like a title deed proves ownership. Decentralized identifiers act as digital <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/passports\">passports</a>, allowing components to prove identity independently. When the front door of our AI home recognizes visitors through their own keys rather than through a vulnerable central doorman, we create resilience in the architecture of trust.</p><p>Formal verification methods enable us to mathematically prove the structural integrity of critical components, ensuring that systems can withstand pressures placed upon them—especially in high-stakes domains where lives may depend on an AI’s decision.</p><p>Just as a well-designed home creates separate spaces, trustworthy AI systems are built with thoughtful compartmentalization. We don’t rely on a single barrier but rather layer them to limit how problems in one area might affect others. Just as a <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/kitchen\">kitchen</a> fire is contained by fire doors and independent smoke alarms, training data is separated from the AI’s inferences and output to limit the impact of any single failure or breach.</p><p>Throughout this AI home, we build transparency into the design: The equivalent of large windows that allow light into every corner is clear pathways from input to output. We install monitoring systems that continuously check for weaknesses, alerting us before small issues become catastrophic failures.</p><p>But a home isn’t just a physical structure, it’s also the agreements we make about how to live within it. Our governance frameworks act as these shared understandings. Before welcoming new residents, we provide them with certification standards. Just as landlords conduct credit checks, we conduct integrity assessments to evaluate newcomers. And we strive to be good neighbors, aligning our community agreements with broader societal expectations. Perhaps most important, we recognize that our AI home will shelter diverse individuals with varying needs. Our governance structures must reflect this diversity, bringing many stakeholders to the table. A truly trustworthy system cannot be designed only for its builders but must serve anyone authorized to eventually call it home.</p><p>That’s how we’ll create AI systems worthy of trust: not by blindly believing in their perfection but because we’ve intentionally designed them with integrity controls at every level.</p><p>Unlike other properties of security, like “available” or “private,” we don’t have a common adjective form for “integrity.” This makes it hard to talk about it. It turns out that there is a word in English: “integrous.” The Oxford English Dictionary recorded the word used in the mid-1600s but now <a href=\"https://www.oed.com/dictionary/integrous_adj?tab=factsheet&amp;tl=true#210671\">declares it obsolete</a>.</p><p>We believe that the word needs to be revived. We need the ability to describe a system with integrity. We must be able to talk about integrous systems design.</p><p>Ensuring integrity in AI presents formidable challenges. As models grow larger and more complex, maintaining integrity without sacrificing performance becomes difficult. Integrity controls often require computational resources that can slow systems down—particularly challenging for real-time applications. Another concern is that <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/emerging-technologies\">emerging technologies</a> like <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/quantum-computing\">quantum computing</a><a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/post-quantum-cryptography-2668949802\">threaten current cryptographic protections</a>. Additionally, the distributed nature of modern AI—which relies on vast ecosystems of <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/libraries\">libraries</a>, frameworks, and services—presents a large attack surface.</p><p>Beyond technology, integrity depends heavily on social factors. Companies often prioritize speed to market over robust integrity controls. Development teams may lack specialized knowledge for implementing these controls, and may find it particularly difficult to integrate them into legacy systems. And while some governments have begun establishing regulations for aspects of AI, we need worldwide alignment on governance for AI integrity.</p><p>Addressing these challenges requires sustained research into verifying and enforcing integrity, as well as recovering from breaches. Priority areas include <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/fault-tolerant\">fault-tolerant</a><a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/algorithms\">algorithms</a> for distributed learning, verifiable computation on encrypted data, techniques that maintain integrity despite <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/adversarial-attacks\">adversarial attacks</a>, and standardized metrics for certification. We also need interfaces that clearly communicate integrity status to human overseers.</p><p>As AI systems become more powerful and pervasive, the stakes for integrity have never been higher. We are entering an era where machine-to-machine interactions and autonomous agents will operate with reduced human oversight and make decisions with profound impacts.</p><p>The good news is that the tools for building systems with integrity already exist. What’s needed is a shift in mind-set: from treating integrity as an afterthought to accepting that it’s the core organizing principle of AI security.</p><p>The next era of technology will be defined not by what AI can do, but by whether we can trust it to know or especially to do what’s right. Integrity—in all its dimensions—will determine the answer.</p><h3>Sidebar: Examples of Integrity Failures</h3><p><em>Processing integrity failure</em>\nA 64-bit velocity calculation was converted to a 16-bit output, causing an error called overflow.

We demonstrate that adversaries can manipulate system telemetry to mislead AIOps agents into taking actions that compromise the integrity of the infrastructure they manage. We introduce techniques to reliably inject telemetry data using error-inducing requests that influence agent behavior through a form of adversarial reward-hacking; plausible but incorrect system error interpretations that steer the agent’s decision-making. Our attack methodology, AIOpsDoom, is fully automated—combining reconnaissance, fuzzing, and LLM-driven adversarial input generation—and operates without any prior knowledge of the target system.</p><p>To counter this threat, we propose AIOpsShield, a defense mechanism that sanitizes telemetry data by exploiting its structured nature and the minimal role of user-generated content.

The\n  talk would work if I skipped over them, but I could also witter on about them\n  for five (or ten) minutes.

Presentation tools include the ability to skip over slides\n  while I'm talking, and I made sure I practiced how to use them so I could skip\n  a bunch of slides without the audience knowing. It's crucial here that it's\n  invisible to the audience, I find it looks sloppy if anyone says “in the\n  interests of time I'll skip over these slides”. To do this, however, I do need\n  access to my laptop while presenting, venues that only provide a clicker while\n  loading the slides on some other machine lack that control. That started to\n  happen in my last couple of years, much to my annoyance.</p><p>When creating talks, I was always worried that I would run out of things to\n  say, even though experience told me I reliably crammed more stuff in than I\n  could possibly cover. Expansion Joints helped with this, I could aggressively\n  trim the core talk to less than I needed, and rely on the Expansion Joints to\n  fill the gap. In practice I usually didn't need the Expansion Joints anyway, but\n  their presence helped my confidence.</p><p>Using Expansion Joints was particularly important for me as I never\n  rehearsed my talks. I was always someone whose ability to present was driven by\n  adrenaline. Talking to a rubber duck just didn't work, the duck was clearly\n  every bit as bored as I was. Consequently the first time I gave a talk, I was\n  hazy as to how long it would take. Yet with Expansion Joints in place, I was\n  able to finish a talk right on time.</p><p>Expansion Joints enabled me to give the same talk\n  to different time slots. Sometimes I'd have thirty minutes, sometimes\n  forty-five. With Expansion Joints, I didn't need to change my slides,\n  particularly handy if a time cut (or more rarely a time increase) appeared at the\n  last moment. (Although in my later years, I handled this by doing a <a href=\"https://martinfowler.com/bliki/SuiteOfTalks.html\">Suite Of Talks</a>.)</p><p>Talks that encourage audience interaction need these because we can never\n  predict how much time the interaction will use up. Sometimes we get a steady\n  stream of questions, other times (particularly in Scandinavia, or\n  upper-Midwest America) a lack of questions had me blasting through the agenda.\n  Any such talk needed a double-dose of this temporal ballast.</p><p>Expansion Joints are at their most useful in later parts of the talk, as\n  it's then that I have the most information on how much time I have. Earlier\n  ones can still be handy, particularly if they come after an interactive\n  section when I'd like to rebase my timing.</p><div><p>The name was coined by Neal Ford, Matthew McCullough, and Nathaniel\n    Schutta in their excellent book <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0321820800/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0321820800&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=martinfowlerc-20\">Presentation Patterns</a>.</p></div>","contentLength":4090,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Learning web development: Arrays in JavaScript","url":"https://2ality.com/2025/08/javascript-arrays.html","date":1755475200,"author":"Dr. Axel Rauschmayer","guid":231709,"unread":true,"content":"<p>In this chapter we look at one way of storing more than one value in a variable: .</p>","contentLength":82,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Learning web development: Strings and methods in JavaScript","url":"https://2ality.com/2025/08/javascript-strings-methods.html","date":1755388800,"author":"Dr. Axel Rauschmayer","guid":230591,"unread":true,"content":"<p>In the last chapter, we worked with numbers.
