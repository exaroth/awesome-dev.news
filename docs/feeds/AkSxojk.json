Telemetry generation is becoming a solved problem, an implementation detail. But this has created a new challenge: a wealth of standardized signals with no standard meaning. Different systems instrumented with different semantics generating telemetry in their own unique language. And while signal correlation connects specific workloads, it fails when we need to understand our systems at a macro scale by joining disparate datasets.\nThat is, until we all agreed to speak the same language.\n\nJust as English as a lingua franca fueled progress across the internet, OpenTelemetry Semantic Conventions are providing a shared language for our systems. In this talk we’ll discuss why semantic interoperability is the real connective tissue, how it’s fueling deeper insights into our production environments, and the key role it plays in enabling the AI systems that are rapidly ushering in the next revolution of our industry.</article>","contentLength":1500,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/v/dlDTX-aDNzg?version=3","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Welcome + Opening Remarks - Austin Parker, Honeycomb","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_rqgWHaEvgc","date":1751391324,"author":"CNCF [Cloud Native Computing Foundation]","guid":179129,"unread":true,"content":"<article>Don't miss out!

It is very difficult to know which logs are useful and how exactly they are used. With Chronosphere's Control plane for logs users can now get a comprehensive analysis of value and usage patterns, along with sophisticated recommendations and control actions that allow some or most of the value derived from those logs to be preserved. In order to achieve our goals we have enhanced Fluent Bit to be more flexible in which logs are actioned upon and will share useful future additions to it.</article>","contentLength":1072,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/v/Z4umnlRdLtA?version=3","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Keynote: Hybrid Cloud Architecture: Making Big Bets on Open Standards - Margaret Dawson","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_hHiwa_3QU","date":1751391324,"author":"CNCF [Cloud Native Computing Foundation]","guid":179131,"unread":true,"content":"<article>Don't miss out!

With 39% of CNCF survey respondents already operating in hybrid environments, this model is here to stay. But as teams pursue cloud-native architectures, many skip a critical step: developing a clear cloud strategy and an observability approach to match.\nThe result is predictable— widening visibility gaps, redundant tooling and data, and spiraling costs as teams try to stitch together disconnected, vendor-specific systems never meant to work in concert. Hybrid environments expose these issues quickly, especially when workloads span multiple platforms without a unified way to observe and understand them.\nModernization efforts demand open observability from the start—not as an add-on. Technologies like OpenTelemetry, Fluent Bit, and Prometheus act as connective tissue across clouds, clusters, and on-prem infrastructure, enabling standardization where it’s needed most.\nThis talk outlines how to center open observability in your modernization journey: where to standardize architectural layers, how to maintain a more open approach, and why these decisions have long-term payoff. \nHybrid complexity is inevitable. Leading with open observability is how you stay in control—now and in the future.</article>","contentLength":1761,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/v/J_hHiwa_3QU?version=3","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Sponsored Keynote: Foundation-Led Innovation: OpenSearch's Impact on Modern Data I...

Learn more at https://kubecon.io\n\nNo Dependencies. No Plugins. Just Native OpenTelemetry - Liudmila Molkova, Microsoft\n\nThe best telemetry starts at the source—inside the client libraries.\nBut in most cases, that means taking a dependency on the OpenTelemetry API from your library. And while it’s stable, minimal, reliable, and safely no-op unless configured—transitive dependencies are still the bane of any library developer’s existence, and most of us try to avoid them.\n\nTo work around this, people reach for abstractions, plugins, bridges, or even OTel forks that break context propagation. The result? A poor user experience. Users must find the right plugin, install it, wire it up—and still hit the diamond dependency problem, now it just affects a subset of users.\n\nBut what if you could take a truly optional dependency? If OpenTelemetry is on the classpath, instrumentation kicks in. If it’s not, no harm done.\nHow hard is that to pull off? How reliable? How performant?\n\nLet’s explore that—through the lens of the next generation of Azure SDKs for Java. Spoiler: it’s easy and fast, and as a side-bonus, we can fall back to logs-based tracing if OTel is not found.</article>","contentLength":1544,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/v/fU6jsw0yaVU?version=3","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Closing Remarks - Austin Parker, Honeycomb","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eDbQfZ9eoNI","date":1751391275,"author":"CNCF [Cloud Native Computing Foundation]","guid":179125,"unread":true,"content":"<article>Don't miss out!

But for a host of reasons, the match is not perfect, especially for developers who only write in Kotlin, which is the recommended development language for Android by Google, not the least of which is the emergence of Kotlin Multiple Platform (KMP) as a means to share code between Android, iOS, and many other platforms.\n\nThis session will outline the reasons why we at Embrace is trying to kick-start the development of a pure Kotlin ecosystem for OTel, starting with an API and SDK implementation, and how we are doing it in a way where mobile developers can get value incrementally without having to wait until every aspect is fully built out.\n\nWe want OTel to feel natural and idiomatic for Android developers, and this is the first step towards that end.</article>","contentLength":1361,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/v/di5nhYvUh6w?version=3","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"They Hired Me to Steal a Shopping Cart Full of Human DNA 🧬 Darknet Diaries Ep. 160: Greg","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YV5XVcNLHzs","date":1751380242,"author":"Jack Rhysider","guid":178972,"unread":true,"content":"<article>Greg Linares (AKA Laughing Mantis) shares his hunts for Zero Day exploits, the triple(?) agent working at Microsoft, how he became the youngest hacker ever arrested in Arizona, and that time a client hired him to steal human DNA.\n\nFollow Greg on Twitter: https://x.com/Laughing_Mantis.\n\nVisit https://darknetdiaries.com/episode/160 for a list of sources, full transcripts, and to listen to all episodes.</article>","contentLength":403,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/v/YV5XVcNLHzs?version=3","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"The Industries Adopting Rust","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRgtK2DsEXM","date":1751379309,"author":"Let's Get Rusty","guid":178971,"unread":true,"content":"<article>If you love coding in Rust but aren’t sure how to turn that passion into a full-time career, this video is for you.

Software engineer Flavia Circiumaru and host Hannes Lowette dive deep into how this London-based regulatory compliance company transformed from a support-free-for-all to a streamlined powerhouse.\n\nFlavia Circiumaru reveals the behind-the-scenes story of building a three-desk support system that turned their support team into the ultimate connector, bridging customers, developers, and business teams like never before. From battling context-switching nightmares to creating communication magic, Flavia and Hannes explore actionable insights on scaling support without losing your sanity.\n\nThe twist? Their ultimate goal is to make support so seamless that dedicated teams won't even be needed.

It so perfectly models the problem at hand that even a trained house cat could generate business value. You just have one problem, your interpreter runs 100x slower than a shell script launching JVMs in a loop.\n\n#DomainSpecificLanguages (DSLs) are able to offer the abstraction benefits of a high-level language, while when compiled, competing with low-level languages on performance. Because DSLs have a much smaller problem area, many specialised optimisations can be performed which are not feasible for a general purpose language.\n\nIn this talk, we will explain a number of optimisations which are useful for DSLs, and show our solutions to the practical issues we faced when implementing them in our #QueryLanguage, #Icicle.\n\nIcicle is a query language for processing large amounts of time-series data. Its type system enforces that queries require only a single pass over the data, and that multiple queries over the same data can be fused together. By using a combination of high level optimisations such as partial evaluation and common subexpression elimination, and low level optimisations such as parsing code which is specialised for the given input, our queries are faster than the equivalent hand-written C code.\n\nFrom this talk, the audience will learn how the focused point of view that DSLs provide can be useful in performance critical systems, as well as a number of concrete techniques for optimising their own DSLs.\n\nRECOMMENDED BOOKS\nKenneth E.
