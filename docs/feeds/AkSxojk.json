GitHub Copilot now lives in more places than just your IDE. It's in your terminal, your browser, and in your pull requests. It can learn your entire codebase and help you understand it.\n\nIn this session, we'll look at what Copilot is, what it's become, and how it works. We'll run through the software engineering lifecycle from idea to production and highlight all the areas where tools like Copilot can save you time and effort. Finally, we'll talk about how GitHub Copilot was created, how it's being improved, and a little about the future of AI tooling.

Efficiency is ruining our happiness, and weirdly, it‚Äôs also ruining our efficiency. Heeeeelppp!? What‚Äôs a techie to do? Zombie servers and slow code are a big climate problem, but the vrrrooom model gives us double-win hope. Holly walks through a range of techniques that can be used to find and eliminate software waste and reduce climate impacts.\n\nBut machine efficiency isn‚Äôt much use without human efficiency. Surprisingly, sorting out machine efficiency often helps humans, too. For example, the Quarkus Java framework uses many interesting waste-reduction techniques. These optimisations have the dual benefit of speeding up computers, and also speeding up people.\n\nSo far, so good, but we need to be careful we don‚Äôt end up accidentally optimising the wrong things, and making stuff worse. 100% utilisation is not sustainable for either humans, or people. It‚Äôs not even very efficient (what!?). Holly gives a brief tour of the brain‚Äôs default mode network, the latest business research, and queueing theory, to show why we actually achieve more when we do a bit less.
