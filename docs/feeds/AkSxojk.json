This has happened throughout computing history, with the computer terminal, with early smartphones, and now it's happening again with AI.\n\nAt tldraw, we’ve been working on moving AI interaction away from the chat-based interface, towards a richer canvas environment. It hasn't been easy! I'll show you all the challenges we've faced, and how we're currently overcoming them. Some of the solutions have been surprising.

If not, your colleague most probably is. Either way, this talk is for you.\n\nIn this session, Katrine will shine a light on neurodiversity and the transformative impact it can have on your life, your team, and your business.\n\nNeurodiversity is not only abundantly prevalent in tech organizations; it is a powerful, often underutilized asset that manifests in every corner of our work environments. It is paramount that we adjust our understanding and strategies around this diversity to thrive. Katrine will explore how neurodiversity shows up in the most unexpected ways and why it’s both surprisingly easy and surprisingly challenging to harness its potential in team collaboration and leadership.\n\nThis talk will emphasize practical daily strategies to strengthen collaboration and leverage the advantages of neurodiversity in everyday work contexts, whether it’s adopting clear communication methods, allowing flexible work arrangements, or designing team workflows that play to diverse cognitive strengths.

We'll discuss the key benefits of using Apache Iceberg tables in your data lake such as schema evolution, ACID transactions, hidden partitioning, time traveling and efficient querying.\n\nNext, we'll dive into how to efficiently stream data from Kafka into Iceberg-based data lakes. Confluent Tableflow will be introduced as a potential solution for streamlining the ingestion of Kafka streams into Iceberg tables within your data lake. A live demo will showcase the seamless integration of Kafka with Iceberg, equipping participants with practical knowledge to enhance their data architectures for powerful real-time analytics.\n\n• The role of Kafka in real-time data streaming\n• Why Apache Iceberg is essential for data lakes and data warehouses\n• Iceberg fundamentals: Core concepts and key features\n• Streaming data from Kafka to Iceberg tables in data lakes\n• Use case: Leveraging Confluent Tableflow to stream Kafka data into data lakes and warehouses [...]\n\nTIMECODES\n00:00 Intro\n01:10 Overview\n02:06 Kafka is the standard for operational data\n03:41 Iceberg for analytical data in data lakes\n04:42 Apache Iceberg\n05:27 Why Iceberg?\n12:24 Structure of an Iceberg table\n16:40 Streaming to data lakes is complicated\n20:47 Tableflow materialize Kafka topics as Iceberg tables\n23:47 Demo\n35:37 Outro\n\nDownload slides and read the full abstract here:\nhttps://gotochgo.com/2024/sessions/3370\n\nRECOMMENDED BOOKS\nKasun Indrasiri &amp; Sriskandarajah Suhothayan • Design Patterns for Cloud Native Applications • https://amzn.to/3szGx0p\nKasun Indrasiri &amp; Danesh Kuruppu • gRPC: Up and Running • https://amzn.to/3sBGBJJ\nKasun Indrasiri &amp; Prabath Siriwardena • Microservices for the Enterprise • https://amzn.to/40FhxkQ\nKasun Indrasiri • Beginning WSO2 ESB • https://amzn.to/3sx9NF0\n\nhttps://bsky.app/profile/gotocon.com\nhttps://twitter.com/GOTOcon\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/company/goto-\nhttps://www.instagram.com/goto_con\nhttps://www.facebook.com/GOTOConferences\n#ApacheKafka #Kafka #ApacheIceberg #Iceberg #AmazonAthena #DataStreaming #DataLake #DataWarehouse #ACIDTransactions #KafkaStreams #Confluent #Tableflow #ConfluentTableflow #KasunIndrasiri\n\nCHANNEL MEMBERSHIP BONUS\nJoin this channel to get early access to videos &amp; other perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCs_tLP3AiwYKwdUHpltJPuA/join\n\nLooking for a unique learning experience?\nAttend the next GOTO conference near you!

They explore the importance of short feedback loops, iterative learning, and adaptability in different phases of product development, as outlined in Beck’s 3X model (Exploration, Expansion, Extraction).\n\nKent introduces radical techniques like Test &amp;&amp; Commit || Revert (TCR) and Limbo, which challenge traditional coding and collaboration practices by emphasizing tiny, safe iterations. The conversation ties in psychological safety, a key factor in high-performing teams, as outlined by Amy C. Edmondson.\n\nKent envisions a future where software development scales in real-time, pushing teams to embrace faster experimentation, responsibility, and continuous learning in a rapidly evolving tech landscape.

I’m sorry, but there isn’t, and I’ll explain why.\n\nOn the other hand, if you were set the task of designing the perfect language, how close could you get, how would you go about it, and what would it look like in the end? We’re going to explore this problem space with a tour along the bleeding edge of modern language design, giving you some insight into what’s already out there, what tradeoffs each new idea comes with, and what sort of tools you might be working with in a future where programming is slightly less awful than it is today.

For a thing we’ve been doing for years, ever since someone said “what if we re-did Solaris zones, but called it Docker instead?” It means building an internal engineering platform for your digital services or data pipelines. It allows you to scale teams up and down, and supercharge their abilities to deliver outcomes.\n\nBut here’s a thing that nobody likes to talk about. It’s easy to totally screw up platform engineering. When that happens, there’s a huge negative impact on your engineering culture, and your teams aren’t able to achieve their goals. So how do you avoid screwing up platform engineering, and if it does happen to you, can you actually fix it?\n\nI’ve spent years in platform leadership roles, building internal engineering platforms at different scaleups and enterprise organizations. I’ve had successes, and I’ve had failures. I’ll cover the following irreversible ways to screw up, and how to start reversing out of them:\n\n• Power tools - teams spend all their time configuring Kafka, Kubernetes, Istio etc., because the platform is based on overpowered tech\n• Technology anarchy - N teams do the same task in N different ways, because the platform has no opinions on tech choices, ways of working, or path to prod\n• Teams as tickets - making teams interact with the platform via tickets\n\nAnd I’ll explain why all of these can be traced back to a scaling problem, the granddaddy screw up of platform engineering - your mindset is platform as a project, not as a product.\n\nTakeaways\n• Platform engineering is about creating an enabler of business value, so your teams can move faster and safer than ever before\n• Avoid using platform engineering power tools e.g. Kafka, Kubernetes, Istio. If you’re using them, start measuring unplanned work and plan to migrate away\n• Avoid being unopinionated on tech stack, ways of working, and path to prod. If you’re doing that, capture your leadership team’s expectations and track team commitments\n• Avoid only interacting with teams through a ticketing system. If you’re stuck there, start collaborating with teams on self-service paved roads\n• The key to platform engineering success is a platform as a product mindset [...]\n\nTIMECODES\n00:00 Intro\n03:36 What is platform engineering?\n05:37 No. 1: Power tools\n18:32 No. 2: Technology anarchy\n31:18 No. 3: Ticketing hell\n40:04 Takeaways\n42:24 Outro\n\nDownload slides and read the full abstract here:\nhttps://gotocph.com/2024/sessions/3235\n\nRECOMMENDED BOOKS\nSteve Smith • Measuring Continuous Delivery • https://leanpub.com/measuringcontinuousdelivery\nSteve Smith &amp; Denise Yu • A Children's A to Z of Continuous Delivery • https://leanpub.com/achildrensatozofcontinuousdelivery\nSteve Smith &amp; Matthew Skelton • Build Quality In • https://leanpub.com/buildqualityin\n\nhttps://bsky.app/profile/gotocon.com\nhttps://twitter.com/GOTOcon\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/company/goto-\nhttps://www.instagram.com/goto_con\nhttps://www.facebook.com/GOTOConferences\n#PlatformEngineering #PlatformLeadership #Kubernetes #ApacheKafka #Istio #TechnologyAnarchy #CICD #SteveSmith\n\nCHANNEL MEMBERSHIP BONUS\nJoin this channel to get early access to videos &amp; other perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCs_tLP3AiwYKwdUHpltJPuA/join\n\nLooking for a unique learning experience?\nAttend the next GOTO conference near you!
