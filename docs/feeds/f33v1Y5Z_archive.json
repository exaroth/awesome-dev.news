Instead, it appears flattened, almost egg-shaped, and that shape closely mirrors the pattern of mysterious gamma rays observed by NASA's Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope... Using powerful supercomputers, [the researchers] recreated how the Milky Way formed, including billions of years of violent collisions and mergers with smaller galaxies. Those violent events, the researchers found, left deep \"fingerprints\" on the way dark matter is distributed in the galactic core.... matching the pattern of gamma-ray emission Fermi has observed, the new study reports... \n\nIf the excess truly arises from dark matter collisions, it would mark the first indirect evidence that weakly interacting massive particles [WIMPs], a leading dark matter candidate, really exist...\n \n\n\"We have run dozens of direct detection experiments around the globe hunting for WIMPS,\" notes\nPhys.org, in an article titled \"The Empty Search for Dark Matter.\"\n\nWe have run dozens of direct detection experiments around the globe hunting for WIMPS ‚Äî dark matter particles in this particular mass range. And they're not all the same kind of experiments. There are also the scintillators, which use a giant vat of liquefied noble gas, like several tons of xenon. They wait for a dark matter particle to strike the xenon and cause it to scintillate, which is a fancy science word for \"sparkle.\" We see the sparkle; we detect dark matter... \n\nThey're just one example of a broader class of dark matter candidates, with delightful names like Q-balls, WIMPzillas, and sterile neutrinos. We've tuned our different experiments to capture different mass ranges or interaction strengths to cover as much of that wide dark matter spectrum as possible. We've even tried to manufacture various kinds of dark matter in our particle collider experiments.\n \nAnd we've found nothing.\n\n","contentLength":2876,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Debian's APT Will Soon Begin Requiring Rust: Debian Ports Need To Adapt Or Be Sunset","url":"https://www.phoronix.com/news/Debian-APT-Will-Require-Rust","date":1762032202,"author":"Michael Larabel","guid":324211,"unread":true,"content":"<article>Debian developer Julian Andres Klode sent out a message on Halloween that may give some Debian Linux users and developers a spook: the APT packaging tool next year will begin requiring a Rust compiler.

Both companies have responded. But the space agency is also asking the broader commercial space industry to detail how they might get the job done more quickly, hinting that NASA leadership is prepared to sideline its current partners. CNN spoke with half a dozen companies about how they plan to respond to NASA's call to action, which the agency will formally issue once the government shutdown ends, according to a source familiar with the matter. \n\nOne possibility is Lockheed Martin...\n\n\nNotably, as a legacy NASA contractor, the company built the $20.4 billion Orion spacecraft that astronauts will ride when they take off from Earth... Now, Lockheed says it can piece together a two-stage lunar lander that uses spare parts harvested from Orion. The company would make use of Space Shuttle-era OMS-E engines ‚Äî which are also used on Orion ‚Äî to serve as the propulsion for an \"ascent stage\" of the lunar lander, providing the thrust for the vehicle to lift off the moon after a mission is completed. But the vehicle also needs a descent stage to get down to the lunar surface in the first place... \n\nOther commercial space companies contacted by CNN ‚Äî including Firefly Aerospace and Northrop Grumman ‚Äî said simply that they were \"ready to support\" NASA in its endeavor to find a faster way to complete the Artemis III mission. They did not confirm whether they would formally respond to the space agency's anticipated request for companies to submit proposals. \n\nThe more important goal, argue some experts, is to pave the way for a permanent lunar base where astronauts can live and work...\n\n[P]erhaps the true winner will be the country that is able to build lasting infrastructure, experts say.\n\"It makes great press fodder to frame this as competition,\" said one space policy source, who was among several that spoke to CNN on the condition of anonymity to discuss controversial issues. \"But this is about the long game and the sustainability.\"\n","contentLength":2287,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"This Week In Techdirt History: October 26th ‚Äì November 1st","url":"https://www.techdirt.com/2025/11/01/this-week-in-techdirt-history-october-26th-november-1st/","date":1762023600,"author":"Leigh Beadon","guid":324152,"unread":true,"content":"","contentLength":0,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Claude Code Can Debug Low-Level Cryptography","url":"https://words.filippo.io/claude-debugging/","date":1762022516,"author":"Bogdanp","guid":324203,"unread":true,"content":"<p>Over the past few days I wrote a new Go implementation of ML-DSA, a post-quantum signature algorithm specified by NIST last summer.

I mostly expected it to flail in some maybe-interesting way, or rule out some issues.</p><p>Instead, it rapidly figured out a fairly complex low-level bug in my implementation of a relatively novel cryptography algorithm. I am sharing this because it made me realize I still don‚Äôt have a good intuition for when to invoke AI tools, and because I think it‚Äôs a fantastic case study for anyone who‚Äôs still skeptical about their usefulness.</p><blockquote><p>Full disclosure: Anthropic gave me a few months of Claude Max for free. They reached out one day and told me they were giving it away to some open source maintainers. Maybe it‚Äôs a ploy to get me hooked so I‚Äôll pay for it when the free coupon expires.

Maybe it would have been clear to anyone more familiar with AI tools that this was a good AI task: a well-scoped issue with failing tests. On the other hand, this is a low-level issue in a fresh implementation of a complex,  algorithm.</p><p>It figured out that I had merged  and  into a single function for using it from Sign, and then reused it from Verify where  already produces the high bits, effectively taking the high bits of w1 twice in Verify.</p><p>Looking at <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/FiloSottile/d019f68db7143493c6a7e9c5fd08e872\">the log</a>, it loaded the implementation into the context and then  figured it out, without any exploratory tool use! After that it wrote itself a cute little test that reimplemented half of verification to confirm the hypothesis, wrote a mediocre fix, and checked the tests pass.</p><p>I <a href=\"https://go-review.googlesource.com/c/go/+/716540/2..3\">threw the fix away</a> and refactored  to take high bits as input, and changed the type of the high bits, which is both clearer and saves a round-trip through Montgomery representation. Still, this 100% saved me a bunch of debugging time.</p><h2>A second synthetic experiment</h2><p>On Monday, I had also finished implementing signing with failing tests. There were two bugs, which I fixed in the following couple evenings.</p><p>I figured these would be an interesting way to validate Claude‚Äôs ability to help find bugs in low-level cryptography code, so I checked out the old version of the change with the bugs (yay Jujutsu!) and kicked off a fresh Claude Code session with this prompt:</p><blockquote><p>I am implementing ML-DSA in the Go standard library, and I just finished implementing signing, but running the tests against a known good test vector it looks like it goes into an infinite loop, probably because it always rejects in the Fiat-Shamir with Aborts loop.</p><p>You can run the tests with ‚Äúbin/go test crypto/internal/fips140/mldsa‚Äù</p><p>You can find the code in src/crypto/internal/fips140/mldsa</p><p>Figure out why it loops forever, and get the tests to pass. ultrathink</p></blockquote><p>It gave up after fixing that bug even if the tests still failed, so I started a fresh session (on the assumption that the context on the wrong constants would do more harm than good investigating an independent bug), and gave it this prompt:</p><blockquote><p>I am implementing ML-DSA in the Go standard library, and I just finished implementing signing, but running the tests against a known good test vector they don‚Äôt match.</p><p>You can run the tests with ‚Äúbin/go test crypto/internal/fips140/mldsa‚Äù</p><p>You can find the code in src/crypto/internal/fips140/mldsa</p><p>Figure out what is going on. ultrathink</p></blockquote><p>It‚Äôs interesting how Claude found the ‚Äúeasier‚Äù bug more difficult. My guess is that maybe the large random-looking outputs of the failing tests did not play well with its attention.</p><p>The fix it proposed was updating only the allocation‚Äôs length and not its capacity, but whatever, the point is finding the bug, and I‚Äôll usually want to throw away the fix and rewrite it myself anyway.</p><p>Three out of three one-shot debugging hits with no help is . Importantly, there is no need to trust the LLM or review its output when its job is just saving me an hour or two by telling me where the bug is, for me to reason about it and fix it.</p><p>As ever, I wish we had better tooling for using LLMs which didn‚Äôt look like chat or autocomplete or ‚Äúmake me a PR.‚Äù For example, how nice would it be if every time tests fail, an LLM agent was kicked off with the task of figuring out why, and only notified us if it did before we fixed it?</p><p>Enjoy the silliest floof.

That discovery in 2006 now appears to have overturned decades of dinosaur dogma about Tyrannosaurus rex, the fearsome giant long thought to be the sole top predator stalking the late Cretaceous. In a paper in the journal Nature, paleontologists Lindsay Zanno and James Napoli conclude that some of the bones from that specimen belong not to a teenage T. rex, but to a fully grown individual of a different tyrannosaur species ‚Äî Nanotyrannus lancensis.... \n\n\nOne of the first of those red flags in the new specimen was the arm bones. They looked completely different than T. rex's puny appendages... \"These are powerful arms with large claws, large hands. They were using them for prey capture.\" Contrast that with T. rex, \"an animal that's a mouth on legs.\" There were additional clues. The animal had fewer tail vertebrae and more teeth than T. rex. Zanno and Napoli considered other lines of evidence. They created 3D models of numerous purported T. rexes against which they compared their specimen. They looked at the growth stages of the cranial nerves and sinuses of close living relatives of dinosaurs, features that were visible in the fossilized skeleton. \n\n\"But maybe the most important and damning thing that we did was we were able to figure out that our animal is not a juvenile at all,\" she says. This conclusion was based on slicing through the fossil's limb bones to examine the growth rings. That work demonstrated that this animal was mature and done growing when it died around the age of 20. \"That means it's half the size and a tenth of the mass of a full grown Tyrannosaurus rex,\" says Zanno... In addition, while making models of all those other alleged T. rex skeletons, Zanno says they identified another new species of tyrannosaur, one they're calling Nanotyrannus lethaeus... \n\n\"It tells us that these end-Cretaceous ecosystems right before the asteroid hit were flourishing,\" says Zanno. \"They had an abundance of different predators.

He stressed that resilience and memory safety, not just performance, are the principal drivers: \"It's the enhanced resilience and safety that is more easily achieved with Rust ports that are most attractive to me\". This move is echoed in Ubuntu's adoption of sudo-rs, the Rust implementation of sudo, with fallback and opt-out mechanisms for users who want to use the old-school sudo command. \n\n\nIn addition to sudo-rs, Ubuntu 26.04 will use the Rust-based uutils/coreutils for Linux's default core utilities. This setup includes ls, cp, mv, and dozens of other basic Unix command-line tools.

The withdrawal by the current  represents yet another chapter in a long-running battle between privacy advocates and lawmakers who believe they can compromise encryption in the name of public safety. While this latest defeat is a victory for digital rights, the fight is far from over, and the <em>fundamental misunderstanding of encryption technology</em> continues to plague policy discussions across Europe.</p><svg viewBox=\"0 0 800 400\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"></svg><h2>A zombie proposal that refuses to die</h2><p>Since its introduction in 2022, Chat Control has become what privacy advocates call a , repeatedly resurrected despite consistent opposition from civil society, technical experts, and the public. The <strong>Electronic Frontier Foundation</strong> and <a href=\"https://www.globalencryption.org/2024/05/joint-statement-on-the-dangers-of-the-may-2024-council-of-the-eu-compromise-proposal-on-eu-csam/\">more than 80 civil society organizations</a> have strongly opposed the legislation, which would mandate client-side scanning of encrypted communications under the guise of combating child sexual abuse material.</p><p>The pattern has become predictable. EU lawmakers introduce the proposal, claiming it includes safeguards for privacy. Technical experts explain why those safeguards are illusory. Public pressure mounts. The proposal is withdrawn or modified. Then, after a brief hiatus, it returns with minor tweaks, and the cycle begins anew. This latest withdrawal by the  follows the same script, but the underlying issues remain unresolved.</p><p>What makes this particularly frustrating is that the fundamental problem with Chat Control has never been addressed. The proposal seeks to create what privacy experts call a ‚Äúbackdoor‚Äù into encryption, allowing authorities to scan messages before they‚Äôre encrypted or after they‚Äôre decrypted. Proponents argue this preserves encryption while enabling content moderation, but this reveals a <em>dangerous misunderstanding</em> of how encryption actually works. Creating any mechanism to access encrypted content inherently weakens the entire system, making it vulnerable not just to authorized access but to malicious actors as well.</p><h2>The technical impossibility of ‚Äúsafe‚Äù scanning</h2><p>The core issue with Chat Control and similar proposals lies in a fundamental misunderstanding of encryption technology. End-to-end encryption works because only the sender and recipient possess the keys to decrypt messages. Any third party, whether a government agency or a tech company, cannot read the contents. This is not a design choice but a mathematical certainty that ensures the security of billions of communications daily.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2019/11/why-adding-client-side-scanning-breaks-end-end-encryption\">Client-side scanning</a>, the technical approach favored by Chat Control advocates, attempts to circumvent this limitation by analyzing messages on users‚Äô devices before encryption or after decryption. While this might sound like a clever workaround, it fundamentally breaks the security model of encryption. If a device can scan and report on message content, so can malware, hackers, or authoritarian governments who might compel tech companies to expand the scope of scanning.</p><p>Security researchers have repeatedly demonstrated that there is <em>no way to create a scanning system</em> that only works for ‚Äúgood guys.‚Äù  learned this lesson the hard way in 2021 when it proposed a similar system for detecting child abuse imagery in iCloud photos. The backlash from security experts was swift and devastating, forcing the company to abandon the plan. The same security vulnerabilities that would enable Chat Control would inevitably be exploited by malicious actors, putting everyone at greater risk.</p><svg viewBox=\"0 0 800 500\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"></svg><p>Moreover, the scope creep inherent in surveillance technologies is well documented. A system initially designed to detect illegal content could easily be expanded to monitor political dissent, religious expression, or any other communication governments deem problematic. <strong>Countries around the world</strong> are watching the EU‚Äôs actions closely. If Chat Control were to pass, it would set a dangerous precedent that authoritarian regimes would eagerly exploit, claiming they‚Äôre simply following Europe‚Äôs lead in implementing ‚Äúreasonable‚Äù content moderation.</p><h2>Public pressure and the power of resistance</h2><p>The withdrawal of Chat Control demonstrates the <em>critical importance of sustained public engagement</em> in technology policy. Unlike previous instances where technical proposals sailed through legislative processes with little public awareness, this fight has been characterized by unprecedented mobilization from civil society organizations, technology companies, security researchers, and ordinary citizens concerned about their digital rights.</p><p>Organizations like the <strong>Electronic Frontier Foundation</strong>, , and numerous national privacy advocacy groups have played a crucial role in educating the public about the risks of Chat Control. Their efforts have included detailed technical explanations, legal analysis, and coordination of opposition campaigns that have reached millions of Europeans. This groundswell of opposition has made it politically toxic for lawmakers to support the proposal, at least in its current form.</p><p>The effectiveness of this resistance offers important lessons for future policy battles. First, technical expertise matters. When security researchers speak with a unified voice about the impossibility of safe backdoors, it becomes harder for politicians to dismiss concerns as alarmist. Second, coalition-building across different sectors strengthens opposition. When <a href=\"https://edri.org/our-work/chat-control-what-is-actually-going-on/\">civil liberties groups</a>, tech companies, and individual users all oppose a policy, it suggests the problems are real and widespread. Third, sustained pressure is essential because, as Chat Control demonstrates, bad proposals rarely die on the first attempt.</p><p>However, this victory should be tempered with realism. The forces pushing for Chat Control have not given up, and the underlying political dynamics that gave rise to the proposal remain unchanged. Politicians face genuine pressure to be seen as ‚Äúdoing something‚Äù about online harms, particularly regarding child safety. Until alternative approaches that don‚Äôt compromise encryption gain political traction, proposals like Chat Control will continue to resurface.</p><h2>The path forward requires education and alternatives</h2><p>The repeated resurrection of Chat Control points to a deeper problem in how technology policy is made. Many lawmakers genuinely believe they can have both strong encryption and government access to encrypted content. This belief persists despite unanimous opposition from the cryptographic community because the political incentives favor appearing tough on crime over understanding complex technical realities.</p><p>Breaking this cycle requires a <em>fundamental shift in how we approach online safety</em>. Rather than seeking technological magic bullets that promise security without trade-offs, policymakers need to invest in solutions that actually work. This includes better funding for law enforcement training and tools that don‚Äôt require breaking encryption, improved international cooperation on criminal investigations, and addressing the root causes of online exploitation through social programs and education.</p><p> also bear responsibility for developing and promoting genuinely privacy-preserving safety features. End-to-end encrypted platforms can implement abuse prevention measures that don‚Äôt involve content scanning, such as metadata analysis, user reporting systems, and account-level restrictions for suspicious behavior. While these approaches may be less comprehensive than mass surveillance, they achieve meaningful safety improvements without the catastrophic privacy trade-offs of backdoors.</p><p>Looking ahead, the privacy community cannot simply celebrate the withdrawal of Chat Control and move on. The next presidency of the EU Council will bring new opportunities for the proposal to resurface in yet another modified form. Sustained vigilance, continued public education, and proactive development of alternative safety measures will be essential. The fight to protect encryption is not a single battle but an ongoing campaign that requires long-term commitment from everyone who values digital privacy and security.</p><p>The withdrawal of Chat Control is a victory, but it‚Äôs a temporary one. The fundamental challenge remains: convincing policymakers that some trade-offs are not worth making, and that breaking encryption to combat illegal content creates far more problems than it solves. Until that message truly sinks in, the zombie proposal will keep rising from the grave, and the privacy community must remain ready to defeat it again and again.</p>","contentLength":8587,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45783114"},{"title":"Did a Weather Balloon, Not a Mysteryious Space Object, Strike That United Airlines Flight?","url":"https://tech.slashdot.org/story/25/11/01/0615237/did-a-weather-balloon-not-a-mysteryious-space-object-strike-that-united-airlines-flight?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&utm_medium=feed","date":1762014840,"author":"EditorDavid","guid":324114,"unread":true,"content":"Slashdot reader joshuark shares this report from SFGate:\n\n\nThe mystery object that struck a plane at 36,000 feet is likely not space debris, as some speculated, but rather a Silicon Valley test project gone wrong... \n\nWindBorne Systems, a Palo Alto startup that uses atmospheric balloons to collect weather data for AI-based forecast models,has come forward to say that they believe they may be responsible for the object that hit the windshield... \"At 6am PT, we sent our preliminary investigation to both NTSB and FAA, and are working with both of them to investigate further,\" [WindBorne's CEO John Dean posted on social media...]\n WindBorne said the company has launched more than 4,000 balloons and that it coordinates with the Federal Aviation Administration for every launch. \n\nWindBorne \"has conducted more than 4,000 launches,\" the company said in a statement, noting that they've always coordinated those launched with America's Federal Aviation Administration and filed aviation alerts for every launched balloon.

Now, these aren‚Äôt ‚Äúcaused‚Äù by AI; I‚Äôm not referring to hoaxes that people have used AI specifically to spread, but things that AI has made worse by the ease with which fake information can be made to look very, very real.</p><p>Fifteen years ago, this problem existed, but in my opinion, was severely muted. The concept of biased news is not new by any means and has been an issue for as long as the news has existed. There have always been audiences that are more susceptible to believing in these invented stories, scenarios, and scams, and the media has always catered to them, guiding them to the water they wish them to drink. </p><p>\\\nMy concern, and reason for this brain dump, is that with AI, these evil parties seem to be able to cast a much wider net than they could before. They can twist real news into something it‚Äôs not with fake videos made by AI; they can pump the internet full of AI-generated content that says whatever they want and cites other AI-generated sources, and they can mobilize an army of influencers that spread their filth like wildfire in an instant.</p><p>\\\nI‚Äôve found that recently, a huge chunk of my time when consuming any form of media is spent asking, ‚ÄúIs this real?‚Äù I consistently have to find multiple sources and manually scan them, looking for clues that it was AI-generated, a task that is getting harder and harder by the week. The videos are getting more realistic, the content is written better, and the sources I'm used to relying on are less and less trustworthy.</p><p>A group of protestors (in this case, trolls) showed up at Chicago‚Äôs Bean with claims that there was a man trapped inside. The protestors claimed that they had found evidence that a wealth of life-support systems had been purchased during the making of the Bean statue, and also attempted to make a connection to a potential missing person (a baby, I believe) around the time of its construction. Trolls exist. They always have and always will. That‚Äôs not the issue at hand here. The issue is what happened next. This group was clearly trying to be funny, just causing a stir with some radical idea for their own amusement, but the internet used AI to take the country by storm.</p><p>\\\nWhile scrolling, I started to see dozens of videos with screenshots of these purchase records, x-ray footage of a person floating inside the Bean, and ‚Äúeyewitness‚Äù reports from someone who claimed they could hear knocking or scratching coming from inside the structure. There were also videos of the Bean being constructed, where you could clearly see the equipment being placed inside. Most, if not all, of these were generated by AI and are completely fake. I knew this, being a sensible human, but I had to admit that the quality created compelling evidence. With less common sense, I would have been easily duped.</p><p>The recent discovery of 3I/ATLAS has been a goldmine for AI generators and the conspiracy-loving masses. From what I could find, which wasn‚Äôt much because it seems a lot of this information is being controlled to stop the spread of disinformation, all we know is that a comet is passing through our solar system. This comet looks like a comet and acts like a comet, but is slightly faster and is not orbiting our sun. One scientist ventured a challenge to the ‚Äúit‚Äôs just a comet‚Äù consensus to encourage more critical thinking, theorizing that it was, of course, possible for it to be an alien craft. This set the AI-loving conspiracy nuts on fire.</p><p>\\\nMy Instagram feed was on absolute fire with fake videos of this comet with lights being emitted from the sides like a ship, with exhaust clearly venting into space, and fake X-ray shots that showed the internal ship structure and beings inside. Countless videos of influencers pretended to be experts on the matter and talked about potential alien invasions. The worst part of all of this was that each one cited different sources and pulled from different video content. It was easy to assume that a ‚Äúpotential alien invasion‚Äù was fake; however, I have to admit, the video content they provided was stunningly believable. The ‚Äúexperts‚Äù talking were confident and had plenty of ‚Äúresearch‚Äù to back them up.</p><p>\\\nThe most alarming thing about this entire situation is how fast this misinformation is able to spread and how absolutely believable it can make it. I know this isn‚Äôt a controlled situation, and we‚Äôve always had irresponsible people running social media accounts to susceptible individuals, but the use of AI in these fields is making the problem more abundant and harder to discern.</p><h2><strong>It‚Äôs not all bad‚Ä¶ but it‚Äôs pretty bad.</strong></h2><p>AI is a wonderful tool that has the potential to make our lives easier. I don‚Äôt believe that it is ready for constant use yet, despite it being shoved down our throats around every turn. It consistently hallucinates and makes false claims; it slows my work down more than it speeds it up, and has become a barrier to productivity in most situations I‚Äôve tried to use it. </p><p>\\\nHowever, I can admit it has potential, and there are small automation tasks that I do find small uses for it. That being said, there‚Äôs always going to be a heated conversation around ethics and how we should be using AI. </p><p>\\\nI don‚Äôt believe there will be any disagreement, however, that the above cases are the wrong way to use AI. The use of AI to generate content to fuel conspiracy theories and spread them to the masses as facts is dangerous and, frankly, terrifying. I believe we‚Äôre only seeing the tip of the iceberg, and I worry that we‚Äôre headed for a future where we‚Äôll no longer be able to discern the difference between truth and fiction.</p>","contentLength":5778,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"The Pearson Correlation Coefficient, Explained Simply","url":"https://towardsdatascience.com/pearson-correlation-coefficient-explained-simply/","date":1762012800,"author":"Nikhil Dasari","guid":324101,"unread":true,"content":"<p>A simple explanation of the Pearson correlation coefficient with examples</p>","contentLength":73,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Security Holes Found in OpenAI's ChatGPT Atlas Browser (and Perplexity's Comet)","url":"https://it.slashdot.org/story/25/11/01/054213/security-holes-found-in-openais-chatgpt-atlas-browser-and-perplexitys-comet?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&utm_medium=feed","date":1762011240,"author":"EditorDavid","guid":324099,"unread":true,"content":"The address bar/ChatGPT input window in OpenAI's browser ChatGPT Atlas \"could be targeted for prompt injection using malicious instructions disguised as links,\" reports SC World, citing a report from AI/agent security platform NeuralTrust:\n\nNeuralTrust found that a malformed URL could be crafted to include a prompt that is treated as plain text by the browser, passing the prompt on to the LLM. A malformation, such as an extra space after the first slash following \"https:\" prevents the browser from recognizing the link as a website to visit. Rather than triggering a web search, as is common when plain text is submitted to a browser's address bar, ChatGPT Atlas treats plain text as ChatGPT prompts by default. \n\nAn unsuspecting user could potentially be tricked into copying and pasting a malformed link, believing they will be sent to a legitimate webpage. An attacker could plant the link behind a \"copy link\" button so that the user might not notice the suspicious text at the end of the link until after it is pasted and submitted. These prompt injections could potentially be used to instruct ChatGPT to open a new tab to a malicious website such as a phishing site, or to tell ChatGPT to take harmful actions in the user's integrated applications or logged-in sites like Google Drive, NeuralTrust said. \n\nLast month browser security platform LayerX also described how malicious prompts could be hidden in URLs (as a parameter) for Perplexity's browser Comet. And last week SquareX Labs demonstrated that a malicious browser extension could spoof Comet's AI sidebar feature and have since replicated the proof-of-concept (PoC) attack on Atlas. \n\n\n\nBut another new vulnerability in ChatGPT Atlas \"could allow malicious actors to inject nefarious instructions into the artificial intelligence (AI)-powered assistant's memory and run arbitrary code,\" reports The Hacker News, citing a report from browser security platform LayerX:\n\n\n\n\"This exploit can allow attackers to infect systems with malicious code, grant themselves access privileges, or deploy malware,\" LayerX Security Co-Founder and CEO, Or Eshed, said in a report shared with The Hacker News. The attack, at its core, leverages a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) flaw that could be exploited to inject malicious instructions into ChatGPT's persistent memory. The corrupted memory can then persist across devices and sessions, permitting an attacker to conduct various actions, including seizing control of a user's account, browser, or connected systems, when a logged-in user attempts to use ChatGPT for legitimate purposes.... \n\n\"What makes this exploit uniquely dangerous is that it targets the AI's persistent memory, not just the browser session,\" Michelle Levy, head of security research at LayerX Security, said. \"By chaining a standard CSRF to a memory write, an attacker can invisibly plant instructions that survive across devices, sessions, and even different browsers. In our tests, once ChatGPT's memory was tainted, subsequent 'normal' prompts could trigger code fetches, privilege escalations, or data exfiltration without tripping meaningful safeguards....\" \n\n\nLayerX said the problem is exacerbated by ChatGPT Atlas' lack of robust anti-phishing controls, the browser security company said, adding it leaves users up to 90% more exposed than traditional browsers like Google Chrome or Microsoft Edge. In tests against over 100 in-the-wild web vulnerabilities and phishing attacks, Edge managed to stop 53% of them, followed by Google Chrome at 47% and Dia at 46%. In contrast, Perplexity's Comet and ChatGPT Atlas stopped only 7% and 5.8% of malicious web pages. \n\nFrom The Conversation:\n\nSandboxing is a security approach designed to keep websites isolated and prevent malicious code from accessing data from other tabs. The modern web depends on this separation. But in Atlas, the AI agent isn't malicious code ‚Äî it's a trusted user with permission to see and act across all sites. This undermines the core principle of browser isolation. \n\n\nThanks to Slashdot reader spatwei for suggesting the topic.","contentLength":4094,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Key not found in data","url":"https://devops.com/key-not-found-in-data-25/","date":1762011154,"author":"","guid":324098,"unread":true,"content":"","contentLength":0,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Key not found in data","url":"https://devops.com/key-not-found-in-data-24/","date":1762011153,"author":"","guid":324097,"unread":true,"content":"","contentLength":0,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Key not found in data","url":"https://devops.com/key-not-found-in-data-23/","date":1762011147,"author":"","guid":324096,"unread":true,"content":"","contentLength":0,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Key not found in data","url":"https://devops.com/key-not-found-in-data-22/","date":1762011146,"author":"","guid":324095,"unread":true,"content":"","contentLength":0,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Key not found in data","url":"https://devops.com/key-not-found-in-data-21/","date":1762011143,"author":"","guid":324094,"unread":true,"content":"","contentLength":0,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Key not found in data","url":"https://devops.com/key-not-found-in-data-20/","date":1762011139,"author":"","guid":324093,"unread":true,"content":"","contentLength":0,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Key not found in data","url":"https://devops.com/key-not-found-in-data-19/","date":1762011138,"author":"","guid":324092,"unread":true,"content":"","contentLength":0,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Key not found in data","url":"https://devops.com/key-not-found-in-data-18/","date":1762011132,"author":"","guid":324091,"unread":true,"content":"","contentLength":0,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Key not found in data","url":"https://devops.com/key-not-found-in-data-17/","date":1762011131,"author":"","guid":324090,"unread":true,"content":"","contentLength":0,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Key not found in data","url":"https://devops.com/key-not-found-in-data-16/","date":1762011130,"author":"","guid":324089,"unread":true,"content":"","contentLength":0,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Beyond Brute Force: 4 Secrets to Smaller, Smarter, and Dramatically Cheaper AI","url":"https://hackernoon.com/beyond-brute-force-4-secrets-to-smaller-smarter-and-dramatically-cheaper-ai?source=rss","date":1762009207,"author":"Anthony Laneau","guid":324138,"unread":true,"content":"<p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are incredibly powerful generalists, but transforming them into specialized experts is a major challenge.

We want smaller, more efficient models that can master a domain without the compute budget of a tech giant.</p><p>\\\nThe core idea behind making smaller models smarter is a concept called \"distillation.\" In this process, a smaller \"student\" model learns from a larger, more capable \"teacher\" model. The student doesn't just learn from a static textbook of examples; it learns to mimic the teacher's thought process. This is a powerful shortcut for transferring expertise.</p><p>\\\nUntil now, however, engineers have faced a frustrating trade-off. One approach, on-policy reinforcement learning (RL), forces the student to learn from its own mistakes, which is relevant but painfully slow. The alternative, off-policy distillation, is much faster but dangerously flawed; the student learns from the teacher's ideal examples, which often occur in contexts the student will never encounter on its own, causing errors to compound. This has been the bottleneck for creating specialized AI; until now.</p><p>\\\nA powerful technique called \"on-policy distillation\" combines the best of both worlds. By having a teacher model provide dense, token-by-token feedback on the student model's own attempts, we can achieve breakthroughs in training efficiency and capability.

To understand this, imagine learning to play chess.</p><ul><li> is like learning chess by only being told if you won or lost at the very end of a match. The feedback is directly related to your actions, but it's sparse. You know you lost, but you don't know if it was because of your opening, a mid-game blunder, or a weak endgame.</li><li> is like watching a grandmaster play. You observe brilliant moves, but they are made in complex board positions that you, as a novice, will rarely find yourself in. The feedback is dense, but the context is often irrelevant to your own learning path.</li><li> provides the best of both worlds. It's like having an expert coach who grades every single one of your moves in your own games, telling you if a move was a \"blunder,\" \"inaccuracy,\" or \"brilliant.\" The feedback is both dense and perfectly relevant to your current skill level.</li></ul><p>\\\nThis smarter feedback loop has a massive impact on efficiency. In a direct back-to-back comparison where a student model learned from a teacher trained via RL, on-policy distillation allowed the student to reach the teacher's performance level 7-10 times faster in terms of gradient steps. This translates to a staggering 50-100x improvement in cumulative compute efficiency.</p><p>\\\nThe reason for this dramatic speedup is that on-policy distillation provides more useful information (more \"bits per episode\") for the model to learn from. Because this dense, token-level feedback reduces gradient noise, it allows for training with shorter contexts and smaller, more efficient batch sizes, further slashing the overall computational cost.</p><h3>You Can Cure ‚ÄúAI Amnesia‚Äù When Teaching New Knowledge</h3><p>A common and frustrating problem in AI is \"catastrophic forgetting.\" When you take a pre-trained model and fine-tune it on new, specialized information (like your company's internal knowledge base), it often degrades or completely forgets its original, general-purpose skills, such as the ability to follow instructions.</p><p>\\\nConsider an experiment to create an \"internal assistant.\" Researchers started with the Qwen3-8B model, which had a strong instruction-following score of 85%. After fine-tuning it on a 70-30 mix of internal company documents and general chat data:</p><ul><li>Its knowledge about the documents improved significantly (from 18% to 36% on a QA evaluation).</li><li>However, its instruction-following skill degraded badly, dropping from 85% down to 79%.</li></ul><p>\\\nThe solution was a brief phase of on-policy distillation after the initial fine-tuning. By using the original version of the model as the teacher, researchers could restore the lost behavior. The results were powerful:</p><ul><li>Instruction-following performance was almost fully recovered, jumping back up to 83%.</li><li>Crucially, this happened without losing the newly acquired knowledge. In fact, the knowledge score even improved slightly to 41%.</li></ul><p>\\\nThis finding is a game-changer for \"continual learning,\" aka the ability to update models with new information over time without having to perform expensive, full-scale retraining from scratch. It provides a reliable way to teach an AI new facts without it forgetting its core skills.</p><h3>An AI Can Master a Reasoning Skill From Just One Example</h3><p>This finding is highly counterintuitive. In most AI training methods, repeatedly training a model on the exact same prompt is a recipe for failure; the model simply memorizes the answer instead of learning the underlying skill.</p><p>\\\nHowever, an experiment with on-policy distillation turned this assumption on its head. Researchers trained a student model on a math reasoning task using only a single, randomly chosen prompt. They trained on this one prompt for 20 consecutive steps, each with a batch of 256 rollouts, generating 5,120 total learning sequences.</p><p>\\\nThe remarkable outcome turns conventional wisdom on its head: the student model was able to approximately match the performance of the expert teacher model on the AIME'24 math benchmark, despite only ever having seen that one problem.</p><p>\\\nThis works because on-policy distillation teaches the model to approximate the teacher's entire thought process; its full probability distribution for what the next best token should be at every step, rather than just memorizing a final answer. This means that for certain skills, the bottleneck isn't finding thousands of examples, but creating a single, perfectly-guided learning experience.</p><h3>Why \"Practicing\" on Its Own Samples Can Make an AI Dumber</h3><p>It seems logical that if a model produces a high-quality output, you could feed that output back into its training data to reinforce good behavior. This method, known as supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on on-policy data, is like having the model \"practice\" on its own best work.</p><p>\\\nBut researchers found the opposite to be true. When they trained a model using a dataset composed of its own samples, its performance on an instruction-following evaluation actually degraded.</p><p>\\\nThe technical reason for this failure is subtle but critical. While the dataset of the model's own outputs might be perfectly on-policy on average, every finite batch of data exhibits a slightly different distribution. Training on these batches causes the model‚Äôs internal policy to drift away from its original state. This process turns training on its own samples into a form of off-policy training over time, leading to the same compounding error and divergence seen in other flawed methods.</p><p>\\\nIn contrast, on-policy distillation is completely stable in this self-distillation scenario. Because the teacher model remains a fixed, consistent target, the student can robustly converge on the desired behavior without degrading. This further cements on-policy distillation as a superior and more reliable tool for behavior refinement and continual learning.</p><h3>The Future of AI is Smaller, Faster, and More Personal</h3><p>On-policy distillation is more than just another training technique; it's a foundational shift in how we create specialized, expert AI. By combining the direct relevance of learning from one's own actions with the incredible efficiency of dense, token-by-token feedback, it solves some of the biggest challenges in applied AI.</p><p>\\\nThe benefits are clear: massive compute savings, a cure for catastrophic forgetting, and unbelievable data efficiency. This is a key enabling technology that lowers the barrier to entry, unlocking the ability for more teams to build and maintain custom models that possess deep domain knowledge without sacrificing core capabilities. This democratization of expert AI will fuel new business models and create competitive advantages previously reserved for frontier labs.</p>","contentLength":8401,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"AI researchers ‚Äôembodied‚Äô an LLM into a robot ‚Äì and it started channeling Robin Williams","url":"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/01/ai-researchers-embodied-an-llm-into-a-robot-and-it-started-channeling-robin-williams/","date":1762009200,"author":"Julie Bort","guid":324111,"unread":true,"content":"<article>AI researchers at Andon Labs embedded various LLMs in a vacuum robot to test how ready they were to be embodied.

By studying these molecules, the researchers created a kind of miniature particle collider. Within this environment, the electrons surrounding the radium atom were confined closely enough to occasionally slip into the nucleus before returning to their usual orbits... When those electrons returned to their outer paths, they retained the altered energy, effectively carrying a \"message\" from within the nucleus that could be decoded to reveal its internal arrangement... \n\n[The researchers] trapped and cooled the molecules and sent them through a system of vacuum chambers, into which they also sent lasers, which interacted with the molecules. In this way, the researchers were able to precisely measure the energies of electrons inside each molecule. When the researchers analyzed their measurements, they noticed that the electrons carried slightly different energies than expected if they had remained outside the nucleus. The difference was incredibly small, only about one millionth of the energy of the laser photon used to excite the molecules, but it was clear evidence that the electrons had entered the radium nucleus and interacted with its protons and neutrons... \n\nThe researchers plan to use this new technique to create a detailed map of how forces are distributed inside the nucleus... to chart the nucleus with greater precision and search for possible violations of fundamental symmetries in nature. \n\n\"It is thought that additional sources of fundamental symmetry violation are required to explain the almost complete absence of antimatter in our universe,\" the article points out. \"Such violations could be seen within the nuclei of certain atoms such as radium... \n\n\n\"Unlike most atomic nuclei, which are spherical in shape, the radium atom's nucleus has a more asymmetrical configuration, similar to a pear.

As software scales, so does the energy it consumes and the emissions it generates.</li><li>This growing footprint forms what many engineers now call carbon debt: the accumulation of energy waste caused by inefficient architecture, redundant compute, or neglected cleanup.</li><li>The problem isn‚Äôt limited to theory anymore. Global data workloads are rising faster than the efficiency gains meant to offset them, and few teams have the tools to measure what their systems actually emit.</li><li>Because engineers control how and where code runs, real progress starts inside development workflows, not in boardrooms.</li><li>As carbon visibility moves closer to the code itself, software projects may soon be judged not only by speed and stability, but by how responsibly they use the power behind them.</li></ul><p>Teams talk about technical debt every sprint. They track code smells, refactoring needs, module complexity, and build bloat. But almost no one tracks the energy drain built into their systems, and this makes that blind spot real.</p><p>\\\nEvery inefficiency in code, like extra loops, redundant database fetches, and idle background tasks, translates into power use. Run thousands or millions of times per day, and what feels trivial becomes measurable emissions. Researchers have begun quantifying this: for example, the <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.07610\">Green Algorithms framework</a> shows that compute time, memory usage, and data center efficiency can be converted into carbon equivalent estimates for any computational task.</p><p>\\\nAt the data center scale, inefficiencies amplify. One white-paper found that servers may draw <a href=\"https://www.nrdc.org/sites/default/files/NRDC_WSP_Cloud_Computing_White_Paper.pdf\">60% to 90%</a> of their peak power even while idle. Multiply that across dozens of servers, and weeks of wasted cycles become dozens of kilograms of CO2 equivalent.</p><p>\\\nEvery product team now operates with an invisible balance sheet, one that records carbon alongside complexity.</p><p>The term carbon debt originates in environmental accounting, where it describes the <a href=\"https://globalclimateinitiatives.com/en/quest-ce-que-la-dette-carbone/\">accumulated emissions</a> a system or entity has ‚Äúborrowed‚Äù against future budgets with insufficient offsets. (It‚Äôs rooted in the broader notion of ecological or climate debt.) Now, technologists are borrowing that phrase to describe software systems whose inefficiencies accrue hidden energy costs over time.</p><p>\\\nIn software, carbon debt grows when layers of redundant code, over-provisioned infrastructure, and heavy frameworks persist unchecked. A module that spawns unnecessary background jobs, or a service that overfetches data, burns CPU cycles, which burn power.</p><p>\\\nWhen infrastructure is sized with generous headroom ‚Äújust in case,‚Äù that slack often stays underutilized, yet still draws baseline power. Servers and services often draw between <a href=\"https://gulfbusiness.com/why-idle-servers-not-ai-are-the-true-sustainability-threat/\">27% and 36%</a> of peak power even under light load.</p><p>\\\nAs your system advances with more users, more services, and more replicas, each inefficiency multiplies. What once was a single wasted cycle becomes thousands per second. That energy waste endures unless addressed, compounding like interest owed on an invisible balance.</p><p>\\\nNext, we‚Äôll trace how code builds up emissions so you can see where the debt really comes from.</p><h2>How Code Accrues Emissions</h2><p>The energy footprint of software often hides in the smallest details of its logic. A loop that runs one step too long or a recursive function that never terminates efficiently can keep processors active far longer than needed. Each extra millisecond of compute draws power, and the effect multiplies when thousands of users trigger the same function at once.</p><h3>How Tiny Loops Turn Into Big Costs</h3><p>Research on mobile software shows that energy code smells can dramatically increase consumption, and in some cases, they can consume up to <a href=\"https://fpalomba.github.io/pdf/Journals/J13.pdf\">87x more energy</a> than clean versions. Follow-up work found that fixing these patterns delivered <a href=\"https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11479295/\">4% to 30%</a> efficiency gains in practice. These results reinforce the broader point: repetitive, seemingly minor patterns accumulate real power draw over time.</p><p>\\\nSimilar waste appears in everyday engineering habits: redundant database queries, unnecessary front-end re-renders, and dormant API endpoints all keep processors active, drawing power without improving performance.</p><p>\\\nOver-sized build artifacts and idle background tasks deepen the impact by holding memory and storage resources active long after they‚Äôre useful. When these patterns run across millions of daily transactions, the emissions scale from grams to kilograms of CO2. Quantifying that footprint is the next challenge, and few teams yet have the tools to do it precisely.</p><h2>Measuring What We Don‚Äôt See</h2><p>Tracking how much energy software really uses is harder than it sounds. The <a href=\"https://sci-guide.greensoftware.foundation/\">Software Carbon Intensity (SCI)</a> framework from the Green Software Foundation is one of the first real attempts to make that measurable, like mapping compute time, memory use, and data transfer against actual energy data.</p><p>\\\nTools such as <a href=\"https://www.cloudcarbonfootprint.org/\">Cloud Carbon Footprint</a> and CodeCarbon are now taking that formula a step further, embedding energy estimates directly into build pipelines and dashboards so developers can see environmental impact alongside performance metrics. This aligns with broader conversations inside the DevOps community, where teams are beginning to explore practical ways to <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/code-green-the-pragmatists-guide-to-eco-friendly-devops\">embed sustainability</a> into build and deployment workflows.</p><p>\\\nThe challenge is translating code execution into physical terms. Every watt drawn depends on processor type, cooling efficiency, and the carbon intensity of the grid that powers the data center. The same workload might have a fraction of the emissions on renewable-heavy infrastructure compared to fossil-fueled grids.</p><p>\\\nThe logic behind these tools isn‚Äôt far from how predictive analytics is being used to expose hidden operational costs in other industries, turning guesswork into measurable insight. Until this kind of visibility becomes standard in developer environments, most teams will keep optimizing performance while staying blind to the energy behind it.</p><h2>The Governance Gap: Why Carbon Isn‚Äôt Yet a Coding Metric</h2><p>Sustainability still sits outside most engineering workflows. In many companies, carbon reporting lives with facilities or operations teams, not with the people writing or deploying code.</p><p>\\\nAs a result, the energy cost of a release is rarely discussed in sprint planning or post-mortems. Agile ceremonies track velocity, story points, and error rates, but not emissions.</p><p>Few DevOps environments include ‚Äúcarbon sprints‚Äù or carbon budgets, even though they could be tracked the same way as uptime or latency. A <a href=\"https://greensoftware.foundation/articles/green-software-foundation-releases-first-ever-state-of-green-software-report\">report</a> based on responses from over <a href=\"https://stateof.greensoftware.foundation/en/methodology/\">2,000 software practitioners</a> has found that most organizations are still in the early stages of measuring software-related emissions. Others echoed this, noting that sustainability metrics remain largely absent from continuous-integration and delivery pipelines.</p><p>\\\nThat gap is beginning to close. Some open-source communities have started experimenting with ‚Äúgreen commits‚Äù to tag energy-efficient changes, and enterprise dashboards are beginning to surface sustainability data next to performance KPIs. As this visibility improves, design priorities are shifting toward decay and restraint by building systems that know when to slow down, scale back, or shut off entirely.</p><h2>Designing for Decay: Making Efficiency a Default</h2><p>Architects concerned with long-lived systems often speak of <a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/smr.2423\">architectural erosion</a> or design decay, like the gradual divergence between intended structure and runtime reality. Architecture erosion is a well-known risk in systems as features accumulate and shortcuts proliferate. One way to counter that drift is to build systems that self-optimize or sunset unused processes automatically, pruning inactive modules or trimming underutilized services based on real usage signals.</p><p>Treating code decay as a feature means embedding routines that perform periodic cleanup: archiving stale APIs, retiring dormant modules, or enforcing dependency hygiene. Frameworks may require that libraries unused for X releases be flagged or removed. Over time, the shift moves from ‚Äúunlimited scaling‚Äù toward sustainable scaling, systems designed to shrink or sleep when load is low rather than running flat out forever.</p><p>\\\nEngineers can use runtime profiling, build monitoring, and garbage-collection heat maps as signals. If a microservice‚Äôs CPU utilization stays near zero for weeks, it raises a refactor or archive flag. If build artifacts grow without change, they are flagged for pruning.</p><p>\\\nThis philosophy sets the stage for what‚Äôs next: making carbon visibility part of everyday decision-making, and bringing engineering metrics and emissions metrics into the same ecosystem.</p><h2>The Road to Carbon Transparency</h2><p>Imagine an IDE where each file, function, or commit carries a live ‚Äúemissions counter‚Äù; you write a loop, and you see how much energy it might cost. That‚Äôs the direction software tooling is heading. Build tools could come to flag carbon-heavy changes before they‚Äôre merged.</p><p>\\\n<a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/379003736_Carbon-Awareness_in_CICD\">CI/CD pipelines</a> will evolve to flag carbon-intensive builds, perhaps even rejecting code that spikes emissions far above baseline. With tighter integration, carbon metrics will merge with performance dashboards, showing build time, throughput, and CO2 cost in one pane.</p><h3>Cloud Dashboards &amp; Deployment Transparency</h3><p>Cloud providers may expose per-deployment carbon cost insights, mapping workload emissions to regions, instance types, and schedules. The same principle underpins the idea of <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/carbon-aware-computing-next-green-breakthrough-or-new-greenwashing\">carbon-aware computing</a>, where workloads shift dynamically to regions or times with cleaner grids. Integrating that into the same console where devs monitor CPU, bandwidth, and billing makes sustainability part of everyday trade-offs.</p><p>\\\nWith visibility in place, engineers will begin to optimize not just for latency or memory, but for carbon as a first-class metric. Those insights will shape budgeting decisions, drive architecture choices (edge, serverless, off-peak scheduling), and enforce sustainable defaults in code.</p><p>\\\nAhead lies a time when your pull request comes with a carbon delta and teams judge changes not only by correctness or performance, but by how much energy they add or save.</p><h2>Engineering Accountability</h2><p>Sustainability in software doesn‚Äôt start in a server farm, but it starts at the keyboard. Every query, commit, and deployment decision shapes the energy profile of the systems we run. For years, efficiency meant speed and uptime, and now it also means restraint.</p><p>\\\nAcross the industry, teams are beginning to treat carbon debt the same way they treat technical debt: as something that compounds if ignored. Cleaning up unused code, right-sizing infrastructure, or pausing idle jobs are no longer side tasks; they‚Äôre acts of maintenance that protect performance and the planet.</p><p>\\\nAs tooling matures, carbon visibility will become part of normal governance, sitting next to reliability and security in every build report. The responsibility won‚Äôt rest with operations alone but with every engineer who touches code. Because in modern software, clean code and clean energy belong to the same conversation, and writing one well means caring about the other.</p>","contentLength":11106,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Go: Can It Mitigate Supply Chain Attacks?","url":"https://hackernoon.com/go-can-it-mitigate-supply-chain-attacks?source=rss","date":1762005611,"author":"Go [Technical Documentation]","guid":324136,"unread":true,"content":"<p>Modern software engineering is collaborative, and based on reusing Open Source software. That exposes targets to supply chain attacks, where software projects are attacked by compromising their dependencies.</p><p>\\\nDespite any process or technical measure, every dependency is unavoidably a trust relationship. However, the Go tooling and design help mitigate risk at various stages.</p><p>There is no way for changes in the outside world‚Äîsuch as a new version of a dependency being published‚Äîto automatically affect a Go build.</p><p>\\\nUnlike most other package managers files, Go modules don‚Äôt have a separate list of constraints and a lock file pinning specific versions. The version of every dependency contributing to any Go build is fully determined by the  file of the main module.</p><p>\\\nSince Go 1.16, this determinism is enforced by default, and build commands (, , , , ‚Ä¶) <a href=\"https://go.dev/ref/mod#go-mod-file-updates\">will fail if the go.mod is incomplete</a>. The only commands that will change the  (and therefore the build) are  and . These commands are not expected to be run automatically or in CI, so changes to dependency trees must be made deliberately and have the opportunity to go through code review.</p><p>\\\nThis is very important for security, because when a CI system or new machine runs , the checked-in source is the ultimate and complete source of truth for what will get built. There is no way for third parties to affect that.</p><p>\\\nMoreover, when a dependency is added with , its transitive dependencies are added at the version specified in the dependency‚Äôs  file, not at their latest versions, thanks to <a href=\"https://go.dev/ref/mod#minimal-version-selection\">Minimal version selection</a>. The same happens for invocations of <code>go install example.com/cmd/devtoolx@latest</code>, <a href=\"https://research.swtch.com/npm-colors\">the equivalents of which in some ecosystems bypass pinning</a>. In Go, the latest version of  will be fetched, but then all the dependencies will be set by its  file.</p><p>\\\nIf a module gets compromised and a new malicious version is published, no one will be affected until they explicitly update that dependency, providing the opportunity to review the changes and time for the ecosystem to detect the event.</p><h2>Version contents never change</h2><p>Another key property necessary to ensure third parties can‚Äôt affect builds is that the contents of a module version are immutable. If an attacker that compromises a dependency could re-upload an existing version, they could automatically compromise all projects that depend on it.</p><p>\\\nThat‚Äôs what the  file is for. It contains a list of cryptographic hashes of each dependency that contributes to the build. Again, an incomplete  causes an error, and only  and  will modify it, so any changes to it will accompany a deliberate dependency change. Other builds are guaranteed to have a full set of checksums.</p><p>\\\nThis is a common feature of most lock files. Go goes beyond it with the <a href=\"https://go.dev/ref/mod#checksum-database\">Checksum Database</a> (sumdb for short), a global append-only cryptographically-verifiable list of go.sum entries. When  needs to add an entry to the  file, it fetches it from the sumdb along with cryptographic proof of the sumdb integrity. This ensures that not only every build of a certain module uses the same dependency contents, but that every module out there uses the same dependency contents!</p><p>\\\nThe sumdb makes it impossible for compromised dependencies or even Google-operated Go infrastructure to target specific dependents with modified (e.g. backdoored) source. You‚Äôre guaranteed to be using the exact same code that everyone else who‚Äôs using e.g. v1.9.2 of  is using and has reviewed.</p><p>\\\nFinally, my favorite features of the sumdb: it doesn‚Äôt require any key management on the part of module authors, and it works seamlessly with the decentralized nature of Go modules.</p><h2>The VCS is the source of truth</h2><p>Most projects are developed through some version control system (VCS) and then, in other ecosystems, uploaded to the package repository. This means there are two accounts that could be compromised, the VCS host and the package repository, the latter of which is used more rarely and more likely to be overlooked. It also means it‚Äôs easier to hide malicious code in the version uploaded to the repository, especially if the source is routinely modified as part of the upload, for example to minimize it.</p><p>\\\nIn Go, there is no such thing as a package repository account. The import path of a package embeds the information that <a href=\"https://pkg.go.dev/cmd/go#hdr-Remote_import_paths\">needs in order to fetch its module</a> directly from the VCS, where tags define versions.</p><p>\\\nWe do have the <a href=\"https://go.dev/blog/module-mirror-launch\">Go Module Mirror</a>, but that‚Äôs only a proxy. Module authors don‚Äôt register an account and don‚Äôt upload versions to the proxy. The proxy uses the same logic that the  tool uses (in fact, the proxy runs ) to fetch and cache a version. Since the Checksum Database guarantees that there can be only one source tree for a given module version, everyone using the proxy will see the same result as everyone bypassing it and fetching directly from the VCS. (If the version is not available anymore in the VCS or if its contents changed, fetching directly will lead to an error, while fetching from the proxy might still work, improving availability and protecting the ecosystem from <a href=\"https://blog.npmjs.org/post/141577284765/kik-left-pad-and-npm\">‚Äúleft-pad‚Äù issues</a>.)</p><p>\\\nRunning VCS tools on the client exposes a pretty large attack surface. That‚Äôs another place the Go Module Mirror helps: the  tool on the proxy runs inside a robust sandbox and is configured to support every VCS tool, while <a href=\"https://go.dev/ref/mod#vcs-govcs\">the default is to only support the two major VCS systems</a> (git and Mercurial). Anyone using the proxy can still fetch code published using off-by-default VCS systems, but attackers can‚Äôt reach that code in most installations.</p><h2>Building code doesn‚Äôt execute it</h2><p>It is an explicit security design goal of the Go toolchain that neither fetching nor building code will let that code execute, even if it is untrusted and malicious. This is different from most other ecosystems, many of which have first-class support for running code at package fetch time. These ‚Äúpost-install‚Äù hooks have been used in the past as the most convenient way to turn a compromised dependency into compromised developer machines, and to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_worm\">worm</a> through module authors.</p><p>\\\nTo be fair, if you‚Äôre fetching some code it‚Äôs often to execute it shortly afterwards, either as part of tests on a developer machine or as part of a binary in production, so lacking post-install hooks is only going to slow down attackers. (There is no security boundary within a build: any package that contributes to a build can define an  function.) However, it can be a meaningful risk mitigation, since you might be executing a binary or testing a package that only uses a subset of the module‚Äôs dependencies. For example, if you build and execute  on macOS there is no way for a Windows-only dependency or a dependency of <code>example.com/cmd/othertool</code> to compromise your machine.</p><p>\\\nIn Go, modules that don‚Äôt contribute code to a specific build have no security impact on it.</p><h2>‚ÄúA little copying is better than a little dependency‚Äù</h2><p>The final and maybe most important software supply chain risk mitigation in the Go ecosystem is the least technical one: Go has a culture of rejecting large dependency trees, and of preferring a bit of copying to adding a new dependency. It goes all the way back to one of the Go proverbs: <a href=\"https://youtube.com/clip/UgkxWCEmMJFW0-TvSMzcMEAHZcpt2FsVXP65\">‚Äúa little copying is better than a little dependency‚Äù</a>. The label ‚Äúzero dependencies‚Äù is proudly worn by high-quality reusable Go modules. If you find yourself in need of a library, you‚Äôre likely to find it will not cause you to take on a dependency on dozens of other modules by other authors and owners.</p><p>\\\nThat‚Äôs enabled also by the rich standard library and additional modules (the  ones), which provide commonly used high-level building blocks such as an HTTP stack, a TLS library, JSON encoding, etc.</p><p>\\\nAll together this means it‚Äôs possible to build rich, complex applications with just a handful of dependencies. No matter how good the tooling is, it can‚Äôt eliminate the risk involved in reusing code, so the strongest mitigation will always be a small dependency tree.</p><p>\\\n<em>This article is available on&nbsp;&nbsp;under a CC BY 4.0 DEED license.</em></p>","contentLength":8072,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Graph RAG vs SQL RAG","url":"https://towardsdatascience.com/graph-rag-vs-sql-rag/","date":1762005600,"author":"Reinhard Sellmair","guid":324050,"unread":true,"content":"<p>Evaluating RAGs on graph and SQL databases</p>","contentLength":42,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"CharlotteOS ‚Äì An Experimental Modern Operating System","url":"https://github.com/charlotte-os/Catten","date":1762002767,"author":"ementally","guid":324140,"unread":true,"content":"","contentLength":0,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45781397"},{"title":"Archinstall 3.0.12 & Pacman 7.1 Released For Arch Linux Users","url":"https://www.phoronix.com/news/Archinstall-3.0.12-Pacman-7.1","date":1762002319,"author":"Michael Larabel","guid":324049,"unread":true,"content":"<article>Kicking off November for Arch Linux users happen to be the releases of Pacman 7.1 as well as Archinstall 3.0.12...</article>","contentLength":114,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"There‚Äôs a Dinosaur ‚ÄòMummy Zone.‚Äô Here‚Äôs What Scientists Found There.","url":"https://www.404media.co/theres-a-dinosaur-mummy-zone-heres-what-scientists-found-there/","date":1762002022,"author":"Becky Ferreira","guid":324023,"unread":true,"content":"<img src=\"https://www.404media.co/content/images/2025/10/image3.jpg\" alt=\"There‚Äôs a Dinosaur ‚ÄòMummy Zone.‚Äô Here‚Äôs What Scientists Found There.\"><p>Welcome back to a special scary installment of the Abstract! Is Halloween over? Technically yes. But as lovers of spooky season will know, the fallout from Halloween‚Äîwhen dawn reveals the remains of the festivities‚Äîis an extension of the day itself. That is why I have assembled a parade of horrors for you this morning.</p><p>First, ancient mummies from a watery grave. Then: : let‚Äôs get tangled up in one of the great mysteries of spider webs; watch out for the venomous snakes; and lastly, scientists literally ask where the bodies are buried.&nbsp;</p><p>And now, Halloween is over but the darkness lingers on‚Ä¶</p><h2><strong>Prepare to enter the ‚Äúmummy zone‚Äù</strong></h2><p>If you think human mummies are scary, wait until you meet dinosaur mummies.&nbsp;</p><p>Paleontologists have discovered the mummified remains of two duck-billed dinosaurs that belong to the species (go Oilers!) , which lived 66 million years ago in what is now Wyoming.&nbsp;</p><p>The immaculate preservation of the animals‚Äîa 2-year-old juvenile and young adult that was roughly 5 to 8 years old‚Äîexposed unprecedented corporeal details, such as intricate polygonal scales, spinal spikes, fleshy contours, skin wrinkles, and the first hooves ever identified in a dinosaur (or any reptile), making them the oldest hooves in the fossil record.</p><p>‚ÄúThe late juvenile is the first subadult dinosaur mummy on record and the first large-bodied dinosaur preserving the fleshy midline over the trunk,‚Äù said researchers led by Paul Sereno of the University of Chicago. ‚ÄúThe early adult is the first hadrosaurid to preserve the entire spike row from hips to tail tip and the first reptile preserving wedge-shaped pedal hooves.‚Äù</p><p>These ‚Äúend-Cretaceous  preserve the oldest hoof renderings for any tetrapod, the first record of hooves in a reptile‚Äù and ‚Äúthe first instance of a hooved tetrapod capable of bipedal locomotion,‚Äù the team added.</p><p>For more than a century, paleontologists have discovered dinosaur mummies in what the team delightfully calls the ‚Äúmummy zone‚Äù of the Lance Formation of east-central Wyoming. In addition to adding new specimens to this collection, Sereno and his colleagues have also shed light on the rare process of ‚Äúclay templating‚Äù that produces this preservation of mummified flesh, skin, and other soft tissues.&nbsp;</p><p>As the carcasses of these Edmontosaurs dried in the Cretaceous sun, they were suddenly immersed under a flash flood that left a thin biofilm over their skin, preserving the three-dimensional soft tissues in time. The team concluded that ‚Äúthe extraordinary preservation of the ‚Äòmummy zone‚Äô is due to rapid subsidence in a coastal setting subject to seasonal drought-flood cycles.‚Äù</p><p>While it‚Äôs sad that these dinos died young, it‚Äôs a miracle that we can observe their flesh, skin, and hooves 66 million years later. Anyway, it‚Äôs not as if they had much to look forward to, since the die was already cast for the non-avian dinosaurs. In this case, the die is an apocalyptic space rock to which we humans owe our existence‚Äîand the reality of these cosmic gambles of fate is frankly scarier than any mummy, even a  mummy, ever could be.</p><h2><strong>Deck the halls with stabilimenta</strong></h2><p>Halloween revelers will be taking down their decorative spider-web today, but real spiders keep their web decor up all year long. Researchers have long struggled to make sense of the silky zigzag ornaments that some spiders weave, known as ‚Äústabilimenta,‚Äù which could serve as insect attractors, predator defense, thermal protection, or water collection. Nobody is really sure!</p><p>Now, a team has suggested that stabilimenta might be vibrational amplifiers that help alert spiders to prey impacting the web. ‚ÄúNo studies have yet investigated how web decorations affect vibration propagation in orb webs,‚Äù said researchers led by Gabriele Greco of the Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences. By studying wasp spiders in Sardinia, the team found that in certain cases, ‚Äùthe presence of the stabilimentum enhances the spider‚Äôs ability to detect prey location‚Ä¶compared to webs without a stabilimentum.‚Äù</p><p>‚ÄúHowever, from a biological standpoint, the high variability in stabilimentum geometry suggests that the observed differences in elastic wave propagation are unlikely to have a consistent or significant functional role,‚Äù the team added.&nbsp;</p><p>In other words, these web decorations still defy a one-size-fits-all explanation. My own hypothesis is that they are just the dorm room posters of the spider world.</p><h2><strong>A new antivenom bites back</strong></h2><p>Though I am a militant <a href=\"https://www.collinsdictionary.com/us/dictionary/english/ophiophilist?ref=404media.co\"></a>, even I can see how a clade of dangerous limbless weirdos ended up becoming so widely feared and maligned. Snakes kill tens of thousands of people per year, an ongoing tragedy that has galvanized researchers to develop antivenom ‚Äúcocktails‚Äù that could treat snakebit emergencies across many species while also mitigating adverse immunological reactions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>A new study has now addressed this challenge ‚Äúby immunizing an alpaca and a llama with the venoms of 18 different snakes, including mambas, cobras and rinkhals,‚Äù said researchers led by Shirin Ahmadi of the Technical University of Denmark.&nbsp;</p><p>The cocktail ‚Äúeffectively prevented venom-induced lethality in vivo across 17 African elapid snake species‚Äù and ‚Äúshows considerable promise for comprehensive, continent-wide protection against snakebites by all medically relevant African elapids,‚Äù the team added.&nbsp;</p><p>While it will take much more research to prove it is safe and effective in humans, the antivenom is a significant step toward preventing snakebite deaths and injuries. It's also about the only cocktail that you hope you‚Äôll never have the desire to order.</p><h2><strong>The more (dead), the merrier</strong></h2><p>We‚Äôll close on that most hallowed of Halloween traditions‚Äîa trip to the haunted cemetery.</p><p>In an unprecedented study, researchers mapped out tens of thousands of ancient Chinese tombs spanning the past 4,000 years since the Xia Dynasty. The team used mapping software to analyze the age and location of the tombs to search for clues about the social and political impacts on burial locations.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>‚ÄúThe number of ancient tombs varied significantly across historical periods‚Äù with the Qing dynasty (1644 - 1912) accounting for 47.012 percent of the national total, while the Sui dynasty (581 - 618) had only 0.134 percent, according to researchers led by Quanbao Ma of the Beijing University of Civil Engineering and Architecture.</p><p>‚ÄúFrom a temporal perspective, periods of frequent dynastic transitions and wars in Chinese history were often accompanied by significant population declines and migrations,‚Äù the team added. ‚ÄúHowever, during post-war recovery and periods of societal stability, population numbers typically rebounded and grew rapidly, which was also reflected in the increasing number of deceased individuals requiring burial.‚Äù</p><p>In other words, contrary to Halloween lore, it can be a good sign to find a lot of dead bodies in one place because it‚Äôs often an indicator of more peaceful and stable times (dead bodies, after all, are the product of living ones). What might be more creepy is an absence of graves in your general vicinity. With that in mind, go visit your local ghosts; they are great company this time of year.</p><p>Thanks for reading!

In this blog post, I will explain how we address these limitations and how developers using SQLite can apply the same solutions.</p><p>This will be a technical blog post intended for developers and everyone wanting to learn about concurrency.</p><p>Also Jellyfin's implementation of locking for SQLite should be fairly easy to be implemented into another EF Core application if you are facing the same issue.</p><p>SQLite is a file-based database engine running within your application and allows you to store data in a relational structure.\nOverall it gives your application the means of storing structured data as a single file and without having to depend on another application to do so.\nNaturally this also comes at a price. If your application fully manages this file, the assumption must be made that your application is the sole owner of this file, and nobody else will tinker with it while you are writing data to it.</p><p>So an application that wants to use SQLite as its database needs to be the only one accessing it.\nHaving established this fact, an important thought arises: if only a single write operation should be performed on a single file at a time, this rule must also apply to operations within the same application.</p><p>SQLite has a feature that tries to get around this limitation: the Write-Ahead-Log (WAL).\nThe WAL is a separate file that acts as a journal of operations that should be applied to an SQLite file.\nThis allows multiple parallel writes to take place and get enqueued into the WAL.\nWhen another part of the application wants to read data, it reads from the actual database, then scans the WAL for modifications and applies them on the fly.\nThis is not a foolproof solution; there are still scenarios where WAL does not prevent locking conflicts.</p><p>A transaction is supposed to ensure two things.\nModifications made within a transaction can be reverted, either when something goes wrong or when the application decides it should and optionally a transaction may also block other readers from reading data that is modified within a transaction.\nThis is where it gets spicy and we come to the real reason why I am writing this blog post.\nFor some reason on some systems that run Jellyfin when a transaction takes place the SQLite engine reports the database is locked and instead of waiting for the transaction to be resolved the engine refuses to wait and just crashes.\nThis seems to be a not uncommon issue and there are many reports to be found on the issue.</p><p>The factor that makes this issue so bad is that it does not happen reliably. So far we only have one team member where this can be (somewhat) reliably be reproduced which makes this an even worse a bug.\nFrom the reports this issue happens across all operating systems, drive speeds and with or without virtualization.\nSo we do not have any deciding factor identified that even contributes to the likelihood of the issue happening.</p><p>Having established the general theory on how SQLite behaves, we also have to look at the specifics of Jellyfins usage of SQLite.\nDuring normal operations on a recommended setup (Non-Networked Storage and preferably SSD) its unusual for any problems to arise, however the way Jellyfin utilises the SQLite db up to 10.11 is very suboptimal.\nIn versions prior to 10.11 Jellyfin had a bug in its parallel task limit which resulted in exponential overscheduling of library scan operations which hammered the database engine with thousands of parallel write requests that an SQLite engine is simply not able to handle.\nWhile most SQLite engine implementations have retry behavior, they also have timeouts and checks in place to prevent limitless waiting so if we stress the engine enough, it just fails with an error.\nThat and very long running and frankly unoptimized transactions could lead to the database just being overloaded with requests and flaking out.</p><p>Since we moved the codebase over to EF Core proper, we have the tools to actually do something about this as EF Core gives us a structured abstraction level.\nEF Core supports a way of hooking into every command execution or transaction by creating <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/logging-events-diagnostics/interceptors\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Interceptors</a>.\nWith an interceptor we can finally do the straight forward idea of just \"not\" writing to the database in parallel in a transparent way to the caller.\nThe overall idea is to have multiple strategies of locking. Because all levels of synchronization will inevitably come at the cost of performance, we only want to do it when it is really necessary.\nSo, I decided on three locking strategies:</p><ol></ol><p>As a default, the no-lock behavior does exactly what the name implies. Nothing. This is the default because my research shows that for 99% all of this is not an issue and every interaction at this level will slow down the whole application.</p><p>Both the optimistic and pessimistic behaviors use two interceptors‚Äîone for transactions and one for commands‚Äîand override  in .</p><h3>Optimistic locking behavior<a href=\"https://jellyfin.org/posts/SQLite-locking/#optimistic-locking-behavior\" aria-label=\"Direct link to Optimistic locking behavior\" title=\"Direct link to Optimistic locking behavior\" translate=\"no\">‚Äã</a></h3><p>Optimistic locking means to assume the operation in question will succeed and only handle issues afterwards. In essence this can be boiled down to \"Try and Retry and Retry ...\" for a set number of times until either we succeed with the operation or fail entirely.\nThis still leaves the possibility that we will not actually be able to perform a write, but the introduced overhead is far less than the Pessimistic locking behavior.</p><p>The idea behind how this works is simple: every time two operations try to write to the database, one will always win. The other will fail, wait some time, then retry a few times.</p><p>Jellyfin uses the  library perform the retry behavior and will only retry operations it will find have been locked due to this exact issue.</p><h3>Pessimistic locking behavior<a href=\"https://jellyfin.org/posts/SQLite-locking/#pessimistic-locking-behavior\" aria-label=\"Direct link to Pessimistic locking behavior\" title=\"Direct link to Pessimistic locking behavior\" translate=\"no\">‚Äã</a></h3><p>Pessimistic locking always locks when a write to SQLite should be performed. Essentially every time an transaction is started or a write operation on the database is done though EF Core, Jellyfin will wait until all other read operations are finished and then block all other operations may they be read or write until the write in question has been performed.\nThis however means, that Jellyfin can only ever perform a single write to the database, even if it would technically does not need to.</p><p>In theory, an application should have no issue reading from table \"Alice\" while writing to table \"Bob\" however to eliminate all possible sources of concurrency related locking, Jellyfin will only ever allow a single write performed on its database in this mode.\nWhile this will absolutely result in the most stable operation, it will undoubtedly also be the slowest.</p><p>Jellyfin uses a <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/fundamentals/runtime-libraries/system-threading-readerwriterlockslim\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">ReaderWriterLockSlim</a> to lock the operations, that means we allow an unlimited number of reads to happen concurrently while only one write may ever be done on the database.</p><h3>The future Smart locking behavior<a href=\"https://jellyfin.org/posts/SQLite-locking/#the-future-smart-locking-behavior\" aria-label=\"Direct link to The future Smart locking behavior\" title=\"Direct link to The future Smart locking behavior\" translate=\"no\">‚Äã</a></h3><p>In the future we might also consider combining both modes, to get the best of both worlds.</p><p>Initial testing showed that with both modes, we had great success in handling the underlying issue. While we are not yet sure why this happens only on some systems when others work, we at least now have an option for users previously left out of using Jellyfin.</p><p>When I was researching this topic, I found many reports all over the internet facing the same error but nobody was able to provide a conclusive explanation whats really happening here.\nThere have been similar proposals made to handle it but there wasn't a \"ready to drop in\" solution that handles all the different cases or only code that required massive modifications to every EF Core query.\nJellyfin's implementation of the locking behaviors should be a copy-paste solution for everyone having the same issues as its using interceptors and the caller has no idea of the actual locking behavior.</p>","contentLength":7955,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45781298"},{"title":"Do you know that there is an HTML tables API?","url":"https://christianheilmann.com/2025/10/08/abandonware-of-the-web-do-you-know-that-there-is-an-html-tables-api/","date":1762001901,"author":"begoon","guid":324064,"unread":true,"content":"<p>When people turn data into  tables using JavaScript, they either use the  methods (createElement() and the likes), but most of the time just append a huge string and use innerHTML, which always is a security concern.

The order is wrong!</p><p>Of course! In the 100m sprint the fastest time wins, and the fastest time is the lowest number. But in the long jump it‚Äôs the longest jump that wins, and that‚Äôs the largest number!</p><p>The  method no longer works for the long jump or for other field events. For field events, the sorting needs to happen in reverse order.</p><p>There are several ways to deal with this problem. There are always several ways to solve a problem in programming.</p><p>The simplest is to add an  Boolean data attribute in  and then add an  statement in . And if this were the only difference between running and field events, this would indeed be a fine option.</p><p>However, if there are more differences to account for, the extra fields and  statements scattered throughout the class make the class harder to maintain.</p><p>So, let‚Äôs look at another option.</p><h2><strong>Creating Separate Classes for Track Events and Field Events</strong></h2><p>You could create two classes instead of one:  and . Each class will take care of getting the  method right and also deal with any other differences we may find between track events and field events.</p><p>However, you don‚Äôt want to create two unrelated classes since these classes will have a lot in common. Sure, you can copy and paste the code that‚Äôs common between the two classes, but you don‚Äôt need me to tell you that‚Äôs not a good idea. Will you remember to make changes in both places when you decide to change the implementation later?</p><p>You also want to make sure they have the same data attribute names for similar things. For example, you don‚Äôt want one class to have  and the other , say, or change the spelling by mistake. Now, I know you‚Äôll pay attention when creating these methods to make sure this doesn‚Äôt happen, but why take the risk?</p><p>And when you come back to your code in six months‚Äô time (or a colleague starts working on the code) and you decide you need another class that follows the same principles, will you remember what methods you need to include? You can spend time studying your old classes, of course. But wouldn‚Äôt you like to make your life a bit simpler? Of course you would.</p><p>However,  shouldn‚Äôt inherit from  since a track event  a field event. The same applies the other way around. These classes are siblings, so they can‚Äôt have a parent-child relationship.</p><p>Instead, they could both inherit from a common parent. So, let‚Äôs keep the  class as a common parent for both  and .</p><p>However, the only purpose of  is to serve as a starting point for the two child classes. You no longer want a user to create instances of  now that you have  and . They should only create instances of  or . How can you make this clear in your code and perhaps even prevent users from creating an instance of the parent class, ?</p><h2><strong>Abstract Base Classes (ABCs)</strong></h2><p>The answer is Abstract Base Classes, often shortened to ABCs. The ABC acronym gives the impression these are as easy as ABC‚Äîthey‚Äôre not, but there‚Äôs no reason they need to be difficult, either. The title of this article is also a reference to a rhyme my children used to sing when they were toddlers learning their ABC!</p><p>Let‚Äôs refresh your memory about different terms often used to describe the inheritance relationship between classes:</p><ul><li><p>You can refer to  and . The child class inherits from the parent class.</p></li><li><p>Or you can refer to  and . The subclass inherits from the superclass. This is where the built-in  gets its name.</p></li><li><p>Or you can refer to  and . The derived class inherits from the base class.</p></li></ul><p>Whatever terms you choose to use, they refer to the same things!</p><p>So, an ABC is a base class, since other classes are derived from it. That deals with the BC in ABC. And it‚Äôs abstract because you‚Äôre never going to create a concrete instance of this class.</p><p>You‚Äôre not meant to create an instance of an abstract base class and often you‚Äôll be prevented from doing so. But you can use it to derive other classes.</p><p>Let‚Äôs turn  into an abstract base class:</p><p>The changes from the previous version are highlighted. Let‚Äôs go through each change:</p><ul><li><p>From the  module‚Äîand now you know what these letters stand for‚Äîyou import  and . You‚Äôll see both of these referred to and explained in the bullets below.</p></li><li><p>When you define the  class, you include  as its base or parent class. When a class inherits from the  class, the class itself becomes an abstract base class. Anyone reading your code will immediately understand the role of this class.</p></li><li><p>You add the  decorator before defining  and you also remove the contents of this method. Since you can‚Äôt leave the body of a function or method blank, you include the  statement as the method‚Äôs body. This method doesn‚Äôt do anything, but it‚Äôs there, and it‚Äôs marked as an abstract method. Let‚Äôs see what this means‚Ä¶</p></li></ul><p>Here‚Äôs what you‚Äôre effectively stating when you create this ABC with the  abstract method: Any class derived from the  ABC  include a  method.</p><p>Let‚Äôs explore this by defining  and . At first, you‚Äôll keep them simple:</p><p>You define the two new classes  and . They inherit from , which is an abstract base class. You just include  as the body of each class for now. This means that these classes inherit everything from the parent class and have no changes or additions. They‚Äôre identical to the parent class.</p><p>Note that you now use  and  to create instances for the 100m race and the long jump.</p><p>However, you get an error when you try to create these instances:</p><pre><code>Traceback (most recent call last):\n  File ... line 53, in &lt;module&gt;\n    track_100m = TrackEvent(\n        ‚Äú100m Sprint‚Äù,\n        [bib_to_athlete[259], bib_to_athlete[161], bib_to_athlete[362]]\n    )\nTypeError: Can‚Äôt instantiate abstract class TrackEvent without\n    an implementation for abstract method ‚Äòfinalise_results‚Äô</code></pre><p>The abstract base class includes the method , which is marked as an abstract method. Python is expecting a concrete implementation of this method. Any class that inherits from the  ABC  have a concrete implementation of this method. Let‚Äôs fix this:</p><p>In , you include the same code you had in the original  since this algorithm works well for track events where the smallest numbers (the fastest times) represent the best performances.</p><p>However, you pass  to  in <code>FieldEvent.finalise_results()</code> since the largest numbers (longest distances) represent the best performances in this case.</p><p>You can now try these new classes on the 100m race results and the long jump results you used earlier:</p><p>You now use the new derived classes  and  in this code instead of . You also add two new printouts to separate the results.</p><pre><code>100m Sprint Results:\nUsain Bolt: 9.58\nCarl Lewis: 9.86\nJesse Owens: 10.3\n‚Äã\nLong Jump Results:\nMike Powell: 8.95\nCarl Lewis: 8.87</code></pre><p>The 100m results show the fastest times (smallest values) as the best performances. The long jump results show the longer jump (larger value) as the best performance. All as it should be!</p><h2><strong>Wind Readings and Breaking Ties</strong></h2><p>But there are more differences we need to account for. In some track and field events, the wind reading matters. In these events, if the wind reading is larger than 2.0 m/s, the results still stand but the performances cannot be used for official records.</p><p>But does this affect track events or field events? So should you account for this in the  class or in the  class?</p><p>It‚Äôs not so simple. Wind readings matter in some track events, but not all. And they also matter in some field events, but not all. So, you have a different subset of events to account for now. The 100m, 200m, 110m hurdles and 100m hurdles, which are all track events, are in the same category as the long jump and triple jump, which are field events.</p><p>But before we find a solution for this, here‚Äôs something else to mess things up even more. What happens when there‚Äôs a tie‚Äîwhen two athletes have the same performance value? The tie-breaking rules also depend on the event. Let‚Äôs ignore the track events here, since depending on what timing system is used, it‚Äôs either the officials who decide or the higher precision times from the automatic timing systems.</p><p>But what about the field events? In most of them, if there‚Äôs a tie, the next best performance is taken into account. However, the rules are different for the high jump and pole vault events where there‚Äôs a count back system used. Explaining the rules of track and field is not the purpose of this article, so I won‚Äôt!</p><p>So that‚Äôs yet another subset to consider: tie breaks in the vertical jumps are different from tie breaks in the horizontal jumps and throws.</p><p>How can we account for all these subsets of events?</p><p>There are always many solutions to the same problem. You can extend the idea of using ABCs to cater for all options. But the Venn diagram of which event falls under which category is a bit complicated in this case.</p><p>The 100m, 200m, 100m hurdles and 110m hurdles are all track events affected by wind readings. But the long jump and triple jump are also affected by wind readings but they‚Äôre field events. The discus and other throw events are field events‚Äîso the longest throw wins‚Äîbut aren‚Äôt affected by high wind readings. And the long jump, triple jump, and the throws have a next-best jump/throw tie-breaking rule. But the pole vault and high jump are field events not affected by the wind but with different tie-breaking rules.</p><p>Are you still with me? Confused? Can you think of an abstract base class structure to account for all these combinations. It‚Äôs not impossible, but you‚Äôll need several layers in the hierarchy.</p><p>Instead, I‚Äôll explore a different route in a second article, which I‚Äôll publish soon!</p><p><em>The follow-up article will be part of</em> The Club  The Python Coding Stack. <em>These are the articles for paid subscribers.

And abstract base classes enable you to organise your hierarchies by creating common base classes for concrete classes you may need to define.</p><p>However, inheritance hierarchies can get quite complex.

But earlier this month, bureaucrats in charge of federal lands scrapped collective approval for the Esmeralda 7 projects, in what campaigners fear is part of an attack on renewable energy under President Donald Trump. \"We will not approve wind or farmer destroying [sic] Solar,\" he posted on his Truth Social platform in August. Developers will need to reapply individually, slowing progress.\n \nThousands of miles away on the other side of the Pacific Ocean, it is a different story. China has laid solar panels across an area the size of Chicago high up on the Tibetan Plateau, where the thin air helps more sunlight get through. The Talatan Solar Park is part of China's push to double its solar and wind generation capacity over the coming decade. \"Green and low-carbon transition is the trend of our time,\" President Xi Jinping told delegates at a UN summit in New York last month. China's vast production of solar panels and batteries has also pushed down the prices of renewables hardware for everyone else, meaning it has \"become very difficult to make any other choice in some places,\" according to Heymi Bahar, senior analyst at the International Energy Agency. [...]\n \nMore broadly, the US's focus on fossil fuels and pullback of support for clean energy further cedes influence over the future global energy system to China. The US is trying to tie its trading partners into fossil fuels, pressing the EU to buy $750 billion of American oil, natural gas, and nuclear technologies during his presidency as part of a trade deal, scuppering an initiative to begin decarbonizing world shipping and pressuring others to reduce their reliance on Chinese technology. But the collapsing cost of solar panels in particular has spoken for itself in many parts of the world. Experts caution that the US's attacks on renewables could cause lasting damage to its competitiveness against China, even if an administration more favorable to renewables were to follow Trump's.","contentLength":2298,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Digest #186: Inside the AWS Outage, Docker Compose in Production, F1 Hacks and 86,000 npm Packages Attacks","url":"https://www.devopsbulletin.com/p/digest-186-inside-the-aws-outage","date":1761989524,"author":"Mohamed Labouardy","guid":323960,"unread":true,"content":"<p>Welcome to this week‚Äôs edition of the DevOps Bulletin!</p><p>A recent 14-hour AWS us-east-1 outage took down 140 services after a DNS race condition in DynamoDB spiraled out of control.

Microsoft released its latest quarterly earnings report and proved the worst of our fears about its gaming brand. Not only are Xbox hardware sales down significantly, but the brand itself is barely treading water. Gamers are voicing their displeasure with their wallets, but Microsoft's top brass is still only thinking about the margins. Microsoft was more keen to promote the scale of its cloud and AI services revenue -- which was up 28% year over year -- than talk about its beleaguered gaming brand. The company's overall gaming revenue fell by 2% compared to the same time last year. This was precipitated by a \"decline in Xbox hardware,\" which was down by 22% following a steady decline quarter after quarter. Its first-party games and its Game Pass subscription were doing better, though the overall growth was only up by 1%, and even that was driven by the \"better-than-expected performance\" of third-party games. You can give credit to titles like Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 for why Xbox isn't in an even deeper hole than it is now.\n \nThe tech giant has no expectation that its Xbox brand will start making more money anytime soon. In its earnings call with investors, Microsoft Chief Financial Officer Amy Hood said the company expects Xbox will continue to decline \"in the low to mid-single digits\" for the following quarter. That's mostly due to the lack of landmark first-party titles. Just this month, Xbox released Ninja Gaiden 4, The Outer Worlds 2, and Double Fine's The Keeper. Xbox also made a huge marketing push for its first handheld, made in partnership with Asus, the ROG Xbox Ally and Ally X. In any other year, this would be a big month for any gaming company. The dour outlook comes after months of bad news. After two subsequent price hikes, Xbox Series S and Series X consoles now cost between $100 to $150 more than they did at launch five years ago. Microsoft also pushed prices of its Game Pass Ultimate subscription tier from $20 to $30 per month. A full-year's subscription would now demand $360. In a separate article, Gizmodo reviews Microsoft's new ROG Xbox Ally X handheld, which \"offers a better experience overall\" than the \"other small-scale Windows PC gaming devices released this year.\" However, \"it's still nowhere close to what you truly want from a console.\"","contentLength":2436,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"The profitable startup","url":"https://linear.app/now/the-profitable-startup","date":1761967084,"author":"doppp","guid":323913,"unread":true,"content":"<p>For years, startups have been taught to prioritize growth over everything else. Profitability was seen as unambitious or even wrong ‚Äì something to worry about when you hit scale. Why focus on profits when money and valuations were easy to come by?</p><p>But that thinking was always flawed.</p><p>Profitability isn't unambitious; it's controlling your own destiny. It means you don't have to rely on investors for survival. It means you can focus on your unaltered vision and mission. And it means you as a founder decide the pace of growth. And once you experience it, it's hard to imagine doing things any other way.</p><p><a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/ramenprofitable.html\">Paul Graham famously wrote about \"ramen profitability\"</a> ‚Äì the point where a founding team could survive without external funding. He argued this made startups more attractive to investors, showing they could get customers to pay, were serious about building valuable products, and were disciplined with expenses.</p><p>Graham wrote his essay in 2009. I‚Äôd argue that we now live in a world where it‚Äôs not just easier to get ramen profitable, but traditionally profitable ‚Äì while also growing fast.</p><p>At Linear we didn't set out to be profitable but kind of stumbled into it. We believed that to win this market we really needed to build a superior tool. The best way we knew how to do that was to keep the team small and focused. And when we launched after a year in private beta, almost all of our 100 beta users converted to paid customers. To our surprise, we realized it wouldn't take that long to become profitable if we kept the costs in check. Twelve months after launch, we hit profitability, and we've stayed profitable ever since.</p><p>I don't know why hiring massive teams ever became the norm. In my own experience, small teams always delivered better quality, and faster. Maybe it's fear of missing out if you don't grow the team fast. Maybe it's investors whispering that your team is \"understaffed compared to benchmarks.\" Being understaffed compared to benchmarks almost always should be a source of pride, not a problem. People should be surprised how small your team is, not how big it is.</p><p>What holds you back is rarely team size ‚Äì it's the clarity of your focus, skill and ability to execute. Larger teams mean slower progress, more management overhead, more meetings, more opinions, and usually dilution of vision and standards. Yet growing the team has somehow become a symbol of success.</p><p>At Linear, we hired our first employee after six months and roughly doubled the team each year. With each hire, we make sure they truly elevate the team. We don't set out to hire ten engineers ‚Äì we hire the next  engineer. This intentional approach has allowed us to maintain both quality and culture.</p><p>The most underrated thing about profitability is how much peace of mind it gives you. Once you're profitable, you stop worrying about survival and focus on what really matters: building something great. Building the way you want. Instead of optimizing for the next fundraising round, you optimize for value creation.</p><p>While profitability might not come quickly for every startup, I believe it's achievable sooner than most think. If you're creating a new market, or truly require massive scale like a social network, or significant upfront investment like a hardware company, it might take longer. But if you're in a category where there isn't hard upfront investment, and you get some level of product-market fit with customers willing to pay, you can probably be profitable. You can decide to become profitable. And usually, it's a decision about how much and how fast you hire.</p><p>Revenue per employee is one of the clearest ways to see you‚Äôre hiring appropriately. While some of the best public companies benchmark at $1-2M per employee, for startups it's not unreasonable to target the range of $500k-$1M per employee.</p><p><strong>Understand Your Risk Profile</strong></p><p>Are you building something highly speculative where you're not sure if there's a market for it, or are you building something that already has a market but with a different take on it? In the former case profitability takes longer, but in the latter it could happen right away. Most software today, especially in the B2B space, is about building a modern version of something existing.</p><p><strong>Hire Intentionally and Slower</strong></p><p>For most software startups, ten people before product-market fit should be your ceiling, not your target. After PMF, every hire should address a specific, pressing need ‚Äì not just fill out an org chart. At Linear, our deliberately slow headcount growth forced us to be selective, which meant making better hires. It also protected our culture, since rapid hiring often dilutes the very things that made your startup special in the first place. When you hire less, you naturally hire better.</p><p>Being profitable doesn't mean you have to be anti-investors. It means you have that choice, and investors are quite interested in profitable companies that also grow fast. You can raise more, less, or nothing. You can wait for the right timing, the right partner, or fund. For most ambitious startups, it can still be a good idea to raise something even if you could get by bootstrapping. Investors can still be helpful, and the additional cash balance can help you to make larger investments, or acquisitions.</p><p>The point is that you can be and are allowed to be profitable as a startup. It's not a bad thing, it's not an oxymoron or as hard as people make it out to be.

Here‚Äôs how to check each of the relevant settings:</p><ul><li><strong>Disable Gemini App Activity</strong>: Gemini App Activity is a history Google stores of all your interactions with Gemini. It‚Äôs enabled by default. To disable it, open Gemini (depending on your phone model, you may or may not even have the Google Gemini app installed. If you don‚Äôt have it installed, you don‚Äôt really need to worry about any of this). Tap your&nbsp;&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;then change the toggle to either ‚ÄúTurn off,‚Äù or ‚ÄúTurn off and delete activity‚Äù if you want to delete previous conversations. If the option reads ‚ÄúTurn on,‚Äù then Gemini Apps Activity is already turned off.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Control app and notification access:&nbsp;</strong>You can control which apps Gemini can access by tapping your&nbsp;&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;, then scrolling down and disabling the toggle next to any apps you do not want Gemini to access. If you do not want Gemini to potentially access the content that appears in notifications, open the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://support.google.com/gemini/answer/15235441#n_permissions&amp;read_messages\">Settings app and revoke notification access</a>&nbsp;from the Google app.</li><li>: Depending on your phone model, you might be able to delete the Gemini app and revert to using Google Assistant instead. You can do so by long-pressing the Gemini app and selecting the option to delete.&nbsp;</li></ul><h4>How to Check and Limit what Apple Intelligence and Siri Can Access</h4><p>Similarly, there are a few things you can do to clamp down on what Apple Intelligence and Siri can do:&nbsp;</p><ul><li><strong>Disable the ‚ÄúUse with Siri Requests‚Äù option</strong>: If you want to continue using Siri, but don‚Äôt want to accidentally use it to send messages through secure messaging apps, like WhatsApp, then you can disable that feature by opening&nbsp;&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;, and disabling ‚ÄúUse with Siri Requests,‚Äù which turns off the ability to compose messages with Siri and send them through that app.</li><li><strong>Disable Apple Intelligence entirely</strong>: Apple Intelligence is an all-or-nothing setting on iPhones, so if you want to avoid any potential issues your only option is to turn it off completely. To do so, open&nbsp;&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;<strong><em>Apple Intelligence &amp; Siri</em></strong>, and disable ‚ÄúApple Intelligence‚Äù (you will only see this option if your device supports Apple Intelligence, if it doesn‚Äôt, the menu will only be for ‚ÄúSiri‚Äù). You can also disable certain features, like ‚Äúwriting tools,‚Äù&nbsp;<a href=\"https://support.apple.com/guide/iphone/block-access-to-apple-intelligence-features-iph3fed3f2c3/ios\">using Screen Time restrictions</a>. Siri can‚Äôt be universally turned off in the same way, though you can turn off the options under ‚ÄúTalk to Siri‚Äù to make it so you can‚Äôt speak to it.&nbsp;</li></ul><p>For more information about cutting off AI access at different levels in other apps,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.consumerreports.org/electronics/artificial-intelligence/turn-off-ai-tools-gemini-apple-intelligence-copilot-and-more-a1156421356/\">this Consumer Reports article</a>&nbsp;covers other platforms and services.</p><h3>Sending Messages Has Different Privacy Concerns than Receiving Them</h3><p>Let‚Äôs start with a look at how Google and Apple integrate their AI systems into message composition, using WhatsApp as an example.</p><h4>Google Gemini and WhatsApp</h4><p>On Android, you can&nbsp;<a href=\"https://support.google.com/gemini/answer/15574928?hl=en\">optionally link WhatsApp and Gemini</a>&nbsp;together so you can then initiate various actions for sending messages from the Gemini app, like ‚ÄúCall Mom on WhatsApp‚Äù or ‚ÄúText Jason on WhatsApp that we need to cancel our secret meeting, but make it a haiku.‚Äù This&nbsp;<a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/07/unless-users-take-action-android-will-let-gemini-access-third-party-apps/\">feature raised red flags</a>&nbsp;for users concerned about privacy.</p><p>By default, everything you do in Gemini is stored in the ‚ÄúGemini Apps Activity,‚Äù where messages are stored forever, subject to human review, and are used to train Google‚Äôs products. So, unless you change it, when you use Gemini to compose and send a message in WhatsApp then the message you composed is visible to Google.</p><p>If you turn the activity off, interactions are still stored for 72 hours.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://support.google.com/gemini/answer/13594961#config_settings\">Google‚Äôs documentation</a>&nbsp;claims that even though messages are stored, those conversations aren‚Äôt reviewed or used to improve Google machine learning technologies, though that appears to be an internal policy choice with no technical limits preventing Google from accessing those messages.</p><p>The simplicity of invoking Gemini to compose and send a message may lead to a false sense of privacy. Notably, other secure messaging apps, like Signal, do not offer this Gemini integration.</p><p>For comparison‚Äôs sake, let‚Äôs see how this works with Apple devices.</p><p>According to its&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/data/en/ask-siri-dictation/\">privacy policy</a>, when you dictate a message through Siri to send to WhatsApp (or anywhere else), the message, including metadata like the recipient phone number and other identifiers, is sent to Apple‚Äôs servers. This was&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.lumia.security/blog/applestorm\">confirmed by researchers</a>&nbsp;to include the text of messages sent to WhatsApp. When you use Siri to compose a WhatsApp message, the message gets routed to both Apple and WhatsApp. Apple claims it does not store this transcript unless you‚Äôve opted into ‚ÄúImprove Siri and Dictation.‚Äù WhatsApp&nbsp;<a href=\"https://faq.whatsapp.com/1803878309981730/?cms_platform=iphone\">defers to Apple‚Äôs support</a>&nbsp;for data handling concerns. This is similar to how Google handles&nbsp;<a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/speech-to-text/docs/data-usage-faq\">speech-to-text prompts</a>.</p><p>In response to that research, Apple said this was expected behavior with an app that uses&nbsp;<a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/documentation/sirikit/\">SiriKit</a>‚Äîthe extension that allows third-party apps to integrate with Siri‚Äîlike WhatsApp does.</p><p>Both Siri and Apple Intelligence can sometimes run locally on-device, and other times need to rely on Apple-managed cloud servers to complete requests. Apple Intelligence can use the company‚Äôs&nbsp;<a href=\"https://security.apple.com/blog/private-cloud-compute/\">Private Cloud Compute</a>, but Siri doesn‚Äôt have a similar feature.</p><p>The ambiguity around where data goes makes it overly difficult to decide on whether you are comfortable with the sort of privacy trade-off that using features like Siri or Apple Intelligence might entail.</p><h3>How Receiving Messages Works</h3><p>Sending encrypted messages is just one half of the privacy puzzle. What happens on the receiving end matters too.&nbsp;</p><p>We could not find anything in&nbsp;<a href=\"https://support.google.com/gemini/answer/15235441?hl=en#zippy=%2Cread-reply-to-messages-in-notifications\">Google‚Äôs Utilities documentation</a>&nbsp;that clarifies what information is collected, stored, or sent to Google from these notifications. When we reached out to Google, the company responded that it ‚Äúbuilds technical data protections that safeguard user data, uses data responsibly, and provides users with tools to control their Gemini experience.‚Äù Which means Google has no technical limitation around accessing the text from notifications if you‚Äôve enabled the feature in the Utilities app. This could open up any notifications routed through the Utilities app to the Gemini app to be accessed internally or from third-parties.&nbsp;Google needs to publicly make its data handling explicit in its documentation.</p><p>Apple is more clear about how it handles this sort of notification access.</p><p>Siri can read and reply to messages with the ‚Äú<a href=\"https://support.apple.com/guide/iphone/have-siri-announce-calls-and-notifications-iph838fd6fd4/ios\">Announce Notifications</a>‚Äù feature. With this enabled, Siri can read notifications out loud on select headphones or via CarPlay. In a press release,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/01/our-longstanding-privacy-commitment-with-siri/\">Apple states</a>, ‚ÄúWhen a user talks or types to Siri, their request is processed on device whenever possible. For example, when a user asks Siri to read unread messages‚Ä¶ the processing is done on the user‚Äôs device. The contents of the messages aren‚Äôt transmitted to Apple servers, because that isn‚Äôt necessary to fulfill the request.‚Äù</p><p>Apple Intelligence can summarize notifications from any app that you‚Äôve enabled notifications on.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/data/en/intelligence-engine/\">Apple is clear</a>&nbsp;that these summaries are generated on your device, ‚Äúwhen Apple Intelligence provides you with preview summaries of your emails, messages, and notifications, these summaries are generated by on-device models.‚Äù This means there should be no risk that the text of notifications from apps like WhatsApp or Signal get sent to Apple‚Äôs servers just to summarize them.</p><h2>New AI Features Must Come With Strong User Controls</h2><p>As more device-makers&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/all-the-new-ai-features-in-google-pixel-10-phones/\">cram AI features into their devices</a>, the more necessary it is for us to have clear and simple controls over what personal data these features can access on our devices. If users do not have control over when a text leaves a device for any sort of AI processing‚Äîwhether that‚Äôs to a ‚Äúprivate‚Äù cloud or not‚Äîit erodes our privacy and potentially threatens the foundations of end-to-end encrypted communications.</p><p>Google, Apple, and other device makers should add a device-level AI permission, just like they do for other potentially invasive privacy features, like location sharing, to their phones. You should be able to tell the operating system‚Äôs AI to not access an app, even if that comes at the ‚Äúcost‚Äù of missing out on some features. The setting should be straightforward and easy to understand in ways the Gemini an Apple Intelligence controls currently are not.</p><h3><strong>Offer On-Device-Only Modes</strong></h3><p>Device-makers should offer an ‚Äúon-device only‚Äù mode for those interested in using some features without having to try to figure out what happens on device or on the cloud.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/phones/samsung-phones/how-to-use-on-device-ai-only-on-samsung-galaxy-s24\">Samsung offers this</a>, and both Google and Apple would benefit from a similar option.</p><p>Both Google and Apple should improve their documentation about how these features interact with various apps. Apple doesn‚Äôt seem to clarify notification processing privacy anywhere outside of a press release, and we couldn‚Äôt find anything about Google‚Äôs Utilities privacy at all. We appreciate tools like Gemini Apps Activity as a way to audit what the company collects, but vague information like ‚ÄúPrompted a Communications query‚Äù is only useful if there‚Äôs an explanation somewhere about what that means.</p><p>The current user options are not enough. It‚Äôs clear that the AI features device-makers add come with significant confusion about their privacy implications, and it‚Äôs time to push back and demand better controls. The privacy problems introduced alongside new AI features should be taken seriously, and remedies should be offered to both users and developers who want real, transparent safeguards over how a company accesses their private data and communications.</p>","contentLength":11551,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"OpenAI Launches Aardvark To Detect and Patch Hidden Bugs In Code","url":"https://it.slashdot.org/story/25/10/31/2314223/openai-launches-aardvark-to-detect-and-patch-hidden-bugs-in-code?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&utm_medium=feed","date":1761963000,"author":"BeauHD","guid":323842,"unread":true,"content":"OpenAI has introduced Aardvark, a GPT-5-powered autonomous agent that scans, reasons about, and patches code like a human security researcher. \"By embedding itself directly into the development pipeline, Aardvark aims to turn security from a post-development concern into a continuous safeguard that evolves with the software itself,\" reports InfoWorld. From the report: What makes Aardvark unique, OpenAI noted, is its combination of reasoning, automation, and verification. Rather than simply highlighting potential vulnerabilities, the agent promises multi-stage analysis -- starting by mapping an entire repository and building a contextual threat model around it. From there, it continuously monitors new commits, checking whether each change introduces risk or violates existing security patterns.\n \nAdditionally, upon identifying a potential issue, Aardvark attempts to validate the exploitability of the finding in a sandboxed environment before flagging it. This validation step could prove transformative. Traditional static analysis tools often overwhelm developers with false alarms -- issues that may look risky but aren't truly exploitable. \"The biggest advantage is that it will reduce false positives significantly,\" noted Jain. \"It's helpful in open source codes and as part of the development pipeline.\"\n \nOnce a vulnerability is confirmed, Aardvark integrates with Codex to propose a patch, then re-analyzes the fix to ensure it doesn't introduce new problems. OpenAI claims that in benchmark tests, the system identified 92 percent of known and synthetically introduced vulnerabilities across test repositories, a promising indication that AI may soon shoulder part of the burden of modern code auditing.","contentLength":1724,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"FCC To Rescind Ruling That Said ISPs Are Required To Secure Their Networks","url":"https://it.slashdot.org/story/25/10/31/237241/fcc-to-rescind-ruling-that-said-isps-are-required-to-secure-their-networks?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&utm_medium=feed","date":1761960600,"author":"BeauHD","guid":323824,"unread":true,"content":"The FCC plans to repeal a Biden-era ruling that required ISPs to secure their networks under the Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act, instead relying on voluntary cybersecurity commitments from telecom providers.

The legislation, approved <a href=\"https://clkrep.lacity.org/onlinedocs/2023/23-0281_CAF_3-24-23.pdf\">unanimously</a>, called specifically for greater fairness in the ‚Äúvulnerability‚Äù scoring system that The Markup analyzed. Used by Los Angeles for the past decade, the system <a href=\"https://themarkup.org/investigation/2023/02/28/l-a-s-scoring-system-for-subsidized-housing-gives-black-and-latino-people-experiencing-homelessness-lower-priority-scores\">rated Black people as significantly less vulnerable</a> than White people year after year, making them less likely to obtain subsidized permanent housing.</p><p>\\\nBlack people are hugely overrepresented among unhoused people in L.A., making up about 9 percent of Los Angeles County‚Äôs population but about 30 percent of the county‚Äôs people experiencing homelessness.</p><p>\\\n‚ÄúTo see that the tool that we‚Äôre using to put people in line for housing was not actually housing unhoused Black Angelenos as quickly as we could was really surprising to me,‚Äù said Raman, who read the article in the Los Angeles Times, where it was <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2023-02-28/black-latino-homeless-people-housing-priority-list-los-angeles\">co-published</a>. Raman, who is currently running for re-election in District Four, in central LA, said the investigation ‚Äúabsolutely‚Äù spurred the council to act.</p><p>\\\nLAHSA, given a deadline of April 2023 in the legislation, still has not provided a reform plan. A spokesperson for the agency didn‚Äôt directly respond to a request for comment about the plan.</p><p>\\\nRaman said LAHSA has taken some steps in the past year to improve how it allocates housing. Among other changes, she said, the agency has started to prioritize some groups, including those already involved in housing programs and those who already have the documents required to move into a building, like an ID and social security number.</p><p>\\\nMeanwhile, the agency <a href=\"https://www.lahsa.org/news?article=936-changes-to-ces-psh-prioritization-and-matching\">also de-emphasized</a> the score‚Äôs importance in placing people for permanent housing. People applying for housing are scored on a 17-point scale. Previously, the people with the highest scores were given the highest priority, but now any person who scores an eight or above can be prioritized, depending on the other factors being considered.</p><p>\\\nStill, equity in the housing system remains a known problem. In November, researchers from the University of Southern California and the University of California Los Angeles, working in partnership with LAHSA, released <a href=\"https://cais.usc.edu/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/CESTTRR-Final-Report-2023.pdf\">a long-awaited study</a> on racial bias in the system and ways to reform the scoring system, known as the VI-SPDAT.</p><p>\\\nThe study, which analyzed scores across race and ethnicity, tracked with The Markup‚Äôs findings from earlier in the year, concluding that the scoring tool is biased toward White people and that it‚Äôs ineffective overall. The study, in some respects, went even further. Using data on who ultimately faced an ‚Äúadverse‚Äù event, like jail or death, the researchers concluded that tool was ‚Äúnot much more accurate than a random guess at predicting vulnerability.‚Äù</p><p>\\\nThe study suggested several ways the scoring system could become more accurate and equitable, some of which matched The Markup‚Äôs reporting. The scoring system asks intensely personal questions about a person‚Äôs life, including around issues like violence and substance abuse, and the report <a href=\"https://cais.usc.edu/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/CESTTRR-Final-Report-2023.pdf#page=89\">recommends rewording and reframing</a> questions to make the survey less complex and more sensitive. A revised version of the system with new questions and scoring could substantially reduce bias, the researchers conclude.</p><p>\\\nFor example, the study suggests that the existing question about whether anyone has ‚Äúforced you or tricked you to do things that you do not want to do‚Äù should be amended to stress that answering yes ‚Äúwill not result in punishment or any negative consequences.‚Äù Another question currently asks, ‚ÄúAre there any medications like painkillers that you don‚Äôt take the way the doctor prescribed or where you sell the medication?‚Äù The study suggested softening it to, ‚ÄúDo you have medication that you choose to sell instead of taking to help support yourself financially? Answering yes to this question will not result in punishment or negative consequences for you.‚Äù Several questions were suggested for removal entirely.</p><p>\\\nIn a written statement, LAHSA spokesperson Christopher Yee acknowledged that it‚Äôs long been clear that ‚Äúthe VI-SPDAT has shortcomings related to equity,‚Äù adding that the survey is ‚Äúlong, cumbersome, and not trauma-informed in the content of the questions or administration process.‚Äù</p><p>\\\nYee highlighted the study on recommended changes to the system and said the agency is ‚Äúworking with key partners and stakeholders to create a plan to implement and refine‚Äù a new iteration of the scoring system while it continues to use the old version.</p><p>\\\nThe agency, he noted, has already dropped a requirement to score people for interim housing entry or time-limited subsidy programs, but will still require scoring for permanent housing. LAHSA must use some sort of prioritization system to access certain federal housing funds under <a href=\"https://www.hud.gov/sites/documents/17-01CPDN.PDF\">rules</a> established by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban development.</p><p>\\\nThe planned changes to the scoring system will first apply to screening for adults, and later the agency plans to explore changes to related tools for young people and families with children. The Markup found that racial disparities were even more stark for a variation of the VI-SPDAT used in Los Angeles for people under the age of 25.</p><p>\\\nYee‚Äôs statement did not provide a timeline for the revised tool‚Äôs launch, but in <a href=\"https://www.lahsa.org/documents?id=7737-cesttrr-report-faq.pdf\">a FAQ</a> released alongside the study LAHSA said service providers could expect more information early this year on changes to the intake process, known as the Coordinated Entry System.</p><p>\\\nRaman, for her part, said she‚Äôs withholding judgment until data can show how those changes affect who is housed. But, she said, ‚Äúthere‚Äôs no question in my mind that CES needs reform.‚Äù</p>","contentLength":6475,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Austria's Ministry of Economy Has Migrated To a Nextcloud Platform In Shift Away From US Tech","url":"https://yro.slashdot.org/story/25/10/31/2023230/austrias-ministry-of-economy-has-migrated-to-a-nextcloud-platform-in-shift-away-from-us-tech?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&utm_medium=feed","date":1761955800,"author":"BeauHD","guid":323792,"unread":true,"content":"An anonymous reader quotes a report from ZDNet: Even before Azure had a global failure this week, Austria's Ministry of Economy had taken a decisive step toward digital sovereignty. The Ministry achieved this status by migrating 1,200 employees to a Nextcloud-based cloud and collaboration platform hosted on Austrian-based infrastructure. This shift away from proprietary, foreign-owned cloud services, such as Microsoft 365, to an open-source, European-based cloud service aligns with a growing trend among European governments and agencies. They want control over sensitive data and to declare their independence from US-based tech providers.\n \nEuropean companies are encouraging this trend. Many of them have joined forces in the newly created non-profit foundation, the EuroStack Initiative. This foundation's goal is \" to organize action, not just talk, around the pillars of the initiative: Buy European, Sell European, Fund European.\" What's the motive behind these moves away from proprietary tech? Well, in Austria's case, Florian Zinnagl, CISO of the Ministry of Economy, Energy, and Tourism (BMWET), explained, \"We carry responsibility for a large amount of sensitive data -- from employees, companies, and citizens. As a public institution, we take this responsibility very seriously. That's why we view it critically to rely on cloud solutions from non-European corporations for processing this information.\"\n \nAustria's move and motivation echo similar efforts in Germany, Denmark, and other EU states and agencies.

Strange attractors - fancy math that creates beautiful patterns. At first I thought I'd just render one and move on, but then soon I realized that this is too much fun. When complexity emerges from three simple equations, when you see something chaotic emerge into beautiful, it's hard not to waste some time. I've spent countless hours, maybe more than I'd care to admit, watching these patterns form. I realized there's something deeply satisfying about seeing order emerge from randomness. Let me show you what kept me hooked.</p><h2><a aria-hidden=\"true\" tabindex=\"-1\" href=\"https://blog.shashanktomar.com/posts/strange-attractors#the-basics-dynamical-systems-and-chaos-theory\"></a>The Basics: Dynamical Systems and Chaos Theory</h2><p>Dynamical Systems are a mathematical way to understand how things . Imagine you have a system, which\ncould be anything from the movement of planets to the growth of a population. In this system, there are rules that\ndetermine how it evolves from one moment to the next. These rules tell you what will happen next based on what is\nhappening now. Some examples are, a pendulum, the weather patterns, a flock of birds, the spread of a virus in a\npopulation (we are all too familiar with this one), and stock market.</p><p>There are two primary things to understand about this system:</p><ul><li>: This is like a big collection of all the possible states the system can be in. Each state is like a\nsnapshot of the system at a specific time. This is also called the  or the .</li><li>: These are the rules that takes one state of the system and moves it to the next state. It can be\nrepresented as a function that transforms the system from now to later.</li></ul><p>For instance, when studying population growth, a phase-space (world-state) might consist of the current population size\nand the rate of growth or decline at a specific time. The dynamics would then be derived from models of population\ndynamics, which, considering factors like birth rates, death rates, and carrying capacity of the environment, dictate\nthe changes in population size over time.</p><p>Another way of saying this is that the dynamical systems describe how things change over time, in a space of\npossibilities, governed by a set of rules. Numerous fields such as biology, physics, economics, and applied mathematics,\nstudy systems like these, focusing on the specific rules that dictate their evolution. These rules are grounded in\nrelevant theories, such as Newtonian mechanics, fluid dynamics, and mathematics of economics, among others.</p><p>There are different ways of classifying dynamical systems, and one of the most interesting is the classification into\nchaotic and non-chaotic systems. The change over time in non-chaotic systems is more deterministic as compared to\nchaotic systems which exhibit randomness and unpredictability.</p><p> is the sub branch of dynamical systems that studies chaotic systems and challenges the traditional\ndeterministic views of causality. Most of the natural systems we observe are chaotic in nature, like the weather, a drop\nof ink dissolving in water, social and economic behaviours etc. In contrast, systems like the movement of planets,\npendulums, and simple harmonic oscillators are extremely predictable and non-chaotic.</p><p>Chaos Theory deals with systems that exhibit irregular and unpredictable behavior over time, even though they follow\ndeterministic rules. Having a set of rules that govern the system, and yet exhibit randomness and unpredictability,\nmight seem a bit contradictory, but it is because the rules do not always represent the whole system. In fact, most of\nthe time, these rules are an approximation of the system and that is what leads to the unpredictability. In complex\nsystems, we do not have enough information to come up with a perfect set of rules. And by using incomplete information\nto make predictions, we introduce uncertainty, which amplifies over time, leading to the chaotic behaviour.</p><p>Chaotic systems generally have many non-linear interacting components, which we partially understand (or can partially\nobserve) and which are very sensitive to small changes. A small change in the initial conditions can lead to a\ncompletely different outcome, a phenomenon known as the . In this post, we will try to see the\nbutterfly effect in action but before that, let's talk about .</p><p>To understand Strange Attractors, let's first understand what an attractor is. As discussed earlier, dynamical systems\nare all about . During this change, the system moves through different possible states (remember the\nphase space jargon?). An attractor is a set of states towards which a system tends to settle over time, or you can say,\ntowards which it is . It's like a magnet that pulls the system towards it.</p><p>For example, think of a pendulum. When you release it, it swings back and forth, but eventually, it comes to rest at the\nbottom. The bottom is the attractor in this case. It's the state towards which the pendulum is attracted.</p><p>This happens due to the system's inherent dynamics, which govern how states in the phase space change. Here are some of\nthe reasons why different states get attracted towards attractors:</p><ul><li>: Attractors are stable states of the system, meaning that once the system reaches them, it tends to stay\nthere. This stability arises from the system's dynamics, which push it towards the attractor and keep it there.</li><li>: Many dynamical systems have dissipative forces, which cause the system to lose energy over time. This\nloss of energy leads the system to settle into a lower-energy state, which often corresponds to an attractor. This is\nwhat happens in the case of the pendulum.</li><li>: In some regions of the phase space, the system's dynamics cause trajectories to converge. This\ncontraction effect means that nearby states will tend to come closer together over time, eventually being drawn\ntowards the attractor.</li></ul><p>Some attractors have complex governing equations that can create unpredictable trajectories or behaviours. These\nnonlinear interactions can result in multiple stable states or periodic orbits, towards which the system evolves. These\ncomplex attractors are categorised as . They are called \"strange\" due to their unique\ncharacteristics.</p><ol><li>: Strange attractors often have a fractal-like structure, meaning they display intricate\npatterns that repeat at different scales. This complexity sets them apart from simpler, regular attractors.</li><li><strong>Sensitive Dependence on Initial Conditions</strong>: Systems with strange attractors are highly sensitive to their initial\nconditions. Small changes in the starting point can lead to vastly different long-term behaviors, a phenomenon known\nas the \"butterfly effect\".</li><li><strong>Unpredictable Trajectories</strong>: The trajectories on a strange attractor never repeat themselves, exhibiting\nnon-periodic motion. The system's behavior appears random and unpredictable, even though it is governed by\ndeterministic rules.</li><li><strong>Emergent Order from Chaos</strong>: Despite their chaotic nature, strange attractors exhibit a form of underlying order.\nPatterns and structures emerge from the seemingly random behavior, revealing the complex dynamics at play.</li></ol><p>You can observe most of these characteristics in the visualisation. The one which is most fascinating to observe is the\nbutterfly effect.</p><blockquote><p>A butterfly can flutter its wings over a flower in China and cause a hurricane in the Caribbean.</p></blockquote><p>One of the defining features of strange attractors is their sensitivity to initial conditions. This means that small\nchanges in the starting state of the system can lead to vastly different long-term behaviors, a phenomenon known as the\n. In chaotic systems, tiny variations in the initial conditions can amplify over time, leading to\ndrastically different outcomes.</p><p>In our visualisation, let's observe this behavior on Thomas Attractor. It is governed by the following equations:</p><p>A small change in the parameter  can lead to vastly different particle trajectories and the overall shape of the\nattractor. Change this value in the control panel and observe the butterfly effect in action.</p><p>There is another way of observing the butterfly effect in this visualisation. Change the  from  to\n in the control panel and observe how the particles move differently in the two cases. The particles\neventually get attracted to the same states but have different trajectories.</p><p>This visualization required rendering a large number of particles using Three.js. To achieve this efficiently, we used a\ntechnique called . This method handles iterative updates of particle systems directly on the GPU,\nminimizing data transfers between the CPU and GPU. It utilizes two frame buffer objects (FBOs) that alternate roles: One\nstores the current state of particles and render them on the screen, while the other calculates the next state.</p><ol><li><p><strong>Setting Up Frame Buffer Objects (FBOs):</strong> We start by creating two FBOs,  and , to hold the current and\nnext state of particles. These buffers store data such as particle positions in RGBA channels, making efficient use\nof GPU resources.</p></li><li><p><strong>Shader Programs for Particle Dynamics:</strong> The shader programs execute on the GPU and apply attractor dynamics to\neach particle. Following is the attractor function which update the particle positions based on the attractor equation.</p></li><li><p><strong>Rendering and Buffer Swapping:</strong> In each frame, the shader computes the new positions based on the attractor's\nequations and stores them in the inactive buffer. After updating, the roles of the FBOs are swapped: The previously\ninactive buffer becomes active, and vice versa.</p></li></ol><p>This combination of efficient shader calculations and the ping-pong technique allows us to render the particle system.</p><p>If you have any comments, please leave them on <strong><a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" href=\"https://github.com/shashanktomar/blog-discussion/discussions/1\">this GitHub discussions topic</a></strong>.
