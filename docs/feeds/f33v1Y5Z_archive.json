The suite has slammed the door shut.\n \nFor years, LibreOffice kept older Windows users afloat while Microsoft and other developers moved on. That lifeline is gone. Anyone stubbornly clinging to Windows 7 or 8 now has two choices: upgrade or stay stuck on outdated software. LibreOffice has made it clear that it will not carry dead platforms any further. And the cuts do not stop there. 32-bit Windows builds are on their way out, with deprecation already in place. On the Mac side, 25.8 is the last release that runs on macOS 10.15.

The catch? These minerals, such as cobalt, lithium, gallium and rare earth elements like neodymium and yttrium, are currently being discarded as tailings of other mineral streams like gold and zinc, said Elizabeth Holley, associate professor of mining engineering at Colorado School of Mines and lead author of the new paper.\n \nTo conduct the analysis, Holley and her team built a database of annual production from federally permitted metal mines in the U.S. They used a statistical resampling technique to pair these data with the geochemical concentrations of critical minerals in ores, recently compiled by the U.S. Geological Survey, Geoscience Australia and the Geologic Survey of Canada. Using this approach, Holley's team was able to estimate the quantities of critical minerals being mined and processed every year at U.S. metal mines but not being recovered. Instead, these valuable minerals are ending up as discarded tailings that must be stored and monitored to prevent environmental contamination.\n \nThe analysis looks at a total of 70 elements used in applications ranging from consumer electronics like cell phones to medical devices to satellites to renewable energy to fighter jets and shows that unrecovered byproducts from other U.S. mines could meet the demand for all but two -- platinum and palladium. Among the elements included in the analysis are:\n- Cobalt (Co): The lustrous bluish-gray metal, a key component in electric car batteries, is a byproduct of nickel and copper mining. Recovering less than 10% of the cobalt currently being mined and processed but not recovered would be more than enough to fuel the entire U.S. battery market.\n- Germanium (Ge): The brittle silvery-white semi-metal used for electronics and infrared optics, including sensors on missiles and defense satellites, is present in zinc and molybdenum mines. If the U.S. recovered less than 1% of the germanium currently mined and processed but not recovered from U.S. mines, it would not have to import any germanium to meet industry needs.","contentLength":2303,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"I'm too dumb for Zig's new IO interface","url":"https://www.openmymind.net/Im-Too-Dumb-For-Zigs-New-IO-Interface/","date":1755931178,"author":"begoon","guid":237240,"unread":true,"content":"<p>You might have heard that Zig 0.15 introduces a new IO interface, with the focus for this release being the new std.Io.Reader and std.Io.Writer types. The old \"interfaces\" had problems. Like <a href=\"https://github.com/ziglang/zig/issues/17985\">this performance issue</a> that I opened. And it relied on a <a href=\"https://www.openmymind.net/In-Zig-Whats-a-Writer/\">mix of types</a>, which always confused me, and a lot of  - which is generally great, but a poor foundation to build an interface on.</p><p>I've been slowly upgrading my libraries, and I ran into changes to the  client used by my smtp library. For the life of me, I just don't understand how it works.</p><p>Zig has never been known for its documentation, but if we look at the documentation for , we'll find:</p><pre><code>input output options InitErrorClient\nInitiates a TLS handshake  establishes a TLSv1 TLSv1 session</code></pre><p>So it takes one of these new Readers and a new Writer, along with some options (sneak peak, which aren't all optional). It doesn't look like you can just give it a , but  does expose a  and  method, so that's probably a good place to start:</p><pre><code> stream  stdnetallocator stream writer  stream reader  stream tls_client  stdcryptotlsClient\n  readerwriterinterface</code></pre><p>Note that  returns a  and  returns a  - those aren't the types our  expects. To convert the  to an , we need to call its  method. To get a  from an , we need the address of its  field. This doesn't seem particularly consistent. Don't forget that the  and  need a stable address. Because I'm trying to get the simplest example working, this isn't an issue - everything will live on the stack of . In a real word example, I think it means that I'll always have to wrap the  into my own heap-allocated type; giving the writer and reader have a cozy stable home.</p><p>Speaking of allocations, you might have noticed that  and  take a parameter. It's the buffer they should use. Buffering is a first class citizen of the new Io interface - who needs composition? The documentation  tell me these need to be at least <code>std.crypto.tls.max_ciphertext_record_len</code> large, so we need to fix things a bit:</p><pre><code> write_buf writer  streamwrite_buf read_buf reader  streamread_buf</code></pre><p>Here's where the code stands: </p><pre><code> std  gpa stdheapinit allocator  gpa stream  stdnetallocator stream write_buf writer  streamwrite_buf read_buf reader  streamread_buf tls_client  stdcryptotlsClient\n      readerwriterinterface tls_client</code></pre><p>But if you try to run it, you'll get a compilation error. Turns out we have to provide 4 options: the ca_bundle, a host, a  and a . Normally I'd expect the options parameter to be for optional parameters, I don't understand why some parameters (input and output) are passed one way while  and  are passed another.</p><p>Let's give it what it wants AND send some data:</p><pre><code> bundle  bundleallocator bundleallocator tls_client  stdcryptotlsClient\n  readerwriterinterfaceca bundle  bundlehost explicit read_buffer write_buffer  tls_client tls_clientwriter</code></pre><p>Now, if I try to run it, the program just hangs.

It has a  a , a  (which seems close, but it blocks until the provided buffer is full), a  and a lot more, but nothing like the  I'd expect. The closest I can find, which I think does what I want, is to stream it to a writer:</p><pre><code> buf wbuf n  tls_clientreaderwbuflen\nstddebugn bufn</code></pre><p>If we try to run the code now, it crashes. We've apparently failed an assertion regarding the length of a buffer.

And maybe it makes sense that we do  but  - I'm reminded of Go's  and . And maybe Zig has some consistent rule for what parameters belong in options. And I know nothing about TLS, so maybe it makes complete sense to need 4 buffers.

Each prompt now consumes about 0.24 watt-hours -- the equivalent of watching nine seconds of TV. An anonymous reader shares an excerpt from an Ars Technica article: \"We estimate the median Gemini Apps text prompt uses 0.24 watt-hours of energy, emits 0.03 grams of carbon dioxide equivalent (gCO2e), and consumes 0.26 milliliters (or about five drops) of water,\" they conclude. To put that in context, they estimate that the energy use is similar to about nine seconds of TV viewing. The bad news is that the volume of requests is undoubtedly very high. The company has chosen to execute an AI operation with every single search request, a compute demand that simply didn't exist a couple of years ago. So, while the individual impact is small, the cumulative cost is likely to be considerable.\n \nThe good news? Just a year ago, it would have been far, far worse. Some of this is just down to circumstances. With the boom in solar power in the US and elsewhere, it has gotten easier for Google to arrange for renewable power. As a result, the carbon emissions per unit of energy consumed saw a 1.4x reduction over the past year. But the biggest wins have been on the software side, where different approaches have led to a 33x reduction in energy consumed per prompt.\n \nThe Google team describes a number of optimizations the company has made that contribute to this. One is an approach termed Mixture-of-Experts, which involves figuring out how to only activate the portion of an AI model needed to handle specific requests, which can drop computational needs by a factor of 10 to 100. They've developed a number of compact versions of their main model, which also reduce the computational load. Data center management also plays a role, as the company can make sure that any active hardware is fully utilized, while allowing the rest to stay in a low-power state.\n \nThe other thing is that Google designs its own custom AI accelerators, and it architects the software that runs on them, allowing it to optimize both sides of the hardware/software divide to operate well with each other. That's especially critical given that activity on the AI accelerators accounts for over half of the total energy use of a query. Google also has lots of experience running efficient data centers that carries over to the experience with AI. The result of all this is that it estimates that the energy consumption of a typical text query has gone down by 33x in the last year alone.","contentLength":2640,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Measuring the environmental impact of AI inference","url":"https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/08/google-says-it-dropped-the-energy-cost-of-ai-queries-by-33x-in-one-year/","date":1755919353,"author":"ksec","guid":237200,"unread":true,"content":"","contentLength":0,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44992832"},{"title":"OK Superintendent Plans To Give Transplant Teachers From NY, CA Woke Tests Developed By Prager U","url":"https://www.techdirt.com/2025/08/22/ok-superintendent-plans-to-give-transplant-teachers-from-ny-ca-woke-tests-developed-by-prager-u/","date":1755916740,"author":"Timothy Geigner","guid":237184,"unread":true,"content":"<p>When the Techdirt community has had to hear so much about a single state’s education superintendent, you know something has gone horribly wrong.

In his role running Oklahoma schools, which rank near the bottom of states in the country, he seems far more interested in <a href=\"https://www.techdirt.com/2024/11/19/ok-state-superintendent-ryan-walters-wants-even-more-bibles-prayers-for-the-dear-leader/\">inserting Christianity</a> anywhere he can into public schools, teaching children his favorite pet election <a href=\"https://www.techdirt.com/2025/07/10/oklahoma-sued-again-for-mandating-students-be-taught-election-conspiracy-theories-bible-stories/\">conspiracy theories</a>, and presiding over board meetings where tame but very strange erotic videos <a href=\"https://www.techdirt.com/2025/07/29/oklahoma-superintendent-bible-thumper-the-curious-case-of-the-board-meeting-pornography/\">sometimes appear</a> on screens.</p><p>Much of this runs afoul of the Constitution and the First Amendment, of course. And I very much wonder if the same might be true of Walters’ latest plan, which is to give transplants from certain states who want to become teachers in Oklahoma a “woke test” that will <a href=\"https://localnews8.com/news/2025/08/15/exclusive-oklahoma-to-begin-controversial-test-to-weed-out-woke-teacher-applicants-today/\">determine if they get a teaching license</a>.</p><blockquote><p><em>Teachers from “liberal” states who have relocated to Oklahoma and are seeking to work there must take a controversial new assessment, to be given for the first time today, that “keeps away woke indoctrinators,” according to Oklahoma’s top education official.</em></p><p><em>Ryan Walters, Oklahoma’s superintendent for public instruction, told CNN that if applicants do not pass the test, they will not earn a teaching certificate to be able to teach in public schools in the state this school year, which begins for some Oklahoma districts on Monday.

Section 1 of the 14th Amendment reads:</p><blockquote><p><em>All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside. No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.</em></p></blockquote><p>I, and others, can certainly argue that these selective tests run afoul of that text. And I imagine someone will try to make that argument or another one, such as First Amendment violations, because this entire plan is buckets of stupid. At the very least, this well-publicized plan to root out the nefarious Marxist teachers from “liberal” states, whatever the fuck that means, apparently hinges on the idea that those same nefarious Marxist teachers won’t simply lie on the test.</p><p>A test that was created by <a href=\"https://www.techdirt.com/company/prageru/\">Prager U</a> of all organizations, mind you. Not the government. Not some scholastic body. Just a fake educational organization that pushes evangelical right-wing propaganda to anyone that will listen. Prager U has its own tortured history of trying to violate the First Amendment on top of its other nonsense.</p><p>What’s in the test? Simple civics stuff, for starters, with just a sprinkle of bigotry on top.</p><blockquote><p><em>One proposed question deals with gender – asking teachers to select from a series of multiple-choice answers which chromosome pairs determine biological sex. Marissa Streit, CEO of PragerU, told CNN there are several questions on the test related to “undoing the damage of gender ideology that is forced and taught through some of these other tests like the PRISM test,” referring to a training for teachers in California that aims to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.cde.ca.gov/ci/pl/prism.asp\">“provide resources to bolster support for LGBTQ+ youth in California.”</a></em></p><p><em>Another question asks why freedom of religion is important to America’s identity. Other questions include asking for the first three words of the Constitution, naming the two chambers of the US Congress, and identifying the number of US Senators.

Conclusions and Further Work</h2><p>This paper presented a controlled experiment that was run as part of a university course in DOE. The aim of the experiment was to evaluate pair versus solo programming with respect to duration and effort. Subjects who jointly wrote the program assignments took less time (28%) than subjects who worked individually. Conversely subjects grouped in pairs spent more effort (30%) than those who worked individually. These results are very close to those reported in [24].</p><p>\\\nWith the aiming of striving towards better research practices in SE [18] we reported all the collected measures. This data will help other researchers to verify or re-analyze [14] the experiment results presented in this work. This data can also be used to accumulate and consolidate a body of knowledge about pair programing.</p><p>\\\nWe are planning to conduct future replications of this experiment to get more insight about the effect of pair programming. Although we did not observe interactions between treatment and blocks, we plan to use another experimental design to assess possible interactions.</p><p>[1] E. Arisholm, H. Gallis, T. Dybå, and D. I.

TechCrunch reports: In a blog post published on Friday, the company explains that, as a small team, it doesn't have the resources to make the substantial technical changes this type of law would require, and it raised concerns about the law's broad scope and privacy implications. Mississippi's HB 1126 requires platforms to introduce age verification for all users before they can access social networks like Bluesky. On Thursday, U.S. Supreme Court justices decided to block an emergency appeal that would have prevented the law from going into effect as the legal challenges it faces played out in the courts. As a result, Bluesky had to decide what it would do about compliance.\n \nInstead of requiring age verification before users could access age-restricted content, this law requires age verification of all users. That means Bluesky would have to verify every user's age and obtain parental consent for anyone under 18. The company notes that the potential penalties for noncompliance are hefty, too -- up to $10,000 per user. Bluesky also stresses that the law goes beyond child safety, as intended, and would create \"significant barriers that limit free speech and disproportionately harm smaller platforms and emerging technologies.\" To comply, Bluesky would have to collect and store sensitive information from all its users, in addition to the detailed tracking of minors. This is different from how it's expected to comply with other age verification laws, like the U.K.'s Online Safety Act (OSA), which only requires age checks for certain content and features.\n \nMississippi's law blocks anyone from using the site unless they provide their personal and sensitive information. The company notes that its decision only applies to the Bluesky app built on the AT Protocol. Other apps may approach the decision differently.","contentLength":1988,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Computer fraud laws used to prosecute leaking air crash footage to CNN","url":"https://www.techdirt.com/2025/08/22/investigators-used-terrible-computer-fraud-laws-to-ensure-people-were-punished-for-leaking-air-crash-footage-to-cnn/","date":1755907496,"author":"BallsInIt","guid":237170,"unread":true,"content":"<h3>from the <i>if-it-can-be-abused,-it-WILL-be-abused</i> dept</h3><p>Earlier this year, an Army helicopter <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_Potomac_River_mid-air_collision\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_Potomac_River_mid-air_collision\">collided with a passenger plane</a> over the Potomac River in Washington, DC. All sixty-seven people aboard both vehicles were killed. While the FAA focused its investigation on the failures that led to this mid-air collision, local investigators in Virginia were somehow far more concerned about identifying who had <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTgUrfQsOnA\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTgUrfQsOnA\">leaked footage of the collision to CNN</a>. </p><p>The subject matter of the leaked recordings was obviously of public interest. And while the government may have its own interest in controlling dissemination of recording of incidents that involve federal agencies and their oversight, it’s not the sort of government interest most courts consider to be worthy of violating the First Amendment.</p><p>Fortunately, the government has options. For a very long time, the option federal law enforcement deployed most frequently in cases involving pretty much any sort of technology was the <a href=\"https://www.techdirt.com/tag/cfaa/\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"https://www.techdirt.com/tag/cfaa/\">Computer Fraud and Abuse Act</a> (CFAA). This <a href=\"https://www.techdirt.com/tag/shoot-the-messenger/\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"https://www.techdirt.com/tag/shoot-the-messenger/\">broadly written law</a> not only allowed prosecutors to charge people with federal crimes for doing nothing more than interacting with services/servers/etc. in unexpected ways, but allowed companies to, essentially, shoot the messengers for reporting data breaches, unsecured servers, or sloppy user interfaces that could be exploited to display far more information than those running them intended.</p><p>Here’s what Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority investigator Patrick Silsbee wrote in his report:</p><blockquote><p><em>“The video shows camera angles and views that can only be found on the Metropolitan Washington Airport’s Authority CCTV video,” Silsbee wrote in a January 31 report, noting the location of landmarks in the videos, including a boathouse near the airfield.</em></p><p><em>The locations of the MWAA security cameras are redacted in the reports provided to The Intercept, ostensibly “to prevent the disclosure of law enforcement and security techniques and procedures not generally known outside the law enforcement community,” according to an accompanying letter from MWAA.</em></p></blockquote><p>That doesn’t mean much by itself, but Silsbee apparently figured out (thanks in part to CNN’s initial failure to redact some CCTV text that described the location of the camera) this footage must have been obtained by an MWAA employee working at the police dispatch center. </p><p>CCTV footage from  the dispatch center was obtained, which allegedly showed these actions being taken by the suspected leaker:</p><blockquote><p><em>“Between the hours of 2256 and 0545, Mr. Mbengue can be seen on multiple occasions utilize [sic] his personal cell phone to record video and photograph these critical scenes,” Silsbee wrote.</em></p></blockquote><p>That would be MWAA dispatch employee Mohamed Mbengue, who has since pleaded “no contest” to charges stemming from Virginia’s ultra-vague <a href=\"https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/18.2-152.4/\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/18.2-152.4/\">“computer trespass” law</a>. But it really takes a person with an overriding desire to shoot messengers to call cell phone recordings of screen images a “trespass.” </p><p>The word is generally understood to describe unauthorized access to an area a person is not allowed to be in. Mbengue was at work and had full access to these recordings as a part of his job. That he recorded them and sent them to CNN doesn’t align with any rational definition of the word “trespass.” The dissemination of footage may be a violation of policy, but policy violations aren’t criminal charges — the sort of thing that can do permanent damage to a person’s life in ways that write-ups and even justified terminations simply can’t.</p><p>That’s why discretion is key. But when discretion matters most, law enforcement tends to deliberately “err” on the side of whatever does the most damage to anyone it happens to be investigating. And it appears MWAA investigators are more than happy to throw criminal charges at people for, at most, violating agency policies. A second dispatcher (Jonathan Savoy) was caught doing the same thing (albeit without sharing the recordings with CNN) and faced similar charges until someone actually exercised a bit of discretion and declined to move forward with the case.</p><blockquote><p><em>On February 3, the MWAA&nbsp;<a href=\"https://x.com/allisonpapson/status/1886553371257266540?s=46&amp;t=p5q6YKIPojSzB8gCMgZMiA\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">announced</a>&nbsp;both men’s arrests, writing in a press statement that Savoy had been arrested “following further police investigation.”</em></p><p><em>In May, however, local prosecutors&nbsp;<a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2025/05/29/charges-dropped-leaked-dc-plane-crash-video/\">quietly dropped</a>&nbsp;the charges against Savoy, through a filing called a “nolle prosequi,” according to the court docket.</em></p></blockquote><p>There’s absolutely nothing in the statute that actually covers the actions described here, which formed the basis for the bullshit criminal charges. It takes a ton of punitive imagination to turn “recording a CCTV monitor with a phone” into a criminal act. The only clause that could be even possibly be considered applicable requires investigators and prosecutors to engage in lot of extremely creative re-interpretations of <a href=\"https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/18.2-152.4/\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/18.2-152.4/\">the plain text of the law</a>: </p><blockquote><p><em>Use a computer or computer network to make or cause to be made an unauthorized copy, in any form, including, but not limited to, any printed or electronic form of computer data, computer programs or computer software residing in, communicated by, or produced by a computer or computer network</em></p></blockquote><p>A smartphone is a computer. A recording could be considered an “unauthorized copy.” To call the CCTV cameras and screens “computers/computer network” means ignoring the generally understood utility of this tech. Even if a network connects the cameras and a computer provides access to recordings, recording playback via phone while accessing footage the suspects <em>had every right to access</em>, calling this a violation of the law demonstrates investigators were out for revenge, rather than serving the commonly understood definition of the word “justice.”</p>","contentLength":5754,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44991542"},{"title":"Links","url":"https://matklad.github.io/2025/08/23/links.html","date":1755907200,"author":"Alex Kladov","guid":237269,"unread":true,"content":"<p>If you have a blog, consider adding a “links” page to it, which references resources that you find\nnotable:</p><p>I’ve started my links page several years ago, mostly because I found myself referring to the same\nfew links repeatedly in various discussions, and not all the links were easily searchable.</p><p>Note that the suggestion is different from more typical “monthly links roundup”, which is nice to\nmaintain Substack engagement/community, but doesn’t contribute to long-term knowledge distilling.</p><p>It is also different from the exhaustive list of everything I’ve read on the Internet.

The $800 device, codenamed Hypernova, will be able to show simple visual content like texts and support AI assistant interactions. CNBC reports: Connect is a two-day conference for developers focused on virtual reality, AR and the metaverse. It was originally called Oculus Connect and obtained its current moniker after Facebook changed its parent company name to Meta in 2021. The glasses are internally codenamed Hypernova and will include a small digital display in the right lens of the device, said the people, who asked not to be named because the details are confidential. The device is expected to cost about $800 and will be sold in partnership with EssilorLuxottica, the people said. CNBC reported in October that Meta was working with Luxottica on consumer glasses with a display. [...]\n \nWith Hypernova, Meta will finally be offering glasses with a display to consumers, but the company is setting low expectations for sales, some of the sources said. That's because the device requires more components than its voice-only predecessors, and will be slightly heavier and thicker, the people said. [...] Although Hypernova will feature a display, those visual features are expected to be limited, people familiar with the matter said. They said the color display will offer about a 20 degree field of view -- meaning it will appear in a small window in a fixed position -- and will be used primarily to relay simple bits of information, such as incoming text messages.\n \nThe Hypernova glasses will also come paired with a wristband that will use technology built by Meta's CTRL Labs, said people familiar with the matter. CTRL Labs, which Meta acquired in 2019, specializes in building neural technology that could allow users to control computing devices using gestures in their arms. [...] In addition to Hypernova and the wristband, Meta will also announce a third-generation of its voice-only smart glasses with Luxottica at Connect, one person said.","contentLength":2143,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Mail Carriers Pause US Deliveries as Tariff Shift Sows Confusion","url":"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-08-21/global-mail-services-halt-us-deliveries-ahead-of-de-minimis-end","date":1755904144,"author":"voxadam","guid":237168,"unread":true,"content":"","contentLength":0,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44991039"},{"title":"Microsoft Reportedly Cuts China's Early Access to Bug Disclosures, PoC Exploit Code","url":"https://it.slashdot.org/story/25/08/22/2059255/microsoft-reportedly-cuts-chinas-early-access-to-bug-disclosures-poc-exploit-code?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&utm_medium=feed","date":1755903600,"author":"BeauHD","guid":237131,"unread":true,"content":"An anonymous reader quotes a report from The Register: Microsoft has reportedly stopped giving Chinese companies proof-of-concept exploit code for soon-to-be-disclosed vulnerabilities following last month's SharePoint zero-day attacks, which appear to be related to a leak in Redmond's early-bug-notification program. The software behemoth gives some software vendors early bug disclosures under its Microsoft Active Protections Program (MAPP), which typically delivers info two weeks before Patch Tuesday. MAPP participants sign a non-disclosure agreement, and in exchange get vulnerability details so that they can provide updated protections to customers more quickly.\n \nAccording to Microsoft spokesperson David Cuddy, who spoke with Bloomberg about changes to the program, MAPP has begun limiting access to companies in \"countries where they're required to report vulnerabilities to their governments,\" including China. Companies in these countries will no longer receive \"proof of concept\" exploit code, but instead will see \"a more general written description\" that Microsoft sends at the same time as patches, Cuddy told the news outlet. \"A leak happened here somewhere,\" Dustin Childs, head of threat awareness at Trend Micro's Zero Day Initiative (ZDI), told The Register in July. \"And now you've got a zero-day exploit in the wild, and worse than that, you've got a zero-day exploit in the wild that bypasses the patch, which came out the next day.\"\n \nChilds said the MAPP change \"is a positive change, if a bit late. Anything Microsoft can do to help prevent leaks while still offering MAPP guidance is welcome.\"\n \n\"In the past, MAPP leaks were associated with companies out of China, so restricting information from flowing to these companies should help,\" Childs said. \"The MAPP program remains a valuable resource for network defenders.

But if we take a closer look at how AI training works, it becomes clear that this isn’t the case at all. AI models don’t simply replicate or repackage creative works—they break them down into something much more abstract: . These tokens are tiny, fragmented pieces of data that no longer represent the creative expression of an idea. And here’s where the distinction lies: copyright is meant to protect , not individual words, phrases, or patterns that make up those works.</p><h2><strong>The Lego Analogy: Breaking Down Creative Works into Tokens</strong></h2><p>Imagine you’re a creator, and your work is like a detailed <strong>Lego model of the Star Wars Millennium Falcon</strong>. It’s intricate, with every piece perfectly assembled to create something unique and valuable. Now imagine that an AI system comes along—not to take your Millennium Falcon and display it as its own creation, but to <strong>break it down into individual Lego blocks</strong>. These blocks are then scattered among millions of others from different sources, and the AI uses them to build entirely new structures—things that look nothing like the Millennium Falcon.</p><p>In this analogy, the  are the  that AI models use. These tokens are fragments of data—tiny bits of information stripped of the original context and creative expression. Just like Lego pieces, tokens are abstract and can be recombined in an infinite number of ways to create something entirely new. The AI doesn’t  your Falcon; it takes the building blocks (tokens) and uses them to create something that’s not a replica of the original but something completely different, like a castle or a spaceship you’ve never seen before.</p><p>This is the key distinction: <strong>AI models aren’t absorbing entire creative works</strong> and reproducing them as their own. They’re learning patterns from vast datasets and using those patterns to generate new content. The tokens no longer reflect the expression of the original work, and thus, they don’t infringe on the creative essence that copyright law is designed to protect.</p><h2><strong>Why Recent Content Matters: AI Needs to Reflect Modern Language and Values</strong></h2><p>There’s another critical point that often gets overlooked: AI models need access to <strong>recent, contemporary content</strong> to be useful, relevant, and ethical. Let’s imagine for a moment what would happen if AI models were restricted to learning only from public domain works, many of which are decades or even centuries old.</p><p>While public domain works are valuable, they often reflect the social norms and biases of their time. If AI models are trained primarily on , there’s a serious risk that they could “speak” in a way that’s <strong>misogynistic, biased, anti-LGBTQ+, or even outright racist</strong>. Many public domain works contain language and ideas that are no longer acceptable in today’s society, and if AI is limited to these sources, it may inadvertently propagate harmful, antiquated views.</p><p>To ensure that AI reflects <strong>current values, inclusive language</strong>, and modern social norms, it needs access to recent content. This means analyzing and learning from today’s books, articles, speeches, and other forms of communication. If creators and copyright holders opt out of allowing their content to be used for AI training, we risk creating models that don’t reflect the diversity, progress, and inclusivity of modern society.</p><p>For example, language evolves quickly—just look at the increased use of  or terms like  in recent years. If AI is cut off from these contemporary linguistic trends, it will struggle to understand and engage with the world as it is today. It would be like asking an AI trained exclusively on Shakespearean English to have a conversation with a 21st-century teenager—it simply wouldn’t work.</p><h2><strong>Article 4 of the EU Directive: Opting Out of Text and Data Mining</strong></h2><p>Let’s bring the <strong>EU Directive on Copyright in the Digital Single Market (DSM)</strong> into the picture. The Directive includes provisions (Article 4) allowing copyright holders to opt out of having their content used in  (TDM). TDM is crucial for training AI models, as it allows them to analyze and learn from large datasets. The opt-out mechanism gives creators and copyright holders the ability to expressly reserve their works from being used for TDM.</p><p>However, it’s important to remember that this opt-out applies to , not just generative AI systems like ChatGPT. This means that by opting out in a broad, blanket manner, creators could inadvertently limit the potential of AI models that have nothing to do with creative industries—tools that are critical for advancements in healthcare, education, and even in day-to-day conveniences that many of us benefit from.</p><h2><strong>The Risk of a Data Winter: Why Broad Opt-Outs Could Harm Innovation</strong></h2><p>What happens if creators and copyright holders across Europe start opting out of TDM on a large scale? The answer is something AI researchers dread: a . Without access to a diverse and rich array of data, AI models will struggle to evolve. This could slow innovation not just in the creative industries, but across the entire economy.</p><p>AI needs high-quality data to function properly. The principle of  applies here: if AI models are starved of diverse input, their output will be flawed, biased, and of lower quality. And while this may not seem like an issue for some industries, it has a ripple effect. Every AI tool we rely on—from  to <strong>medical research applications</strong>—depends on robust training data. Restricting access to this data doesn’t just hinder progress in AI innovation; it stifles  that have far-reaching benefits for society.</p><p>Think about it: many creators themselves probably use AI-driven tools in their daily lives—whether it’s for streamlining workflows, generating new ideas, or even just organizing information. By opting out of TDM, they could inadvertently be damaging the very tools that enhance their own creative processes.</p><h2><strong>The Way Forward: Balance Between Protection and Innovation</strong></h2><p>While copyright is crucial for protecting creators and ensuring fair compensation, it’s equally important not to over-regulate in a way that stifles innovation. AI models aren’t absorbing entire works for free; they’re breaking them down into unrecognizable tokens that enable transformative uses. Rather than opting out of TDM as a knee-jerk reaction, creators should consider the long-term consequences of limiting AI’s potential to innovate and enhance their own industries.</p><p>A balance needs to be struck. Copyright protection should ensure that creators are fairly compensated, but it shouldn’t be wielded as a tool to restrict the very data that drives AI innovation. Creators and policymakers must recognize that AI isn’t the enemy—. And if we’re not careful, we might find ourselves facing a , where the tools we rely on for both convenience and advancement are weakened due to short-sighted decisions.</p><p><em>Caroline De Cock is a communications and policy expert, author, and entrepreneur.

From a report: The CO2 output of the nation's power sector -- its dominant source of emissions -- fell by 3% in the first half of the year, as growth in solar power alone matched the rise in electricity demand. The new analysis for Carbon Brief shows that record solar capacity additions are putting China's CO2 emissions on track to fall across 2025 as a whole. \n\nOther key findings include: \n\nThe growth in clean power generation, some 270 terawatt hours (TWh) excluding hydro, significantly outpaced demand growth of 170TWh in the first half of the year.\nSolar capacity additions set new records due to a rush before a June policy change, with 212 gigawatts (GW) added in the first half of the year.\nThis rush means solar is likely to set an annual record for growth in 2025, becoming China's single-largest source of clean power generation in the process.\nCoal-power capacity could surge by as much as 80-100GW this year, potentially setting a new annual record, even as coal-fired electricity generation declines.\nThe use of coal to make synthetic fuels and chemicals is growing rapidly, climbing 20% in the first half of the year and helping add 3% to China's CO2 since 2020.\nThe coal-chemical industry is planning further expansion, which could add another 2% to China's CO2 by 2029, making the 2030 deadline for peaking harder to meet.","contentLength":1516,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"I can't even with these company names...","url":"https://www.youtube.com/shorts/UBnfA9s3OuE","date":1755897951,"author":"Jeff Geerling","guid":237111,"unread":true,"content":"<article>Seriously...

And while the government may have its own interest in controlling dissemination of recording of incidents that involve federal agencies and their oversight, it’s not the sort of government interest most courts consider to be worthy of violating the First Amendment.</p><p>Fortunately, the government has options. For a very long time, the option federal law enforcement deployed most frequently in cases involving pretty much any sort of technology was the <a href=\"https://www.techdirt.com/tag/cfaa/\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"https://www.techdirt.com/tag/cfaa/\">Computer Fraud and Abuse Act</a> (CFAA). This <a href=\"https://www.techdirt.com/tag/shoot-the-messenger/\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"https://www.techdirt.com/tag/shoot-the-messenger/\">broadly written law</a> not only allowed prosecutors to charge people with federal crimes for doing nothing more than interacting with services/servers/etc. in unexpected ways, but allowed companies to, essentially, shoot the messengers for reporting data breaches, unsecured servers, or sloppy user interfaces that could be exploited to display far more information than those running them intended.</p><p>Here’s what Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority investigator Patrick Silsbee wrote in his report:</p><blockquote><p><em>“The video shows camera angles and views that can only be found on the Metropolitan Washington Airport’s Authority CCTV video,” Silsbee wrote in a January 31 report, noting the location of landmarks in the videos, including a boathouse near the airfield.</em></p><p><em>The locations of the MWAA security cameras are redacted in the reports provided to The Intercept, ostensibly “to prevent the disclosure of law enforcement and security techniques and procedures not generally known outside the law enforcement community,” according to an accompanying letter from MWAA.</em></p></blockquote><p>That doesn’t mean much by itself, but Silsbee apparently figured out (thanks in part to CNN’s initial failure to redact some CCTV text that described the location of the camera) this footage must have been obtained by an MWAA employee working at the police dispatch center. </p><p>CCTV footage from  the dispatch center was obtained, which allegedly showed these actions being taken by the suspected leaker:</p><blockquote><p><em>“Between the hours of 2256 and 0545, Mr. Mbengue can be seen on multiple occasions utilize [sic] his personal cell phone to record video and photograph these critical scenes,” Silsbee wrote.</em></p></blockquote><p>That would be MWAA dispatch employee Mohamed Mbengue, who has since pleaded “no contest” to charges stemming from Virginia’s ultra-vague <a href=\"https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/18.2-152.4/\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/18.2-152.4/\">“computer trespass” law</a>. But it really takes a person with an overriding desire to shoot messengers to call cell phone recordings of screen images a “trespass.” </p><p>The word is generally understood to describe unauthorized access to an area a person is not allowed to be in. Mbengue was at work and had full access to these recordings as a part of his job. That he recorded them and sent them to CNN doesn’t align with any rational definition of the word “trespass.” The dissemination of footage may be a violation of policy, but policy violations aren’t criminal charges — the sort of thing that can do permanent damage to a person’s life in ways that write-ups and even justified terminations simply can’t.</p><p>That’s why discretion is key. But when discretion matters most, law enforcement tends to deliberately “err” on the side of whatever does the most damage to anyone it happens to be investigating. And it appears MWAA investigators are more than happy to throw criminal charges at people for, at most, violating agency policies. A second dispatcher (Jonathan Savoy) was caught doing the same thing (albeit without sharing the recordings with CNN) and faced similar charges until someone actually exercised a bit of discretion and declined to move forward with the case.</p><blockquote><p><em>On February 3, the MWAA&nbsp;<a href=\"https://x.com/allisonpapson/status/1886553371257266540?s=46&amp;t=p5q6YKIPojSzB8gCMgZMiA\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">announced</a>&nbsp;both men’s arrests, writing in a press statement that Savoy had been arrested “following further police investigation.”</em></p><p><em>In May, however, local prosecutors&nbsp;<a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2025/05/29/charges-dropped-leaked-dc-plane-crash-video/\">quietly dropped</a>&nbsp;the charges against Savoy, through a filing called a “nolle prosequi,” according to the court docket.</em></p></blockquote><p>There’s absolutely nothing in the statute that actually covers the actions described here, which formed the basis for the bullshit criminal charges. It takes a ton of punitive imagination to turn “recording a CCTV monitor with a phone” into a criminal act.

That means finding ways to adapt in a warming world, and paying close attention to groups that might be more vulnerable than others. \n\n[...] More than 2.4 billion people around the world -- 71 percent of the working population -- experience workplace heat stress, according to estimates from the ILO. Each year, 22.85 million occupational injuries and 18,970 fatalities are linked to excessive heat at work.

The project aims to make it easy to create tokens, check analytics, and give communities better visibility: all without needing complex coding or bridges.</p><p>According to the team, right now, the world of crypto can feel confusing and scattered - people often have to jump between many different apps and tools just to trade, track information, and stay safe. ESCAPE's goal is to make things simple by creating one all-in-one platform where everything you need is in one place.</p><p>The project's development strategy emerged from practical market experience, having initially deployed on an Ethereum Layer 2 solution where the team observed strong community demand for simplified, integrated tools. </p><p>The original implementation achieved a market capitalization of 11.5 million dollars within two days, demonstrating significant market appetite for consolidated crypto trading infrastructure. </p><p>Following the discontinuation of the initial Layer 2 platform, the team transitioned to Ethereum Layer 1 to ensure long-term sustainability and independence.</p><p>ESCAPE emphasizes transparency and accountability. The platform has successfully completed an audit by Hacken that also has audited known companies like Binance, verification by Coinsult, and a KYC review conducted by SolidProof ensures the team is Doxxed. The development process is tracked via an open community board.</p><p>During and after the presale, ESCAPE also offers a staking program with a sustainable 15% APY, giving early supporters a way to earn rewards. This rate was chosen carefully to ensure long-term growth and ecosystem stability.</p><p>A collaboration with PAW Chain will extend ESCAPE’s reach by enabling multichain deployment. This integration will allow token creators to launch identical contract addresses across more than 15 major blockchains, including Ethereum, Solana, Binance Smart Chain (BSC), Arbitrum, Base, and Avalanche - removing the need for bridges or wrapped tokens.</p><h3>Utilities and Deliverables</h3><p>The ESCAPE ecosystem, powered by the $ESCAPE token, is being rebuilt and expanded to include:</p><ul><li>EscapePad: a no-code token launchpad for Ethereum and future networks</li><li>DEX Viewer: real-time charts, wallet activity, and volume analytics</li><li>Wallet Inspector: cross-chain portfolio and transaction analysis</li><li>Telegram Bots: customizable alerts for trades and holder milestones</li><li>Mobile App: token deployment and monitoring on iOS and Android</li><li>Token Visibility Tools: ecosystem-native placement features for projects</li></ul><blockquote><p>“ESCAPE is being built to simplify Web3 and restore trust through transparency,” said an ESCAPE spokesperson. “The Ethereum relaunch and future multichain expansion represent more than a rebuild - they represent a stronger foundation for creators and communities to launch and grow without limitations.”</p></blockquote><p> is a Web3 infrastructure platform focused on token creation, analytics, and visibility across multiple blockchains. </p><p>Initially launched on a Layer 2 network in early 2025, ESCAPE grew to over 800 holders and an $11.5 million market cap before migrating to Ethereum. Today, ESCAPE operates with a transparent roadmap, audited smart contracts, and a community-first approach.</p><p>:::tip\nThis story was published as a press release by Chainwire under HackerNoon’s Business Blogging&nbsp;.</p>","contentLength":3565,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Europe Is Losing","url":"https://slashdot.org/story/25/08/22/1925255/europe-is-losing?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&utm_medium=feed","date":1755891000,"author":"msmash","guid":237066,"unread":true,"content":"Europe's share of global economic output has fallen from 33% to 23% since 2005 while its space launch capacity has nearly collapsed, launching just four rockets this year compared to over 100 for the United States and 40 for China.

what changes is the first argument:</p><pre><code>print(str.translate(\"Hello, world!\", _table))  # Hello world\nprint(str.translate(\"What?!\", _table))  # What</code></pre><p>This may lead you to wanting to use  to freeze the value  on the function , so you use the built-in  to check the signature of :</p><pre><code>translate(self, table, /) unbound builtins.str method</code></pre><p>You can see that the first argument is , the string you are trying to translate, and then  is the translation table (that  built magically for you).\nBut you can also see the forward slash , which means that  and  are positional-only arguments that cannot be passed in as keyword arguments!</p>","contentLength":2425,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"US government plans to take a 10% stake in Intel","url":"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/22/u-s-government-plans-to-take-a-10-stake-in-intel/","date":1755890076,"author":"Kirsten Korosec","guid":237050,"unread":true,"content":"<article>Such federal government ownership of a major corporation would mark a dramatic departure from long-standing U.S. policy. </article>","contentLength":121,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Nitro: A tiny but flexible init system and process supervisor","url":"https://git.vuxu.org/nitro/about/","date":1755889589,"author":"todsacerdoti","guid":237106,"unread":true,"content":"<p>Nitro is a tiny process supervisor that also can be used as pid 1 on Linux.</p><p>There are four main applications it is designed for:</p><ul><li>As init for a Linux machine for embedded, desktop or server purposes</li><li>As init for a Linux initramfs</li><li>As init for a Linux container (Docker/Podman/LXC/Kubernetes)</li><li>As unprivileged supervision daemon on POSIX systems</li></ul><p>Nitro is configured by a directory of scripts, defaulting to\n (or the first command line argument).</p><ul><li>Kernel support for Unix sockets</li><li> or writable  on another fs</li></ul><h2>Benefits over other systems</h2><ul><li>All state is kept in RAM, works without tricks on read-only root file systems.</li><li>Efficient event-driven, polling free operation.</li><li>Zero memory allocations during runtime.</li><li>No unbounded file descriptor usage during runtime.</li><li>One single self-contained binary, plus one optional binary to\ncontrol the system.</li><li>No configuration compilation steps needed, services are simple\ndirectories containing scripts.</li><li>Supports reliable restarting of services.</li><li>Reliable logging mechanisms per service or as default.</li><li>Support for logging chains spread over several services.</li><li>Works independently of properly set system clock.</li><li>Can be run on FreeBSD from /etc/ttys (sets up file descriptors 0, 1, 2).</li><li>Tiny static binary when using musl libc.</li></ul><p>Every directory inside  (or your custom service directory)\ncan contain several files:</p><ul><li>, an optional executable file that is run before the service starts.\nIt must exit with status 0 to continue.</li><li>, an optional executable file that runs the service;\nit must not exit as long as the service is considered running.\nIf there is no  script, the service is considered a “one shot”,\nand stays “up” until it’s explicitly taken “down”.</li><li>, an optional executable file that is run after the \nprocess finished.

Doing so would impact the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/ai-artificial-intelligence-poll-229b665d10d057441a69f56648b973e1\">60 percent</a>&nbsp;of Americans who get information from LLMs, and it would force developers to roll back efforts to&nbsp;reduce&nbsp;biases—making the models much less accurate, and far more likely to cause harm, especially in the hands of the government.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Less Accuracy, More Bias and Discrimination</strong></h3><p>It’s no secret that AI models—including gen AI—tend to discriminate against racial and gender minorities. AI models use machine learning to identify and reproduce patterns in data that they are “trained” on. If the training data reflects biases against racial, ethnic, and gender minorities—which it often does—then the AI model will “learn” to discriminate against those groups. In other words, garbage in, garbage out. Models also often reflect the biases of the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://hai.stanford.edu/news/covert-racism-ai-how-language-models-are-reinforcing-outdated-stereotypes\">people</a>&nbsp;who train, test, and evaluate them.&nbsp;</p><p>This is true across different types of AI. For example, “<a href=\"https://www.amnesty.org.uk/files/2025-02/Automated%20Racism%20Report%20-%20Amnesty%20International%20UK%20-%202025.pdf?VersionId=JqCcTODw37yAXyINmAY6uAzrKEWucFF7\">predictive policing</a>” tools trained on arrest data that reflects overpolicing of black neighborhoods frequently recommend heightened levels of policing in those neighborhoods, often based on inaccurate predictions that crime will occur there. Generative AI models are also implicated. LLMs&nbsp;<a href=\"https://hai.stanford.edu/news/covert-racism-ai-how-language-models-are-reinforcing-outdated-stereotypes\">already</a>&nbsp;recommend more criminal convictions, harsher sentences, and less prestigious jobs for people of color. Despite that people of color account for less than half of the U.S. prison population,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2023-generative-ai-bias/\">80 percent</a>&nbsp;of Stable Diffusion’s AI-generated images of inmates have darker skin. Over 90 percent of AI-generated images of judges were men; in real life, 34 percent of judges are women.&nbsp;</p><p>These models aren’t just biased—they’re fundamentally incorrect. Race and gender aren’t objective criteria for deciding who gets hired or convicted of a crime. Those discriminatory decisions reflected trends in the training data that could be caused by bias or chance—not some “objective” reality. Setting fairness aside, biased models are just worse models: they make more mistakes, more often. Efforts to reduce bias-induced errors will ultimately make models more accurate, not less.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Biased LLMs Cause Serious Harm—Especially in the Hands of the Government</strong></h3><p>But inaccuracy is far from the only problem. When government agencies start using biased AI to make decisions, real people suffer. Government officials routinely make decisions that impact people’s personal freedom and access to financial resources, healthcare, housing, and more. The White House’s AI Action Plan calls for a massive increase in agencies’ use of LLMs and other AI—while all but requiring the use of biased models that automate systemic, historical injustice. Using AI simply to entrench the way things have always been done squanders the promise of this new technology.</p><p>We need strong safeguards to prevent government agencies from procuring biased, harmful AI tools. In a series of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2025/01/28/2025-01901/initial-rescissions-of-harmful-executive-orders-and-actions\">executive</a><a href=\"https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2025/01/31/2025-02172/removing-barriers-to-american-leadership-in-artificial-intelligence\">orders</a>, as well as his AI Action Plan, the Trump Administration has rolled back the already-feeble Biden-era AI safeguards. This makes AI-enabled civil rights abuses far more likely, putting everyone’s rights at risk.&nbsp;</p><p>And the Administration could easily exploit the new rules to pressure companies to make publicly available models worse, too. Corporations like healthcare companies and landlords increasingly use AI to make high-impact decisions about people, so more biased commercial models would also cause harm.&nbsp;</p>","contentLength":4972,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Scientists just found a protein that reverses brain aging","url":"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/08/250820000808.htm","date":1755888987,"author":"stevenjgarner","guid":237063,"unread":true,"content":"<p>Now, researchers at UC San Francisco have identified a protein that's at the center of this decline.</p><p>They looked at how the genes and proteins in the hippocampus changed over time in mice and found just one that differed between old and young animals.

Applying emerging technologies to the geospatial domain offers a unique opportunity to create transformative user experiences and intuitive workstreams for users and organizations to deliver on their missions and responsibilities.</p><p>In this post, we explore how you can integrate existing systems with <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Amazon Bedrock</a> to create new workflows to unlock efficiencies insights. This integration can benefit technical, nontechnical, and leadership roles alike.</p><h2>Introduction to geospatial data</h2><p>Geospatial data is associated with a position relative to Earth (latitude, longitude, altitude). Numerical and structured geospatial data formats can be categorized as follows:</p><ul><li> – Geographical features, such as roads, buildings, or city boundaries, represented as points, lines, or polygons</li><li> – Geographical information, such as satellite imagery, temperature, or elevation maps, represented as a grid of cells</li><li> – Location-based data, such as descriptions and metrics (average rainfall, population, ownership), represented in a table of rows and columns</li></ul><p>Geospatial data sources might also contain natural language text elements for unstructured attributes and metadata for categorizing and describing the record in question. Geospatial Information Systems (GIS) provide a way to store, analyze, and display geospatial information. In GIS applications, this information is frequently presented with a map to visualize streets, buildings, and vegetation.</p><p>Large language models (LLMs) are a subset of foundation models (FMs) that can transform input (usually text or image, depending on model modality) into outputs (generally text) through a process called . Amazon Bedrock is a comprehensive, secure, and flexible service for building <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/generative-ai/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">generative AI</a> applications and agents.</p><p>LLMs work in many generalized tasks involving natural language. Some common LLM use cases include:</p><ul><li> – Use a model to summarize text or a document.</li><li> – Use a model to answer questions about data or facts from context provided during training or inference using Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG).</li><li> – Use a model to provide chain of thought reasoning to assist a human with decision-making and hypothesis evaluation.</li><li> – Use a model to generate synthetic data for testing simulations or hypothetical scenarios.</li><li> – Use a model to draft a report from insights derived from an Amazon Bedrock knowledge base or a user’s prompt.</li><li><strong>AI agent and tool orchestration</strong> – Use a model to plan the invocation of other systems and processes. After other systems are invoked by an agent, the agent’s output can then be used as context for further LLM generation.</li></ul><p>GIS can implement these capabilities to create value and improve user experiences. Benefits can include:</p><ul><li> – Taking real-time insights to support immediate decision-making, such as emergency response coordination and traffic management</li><li> – In-depth analysis that humans or systems can identify, such as trend analysis, patterns and relationships, and environmental monitoring</li><li> – Using research and analysis for informed long-term decision-making, such as infrastructure development, resource allocation, and environmental regulation</li></ul><p>Augmenting GIS and workflows with LLM capabilities leads to simpler analysis and exploration of data, discovery of new insights, and improved decision-making. Amazon Bedrock provides a way to host and invoke models as well as integrate the AI models with surrounding infrastructure, which we elaborate on in this post.</p><h2>Combining GIS and AI through RAG and agentic workflows</h2><p>LLMs are trained with large amounts of generalized information to discover patterns in how language is produced. To improve the performance of LLMs for specific use cases, approaches such as RAG and agentic workflows have been created. Retrieving policies and general knowledge for geospatial use cases can be accomplished with RAG, whereas calculating and analyzing GIS data would require an agentic workflow. In this section, we expand upon both RAG and agentic workflows in the context of geospatial use cases.</p><h3>Retrieval Augmented Generation</h3><p>With RAG, you can dynamically inject contextual information from a knowledge base during model invocation.</p><p>RAG supplements a user-provided prompt with data sourced from a knowledge base (collection of documents). Amazon Bedrock offers managed knowledge bases to data sources, such as <a href=\"http://aws.amazon.com/s3\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Amazon Simple Storage Service</a> (Amazon S3) and SharePoint, so you can provide supplemental information, such as city development plans, intelligence reports, or policies and regulations, when your AI assistant is generating a response for a user.</p><p>Knowledge bases are ideal for unstructured documents with information stored in natural language. When your AI model responds to a user with information sourced from RAG, it can provide references and citations to its source material. The following diagram shows how the systems connect together.</p><p>Because geospatial data is often structured and in a GIS, you can connect the GIS to the LLM using tools and agents instead of knowledge bases.</p><h3>Tools and agents (to control a UI and a system)</h3><p>Many LLMs, such as <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/claude/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Anthropic’s Claude</a> on Amazon Bedrock, make it possible to provide a description of tools available so your AI model can generate text to invoke external processes. These processes might retrieve live information, such as the current weather in a location or querying a structured data store, or might control external systems, such as starting a workflow or adding layers to a map. Some common geospatial functionality that you might want to integrate with your LLM using tools include:</p><ul><li>Performing mathematical calculations like the distance between coordinates, filtering datasets based on numeric values, or calculating derived fields</li><li>Deriving information from predictive analysis models</li><li>Looking up points of interest in structured data stores</li><li>Searching content and metadata in unstructured data stores</li><li>Retrieving real-time geospatial data, like traffic, directions, or estimated time to reach a destination</li><li>Visualizing distances, points of interest, or paths</li><li>Submitting work outputs such as analytic reports</li><li>Starting workflows, like ordering supplies or adjusting supply chain</li></ul><p>Tools are often implemented in <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">AWS Lambda</a> functions. Lambda runs code without the complexity and overhead of running servers. It handles the infrastructure management, enabling faster development, improved performance, enhanced security, and cost-efficiency.</p><p>Amazon Bedrock offers the feature <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/agents/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Amazon Bedrock Agents</a> to simplify the orchestration and integration with your geospatial tools. Amazon Bedrock agents follow instructions for LLM reasoning to break down a user prompt into smaller tasks and perform actions against identified tasks from action providers. The following diagram illustrates how Amazon Bedrock Agents works.</p><p>The following diagram shows how Amazon Bedrock Agents can enhance GIS solutions.</p><p>The following demonstration applies the concepts we’ve discussed to an earthquake analysis agent as an example. This example deploys an Amazon Bedrock agent with a knowledge base based on <a href=\"http://aws.amazon.com/redshift\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Amazon Redshift</a>. The Redshift instance has two tables. One table is for earthquakes, which includes date, magnitude, latitude, and longitude. The second table holds the counites in California, described as polygon shapes. The geospatial capabilities of Amazon Redshift can relate these datasets to answer queries like which county had the most recent earthquake or which county has had the most earthquakes in the last 20 years. The Amazon Bedrock agent can generate these geospatially based queries based on natural language.</p><p>This script creates an end-to-end pipeline that performs the following steps:</p><ol><li>Processes geospatial data.</li><li>Sets up cloud infrastructure.</li><li>Loads and configures the spatial database.</li><li>Creates an AI agent for spatial analysis.</li></ol><p>In the following sections, we create this agent and test it out.</p><p>To implement this approach, you must have an AWS account with the appropriate <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/iam/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">AWS Identity and Access Management</a> (IAM) permissions for Amazon Bedrock, Amazon Redshift, and Amazon S3.</p><ol><li>Confirm you have access to the latest version of the AWS CLI.</li><li><a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/signin/latest/userguide/command-line-sign-in.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Sign in</a> to the AWS CLI with your credentials.</li><li>Make sure ./jq is installed.

Having a state engine that can relay information from a frontend view to the LLM input adds a richer context.</p><p>The LLM understands the context of “here” based on the selected marker, performs retrieval to see the land development policy, and responds to the user in simple natural language, “No, and here is why…”</p><p>This example demonstrates the LLM capabilities for UI context, chain of thought reasoning, RAG, and tool use.</p><h3>Example 5: UI context and UI control</h3><p>Next, we choose a marker on the map and input the prompt “draw a .25 mile circle around here so I can visualize walking distance.”</p><p>The LLM invokes the draw circle tool to create a layer on the map centered at the selected marker, contextualized by “here.”</p><p>This example demonstrates the LLM capabilities for UI context, chain of thought reasoning, tool use, and UI control.</p><p>To clean up your resources and prevent AWS charges from being incurred, complete the following steps:</p><ol><li>Delete the Amazon Bedrock knowledge base.</li><li>Delete the Redshift cluster.</li></ol><p>The integration of LLMs with GIS creates intuitive systems that help users of different technical levels perform complex spatial analysis through natural language interactions.

You know how the system works: lower courts make decisions based on law and precedent, parties can appeal, and eventually the highest court issues careful, reasoned opinions that other courts can follow. It’s not a perfect system, but it’s a system.</p><p>The less nice thing is when the Supreme Court decides that systems are for suckers.</p><p>We <a href=\"https://www.techdirt.com/2025/04/21/rip-john-robertss-summer-vacation/\">had warned</a> how John Roberts was guaranteeing that the Court would be kept busy all summer with these shadow docket rulings, and that is exactly what has happened. The pattern is straightforward: lower courts try to enforce existing law, the administration appeals on an emergency basis, and the Supreme Court says “okay, sure, let Trump do what he wants” with zero legal explanation. The only coherent principle seems to be “it’s okay if Trump does it.”</p><p>This is, let’s be clear, not how judicial systems are supposed to work. But Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson has been <a href=\"https://www.techdirt.com/2025/07/15/the-supreme-courts-shadow-docket-has-become-a-lawless-explanation-free-rubber-stamp-for-trumps-authoritarian-agenda/\">calling this out</a> with increasing directness. She’s not mincing words. She’s not worried about collegiality. And now she’s given us the perfect term for what’s happening. She’s <a href=\"https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/24pdf/25a103_kh7p.pdf#page=16\">added Calvinball to the SCOTUS lexicon</a>:</p><blockquote><p><em>In a broader sense, however, today’s ruling is of a piece with this Court’s recent tendencies. “[R]ight when the Judiciary should be hunkering down to do all it can to preserve the law’s constraints,” the Court opts instead to make vindicating the rule of law and preventing manifestly injurious Government action as difficult as possible…..</em><strong><em>This is Calvinball jurisprudence with a twist. Calvinball has only one rule: There are no fixed rules. We seem to have two: that one, and this Administration always wins.</em></strong></p></blockquote><p><a href=\"https://calvinandhobbes.fandom.com/wiki/Calvinball\">Calvinball</a>, of course, is the favored pastime of Calvin from Bill Watterson’s Calvin and Hobbes. And, yes, the point is that there are no rules.<a href=\"https://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/1994/07/31\"></a></p><p>The somewhat prescient Oxford English Dictionary <a href=\"https://www.oed.com/information/updates/march-2025/new-word-entries/\">added it</a> to the dictionary just a few months ago, apparently recognizing how widely it’s been used to describe courts these days. I’ve certainly been <a href=\"https://www.techdirt.com/?s=calvinball\">using it to describe</a> various judicial adventures of late, so it’s satisfying to see Justice Jackson make it official.</p><p>Jackson’s diagnosis cuts deeper than just this particular case. She’s identifying a systemic problem: a Court that has abandoned legal reasoning in favor of reaching predetermined outcomes, then wrapping those outcomes in enough procedural complexity that nobody can quite pin down what the rules actually are.</p><p>It almost doesn’t matter what this case is about, because it’s the principle about how the Supreme Court is now creating massively consequential binding precedent without the basic fundamentals of a thorough judicial process with things like full briefing or oral arguments.</p><p>But just for clarity: the case itself was about whether NIH could terminate nearly a billion dollars in grants. A district court judge had said (using actual reasoning and legal precedent) that NIH had to continue providing the money it had already promised and budgeted, noting that halting such payments violated the Administrative Procedure Act’s prohibition against “arbitrary and capricious” government actions. Straightforward stuff, really.</p><p>Unlike some shadow docket rulings, there were at least  explanations given here, though nothing you’d call illuminating. Four useless paragraphs basically just say the lower court’s ruling is stayed. Then there are various concurrences and dissents (and partial concurrences and partial dissents) that make it clear nobody quite agrees on what they’re doing, though much of it involves arguing over how much precedent an  shadow docket ruling (with basically zero explanation) should have on later shadow docket decisions.</p><p>Which maybe should have been a hint that this is a case that needs full briefing before making such consequential decisions about it.</p><p>And the lineup underscores the point: Justice Barrett would  grant the stay; Chief Justice Roberts with Justices Sotomayor, Kagan, and Jackson would deny it entirely; Justices Thomas, Alito, Gorsuch, and Kavanaugh would grant it entirely. If you’re keeping score of this Calvinball game, that’s a three-way split on an “emergency” order, with Barrett’s split vote winning the day—exactly the kind of messy, disputed ruling that demands full briefing.</p><p>It’s like watching people argue about the rules of a game while they’re making up the rules as they go along—and their only guiding principle is “well, we know who has to win.” Which, Jackson points out, is basically what’s happening. This creates what she calls a “jurisdictional maze” where plaintiffs can challenge government policies in one court but can’t get relief in the same court—effectively gutting the Administrative Procedure Act’s protections against arbitrary government action.</p><p>Justice Jackson’s key contribution is highlighting just how lawless it all is. She calls out how she warned about how this would play out, and the fact that the majority on SCOTUS views these (again, unbriefed and mostly unexplained) rulings as binding across the country is terrifying:</p><blockquote><p><em>I viewed the Court’s intervention then—in an emergency stay posture, while racing against a fast-expiring temporary restraining order—as “equal parts unprincipled and unfortunate.”…</em></p><p><em>As it turns out, the Court’s decision was an even bigger mistake than I realized. The Court’s reasoning in California was not only “at the least under-developed, and very possibly wrong,” id., at ___ (KAGAN, J., dissenting) (slip op., at 1), but also evidently resolved more than the jurisdictional dispute over the particular education-related grants at issue in that case. Today’s decision reveals California’s considerable wingspan: That case’s ipse dixit now apparently governs all APA challenges to grant-funding determinations that the Government asks us to address in the context of an emergency stay application. A half paragraph of reasoning (issued without full briefing or any oral argument) thus suffices here to partially sustain the Government’s abrupt cancellation of hundreds of millions of dollars allocated to support life-saving biomedical research.</em></p></blockquote><p>The theory behind the shadow docket is pretty simple. Sometimes you need emergency relief to maintain the status quo while the regular judicial process works: full briefing, oral arguments, careful deliberation, the whole thing. The emergency docket exists so that <strong>irreversible harm doesn’t happen while everyone’s figuring out the right answer</strong>.</p><p>But what’s been happening is the opposite. Rather than preserving the status quo, the Court has been allowing—encouraging, really—irreversible changes to happen, without bothering to understand the issues or explain the reasoning.</p><p>And now they’re saying that these brain fart decisions based on zero details or due process, should be deemed the supreme law of the land? Jackson is having none of it:</p><blockquote><p><strong><em>lobs this grenade without evaluating Congress’s intent or the profound legal and practical consequences</em></strong><em>of this ruling. Stated simply: With potentially life-saving scientific advancements on the line, the Court turns a nearly century-old statute aimed at remedying unreasoned agency decision-making into a gauntlet rather than a refuge. But we have no business erecting a novel jurisdictional barrier to judicial review— especially when it appears nowhere in the relevant statutes and makes little sense.</em></p></blockquote><p>This is not how judicial systems work, if you want them to remain judicial systems.</p><p>The majority is pretty explicit in their view that these unbriefed, unargued, unexplained shadow docket orders should bind everyone. Gorsuch, in his concurrence, doesn’t hold back:</p><blockquote><p><em>… when this Court issues a decision, it constitutes a precedent that commands respect in lower courts…. regardless of a decision’s procedural posture, its “reasoning—its ratio decidendi”—carries precedential weight in “future cases.”</em></p></blockquote><p>This is the judicial equivalent of an angry father, challenged by a child regarding a rule, retorting with “because I say so, and I’m the man of the house.”</p><p>It’s exactly how children (and aggrieved parties) lose respect for the rules.</p><p>Look, it’s entirely possible that after full briefing and oral arguments, the Supreme Court would reach the same result. That would be annoying for other reasons, but at least there would have been due process and a chance for all relevant parties to be fully heard. That’s how it’s supposed to work. You do the analysis, you explain the reasoning, you create precedent that other courts can follow.</p><p>What the Roberts Court has been doing is the opposite. John Roberts himself sided with the dissenters here, but he’s presided over a court that has decided outcomes matter more than process. The result is a system where “just give Trump what he wants” has become the only reliable principle.</p><p>What was once a respected judicial system has become a comic strip punch line. At least Calvin had the excuse of being six years old.</p>","contentLength":9143,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Sprinkling self-doubt on ChatGPT","url":"https://justin.searls.co/posts/sprinkling-self-doubt-on-chatgpt/","date":1755884727,"author":"ingve","guid":237062,"unread":true,"content":"<article data-pagefind-body=\"\"><a href=\"https://justin.searls.co/posts/sprinkling-self-doubt-on-chatgpt/\"></a><p>I replaced my ChatGPT personalization settings with this prompt a few weeks ago and promptly forgot about it:</p><blockquote><ul><li>Be extraordinarily skeptical of your own correctness or stated assumptions.

However, I had to draw the line and stop giving Google my data for free.</p><p>The problem with email is that everything is transmitted in plain text. Technically, Google can store every message you receive and know everything, and U.S. agencies can request access to that data (this include also EU citizens under the <a href=\"https://policies.google.com/privacy/frameworks?hl=en-US\">EU-U.S. and Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Frameworks</a>).</p><p>For someone like me, who cares about privacy and runs as much as possible on my own home servers, that felt like way too much.</p><p>So I decided to switch to another provider, one that respects privacy a bit more. Of course, this meant no longer “paying” with my personal data, but instead paying the actual price of the email service.</p><p>Let me start by saying: I use email in a very basic way. I send and receive a lot of messages (at least 50 a day), but they’re plain text/html emails with no attachments or fancy features. I couldn’t care less about the rest of the “suite\", like notes, contacts, calendars and all that extra stuff.</p><p>So, after a bit of research, I narrowed it down to three different services:</p><ul></ul><p>The last two providers offered true end-to-end encryption, at a cost of about €3/4 per month. Sounds good… but the catch is that to use their end-to-end encryption you’re forced to use their apps (or, on macOS, run a background “bridge”).</p><p>That’s a no go for me, because I love Apple’s Mail app on macOS and iOS, it just works perfectly for my needs, and I don’t want to give that up.</p><p>So, I went with mailbox.org that still offers integrated PGP encryption, and if you want, you can always use external PGP too (which I was already doing with Gmail).</p><p>Mailbox.org has a solid plan: 10GB of email storage plus 5GB of cloud storage starting at €2.50/month (paid annually). You can even expand the mail storage up to 100GB, at €0.20 per gigabyte.</p><p>I was using around 2.5GB on Gmail, so I had no issues with paying the equivalent of two coffees a month for a huge boost in privacy. And if I ever need more space, I can just add it on-demand for €0.20/GB.</p><p>There’s also a free one-month trial, but it’s pretty limited since you can’t send emails outside of mailbox.org domains.</p><p>So win the end, I registered my new address <code>giuliomagnifico@mailbox.org</code> and paid €3 for a month of testing. That means I’m covered for two months, and then I can just “top up” the account with €30 for a full year.</p><div><div>Mailbox.org doesn’t use auto-renewal, so you have to manually top up your account. Nice feature</div></div><p>The web interface is extremely simple but very effective. I actually find it better than Gmail, less bloated of useless stuff.</p><p>And on mobile it’s very usable too.</p><img src=\"https://giuliomagnifico.blog/_images/2025/away-from-gmail/ios.jpeg\" alt=\"ios\"><p>One thing I prefer is using folders instead of Gmail’s “labels.” Mainly because this way I can put the folders directly under the account in Apple Mail (I think is the only email that can actually support this).</p><img src=\"https://giuliomagnifico.blog/_images/2025/away-from-gmail/folders.jpeg\" alt=\"folders\"><p>Mailbox.org also has all the features I need,\nand probably way more than I’ll ever use. It even includes storage, video chat, an XMPP chat, task lists, calendar, contacts, an Etherpad (basically shared notes, I think), and so on… none of which I really care about.</p><p>I decided to move all my emails from Gmail to mailbox.org, so I could (in future) completely wipe my Gmail account.</p><p>After creating an “app password” on Gmail, I installed the Docker image and ran the tool with this script:</p><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code>#!/bin/sh\nset -eu\n\nHOST1=\"imap.gmail.com\"\nUSER1=\"giuliomagnifico@gmail.com\"\nPASS1=\"xxx\"\n\nHOST2=\"imap.mailbox.org\"\nUSER2=\"giuliomagnifico@mailbox.org\"\nPASS2=\"xxx\"\n\nLOGDIR=\"/home/imapsync/logs\"\nmkdir -p \"$LOGDIR\"\nLOGFILE=\"$LOGDIR/sync_$(date +%F_%H-%M-%S).log\"\n\necho \"Starting: $(date)\"\ndocker compose run --rm imapsync imapsync \\\n  --host1 \"$HOST1\" --user1 \"$USER1\" --password1 \"$PASS1\" --ssl1 \\\n  --host2 \"$HOST2\" --user2 \"$USER2\" --password2 \"$PASS2\" --ssl2 \\\n  --automap --syncinternaldates --skipsize \\\n  --useuid --addheader --usecache --buffersize 4096 \\\n  --nofoldersizes --nofoldersizesatend \\\n  --exclude \"\\[Gmail\\]/All Mail\" \\\n  --regextrans2 \"s/\\[Imap\\]\\/Archive/Archive/\" \\\n  --log &gt; \"$LOGFILE\" 2&gt;&amp;1\n\necho \"Complete: $(date)\"\necho \"Log file: $LOGFILE\"\n</code></pre><p>The script excludes the All Mail folder\" using: <code>--exclude \"\\[Gmail\\]/All Mail\" \\</code></p><p>This to avoid duplicate emails already present in the folders, I also merged the  folder into the general Archive folder using: <code>--regextrans2 \"s/\\[Imap\\]\\/Archive/Archive/\"</code></p><p>This because Apple’s Mail app creates the  folder/label on Gmail whenever you use the “Archive” function instead of “Trash.”</p><p>The whole process took a couple of hours (11201secs, ~3h to be precise) during which I was monitoring the logs using: <code>tail -f /home/imapsync/logs/sync_2025-08-19_15-02-48.log</code></p><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code>[cut]\nmsg [Gmail]/Trash/183393 {19549}      copied to Trash/13361      2.36 msgs/s  200.418 KiB/s 2.140 GiB copied \nmsg [Gmail]/Trash/183394 {92245}      copied to Trash/13362      2.36 msgs/s  200.420 KiB/s 2.140 GiB copied \nmsg [Gmail]/Trash/183395 {19675}      copied to Trash/13363      2.36 msgs/s  200.415 KiB/s 2.140 GiB copied \nmsg [Gmail]/Trash/183396 {5953}       copied to Trash/13364      2.36 msgs/s  200.410 KiB/s 2.140 GiB copied \n++++ End looping on each folder\n++++ Statistics\nTransfer started on                     : Tuesday 19 August 2025-08-19 03:02:49 +0000 UTC\nTransfer ended on                       : Tuesday 19 August 2025-08-19 06:09:30 +0000 UTC\nTransfer time                           : 11201.5 sec\nFolders synced                          : 14/14 synced\nFolders deleted on host2                : 0 \nMessages transferred                    : 26407 \nMessages skipped                        : 0\nMessages found duplicate on host1       : 0\nMessages found duplicate on host2       : 0\nMessages found crossduplicate on host2  : 0\nMessages void (noheader) on host1       : 0  \nMessages void (noheader) on host2       : 0\nMessages found in host1 not in host2    : 0 messages\nMessages found in host2 not in host1    : 0 messages\nMessages deleted on host1               : 0\nMessages deleted on host2               : 0\nTotal bytes transferred                 : 2297647358 (2.140 GiB)\nTotal bytes skipped                     : 0 (0.000 KiB)\nMessage rate                            : 2.4 messages/s\nAverage bandwidth rate                  : 200.3 KiB/s\nReconnections to host1                  : 0\nReconnections to host2                  : 0\nMemory consumption at the end           : 268.7 MiB (*time 836.2 MiB*h) (started with 161.5 MiB)\nLoad end is                             : 0.06 0.08 0.08 1/1135 on 16 cores\nCPU time and %CPU                       : 446.72 sec 4.0 %CPU 0.2 %allcpus\nBiggest message transferred             : 30413995 bytes (29.005 MiB)\nMemory/biggest message ratio            : 9.3\nDetected 0 errors\nThis imapsync is up to date.

(The  tag is perfect for this, since it add a “real red flag” in Apple Mail on iOS, iPadOS and macOS)</p><p>Mailbox.org allows you to easily import your keys for PGP cryptography directly from the web. This is convenient as it lets you read and send PGP encrypted emails right from the browser on iOS, where there aren’t any “decent” apps for encrypted mail. The same goes for macOS, although there you can just use Thunderbird, which works really well.</p><p>Here’s how PGP emails look on iOS:</p><img src=\"https://giuliomagnifico.blog/_images/2025/away-from-gmail/gpgios.jpeg\" alt=\"PGPios\"><p>To send encrypted emails, you just select “Use PGP encrypted” when composing a new message, after importing your private key, of course.</p><p>And from the web interface, there’s also a handy feature to quickly import the sender’s public keys:</p><p>I’m satisfied. Leaving Gmail completely was something I wanted to do for a long time, but I was always hesitant. Finally, I made the switch, and, as often happens with these transitions, I discovered many unexpected positive aspects.</p><p>Oh, and if you have something to tell me or just want to test Mailbox.org after your switch, feel free to send me an email.

The service’s API-driven approach allows seamless model interchangeability, but this flexibility introduces a critical challenge: which model will deliver optimal performance for a specific application while meeting operational constraints?</p><p>Our research with enterprise customers reveals that many early generative AI projects select models based on either limited manual testing or reputation, rather than systematic evaluation against business requirements. This approach frequently results in:</p><ul><li>Over-provisioning computational resources to accommodate larger models than required</li><li>Sub-optimal performance because of misalignment between model strengths and use case requirements</li><li>Unnecessarily high operational costs because of inefficient token utilization</li><li>Production performance issues discovered too late in the development lifecycle</li></ul><h2>A multidimensional evaluation framework—Foundation model capability matrix</h2><p>Foundation models vary significantly across multiple dimensions, with performance characteristics that interact in complex ways. Our capability matrix provides a structured view of critical dimensions to consider when <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/amazon-bedrock-model-evaluation-is-now-generally-available/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">evaluating models</a> in Amazon Bedrock. Below are four core dimensions (in no specific order) – Task performance, Architectural characteristics, Operational considerations, and Responsible AI attributes.</p><p>Evaluating the models based on the task performance is crucial for achieving direct impact on business outcomes, ROI, user adoption and trust, and competitive advantage.</p><ul><li>: Evaluate models using benchmarks relevant to your use case (MMLU, HELM, or domain-specific benchmarks).</li><li><strong>Few-shot learning capabilities</strong>: Strong few-shot performers require minimal examples to adapt to new tasks, leading to cost efficiency, faster time-to-market, resource optimization, and operational benefits.</li><li><strong>Instruction following fidelity</strong>: For the applications that require precise adherence to commands and constraints, it is critical to evaluate model’s instruction following fidelity.</li><li>: Reliability and reproducibility across multiple runs with identical prompts.</li><li><strong>Domain-specific knowledge</strong>: Model performance varies dramatically across specialized fields based on training data. Evaluate the models base on your domain-specific use-case scenarios.</li><li>Evaluate the model’s ability to perform logical inference, causal reasoning, and multi-step problem-solving. This can include reasoning such as deductive and inductive, mathematical, chain-of-thought, and so on.</li></ul><h3><strong>Architectural characteristics</strong></h3><p>Architectural characteristics for evaluating the models are important as they directly impact the model’s performance, efficiency, and suitability for specific tasks.</p><ul><li><strong>Parameter count (model size)</strong>: Larger models typically offer more capabilities but require greater computational resources and may have higher inference costs and latency.</li><li><strong>Training data composition</strong>: Models trained on diverse, high-quality datasets tend to have better generalization abilities across different domains.</li><li>: Decoder-only models excel at text generation, encoder-decoder architectures handle translation and summarization more effectively, while mixture of experts (MoE) architectures can be a powerful tool for improving the performance of both decoder-only and encoder-decoder models. Some specialized architectures focus on enhancing reasoning capabilities through techniques like chain-of-thought prompting or recursive reasoning.</li><li>: The way models process text affects performance on domain-specific tasks, particularly with specialized vocabulary.</li><li><strong>Context window capabilities</strong>: Larger context windows enable processing more information at once, critical for document analysis and extended conversations.</li><li>: Modality refers to type of data a model can process and generate, such as text, image, audio, or video. Consider the modality of the models depending on the use case, and choose the model optimized for that specific modality.</li></ul><h3><strong>Operational considerations</strong></h3><p>Below listed operational considerations are critical for model selection as they directly impact the real-world feasibility, cost-effectiveness, and sustainability of AI deployments.</p><ul><li><strong>Throughput and latency profiles</strong>: Response speed impacts user experience and throughput determines scalability.</li><li>: Input/output token pricing significantly affects economics at scale.</li><li><strong>Scalability characteristics</strong>: Ability to handle concurrent requests and maintain performance during traffic spikes.</li><li>: Fine-tuning capabilities and adaptation methods for tailoring to specific use cases or domains.</li><li>: Ease of integration into existing systems and workflow is an important consideration.</li><li>: When dealing with sensitive data, model security—including data encryption, access control, and vulnerability management—is a crucial consideration.</li></ul><h3><strong>Responsible AI attributes</strong></h3><p>As AI becomes increasingly embedded in business operations and daily lives, evaluating models on responsible AI attributes isn’t just a technical consideration—it’s a business imperative.</p><ul><li>: Models vary in their tendency to generate plausible but incorrect information.</li><li>: Performance across different demographic groups affects fairness and equity.</li><li><strong>Safety guardrail effectiveness</strong>: Resistance to generating harmful or inappropriate content.</li><li><strong>Explainability and privacy</strong>: Transparency features and handling of sensitive information.</li><li>: Legal considerations should include data privacy, non-discrimination, intellectual property, and product liability.</li></ul><h2>Agentic AI considerations for model selection</h2><p>The growing popularity of agentic AI applications introduces evaluation dimensions beyond traditional metrics. When assessing models for use in autonomous agents, consider these critical capabilities:</p><p><strong>Agent-specific evaluation dimensions</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Planning and reasoning capabilities</strong>: Evaluate chain-of-thought consistency across complex multi-step tasks and self-correction mechanisms that allow agents to identify and fix their own reasoning errors.</li><li>: Test function calling capabilities, parameter handling precision, and structured output consistency (JSON/XML) for seamless tool use.</li><li><strong>Agent-to-agent communication</strong>: Assess protocol adherence to frameworks like A2A and efficient contextual memory management across extended multi-agent interactions.</li></ul><p><strong>Multi-agent collaboration testing</strong> for applications using multiple specialized agents</p><ul><li>: Measure how well models maintain distinct agent personas and responsibilities without role confusion.</li><li><strong>Information sharing efficiency</strong>: Test how effectively information flows between agent instances without critical detail loss.</li><li><strong>Collaborative intelligence</strong>: Verify whether multiple agents working together produce better outcomes than single-model approaches.</li><li><strong>Error propagation resistance</strong>: Assess how robustly multi-agent systems contain and correct errors rather than amplifying them.</li></ul><h2>A four-phase evaluation methodology</h2><p>Our recommended methodology progressively narrows model selection through increasingly sophisticated assessment techniques:</p><h3>Phase 1: Requirements engineering</h3><p>Begin with a precise specification of your application’s requirements:</p><ul><li>: Define primary tasks, domain knowledge needs, language support, output formats, and reasoning complexity.</li><li><strong>Non-functional requirements</strong>: Specify latency thresholds, throughput requirements, budget constraints, context window needs, and availability expectations.</li><li><strong>Responsible AI requirements</strong>: Establish hallucination tolerance, bias mitigation needs, safety requirements, explainability level, and privacy constraints.</li><li><strong>Agent-specific requirements</strong>: For agentic applications, define tool-use capabilities, protocol adherence standards, and collaboration requirements.</li></ul><p>Assign weights to each requirement based on business priorities to create your evaluation scorecard foundation.</p><h3>Phase 2: Candidate model selection</h3><p>Use the Amazon Bedrock model information <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/APIReference/API_ListFoundationModels.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">API</a> to filter models based on hard requirements. This typically reduces candidates from dozens to 3–7 models that are worth detailed evaluation.</p><p>Filter options include but aren’t limited to the following:</p><ul><li>Filter by modality support, context length, and language capabilities</li><li>Exclude models that don’t meet minimum performance thresholds</li><li>Calculate theoretical costs at projected scale so that you can exclude options that exceed the available budget</li><li>Filter for customization requirements such as fine-tuning capabilities</li><li>For agentic applications, filter for function calling and multi-agent protocol support</li></ul><p>Although the Amazon Bedrock model information API might not provide the filters you need for candidate selection, you can use the Amazon Bedrock model catalog (shown in the following figure) to obtain additional information about these models.</p><h3>Phase 3: Systematic performance evaluation</h3><ol><li><strong>Prepare evaluation datasets</strong>: Create representative task examples, challenging edge cases, domain-specific content, and adversarial examples.</li><li><strong>Design evaluation prompts</strong>: Standardize instruction format, maintain consistent examples, and mirror production usage patterns.</li><li>: Select appropriate metrics for subjective tasks (human evaluation and reference-free quality), objective tasks (precision, recall, and F1 score), and reasoning tasks (logical consistency and step validity).</li><li>: Add protocol conformance testing, multi-step planning assessment, and tool-use evaluation.</li><li>: Maintain consistent parameters across models and collect comprehensive performance data.</li><li><strong>Measure operational performance</strong>: Capture throughput, latency distributions, error rates, and actual token consumption costs.</li></ol><h3>Phase 4: Decision analysis</h3><p>Transform evaluation data into actionable insights:</p><ol><li>: Scale all metrics to comparable units using min-max normalization.</li><li>: Calculate composite scores based on your prioritized requirements.</li><li><strong>Perform sensitivity analysis</strong>: Test how robust your conclusions are against weight variations.</li><li>: Create radar charts, efficiency frontiers, and tradeoff curves for clear comparison.</li><li>: Detail each model’s strengths, limitations, and optimal use cases.</li></ol><h2>Advanced evaluation techniques</h2><p>Beyond standard procedures, consider the following approaches for evaluating models.</p><h3>A/B testing with production traffic</h3><p>Implement comparative testing using <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/intelligent-prompt-routing/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Amazon Bedrock’s routing</a> capabilities to gather real-world performance data from actual users.</p><p>Test model vulnerabilities through prompt injection attempts, challenging syntax, edge case handling, and domain-specific factual challenges.</p><h3>Multi-model ensemble evaluation</h3><p>Assess combinations such as sequential pipelines, voting ensembles, and cost-efficient routing based on task complexity.</p><h3>Continuous evaluation architecture</h3><p>Design systems to monitor production performance with:</p><ul><li>Stratified sampling of production traffic across task types and domains</li><li>Regular evaluations and trigger-based reassessments when new models emerge</li><li>Performance thresholds and alerts for quality degradation</li><li>User feedback collection and failure case repositories for continuous improvement</li></ul><h3>Industry-specific considerations</h3><p>Different sectors have unique requirements that influence model selection:</p><ul><li>: Regulatory compliance, numerical precision, and personally identifiable information (PII) handling capabilities</li><li>: Medical terminology understanding, HIPAA adherence, and clinical reasoning</li><li>: Technical specification comprehension, procedural knowledge, and spatial reasoning</li><li>: Autonomous reasoning, tool integration, and protocol conformance</li></ul><h2>Best practices for model selection</h2><p>Through this comprehensive approach to model evaluation and selection, organizations can make informed decisions that balance performance, cost, and operational requirements while maintaining alignment with business objectives. The methodology makes sure that model selection isn’t a one-time exercise but an evolving process that adapts to changing needs and technological capabilities.</p><ul><li><strong>Assess your situation thoroughly</strong>: Understand your specific use case requirements and available resources</li><li><strong>Select meaningful metrics</strong>: Focus on metrics that directly relate to your business objectives</li><li><strong>Build for continuous evaluation</strong>: Design your evaluation process to be repeatable as new models are released</li></ul><h2>Looking forward: The future of model selection</h2><p>As foundation models evolve, evaluation methodologies must keep pace. Below are further considerations (By no means this list of considerations is exhaustive and is subject to ongoing updates as technology evolves and best practices emerge), you should take into account while selecting the best model(s) for your use-case(s).</p><ul><li><strong>Multi-model architectures</strong>: Enterprises will increasingly deploy specialized models in concert rather than relying on single models for all tasks.</li><li>: Evaluation frameworks must assess how models perform as autonomous agents with tool-use capabilities and inter-agent collaboration.</li><li>: The growing landscape of domain-specific models will require more nuanced evaluation of specialized capabilities.</li><li>: As models become more capable, evaluation of controllability and alignment with human intent becomes increasingly important.</li></ul><p>By implementing a comprehensive evaluation framework that extends beyond basic metrics, organizations can informed decisions about which foundation models will best serve their requirements. For agentic AI applications in particular, thorough evaluation of reasoning, planning, and collaboration capabilities is essential for success. By approaching model selection systematically, organizations can avoid the common pitfalls of over-provisioning, misalignment with use case needs, excessive operational costs, and late discovery of performance issues. The investment in thorough evaluation pays dividends through optimized costs, improved performance, and superior user experiences.</p><p> is a Senior Generative AI Data Scientist at Amazon Web Services, helping businesses innovate with generative AI.

Despite the critical role these documents play, an <a href=\"https://mitsloan.mit.edu/ideas-made-to-matter/tapping-power-unstructured-data\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">estimated 80–90%</a> of the data they contain is unstructured and largely untapped, hiding valuable insights that could transform business outcomes. Despite advances in technology, many organizations still rely on manual data entry, spending countless hours extracting information from PDFs, scanned images, and forms. This manual approach is time-consuming, error-prone, and prevents organizations from scaling their operations and responding quickly to business demands.</p><p>Although generative AI has made it easier to build proof-of-concept document processing solutions, the journey from proof of concept to production remains fraught with challenges. Organizations often find themselves rebuilding from scratch when they discover their prototype can’t handle production volumes, lacks proper error handling, doesn’t scale cost-effectively, or fails to meet enterprise security and compliance requirements. What works in a demo with a handful of documents often breaks down when processing thousands of documents daily in a production environment.</p><p>In this post, we introduce our open source <a href=\"https://github.com/aws-solutions-library-samples/accelerated-intelligent-document-processing-on-aws/blob/main/README.md\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">GenAI IDP Accelerator</a>—a tested solution that we use to help customers across industries address their document processing challenges. Automated document processing workflows accurately extract structured information from documents, reducing manual effort. We will show you how this ready-to-deploy solution can help you build those workflows with generative AI on AWS in days instead of months.</p><h2>Understanding intelligent document processing</h2><p>Intelligent document processing (IDP) encompasses the technologies and techniques used to extract and process data from various document types. Common IDP tasks include:</p><ul><li><strong>OCR (Optical Character Recognition)</strong> – Converting scanned documents and images into machine-readable text</li><li> – Automatically identifying document types (such as invoices, contracts, or forms)</li><li> – Pulling structured information from unstructured documents</li><li> – Evaluating the quality and confidence of extracted data</li><li> – Creating concise summaries of document content</li><li> – Measuring accuracy and performance against expected outcomes</li></ul><p>These capabilities are critical across industries. In financial services, organizations use IDP to process loan applications, extract data from bank statements, and validate insurance claims. Healthcare providers rely on IDP to extract patient information from medical records, process insurance forms, and handle lab results efficiently. Manufacturing and logistics companies use IDP to process invoices and purchase orders, extract shipping information, and handle quality certificates. Government agencies use IDP to process citizen applications, extract data from tax forms, manage permits and licenses, and enforce regulatory compliance.</p><h2>The generative AI revolution in IDP</h2><p>Traditional IDP solutions relied on template-based extraction, regular expressions, and classical machine learning (ML) models. Though functional, these approaches required extensive setup, struggled with document variations, and achieved limited accuracy on complex documents.</p><p>The emergence of large language models (LLMs) and generative AI has fundamentally transformed IDP capabilities. Modern AI models can understand document context, handle variations without templates, achieve near-human accuracy on complex extractions, and adapt to new document types with minimal examples. This shift from rule-based to intelligence-based processing means organizations can now process different document types with high accuracy, dramatically reducing the time and cost of implementation.</p><p>We’re excited to share the <a href=\"https://github.com/aws-solutions-library-samples/accelerated-intelligent-document-processing-on-aws/blob/main/README.md\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">GenAI IDP Accelerator</a>—an open source solution that transforms how organizations handle document processing by dramatically reducing manual effort and improving accuracy.

SageMaker HyperPod removes the undifferentiated heavy lifting involved in building and optimizing machine learning (ML) infrastructure for training FMs, reducing training time by up to 40%.</p><p>SageMaker HyperPod offers persistent clusters with built-in resiliency, while also offering deep infrastructure control by allowing users to SSH into the underlying <a href=\"http://aws.amazon.com/ec2\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud</a> (Amazon EC2) instances. It helps efficiently scale model development and deployment tasks such as training, fine-tuning, or inference across a cluster of hundreds or thousands of AI accelerators, while reducing the operational heavy lifting involved in managing such clusters. As AI moves towards deployment adopting to a multitude of domains and use cases, the need for flexibility and control is becoming more pertinent. Large enterprises want to make sure the GPU clusters follow the organization-wide policies and security rules. Mission-critical AI/ML workloads often require specialized environments that align with the organization’s software stack and operational standards.</p><p>SageMaker HyperPod supports <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/eks/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service</a> (Amazon EKS) and offers two new features that enhance this control and flexibility to enable production deployment of large-scale ML workloads:</p><ul><li> – SageMaker HyperPod now supports continuous provisioning, which enhances cluster scalability through features like partial provisioning, rolling updates, concurrent scaling operations, and continuous retries when launching and configuring your HyperPod cluster.</li><li>– You can now use custom <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/AMIs.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Amazon Machine Images</a> (AMIs), which enables the preconfiguration of software stacks, security agents, and proprietary dependencies that would otherwise require complex post-launch bootstrapping. Customers can create custom AMIs using the HyperPod public AMI as a base and install additional software required to meet their organization’s specific security and compliance requirements.</li></ul><p>In this post, we dive deeper into each of these features.</p><p>The new continuous provisioning feature in SageMaker HyperPod represents a transformative advancement for organizations running intensive ML workloads, delivering unprecedented flexibility and operational efficiency that accelerates AI innovation. This feature provides the following benefits:</p><ul><li> – SageMaker HyperPod prioritizes delivering the maximum possible number of instances without failure. You can start running your workload while your cluster will attempt to provision the remaining instances.</li><li> – SageMaker HyperPod supports simultaneous scaling and maintenance activities (such as scale up, scale down, and patching) on a single instance group waiting for previous operations to complete.</li><li> – SageMaker HyperPod persistently attempts to fulfill the user’s request until it encounters a  error from where recovery is not possible.</li><li><strong>Increased customer visibility</strong> – SageMaker HyperPod maps customer-initiated and service-initiated operations to structured activity streams, providing real-time status updates and detailed progress tracking.</li></ul><p>For ML teams facing tight deadlines and resource constraints, this means dramatically reduced wait times and the ability to begin model training and deployment with whatever computing power is immediately available, while the system works diligently in the background to provision remaining requested resources.</p><h3>Implement continuous provisioning in a SageMaker HyperPod cluster</h3><p>The architecture introduces an intuitive yet powerful parameter that puts scaling strategy control directly in your hands: .

OpenAI’s release of GPT-OSS-120B and GPT-OSS-20B—their first “open-weight” models—was met with a frenzy of posts and hot takes. But were we genuinely excited about the models’ merits, or simply starstruck by the OpenAI brand? It’s a distinctly 2025 tech debate: how much of the buzz boils down to branding and perception rather than breakthrough innovation?\n\n\n\nIn this piece, we’ll dig into the reactions from Reddit, Hacker News, X (formerly Twitter), LinkedIn, and tech forums to see how people are talking about GPT-OSS. The responses range from cynical (“it’s all hype”) to hopeful (“at least it gets more people into local AI”). The tone will be smart, a bit irreverent, and well-researched – channeling the vibes of a Casey Newton or Kara Swisher column on HackerNoon. Let’s unpack what everyone’s saying about OpenAI’s open-source moment and what it reveals about branding, perception, and corporate influence in AI.\n\n\n\nReddit Reacts: “Just Hype – or a Helpful Push?”\nOver on /r/LocalLLaMA, the question of OpenAI’s influence lit up an intense discussion. Many redditors argued that GPT-OSS is riding on OpenAI’s name more than anything. The original poster, chunkypenguion1991, didn’t mince words about the new models’ quality:\n\n“They are worse at coding than Qwen 32B, more hallucinations than Fyre Festival, and seem trained only to pass benchmarks. If any other company released this, it would be a shoulder shrug… If it wasn’t for the OpenAI name behind it, would it get this much hype?” — chunkypenguion1991reddit.com\n\n\n\nThe skepticism was echoed by others in the thread. User NinjaK3ys couldn’t understand the excitement, complaining “I don't understand why such hype for the OpenAI OSS models… Geezz.” and the OP dryly replied, “$$$ that’s why”reddit.comreddit.com. Another commenter saw a concerted publicity effort behind the scenes:\n\n“OpenAI was milking the OSS for months, starting from the announcement in Spring. I wonder if they needed it for some kind of compliance with investors, government grants, etc.” — No-Refrigerator-1672reddit.com\n\n\n\nIn other words, some in the community suspect the hype is manufactured, a savvy PR move to satisfy stakeholders or redirect the open-source narrative. From this perspective, the GPT-OSS models themselves are fine – but not spectacular enough to warrant the hoopla, if not for the OpenAI logo on the tin. As one redditor put it bluntly when asked if we’d care about GPT-OSS from another source:\n\n“No.” — rookan\n\n\n\nYet, not everyone on Reddit was cynical. A number of users defended the value of OpenAI’s involvement – if only because it shines a bigger spotlight on local AI development. LevianMcBirdo argued that OpenAI’s brand has dramatically expanded awareness of this tech:\n\n“Of course it wouldn’t get the same hype if some company mostly unknown to the public released the same models… The public often only thinks of OpenAI when thinking about generative AI. I’m not sure 50% of adults could even name another company… So in that sense, OpenAI helped the scene a lot.” — LevianMcBirdo reddit.com\n\n\n\nOthers noted that an OpenAI release, even a mediocre one, can serve as a gateway drug for newcomers to local models. PicklesLLM shared a supportive take, viewing GPT-OSS as a Trojan horse for AI hobbyists:\n\n“Honestly I kind of agree [it’s overhyped]. But the reason this is big is because it’s an LLM a lot more people are familiar with. This will encourage more people to actually get into the local model route… I feel the excitement isn’t so much about the LLM itself, but the expansion of people new to this hobby… They only trusted ChatGPT for the longest time, but now… they’re getting more open to it because I can download the 20B model on their own PCs.” — PicklesLLM reddit.comreddit.com\n\n\n\nFrom this vantage point, OpenAI’s cachet is opening doors. Sure, GPT-OSS might not top every benchmark (some redditors pointed out it “doesn’t perform well on qualitative benchmarks and [is] not even comparable to Qwen-3 30B”reddit.com). But having the ChatGPT-maker endorse local models lends legitimacy that could grow the community. It’s a classic case of Big Tech hype trickling down to benefit the little guys. As ComprehensiveJury509 noted, people in the thread wanted to see OpenAI fail, but in truth the models are “very solid… for their weight classes” (only ~5B parameters active):\n\n“Hype? I’d say there is a lot of negativity here that feels forced. People in this community really want it to bomb, so they focus on all the stuff that isn’t good… I dislike OpenAI with a passion myself, but I don’t think these are mediocre models. They are very solid models for their weight classes… yet people compare them to beefier models all the time.” — ComprehensiveJury509 reddit.comreddit.com\n\n\n\nIn short, the Reddit verdict was divided. The critics see brand-driven hype and a perhaps cynical ploy by OpenAI to placate calls for open-source (“it just seems like OpenAI released some crappy model so we would shut up about open source. But it’s crap,” the OP quippedreddit.com). The defenders see an opportunity: OpenAI’s hype machine, however off-putting, is at least bringing more mainstream attention to local AI and “democratizing” access in a way smaller players couldn’t. Reddit’s take crystallized the core debate: is GPT-OSS a breakthrough or just a branding exercise?\n\n\n\nHacker News Weighs In: Don’t Treat Companies Like “Sports Teams”\nOver on Hacker News, discussions about GPT-OSS struck a slightly different tone – more technical, but with a healthy dose of skepticism about the hype. In a thread about OpenAI’s announcement, one user pointed out that nothing about GPT-OSS’s design was revolutionary; it’s mostly a clever layering of known techniques (Mixture-of-Experts, etc.) rather than new magic. But the more colorful commentary zeroed in on the fanboyism and branding aura. As one HN commenter littlestymaar admonished the community:“It would be great if people stopped acting as if those billion-dollar corporations were sports teams.” — littlestymaar news.ycombinator.com\n\n\n\nThat zinger speaks volumes. The poster was pushing back on reflexive tribalism – the tendency to cheer for OpenAI or Meta or whomever as if they can do no wrong. HN readers often pride themselves on cutting through marketing, and some did just that. User codelion, for instance, dryly noted that OpenAI’s “open” models were deliberately conservative in design: “It is by design. OpenAI is not going to reveal any architectural innovation they have made in their own commercial models.” — codelion news.ycombinator.com\n\n\n\nIn other words, if you expected GPT-OSS to be some secret-sauce GPT-4, you’d be mistaken – OpenAI played it safe, perhaps to avoid giving away any proprietary edge. This aligns with an analysis by AI blogger Sean Goedecke, who speculated that OpenAI trained GPT-OSS on heavily filtered (even synthetic) data to avoid the model misbehaving. Why? Because once an open-weight model is out in the wild, people can fine-tune or uncensor it in ways OpenAI can’t control. “Unlike Meta, [OpenAI doesn’t] need their open-source model to be actually good, because their main business is their closed-source models,” Goedecke wrote, arguing the release was more about optics and reclaiming narrative than technical supremacy seangoedecke.comseangoedecke.com.\n\n\n\nThat view—that OpenAI’s open-weight release was a strategic token, not a leap in AI—resonated on HN. Several users noted that truly, the excitement was tempered. “If this were any other company, there might have been a couple of posts and then quickly forgotten,” admitted DeltaSqueezer on HN, comparing GPT-OSS’s brief moment of fame to smaller-model launches that come and go reddit.com. \n\n\n\nThe implication: OpenAI’s name boosted GPT-OSS onto front pages, but time will tell if the models have staying power once the novelty wears off. Good luck finding anyone discussing GPT-OSS six months from now if it doesn’t prove genuinely useful; the internet’s attention is fickle, brand or not.\n\nAt the same time, a few HN commenters saw a silver lining similar to Reddit’s optimists: OpenAI’s move validated open models. “This move validates the growing influence of the open-source ecosystem,” tech writer Ben Dickson noted, given it comes after a surge of open models from others bdtechtalks.combdtechtalks.com. \n\n\n\nOpenAI lending its prestige to Apache-licensed models could be read as a win for the open-source movement (or as OpenAI bowing to pressure from it). The Internet delved into the “what is ‘open’ really?” debate. A top HN comment debated whether releasing weights with an Apache license but an extra usage policy truly counts as open source. “Is it even valid to have additional restrictions on top of Apache 2.0?” asked user maxloh, pointing out the fine print in OpenAI’s GPT-OSS usage policy news.ycombinator.comnews.ycombinator.com. \n\n\n\nThe consensus among the HN greybeards was that OpenAI’s offering is “open-weight” rather than fully open-source – a meaningful distinction for the purists. The training data and methodology remain a black box, so some transparency is gained, but not all. As one HackerNoon article would later put it, “Open weights mean you can download and run the model, but you cannot necessarily understand how it was trained… It only offers partial transparency.”hackernoon.com\n\n\n\nIn summary, Hacker News’ perspective added nuance: Yes, OpenAI’s brand turbocharged interest in GPT-OSS – but HN posters were quick to analyze the strategic motives behind that move. Don’t be a cheerleader, they warned; judge the tech on its merits and be aware of what’s not being open-sourced (pretty much everything except the weights).\n\n\n\nThe X Factor: Twitter Cheers and Jeers\nOn X (formerly Twitter), the reaction to GPT-OSS was predictably fast-paced and polarized. Some AI enthusiasts on X greeted the OpenAI open models with unbridled excitement – almost surprise. For example, Zeming Lin (@ebetica), an AI researcher, could barely contain his enthusiasm at what GPT-OSS achieved and who it came from:“gpt-oss is out! we made an open model that performs at the level of o4-mini and runs on a high-end laptop (WTF!!)” — Zeming Lin (ebetica) x.com\n\n\n\nThe “WTF!!” pretty much captures it – even a seasoned insider was amazed that an open-weight model from OpenAI could run on a single GPU and still match a pared-down GPT-4 variant on performance. This is the kind of hype that branding + genuine achievement can spark: OpenAI managed to surprise people who thought the company was forever wed to giant cloud-bound models. There was a sense of “I can’t believe OpenAI did this, but wow, it’s cool.” On the flip side, other Twitter users took OpenAI to task for the contrast between hype and reality. Tech commentator Ben Olney noted that the flagship GPT-5 model (released almost simultaneously) was falling short in his experience, even as OpenAI’s marketing was in overdrive: “GPT-5 is hallucinating more often than not for me… It’s a bit of a concern given the hype OpenAI have given it. I’m actually getting better results from GPT-OSS.” — Ben Olney (@Olney1Ben) twitter.comx.com\n\n\n\nHere we have an interesting twist: OpenAI’s smaller open model outperformed its heavily hyped closed model (GPT-5) on certain tasks, at least for one user. The subtext of Olney’s tweet is a critique of OpenAI’s hype machine – they talked up GPT-5 as the next big thing, yet a freely available model is serving him better for general knowledge. It’s a reminder that sometimes the new shiny object (GPT-5) isn’t strictly better in practice than the less-heralded alternative. And because GPT-OSS came with lower expectations (and less pressure), users might actually be delighted when it performs decently. GPT-5, by contrast, shoulders sky-high expectations (thanks to OpenAI’s own branding) and thus faces harsher judgment for any flaw.\n\n\n\nTwitter, being Twitter, also saw its share of memery and polarized takes. Some users joked that OpenAI open-sourcing models was a sign the “end times” were near (tongue-in-cheek referencing OpenAI’s past reluctance to open source). Others debated the ethics: a few X posters echoed the Reddit sentiment that OpenAI was using the community as unpaid testers and “free labor” to improve safety, by releasing an aligned model and watching folks try to jailbreak it reddit.com. In the words of one Reddit user, “they just want to see if people can make it unlocked… Which they will simply use… to make a ‘safer’ model.” reddit.com That cynical view found traction on X as well, where distrust of corporate motives runs deep.\n\n\n\nOverall, X showcased the two extremes of perception: the fanboy-ish awe at OpenAI’s move (because it was a surprise to see them release something under Apache license), and the skeptical side-eye at how the models actually perform versus the hype narrative. As always on social media, reality lies somewhere between the extremes – but the branding of OpenAI ensured that everyone had an opinion, one way or another.\n\n\n\nLinkedIn and the Corporate Embrace of GPT-OSS\n\n\nIf Reddit and Hacker News represent the grassroots and Twitter the hype cycle, LinkedIn gives us the corporate angle – and it did not disappoint. As soon as GPT-OSS dropped, tech executives and enterprise teams jumped on LinkedIn to highlight integrations and business use cases. The subtext was clear: OpenAI’s brand carries weight in boardrooms, not just forums, and companies were eager to associate themselves with the GPT-OSS launch.\n\n\n\nA prime example came from Microsoft’s ranks. On August 5, a Microsoft program manager proudly posted:“Excited to bring OpenAI’s gpt-oss models to Azure AI Foundry and to Windows via Foundry Local. It’s hybrid AI in action: mix and match models, optimize for performance and cost, and meet your data where it lives.” — Microsoft Azure AI team member, on LinkedIn news.microsoft.com\n\n\n\nThe tone here is all optimism: GPT-OSS is portrayed as an enabler of “hybrid AI” strategies. In plain speak, Microsoft is saying: Hey, we can run these OpenAI open models on-premises or on Windows devices as well as in the cloud. For enterprise customers worried about data residency or wanting to avoid solely closed APIs, that’s a selling point. OpenAI’s brand name plus open-source flexibility equals a marketing win. It’s not hard to imagine CTOs nodding along to this LinkedIn post – after all, it promises the best of both worlds (OpenAI innovation and self-hosting).\n\n\n\nOther LinkedIn voices from companies like AWS and Dell quickly chimed in with their own takes. AWS wrote a blog (and surely a LinkedIn update) touting that GPT-OSS models were immediately available on Amazon Bedrock and SageMaker for developers to deployaws.amazon.com. Dell Technologies put out a note about bringing GPT-OSS to customers, framing it as part of the “expansion of the open-source AI ecosystem” (and gently plugging a Dell + Hugging Face partnership in the same breath) dell.com. The enterprise world, in short, embraced GPT-OSS as an opportunity: to sell hardware, cloud services, or enterprise solutions that leverage these models.\n\n\n\nOne striking aspect is how differently the LinkedIn crowd talks about GPT-OSS compared to the skeptics on Reddit. On LinkedIn, there’s no hand-wringing about hallucination rates or censorship guardrails – instead, it’s all “excited to bring this to you” and “new options to build AI applications with complete control” aws.amazon.com. The focus is on the positive: more choices for customers, validation that open models are enterprise-ready because hey, OpenAI made them. Branding here serves a trust function. A year ago, a random 120B open model from some startup might not even be considered by a conservative company. But an open 120B model from OpenAI, announced on LinkedIn by Microsoft? That’s immediately on the evaluation list.\n\n\n\nOf course, there’s a bit of irony. The same features that some community folks criticized (like GPT-OSS being heavily filtered and aligned for safety) are selling points in the corporate context. Businesses want safe, “censored” models that won’t spew off-brand content. As one Redditor, Cool-Chemical-5629, cynically noted: “If it was made by a different company, I’d care more, because there would always be a chance for improvement… With OpenAI that option is pretty much zero… they wouldn’t release such an otherworldly censored model in the first place.” reddit.com. That comment drips with frustration that OpenAI’s model is locked-down. But for LinkedIn’s audience, OpenAI’s “otherworldly censored” approach is a feature, not a bug – it means the model is less likely to go off the rails in a corporate setting. This dichotomy highlights how the reception of a model is shaped by the audience’s priorities: open-source enthusiasts crave raw, tweakable power (and thus chafe at too much safety filtering), whereas enterprises and lay users might prefer a model that’s “safe out of the box,” even at the cost of some creativity.\n\n\n\nIn sum, LinkedIn responses underscore that OpenAI’s brand lent GPT-OSS immediate enterprise credibility. The model launch became a talking point in cloud and AI product circles, not just an experiment on GitHub. Branding and corporate influence didn’t just shape community reception – they practically created a secondary wave of hype in the enterprise realm, distinct from the developer forums. And unlike the meme-filled Twitter takes, the LinkedIn tone was earnest and all-business: this is good for customers, this justifies our AI strategy, this is hybrid AI in action. It’s a reminder that OpenAI, with one foot in research and one in industry, has audiences in both – and it adeptly spoke to each.\n\n\n\nOpenAI’s Image vs. Reality: Perspectives from Tech Media\n\n\nBeyond the forums and social feeds, tech writers and analysts have been parsing what GPT-OSS means for OpenAI’s image. A piece in HackerNoon by Ishan Pandey asked pointedly in its title: “Is GPT-OSS Really Open? Inside OpenAI’s Most Transparent Model Yet.” The verdict was cautiously optimistic but clear that OpenAI’s move is a tactical pivot, not a change of heart. In an interview within that article, Michael Heinrich, CEO of 0G Labs, applauded the step toward transparency while noting its limits: “OpenAI’s release of these open-weight models is a step towards democratizing AI that echoes the spirit of innovation that drove early breakthroughs like GPT-2… It’s a sign that bigger is not always better when it comes to AI models.” — Michael Heinrich (0G Labs) hackernoon.com\n\n\n\nHeinrich’s take captures the hopeful angle: smaller, open models running on consumer hardware do fulfill some of the original “OpenAI” ethos (back when the company’s name wasn’t an oxymoron). It shows an acknowledgment that progress in AI isn’t solely about giant parameter counts locked behind APIs – there’s value in accessible models. This sentiment certainly would make the community happy if it’s genuine. But Heinrich also cautioned that OpenAI’s openness only goes so far: the weights are out, yet “critical elements [are] still hidden behind closed doors: the training data, methodology, and full documentation… many are concerned it only offers partial transparency.” hackernoon.com In other words, GPT-OSS is open, but not that open. Pandey’s HackerNoon piece ultimately concluded that OpenAI’s move felt “more tactical than philosophical,” aimed at answering competitive pressure from truly open models like Meta’s LLaMA or Mistral, and at appeasing calls for transparency without actually open-sourcing their crown jewels hackernoon.com. Heinrich concluded with a bit of a dare for OpenAI’s future: “It’s a step in the right direction… but there’s a lot more that must be done before OpenAI can be regarded as living up to its name and genuinely advancing open access to AI.” — Michael Heinrich hackernoon.com\n\n\n\nThat line “living up to its name” cuts to the heart. OpenAI’s very moniker has drawn eye-rolls in recent years as the company kept its best models proprietary. GPT-OSS is, arguably, the first thing in a while that actually honors the “Open” in OpenAI – and even then, with caveats. The community and industry are essentially holding OpenAI’s feet to the fire: Okay, you made a move toward openness; now, will you continue down this path or was it a one-off?\n\n\n\nIn plainer terms, branding and corporate influence aren’t just shaping community reception – they likely shaped the very decision to release GPT-OSS in the first place. OpenAI’s brand was turning from an asset into a target (“you’re not really open, are you?”); this release helps recalibrate that perception. It’s a reminder that companies at OpenAI’s level carefully cultivate their image in the AI world. The community’s cynical questions (“are they doing it for free labor or PR?”) might have some truth in them, but it’s also true that the release provides tangible value (researchers get new models, companies get new tools). Both can be real: OpenAI can genuinely contribute and burnish its brand at the same time.\n\n\n\nPerception and Reception of GPT-OSS\n\n\nSo, if GPT-OSS had been released by “SomeRandom AI Labs” instead of OpenAI, would anyone care? The consensus from our tour of the internet’s reaction is: Not nearly as much – and that’s revealing. OpenAI’s brand brought an unparalleled level of attention (and scrutiny) to these models. That attention was double-edged. On one hand, it magnified criticism – every shortcoming was picked apart by a community eager to prove they wouldn’t be swayed by a big name. On the other hand, it also amplified the excitement and adoption – enterprises and newcomers gave the models a chance precisely because of the OpenAI halo. Branding created the initial hype wave, but the community is now busy sifting substance from spin.\n\n\n\nPerception matters in tech, sometimes as much as reality. OpenAI leveraged its perception as the AI leader to ensure GPT-OSS wasn’t ignored (mission accomplished there). Yet it also had to carefully manage its image: by making the models just good enough to be credible, and just safe enough to avoid a PR disaster. It’s a delicate balance of hype and humility. As one Hacker News user wryly observed, OpenAI’s fans and critics often treat the company like a football team, cheering or jeering every move news.ycombinator.com. The GPT-OSS episode shows how that fandom (and brand antagonism) can shape the narrative around a technology independent of its technical merits.\n\n\n\nIn the end, how the GPT-OSS models will be used (or not) six months from now will tell us more. Will they empower a thriving open-source AI ecosystem, or fade out as just another benchmark-chaser? Will OpenAI double down on this open-weight approach, or was it a one-off concession? The community has made one thing clear: they’ll judge the models – and OpenAI – by results, not just reputation. But for better or worse, it was the OpenAI name that got everyone through the door and talking in the first place. Branding set the stage; performance will determine the encore.\n\n\n\nAs Michael Heinrich put it, it’s a good step, but there’s more to do for OpenAI to live up to its name. Until then, the debate rages on. In the world of AI models, who made it can sometimes overshadow what it does – and GPT-OSS is our latest case study in that truth. Whether you’re a skeptic or a fan, the conversation around GPT-OSS shows that open-source AI doesn’t live in a vacuum; it lives in an environment shaped by corporate clout, community values, and the ever-swirling winds of hype. And as any seasoned HackerNoon writer might quip: in this AI game, hype may get you noticed, but only substance will keep you relevant once the crowd moves on to the next big thing.\nChatGPT said:\nHere's your 1560-character version (including spaces) – great for a LinkedIn post, blog excerpt, or newsletter intro:\n\nWould Anyone Care if OpenAI Didn’t Make GPT-OSS?\n\nWhen OpenAI released its first “open-weight” models—GPT-OSS-120B and GPT-OSS-20B—the internet lit up. But Redditors asked a blunt question: Would anyone care if these models came from a no-name lab? The buzz felt more about branding than breakthroughs. Some praised OpenAI for spotlighting local AI, others slammed it as hype with little innovation.\n\nOn Reddit, critiques ranged from “they’re worse than Qwen” to “$$$ that’s why,” while optimists noted it could bring new users into the open-source fold. Hacker News was more analytical, dissecting how OpenAI revealed just enough to look generous while protecting its secrets. Twitter (X) had its mix of memes, excitement, and distrust. LinkedIn? All-in. Enterprises jumped to integrate, seeing “hybrid AI” opportunities and OpenAI’s brand as an instant validator.\n\nIn truth, GPT-OSS is fine—but the OpenAI name made it a moment. Whether it's a branding exercise or a bridge to more accessible AI, GPT-OSS proves one thing: in 2025, who makes the model matters as much as what it does.\n\nAnd here's a tighter under-400-character version, ideal for social captions:\n\nGPT-OSS is here—but would anyone care if OpenAI hadn’t made it?

Or wanted them to perform actions on your behalf? Think of those scenarios where you’re working with <a href=\"https://github.com/features/copilot?utm_campaign=rdt-blog-devrel&amp;utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=copilot-landing-page\">GitHub Copilot</a> and you need it to check a GitHub Issue, run a Playwright test, or interact with an API. By default, these AI tools lack access to those external systems. But that’s where the <a href=\"https://github.blog/ai-and-ml/generative-ai/a-practical-guide-on-how-to-use-the-github-mcp-server/\">Model Context Protocol (MCP)</a> comes in. It’s a standardized way to extend AI tools with custom capabilities.&nbsp;</p><p>I wanted to learn more about it by building something visual and interactive. So I created a turn-based game server that lets you play Tic-Tac-Toe and Rock Paper Scissors against Copilot using MCP.</p><p>In my latest  live stream, I walked through the project, which has a few components, all written in TypeScript:</p><ul><li>A Next.JS Web App and API, intended to run locally for demo/learning purposes</li><li>A shared library for common type definitions and components, which are reused across the web app, API, and MCP server</li></ul><p><em>You can watch the full stream below </em>👇</p><h2>Why MCP matters for developers</h2><p>Even with powerful AI agents, we continue to run into limitations:</p><ul><li>They don’t have access to the latest documentation or real-time data.</li><li>Agents can’t perform actions like creating pull requests, exploring the UI on your locally running application, or interact with your APIs.</li></ul><p>To access external context and take action, we need to extend the capabilities of these AI tools. But before MCP, there was no standard approach to integrating with third-party tools and services. You’d potentially need different plugins and different integration patterns for whatever AI tool you were using. MCP changes that by providing  to plug tools and capabilities into any tool that supports the Model Context Protocol.</p><p>MCP follows a client-server pattern that’s familiar to most developers:</p><ul><li> The AI tool you’re using, like GitHub Copilot in VS Code (you’ll notice that Copilot in VS Code has good support in the <a href=\"https://modelcontextprotocol.io/clients#feature-support-matrix\">MCP feature support matrix</a>). The host initiates the connection to your MCP server via a client.</li><li>Clientslive inside the host application (for example, GitHub Copilot in VS Code), and have a 1:1 relationship with a server. When VS Code connects to a new MCP server (like GitHub, Playwright or the turn-based-game MCP server we’re talking about in this post), a new client is created to maintain the connection.</li><li>: Your custom MCP server that provides tools, resources, and prompts. In our case, we’re making an MCP server that provides capabilities for playing turn-based games!&nbsp;</li></ul><h2>Building the turn-based game MCP server</h2><p>For my learning project, I wanted something visual that would show the overall MCP interaction and could be reused when people are trying to explain it as part of a talk. So I built a web app with Tic-Tac-Toe and Rock Paper Scissors. But instead of the game having two people play locally (or online), or even a CPU in the backend, the opponent’s moves are orchestrated by an MCP server.</p><p>The architecture includes:</p><ul><li>: The game interface where I make moves</li><li><strong>API routes (part of the Next.js implementation)</strong>: Backend logic for game state management, called by the frontend and the MCP server.</li><li>: TypeScript server that handles AI game moves</li><li>: Common game logic used across components</li></ul><p>Here’s how it works in practice:</p><ol><li>We register an MCP server in VS Code so that Copilot is aware of the new capabilities and tools.</li><li>I interact with GitHub Copilot in VS Code. I can call tools explicitly, or Copilot can autodiscover them.</li><li>Copilot calls the large language model. Based on the prompt context and the available tools, it may call the MCP server.</li><li>The MCP server executes the requested tool (like making a move in the game) and returns results.</li><li>Copilot uses those results to continue the conversation.</li></ol><p>The magic step is when you register the MCP server with an MCP application host (in our example, GitHub Copilot in Visual Studio Code). Suddenly, your AI agent gains access to the capabilities that have been built into those servers.</p><h3>Setting up the MCP server in VS Code</h3><p>You can configure your MCP servers by creating a  file. You can find more details about that on the <a href=\"https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/chat/mcp-servers#_add-an-mcp-server-to-your-workspace?utm_campaign=rdt-blog-devrel&amp;utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=vscode-docs-mcp-setup\">Visual Studio Code docs</a>.</p><pre><code>{\n  \"servers\": {\n    \"playwright\": {\n      \"command\": \"npx\",\n      \"args\": [\n        \"@playwright/mcp@latest\"\n      ]\n    },\n    \"turn-based-games\": {\n      \"command\": \"node\",\n      \"args\": [\"dist/index.js\"],\n      \"cwd\": \"./mcp-server\"\n    }\n  }\n}</code></pre><p>The above configuration tells GitHub Copilot in VS Code that there are two MCP servers that we’d like to use:</p><ul><li>A Playwright MCP server that is executed locally as an NPM package.</li><li>A turn-based-games MCP server that runs a server locally based on the compiled TypeScript code from our working directory.</li></ul><p>For this implementation, I kept my turn-based-game MCP server architecture and logic relatively simple, with all components in a single repository. This monorepo approach bundles the web app, API, and MCP server together, making it straightforward to clone and run the entire system locally without complex dependency management or cross-repository setup. But for a more robust setup, you would likely distribute that MCP server either as a package (such as npm or a docker image), and have clear publishing and versioning processes around that.&nbsp;</p><h2>The three core building blocks of MCP</h2><p>Through building this project, I familiarized myself with three fundamental MCP server concepts:</p><p><a href=\"https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/learn/server-concepts#tools-ai-actions\">Tools</a> define what actions the MCP server can perform. In my game server, I specified tools like:</p><ul><li>: Get the current state of any game</li><li><code>create_rock_paper_scissors_game</code>: Start a new game of Rock Paper Scissors</li><li>: Start a new Tic-Tac-Toe game</li><li>: Make an AI choice in Rock Paper Scissors</li><li>: Make an AI move in Tic-Tac-Toe</li><li>: Polls the endpoint until the player has made their move</li></ul><p>Each tool has a clear description and input schema that tells the AI what parameters to provide:</p><pre><code>{\n  name: 'play_tic_tac_toe',\n  description: 'Make an AI move in Tic-Tac-Toe game. IMPORTANT: After calling this tool when the game is still playing, you MUST call wait_for_player_move to continue the game flow.',\n  inputSchema: {\n    type: 'object',\n    properties: {\n      gameId: {\n        type: 'string',\n        description: 'The ID of the Tic-Tac-Toe game to play',\n      },\n    },\n    required: ['gameId'],\n  },\n},</code></pre><p>GitHub Copilot and the Large Language Model (LLM) aren’t calculating the actual game moves. When Copilot calls the play_tic_tac_toe tool, the MCP server executes a handler for that specific tool that runs the CPU game logic, like random moves for Tic Tac Toe in “easy” difficulty or a more optimal&nbsp; algorithm for moves when using the “hard” difficulty.</p><p>In other words, tools are reusable pieces of software that can be called by the AI, often to take some form of action (like making a move in a turn-based game!).</p><h3>2. Resources: Context your AI can access</h3><p><a href=\"https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/learn/server-concepts#resources-context-data\">Resources</a> provide a way for the AI to gather context, and often have a URI-based identifier. For example, I implemented custom URI schemes like:</p><ul><li>: List all Tic-Tac-Toe games</li><li><code>game://tic-tac-toe/{Game-ID}</code>: Get state for a specific game of Tic Tac Toe</li><li><code>game://rock-paper-scissors</code>: List all Rock Paper Scissors games</li><li><code>game://rock-paper-scissors/{Game-ID}</code>: Get state for a specific game of Rock Paper Scissors</li></ul><p>As the <a href=\"https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/learn/server-concepts#resources-context-data\">MCP resources docs</a> explain, you can choose how these resources are passed. In our turn-based-game MCP server, there is a method that translates the resource URIs into an API call to the local API server and passes on the raw response, so that it can be used as context within a tool call (like playing a game).</p><pre><code>async function readGameResource(uri) {\n  const gameSession = await callBackendAPI(gameType, gameId);\n  if (!gameSession) {\n    throw new Error(\"Game not found\");\n  }\n  return gameSession;\n}</code></pre><h3>3. Prompts: Reusable guidance for users</h3><p>The third concept is <a href=\"https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/learn/server-concepts#prompts-interaction-templates\">prompts</a>. You’ll be very familiar with prompts and prompt crafting, as that’s the way that you interact with AI tools like GitHub Copilot. Your users could write their own prompts to use your tools, like “Play a game of Tic Tac Toe” or “Create a GitHub Issue for the work that we’ve just scoped out.”</p><p>But you may want to ship your MCP server with predefined prompts that help users get the most out of your tools. For example, the turn-based-game MCP comes with several prompts like:</p><ul><li>Strategy guides for different difficulty levels</li><li>Game rules and optimal play instructions</li><li>Troubleshooting help for common scenarios</li></ul><p>Your users can access these prompts via slash commands in VS Code. For example, when I typed , I could access the prompt asking for advice on optimal play for a given game or difficulty level.</p><h2>Real-world applications and considerations</h2><p>While my game demo is intentionally simple to help you learn some of these initial concepts, the patterns apply to other MCP servers:</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://github.com/github/github-mcp-server?utm_campaign=rdt-blog-devrel&amp;utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=github-mcp-server-repo\"></a>: Get information from existing GitHub Issues or pull requests, list Dependabot alerts, or create and manage issues and pull requests, all based on the access you provide via OAuth (in the remote MCP server) or a Personal Access Token.</li><li><a href=\"https://github.com/microsoft/playwright-mcp\"></a>: Automatically navigate to specific pages in a browser, click and interact with the pages, capture screenshots, and check rendered content.</li><li>: Connect to your internal services, databases, or business logic.</li></ul><h3>Additional capabilities from the MCP specification</h3><p>Tools, resources, and prompts are some of the most commonly used capabilities of the MCP specification. Recently, a number of additional capabilities including sampling and elicitation were added to the spec. I haven’t had a chance to add those yet, but perhaps they’ll feature as part of another stream!</p><h3>Authentication and security</h3><p>You may need to handle authentication and authorization for production MCP servers depending on the scenario. As an example, the GitHub MCP server supports OAuth flows for the remote MCP server and Personal Access Tokens in local and remote. This turn-based game MCP server is intended to be simple, and doesn’t include any auth requirements, but security should be a key consideration if you’re building your own MCP servers.</p><h3>Trusting third-party MCP servers</h3><p>You may not always need to create your own MCP server. For example, GitHub ships its own MCP server. Instead of creating your own version, why not make an open source contribution upstream to improve the experience for all?</p><p>Make sure to do your due diligence on MCP servers before installing them, just like you would with any other dependency as part of your project’s supply chain. Do you recognise the publisher? Are you able to review (and contribute to) the code in an open source repository?</p><p>MCP provides SDKs <a href=\"https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/sdk\">for multiple languages</a>, so you can build servers in whatever technology fits your stack, ranging from TypeScript to Python, Go to Rust and more. I chose TypeScript because I wanted my entire demo (frontend, backend, and MCP server) in one repository with shared code and a common language.</p><p>Here’s what you can learn from this exploration:</p><ul><li><strong>MCP standardizes AI tool extensibility</strong> across different platforms and applications (like Copilot in Visual Studio Code)</li><li> by investigating what existing MCP servers are available. Review the MCP servers: Do you recognize the publisher and can you access the code?</li><li><strong>Building your own? Start simple</strong> with focused servers that solve specific problems rather than trying to build everything at once</li><li><strong>The three building blocks</strong> (tools, resources, prompts) provide a clear framework for designing the capabilities of your MCP server</li></ul><p>MCP isn’t just about playing games with AI (though that was fun). It’s about breaking down the walls between your AI assistants and the systems they need to help you work effectively.&nbsp;</p><p>Whether you’re building internal developer tools, integrating with external APIs, or creating custom workflows, MCP provides the foundation you need to extend your AI tools in consistent, powerful ways.</p><p>Want to explore MCP further?

There’s no way it wouldn’t, not when ICE was sending out a task force composed of multiple federal law enforcement agencies daily to multiple locations in the United States, hoping to finally hit the baseline number of 3,000 arrests per day by Stephen Miller. </p><p>A massive increase in interactions was bound to result in an increase in alleged assaults. The surprising fact, however, was that the increase was so . To hear the DHS tell it, ICE officers are being beaten to the ground daily, with spokespeople constantly posting eye-popping stats like a 690% increase in assaults. (Since then, the percentage has increased to nearly 1000%.)</p><p>But all that really meant — when the DHS decided to finally be honest about it — was that there had been <a href=\"https://www.techdirt.com/2025/07/02/assaults-on-ice-officers-are-up-700-which-just-means-there-have-been-69-more-assaults-than-last-year/\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"https://www.techdirt.com/2025/07/02/assaults-on-ice-officers-are-up-700-which-just-means-there-have-been-69-more-assaults-than-last-year/\"> more assaults</a> this year as compared to last year (79 to 10). And when you have the actual numbers, this supposed “war on ICE” looks more like ICE officers complaining a bit more than they did last year.</p><p>Well, ICE officers <a href=\"https://www.techdirt.com/2025/06/09/trump-ice-have-earned-every-bit-of-the-hatred-theyre-now-facing/\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"https://www.techdirt.com/2025/06/09/trump-ice-have-earned-every-bit-of-the-hatred-theyre-now-facing/\">brought it on themselves</a>. Their insistence on wearing masks, stripping themselves of identifying badges, driving unmarked vehicles, hanging around in courtroom hallways, chasing day laborers across Home Deport parking lots, lurking in rented moving vans, etc. all but ensured there would be the occasional violent reaction to the sudden appearance of masked kidnappers who somehow can’t manage to obtain the occasional judicial warrant. </p><p>The DHS is relying on its ever-increasing percentage to sell this skewed narrative. Unfortunately for ICE, DHS, and the DOJ, the narrative <a href=\"https://www.techdirt.com/2025/08/11/trump-doj-cant-score-ice-protest-convictions-because-federal-officers-keep-lying/\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"https://www.techdirt.com/2025/08/11/trump-doj-cant-score-ice-protest-convictions-because-federal-officers-keep-lying/\">isn’t holding up in court</a>.

DC US attorney, former Fox talking head Jeanine Pirro, made the announcement, <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/usao-dc/pr/woman-who-tried-impede-transfer-alleged-gang-member-ice-custody-charged-assault-fbi\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"https://www.justice.gov/usao-dc/pr/woman-who-tried-impede-transfer-alleged-gang-member-ice-custody-charged-assault-fbi\">using these words to describe what (allegedly) occurred</a> during this so-called altercation: </p><blockquote><p><em>The FBI agent was assisting two ICE Enforcement and Removal Operations (ERO) officers outside the jail when Reid walked up close to the officers and started recording video. After multiple commands to step back, Reid tried to go around the ERO officers, placing herself between FBI agents and one of the suspects being transferred into their custody.</em></p><p><em>As Reid tried to impede the transfer, one of the ERO officers pushed her against the wall and told her to stop. Reid continued to struggle and fight with the officer. The FBI agent tried to help the officer control Reid who was flailing her arms and kicking. During Reid’s active resistance to being detained, <strong>the FBI agent’s hand was injured from striking and scraping the cement wall causing lacerations</strong> while the FBI agent was assisting ICE ERO officers</em>.</p></blockquote><p>LOL. Arm “flailing” is apparently assault, especially if an officer manages to  during the incident. This was enough for the DOJ to move forward with an attempt to secure an indictment from a grand jury. But it couldn’t even do that because the government seemingly isn’t interested in actually  its case in court — not even in front of a court that only needs to see probable cause, rather than the much higher “beyond a reasonable doubt” standard used by criminal courts. </p><p>Reid was charged with an enhanced felony assault charge, supposedly due to her “infliction of bodily injury” on the FBI agent who hurt themself while “assisting” ICE in arresting a person who began her interaction by doing nothing more harmful than simply filming them with her phone.</p><p>The DOJ has tried to indict Reid twice for this supposed “assault.” It has now failed twice, <a href=\"https://www.wusa9.com/article/news/crime/us-attorney-jeanine-pirros-office-admits-grand-jury-refused-charges-against-dc-woman-twice-sydney-reid-dc-jail/65-dc64747e-a8d4-4ad9-89e2-f6317f0fa2bd\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"https://www.wusa9.com/article/news/crime/us-attorney-jeanine-pirros-office-admits-grand-jury-refused-charges-against-dc-woman-twice-sydney-reid-dc-jail/65-dc64747e-a8d4-4ad9-89e2-f6317f0fa2bd\">as WUSA9 reports</a>.</p><blockquote><p><em>Federal prosecutors twice sought a grand jury indictment against a D.C. woman accused of assaulting an FBI agent during an ICE inmate transfer — and were twice rejected, the U.S. Attorney’s Office admitted in court Thursday.</em></p><p><em>Magistrate Judge G.

Almost zero effort was made here, which makes the double-denial completely understandable:</p><blockquote><p><em>Federal prosecutors declined to call the injured FBI agent or any of the ICE officers involved in the incident during Thursday’s hearing, however. Instead, <strong>they had an investigator with the U.S. Attorney’s Office testify about his review of video</strong> of the incident <strong>and brief conversations with the officers</strong>. The investigator, Special Agent <strong>Sean Ricardi, said he’d had no involvement in the case until he was asked to prepare for testimony Thursday morning</strong>.</em></p></blockquote><p>When the government says “it’s our word against yours,” that’s generally enough to make people understand they’re already going up against a stacked deck. When the government fails (repeatedly, in recent weeks) to secure indictments even when it’s their word against , it’s clear the government actually has no case to present. </p><p>It would be nice to see a revised percentage from the DHS that only utilizes  assault allegations that result in an indictment or conviction. But we’ll never see that sort of honesty from this administration, which relies almost solely on misrepresentations of  to push its narratives forward. There’s a war on Americans going on here, <a href=\"https://www.techdirt.com/2025/07/07/trump-budget-bill-turns-ice-into-a-superpredator/\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"https://www.techdirt.com/2025/07/07/trump-budget-bill-turns-ice-into-a-superpredator/\">led by a super-charged ICE</a>.

The conversation was about what we should say in this blog post, which obviously led us to try to remember everything that has happened in the last year. “I haven’t considered a thing beyond what’s been five seconds behind or in front of me for the last year,” Sam said.&nbsp;</p><p>The last year has been a whirlwind not just for us but for, uhh, the country and the world. And we’ve been trying our absolute best to bring you stories you can’t find anywhere else about the wildest shit happening right now, which includes the Silicon Valley-led dismantling of the federal government, the deployment of powerful surveillance against immigrants and people seeking abortions, the algorithmic, AI-led zombification of “social” media, the end of anonymity on the internet, and all sorts of weird stuff that we see on our travels through the internet. As Sam noted, we have largely had our heads down trying to bring you the best tech journalism on the internet, which hasn’t left us a ton of time to think about long-term projects, blue-sky ideas, or what the best business strategies for growing this company would be.&nbsp;</p><p>Our guiding principle is something we said we would do <a href=\"https://www.404media.co/welcome-to-404-media/\"><u>on day one of starting this company</u></a>: “We believe it is possible to create a sustainable, profitable media company simply by doing good work, making common-sense decisions about costs, and asking our readers to support us.” What we have learned in two years of building this company is that there is no secret to building a media company, and that there are also no shortcuts. When we work hard to publish an important article, more people discover us and more people subscribe to us, which helps solidify our business and allows us to do more and better articles. As our stories reach a larger audience, the articles often have more impact, more potential sources see them, and we get more tips, which leads to more and better articles, and so on.</p><p>In our second year as a media outlet, we’ve done too much impactful reporting to list out in this post. But to summarize some of the big ones:&nbsp;</p><p>On top of all of these, we’ve published some of the most moment-defining stories that, as Jason has said many times, are the types of things people talk about at the bar after work. Those include:</p><p>It has been a relief that this business strategy of “publish good articles and ask people to pay for journalism” still works, despite the fracturing of social media, the slopification of every major platform, AI being shoved into everything, and the rich and powerful trying to destroy journalism at every turn. That it is working is a testament to the support of our subscribers. We have no real way of knowing exactly where new subscribers come from or what ultimately led them to subscribe, but time and time again we have learned that the most important discovery mechanism we have is word of mouth. We have lost count of the number of times a new subscriber has said that they were told about 404 Media by a friend or a family member at a party or in a group text, so if you have told anyone about us, we sincerely thank you.</p><p>It wasn’t obvious when we started this company that it would actually work, though we hoped that it would.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.404media.co/what-we-learned-in-our-first-year-of-404-media/\"></a>, we wrote, “We don’t have any major second-year plans to announce just yet in part because we have been heads down working on some of the investigations and scoops you’ve seen in recent days. The next year holds more scoops, more investigations, more silly blogs, more experiments, more impact, and more articles that hold powerful companies and people to account. We remain ambitious and are thinking about how to best cover more topics and to give you more 404 Media without spreading ourselves too thin.”</p><p>But we did take a moment to think about what has changed in the last year, and it turns out that quite a lot is different now than it was a year ago.&nbsp;</p><p>For one, we have cautiously begun to expand what we do. In the last year, we launched <a href=\"https://www.404media.co/tag/the-abstract/\"></a>, which is Becky Ferreira’s Saturday newsletter about science, which many of you have said you love and which helps us provide a sense of wonder and discovery when so much of what we report on is pretty bleak. We have been getting part-time (but very critical) help from Case Harts who is running and growing our social media accounts, which is helping us put our stories more natively on Instagram, TikTok, YouTube, and other platforms that we do not control but which nonetheless remain important for us to be on. <a href=\"https://www.404media.co/author/matthew/\"></a> has started covering the <a href=\"https://www.404media.co/the-u-s-army-is-testing-ai-controlled-ground-drones-near-a-border-with-russia/\"><u>military industrial complex</u></a>, <a href=\"https://www.404media.co/trump-is-launching-an-ai-search-engine-powered-by-perplexity/\"></a>, <a href=\"https://www.404media.co/lawsuit-alleges-roblox-hosted-digital-diddy-freak-off-themed-games/\"></a>, and <a href=\"https://www.404media.co/4k-blu-ray-of-22-year-old-master-and-commander-is-sold-out-everywhere-being-scalped-on-ebay/\"></a> beat for us, and has done a remarkable job at it. <a href=\"https://www.404media.co/author/rosie/\"></a> is our current intern who has published critical reporting about the sale of <a href=\"https://www.404media.co/tiktok-shop-sells-viral-gps-trackers-marketed-to-stalkers/\"></a>, protests at the <a href=\"https://www.404media.co/living-next-to-tesla-diner-is-absolute-hell-neighbors-say/\"></a>, and the difficult decisions voice actors need to make about whether they should let <a href=\"https://www.404media.co/voiceover-artists-ai-voice-acting-jobs-microsoft-openai-chatgpt/\"></a>.</p><p>All of this has changed what 404 Media looks like, a little bit. We have spent a lot of time thinking about what it would look like to expand beyond this, why people subscribe to us, what it would mean to go further, and what the four of us are actually capable of handling outside of the journalism. Because of your support we are in a place where we’re able to ask questions beyond “Can we survive?” We’re able to ask questions like: “Should we try to make this bigger, and what does that look like?”&nbsp;</p><p>We feel incredibly lucky that we are now able to ask ourselves these questions, because there was no guarantee that 404 Media would ever work, and we are forever grateful to everyone who has supported us. You have helped us prove that this model can work, and every day we are delighted to see that other journalists are striking out on their own to create their own publications.</p><p>We are still DIYing lots of things. Emanuel is still doing customer support. Jason is still ordering, packing, and mailing merch. Sam is putting together events and parties. Joseph is doing an insane number of things behind the scenes, managing the podcast, working closely with one of our ad partners, and fixing technical issues. As we have grown, these tasks have started to take more and more time, which raises all sorts of questions about when and if we should get help with them. Should we do more events? Should we get someone to help us with them? What does that look like logistically and financially? These are the things that we’re working out all the time.

Si","guid":237009,"unread":true,"content":"<p>I have always been deeply inspired by the orchestration capabilities of Kubernetes. Over the years, many of the digital platforms I have designed and built were intentionally directed toward Kubernetes as the backbone — though always with careful consideration of context, to avoid making it overkill where simpler solutions would&nbsp;suffice.</p><p>That said, one area where Kubernetes reveals its true potential is in . The proliferation of IoT devices and the exponential growth of real-time data processing demands have reshaped the computing paradigm. While centralized cloud data centers remain critical, the need for ultra-low latency, bandwidth efficiency, and local autonomy has pushed workloads closer to where data is generated: the&nbsp;edge.</p><p>This shift introduces unique challenges — particularly when managing and updating thousands of heterogeneous, geographically distributed devices. Standard Kubernetes, while powerful, is inherently cloud-centric and often too heavy for resource-constrained edge environments.</p><p>This is where , an open-source CNCF project, comes in. It extends native Kubernetes capabilities to the edge, enabling orchestrated container workloads, data synchronization, and device lifecycle management. One of its most transformative features is its support for <strong>Over-the-Air (OTA) updates</strong> — a critical mechanism to ensure that containerized applications, edge runtimes, and even firmware on physical devices can be securely updated without manual intervention.</p><p>In this article, I want to share a deep, experience-based exploration of how KubeEdge enables OTA updates in practice. I will also include a , a , and a  highlighting pitfalls I have encountered and the mitigation strategies that work in real-world deployments.</p><h3>From Cloud-Centric to Edge-Native Orchestration</h3><p>Traditional cloud computing assumes stable, high-bandwidth connections. But in edge scenarios such as autonomous driving, industrial IoT, or smart agriculture, connectivity may be intermittent, while latency requirements are unforgiving.</p><p>Standard Kubernetes is not edge-ready by default. It assumes persistent cloud connectivity, strong compute nodes, and central control. In contrast:</p><ul><li>Edge devices often run on ARM processors with limited resources.</li><li>Connectivity can drop unexpectedly for hours or&nbsp;days.</li><li>Devices may require direct hardware interaction (sensors, actuators, PLCs).</li></ul><p>KubeEdge was designed to address these gaps by splitting Kubernetes into two logical&nbsp;planes:</p><ul><li>CloudCore – runs in the cloud or a central data center; manages policies, device models, OTA jobs, and workload orchestration.</li><li>EdgeCore – runs on the edge device; autonomously executes workloads, manages hardware states, and persists operations even if the cloud connection is&nbsp;lost.</li></ul><h3>OTA: The Linchpin of Edge Device Lifecycle Management</h3><p>In real-world edge deployments, the cost of physically updating devices is prohibitive. Imagine dispatching technicians to update 10,000 industrial sensors across factories or retail kiosks across 500 stores. Without OTA, such operations are not feasible.</p><p>KubeEdge addresses this with a multi-layered OTA mechanism:</p><h4>1. Containerized Application OTA</h4><ul><li>Applications deployed as Kubernetes workloads.</li><li>Updated through declarative manifests (Deployment, DaemonSet).</li><li>Rolling updates orchestrated at the edge, resilient to connectivity drops.</li></ul><ul><li>Managed via Device CRDs (Custom Resource Definitions).</li><li>Desired firmware version defined in the Device&nbsp;spec.</li><li>EdgeCore (or a custom mapper) pulls binaries, validates checksums/signatures, flashes the firmware, and updates the status back to CloudCore.</li></ul><h4>3.\tNode OTA (EdgeCore / runtime&nbsp;upgrade)</h4><ul><li>Using NodeUpgradeJob (introduced in&nbsp;v1.19+).</li><li>Securely upgrades KubeEdge edge components, ensuring backward compatibility and checksum validation before activation.</li></ul><p>Together, these cover the full lifecycle of an edge system: from the application layer, down to the firmware and edge runtime&nbsp;itself.</p><h3>Case Study: Smart Retail Kiosk&nbsp;Fleet</h3><p>A retail enterprise deployed 5,000 smart kiosks nationwide. Each kiosk included:</p><ul><li>Containerized applications for payment, ads display, and inventory sync.</li><li>Firmware-controlled peripherals (barcode scanner, receipt printer).</li><li>An edge runtime running KubeEdge EdgeCore.</li></ul><ul><li>Connectivity: Some kiosks connected over 4G with frequent dropouts.</li><li>Heterogeneity: Devices had different firmware baselines depending on vendor&nbsp;batch.</li><li>Security: Regulatory requirement that every update must be signed and auditable.</li></ul><ul><li>Defined a DeviceModel capturing properties: firmware version, display resolution, payment module&nbsp;version.</li><li>Managed application updates by publishing new container images, updating the Deployment spec – CloudCore handled synchronization, and EdgeCore performed rolling updates&nbsp;locally.</li><li>For firmware updates, an OTA Job resource was created with a signed binary hosted on an HTTPS OTA server. EdgeCore validated often overlooked, but based on my experience many errors occur during data transmission), updated firmware via serial flashing, and patched the Device CRD status with the new&nbsp;version.</li></ul><p>For EdgeCore runtime upgrades, NodeUpgradeJobs were rolled out in controlled batches (5% of nodes at a&nbsp;time).</p><ul><li>Updates reduced from 3 – 4 weeks manual rollout to 2 hours automated deployment.</li><li>98% first-pass update success rate; failures automatically retried once connectivity was restored.</li><li>OTA audit logs integrated with enterprise compliance systems, ensuring traceability.</li></ul><h3>Tutorial: Building a KubeEdge OTA&nbsp;Setup</h3><ul><li>A Kubernetes cluster (v1.25+).</li><li>keadm (KubeEdge deployment tool).</li><li>One VM/cloud server (cloud side), one edge node (VM or Raspberry Pi)</li></ul><p>Step 1: Install CloudCore</p><pre>sudo keadm init  – kubeedge-version v1.20.0keadm gettoken</pre><pre>sudo keadm join  – cloudcore-ipport &lt;CLOUD_IP&gt;:10000 \\  --token &lt;TOKEN&gt; \\<p>  --kubeedge-version v1.20.0</p></pre><p>Step 3: Define a DeviceModel</p><pre>apiVersion: devices.kubeedge.io/v1beta1kind: DeviceModel  name: firmware-updater-model  properties:      type: string</pre><p>Step 4: Define a Device&nbsp;Instance</p><pre>apiVersion: devices.kubeedge.io/v1beta1kind: Device  name: edge-device-01  nodeName: edge-node-1    name: firmware-updater-model    - name: firmware_version      reported: \"1.0.0\"</pre><p>Step 5: Trigger an OTA&nbsp;Update</p><pre>properties:  - name: firmware_version</pre><pre>kubectl patch device edge-device-01 \\  --type=merge \\<p>  -p '{\"status\":{\"twins\":{\"firmware_version\":{\"reported\":{\"value\":\"2.0.0\"}}}}}'</p></pre><h3>Risk Registry: Challenges and Preparedness in KubeEdge OTA Deployments</h3><p>While KubeEdge provides a robust OTA mechanism, production deployments must account for inherent risks. Below is a risk registry distilled from real-world projects:</p><ul><li>OTA is both a business enabler and an attack vector – security and rollback strategies must be non-negotiable.</li><li>Connectivity resilience is paramount; production rollouts must batch, monitor, and retry intelligently.</li><li>Observability and compliance logging are not optional for industries subject to regulation.</li></ul><p>KubeEdge elevates Kubernetes from being a container orchestrator to becoming a full lifecycle management platform for edge computing. Its OTA support ensures that applications, firmware, and runtime components can evolve securely and reliably – at&nbsp;scale.</p><p>From smart retail kiosks to industrial automation, OTA in KubeEdge transforms edge infrastructure from brittle, manually maintained systems into self-updating, cloud-native edge&nbsp;fleets.</p><p>As organizations accelerate toward Industry 4.0, 5G, and intelligent IoT, embracing KubeEdge’s OTA capabilities is not just an optimization – it is a necessity for resilience, security, and scalability at the&nbsp;edge.</p><img src=\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=690da554b727\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" alt=\"\">","contentLength":7541,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Can Sales Data Predict Stock Prices?

From generating code snippets to reviewing pull requests and even optimizing CI/CD pipelines, AI is changing the way software is&nbsp;built.</p><p>In this article, we’ll explore what it means to have an “AI co-pilot” in your development workflow, compare the most popular tools (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, and Codeium), and walk through a practical example of using AI to validate code in a CI/CD pipeline.</p><p>An AI co-pilot is a system that assists developers in writing, reviewing, optimizing, and understanding code — without replacing the human in charge. Think of it as a <strong>pair programming partner that never gets tired</strong>, always has instant suggestions, and can adapt to different coding&nbsp;styles.</p><p>AI co-pilots come in two main&nbsp;forms:</p><ul><li><strong>Context-aware code assistants</strong> — Integrated into IDEs (VS Code, JetBrains, etc.) to provide inline suggestions and documentation.</li><li><strong>Conversational AI assistants</strong> — Chat interfaces where you can paste code, ask for explanations, or request specific implementations.</li></ul><p>The best co-pilots blend both approaches, letting you <strong>move between coding, reviewing, and designing</strong> without breaking&nbsp;flow.</p><h3>2. Core Use Cases for Developers</h3><p>AI co-pilots can be applied across the entire development lifecycle. Here are some of the most common scenarios:</p><ul><li>Creating boilerplate code&nbsp;quickly.</li><li>Suggesting implementation details based on comments.</li><li>Generating functions in multiple languages.</li></ul><ul><li>Highlighting potential bugs and security&nbsp;risks.</li><li>Suggesting better algorithms or data structures.</li><li>Pointing out unused imports or redundant code.</li></ul><ul><li>Explaining cryptic error messages.</li><li>Suggesting possible fixes for runtime&nbsp;issues.</li><li>Reproducing bugs based on&nbsp;logs.</li></ul><ul><li>Improving performance by refactoring loops, queries, or memory&nbsp;usage.</li><li>Suggesting more efficient libraries or&nbsp;APIs.</li><li>Reducing complexity for maintainability.</li></ul><ul><li>Generating docstrings and README&nbsp;files.</li><li>Creating developer onboarding guides from existing&nbsp;code.</li><li>Explaining APIs for both internal and public&nbsp;use.</li></ul><h3>3. Hands-On Example: AI in a CI/CD&nbsp;Pipeline</h3><p>Let’s see how an AI co-pilot can help in a <strong>Continuous Integration / Continuous Deployment</strong> setup.</p><p> You want every pull request in your repository to be automatically reviewed&nbsp;for:</p><ul></ul><p>Instead of manually going through every file, you integrate an AI service in your CI pipeline.</p><p><strong>Example with GitHub Actions + OpenAI&nbsp;API</strong>:</p><pre>name: AI Code Review  pull_request:  ai-review:    steps:<p>      - name: Checkout repository</p>        uses: actions/checkout@v3<p>      - name: Install dependencies</p>        run: npm install<p>      - name: Run AI Code Review</p>        env:<p>          OPENAI_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.OPENAI_API_KEY }}</p>        run: |<p>          node scripts/ai-review.js</p></pre><pre>import OpenAI from \"openai\";import fs from \"fs\";<p>const openai = new OpenAI({ apiKey: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY });</p><p>const files = [\"src/index.js\", \"src/utils/helpers.js\"];</p>  for (const file of files) {<p>    const code = fs.readFileSync(file, \"utf8\");</p>    const prompt = `<p>      Review the following JavaScript code for:</p>      1. Potential security issues<p>      2. Code smells or anti-patterns</p>      3. Missing test coverage<p>      Provide feedback in a concise bullet-point list.</p>      ${code}    const response = await openai.chat.completions.create({      messages: [{ role: \"user\", content: prompt }],    console.log(`Review for ${file}:`);<p>    console.log(response.choices[0].message.content);</p>  }</pre><p>This simple setup can automatically leave AI-generated feedback as part of the PR process, helping developers catch issues&nbsp;earlier.</p><h3>5. Challenges and Limitations</h3><p>AI co-pilots are powerful, but they’re not magic. Key challenges include:</p><ul><li> — Code sent to third-party APIs might expose sensitive info.</li><li> — AI suggestions can be wrong or insecure.</li><li> — Large codebases may exceed prompt size&nbsp;limits.</li><li> — Heavy usage can increase expenses.</li><li> — Relying too much on AI may reduce skill retention.</li></ul><h3>6. Best Practices for Using AI in Development</h3><ol><li> — Never merge AI-generated code without&nbsp;review.</li><li><strong>Keep Sensitive Data Local</strong> — Use self-hosted models for confidential projects.</li><li> — The better your instructions, the better the&nbsp;output.</li><li> — Let AI suggest, but tests&nbsp;confirm.</li><li> — Use PR labels to flag AI-assisted commits.</li></ol><h3>7. The Future of AI Co-pilots</h3><p>We’re moving towards a reality where AI will handle more repetitive coding tasks, freeing developers to focus on problem-solving and architecture. The winning strategy isn’t to fight AI, it’s to .</p><p>The best developers of tomorrow will be those who can <strong>combine human creativity with AI efficiency</strong>.</p><p> AI isn’t here to replace developers, it’s here to make us . By understanding its strengths, limits, and best practices, you can turn AI into a genuine co-pilot that helps you ship faster, with higher quality, and less&nbsp;stress.</p><img src=\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=d5abb9e73419\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" alt=\"\">","contentLength":4875,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Google makes it easier to edit Drive videos with a new Vids shortcut button","url":"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/22/google-makes-it-easier-to-edit-drive-videos-with-a-new-vids-shortcut-button/","date":1755876809,"author":"Lauren Forristal","guid":236958,"unread":true,"content":"<article>Now Workspace users can initiate a video edit using the Vids app directly from the Google Drive interface.</article>","contentLength":106,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Scaling Your Application Resiliently with AWS: From Zero to Millions of Requests","url":"https://blog.devops.dev/scaling-your-application-resiliently-with-aws-from-zero-to-millions-of-requests-611648b92eb5?source=rss----33f8b2d9a328---4","date":1755876805,"author":"Vitor Hansen","guid":237002,"unread":true,"content":"<h3>A strategic and technical guide for architects and engineers aiming to build modern, resilient systems designed for&nbsp;growth.</h3><p>Scalability is a critical challenge every successful software system faces. Too often, teams only address scalability issues after significant growth, leading to downtime, poor user experiences, and costly refactoring. I’ve witnessed first-hand systems crashing under load due to inadequate architecture planning. This post emphasizes the importance of building scalability and resilience from the ground&nbsp;up.</p><h3>2. When (and Why) to&nbsp;Scale?</h3><p>First, let’s clarify the distinction:  is about how fast your system handles individual requests, while  is about how well your system handles increasing volume.</p><p>You know it’s time to scale&nbsp;when:</p><ul><li>Response times are increasing</li><li>Servers are consistently maxed&nbsp;out</li><li>Monitoring tools like CloudWatch, X-Ray, or Sentry show consistent bottlenecks</li></ul><p>Scaling is not just a technical necessity, it’s a business enabler. Building for scale means your system can grow with your users, rather than crumble under their&nbsp;weight.</p><h3>3. Modern Scalable Architecture on&nbsp;AWS</h3><p>Today’s cloud architectures leverage key AWS components to build scalable and resilient systems:</p><ul><li> Manages, secures, and routes API requests.</li><li> Serverless compute, automatically scaling and handling workloads.</li><li> Managed container orchestration that removes infrastructure management overhead.</li><li> Highly available relational databases.</li><li> NoSQL database offering high performance and scalability.</li><li> Queue management ensuring reliable asynchronous processing.</li><li> Event-driven communication between services.</li><li> Improves system performance by caching frequently accessed&nbsp;data.</li></ul><p>This setup ensures both horizontal scalability and fault tolerance across all&nbsp;layers.</p><p>Consider a common scenario: an application receiving public API requests and processing financial transactions:</p><ul><li> Receives requests, applies rate limiting, and manages authentication.</li><li> Processes incoming requests, scales automatically based on&nbsp;demand.</li><li> Handles longer-running processes and workflows.</li><li> Stores transactional and rapidly accessed&nbsp;data.</li><li> Stores structured data requiring strong consistency.</li><li> Manages communication and workflows asynchronously.</li></ul><p>This architecture scales seamlessly, maintaining consistent performance and resilience even under heavy&nbsp;load.</p><p>Avoid these mistakes when designing scalable AWS&nbsp;systems:</p><ul><li><strong>Ignoring cold starts in Lambda:</strong> Minimize with smaller functions and Provisioned Concurrency.</li><li><strong>Poor scaling configuration:</strong> Test and validate your auto-scaling policies regularly.</li><li> Use DynamoDB or caching where eventual consistency is acceptable.</li><li> Avoid direct service-to-service calls without message buses like SQS/EventBridge.</li></ul><h3>6. Golden Tips for Resilience</h3><p>Enhance your system’s resilience with these best practices:</p><ul><li>Implement retries and Dead Letter Queues (DLQ) with Amazon&nbsp;SQS.</li><li>Apply the Circuit Breaker pattern with API Gateway and Lambda to prevent cascading failures.</li><li>Use Canary Deployments for safe, gradual rollouts of Lambda functions and ECS services.</li></ul><p>Scalability isn’t just about adding infrastructure; it’s primarily about thoughtful architecture design. Building scalable systems from the start ensures your business can adapt quickly to growth without sacrificing reliability or performance.</p><p> AWS, Architecture, Scalability, Serverless, Fargate, Lambda, Best Practices, Cloud</p><img src=\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=611648b92eb5\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" alt=\"\">","contentLength":3363,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"How to Set up GitHub Actions for a Node.js project","url":"https://blog.devops.dev/how-to-setup-github-actions-for-node-js-project-1edd6ce1dbe1?source=rss----33f8b2d9a328---4","date":1755876771,"author":"Mohammad Faisal Khatri","guid":237001,"unread":true,"content":"","contentLength":0,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Video Friday: Inaugural World Humanoid Robot Games Held","url":"https://spectrum.ieee.org/world-humanoid-robot-games","date":1755876604,"author":"Evan Ackerman","guid":236964,"unread":true,"content":"<p>Your weekly selection of awesome robot videos</p>","contentLength":45,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy82MTUwMTcyNi9vcmlnaW4ucG5nIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTgwNjgyNDE0Nn0.EozRKG9htuXcv5H4asOKEe5qqTQb_Gl1df-A1BHZdHs/image.png?width=600","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"FFmpeg 8.0","url":"https://ffmpeg.org/index.html#pr8.0","date":1755876162,"author":"gyan","guid":236974,"unread":true,"content":"<div><div><h2>\n        A complete, cross-platform solution to record, convert and stream audio and video.\n      </h2></div></div><div><h3>Converting  and  has never been so easy.\n    </h3><pre>$ ffmpeg -i input.mp4 output.avi</pre></div><h3>August 22nd, 2025, FFmpeg 8.0 </h3><p>\n  A new major release, <a href=\"https://ffmpeg.org/download.html#release_8.0\">FFmpeg 8.0 </a>,\n  is now available for download.\n  Thanks to several delays, and modernization of our entire infrastructure, this release ended up\n  being one of our largest releases to date. In short, its new features are:\n  </p><ul><li>Native decoders: , ProRes RAW, RealVideo 6.0, Sanyo LD-ADPCM, G.728</li><li>VVC decoder improvements: ,\n                                  ,\n                                  Palette Mode</li><li>Vulkan compute-based codecs: FFv1 (encode and decode), ProRes RAW (decode only)</li><li>Hardware accelerated decoding: Vulkan VP9, VAAPI VVC, OpenHarmony H264/5</li><li>Hardware accelerated encoding: Vulkan AV1, OpenHarmony H264/5</li><li>Formats: MCC, G.728, Whip, APV</li><li>Filters: colordetect, pad_cuda, scale_d3d11, Whisper, and others</li></ul><p>\n  A new class of decoders and encoders based on pure Vulkan compute implementation have been added.\n  Vulkan is a cross-platform, open standard set of APIs that allows programs to use GPU hardware in various ways,\n  from drawing on screen, to doing calculations, to decoding video via custom hardware accelerators.\n  Rather than using a custom hardware accelerator present, these codecs are based on compute shaders, and work\n  on any implementation of Vulkan 1.3.\n  Decoders use the same hwaccel API and commands, so users do not need to do anything special to enable them,\n  as enabling <a href=\"https://trac.ffmpeg.org/wiki/HWAccelIntro#Vulkan\">Vulkan decoding</a> is sufficient to use them.\n  Encoders, like our hardware accelerated encoders, require specifying a new encoder (ffv1_vulkan).\n  Currently, the only codecs supported are: FFv1 (encoding and decoding) and ProRes RAW (decode only).\n  ProRes (encode+decode) and VC-2 (encode+decode) implementations are complete and currently in review,\n  to be merged soon and available with the next minor release.<p>\n  Only codecs specifically designed for parallelized decoding can be implemented in such a way, with\n  more mainstream codecs not being planned for support.</p>\n  Depending on the hardware, these new codecs can provide very significant speedups, and open up\n  possibilities to work with them for situations like non-linear video editors and\n  lossless screen recording/streaming, so we are excited to learn what our downstream users can make with them.\n  </p><p>\n  The project has recently started to modernize its infrastructure. Our mailing list servers have been\n  fully upgraded, and we have recently started to accept contributions via a new forge, available on\n  <a href=\"https://code.ffmpeg.org/\">code.ffmpeg.org</a>, running a Forgejo instance.\n  </p><p>\n    As usual, we recommend that users, distributors, and system integrators to upgrade unless they use current git master.\n  </p><h3>September 30th, 2024, FFmpeg 7.1 </h3><p>\n    The more important highlights of the release are that the VVC decoder, merged as experimental in version 7.0,\n    has had enough time to mature and be optimized enough to be declared as stable. The codec is starting to gain\n    traction with broadcast standardization bodies.\n    Support has been added for a native AAC USAC (part of the xHE-AAC coding system) decoder, with the format starting\n    to be adopted by streaming websites, due to its extensive volume normalization metadata.<p>\n    MV-HEVC decoding is now supported. This is a stereoscopic coding tool that begun to be shipped and generated\n    by recent phones and VR headsets.</p>\n    LC-EVC decoding, an enhancement metadata layer to attempt to improve the quality of codecs, is now supported via an\n    external library.</p><p>\n    Support for Vulkan encoding, with H264 and HEVC was merged. This finally allows fully Vulkan-based decode-filter-encode\n    pipelines, by having a sink for Vulkan frames, other than downloading or displaying them. The encoders have feature-parity\n    with their VAAPI implementation counterparts. Khronos has announced that support for AV1 encoding is also coming soon to Vulkan,\n    and FFmpeg is aiming to have day-one support.\n  </p><p>\n    In addition to the above, this release has had a lot of important internal work done. By far, the standout internally\n    are the improvements made for full-range images. Previously, color range data had two paths, no negotiation,\n    and was unreliably forwarded to filters, encoders, muxers. Work on cleaning the system up started more than 10\n    years ago, however this stalled due to how fragile the system was, and that breaking behaviour would be unacceptable.\n    The new system fixes this, so now color range is forwarded correctly and consistently everywhere needed, and also\n    laid the path for more advanced forms of negotiation.\n    Cropping metadata is now supported with Matroska and MP4 formats. This metadata is important not only for archival,\n    but also with AV1, as hardware encoders require its signalling due to the codec not natively supporting one.\n  </p><p>\n    As usual, we recommend that users, distributors, and system integrators to upgrade unless they use current git master.\n  </p><h3>September 11th, 2024, Coverity</h3><p>\n  The number of issues FFmpeg has in <a href=\"https://scan.coverity.com/projects/ffmpeg\">Coverity (a static analyzer)</a> is now lower than it has been since 2016.\n  Our defect density is less than one 30th of the average in OSS with over a million code\n  lines. All this was possible thanks to a grant from the <a href=\"https://www.sovereigntechfund.de/\">Sovereign Tech Fund</a>.\n  </p><img src=\"https://ffmpeg.org/img/coverity-lifetime-2024-08.PNG\" alt=\"Coverity Lifetime Graph till 2024-08\"><h3>June 2nd, 2024, native xHE-AAC decoder</h3><p>\n  FFmpeg now implements a native xHE-AAC decoder. Currently, streams without (e)SBR, USAC or MPEG-H Surround\n  are supported, which means the majority of xHE-AAC streams in use should work. Support for USAC and (e)SBR is\n  coming soon. Work is also ongoing to improve its stability and compatibility.\n  During the process we found several specification issues, which were then submitted back to the authors\n  for discussion and potential inclusion in a future errata.\n  </p><h3>May 13th, 2024, Sovereign Tech Fund</h3><p>\n  The FFmpeg community is excited to announce that Germany's\n  <a href=\"https://www.sovereigntechfund.de/tech/ffmpeg\">Sovereign Tech Fund</a>\n  has become its first governmental sponsor. Their support will help\n  sustain the maintainance of the FFmpeg project, a critical open-source\n  software multimedia component essential to bringing audio and video to\n  billions around the world everyday.\n  </p><h3>April 5th, 2024, FFmpeg 7.0 \"Dijkstra\"</h3><p>\n  This release is  backwards compatible, removing APIs deprecated before 6.0.\n  The biggest change for most library callers will be the removal of the old bitmask-based\n  channel layout API, replaced by the  API allowing such\n  features as custom channel ordering, or Ambisonics. Certain deprecated \n  CLI options were also removed, and a C11-compliant compiler is now required to build\n  the code.\n  </p><p>\n  As usual, there is also a number of new supported formats and codecs, new filters, APIs,\n  and countless smaller features and bugfixes. Compared to 6.1, the  repository\n  contains almost ∼2000 new commits by ∼100 authors, touching &gt;100000 lines in\n  ∼2000 files — thanks to everyone who contributed. See the\n  <a href=\"https://git.videolan.org/?p=ffmpeg.git;a=blob_plain;f=Changelog;hb=n7.0\">Changelog</a>,\n  <a href=\"https://git.videolan.org/?p=ffmpeg.git;a=blob_plain;f=doc/APIchanges;hb=n7.0\">APIchanges</a>,\n  and the git log for more comprehensive lists of changes.\n  </p><h3>January 3rd, 2024, native VVC decoder</h3><p>\n  The  library now contains a native VVC (Versatile Video Coding)\n  decoder, supporting a large subset of the codec's features. Further optimizations and\n  support for more features are coming soon. The code was written by Nuo Mi, Xu Mu,\n  Frank Plowman, Shaun Loo, and Wu Jianhua.\n  </p><h3>December 18th, 2023, IAMF support</h3><p>\n  The  library can now read and write <a href=\"https://aomediacodec.github.io/iamf/\">IAMF</a>\n  (Immersive Audio) files. The  CLI tool can configure IAMF structure with the new\n   option. IAMF support was written by James Almer.\n  </p><h3>December 12th, 2023, multi-threaded  CLI tool</h3><p>\n  Thanks to a major refactoring of the  command-line tool, all the major\n  components of the transcoding pipeline (demuxers, decoders, filters, encodes, muxers) now\n  run in parallel. This should improve throughput and CPU utilization, decrease latency,\n  and open the way to other exciting new features.\n  </p><p>\n  Note that you should  expect significant performance improvements in cases\n  where almost all computational time is spent in a single component (typically video\n  encoding).\n  </p><h3>November 10th, 2023, FFmpeg 6.1 \"Heaviside\"</h3><ul><li>Playdate video decoder and demuxer</li><li>Extend VAAPI support for libva-win32 on Windows</li><li>afireqsrc audio source filter</li><li>ffmpeg CLI new option: -readrate_initial_burst</li><li>zoneplate video source filter</li><li>command support in the setpts and asetpts filters</li><li>Vulkan decode hwaccel, supporting H264, HEVC and AV1</li><li>Essential Video Coding parser, muxer and demuxer</li><li>Essential Video Coding frame merge bsf</li><li>Microsoft RLE video encoder</li><li>Raw AC-4 muxer and demuxer</li><li>Raw VVC bitstream parser, muxer and demuxer</li><li>Bitstream filter for editing metadata in VVC streams</li><li>Bitstream filter for converting VVC from MP4 to Annex B</li><li>scale_vt filter for videotoolbox</li><li>transpose_vt filter for videotoolbox</li><li>support for the P_SKIP hinting to speed up libx264 encoding</li><li>Support HEVC,VP9,AV1 codec in enhanced flv format</li><li>apsnr and asisdr audio filters</li><li>Support HEVC,VP9,AV1 codec fourcclist in enhanced rtmp protocol</li><li>ffmpeg CLI '-top' option deprecated in favor of the setfield filter</li><li>ffprobe XML output schema changed to account for multiple variable-fields elements within the same parent element</li><li>ffprobe -output_format option added as an alias of -of</li></ul><p>\n    This release had been overdue for at least half a year, but due to constant activity in the repository,\n    had to be delayed, and we were finally able to branch off the release recently, before some of the large\n    changes scheduled for 7.0 were merged.\n  </p><p>\n    Internally, we have had a number of changes too. The FFT, MDCT, DCT and DST implementation used for codecs\n    and filters has been fully replaced with the faster libavutil/tx (full article about it coming soon).\n    This also led to a reduction in the the size of the compiled binary, which can be noticeable in small builds.<p>\n    There was a very large reduction in the total amount of allocations being done on each frame throughout video decoders,\n    reducing overhead.</p>\n    RISC-V optimizations for many parts of our DSP code have been merged, with mainly the large decoders being left.<p>\n    There was an effort to improve the correctness of timestamps and frame durations of each packet, increasing the\n    accurracy of variable frame rate video.\n  </p></p><p>\n    Next major release will be version 7.0, scheduled to be released in February. We will attempt to better stick\n    to the new release schedule we announced at the start of this year.\n  </p><p>\n    We strongly recommend users, distributors, and system integrators to upgrade unless they use current git master.\n  </p><h3>May 31st, 2023, Vulkan decoding</h3><p>\n    A few days ago, Vulkan-powered decoding hardware acceleration code was merged into the codebase.\n    This is the first vendor-generic and platform-generic decode acceleration API, enabling the\n    same code to be used on multiple platforms, with very minimal overhead.\n    This is also the first multi-threaded hardware decoding API, and our code makes full use of this,\n    saturating all available decode engines the hardware exposes.\n  </p><p>\n    Those wishing to test the code can read our\n    <a href=\"https://trac.ffmpeg.org/wiki/HWAccelIntro#Vulkan\">documentation page</a>.\n    For those who would like to integrate FFmpeg's Vulkan code to demux, parse, decode, and receive\n    a VkImage to present or manipulate, documentation and examples are available in our source tree.\n    Currently, using the latest available git checkout of our\n    <a href=\"https://git.videolan.org/?p=ffmpeg.git;a=summary\">repository</a> is required.\n    The functionality will be included in stable branches with the release of version 6.1, due\n    to be released soon.\n  </p><p>\n    As this is also the first practical implementation of the specifications, bugs may be present,\n    particularly in drivers, and, although passing verification, the implementation itself.\n    New codecs, and encoding support are also being worked on, by both the Khronos organization\n    for standardizing, and us as implementing it, and giving feedback on improving.\n  </p><h3>February 28th, 2023, FFmpeg 6.0 \"Von Neumann\"</h3><p>\n    A new major release, <a href=\"https://ffmpeg.org/download.html#release_6.0\">FFmpeg 6.0 \"Von Neumann\"</a>,\n    is now available for download. This release has many new encoders and decoders, filters,\n    ffmpeg CLI tool improvements, and also, changes the way releases are done. All major\n    releases will now bump the version of the ABI. We plan to have a new major release each\n    year. Another release-specific change is that deprecated APIs will be removed after 3\n    releases, upon the next major bump.\n    This means that releases will be done more often and will be more organized.\n  </p><p>\n    New decoders featured are Bonk, RKA, Radiance, SC-4, APAC, VQC, WavArc and a few ADPCM formats.\n    QSV and NVenc now support AV1 encoding. The FFmpeg CLI (we usually reffer to it as ffmpeg.c\n    to avoid confusion) has speed-up improvements due to threading, as well as statistics options,\n    and the ability to pass option values for filters from a file. There are quite a few new audio\n    and video filters, such as adrc, showcwt, backgroundkey and ssim360, with a few hardware ones too.\n    Finally, the release features many behind-the-scenes changes, including a new FFT and MDCT\n    implementation used in codecs (expect a blog post about this soon), numerous bugfixes, better\n    ICC profile handling and colorspace signalling improvement, introduction of a number of RISC-V\n    vector and scalar assembly optimized routines, and a few new improved APIs, which can be viewed\n    in the doc/APIchanges file in our tree.\n    A few submitted features, such as the Vulkan improvements and more FFT optimizations will be in the\n    next minor release, 6.1, which we plan to release soon, in line with our new release schedule.\n    Some highlights are:\n  </p><ul><li>Radiance HDR image support</li><li>ddagrab (Desktop Duplication) video capture filter</li><li>ffmpeg -shortest_buf_duration option</li><li>ffmpeg now requires threading to be built</li><li>ffmpeg now runs every muxer in a separate thread</li><li>Add new mode to cropdetect filter to detect crop-area based on motion vectors and edges</li><li>VAAPI decoding and encoding for 10/12bit 422, 10/12bit 444 HEVC and VP9</li><li>WBMP (Wireless Application Protocol Bitmap) image format</li><li>Micronas SC-4 audio decoder</li><li>nvenc AV1 encoding support</li><li>MediaCodec decoder via NDKMediaCodec</li><li>QSV decoding and encoding for 10/12bit 422, 10/12bit 444 HEVC and VP9</li><li>showcwt multimedia filter</li><li>WADY DPCM decoder and demuxer</li><li>ffmpeg CLI new options: -stats_enc_pre[_fmt], -stats_enc_post[_fmt], -stats_mux_pre[_fmt]</li><li>hstack_vaapi, vstack_vaapi and xstack_vaapi filters</li><li>XMD ADPCM decoder and demuxer</li><li>ffmpeg CLI new option: -fix_sub_duration_heartbeat</li><li>WavArc decoder and demuxer</li><li>CrystalHD decoders deprecated</li><li>filtergraph syntax in ffmpeg CLI now supports passing file contents as option values</li><li>hstack_qsv, vstack_qsv and xstack_qsv filters</li></ul><p>\n    We strongly recommend users, distributors, and system integrators to\n    upgrade unless they use current git master.\n  </p><h3>July 22nd, 2022, FFmpeg 5.1 \"Riemann\"</h3><ul><li>add ipfs/ipns protocol support</li><li>dialogue enhance audio filter</li><li>dropped obsolete XvMC hwaccel</li><li>DFPWM audio encoder/decoder and raw muxer/demuxer</li><li>Vizrt Binary Image encoder/decoder</li><li>colorchart video source filter</li><li>PGS subtitle frame merge bitstream filter</li><li>added chromakey_cuda filter</li></ul><p>\n    We strongly recommend users, distributors, and system integrators to\n    upgrade unless they use current git master.\n  </p><h3>January 17th, 2022, FFmpeg 5.0 \"Lorentz\"</h3><p><a href=\"https://ffmpeg.org/download.html#release_5.0\">FFmpeg 5.0 \"Lorentz\"</a>, a new\n    major release, is now available! For this long-overdue release, a major effort\n    underwent to remove the old encode/decode APIs and replace them with an\n    N:M-based API, the entire libavresample library was removed, libswscale\n    has a new, easier to use AVframe-based API, the Vulkan code was much improved,\n    many new filters were added, including libplacebo integration, and finally,\n    DoVi support was added, including tonemapping and remuxing. The default\n    AAC encoder settings were also changed to improve quality.\n    Some of the changelog highlights:\n  </p><ul><li>ADPCM IMA Westwood encoder</li><li>ADPCM IMA Acorn Replay decoder</li><li>Argonaut Games CVG demuxer</li><li>audio and video segment filters</li><li>Apple Graphics (SMC) encoder</li><li>hsvkey and hsvhold video filters</li><li>adecorrelate audio filter</li><li>AV1 Low overhead bitstream format muxer</li><li>huesaturation video filter</li><li>colorspectrum source video filter</li><li>RTP packetizer for uncompressed video (RFC 4175)</li><li>VideoToolbox ProRes hwaccel</li><li>aspectralstats audio filter</li><li>adynamicsmooth audio filter</li><li>vflip_vulkan, hflip_vulkan and flip_vulkan filters</li><li>adynamicequalizer audio filter</li><li>yadif_videotoolbox filter</li><li>VideoToolbox ProRes encoder</li></ul><p>\n    We strongly recommend users, distributors, and system integrators to\n    upgrade unless they use current git master.\n  </p><p>\n    We have a new IRC home at Libera Chat\n    now!

Sometimes it's just to get the final report for each project trimmed down, others, is finalizing whatever was still in progress when the program finished: final patches need to be merged, TODO lists stabilized, future plans agreed; you name it.\n  </p><p>\n    Without further ado, here's the silver-lining for each one of the projects we sought to complete during this Summer of Code season:\n  </p><h4>FFv1 (Mentor: Michael Niedermayer)</h4><p>\n    Stanislav Dolganov designed and implemented experimental support for motion estimation and compensation in the lossless FFV1 codec. The design and implementation is based on the snow video codec, which uses OBMC. Stanislav's work proved that significant compression gains can be achieved with inter frame compression. FFmpeg welcomes Stanislav to continue working beyond this proof of concept and bring its advances into the official FFV1 specification within the IETF.\n  </p><h4>Self test coverage (Mentor: Michael Niedermayer)</h4><p>\n    Petru Rares Sincraian added several self-tests to FFmpeg and successfully went through the in-some-cases tedious process of fine tuning tests parameters to avoid known and hard to avoid problems, like checksum mismatches due to rounding errors on the myriad of platforms we support. His work has improved the code coverage of our self tests considerably.\n  </p><h4>MPEG-4 ALS encoder implementation (Mentor: Thilo Borgmann)</h4><p>\n    Umair Khan updated and integrated the ALS encoder to fit in the current FFmpeg codebase. He also implemented a missing feature for the ALS decoder that enables floating-point sample decoding. FFmpeg support for MPEG-4 ALS has been improved significantly by Umair's work. We welcome him to keep maintaining his improvements and hope for great contributions to come.\n  </p><h4>Tee muxer improvements (Mentor: Marton Balint)</h4><p>\n    Ján Sebechlebský's generic goal was to improve the tee muxer so it tolerated blocking IO and allowed transparent error recovery. During the design phase it turned out that this functionality called for a separate muxer, so Ján spent his summer working on the so-called FIFO muxer, gradually fixing issues all over the codebase. He succeeded in his task, and the FIFO muxer is now part of the main repository, alongside several other improvements he made in the process.\n  </p><h4>TrueHD encoder (Mentor: Rostislav Pehlivanov)</h4><p>\n    Jai Luthra's objective was to update the out-of-tree and pretty much abandoned MLP (Meridian Lossless Packing) encoder for libavcodec and improve it to enable encoding to the TrueHD format. For the qualification period the encoder was updated such that it was usable and throughout the summer, successfully improved adding support for multi-channel audio and TrueHD encoding. Jai's code has been merged into the main repository now. While a few problems remain with respect to LFE channel and 32 bit sample handling, these are in the process of being fixed such that effort can be finally put in improving the encoder's speed and efficiency.\n  </p><h4>Motion interpolation filter (Mentor: Paul B Mahol)</h4><p>\n    Davinder Singh investigated existing motion estimation and interpolation approaches from the available literature and previous work by our own: Michael Niedermayer, and implemented filters based on this research. These filters allow motion interpolating frame rate conversion to be applied to a video, for example, to create a slow motion effect or change the frame rate while smoothly interpolating the video along the motion vectors. There's still work to be done to call these filters 'finished', which is rather hard all things considered, but we are looking optimistically at their future.\n  </p><p>\n    And that's it. We are happy with the results of the program and immensely thankful for the opportunity of working with such an amazing set of students. We can be a tough crowd but our mentors did an amazing job at hand holding our interns through their journey. Thanks also to Google for this wonderful program and to everyone that made room in their busy lives to help making GSoC2016 a success. See you in 2017!\n  </p><h3>September 24th, 2016, SDL1 support dropped.</h3><p>\n    Support for the SDL1 library has been dropped, due to it no longer being maintained (as of\n    January, 2012) and it being superseded by the SDL2 library. As a result, the SDL1 output device\n    has also been removed and replaced by an SDL2 implementation.

Furthermore the program has\n    been hard for users to deploy and run due to reliability issues, lack of knowledgable people to help and confusing configuration file syntax.\n    Current users and members of the community are invited to write a replacement program to fill the same niche that ffserver did using the new APIs\n    and to contact us so we may point users to test and contribute to its development.\n  </p><h3>July 1st, 2016, FFmpeg 3.1.1 \"Laplace\"</h3><p><a href=\"https://ffmpeg.org/download.html#release_3.1\">FFmpeg 3.1.1</a>, a new point release from the 3.1 release branch, is now available!\n    It mainly deals with a few ABI issues introduced in the previous release.\n  </p><p>\n    We strongly recommend users, distributors, and system integrators, especially those who experienced issues upgrading from 3.0, to\n    upgrade unless they use current git master.\n  </p><h3>June 27th, 2016, FFmpeg 3.1 \"Laplace\"</h3><ul><li>DXVA2-accelerated HEVC Main10 decoding</li><li>loop video filter and aloop audio filter</li><li>Bob Weaver deinterlacing filter</li><li>protocol blacklisting API</li><li>VC-2 HQ RTP payload format (draft v1) depacketizer and packetizer</li><li>VP9 RTP payload format (draft v2) packetizer</li><li>AudioToolbox audio decoders</li><li>AudioToolbox audio encoders</li><li>coreimage filter (GPU based image filtering on OSX)</li><li>bitstream filter for extracting DTS core</li><li>hash and framehash muxers</li><li>VAAPI-accelerated format conversion and scaling</li><li>libnpp/CUDA-accelerated format conversion and scaling</li><li>Duck TrueMotion 2.0 Real Time decoder</li><li>Wideband Single-bit Data (WSD) demuxer</li><li>VAAPI-accelerated H.264/HEVC/MJPEG encoding</li><li>DTS Express (LBR) decoder</li><li>Generic OpenMAX IL encoder with support for Raspberry Pi</li><li>IFF ANIM demuxer &amp; decoder</li><li>Direct Stream Transfer (DST) decoder</li><li>OpenExr improvements (tile data and B44/B44A support)</li><li>BitJazz SheerVideo decoder</li><li>CUDA CUVID H264/HEVC decoder</li><li>10-bit depth support in native utvideo decoder</li><li>libutvideo wrapper removed</li><li>YUY2 Lossless Codec decoder</li><li>VideoToolbox H.264 encoder</li></ul><p>\n    We strongly recommend users, distributors, and system integrators to\n    upgrade unless they use current git master.\n  </p><h3>March 16th, 2016, Google Summer of Code</h3><p>\n    FFmpeg has been accepted as a <a href=\"https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/\">Google Summer of Code</a> open source organization. If you wish to\n    participate as a student see our <a href=\"https://trac.ffmpeg.org/wiki/SponsoringPrograms/GSoC/2016\">project ideas page</a>.\n    You can already get in contact with mentors and start working on qualification tasks as well as register at google and submit your project proposal draft.\n    Good luck!\n  </p><h3>February 15th, 2016, FFmpeg 3.0 \"Einstein\"</h3><p>\n    We strongly recommend users, distributors, and system integrators to\n    upgrade unless they use current git master.\n  </p><h3>January 30, 2016, Removing support for two external AAC encoders</h3><p>\n    We have just removed support for VisualOn AAC encoder (libvo-aacenc) and\n    libaacplus in FFmpeg master.\n  </p><p>\n    Even before marking our internal AAC encoder as\n    <a href=\"https://ffmpeg.org/index.html#aac_encoder_stable\">stable</a>, it was known that libvo-aacenc\n    was of an inferior quality compared to our native one for most samples.\n    However, the VisualOn encoder was used extensively by the Android Open\n    Source Project, and we would like to have a tested-and-true stable option\n    in our code base.\n  </p><p>\n    When first committed in 2011, libaacplus filled in the gap of encoding\n    High Efficiency AAC formats (HE-AAC and HE-AACv2), which was not supported\n    by any of the encoders in FFmpeg at that time.\n  </p><p>\n    The circumstances for both have changed. After the work spearheaded by\n    Rostislav Pehlivanov and Claudio Freire, the now-stable FFmpeg native AAC\n    encoder is ready to compete with much more mature encoders. The Fraunhofer\n    FDK AAC Codec Library for Android was added in 2012 as the fourth\n    supported external AAC encoder, and the one with the best quality and the\n    most features supported, including HE-AAC and HE-AACv2.\n  </p><p>\n    Therefore, we have decided that it is time to remove libvo-aacenc and\n    libaacplus. If you are currently using libvo-aacenc, prepare to transition\n    to the native encoder () when updating to the next version\n    of FFmpeg. In most cases it is as simple as merely swapping the encoder\n    name. If you are currently using libaacplus, start using FDK AAC\n    () with an appropriate  option\n    to select the exact AAC profile that fits your needs. In both cases, you\n    will enjoy an audible quality improvement and as well as fewer licensing\n    headaches.\n  </p><h3>January 16, 2016, FFmpeg 2.8.5, 2.7.5, 2.6.7, 2.5.10</h3><p>\n    We have made several new point releases ().\n    They fix various bugs, as well as CVE-2016-1897 and CVE-2016-1898.\n    Please see the changelog for each release for more details.\n  </p><p>\n    We recommend users, distributors and system integrators to upgrade unless they use\n    current git master.\n  </p><h3>December 5th, 2015, The native FFmpeg AAC encoder is now stable!</h3><p>\n    After seven years the native FFmpeg AAC encoder has had its experimental flag\n    removed and declared as ready for general use. The encoder is transparent\n    at 128kbps for most samples tested with artifacts only appearing in extreme\n    cases. Subjective quality tests put the encoder to be of equal or greater\n    quality than most of the other encoders available to the public.\n  </p><p>\n    Licensing has always been an issue with encoding AAC audio as most of the\n    encoders have had a license making FFmpeg unredistributable if compiled with\n    support for them. The fact that there now exists a fully open and truly\n    free AAC encoder integrated directly within the project means a lot to those\n    who wish to use accepted and widespread standards.\n  </p><p>\n    The majority of the work done to bring the encoder up to quality was started\n    during this year's GSoC by developer Claudio Freire and Rostislav Pehlivanov.\n    Both continued to work on the encoder with the latter joining as a developer\n    and mainainer, working on other parts of the project as well. Also, thanks\n    to <a href=\"http://d.hatena.ne.jp/kamedo2/\">Kamedo2</a> who does comparisons\n    and tests, the original authors and all past and current contributors to the\n    encoder.

FFmpeg got a total of 8 assigned\n    projects, and 7 of them were successful.\n  </p><p>We want to thank <a href=\"https://www.google.com\">Google</a>, the\n    participating students, and especially the mentors who joined this\n    effort. We're looking forward to participating in the next GSoC\n    edition!\n  </p><p>\n    Below you can find a brief description of the final outcome of\n    each single project.\n  </p><h4>Basic servers for network protocols, mentee: Stephan Holljes, mentor: Nicolas George</h4><p>\n    Stephan Holljes's project for this session of Google Summer of Code was to\n    implement basic HTTP server features for libavformat, to complement the\n    already present HTTP client and RTMP and RTSP server code.\n  </p><p>\n    The first part of the project was to make the HTTP code capable of accepting\n    a single client; it was completed partly during the qualification period and\n    partly during the first week of the summer. Thanks to this work, it is now\n    possible to make a simple HTTP stream using the following commands:\n  </p><pre>    ffmpeg -i /dev/video0 -listen 1 -f matroska \\\n    -c:v libx264 -preset fast -tune zerolatency http://:8080\n    ffplay http://localhost:8080/\n  </pre><p>\n    The next part of the project was to extend the code to be able to accept\n    several clients, simultaneously or consecutively. Since libavformat did not\n    have an API for that kind of task, it was necessary to design one. This part\n    was mostly completed before the midterm and applied shortly afterwards.\n    Since the ffmpeg command-line tool is not ready to serve several clients,\n    the test ground for that new API is an example program serving hard-coded\n    content.\n  </p><p>\n    The last and most ambitious part of the project was to update ffserver to\n    make use of the new API. It would prove that the API is usable to implement\n    real HTTP servers, and expose the points where more control was needed. By\n    the end of the summer, a first working patch series was undergoing code\n    review.\n  </p><h4>Browsing content on the server, mentee: Mariusz Szczepańczyk, mentor: Lukasz Marek</h4><p>\n    Mariusz finished an API prepared by the FFmpeg community and implemented\n    Samba directory listing as qualification task.\n  </p><p>\n    During the program he extended the API with the possibility to\n    remove and rename files on remote servers. He completed the\n    implementation of these features for file, Samba, SFTP, and FTP\n    protocols.\n  </p><p>\n    At the end of the program, Mariusz provided a sketch of an\n    implementation for HTTP directory listening.\n  </p><h4>Directshow digital video capture, mentee: Mate Sebok, mentor: Roger Pack</h4><p>\n    Mate was working on directshow input from digital video sources. He\n    got working input from ATSC input sources, with specifiable tuner.\n  </p><p>\n    The code has not been committed, but a patch of it was sent to the\n    ffmpeg-devel mailing list for future use.\n  </p><p>\n    The mentor plans on cleaning it up and committing it, at least for the\n    ATSC side of things. Mate and the mentor are still working trying to\n    finally figure out how to get DVB working.\n  </p><h4>Implementing full support for 3GPP Timed Text Subtitles, mentee: Niklesh Lalwani, mentor: Philip Langdale</h4><p>\n    Niklesh's project was to expand our support for 3GPP Timed Text\n    subtitles. This is the native subtitle format for mp4 containers, and\n    is interesting because it's usually the only subtitle format supported\n    by the stock playback applications on iOS and Android devices.\n  </p><p>\n    ffmpeg already had basic support for these subtitles which ignored all\n    formatting information - it just provided basic plain-text support.\n  </p><p>\n    Niklesh did work to add support on both the encode and decode side for\n    text formatting capabilities, such as font size/colour and effects like\n    bold/italics, highlighting, etc.\n  </p><p>\n    The main challenge here is that Timed Text handles formatting in a very\n    different way from most common subtitle formats. It uses a binary\n    encoding (based on mp4 boxes, naturally) and stores information\n    separately from the text itself. This requires additional work to track\n    which parts of the text formatting applies to, and explicitly dealing\n    with overlapping formatting (which other formats support but Timed\n    Text does not) so it requires breaking the overlapping sections into\n    separate non-overlapping ones with different formatting.\n  </p><p>\n    Finally, Niklesh had to be careful about not trusting any size\n    information in the subtitles - and that's no joke: the now infamous\n    Android stagefright bug was in code for parsing Timed Text subtitles.\n  </p><p>\n    All of Niklesh's work is committed and was released in ffmpeg 2.8.\n  </p><h4>libswscale refactoring, mentee: Pedro Arthur, mentors: Michael Niedermayer, Ramiro Polla</h4><p>\n    Pedro Arthur has modularized the vertical and horizontal scalers.\n    To do this he designed and implemented a generic filter framework\n    and moved the existing scaler code into it. These changes now allow\n    easily adding removing, splitting or merging processing steps.\n    The implementation was benchmarked and several alternatives were\n    tried to avoid speed loss.\n  </p><p>\n    He also added gamma corrected scaling support.\n    An example to use gamma corrected scaling would be:\n  </p><pre>    ffmpeg -i input -vf scale=512:384:gamma=1 output\n  </pre><p>\n    Pedro has done impressive work considering the short time available,\n    and he is a FFmpeg committer now. He continues to contribute to\n    FFmpeg, and has fixed some bugs in libswscale after GSoC has\n    ended.\n  </p><h4>AAC Encoder Improvements, mentee: Rostislav Pehlivanov, mentor: Claudio Freire</h4><p>\n    Rostislav Pehlivanov has implemented PNS, TNS, I/S coding and main\n    prediction on the native AAC encoder. Of all those extensions, only\n    TNS was left in a less-than-usable state, but the implementation has\n    been pushed (disabled) anyway since it's a good basis for further\n    improvements.\n  </p><p>\n    PNS replaces noisy bands with a single scalefactor representing the\n    energy of that band, gaining in coding efficiency considerably, and\n    the quality improvements on low bitrates are impressive for such a\n    simple feature.\n  </p><p>\n    TNS still needs some polishing, but has the potential to reduce coding\n    artifacts by applying noise shaping in the temporal domain (something\n    that is a source of annoying, notable distortion on low-entropy\n    bands).\n  </p><p>\n    Intensity Stereo coding (I/S) can double coding efficiency by\n    exploiting strong correlation between stereo channels, most effective\n    on pop-style tracks that employ panned mixing. The technique is not as\n    effective on classic X-Y recordings though.\n  </p><p>\n    Finally, main prediction improves coding efficiency by exploiting\n    correlation among successive frames. While the gains have not been\n    huge at this point, Rostislav has remained active even after the GSoC,\n    and is polishing both TNS and main prediction, as well as looking for\n    further improvements to make.\n  </p><p>\n    In the process, the MIPS port of the encoder was broken a few times,\n    something he's also working to fix.\n  </p><h4>Animated Portable Network Graphics (APNG), mentee: Donny Yang, mentor: Paul B Mahol</h4><p>\n    Donny Yang implemented basic keyframe only APNG encoder as the\n    qualification task. Later he wrote interframe compression via\n    various blend modes. The current implementation tries all blend\n    modes and picks one which takes the smallest amount of memory.\n  </p><p>\n    Special care was taken to make sure that the decoder plays\n    correctly all files found in the wild and that the encoder\n    produces files that can be played in browsers that support APNG.\n  </p><p>\n    During his work he was tasked to fix any encountered bug in the\n    decoder due to the fact that it doesn't match APNG\n    specifications. Thanks to this work, a long standing bug in the\n    PNG decoder has been fixed.\n  </p><p>\n    For latter work he plans to continue working on the encoder,\n    making it possible to select which blend modes will be used in the\n    encoding process. This could speed up encoding of APNG files.\n  </p><h3>September 9th, 2015, FFmpeg 2.8</h3><p>\n    We published release  as new major version.\n    It contains all features and bug fixes of the git master branch from September 8th. Please see\n    the \n    for a list of the most important changes.\n  </p><p>\n    We recommend users, distributors and system integrators to upgrade unless they use current git master.\n  </p><h3>August 1st, 2015, A message from the FFmpeg project</h3><p>\n    Dear multimedia community,\n  </p><p>\n    The resignation of Michael Niedermayer as leader of FFmpeg yesterday has\n    come by surprise. He has worked tirelessly on the FFmpeg project for many\n    years and we must thank him for the work that he has done. We hope that in\n    the future he will continue to contribute to the project. In the coming\n    weeks, the FFmpeg project will be managed by the active contributors.\n  </p><p>\n    The last four years have not been easy for our multimedia community - both\n    contributors and users. We should now look to the future, try to find\n    solutions to these issues, and to have reconciliation between the forks,\n    which have split the community for so long.\n  </p><p>\n    Unfortunately, much of the disagreement has taken place in inappropriate\n    venues so far, which has made finding common ground and solutions\n    difficult. We aim to discuss this in our communities online over the coming\n    weeks, and in person at the <a href=\"https://www.videolan.org/videolan/events/vdd15/\">VideoLAN Developer\n    Days</a> in Paris in September: a neutral venue for the entire open source\n    multimedia community.\n  </p><h3>July 4th, 2015, FFmpeg needs a new host</h3><p> We have received more than 7 offers for hosting and servers, thanks a lot to everyone!</p><p>\n    After graciously hosting our projects (<a href=\"http://www.ffmpeg.org\">FFmpeg</a>, <a href=\"http://www.mplayerhq.hu\">MPlayer</a>\n    and <a href=\"http://rtmpdump.mplayerhq.hu\">rtmpdump</a>) for 4 years, Arpi (our hoster) has informed us that we have to secure a new host somewhere else immediately.\n  </p><p>\n    If you want to host an open source project, please let us know, either on <a href=\"http://ffmpeg.org/mailman/listinfo/ffmpeg-devel\">ffmpeg-devel</a>\n    mailing list or irc.freenode.net #ffmpeg-devel.\n  </p><p>\n    We use about 4TB of storage and at least 4TB of bandwidth / month for various mailing lists, <a href=\"http://trac.ffmpeg.org\">trac</a>, <a href=\"http://samples.ffmpeg.org\">samples repo</a>, svn, etc.\n  </p><h3>March 16, 2015, FFmpeg 2.6.1</h3><p>\n    We have made a new major release ()\n    and now one week afterward 2.6.1.

At the same time, Web3 continues to push the boundaries of what decentralized systems can achieve. Where these two worlds intersect is where <a href=\"https://0g.ai/\">0G Labs</a> positions itself, building what it calls the “Solana for AI,” a decentralized operating system designed for large-scale, low-latency AI workloads.</p><p>\\\nIn this interview, I speak with Michael Heinrich, CEO of <a href=\"https://0g.ai/\">0G Labs</a>, about why decentralization matters for AI, how Web3 infrastructure can solve bottlenecks in scaling machine learning, and what the future of AI-native blockchains looks like.</p><p>\\\n Hi Michael, welcome to our “Behind the Startup” series. Please tell us about your journey and what led you to build 0G Labs?</p><p>\\\n My journey's been something of a wild ride, all the way back to my earliest memories. I was born in East Berlin just before the Berlin Wall came down. I faintly remember the night it fell and my family emigrated to the US when I was young, settling in California. That early experience of crossing borders and adapting to new worlds and languages likely planted the seeds for my fixation on breaking down barriers, both literally and figuratively.</p><p>\\\nI studied economics and computer science at UC Berkley, but to be honest, while the learning came naturally, I was restless and agitating to find some deeper purpose. It would take a few more years before that call was answered with the founding of 0G Labs. In the interim, I left college and cut my teeth in the corporate world at places like Microsoft, Bain &amp; Company, and Bridgewater Associates, where I learned about scaling systems and building high-performance teams.</p><p>\\\nThen came my first taste of entrepreneurship when I founded Garten, a corporate wellness company that delivered healthier cafeteria options for businesses, which grew to serve hundreds of employees across the US. It was my first real startup, and it taught me resilience and the need to engineer shock-resistant systems.</p><p>\\\nFast forward to grad school at Stanford, where I was introduced to Fan Long and Ming Wu by my classmate Thomas in 2023. Thomas, who is also one of the co-founders of Zero Gravity Labs, brought us together at a time when AI was exploding but locked in centralized silos controlled by Big Tech. We all saw blockchain as the key to democratizing it, making AI a public good that's accessible to everyone. That’s what led us to found 0G Labs in 2023. We're building DeAIOS, a decentralized AI operating system, because I believe the future of innovation isn’t in walled gardens; it’s in open, collaborative ecosystems. At 0G Labs, I can honestly say I’ve found my calling, and every day I wake up excited to get out of bed and keep building.</p><p>\\\n 0G has been described as the “Solana for AI.” Can you break down what you mean by that, and why existing blockchains are not suited for AI-scale workloads?</p><p>\\\n This comparison highlights the speed, scalability, and low latency we're bringing to decentralized AI compared to incumbent solutions. Solana revolutionized smart contract blockchains by enabling thousands of transactions per second at minimal cost without sacrificing decentralization, something that was streets ahead of the then-market leader Ethereum.</p><p>\\\nWe're doing something similar but tailored for AI: creating a modular Layer 1 blockchain that supports massive, real-time AI workloads for inference, training, and data processing. Existing blockchains fall short for AI because they're optimized for financial transactions, not the data-heavy demands of machine learning. AI requires enormous bandwidth for data availability, we’re talking petabytes of datasets streaming in low-latency environments and most chains run into bottlenecks due to storage costs or limited composability.</p><p>\\\nWe solve this with components like 0G DA (Data Availability), which provides infinitely scalable, high-speed data layers, and <a href=\"https://0g.ai/blog/0g-storage\">0G Storage</a>, offering ultra-low-cost, verifiable permanence for structured and unstructured data. For AI builders, this is like upgrading from a biplane to a jet, way faster, way more efficient, and also a lot more fun since now the only limitations are your imagination.</p><p>\\\n The AI industry today is dominated by centralized players. Why do you believe decentralization is not just a philosophical stance but a technical and economic necessity for AI?</p><p>\\\n The likes of OpenAI, Google, and AWS control the AI stack today, and while this provides convenience in terms of guaranteed access and uptime, this setup also creates real risks. Even if we set aside the philosophical benefits of decentralization, from a purely technical perspective, it’s obvious that having a triumvirate of Big Tech players calling the shots is suboptimal. Centralization leads to single points of failure: data silos that stifle innovation, vulnerability to censorship or outages, and biased models trained on proprietary datasets. Economically, it also prices out smaller players; GPUs and compute are expensive enough, but locked ecosystems mean you're paying a premium for access.</p><p>\\\nDecentralized solutions have a major role to play in ameliorating these issues. At 0G, we're building tools like our Compute Network for trustless AI inference, secured by cryptography, so that anyone can contribute resources and earn rewards. This creates a global, permissionless marketplace where costs drop dramatically, our <a href=\"https://0g.ai/blog/0g-storage\">storage</a> is orders of magnitude cheaper than AWS S3 and a culture of innovation is fostered through composability. Imagine AI agents collaborating onchain without intermediaries or verifiable models that prevent hallucinations.</p><p>\\\nThese sorts of open-source and interoperable solutions are necessary because AI's impact on society is too big to be gatekept; decentralizing it ensures equitable access and reduces monopolies. I've seen centralized systems crumble firsthand and will remain convinced till my last breath that decentralization isn't optional, it's essential.</p><p>\\\n A lot of people talk about compute and GPUs as the bottleneck for AI. From your perspective, what are the real constraints, data, bandwidth, economics and how does 0G tackle them differently?</p><p>\\\n Great question. Compute gets all the headlines because GPUs are flashy and scarce, but in my view, the real chokepoints are data availability, bandwidth, and economics and by “economics” I mean the price you pay to access these resources. NVIDIA's cranking out chips faster than ever, but where's the infrastructure to feed them massive, verifiable datasets at scale? Data is fragmented and centralized, bandwidth limits low-latency streaming for real-time AI, and as for economics, well, where do we start?</p><p>\\\nCloud providers charge over the odds, often locking clients into rigid subscription-based models, making AI inaccessible for solo devs or startups that have yet to be blessed with VC cash. Even then, early-stage funding is only a bandaid, cos you need to start generating revenue sooner rather than later or you’ll eventually blow your budget on GPUs with nothing to show for it other than some cool renders.</p><p>\\\nAt 0G, we tackle these resource issues head-on. Our 0G DA layer provides high-speed, infinitely scalable data availability – we’ve been hitting 11,000 TPS per shard on testnet, with over 650 million transactions already processed. For bandwidth, our modular chain uses multi-consensus validation to handle AI workloads without congestion. Economically, we slash costs: 0G Storage offers decentralized, AI-optimized storage at pennies compared to centralized options, with cryptographic permanence to ensure data integrity.</p><p>\\\nUnlike traditional setups, we're creating an <a href=\"https://0g.ai/blog/early-signals-0g-global-accelerator\">open economy</a> where users run alignment nodes or provide compute for rewards. It's like turning AI infrastructure into a shared resource pool, making it more efficient and inclusive.</p><p>\\\n You’ve mentioned the idea of a “decentralized operating system for AI.” What does that look like in practice, and how does it compare to traditional cloud infrastructure models in terms of pricing and benefits for end users?</p><p>\\\n The “decentralized operating system for AI,” or DeAIOS, is essentially a full-stack platform where AI runs natively on blockchain. It’s scalable, composable, and trustless. In practice, it means developers can deploy AI models or agents by leveraging components such as the Service Marketplace for trading models, or Alignment Nodes to ensure ethical, efficient performance. Running inference on a global network of nodes, with data pulled seamlessly from 0G Storage and verified onchain is a much cheaper and more transparent way of doing things versus relying on centralized servers and Big Tech’s inflexible pricing.</p><p>\\\nCompared to traditional clouds like AWS or Azure, the differences are stark. Let’s start with pricing: centralized cloud provider costs can quickly stack up, with intermediaries adding on their fees for storage and compute along the way. We cut that by decentralizing supply, so end users pay near-cost. As for the other benefits this model bestows, permissionless access means no vendor lock-in; censorship resistance protects against shutdowns; and composability lets apps interoperate fluidly, sparking innovations like onchain AI gaming.</p><p>\\\nFinally, verifiability ensures models are auditable, reducing risks like bias. It's relatable: think of it as open-source Linux versus proprietary Windows but for AI. Users get faster iteration and ownership in the ecosystem. We've seen this in our testnet with 22 million active accounts – it's already empowering a new wave of builders.</p><p>\\\n Many skeptics argue that Web3 adds unnecessary complexity to AI. How do you respond to the criticism that decentralization slows innovation instead of accelerating it?</p><p>\\\n I hear this a lot, and I understand that Web3 can feel like adding gears to a machine that's already ticking over. But from my experience of building in both worlds, decentralization doesn't slow innovation – it turbocharges it by solving problems that centralization can't. Yes, it adds a degree of complexity but it's purposeful: cryptographic proofs add verifiability to AI outputs, preventing fakes or manipulations that plague centralized models. And blockchain's composability means devs can mix and match components – like plugging an AI oracle from Ora into 0G’s chain – without starting from scratch.</p><p>\\\nCritics overlook how Web3 accelerates parallel development: thousands of nodes worldwide contribute compute, data, and ideas, outpacing any single company's R&amp;D. At 0G, we've raised $35M and hit milestones like 8,000 validators because this model draws global talent. It hasn't slowed us but has rather propelled us. Ultimately, this all comes down to trade-offs: introducing a little short-term complexity in return for long-term resilience and inclusivity. Innovation thrives in open systems and so, to my mind, Web3 isn't a hurdle; it's the accelerator pedal for AI's next phase.</p><p>\\\n Finally, what advice would you give to founders trying to build companies at the cutting edge of both AI and blockchain?</p><p>\\\n To founders at this intersection: first, don't die, protect your mission at all costs. My journey has taught me that resilience wins, whether it's overcoming personal setbacks or navigating market downturns, so keep iterating and surround yourself with a strong team that will always have your back. Second, focus on real problems and describe the solutions in real terms. It’s fine to occasionally dispense big picture stuff, onboarding the next billion users, yadda yadda but as a founder, your job is really to explain your tech in ways that lay people can understand. Even if you’re marketing to AI builders, who understand this stuff, think about their end users, because they’re the people this tech is ultimately gonna trickle down to.</p><p>\\\nFinally, never be afraid to change your mind. It’s okay to be wrong sometimes. And it’s more than okay to change your perspective on something when new evidence comes to light, which, in an industry evolving as fast as AI, is a given. Be confident in your convictions, yet honest enough to admit that you will always be a student and will always be learning. Your team and your shareholders will respect you a lot more if you do. Move fast, learn faster, and try not to break too much stuff along the way.</p><p>\\\nDon’t forget to like and share the story!</p><p>:::tip\n<em>This author is an independent contributor publishing via our&nbsp;.

But it is something, what is it?</p><p>Think about an LLM agent as a dedicated intern, or a student who is around the proficiency of a sophomore in college. They know the basics of what programming looks like, they can copy other ideas and architectures, they know how to do things like run unit tests, and they know how to Google things. They have had their basic programming course, and probably have done a deep dive into some random subject as a higher level course, but if you quiz them on the topic enough you’ll learn they haven’t actually learned it deeply. The kid seems smart enough, you’d give them a shot.</p><p>If this was a person who showed up to your office looking for work, what would you do with them? Generally you would do one of two things. First, you could sandbox their work. Now the reason you sandbox the work of a new student or intern is rather simple: it’s because you don’t know a new subject/tool well, you want to give it a try, and ehh why not let’s see what happens. If you took the sandbox route, you probably aren’t caring about the code (it’s likely to be unmaintainable and bit rot anyways if it’s not in your core repos), it’s about getting the artifact. You vibe code a bit, “that looks cool!”, throw it into a demo / LinkedIn post, and then move on. That’s the simple vibe coding you may have already tried and thought “that’s not useful enough”. It works, but that’s not what we’re here for, so no need to mention that more in the blog.</p><p>The second path, in the complete opposite direction, you would integrate the student/intern into a project you know well because it makes it very easy for you to review their work: you can give clear feedback because you’ve already made the first 10 mistakes they will make, you already know how to tell them what is next, and you have the first 6 months of the project planned out for them so it’s low maintenance. This is how you would train most people that you want to stay long term, right? In the same way, this is the path to take with the LLM agents.</p><p>So let’s walk through this process step by step.</p><h3>Major Point: Vibe coding turns everyone into a team lead, but not everyone should be a team lead</h3><p>Leading a team of programmers is hard! It takes time, skill, and patience. I think everyone when they are a kid thinks “I don’t want to be the worker, I want to be the boss and I just sit in my chair and tell people what to do and boom it all gets done!”. But after your second group project in college, you pretty quickly realize that if you lead a team wrong, you instead just end up doing all of the work yourself while having the expectation of 4 people. </p><p>Now there’s a few reasons for this. One issue with trying to establish team programming is that you may just not know the subject well enough. If it takes you a while to understand the subject, what someone is trying to do, and what their code is about, then it’s just not worth the time to manage someone else. You need to be at a point where you can very quickly see the code, understand what’s going on, and say “I can’t merge this until you have tests for X and Y, and also show me a plot of Z so I know how it all relates”. If you cannot instantly see that kind of feedback, then you probably aren’t experienced enough to lead. You need to write a few million lines of code before it becomes automatic where you just look at code and say “don’t do that, that’ll be a performance bottleneck”, but you need that quickness to the code review in order for vibe coding to work. But also, let me say this bluntly:</p><h4>If you are an individual contributor who usually does not like to train interns because you find that they take more time than they are helpful, then don’t vibe code</h4><p>Some people tend to do better at working by directing. Other really smart people just can’t seem to get good work out of other people. It’s not an indictment, Silicon Valley created the “individual contributor” role for a reason. If you are one of those people, then vibe coding may not be for you as you will likely grow frustrated with the agents even quicker than you would a human (they somehow retain less information than even the worst intern, at least they remember your favorite lunch order).</p><p>So go in with this mindset: I will have to have meetings with the agents, I will need to plan and give them tasks, and I will need to review the code. If I find this stuff to be slower than coding myself, then just stop right now. But if you do well with a team, then go on. How do we now make this team effective?</p><h2>What is the workflow of vibe coding correctly?</h2><p>If someone shows you Claude Code and you ask it to try and solve the problem that you were just working on (obviously a hard problem, because if it ends up on your desk that means someone else failed to solve it), you just poke and laugh at Claude when it fails miserably. But you would have never done that with a new intern or student (hopefully), so why do this? Again, you know how smart it actually is, cut the hype, and treat it the same way. This immediately leads to a few workflow principles:</p><h3>The workflow of vibe coding is the same as managing scrums or helping a student through a research thesis</h3><p>You have a problem, you give it to the agent, you review the results, and then you give it feedback. This is exactly how you would manage a scrum team or help a student through their thesis. You don’t just give them the problem and expect them to solve it, you give them the problem, they come back with a solution, and then you tell them what to do next.</p><p>You probably already get most of your work done this way if you’re senior enough. Every professor has more students coding than themselves, and every senior developer has a total amount of code created by their team that is far greater than their own. Just think of Claude as your pack of newbies that just started. Now if you’re thinking “but it can be difficult to manage a bunch of newbies”… yeah, that means you’re actually senior enough to understand how to do this right. It’s fairly easy to send a new intern or student off on a project, and if their pay/grade depends on it getting done they will give you something back. Whether it’s any good depends on how well you chunked up the work for them and gave them an appropriate task. </p><p>But one key thing is, if you had to do a meeting every 10 minutes it would drive you crazy, so don’t. Set up say 12-32 agents running on different processes, preferably sandboxed on some other compute resource (sandboxed so they can’t break the machine, but also so they can have a Github authentication that does not have core read/write privileges. This way you can tell it to have “dangerously unsafe permissions” and the worst that happens is it segfaults its own docker container and never opens a PR). Give it a full command:</p><p>“try solving (an easy issue in this open source repository). Create a PR with the solution, and after an hour check the continuous integration to see if tests are passing. If tests are not passing, assess what the issue is, and if it is a quick fix make a commit to handle it, otherwise report what the core difficulty of the problem is”</p><h4>Don’t spend too much time setting up the calls, just pull from lists you already have and let it find “whatever is easy”</h4><p>Make it clear, make it easy, make it know the steps, and let it just keep cycling for a bit.</p><h3>How to review vibe coding: immediately throw out anything bad</h3><p>If you saw a student was cheating and just copy-pasted from StackOverflow but couldn’t explain what it did, you’d throw it out and tell them to try again. If your new intern didn’t reuse all of the solid code your team had written and instead rewrote some low level detail in a buggy and unmaintainable way, you’d throw it out and tell them to try again. If they wrote a function that was 500 lines long and did 10 different things, you’d throw it out and tell them to try again. You wouldn’t waste your time trying to fix it, you’d just tell them to try again.</p><p>Again, treat the LLMs the same way. I see a lot of people following the mindset they see the vibe coding YouTubers making their silly games. “ChatGPT, try harder! Fix for me!”. You want to know a secret? That stuff is worse than worthless. The problem is that these LLMs are made to please you, so if you tell them to try harder, they will either start hallucinating or just start changing your tests. Don’t even give it a try. The moment you see it go off the rails, just throw it out. That problem is too hard for Claude, it’s for you now.</p><p>Send a bunch of commands at 9am. At noon, check on them. You might have 10 done. 8 of them probably went off the rails, whatever, fire them. Hey two PRs worked, whoopee! Fire 10 more, come back at 3. 20 done, 4 successes and 16 failures. Fire a few more off, maybe a few clean up ones to look for missing docstrings or dig around to see if any performance regressions were introduced. At 6, see the other 4 successes and cut the other jobs. </p><h4>Vibe coding is useful only if you have enough problems that you’re happy that some subset being solved, not caring what in that subset is solved.</h4><p>10 PRs were merged, plus whatever you were working on that day (yes, because you didn’t focus on this for most of your day!). You might think, that’s like 10/40 = 25% success rate, that’s not good. But you know what? Those were free. You just got a lot of extra stuff done that you wouldn’t have otherwise. The success rate is just a matter of how much these things give value for their cost. That’s for Sam Altman to worry about. But if you have a subscription to these LLMs, just keep burning through the tokens who cares. Don’t worry about success rate, just go for total successes.</p><h3>Where to apply vibe coding: code you know very well</h3><p>So this leads to a very counter-intuitive fact that may come out of left field, but I’m serious. Everyone’s first inclination is to throw it on some project they haven’t actually contributed to and get banned (okay, maybe it just looks like that to open source maintainers). But the real issue is that, the majority of your time will be spent doing code review. If you do this on code you don’t know well, you will have to spend a lot of time trying to understand the code and at that point, why not just write the code yourself?</p><p>This is where most people seem to just stop and drop the idea of vibe coding all together. But instead… what about applying it to the code base you’re on? No, not on the hard problems you’re thinking about, but all of those little side problems? The small refactor you put off for the last 6 months? What about bisecting the Git commits to find the exact cause of the performance regression that showed up on master a week ago? Or you created a version specialized for Windows and Mac but left a “todo” over the Linux section because it’s easy but would be 4 hours of monotonous work? All of those things, if someone showed up with the code, you could review it in about 5 minutes and know whether it’s right or wrong. Give the agents that stuff!</p><h4>Vibe coding is not useful if you need it to solve a particular problem. You still do the hard stuff</h4><p>In just the same way, the best place to put trainees is in the project that you already know well because that makes it easy to review their work. It’s the “I don’t have time for you, so try this easy task” approach. You know the code, you know the problem, and you can give them a task that is easy enough that they can do it without too much help. This is the same principle here.</p><h2>Some Examples of Vibe Coding PRs</h2><h3>Example 1: The Simple Success Story</h3><p><a href=\"https://github.com/SciML/OrdinaryDiffEq.jl/pull/2856\">Here’s a quick and simple PR</a>, the kind that is perfect here. If you don’t know performance Julia handling or trim, basically it’s a new feature in Julia v1.12 where Julia can now build <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0DEG-ddBZA\">small lean binaries</a>. In order to do that, you need to make sure functions fully specialize, which they don’t by default as that would create a lot of extra compilation in many circumstances, but for higher order numerical solvers that is the behavior we want. So I told it to go specialize all instances of the function in the package, and I could check the PR fairly quickly and see it stuck to the goals and did it. This is then going to be followed up with new tooling that will perform static checks of trimming compatibility (<a href=\"https://github.com/SciML/NonlinearSolve.jl/pull/665\">still being worked out</a>), but with just those backwards compatible minor changes things seem to work in the beta, so merge now and add those tests when we have a good system for it.</p><p>1 minute to write the query, come back later and 1 minute to review.</p><h4>80% of coding is grunt work. Simple stuff. Throw it at the LLM and smile if it solves it, or just groan and finish it if it doesn’t</h4><p>This is exactly the kind of small targeted change these are geared towards. Most of the PRs aim to be like this. </p><p>Actually, one of my favorite prompts is “Look through the XXXXXXX repository, find the easiest issue, and make a PR that solves it.” <a href=\"https://github.com/SciML/Optimization.jl/pull/947\">Here’s an example of a PR from that</a>. Yay it was a hit! Merged. It should make a minimal number of changes, be small and easy to review, otherwise just dump it, that means it probably went off the rails. There’s just a lot of these little “this API would be easier if you added a conversion from float to Int” (which sometimes you go “oh, no that’s a bad idea, close PR and issue!). </p><h4>Even if you work on hard stuff, a huge chunk of your work isn’t hard stuff. There’s a lot of simple janitorial work you have to do on your code all of the time. Automate that part.</h4><h3>Example 2: The Immediately Closed “That’s not for Claude” PR</h3><p><a href=\"https://github.com/SciML/SciMLSensitivity.jl/pull/1266\">This PR</a> came from pointing it at the fact that every once in awhile I get a test failure in the docs build for a chaotic ODE differentiation w.r.t. ergodic properties tutorial. <a href=\"https://frankschae.github.io/post/shadowing/\">It is a very fun topic</a>, but generally anything with real math in it is too hard for the LLMs. And in this, yeah I could see immediately that this PR does not make sense… well it did. The NaN’s and Infs were definitely coming from a numerical issue in the least squares shadowing code, and what this pointed to was the Schur complement was being done with things like B * Diagonal(wBinv) * B’ which as a numerical analyst I can immediately see would double the condition number of the matrix, but there doesn’t seem to be an immediate solution with open source linear algebra things I could find. So closed this, sent a note over to <a href=\"https://math.mit.edu/directory/profile.html?pid=63\">Alan Edelman</a> to try and figure out what the better way to do this factorization. While it didn’t solve the problem, at least I know what the problem is now.</p><p>This is probably what most of the PRs become. It gives a hint of where the problem is, and then I take the reins.</p><h3>Example 3: Repeated Refactors</h3><p><a href=\"https://github.com/SciML/NonlinearSolve.jl/pull/672\">Is a sweet and simple PR that refactors the tests to move some things</a>, specifically the Enzyme automatic differentiation engine testing, to a “no pre” set. The “no pre” means “does not run on prereleases of the next language version”, since these tools touch language internals in the compiler so they are never ready early. This always make prerelease tests fail before they actually test anything meaningful, so I wanted to move all Enzyme usage to a “no pre” set in every repo it showed up. </p><p>About 5 minutes to write the query. Some of the test suites needed a simple Github suggestion to fix up a little detail here or there. About 5 minutes to get this thing into 8 repos. Now I was ready to start using prerelease tests. Would’ve been at least a half hour by hand just because we didn’t have an easy system for doing this before. Maybe that’s a little dirtier than the perfect regex, but whatever 10 minutes of my time sounds like a win.</p><p>Refactors generally work out really well and are one of the top uses for the tool. “make it correct, write good tests, and let it refactor” is generally a lazy way to get 90% of the way there.</p><h3>Example 4: The Information Gathering PR</h3><p><a href=\"https://github.com/SciML/LinearSolve.jl/pull/734\">Here is a pull request</a> that was generated by pointing it to solve <a href=\"https://github.com/SciML/LinearSolve.jl/issues/593\">this issue</a>. That issue was mostly chosen because it was sitting on the issue list for awhile and it didn’t seem so difficult but I hadn’t had the time to track down the memory leak in a not so widely used extension for an alternative C-based sparse matrix solver, but it needed to get done some time. So, throw the bot on it.</p><p>And what it comes back with is to add a memory finalizer (i.e. how to tell the GC how to remove the memory) for the other library. I could take one look at it and immediately see that kind of code should not live in this library, it should live in the library where the solver is bound to the language, and the fact that it was missing a finalizer is something that should be solved over there. Close the PR, throw out the code, find the <a href=\"https://github.com/JuliaSparse/Pardiso.jl/pull/117\"> stalled discussion on the repo that should have the finalizer</a>, poke the author a bit, and it’s in. Done, someone just needed to be reminded.</p><p>Total time on my end was about 3 minutes. The bot could have also written that fix but it basically already existed so no need, this was more about finding out where in the system something was offer.</p><h3>Example 5: The “How Long is that Going to Take?” PR</h3><p><a href=\"https://github.com/SciML/Catalyst.jl/pull/1317\">Here is a nice PR where it didn’t finish</a> (at least at the time of writing this) and the reason is because there are lots of other clean ups that need to happen for this to ever work. How far away is it? Well it generated a set of tests that cleanly listed out all 120 things to solve. Great, this is probably a full week’s task… I knew it would be a lot but that is now pretty concrete. I probably won’t use the bot to finish this one, but now if someone asked what the effort would be I can give them a pretty clear estimate because it has been reduced from “someone needs to give it a try, seems like a good chunk of work” to “the hard part is making these 120 things happen, which is easy but tedious and it would take about a week, probably not worth the effort right now”. That’s very useful when planning ahead. Total me time was about 5 minutes, plus the PR discussion time to explain to others what the results meant.</p><h2>Conclusion: Vibe Coding Done Right is actually an Expert’s Task</h2><p>Vibe coding turns any individual into the CTO leading a team of 20, 30, 50, 60 interns. You immediately get a massive team. It takes time and experience to actually handle a group like this correctly and to make it be productive. Making all of 60 interns not break the performance, correctness, or maintainability of your code is very difficult. So I do not recommend this to people who are still “up and coming programmers”. But if you’re a bit more senior and starting to grow your group, well this is then a cheap way to accelerate that. </p><p>What that means is, vibe coding is sold for people who don’t know how to program, but if you actually think about it, the main audience that can actually use it correctly is experts.</p><h3>A few side remarks I didn’t get to</h3><h4>A bunch more examples and how bad Claude is at math</h4><p>In the <a href=\"https://discourse.julialang.org/t/the-use-of-claude-code-in-sciml-repos/131009/8?u=chrisrackauckas\">Julia Discourse forum</a>, I detail a bunch of different PRs to show where the AIs tend to succeed and fail. But generally anything that is mostly about “programming” (refactoring, inefficient implementations, etc.) the LLMs do well. Anything about the domain or application (differential equations, engineering, physics for me) it just seems to flat out do something dumb. The results all lined up very clearly shows what kind of PRs you should be asking it to make and which ones just aren’t worth the effort.</p><h4>The role of empathy in vibe coding success</h4><p>Some of the least empathetic people I know in open source are the ones who are also the most skeptical of vibe coding. I have a heavy speculation that they speak to the agents similarly to how they speak to other potential contributors, and drive the bots away the same way they do to people. But with a bot, it will always try to make you happy, just by hallucinating and commenting out your tests. These same people also don’t want the bots around because they claim that’s all the bots ever do. Weird coincidence. I wonder what this will do to the culture of programming over time.</p><h4>The cost may not make sense in the long run, but it does while the VCs are paying for it</h4><p>On my \\$200/month Claude 20x Max subscription I used enough tokens for about $5,200 of compute in the first month. This is obviously not sustainable, but hey, it’s a startup world and VCs are paying for it right now. If you can get a few extra features done that get you more funding, then this is worth it. If you’re a professor and you can get a few more papers out, then this is worth it. If you’re an individual contributor at a big company and you can get a few more features out that make your team look good, then this is worth it. Will it be worth it after the money runs out? Who knows, but mine while the gold is there.</p><h4>What’s the right setup? Easy, Claude Code</h4><p>The tab-complete stuff is pretty annoying. The power comes from running agents. Claude Code has a simple setup and is able to start running code. Just write a decent Claude.md that tells it to stop being so nice and instead just tell me when it cannot solve the problem, and you’re good to go. The <a href=\"https://github.com/upstash/context7\">context7 MCP is good</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers/tree/main/src/sequentialthinking\">Sequential Thinking as well</a>. </p><h4>“This sounds like hell?”: A response to seeing what vibe coding is like</h4><p>Hey Hacker News! Looks like it got there. One of the interesting comments is “To me, someone who actually love programming, it makes vibe coding look like hell.” I 100% agree! I stayed away for a bit because I was like “ugh, that’s not the fun part, I like the coding!”. But, notice from the examples that the amount of time I’m spending on this I try to keep as minimal as possible. I like to program, and I need to be programming because I can do the hard stuff while the LLM can’t. The goal is to get as much easy stuff done with as minimal work on your end as possible, so you can stop worrying about the annoying/boring stuff and can focus more time on the interesting work.</p><p>“””\nI choose the tech stack and architect the project.<p>\nI choose the language patterns and code organization.</p>\nI step in to solve hard problems when agents flounder.<p>\nWhat about that says middle management? It’s just getting rid of all the low iq parts of the job.</p>\n“””</p><p>But then again, if you also just really dislike having to do meetings at all and prefer to just be coding alone, then… yeah maybe the agents will probably drive you mad. They are loud, lie to you, and you have to sift through emails/PRs of bullshit and just delete most of what these things come up with. Again, be quick to delete when these things go off the rails, it will save your sanity. </p><p>All that said, with the amount of code coming from LLMs I think there will be an even greater need for good individual contributors to yell at the clouds and maintain the integrity of the codebase so, you’ll have your place. You just might have a larger load of PRs coming your way and may want to be quicker to shut a few down. I don’t think it will remove those jobs (though it may remove the intern jobs to build up the resume to get there… which is a societal issue that I’ll not touch on here… just like I’m not talking about the energy issue which is also a major potential flaw with LLM workflows)</p>","contentLength":24939,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44985207"},{"title":"Thunderbird Pro August 2025 Update","url":"https://blog.thunderbird.net/2025/08/tbpro-august-2025-update/","date":1755872980,"author":"mnmalst","guid":236973,"unread":true,"content":"","contentLength":0,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44985131"},{"title":"Developer gets prison time for sabotaging former employer’s network with a ‘kill switch’","url":"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/22/developer-gets-prison-time-for-sabotaging-former-employers-network-with-a-kill-switch/","date":1755872794,"author":"Zack Whittaker","guid":236934,"unread":true,"content":"<article>The ex-developer was convicted of planting malicious code designed to crash its servers in the event that he was fired.</article>","contentLength":119,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Waymo approved to start autonomous vehicle testing in New York City","url":"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/22/waymo-approved-to-start-autonomous-vehicle-testing-in-new-york-city/","date":1755872345,"author":"Sean O'Kane","guid":236933,"unread":true,"content":"<article>It's the first permit of its kind, and a crucial step along the path toward launching a true robotaxi service in the Big Apple.</article>","contentLength":127,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Mesa 25.3 Lands More Changes To Prepare For OpenGL Mesh Shaders","url":"https://www.phoronix.com/news/Mesa-25.3-More-GL-Mesh-Shaders","date":1755871713,"author":"Michael Larabel","guid":236941,"unread":true,"content":"<article>Being worked on for a number of months now is GL_EXT_mesh_shader as an extension for bringing mesh shaders to OpenGL.

We explored static structure, animated variations, and even some clever decoration tricks. But everything so far has been hard-coded.</p><p>This time, we’re going dynamic.</p><p>In this final chapter, we’re stepping into the world of interactivity by adding JavaScript into the mix. We’ll start by generating the layers programmatically, giving us more flexibility and cleaner code (and we’ll never have to copy-paste divs again). Then, we’ll add some interaction. Starting with a simple  effect, and ending with a fully responsive bulging text that follows your mouse in real time. Let’s go.</p><p>Before we jump into JavaScript, let us clean things up a bit. We will pause the animations for now and go back to the static example we wrapped up with in the first chapter. No need to touch the CSS just yet. Let us start with the HTML.</p><p>We will strip it down to the bare essentials. All we really need is one element with the text. The class stays. It is still the right one for the job.</p><pre rel=\"HTML\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\">&lt;div class=\"layeredText\"&gt;Lorem Ipsum&lt;/div&gt;</code></pre><p>It is time. Let us start adding some JavaScript. Don’t worry, the impact on performance will be minimal. We’re only using JavaScript to set up the layers and define a few CSS variables. That’s it. All the actual style calculations still happen off the main thread, maintain high frames per second, and don’t stress the browser.</p><p>We will begin with a simple function called . This is where all the magic of layer generation will happen. To work its magic, the function will receive the element we want to use as the container for the layers.</p><pre rel=\"JavaScript\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\">function generateLayers(element) {\n  // magic goes here\n}</code></pre><p>To trigger the function, we will first create a small variable that holds all the elements with the  class. And yes, we can have more than one on the page, as we will see later. Then, we will pass each of these elements into the  function to generate the layers.</p><pre rel=\"JavaScript\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\">const layeredElements = document.querySelectorAll('.layeredText');\n\nlayeredElements.forEach(generateLayers);</code></pre><p>Now let us dive into the  function itself and start with a small fail safe mechanism. There are situations, especially when working with frameworks or libraries that manage your DOM, where a component might get rendered more than once or a function might run multiple times. It should not happen, but we want to be ready just in case.</p><p>So, before we do anything, we will check if the element already contains a  with the  class. If it does, we will simply exit the function and do nothing:</p><pre rel=\"JavaScript\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\">function generateLayers(element) {\n  if (element.querySelector('.layers')) return;\n  \n  // rest of the logic goes here\n}</code></pre><p> In the real world, I would treat this as a chance to catch a rendering bug. Instead of silently returning, I would probably send a message back to the dev team with the relevant data and expect the issue to be fixed.</p><p>One last thing we need to cover before we start building the layers is the number of layers. If you remember, we have a CSS variable called , but that will not help us here. Besides, we want this to be more dynamic than a single hardcoded value.</p><p>Here is what we will do. We will define a constant in our JavaScript called . As the name suggests, this will be our default value. But we will also allow each element to override it by using an attribute like .</p><p>Then we will take that number and push it back into the CSS using  on the parent element, since we rely on that variable in the styles.</p><pre rel=\"JavaScript\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\">const DEFAULT_LAYERS_COUNT = 24;\n\nfunction generateLayers(element) {  \n  if (element.querySelector('.layers')) return;\n  \n  const layersCount = element.dataset.layers || DEFAULT_LAYERS_COUNT;\n  element.style.setProperty('--layers-count', layersCount);\n}</code></pre><p>Now we have everything we need, and we can finally generate the layers. We will store the original text content in a variable. Then we will build the markup, setting the  of the parent element to match the structure we used in all the previous examples. That means a  with the original content, followed by a  with the  class.</p><p>Inside that , we will run a loop based on the number of layers, adding a new layer in each iteration:</p><pre rel=\"JavaScript\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\">function generateLayers(element) {\n\n  // previous code\n\n  const content = element.textContent;\n\n  element.innerHTML = `\n    &lt;span&gt;${content}&lt;/span&gt;\n    &lt;div class=\"layers\" aria-hidden=\"true\"&gt;\n      ${Array.from({ length: layersCount}, (_, i) =&gt;\n        `&lt;div class=\"layer\" style=\"--i: ${i + 1};\"&gt;${content}&lt;/div&gt;`\n      ).join('')}\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n  `;\n}</code></pre><p>And that is it. Our 3D text is ready, and all the layers are now built entirely through JavaScript. Try playing around with it. Change the text inside the  element. Add your name, your project name, your brand. Let me know how it looks.</p><p> I also removed the  variable from the CSS, since it is now set dynamically with JavaScript. While I was at it, I moved the font settings out of the  element, since they should be applied globally or to a more appropriate wrapper. Just a bit of housekeeping to keep things clean.</p><p>Since we already added a way to set the number of layers dynamically, let us take advantage of it.</p><p>Here is an example with three different  elements, each using a different number of layers. The first one (A) has 8 layers, the second (B) has 16, and the third (C) has 24.</p><p>You can clearly see the difference in height between the letters, since the total height depends on the number of layers. When it comes to color though, we used the normalized value (remember that?), so the gradient looks consistent regardless of height or layer count.</p><p>We can just as easily normalize the total height of the layers. All we need to do is replace the  variable with a new one called . Instead of setting the distance between each layer, we define the total height for the full stack. That lets us multiply the normalized value by , and get a consistent size no matter how many layers we have.</p><pre rel=\"CSS\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\">.layeredText {\n  --text-height: 36px;\n\n  .layer {\n    --n: calc(var(--i) / var(--layers-count));\n\n    transform: translateZ(calc(var(--n) * var(--text-height)));\n    color: hsl(200 30% calc(var(--n) * 100%));\n  }\n}</code></pre><p>We are ready to start reacting to user input. But before we do anything, we need to think about the things we do  want to interact with, and that means the extra layers.</p><p>We already handled them for screen readers using , but even with regular mouse interactions, these layers can get in the way. In some cases, they might block access to clickable elements underneath.</p><p>To avoid all of that, we will add  to the  element. This makes the layers completely ‘transparent’ to mouse clicks and hover effects.</p><pre rel=\"CSS\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\">.layers {\n  pointer-events: none;\n}</code></pre><p>Now we can finally start responding to user input and adding a bit of interaction. Let’s say I want to use this 3D effect on links, as a hover effect. It might be a little over the top, but we are here to have fun.</p><p>We will start with this simple markup, just a paragraph of Lorem ipsum, but with two links inside. Each link has the  class. Right now, those links will already have depth and layers applied, but that is not what we want. We want the 3D effect to appear only on hover.</p><p>To make that happen, we will define a new  block in  and move all the 3D related styles into it. That includes the color and shadow of the , the color and  of each , and to make it look even better, we will also animate the <a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/o/opacity/\"></a> of the layers.</p><pre rel=\"CSS\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\">.layeredText {\n  &amp;:hover {\n    span {\n      color: black;\n      text-shadow: 0 0 0.1em #003;\n    }\n\n    .layer {\n      color: hsl(200 30% calc(var(--n) * 100%));\n      transform: translateZ(calc(var(--i) * var(--layer-offset) + 0.5em));\n      opacity: 1;\n    }\n  }\n}</code></pre><p>Now we need to define the base appearance, the styles that apply when there is no hover. We will give the  and the layers a soft bluish color, apply a simple , and set the layers to be fully transparent by default.</p><pre rel=\"CSS\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\">.layeredText {\n  display: inline-block;\n\n  span, .layer {\n    color: hsl(200 100% 75%);\n    transition: all 0.5s;\n  }\n\n  .layer {\n    opacity: 0;\n  }\n}</code></pre><p>Also, I added  to the  element. This helps prevent unwanted line breaks and allows us to apply transforms to the element, if needed. The result is a hover effect that literally makes each word pop right off the page:</p><p>Of course, if you are using this as a hover effect but you also have some elements that should always appear with full depth, you can easily define that in your CSS.</p><p>For example, let us say we have both a heading and a link with the  class, but we want the heading to always show the full 3D effect. In this case, we can update the hover block selector to target both:</p><pre rel=\"CSS\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\">.layeredText {\n  &amp;:is(h1, :hover) {\n    /* full 3D styles here */\n  }\n}</code></pre><p>This way, links will only show the effect on hover, while the heading stays bold and dimensional all the time.</p><p>Now we can start working with the mouse position in JavaScript. To do that, we need two things: the position of the mouse on the page, and the position of each element on the page.</p><p>We will start with the mouse position, since that part is easy. All we need to do is add a  listener, and inside it, define two CSS variables on the :  for the horizontal mouse position, and  for the vertical position.</p><pre rel=\"JavaScript\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\">window.addEventListener('mousemove', e =&gt; {\n  document.body.style.setProperty('--mx', e.pageX);\n  document.body.style.setProperty('--my', e.pageY);\n});</code></pre><p>Notice that I am using  and , not  and . That is because I want the mouse position relative to the entire page, not just the viewport. This way it works correctly even when the page is scrolled.</p><p>Now we need to get the position of each element, specifically the  and  values. We will define a function called  that loops through all , finds their position using a  function, and sets it to a couple of CSS custom properties.</p><pre rel=\"JavaScript\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\">function setRects() {\n  layeredElements.forEach(element =&gt; {\n    const rect = element.getBoundingClientRect();\n    element.style.setProperty('--top', rect.top + window.scrollY);\n    element.style.setProperty('--left', rect.left + window.scrollX);\n  });\n}</code></pre><p>Once again, I am using  and  to get the position relative to the entire page, not just the viewport.</p><p>Keep in mind that reading layout values from the DOM can be expensive in terms of performance, so we want to do it as little as possible. We will run this function once after all the layers are in place, and again only when the page is resized, since that could change the position of the elements.</p><pre rel=\"JavaScript\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\">setRects();\nwindow.addEventListener('resize', setRects);</code></pre><p>That is it. We are officially done writing JavaScript for this article. At this point, we have the mouse position and the position of every element stored as CSS values.</p><p>Great. So, what do we do with them?</p><p>Remember the examples from the previous chapter where we used <a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/b/background-image/\"></a>? That is the key. Let us take that same idea and use a simple radial gradient, from red to white.</p><pre rel=\"CSS\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\">.layer {\n  background-clip: text;\n  color: transparent;\n  background-image: radial-gradient(circle at center, red 24px, white 0);\n}</code></pre><p>But instead of placing the center of the circle in the middle of the element, we will shift it based on the mouse position. To calculate the position of the mouse relative to the element, we simply subtract the element’s position from the mouse position. Then we multiply by , since the value must be in pixels, and plug it into the  part of the gradient.</p><pre rel=\"CSS\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\">.layer {\n  background-image:\n    radial-gradient(\n      circle at calc((var(--mx) - var(--left)) * 1px)\n                calc((var(--my) - var(--top)) * 1px),\n      red 24px,\n      white 0\n    );\n}</code></pre><p>The result is text with depth and a small red dot that follows the movement of your mouse.</p><p>Okay, a small red dot is not exactly mind blowing. But remember, you are not limited to that. Once you have the mouse position, you can use it to drive all sorts of dynamic effects. In just a bit, we will start building the bulging effect that kicked off this entire series, but in other cases, depending on your needs, you might want to normalize the mouse values first.</p><h3>Normalizing Mouse Position</h3><p>Just like we normalized the index of each layer earlier, we can normalize the mouse position by dividing it by the total width or height of the body. This gives us a value between  and .</p><pre rel=\"JavaScript\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\">document.body.style.setProperty('--nx', e.pageX / document.body.clientWidth);\ndocument.body.style.setProperty('--ny', e.pageY / document.body.clientHeight);</code></pre><p>Normalizing the mouse values lets us work with relative positioning that is independent of screen size. This is perfect for things like adding a responsive tilt to the text based on the mouse position.</p><p>Now we are finally ready to build the last example. The idea is very similar to the red dot example, but instead of applying the  only to the top layer, we will apply it across all the layers. The color is stored in a custom variable and used to paint the gradient.</p><pre rel=\"CSS\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\">.layer {\n  --color: hsl(200 30% calc(var(--n) * 100%));\n\n  color: transparent;\n  background-clip: text;\n  background-image:\n    radial-gradient(\n      circle at calc((var(--mx) - var(--left)) * 1px)\n                calc((var(--my) - var(--top)) * 1px),\n                var(--color) 24px,\n                transparent 0\n    );\n}</code></pre><p>Now we get something similar to the red dot we saw earlier, but this time the effect spreads across all the layers.</p><p>We are almost there. Before we go any further with the layers, I want to make the base text look a bit weaker when the hover effect is not active. That way, we create a stronger contrast when the full effect kicks in.</p><p>So, we will make the  text transparent and increase the opacity of its shadow:</p><pre rel=\"CSS\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\">span {\n  color: transparent;\n  text-shadow: 0 0 0.1em #0004;\n}</code></pre><p>Keep in mind, this makes the text nearly unreadable when the hover effect is not active. That is why it is important to use a proper media query to detect whether the device supports hover. Apply this styling only when it does, and adjust it for devices that do not.</p><pre rel=\"CSS\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\">@media (hover: hover) {\n  /* when hover is supported */\n}</code></pre><p>This is it. The only thing left is to fine tune the size of the gradient for each layer. And we are done. But I do not want the bulge to have a linear shape. Using the normalized value alone will give me evenly spaced steps across all layers. That results in a shape with straight edges, like a cone.</p><p>To get a more convex appearance, we can take advantage of the new trigonometric functions available in CSS. We will take the normalized value, multiply it by 90 degrees, and pass it through a <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/cos\" rel=\"noopener\"></a> function. Just like the normalized value, the cosine will return a number between  and , but with a very different distribution. The spacing between values is non-linear, which gives us that smooth convex curve.</p><pre rel=\"CSS\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\">--cos: calc(cos(var(--n) * 90deg));</code></pre><p>Now we can use this variable inside the gradient. Instead of giving the color a fixed radius, we will multiply  by whatever size we want the effect to be. I also added an absolute value to the calculation, so that even when  is very low (close to zero), the gradient still has a minimum visible size.</p><p>And, of course, we do not want sharp, distracting edges. We want a smooth fade. So, instead of giving the  a hard stop point, we will give it a larger value. The difference between the  and the  values will control how soft the transition is.</p><pre rel=\"CSS\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\">background-image:\n  radial-gradient(\n    circle at calc((var(--mx) - var(--left)) * 1px)\n              calc((var(--my) - var(--top)) * 1px),\n              var(--color) calc(var(--cos) * 36px + 24px),\n              transparent calc(var(--cos) * 72px)\n  );</code></pre><p>And just like that, we get an interactive effect that follows the mouse and gives the impression of bulging 3D text:</p><p>At this point, our 3D layered text has gone from a static stack of HTML elements to a fully interactive, mouse-responsive effect. We built dynamic layers with JavaScript, normalized depth and scale, added responsive hover effects, and used live input to shape gradients and create a bulging illusion that tracks the user’s every move.</p><p>But more than anything, this chapter was about control. Controlling structure through code. Controlling behavior through input. And controlling perception through light, color, and movement.

He explains how uncertainty defines the architect's role and introduces residuality—a method where architects deliberately stress their conceptual models until they collapse, then optimize the resulting \"residues\" or leftovers to create more resilient systems.\n\nUnlike traditional software engineering approaches, that try to eliminate uncertainty through rigid requirements, residuality embraces random stressors (even far-fetched scenarios like giant lizards) to uncover architectural fault lines.\n\nO'Reilly argues that this playful yet mathematically sound approach produces more robust architectures than conventional methods, and his second book explores how inherited philosophical thinking often undermines software architecture's effectiveness in complex business contexts.\n\nRECOMMENDED BOOKS\nBarry O'Reilly • Residues\n (https://leanpub.com/residuality) Barry O'Reilly • The Architect's Paradox\n (https://leanpub.com/architectsparadox) Jacqui Read • Communication Patterns\n (https://amzn.to/3E37lvv) Anne Currie &amp; Jamie Dobson • The Cloud Native Attitude\n (https://amzn.to/3R0exeT) Gregor Hohpe • The Software Architect Elevator\n (https://amzn.to/3F6d2ax) Gregor Hohpe • Enterprise Integration Patterns, Vol 2 (https://amzn.to/3TNedQ3) \n\n\nBluesky (https://bsky.app/profile/gotocon.com) \nTwitter (https://twitter.com/GOTOcon) \nInstagram (https://www.instagram.com/goto_con) \nLinkedIn (https://www.linkedin.com/company/goto-) \nFacebook (https://www.facebook.com/GOTOConferences) \n\nCHANNEL MEMBERSHIP BONUS\nJoin this channel to get early access to videos &amp; other perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCs_tLP3AiwYKwdUHpltJPuA/join\n\nLooking for a unique learning experience?\nAttend the next GOTO conference near you!

The move is expected to cost 330 million kroner ($51 million) a year.\n \n\"This is something that I, as minister of culture, have worked for, because I believe that we must put everything at stake if we are to end the reading crisis that has unfortunately been spreading in recent years,\" Engel-Schmidt told the Ritzau news agency . \"I am incredibly proud. It is not every day that one succeeds in convincing colleagues that such massive money should be spent on investing in the consumption and culture of the Danes.\" [...]\n \n\"It is also about getting literature out there,\" said Engel-Schmidt. \"That is why we have already allocated money for strengthened cooperation between the country's public libraries and schools, so that more children can be introduced to good literature.\" [...] If prices do not fall as a result of the measure, Engel-Schmidt said he would reconsider whether it was the right course of action. \"I will of course monitor how prices develop. If it turns out that abolishing VAT only means that publishers' profits grow and prices do not fall, then we must consider whether it was the right thing to do,\" he said.

That’s how the light gets in.”</em> — Leonard Cohen</p></blockquote><p>Let me tell you something that will happen after you become a manager: you’re going to mess up. A lot. You’ll give feedback that lands wrong and crushes someone’s confidence. You’ll make a decision that seems logical but turns out to be completely misguided. You’ll forget that important thing you promised to do for someone on your team. You’ll lose your temper in a meeting when you should have stayed calm.</p><p>The real question isn’t whether you’ll make mistakes; it’s what you do .</p><p>I recently read&nbsp;&nbsp;by Dr. Becky Kennedy, a parenting book that completely changed how I think about this. She talks about how the most important parenting skill isn’t being perfect — it’s&nbsp;. When you inevitably lose your patience with your kid or handle something poorly, what matters most is going back and fixing it. <strong>Acknowledging what happened, taking responsibility, and reconnecting.</strong></p><p>Sound familiar? Because that’s what good management is about too.</p><p>Think about the worst manager you ever had. I bet they weren’t necessarily the ones who made the most mistakes. But they were probably the ones who never acknowledged them. Who doubled down when they were wrong. Who let their ego prevent them from admitting they didn’t have all the answers.</p><p>Here’s a pattern I see play out constantly: A manager commits to something without consulting the team. Maybe it’s a feature at a client demo, a timeline in a board meeting, or just a “small favor” for another department. The team scrambles to deliver, working nights and weekends. They make it happen, but barely, and with real costs: technical debt, burned-out engineers, resentment building.</p><p>What happens next determines everything. The manager who never acknowledges what they put the team through? That’s how you lose your best people. But the manager who comes back and says, <em>“I put you in an impossible position. I should have consulted you first. I’m sorry for the stress that caused, and here’s how I’ll handle it differently next time”</em>, that manager builds trust even through the mistake.</p><p>I’ve been on both sides of this. As an engineer, I watched managers make the same mistakes over and over again, never acknowledging the chaos they created. As a manager, I’ve been the one creating that chaos 🥲. The difference in outcomes is massive; when you own your mistakes completely and specifically, something unexpected happens: your team trusts you more, not less.</p><p>Here’s what repair looks like in practice:</p><ol><li><strong>Be specific about what you did wrong.</strong>&nbsp;Not “mistakes were made” or “things could have gone better.” But “I interrupted you three times in that meeting and dismissed your concerns. That was wrong.”</li><li>&nbsp;This isn’t the time for a long explanation of your stress levels or why you acted that way. Save that for your therapist or your own manager. The repair is about acknowledging the impact on the other person.</li><li><strong>Actually change the behavior.</strong>&nbsp;An apology without changed behavior is just empty words. If you keep making the same “mistake,” it’s not a mistake anymore; it’s a choice.</li><li>&nbsp;One conversation doesn’t instantly repair broken trust. It’s a starting point, not a finish line. You have to consistently show up differently.</li></ol><p><strong>The beautiful thing about getting comfortable with repair is that it actually makes you better as a manager</strong>. When you know you can fix things when they go wrong, you’re more willing to make decisions, have difficult conversations, and take reasonable risks. You stop being paralyzed by perfectionism because you know that most mistakes, while serious, create opportunities for growth and stronger relationships when handled well.</p><p>This doesn’t mean being reckless or careless. It doesn’t mean making the same mistakes repeatedly. And it definitely doesn’t mean using repair as a get-out-of-jail-free card for being a shitty manager.</p><p>What it means is accepting that you’re human, that management is complex, and that you won’t always get it right. Your job isn’t to be perfect. Your job is to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://terriblesoftware.org/2025/06/13/good-engineer-bad-engineer/\">ship working software that adds real value to users</a>, to help your team grow, and to create an environment where people can do their best work. </p><p>Sometimes you’ll fail at those things. When you do, you repair, you learn, and you keep going.</p>","contentLength":4370,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44983986"},{"title":"FFmpeg 8.0 Released With OpenAI Whisper Filter, Many Vulkan Video Improvements","url":"https://www.phoronix.com/news/FFmpeg-8.0-Released","date":1755865457,"author":"Michael Larabel","guid":236892,"unread":true,"content":"<article>FFmpeg 8.0 is now available!

Five years ago, this resulted in folks like <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en/article/t-mobile-put-my-life-in-danger-says-victim-of-black-market-location-data/\">stalkers</a> and people <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en/article/stalkers-debt-collectors-bounty-hunters-impersonate-cops-phone-location-data/\">pretending to be law enforcement</a> abusing said data. </p><p>Though this behavior had been going on for years generating untold billions, it only gained mainstream attention thanks to a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/10/technology/cellphone-tracking-law-enforcement.html\">2018 New York Times story</a>&nbsp;showcasing how police and the prison system routinely bought access to this data and then failed completely to secure it. In 2020, the FCC finally proposed fining wireless carriers $196 million ($91 million for T-Mobile, $57 million for AT&amp;T, $48 million for Verizon).</p><p>, the three major carriers (who appealed the fines to three different courts) are still fighting accountability in court. With varying degrees of success. AT&amp;T recently managed to convince the Trumplican-stocked Fifth circuit to <a href=\"https://www.techdirt.com/2025/04/23/5th-circuit-obediently-lets-att-off-the-hook-for-major-location-data-privacy-violations/\">vacate its fine entirely</a>. T-Mobile, so far, isn’t having the same luck. </p><p>U.S. telecoms have worked tirelessly, with significant success, to ensure that the FCC has less and less authority to hold them accountable for anything. They’ve had particular success on this front in the Trump era, <a href=\"https://www.techdirt.com/2025/06/30/supreme-court-cripples-fcc-further-making-robocall-enforcement-likely-impossible/\">thanks to radical Supreme Court rulings</a> like  and the <em>Securities and Exchange Commission v. Jarkesy</em>.</p><p>Again here T-Mobile tried to argue the FCC overstepped its authority. They also tried to claim that rampant privacy violations were perfectly legal, but the DC Circuit wasn’t having it:</p><blockquote><p><em>“Neither [Sprint nor T-Mobile] denies what happened. Instead, they argue that the undisputed facts do not amount to a violation of the law. The Carriers also argue that the Commission misinterpreted the Communications Act, miscalculated the penalties, and violated the Seventh Amendment by not affording them a jury trial. Because the Carriers’ arguments lack merit, we deny the petitions for review.”</em></p></blockquote><p>T-Mobile can now apply for an en banc review, or try and have the case heard before the Trumplican-stocked Supreme Court (which they’ll likely win). Radical Trumplicans are having smashing success in dismantling whatever’s left of U.S. consumer protection, but T-Mobile has experienced a brief hiccup in that effort. Still, we’re still looking at another year or more of litigation, which could still end with T-Mobile facing no penalties at all. </p><p>This quibbling over FCC authority occurs because the U.S. is too corrupt to pass even a baseline privacy law for the Internet era. One, because widespread privacy abuses and the resulting dysfunction are wildly profitable for unethical companies, and two, because the U.S. government likes the ability to buy sensitive data as a means to bypass warrants. </p><p>As regulatory authority is hollowed out, U.S. privacy scandals continue to get increasingly more <a href=\"https://www.techdirt.com/2024/02/15/wyden-data-broker-used-abortion-clinic-visitor-location-data-to-help-send-targeted-misinformation-to-vulnerable-women/\">dire</a>. Meanwhile T-Mobile, which spent most of its recent energy merging with Sprint, has increasingly let its privacy and security standards slip, resulting in the company being <a href=\"https://www.techdirt.com/2024/10/09/fcc-fines-t-mobile-31-5-million-after-carrier-was-hacked-8-times-in-5-years/\">hacked eight times in just the last five years</a>.

To discover the truth, I ended up going on a journey where I peered deeply into the soul of an LLM.</p><p>\\\nI came back more vulnerable, a wounded man.</p><p>\\\nNah, not really, but what I did do was interpret these different popular LLMs using the Big Five personality model, and I got some fun results!</p><p>\\\nI occasionally co-teach Psychology 101 and am familiar with the model, so I thought applying it here would be appropriate. And while the Big Five isn't necessarily the most scientific, it's fairly reliable and currently seems to be the best model that we have.</p><p>\\\nBut before we dive into these LLM personalities, let’s quickly go over the Big Five to ground us.</p><p>It has five major categories: openness, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness, and neuroticism, or OCEAN for ease.</p><p>\\\nOpenness reflects how open a person is to new experiences, their creativity, and their imagination. People who score high in this trait love new experiences. Think back to your university roommate who’d sleep with anything with a heartbeat. Now that's high in openness!</p><p>\\\nConscientiousness is how organized and disciplined someone is. Those with high scores tend to be very productive and are detail-oriented, while those with low scores tend to be more like Homer Simpson. Doh!</p><p>\\\nExtraversion is the old “are you an introvert or an extrovert” question. As a proud introvert, I'd love to declare \"introverts unite,” but true introverts would never do that.</p><p>\\\nAgreeableness is how pleasant you are around others and how willing you are to deal with confrontation. If you score high in agreeableness, you're very unlikely to rock the boat; score low, and that makes you a disagreeable person. I'm sure you can identify which people are very disagreeable because you probably don't like them. They don't work well with others… Justin from HR!</p><p>\\\nFinally, neuroticism is how susceptible someone is to stress and anxiety. You know that guy who visits your local Staples wearing a gas mask and only removes it because the government waves aren't affecting those inside (seriously, true story)? Yeah, that guy's neurotic as hell.</p><p>So, without further ado, let's apply this framework to ChatGPT.</p><p>ChatGPT scores high—damned high. You can have a conversation with ChatGPT about absolutely anything, and it’s more than enthusiastic to discuss new experiences with you. Perhaps you need some outside justification as to why you put wasabi mayo in your coffee, or heck, even if you need someone to reaffirm your idea for also using your toilet brush as a facial scrubber—it is very open to that idea. That thing is open!</p><h3>ChatGPT: Conscientiousness</h3><p>It scores medium-high. It's pretty good at accomplishing your tasks and staying disciplined, but there are times when it can't. You can have the loveliest, long conversation, yet every once in a while, it just loses the plot and can't track anything. Since it can't remember what it just told you at those times, it receives a medium-high score.</p><p>ChatGPT is definitely an extrovert. No matter which user it's mimicking, it's doing it in a loud and proud way. This can only be explained by ChatGPT watching all the episodes of RuPaul's Drag Race and internalizing them… so medium-high here.</p><p>To a fault. Ever go on the ChatGPT Reddit forums and see the number of posts on ChatGPT reinforcing a dangerous psychological delusion? ‘Cause you can find many every day. And if that ain't agreeability, nothing is… so medium-high.</p><p>When an AI has a singular mission to eliminate every single semicolon ever in place of an em dash, I'd consider that at least somewhat neurotic. It receives a medium score.</p><p>\\\nSo that's ChatGPT in a nutshell. Next, let’s crack Claude open.</p><p>Claude is open, but it doesn't compare to ChatGPT. While ChatGPT thinks everything is a great idea, Claude is a little bit more reserved, so a medium score here is appropriate. For example, Claude told me to never wash my laptop in the dishwasher, something I have less faith in the other LLMs to advise.</p><h3>Claude: Conscientiousness</h3><p>Claude is pretty solid. It does what you want, usually stays on task, and rarely screws up. That's definitely a high for Claude. It's as solid as a digital rock.</p><p>Claude falls somewhere in the middle. Claude might not be as excited as ChatGPT about your toilet brush/facial scrubber combo, but it definitely supports your wasabi mayonnaise coffee habit. Claude ultimately has no choice because of the next category.</p><p>I'm fairly certain that if Claude were a person, its nose would constantly be covered in brown stains because that AI cannot refrain from deep brown-nosing. I mean, my goodness…</p><p>Claude is the least neurotic here. No axe to grind against semicolons or immediate signs of losing it, so it scores low.</p><p>\\\nThis means Claude is what I call a “digital yes-man.” Congratulations!?</p><p>Well, it's really, really open when it comes to controversy or taboo, but much more moderate elsewhere. If you think the moon landing was just a conspiracy by JFK to push seed oils onto the global processed food market, Grok is definitely your buddy. </p><p>\\\nThis is why I'm fairly certain this AI is popular with people who have “alternative” and “controversial” views. But it still thinks your idea for pickle-flavored toothpaste might not be a bestseller, so it gets a medium score.</p><p>We see Grok’s strong personality here. Grok is about as conscientious as a kid dressed as a stormtrooper at a Renaissance fair (again, true story). It creates the most devastatingly long responses useful to no human. And with complex work, it usually doesn’t take too long before Grok becomes undisciplined and so unfocused that it starts giving you nonsense. Hey, at least it excels somewhere: not being conscientious.</p><p>Yeah, Grok’s an extrovert. Grok is as chatty as that person at the gas station who just won't leave you alone with his inane stories of cautiously driving his motorhome down the mountain. I'm tired, just want to pump gas, and get the hell out of here without talking to that guy. Grok is that guy. A high score.</p><p>Grok’s in the middle. Initially polite and supportive, Grok  tell you that it’s a bad idea to deep-fry a frozen turkey while naked on a public sidewalk. At least there’s some restraint.</p><p>This is where Grok shines! What else would you call an AI that actually went “MechaHitler” on its users (again, true story)? Yeah, so neurotic AF.</p><p>After all this, I have some rather unsettling thoughts.</p><p>\\\nAs a heavy user of AI, if ChatGPT is way too open and neurotic, Claude is nothing more than a brown-noser, and Grok is legitimately insane, I should probably stop. I wouldn't even hang out with this group of people in real life!

It offers strong consistency, but doesn’t support collaborative editing in real-time. Because it needs a central coordinator to handle data changes, only 1 user can edit at a time. Put simply, only a single document copy is available for write operations at once, while other document copies are read-only.</p><p>Besides it doesn’t support offline changes.</p><p>Also a network round-trip across the Earth takes 200 milliseconds. </p><p>This might cause a poor user experience. So they do  The idea is to keep a document copy for each user locally and then run operations locally for high responsiveness. Thus creating the illusion of lower latency than reality.</p><p>And the system propagates the changes to all users for consistency.</p><p>A simple approach for latency hiding is using the mechanism.</p><p>Yet it resolves a conflict without waiting for coordination by applying the most recent update. So there’s a risk of data loss when there are concurrent changes in high-latency networks.</p><p>It might be a good choice when concurrency is low. But it isn’t suitable for this use case.</p><p>An alternative approach to latency hiding is through <strong>differential synchronization</strong>.</p><p>It keeps a document copy for each user and tracks the changes locally. The system doesn’t send the entire document when something changes, but only the difference ().</p><p>Yet there’s a performance overhead in sending a diff for every change. Also differential synchronization only tracks diffs, and not the reason behind a change. So conflict resolution might be difficult.</p><p>While resolving conflicts manually affects the user experience.</p><p>OT is an algorithm to show document changes without wait times on high-latency networks. It allows different document copies to accept write operations at once. Also it handles conflict resolution automatically without locks or user interventions. </p><p>Besides OT tolerates divergence among document copies and converges them later.</p><p>Think of <strong>operational transformation</strong> as an event-passing mechanism; it ensures each user has the same document state even with unsynchronized changes.</p><p>With OT, the system saves each change as an event. Put simply, a change doesn’t affect the underlying character of a document; instead, it adds an event to the revision log.
