Entre estas herramientas,  destacan por su versatilidad y eficiencia. Aunque ambos servicios comparten el principio de la ejecuci√≥n sin servidores, tienen objetivos y funcionalidades distintas. En este art√≠culo, exploraremos las diferencias clave, sus ventajas y limitaciones, y cu√°ndo elegir cada uno.</p><p>AWS Glue es un servicio administrado de integraci√≥n de datos que facilita la preparaci√≥n, transformaci√≥n y carga de datos (ETL). Su funci√≥n principal es conectar diversas fuentes de datos, organizarlas y prepararlas para su posterior an√°lisis. AWS Glue es especialmente √∫til en escenarios donde se manejan grandes vol√∫menes de informaci√≥n y se necesita automatizar procesos repetitivos.</p><p><strong>Principales componentes de AWS Glue</strong></p><blockquote><ul><li> Repositorio centralizado que almacena los metadatos y define la estructura de las fuentes de datos.</li><li> Programas que examinan las fuentes de datos, detectan su estructura y actualizan autom√°ticamente el cat√°logo.</li><li> Procesos que ejecutan las transformaciones de datos, programados en Python o Scala.</li><li> Reglas que activan la ejecuci√≥n de trabajos seg√∫n un cronograma o la ocurrencia de ciertos eventos.</li><li> Entornos interactivos para escribir y probar el c√≥digo ETL.</li></ul></blockquote><blockquote><ul><li><strong>Automatizaci√≥n del Proceso ETL:</strong> Reduce significativamente el tiempo necesario para preparar datos gracias a la detecci√≥n autom√°tica de esquemas.</li><li> Se conecta de manera sencilla con otros servicios de AWS, como Amazon S3, Amazon Redshift y AWS Athena.</li><li> Ajusta la capacidad de procesamiento seg√∫n el volumen de datos.</li><li> Elimina la necesidad de gestionar infraestructura.</li></ul></blockquote><blockquote><ul><li> Al trabajar con un entorno distribuido basado en Apache Spark, el inicio de los trabajos puede tardar algunos minutos.</li><li><strong>Soporte de Lenguajes Limitado:</strong> Solo admite Python y Scala, lo que puede ser un inconveniente si se utilizan otros lenguajes en el ecosistema.</li><li> Para trabajos espor√°dicos o de poca carga, el costo puede resultar elevado en comparaci√≥n con otras alternativas.</li></ul></blockquote><p><strong>Ejemplo Diagrama de Arquitectura - Pipeline Glue</strong></p><p>AWS Lambda es un servicio serverless que permite ejecutar c√≥digo en respuesta a eventos espec√≠ficos sin la necesidad de aprovisionar ni gestionar servidores. Su uso es ideal para aplicaciones que requieren respuestas r√°pidas a eventos en tiempo real, como la carga de archivos en S3 o el procesamiento de mensajes de una cola.</p><p><strong>Principales componentes de AWS Lambda</strong></p><blockquote><ul><li> Fragmentos de c√≥digo que se ejecutan al activarse un evento.</li><li> Eventos que inician la ejecuci√≥n de las funciones, como cambios en bases de datos, flujos de eventos o solicitudes a trav√©s de API Gateway.</li><li> Elementos reutilizables que permiten compartir bibliotecas y configuraciones entre funciones.</li><li> Recibe y procesa eventos desde diversas fuentes, facilitando la construcci√≥n de arquitecturas basadas en eventos.</li></ul></blockquote><blockquote><p><strong>Ejecuci√≥n Basada en Eventos:</strong> Se activa autom√°ticamente al detectarse un evento relevante, eliminando la necesidad de supervisi√≥n constante.<strong>Soporte para M√∫ltiples Lenguajes:</strong> Compatible con Python, Node.js, Java, Go, Ruby y otros. Escala horizontalmente para manejar picos de demanda sin intervenci√≥n manual. Se paga √∫nicamente por el tiempo de ejecuci√≥n y el n√∫mero de invocaciones.</p></blockquote><blockquote><ul><li><strong>Tiempo M√°ximo de Ejecuci√≥n:</strong> Las funciones no pueden superar los 15 minutos de ejecuci√≥n, lo que limita su aplicaci√≥n en procesos extensos.</li><li> La memoria y el tiempo de procesamiento tienen l√≠mites que podr√≠an afectar cargas intensivas.</li><li> Al tratarse de un servicio sin estado, se necesita recurrir a otras herramientas, como DynamoDB, para almacenar informaci√≥n entre invocaciones.</li></ul></blockquote><p><strong>Ejemplo Diagrama de Arquitectura - Pipeline Lambda</strong></p><p><strong>Comparativa entre AWS Glue y AWS Lambda</strong></p><p>Aunque ambos servicios pertenecen al ecosistema serverless de AWS, tienen aplicaciones distintas. La siguiente tabla resume las diferencias m√°s relevantes:</p><p>AWS Glue es la mejor opci√≥n cuando se necesita:</p><ul><li>Realizar transformaciones complejas y procesamiento por lotes.</li><li>Gestionar y organizar metadatos para an√°lisis posteriores.</li><li>Automatizar tareas de integraci√≥n de datos en proyectos de Big Data.</li><li>Trabajar con datos almacenados en Amazon S3, Redshift o Data Lakes.</li></ul><p>\nUna empresa que procesa informaci√≥n de ventas hist√≥ricas para generar reportes mensuales podr√≠a usar AWS Glue para consolidar, limpiar y transformar estos datos de manera eficiente.</p><p>AWS Lambda es m√°s adecuado cuando:</p><ul><li>Se requieren respuestas inmediatas a eventos en tiempo real.</li><li>Se necesita construir microservicios ligeros y altamente escalables.</li><li>Se desea automatizar tareas basadas en eventos sin preocuparse por la infraestructura.</li><li>Se implementan flujos de trabajo orquestados con Step Functions.</li></ul><p>\nUna aplicaci√≥n que notifica en tiempo real a los clientes cada vez que se realiza una compra puede usar Lambda para procesar los eventos generados por las transacciones.</p><p>AWS Glue y AWS Lambda son herramientas poderosas en el ecosistema de AWS, pero est√°n orientadas a tareas diferentes. Mientras AWS Glue se destaca en el procesamiento y preparaci√≥n de datos a gran escala, AWS Lambda es ideal para ejecutar tareas r√°pidas en respuesta a eventos. La elecci√≥n entre uno u otro depender√° de los requisitos espec√≠ficos de tu proyecto, el volumen de datos y la frecuencia de las operaciones. Si tu objetivo es transformar y organizar datos en procesos ETL, AWS Glue es la opci√≥n indicada. Por otro lado, si buscas una ejecuci√≥n inmediata basada en eventos, AWS Lambda ser√° tu mejor elecci√≥n.</p>","contentLength":5629,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"AI Learning for Everyone! üöÄ","url":"https://dev.to/hrudu/ai-learning-for-everyone-2mgc","date":1739711504,"author":"Hrudu Shibu","guid":616,"unread":true,"content":"<p>Learn Generative AI with Microsoft Copilot ‚Äì Free AI Course\nAI is revolutionizing the world, and now you can learn generative AI for free with Microsoft Copilot through the Explore AI Learn Plan! üöÄ</p><p>What Will You Learn?\nIn this short 53-minute learning path, you will:<p>\n‚úÖ Understand the basics of generative AI.</p>\n‚úÖ Use Microsoft Copilot to research and create AI-generated content.<p>\n‚úÖ Design your own dream destination using AI-powered tools.</p></p><p>Who Should Join?\nüí° Students who want to explore AI applications.<p>\nüí° Tech enthusiasts looking to boost their AI skills.</p>\nüí° Educators who want to introduce AI to their students.</p><p>No prior experience required‚Äîjust a passion for learning! üåü</p>","contentLength":694,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"RandomInvert in PyTorch","url":"https://dev.to/hyperkai/randominvert-in-pytorch-5eb0","date":1739711271,"author":"Super Kai (Kazuya Ito)","guid":615,"unread":true,"content":"<ul><li>The 1st argument for initialization is (Optional-Default:-Type: or ):\n*Memos:\n\n<ul><li>It's the probability of whether an image is inverted or not.</li></ul></li><li>The 1st argument is (Required-Type: or ()):\n*Memos:\n\n<ul><li>A tensor must be 2D or 3D.</li></ul></li></ul><div><pre><code></code></pre></div>","contentLength":218,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Getting Buy-In: Overcoming Larman's Law ‚Ä¢ Allen Holub ‚Ä¢ YOW! 2024","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwhF_xbVpIQ","date":1739710846,"author":"GOTO Conferences","guid":614,"unread":true,"content":"<article>This presentation was recorded at YOW!

Senior management is rarely interested in the mechanics of what you're doing. They're interested in the bottom line, how the new approaches change how the business is managed, and whether the inevitable disruption is worth it.\n\nIn this talk, you'll learn how to convince the ‚Äúsuits‚Äù (and your clients) that innovation is a good thing.

My journey began with a decision that many would call impulsive but turned out to be life-changing. I traveled over 500 kilometers just to attend a Microsoft Azure event. That one step of courage and curiosity marked the beginning of an extraordinary adventure.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  üöÄ The First Leap of Faith\n</h2><p>I still remember the excitement mixed with nervousness as I entered the event venue. I knew no one there, but the warmth of the Azure Developer Community made me feel at home. I met developers, architects, and enthusiasts who were more than happy to share their knowledge. It was this openness that fueled my passion for cloud technologies.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  üå± Community: The Catalyst for Growth\n</h2><p>The Azure Developer Community officially began in late 2020 and quickly became my launchpad for growth. It didn't just teach me technical skills; it taught me the essence of collaboration and continuous learning. I actively sought mentorship, participated in discussions, and never hesitated to ask questions. Over time, my efforts bore fruit. I was invited to speak at small meetups, and soon, these meetups turned into large-scale events and conferences.</p><p>Fast forward to today: I've spoken, hosted, or organized more than 300 events across the globe. These events range from intimate bootcamps to large-scale conferences with thousands of attendees. I even had the privilege of winning the AI ODC Challenge in both 2024 and 2025, which opened doors to new opportunities and collaborations.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  ü§ù Meeting the Visionary: Satya Nadella\n</h2><p>One of the most surreal moments of my journey was meeting Satya Nadella, the CEO of Microsoft, not once but twice. The moment I shook hands with him, I felt the weight of years of learning and hard work crystallizing into a single, unforgettable experience. Getting photographed with him was a dream come true, and the picture was later featured in Pune Chaak's keynote session during the Microsoft AI Tour 2024 ‚Äî a moment of recognition that made me realize the impact of my work and the power of community-driven growth.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  ‚ù§Ô∏è Giving Back to the Community\n</h2><p>The community that once nurtured me is now the one I contribute to passionately.

Docker, a renowned containerization platform, has revolutionized the way we build, deploy, and manage applications. To optimize your Docker development workflow, this comprehensive guide delves into advanced techniques, best practices, and performance optimization strategies that experienced developers may not be aware of.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Latest Advanced Techniques\n</h2><h3>\n  \n  \n  1. Podman: Unleashing Container Management Potential\n</h3><p>Traditional Docker commands can be replaced with the lightweight and sandboxed  utility. This alternative offers enhanced security, reduced resource consumption, and simplified container management:</p><div><pre><code># Create a container using podman\npodman create --name my-container my-image\n</code></pre></div><h3>\n  \n  \n  2. BuildKit: Accelerating Image Building\n</h3><p>BuildKit accelerates image building by leveraging incremental builds, caching, and parallel execution. By integrating BuildKit into your Dockerfile, you can significantly reduce build times:</p><div><pre><code># Dockerfile using BuildKit\nFROM my-base-image as build-stage\nRUN apk add ... # Use BuildKit syntax\n</code></pre></div><h3>\n  \n  \n  3. Swarm Mode: Distributed Container Orchestration\n</h3><p>Swarm mode enables seamless scaling of containerized applications across multiple hosts. It provides advanced load balancing, service discovery, and automated container placement:</p><div><pre><code># Initialize a Swarm cluster\ndocker swarm init\n</code></pre></div><h3>\n  \n  \n  1. Multi-Stage Builds for Optimized Images\n</h3><p>Multi-stage builds allow you to create smaller and more efficient images by separating build steps into distinct stages. This minimizes the transfer of unnecessary dependencies:</p><div><pre><code># Multi-stage Dockerfile\nFROM node:lts AS build\nWORKDIR /usr/src/app\nCOPY . .\nRUN npm install --production\n\nFROM nginx:latest\nCOPY --from=build /usr/src/app /usr/share/nginx/html\n</code></pre></div><h3>\n  \n  \n  2. Performance Monitoring with Prometheus and Grafana\n</h3><p>Prometheus and Grafana provide comprehensive monitoring and visualization for Docker environments. They enable real-time tracking of container metrics, performance bottlenecks, and resource usage:</p><div><pre><code># Docker Compose configuration for monitoring\nversion: '3'\nservices:\nprometheus:\nimage: prom/prometheus\nvolumes:\n- ./prometheus.yml:/etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml\ngrafana:\nimage: grafana/grafana\n</code></pre></div><h2>\n  \n  \n  Modern Development Workflow\n</h2><h3>\n  \n  \n  1. CI/CD Automation with GitHub Actions\n</h3><p>GitHub Actions integrates seamlessly with Docker to automate build, test, and deployment processes. This facilitates continuous integration and delivery practices:</p><div><pre><code># GitHub Actions workflow\nname: Docker Build and Deploy\non: [push]\njobs:\nbuild:\nruns-on: ubuntu-latest\nsteps:\n- uses: actions/checkout@v3\n- uses: docker/build-push-action@v3\nwith:\npush: true\n</code></pre></div><h3>\n  \n  \n  2. Remote Container Debugging for Enhanced Efficiency\n</h3><p>Remote debugging allows you to troubleshoot running containers from your local IDE.

Microinteractions are those subtle, engaging animations or design elements that guide users, provide feedback, and add personality to your digital product. Think of the gentle bounce of a button after it's clicked or the satisfying swipe animation when archiving an email. These can be minor moments, but they can change a good user experience into an unforgettable one.</p><p>Why Microinteractions Matter</p><p>Microinteractions are not just about aesthetics; they serve very real functional purposes. Here's why they're so important:</p><p>Provide Feedback: They tell users what happened with their action, whether it was a button click or a process that is complete.</p><p>Guide the User: Subtle animations can draw attention to important elements or actions. For example, a blinking cursor in a search bar encourages users to start typing.</p><p>Enhance Engagement: When designed well, microinteractions are pleasurable moments that make users want to come back for more.</p><p>Strengthen Branding: Custom animations unique to your brand can create a memorable identity that stands out.</p><p>Key Elements of Microinteractions</p><p>Every microinteraction is composed of four major parts:</p><p>Trigger: What starts the microinteraction? It can be an explicit user action-like clicking or swiping-or an implicit system event, such as a timer or condition being met.</p><p>Rules: These determine how the microinteraction works. For example, what happens when a button is clicked?</p><p>Feedback: The visual, auditory, or tactile response users get, such as a click sound or a color change.</p><p>Loops and Modes: These are the conditions that determine if the microinteraction repeats or evolves over time.</p><p>Practical Tips for Designing Effective Microinteractions</p><p>Here‚Äôs how to implement microinteractions that enhance user experience:</p><ol><li><p>Keep It Simple\nMicrointeractions should be subtle and straightforward. Overloading users with flashy animations can make your design look cluttered and confuse users. Stick to minimal, functional designs.</p></li><li><p>Prioritize Functionality\nEvery animation should have a purpose. Never add microinteractions just because they look good. For instance, a loading spinner tells the user that something is happening, while an animation of a toggle switch explains how it works.</p></li><li><p>Be Consistent\nConsistency in microinteractions is important to create a cohesive user experience. Align animations with your brand identity and ensure they behave predictably across different platforms and devices.</p></li><li><p>Design for Context\nConsider the user's intention and the context of the interaction. For example, an animated behavior may be perfectly fine for a gaming application, but it may look like it doesn't belong if it's part of financial software.</p></li><li><p>Employ the Right Tools\nFigma, Adobe After Effects, or Lottie are some tools that make designing and prototyping microinteractions a breeze. Experiment with these to bring your designs to life.</p></li></ol><p>Real-World Examples of Microinteractions</p><p>Facebook Reactions: Hover on the \"Like\" button and a row of emojis pops out, making it fun and interactive for users to express themselves.</p><p>LinkedIn Endorsements: The animation of skill endorsement is so subtle, yet interactive, sans overwhelming the user.</p><p>Heart Animation by Instagram: Users can get instant feedback when they double-tap a post, which results in an animated heart popping up. </p><p>Common Mistakes to Avoid  While\n micro-interactions are powerful, this is how they can become counter-productive if not implemented well:</p><p>Overcomplicating the Animations: Too-long or flashy animations irritate the users.</p><p>Disregarding Accessibility: Make sure microinteractions are accessible for all users, whether they have visual or motor impairments.</p><p>Overloading the Interface: Too many animations can make performance worse and confuse users.</p><p>The Future of Microinteractions</p><p>As technology evolves, microinteractions will also get more intelligent. With AI and machine learning, in the future, designs may automatically adapt microinteractions based on user behavior, thus creating even more personalized experiences.</p><p>While micro in nature, microinteractions make great impacts on user experiences. By paying attention to minute details, you will also be able to create not just functional but delightful interfaces. So, go live with microinteractions in all your projects and watch your UX soar high.</p><p>What's your favorite microinteraction in the apps or websites that you use?

The AI landscape is constantly evolving, with new models pushing the boundaries of what's possible. But one name has been making waves recently, i.e, . Unlike other AI tools, this powerhouse has rewritten the rulebook on efficiency, cost-effectiveness, and performance. If you haven't heard of it yet, here‚Äôs why it‚Äôs capturing global attention.</p><h3><strong>What Is DeepSeek and Why Is It Gaining Popularity?</strong></h3><p>In January 2025, DeepSeek, a Chinese AI company, emerged as a major player in the AI space. Developed by a Chinese AI lab, it rapidly climbed the app store rankings, even surpassing ChatGPT as the most popular free AI assistant in the US.\nBut what‚Äôs driving the hype? DeepSeek-R1 isn‚Äôt just another AI model‚Äîit‚Äôs an example of cutting-edge efficiency at a fraction of the usual cost. Unlike its competitors, which require massive investments,  was trained for just ‚Äîa game-changing breakthrough in AI development.</p><h3><strong>Innovation Behind DeepSeek</strong></h3><p>DeepSeek‚Äôs strength lies in its  training method, which splits its AI into specialized sub-models. Instead of a single large neural network handling everything, each part of DeepSeek is optimized for specific tasks, making it both  and more .\nAnother key advantage is its , which adjusts processing power based on task complexity. This means DeepSeek can deliver high performance while using significantly fewer resources compared to other models.</p><p>Moreover, instead of relying on Nvidia‚Äôs high-end H100 chips, DeepSeek utilizes the more affordable , making AI training and deployment  cheaper than models like </p><h3><strong>DeepSeek-R1 helping open-source community</strong></h3><p>DeepSeek released its flagship model, DeepSeek-R1, under the . This model, developed with remarkable resource efficiency‚Äîusing approximately 2,000 Nvidia H800 GPUs over 55 days demonstrated performance on par with leading AI models from established tech giants. DeepSeek has made significant strides in the artificial intelligence landscape by open-sourcing its advanced AI models. \nThe open-source release of DeepSeek-R1 has lowered barriers to AI development, fostering innovation and competition across the global AI community. The company has also released models like , designed to enhance code intelligence, and , aimed at advancing vision-language understanding. These models are available for public use and modification, promoting transparency and collaboration in AI research and application.</p><h3><strong>How DeepSeek Outperforms Other AI Models</strong></h3><p>Beyond its efficiency, DeepSeek is redefining AI reliability with its R1 Reasoning Model. Unlike traditional models, the probability of the R1 Reasoning Model giving appealing outputs is much higher as compared to other available models since this model is designed to validate its own reasoning supporting its output, improving accuracy in subjects like math, science, and fact-checking.\nThis makes DeepSeek particularly powerful for research, problem-solving, and advanced computations, offering a level of precision that many AI models like  from OpenAI,  from MetaAI, and  from Google, etc struggle to achieve.</p><h3><strong>Challenges and Limitations</strong></h3><p>Despite its impressive capabilities, DeepSeek isn‚Äôt without challenges. Its business model remains uncertain, as it offers services at a significantly lower cost than competitors, raising questions about long-term sustainability. If integrated into government or corporate infrastructure, DeepSeek AI could be exploited for surveillance by foreign adversaries, affecting nation's cybersecurity. Although being open-source, certain components of the model (e.g., training datasets and fine-tuned versions) might be controlled by external entities, leading to potential data leaks.\nAdditionally, being developed in China, DeepSeek follows strict content regulations. Topics such as <strong>Taiwan‚Äôs political status</strong> or the <strong>Tiananmen Square incident</strong> are restricted due to Chinese internet policies, which may affect its global adaptability.</p><h3><strong>What‚Äôs Next for DeepSeek and AI?</strong></h3><p>DeepSeek‚Äôs rise proves that bigger isn‚Äôt always better. With its cost-effective approach, rapid deployment, and self-reasoning abilities, it‚Äôs challenging industry giants and setting a new standard for AI development.\nWhether you‚Äôre a developer, researcher, or AI enthusiast, DeepSeek is worth watching.

By the end of this part, users will be able to initiate and join video calls, similar to the \"Huddle\" feature in Slack.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Creating a Call Using the Huddle Button\n</h2><p>First, we need a way for users to start and stop video calls easily. Let's create a button for this purpose, which we'll call the .</p><p>Go to the  directory, and create a  file with the following code:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>In the component above, we update the current state of the call, including creating a new call, updating the call details, joining the call, or leaving the call using the following functions:</p><ul><li><p>: This function creates a new call by setting the required data, including channel details and workspace members. If there's an existing call, it first leaves that call.</p></li><li><p>: This function toggles the state between joining and leaving the call, depending on whether the user is already in an active call.</p></li></ul><p>We also use the  and  hooks to keep track of the current call state. The button updates its appearance and behavior based on whether a call is ongoing, available, or inactive.</p><p>Next, let's integrate the  into the channel page.</p><p>Navigate to <code>/client/[workspaceId]/[channelId]/page.tsx</code> and update it as follows:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Here, we integrate the  component with the channel toolbar. We also wrap it with the  component to manage the call state.</p><h2><strong>Implementing a Custom Hook for Huddles</strong></h2><p>With the huddle button in place, let's move on to creating a custom hook for our huddle feature. This hook will help manage different aspects of a call, such as toggling the microphone, camera, and screen sharing. It will also track the current state of the call, like whether the user is joining, speaking, or sharing their screen.</p><p>Create a new file in the  directory called  and add the following code:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><ul><li><p>: The  hook uses several hooks from <code>@stream-io/video-react-sdk</code> to manage different aspects of a call. It tracks the current call state, such as the , whether the user is muted, if screen sharing is active, and if the user has permission to perform specific actions.</p></li><li><p><strong>Toggling Microphone, Camera, and Screen Share</strong>: The , , and  functions allow users to control their microphone, camera, and screen sharing during calls.</p></li><li><p>: The  variable helps determine whether the spotlight layout should be used. This typically happens if one participant shares their screen or is pinned.</p></li><li><p>: The  function allows the user to leave the call. If the user has the required permission, they can also end the call for all participants.</p></li></ul><h2><strong>Building and Showing a Call</strong></h2><p>So far, users can create and join calls, but now we want to add the UI for the calls themselves. In this section, we'll integrate the huddle UI components, allowing users to manage video calls within a workspace, similar to Slack's huddle feature.</p><h3><strong>Creating the Call Control Button</strong></h3><p>The first component we need is a call control button. This button will toggle features during a call, like muting the microphone, turning the camera on or off, and more.</p><p>Create a new  file in the  directory, and add the following code:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>The  component adjusts its styles based on whether it is  or not. The button changes its background color and hover behavior to indicate the active state, helping users visually understand the button's current state.</p><h3><strong>Customizing the Participant View</strong></h3><p>The main component we‚Äôll use in our video layouts is Stream‚Äôs <a href=\"https://getstream.io/video/docs/react/ui-components/core/participant-view/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"></a> component. This component displays the participant‚Äôs video, plays their audio, shows their information, and provides action buttons for controls like pinning or muting.</p><p>However, the  default UI doesn't match our design, so we'll override it by creating our own custom UI using the  prop.</p><p>Create a new file in the  directory called  and add the following code:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>The  is divided into several components:</p><ul><li><p>: The  component shows details for each participant, such as their name and audio status, making it easy to identify who is currently speaking or pinned.</p></li><li><p><strong>Speech Indicator and Speech Ring</strong>: The  component gives a clear visual cue to users when a participant is speaking. We also included a speech ring effect highlighting the participant's video when speaking.</p></li><li><p>: The <code>DefaultScreenShareOverlay</code> is used when a participant is sharing their screen, providing a visual indication to other participants.</p></li><li><p>: The menu allows participants to perform actions such as pinning or muting themselves or another participant.</p></li></ul><p>With the main call controls and participant view in place, it's time to create the huddle interface. This UI will contain the video feed layout and call controls and ensure the interface responds dynamically to different situations, like toggling between the sidebar and modal views.</p><p>Create a new file in the  directory called  and add the following code:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>In the code snippet above:</p><ul><li><p>: We use the  and  to arrange participants based on the context (e.g., sidebar vs. full screen).</p></li><li><p>: We use the  component to toggle the microphone, camera, and screen sharing.</p></li><li><p>: We use the  and  props to handle when the huddle is open in another window or embedded in the sidebar.</p></li></ul><p>Now that we've developed the core user interface for our video calls, it's time to integrate the functionality into a single cohesive component. The huddle component will be responsible for managing the different states of a video call, such as when a user is joining, leaving, or responding to an invitation.</p><p>Create a new file in the  directory called  and add the following code:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><ul><li><p>: The  from the  hook is used to determine the appropriate UI to display. For example, if the call is ringing and wasn't initiated by the current user (), an invitation message, and options to join or decline the call are shown.</p></li><li><p><strong>Joining and Declining a Call</strong>: The  and  functions handle the respective actions. The  function invokes the  method, while the  function invokes  with the option to reject.</p></li><li><p>: Depending on the call state, the component renders different UI sections, including:</p><ul><li>The invitation view, when the call is  but not initiated by the user.</li><li>The call UI when the user has  or is .</li></ul></li></ul><p>The huddle modal component will give an expanded view of the video call interface. It provides a more immersive experience for users when compared to the sidebar view.</p><p>Create a new file in the  directory called  and add the following code:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>The component accepts an  prop to control when to display the modal. The modal also uses fixed positioning and includes styles that provide a centered, full-screen overlay.</p><p>With the  and  now created, we can add them to our app.</p><p>Normally, we could place our  component in the . However, the  is a child component in our  file, and layout files persist across routes and maintain the same state.</p><p>This feature would be unsuitable for our needs as we want the current call state to be able to reset and effects to re-run each time a user navigates between channels.</p><p>So instead, we'll use a template file. <a href=\"https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/layouts-and-templates#templates\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Templates</a> in Next.js are similar to layouts in that they wrap a child layout or page. However, unlike layouts, they create a new instance of their children each time the user navigates.</p><p>This behavior makes templates perfect for our huddle feature, as it allows us to reset the state and re-synchronize effects seamlessly when the channel or call data changes.</p><p>In the  directory, create a new  file with the following code:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><ul><li><p>: This hook allows us to get the active call. We use it along with the  from our app context to determine which call to display.</p></li><li><p>: We use the  hook to decide the currently active call, giving priority to matching calls from both the current call and channel call.</p></li><li><p>: The  function from  is used to render the Huddle and HuddleModal components to specific parts of the DOM‚Äîthe sidebar and body. This allows us to dynamically position the components and ensure they integrate smoothly with the UI layout.</p></li><li><p>: The  wrapper is used to pass the active call to our Huddle components, allowing them to manage the video and audio streams effectively.</p></li></ul><p>Before wrapping things up, let's add some important styles to our  file to ensure our huddle interface looks just right:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>With this, our huddles are fully functional, allowing users to collaborate seamlessly during video calls!</p><p>We've covered a lot in this three-part series, from setting up the foundation of our Slack clone with a database, authentication, and initial pages, to adding real-time messaging and video calling.</p>","contentLength":8520,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Hacking Go-TFE and Fetching All Workspaces in Terraform Enterprise: A Journey Through Pagination","url":"https://dev.to/muhammetberdi_jepbarov/hacking-go-tfe-and-fetching-all-workspaces-in-terraform-enterprise-a-journey-through-pagination-4lel","date":1739707176,"author":"Muhammetberdi Jepbarov","guid":596,"unread":true,"content":"<p>Terraform Enterprise (TFE) is a powerful platform for organizations using Terraform at scale. It provides collaboration, governance, and self-service workflows for infrastructure automation. As organizations grow, managing infrastructure becomes increasingly complex, often requiring the ability to programmatically interact with TFE using its robust API.</p><p>Recently, I found myself in a situation where I needed to fetch  for a given organization in TFE. Workspaces, as you may know, are the fundamental units in Terraform where runs occur. Each workspace holds the Terraform state file, which tracks infrastructure resources. For automation and reporting, I needed to pull in the full list of workspaces, but I quickly ran into a seemingly simple yet frustrating problem: .</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  The Goal: Get All Workspaces\n</h3><p>Our goal was clear ‚Äî we wanted to retrieve every single workspace associated with a particular organization, without worrying about pagination limits. Whether for generating reports, validating configurations, or orchestrating CI/CD workflows, having a full view of all workspaces was crucial.</p><p>The  library by HashiCorp provides an elegant way to interact with TFE‚Äôs API. The most straightforward way to list workspaces looks something like this:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>However, there was a catch.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  The Pain Point: Pagination Woes\n</h3><p>When we ran this code, we noticed something odd ‚Äî it only returned . After digging into the documentation and the source code of the  library, it became clear that the API defaults to a . Even when we explicitly set the page size to the maximum limit of 100, it still only gave us one page of results:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>The issue was evident: . This means that if your organization has more than 100 workspaces (which is not uncommon for larger teams), you have to make multiple requests to get all of them.</p><p>But we didn‚Äôt want to be bound by pagination. We wanted all the workspaces in one go ‚Äî a clean, consolidated list.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  The Solution: Handling Pagination Manually\n</h3><p>To work around the pagination limit, the only solution was to  through the results until all workspaces were fetched. We crafted the following solution:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><h3>\n  \n  \n  Breaking Down the Solution\n</h3><p>Let‚Äôs walk through the logic step by step:</p><ol><li>: We start with an empty slice to hold all workspaces and set the page number to 1.</li><li>: Inside the  loop, we make requests using the , setting both the page number and the maximum page size.</li><li>: After each request, we append the returned workspaces to our  slice.</li><li>: If the number of workspaces in the current response is less than the page size (meaning we‚Äôve reached the last page), we break out of the loop.</li><li>: Finally, we return the full list of workspaces.</li></ol><p>Fetching all workspaces might seem like a trivial task at first glance, but it highlights a crucial aspect of working with APIs ‚Äî understanding and handling pagination correctly.</p><p>When dealing with APIs that support pagination:</p><ul><li>Always check default page sizes.</li><li>Understand the max page size allowed.</li><li>Implement proper loop termination to avoid infinite loops.</li><li>Consider API rate limits when making multiple requests.</li></ul><p>In our case, the solution was not only about fetching data but about ensuring the stability and reliability of our automation pipelines.</p><p>In the end, handling pagination in TFE‚Äôs API required us to step back, understand the underlying mechanics, and build a robust way to gather all the data we needed. The final solution is now part of our infrastructure tooling, allowing us to work seamlessly with Terraform Enterprise‚Äôs workspaces.</p><p>So next time you hit a wall with an API and pagination, remember ‚Äî it‚Äôs not a bug; it‚Äôs a feature.

We'll add features like rich text, file sharing, images, and emoji reactions.</p><p>By the end of this part, users will be able to communicate with each other, making our app a functional chat platform.</p><h2><strong>Adding More Channels To Your Workspace</strong></h2><p>Currently, users can only have one channel in a workspace, which is the channel added during the workspace creation process. Before adding the messaging feature to our app, let's enable users to create additional channels within a workspace.</p><p>To add more channels, we'll create a pop-up modal that appears when users click an '' button in the sidebar.</p><h3><strong>Creating the Channel API Route</strong></h3><p>First, we need an API route to handle channel creation. Create a  directory inside the existing <code>/api/workspaces/[workspaceId]</code> directory, then add a  file with the following code:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><ul><li><p><strong>Authentication and Validation</strong>: We check if the user is authenticated and if they belong to the workspace.</p></li><li><p>: Only users with an '' role can create new channels.</p></li><li><p>: We ensure that no other channel in the workspace has the same name.</p></li><li><p>: If all checks pass, the channel is created and saved in the database.</p></li></ul><h3><strong>Creating the Add Channel Modal</strong></h3><p>Next, let's create a modal for adding new channels.

This button is placed below the channel list for easy access.</p><p>With this setup, users can now create new channels to help organize conversations within the workspace.</p><h2><strong>Building the Chat Interface</strong></h2><p>Now that users can create multiple channels, let's start working on our main chat interface. First, we'll be building the loading state for our chat UI, then the main chat interface, and finally, we'll customize different aspects of the chat, like the message input, date separator, and more.</p><h3><strong>Creating a Channel Loading Indicator</strong></h3><p>To let users know the channel chat is loading, we will create a loading indicator that provides a visual cue while fetching data. Stream already provides a default loading UI, but we want a custom one to match our application's design.</p><p>Navigate to the  directory and create a new file called  with the following code:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>The component shows a skeleton screen, which gives users a visual hint that content is loading.</p><p>Next, let's build the main chat interface so users can send messages and see their conversation history.</p><p>Go to the  folder, create a new file named , and add the following code:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>The  component accepts the  data as a prop and uses the <a href=\"https://getstream.io/chat/docs/sdk/react/components/core-components/channel/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"></a> component from  to manage chat sessions. Here are its key components:</p><ul><li><p>: This displays the conversation history within the current channel.</p></li><li><p>: This component allows users to type and send messages. The  is rendered using React Portals, which helps position the input field in a different part of the DOM to match the layout we want for our Slack clone.</p></li><li><p>: The  component also accepts our custom  component as a prop to override the default loading UI.</p></li></ul><h3><strong>Integrating the Channel Chat Component</strong></h3><p>Next, we need to integrate the  component into our channel page. Go to the <code>/client/[workspaceId]/[channelId]/page.tsx</code> file and update it as follows:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><ul><li><p>We check if the channel is still loading using the  state. If it is, we display the  component.</p></li><li><p>Once the channel data is loaded, we display the  component, which provides the main chat interface for users to interact with.</p></li></ul><p>Finally, let‚Äôs add some styling to customize the look of our chat UI. Navigate to the  directory and update the  file with the following code:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>And with that, users can now send messages. However, the current UI still looks far from what we want, so in the following sections, we'll add custom components to enhance it.</p><h2><strong>Adding a Custom Date Separator</strong></h2><p>To help users follow conversations more easily, we'll add custom date separators that indicate when messages are from different days.</p><p>Go to the  folder, create a new file called , and add the following code:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>This component shows a separator to help users see when messages are from different days. Using the  function, we provide labels like \"\", \"\", or a formatted date with an ordinal suffix.</p><p>Next, let‚Äôs add the  to the  component to make conversations more readable:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><h2><strong>Creating a Custom Emoji Picker</strong></h2><p>In this section, we'll create a custom emoji picker for our Slack clone using the  library. While Stream already provides an <a href=\"https://getstream.io/chat/docs/sdk/react/guides/customization/emoji_picker/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"></a> using the same library, we want to build a more flexible version that better suits our chat components and integrates seamlessly into our clone.</p><p>Firstly, we need to install the necessary packages for the emoji picker. These include:</p><ul><li><p>: This library provides the emoji picker component.</p></li><li><p>: This package is specifically for using the emoji picker in React apps.</p></li><li><p>: This contains all the data needed for the emojis.</p></li></ul><p>Run the following command in your terminal to install the packages:</p><div><pre><code>npm emoji-mart @emoji-mart/react @emoji-mart/data\n</code></pre></div><p>Next, go to your  folder, create a new file called , and add the following code:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><ul><li><p>: We use  to display the emoji picker and  to get all the emoji data. We also use  from  to handle the positioning of our emoji picker.</p></li><li><p>: The component accepts several props, such as  for the button that triggers the picker,  to handle emoji selection, and optional styling classes for customization.</p></li><li><p>: The  hook positions the emoji picker correctly relative to the button.</p></li><li><p>: We use the  state to show or hide the picker. We also handle clicks outside the picker to close it.</p></li></ul><h2><strong>Implementing a Custom Message Input</strong></h2><p>In this section, we'll implement a custom message input for our Slack clone. This new input will allow users to easily add rich formatting, such as bold or italics, and even upload files and add emojis, creating a more dynamic chatting experience.</p><p>To achieve this, we'll use <a href=\"https://docs.slatejs.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"></a>, which is a robust framework for building rich text editors. We'll also use <a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/is-hotkey\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"></a> to define keyboard shortcuts for formatting text.</p><p>First, let's install the necessary libraries. Open your terminal and run the following commands:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Next, we'll create our custom input component, which will act as the primary input container for our chat.</p><p>Navigate to the  directory, create a new file named , and add the following code:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>There‚Äôs a lot going on here, so let‚Äôs break it down:</p><ul><li><p>: We use Slate to create a rich text editor that supports multiple formatting options, like bold, italics, underline, and strikethrough.</p></li><li><p>: The  and  functions convert the editor's content to markdown format, allowing us to maintain rich formatting in text.</p></li><li><p>: Functions like , , and  help manage file uploads, previews, and removal, making the chat input more versatile.</p></li><li><p>: The buttons for formatting text (bold, italic, etc.) call the  function to add or remove specific text styles.</p></li><li><p>: The  library binds hotkeys like  for bold,  for italics, and so on, making the editor more user-friendly.</p></li><li><p>: The  function is responsible for sending the message by serializing the editor's content and then using Stream's  function.</p></li></ul><p>Next, let's integrate the  with our channel chat interface.</p><p>Open the  file and update it with the following code:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>In the code above, we import the  component and pass it as the  prop for the  component to override the default UI.</p><p>Next, let‚Äôs add some styling to support the rich text formatting features, ensuring elements like  blocks and other inline styles look polished.</p><p>Open your  file, and include the following styles:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>While the chat interface is now visually improved with a customized message input, the message UI still needs work to match the look of the rest of the app.</p><h2><strong>Creating a Custom Message UI</strong></h2><p>In this section, we'll create a custom message UI to match the look and feel of our Slack clone. This custom message component will display user messages in a clean interface with the ability to send reactions and view attachments.</p><p>To get started, navigate to the  directory, create a new file named , and add the following code:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>In the  component:</p><ul><li><p> We use the  hook to get information about the current message displayed, such as the message content and its author.</p></li><li><p> Using , we calculate the number of reactions and whether the user has reacted to the message or not. Users can add or remove reactions by clicking on the reaction buttons.</p></li><li><p> The message can contain attachments such as images or files. We provide download and preview options for attachments.</p></li><li><p> We added a button to send reactions using our custom .</p></li></ul><p>Now, let's integrate our new  component into our . Navigate to <code>components/ChannelChat.tsx</code> and update it to use :</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>In , we update the  to use our custom  component. This change allows our newly defined custom message UI to display each message.</p><p>And that‚Äôs it! We now have a fully customized chat experience similar to Slack.</p><p>In this part, we made our Slack clone more interactive by implementing core messaging features using <a href=\"https://getstream.io/chat/sdk/react/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Stream React Chat SDK</a>. We added custom components to further style and enhance the user interface with features like rich text formatting, emojis, and file sharing.</p><p>In this series's next and final part, we will integrate a video calling feature using <a href=\"https://getstream.io/video/sdk/react/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Stream React Video and Audio SDK</a>. This feature will allow users to transition between text and video conversations, making the app more versatile and interactive.</p>","contentLength":10020,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"üêûDebugging Life: The Software Engineering Lessons You Can‚Äôt Ignore","url":"https://dev.to/hassanshahzadaheer/debugging-life-the-software-engineering-lessons-you-cant-ignore-4n79","date":1739707082,"author":"Hassan Shahzad Aheer","guid":594,"unread":true,"content":"<p>In software engineering, every line of code has a purpose.

You might think of Haskell, with its pure functions and monads (don't panic, we'll explain that in detail later), or JavaScript, which loves to showcase its features with higher - order functions and callbacks. But in fact, you can also do functional programming in Go, and the process is far from dull.</p><p>First of all, let's talk about higher - order functions. Higher - order functions can work well with other functions, either taking them as parameters or returning them as values. In the world of Go, implementing higher - order functions is not only possible but also quite ingenious.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>You see, in this example, the  function takes an integer slice and a judgment function , and returns the elements in the slice that meet the judgment conditions. Doesn't it seem a bit like a faster JavaScript?</p><p>Next up is currying. It is the process of breaking down a function that takes multiple arguments into a series of functions, each taking a single argument. Currying is actually not as complicated as it might seem.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>In this example, the  function takes an integer  and returns a new function. This new function takes another integer  and returns the result of . Simple, straightforward, and gets the job done without any frills.</p><p>One of the characteristics of functional programming is immutability. Once something is constructed, it doesn't change. Instead, if you need something different, you build a new one. This might sound wasteful at first, but in fact, it keeps the code clean and reduces side effects.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>In this example, instead of directly modifying the original , we created a new  and modified it.</p><p>Pure functions are like tidy friends. They don't touch or modify anything outside their scope. What you pass in is what you use, and what they return is their only effect.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>In this example, the  function only depends on the passed - in parameter  and doesn't affect any external variables.</p><p>In the simplest terms, functors are anything that can map a function. Think of the humble array, applying a function to each item and getting a new array. In Go, there is no built - in general  function, but we can build one ourselves.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Here, we defined a  function that takes an integer slice and a function and returns a new slice, where each element is the result of processing the original slice element by the function.</p><p>Now, let's talk about endofunctors. It's just a fancy way of saying a functor that maps a type to the same type. Simply put, starting from a Go slice, you end up with a Go slice of the same type. It's not rocket science, just a matter of type consistency.</p><p>Taking the previous  as an example, it's a kind of endofunctor in disguise. It takes  and returns  without type conversion.</p><p>Imagine a party where everyone has to bring a friend. Monoids are like that, but for types. They need two things: an operation that combines two types and a special value, which is like the most likable friend - it gets along with everyone but doesn't change anything about them.</p><p>In Go, you can see this with slices or numbers. Let's take numbers as an example because they're easier to work with:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Here, 0 is our hero, the identity element, which keeps the numbers unchanged.</p><p>\"When someone says, 'A monad is a monoid in the category of endofunctors,' they're basically showing off their computer - science vocabulary.\" To explain in detail: A monad is a programming construct that deals with types and functions in a super - special way - like some people are picky about how their coffee is brewed.</p><p>In the simplest terms, a monoid is about combining things together using a special rule, which includes a useless element or identity element. Now, add endofunctors, which are like ordinary old functions but stick to transforming things within their own little universe (category). Put it all together, and you'll see that a monad can be seen as a way to chain functions together in a sequence, but in a super - self - contained way while also respecting the original structure of the data. It's like saying, \"We're going on a road trip, but we can only take the scenic backroads, and we'll end up back where we started.\"</p><p>Monads are all - rounders. They can not only handle values with context (such as errors or lists) but also chain operations together by passing the context. In Go, it might be a bit difficult to mimic this, but let's take a look at error handling, which is a practical use of monads.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>This makeshift monad can help us handle computations that might go wrong without causing panics and chaos in the code.</p><p>Functional programming in Go might not be the poster child of the functional paradigm, but it's entirely feasible and can even be fun. Who would have thought, right? Now, you should understand that Go can achieve functional programming just like other languages. With a little effort, you can write clean, efficient, and robust code. </p><p>Finally, I'd like to recommend a platform that's perfect for deploying Golang code: </p><h3>\n  \n  \n  1.

Let‚Äôs go through this step-by-step and get you up to speed, Python style.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Why Should You Care About CDK v2?\n</h2><p>Alright, let‚Äôs address the big question: why even bother migrating to CDK v2? Well, here are three solid reasons:</p><p>Simplified Dependencies: No more pulling in tons of packages for different AWS services. CDK v2 bundles everything into a single package: aws-cdk-lib. How awesome is that?</p><p>Stay Updated: CDK v1 isn‚Äôt getting any love anymore. If you want to keep up with the latest AWS features and updates, v2 is where it‚Äôs at.</p><p>Better Developer Experience: AWS has introduced some stability guarantees and cleaned up APIs, making it easier for us to write and maintain our infrastructure code.</p><p><strong>1. Consolidated Package Structure</strong>\nRemember the days of importing a separate package for each AWS service? That‚Äôs history now. CDK v2 unifies everything into aws-cdk-lib.</p><div><pre><code>from aws_cdk import core\nfrom aws_cdk.aws_s3 import Bucket\n</code></pre></div><div><pre><code>from aws_cdk import Stack\nfrom aws_cdk.aws_s3 import Bucket\n</code></pre></div><p><strong>2. Goodbye to Deprecated APIs</strong></p><p>Some APIs and constructs from v1 didn‚Äôt make the cut in v2. For instance, core.Construct has been replaced by constructs.Construct. A little cleanup never hurts, right?</p><p>There are some great new features, like improved stability guarantees for low-level (L1) constructs and better testing capabilities with assertions.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Let‚Äôs Get Migrating: Step-by-Step Guide\n</h2><p>Ready to dive in? Follow these steps to upgrade your Python CDK project to v2.</p><p><strong>1. Update Your Dependencies</strong></p><p>Start by upgrading your project dependencies to use CDK v2. Open your requirements.txt or Pipfile and update them:</p><div><pre><code>aws-cdk-lib&gt;=2.0.0\nconstructs&gt;=10.0.0\n</code></pre></div><p>Then, install the new dependencies:</p><div><pre><code>pip install -r requirements.txt\n</code></pre></div><p>This is where the magic happens.

(Though it was already #1 in their rankings, it had showed a 9.3% increase in their ranking system, notes InfoWorld.) TIOBE CEO Paul Jansen says this reflects how easy Python is to learn, adding that \"The demand for new programmers is still very high\" (and that \"developing applications completely in AI is not possible yet.\") \n\nIn fact on February's version of the index, the top ten looks mostly static. The only languages dropping appear to be very old languages. Over the last 12 months C and PHP have both fallen on the index ‚Äî C from the #2 to the #4 spot, and PHP from #10 all the way to #14. (Also dropping is Visual Basic, which fell from #9 to #10.) \n\nBut TechRepublican cites another factor that seems to be affecting the rankings: language speed.\n\n\nFast programming languages are gaining popularity, TIOBE CEO Paul Jansen said in the TIOBE Programming Community Index in February. Fast programming languages he called out include C++ [#2], Go [#8], and Rust [#13 ‚Äî up from #18 a year ago]. \n\nAlso, according to the updated TIOBE rankings... \n- C++ held onto its place at second from the top of the leaderboard.\n- Mojo and Zig are following trajectories likely to bring them into the top 50, and reached #51 and #56 respectively in February. \n\n\"Now that the world needs to crunch more and more numbers per second, and hardware is not evolving fast enough, speed of programs is getting important. Having said this, it is not surprising that the fast programming languages are gaining ground in the TIOBE index,\" Jansen wrote. The need for speed helped Mojo [#51] and Zig [#56] rise... \n\nRust reached its all-time high in the proprietary points system (1.47%.), and Jansen expects Go to be a common sight in the top 10 going forward.\n","contentLength":1863,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"5 Websites to Help You Stand Out on Social Media","url":"https://dev.to/jsam/5-websites-to-help-you-stand-out-on-social-media-59i3","date":1739694445,"author":"jsam","guid":583,"unread":true,"content":"<p>In today's digital age, social media has become an integral part of our lives.

The term \"malware\" is derived from two words: \"mal,\" meaning malicious, and \"ware,\" meaning software, forming the word \"malware.\"</p><p>Typically, malware is created by illegal hackers, commonly known as black hat hackers. These programs are highly capable and can cause severe damage to both organizations and individuals. Once installed on a device, malware exploits it by accessing messages, call logs, browser history, and even bank balances or other sensitive information.</p><p>Once again, malware consists of illegal software used by black hat hackers and crackers. There are various types of malware, mainly viruses, spyware, trojans, ransomware, keyloggers, and worms. In this discussion, we will explore them in detail.</p><p>Here are some common types of malwares that can destroy your pc</p><p>\nViruses are malicious programs specifically designed to attach themselves to files or documents and execute when the infected file is opened. As a result, they can harm your system, slow down performance, and even steal sensitive information.</p><p>\nSpyware is a malicious piece of code created to collect information from a system and spy on it without the user's knowledge or consent. This includes passwords, social information, and even bank details. Spyware is commonly found in unauthorized third-party applications.</p><p>\nA Trojan is a malicious piece of code that appears to be legitimate software. However, once mistakenly installed by a user, it operates in the background and gains system access to perform malicious activities. Trojans are often embedded in third-party apps, games, documents, software patches, and even emails.</p><p>\nRansomware is one of the most powerful and dangerous types of malware. It encrypts a target‚Äôs data and demands a ransom payment in exchange for decryption. Once a system is infected, recovering the data without paying the ransom is nearly impossible (at least for now).</p><p>\nA keylogger is a malicious program specifically designed to capture a user's keystrokes in real-time. This means anything you type on your keyboard can be recorded, including personal details and sensitive social media credentials.</p><p>To protect yourself from malware, follow these preventive measures:</p><ol><li>Remember, nothing is 100% secure! Always stay cautious.\nChoose a robust antivirus program like Avast, Norton, AVG, or Kaspersky.</li><li>Regularly back up your data to avoid losing important files.</li><li>Avoid installing third-party software whenever possible.</li><li>Scan files before use with VirusTotal if you must use third-party software (not recommended).</li><li>Stay away from cracked software, as it is often infected with malware.</li><li>Never download unauthorized files from the internet, as they may contain hidden threats.</li><li>Use a secure and updated browser, such as Tor, Firefox, Edge, or Opera.</li><li>Keep your operating system updated to protect against vulnerabilities.</li><li>Stay informed and educate others about cyber threats to enhance digital security.</li></ol><p>In this discussion, we explored what malware is and how destructive it can be. This was just a glimpse‚Äîthere are many other types of malware that were not included here. However, these are some of the most common and stable malware threats.</p><p>Always try to use authentic software, files, and systems, and educate others about cyber threats.

Either you optimize, or you lose. Period.</p><p>I don‚Äôt care if you‚Äôre an experienced developer with 10 years of experience or 1 year of experience. If you want to make games that WORK, games people respect‚Äîyou need to understand . </p><p>Players demand smooth gameplay, high-quality visuals, and a flawless experience across every device. If your game stutters, crashes, or loads slower than a snail? You‚Äôre done. </p><p>Optimization isn‚Äôt magic. It‚Äôs the foundation of smooth gameplay, fast loading, and stable performance. Without it, your game will lag, crash, and be forgotten faster than you can say ‚Äúgame over.‚Äù  </p><p>But don‚Äôt worry. In this article, I will share four effective strategies to help you with that. </p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Effective Strategies for Performance Optimization\n</h2><p>ü§∏‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è What Is Optimization? Optimization means making your game run as fast and smooth as possible. SIMPLE.</p><p>When you optimize your game, you:  </p><ol><li><strong>üñ•Ô∏è Make the game work on weaker computers or phones.</strong></li><li><strong>üíâ Prevent lag and crashes.</strong></li></ol><h2><strong>Rule 1: Memory Management</strong></h2><p>When you‚Äôre developing a game, memory is your most valuable resource.</p><p>Every player movement, every enemy on the screen, every explosion needs a little piece of memory to function. Unfortunately, </p><p>If you don‚Äôt manage memory properly, your game can get slow, laggy, or even crash. That‚Äôs why memory management is a critical skill every game developer needs. Let‚Äôs break it down step by step, with detailed examples in Python.</p><h3><strong>Strategy #1: Memory Pooling</strong></h3><p>This strategy is simple: reuse Objects Instead of Creating New Ones** Memory pooling is like recycling for your game. Instead of creating new objects every time you need one, you reuse objects you‚Äôve already created.  </p><p>Creating and destroying objects repeatedly takes up time and memory. Let's say you are building a shooting game where the player fires 10 bullets per second. If you create a new bullet for each shot, your game could quickly slow down.  </p><p>Here‚Äôs how you can implement memory pooling for bullets in a shooting game:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><ol><li>The  Class: Defines what a bullet does and keeps track of whether it‚Äôs active (in use) or not.\n</li><li>The : A list of 10 reusable bullets.\n</li><li>The  Function: Finds an inactive bullet, reuses it, and sets its position.\n</li><li>Recycling Bullets: When you‚Äôre done with a bullet, you reset it so it can be reused.\n</li></ol><h3><strong>Strategy #2. Data Structure Optimization</strong></h3><p>The way you store your data can make or break your game‚Äôs performance. Choosing the wrong data structure is like trying to carry water in a leaky bucket‚Äîit‚Äôs inefficient and messy.  </p><p>Let‚Äôs say you‚Äôre making a game for four players, and you want to keep track of their scores. You could use a list, but a fixed-size array is more efficient because it uses less memory.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><ol><li> Creates a fixed-size array of integers ().\n</li><li> You can‚Äôt accidentally add or remove elements, which prevents bugs and saves memory.\n</li><li> Updating scores is quick and uses minimal resources.\n</li></ol><h3><strong>Strategy #3. Memory Profiling</strong></h3><p>Even if your code seems perfect, hidden memory problems can still exist. Memory profiling helps you monitor how much memory your game is using and find issues like memory leaks.  </p><p>Python has a built-in tool called  that tracks memory usage. Here‚Äôs how to use it:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><ol><li> begins monitoring memory usage.\n</li><li> Create a large list to use up memory.\n</li><li> Get the current and peak memory usage, converting it to megabytes for readability.\n</li><li> ends the tracking session.\n</li></ol><p>Now it‚Äôs your turn to practice these strategies and take your game development skills to the next level!</p><h2><strong>Rule 2: Asset Streaming (Load Only What You Need)</strong></h2><p>If you load the entire world at once, your game will choke and die. You don‚Äôt need that drama. Instead, <strong>stream assets as the player needs them</strong>. This is called asset streaming. </p><p>For instance, inside your game, you may have a huge open-world with forests, deserts, and cities. Why load all those levels at once when the player is only in the forest? Makes no sense, right? Load  and keep your game lean, fast, and smooth.</p><h3><strong>Strategy #1: Segment and Prioritize</strong></h3><p>Let‚Äôs break this down with an example. Your player is exploring different levels: Forest, Desert, and City. We‚Äôll only load a level when the player enters it.</p><p><em>Here‚Äôs how to make it work in Python:</em></p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><ol><li> Each level has a name (e.g., Forest) and a ‚Äúloaded‚Äù status. If it‚Äôs loaded, it doesn‚Äôt load again.\n</li><li> The  function finds the level the player wants to enter and loads it only if it hasn‚Äôt been loaded yet.\n</li><li> Levels not visited don‚Äôt waste memory. The game runs smoothly because it only focuses on what the player needs.</li></ol><p>This is efficiency at its finest. <strong>No wasted memory, no wasted time.</strong> Your player moves; your game adapts. That‚Äôs how you dominate.  </p><h3><strong>Strategy #2: Asynchronous Loading (No Waiting Allowed)</strong></h3><p>Nobody likes waiting. Freezing screens? Laggy loading? It‚Äôs amateur hour. You need ‚Äîthis loads assets in the background while your player keeps playing.  </p><p>Imagine downloading a huge map while still exploring the current one. Your game keeps moving, the player stays happy.</p><p>Here‚Äôs how to simulate asynchronous loading in Python:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><ol><li> The  module creates a new thread to load assets without freezing the main game.\n</li><li> The  function fakes the loading time to mimic how it works in a real game.\n</li><li> The player can continue playing while the new level or asset loads in the background.\n</li></ol><p>With asynchronous loading, <strong>your player stays in the zone</strong>, and your game feels seamless. Pro-level stuff.</p><h3><strong>Strategy 3: Level of Detail (LOD) Systems ‚Äì Be Smart About Quality</strong></h3><p>Not everything in your game needs to look like it‚Äôs been rendered by a Hollywood studio. If an object is far away, lower its quality. It‚Äôs called , and it‚Äôs how you keep your game‚Äôs performance sharp.  </p><p><strong>Example: Using LOD for a Tree</strong></p><p>Here‚Äôs a Python simulation of switching between high and low detail:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><ol><li> The  property determines how far the tree is from the player.\n</li><li> If the tree is close, render it in high detail. If it‚Äôs far, use low detail to save memory and processing power.\n</li><li> The player doesn‚Äôt notice the difference, but your game runs smoother and faster.\n</li></ol><p>This is how you keep the balance between beauty and performance. Your game looks stunning up close but doesn‚Äôt waste resources on faraway objects.</p><ol><li> Only load what you need, when you need it. No wasted memory.\n</li><li> Smooth gameplay keeps players engaged and avoids frustration.\n</li><li> These techniques are how AAA games stay fast and responsive.\n</li></ol><p> Go apply these strategies, keep your game lean, and make sure your players never even think about lag.</p><h2><strong>Rule 3: Frame Rate Stabilization</strong></h2><p>The frame rate is how many pictures (frames) your game shows per second. If it‚Äôs unstable, your game will stutter and feel broken.  </p><p>The secret? Keep the workload for each frame consistent.  </p><p>üö¶Here‚Äôs how you can control the timing in a game loop:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><ul><li>‚öñÔ∏è The game updates at a steady rate (60 times per second).\n</li><li>ü™Ç This make smooth gameplay, no matter how slow or fast the computer is.\n</li></ul><ul><li>Optimize Rendering Paths: Fewer draw calls. Smarter culling. Simplicity wins.</li><li>Dynamic Resolution Scaling: When the pressure‚Äôs on, scale down resolution to maintain the frame rate. Players won‚Äôt even notice.</li><li>Fixed Time Step: Keep your physics and logic consistent. Frame rate fluctuations shouldn‚Äôt mean chaos.</li></ul><h2><strong>Rule 4: GPU and CPU Optimization</strong></h2><p>Your computer has two main processors:  </p><ol><li> Handles logic, like moving a character or calculating scores.\n</li><li> Handles graphics, like drawing your game world.\n</li></ol><p>üëá Here's what you have to do for GPU/CPU optimization:</p><p>Profile Everything: Use tools to pinpoint bottlenecks and strike hard where it hurts.\nShader Optimization: Shaders are resource hogs. Simplify them, streamline them, and cut the fat.<p>\nMultithreading: Spread tasks across CPU cores. Don‚Äôt overload one and leave the others idle.</p></p><p>If one is working too hard while the other is idle, your game will lag.  </p><p><strong>Solution?

For instance, users will be able to ask for a file or song that they discussed with a friend over text. Siri would then automatically retrieve that item. Apple also has demonstrated the ability for Siri to quickly locate someone's driver's license number by reviewing their photos... Inside Apple, many employees testing the new Siri have found that these features don't yet work consistently... \nThe control enhancements ‚Äî an upgraded version of something called App Intents ‚Äî are central to the operation of the company's upcoming smart home hub. That product, an AI device for controlling smart home appliances and FaceTime, is slated for release later this year. \n\nAnd Amazon is also struggling with an AI upgrade for its digital assistant, reports the Washington Post:\nThe \"smarter and more conversational\" version of Alexa will not be available until March 31 or later, the employee said, at least a year and a half after it was initially announced in response to competition from OpenAI's ChatGPT. Internal messages seen by The Post confirmed the launch was originally scheduled for this month but was subsequently moved to the end of March... According to internal documents seen by The Post, new features of the subscriber-only, AI-powered Alexa could include the ability to adopt a personality, recall conversations, order takeout or call a taxi. Some of the new Alexa features are similar to Alexa abilities that were previously available free through partnerships with companies like Grubhub and Uber... \nThe AI-enhanced version of Alexa in development has been repeatedly delayed due to problems with incorrect answers, the employee working on the launch told The Post. As a popular product that is a decade old, the Alexa brand is valuable, and the company is hesitant to risk customer trust by launching a product that is not reliable, the person said.\n\n","contentLength":2551,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Automating Daily arXiv Paper Summaries with Slack Notifications","url":"https://dev.to/m_sea_bass/automating-daily-arxiv-paper-summaries-with-slack-notifications-1kp8","date":1739683607,"author":"M Sea Bass","guid":559,"unread":true,"content":"<p>This post is a follow-up to the <a href=\"https://dev.to/m_sea_bass/automating-daily-arxiv-paper-summaries-and-slack-notifications-843\">previous article</a>.

Many engineers fall into the day-to-day routine of writing code without a clear idea of how to grow their careers.</p><p>This happened to me. At my first job at Amazon, I landed code without knowing what I could do to grow my skills. I left that job within eight months because I felt I wasn‚Äôt growing as an engineer. Three years later, I made it to Staff Software Engineer at Instagram after tons of mentorship. Early on, I learned that being good at coding wasn‚Äôt enough to get promoted; you have to think strategically about your career and often need to develop new behaviors to move up.</p><p>In this article, I‚Äôll share everything that helped me fast-track my way up the ladder, from developing the right mindset to making key moves that many overlook. Even if rapid growth isn‚Äôt your goal, this guide has learnings for all tech career paths.</p><ul><li><p>Software Engineering Levels</p></li><li><p>An Algorithm for Promotion</p></li><li><p>Junior (IC3) ‚Üí Mid-level (IC4)</p></li><li><p>Mid-level (IC4) ‚Üí Senior (IC5)</p></li><li><p>Senior (IC5) ‚Üí Staff (IC6)</p></li></ul><h2>Software Engineering Levels</h2><p><em>Note: ‚ÄúIC‚Äù = ‚ÄúIndividual Contributor‚Äù</em></p><p>In software engineering, companies measure career progression by levels that measure both behaviors and impact within the company. While the exact titles and structure can vary between companies, most tech companies follow a similar system:</p><ul><li><p> - Early in your career, working on smaller, well-defined tasks with guidance from more experienced engineers.</p></li><li><p> - More autonomous, handling moderately complex projects, and beginning to take initiative in improving the codebase and what they build.</p></li><li><p> - Leading larger projects with team-level influence. You‚Äôll mentor and guide the team while having a broad impact on the codebase.</p></li><li><p>: Focusing on cross-team collaboration and solving org-wide challenges. Staff engineers are strategic thinkers who influence the technical direction of their organization.</p></li><li><p><strong>Senior Staff Engineer and Beyond (IC7+): </strong>Senior staff engineers and up operate with top technical expertise, driving large-scale initiatives that have a broad impact on the company. Senior staff engineers mentor staff engineers and work closely with executive leadership to meet business objectives.</p></li></ul><p>Your impact and compensation increase as you progress, which is a lot more satisfying in my experience. Not to mention that the skills that get you promoted also let you control what you and the company work on.</p><p>Also, many companies consider only senior engineers (IC5) and higher to be ‚Äúterminal levels.‚Äù You must eventually get promoted to IC5, or you‚Äôll be managed out. Most engineers are promoted in time, so it‚Äôs not meant to scare you but to encourage you to grow.</p><h2>An Algorithm For Promotion</h2><p>There‚Äôs a common set of steps across all promotions that will get you to Staff:</p><p><strong>1) Exceed expectations at your current level</strong> - Your manager will be hesitant to find you opportunities at the next level if they have concerns about your performance at the current level. Also, when your manager puts together a promotion packet, it‚Äôll contain a history of your past ratings. The promotion committee will have concerns about your packet if you have a history of only meeting expectations for your level. Work with your manager to understand the expectations for your level and how to exceed them.</p><p><strong>2) Be direct with your manager about promotion </strong>- Once you know you‚Äôre exceeding expectations for your level, ask your manager what next-level performance looks like. Your manager plays a huge role in your promotion. They build your case and advocate for it, so they have a lot of influence on this process. Also, the lower the level, the more control your manager has. IC3 -&gt; IC4 promotions are straightforward, so your manager‚Äôs perspective is usually what happens. For IC5 -&gt; IC6, there is a lot more ambiguity, so <a href=\"https://www.developing.dev/p/how-promotions-and-ratings-work\">your manager serves more as a middleman between you and the promotion committee</a>. Your manager still plays a significant role in writing your packet and delivering feedback.</p><p><strong>3) Find next-level scope - </strong>If you only work on projects that fit your level‚Äôs behaviors, you won‚Äôt get any closer to promotion, no matter how good your work is. One simple pattern for finding next-level scope is brainstorming projects with engineers who are 1-2 levels higher than you are. Often, they will have a lot of projects sitting in their backlog that are big enough to help you get promoted. If you take on one of their projects, they‚Äôll often help mentor you, review your designs and code, and give you strong peer feedback for your future promotion packet. I wrote <a href=\"https://www.developing.dev/p/a-simple-pattern-for-finding-next\">more on this here</a>. Make sure to confirm with your manager that they agree that what you‚Äôre working on fits the behaviors of the next level.<strong>4) Maintain next-level behaviors and impact </strong>- The duration you need to perform at the next level varies depending on your level and your company. At minimum though, you need to maintain that performance for 6-12 months. This is because promotions are ‚Äúlagging‚Äù in tech. You must prove that you‚Äôre already operating at the next level before getting promoted. This reduces the risk of failing to meet expectations at the new level.</p><p>Getting promoted faster is a matter of doing steps (1), (2) and (3) as fast as possible. The best you can do is immediately start exceeding expectations in your first half and working with your manager on the next level.</p><p>Almost every team has scope for more Senior Engineers (IC5). You can get promoted up to that level if you have the skills and behaviors. Past that, situation and business scope play a much larger role. <a href=\"https://www.developing.dev/p/staff-career-growth-product-or-infra\">Many teams don‚Äôt need someone who has Staff-level leadership and technical skills</a>. If you find yourself stuck at any point due to your situation, you‚Äôll likely have to switch teams to continue growing your career.</p><p>Now that you have the algorithm that applies at any of these levels let‚Äôs get into the level-specific strategies. I‚Äôll share what got me promoted and what I would change if I did it again.</p><h2>Junior (IC3) ‚Üí Mid-level (IC4)</h2><p>The main difference between these levels is in the size of the scope that you can handle independently. Here‚Äôs a rule of thumb:</p><ul><li><p>IC3 - Can handle individual tasks (&lt;2 weeks of work) with minimal guidance</p></li><li><p>IC4 - Can handle medium-to-large features (&lt;2 months of work) with minimal guidance</p></li></ul><p>‚ÄúMinimal guidance‚Äù doesn‚Äôt mean that you can‚Äôt ask for help‚Äîit simply means that you can unblock yourself and make consistent progress. Asking good questions is one of the most effective ways to unblock yourself.</p><p>You should drive full features and do the project management for them. You should break your project into tasks, set reasonable timelines, and keep stakeholders updated.</p><p>You will not be expected to come up with the projects yet at this level‚ÄîSenior Engineers will often outline them. However, at the IC4 level, you‚Äôre expected to take more initiative:</p><ul><li><p>Initiate refactoring and code cleanups, and <a href=\"https://www.developing.dev/p/how-to-start-reviewing-code\">give thoughtful code reviews</a>. Leave the code in a better state than you found it.</p></li><li><p><strong>Contributing to production excellence - Participate in the team‚Äôs oncall, and help debug production breakages.</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Own the health of what you build - Add test coverage, logging, and build dashboards to monitor correctness.</strong></p></li></ul><p>Optimize your dev velocity to grow faster at this level. <a href=\"https://www.developing.dev/p/shipping-code-faster\">Shipping code faster</a> creates a shorter feedback loop, accelerating your learning process. This core skill will help you ship IC4-scope projects and improve as an engineer.</p><p>Here‚Äôs an example of several promotion timelines for what you can expect:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Promotion in 6 months (exceptional) - </strong>Rare since this means meeting IC4 expectations while onboarding. This is easier for high-performing return interns since they skip onboarding and may have some past track record already.</p></li><li><p><strong>Promotion in 12 months (great) - I‚Äôd shoot for this timeline. It‚Äôs challenging yet reasonable since it gives you six months to onboard and then start meeting IC4 expectations.</strong></p></li></ol><p>Here‚Äôs my promotion timeline as an example:<strong>H1 (L3 Exceeds Expectations)</strong> - First, I took on any task that came my way. These were nice-to-have features that others didn‚Äôt have time for. I completed them quickly and started on a larger pipeline rewrite (L4 scope) that my tech lead offered me. Outside of my main project work, I made many contributions to removing dead code and speeding up existing code because I enjoyed it.</p><p>I started to hit L4 expectations in the last few months of the half. But, since I didn‚Äôt have six months track record, I didn‚Äôt meet the promotion criteria.</p><p><strong>H2 (L3‚ÜíL4 Promotion, Greatly Exceeds Expectations)</strong> - I continued driving my L4-scope project independently with high engineering quality. I came up with the idea to build a test harness to validate this rewrite that was ‚Äúcomparable to L5 quality‚Äù execution. I continued my passion for improving the codebase and led the company in adding static type annotations that MonkeyType couldn‚Äôt.</p><p>At this point, I had delivered on L4 scope for over six months, so the promotion made sense.</p><p><strong>What I Would Have Changed:</strong></p><p>Looking back, I would have discussed what IC4 growth looked like with my manager. I wasted our one-on-one time on project updates instead of career growth. This led to two problems:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Spent time on work that wasn‚Äôt impactful</strong> - I took on any work that was passed my way, even though not all of it was impactful. I probably could‚Äôve gotten more out of my time.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p><strong>Didn‚Äôt have accurate expectations</strong> - I had another engineer tell me my work was IC4 level and that I should get promoted in my first half. I knew nothing then, so I took their word for it. I was surprised when I didn‚Äôt get promoted, which could have been avoided if I had been in sync with my manager.</p></li></ul><p>Although I could have been more calculated, writing as much code as I did opened doors. My tech lead trusted me with an IC4 project because I showed I could handle it. Similarly, some of the engineering craft work I did for my own personal pleasure ended up being part of what got me promoted too. <strong>The more work you do, the luckier you get.</strong></p><h2>Mid-level (IC4) ‚Üí Senior (IC5)</h2><p>The IC4 to IC5 gap is larger than the IC3 to IC4 one. This is because IC5 promotion requires significant behavior changes. Raw code output is no longer the top priority. You <a href=\"https://www.developing.dev/p/how-some-engineers-always-lead\">need to lead</a> and <a href=\"https://www.developing.dev/p/how-to-influence-without-authority\">have a larger influence</a> within your team too. Here are a few examples of those differences:</p><p>Example 1 - Improving the codebase</p><ul><li><p>IC4 - Initiates refactoring and code cleanups.</p></li><li><p>IC5 - Identifies areas of improvement, <strong>influences the team to take goals on improving it together</strong>, then leads the charge on those goals.</p></li></ul><p>Example 2 - Production excellence</p><ul><li><p>IC4 - Participates in team‚Äôs oncall and mitigating outages.</p></li><li><p>IC5 - Creates an ‚Äúoncall improvement‚Äù workstream and <strong>builds a process for everyone to improve the team‚Äôs oncall.</strong></p></li></ul><p>Example 3 - Project direction</p><ul><li><p>IC4 - Owns the project management of a medium-to-large feature.</p></li><li><p>IC5 - <strong>Drives team planning and builds a roadmap</strong> of several medium-to-large features.</p></li></ul><p>I wouldn‚Äôt say the IC5 examples are harder, but they require a mindset shift to own things at the team level.</p><p>Also, you‚Äôll need to work on projects of sufficient scope for an IC5. There are a few ways that tech companies measure scope. Here‚Äôs a comparison of the criteria for IC4 and IC5 levels:</p><p>These criteria aren‚Äôt a checklist. Your work can be IC5 scope by meeting only some of these criteria.</p><p>IC5 is also the first time engineers begin to focus on growing others. At this level, you should mentor others and build up the team‚Äôs culture, which includes <a href=\"https://www.developing.dev/p/how-to-drive-meetings\">driving meetings</a>, knowledge sharing, recruiting activities, and organizing team activities. Starting mentorship relationships early is a good idea since you can‚Äôt rush mentorship.</p><p>If you can learn the above behaviors quickly, you can expect promotion on these timelines:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Promotion in 6 months (exceptional) - </strong>This is rare since you need to exert team-level influence as soon as you join the team. I could see this happening for someone who was under-leveled and just got promoted to IC4.</p></li><li><p><strong>Promotion in 12 months (great) - </strong>If you‚Äôre ambitious, I‚Äôd aim for this goal. It is possible to do this if you find IC5 scope in your first half. If not, one more half should secure your promotion.</p></li></ol><p>Here‚Äôs my promotion timeline as an example:</p><p><strong>H1 (IC4 Exceeds Expectations)</strong> - This half I wrapped up the workstream that got me promoted to IC4 and picked up another IC4 project. I spent a ton of time on engineering craft this half because I enjoyed it. I deprecated a few legacy systems that no one else would because they were dangerous and not that impactful. I didn‚Äôt exhibit any IC5 behaviors this half.</p><p>My manager handed me an IC5 workstream (~6 eng) to <a href=\"https://about.instagram.com/blog/engineering/cutting-threads-send-latency-in-half\">cut video messaging latency in half</a>, which I led successfully. I also began a side project, which became a multiple-half collaboration with another team. Lastly, I took on an intern who did a phenomenal job helping me execute these two roadmaps I led. Although I started exhibiting IC5 behaviors, the company canceled performance reviews this half because of the pandemic.</p><p><strong>H3 (IC4 ‚Üí IC5 Promotion, Greatly Exceeds Expectations)</strong> - My impact this half could‚Äôve met expectations at the IC6 level. I doubled down on the cross-org scope I created in H2 and developed a multi-half roadmap. I influenced and led another team to invest several engineers to <a href=\"https://about.instagram.com/blog/engineering/making-instagram-video-ads-performant\">revamp the IG video ads pipeline</a> with great results. I built out a second workstream and mentored another engineer to deliver it. This half, I had massive impact, team-level influence, and mentorship, which is what got me promoted.</p><ul><li><p><strong>The Skill of Tech Leading</strong> - If you grew from L3 ‚Üí L4 right, you should be exceptional at landing code. The L5 behavior of team-level influence is just helping others do the same. In my first half of leading an initiative, I remember feeling unsure about it since I only had two years of experience. Leaning on my strong execution skills helped me become comfortable leading others.</p></li><li><p><strong>Working Hard Led To More Opportunities</strong> - I worked a lot and had a ton of workstreams in flight at the same time. This approach increased my chances of having one that had a ton of impact. At the time, I didn‚Äôt know it and was just throwing myself at any problems that came my way. Looking back, it was a great way to derisk my promotion.</p></li><li><p> - In my first half as an L4, I took on projects that were time-intensive and not impactful. I did these migrations because I loved cleaning up tech debt. I would‚Äôve had more impact if I had influenced someone else to do them while I found IC5 scope instead.</p></li></ul><h2>Senior (IC5) ‚Üí Staff (IC6)</h2><p>Staff Engineers (IC6) are at the same level as engineering managers. They solve problems that few others can and play a critical role in setting team direction. They lead major initiatives and influence the engineering culture of teams around them.</p><p>Some say that promotion from IC5 ‚Üí IC6 is harder than IC6 ‚Üí IC7 due to the significant behavior changes needed. There are a few major differences between IC5 and IC6.</p><p><strong>1) Influence Across Teams - </strong>Staff Engineer‚Äôs projects often extend beyond their team. They take on larger problems by influencing other teams without authority.</p><p>Once IC6s establish these workstreams, they tackle the hardest problems and work through others. They focus on outcomes and don‚Äôt always do the work themselves. <strong>Working through delegation and influence across teams is the biggest mindset shift from IC5 ‚Üí IC6.</strong></p><p>This style of working isn‚Äôt limited to their main project impact. IC6s should also use their influence to inspire a culture of higher engineering quality and reliability across teams.</p><p> - Senior Engineers (IC5) build roadmaps of several medium-to-large features that help achieve their team‚Äôs goals. In this case, the problem and its business impact are clear; we just need an engineer to create a plan to solve it.</p><p>Staff Engineers (L6) handle more ambiguity. They don‚Äôt just solve known problems; they create scope by finding impactful opportunities and problems. <strong>Managers work with their L6s to expand the scope of the team.</strong></p><p>- Big tech companies determine what level projects are in a few ways. Here‚Äôs a comparison of the criteria for L5 and L6 levels:</p><p>Project complexity also distinguishes IC6 scope. <strong>Problems that IC5s can‚Äôt solve are considered IC6 scope</strong>. This is why specialists often have IC6+ scope; others often can‚Äôt do their projects.</p><p>These criteria aren‚Äôt a checklist. Work can be IC6 scope by meeting only some of these. Your manager will use these criteria to argue that your work is IC6 scope. This is one of the reasons why it‚Äôs important to align with your manager on your work‚Äôs scope.</p><p> - Staff engineers uplift others around them. They should have the ability to help IC5 engineers grow. There are a few ways they uplift others:</p><ul><li><p>Mentorship - Dedicated mentorship, preferably with senior engineers</p></li><li><p>Knowledge sharing - Writing wikis, giving presentations, contributing to Q&amp;A groups</p></li><li><p>Collaborations - Growing others while working with them (e.g. code reviews, design reviews, discussions)</p></li></ul><p>IC6 engineers should also contribute to growing the organization. This means that they help with recruiting and partner with their manager to improve team health.</p><p>Getting to the Staff Engineering level can take a long time. Since IC5 is considered ‚Äúterminal,‚Äù there is no external pressure to achieve IC6 fast. However, if you are eager to grow as fast as possible, here‚Äôs how fas you can expect promotion:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Promotion in 1 half (Ridiculous)</strong> - You‚Äôd need to start influencing outside your team as soon as you join. Even then, it‚Äôs unlikely you‚Äôd get promoted this fast unless you create something company-changing.</p></li><li><p><strong>Promotion in 2 halves (Exceptional) </strong>- Finding IC6 opportunities on your team is not always possible this fast. It‚Äôs a combination of situation and skill to get promoted in two halves, even if you execute well.</p></li><li><p><strong>Promotion in 3 halves (Great) </strong>- If you‚Äôre ambitious I‚Äôd aim for this goal. It gives you a year to find IC6 scope, which is a reasonable amount of time to pivot if needed. Also, your track record of successes in the first year will help build the narrative for promotion.</p></li></ul><p><strong>H1 (IC5 Exceeds Expectations)</strong> - I led two workstreams that were partnerships with other teams to hit our goals. I also landed a <a href=\"https://about.instagram.com/blog/engineering/making-instagram-video-ads-performant\">large win in an unplanned ads workstream</a>, which is what brought my rating above expectations. I was also one of the top contributors to code review and interviewing in my 70-person eng org. The hidden success here was that I bootstrapped a new workstream towards the end of the half that was certainly IC6 scope.</p><p><strong>H2 (IC5 ‚Üí IC6 Promotion, Greatly Exceeds Expectations)</strong> - The IC6 workstream I created turned out to be a massive opportunity. <a href=\"https://engineering.fb.com/2022/11/04/video-engineering/instagram-video-processing-encoding-reduction/\">This work was a huge success</a>, resulting in a company-wide award and <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6994387208375873536/\">public recognition from Mark Zuckerberg</a>. I also created a cross-org collaboration between 3 large orgs (70+ eng each), which received positive feedback from each director. Lastly, I ran infrastructure preparations for my org resulting in no major incidents during the most critical time of the year. The repeated influence and impact of these large initiatives is what got me promoted to IC6.</p><p> - My past context and relationships at Instagram helped me move a lot faster. I could lead several workstreams at once because I knew so much about the codebase. Also, it was easier to get work done in collaboration because I knew partner engineers from past work. Staying at one company for a longer time does have its benefits.</p><p> - When I was an IC4, I stumbled upon some IC6 scope without realizing it. I had strong initiative so I started solving problems without thinking through why it was impactful. I got lucky that the work had IC6 impact. I‚Äôve since learned the importance of understanding the ‚Äúwhy‚Äù before diving in. It helps you have consistent IC6 impact and makes it easier to get buy-in for your work.</p><p><strong>The Tech Lead Skillset Scales Well </strong>- In my promotion to Senior (IC5), I learned how to lead initiatives within my team. This skillset turned out to work well at higher levels too. The difference was just that more people were involved. This skill is a great way to continue your IC growth to the highest levels if you fit the ‚Äútech lead‚Äù archetype.</p><p>Growth to the Staff level can take a long time, and luck plays a role. As you move up the ladder, each promotion depends more and more on your situation in addition to your skill.</p><p>There are ways to increase your luck. For instance, you can go to growing companies and teams. You can pick business-critical projects. You can go where the most talented people are. None of these are foolproof, but they increase your chances.</p><p>Aside from picking your situation, one way to manufacture luck is to do as much good work as you can. Many growth opportunities came to me because of some past work I did. People would reach out to me to do more of it or because they wanted to ask me questions about something I had launched.</p><p>Although luck plays a role, there are aspects of getting promoted that rely less on luck. Here are four high-level areas:</p><p>Impact is any measurable and objective outcome that benefits your company. Promotions are a byproduct of your elevated, sustained impact. If you can learn what your organization considers impactful and you deliver that, you will be rewarded.</p><p><strong>2) Leverage is how you have more impact.</strong> Software engineers increase their leverage through people, writing, and code. Leverage is what differentiates higher-level ICs from lower-level ones. What I mean by each type of leverage:</p><ul><li><p>People - People leverage comes from technical leadership. This means setting direction, reviewing designs/code, and growing others.</p></li><li><p>Writing - Writing gives us leverage by influencing and helping others without your active involvement.</p></li><li><p>Code - Not all code is created equal. High-leverage code solves problems that few others can or helps engineers move faster at scale.</p></li></ul><p> When people hear ‚Äúpersonal brand,‚Äù their minds often go to social media. But the brand that matters most is your ‚Äúinternal brand.‚Äù What do people within your company think about your work and its value? This is the brand that you should care most about.</p><p>Most of the top ICs I know are not well-known outside of Meta. They are legendary within the company, though because people see their impressive work. Build your internal brand by doing great work and letting others know about it (<a href=\"https://www.developing.dev/p/be-visible\">further reading here</a>).</p><p><strong>4) Build your soft skills.</strong> Working with others is a necessity to do anything of consequence. Also, being someone others want to work with makes it easier to find mentors who will uplift you along the way.</p><p>Soft skills are underrated among software engineers. It‚Äôs important to be an excellent IC, but you can go so much further if you also communicate well. Also, engineers don‚Äôt often prioritize soft skills, so having them will help you stand out and lead.</p><p>One last thing I‚Äôll leave you with is something that I didn‚Äôt realize until looking back. When I first joined the industry, I was an absolute machine. I would get in early and stay until the last shuttle left at 9:27 PM. Although this might sound like hell to some people, I loved it. No one made me do that; I put in those hours because I enjoyed the work and thought it was interesting.</p><p>Looking back years later, I realize that was an unfair advantage I had. It let me put in a ton of work without getting burned out. Also, I got much more out of what I did because I was intrinsically motivated.</p><p>If there‚Äôs one thing I wish for you, it is that you find work at the intersection of what you enjoy and what will get you promoted. That is the best recipe for hyper-career growth.</p><p>Thanks for reading,Ryan Peterman</p><p>If you found it valuable, hit a like ‚ù§Ô∏è and consider subscribing for more such content every week.</p><p>If you have any questions or suggestions, leave a comment.</p><p> If you‚Äôre enjoying this newsletter and want to get even more value, consider becoming a .</p>","contentLength":24211,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0173844b-0e38-4ca8-b779-b34f7f778872_1600x413.png","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Weekly Challenge: Counting the XOR","url":"https://dev.to/simongreennet/weekly-challenge-counting-the-xor-4hhc","date":1739679780,"author":"Simon Green","guid":556,"unread":true,"content":"<p>Each week Mohammad S.

Of that, $23 billion went to ‚Äúdirect‚Äù research costs, such as microscopes and researchers‚Äô salaries, according to an Upshot analysis of <a href=\"https://report.nih.gov/award/index.cfm?ot=&amp;fy=2024\">N.I.H. grant data</a>.</p><p>The other $9 billion went to the institutions‚Äô overhead, or ‚Äúindirect costs,‚Äù which can include laboratory upkeep, utility bills, administrative staff and access to hazardous materials disposal, all of which research institutions say is essential to making research possible.</p><p>The <a href=\"https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-OD-25-068.html\">N.I.H. proposal</a>, which has been <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/11/health/nih-research-funding-lawsuit-injunction.html\">put on hold by a federal court</a>, aims to reduce funding for those indirect costs to a set 15 percent rate that the administration says would save <a href=\"https://x.com/NIH/status/1888004759396958263\">about $4 billion a year</a>. The Upshot analysis estimates that a 15 percent rate would have reduced funding for the grants that received N.I.H. support in 2024 by at least $5 billion. The White House said the savings would be reinvested in more research, but the rate cuts would open up sizable budget holes in most projects at research institutions.</p><p>It is not clear whether those organizations can fill the gaps with other funding sources or by shifting how they apply for grants. Instead, many officials at universities and hospitals have said that they may have to pull back on medical or scientific research.</p><p>‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not an overstatement to say that a slash this drastic in total research funding slows research,‚Äù said Heather Pierce, senior director for science policy at the Association of American Medical Colleges, which has <a href=\"https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.mad.280609/gov.uscourts.mad.280609.1.0.pdf\">sued along with other education and hospital associations</a> to block the policy. And slower scientific progress, she said, would affect anyone who depends on the development of new treatments, medical interventions and diagnostic tools.</p><p>We estimate that virtually all universities and hospitals would see fewer funds on similar projects in the future. The 10 institutions that receive the most money from N.I.H. stand to lose more than $100 million per year on average.</p><p>To understand how the change would work, let‚Äôs look at <a href=\"https://reporter.nih.gov/search/JbRgAtchAUKHOoW2X1vObQ/projects/map/project-details/10821480\">one grant for about $600,000</a> sent last year to the University of Alabama at Birmingham to study whether exercise can improve memory for people with epilepsy.</p><p>The calculation above, which we have repeated for every grant paid last year, is a bit simplified. In reality, the researchers would lose even more money than we‚Äôve shown, because of the way indirect funding is calculated (see our methodology at the bottom of this article).</p><p>Our analysis also makes some other conservative assumptions given the policy‚Äôs uncertainty. We assume, for instance, that the new 15 percent rate is a flat rate that all grantees would receive, and not a maximum rate (a distinction left unclear in the N.I.H. guidance). We also assume that the change applies not just to institutions of higher education, but also to all kinds of grantees, including hospitals.</p><p>In a statement, the White House indicated it would reserve any savings for additional research grants. ‚ÄúContrary to the hysteria, redirecting billions of allocated N.I.H. spending away from administrative bloat means there will be more money and resources available for legitimate scientific research, not less,‚Äù said Kush Desai, a White House spokesman.</p><p>The N.I.H. announcement, however, coincides with the Trump administration‚Äôs moves to cut spending across the government, and with the N.I.H.‚Äôs withholding of funding for grants ‚Äî their direct and indirect costs alike ‚Äî in <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/31/us/trump-freeze-blocked.html\">apparent conflict</a><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/28/us/politics/states-lawsuit-trump-federal-grants-pause.html\">with separate court orders</a>.</p><p>The N.I.H. <a href=\"https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-OD-25-068.html\">guidance document</a> includes a number of conflicting statements and statistics the Upshot could not reconcile. The N.I.H. also declined to answer questions about the policy and about its public-facing data tracking grant spending.</p><p>The N.I.H. since 1950 has provided these overhead funds in a formulaic way, and since 1965, the government has used a rate individually calculated for each institution. Federal officials review cost summaries, floor plans and other information to determine that rate. That number can be higher for institutions in more expensive parts of the country, or for those that use more energy-intensive equipment. The proposal from the Trump administration would set aside those differences in standardizing the rate at 15 percent for every grantee.</p><p>The lists below estimate what would have happened to the 10 universities and hospitals that received the most N.I.H. grant money in the 2024 fiscal year, if the formula change had been in effect then.</p><figure><div><div><div><h3>Largest N.I.H. grant recipients among colleges, universities and medical schools</h3></div></div></div><div><div><div><table><thead data-svelte-h=\"svelte-1s18ww\"><tr></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><div>University of California, San Francisco</div></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td><div>University of Pennsylvania</div></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td><div>Columbia University Health Sciences</div></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr></tbody></table></div></div></div><div><div><div><p>Source: National Institutes of Health</p><p>Based on spending in the 2024 fiscal year.</p></div></div></div></figure><figure><div><div><div><h3>Largest N.I.H. grant recipients among hospitals</h3></div></div></div><div><div><div><table><thead data-svelte-h=\"svelte-1s18ww\"><tr></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><div>Massachusetts General Hospital</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>Vanderbilt University Medical Center</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>Brigham and Women‚Äôs Hospital</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>Boston Children‚Äôs Hospital</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>Children‚Äôs Hospital of Philadelphia</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>Dana-Farber Cancer Institute</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>Cincinnati Childrens Hospital Medical Center</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>Cedars-Sinai Medical Center</div></td></tr></tbody></table></div></div></div><div><div><div><p>Source: National Institutes of Health</p><p>Based on spending in the 2024 fiscal year, which extends from Oct. 1 to Sept. 30.</p></div></div></div></figure><p>If courts allow the change to move forward, some of its consequences are hard to predict.</p><p>Advocates for the policy change note that these organizations receive numerous other federal subsidies. Most universities and research hospitals are nonprofits that pay no federal taxes, for example. The N.I.H. announcement also noted that these same institutions often accept grants from charitable foundations that offer much lower overhead rates than the federal government, a signal that universities and hospitals willingly pursue research opportunities with less supplemental funding.</p><p>Because the indirect payments are based on broad formulas and not specific line items, critics say institutions may be diverting these federal dollars into unaccountable funds to pay for programs that taxpayers can‚Äôt see, such as the kinds of diversity, equity and inclusion programs targeted by the Trump administration.</p><p>‚ÄúThat‚Äôs how you get things like the ability of administrators to use larger overhead pools of money to build out D.E.I. bureaucracies, or to fund Ph.D. programs in the humanities,‚Äù said Jay Greene, a senior research fellow in the Center for Education Policy at the Heritage Foundation, a conservative research group. Mr. Greene was the coauthor of <a href=\"https://www.heritage.org/education/report/indirect-costs-how-taxpayers-subsidize-university-nonsense\">a 2022 article</a> urging the N.I.H. to cut or eliminate indirect grant funding. But he did not have specific examples to cite of research funds being spent in this way.</p><p>Researchers say the indirect funds have a branding problem, but are a necessary component of research.</p><p>‚ÄúThe term ‚Äòindirect costs‚Äô or the alternative term ‚Äòoverhead‚Äô sounds dangerously close to ‚Äòslush fund‚Äô to some people,‚Äù said Jeremy Berg, who was the director of the National Institute of General Medical Sciences at the N.I.H. from 2003 to 2011. ‚ÄúThere are real costs somebody has to pay for, and heating and cooling university laboratory buildings is a real cost.‚Äù</p><p>Some grant recipients already receive low overhead payments, but a large majority of them currently receive more than 15 percent, meaning they will need to make budgetary changes to absorb the loss. Among the 2024 grants that we analyzed, institutions that received more than $1 million in N.I.H. support got an average of 40 cents of indirect funding for every dollar of direct funding.</p><figure aria-label=\"graphic\"><div><div><div><h3>Distribution of overhead funding at N.I.H.-funded institutions in 2024</h3><p>As a share of direct funding</p></div></div></div><div><div><div><p>Source: National Institutes of Health</p><p>Calculated for 613 institutions that received at least $1 million in funding in fiscal year 2024. Federally negotiated rates are higher than these.</p></div></div></div></figure><p>Universities and hospitals may adjust their overall budgets to keep supporting medical research by cutting back on other things they do. Some might be able to raise money from donors to fill the shortfalls, though most universities are already raising as much philanthropic money as they can.</p><p>But many research institutions have said they would adjust by simply doing less medical research, because they would not be able to afford to do as much with less government help.</p><p>Universities and hospitals might also shift the kinds of research they do, avoiding areas that require more lab space, regulatory compliance or high-tech equipment, and focusing on types of research that will require them to provide less overhead funding themselves. That may mean disproportionate reductions in complex areas of research like genetics.</p><p>Those effects may be spread unevenly across the research landscape, as some organizations find a way to adjust, while others abandon medical research altogether.</p><p>We‚Äôve compiled a list of institutions that received at least $1 million in N.I.H. funding in the 2024 fiscal year, along with our estimates of how much less they would have gotten under the new policy. Most of these institutions are universities or hospitals, but there are also some private companies and nonprofit research groups. Our numbers tend to be underestimates of the cuts.</p><figure><div><div><div><p>To estimate changes in funding, we relied on data from RePORT, the N.I.H.‚Äôs online <a href=\"https://report.nih.gov/award/index.cfm?ot=&amp;fy=2024\">registry</a> of grants and projects. We limited our analysis to grants listed within the 50 U.S. states, the District of Columbia or Puerto Rico. We also limited it to grants where the amount of indirect funding was known and where the combined indirect and direct funding was within five percent of the listed total funding. These filters resulted in removing many grants to private organizations such as domestic for-profits.</p><p>We calculated how much indirect funding each grant would have received under the new guidance by multiplying the listed direct funding amount by 15 percent. We then compared that number to the listed indirect funding amount for each great to estimate the impact of the policy.</p><p>There are two reasons our calculations are most likely conservative estimates of true reductions in funding. First, only a portion of the direct funding for each grant is considered to be ‚Äúeligible‚Äù for the purposes of calculating indirect funding. For example, laboratory equipment and graduate student tuition reimbursements are deducted from the direct costs before applying the negotiated overhead rate, whereas our calculations assumed 100 percent of the listed direct costs would be eligible. We performed a more accurate version of our calculations for the 10 universities and 10 hospitals receiving the most N.I.H. funds by inferring their eligible direct costs from their reported negotiated rates. When we did this, we saw an additional increase in losses of about 20 percent.</p><p>Second, we applied a 15 percent rate to all grants in the database, including those with an initial indirect rate  15 percent. An <a href=\"https://jamessmurphy.com/2025/02/09/the-impact-of-an-nih-15-indirect-cost-rate/\">analysis by James Murphy</a> helped inform this approach. According to our analysis, then, some grants would actually receive more money under the new guidance.

While it is unclear what formula the administration will use to determine what is ‚Äúreciprocal,‚Äù the intention of responding to foreign charges‚Äîreal and perceived‚Äîis clear enough.</p><p>In the past, the administration has made general assertions about different  and nontariff barriers that American exporters face that should be rectified by ‚Äúreciprocal‚Äù US tariffs. Trump commonly <a href=\"https://www.politico.eu/article/european-carmakers-crossfire-united-states-europe-trade-war/\">mentions</a> that the EU charges a 10 percent import  on US vehicles while the US only levies a 2.5 percent tariff on European cars coming into the US. Though one can certainly find examples of higher trade barriers abroad, the <a href=\"https://www.cato.org/commentary/tariff-myths-debunked?gad_source=1&amp;gclid=CjwKCAiAqrG9BhAVEiwAaPu5zgSuxH-XwbT7Kgb7FE6uvM7OAkMDDekbiXjFKgJwJ802UUqtLUJabhoC4ukQAvD_BwE\">overall tariff gap</a> between the US and its trading partners is <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/posts/fernando-mart%C3%ADn-711a5790_us-export-coverages-activity-7295353938608820224-aT4M?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAAA_TE_ABEkKJ4JUzvJbx21NNIBaNIUkAoX8\">relatively minor</a>‚Äîand any increase in US tariffs will ultimately be paid by US businesses and consumers.  </p><p>However, when discussing trade with the EU specifically, White House deputy chief of staff, Stephen Miller, <a href=\"https://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2025/02/09/miller_trump_trade_action_against_europe_will_offset_eu_regulations_and_vat_taxes_on_american_products.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">added</a> a new policy grievance to the mix: <a href=\"https://taxfoundation.org/taxedu/glossary/value-added-tax-vat/\">value-added taxes (VAT)</a>.  </p><p>‚ÄúDid you know when you ship a car from the US to Europe, if they let it in at all because they have many nontariff barriers, between the VAT and duties, that car is taxed at 30%? The German car‚Äîor a European car sent the America is taxed at 2.5%‚Äîor basically 0.‚Äù</p><p>His statement assumes that a VAT discriminates against American car exports like a tariff, and conversely, that the VAT rebate provided to European car producers exporting to the US constitutes a subsidy and the car then simply faces a tariff and no VAT. (It is worth noting that both a domestic automobile and a European car sold in the US would face US state .) </p><p> may seem like a compelling political argument to justify across-the-board tariffs on the EU, it instead reflects a complete misunderstanding of what a VAT is and how it works. Worse, it misplaces the blame for a lack of US competitiveness on the European VAT instead of reevaluating the flaws of both the US federal and state tax systems.  </p><h2><strong>What is VAT and how does it work for exported goods?</strong></h2><p><a href=\"https://taxfoundation.org/taxedu/glossary/value-added-tax-vat/\">VATs</a> are border-adjusted, meaning they rebate tax on exports and impose tax on imports. Despite the appearance of subsidizing exports and punishing imports, however, a border-adjusted VAT is trade neutral. A border adjusted tax leads to currency appreciation for the imposing country, which would make it cheaper to import goods, more expensive to export goods, and thus would cancel out the apparent benefits of the tax on imports and the rebate on exports.</p><p>If there is a complaint to be made about tax policy and implications for US competitiveness in Europe, it is about uncompetitive state sales tax structures in the US system that yield what is known as ‚Äú.‚Äù</p><h2><strong>What is US sales tax and how does it work for exported goods? </strong></h2><p>Unlike most countries, the <a href=\"https://taxfoundation.org/location/united-states/\">United States</a> does not impose a broad-based  at the national (federal) level, and state-level consumption taxes are designed as general sales taxes rather than value-added taxes. Whereas a VAT is imposed on the incremental increase in value of a good or service at each stage of production, a <a href=\"https://taxfoundation.org/taxedu/glossary/sales-tax/\">sales tax</a> is imposed on the total transaction price of any taxed good or service.</p><p>If a sales tax is imposed exclusively on final consumption, then VATs and sales taxes are economically identical. However, when the sales tax is applied to some intermediate transactions (‚Äúbusiness inputs‚Äù), it results in tax pyramiding, where the tax is embedded in the price multiple times over.</p><p>Consider the following example of a 5 percent VAT and two versions of a 5 percent sales tax‚Äîone which only applies to final consumption, and one which applies to certain intermediate transactions as well.</p><h4>VATs and Ideal Sales Taxes are Economically Identical</h4><h5><em>A 5% VAT compared to a 5% ideal sales tax and a 5% sales tax with business input taxation</em></h5><p>Note that, while a VAT is imposed at every stage of the process, the net effect is to apply the rate one time to the final sales price. The tax is collected in increments (on the ‚Äúvalue added‚Äù at each stage), but unlike with a pyramiding sales tax, it does not double tax inputs. The VAT and ideal sales tax share an identical  and, if imposed at the same rates, yield identical collections.</p><p>US sales taxes are typically destination-based, meaning that the tax is owed where the product is received or consumed. If a European resident orders from a US retailer, they do not pay US sales tax, just like a US consumer can obtain a VAT rebate on purchases of European products. Neither is a subsidy. These are simply consumption taxes falling on the consumer.</p><p>In practice, however, US sales taxes diverge sharply from the ideal. More than 40 percent of US sales tax revenue comes from intermediate transactions, which impose costs on US producers. This design flaw is not present in VATs, which do not double-tax intermediate transactions. Consequently, the sales tax imposes a penalty on domestic production that a VAT (or a better designed sales tax) would not. European VATs aren‚Äôt subsidizing anything‚ÄîUS states are just shooting themselves in the foot.</p><p>Crucially, this is true in domestic as well as international sales. If a state‚Äôs sales tax only applied to final consumption, it would never put in-state businesses at a disadvantage against rivals in other states, because consumers elsewhere are subject to their own state‚Äôs sales tax. A <a href=\"https://taxfoundation.org/location/maryland/\">Maryland</a> resident pays 6 percent sales tax on whatever she orders (that‚Äôs subject to Maryland‚Äôs sales tax), regardless of whether she buys from a retailer in Maryland, or <a href=\"https://taxfoundation.org/location/delaware/\">Delaware</a> (with no sales tax), or <a href=\"https://taxfoundation.org/location/louisiana/\">Louisiana</a> (with an average rate north of 10 percent). But when Maryland taxes business inputs, that imposes a cost on Maryland businesses that could be mitigated if businesses operated in lower-tax states or in states which include fewer inputs in their tax base.</p><p>The disadvantages created by the sales tax, therefore, aren‚Äôt unique to goods exported abroad. They aren‚Äôt the consequence of trade policy, but of poor tax policy. Europe‚Äôs VATs are not tariffs and are not subsidizing European exports. Instead, US states‚Äô poorly-designed sales taxes are harming their own businesses‚Äô competitiveness‚Äîwhether they‚Äôre selling down the street, across state lines, or around the world.</p><h2><strong>What competitiveness issues remain with the US federal tax system?</strong></h2><p>Just like state sales tax systems can create a competitive disadvantage for producers, certain elements of the federal income tax system harm incentives to invest domestically. Despite progress made by the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, the US maintains long  schedules for structures investment, now requires amortization for research and development expenses, and is phasing out  for machinery and equipment investment. The absence of full, immediate deductions for investment increases the cost of capital, and thus discourages investment and wage growth.</p><p>Rather than focus on raising tariffs, which i<a href=\"https://taxfoundation.org/testimony/tariffs-alternatives-boost-us-competitiveness/\">ncrease the cost</a> of operating in the United States and <a href=\"https://taxfoundation.org/testimony/tariffs-alternatives-boost-us-competitiveness/\">reduce total output and productivity</a>, fiscal policy reforms to improve the structure of the federal income tax system can better boost competitiveness of the US manufacturing sector.</p><p>Countries have many reasons why they apply different tariff rates to different products. In the case of the United States, some tariffs date back to the 1930s Smoot-Hawley tariff schedule, while other US trade barriers take on non-tariff forms. The Trump administration appears to be moving in a ‚Äúreciprocal‚Äù policy direction despite the significant negative economic consequences for American consumers of across-the-board tariffs on goods coming into the US. However, the EU‚Äôs VAT system should not be used as a justification for retaliatory tariffs. </p><div data-id=\"1\"><h2>Stay informed on the tax policies impacting you.</h2><p>Subscribe to get insights from our trusted experts delivered straight to your inbox.</p><a href=\"https://taxfoundation.org/tax-newsletter\">Subscribe</a></div>","contentLength":7923,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43062457"},{"title":"Design, Manufacturing and Open-Loop Control of a Soft Pneumatic Arm: Bending Experiments","url":"https://hackernoon.com/design-manufacturing-and-open-loop-control-of-a-soft-pneumatic-arm-bending-experiments?source=rss","date":1739653203,"author":"EScholar: Electronic Academic Papers for Scholars","guid":478,"unread":true,"content":"<p>(1) Jorge Francisco Garcia-Samartƒ±n, Centro de Automatica y Robotica (UPM-CSIC), Universidad Politecnica de Madrid ‚Äî Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientƒ±ficas, Jose Gutierrez Abascal 2, 28006 Madrid, Spain (jorge.gsamartin@upm.es);</p><p>(2) Adrian Rieker, Centro de Automatica y Robotica (UPM-CSIC), Universidad Politecnica de Madrid ‚Äî Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientƒ±ficas, Jose Gutierrez Abascal 2, 28006 Madrid, Spain;</p><p>(3) Antonio Barrientos, Centro de Automatica y Robotica (UPM-CSIC), Universidad Politecnica de Madrid ‚Äî Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientƒ±ficas, Jose Gutierrez Abascal 2, 28006 Madrid, Spain.</p><p>3 PAUL: Design and Manufacturing </p><p>4 Data Acquisition and Open-Loop Control </p><p>The first experiment consisted of analysing the deflection of a segment versus swelling time.

What if <a href=\"https://www.cs.otago.ac.nz/cosc345/resources/nasa-10-rules.htm#ppar\">function pointers\nwere tamed</a>?  What if the language provided opaque abstract\ndata types as Ada does?\n</li></ul><h3>1. Restrict all code to very simple control flow constructs ‚Äî\ndo not use  statements,\n or  constructs,\nand direct or indirect .</h3><p>Note that  and \nare how C does exception handling, so this rule bans any use\nof exception handling.\n\n</p><p>It is true that banning recursion and jumps and loops without\nexplicit bounds means that you  your program is\ngoing to terminate.  It is also true that recursive functions\ncan be proven to terminate about as often as loops can, with\nreasonably well-understood methods.  What's more important here is\nthat ‚Äúsure to terminate‚Äù does not imply\n‚Äúsure to terminate in my lifetime‚Äù:\n</p><pre>    int const N = 1000000000;\n    for (x0 = 0; x0 != N; x0++)\n    for (x1 = 0; x1 != N; x1++)\n    for (x2 = 0; x2 != N; x2++)\n    for (x3 = 0; x3 != N; x3++)\n    for (x4 = 0; x4 != N; x4++)\n    for (x5 = 0; x5 != N; x5++)\n    for (x6 = 0; x6 != N; x6++)\n    for (x7 = 0; x7 != N; x7++)\n    for (x8 = 0; x8 != N; x8++)\n    for (x9 = 0; x9 != N; x9++)\n        -- do something --;\n</pre><p>This does a bounded number of iterations.  The bound is N.\nIn this case, that's 10.  If each iteration of the loop body\ntakes 1 nsec, that's 10 seconds, or about 7.9√ó10\nyears.  What is the  difference between ‚Äúwill stop\nin 7,900,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000\nyears‚Äù and ‚Äúwill never stop‚Äù?\n\n</p><p>Worse still, taking a problem that is  expressed\nusing recursion and contorting it into something that manipulates an\nexplicit stack, while possible, turns clear maintainable code into\nbuggy spaghetti.  (I've done it, several times.  There's an example\non this web site.  It is  a good idea.)\n\n</p><h3>2. All loops must have a fixed upper-bound.  It must be trivially\npossible for a checking tool to prove statically that a preset\nupper-bound on the number of iterations of a loop cannot be exceeded.\nIf the loop-bound cannot be proven statically, the rule is considered\nviolated.</h3><p>This is an old idea.  As the example above shows, it is not enough\nby itself to be of any practical use.  You have to try to make the\nbounds reasonably , and you have to regard hitting an\nartificial bound as a run-time error.\n\n</p><p>By the way, note that putting depth bounds on recursive procedures\nmakes them every bit as safe as loops with fixed bounds.\n\n</p><h3>3. Do not use dynamic memory allocation after initialization.</h3><p>This is also a very old idea.  Some languages designed for embedded\nwork don't even  dynamic memory allocation.  The big\nthing, of course, is that embedded applications have a fixed amount of\nmemory to work with, are never going to get any more, and should not\ncrash because they couldn't handle another record.\n\n</p><p>Note that the rationale actually supports a much stronger rule:\ndon't even  dynamic memory allocation.  You can of\ncourse manage your own storage pool:\n</p><pre>    typedef struct Foo_Record *foo;\n    struct Foo_Record {\n\tfoo next;\n\t...\n    };\n    #define MAX_FOOS ...\n    static struct Foo_Record foo_zone[MAX_FOOS];\n    foo foo_free_list = 0;\n\n    void init_foo_free_list() {\n\tfor (int i = MAX_FOOS - 1; i &gt;= 0; i--) {\n\t    foo_zone[i].next = foo_free_list;\n\t    foo_free_list = &amp;foo_zone[i];\n\t}\n    }\n\n    foo malloc_foo() {\n\tfoo r = foo_free_list;\n\tif (r == 0) report_error();\n\tfoo_free_list = r-&gt;next;\n\treturn r;\n    }\n\n    void free_foo(foo x) {\n\tx-&gt;next = foo_free_list;\n\tfoo_free_list = x;\n    }\n</pre><p>This  satisfies the rule, but it\nviolates the  of the rule.  Simulating malloc()\nand free() this way is  than using the real\nthing, because the memory in foo_zone is permanently tied up\nfor Foo_Records, even if we don't need any of those at the\nmoment but do desperately need the memory for something else.\n\n</p><p>What you really need to do is to use a memory allocator\nwith known behaviour, and to prove that the amount of memory\nin use at any given time (data bytes + headers) is bounded\nby a known value.\n\n</p><p>Note also that SPlint can verify at compile time that\nthe errors NASA speak of do not occur.\n\n</p><p>One of the reasons given for the ban is that the performance\nof malloc() and free() is unpredictable.  Are these the only\nfunctions we use with unpredictable performance?  Is there\nanything about malloc() and free() which makes them\n unpredictable?  The existence of\nhard-real-time garbage collectors suggests not.\n\n</p><p>The rationale for this rule says that\n</p><blockquote>\nNote that the only way\nto dynamically claim memory in the absence of memory allocation from the\nheap is to use stack memory.  In the absence of recursion (Rule 1), an\nupper bound on the use of stack memory can derived statically, thus\nmaking it possible to prove that an application will always live within\nits pre-allocated memory means.\n</blockquote><p>Unfortunately, the sunny optimism shown here is unjustified.  Given\nthe ISO C standard (any version, C89, C99, or C11) it is \nto determine an upper bound on the use of stack memory.  There is not even\nany standard way to determine how much memory a compiler will use for the\nstack frame of a given function.  (There could have been.  There just isn't.)\nThere isn't even any requirement that two invocations of the same function\nwith the same arguments will use the same amount of memory.\nSuch a bound can only be calculated for a  version of a\nspecific compiler with specific options.  Here's a trivial example:\n</p><pre>void f() {\n    char a[100000];\n}\n</pre><p>How much memory will that take on the stack?  Compiled for debugging,\nit might take a full stack frame (however big that is) plus traceback\ninformation plus a million bytes for a[].  Compiled with optimisation,\nthe compiler might notice that a[] isn't used, and might even compile\ncalls to f() inline so that they generate no code and take no space.\nThat's an extreme example, but not really unfair.  If you want bounds\nyou can rely on, you had better  what your compiler does,\nand recheck every time anything about the compiler changes.\n\n</p><h3>4.  No function should be longer than what can be printed on\na single sheet of paper in a standard reference format with one line per\nstatement and one line per declaration.  Typically, this means no more\nthan about 60 lines of code per function.</h3><p>Since programmers these days typically read their code on-screen,\nnot on paper, it's not clear why the size of a sheet of paper is\nrelevant any longer.\n\n</p><p>The rule is arguably stated about the wrong thing.  The thing that\nneeds to be bounded is not the size of a function, but the size of a\nchunk that a programmer needs to read and comprehend.\n\n</p><p>There are also question marks about how to interpret this if you\nare using a sensible language (like Algol 60, Simula 67, Algol 68,\nPascal, Modula2, Ada, Lisp, functional languages like ML, O'CAML,\nF#, Clean, Haskell, or Fortran) that allows nested procedures.\nSuppose you have a folding editor that presents a procedure to\nyou like this:\n</p><pre>function Text_To_Floating(S: string, E: integer): Double;\n   ÔøΩ variables ÔøΩ\n   ÔøΩ procedure Mul(Carry: integer) ÔøΩ\n   ÔøΩ function Evaluate: Double ÔøΩ\n\n   Base, Sign, Max, Min, Point, Power := 10, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0;\n   for N := 1 to S.length do begin\n       C := S[N];\n       if C = '.' then begin\n          Point := -1\n       end else\n       if C = '_' then begin\n          Base := Round(Evaluate);\n          Max, Min, Power := 0, 1, 0\n       end else\n       if Char ‚â† ' ' then begin\n          Q := ord(C) - ord('0');\n          if Q &gt; 9 then Q := ord(C) - ord('A') + 10\n          Power := Point + Point\n          Mul(Q)\n       end\n    end;\n    Power := Power + Exp;\n    Value := Evaluate;\n    if Sign &lt; 0 then Value := -Value;\nend;\n</pre><p>which would be much bigger if the declarations\nwere expanded out instead of being hidden behind ÔøΩfoldsÔøΩ.\nWhich size do we count?  The folded size or the unfolded size?\n</p><p>I was using a folding editor called Apprentice on the Classic Mac\nback in the 1980s.  It was written by Peter McInerny and was lightning\nfast.\n\n</p><h3>5.  The  of the code should average to a minimum of\ntwo assertions per function.</h3><p>Assertions are wonderful documentation and the very best debugging tool\nI know of.  I have never seen any real code that had too many assertions.\n\n</p><p>The example here is one of the ugliest pieces of code I've seen in a while.\n</p><pre>if (!c_assert(p &gt;= 0) == true) {\n    return ERROR;\n}\n</pre><p>It should, of course, just be\n</p><pre>if (!c_assert(p &gt;= 0)) {\n    return ERROR;\n}\n</pre><p>Better still, it should be something like\n</p><pre>#ifdef NDEBUG\n#define check(e, c) (void)0\n#else\n#define check(e, c) if (!(c)) return bugout(c), (e)\n#ifdef NDEBUG_LOG\n#define bugout(c) (void)0\n#else\n#define bugout(c) \\\n    fprintf(stderr, \"%s:%d: assertion '%s' failed.\\n\", \\\n    __FILE__, __LINE__, #s)\n#endif\n#endif\n</pre><p>Ahem.  The more interesting part is the required density.\nI just checked an open source project from a large telecoms\ncompany, and 23 out of 704 files (not functions) contained\nat least one assertion.  I just checked my own Smalltalk\nsystem and one SLOC out of every 43 was an assertion, but\nthe average Smalltalk ‚Äúfunction‚Äù is only a few\nlines.  If the biggest function allowed is 60 lines, then\nlet's suppose the average function is about 36 lines, so\nthis rule requires 1 assertion per 18 lines.\n</p><p>Assertions are good, but what they are especially good\nfor is expressing the requirements on data that come\nfrom outside the function.  I suggest then that\n</p><ul><li>Every argument whose validity is not guaranteed by\nits typed should have an assertion to check it.\n</li><li>Every datum that is obtained from an external\nsource (file, data base, message) whose validity is\nnot guaranteed by its type should have an assertion\nto check it.\n</li></ul><p>The NASA 10 rules are written for embedded systems, where\nreading stuff from sensors is fairly common.\n\n</p><h3>6.  Data objects must be declared at the smallest possible level of\nscope.</h3><p>This is excellent advice, but why limit it to data objects?\nOh yeah, the rules were written for crippled languages where you\n declare functions in the right place.\n\n</p><p>People using Ada, Pascal (Delphi), JavaScript, or functional\nlanguages should also declare types and functions as locally as\npossible.\n\n</p><h3>7.  The return value of non-void functions must be checked by each\ncalling function, and the validity of parameters must be checked inside\neach function.</h3><p>This again is mainly about C, or any other language that indicates\nfailure by returning special values.  ‚ÄúStandard libraries\nfamously violate this rule‚Äù?  No, the  library does.\n\n</p><p>You have to be reasonable about this: it simply isn't practical\nto check  aspect of validity for \nargument.  Take the C function\n</p><pre>void *bsearch(\n    void const *key  /* what we are looking for */,\n    void const *base /* points to an array of things like that */,\n    size_t      n    /* how many elements base has */,\n    size_t      size /* the common size of key and base's elements */\n    int (*      cmp)(void const *, void const *)\n);\n</pre><p>This does a binary search in an array.  We must have key‚â†0,\nbase‚â†0, size‚â†0, cmp‚â†0, cmp(key,key)=0, and for all\n1&lt;i&lt;n,\n</p><pre>cmp((char*)base+size*(i-1), (char*)base+size*i) &lt;= 0\n</pre><p>Checking the validity in full would mean checking\nthat [key..key+size) is a range of readable addresses,\n[base..base+size*n) is a range of readable addresses,\nand doing n calls to cmp.  But the whole point of binary\nsearch is to do O(log(n)) calls to cmp.\n\n</p><p>The fundamental rules here are\n</p><ul><li>Don't let run-time errors go un-noticed, and\n</li><li>any check is safer than no check.\n</li></ul><h3>8. The use of the preprocessor must be limited to the inclusion of\nheader files and simple macro definitions.  Token pasting, variable\nargument lists (ellipses), and recursive macro calls are not allowed.</h3><p>Recursive macro calls don't really work in C, so no quarrel there.\nVariable argument lists were introduced into macros in\nC99 so that you could write code like\n</p><pre>#define err_printf(level, ...) \\\n    if (debug_level &gt;= level) fprintf(stderr, __VA_ARGS__)\n...\n    err_printf(HIGH, \"About to frob %d\\n\", control_index);\n</pre><p>This is a  thing; conditional tracing like this is a\npowerful debugging aid.  It should be , not banned.\n\n</p><p>The rule goes on to ban macros that expand into things that are\nnot complete syntactic units.  This would, for example, prohibit\nsimulating try-catch blocks with macros.  (Fair enough, an earlier rule\nbanned exception handling anyway.)  Consider this code fragment, from\nan actual program.\n</p><pre>    row_flag = border;     \n    if (row_flag) printf(\"\\\\hline\");\n    for_each_element_child(e0, i, j, e1)\n        printf(row_flag ? \"\\\\\\\\\\n\" : \"\\n\");\n        row_flag = true;  \n        col_flag = false;\n        for_each_element_child(e1, k, l, e2)\n            if (col_flag) printf(\" &amp; \");\n            col_flag = true;\n            walk_paragraph(\"\", e2, \"\");\n        end_each_element_child\n    end_each_element_child\n    if (border) printf(\"\\\\\\\\\\\\hline\");\n    printf(\"\\n\\\\end{tabular}\\n\");\n</pre><p>It's part of a program converting slides written in something like HTML\ninto another notation for formatting.  The \n‚Ä¶  loops walk over a tree.  Using\nthese macros means that the programmer has no need to know and no reason to\ncare how the tree is represented and how the loop actually works.\nYou can easily see that  must have at\nleast one unmatched { and  must have at least one\nunmatched }.  That's the kind of macro that's banned by requiring\ncomplete syntactic units.  Yet the readability and maintainability of\nthe code is  improved by these macros.\n\n</p><p>One thing the rule covers, but does not at the beginning stress, is\n‚Äúno  macro processing‚Äù.  That is,\nno #if.  The argument against it is, I'm afraid, questionable.  If there\nare 10 conditions, there are 2 combinations to test,\nwhether they are expressed as compile-time conditionals or run-time\nconditionals.\n\n</p><p>In particular, the rule against conditional macro processing\nwould prevent you defining your own <a href=\"https://www.cs.otago.ac.nz/cosc345/resources/nasa-10-rules.htm#check\">assertion macros</a>.\nIt is not obvious that that's a good idea.\n\n</p><h3>9.  The use of pointers should be restricted.  Specifically, no more\nthan one level of dereferencing is allowed.  Pointer dereference\noperations may not be hidden in macro definitions or inside typedef\ndeclarations.  Function pointers are not permitted.</h3><p>Let's look at the last point first.\n\n</p><pre>double integral(double (*f)(double), double lower, double upper, int n) {\n    // Compute the integral of f from lower to upper \n    // using Simpson's rule with n+1 points.\n    double const h = (upper - lower) / n;\n    double       s;\n    double       t;\n    int          i;\n    \n    s = 0.0;\n    for (i = 0; i &lt; n; i++) s += f((lower + h/2.0) + h*i);\n    t = 0.0;\n    for (i = 1; i &lt; n; i++) t += f(lower + h*i);\n    return (f(lower) + f(upper) + s*4.0 + t*2.0) * (h/6.0);\n}\n</pre><p>This kind of code has been important in numerical calculations since\nthe very earliest days.  Pascal could do it.  Algol 60 could do it.\nIn the 1950s, Fortran could do it.  And NASA would ban it, because in\nC,  is a function pointer.\n\n</p><p>Now it's important to write functions like this once and only once.\nFor example, the code has at least one error.  The comment says n+1\npoints, but the function is actually evaluated at 2n+1 points.  If we\nneed to bound the number of calls to f in order to meet a deadline,\nhaving that number off by a factor of two will not help.\n</p><p>It's nice to have just one place to fix.\nPerhaps I should not have copied that code from a well-known source (:-).\nCertainly I should not have more than one copy!\n\n</p><p>What can we do if we're not allowed to use function pointers?\nSuppose there are four functions foo, bar, ugh, and zoo that we need\nto integrate.  Now we can write\n</p><pre>enum Fun {FOO, BAR, UGH, ZOO};\n\ndouble call(enum Fun which, double what) {\n    switch (which) {\n        case FOO: return foo(what);\n        case BAR: return bar(what);\n        case UGH: return ugh(what);\n        case ZOO: return zoo(what);\n    }\n}\n\ndouble integral(enum Fun which, double lower, double upper, int n) {\n    // Compute the integral of a function from lower to upper \n    // using Simpson's rule with n+1 points.\n    double const h = (upper - lower) / n;\n    double       s;\n    double       t;\n    int          i;\n    \n    s = 0.0;\n    for (i = 0; i &lt; n; i++) s += call(which, (lower + h/2.0) + h*i);\n    t = 0.0;\n    for (i = 1; i &lt; n; i++) t += call(which, lower + h*i);\n    return (call(which, lower) + call(which, upper) + s*4.0 + t*2.0) * (h/6.0);\n}\n</pre><p>Has obeying NASA's rule made the code more reliable?  No, it has made\nthe code  to understand,  maintainable, and\n that it wasn't before.  Here's a call\nillustrating the mistake:\n</p><pre>x = integral(4, 0.0, 1.0, 10);</pre><p>I have checked this with two C compilers and a static checker at their\nhighest settings, and they are completely silent about this.\n\n</p><p>So there are legitimate uses for function pointers, and simulating\nthem makes programs , not better.\n\n</p><p>Now  in Fortran,\nAlgol 60, or Pascal.  Those languages had procedure \nbut not procedure . You could pass a subprogram name as\na parameter, and such a parameter could be passed on, but you could not\nstore them in variables.  You could have a  of C which\nallowed function pointer parameters, but made all function pointer\nvariables read-only.  That would give you a statically checkable subset\nof C that allowed integral().\n\n</p><p>The other use of function pointers is simulating object-orientation.\nImagine for example\n</p><pre>struct Channel {\n    void (*send)(struct Channel *, Message const *);\n    bool (*recv)(struct Channel *, Message *);\n    ...\n};\ninline void send(struct Channel *c, Message const *m) {\n    c-&gt;send(c, m);\n}\ninline bool recv(struct Channel *c, Message *m) {\n    return c-&gt;recv(c, m);\n}\n</pre><p>This lets us use a common interface for sending and receiving\nmessages on different kinds of channels.  This approach has been\nused extensively in operating systems (at least as far back as\nthe Burroughs MCP in the 1960s) to decouple the code that uses\na device from the actual device driver.     I would expect any\nprogram that controls more than one hardware device to do something\nlike this.  It's one of our key tools for controlling complexity.\n</p><p>Again, we can simulate this, but it makes adding a new kind of\nchannel harder than it should be, and the code is \nwhen we do it, not better.\n\n</p><p>The rule against more than one level of dereferencing is also\nan assault on good programming.  One of the key ideas that was\ndeveloped in the 1960s is the idea of ;\nthe idea that it should be possible for one module to define a\ndata type and operations on it and another module to use instances\nof that data type and its operations <em>without having to know\nanything about what the data type is</em>.\n</p><p>One of the things I detest about Java is that it spits in the\nface of the people who worked out that idea.  Yes, Java (now) has\ngeneric type parameters, and that's good, but you cannot use a\n type without knowing what that type is.\n\n</p><p>Suppose I have a module that offers operations\n</p><ul></ul><p>And suppose that I have two interfaces in mind.  One of them\nuses integers as tokens.\n</p><pre>// stasher.h, version 1.\ntypedef int token;\nextern token stash(item);\nextern item  recall(token);\nextern void  delete(token);\n</pre><p>Another uses pointers as tokens.\n</p><pre>// stasher.h, version 2.\ntypedef struct Hidden *token;\nextern  token stash(item);\nextern  item  recall(token);\nextern  void  delete(token);\n</pre><pre>void snoo(token *ans, item x, item y) {\n    if (better(x, y)) {\n\t*ans = stash(x);\n    } else {\n\t*ans = stash(y);\n    }\n}\n</pre><p>By the NASA rule, the function snoo() would not be accepted or rejected on\nits own merits.  With stasher.h, version 1, it would be accepted.\nWith stasher.h, version 2, it would be rejected.\n\n</p><p>One reason to prefer version 2 to version 1 is that version 2 gets\nmore use out of type checking.  There are ever so many ways to get an\nint in C.  Ask yourself if it ever makes sense to do\n</p><pre>token t1 = stash(x);\ntoken t2 = stash(y);\ndelete(t1*t2);\n</pre><p>I really do not like the idea of banning abstract data types.\n\n</p><h3>10.  All code must be compiled, from the first day of development,\nwith all compiler warnings enabled at the compiler‚Äôs\nmost pedantic setting.  All code must compile with these setting without\nany warnings.  All code must be checked daily with at least one, but\npreferably more than one, state-of-the-art static source code analyzer\nand should pass the analyses with zero warnings.</h3><p>This one is good advice.

Furthermore, the possibility of an error occurring in the pneumatic system or the buffer of the vision acquisition system collapsing, together with the always present possibility of a leak in the segments, made it advisable to take data in small sessions and subsequently union of all of them. Since the data collection process was automated, this did not pose much of a problem.</p><p>\\\nAlthough the possibility that the ambient temperature was a factor that influenced the kinematics of the robot was considered during the dataset collection process, it was finally proven that small variations in temperature did not affect the behaviour.</p><p>\\\nTable 3 shows the datasets that were taken, the total time necessary to obtain them and the average time per point. It should be taken into account that not all captured positions were finally used, since, if the camera did not correctly detect the positions of the three beacon spheres, it could not calculate the orientation of the trihedral and therefore returned an error code. Of the 1200 samples collected, 5% had to be discarded, leaving 1146 finally usable. The average time per point, considering all the datasets collected, was 6.76 s, with a standard deviation of 0.63 s. The low variability between capture processes proves the effectiveness of the automated method designed.</p><p>\\\nOnce all the datasets were combined, the direct and inverse kinematic models presented here were validated. The validation of the direct model consisted of sending the robot a combination of inflation times and measuring the distance between the position reached, captured by the cameras, and that predicted by the table. Repeating the experiment for 40 points, the histogram of results presented in Figure 15 was observed. The average error is 4.27 mm, the median error 2.72 mm, and the standard deviation 1.99 mm.</p><p>\\\nThe high standard deviation and the shape of the histogram, tilted towards low values and with a very long tail, seem to indicate the existence of points where the model presents notable failures along with others with very good results. A future line of interest could be the detailed analysis of the workspace to locate where those regions of lower precision of the model are located and try to look for failures, perhaps leading to a greater density of points in the dataset.</p><p>\\\nIn the same way, the inverse kinematic model was tested. To do this, PAUL was given a reference position and orientation to achieve, the necessary times were calculated, using the procedures referred to in Equations (16), and (17) inflation was carried out. Subsequently, the position captured with the cameras was compared with the desired one.</p><p>\\\nAs expected, the existence of redundancies, in which equal position values are achieved with very different combinations of inflation times, introduces large uncertainties in the model, which the triangulation presented is not able to capture.</p><p>\\\nSpecifically, the inverse kinematic model has an average error of 10.78 mm, a median error of 9.22 mm and a standard deviation of 5.98 mm. While these errors may seem high, they are compared in Table 4 with other open-loop controllers presented in the literature. It can be clearly seen that they are in line with the results obtained and that they are even better than those obtained by smaller robots, where one would expect, due to the smaller working space, a higher accuracy (at least in data-driven models).</p><p>\\\nIt is worth highlighting, however, two experiments in which PAUL performed very satisfactorily, because the area of operation was restricted to a region where no redundancies were found to exist. They are available in the video of Appendix A.</p><p>\\\nIn the first of them, the robot was forced to reach a set of points located on the horizontal basis plane, also forcing the lower end of the last segment to be parallel to said</p><p>\\\nplane. In all of them, errors less than 7 mm were achieved. Figure 16 shows the results of said experiment. With the aim of facilitating the understanding of the experiment, the beacon was changed for a laser pointer that points to the desired points, on which targets with a radius of 5 mm have been marked, allowing the accuracy achieved to be checked.</p><p>\\\nIn the second experiment, shown in Figure 17, points on the lower horizontal plane were also taken as reference, but without imposing that the lower face of the robot should remain parallel to it. In this case, accuracies of 2 cm were achieved.</p><p>\\\nAlthough the inverse kinematic model therefore presents acceptable results, it must be commented that, in all these experiments, due to the geometry and material of the robot, at the moment in which PAUL reaches the desired position, it tends to acquire a movement damped oscillation. An attempt has been made to reduce it, despite everything, it is a very intrinsic phenomenon to the robot that is difficult to solve. A future line proposed, in this sense, is to try to rigidify the robot by introducing negative pressures that generate vacuum.</p>","contentLength":5938,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Perplexity Deep Research","url":"https://www.perplexity.ai/hub/blog/introducing-perplexity-deep-research","date":1739650059,"author":"vinni2","guid":506,"unread":true,"content":"","contentLength":0,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43061827"},{"title":"Newly Curated 40+ Developer Fixes || Try it now :)","url":"https://dev.to/0x2e_tech/newly-curated-40-developer-fixes-try-it-now--14fe","date":1739649805,"author":"0x2e Tech","guid":555,"unread":true,"content":"<h3>\n  \n  \n  1.

A combination of these two factors gave me the idea that additional information on this topic might help other engineers who are employed by companies that do not have it to build a strategy that will allow them to get to the next level.</p><p>\\\nIn almost any more or less mature IT company, a common career track for a software engineer is linear and looks almost the same:</p><p>Associate Software Engineer is optional and may or may not be presented in the common IT department structure for a very simple reason: it‚Äôs net-negative for the first 12 months as it requires a lot of hand-holding so not all companies have resources and time to allow such positions in their structure.</p><p>\\\nThe further career track will depend on your inclinations, what you enjoy doing, and whether you are ready for the shift in the way you‚Äôre working.</p><p>There‚Äôs nothing wrong with staying a senior software engineer if you like to allocate the majority of your time to coding. However, if you feel the need to empower others and lead that‚Äôs the right moment to weigh all expectations for each role, your strengths, the things that drive you, and pick the most suitable track for yourself.</p><p>\\\nDespite the visual simplicity of the tracks above, it‚Äôs not clear how to get closer to the right end. The following insights will apply to the companies that have:</p><ul><li><p>a hierarchical structure where each employer has a line manager</p></li><li><p>a genuine interest in employee development</p><p>\\n Why is the above-mentioned is important?==The answer is quite simple: from day one you have an ally - your line manager==.</p></li></ul><p>\\\nEach line manager‚Äôs efficiency is based on the output of each person reporting to them: the faster you grow - the bigger your output - the better the line manager‚Äôs efficiency. Given all this, sooner or later, after you have joined your company, your line manager will approach you with the question: ‚ÄúWhere do you see yourself after a certain time?‚Äù If it is not happening and you have regular one-to-ones, feel free to add this as a topic for discussion in the agenda.</p><p>\\\nVoicing your intentions and setting a goal is just the first step of your way. The next step is to gather the list of requirements for the higher role and compile a list of achievements that can serve as evidence of your qualifications that you can use as a guide that you should follow to get from point A to point B. In companies with transparent promotion processes, this should be already in place.</p><p>\\\nIf this is not the case, you and your manager could compose one. Remember that this process is beneficial for both sides: you are getting an agreement that after certain achievements, you will be praised with the promotion and your line manager can get increased output from the team, so it‚Äôs a win-win case.</p><p>\\\nDifferent companies may have different requirements for certain positions, and I won‚Äôt claim that the ones below are universal and will suit everyone. The main purpose is to give you an idea it might look like if you need one that can be further tailored to your needs.</p><p>\\n Guidelines for evidence can be used as a roadmap that brings you to the desired destination. The next steps for the common track might be</p><ul><li>Check the team‚Äôs roadmap for suitable projects or change requests that might fit the purpose of the evidence.</li></ul><ul><li>Voice up your intentions to the line manager so they can assist with the suitable project allocation and provide information about its priority, business value, and when it can be picked up for development.</li></ul><ul><li>Spot any potential areas for improvement in code, observability, extensibility, and security perspectives and raise them as ownership tickets.</li></ul><ul><li><p>Familiarize yourself with the current recruitment process in your company and ask for shadowing during recruitment sessions. Ask to switch roles where someone more senior will shadow you and ask for feedback. \\n </p><p>This is a short list of the roles that will be covered from requirements/guidelines for evidence perspectives:</p></li><li><p>Junior Software Engineer Requirements</p></li><li><p>Software Engineer Requirements</p></li><li><p>Senior Software Engineer Requirements</p></li><li><p>Lead Engineer Requirements</p></li><li><p>Senior Engineering Lead Requirements</p></li></ul><h4><strong>==Junior Software Engineer Requirements==</strong></h4><p>|  |  |  |\n|----|----|----|\n|  | Delivers tasks \\n ¬∑ Clear requirements are needed (business and system) \\n ¬∑ Designs/implements limited-scope technical solutions \\n ¬∑ Limited guidance is required | 1.

These attack campaigns were highly targeted and carried out in a variety of ways. The majority of these attacks originated via spear-phishing emails with different themes. In one case, the eventual breach began with highly tailored outreach via Signal.</p><p>Through its investigations, Volexity discovered that Russian threat actors were impersonating a variety of individuals in order to socially engineer targets, including impersonating individuals from the following:</p><ul><li>United States Department of State</li><li>Ukrainian Ministry of Defence</li><li>European Union Parliament</li><li>Prominent research institutions</li></ul><p>Communications carried a variety of different themes and messages, but they all ultimately resulted in the attacker inviting the targeted user to one of the following:</p><ul><li>Microsoft Teams Meeting / Video Conference</li><li>Access to applications and data as an external M365 user</li><li>Join a chatroom on a secure chat application</li></ul><p>When these attacks were successful and the attackers gained access to accounts, the post-exploitation phase often had unique characteristics in each case:</p><ul><li>The way the attackers accessed material from compromised organizations (scripts versus native applications)</li><li>The infrastructure used to access stolen accounts</li></ul><p>Despite the differences, Volexity found the attacks had one thing in common: they were all <strong>Device Code Authentication</strong> attacks. While this attack method is not new, it is one that is definitely lesser known and not commonly leveraged by nation-state actors. Details on the social-engineering and spear-phishing campaigns, along with how Device Code Authentication attacks work, will be covered further in this blog post. What Volexity has observed is that this method has been more effective at successfully compromising accounts than most other targeted spear-phishing campaigns.</p><p>Volexity assesses with high confidence that the series of attacks described in this blog post are from Russia-based threat actors. At this time, Volexity is tracking this activity under three different threat actors and assesses with medium confidence that at least one of them is  (overlapping with DarkHalo, APT29, Midnight Blizzard, CozyDuke). Volexity is tracking the remaining activity under  and . It is possible that all the activity described in this blog post is a single threat actor, but despite the similar targeting, timing, and attack method, other observed components of the operations are different enough to be tracked separately, for now.</p><h3>From Secure Chat to Insecure Authentication</h3><p>The discovery of this threat activity started toward the end of January 2025, when Volexity uncovered a highly targeted attack that had successfully compromised the M365 account of one of its customers. This breach was discovered after Volexity identified suspicious sign-in activity to the account, which was followed by a rapid download of files from the user's OneDrive. All authentication and download events came from virtual private server (VPS) and Tor IP addresses, which is not the most subtle way to access an account. Volexity noted this activity was likely scripted, as the User-Agent string for later access and file downloads was the Python User-Agent string .</p><p>Volexity then performed a detailed investigation into this incident, in an effort to identify how the account was compromised. A review of login activity showed the legitimate user had logged in and approved a multi-factor authentication (MFA) request. However, subsequent access was not from the legitimate user's IP address. This caused Volexity to initially suspect a phishing attack involving an adversary-in-the-middle (AiTM) framework. As a result, Volexity reviewed emails to the user leading up the time of the authentication event. This review identified a suspicious email just moments before the login activity from an email address purporting to be from someone with the name of a high-ranking official from the Ukrainian Ministry of Defence. The email was structured to look like a meeting invite for a chatroom on the messaging application, <a href=\"https://element.io/\">Element</a>. Element is another encrypted messaging application that offers the ability for users to self-host a server with functionality that includes group video chats. The ‚Äúinvitation‚Äù email sent is shown below .</p><p>Microsoft <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity-platform/v2-oauth2-device-code\">describes</a> the purpose of this workflow as allowing <em>'\"users to sign in to input-constrained devices such as a smart TV, IoT device, or a printer.</em>‚Äù However, in this case, it means if an attacker can convince a user to enter a specific code into this dialogue (and log in), they are granted long-term access to the user‚Äôs account.</p><p>After working with its customer more closely, Volexity learned that the victim had been contacted on Signal by an individual purporting to be from the Ukrainian Ministry of Defence. This individual then requested the victim move off Signal to another secure chat application called Element. The attacker then had the victim join an Element server they controlled under the domain . This allowed the attacker to further communicate with the victim in real time and inform them they needed to click a link from an email to join a secure chat room. This is where the email Volexity had discovered came into play. The message was a ploy to fool the user into thinking they were being invited into a secure chat, when in reality they were giving the attacker access to their account. The generated Device Codes are only valid for 15 minutes once they are created. As a result, the real-time communication with the victim, and having them expect the \"invitation\", served to ensure the phish would succeed through timely coordination.</p><p>The diagram below s</p><p>Volexity tracks the threat actor behind this campaign as . Through research conducted on the custom domain used by UTA0304 to operate its own Element server, Volexity was able to pivot and discover additional infrastructure it believes is likely operated by the group. The table below represents the list of infrastructure that Volexity has tied to this threat actor.</p><table><thead><tr></tr></thead><tbody><tr></tr><tr></tr><tr><td width=\"246\"><code>chromeelevationservice[.]com</code></td></tr><tr></tr></tbody></table><h3>Spoofing the United States Department of State</h3><p>In early February 2025, Volexity observed multiple spear-phishing campaigns targeting users with fake Microsoft invitations purporting to be from the United States (US) Department of State. These emails were themed as invitations to join the US Department of State‚Äôs Microsoft tenant as an external user, or as invitations to a Microsoft Teams chat named ‚Äú<em><strong>Measuring Influence Operations</strong>\".</em></p><p>Similar to the campaign conducted by UTA0304, these fake US Department of State emails were targeting users with a <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity-platform/v2-oauth2-device-code\">Device Code OAuth</a> phishing workflow. Each email was aimed at convincing the user to accept the invitation and enter a unique code provided in the phishing email. The link in the invitations would direct users to the Microsoft Device Code <a href=\"https://login.microsoftonline.com/common/oauth2/deviceauth\">authentication page</a>. If the user entered the code provided in the phishing email, the authentication page would subsequently authorize the threat actor to access to the user‚Äôs account. However, it is worth noting that this campaign was sent out of the blue, with no precursor or build up to the emails, so users would not be expecting these messages. Even if they were to fall for the campaign, they would have to have done it within 15 minutes of receiving the email. This dramatically decreased the likelihood that this attack would be successful.</p><p>After reviewing various parts of the attack, Volexity assesses with medium confidence that the Russian threat actor CozyLarch (aka APT29 or Midnight Blizzard) was behind these US Department of State themed spear-phishing campaigns. Additional details on each campaign are described in the sections that follow.</p><h4>Campaign 1: M365 Tenant External User Invitation</h4><p>CozyLarch sent invitations to several users, inviting them to access applications within the M365 tenant for the US Department of State. The invitation email was designed to look like a real invitation that would be sent from Microsoft, as shown below.</p><p>The redirect link takes the user to the Microsoft Device Code OAuth workflow, and it is the same URL that UTA0304 directly embedded in their phishing campaign. However, unlike UTA0304, CozyLarch opted to use the redirect URL rather than the final login URL, perhaps because it may look even more recognizable to a discerning user, given that it is hosted on the main Microsoft domain. If the user entered the code provided from the email and continued through the authentication process, the attacker was granted access to the user‚Äôs M365 account.</p><h4>Campaign 2: M365 Teams Chat Invitation</h4><p>CozyLarch launched a second campaign, in which they targeted users with a fake invitation to join a Microsoft Teams chat named ‚Äú<strong><em>Measuring Influence Operations</em></strong>‚Äù. The email made it appear as though there were already 37 other members in the chat. &nbsp;A screenshot of one of the observed spear-phishing messages is shown below.</p><p>The ‚ÄúSign in to Microsoft Teams‚Äù button in the email body is a hyperlink that leads to the same <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/devicelogin\">https://www.microsoft.com/devicelogin</a> URL observed in the other campaign. The attack flow and end goal are the same, with only a small difference in the theme of the emails.</p><p>The emails are designed to appear as though they come from Microsoft. The messages used mixed encoding in the ‚Äúfriendly‚Äù name that make the address difficult to discern. An example of the full ‚Äúfrom‚Äù header used in one phishing email is given below:</p><blockquote><p><code>\\\"Mic\\udb40\\udc30\\udb40\\udc30\\udb40\\udc30\\u200br\\udb40\\udc30\\udb40\\udc30o\\udb40\\udc30\\udb40\\udc30soft Invitations on behal f of US Dep\\udb40\\udc30\\udb40\\udc30\\udb40\\udc30artme\\udb40\\udc30\\udb40\\udc30\\udb40\\udc30nt of St\\udb40\\udc30\\udb40\\udc30\\udb40\\udc30 ate \\uff1cinvites\\uff20mic\\udb40\\udc30\\udb40\\udc30\\udb40\\udc30\\u200br\\udb40\\udc30\\udb40\\udc30o\\udb40\\udc30\\udb40\\udc30soft.co m\\uff1e\\u180e\\u3000\\u180e\\u3000\\u180e \\u180e\\u3000\\u180e\\u3000\\u180e\\u3000\\u180e\\u3000\\u180e\\u3000\\u180e\\u3000 \\u180e\\u3000\\u180e\\u3000\\u180e\\u3000\\u180e\\u3000\\u180e\\u3000\\u180e\\u3000\\u180e\\u3000\\u180e\\u3000\\u180e\\u3000\\u180e\\u3000 \\u180e \\u180e\\u3000\\u180e \\u180e\\u3000\\u180e\\u3000\\u180e\\u3000\\u180e\\u3000\\u180e\\u3000\\u180e\\u3000\\u180e \\u3000\\u180e\\u3000\\u180e\\u3000\\u180e\\u3000\\u180e\\u3000\\u180e\\u3000\\u180e\\u3000\\u180e\\u3000\\u180e\\u3000\\u180e\\u3000\\u180e&nbsp; \\u180e\\u3000\\u180e\\u3000\\u180e\\u3000\\u180e\\u3000\\u180e\\u3000\\u180e\\u3000\\u180e\\u3000\\u180e\\u3000\\u180e\\u3000 \\u180e\\u3000\\u180e\\u3000\\u180e\\u3000\\u180e\\u3000\\u180e\\u3000\\u180e\\u3000\\u180e\\u3000\\u180e\\u3000\\u180e\\u3000\\u180e\\u3000 \\u180e\\u3000\\u180e\\u3000\\u180e\\u3000\\u180e\\u3000\\u180e\\u3000\\u180e\\u3000\\u180e\\u3000\\u180e\\u3000\\u180e\\u3000\\u180e\\u3000 \\u180e\\u3000\\u180e\\u3000\\u180e\\u3000\\u180e\\u3000\\u180e\\u3000\\u180e\\u3000\\u180e\\u3000\\u180e\\u3000\\u180e\\u3000\\u180e\\u3000 \\u180e\\u3000\\u180e\\u3000\\u180e\\u3000\\u180e\\u3000\\u180e\\u3000\\u180e\\u3000\\u180e\\u3000\\u180e\\u3000\\u180e\\u3000\\u180e\\u3000 \\u180e\\u3000\\u180e\\u3000\\u180e\\u3000\\u180e\\u3000\\u180e\\u3000\\u180e\\u3000\\u180e\\u3000\\u180e\\u3000\\u180e\\u3000\\u180e\\u3000 \\u180e\\u3000\\u180e\\u3000\\u180e\\u3000\\u180e\\u3000\\u180e\\u3000\\u180e\\u3000\\u180e\\u3000\\u180e\\u3000\\u180e\\u3000\\u180e\\u3000 \\u180e\\u3000\\u180e\\u3000\\u180e \\u061c Cc:\\\" &lt;<a href=\"https://www.volexity.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection\" data-cfemail=\"12617a777b7e7f73757c77666652757f737b7e3c717d7f\">[email&nbsp;protected]</a>&gt;</code></p></blockquote><p>The attacker attempted to make it appear as if the emails were from , and also set the  header as . However, the true address could be seen at the end of the  field; all messages were sent via Google Gmail accounts. Volexity observed the following Gmail accounts as the actual senders of the messages observed:</p><ul><li><code>kaylassammers@gmail[.]com</code></li><li><code>kendisggibson@gmail[.]com</code></li><li><code>leslytthomson@gmail[.]com</code></li></ul><p>These addresses are believed to be controlled by CozyLarch and can be used to reliably detect phishing emails that may have been sent.</p><h4>Using Wireless Proxy Networks for Email Distribution</h4><p>Volexity also noted that the sending IP address associated with each spear-phishing email was recorded in the headers. Looking at the  header in the messages, it became apparent that the attacker was using Proxy IP addresses based in the US to send messages. Volexity observed nearly a dozen IP addresses belonging to mobile networks in the US (AT&amp;T and Verizon Wireless).</p><h3>European Parliament and Donald Trump</h3><p>Starting in late January through to the publication of this blog (February 13, 2025), Volexity has observed another campaign by a Russian threat actor it tracks as  targeting numerous organizations. UTA0307 created a fake email under the identity of a member of the European Parliament who is on the Committee on Foreign Affairs. The threat actor reached out to numerous individuals with personalized emails requesting a Microsoft Teams meeting to discuss Donald Trump and his impact on relations between the US and the European Union. Volexity also observed a smaller set of campaigns centered on discussing China's foreign policy and China-European Union relations.</p><p>The email subject lines used in these various campaigns are listed below:</p><ul><li><em>Discussion on Eastern Europe and the Caucasus</em></li><li><em>Discussion about Donald Trump's new term</em></li><li><em>Discussion about Trump &amp; US relations with Europe</em></li><li><em>Collaboration on China and East Asia Research</em></li></ul><p>The image below shows an example spear phish that was sent by UTA0307.</p><p>None of the initial emails contained any malicious content or links at the onset. The threat actor was leveraging a tactic that has become commonplace for numerous nation-state actors, where they wait until a conversation has started prior to sending anything malicious. This serves the purpose of knowing they have an engaged target, and that the target's guard is potentially down. In the specific cases of Device Code Authentication phishing, it is especially important to have a responsive target, as the threat actor has only 15 minutes to convince the target to enter the code that has been generated.</p><h4>A Different Device Code OAuth Phishing Technique</h4><p>Volexity actually discovered the operations of UTA0307 following a successful compromise. Similar to the initial discovery of UTA0304, Volexity worked backwards from detecting a breach to identifying the above spear-phishing emails. In this case, the victim had engaged from the initial email and had several messages back and forth with UTA0307 regarding a meeting being set up. They agreed to join a Microsoft Teams meeting, and a fake invitation email was sent. However, this time the link in the email did not go to Microsoft. The target received an email with the subject \"\", and the body of the email, shown below, was designed to look like a real invitation.</p><p>The ‚ÄúJoin the meeting now‚Äù hyperlink, however, linked to a website controlled by UTA0307 (). This page in turn was set up to automatically generate a new Microsoft Device Code each time it was visited. The website was designed to appear as an official Microsoft interstitial page before the user can join a Microsoft Teams meeting. The message that appears on the landing page (shown below) claims that the victim needs to pass a security check by copying a code and entering it on a subsequent page</p><p>When the user clicks the ‚ÄúNext‚Äù button, a new tab is opened with the real Microsoft Device Code Authentication interface that requests an authentication code. If the victim enters the code supplied by the phishing page, they grant UTA0307 access to their M365 account. Interestingly, in the background of the initial phishing page, Volexity noted that the website would continuously poll the domain . It appears this domain was set up to monitor successful Device Code Authentication and, if detected, would redirect the user to a real Microsoft Teams meeting URL in an effort to make the activity appear legitimate.</p><p>The threat actor never joined this Microsoft Teams meeting. However, UTA0307 did add authorization for an authentication application under their control to enable multi-factor authentication when logging into the compromised account. Volexity assesses with medium confidence that this was a requirement of logging into the account, even with the stolen authentication token.</p><p>One benefit of this attack workflow versus other previously observed DeviceID phishing workflows is that, when a DeviceID code is generated, it is only valid for 15 minutes. Having an interstitial page that automatically generates new codes means UTA0307 does not have to worry about their phishing content expiring.</p><h4>UTA0307 Post-compromise Activities, Targeting and Attribution</h4><p>Volexity observed UTA0307 exfiltrating documents from a compromised M365 account that would be of interest to a Russian threat actor. This was determined based on identification of <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/purview/audit-log-activities\">FileDownloaded operations</a> observed in M365 audit log data. Given this information about the threat actor‚Äôs objectives, their targeting, and their use of a highly similar technique to that used in recent days and weeks by CozyLarch and UTA0304, Volexity assesses with medium confidence that UTA0307 is also a Russian threat actor.</p><p>However, the exact implementation of the DeviceID OAuth phishing technique used in this activity differs slightly from those previously documented by Volexity, which provides some evidence that this activity may have been conducted by a separate threat actor. For example, while the previously observed phishing campaigns saw the attacker use the client ID for Microsoft Office when handling Device Code Authentication, this activity instead used the client ID for Microsoft Teams, as shown below (note that Microsoft uses  and  interchangeably in their logs when referring to the ID for an application):</p><blockquote><p><code>\"appDisplayName\": \"Microsoft Teams\",</code></p><p><code>\"appId\": \"1fec8e78-bce4-4aaf-ab1b-5451cc387264\",</code></p></blockquote><p>Another difference between this and the UTA0304 campaign is that in this case, all subsequent access to the compromised account occurred via Mullad VPN exit nodes (versus the other observed VPS and Tor IP addresses). Based on these two factors, Volexity has chosen to track this activity under the UTA0307 alias, rather than CozyLarch or UTA0304.</p><h3>Detecting Device Code Authentication</h3><p>Volexity identified a way to reliably detect this attack through monitoring and analysis of Microsoft Entra ID sign-in logs. When a user enters a device code and subsequently authenticates, it results in a login to the application associated with the generated code. This can be a common application like Microsoft Office that is frequently accessed by users and would not be a reliable indicator. However, the good news is that Device Code Authentications result in the  field being set with the value .</p><p>The line below is what will appear in the JSON data in the Entra ID sign-in logs when a Device Code Authentication occurs:</p><blockquote><p><code>‚ÄúauthenticationProtocol\": \"deviceCode\",</code></p></blockquote><p>Volexity further noted that as authenticated sessions refresh and are kept alive, subsequent sign-ins that initially occurred via a  often do not have anything set for  but they contain the following entry:</p><blockquote><p><code> ‚ÄúoriginalTransferMethod\": \"deviceCodeFlow\",</code></p></blockquote><p>These values can be searched and filtered on in the Entra Admin center by adding filters for \"Authentications Protocol\" and \"Original Transfer Method\". The latter can be filtered in both  and  sign-ins. The frequency and legitimacy of these values occurring in the sign-in logs for a particular organization may vary, as this is a legitimate Microsoft feature. An organization can evaluate their risk and usage of these workflows, and potentially use this information as a proactive detection mechanism.</p><p>If an organization has the ability to monitor URLs that are being accessed by users or sent in email, there are additional detection opportunities to discover Device Code Authentication attacks. The following official URLs can be monitored for as related to Microsoft Device Code Authentication:</p><ul><li><code>https://login.microsoftonline.com/common/oauth2/deviceauth</code></li><li><code>https://www.microsoft.com/devicelogin</code></li><li><code>https://aka.ms/devicelogin</code></li></ul><p>Organizations can monitor for access to these URLs or for their presence in various communication methods, such as email. Attackers can find other means to redirect users to these URLs, but one of the main advantages of using the list above in phishing attacks is that the URL displayed is hosted on a legitimate Microsoft domain.</p><h3>Preventing Device Code Authentication</h3><p>Volexity believes the most effective way to prevent this potential attack vector is through conditional access policies on an organization's M365 tenant. It is possible for organizations to create a conditional access policy that disallows device code authentication altogether. It is fairly trivial to set up, and Microsoft provides <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/conditional-access/policy-block-authentication-flows\">online guidance on exactly how to do this</a>. Based on Volexity's own testing, blocking the \"Device code flow\" from \"Authentications flows\" prevents this attack from working.&nbsp; The image below shows what a conditional access policy would look like once it's set up and in place to block this authentication flow.</p><p>Prior to implementing such a policy, organizations should evaluate the use of Device Code Authentication in their environment. This feature is used legitimately, and blocking it could have a negative impact. Volexity's review of its own customers identified several instances of legitimate access to resources via these means. However, at the majority of Volexity's customers, there was either no recent Device Code Authentication activity or there was only activity tied to the attacks described in this blog post.</p><p>Volexity continues to track multiple spear-phishing campaigns targeting Device Code Authentication. This blog post serves to cover a few of the larger and unique campaigns observed. Volexity has observed other similar spear-phishing campaigns in recent weeks targeting Device Code Authentication that it believes are the work of Russian threat actors. Further, it should be noted that it is possible this is the work of a single threat actor running multiple, different campaigns. However, at this time, Volexity believes this activity is sufficiently different enough to warrant tracking this activity under two different unknown threat actors and one it believes is likely CozyLarch.</p><p>While Device Code Authentication attacks are not new, they appear to have been rarely leveraged by nation-state threat actors . Volexity's visibility into targeted attacks indicates this particular method has been far more effective than the combined effort of years of other social-engineering and spear-phishing attacks conducted by the same (or similar) threat actors. It appears that these Russian threat actors have made a concerted effort to launch several campaigns against organizations with a goal of simultaneously abusing this method before the targets catch on and implement countermeasures.</p><p>The detection mechanisms and countermeasures to these attacks have been available for years. However, Volexity believes they are seldom implemented and that most organizations are not even aware of this authentication flow, let alone the means to detect its misuse. These attacks serve as a reminder that threat actors will constantly look for ways to abuse legitimate features, and organizations must continually evaluate and implement methods to detect and prevent such attacks.</p><p>These attacks also serve as a good opportunity to engage with users and remind them to be on the lookout for anything out of the ordinary when it comes to accessing resources when they are asked for login credentials or authorization grants. This phishing workflow has proven useful for an attacker, as many traditional sources of evidence and detection, both for a user and network defenders, are not present. For example:</p><ol><li>There is no ‚Äúmalicious‚Äù link or attachment. The only link is to the provider‚Äôs infrastructure (in this case, Microsoft). This means users cannot easily identify the link as being suspicious, and automated solutions detecting malicious emails will likely fail to do so for the same reason.</li><li>Users are generally less aware of attacks that leverage legitimate services, and may be even less aware when it comes to those that involve entering a device code rather than their username or password.</li><li>After successful authentication, the logs will show the authenticating application as a legitimate or benign application, reducing signal that can be keyed off of in sign-in logs by detection teams.</li></ol><p>These are items that organizations should look to further train users on and implement technical countermeasures against where possible.</p><p><a href=\"https://github.com/volexity/threat-intel/blob/main/2025/2025-02-13%20Device%20Code%20Phishing/iocs.csv\">Volexity GitHub</a>.</p><p><em>If you believe you have been targeted by a similar attack and want to share details with Volexity for informational purposes, additional investigation, or incident response, please <a href=\"https://www.volexity.com/company/contact/\">contact us</a>.</em></p>","contentLength":25345,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43061173"},{"title":"xAI‚Äôs ‚ÄúColossus‚Äù supercomputer raises health questions in Memphis","url":"https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/15/xais-colossus-supercomputer-raises-health-questions-in-memphis/","date":1739645584,"author":"Connie Loizos","guid":53,"unread":true,"content":"<p>Elon Musk‚Äôs AI startup xAI plans to continue using 15 gas turbines to power its ‚ÄúColossus‚Äù supercomputer in Memphis, Tennessee, according to an operating permit with the Shelby County Health Department for non-stop turbine use from June 2025 to June 2030.

However, the struggle is doubled when you work nights. Thankfully, there are a few techniques that can help you survive and thrive in your field, even when working those late hours.</p><h2>The Challenges of Long Hours in the Evening</h2><p>The regular nine-to-five shift is the norm across many industries, especially in the corporate world. However, there are a few outliers, such as the hospitality and manufacturing sectors. Health care, security, and firefighting departments also need hands on deck at all times in emergencies, which requires plenty of alertness.</p><p>\\\nThere are several benefits, like less competition between workers and extra pay. However, it takes some work to get used to it as you have to adjust your body clock. The night shift can <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/nov/18/us-workers-night-shift-takes-toll\">spark plenty of employee turnover</a> since most people can‚Äôt sacrifice their daytime hours.</p><p>\\\nThose who decide to take on the night shift find themselves at a crossroads. The hours may seem much longer despite being the same eight hours that workers typically work. It can be hard to keep energy levels up or stay awake.</p><h2><strong>Most Effective Night Shift Tips</strong></h2><p>Dealing with a night shift schedule requires several adjustments, including your sleep schedule, caffeine intake, physical activities and so much more. Here are tried-and-true strategies to help you out.</p><h3><strong>Have a Routine Before the Shift</strong></h3><p>Good sleep should be the highest priority in your pre-work routine. It‚Äôs much easier to stay alert and concentrate on your tasks on the job when you‚Äôve had enough shut-eye. Unfortunately, <a href=\"https://www.trustaff.com/blog/tips-for-surviving-night-shift\">over one-third of Americans</a> sleep less than seven hours. Heading to bed in the middle of the day can also seem foreign to your body.</p><p>\\\nThus, the first step is to have a consistent schedule. For example, people in health care may have to start their eight hours of work at 7 p.m. or so. Others might deal with extended hours, bringing the total closer to 12.</p><p>\\\nThus, the ideal night-shift nurse sleep schedule will start at 9 a.m. if you want to achieve eight hours and an extra two hours to prep and commute. The leeway can also be used as additional time to sleep ahead of those longer work times.</p><p>\\\nIf it‚Äôs your first time heading into the shift, give your body a week to gradually acclimate to the new sleep schedule. Complete and total sleep deprivation can be too exhausting for your body.</p><p>\\\nBe mindful of your sleeping quarters during the adjustment period. Blackout curtains are ideal for completely darkening the room and tricking your body into thinking it‚Äôs nighttime. You should put your phone in silent mode to avoid calls that may disrupt your sleep.</p><p>\\\nYou can also experiment with other sleeping aids. For example, some people find aromatherapy relaxing, easing them into slumber during the daytime. White noise machines can also provide the best background sound as you fall asleep.</p><p>\\\nAfter a long sleep, you should feel recharged. Awaken your senses by preparing a well-balanced dinner before your shift, and incorporate fruits and vegetables into your meals to get your nutrition fix. Afterward, wear your clothing of choice and head out to conquer the night shift.</p><h3>Design a Post-Work Ritual</h3><p>Now that you know how to prepare for a 12-hour night shift, it‚Äôs time to move on to winding down. Ideally, the routine gives you something to look forward to, such as having a shower to feel clean. You can also move your skincare routine to this time.</p><p>\\\nTry to give yourself a bit of leisure after work. Some use this time to watch shows, listen to music, or play video games. Social media is also a good outlet for entertainment. Just remember to use it in moderation to avoid doomscrolling.</p><h3><strong>Exercise Caution Around Caffeine</strong></h3><p>Caffeine is a helpful tool to keep your energy levels as high as possible. A cup of your favorite coffee or tea just before work can help you energize throughout the day. However, it‚Äôs best to avoid the temptation of getting a second or third drink in the middle of the shift. Too much caffeine will result in quite a crash afterward.</p><p>\\\nIt‚Äôs also best to schedule your intake. Prolonged caffeine ingestion <a href=\"https://academic.oup.com/sleepadvances/article/4/1/zpad014/7040153\">can disrupt the circadian rhythm</a>, disrupting your sleep routine. Meanwhile, short exposure boosts sleep fragmentation, increasing your awakenings while sleeping and ruining the quality of your shut-eye. Once a week is a good rule of thumb to follow.</p><p>One thing most people forget to realize when moving into the night shift is that everyone else still maintains their day routines. Your family and friends will likely have lunch, run errands, and do their own jobs when you‚Äôre asleep. When you‚Äôre awake and working, they‚Äôll likely be sleeping.</p><p>\\\nHuman interaction is essential to enduring the night shift. Try to find overlaps and make time to catch up. You can invite a friend over for dinner before you head to work or chat on the phone while you‚Äôre home.</p><p>\\\nYou can also turn to your fellow employees going through the night shift. Camaraderie helps to overcome a challenge. Get to know these people, and build strong working relationships. The bond can even help you increase energy levels and boost productivity.</p><h3><strong>Maintain Physical Activity</strong></h3><p>Night shift workers have limited time and energy. However, it‚Äôs still important to maintain some form of physical movement. Exercise <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s42003-024-05962-8\">may lessen the likelihood of disorders</a> like depression, cardiovascular conditions, and metabolic diseases in chronic shift workers.</p><p>\\\nTry to find breaks to just take a walk. Aside from getting fresh air, you can move your muscles and wake yourself up. If you‚Äôre already a veteran for the evening hours, you may even consider heading to the gym right after work.</p><h3><strong>Move Your Responsibilities</strong></h3><p>Keeping productivity levels high throughout the shift can take time and practice. However, one hack you can try is intentionally scheduling the most important responsibilities at the beginning of your shift. After all, you will likely have more energy at the start.</p><p>\\\nOnce you‚Äôve completed the bulk of the most important work, the next goal is to stretch out your energy throughout the rest of the hours and stay awake. You can try to space out your duties and give yourself breaks when you‚Äôre faltering.</p><h3><strong>Keep the Same Schedule on Off Days</strong></h3><p>It's important to maintain your current schedule to get your body used to the night shift. This solution is best for working full time, allowing you to fully adjust your body clock and move your most productive times to match your work schedule.</p><p>\\\nIf you have obligations during your off days that need to be done during the daytime, try to reschedule. You can also proceed and readjust afterward with some intentionally planned naps. Minimize deviating and the changes in your productivity should follow suit.</p><h3><strong>Manage Your Mindset and Stress</strong></h3><p>Night shift workers can experience stress throughout the adjustment period. Unfortunately, this pressure <a href=\"https://www.health.harvard.edu/topics/stress\">can alter the immune system</a> and make you more vulnerable to illnesses. It can also build a negative mindset toward your schedule.</p><p>\\\nMake sure to have stress management techniques under your belt. Meditation is a good way to come to terms with your thoughts, while breathing exercises can assist you in calming down systemic turmoil. Activities like journaling and yoga can also improve your mood.</p><h2><strong>Thrive With an Unconventional Schedule</strong></h2><p>Having a night shift schedule is a challenge worth conquering. You get to be present for the people who need aid and assistance, and it brings fulfillment to your long-term career development. You just have to adapt to the circumstances to reap the rewards.</p>","contentLength":7590,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Perplexity launches its own freemium ‚Äòdeep research‚Äô product","url":"https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/15/perplexity-launches-its-own-freemium-deep-research-product/","date":1739644754,"author":"Anthony Ha","guid":52,"unread":true,"content":"<p>Perplexity has become the latest AI company to release an in-depth research tool, with a new feature announced Friday.

Magnus Carlsen Wants to Remake the Game","url":"https://games.slashdot.org/story/25/02/15/053254/bored-with-chess-magnus-carlsen-wants-to-remake-the-game?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&utm_medium=feed","date":1739644440,"author":"EditorDavid","guid":187,"unread":true,"content":"\"Magnus Carlsen, the world's top chess player, is bored of chess,\" the Washington Post wrote Friday:\n\nCarlsen has spent much of the past year appearing to dismiss the game he has mastered: It was no longer exciting to play, he told a podcast in March. In December, he withdrew from defending a world championship because he was penalized for wearing jeans to the tournament. \nHow would the world's best player spice up the game? Change the rules, and add a touch of reality TV. \n\nTen of the world's top players gathered in a German villa on the Baltic coast this week to play in the first tournament of a new chess circuit, the Freestyle Chess Grand Slam Tour, that Carlsen co-founded. The twist: The tour randomizes the starting positions of the chess board's most important pieces, so each game begins with the queen, rooks and knights in a jumble. [It's sometimes called \"Chess960\" or Fischer random chess ‚Äî with both players starting with the same arrangement of pieces.] Players have to adapt on the fly. Carlsen is backed by a cadre of investors who see a chance to dramatize chess with the theatrics of a television show. Players wear heart-rate monitors and give confession-booth interviews mid-match where they strategize and fret to the audience. Some purists are skeptical. So is the International Chess Federation, which sent a barrage of legal threats to Freestyle Chess before it launched this week's event. \nAt stake is a lucrative global market of hundreds of millions of chess players that has only continued to grow since the coronavirus pandemic launched a startling chess renaissance ‚Äî and, perhaps, the authority to decide if and how a centuries-old game should evolve... The format is an antidote to the classical game, where patterns and strategies have been so rigorously studied that it's hard to innovate, Carlsen said. \"It's still possible to get a [competitive] game, but you have to sort of dig deeper and deeper,\" Carlsen said. \"I just find that there's too little scope for creativity.\" \n\nThe article also includes this quote from American grand master Hikaru Nakamura who runs a chess YouTube channel with 2.7 million subscribers). \"An integral part of regular chess is that when you play, you spend hours preparing your opening strategy before the game. But with Fischer Random ... it's a little bit looser and more enjoyable.\" And German entrepreneur Jan Henric Buettner (one of the investors) says they hope to bring the drama of Formula One racecars. (\"Cameras mounted at table level peer up at each player during games,\" the article notes at one point.) \n\nThe first Freestyle Chess Grand Slam Tour (with a $750,000 prize pool) concluded Friday, according to the article, but \"Carlsen did not play in it,\" the Post points out. \"He was upset in the semifinals by German grand master Vincent Keymer.\" Carlsen's reaction? \"I definitely find Freestyle harder.\" \n\nBut Chess.com reports that Carlsen will be back to playing regular chess very soon:\n\nGlobal esports powerhouse Team Liquid has announced the signings of not just one, but two superstars of chess. Five-time World Champion and world number-one Magnus Carlsen and the 2018 challenger, world number-two Fabiano Caruana will represent the club ahead of the 2025 Esports World Cup (EWC)... Carlsen and Caruana, fresh from competing in the Weissenhaus Freestyle Chess Grand Slam, will first represent Team Liquid in the $150,000 Chessable Masters, which begins on February 16 and serves as the first of two qualifying events in the 2025 Champions Chess Tour. The top-12 players from the tour qualify for the EWC. \n\nIn an announcement video Carlsen reportedly trolls the FIDE, according to Indian Express. \"The announcement video sees Carlsen wear a Team Liquid jersey along with a jacket and jeans. He then asks: 'Do I have to change?' To this, someone responds: 'Don't worry, we're pretty chill in esports. Welcome to Team Liquid.'\"","contentLength":3925,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"PAROL6: 3D-printed desktop robotic arm","url":"https://source-robotics.github.io/PAROL-docs/","date":1739644009,"author":"bo0tzz","guid":504,"unread":true,"content":"","contentLength":0,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43060818"},{"title":"Basketball has evolved into a game of calculated decision-making","url":"https://nabraj.com/blog/basketball-solved-sport/","date":1739643670,"author":"nabaraz","guid":503,"unread":true,"content":"<p>Basketball has evolved from a game of unpredictability into a game of calculated decision-making with the use of data and analytics.

Long-range shooting and layups are preferred over mid-range shooting. Players are no longer do-it-alls; they are now given specialized roles.</p><p>In the last decade, long-range shooting has gone from a secondary option to a primary choice for building offense. Recently, teams have realized three-pointers have higher point value despite their lower scoring percentage. This has led to a revolution in structuring an offense around taking long-range shots. The Golden State Warriors, led by Stephen Curry, probably jump-started this trend with 34 three-pointer attempts per game in the 2018-19 season, twice as much from five years ago. Celtics, this season, have averaged almost 50 three-pointers attempt this season (2024-25 season).</p><p>In the past, the team built its roster around a big name like Shaq. Most of the offense were from the center. This has now changed, with the primary strategy being to stretch the opposition and take long-range shots.</p><p>The 3-and-D model refers to a player, usually a wing player, who is just above average at three-pointers and plays competent defense.

As more advanced AI applications and a larger scale become required, scalability becomes more critical. Scalability ensures that AI systems can handle increasing workloads without any loss of performance.</p><p>The growing amount of data is a concern for AI systems in many facets. Most AI models, especially those based on deep learning, heavily depend on large amounts of data during training and inference.

With Kubernetes, horizontal scaling of AI jobs is a breeze, and the dynamic resizing of replica numbers can be done as a function of necessity. In contrast, Docker containers support lean, isolated environments for running AI models where resource conflict is not a performance bottleneck.</p><h3><strong>Effective Resource Management</strong></h3><p>Efficient use of resources is the key to cost-effective and sustainable AI deployment. Kubernetes' resource requests and limits allow for fine-grained CPU and memory resource management by avoiding underprovisioning and overprovisioning. Docker's resource management fills the gap by isolating container resources.</p><h2><strong>Scaling AI Infrastructure With Kubernetes and Docker</strong></h2><p>Containerization is one of the milestones in the evolution of scalable artificial intelligence infrastructure. Containerization of the AI application and its dependencies in a Docker container ensures consistency throughout the development, testing, and deployment environments.</p><p>\\\nFirst, you must define a Dockerfile in order to install the environment. The Dockerfile is a series of instructions about how to build a Docker image. It declares a base image, the dependencies required, and the initial setup commands that apply to your app. The following is a basic Dockerfile for a Python machine-learning model:</p><pre><code># Use an official Python runtime as a parent image\nFROM python:3.9-slim\n\n# Set the working directory in the container\nWORKDIR /usr/src/app\n\n# Copy the current directory contents into the container\nCOPY . .\n\n# Install any needed packages specified in requirements.txt\nRUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt\n\n# Expose the port the app runs on\nEXPOSE 5000\n\n# Define environment variable\nENV NAME World\n\n# Run the app\nCMD [\"python\", \"./app.py\"]\n</code></pre><p>\\\nIf the Dockerfile is ready, then you can build the Docker image and run the container. Run the following commands: \\n </p><pre><code># Build the Docker image\ndocker build -t ml-model:latest .\n\n# Run the container\ndocker run -p 5000:5000 ml-model:latest\n</code></pre><h2><strong>Deploying the Dockerized AI Model to Kubernetes</strong></h2><p> provides a wide range of orchestration features that enable efficient application management in the containerized infrastructure. Deployment of the Docker image on Kubernetes ensures that a specified number of application replicas is always running. The following is an example of deployment.yaml file that you can use to<a href=\"https://dev.to/pavanbelagatti/deploy-any-aiml-application-on-kubernetes-a-step-by-step-guide-2i37\"></a>:</p><pre><code>apiVersion: apps/v1\nkind: Deployment\nmetadata:\n  name: ml-model-deployment\nspec:\n  replicas: 3  \n  selector:\n    matchLabels:\n      app: ml-model\n  template:\n    metadata:\n      labels:\n        app: ml-model\n    spec:\n      containers:\n      - name: ml-model-container\n        image: ml-model:latest\n        ports:\n        - containerPort: 5000\n</code></pre><p>\\n The above code snippet shows how to deploy the AI model, but you also need to make the model externally accessible. You will need to expose it by defining a Kubernetes Service. The service.yaml below illustrates an example:</p><pre><code>apiVersion: v1\nkind: Service\nmetadata:\n  name: ml-model-service\nspec:\n  selector:\n    app: ml-model\n  ports:\n    - protocol: TCP\n      port: 80\n      targetPort: 5000\n  type: LoadBalancer\n</code></pre><p>\\n Use the kubectl command-line tool to apply the deployment and service configurations:</p><pre><code># Deploy the application\nkubectl apply -f deployment.yaml\n\n# Expose the service\nkubectl apply -f service.yaml\n</code></pre><p>Kubernetes provides excellent scaling capabilities to AI environments, maximizing resource utilization and performance. Horizontal scaling is done by adding additional containers, and vertical scaling involves adding additional resources like CPU or memory to a container.</p><p>Horizontal scaling is used to scale up the number of replicas (Pods) of an AI system to handle a higher workload. The process requires enabling dynamic scaling depending on the number of replicas. The command used to enable such a process is `kubectl scale`. The particular command is used to set up the deployment to function up to a maximum of five replicas:</p><p>\\\n`kubectl scale --replicas=5 deployment/ml-model-deployment`</p><p>\\\nThe command scales up the ml-model-deployment to use five replicas of the machine-learning model container. The system dynamically provisions more Pods to meet the required number afterward.</p><h3><strong>Automatic Scaling using the Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA)</strong></h3><p>Kubernetes facilitates auto-scaling using the Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA). The HPA dynamically adjusts the number of replicas based on resource use, i.e., CPU or memory, in relation to set limits. The YAML configuration shown below is a relevant example of an HPA that dynamically scales for ml-model-deployment in response to CPU use:</p><pre><code>apiVersion: autoscaling/v1\nkind: HorizontalPodAutoscaler\nmetadata:\n  name: ml-model-hpa\nspec:\n  scaleTargetRef:\n    apiVersion: apps/v1\n    kind: Deployment\n    name: ml-model-deployment\n  minReplicas: 2\n  maxReplicas: 10\n  targetCPUUtilizationPercentage: 50\n</code></pre><p>\\n In this setup, scaleTargetRef is used to define the Deployment to be scaled, i.e., ml-model-deployment. The minimum replica count is set using MinReplicas, while the maximum replica count is controlled using maxReplicas. In addition, the CPU utilization percentage is set using targetCPUUtilizationPercentage, i.e., to 50%. </p><p>\\\nCPU utilization of more than 50% across all Pods results in scaling up the replica count to a maximum of 10 automatically. As soon as CPU utilization drops below the set percentage, Kubernetes automatically reduces the replica count in order to release resources.</p><p>Horizontal scaling is mainly to cope with more traffic, whereas vertical scaling provides more resources (such as CPU or memory) to existing containers. The process is to scale up or down resource requests and limits in the Kubernetes Deployment. In order to scale up the CPU and memory limits of the ml-model-deployment, one would need to open the deployment.yaml file:</p><pre><code>apiVersion: apps/v1\nkind: Deployment\nmetadata:\n  name: ml-model-deployment\nspec:\n  replicas: 3\n  selector:\n    matchLabels:\n      app: ml-model\n  template:\n    metadata:\n      labels:\n        app: ml-model\n    spec:\n      containers:\n      - name: ml-model-container\n        image: ml-model:latest\n        ports:\n        - containerPort: 5000\n        resources:\n          requests:\n            cpu: \"1\"\n            memory: \"2Gi\"\n          limits:\n            cpu: \"2\"\n            memory: \"4Gi\"\n</code></pre><p>\\\nIn this updated configuration:</p><ul><li>requests specify the minimum resources required for the container.</li><li>limits define the maximum resources the container can use.</li></ul>","contentLength":7854,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Rust and the Null Paradigm: Exploring Safety and Alternatives","url":"https://dev.to/dedsecrattle/rust-and-the-null-paradigm-exploring-safety-and-alternatives-47b","date":1739641004,"author":"Prabhat Kumar","guid":554,"unread":true,"content":"<p>Rust is a systems programming language known for its focus on memory safety, concurrency, and performance. One of the key decisions made by the Rust team is the choice to <strong>not support the null paradigm</strong>. While this design choice leads to safer, more reliable code, it raises an important question for developers: <strong>How do we handle the absence of a value?</strong></p><p>In many programming languages, the concept of  or  (depending on the language) is used to represent the absence of a value. This approach, however, introduces a number of issues:</p><ul><li><strong>Null Pointer Dereferencing:</strong> Accessing a  pointer can lead to runtime errors that are often hard to debug.</li><li> values can lead to subtle bugs when programmers forget to check for them, causing unexpected behaviors in applications.</li></ul><p>Rust decided to leave behind this problematic paradigm in favor of alternatives that promote safety at compile-time.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Rust's Approach: </h2><p>Rust takes a unique approach to handling the absence of a value: it uses the  enum. This powerful construct allows developers to explicitly handle the presence or absence of a value.</p><p>The  type is defined as:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><ul><li> represents the presence of a value.</li><li> represents the absence of a value.</li></ul><p>This makes  a much safer alternative to . The compiler forces you to explicitly handle both cases ( and ), reducing the risk of null pointer exceptions.</p><p>Here's a simple example of how you might use  to handle optional values:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>In this example, instead of returning  when the user isn't found, we return , and the caller must handle the potential absence of a value.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Why  Is Better Than </h2><ul><li> With , Rust ensures that you never have to deal with null values unless you explicitly decide to. This eliminates the common pitfalls of null pointer dereferencing.</li><li> Rust‚Äôs borrow checker ensures that you handle all  cases correctly, even when dealing with complex ownership and lifetime semantics.</li><li> Rust‚Äôs pattern matching syntax makes it easy to express the logic of handling  and  values, leading to clean and readable code.</li></ul><h2>\n  \n  \n  Other Alternatives:  for Error Handling\n</h2><p>In addition to , Rust also offers the  enum for handling operations that might fail. The  type is especially useful when a function might produce either a valid result or an error, combining both success and failure cases into a single, explicit structure.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Just like , the  type forces developers to handle both cases explicitly, improving robustness and error recovery in your programs.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Conclusion: Embracing Safety and Clarity\n</h2><p>Rust‚Äôs rejection of the  paradigm and adoption of types like  is a conscious choice to create safer, more reliable code.

It provides memory safety without needing a garbage collector, making Rust highly efficient and reliable. If you're coming from languages like C++, Java, or Python, understanding Rust‚Äôs ownership system might feel daunting at first. In this post, we'll break it down step by step.</p><p><strong>What is Ownership in Rust?</strong></p><p>Ownership is Rust‚Äôs unique way of managing memory. Instead of using garbage collection or manual memory management, Rust enforces strict ownership rules at compile time. These rules ensure memory safety and prevent data races in concurrent programs.</p><p>The three key ownership rules are:</p><ol><li><strong>Each value in Rust has a single owner.</strong></li><li><strong>When the owner goes out of scope, Rust automatically deallocates the value.</strong></li><li><strong>Ownership can be transferred (moved) or borrowed (immutably or mutably).</strong></li></ol><h2>\n  \n  \n  Moving, Copying, and Cloning\n</h2><p>When assigning a value from one variable to another, ownership is transferred. Consider this example:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Since  is allocated on the heap, Rust prevents double-free errors by invalidating  when ownership moves to .</p><p>Certain types implement the  trait, meaning they are duplicated instead of moved. Examples include:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Primitive types (integers, floats, booleans, etc.) implement , so they don‚Äôt follow move semantics.</p><p>If you need to duplicate heap-allocated data, use :</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Cloning explicitly creates a separate copy in memory, avoiding move-related issues.</p><p>Rust allows borrowing instead of transferring ownership. Borrowing enables passing data without giving up ownership.</p><p>A reference () allows read-only access to data without taking ownership:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>You can have multiple immutable borrows at the same time, but not if there‚Äôs a mutable borrow.</p><p>A mutable reference () allows modification but enforces exclusivity:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Rust ensures at compile time that you cannot have multiple mutable references or a mix of mutable and immutable references at the same time.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Lifetimes: Ensuring Valid References\n</h2><p>Rust‚Äôs  prevent dangling references. Consider this example:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>The  lifetime annotation ensures that the returned reference is valid as long as both input references are valid.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Why Rust‚Äôs Ownership Model Matters\n</h2><ol><li>: No need for garbage collection, yet Rust prevents use-after-free and memory leaks.</li><li>: Enforces thread safety at compile time.</li><li>: Eliminates runtime overhead associated with memory management.</li><li>: Code is predictable and free from subtle memory bugs.</li></ol><p>Rust‚Äôs ownership model might take some getting used to, but once you grasp it, you gain the power to write efficient and safe code without worrying about memory leaks. By understanding moves, copies, borrowing, and lifetimes, you can write highly performant Rust applications while maintaining safety guarantees.</p><p>Are you currently learning Rust?

The Augmented Intelligence auction has been described by Christie's as the first AI-dedicated sale by a major auctioneer and features 20 lots with prices ranging from $10,000 to $250,000... \nThe British composer Ed Newton-Rex, a key figure in the campaign by creative professionals for protection of their work and a signatory to the letter, said at least nine of the works appearing in the auction appeared to have used models trained on artists' work. However, other pieces in the auction do not appear to have used such models. \nA spokesperson for Christie's said that \"in most cases\" the AI used to create art in the auction had been trained on the artists' \"own inputs\". \n\nMore than 6,000 people have now signed the letter, which states point-blank that \"Many of the artworks you plan to auction were created using AI models that are known to be trained on copyrighted work without a license.\"\n\nThese models, and the companies behind them, exploit human artists, using their work without permission or payment to build commercial AI products that compete with them. Your support of these models, and the people who use them, rewards and further incentivizes AI companies' mass theft of human artists' work. We ask that, if you have any respect for human artists, you cancel the auction. \n\nLast week ARTnews spoke to Nicole Sales Giles, Christie's vice-president and director of digital art sales (before the open letter was published). And Giles insisted one of the major themes of the auction is \"that AI is not a replacement for human creativity.\"\n\"You can see a lot of human agency in all of these works,\" Giles said. \"In every single work, you're seeing a collaboration between an AI model, a robot, or however the artist has chosen to incorporate AI. It is showing how AI is enhancing creativity and not becoming a substitute for it.\" \n\nOne of the auction's headline lots is a 12-foot-tall robot made by Matr Labs that is guided by artist Alexander Reben's AI model. It will paint a new section of a canvas live during the sale every time the work receives a bid. Reben told ARTnews that he understands the frustrations of artists regarding the AI debate, but he sees \"AI as an incredible tool... AI models which are trained on public data are done so under the idea of 'fair use,' just as search engines once faced scrutiny for organizing book data (which was ultimately found to fall under fair use),\" he said.... \"AI expands creative potential, offering new ways to explore, remix, and evolve artistic expression rather than replace it. The future of art isn't about AI versus artists ‚Äî it's about how artists wield AI to push boundaries in ways we've never imagined before....\" \n\nDigital artist Jack Butcher has used the open letter to create a minted digital artwork called Undersigned Artists. On X he wrote that the work \"takes a collective act of dissent ‚Äî an appeal to halt an AI art auction ‚Äî and turns it into the very thing it resists: a minted piece of digital art. The letter, originally a condemnation of AI-generated works trained on unlicensed human labor, now becomes part of the system it critiques.\" \n\nChristie's will accept cryptocurrency payments for the majority of lots in the sale.\n","contentLength":3474,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"A Programmer's Guide to Game Design: The Major Ingredients You Should Know","url":"https://hackernoon.com/a-programmers-guide-to-game-design-the-major-ingredients-you-should-know?source=rss","date":1739638805,"author":"Chenuli J.","guid":117,"unread":true,"content":"<p>Software developers spend their whole time with complicated problems, and they try to learn almost everything about algorithms, structures, frameworks, and blah-blah-blah. While playing games and coffee have become stress-busters in our lives, why can't building games be the best one?</p><p>\\\nEven though some people find game development insane, it‚Äôs easy for software developers because they have almost every skill needed: math, Programming, UX/UI, and the usual stuff. If a normal person takes 6 months to learn a Game Engine, the Developer will take a maximum of 3 months or less.</p><p>\\\nMany people don‚Äôt know this, but I started my tech career as a game developer, although I later turned my back on game development and became a Python developer. And no lies, they were a few of the best years in my life.</p><p>\\\nThis article is dedicated to any developer who wants to try something new or exciting (which is game development, yes). Scroll down!</p><p>Software developers who are interested in game development have a remarkable head start. Programming skills are the core of game development. Even if you‚Äôre more comfortable with Swift or Ruby, which is not commonly used in game development, you can quickly pick up other Object-oriented programming languages that are much more commonly used for game development, like C# or C++, easier than anyone!</p><p>\\\nIf you're a Python lover, you will love to hear this: There are really good, AAA games made with Python such as Battlefield 2, EVE Online, Civilization IV, and more!</p><p>Not only Python, but almost every commonly used Programming language has libraries that support making games. For example:</p><ul><li>Flutter has Flame, a game engine that supports Flutter language.</li><li>Ruby has Gosu, a library that makes it easy to develop 2D games.</li><li>Python has PyGame, a library that empowers you to create both 2D and 3D games.</li><li>Phaser allows you to create games with JavaScript and HTML5.</li></ul><p>For every beginner, either a software engineer or a novice, I give one common piece of advice‚Äî Start as small as possible. It doesn't matter how small pieces of code it has or how messy it is, you've won the challenge!</p><p>\\\nIf you love simple 2D games, I would recommend that you make a Pong game. Pong features simple graphics (2 rectangles and a circle) you can create on your own, minimal sounds, and a game loop. If you want to learn about making multiplayer games, allow matches to occur between two human players over a network. If you want to learn about AI, allow the player to challenge the computer.</p><p>\\\nAnd if you love 3D games like me, start with Cube Run. I haven't made it without a Game engine because, 3D becomes a bit harder with Python or others but with Unity, it's the best game I recommend to take a start.</p><h2><strong>Major Ingredients of A Game</strong></h2><p>If you make a cake without Sugar, no one will eat it. Except for diabetic people, of course, like my mom.</p><p>\\\nThe same goes for video games. It‚Äôs full of ingredients, some of which are required for every game and some of which are optional. I‚Äôll introduce them briefly.</p><p>In many games, the level itself is a challenge, trickier than the smartest AI enemies. Series like Tomb Raider also emphasize complex and challenging level design.</p><p>\\\nWhile the advent of open-world games like GTA may make the level design seem less important than in bygone times, it‚Äôs worth noting that even open-world games have ‚Äòlevels‚Äô, such as a particular building, structure, or map area you must enter to achieve a goal.</p><p>\\\nTo reduce player feelings of being railroaded, levels will ideally have multiple possible paths through them.</p><p>In games, you can‚Äôt really rely on natural light sources to illuminate your video game.</p><p>\\\n(You don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs a sun inside a game engine, do you?)</p><p>\\\nEvery light source in a video game must be added by hand and light manipulation is incredibly important. Light can be used for all of the following:</p><ul><li>Controlling the player‚Äôs ability . In horror and survival games, light is a resource that must be carefully managed.</li></ul><ul><li>Controlling a player‚Äôs ability . In games with an element of stealth, dark areas can provide cover while well-lit areas represent a difficult challenge.</li></ul><ul><li>Setting the mood. The quality of light can be used to set the mood, with sunny and bright lighting associated with happy times and brooding light associated with dark times.</li></ul><ul><li>Lighting the way. Light can be used to direct the player‚Äôs attention. The best-designed levels in video games often make clever use of light to guide the player in the right direction when they might otherwise be lost.</li></ul><p>Game art is the medium through which the game world is presented to the player. In a sense, all the programming effort that goes into making video games is an attempt to turn game art into something that feels responsive and alive. Game art is an umbrella term that includes textures, 3D models, sprites, particle effects, and lighting.</p><p>\\\nAnd yes, it‚Äôs a broad area, best to not cover it in this article.</p><p>Unlike in the real world, video game sounds cannot be made by accident. Every sound in the game universe must be added by hand, and it is through layering these sounds that the game world starts to feel lifelike. You also need to be mindful of sounds triggered by the player, by other characters, and ambient sounds that create the game world environment.</p><p>\\\nAs an example, the player accidentally hits a metal object; if it doesn't emit a sound, it doesn't feel natural, or the scientist who claimed that metals have sonorous properties got it wrong.</p><p>\\\nAnother ever-present fact of video games is music, used to create an emotional response in the player or removed entirely to leave behind an eerie silence. Unlike most compositions, video game music must loop seamlessly. It must also transition smoothly to new compositions based on in-game events, such as being spotted by an enemy.</p><p>\\\nHere are some of my favorite places to find sound:</p><p>You have made graphics, levels, and everything but the whole game feels like a dead body. If you want your game to be alive, you need some lines of code.</p><p>\\\nMost of my readers are probably a developer already, so you probably know the importance of programming anywhere. I'm not going to give a lecture on \"what is programming\", but here‚Äôs a bit about programming in game design.</p><p>\\\nFirst of all, you need to decide one thing: Are you making a game by using a Game Engine + Language or building a game from scratch with Python or something? It's your choice but let me help you: If you're going to build games for fun, choose the first option because it's easier. </p><p>\\\nAs I said in the beginning, programmers always juggle complex problems so you probably shouldn't take more stress with that too.</p><p>\\\n(Game Engines are the software used to create video games.)</p><p>\\\nThere are many of them, but the most popular ones are:</p><ul><li><p>Unity (Great for beginners, recommended)</p></li></ul><p>Next, choose a language to get started. Mostly, C# and C are used. Don't worry, you already got a headstart in knowing at least one programming language; most people start even before they know what the word ‚Äúprogramming‚Äústands for.</p><p>\\\nAnd that‚Äôs about it. Well, of course, there are many other optional ingredients that video games consist of but in general, the above are basically the starter pack.</p><p>Starting game development is easier for software developers than anyone. As someone with programming skills, you have a massive head-start on the average video game hobbyist who wants to learn how to make a game. If I scroll to the top of the article, I can list the below points as key takeaways.</p><ul><li><p>It's a lot easier to find a game dev library in your comfortable programming language to get started.</p></li><li><p>Start with a small game, maybe a clone of an existing game.</p></li><li><p>Game Engines make your life a lot easier.</p></li><li><p>If you want to make a big, impressive game but don‚Äôt have a lot of time to spare, consider teaming up with others or joining a modding community.</p></li></ul><p>And that's all for now, Happy Designing! üèé</p><p>\\\nIf you loved this article, make sure to subscribe using your email, so you can read all my content inside your inbox without missing any!</p><p>It‚Äôs totally free of charge and I don‚Äôt even have time to send spam emails.</p>","contentLength":8132,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Marc Andreessen dreams of making a16z a lasting company, beyond partnerships","url":"https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/15/marc-andreessen-dreams-of-making-a16z-a-lasting-company-beyond-partnerships/","date":1739638800,"author":"Marina Temkin","guid":50,"unread":true,"content":"<p>Many venture industry observers have wondered whether Andreessen Horowitz, a firm that manages $45 billion, has its sights on eventually becoming a publicly traded company.

Last year, solar and battery storage installation led capacity growth within Texas‚Äô electric grid, according to <a href=\"https://www.dallasfed.org/research/economics/2025/0114\">research from the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas</a> published in January.&nbsp;</p><p>Texas added nearly 1,500 megawatts of battery storage to the grid‚Äôs summer rated capacities in 2023. That figure almost tripled to 4,374 megawatts added in 2024, according to the report.&nbsp;</p><p>Capacity from solar power added to the grid enjoyed a similar trajectory. In 2023, 4,570 megawatts were added to the grid, while in 2024, nearly 9,700 megawatts were added.&nbsp;</p><p>Given that Texas has its own isolated energy grid, the Electricity Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) is responsible for managing the majority of energy for its residents.&nbsp;</p><div><p>Please take a look at the new openings in our newsroom.</p><a href=\"https://insideclimatenews.org/about/jobs/\" target=\"_blank\">See jobs</a></div><p>Historically, ERCOT, which manages 90 percent of the state‚Äôs power load, has primarily relied on natural gas. But other energy sources, like wind and solar, have played a critical role in offsetting high demand.&nbsp;</p><p>ERCOT added 3,400 megawatts from natural gas power plants in 2024. That‚Äôs after more than 1,000 megawatts of natural gas power were inactive within the grid from 2021 to 2023, according to Dallas Fed data.&nbsp;</p><p>The capacity growth from solar and battery storage allowed the grid to manage another hot Texas summer in 2024, reported Garret Golding, an assistant vice president for energy program at the Dallas Fed.&nbsp;</p><p>Battery storage is relatively new to ERCOT. One of the first battery power storage plants to be connected to ERCOT was in 2021, southeast of Dallas in Kaufman County.&nbsp;</p><p>The 50-megawatt plant run by Enel, one of the largest renewable energy owners and operators in the country, was the first of Enel‚Äôs 14 battery projects it has since developed across the state.&nbsp;</p><p>The forecasted power demand in Texas from population growth and heavy load users like data centers, cryptocurrency mining and artificial intelligence, alongside the competitive market for batteries, is dictating the rising use of storage within ERCOT, said Randald Bartlett, a senior director of operations and management for battery energy storage systems at Enel North America.</p><p>Texas‚Äô permitting processes and ability to develop has made it easier to add and build new capacity in comparison to other states with more laborious entryways, Bartlett said.&nbsp;</p><p>Before, there wasn‚Äôt really adequate criteria and evidence to forecast what batteries would contribute to the grid, ERCOT CEO Pablo Vegas said during a board of directors meeting on Tuesday.&nbsp;</p><p>Now, the grid operator added battery contribution to its report forecasting future capacity, demand and reserves.&nbsp;</p><p>Battery storage in the ERCOT grid has nearly doubled every year since 2021, Vegas said. At the end of 2024, there were nearly 10,000 megawatts from batteries within ERCOT.</p><p>Vegas said the capacity from batteries made a significant difference in ERCOT during bridge hours, or the winter morning hours when the sun has yet to rise and in the evenings after the sun sets.&nbsp;</p><p>‚ÄúBatteries made a meaningful contribution to what those shoulder periods look like and how much scarcity we get into during these peak events,‚Äù Vegas said when analyzing the grid‚Äôs performance during recent winter storms.&nbsp;</p><p>In the spring of 2024, Texas‚Äô installation of utility scale solar outpaced California‚Äôs, and jumped from 1,900 megawatts in 2019 to over 20,000 megawatts in 2024. As a result, solar met nearly 50 percent of the state‚Äôs peak power demand on some days.&nbsp;</p><p>The state‚Äôs quick deployment of utility scale solar didn‚Äôt happen overnight. It started in 2005, when the legislature instructed the Public Utility Commission of Texas to create competitive renewable energy zones, where the state planned transmission lines to connect cities to renewable energy sources in west Texas.</p><p>Initially, it was intended to capture wind power but was able to quickly include solar because of the existing infrastructure, said Dustin Mulvaney, an environmental studies professor at San Jose State University and an author of Planning to Build Faster: A Solar Energy Case Study, published in October by the Roosevelt Institute.&nbsp;</p><p>That forward-looking plan is often held up as a model renewable energy advocates and developers say the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission could implement across other regional transmission organizations, by requiring proactive planning and by creating rules of how to pay for transmission systems.&nbsp;</p><p>As the state‚Äôs grid continues to experience a rapid shift in the type of generation available to serve demand, the state‚Äôs grid operator is looking to build a higher voltage transmission system, upgrading from 345-kilovolt lines to 765-kilovolt lines.&nbsp;</p><p>In 2024, nearly 78 gigawatts of transmission-connected wind, solar and battery energy storage capacity was installed to the grid. And more than 102 gigawatts of transmission-connected renewable capacity is expected to be installed by the end of 2025, according to a December ERCOT report.</p><p>It‚Äôs that growth of both demand and renewables connected to the grid that‚Äôs led ERCOT to ask the Public Utility Commission to consider upgrading the state‚Äôs transmission system rather than expanding its existing one.&nbsp;</p><p>The 765-kV lines would provide significant economic and reliability benefits to the ERCOT system, wrote Kristi Hobbs, ERCOT‚Äôs vice president of system planning and weatherization, in the grid operator‚Äôs submission of its regional transmission plans to the commission in late January.</p><p>Regardless of which transmission plan is chosen, Hobbs wrote, the explosive growth projected throughout the next six years and beyond will require major public investment.&nbsp;</p><div><div><p>Perhaps you noticed: This story, like all the news we publish, is free to read.

But they aren't stranded there, and they weren't abandoned, the astronauts reminded CNN this week in a rare space-to-earth interview:\n\n\"That's been the rhetoric. That's been the narrative from day one: stranded, abandoned, stuck ‚Äî and I get it. We both get it,\" [NASA astronaut Butch] Wilmore said. \"But that is, again, not what our human spaceflight program is about. We don't feel abandoned, we don't feel stuck, we don't feel stranded.\" Wilmore added a request: \"If you'll help us change the rhetoric, help us change the narrative. Let's change it to 'prepared and committed.' \n\n\"That's what we prefer,\" he said... \n[NASA astronaut Suni] Williams also reiterated a sentiment she has expressed on several occasions, including in interviews conducted before she left Earth. \"Butch and I knew this was a test flight,\" she told CNN's Cooper, acknowledging the pair has been prepared for contingencies and understood that the stay in space might be extended. \"We knew that we would probably find some things (wrong with Starliner) and we found some stuff, and so that was not a surprise,\" she said. \nWhen Cooper opened the interview by asking the astronauts how they're doing, Williams answers \"We're doing pretty darn good, actually,\" pointing out they had plenty of food and great crew members. And Wilmore added that crews come to the space station on a careful cycle, and \"to alter that cycle sends ripple effects all the way down the chain. We would never expect to come back just special for us or anyone unless it was a medical issue or something really out of the circumstances along those lines. So we need to come back and keep the normal cycle going...\" \n\nCNN's article notes a new announcement from NASA Tuesday that the astronauts might return a couple weeks early \"after opting to change the SpaceX Crew Dragon capsule it will use.\" That mission's targeted launch date is now March 12. \n\nIn the meantime, Williams says in the interview, \"We do have some internet connection up here, so we can get some internet live. We've gotten football. It's been this crew's go-to this past fall. Also YouTube or something like that. It's not continuous ‚Äî it has chunks of time that we get it. And we use that same system also to make phone calls home, so we can talk to our families, and do videoconferences even on the weekends as well. This place is a pretty nice place to live, for the most part.\" \n\nAnd they're also \"working on with folks on the ground\" to test the NASA's cube-shaped, free-flying robotic Astrobees.","contentLength":2649,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Deepseek R1 Distill 8B Q40 on 4 x Raspberry Pi 5","url":"https://github.com/b4rtaz/distributed-llama/discussions/162","date":1739635889,"author":"b4rtazz","guid":463,"unread":true,"content":"","contentLength":0,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43059579"},{"title":"NTSYNC Driver Fix Being Worked On For Proper User Permissions","url":"https://www.phoronix.com/news/Linux-NTSYNC-Permissions-Issue","date":1739635532,"author":"Michael Larabel","guid":367,"unread":true,"content":"<article>One of the great new features of Linux 6.14 is the NTSYNC driver being completed for better emulating the Microsoft Windows NT synchronization primitives so that software like Wine and Proton (Steam Play) can provide for better performance when running Windows games on Linux.

It provides memory safety without needing a garbage collector, making Rust highly efficient and reliable. If you're coming from languages like C++, Java, or Python, understanding Rust‚Äôs ownership system might feel daunting at first. In this post, we'll break it down step by step.</p><p><strong>What is Ownership in Rust?</strong></p><p>Ownership is Rust‚Äôs unique way of managing memory. Instead of using garbage collection or manual memory management, Rust enforces strict ownership rules at compile time. These rules ensure memory safety and prevent data races in concurrent programs.</p><p>The three key ownership rules are:</p><ol><li><strong>Each value in Rust has a single owner.</strong></li><li><strong>When the owner goes out of scope, Rust automatically deallocates the value.</strong></li><li><strong>Ownership can be transferred (moved) or borrowed (immutably or mutably).</strong></li></ol><h2>\n  \n  \n  Moving, Copying, and Cloning\n</h2><p>When assigning a value from one variable to another, ownership is transferred. Consider this example:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Since  is allocated on the heap, Rust prevents double-free errors by invalidating  when ownership moves to .</p><p>Certain types implement the  trait, meaning they are duplicated instead of moved. Examples include:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Primitive types (integers, floats, booleans, etc.) implement , so they don‚Äôt follow move semantics.</p><p>If you need to duplicate heap-allocated data, use :</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Cloning explicitly creates a separate copy in memory, avoiding move-related issues.</p><p>Rust allows borrowing instead of transferring ownership. Borrowing enables passing data without giving up ownership.</p><p>A reference () allows read-only access to data without taking ownership:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>You can have multiple immutable borrows at the same time, but not if there‚Äôs a mutable borrow.</p><p>A mutable reference () allows modification but enforces exclusivity:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Rust ensures at compile time that you cannot have multiple mutable references or a mix of mutable and immutable references at the same time.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Lifetimes: Ensuring Valid References\n</h2><p>Rust‚Äôs  prevent dangling references. Consider this example:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>The  lifetime annotation ensures that the returned reference is valid as long as both input references are valid.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Why Rust‚Äôs Ownership Model Matters\n</h2><ol><li>: No need for garbage collection, yet Rust prevents use-after-free and memory leaks.</li><li>: Enforces thread safety at compile time.</li><li>: Eliminates runtime overhead associated with memory management.</li><li>: Code is predictable and free from subtle memory bugs.</li></ol><p>Rust‚Äôs ownership model might take some getting used to, but once you grasp it, you gain the power to write efficient and safe code without worrying about memory leaks. By understanding moves, copies, borrowing, and lifetimes, you can write highly performant Rust applications while maintaining safety guarantees.</p><p>Are you currently learning Rust?
