Previously, the kubelet\nwas able to initialize the node at the same time it created the node. Since the logic has moved\nto the cloud-controller-manager, this can cause a <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/running-cloud-controller/#chicken-and-egg\">chicken and egg problem</a>\nduring the cluster bootstrapping for those Kubernetes architectures that do not deploy the\ncontroller manager as the other components of the control plane, commonly as static pods,\nstandalone binaries or daemonsets/deployments with tolerations to the taints and using\n (more on this below)</p><h2>Examples of the dependency problem</h2><p>As noted above, it is possible during bootstrapping for the cloud-controller-manager to be\nunschedulable and as such the cluster will not initialize properly. The following are a few\nconcrete examples of how this problem can be expressed and the root causes for why they might\noccur.</p><p>These examples assume you are running your cloud-controller-manager using a Kubernetes resource\n(e.g. Deployment, DaemonSet, or similar) to control its lifecycle. Because these methods\nrely on Kubernetes to schedule the cloud-controller-manager, care must be taken to ensure it\nwill schedule properly.</p><h3>Example: Cloud controller manager not scheduling due to uninitialized taint</h3><p>As <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/running-cloud-controller/#running-cloud-controller-manager\">noted in the Kubernetes documentation</a>, when the kubelet is started with the command line\nflag <code>--cloud-provider=external</code>, its corresponding  object will have a no schedule taint\nnamed <code>node.cloudprovider.kubernetes.io/uninitialized</code> added. Because the cloud-controller-manager\nis responsible for removing the no schedule taint, this can create a situation where a\ncloud-controller-manager that is being managed by a Kubernetes resource, such as a \nor , may not be able to schedule.</p><p>If the cloud-controller-manager is not able to be scheduled during the initialization of the\ncontrol plane, then the resulting  objects will all have the\n<code>node.cloudprovider.kubernetes.io/uninitialized</code> no schedule taint. It also means that this taint\nwill not be removed as the cloud-controller-manager is responsible for its removal. If the no\nschedule taint is not removed, then critical workloads, such as the container network interface\ncontrollers, will not be able to schedule, and the cluster will be left in an unhealthy state.</p><h3>Example: Cloud controller manager not scheduling due to not-ready taint</h3><p>The next example would be possible in situations where the container network interface (CNI) is\nwaiting for IP address information from the cloud-controller-manager (CCM), and the CCM has not\ntolerated the taint which would be removed by the CNI.</p><blockquote><p>\"The Node controller detects whether a Node is ready by monitoring its health and adds or removes this taint accordingly.\"</p></blockquote><p>One of the conditions that can lead to a Node resource having this taint is when the container\nnetwork has not yet been initialized on that node. As the cloud-controller-manager is responsible\nfor adding the IP addresses to a Node resource, and the IP addresses are needed by the container\nnetwork controllers to properly configure the container network, it is possible in some\ncircumstances for a node to become stuck as not ready and uninitialized permanently.</p><p>This situation occurs for a similar reason as the first example, although in this case, the\n<code>node.kubernetes.io/not-ready</code> taint is used with the no execute effect and thus will cause the\ncloud-controller-manager not to run on the node with the taint. If the cloud-controller-manager is\nnot able to execute, then it will not initialize the node. It will cascade into the container\nnetwork controllers not being able to run properly, and the node will end up carrying both the\n<code>node.cloudprovider.kubernetes.io/uninitialized</code> and <code>node.kubernetes.io/not-ready</code> taints,\nleaving the cluster in an unhealthy state.</p><p>There is no one ‚Äúcorrect way‚Äù to run a cloud-controller-manager. The details will depend on the\nspecific needs of the cluster administrators and users. When planning your clusters and the\nlifecycle of the cloud-controller-managers please consider the following guidance:</p><p>For cloud-controller-managers running in the same cluster, they are managing.</p><ol><li>Use host network mode, rather than the pod network: in most cases, a cloud controller manager\nwill need to communicate with an API service endpoint associated with the infrastructure.\nSetting ‚ÄúhostNetwork‚Äù to true will ensure that the cloud controller is using the host\nnetworking instead of the container network and, as such, will have the same network access as\nthe host operating system. It will also remove the dependency on the networking plugin. This\nwill ensure that the cloud controller has access to the infrastructure endpoint (always check\nyour networking configuration against your infrastructure provider‚Äôs instructions).</li><li>Use a scalable resource type.  and  are useful for controlling the\nlifecycle of a cloud controller. They allow easy access to running multiple copies for redundancy\nas well as using the Kubernetes scheduling to ensure proper placement in the cluster. When using\nthese primitives to control the lifecycle of your cloud controllers and running multiple\nreplicas, you must remember to enable leader election, or else your controllers will collide\nwith each other which could lead to nodes not being initialized in the cluster.</li><li>Target the controller manager containers to the control plane. There might exist other\ncontrollers which need to run outside the control plane (for example, Azure‚Äôs node manager\ncontroller). Still, the controller managers themselves should be deployed to the control plane.\nUse a node selector or affinity stanza to direct the scheduling of cloud controllers to the\ncontrol plane to ensure that they are running in a protected space. Cloud controllers are vital\nto adding and removing nodes to a cluster as they form a link between Kubernetes and the\nphysical infrastructure. Running them on the control plane will help to ensure that they run\nwith a similar priority as other core cluster controllers and that they have some separation\nfrom non-privileged user workloads.<ol><li>It is worth noting that an anti-affinity stanza to prevent cloud controllers from running\non the same host is also very useful to ensure that a single node failure will not degrade\nthe cloud controller performance.</li></ol></li><li>Ensure that the tolerations allow operation. Use tolerations on the manifest for the cloud\ncontroller container to ensure that it will schedule to the correct nodes and that it can run\nin situations where a node is initializing. This means that cloud controllers should tolerate\nthe <code>node.cloudprovider.kubernetes.io/uninitialized</code> taint, and it should also tolerate any\ntaints associated with the control plane (for example, <code>node-role.kubernetes.io/control-plane</code>\nor <code>node-role.kubernetes.io/master</code>). It can also be useful to tolerate the\n<code>node.kubernetes.io/not-ready</code> taint to ensure that the cloud controller can run even when the\nnode is not yet available for health monitoring.</li></ol><p>For cloud-controller-managers that will not be running on the cluster they manage (for example,\nin a hosted control plane on a separate cluster), then the rules are much more constrained by the\ndependencies of the environment of the cluster running the cloud-controller-manager. The advice\nfor running on a self-managed cluster may not be appropriate as the types of conflicts and network\nconstraints will be different. Please consult the architecture and requirements of your topology\nfor these scenarios.</p><p>This is an example of a Kubernetes Deployment highlighting the guidance shown above.

In June of that year,  magazine could list fourteen reasonably big-budget, high-profile FPS‚Äôs earmarked for release in the next six months alone. And yet the FPS seemed rather to be running to stand still. Almost all of the innovation taking place in the space was in the realm of technology rather than design.</p><p>To be sure, progress in the former realm was continuing apace. Less than five years after <a href=\"https://www.filfre.net/2020/05/the-shareware-scene-part-3-the-id-boys\">id Software</a> had shaken the world with <a href=\"https://www.filfre.net/2020/06/the-shareware-scene-part-4-doom\"></a>, that game‚Äôs low-resolution 2.5D graphics and equally crude soundscapes had become positively quaint. Aided and abetted by a fast-evolving ecosystem of <a href=\"https://www.filfre.net/2023/05/the-next-generation-in-graphics-part-2-three-dimensions-in-hardware\">3D-graphics hardware</a> from <a href=\"https://www.filfre.net/2023/05/the-next-generation-in-graphics-part-3-software-meets-hardware\">companies like 3Dfx</a>, <a href=\"https://www.filfre.net/2023/04/the-next-generation-in-graphics-part-1-three-dimensions-in-software-or-quake-and-its-discontents\">id‚Äôs  engine</a> had raised the bar enormously in 1996; ditto <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/405/quake-ii/\"></a> in 1997. These were the cutting-edge engines that everyone with hopes of selling a lot of shooters scrambled to license. Then, in May of 1998, with <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/649/quake-iii-arena/\"></a> not scheduled for release until late the following year, Epic MegaGames came along with their own <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/330/unreal/\"></a> engine, boasting a considerably longer bullet list of graphical effects than . In thus directly challenging id‚Äôs heretofore unquestioned supremacy in the space,  ignited a 3D-graphics arms race that seemed to promise even faster progress in the immediate future.</p><p>Yet whether they sported the name  or  or something else on their boxes, single-player FPS‚Äôs were still content to hew to the ‚Äúshooting gallery‚Äù design template laid out by . You were expected to march through a ladder-style campaign consisting of a set number of discrete levels, each successive one full of more and more deadly enemies to kill than the last, perhaps with some puzzles of the lock-and-key or button-mashing stripe to add a modicum of variety. These levels were joined together by some thread of story, sometimes more elaborate and sometimes ‚Äî usually ‚Äî less so, but so irrelevant to what occurred inside the levels that impatient gamers could and sometimes did skip right over the intervening cutscenes or other forms of exposition in order to get right back into the action.</p><p>This was clearly a model with which countless gamers were completely comfortable, one which had the virtue of allowing them maximal freedom of choice: follow along with the story or ignore it, as you liked. Or, as id‚Äôs star programmer John Carmack famously said: ‚ÄúStory in a game is like a story in a porn movie. It‚Äôs expected to be there, but it‚Äôs not that important.‚Äù</p><p>But what if you could build the story right into the gameplay, such that the two became inseparable? What if you could eliminate the artificial division between exposition and action, and with it the whole conceit of a game as a mere series of levels waiting to be beaten one by one? What if you could drop players into an open-ended space where the story was taking place all around them?</p><p>This was the thinking that animated an upstart newcomer to the games industry that went by the name of Valve L.L.C. The game that resulted from it would prove the most dramatic conceptual advance in the FPS genre since , with lessons and repercussions that reached well beyond the borders of shooter country.</p><div><a href=\"https://www.filfre.net/2024/11/__trashed/newell2/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-6182\"><img decoding=\"async\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-6182\" src=\"https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/newell2-300x196.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"392\" srcset=\"https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/newell2-300x196.jpg 300w, https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/newell2.jpg 632w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\"></a></div><div><a href=\"https://www.filfre.net/2024/11/__trashed/harrington-2/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-6206\"><img decoding=\"async\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-6206\" src=\"https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/harrington.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"350\" srcset=\"https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/harrington.jpg 300w, https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/harrington-257x300.jpg 257w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\"></a><p>Mike Harrington, who left Valve in 2000 because there were other fish in the sea.</p></div><p>The formation of Valve was one of several outcomes of a dawning realization inside the Microsoft of the mid-1990s that computer gaming was becoming a very big business. The same realization led a highly respected Microsoft programmer named Michael Abrash to quit his cushy job in Redmond, Washington, throw his tie into the nearest trashcan, and move to Mesquite, Texas, to help John Carmack and the other scruffy id boys make . It led another insider named Alex St. John to put together the internal team who made DirectX, a library of code that allowed game developers and players to finally say farewell to creaky old MS-DOS and join the rest of the world that was running <a href=\"https://www.filfre.net/2022/11/doing-windows-part-10-chicago\">Windows 95</a>. It led Microsoft to buy an outfit called Ensemble Studios and their promising real-time-strategy game <a href=\"https://www.filfre.net/2024/03/age-of-empires-or-how-microsoft-got-in-on-games\"></a> as a first wedge for levering their way into the gaming market as a publisher of major note. And it led to Valve Corporation.</p><p>In 1996, Valve‚Äôs future co-founders Gabe Newell and Mike Harrington were both valued employees of Microsoft. Newell had been working there in project-management roles since 1983; he had played an important part in the creation of the <a href=\"https://www.filfre.net/2018/06/doing-windows-part-1-ms-dos-and-its-discontents\">early versions of Windows</a> before moving on to Microsoft Office and other high-profile applications. Harrington was a programmer whose tenure had been shorter, but he had made significant contributions to Windows NT, Microsoft‚Äôs business- and server-oriented operating system.</p><p>As Newell tells the tale, he had an epiphany when he was asked to commission a study to find out just how many computers were currently running Microsoft Windows in the United States. The number of 20 million that he got back was impressive. Yet he was shocked to learn that Windows wasn‚Äôt the most popular single piece of software to be found on American personal computers; that was rather a game called . Newell and Harrington had long enjoyed playing games. Now, it seemed, there were huge piles of money to be earned from making them. Doing so struck them as a heck of a lot more fun than making more operating systems and business software. It was worth a shot, at any rate; both men were wealthy enough by now that they could afford to take a flier on something completely different.</p><p>So, on August, 24, 1996, the pair quit Microsoft to open an office for their new company Valve some five miles away in Kirkland, Washington. At the time, no one could have imagined ‚Äî least of all them ‚Äî what a milestone moment this would go down as in the history of gaming. ‚ÄúOn the surface, we should have failed,‚Äù says Gabe Newell. ‚ÄúRealistically, both Mike and I thought we would get about a year into it, realize we‚Äôd made horrible mistakes, and go back to our friends at Microsoft and ask for our jobs back.‚Äù</p><p>Be that as it may, they did know what kind of game they wanted to make. Or rather Newell did; from the beginning, he was the driving creative and conceptual force, while Harrington focused more on the practical logistics of running a business and making quality software. Like so many others in the industry he was entering, Newell wanted to make a shooter. Yet he wanted his shooter to be more immersive and encompassing of its player than any of the ones that were currently out there, with a story that was embedded right into the gameplay rather than standing apart from it. Valve wasted no time in licensing id‚Äôs  engine to bring these aspirations to life, via the game that would come to be known as .</p><p>As the id deal demonstrates, Newell and Harrington had connections and financial resources to hand that almost any other would-be game maker would have killed for; both had exited Microsoft as millionaires several times over. Yet they had no access to gaming distribution channels, meaning that they had to beat the bush for a publisher just like anyone else with a new studio. They soon found that their studio and their ambitious ideas were a harder sell than they had expected. With games becoming a bigger business every year, there were a lot of deep-pocketed folks from other fields jumping into the industry with plans to teach all of the people who were already there what they were doing wrong; such folks generally had no clue about what it took to do games right. Seasoned industry insiders had a name for these people, one that was usually thoroughly apt: ‚ÄúTourists.‚Äù At first glance, the label was easy to apply to Newell and Harrington and Valve. Among those who did so was Mitch Lasky, then an executive at Activision, who would go on to become a legendary gaming venture capitalist. He got ‚Äúa whiff of tourism‚Äù from Valve, he admits. He says he still has ‚Äúpost-traumatic stress disorder‚Äù over his decision to pass on signing them to a publishing deal ‚Äî but by no means was he the only one to do so.</p><p>Newell and Harrington finally wound up pitching to Sierra, a publisher known primarily for point-and-click adventure games, a venerable genre that was now being sorely tested by all of the new FPS‚Äôs. In light of this, Sierra was understandably eager to find a horse of the new breed to back. The inking of a publishing deal with Valve was one of the last major decisions made by <a href=\"https://www.filfre.net/2011/10/ken-and-roberta\">Ken Williams</a>, who had <a href=\"https://www.filfre.net/2011/10/on-line-systems-is-born\">founded Sierra</a> in his living room back in 1980 but was now in the process of selling the business he had built from the ground up. As a man with such deep roots in adventure games, he found Valve‚Äôs focus on story both refreshing and appealing. Still, there was a lot of wrangling between the parties, mainly over the ultimate disposition of the rights to the  name; Williams wanted them to go to Sierra, but Newell and Harrington wanted to retain them for themselves. In the end, with no other publishers stepping up to the plate, Valve had to accept what Sierra was offering, a capitulation that would lead to a lengthy legal battle a few years down the road. For now, though, they had their publisher.</p><p>As for Ken Williams, who would exit the industry stage left well before  was finished:</p><blockquote><p>Now that I‚Äôm retired, people sometimes ask me what I used to do. I usually just say, ‚ÄúI had a game company back in the old days.‚Äù That inevitably causes them to say, ‚ÄúDid you make any games I might have heard of?‚Äù I answer, ‚Äú<a href=\"https://www.filfre.net/2015/08/leisure-suit-larry-in-the-land-of-the-lounge-lizards\">Leisure Suit Larry</a>.‚Äù That normally is sufficient, but if there is no glimmer of recognition I pull out the heavy artillery and say, ‚ÄúHalf-Life.‚Äù Unless they‚Äôve been sleeping under a rock for the last couple of decades, that always lights up their eyes.</p></blockquote><p>One can imagine worse codas to a business career‚Ä¶</p><p>In what could all too easily be read as another sign of na√Øve tourism, Newell and Harrington agreed to a crazily optimistic development timeline, promising a finished game for the Christmas of 1997, which was just one year away. To make it happen, they hired a few dozen level designers, programmers, artists, and other creative and technical types, many of whom had no prior professional experience in the games industry, all of whom recognized what an extraordinary opportunity they were being handed and were willing to work like dogs to make the most of it. The founders tapped a fertile pool of recruits in the online  and  modding scenes, where amateurs were making names for themselves by bending those engines in all sorts of new directions. They would now do the same on a professional basis at Valve, even as the programmers modified the  engine itself to suit their needs, implementing better lighting and particle effects, and adding scripting and artificial-intelligence capabilities that the straightforward run-and-shoot gameplay in which id specialized had never demanded. Gabe Newell would estimate when all was said and done that 75 percent of the code in the engine had been written or rewritten at Valve.</p><p>In June of 1997, Valve took  to the big E3 trade show, where it competed for attention with a murderers‚Äô row of other FPS‚Äôs, including early builds of , <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/322/sin/\"></a>, <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/1678/john-romeros-daikatana/\"></a>, , and <a href=\"https://www.filfre.net/2024/04/jedi-knight-plus-notes-on-an-expanded-universe\"></a>. Valve didn‚Äôt even have a booth of their own at the show. Nor were they to be found inside Sierra‚Äôs;  was instead shown in the booth of 3Dfx. Like so many of Valve‚Äôs early moves, this one was deceptively clever, because 3Dfx was absolutely huge at the time, with as big a buzz around their hardware as id enjoyed around their software.  walked away from the show with the title of ‚ÄúBest Action Game.‚Äù</p><p>The validation of E3 made the unavoidable moment of reckoning that came soon after easier to stomach. I speak, of course, about the moment when Valve had to recognize that they didn‚Äôt have a ghost of a chance of finishing the game that they wanted to make within the next few months. Newell and Harrington looked at the state of the project and decided that they could probably scrape together a more or less acceptable but formulaic shooter in time for that coming Christmas. Or they could keep working and end up with something amazing for the  Christmas. To their eternal credit, they chose the latter course, a decision which was made possible only by their deep pockets. For Sierra, who were <a href=\"https://www.filfre.net/2019/07/the-mortgaging-of-sierra-online\">notorious</a> for releasing <a href=\"https://www.filfre.net/2018/10/quest-for-glory-iii-and-iv\">half-finished games</a>, certainly did not intend to pay for an extra year of development time. The co-founders would have to foot that bill themselves. Nevertheless, to hear Gabe Newell tell it today, it was a no-brainer: ‚ÄúLate is just for a little while. Suck is forever.‚Äù</p><p>The anticipation around  didn‚Äôt diminish in the months that followed, not even after the finished  took the world by storm in May of 1998. Despite being based on a two-plus-year-old engine in a milieu that usually prized the technologically new and shiny above all else, Valve‚Äôs ‚Äúshooter with a story‚Äù had well and truly captured the imaginations of gamers. During the summer of 1998, a demo of the game consisting of the first three chapters ‚Äî including the now-iconic opening scenes, in which you ride a tram into a secret government research facility as just another scientist on the staff headed for another day on the job ‚Äî leaked out of the offices of a magazine to which it had been sent. It did more to promote the game than a million dollars worth of advertising could have; the demo spread like wildfire online, raising the excitement level to an even more feverish pitch.  was different enough to have the frisson of novelty in the otherwise homogeneous culture of the FPS, whilst still being readily identifiable  an FPS. It was the perfect mix of innovation and familiarity.</p><p>So, it was no real surprise when the full game turned into a massive hit for Valve and Sierra after its release on November 19, 1998. The magazines fell all over themselves to praise it. , normally the closest thing the hype-driven journalism of gaming had to a voice of sobriety, got as high on s supply as anyone. The magazine‚Äôs long-serving associate editor Jeff Green took it upon himself to render the official verdict.</p><blockquote><p>Everything you‚Äôve heard, everything you‚Äôve hoped for ‚Äî it‚Äôs all true. Half-Life, Valve Software‚Äôs highly anticipated first-person shooter, is not just one of the best games of the year. It‚Äôs one of the best games of any year, an instant classic that is miles better than any of its immediate competition, and, in its single-player form, is the best shooter since DOOM. Plus, despite the fact that it‚Äôs ‚Äújust‚Äù a shooter, Half-Life provides one of the best examples ever of how to present an interactive movie ‚Äî and a great, scary movie at that.</p></blockquote><p> sold its first 200,000 copies in the United States before Christmas ‚Äî i.e., before glowing reviews like the one above even hit the newsstands. But this was the barest beginning to its success story. In honor of its tenth birthday in 2008, Guinness of world-records fame would formally anoint  as the best-selling single FPS in history, with total sales in the neighborhood of 10 million copies across all platforms and countries. For Newell and Harrington, it was one hell of a way to launch a game-development studio. For Sierra, who in truth had done very little for  beyond putting it in a box and shipping it out to stores, it was a tsunami of cash that seemed to come out of nowhere, the biggest game they had ever published almost by an order of magnitude. One does hope that somebody in the company‚Äôs new management took a moment to thank Ken Williams for this manna from heaven.</p><p> has come to occupy such a hallowed, well-nigh sacrosanct position in the annals of gaming that any encounter with the actual artifact today seems bound to be slightly underwhelming. Yet even when we take into account the trouble that any game would have living up to a reputation as elevated as this one‚Äôs, the truth is that there‚Äôs quite a lot here for the modern skeptical critic to find fault with ‚Äî and, Lord knows, this particular critic has seldom been accused of lacking in skepticism.</p><p>Judged purely as a shooter, the design shows its age. It‚Äôs sometimes amazingly inspired, but more often no better than average for its time. There‚Äôs a lot of crawling through anonymous vents that serve no real purpose other than to extend the length of the game, a lot of places where you can survive only by dying first so as to learn what‚Äôs coming, a lot of spots where it‚Äôs really not clear at all what the game wants from you. And then there are an  lot of jumping puzzles, shoehorned into a game engine that has way more slop in it than is ideal for such things. I must say that I had more unadulterated fun with LucasArts‚Äôs , the last shooter I played all the way through for these histories, than I did with . There the levels are constructed like thrill rides straight out of the  films, with a through-line that seems to just intuitively come to you; looking back, I‚Äôm still in awe of their subtle genius in this respect.  is not like that. You really have to work to get through it, and that‚Äôs not as appealing to me.</p><p>Then again, my judgment on these things should, like that of any critic, be taken with a grain of salt. Whether you judge a game good or bad or mediocre hinges to a large degree on what precisely you‚Äôre looking for from it; we‚Äôve all read countless negative reviews reflective not so much of a bad game as one that isn‚Äôt the game that that reviewer wanted to play. Personally, I‚Äôm very much a tourist in the land of the FPS. While I understand the appeal of the genre, I don‚Äôt want to expend too many hours or too much effort on it. I want to blast through a fun and engaging environment without too much friction. Make me feel like an awesome action hero while I‚Äôm at it, and I‚Äôll probably walk away satisfied, ready to go play something else.  on easy mode gave me that experience;  did not, demanding a degree of careful attention from me that I wasn‚Äôt always eager to grant it. If you‚Äôre more hardcore about this genre than I am, your judgment of the positives and negatives in these things may very well be the opposite of mine. Certainly  is more typical of its era than  ‚Äî an era when games like this were still accepted and even expected to be harder and more time-consuming than they are today. <em>C‚Äôest la vie et vive la diff√©rence!</em></p><p>But of course, it wasn‚Äôt the granular tactical details of the design that made  stand out so much from the competition back in the day. It was rather its brilliance as a storytelling vehicle that led to its legendary reputation. And don‚Äôt worry, you definitely won‚Äôt see me quibbling that said reputation isn‚Äôt deserved. Even here, though, we do need to be sure that we understand exactly what it did and did not do that was so innovative at the time.</p><p>Contrary to its popular rep then and now,  was by no means the first ‚Äúshooter with a story.‚Äù Technically speaking, even  has a story, some prattle about a space station and a portal to Hell and a space marine who‚Äôs the only one that can stop the demon spawn. The story most certainly isn‚Äôt , but it‚Äôs there.</p><p> wasn‚Äôt even the shooter at the time of its release with the inarguably best or most complicated story. LucasArts makes a strong bid for the title there. Both <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/500/star-wars-dark-forces/\"></a> and the aforementioned , released in 1995 and 1997 respectively, weave fairly elaborate tales into the fabric of the existing  universe, drawing on its rich lore, inserting themselves into the established chronology of the original trilogy of films and the ‚ÄúExpanded Universe‚Äù series of  novels.</p><p>Like that of many games of this era, s story betrays the heavy influence of the television show <a href=\"https://www.filfre.net/2024/09/the-truth-is-out-there-part-1-the-will-to-believe\"></a>, which enjoyed its biggest season ever just before this game was released. We have the standard nefarious government conspiracy involving extraterrestrials, set in the standard top-secret military installation somewhere in the Desert Southwest. We even have a direct equivalent to Cancer Man, s shadowy, nameless villain who is constantly lurking behind the scenes. ‚ÄúG-Man‚Äù does the same in ; voice actor Michael Shapiro even opted to give him a ‚Äúlizard voice‚Äù that‚Äôs almost a dead ringer for Cancer Man‚Äôs nicotine-addled croak.</p><div><a href=\"https://www.filfre.net/2024/11/__trashed/half-life_7/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-6195\"><img decoding=\"async\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-6195\" src=\"https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/half-life_7.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" srcset=\"https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/half-life_7.jpg 800w, https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/half-life_7-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/half-life_7-768x576.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\"></a></div><p>All told, s story is more of a collection of tropes than a serious exercise in fictional world-building. To be clear, the sketchiness is by no means an automatically bad thing, not when it‚Äôs judged in the light of the purpose the story actually needs to serve. Mark Laidlaw, the sometime science-fiction novelist who wrote the script, makes no bones about the limits to his ambitions for it. ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt have to write the whole story,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúBecause it‚Äôs a conspiracy plot, everybody knows more about it than you do. So you don‚Äôt have to answer those questions. Just keep raising questions.‚Äù</p><p>Once the shooting starts, plot-related things happen, but it‚Äôs all heat-of-the-moment stuff. You fight your way out of the complex after its been overrun by alien invaders coming through a trans-dimensional gate that‚Äôs been inadvertently opened, only to find that your own government is now as bent on killing you as the aliens are in the name of the disposal of evidence. Eventually, in a plot point weirdly reminiscent of , you have to teleport yourself onto the aliens‚Äô world to shut down the portal they‚Äôre using to reach yours.</p><p>Suffice to say that, while  may be slightly further along the continuum toward  than  is, it‚Äôs only slightly so. Countless better, richer, deeper stories were told in games before this one came along. When people talk about  as ‚Äúthe FPS with a story,‚Äù they‚Äôre really talking about something more subtle: about its way of  its story. Far from diminishing the game, this makes it more important, across genres well beyond the FPS. The best way for us to start to come to grips with what  did that was so extraordinary might be to look back to the way games were deploying their stories before its arrival on the scene.</p><p>Throughout the 1980s, story in games was largely confined to the axiomatically narrative-heavy genres of the adventure game and the CRPG. Then, in 1990, Origin Systems released <a href=\"https://www.filfre.net/2017/04/from-squadron-to-wingleader\">Chris Roberts‚Äôs </a>, a game which was as revolutionary in the context of its own time as  was in its. In terms of gameplay,  was a ‚Äúsimulation‚Äù of outer-space dog-fighting, not all that far removed in spirit from the classic <a href=\"https://www.filfre.net/2013/12/elite\"></a>. What made it stand out was what happened when you weren‚Äôt behind the controls of your space fighter. Between missions, you hung out in the officers‚Äô lounge aboard your mother ship, collecting scuttlebutt from the bartender, even flirting with the fetching female pilot in your squadron. When you went into the briefing room to learn about your next mission, you also learned about the effect your last one had had on the unfolding war against the deadly alien Kilrathi, and were given a broader picture of the latest developments in the conflict that necessitated this latest flight into danger. The missions themselves remained shooting galleries, but the story that was woven around them gave them resonance, made you feel like you were a part of something much grander. Almost equally importantly, this ‚Äúcampaign‚Äù provided an easy way to structure your time in the game and chart your improving skills; beat all of the missions in the campaign and see the story to its end, and you could say that you had mastered the game as a whole.</p><p>People  this;  became by far the most popular computer-gaming franchise of the young decade prior to the smashing arrival of  at the end of 1993. The approach it pioneered quickly spread across virtually all gaming genres. In particular, both the first-person-shooter and the real-time strategy genres ‚Äî the two that would dominate over all others in the second half of the decade ‚Äî adopted it as their model for the single-player experience. Even at its most rudimentary, a ladder-style campaign gave you a goal to pursue and a framework of progression to hang your hat on.</p><p>Yet the same approach created a weirdly rigid division between gameplay and exposition, not only on the playing side of the ledger but to a large extent on the development side as well. It wasn‚Äôt unusual for completely separate teams to be charged with making the gameplay part of a game and all of the narrative pomp and circumstance that justified it. The disconnect could sometimes verge on hilarious; in , which went so far as to film real humans acting out a B-grade  movie between its levels, the protagonist has a beard in the cutscenes but is clean-shaven during the levels. By the late 1990s, the pre-rendered-3D or filmed-live-action cutscenes sometimes cost more to produce than the game itself, and almost always filled more of the space on the CD.</p><p>As he was setting up his team at Valve, Gabe Newell attempted to eliminate this weird bifurcation between narrative and gameplay by passing down two edicts to his employees, the only non-negotiable rules he would ever impose upon them.  had to have a story ‚Äî not necessarily one worthy of a film or a novel, but one worthy of the name. And at the same time, it couldn‚Äôt ever, under any conditions, from the very first moment to the very last, take control out of the hands of the player. Everything that followed cascaded from these two simple rules, which many a game maker of the time would surely have seen as mutually contradictory. To state the two most obvious and celebrated results, they meant no cutscenes whatsoever and no externally imposed ladder of levels to progress through ‚Äî for any sort of level break did mean taking control out of the hands of the player, no matter how briefly.</p><p>Adapting to such a paradigm the  engine, which had been designed with a traditional FPS campaign in mind, proved taxing but achievable. Valve set up the world of  as a spatial grid of ‚Äúlevels‚Äù that were now better described as zones; pass over a boundary from one zone into another, and the new one would be loaded in swiftly and almost transparently. Valve kept the discrete zones small so as to minimize the loading times, judging more but shorter loading breaks to be better than fewer but longer ones. The hardest part was dealing with the borderlands, so to speak; you needed to be able to look into one zone from another, and the enemies and allies around you had to stay consistent before and after a transition. But Valve managed even this through some clever technical sleight of hand ‚Äî such as by creating overlapping areas that existed in both of the adjoining sets of level data ‚Äî and through more of the same on the design side, such as by placing the borders whenever possible at corners in corridors and at other spots where the line of sight didn‚Äôt extend too far. The occasional brief loading message aside ‚Äî and they‚Äôre  brief, or even effectively nonexistent, on modern hardware ‚Äî  really does feel like it all takes place in the same contiguous space.</p><p>\nEvery detail of  has been analyzed at extensive, exhaustive length over the decades since its release. Such analysis has its place in fan culture, but it can be more confusing than clarifying when it comes to appreciating the game‚Äôs most important achievements. The ironic fact is that you can learn almost everything that really matters about  as a game design just by playing it for an hour or so, enough to get into its third chapter. Shall we do so together now?</p><p> hews to Gabe Newell‚Äôs guiding rules from the moment you click the ‚ÄúNew Game‚Äù button on the main menu and the iconic tram ride into the Black Mesa Research Center begins. The opening credits play over this sequence, in which you are allowed to move around and look where you like. There are reports that many gamers back in the day didn‚Äôt actually realize that they were already in control of the protagonist ‚Äî reports that they just sat there patiently waiting for the ‚Äúcutscene‚Äù to finish, so ingrained was the status quo of bifurcation.</p><p>The protagonist himself strikes an artful balance between being an undefined player stand-in ‚Äî what <a href=\"https://www.filfre.net/2024/06/the-last-days-of-zork\"></a> called an ‚ÄúAFGNCAAP,‚Äù or ‚ÄúAgeless, Faceless, Gender-Neutral, Culturally Ambiguous Adventure Person‚Äù ‚Äî and a fully fleshed-out character. As another result of Newell‚Äôs guiding rules, you never see him in the game unless you look in a mirror; you only see the world through his eyes. You do, however, hear security guards and colleagues refer to him ‚Äî or, if you like, to you ‚Äî as ‚ÄúGordon‚Äù or ‚ÄúMr. Freeman.‚Äù The manual and the intertitles that appear over the opening sequence of the game explain that his full name is indeed Gordon Freeman, and that he‚Äôs a 27-year-old theoretical physicist with a PhD from MIT who has been recently hired to work at Black Mesa. The game‚Äôs loading screen and its box art show us a rather atypical FPS protagonist, someone very different from the muscle-bound, cigar-chomping Duke Nukem or the cocky budding Jedi knight Kyle Katarn: a slim, studious-looking fellow with Coke-bottle eyeglasses and a token goatee. The heart of the computer-gaming demographic being what it was in 1998, he was disarmingly easy for many of the first players of  to identify with, thus adding just that one more note of immersion to the symphony. Small wonder that he has remained a favorite with cosplayers for decades. In fact, cipher though he almost entirely is, Gordon Freeman has become one of the most famous videogame characters in history.</p><p>The tram eventually arrives at its destination and a security guard welcomes you to the part of the complex where you work: ‚ÄúMorning, Mr. Freeman. Looks like you‚Äôre running late.‚Äù Passing through the double blast doors, you learn from your colleagues inside that it‚Äôs already been a rough morning: the main computer has crashed, which has thrown a wrench into an important test that was planned for today. Mind you, you don‚Äôt learn this through dialog menus, which Valve judged to qualify as taking control away from the player. You can‚Äôt speak at all, but if you approach the guards and scientists, they‚Äôll say things to you, leaving you to imagine your own role in the conversation. Or you can stand back and listen to the conversations they have with one another.</p><p>You can wander around as you like in this office area. You can look in Gordon‚Äôs locker to learn a little bit more about him, buy a snack from the vending machine, even blow it up by microwaving it for too long. (‚ÄúMy God!‚Äù says your colleague in reaction. ‚ÄúWhat are you doing?‚Äù) All of this inculcates the sense of a lived-in workspace better than any amount of external exposition could have done, setting up a potent contrast with the havoc to come.</p><p>When you get bored fooling around with lockers and microwaves, you put on your hazardous-environment suit and head down to where the day‚Äôs test is to be conducted. It isn‚Äôt made clear to you the player just what the test is meant to accomplish; it isn‚Äôt even clear that Gordon himself understands the entirety of the research project to which he‚Äôs been assigned. All that matters is that the test goes horribly wrong, creating a ‚Äúresonance cascade event‚Äù that‚Äôs accompanied by a lot of scary-looking energy beams flying through the air and explosions popping off everywhere. You‚Äôve now reached the end of the second chapter without ever touching a weapon. But that‚Äôs about to change, because you‚Äôre about to find out that hostile alien lifeforms are now swarming the place. ‚ÄúGet to the surface as soon as you can and let someone know we‚Äôre stranded down here!‚Äù demand your colleagues. So, you pick up the handy crowbar you find lying on the floor and set off to batter a path through the opposition.</p><p>This was a drill with which 1990s shooter fans were a lot more familiar, but there are still plenty of new wrinkles. The scientists and guards who were present in the complex before all hell broke loose don‚Äôt just disappear. They‚Äôre still around, mostly cowering in the corners in the case of the former, doing their best to fight back in that of the latter. The scientists sometimes have vital information to share, while the guards will join you as full-blown allies, firing off their pop-gun pistols at your side, although they tend not to live very long. Allies were a new thing under the FPS sun in 1998, an idea that would quickly spread to other games. (Ditto the way that the guards here are almost better at shooting you in the back than they are at shooting the rampaging aliens. The full history of ‚Äúallies‚Äù in the FPS genre is a fraught one‚Ä¶)</p><p>As you battle your way up through the complex, you witness plenty of pre-scripted scenes to go along with the emergent behavior of the scientists, guards, and aliens. Ideally, you won‚Äôt consciously notice any distinction between the two. You see a scientist being transformed into a zombie by an alien ‚Äúhead crab‚Äù behind the window of his office; see several hapless sad sacks tumbling down an open elevator shaft; see a dying guard trying and just failing to reach a healing station. These not only add to the terror and drama, but sometimes have a teaching function. The dying guard, for example, points out to you the presence of healing stations for ensuring that you don‚Äôt come to share his fate.</p><p>It‚Äôs the combination of emergent and scripted behaviors, on the part of your enemies and even more on that of your friends, that makes  come so vividly alive. I‚Äôm tempted to use the word ‚Äúrealism‚Äù here, but I know that Gabe Newell would rush to correct me if I did. Realism, he would say, is boring. Realistically, a guy like Gordon Freeman ‚Äî heck, even one like Duke Nukem ‚Äî wouldn‚Äôt last ten minutes in a situation like this one. Call it verisimilitude instead, a sign of a game that‚Äôs absolutely determined to stay true to its fictional premise, never mind how outlandish it is. The world  presents really is a living one; Newell‚Äôs rule of thumb was that five seconds should never pass without something happening near the player. Likewise, the world has to react to anything the player does. ‚ÄúIf I shoot the wall, the wall should change, you know?‚Äù Newell said. ‚ÄúSimilarly, if I were to throw a grenade at a grunt, he should react to it, right? I mean, he should run away from it or lay down on the ground and duck for cover. If he can‚Äôt run away from it, he should yell ‚ÄòShit!‚Äô or ‚ÄòFire in the hole!‚Äô or something like that.‚Äù In , he will indeed do one or all of these things.</p><p>The commitment to verisimilitude means that most of what you see and hear is, to use the language of film, diegetic, or internal to the world as Gordon Freeman is experiencing it. Even the onscreen HUD is the one that Gordon is seeing, being the one that‚Äôs built into his hazard suit. The exceptions to the diegetic rule are few: the musical soundtrack that plays behind your exploits; the chapter names and titles which flash on the screen from time to time; those credits that are superimposed over the tram ride at the very beginning. These exceptions notwithstanding, the game‚Äôs determination to immerse you in an almost purely diegetic sensory bubble is the reason I have to strongly differ with Jeff Green‚Äôs description of  as an ‚Äúinteractive movie.‚Äù It‚Äôs actually the polar opposite of such a stylized beast. It‚Äôs an exercise in raw immersion which seeks to eliminate any barriers between you and your lived experience rather than making you feel like you‚Äôre doing anything so passive as watching or even guiding a movie. One might go so far as to take  as a sign that gaming was finally growing up and learning to stand on its own two feet by 1998, no longer needing to take so many of its cues from other forms of media.</p><p>We‚Äôve about reached the end of our hour in  now, so we can dispense with the blow-by-blow. This is not to say that we‚Äôve seen all the game has to offer. Betwixt and between the sequences that I find somewhat tedious going are more jaw-dropping dramatic peaks: the moment when you reach the exit to the complex at long last, only to learn that the United States Army wants to terminate rather than rescue you; the moment when you discover a tram much like the one you arrived on and realize that you can drive it through the tunnels; the moment when you burst out of the complex completely and see the bright blue desert sky above. (Unfortunately, it‚Äôs partially blotted out by a big Marine helicopter that also wants to kill you).</p><p>In my opinion,  could have been an even better game if it had been about half as long, made up of only its most innovative and stirring moments ‚Äî ‚Äúall killer, no filler,‚Äù as they used to say in the music business. Alas, the marketplace realities of game distribution in the late 1990s militated against this. If you were going to charge a punter $40 or $50 for a boxed game, you had to make sure it lasted more than six or seven hours. If  was being made today, Valve might very well have made different choices.</p><p>Again, though, mileages will vary when it comes to these things. The one place where  does fall down fairly undeniably is right at the end. Your climactic journey into Xen, the world of the aliens, is so truncated by time and budget considerations as to be barely there at all, being little more than a series of (infuriating) jumping puzzles and a couple of boss fights. Tellingly, it‚Äôs here that  gives in at last and violates its own rules of engagement, by delivering ‚Äî perish the thought! ‚Äî a cutscene containing the last bits of exposition that Valve didn‚Äôt have time to shoehorn into their game proper. The folks from Valve almost universally name the trip to Xen as their biggest single regret, saying they wish they had either found a way to do it properly or just saved it for a sequel. Needless to say, I can only concur.</p><p>Yet the fact remains that  at its best is so audacious and so groundbreaking that it almost transcends such complaints. Its innovations have echoed down across decades and genres. We‚Äôll be bearing witness to that again and again in the years to come as we continue our journey through gaming history. Longtime readers of this site will know that I‚Äôm very sparing in my use of words like ‚Äúrevolutionary.‚Äù But I feel no reluctance whatsoever to apply the word to this game.</p><p><strong>Did you enjoy this article?

This includes bringing in seasoned product managers, engineers, and designers. When outside help is needed, our teams should work with contracting officers who understand how to evaluate third-party technical competency so our teams can be paired with contractors who are good at both building and delivering effective digital services.

Our choices for hosting infrastructure, databases, software frameworks, programming languages and the rest of the technology stack should seek to avoid vendor lock-in and match what successful modern consumer and enterprise software companies would choose today. In particular, digital services teams should consider using open source, cloud-based, and commodity solutions across the technology stack, because of their widespread adoption and support by successful consumer and enterprise technology companies in the private sector.</p><ol><li>Choose software frameworks that are commonly used by private-sector companies creating similar services</li><li>Whenever possible, ensure that software can be deployed on a variety of commodity hardware types</li><li>Ensure that each project has clear, understandable instructions for setting up a local development environment, and that team members can be quickly added or removed from projects</li></ol><ul><li>What is your development stack and why did you choose it?</li><li>Which databases are you using and why did you choose them?</li><li>How long does it take for a new team member to start contributing?</li></ul></div><div><h2>Deploy in a flexible hosting environment</h2><p>Our services should be deployed on flexible infrastructure, where resources can be provisioned in real-time to meet spikes in traffic and user demand.

This is typically a process of continuous review and improvement which should be built into the development and maintenance of the service. At the start of designing a new service or feature, the team lead should engage the appropriate privacy, security, and legal officer(s) to discuss the type of information collected, how it should be secured, how long it is kept, and how it may be used and shared. The sustained engagement of a privacy specialist helps ensure that personal data is properly managed. In addition, a key process to building a secure service is comprehensively testing and certifying the components in each layer of the technology stack for security vulnerabilities, and then to re-use these same pre-certified components for multiple services.</p><p>The following checklist provides a starting point, but teams should work closely with their privacy specialist and security engineer to meet the needs of the specific service.</p><ol><li>Contact the appropriate privacy or legal officer of the department or agency to determine whether a System of Records Notice (SORN), Privacy Impact Assessment, or other review should be conducted</li><li>Determine, in consultation with a records officer, what data is collected and why, how it is used or shared, how it is stored and secured, and how long it is kept</li><li>Determine, in consultation with a privacy specialist, whether and how users are notified about how personal information is collected and used, including whether a privacy policy is needed and where it should appear, and how users will be notified in the event of a security breach</li><li>Consider whether the user should be able to access, delete, or remove their information from the service</li><li>‚ÄúPre-certify‚Äù the hosting infrastructure used for the project using FedRAMP</li><li>Use deployment scripts to ensure configuration of production environment remains consistent and controllable</li></ol><ul><li>Does the service collect personal information from the user?

This includes measuring how well a system performs and how people are interacting with it in real-time. Our teams and agency leadership should carefully watch these metrics to find issues and identify which bug fixes and improvements should be prioritized. Along with monitoring tools, a feedback mechanism should be in place for people to report issues directly.</p><ol><li>Monitor system-level resource utilization in real time</li><li>Monitor system performance in real-time (e.g. response time, latency, throughput, and error rates)</li><li>Ensure monitoring can measure median, 95th percentile, and 98th percentile performance</li><li>Create automated alerts based on this monitoring</li><li>Track concurrent users in real-time, and monitor user behaviors in the aggregate to determine how well the service meets user needs</li><li>Publish metrics internally</li><li>Publish metrics externally</li><li>Use an experimentation tool that supports multivariate testing in production</li></ol><ul><li>What are the key metrics for the service?</li><li>How have these metrics performed over the life of the service?</li><li>Which system monitoring tools are in place?</li><li>What is the targeted average response time for your service?

Or maybe they‚Äôll want you to share what you know. It may fall off their plate. You will probably have to remind them a few times to get around to saying ‚Äúyes‚Äù. It might be a more pressing issue for you</p><p>Now, let‚Äôs take the alternative approach.‚ÄùHey, boss, I am going to install action X, which should solve the XYZ problems we‚Äôve been having.

The boss can still weigh in if they want to, but they don‚Äôt have to. If they forget about it or other issues pop up, you still proceed. This lets you keep moving forward and solving problems while keeping the boss informed and allowing them to add their two cents if it is important enough.</p><p>You can also use this approach with a group of people.</p><p>By the way, the deadline is critical too.

They worried personalized data could be used to charge different prices for different customers based on their shopping habits, financial circumstances or appearance. Kroger, the country's largest supermarket chain, had already been using digital price tags in its stores. \n\nKroger told lawmakers that it doesn't use facial recognition to help it set prices, a stance the company reiterated to the Tech Brief on Thursday. Still, the uproar helped to spark a push by consumer advocates who warn that the threat of invasive, personalized pricing schemes is real. Now, Democratic lawmakers in several states are working to ban so-called \"surveillance pricing\" ‚Äî when businesses charge customers more or less for the same item based on their personal information. \n\nBesides a bill in California, three more bill were introduced this month in Colorado, Georgia, and Illinois that also ban \"surveillance wages,\" which the article defines as employers adjusting wages based on how much data an employee collects. \"Both surveillance pricing and surveillance wages really disrupt fundamental ideals of fairness,\" University of California, Irvine law professor Veena Dubal tells the Washington Post. \n\nDubal is one of the consumer advocates behind a new report which notes information released last month by America's consumer-protecting FTC that \"suggests that surveillance pricing tools are being actively developed and marketed across a range of industries, including consumer-facing businesses like 'grocery stores, apparel retailers, health and beauty retailers, home goods and furnishing stores, convenience stores, building and hardware stores, and general merchandise retailers such as department or discount stores.\" The consumer advocates (which include the Electronic Privacy Information Center) put it this way. \n\"Imagine walking into a grocery store and seeing a price for milk that's higher than what the next shopper pays because an algorithm calculated that you're willing to spend more...\"","contentLength":2227,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Did xAI lie about Grok 3‚Äôs benchmarks?","url":"https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/22/did-xai-lie-about-grok-3s-benchmarks/","date":1740264914,"author":"Kyle Wiggers","guid":9350,"unread":true,"content":"<p>Debates over AI benchmarks ‚Äî and how they‚Äôre reported by AI labs ‚Äî are spilling out into public view.

That trade-off has made LFP batteries the go-to choice for standard-range EVs in China, helping to make electric cars more affordable and limit pollution. Now, American companies are starting to build their own LFP batteries to catch up to their Chinese rivals... But there are plenty of barriers for U.S. companies that want to adopt a technology dominated by Chinese firms. Tariffs and tax credit restrictions have made it too expensive for most American automakers to import LFP batteries from China, and national security concerns have made it hard for American companies to partner with Chinese battery makers to build factories in the United States... \n\n\nAlthough American scientists invented LFP batteries in 1997, U.S. automakers didn't invest in the technology. Instead, they bet on NMC batteries because they have longer range, a big concern for American EV buyers. \"Everyone in the West thought LFP was a nonstarter five or six years ago,\" said Adrian Yao, who founded STEER, a technology research group within Stanford University. \"We really did have a myopic focus on\" range, he added. That left the door open for Chinese companies to perfect LFP batteries, which have a few advantages. Instead of pricey nickel and cobalt, they use iron, which makes them 20 percent cheaper than NMC batteries, according to the International Energy Agency. While NMC batteries can be recharged up to about 1,000 times before they go kaput ‚Äî which is enough to put 200,000 miles on most EVs ‚Äî LFP batteries can last two or three times as long, according to Moura. Plus, LFP batteries' chemistry makes them less likely to catch fire and easier to extinguish. An NMC battery, on the other hand, is so flammable that \"you could put it underwater or in space, and it'll keep burning because the oxygen it needs to keep the flame going is embedded within itself,\" Moura said. \n\nThat safety advantage is key, because Chinese firms figured out they could pack LFP cells closer together inside a battery pack without risking a fire. That meant they could cram more energy into LFP batteries and nearly catch up to the range of NMC batteries. Last year, the Chinese battery giant CATL made the first LFP battery with more than 600 miles of range. Since LFP batteries are made from common materials and last longer, they also have a smaller environmental footprint than NMC batteries. \nFord used LFP batteries in its Mach-E sedan (2023) and F-150 Lightning pickup trucks (2024), according to the article, \"while Rivian began using them in the basic trims of its R1S SUV and R1T pickup truck this year... American LFP factories are slated to open this year in St. Louis and next year in Arizona.\"\nAnd an environmental engineering professor at the University of California at Berkeley predicts LFP battery factories in the U.S. will \"grow quite rapidly over the next five to 10 years.\"","contentLength":3321,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Writing a file system in Go -- not FUSE, but a real FS","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1ivuz61/writing_a_file_system_in_go_not_fuse_but_a_real_fs/","date":1740263514,"author":"/u/Rich-Engineer2670","guid":9377,"unread":true,"content":"<p>I would say I'm crazy, but this both well established and redundant.....</p><p>Assume I wanted to write my own file system (education), with Golang -- not a fuse variant, but I literally am taking a file on a block device and treating it as a disk.

Implemented for amd64 and arm64\n\tby Todd Mortimer in OpenBSD 6.4, for mips64 in OpenBSD 6.7, and\n\tpowerpc/powerpc64 in OpenBSD 6.9.  amd64 system call stubs also\n\tprotected in OpenBSD 7.3.\n    </li><li> addition to\n\t<a href=\"https://man.openbsd.org/mmap.2\">mmap(2)</a>\n\tdisallows memory pages to be written to core dumps, preventing\n\taccidental exposure of private information.\n\tTheo de Raadt, Mark Kettenis and Scott Soule Cheloha,\n\tFebruary 2, 2019.\n    </li><li>Similar to the opportunistic verification in ,\n\tsystem-calls can no longer be performed from PROT_WRITE memory.\n\tTheo de Raadt, June 2, 2019.\n    </li><li>System calls may only be performed from selected code regions\n        (main program, ld.so, libc.so, and sigtramp).  The libc.so region\n\tis setup by <a href=\"https://man.openbsd.org/msyscall.2\">msyscall(2)</a>.\n\tTheo de Raadt, November 28, 2019.\n\tThis mechanism was removed because later work on immutable memory +\n\tpinned system calls was even better.\n    </li><li>Permissions (RWX, MAP_STACK, etc) on address space regions can be\n\tmade immutable, so that <a href=\"https://man.openbsd.org/mmap.2\">mmap(2)</a>,\n\t<a href=\"https://man.openbsd.org/mprotect.2\">mprotect(2)</a> or\n\t<a href=\"https://man.openbsd.org/munmap.2\">munmap(2)</a> fail with\n\tEPERM. Most of the program static address space is now automatically\n\timmutable (main program, ld.so, main stack, load-time shared libraries,\n\tand dlopen()'d libraries mapped without RTLD_NODELETE).  Programmers\n\tcan request non-immutable static data using the \"openbsd.mutable\" section,\n\tor manually bring immutability to (page aligned heap objects) using\n\t<a href=\"https://man.openbsd.org/mimmutable.2\">mimmutable(2)</a>.\n\tTheo de Raadt, Dec 4, 2022.\n    </li><li>sshd random relinking at boot. Theo de Raadt. Jan 18, 2023.\n    </li><li>Some architectures now have non-readable code (\"xonly\"), both from\n\tthe perspective of userland reading its own memory, or the kernel\n\ttrying to read memory in a system call.  Many sloppy practices in\n\tuserland code had to be repaired to allow this.  The linker option\n\t is enabled by default. In order of\n\tdevelopment: arm64, riscv64, hppa, amd64,\n\tpowerpc64, powerpc (G5 only), octeon.\n\tsparc64 (sun4u only, unfinished).\n\tMark Kettenis, Theo de Raadt, Visa Hankala, Miod Vallat,\n\tDave Voutila, George Koehler in kernel and base, and\n\tTheo Buehler, Robert Nagy, Christian Weisgerber in ports.\n\tDec 2022 - Feb 2023, still ongoing.\n    </li><li>On all architectures which lack hardware-enforcement of xonly,\n\tsystem calls are now prevented from reading (via copyin/copyinst)\n\tinside the program's main text, ld.so text, sigtramp text, or\n\tlibc.so text.\n\tTheo de Raadt, Jan 2023.\n    </li><li>Architectures which lack xonly mmu-enforcement can still benefit\n\tfrom switching to --execute-only binaries if the cpu generates\n\tdifferent traps for instruction-fetch versus data-fetch.  The\n\tVM system will not allow memory to be read before it was\n\texecuted which is valuable together with library relinking.\n\tArchitectures switched over include loongson.\n\tTheo de Raadt, Feb 2023.\n    </li><li>ld.so and crt0 register the location of the\n        <a href=\"https://man.openbsd.org/execve.2\">execve(2)</a>\n\tlibc syscall stub with the kernel using\n        <a href=\"https://man.openbsd.org/pinsyscall.2\">pinsyscall(2)</a>,\n\tafter which the kernel only accepts an execve call from that\n\tspecific location. Theo de Raadt, Feb 2023. Made redundant by\n        <a href=\"https://man.openbsd.org/pinsyscalls.2\">pinsyscalls(2)</a>\n        which handles all system calls.\n    </li><li>Mandatory enforcement of indirect branch targets (BTI on arm64,\n        IBT on Intel amd64), unless a linker flag (-Wl,-z,nobtcfi) requests\n        no enforcement.\n    </li><li>The kernel and ld.so register the precise entry location of\n\tevery system call used by a program, as described in the\n\tnew ELF section  inside ld.so and\n\tlibc.so.  ld.so uses the new syscall\n        <a href=\"https://man.openbsd.org/pinsyscalls.2\">pinsyscalls(2)</a>\n        to tell the kernel the precise entry location of system calls in libc.so.\n\tSince all syscall entries are now known to the kernel, the\n\tpininsyscall(SYS_execve) interface becomes redundant.\n        <a href=\"https://man.openbsd.org/msyscall.2\">msyscall(2)</a> mechanism\n\talso becomes redundant (and is removed a bit later), because immutable\n\tmemory + pinsyscalls together are cheaper and more effective targeting.\n\tTheo de Raadt, Jan 2024.\n    </li><li> is a clang extension that, upon return from a function\n\tcleans the return value off the stack (one of many information leaks which\n\tcan be used to determine where functions in a different DSO reside).\n\tThe kernel, libc, libcrypto, and ld.so(1) are compiled with this option.\n\tamd64 only, for now.\n</li></ul><ul><li><a href=\"https://man.openbsd.org/strtonum.3\">strtonum(3)</a>:\n\tTed Unangst, Todd Miller, and Theo de Raadt, May 3, 2004, OpenBSD 3.6\n    </li><li><a href=\"https://man.openbsd.org/imsg_init.3\">imsg</a>:\n\tMessage passing API, written by Henning Brauer.\n\tIn libutil since May 26, 2010, OpenBSD 4.8;\n\tused by various daemons before that.\n    </li><li><a href=\"https://man.openbsd.org/ohash_init.3\">ohash</a>:\n\tWritten and maintained by Marc Espie.\n\tIn libutil since May 12, 2014, OpenBSD 5.6;\n\tused by make(1) and m4(1) before that.\n    </li><li><a href=\"https://man.openbsd.org/asr_run.3\">asr</a>:\n\tReplacement resolver written and maintained by Eric Faurot.\n\tImported April 14, 2012; activated on March 26, 2014, OpenBSD 5.6.\n    </li><li><a href=\"https://man.openbsd.org/reallocarray.3\">reallocarray(3)</a>:\n\tTheo de Raadt and Ted Unangst, April 22, 2014, OpenBSD 5.6\n    </li><li><a href=\"https://man.openbsd.org/getentropy.2\">getentropy(2)</a>:\n\tMatthew Dempsky and Theo de Raadt, June 13, 2014, OpenBSD 5.6\n    </li><li><a href=\"https://man.openbsd.org/pledge.2\">pledge(2)</a>:\n\tTheo de Raadt, July 19, 2015, OpenBSD 5.9\n    </li><li><a href=\"https://man.openbsd.org/recallocarray.3\">recallocarray(3)</a>:\n\tOtto Moerbeek, Joel Sing and Theo de Raadt, March 6, 2017, OpenBSD 6.1\n    </li><li><a href=\"https://man.openbsd.org/freezero.3\">freezero(3)</a>:\n\tOtto Moerbeek, April 10, 2017, OpenBSD 6.2\n    </li><li><a href=\"https://man.openbsd.org/unveil.2\">unveil(2)</a>:\n\tTheo de Raadt and Bob Beck, July 13, 2018, OpenBSD 6.4\n    </li><li><a href=\"https://man.openbsd.org/ober_read_elements.3\">ober</a>:\n        ASN.1 basic encoding rules API, written by Claudio Jeker and\n        Reyk Fl√∂ter, maintained by Rob Pierce and Martijn van Duren;\n        started in 2006/07, moved to libutil on May 11, 2019, OpenBSD 6.6\n</li></ul><ul><li><a href=\"https://man.openbsd.org/ypserv.8\">ypserv(8)</a>:\n\tStarted by Mats O.

DevClass note some key findings:\n\nWhen asked about their biggest worries for Rust's future, 45.5 percent cited \"not enough usage in the tech industry,\" up from 42.5 percent last year, just ahead of the 45.2 percent who cited complexity as a concern... Only 18.6 percent declared themselves \"not worried,\" though this is a slight improvement on 17.8 percent in 2023... \nAnother question asks whether respondents are using Rust at work. 38.2 percent claimed to use it for most of their coding [up from 34% in 2023], and 13.4 percent a few times a week, accounting for just over half of responses. At the organization level there is a similar pattern. 45.5 percent of organizations represented by respondents make \"non-trivial use of Rust,\" up from 38.7 percent last year. \n\nMore details from I Programmer:\n\nOn the up are \"Using Rust helps us achieve or goals\", now 82% compared to 72% in 2022; \"We're likely to use Rust again in the future\", up 3% to 78%; and \"Using Rust has been worth the cost of Adoption\". Going down are \"Adopting Rust has been challenging\", now 34.5% compared to 38.5% in 2022; and \"Overall adopting Rust has slowed down our team\" down by over 2% to 7%. \n\n\n\n\"According to the survey, organizations primarily choose Rust for building correct and bug-free software (87.1%), performance characteristics (84.5%), security and safety properties (74.8%), and development enjoyment (71.2%),\" writes The New Stack:\n\n Rust seems to be especially popular for creating server backends (53.4%), web and networking services, cloud technologies and WebAssembly, the report said. It also seems to be gaining more traction for embedded use cases... Regarding the preferred development environment, Linux remains the dominant development platform (73.7%). \n\nHowever, although VS Code remains the leading editor, its usage dropped five percentage points, from 61.7% to 56.7%, but the Zed editor gained notable traction, from 0.7% to 8.9%. Also, \"nine out of 10 Rust developers use the current stable version, suggesting strong confidence in the language's stability,\" the report said... \n\nOverall, 82% of respondents report that Rust helped their company achieve its goals, and daily Rust usage increased to 53% (up four percentage points from 2023). When asked why they use Rust at work, 47% of respondents cited a need for precise control over their software, which is up from 37% when the question was asked two years ago.","contentLength":2502,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Infocon: green","url":"https://isc.sans.edu/diary.html?rss","date":1740259803,"author":"","guid":9376,"unread":true,"content":"","contentLength":0,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"US AI Safety Institute could face big cuts","url":"https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/22/us-ai-safety-institute-could-face-big-cuts/","date":1740259356,"author":"Anthony Ha","guid":9316,"unread":true,"content":"<p>The National Institute of Standards and Technology could fire as many as 500 staffers, according to multiple reports ‚Äî cuts that further threaten a fledgling AI safety organization.

The more icons we have to scan over, the more brain power we put toward making sense of them rather than using the tools they represent. This slows us down, not just once, but over and over again.\n</p><p>\nWhile it may feel duplicative to add a text label, the reality is that few icons are self-sufficient in communicating meaning.\n</p><h2>\nThe Problems that Icons Create\n</h2><p><b>1. Few icons communicate a clear, singular meaning immediately</b></p><p>\nIt‚Äôs easy to say that a  icon will communicate meaning‚Äâ‚Äî‚Äâor that if an icon needs a text label, it‚Äôs not doing its job. But that doesn‚Äôt take into consideration the burden that icons‚Äâ‚Äî‚Äâ or ‚Äâ‚Äî‚Äâput on people trying to navigate interfaces.\n</p><p>\nEven the simplest icons can create ambiguity. While a trash can icon reliably communicates ‚Äúdelete,‚Äù what about the common pencil icon. Does it mean create? Edit? Write? Draw? Context can help with disambiguation, but not always, and that contextual interpretation requires additional cognitive effort.\n</p><p>\nWhen an icon‚Äôs meaning isn‚Äôt immediately clear, it slows down our orientation within an interface and the use of its features. Each encounter requires a split-second of processing that might seem negligible but accumulates across interactions.\n</p><p><b>2. The more icons within an interface, the more difficult it can be to navigate.</b></p><p>\nAs feature sets grow, we often resort to increasingly abstract or subtle visual distinctions between icons. What might have worked with 5-7 core functions becomes unmanageable at 15-20 features. Users must differentiate between various forms of creation, sharing, saving, and organizing - all through pictorial representation alone.\n</p><p>\nThe burden of communication increases for each individual icon as an interface‚Äôs feature set expands. It becomes increasingly difficult to communicate specific functions with icons alone, especially when distinguishing between similar actions like creating and editing, saving and archiving, or uploading and downloading.\n</p><p><b>3. Icons function as an interface-specific language within a broader ecosystem.</b></p><p>\nInterfaces operate within other interfaces. Your application may run within a browser that also runs within an operating system. Users must navigate multiple levels of interface complexity, most of which you cannot control. When creating bespoke icons, you force users to learn a new visual language while still maintaining awareness of established conventions.\n</p><p>\nThis creates particular challenges with standardized icon sets. When we use established systems like Google‚Äôs Material Design, an icon that represents one function in our interface might represent something entirely different in another application. This cross-context confusion adds to the cognitive load of icon interpretation.\n</p><h2>\nWhy Text Labeling Helps Your Interface\n</h2><p><b>1. Text alone is usually more efficient.</b></p><p>\nOur brains process familiar words holistically rather than letter-by-letter, making them incredibly efficient information carriers. We‚Äôve spent our lives learning to recognize words instantly, while most app icons require new visual vocabulary.\n</p><p>\nScanning text is fundamentally easier than scanning icons. A stacked list of text requires only a one-directional scan (top-to-bottom), while icon grids demand bi-directional scanning (top-to-bottom and left-to-right). This efficiency becomes particularly apparent in mobile interfaces, where similar-looking app icons can create a visually confusing grid.\n</p><p><b>2. Text can make icons more efficient.</b></p><p>\nThe example above comes from <a href=\"http://www.magnolia-made.com\" target=\"_blank\">Magnolia</a>, an application I designed. On the left is the side navigation panel without labels. On the right is the same panel with text labels. Magnolia is an extremely niche tool with highly specific features that align with the needs of research and planning teams who develop account briefs. Without the labels, the people who we created Magnolia for would likely find the navigation system confusing.\n</p><p>\nAdding text labels to icons serves two purposes: it clarifies meaning and provides greater creative freedom. When an icon‚Äôs meaning is reinforced by text, users can scan more quickly and confidently. Additionally, designers can focus more on the unity of their interface‚Äôs visual language when they‚Äôre not relying on icons alone to communicate function.\n</p><p><b>3. Icons are effective anchors in text-heavy applications.</b></p><p>\nAbove is another example from <a href=\"http://www.magnolia-made.com\" target=\"_blank\">Magnolia</a>. Notice how the list of options on the right (Export, Regenerate, and History) stands out because of the icons, but the text labels make it immediately clear what these things do.\n</p><p>\nSee, this isn‚Äôt an argument for eliminating icons entirely. Icons serve an important role as visual landmarks, helping to differentiate functional areas from content areas. Especially in text-heavy applications, icons help pull the eye toward interactive elements.\n</p><p>\nThe combination of icon and text label creates clearer affordances than either element alone.\n</p><p>\nEvery time we choose between an icon and a text label, we‚Äôre making a choice about cognitive load. We‚Äôre deciding how much mental energy people will spend interpreting our interfaces rather than using them. While a purely iconic interface might seem simple and more attractive, it often creates an invisible tax on attention and understanding.\n</p><p>\nThe solution, of course, isn‚Äôt found in a ‚Äúperfect‚Äù icon, nor in abandoning icons entirely. Icons remain powerful tools for creating visual hierarchy and differentiation. Instead, we need to be more thoughtful about when and how we deploy them. The best interfaces recognize that icons and text aren‚Äôt competing approaches but complementary tools that work best in harmony.\n</p><p>\nThis means considering not just the immediate context of our own interfaces, but the broader ecosystem in which they exist. Our applications don‚Äôt exist in isolation‚Äâ‚Äî‚Äâthey‚Äôre part of a complex digital environment where users are constantly switching between different contexts, each with its own visual language.\n</p><p>\nThe next time you‚Äôre tempted to create yet another icon, or to remove text labels, remember: the most elegant solution isn‚Äôt always the one that  simple‚Äâ‚Äî‚Äâit‚Äôs the one that makes communication and understanding  simple.\n</p><img width=\"30\" src=\"https://www.chrbutler.com/public/icons/asterisk.svg\"><a href=\"https://www.chrbutler.com/tagged/essays\"></a>","contentLength":6315,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43142989"},{"title":"Glitches for Windows 11 Update Include Breaking File Explorer","url":"https://tech.slashdot.org/story/25/02/22/183257/glitches-for-windows-11-update-include-breaking-file-explorer?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&utm_medium=feed","date":1740256440,"author":"EditorDavid","guid":9299,"unread":true,"content":"Five days ago on Patch Tuesday, Microsoft released patch KB5051987 for Windows 11 version 24H2, writes the XDA Developers site. \n\nBut \"As reported by Windows Latest and various communities like Reddit and Microsoft's help forum, many users have encountered a major issue...\" \nSome have reported that, in addition to File Explorer failing to launch, they're unable to open folders from the desktop, save Office files, or even download files.

Thus I consent, Sir, to this Constitution, because I expect no better, and because I am not sure, that it is not the best.‚Äù </p><p paraeid=\"{892b154e-8c25-42d0-8da8-ae2aec71512f}{114}\" paraid=\"157634583\">‚ÄúOn the whole, Sir, I cannot help expressing a wish that every member of the Convention, who may still have objections to it, would with me, on this occasion, doubt a little of his own infallibility, and to make manifest our unanimity, put his name to this instrument.‚Äù </p><p paraeid=\"{892b154e-8c25-42d0-8da8-ae2aec71512f}{120}\" paraid=\"2117331119\">Franklin then moved for the form of the signing to be such: ‚ÄúDone in Convention by the unanimous consent of the States present, the seventeenth of September, &amp;c. In witness whereof, we have hereunto subscribed our names.‚Äù </p><p paraeid=\"{892b154e-8c25-42d0-8da8-ae2aec71512f}{130}\" paraid=\"972683271\">This form had actually been thought up by Gouverneur Morris (PA), who had given it to Franklin so that Franklin‚Äôs esteem would lend it credence. The wording of the form doesn‚Äôt explicitly state that the signer is endorsing the Constitution. It only means that the signer is affirming that the states present in the Convention unanimously approved the Constitution. The idea was to get Gerry, Mason, and Randolph to sign by making their personal objections irrelevant to their signatures. </p><p paraeid=\"{892b154e-8c25-42d0-8da8-ae2aec71512f}{150}\" paraid=\"729640072\">Gorham (MA) then motioned for Congress to be given the power to increase the size of the House of Representatives from one representative for every 40,000 people to one for every 30,000. (Mind that Congress would not have been required to increase the House to such a size, but just given the option to do so.) Proposals such as this one had repeatedly failed, but King (MA) and Carroll (MD) seconded him. </p><p paraeid=\"{892b154e-8c25-42d0-8da8-ae2aec71512f}{164}\" paraid=\"1319186782\">Now, on this last day of the Convention, Washington (VA) spoke for the only time. While he said it was typically inappropriate for him, as president of the Convention, to offer his opinion, he felt called to support Gorham‚Äôs motion. He thought increasing the size of the House of Representatives would increase the ‚Äúsecurity of the rights and the interests of the people.‚Äù After Washington‚Äôs speech, no one spoke in opposition to the motion, and it passed unanimously. Jacob Shallus, the scribe who had the day before handwritten the engrossed copy of the Constitution, corrected the text to reflect this final amendment. </p><p paraeid=\"{892b154e-8c25-42d0-8da8-ae2aec71512f}{198}\" paraid=\"1378118405\">Randolph gave a brief speech where (much like one from two days earlier) he was almost apologetic about refusing to sign the Constitution, but left open the possibility that he might support the Constitution when Virginia considered ratifying it. He stated, ‚ÄúNine States [the minimum number for the Constitution to take effect] will fail to ratify the plan, and confusion must ensue.‚Äù </p><p paraeid=\"{892b154e-8c25-42d0-8da8-ae2aec71512f}{216}\" paraid=\"2102259563\">G. Morris and Williamson (NC) gave speeches encouraging the holdouts to sign. Hamilton (NY) spoke similarly, with Madison (VA) summarizing him thus: ‚ÄúNo man‚Äôs ideas were more remote from the plan than his own were known to be; but is it possible to deliberate between anarchy and convulsion on one side, and the chance of good to be expected from the plan on the other?‚Äù </p><p paraeid=\"{892b154e-8c25-42d0-8da8-ae2aec71512f}{228}\" paraid=\"1828567102\">Blount (NC) stated that his signature should not be taken as a sign of his support for the Constitution but just as his affirmation that the Constitution had been unanimously approved by the states at the Convention. </p><p paraeid=\"{892b154e-8c25-42d0-8da8-ae2aec71512f}{244}\" paraid=\"18537606\">Franklin gave a second speech where he personally begged Randolph to sign. Randolph said that Franklin‚Äôs proposed form for the signatures didn‚Äôt make a difference: signing the Constitution would imply that he supported it, and he didn‚Äôt. Madison writes that ‚ÄúHe [Randolph] repeated, that, in refusing to sign the Constitution, he took a step which might be the most awful of his life; but it was dictated by his conscience, and it was not possible for him to hesitate, ‚Äî much less, to change.‚Äù Randolph thought that presenting the Constitution to the American people to only accept or reject in total, without amendments, would cause all the ‚Äúanarchy and civil convulsions‚Äù which the soon-to-be signers professed to want to avoid. Gerry gave a speech to the same effect. </p><p paraeid=\"{01b48b25-d4db-49ae-94c9-8e9c2c527693}{9}\" paraid=\"1168694754\">Charles Cotesworth Pinckney (SC) did not like the ambiguity in Franklin‚Äôs proposed form for the signatures. He supported the Constitution and intended his signature to be a sign of that support. </p><p paraeid=\"{01b48b25-d4db-49ae-94c9-8e9c2c527693}{19}\" paraid=\"2066198772\">Ingersoll (PA) took a middle position: his signature would not indicate his support for the Constitution, but neither would it merely be his attestation to the Convention‚Äôs unanimity. His signature would be his ‚Äúrecommendation‚Äù that the Convention‚Äôs final product, ‚Äúall things considered, was the most eligible.‚Äù </p><p paraeid=\"{01b48b25-d4db-49ae-94c9-8e9c2c527693}{45}\" paraid=\"1837245824\">Franklin‚Äôs motion (related to the form of the signing) passed 10‚Äì1, with South Carolina‚Äôs vote divided on account of C.C. Pinckney and Butler wanting the form to be more emphatically supportive. </p><p paraeid=\"{01b48b25-d4db-49ae-94c9-8e9c2c527693}{55}\" paraid=\"2006718381\">The Convention then voted to deposit their official journals (which ended up being much less detailed than Madison‚Äôs personal notes) with Washington.  </p><p paraeid=\"{01b48b25-d4db-49ae-94c9-8e9c2c527693}{61}\" paraid=\"611006880\">The delegates then proceeded to sign the engrossed copy of the United States Constitution. Thirty-eight men signed thirty-nine names‚ÄîDickinson (DE) was ailing with a headache and had asked Read (DE) to sign for him two days earlier. Despite so many personal appeals, Gerry, Randolph, and Mason still refused to sign. Hamilton, as the only New Yorker present at this point, signed in a personal capacity, since New York could not be effectively represented in the Convention by only one delegate. The signatures were grouped by state, with Pennsylvania‚Äôs eight being the most. The listing of state names next to the signatures appears to be in the hand of Hamilton. Rhode Island, the only state not to send delegates to the Convention, is not listed. </p><p paraeid=\"{01b48b25-d4db-49ae-94c9-8e9c2c527693}{95}\" paraid=\"328781109\">After the signing, the Convention adjourned for a final time. </p><p paraeid=\"{01b48b25-d4db-49ae-94c9-8e9c2c527693}{101}\" paraid=\"2133607111\">The signatures did not have any legal significance. The Constitution was clear: it would only go into effect when nine of the thirteen states chose to ratify it. As hard as the past four months had been, the real challenge lay ahead, in convincing the American people to embrace the government that these men had authored. </p><p paraeid=\"{01b48b25-d4db-49ae-94c9-8e9c2c527693}{111}\" paraid=\"401102845\">As the last names were being signed, Franklin, in a personal aside to some other members, made an observation about the chair that Washington had been sitting in as he presided over the Convention. The chair had an emblem of half of a sun. Franklin noted that artists often have a hard time distinguishing between a rising and a setting sun in their artwork. ‚ÄúI have often and often, in the course of the session, and the vicissitudes of my hopes and fears as to its issue, looked at that behind the President, without being able to tell whether it was rising or setting: but now at length, I have the happiness to know, that it is a rising and not a setting sun.‚Äù </p>","contentLength":8579,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43142572"},{"title":"Utah Bill Aims to Make Officers Disclose AI-Written Police Reports","url":"https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2025/02/utah-bill-aims-make-officers-disclose-ai-written-police-reports","date":1740253986,"author":"hn_acker","guid":9379,"unread":true,"content":"<p><a href=\"https://www.popsci.com/technology/utah-ai-police-bill/\"></a><a href=\"https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2024/05/what-can-go-wrong-when-police-use-ai-write-reports\"></a></p><p><a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en/article/axon-acquires-fusus-ai-surveillance-retail-healthcare/\"></a><a href=\"https://www.police1.com/police-products/police-technology/software/report-writing/revolutionizing-police-report-writing-axons-draft-one-transforms-the-tedious-into-the-effortless\"></a><a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2021/12/08/police-reform-body-cameras-axon-motorola/\"></a></p><p><a href=\"https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2019/04/content-moderation-broken-let-us-count-ways\"></a></p><p><a href=\"https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2024/03/how-avoid-ai-apocalypse-one-easy-step\"></a></p><p><a href=\"https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2024/10/prosecutors-washington-state-warn-police-dont-use-gen-ai-write-reports\"></a></p>","contentLength":0,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43142518"},{"title":"California Sues Data-Harvesting Company NPD, Enforcing Strict Privacy Law","url":"https://yro.slashdot.org/story/25/02/22/1512258/california-sues-data-harvesting-company-npd-enforcing-strict-privacy-law?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&utm_medium=feed","date":1740252840,"author":"EditorDavid","guid":9281,"unread":true,"content":"California sued to fine a data-harvesting company, reports the Washington Post, calling it \"a rare step to put muscle behind one of the strongest online privacy laws in the United States.\"\n\nEven when states have tried to restrict data brokers, it has been tough to make those laws stick. That has generally been a problem for the 19 states that have passed broad laws to protect personal information, said Matt Schwartz, a policy analyst for Consumer Reports. He said there has been only 15 or so public enforcement actions by regulators overseeing all those laws. Partly because companies aren't held accountable, they're empowered to ignore the privacy standards. \"Noncompliance is fairly widespread,\" Schwartz said. \"It's a major problem.\" \n\n That's why California is unusual with a data broker law that seems to have teeth. To make sure state residents can order all data brokers operating in the state to delete their personal records [with a single request], California is now requiring brokers to register with the state or face a fine of $200 a day. The state's privacy watchdog said Thursday that it filed litigation to force one data broker, National Public Data, to pay $46,000 for failing to comply with that initial phase of the data broker law. NPD declined to comment through an attorney... This first lawsuit for noncompliance, Schwartz said, shows that California is serious about making companies live up to their privacy obligations... \"If they can successfully build it and show it works, it will create a blueprint for other states interested in this idea,\" he said. \nLast summer NPD \"spilled hundreds of millions of Americans' Social Security Numbers, addresses, and phone numbers online,\" according to the blog Krebs on Security, adding that another NPD data broker sharing access to the same consumer records \"inadvertently published the passwords to its back-end database in a file that was freely available from its homepage...\" \nCalifornia's attempt to regulate the industry inspired the nonprofit Consumer Reports to create an app called Permission Slip that reveals what data companies collect and, for people in U.S. states, will \"work with you to file a request, telling companies to stop selling your personal information.\" \n\nOther data-protecting options suggested by The Washington Post:\n Use Firefox, Brave or DuckDuckGo, \"which can automatically tell websites not to sell or share your data. Those demands from the web browsers are legally binding or will be soon in at least nine states.\"\nUse Privacy Badger, an EFF browser extension which the EFF says \"automatically tells websites not to sell or share your data including where it's required by state law.\"","contentLength":2695,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"The Birth of Chipzilla","url":"https://www.abortretry.fail/p/the-birth-of-chipzilla","date":1740251041,"author":"rbanffy","guid":9586,"unread":true,"content":"<p><em>I do not expect to join any company which is simply a manufacturer of semiconductors. I would rather try to find some small company which is trying to develop some product or technology which no one has yet done. To stay independent (and small) I might form a new company, after a vacation.</em></p><p><em> just called me on the phone. We'd been friends for a long time. Documents? There was practically nothing. Noyce's reputation was good enough. We put out a page-and-a-half little circular, but I'd raised the money even before people saw it.</em></p><p>Intel‚Äôs structure in these early days had Rock as Chairman, Noyce as CEO, Moore as Executive VP, Grove as director of engineering, and Vad√°sz as the director of MOS design.</p><p>Before the company could begin operations, they needed a place to work. Over on Middlefield Road in Mountain View, Union Carbide was vacating a building. They‚Äôd really just begun that process, but a conference room was available. Intel rented it. As Intel took over the building, Moore felt the space was larger than what they really needed, but whether he was right or wrong, that wouldn‚Äôt be the case for too long. Official operations of Intel began in August of 1968.</p><p>For Intel‚Äôs first few months, the company had quite a bit of work. They needed to build a manufacturing process, figure out their product line, and hire enough people to get products made and sold. This involved them needing to build Fab1 as quickly as possible. The goal was to get things done by the end of December, and this meant that they wouldn‚Äôt be building every tool they needed. At Wescon, they actually bought some equipment right off the show floor. A few things had to be adapted to meet their needs, but most of their equipment wasn‚Äôt made by them. This wasn‚Äôt solely due to the timing constraints either. The founders of Intel had learned from their prior experiences in this industry. While a single company might be able to innovate in some areas, it wasn‚Äôt long before competitors replicated that success. Then, those competitors would also be iterating and innovating. A single company had a limited customer base, but the market as a whole was larger and innovations could come from anywhere. They wanted everyone‚Äôs expertise, so they bought what they could from whomever had the best tools. Moore worked closely with Intel‚Äôs suppliers, and he even made some investments in them personally. </p><p>While Moore, Noyce, and Rock felt little fear at Intel, this wasn‚Äôt true for Grove. At Fairchild, Grove had been strictly R&amp;D. He didn‚Äôt really see the rest of the company, and he‚Äôd been hired by Moore out of graduate school. At Intel, he had the chance to really see the entire company and its operations. He constantly feared that the company would go bankrupt, but perhaps as a result of that fear, he became quite focused on manufacturing. He wanted the company to be able to do the same things every day to make a uniform product successfully, affordably, and reliably. He quickly began handle much of the company‚Äôs operations. The team that was assembled to undertake these early efforts was phenomenal, and Intel met its goal completing the Fab1 setup by the 31st of December.</p><p>Before Fab1 was even completed, Noyce had visited Sharp in Japan. They spoke Tadashi Sasaki with the hope of gaining (at least some of) the company‚Äôs business for ICs. Sasaki then asked Rockwell, who did their manufacturing work, if they could give Intel some of their business, and Rockwell said no; they wanted to enforce their contract‚Äôs exclusivity. Sasaki then invested 40 million yen into his friends Yoshio Kojima‚Äôs company, Bijikon Kabushiki-gaisha (or Busicom), in Nara, Japan which gave him quite a bit of influence there, and allowed him to work on a CMOS calculator with Intel. Marcian Edward Hoff Jr (or Ted), Intel employee twelve, was the person initially tasked with this project on the Intel side of things. He worked as both an engineer and the liaison between the two companies.</p><p>In April of 1969, Intel released the 3101 SRAM. The 3101 held 64 bits of data (eight letters of sixteen digits), and sold for $99.50 (about $850 in 2025 dollars). Even at this time, the chip had far too little storage capacity to be useful as main memory (especially with its high price), but it was incredibly fast with an access time of fifty nanoseconds and it dissipated just six milliwatts per bit. With the chip‚Äôs high speed, low power draw, and small size, it was quite useful for processor registers in minicomputers and mainframes. The company had been hoping to gain a Honeywell contract with the 3101. That didn‚Äôt happen, but the chip was moderately successful. This chip was, in fact, successful enough that Intel‚Äôs work with Busicom fell on the back burner.</p><p>Busicom had initially provided Intel with a twelve chip, PMOS, decimal arithmetic design for their calculator hardware, and by June, Masatoshi Shima had refined this to seven chips. He didn‚Äôt have a full schematic, but it was something to work with. Shima then visited Intel in June with two other Busicom engineers. When Shima arrived, he was a bit dismayed. Almost no progress had been made, and he discovered that Intel had some serious expertise in hardware and memory design, but they didn‚Äôt have any serious expertise in logic design. Stan Mazor began to act as a buffer between Shima and Hoff, and over three months, there were many meetings about the design, but almost no progress.</p><p>At this time, Intel was just a memory company. They had packaging to accommodate early memories and nothing more. This limited the design of the chips to 4bit allowing the chip to fit in a 16-pin or 18-pin DIP. These restrictions were not initially given to Busicom, but Hoff knew them, and they influenced what he presented. Unknown to Intel, Sasaki had also come up with a four chip design and gave this to Busicom. With both sides now agreeing to a four chip design, it would seem that things could have progressed, but unknown to Busicom, no more progress would be made that year.</p><p>In July of 1969, Intel released the 1101. This was first MOS memory chip. The 1101 was slower than the 3101, but had a capacity of 256 bits, used silicon gates, and allowed for far higher memory densities than had previously been possible.</p><p>In December of 1969, CTC provided Intel the CPU requirements and preliminary designs for a processor they planned to use in their Datapoint 2200 terminal. Intel was then supposed to implement these in LSI. At Intel this project became the 1201, but much like the Busicom project, it wasn‚Äôt given any priority. Intel was a memory company. Frustrated, CTC turned to Texas Instruments who also failed, and CTC eventually built the processor out of discreet components.</p><p>For 1969, Intel ended the year with revenues of $565,874 and a loss for the year of $1,912,833 which meant a loss per share of $1.66. While this sounds terrible, the company had set expectations that this would more or less be the case.</p><p>Back on the Busicom project, Hoff eventually brought a proposal chip design to Shima that would use a general purpose 4bit CPU with binary logic, a ROM chip, and a RAM chip. Shima then added a 10bit static shift register for use with the printer and keyboard interface of the calculator. They improved the instruction set, the bus, and by December of 1969, Shima was able to write the functional specification. The agreement for Intel to build the chips was officially entered into on the 6th of February in 1970.</p><p>In April of 1970, Federico Faggin joined Intel after having left Fairchild. He‚Äôd previously worked with Vad√°sz at Fairchild, and his skills, especially his having developed silicon gate technology, were well known to the executives at Intel. Their company was essentially based upon Faggin‚Äôs work. Given both Faggin‚Äôs background and Intel‚Äôs needs, his request to work on chip design was immediately accepted. Faggin now had just six months to produce working silicon from a specification, and he didn‚Äôt have anyone to help him in the endeavor. Shima returned to Intel just a few days later and was rather unhappy to discover that effectively zero further work had been done on the calculator chips. Faggin started working 12 to 16 hours each day. This was particularly hard for him given he had a month old daughter at home and a loving wife. During this time, his wife went to Italy with her sister as he couldn‚Äôt be around to help. I am sure that Faggin somewhat enjoyed the work, but the hours, the pace, the separation from his family, and the deadline were probably dreadful. Adding to this, when Faggin reviewed the specification, he thought it to be a poor design. There was much that he wished to change, but he didn‚Äôt have the time. More over, when he asked questions, he was told that this was his project and he simply needed to figure it out. He verified that the architecture was free of errors, but otherwise didn‚Äôt change it. He had too much to do. There was still logic design to be done, circuit design, layout, cutting, masking, initial fabrication, testing, fixing any problems found in testing, and then the tasks related to production.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.abortretry.fail/p/work-at-the-mill\" rel=\"\">PDP-11</a></p><p>In December of 1970, the Busicom chips came back for testing. None of them worked. Faggin began checking them with a microscope, and he realized that one of the masks hadn‚Äôt been applied. He noted this, and requested another run of chips be made. Those came back three weeks later. In January of 1971, Federico Faggin completed testing of the first single-chip microprocessor ever made. It was his second self-designed computer, but this one was built with multiple technologies he had pioneered. He was just 29 years old. The four chips he created were the 4001, 4002, 4003, and the 4004. The 4001 was a ROM of 256 bytes with a built-in 4bit I/O port. The 4002 was a RAM chip of 40 bytes, which would, in this case, hold 80 4bit words. The 4003 was a 10bit shift register, and in the system for which this chip was designed, it would handle the keyboard and printer. The Intel 4004 was a 4bit microprocessor that ran at 750kHz. It was built of 2300 transistors on a 10 micron process and packaged in a 16-pin DIP. It used 8bit instructions, had 4bit data words, and 12bit addressing. This rather unusual arrangement meant that the 4004 could address 4120 bits of RAM which would mean 1280 4bit characters. It could address 32768 bits of ROM which would mean 4096 8bit words. The 4004 had 46 instructions and 16 registers.</p><p>Intel‚Äôs revenues for 1970 were $3,932,517 but the company posted another loss (though far smaller) of $969,915 which meant a loss of $0.69 per share.</p><p>1971 was a big year. The Intel employee head count hit 460, the 4004 became available, the 1103 was selling well, and the company released the 1601 in January. The 1601 was the first commercially available PROM built on P-channel silicon gate MOS. The company also began selling fully assembled circuit boards populated with memory chips for mainframes and minicomputers. Intel completed the build out a new headquarters of 78,000 square feet in Santa Clara providing them about three times the space they had previously. This, naturally, allowed them to dramatically increase production. Unlike the previous location, the Santa Clara location had chemical and solvent disposal systems in place from day one preventing this from later becoming a superfund site. In September, Intel released the first EPROM, the 1701. This was an improvement over the 1601 in that it could be reprogrammed. The package had a black plastic cover over the chip. With that cover removed, shining ultra violet light on the chip would erase it and allow it to be programmed again. All of these factors combined allowed Intel to post its first profit at $1,015,080 on revenues of $9,411,821. Share holders saw $0.17 earned on each share.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.abortretry.fail/p/the-q1\" rel=\"\">Q1 Corporation</a></p><p>Of course, Intel now had Faggin. Immediately after wrapping up the 4004, he was tasked with bringing this new 8bit design into the world, and essentially all of the problems from the 4004 project were present. The design wasn‚Äôt great, he had very little time, and he had very little staff. The 1201 became the Intel 8008 which was made available commercially in April of 1972. The 8008 was an 8 bit CPU with a 14 bit address width. It was manufactured on a 10 micron process and built of 3500 transistors. It was packaged in an 18-pin DIP, which resulted in 30 TTL chips being required to interface memory and I/O. This packaging was dictated by Grove and Vad√°sz despite protest against it and meant that the chip did not perform as well as it could have otherwise. The 8008 could achieve around 29,000 operations per second. True to his word, Alroy bought a bunch of 8008s and delivered the world‚Äôs first complete, pre-assembled, commercially produced, microcomputer system to the Litcom Division of Litton Industries on Long Island on the 11th of December in 1972.</p><p>In June of 1973, Intel introduced the Intellec 4 and the Intellec 8 microcomputers at the National Computer Conference in the New York Coliseum. These were sold to software and hardware developers in limited numbers. For the Intellec 8, the price started at $2395. These machines had resident monitors in ROM and they had a PL/M compiler (also a new product). The Intellec series supported a teletype at 110 baud, paper tape, and glass teletypes at 1200 baud. The Intellec 4 shipped with 1K RAM and could support up to 4K instruction RAM. Data memory was just 320 4bit words, and could be expanded to 2560 words. The 8, on the other hand, shipped with 5K RAM and could support up to 16K. These machines were offered either as boards or as fully assembled rack-mountable units with front panel and power supply. The fully assembled systems weighed in at 31 pounds.</p><p>Shortly after the release of the 8008, Federico Faggin began pushing for a new general purpose processor that wouldn‚Äôt have the same limitations as the 8008. Intel had developed a new N-channel MOS process for 4K DRAM, and this is what Faggin wanted to use. He also wanted a new bus architecture, a new interrupt structure, more instructions, and a 40-pin DIP; all while keeping the chip source-code compatible with the 8008. He wanted the instruction cycle time to be 2 microseconds which would put the product within the realm occupied by minicomputers. Approval took time but once he had it, Faggin hired Masatoshi Shima to help with logic design and firmware. </p><p>Throughout 1973, the company introduced various memory chips, support chips for memories and processors, and even an LCD driver. Revenues for the year were $65,593,000 and profit was $9,214,000 or $2.12 per share.</p><p><em>The 4004 and 8008 suggested it, but the 8080 made it real</em></p><p><a href=\"https://www.abortretry.fail/p/the-last-word-in-integrated-logic\" rel=\"\">Zilog</a></p><p>Despite a rough second half of the year, Intel still faced little danger. All of their debts had been paid, they owned their facilities with no mortgages, they owned all of their production equipment, and they required no equity financing having nearly $2 million in cash. In December of 1974, the company announced that Gordon Moore would become president and CEO, Robert Noyce would become chairman of the board, Arthur Rock would become vice chairman, Ed Gelbach would become senior vice president and general manager of the components division, Jack Carsten the vice president of marketing, Gene Flath the vice president of manufacturing, Les Vad√°sz the vice president of engineering, and finally, Andrew Grove would become executive vice president.

His response: ‚ÄúIf it happens, it won‚Äôt be a smart contract, it‚Äôll be an operational security issue.‚Äù</p><p>Today, that prediction was validated.</p><p>On February 21, 2025, cryptocurrency exchange <a href=\"https://x.com/gauthamzzz/status/1893004593979859410\">Bybit suffered the largest cryptocurrency theft</a> in history when attackers stole approximately $1.5B from their multisig cold storage wallet. At this time, it appears the attackers compromised multiple signers‚Äô devices, manipulated what signers saw in their wallet interface, and collected the required signatures while the signers believed they were conducting routine transactions.</p><p>This hack is one of many that represent a dramatic shift in how centralized exchanges are compromised. For years, the industry has focused on hardening code and improving their technical security practices, but as the ecosystem‚Äôs secure development life cycle has matured, attackers have shifted to targeting the human and operational elements of cryptocurrency exchanges and other organizations.</p><p>These attacks reveal an escalating pattern, with each compromise building on the last:</p><p>In each case, the attackers didn‚Äôt exploit smart contract or application-level vulnerabilities. Instead, they compromised the computers used to manage those systems using sophisticated malware to manipulate what users saw versus what they actually signed.</p><h2>The DPRK‚Äôs Cryptocurrency Theft Infrastructure</h2><p>The attack chain typically begins with <a href=\"https://github.blog/security/vulnerability-research/security-alert-social-engineering-campaign-targets-technology-industry-employees/\">aggressive social engineering campaigns</a> targeting multiple employees simultaneously within an organization. The RGB identifies key personnel in system administration, software development, and treasury roles, then creates detailed pretexts - often elaborate job recruitment schemes - customized to each target‚Äôs background and interests. These aren‚Äôt mass phishing campaigns; they‚Äôre meticulously crafted approaches designed to compromise specific individuals with access to critical systems.</p><p>What makes these attacks particularly concerning is their repeatability. The RGB has built a sophisticated cross-platform toolkit that can:</p><ul><li>Operate seamlessly across Windows, MacOS, and various wallet interfaces</li><li>Show minimal signs of compromise while maintaining persistence</li><li>Function as backdoors to execute arbitrary commands</li><li>Download and execute additional malicious payloads</li><li>Manipulate what users see in their interfaces</li></ul><p><a href=\"https://github.com/tayvano/lazarus-bluenoroff-research\">Each successful compromise</a> has allowed the RGB to refine their tools and techniques. They‚Äôre not starting from scratch with each target - they‚Äôre executing a tested playbook that‚Äôs specifically engineered to defeat standard cryptocurrency security controls when those controls are used in isolation.</p><p>Organizations below a certain security threshold are now at serious risk. Without comprehensive security controls including:</p><ul><li>Air-gapped signing systems</li><li>Multiple layers of transaction verification</li><li>Endpoint detection and response (EDR) systems like CrowdStrike or SentinelOne</li><li>Regular security training and war games</li></ul><p>They are likely to face an adversary that has already built and tested the exact tools needed to defeat their existing protections.</p><h2>The New Reality of Cryptocurrency Security</h2><p>This attack highlights a fundamental truth: no single security control, no matter how robust, can protect against sophisticated attackers targeting operational security. While secure code remains crucial, it must be part of a comprehensive security strategy.</p><p>Organizations must adopt new processes and controls that operate under the assumption that their infrastructure will eventually face compromise:</p><ol><li><strong>Infrastructure Segmentation:</strong> Critical operations like transaction signing require both physical and logical separation from day-to-day business operations. This isolation ensures that a breach of corporate systems cannot directly impact signing infrastructure. Critical operations should use dedicated hardware, separate networks, and strictly controlled access protocols.</li><li> Security controls must work in concert - hardware wallets, multi-signature schemes, and transaction verification tools each provide important protections, but true security emerges from their coordinated operation. Organizations need multiple, overlapping controls that can detect and prevent sophisticated attacks.</li><li><strong>Organizational Preparedness:</strong> Technical controls must be supported by comprehensive security programs that include:<ul><li>Thorough threat modeling incorporating both technical and operational risks</li><li>Regular third-party security assessments of infrastructure and procedures</li><li>Well-documented and frequently tested incident response plans</li><li>Ongoing security awareness training tailored to specific roles</li><li>War games and attack simulations that test both systems and personnel</li></ul></li></ol><p>These principles aren‚Äôt new - they represent hard-won lessons from years of security incidents in both traditional finance and cryptocurrency. Trail of Bits has consistently advocated for this comprehensive approach to security, providing concrete guidance through several key publications:</p><p>These publications show a clear pattern that‚Äôs echoed by recent attacks: sophisticated attackers are increasingly targeting operational security vulnerabilities rather than technical flaws.</p><p>The cryptocurrency industry‚Äôs resistance to implementing traditional corporate security controls, combined with the high value of potential targets and this group‚Äôs sophisticated capabilities, suggests these attacks are likely to continue unless significant changes are made to how cryptocurrency companies approach operational security.</p><p>The Bybit hack marks a new era in cryptocurrency security. Industry participants need to recognize the evolving threat landscape and invest additional resources in improving their operational security. No one understands this reality better than the security researchers who have been tracking these attacks.</p><p>Tay <a href=\"https://twitter.com/tayvano_/status/1847877033701122395\">@tayvano_</a>, a renowned security researcher known for exposing on-chain thefts, dissecting DPRK crypto hacks, and fiercely advocating for better blockchain security practices, summarized the current reality bluntly:</p><blockquote><p>For all these reasons and more, it‚Äôs my opinion that once they get on your device, you‚Äôre fucked. The end.\nIf your keys are hot or in AWS, they fuck you immediately.\nIf they aren‚Äôt, they work slightly harder to fuck you.\nBut no matter what, you‚Äôre going to get fucked.</p></blockquote><p>Organizations must protect themselves through a comprehensive defense strategy combining isolation, verification, detection, and robust operational security controls. However, the time for basic security measures has passed. Organizations holding significant cryptocurrency assets must take immediate action:</p><ul><li>Implement dedicated, air-gapped signing infrastructure</li><li>Engage with security teams experienced in defending against sophisticated state actors</li><li>Build and regularly test incident response plans</li></ul><p>The next billion-dollar hack isn‚Äôt a matter of if, but when.

Some of us made home recordings with our sibling and grandparents ‚Äì precious childhood snippets. </p><p>And a few of us even have recordings from that time we travelled to a village in Vanuatu, some 40 years ago, and heard the locals performing in a language that no longer exists.</p><p>In the field of linguistics, such recordings are beyond priceless ‚Äì yet often out of reach, due to the degradation of old cassettes over time. With a new tool, we are able to repair those tapes, and in doing so can recover the stories, songs and memories they hold. </p><h2>A digital humanities telescope</h2><p>Our digital archive, <a href=\"https://paradisec.org.au\">PARADISEC</a> (Pacific and Regional Archive for Digital Sources in Endangered Cultures) contains thousands of hours of audio ‚Äì mainly from musicological or linguistic fieldwork. This audio represents some 1,360 languages, with a major focus on languages of the Pacific and Papua New Guinea. </p><p>The PARADISEC research project was started in 2003 as a collaboration between the universities of Melbourne and Sydney, and the Australian National University. </p><p>Like a humanities telescope, PARADISEC allows us to learn more about the language diversity around us, as we explained in a 2016 <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/the-race-to-digitise-language-records-of-the-pacific-region-before-it-is-too-late-55568#comment_988678\">Conversation article</a>.</p><p>While many of the tapes we get are in good condition and can be readily played and digitised, others need special care, and the removal of mould and dirt.</p><p>We work with colleagues at agencies such as the Solomon Islands National Museum, for whom we recently repaired a set of cassettes that were previously unplayable and just screeched. We‚Äôll be taking those cassettes, now repaired and digitised, back to Honiara in February and expect to pick up more for further treatment. </p><p>Screeching happens when a tape is dried out and can‚Äôt move through the mechanism easily. The screeching covers the audio signal we want to capture. </p><p>In 2019, my colleague Sam King built (with the help of his colleague Doug Smith) a cassette-lubricating machine while working at the Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies. This machine ‚Äì likely the first of its kind in Australia ‚Äì allowed us to play many previously unplayable tapes.</p><p>Last year, Sam built two versions of an updated machine called the LM-3032 Tape Restorator for PARADISEC, improving on the previous model. Between hand building some parts, 3D printing others and writing code for the controllers, it took him more than a year.</p><h2>Preserving culture and heritage</h2><p>The LM-3032 Tape Restorator works by applying cyclomethicone (a silicone-based solvent used in cosmetics) to the length of a tape. This leaves behind an extremely thin film of lubrication that allows smoother playback, making digitisation possible. See more details <a href=\"https://www.paradisec.org.au/blog/2025/01/the-tape-restorator/\">here</a>.</p><p>Tests have shown this process has no negative long-term effects on the tape.

For many languages, these may be the only known recordings ‚Äì stored on a single cassette, in a single location, and virtually inaccessible.

Wilson cede creative oversight of their family's storied James Bond franchise to Amazon MGM Studios, sources tell us. Amazon originally overpaid on its purchase of MGM in a deal orchestrated by then-MGM board chair Kevin Ulrich. Though valued between $3.5 billion-$4 billion, the legendary motion picture studio was absorbed by the streamer for $8.5 billion, the hefty sum propped up by the potential access of the 007 franchise. However, Amazon couldn't fully freely develop Bond with Broccoli and Wilson in the mix. Hence, it took another $1 billion to ensure that they could fully steer and exploit the Ian Fleming IP. \nThe article suggests Broccoli's long hold-out came from \"Amazon's desire to expand the James Bond franchise into its own universe akin to Marvel or Star Wars.\"\nIn the past, filmmakers including Quentin Tarantino and Christopher Nolan have expressed an interest in putting their stamp on Bond; both however, required complete creative control, which wasn't possible under the reign of Broccoli and Wilson. Now, with the producers on the side, Amazon can move forward to attract a top-tier director. \n\nAlso available to come to life in the new deal finally are a slew of Bond villains and women in their own series or features. The last time an attempt was made to spin off the Bond franchise was in 2003 with a stand-alone movie about the spy's girlfriend Jinx, played by Halle Berry in Die Another Day. Bond scribes Neal Purvis and Rob Wade were attached to pen that, with Stephen Frears circling, but Broccoli and Wilson put the kibosh to the idea due to creative differences. \nIn a related note, the article adds that Amazon \"is looking to have an international theatrical distribution arm fully operational by some time in 2026.\" \n\nJeff Bezos asked his followers on X.com who should play James Bond in the next movie, reports IGN, \"and the answer was loud and clear.\" On X.com the \"clear fan favorite\" was DC Extended Universe actor Henry Cavill. (Besides playing Superman, Cavill also appeared in the 2024 film spy action-comedy Argyle, and fought Tom Cruise's character in 2018's Mission Impossible: Fallout ‚Äî and played Geralt of Rivia in the Netflix series The Witcher.)","contentLength":2304,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"windows firewall for local Go web app","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1ivmbtd/windows_firewall_for_local_go_web_app/","date":1740241115,"author":"/u/jeevanism","guid":9298,"unread":true,"content":"<p>Every time I start my Go web app locally on Windows, I get a firewall error (see screenshot).

On February 22, the company unveiled this new platform, touting speeds ten times faster than ChatGPT and positioning OCEAN as a truly transformative solution in both B2C and B2B markets. From blazing response times to a broad feature set that includes voice interaction and a commitment to decentralization, OCEAN represents a major leap forward in how users worldwide can engage with AI.</p><p>\\\nOCEAN‚Äôs speed and real-time response capabilities are central to its unique value. Ahmad Shadid, Founder of O and IO, explains that one of the reasons for such swift performance is the adoption of Cerebras‚Äôs cutting-edge hardware.</p><p>\\\n\"<em>The Cerebras CS-3 chip, known as the Wafer Scale Engine (WSE-3), has 900,000 AI-optimized cores and four trillion transistors on a single chip. Traditional GPU-based systems often require complex orchestration and distributed programming to handle large models, but the Cerebras approach offers simplicity and scalability.</em>\" ‚Äì claims Shadid.</p><p>\\\nCerebras can scale from one billion to 24 trillion parameters without requiring code changes, freeing users from the delays commonly associated with AI assistants. With 21 PB/s of memory bandwidth, Cerebras-based processing provides low-latency, high-efficiency performance that far surpasses traditional GPU systems.</p><p>\\\nWhile speed and performance are crucial, OCEAN brings more than just high-octane AI. Shadid refers to OCEAN as ‚Äúthe world‚Äôs fastest AI search engine,‚Äù emphasizing that beyond raw computational power, the platform delivers a sleek, intuitive user experience. This includes a voice interaction system that will allow users to speak their prompts directly to ‚ÄúMiss O,‚Äù who can respond in audio format. This conversational style, along with advanced AI agent capabilities slated for future versions, puts OCEAN on a path that goes beyond just answering text-based queries.</p><p>\\\nFrom a product standpoint, OCEAN adopts a dual approach, serving both individual consumers and enterprises. For users who simply want a next-level AI-powered search engine, the app offers quick responses, privacy-focused features, and a decentralized framework to ensure data security. For business clients, OCEAN plans to roll out an API service powered by the very same Cerebras infrastructure that underpins its consumer operations.</p><p>\\\nThe O community has gained exclusive access to the closed testnet of the OCEAN Assistant, and initial tests  it may run up to 20 times faster than popular AI services like ChatGPT and DeepSeek. X is already flooded with dozens of comparison videos demonstrating the remarkable speed difference, prompting widespread excitement and curiosity about the assistant‚Äôs capabilities.</p><p>\\\nIn the next five years, O.XYZ envisions OCEAN becoming a fully integrated platform with advanced routing intelligence. The proprietary ‚ÄúO Routing Intelligence‚Äù (ORI), developed by O.RESEARCH, will dynamically route subtasks to the most suitable model, whether it is an open-source option or a specialized AI for more complex requirements. ORI will help optimize costs without compromising speed or accuracy. This first-of-its-kind technology lays the groundwork for building a massive AI library featuring hundreds of thousands of models. Over time, this expansion is expected to bring OCEAN closer to artificial general intelligence (AGI), while still emphasizing security and user data ownership. With ORI, the team presents a unified intelligence technology similar to the one that OpenAI  this February. ORI will select from over 100,000 open-source models, routing tasks to the best one in real time. ORI will be integrated into OCEAN in spring 2025.</p><p>\\\nORI will be the central hub for AI innovation, seamlessly integrating multiple AI models into a unified intelligence. Through its integration with OCEAN, users will effortlessly harness the power of diverse AI models in one place.</p><p> aims to reshape artificial intelligence by developing systems independent of corporate control.

Clary","guid":9258,"unread":true,"content":"<p>We all think we're good at asking questions.</p><p>\\\nIn reality, most of us are terrible at it.</p><p>\\\nNot because we lack curiosity or intelligence, but because we've been trained to focus on answers. School rewards students who memorize facts, not those who challenge assumptions. Work promotes people who execute known solutions, not those who explore unknown possibilities.</p><p>\\\nYet, look at anyone who has achieved extraordinary results in any field. <strong>The difference between good and great isn't in having more answers‚Äîit's in asking better questions.</strong></p><p>\\\nWhen Elon Musk questioned why rockets cost so much, he didn't start by studying aerospace engineering. He started by breaking down the raw material costs of rockets and asking why each component was so expensive. This fundamental questioning led to SpaceX revolutionizing the space industry.</p><p>\\\nThe same pattern shows up everywhere. Jeff Bezos asked why people couldn't buy any book they wanted instantly. Steve Jobs asked why computers couldn't be beautiful and intuitive. They didn't begin with solutions. They began with questions that challenged basic assumptions.</p><p>\\\nBut here's what nobody tells you about questions.</p><p>\\\n<em>They're not just tools for learning‚Äîthey're tools for transformation.</em></p><p>\\\nThe right question can instantly shift your perspective. It can take a problem that seemed impossible and make the solution obvious. It can turn confusion into clarity. Overwhelm into focus. Stagnation into momentum.</p><p>\\\n<strong>The quality of your life is directly proportional to the quality of questions you regularly ask yourself.</strong></p><p>\\\nThink about that for a second.</p><p>\\\nWhat questions do you ask yourself when you wake up? When you face a challenge? When you're stuck? When you're deciding what to do with your time?</p><p>\\\nMost people unconsciously ask questions that keep them trapped. Questions like \"Why is this happening to me?\" or \"What if I fail?\" or \"What will others think?\"</p><p>\\\nThese questions program your brain to look for evidence of problems, failures, and judgments. They create a self-fulfilling prophecy of mediocrity.</p><p>\\\nThe path to extraordinary results starts with extraordinary questions.</p><p>Your mind is running on questions whether you realize it or not.</p><p>\\\nThink of questions as lines of code in your mental software. Some questions create bugs in your thinking. Others unlock new capabilities you didn't know you had.</p><p>\\\n<strong>Most people are running on default questions they never chose to install.</strong></p><p>\\\nThese are the mental programs you inherited from parents, teachers, and society. They might have served a purpose once, but now, they're outdated. Running in the background. Draining your mental energy and limiting your potential.</p><p>\\\nWant to spot the questions running your life? Look at your results.</p><p>\\\nIf you're constantly stressed about money, you might be running questions like \"How can I avoid going broke?\" Instead of \"How can I create more value?\"</p><p>\\\nIf your relationships are unfulfilling, you might be asking \"Why don't people understand me?\" Instead of \"How can I understand others more deeply?\"</p><p>\\\n<em>Questions shape reality by directing your focus.</em></p><p>\\\nWhen you ask better questions, you literally upgrade your mental operating system. Your brain starts noticing opportunities it was blind to before. Solutions appear that were invisible when you were asking surface-level questions.</p><p>\\\nThis isn't just theory. It's how breakthroughs happen.</p><p>\\\nBreaking through plateaus in any area comes down to asking questions nobody else is asking. Questions that challenge core assumptions. Questions that reframe the entire problem.</p><p>\\\n<strong>The gap between 1x and 1000x performance isn't in having more answers. It's in having better questions.</strong></p><p>Let's talk about returns.</p><p>\\\nMost people play small because they ask small questions. They stay stuck at 1x thinking because their questions never challenge their fundamental assumptions about what's possible.</p><p>\\\nThe jump from 1x to 10x starts with questions that break limiting patterns.</p><p>\\\nInstead of asking \"How can I get more clients?\" you ask \"Why do clients need what I'm selling in the first place?\" This simple shift can reveal entire markets you were missing.</p><p>\\\n<em>The 10x to 100x leap happens when your questions reframe the entire game.</em></p><p>\\\nThis is where you stop asking \"How can I be the best player?\" and start asking \"How can I change the rules?\" These questions break you out of competition and into creation.</p><p>\\\n<strong>But the real magic happens in the jump from 100x to 1000x.</strong></p><p>\\\nThis is where Lady Luck enters the picture. But luck isn't random - it's attracted to certain types of questions.</p><p>\\\nQuestions that combine fields nobody has combined before. Questions that challenge assumptions are so basic that nobody sees them as assumptions. Questions that make people uncomfortable because they threaten the status quo.</p><p>\\\nWarren Buffett didn't just ask \"What stocks should I buy?\" He asked, \"What businesses are so fundamental to society that they'll be valuable for the next 50 years?\" This question led him to invest in Coca-Cola, American Express, and other companies that have generated astronomical returns.</p><p>\\\nWhen everyone else is asking \"How can I compete?\" you need to be asking \"What game should I be playing instead?\"</p><p>\\\n<em>The right question doesn't just solve problems - it eliminates them entirely.</em></p><p>Most people think asking better questions is about being smarter.</p><p>\\\nIt's about being more precise.</p><p>\\\n<strong>Vague questions create vague results.</strong> When you ask \"How can I be more successful?\" your brain has nothing concrete to work with. It's like trying to build a house without blueprints.</p><p>\\\nBut ask \"What specific skills would make me irreplaceable in my industry?\" and your mind immediately starts generating actionable insights.</p><p>\\\nThis is the art of question architecture.</p><p>\\\nStart with \"what\" instead of \"why.\" \"Why\" questions often lead to rationalizations and excuses. \"What\" questions lead to observations and actions.</p><p>\\\n\"Why am I stuck?\" becomes \"What small step would create momentum?\" \"Why don't I have enough time?\" becomes \"What am I currently spending time on that doesn't serve my goals?\"</p><p>\\\n<em>The more specific your question, the more useful the answer.</em></p><p>\\\nYour internal dialogue is just a series of questions and answers. Most people let this run on autopilot. But when you consciously architect your questions, you transform your mental landscape.</p><p>\\\nThink of questions as doorways. A poorly designed doorway leads to a closet. A well-designed doorway opens into a universe of possibilities.</p><p>\\\n<strong>The goal isn't to find the one perfect question. It's to develop a framework for generating better questions.</strong></p><p>\\\nThis is how you turn confusion into clarity. Overwhelm into action. Stagnation into progress.</p><p>\\\nMaster learners don't just ask better questions. They have a system for generating them.</p><p>\\\nFirst, they recognize that timing matters. <strong>There's a massive difference between asking questions to understand and asking questions to act.</strong></p><p>\\\nUnderstanding questions open up possibilities. Action questions narrow them down.</p><p>\\\nWhen you're exploring a new field, you want broad questions that challenge basic assumptions. \"What if everything I know about this is wrong?\" This creates space for genuine insight.</p><p>\\\nBut when it's time to execute, you need focused questions that drive specific outcomes. \"What's the smallest step I can take right now that makes all other steps easier?\"</p><p>\\\n<em>The key is knowing which mode you're in.</em></p><p>\\\nMost people get stuck because they ask action questions during exploration mode, or exploration questions during action mode. They try to optimize before they understand. Or they keep exploring when they should be executing.</p><p>\\\nMaster learners also build a question database. They collect powerful questions like others collect answers.</p><p>\\\n\"What would this look like if it were easy?\" \"What am I not seeing?\" \"What would I do if I knew I couldn't fail?\"</p><p>\\\nThese aren't just motivational quotes. They're mental tools that break you out of limited thinking patterns.</p><p>\\\n<strong>But the real power comes from creating your own questions.</strong></p><p>\\\nQuestions that address your specific blindspots. Questions that challenge your deepest assumptions. Questions that force you to think in new ways.</p><p>Here's what most people miss about questions.</p><p>\\\nThey're not just tools for solving problems. They're tools for living.</p><p>\\\n<strong>Questions determine how you experience reality itself.</strong></p><p>\\\nWhen you ask \"What's wrong with my life?\" you'll find endless problems. When you ask \"What's working in my life?\" you'll find endless opportunities. Both questions reveal truth, but they reveal different truths.</p><p>\\\nThis isn't positive thinking. It's about understanding how your mind constructs reality.</p><p>\\\nEvery answer closes doors. It settles something. Finalizes it. Puts it in a box. But . They create possibilities that didn't exist before.</p><p>\\\nSmart people often fall into the trap of being \"answer-oriented.\" They pride themselves on knowing things. On being right. On having it figured out.</p><p>\\\nBut wisdom comes from maintaining a state of question.</p><p>\\\nThink about it. The most profound experiences in life don't come from finding answers. They come from encountering better questions.</p><p>\\\nQuestions that make you reevaluate everything. Questions that expand your sense of what's possible. Questions that connect you to something larger than yourself.</p><p>\\\n<strong>The goal isn't to eliminate uncertainty. It's to get better at dancing with it.</strong></p><p>\\\nLife becomes more interesting when you stop demanding answers and start embracing questions. When you stop trying to be certain and start getting curious.</p><p>You're probably wondering what to do with all this.</p><p>\\\nTake the questions you ask yourself every day and upgrade them. Don't try to force massive changes. Just make them slightly better.</p><p>\\\n<strong>Small shifts in your questions create massive shifts in your life.</strong></p><p>\\\nInstead of asking \"What do I have to do today?\" ask \"What's the most important thing I could accomplish today?\"</p><p>\\\nPay attention to warning signs of poor questions. When you feel stuck, stressed, or overwhelmed, pause and notice what questions are</p><p>running through your mind.</p><p>\\\nAre they empowering or limiting? Are they specific or vague? Are they opening new possibilities or closing them off?</p><p>\\\n<em>The beauty of questions is that you can change them instantly.</em></p><p>\\\nYour brain is like a search engine. It will find answers to whatever questions you feed it. Feed it better questions, and you'll get better answers.</p><p>\\\nBut there's something even more powerful at work here.</p><p>\\\nQuestions compound. Each better question leads to better insights, which leads to better questions. It's an upward spiral of understanding and capability.</p><p>\\\n<strong>This is how you future-proof yourself.</strong></p><p>\\\nIn a world of artificial intelligence and rapid change, the ability to ask better questions becomes increasingly valuable. AI can give you answers, but it can't tell you what questions to ask.</p><p>\\\nThat's where the real opportunity lies.</p><p>\\\nNot in having all the answers, but in knowing how to find the questions that matter.</p>","contentLength":10903,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Despite 2024 Layoffs, Tech Jobs Expected to Take Off","url":"https://spectrum.ieee.org/tech-jobs","date":1740240003,"author":"Gwendolyn Rak","guid":9200,"unread":true,"content":"<p>Big data and AI specialist roles are expanding rapidly</p>","contentLength":54,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81NjU2Mjc1OS9vcmlnaW4ucG5nIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc0OTA5MTQ5OX0.INl7Nce1q6TXLdMcV5dbkJPmcPgnRjMqUxidu7HD8yw/image.png?width=600","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Torvalds: Rust Kernel Code Isn't Forced In Over Maintainers' Objections","url":"https://linux.slashdot.org/story/25/02/22/0524210/torvalds-rust-kernel-code-isnt-forced-in-over-maintainers-objections?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&utm_medium=feed","date":1740239640,"author":"EditorDavid","guid":9185,"unread":true,"content":" Linus Torvalds responded Thursday to kernel developer Christoph Hellwig, who had claimed Torvalds merged Rust code into the kernel even over his objections as the original C code's maintainer. Highlights from Torvalds' response:\n\nThe fact is, the pull request you objected to DID NOT TOUCH THE DMA LAYER AT ALL. It was literally just another user of it, in a completely separate subdirectory, that didn't change the code you maintain in _any_ way, shape, or form... Honestly, what you have been doing is basically saying \"as a DMA maintainer I control what the DMA code is used for\". \n\nAnd that is not how *any* of this works. What's next? Saying that particular drivers can't do DMA, because you don't like that device, and as a DMA maintainer you control who can use the DMA code? That's _literally_ exactly what you are trying to do with the Rust code. You are saying that you disagree with Rust ‚Äî which is fine, nobody has ever required you to write or read Rust code. But then you take that stance to mean that the Rust code cannot even use or interface to code you maintain... \n\nYou don't have to like Rust. You don't have to care about it. That's been made clear pretty much from the very beginning, that nobody is forced to suddenly have to learn a new language, and that people who want to work purely on the C side can very much continue to do so. So to get back to the very core of your statement: \n\n \"The document claims no subsystem is forced to take Rust\" \n\nthat is very much true. You are not forced to take any Rust code, or care about any Rust code in the DMA code. You can ignore it... \n\nYou can't have it both ways. You can't say \"I want to have nothing to do with Rust\", and then in the very next sentence say \"And that means that the Rust code that I will ignore cannot use the C interfaces I maintain\".... So when you change the C interfaces, the Rust people will have to deal with the fallout, and will have to fix the Rust bindings. That's kind of the promise here: there's that \"wall of protection\" around C developers that don't want to deal with Rust issues in the promise that they don't *have* to deal with Rust. \n\nBut that \"wall of protection\" basically goes both ways. If you don't want to deal with the Rust code, you get no *say* on the Rust code. Put another way: the \"nobody is forced to deal with Rust\" does not imply \"everybody is allowed to veto any Rust code\".\n \nTorvalds also made sure to add some kind remarks, including \"I respect you technically, and I like working with you.\"","contentLength":2522,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"How to implement dynamic storage provisioning for onPrem cluster","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/kubernetes/comments/1ivlitx/how_to_implement_dynamic_storage_provisioning_for/","date":1740239019,"author":"/u/Impossible_Nose_2956","guid":9237,"unread":true,"content":"<p>Hi I have setup Onprem cluster for dev qa and preprod environments onPrem.</p><p>And I use redis, rabbitmq, mqtt, sqlite(for celery) in the cluster.

I‚Äôm speaking, of course, about hot Jupiters, a class of planets that takes the concept of ‚Äúinhospitable‚Äù to dazzling and creative new levels, and which had an epic news week.</p><p>Then, what did scientists find in cores taken from deep-sea trenches? The answer might surprise you. Next, mice administer ‚Äúfirst aid.‚Äù Last, fish can see you for who you really are (though yummy treats will certainly not be refused).&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Hot Jupiters Are So Hot Right Now (and at All Other Times)</strong></p><p>Hot Jupiters are the low-hanging fruit of exoplanet discoveries. As the name implies, they are Jupiter-sized worlds that orbit extremely close to their stars, a proximity that makes them‚Äîyou guessed it‚Äîhot.&nbsp;</p><p>Given that they are both giant in scale and have short years lasting only hours or days, hot Jupiters are the easiest exoplanets to spot, which is why our catalog of distant worlds is packed with them. In fact, a study came out <a href=\"https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/full_html/2025/02/aa51693-24/aa51693-24.html?ref=404media.co\"></a> that identified seven new ones.</p><p>But while it‚Äôs not all that novel to discover these worlds (which is kind of amazing in itself), scientists have now peered deep into the atmosphere of the hot Jupiter WASP-121, nicknamed Tylos, which is about 850 light years from Earth. It‚Äôs the first time several distinct atmospheric layers and processes have been observed on an exoplanet.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>‚ÄúUltra-hot Jupiters, an extreme class of planets not found in our solar system, provide a unique window into atmospheric processes,‚Äù said researchers led by Julia Seidel of the European Southern Observatory (ESO). ‚ÄúHere we show a dramatic shift in atmospheric circulation in an ultra-hot Jupiter‚Äù including ‚Äúthe first vertical characterization of a high-altitude, super-rotational atmospheric jet stream.‚Äù&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Tylos is slightly bigger than Jupiter, but it is so close to its star that its year lasts only 30 hours. As a consequence, it is tidally locked, meaning that one side is always facing the star, and the other always faces away. The star-lit side is about 2,300¬∞C (4,200¬∞F) which is, as advertised, quite hot. Using the ESO‚Äôs Very Large Telescope, the researchers spotted the aforementioned equatorial jet stream and saw flows of hot gas moving from the hot day side to the cooler night side‚Äîwhich is still pretty hot at around 700¬∞C (1,340¬∞F).&nbsp;</p><p>The weather report on Tylos is permanently fatal with a chance of titanium rain, according to a third <a href=\"https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/full_html/2025/02/aa52405-24/aa52405-24.html?ref=404media.co\"><u>study that came out this week</u></a> (that‚Äôs a hot Jupiter hat-trick). Taken together, the research represents a new emerging era of exoplanet observations in which astronomers can peek under the hood of these distant atmospheres and start to get a real vertical cross-section of otherworldly skies.&nbsp;</p><p>Down the line, this will lead to better characterizations of the atmospheres of potentially habitable exoplanets, which could contain detectable signs of alien life. But for now, on this late winter weekend, let's be satisfied with warming ourselves&nbsp; into certain oblivion in the bellies of hot Jupiters.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>From the Hadal to the Grave&nbsp;</strong></p><p>To cool off, we shall now dive straight into the deepest parts of the ocean, the hadal zone, where strange things are inherently afoot. Scientists took sediment cores from seafloors at depths of over 4.6 miles in the Japan Trench which is, in my opinion, asking for trouble. But in this case, the results revealed an activity that you might not expect to find in one of the most inhospitable places on Earth‚Äîfarming.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>I should just say, the ‚Äúfarmers‚Äù are probably invertebrates, like sea cucumbers or bivalves, that cultivate microbes that help break down organic matter for them. Still, a basic form of ‚Äúagrichnial‚Äù farming is preserved in trace fossils, like burrows, the team found in the cores.&nbsp;</p><p>‚ÄúThe hadal zone, &gt;6‚Äâkm deep, remains one of the least understood ecosystems on Earth,‚Äù said researchers led by Jussi Hovikoski of the Geological Survey of Finland. The cores open a rare window into this otherworldly region and reveal ‚Äúslender spiral, lobate and deeply penetrating straight and ramifying burrow systems‚Ä¶interpreted to include burrows of microbe farming and chemosymbiotic invertebrates.‚Äù&nbsp;</p><p>The study also gets points for its title, ‚ÄúBioturbation in the hadal zone,‚Äù which sounds like an early aughts prog rock album. \\m/&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Somebody Call an EMT! (Emergency Mouse Technician)</strong></p><p>Humans produce a lot of selfish psychos, if you hadn‚Äôt noticed, but one nice thing about our species is we generally share a prosocial instinct to help people during a medical crisis. As it turns out, we‚Äôre not alone in this behavior, according to a new study that monitored the reactions of mice to ailing, unconscious, or dead conspecifics.&nbsp;</p><p>‚ÄúAnecdotal observations across several species in the wild, including nonhuman primates, dolphins, and elephants have reported intriguing behaviors of animals toward unresponsive conspecifics that have collapsed because of sickness, injury, or death,‚Äù said researchers led by&nbsp; Wenjian Sun of the University of Southern California. ‚ÄúThese animals‚Ä¶display various behavioral responses, including touching, grooming, nudging, and sometimes even more intense physical actions, such as striking, toward the collapsed peers. Some of these actions toward incapacitated conspecifics are reminiscent of human emergency responses, especially those involving sensory stimulation.‚Äù</p><p>To bring these anecdotal reports in an experimental setting, the team videotaped mice responding to cagemates that had been anesthetized into unconsciousness, as well as their reactions&nbsp; to dead mice. The r mice interacted with unconscious cage-mates&nbsp; about ten times as much as with an active partner, and may have even performed basic versions of first aid.</p><p>‚ÄúOur results suggest that the actions of mouth/ tongue biting and tongue pulling may have rescue-like effects, reminiscent of human first aid efforts in reviving unconscious individuals with physical stimulation and airway maintenance,‚Äù the researchers said.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>‚ÄúThe consequences of the behaviors, such as improved airway opening or clearance and expedited recovery, are clearly beneficial to the recipient,‚Äù they added, though they also cautioned that ‚Äúit is challenging to determine the motivational needs behind these distinctive ‚Äòreviving-like‚Äô behaviors.‚Äù&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Familiarity played a strong role in the experiment's outcome; mice heaped much more attention on dead or unconscious cage-mates that they knew well compared to strangers. At the risk of anthropomorphizing, it‚Äôs kind of sad to think about these mice being confronted with their passed-out or dead friends, but the silver lining is an empirical validation of widespread prosocial behaviors.&nbsp;</p><p>I‚Äôm also going to assume it means that the Disney franchise , starring mice humanitarians, is a documentary.</p><p><strong>The Adventures of Left Hump and Friends</strong></p><p>The next time you go for an ocean swim, why not introduce yourself to some neighboring fish? They might learn to recognize you as an individual and start following you around, especially if you give them something nice to eat. That‚Äôs the conclusion of a new study that found fish can tell individual divers apart based on visual cues‚Äîand that they rapidly learn which divers are generous with treats (in this case: shrimp).</p><p>Researchers Ma√´lan Tomasek and Katinka Soller conducted several dives at the STARESO research station in Corsica, France. Soller was the designated shrimp dispenser, and the wild fish ‚Äúvolunteers‚Äù rapidly learned to distinguish her visually from Tomasek, the shrimp miser.</p><p>‚ÄúTwo species voluntarily took part in our experiments: saddled sea bream and black sea bream ,‚Äù said the researchers. ‚ÄúOf specific individuals, the saddled bream (Bernie) was first identified at dive 5 of the training, four black bream at dives 12 (Left Hump), 15 (Kasi), 19 (Alfi), 21 (Julius) and the last black bream (Geraldine) on the first session of experiment 1. Note that this marks the moment from which we were able to reliably identify them (i.e. identify with absolute certainty at each apparition from one dive to the next) but that they most likely appeared several days prior to this.‚Äù</p><p>First of all, fantastic names. I‚Äôm already shipping Julius and Geraldine as a celebrity fish couple called Juladine. Left Hump will officiate the wedding. But setting aside the fish fanfic, the team demonstrated that the fish learned to visually tell the researchers apart, leading to a clear preference for following Soller.&nbsp;</p><p>‚ÄúThe fact that wild bream can discriminate between divers adds scientific evidence to the numerous accounts suggesting differentiated relationships between fish and specific humans,‚Äù the team said. ‚ÄúOur study thus encourages a reappraisal of the methodological avenues to study cognitive abilities of wild fish under natural conditions.‚Äù&nbsp;</p><p>‚ÄúIt also demonstrates a potential difficulty when conducting such experiments that could be disturbed by fish following specific experimenters,‚Äù the researchers said, concluding with an implied wink: ‚ÄúResearchers might not always want to be followed all around by fish, but if they do, they will not be disappointed.‚Äù</p><p>Thanks for reading!
