Despite the stigma that keeps many institutions silent, she found that extremophile \"xerophilic\" molds are quietly spreading through museums and archives, thriving in low-humidity, tightly sealed storage and damaging everything from textiles and wood to manuscripts and stone. An anonymous Slashdot reader shares an excerpt from the article: Mold is a perennial scourge in museums that can disfigure and destroy art and artifacts. [...] Consequently, mold is spoken of in whispers in the museum world. Curators fear that even rumors of an infestation can hurt their institution's funding and blacklist them from traveling exhibitions. When an infestation does occur, it's generally kept secret. The contract conservation teams that museums hire to remediate invasive mold often must vow confidentiality before they're even allowed to see the damage.\n \nBut a handful of researchers, from in-house conservators to university mycologists, are beginning to compare notes about the fungal infestations they've tackled in museum storage depots, monastery archives, crypts and cathedrals. A disquieting revelation has emerged from these discussions: there's a class of molds that flourish in low humidity, long believed to be a sanctuary from decay. By trying so hard to protect artifacts, we've accidentally created the \"perfect conditions for [these molds] to grow,\" says Flavia Pinzari, a mycologist at the Council of National Research of Italy. \"All the rules for conservation never considered these species.\"\n \nThese molds -- called xerophiles -- can survive in dry, hostile environments such as volcano calderas and scorching deserts, and to the chagrin of curators across the world, they seem to have developed a taste for cultural heritage. They devour the organic material that abounds in museums -- from fabric canvases and wood furniture to tapestries. They can also eke out a living on marble statues and stained-glass windows by eating micronutrients in the dust that accumulates on their surfaces. And global warming seems to be helping them spread. Most frustrating for curators, these xerophilic molds are undetectable by conventional means. But now, armed with new methods, several research teams are solving art history cold cases and explaining mysterious new infestations...\n \nThe xerophiles' body count is rising: bruiselike stains on Leonardo da Vinci's most famous self-portrait, housed in Turin. Brown blotches on the walls of King Tut's burial chamber in Luxor. Pockmarks on the face of a saint in an 11th-century fresco in Kyiv. It's not enough to find and identify the mold. Investigators are racing to determine the limits of xerophilic life and figure out which pieces of our cultural heritage are at the highest risk of infestation before the ravenous microbes set in.","contentLength":2963,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Fully Electric Vehicle Sales In EU Overtake Petrol For First Time In December","url":"https://tech.slashdot.org/story/26/01/28/2239249/fully-electric-vehicle-sales-in-eu-overtake-petrol-for-first-time-in-december?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&utm_medium=feed","date":1769652120,"author":"BeauHD","guid":425640,"unread":true,"content":"Longtime Slashdot reader AmiMoJo shares a report from Reuters: Fully electric car sales in December overtook petrol for the first time in the European Union, even as policymakers proposed to loosen emissions regulations, data showed on Tuesday.

ZDNet's Steven Vaughan-Nichols reports: The new \"plan for a plan,\" drafted by longtime kernel contributor Dan Williams, was discussed at the latest Linux Kernel Maintainer Summit in Tokyo, where he introduced it as \"an uplifting subject tied to our eventual march toward death.\" Torvalds added, in our conversation, that \"part of the reason it came up this time around was that my previous contract with Linux Foundation ended Q3 last year, and people on the Linux Foundation Technical Advisory Board had been aware of that. Of course, they were also aware that we'd renewed the contract, but it meant that it had been discussed.\"\n \nThe plan stops short of naming a single heir. Instead, it creates an explicit process for selecting one or more maintainers to take over the top-level Linux repository in a worst-case or orderly-transition scenario, including convening a conclave to weigh options and maximize long-term project health. One maintainer in Tokyo jokingly suggested that the group, like the conclave that selects a new pope, be locked in a room and that a puff of white smoke be sent out when a decision was reached.\n \nThe document frames this as a way to protect against the classic \"bus factor\" problem. That is, what happens to a project if its leader is hit by a bus? Torvalds' central role today means the project currently assumes a bus-factor of one, where a single person's exit could, in theory, destabilize merges and final releases. In practice, as Torvalds and other top maintainers have discussed, the job of top penguin would almost certainly currently go to Greg Kroah-Hartman, the stable-branch Linux kernel maintainer. Responding to the suggestion that the backup replacement would be Greg KH, Torvalds said: \"But the thing is, Greg hasn't always been Greg. Before Greg, there was Andrew Morton and Alan Cox. After Greg, there will be Shannon and Steve. The real issue is you have to have a person or a group of people that the development community can trust, and part of trust is fundamentally about having been around for long enough that people know how you work, but long enough does not mean to be 30 years.\"","contentLength":2335,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"French Lawmakers Vote To Ban Social Media Use By Under-15s","url":"https://mobile.slashdot.org/story/26/01/28/2233210/french-lawmakers-vote-to-ban-social-media-use-by-under-15s?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&utm_medium=feed","date":1769647500,"author":"BeauHD","guid":425614,"unread":true,"content":"French lawmakers have voted to ban social media access for children under 15 and prohibit mobile phones in high schools, positioning France as the second country after Australia to impose sweeping age-based digital restrictions.

It will now go to the Senate, France's upper house, ahead of becoming law. Macron hailed the vote as a \"major step\" to protect French children and teenagers in a post on X. The legislation, which also provides for a ban on mobile phones in high schools, would make France the second country to take such a step following Australia's ban for under-16s in December.

He added that \"social media platforms will then have until December 31 to deactivate existing accounts\" that do not comply with the age limit.

Many&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theiacp.org/resources/document/national-consensus-policy-and-discussion-paper-on-use-of-force\">use-of-force policies</a>&nbsp;adopted by police departments endorse that principle.</p><p>Yet, as in Minneapolis, controversial law enforcement killings continue to occur. Not all agencies have implemented prohibitions on shooting at vehicles. Even in agencies that have, some policies are weak or ambiguous.</p><p>In addition, explicit prohibitions on shooting at vehicles are largely absent from the law, which means that officers responsible for fatal shootings of drivers that appear to violate departmental policies still often&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.wosu.org/news/2025-11-21/blendon-twp-officer-connor-grubb-found-not-guilty-for-fatally-shooting-takiya-young\">escape criminal penalties</a>.</p><p>In the case of ICE, which is part of the Department of Homeland Security, its&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.dhs.gov/publication/2023-update-department-policy-use-force\">policy</a>&nbsp;on shooting at moving vehicles – unlike that of many police agencies – lacks a clear instruction for officers to get out of the way of moving vehicles where feasible. It’s an omission at odds with&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theiacp.org/resources/document/national-consensus-policy-and-discussion-paper-on-use-of-force\">generally recognized best practices</a>&nbsp;in policing.</p><h2>ICE’s policy on shooting at moving vehicles</h2><p>ICE’s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.dhs.gov/publication/2023-update-department-policy-use-force\">current use-of-force policy</a>&nbsp;prohibits its officers from “discharging firearms at the operator of a moving vehicle” unless it is necessary to stop a grave threat. The policy is explicit that deadly force should not be used “solely to prevent the escape of a fleeing suspect.”</p><p>That point is relevant for evaluating the fatal shooting in Minneapolis.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/video/us/100000010631041/minneapolis-ice-shooting-video.html\">Videos show one officer</a>&nbsp;trying to open the door of the vehicle that Good was driving, while another officer appears to be in front of the vehicle as she tried to pull away.</p><p>Shooting to prevent the driver simply from getting away would have been in violation of agency policy and obviously inconsistent with prioritizing the protection of life.</p><p>ICE’s policy lacks clear instruction, however, for its officers to get out of the way of moving vehicles where feasible. In contrast, the Department of Justice’s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/jm/1-16000-department-justice-policy-use-force\">use-of-force policy</a>&nbsp;makes it explicit that officers should not shoot at a vehicle if they can protect themselves by “moving out of the path of the vehicle.”</p><p>Notably, President Joe Biden issued an&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2022/05/31/2022-11810/advancing-effective-accountable-policing-and-criminal-justice-practices-to-enhance-public-trust-and\">executive order in 2022</a>&nbsp;requiring federal law enforcement agencies – like ICE – to adopt use-of-force policies “that are equivalent to, or exceed, the requirements” of the Department of Justice’s policy.</p><p>Despite that order, the provision to step out of the way of moving cars never made it into the use-of-force policy that applies to ICE.</p><h2>The rationale for not shooting at moving vehicles</h2><p>Prioritizing the protection of life doesn’t rule out deadly force. Sometimes such force is necessary to protect lives from a grave threat, such as an active shooter. But it does rule out using deadly force when less harmful tactics can stop a threat. In such cases, deadly force is unnecessary – a key consideration in law and ethics that can render force unjustified.</p><p>That’s the concern involved with police shooting at moving vehicles. It often is not necessary because officers have a less harmful option to avoid a moving vehicle’s threat: stepping out of the way.</p><p>This guidance has the safety of both suspects and police in mind. Obviously, police not shooting lowers the risk of harm to the suspect. But it also lowers the risk to the officer in the vast majority of cases because of the laws of physics. If you shoot the driver of a car barreling toward you, that rarely brings a car to an immediate stop, and the vehicle often continues on its path.</p><p>Many police departments have incorporated these insights into their policies. A recent analysis of police department policies in the 100 largest U.S. cities found that close to three-quarters of them have&nbsp;<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1093/police/paaf004\">prohibitions against shooting at moving vehicles</a>.</p><h2>The gap between policy and best practices for protecting life</h2><p>The shooting in Minneapolis serves as a stark reminder of the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1177/10659129211009596\">stubborn gap</a>&nbsp;that often persists between law and policy on the one hand and best law enforcement practices for protecting life on the other. When steps are taken to close that gap, however, they can have a meaningful impact.</p><p>Some of the most compelling examples involve local, state and federal measures that reinforce one another. Consider the “<a href=\"https://www.annualreviews.org/content/journals/10.1146/annurev-criminol-032317-092409\">fleeing felon rule</a>,” which used to allow police to shoot a fleeing felony suspect to prevent their escape even when the suspect posed no danger to others.</p><p>That rule was at odds with the doctrine of prioritizing the protection of life, leading some departments to revise their use-of-force policies and some states to ban the rule. In 1985, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that it was&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.oyez.org/cases/1984/83-1035\">unconstitutional for police to shoot a fleeing suspect</a>&nbsp;who was not a danger.</p><p>This history suggests that clear bans in law and policy on questionable tactics have the potential to save lives, while also strengthening the means for holding officers accountable.</p>","contentLength":5198,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Please Don't Say Mean Things about the AI I Just Invested a Billion Dollars In","url":"https://www.mcsweeneys.net/articles/please-dont-say-mean-things-about-the-ai-that-i-just-invested-a-billion-dollars-in","date":1769643383,"author":"randycupertino","guid":425598,"unread":true,"content":"—<p>Guys, enough is enough.

Engineers must quickly correlate telemetry data across multiple services, review deployment history, and understand complex application dependencies—all while under pressure to restore service. AWS DevOps Agent changes this paradigm by bringing autonomous investigation capabilities to your operations team, reducing mean time to resolution (MTTR) from hours to minutes.</p><p>However, the effectiveness of AWS DevOps Agent depends heavily on how you configure your Agent Spaces which control resource access boundaries. An Agent Space that’s too narrow misses critical context during investigations. One that’s too broad introduces performance overhead and complexity. This post provides best practices for setting up Agent Spaces that balance investigation capability with operational efficiency, drawing from our experience onboarding early customers and using DevOps agent across our own teams.</p><p>By the end of this post, you’ll understand how to structure Agent Spaces for optimal investigation accuracy, determine the right scope of resource access, and use Infrastructure as Code (IaC) to streamline deployment. Let’s start by understanding the foundational concept that makes all of this possible: the Agent Space itself.</p><h2></h2><p>An Agent Space is a logical container that defines what AWS DevOps Agent can access and investigate. Think of it as the agent’s operational boundary—it determines which cloud accounts the agent can query, which third-party integrations are available, and who can interact with investigations.</p><p>Agent Spaces are critical because AWS DevOps Agent needs sufficient context to perform accurate root cause analysis.</p><p>When an incident occurs, the agent:</p><ol><li>Learns your resources and their relationships across accounts</li><li>Correlates telemetry data from logs, metrics, and traces</li><li>Reviews recent changes including deployments and configuration updates</li><li>Generates and tests hypotheses by querying additional data sources</li></ol><div><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-24923\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/7719a1c782a1ba91c031a682a0a2f8658209adbf/2026/01/28/AgentSpaceTopology.png\" alt=\"This view shows the key resources, entities, and relationships DevOps Agent has selected as a foundation for performing it's task efficently.\" width=\"1340\" height=\"1044\"><p>Figure 1: Agent Space Topology</p></div><p>If the Agent Space doesn’t include access to a critical account or integration, the agent might miss the root cause entirely. Conversely, an overly broad Agent Space introduces performance challenges as the agent considers more resource permutations during investigations.</p><p>Understanding these trade-offs between scope and performance is essential. The question becomes: how do you determine the right boundaries for your specific organization and operational model?”</p><h2></h2><p>We recommend thinking about Agent Space boundaries the same way you think about on-call responsibilities: grant access to accounts relevant to the application, but separate production from non-production environments.</p><p>This approach provides several benefits:</p><ul><li>Familiar mental model – Operations teams already understand on-call boundaries</li><li>Appropriate investigation scope – Mirrors how human engineers would investigate incidents</li><li>Two-way door decision – You can expand or narrow Agent Space scope as needs evolve</li><li>Performance balance – Provides sufficient context without overwhelming the agent</li></ul><h3></h3><p>Start by mapping your application architecture to Agent Space boundaries and consider the following questions:</p><ul><li><strong>What defines a logical application?</strong><ul><li>Does your team own multiple independent applications? If so, create separate Agent Spaces.</li><li>Is it a monolith spanning multiple accounts? Then one Agent Space with cross-account access makes sense.</li></ul></li><li><strong>How do you organize on-call rotations?</strong><ul><li>Separate teams for production versus non-production suggests separate Agent Spaces.</li><li>One team handling all environments might work with one Agent Space per application.</li></ul></li><li><strong>What are your investigation patterns?</strong><ul><li>Do production incidents require querying dependent services in other accounts?

Here are critical patterns to address that we’ve seen customers successfully adopt:</p><p><strong>Pattern 1: Investigations Spanning Multiple Teams. </strong>Large organizations with multiple teams (example: 3 teams managing 100+ production accounts) encounter situations where an issue originates in Team A’s infrastructure but the root cause lies in Team B’s services. The question becomes: how do you enable collaboration across Agent Spaces?</p><p> Create application-specific Agent Spaces that include read-only access to shared resource accounts e.g. dependencies. Establish clear on-call escalation procedures and add them as <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/devopsagent/latest/userguide/about-aws-devops-agent-devops-agent-runbooks.html\">runbooks</a> when investigations identify cross-team root causes for efficient communication (e.g. via chat in <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/devopsagent/latest/userguide/configuring-capabilities-for-aws-devops-agent-connecting-to-ticketing-and-chat-connecting-slack.html\">Slack</a>). Configure the shared service team’s resources with tags identifying which applications use them (example: <code>app-id: ecommerce-frontend</code>). Following a consistent tagging strategy provides investigation context for shared resources while maintaining clear resource ownership.</p><p><strong>Pattern 2: Shared Services and Network Operations Center (NOC) Teams. </strong>Some organizations have centralized teams that provide and support shared infrastructure services (databases, networking, monitoring, security) used by multiple applications across the organization. These NOC or central operations teams need visibility into their services without requiring access to every application’s Agent Space.</p><p> Create a dedicated Agent Space for the shared service team and configure an Agent Space scoped to the shared service team’s infrastructure and operational responsibilities:</p><ul><li>Include AWS accounts containing shared databases, network infrastructure, centralized logging, and monitoring systems</li><li>Add relevant CloudFormation stacks for shared platform services</li><li>Configure IAM roles that provide read-only access to the specific resources the team supports</li><li>Include runbooks and operational procedures specific to the shared services</li></ul><p>This follows the same principle as application-specific Agent Spaces: one Agent Space per on-call team, even when that Agent Space’s scope spans multiple applications. While shared services teams manage specific infrastructure domains, SRE teams often face an even larger challenge: operational responsibility for hundreds or thousands of applications at enterprise scale.</p><p><strong>Pattern 3: Central Operations Teams Managing Many Applications. </strong>Central operations teams responsible for operational tooling across hundreds or thousands of applications can efficiently manage Agent Spaces at scale using Infrastructure as Code.</p><p>Use the AWS <a href=\"https://github.com/aws-samples/sample-aws-devops-agent-cdk\">CDK</a> or <a href=\"https://github.com/aws-samples/sample-aws-devops-agent-terraform\">Terraform</a> samples available as starting points. These samples enable teams to:</p><ul><li>Define a standardized Agent Space template with your organization’s required IAM roles, integrations, resource boundaries and governance tags</li><li>Deploy Agent Spaces programmatically as part of application onboarding workflows</li><li>Enforce compliance through AWS Config rules or service control policies</li><li>Track all Agent Spaces through consolidated billing and tagging (application-id, team, cost-center, environment)</li></ul><p>Central operations teams manage the templates and governance policies, while application teams operate within those guardrails. This approach scales to thousands of applications with consistent configuration and automated deployment.

AWS DevOps Agent requires two distinct sets of IAM permissions: \n  <ul><li><strong>Agent Space role permissions</strong> – The IAM role that AWS DevOps Agent assumes to query your AWS resources, access CloudWatch Logs, and discover topology. This role requires the  managed policy plus additional permissions for AWS Support and expanded capabilities. See the <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/devopsagent/latest/userguide/getting-started-with-aws-devops-agent-cli-onboarding-guide.html\">CLI onboarding guide</a> for the complete role configuration.</li><li><strong>Operator app role permissions</strong> – The IAM role that controls what human operators can do in the AWS DevOps Agent web application, such as starting investigations, viewing results, and creating AWS Support cases. This role is separate from the agent’s investigation permissions.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Service Control Policies (SCPs)</strong> – Verify that your organization’s SCPs allow AWS DevOps Agent API actions. Common issue: Teams complete Agent Space setup but investigations fail because SCPs block  actions or  actions. Review your AWS Organization’s SCPs and add exceptions for DevOps Agent if needed. Note that DevOps Agent and Amazon Bedrock inference are not impacted by policies that restrict customer content to specific AWS regions—Bedrock may use US regions other than US East (N. Virginia) for stateless inference.</li><li> – At minimum, Amazon CloudWatch (automatically available via IAM roles) and Amazon CloudTrail. For comprehensive investigations, integrate Application Performance Monitoring tools like Datadog, Dynatrace, New Relic, Grafana, or Splunk. See <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/devopsagent/latest/userguide/configuring-capabilities-for-aws-devops-agent-connecting-telemetry-sources-index.html\">Connecting telemetry sources</a> for supported integrations.</li><li><strong>Understanding third-party integration configuration</strong> – Some third-party tools require a two-step configuration process: \n  <ul><li><strong>Account-level registration</strong> – Tools that use OAuth (like GitHub, Dynatrace) must first be registered at the AWS account level through the DevOps Agent console. This establishes OAuth credentials that are shared across all Agent Spaces in your account.</li><li><strong>Agent Space-level association</strong> – After registration, each Agent Space individually specifies which resources from that tool to use. For example, after registering GitHub once, Agent Space “EcommerceProd” can associate only production repositories while Agent Space “EcommerceNonProd” associates development repositories.Other tools like Datadog, New Relic, and Splunk can be directly associated with an Agent Space using API keys or tokens without separate account-level registration. CloudWatch requires no additional configuration beyond IAM roles.</li></ul></li><li> – GitHub or GitLab repository access for code context and deployment correlation (optional but highly recommended)</li><li> – AWS CDK (TypeScript/Python), Terraform, AWS CLI, or AWS Management Console for Agent Space deployment</li></ul><p>With prerequisites verified, you’re ready to create your Agent Space and establish the IAM trust relationships that enable investigations.</p><h3></h3><p>AWS DevOps Agent requires IAM roles in each AWS account within the Agent Space boundary. The agent assumes these roles to query CloudWatch Logs, describe resources, and build application topology.</p><p>The AWS DevOps Agent is designed to retrieve operational data from multiple AWS Regions across all AWS accounts that you grant access to within the configured Agent Space, enabling comprehensive visibility into distributed infrastructure and applications regardless of their geographic deployment, while supporting multiple accounts through a configuration process that involves creating IAM roles with appropriate trust policies and permissions in secondary accounts</p><p>Navigate to the <a href=\"https://console.aws.amazon.com/devops-agent/\">AWS DevOps Agent console</a> and choose Create Agent Space and follow the guided setup to create IAM roles in each target account.</p><div><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-24878\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/7719a1c782a1ba91c031a682a0a2f8658209adbf/2026/01/27/DevOpsAgentSpaceSetup-1024x587.png\" alt=\"The Create an Agent Space setup wizard in the AWS Management Console showing Agent Space Details.\" width=\"1024\" height=\"587\"><p>Figure 4: Creating an Agent Space in the Console</p></div><p>The setup wizard helps in configuring cross-account trust relationships.</p><div><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-24881\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/7719a1c782a1ba91c031a682a0a2f8658209adbf/2026/01/27/DevOpsAgent-MultiAccount-1024x701.png\" alt=\"Shows the Agent Space Management Console and in particular the capability to configure your Agent Space to access multiple accounts.\" width=\"1024\" height=\"701\"><p>Figure 5: Multiple account configuration for your Agent Space</p></div><p>We provide sample <a href=\"https://github.com/aws-samples/sample-aws-devops-agent-cdk\">CDK</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/aws-samples/sample-aws-devops-agent-terraform\">Terraform</a> templates that automate Agent Space creation and IAM role deployment across multiple accounts.</p><p><strong>AWS CDK example (TypeScript):</strong></p><pre><code>//If you have many accounts, use a loop:\n\nconst accounts = [\n  { id: '111111111111', name: 'Prod', role: prodRole, stage: 'prod' },\n  { id: '222222222222', name: 'Dev', role: devRole, stage: 'dev' },\n  { id: '333333333333', name: 'Test', role: testRole, stage: 'test' },\n];\n\naccounts.forEach(account =&gt; {\n  const association = new devopsagent.CfnAssociation(this, `${account.name}Association`, {\n    agentSpaceId: agentSpace.ref,\n    serviceId: 'aws',\n    configuration: {\n      aws: {\n        assumableRoleArn: account.role.roleArn,\n        accountId: account.id,\n        accountType: 'monitor'\n      }\n    }\n  });\n\n  association.addDependency(agentSpace);\n  cdk.Tags.of(association).add('stage', account.stage);\n});</code></pre><p>For detailed instructions on setting up IAM roles and permissions across accounts, see the <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/devopsagent/latest/userguide/getting-started-with-aws-devops-agent-cli-onboarding-guide.html\">CLI Onboarding Guide</a>.</p><p>Once your Agent Space exists and has access to AWS accounts, the next critical step is connecting the observability and development tools that provide investigation context beyond AWS native services.</p><h3></h3><p>AWS DevOps Agent investigates incidents by correlating data from multiple sources. The more context available, the more accurate the root cause analysis.</p><p>Recommended integrations by priority:</p><ol><li> – Provides logs, metrics, and traces from AWS services. The agent queries CloudWatch Logs Insights automatically during investigations. No additional configuration is needed if IAM roles are properly configured.</li><li><strong>Application Performance Monitoring tools</strong> – Datadog, Dynatrace, New Relic, and Splunk provide distributed tracing, custom metrics, and application-level context. Configure via Agent Space integrations in the AWS Console.</li><li> – GitHub or GitLab integration enables the agent to review recent deployments and code changes. Requires OAuth or personal access token.</li><li> – GitHub Actions or GitLab workflows help the agent correlate incidents with deployment timing. Configured alongside code repository integration.</li><li> – Slack and ServiceNow integration enables DevOps Agent to post real-time investigation updates to team channels and automatically update incident tickets with findings, root cause analysis, and recommended mitigation steps throughout the investigation lifecycle.</li></ol><p>Beyond built-in integrations, AWS DevOps Agent supports webhook triggered investigations and custom MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers so you can bring-your-own observability tools.</p><p><strong>Webhook configuration for investigation triggers</strong>Webhooks allow external systems (Grafana, Prometheus, PagerDuty, custom monitoring tools) to automatically trigger DevOps Agent investigations when incidents occur. Each Agent Space receives a unique webhook URL that accepts JSON payloads describing the incident.</p><ul><li> Webhooks use HMAC signatures for security. Store the webhook secret in AWS Secrets Manager and rotate it according to your security policies.</li><li> Ensure your monitoring tool sends incident context including timestamps, affected resources, and symptom descriptions. Richer context enables more accurate investigations.</li></ul><p><strong>Bring-your-own MCP servers</strong>If you use observability tools beyond the built-in integrations (Grafana, Prometheus, custom telemetry systems), you can connect them via MCP servers. MCP servers expose your tool’s data through a standardized protocol that DevOps Agent queries during investigations.</p><ul><li><strong>Publicly accessible HTTPS endpoint</strong>: MCP servers must be reachable from the public internet. VPC-hosted servers are not currently supported.</li><li>: For security, only expose MCP tools that perform read operations. Write operations introduce prompt injection risks.</li><li>: Register MCP servers at the account level, then selectively enable specific tools per Agent Space. Don’t grant access to all tools—choose only those relevant to investigations.</li></ul><ul><li><strong>Authentication misconfiguration</strong>: MCP servers support OAuth 2.0 or API key authentication. Verify your OAuth client credentials are correct and that token exchange URLs are accessible from AWS infrastructure.</li><li>: MCP tool names have a maximum length of 64 characters. Longer names will fail registration.</li><li>: Use the full HTTPS URL including path. Example: <code>https://mcp.example.com/v1/mcp</code> not just .</li></ul><p><strong></strong>After configuring webhooks or MCP servers, trigger a test investigation to verify connectivity:</p><ul><li>For webhooks: Send a test payload from your monitoring tool and verify the investigation starts in the DevOps Agent web app</li><li>For MCP servers: Start an investigation manually and check the agent journal to confirm it successfully called your MCP tools</li><li>Review any errors in AWS CloudTrail logs which capture all DevOps Agent API calls including integration attempts</li></ul><p>With your data sources connected, you now need to ensure the right people have appropriate access to investigations while maintaining security boundaries.</p><h3></h3><p>Agent Spaces support fine-grained access controls to ensure only authorized team members can interact with investigations.</p><p><strong>Access control considerations:</strong></p><ul><li>Who should view investigations? Typically on-call engineers, SREs, and DevOps engineers. Consider including security teams for security-related incidents.</li><li>Who should create AWS Support cases? Typically on-call leads and senior engineers. Restrict this permission to prevent excessive case creation.</li><li>Who should modify Agent Space configuration? Typically central operations or infrastructure teams. Separate this from day-to-day investigation access.</li></ul><p><strong>IAM-based access control:</strong></p><p>AWS DevOps Agent uses IAM policies to control access to Agent Spaces. Attach policies to IAM users, groups, or roles:</p><pre><code>{\n  \"Version\": \"2012-10-17\",\n  \"Statement\": [\n    {\n      \"Effect\": \"Allow\",\n      \"Action\": [\n        \"devopsagent:GetAgentSpace\",\n        \"devopsagent:StartInvestigation\",\n        \"devopsagent:GetInvestigation\",\n        \"devopsagent:ListInvestigations\"\n      ],\n      \"Resource\": \"arn:aws:devopsagent:us-east-1:123456789012:agentspace/EcommerceProd\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n</code></pre><p>AWS DevOps Agent operates within your AWS environment with privileged access to operational data across multiple accounts. While general security foundations apply, Agent Space configuration introduces specific considerations. For comprehensive security guidance, see the <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/devopsagent/latest/userguide/aws-devops-agent-security.html\">AWS DevOps Agent Security</a> documentation.</p><p>Access controls are in place—now it’s time to validate that your Agent Space configuration provides the investigation coverage you need.</p><p>Agent Space configuration is a two-way door decision. Start with a focused scope and expand based on investigation results.</p><p><strong>Testing your Agent Space:&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Trigger a test investigation using the AWS DevOps Agent web app.</p><ul><li>Start an investigation and provide symptoms such as “High latency on /api/checkout endpoint”.</li><li>Observe which resources the agent queries.</li><li>Review investigation completeness. Did the agent identify the root cause?</li><li>Were any accounts or services missing from the investigation?</li><li>Did the agent have sufficient telemetry data?</li></ul><p>Adjust Agent Space boundaries based on results.</p><ul><li>Add accounts if investigations lack context.</li><li>Add integrations if telemetry gaps exist.</li><li>Narrow scope if performance degrades.</li></ul><p>AWS DevOps Agent transforms incident response from a manual, time-consuming process into an autonomous, data-driven investigation. However, the agent’s effectiveness depends on proper Agent Space configuration. By following the on-call based approach—granting access to accounts relevant to your application while separating production from non-production environments—you provide sufficient context for accurate root cause analysis without introducing unnecessary complexity.</p><ul><li>Think on-call boundaries – Agent Space scope should mirror how your team investigates incidents</li><li>Use Infrastructure as Code – CDK and Terraform templates ensure consistent, repeatable deployments</li><li>Integrate observability tools – More data sources equals more accurate investigations</li><li>Iterate based on results – Expand or narrow Agent Space scope as investigation patterns emerge</li></ul><p>We’re committed to making AWS DevOps Agent easier to adopt and more accurate in solving customer problems.

The apparent misstep from Madhu Gottumukkala was especially noteworthy because the acting director of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency had requested special permission from CISA's Office of the Chief Information Officer to use the popular AI tool soon after arriving at the agency this May, three of the officials said. The app was blocked for other DHS employees at the time.\n \nNone of the files Gottumukkala plugged into ChatGPT were classified, according to the four officials, each of whom was granted anonymity for fear of retribution. But the material included CISA contracting documents (PDF) marked \"for official use only,\" a government designation for information that is considered sensitive and not for public release. Cybersecurity sensors at CISA flagged the uploads this past August, said the four officials. One official specified there were multiple such warnings in the first week of August alone. Senior officials at DHS subsequently led an internal review to assess if there had been any harm to government security from the exposures, according to two of the four officials.

Please explicitly note this (\"I have translated this from MyLanguage with an LLM\") and, if possible, post in your original language as well.</p></li><li><p>LLM code contributions are subject to more granularity below, but the general principle is that \"pure 'vibe coding' will be rejected\" and \"you are responsible for what you commit\".

These guidelines are our best effort attempt to ensure that knowledgeable developers who seek to use these tools as a legitimate aid are not overly-hindered, while also preventing an ongoing flood of slop contributions that violate our core ethos above. These apply to <strong>all official Jellyfin projects</strong>.</p><ol><li>Contributions should be . If the PR claims to target X, and is also touching unrelated Y and Z, it will be rejected. This includes incidental changes to unrelated functionality, a hallmark of poorly-worded or too-general prompts. Similarly, a large PR must be <strong>broken into multiple small, manageable commits</strong> for review and history purposes.</li><li>Formatting and quality . Excessive unhelpful comments, spaghetti code, spaces on empty lines, etc. will be interpreted as pure LLM output and rejected; you must  before submitting. Also <strong>do not commit LLM metafiles</strong> (e.g.  configs) or any other editor-created non-code files.</li><li>You must  and be able to  in the PR body -  LLM output as noted above - <strong>what is being changed and why</strong>. Your PR body (and, if applicable, commit bodies) should be providing context to other developers about why a change was made, and if your name is on it, we want  words and explanations, not an LLM's. If  what the LLM did, we are  in the change.</li><li>The changes must be . The code should build and run correctly, or it will be rejected. You should also <strong>explicitly test the functionality being modified</strong>.</li><li>You must be able and willing to  and implement the suggested change(s) as required. What this means in practice is, if you do not know what has been changed or why (see #3), and thus can't implement suggested changes or discuss them , then we are  in the change. Just dumping reviewer feedback into an LLM and expecting what comes out to be \"good enough\", is not.</li><li> require <strong>an in-depth level of understanding</strong> about what is being changed and why. It is obvious to our reviewers when changes are made without the developer making them understanding what is happening. These will be rejected. And as noted in #1, the PR must <strong>contain multiple discrete commits</strong>.  will squash commits as deemed appropriate after review. Large changes must also follow our other development policies (discussion, review, implementation, testing process).</li><li>The <strong>final discretion always lies with the reviewers</strong>. If your PR is not capable of being reasonably reviewed, for any reason (over-complexity, size, squashed commits, etc.) it will be rejected, and this goes just as much for non-LLM-assisted PRs as it does for LLM-assisted PRs. You will be asked to split such a PR up into multiple PRs that each present a focused, concise set of changes instead.</li></ol><p>The golden rule is this: <strong>do not just let an LLM loose on the codebase with a vague vibe prompt and then commit the results as-is</strong>. This is lazy development, will  result in a <strong>poor-quality contribution</strong> from our perspective, and we are not at all interested in such slop.  or please do not bother. And again, you are free to use LLMs to  you, but not as the sole source of code changes.</p><p>You are of course free to do whatever you wish for your own non-official projects.

If you are basing your project off of existing code, <strong>following its license is not optional</strong>. You must <strong>credit existing contributors in full</strong> for . Do not , and do not <strong>commit pending 3rd party changes as your own</strong> (i.e. by copying the code and then committing it).

What this means in practice is that rule #1 is up to the author, and rule #3 must be interpreted in that vein. If you  a tool is LLM-generated and violates rule #1, then downvote/ignore it and move on.  we see <strong>blatant breaking of rule #1</strong> we will enforce it, but again we will not be going through code line by line playing the \"was this LLM generated?\" game. Rule #2 will always be enforced regardless of LLM-ness or not.</li></ol>","contentLength":6904,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46801976"},{"title":"SpaceX is coming to the public markets, and secondaries are already on fire","url":"https://techcrunch.com/video/spacex-is-coming-to-the-public-markets-and-secondaries-are-already-on-fire/","date":1769636129,"author":"Theresa Loconsolo","guid":425542,"unread":true,"content":"<article>paceX is&nbsp;reportedly lining&nbsp;up&nbsp;four major Wall Street banks&nbsp;for a&nbsp;2026 IPO&nbsp;that could provide the&nbsp;reset&nbsp;the market needs.&nbsp; The company just completed a tender offer at an&nbsp;$800 billion&nbsp;valuation, and secondary market demand is through the roof.

Infrastructure monopolies -- whether privately franchised, operated as concessions or municipally owned -- funded themselves entirely through user fees rather than public subsidies, and were structured so that building more capacity was the path to greater returns. \n\nLandowners enjoyed a fundamental right to build when profitable, and height limits applied uniformly across entire cities rather than varying by neighborhood, meaning dense development remained legal everywhere. The system began collapsing after 1914, however. Inflation proved fatal to self-funding transport because governments found it politically impossible to raise controlled prices year after year. By the 1960s, trams had vanished from Britain, France and the U.S. \n\nMeanwhile, differential zoning gradually banned densification in established neighborhoods, and rent controls decimated private homebuilding in many countries. In Britain, average house prices fell from twelve times earnings in 1850 to four times by 1914. They have since climbed back to nine times earnings. The article argues roughly 80% of postwar price increases trace directly to restrictions on building.","contentLength":1609,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Luminar sale approved despite last-minute mystery bid","url":"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/28/luminar-sale-approved-despite-last-minute-mystery-bid/","date":1769632873,"author":"Sean O'Kane","guid":425519,"unread":true,"content":"<article>An unidentified bidder submitted a Hail Mary offer that was \"substantially higher\" than the winning bid at auction.

If this government is just going to assume anyone carrying a gun is a criminal who can be summarily executed <a href=\"https://www.techdirt.com/2026/01/12/tom-homan-if-democrats-dont-stop-calling-us-murderers-were-just-going-to-be-forced-to-keep-murdering-you/\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"https://www.techdirt.com/2026/01/12/tom-homan-if-democrats-dont-stop-calling-us-murderers-were-just-going-to-be-forced-to-keep-murdering-you/\">merely for being  federal officers</a>, we’re well past the point any “liberal” administration has dared to go.</p><p>And after years of ignoring cops shooting people who happened to be carrying guns (mainly because many of those people were minorities), <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/2026/01/25/gun-groups-challenge-minneapolis-shooting-pretti\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"https://www.axios.com/2026/01/25/gun-groups-challenge-minneapolis-shooting-pretti\">two heavy-hitters in the gun rights arena</a> have stepped up to criticize one of Trump’s many ineffective prosecutors, Bill Essayli, who has decided there’s no better way to cap off a <a href=\"https://www.techdirt.com/2026/01/16/welcome-to-the-resistance-grand-juries/\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"https://www.techdirt.com/2026/01/16/welcome-to-the-resistance-grand-juries/\">long string of rejected indictments</a> by claiming officers are fully justified if they decide to shoot people just because they have guns. </p><p>Here’s what Essayli added to his repost of the DHS’s claim that Alex Pretti signed his own death warrant by legally carrying a gun:</p><blockquote><p><em>If you approach law enforcement with a gun, there is a high likelihood they will be legally justified in shooting you. </em></p></blockquote><blockquote><p><em>[W]e condemn the untoward comments of <a href=\"https://x.com/USAttyEssayli\">@USAttyEssayli</a>. Federal agents are not “highly likely” to be “legally justified” in “shooting” concealed carry licensees who approach while lawfully carrying a firearm. The Second Amendment protects Americans’ right to bear arms while protesting—a right the federal government must not infringe upon.</em></p></blockquote><p>Of course, even though this entity got all hot and bothered by the suggestion that law enforcement officers are welcome to kill gun owners, it had to first give credit where it isn’t due (suggesting the DOJ has any interest in engaging in a full investigation) and dipping out of the tweet by sending some strays in the direction of the people who are currently getting murdered by federal officers: </p><blockquote><p><em>Finally, the Left must stop antagonizing [ICE] and [CBP] agents who are taking criminals off the street and play a crucial role in protecting communities and upholding the rule of law.</em></p></blockquote><p>Sooooo close. If the organization had stuck to the condemnation of Bill Essayli’s assault on the only right they care about, it might have meant something. But it means so much less when this (justified) criticism of federal officials is sandwiched between bending the knee to the DOJ and mindlessly insulting people just like the person they (sort of, from an oblique angle) defended in retrospect. </p><blockquote><p><em>This sentiment from the First Assistant U.S. Attorney for the Central District of California is dangerous and wrong. </em></p><p><em>Responsible public voices should be awaiting a full investigation, not making generalizations and demonizing law-abiding citizens.</em></p></blockquote><p>This one is much more straightforward, but still walks back the criticism of the federal prosecutor by telling everyone to “await” a “full investigation” which almost certainly isn’t going to be happening. </p><blockquote><p><em>“For months, radical progressive politicians like Tim Walz have incited violence against law enforcement officers who are simply trying to do their jobs. Unsurprisingly, these calls to dangerously interject oneself into legitimate law-enforcement activities have ended in violence, tragically resulting in injuries and fatalities. </em></p><p><em>As there is with any officer-involved shooting, there will be a robust and comprehensive investigation that takes place to determine if the use of force was justified. As we await these facts and gain a clearer understanding, we urge the political voices to lower the temperature to ensure their constituents and law enforcement officers stay safe.”</em></p></blockquote><p>This has led to Essayli trying to walk back his statement by claiming he didn’t say the thing he said and that these two prominent critics are “putting words in his mouth.” He “substantiated” his counter-claim by putting a whole lot of  words in his  mouth — words that very definitely  in the shorter post he put out in support of the DHS’s smearing of the person its employees had just executed in broad daylight on a public street.</p><p>In the end, it means almost nothing. Two Second Amendment-focused organization raised their voices briefly — breaking with the administration they absolutely adore — to condemn a perceived attack on their rights. But they’re utterly silent when it comes to condemning the act that prompted their belated reaction. They don’t honestly care how many people are killed by law enforcement officers. The only thing they care about is being able to open carry while shopping at Walmart or invading federal buildings to overturn elections. Everyone to the perceived left of their core membership can continue to get fucked. </p>","contentLength":6748,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Beyond the Rental Wallet: Human Tech’s ‘Wallet-as-a-Protocol’ Wants to Set Your Digital Assets Free","url":"https://hackernoon.com/beyond-the-rental-wallet-human-techs-wallet-as-a-protocol-wants-to-set-your-digital-assets-free?source=rss","date":1769630755,"author":"Ishan Pandey","guid":425593,"unread":true,"content":"<h2><em>The crypto world has a dirty little secret. For all the talk of decentralization and \"not your keys, not your coins,\" millions of users are currently living in a state of digital sharecropping.</em></h2><p>\\\nIf you’ve used a sleek, embeddable wallet in a decentralized app (dApp) lately—the kind that lets you sign in with your Google or Discord account—you’ve likely been using Wallet-as-a-Service (WaaS). It’s convenient, sure. But as <a href=\"https://human.tech/\">Human Tech</a> (the team behind the Holonym Foundation) points out, these wallets aren't actually yours. You’re just renting them. If the app stops paying the service provider, or if the provider goes bust, your \"self-custody\" vanishes into the ether.</p><p>\\\n<a href=\"https://human.tech/waap\">Human Tech</a> is launching what they call a \"structural inversion\" of the last decade of crypto onboarding. Instead of treating your digital identity as a subscription service for developers, WaaP aims to turn the wallet into a fundamental layer of the internet—one that belongs to the human, not the platform.</p><h3>The Problem with \"Rented\" Wallets</h3><p>To understand why this matters, you have to look at the current state of \"embedded\" wallets. Over 100 million keys have been created through WaaS providers. These services made crypto usable for normal people by hiding the complexity of seed phrases and private keys behind familiar social logins.</p><p>\\\nBut this convenience came with a hidden cost: vendor lock-in. Because these wallets are \"services,\" they are siloed. Your wallet in App A doesn't talk to App B. More importantly, your access is contingent on the developer’s relationship with the service provider.'</p><p>\\\n\"Most of these wallets are not owned. They are rented,\" Human Tech explains in their latest manifesto. \"If the app stops paying, the user loses access. This is a quiet reversion to the old internet model.\"</p><h3>WaaP: The Universal Interface</h3><p><a href=\"https://human.tech/waap\">WaaP</a> is an open protocol. Think of it like SMTP for email or HTTP for the web. It’s a set of rules that allows for protected self-custody that is universal and portable across any app or blockchain.</p><p>\\\nThe technical wizardry behind this involves Two-Party Computation (2PC) and Multi-Party Computation (MPC). In simple terms, your private key is split into two pieces. One piece is derived from your own \"human attributes\" (like biometrics or identity) and secured by the trustless Human Network. The other is locked in the decentralized Ika network behind security policies you control.</p><p>\\\nBecause no single entity holds the full key, there is no single point of failure. Even if the Human Tech team disappeared tomorrow, the protocol remains, and your assets stay yours.</p><h3>Why This is the \"TechCrunch\" Moment for Crypto</h3><p>What makes WaaP particularly compelling is how it handles the \"human\" side of technology. Traditional self-custody is brutal—lose your 12-word seed phrase, and your money is gone forever. WaaP offers a \"practical self-custody\" model. It allows for trustless recovery without seed phrases, social engineering risks, or reliance on a single device.</p><p>\\\nBut the real kicker is portability. Imagine having one wallet that follows you across every chain, every app, and even into the world of AI.</p><p>\\\nAs AI agents begin to transact on our behalf, the stakes for security have never been higher. WaaP allows users to safely delegate authority to these agents. You can tell an AI, \"You can sign this transaction for a specific game, but you can't touch my life savings.\" It turns AI into a controlled extension of the human, rather than a security liability.</p><p>The launch of the WaaP SDK and WaaP.build (a white-labeling platform for developers) marks the beginning of what Human Tech calls the \"post-WaaS era.\"</p><p>\\\nFor developers, the pitch is simple: stop paying for your users' wallets and start giving them true ownership. WaaP is free to create and use, composable, and resistant to the common attack vectors—like phishing and \"blind signing\"—that have plagued the industry for years.</p><p>\\\nIt also brings powerful \"plug-ins\" to the table. Developers can embed Zero-Knowledge (ZK) identity verification, allowing for KYC or age checks without ever seeing the user's personal data.</p><p>For years, the crypto industry has struggled to balance security with usability. We’ve oscillated between the \"Wild West\" of seed phrases and the \"Gilded Cage\" of centralized services.</p><p>\\\nHuman Tech’s Wallet-as-a-Protocol suggests we don’t have to choose. By building the wallet into the fabric of the internet itself, they are making a bet that the future of the digital economy isn't built on services we subscribe to, but on protocols we own.</p><p>\\\nIn a world where our digital lives are increasingly under surveillance and our assets are often at the mercy of platform whims, WaaP feels like a necessary return to the original promise of the web: a space where humans, not corporations, are the source of trust.</p><p>\\\nThe protocol is live, the tools are ready, and for the first time in a long time, the keys to your digital kingdom might actually stay in your pocket.</p><p>Don’t forget to like and share the story! </p>","contentLength":5021,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Cancer Might Protect Against Alzheimer's","url":"https://science.slashdot.org/story/26/01/28/1920237/cancer-might-protect-against-alzheimers?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&utm_medium=feed","date":1769630520,"author":"msmash","guid":425523,"unread":true,"content":"For decades, researchers have noted that cancer and Alzheimer's disease are rarely found in the same person, fuelling speculation that one condition might offer some degree of protection from the other.

The study, which was 15 years in the making, was published on 22 January in Cell and could help researchers to design drugs to treat Alzheimer's disease. \n\n\"They have a piece of the puzzle,\" says Donald Weaver, a neurologist and chemist at the Krembil Research Institute at the University of Toronto in Canada, who was not involved in the study. \"It's not the full picture by any stretch of the imagination. But it's an interesting piece.\" [...] A 2020 meta-analysis of data from more than 9.6 million people found that cancer diagnosis was associated with an 11% decreased incidence of Alzheimer's disease. It has been a difficult relationship to unpick: researchers must control for a variety of external factors. For example, people might die of cancer before they are old enough to develop symptoms of Alzheimer's disease, and some cancer treatments can cause cognitive difficulties, which could obscure an Alzheimer's diagnosis.","contentLength":1405,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Native Linux VST plugin directory","url":"https://linuxmusic.rocks/","date":1769630344,"author":"Aldipower","guid":425595,"unread":true,"content":"","contentLength":0,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46800737"},{"title":"How Clean-Energy Firms Adapt Messaging in the Trump Era","url":"https://spectrum.ieee.org/trump-renewable-energy","date":1769629060,"author":"Julia Tilton","guid":425498,"unread":true,"content":"<p>Renewable electricity isn’t “green.” It’s affordable and ready for AI</p>","contentLength":77,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy82MzM0MDAwOS9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTgyMzExMjM3M30.OhM96v5Q9si6EeSD226x0Nv88bWXNe7CfAvUDL_ZMa4/image.jpg?width=600","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Experian's Tech Chief Defends Credit Scores: 'We're Not Palantir'","url":"https://tech.slashdot.org/story/26/01/28/199225/experians-tech-chief-defends-credit-scores-were-not-palantir?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&utm_medium=feed","date":1769628120,"author":"msmash","guid":425504,"unread":true,"content":"When asked directly whether people actually like Experian, Alex Lintner, the credit bureau's CEO of Software and Technology, offered an unusual defense in an interview: \"First of all, we're not Palantir, so we don't do reputation scores.\" Speaking on The Verge's podcast, Lintner conceded that consumers who have poor credit scores through \"life's circumstances\" sometimes direct their frustration at Experian, though he argued the company enables vital access to credit for 247 million Americans. \n\nThe 10-year company veteran said Experian has built its own large language model and about 200 AI agents for internal use, but consumer data remains entirely walled off from public AI systems.

Two names are getting the most attention from presale hunters right now. Bitcoin Hyper, pitching itself as a Bitcoin scaling solution using Solana Virtual Machine integration, priced around $0.013 per token. On the other side is <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/pepeto.io\">Pepeto ($PEPETO)</a>, known as “The God of Frogs,” which has raised $7.19M at $0.000000180, building a meme-utility ecosystem made specifically for meme coin traders. Both presales are moving into late stages, but the path to big returns is very different once you look at the math.</p><p>\\\nPepeto only needs to reach $0.000018 to deliver 100x from $0.000000180, a target that would require an achievable market cap level already reached by much weaker meme projects in past cycles, which is why many see Pepeto’s 100x path as far more realistic. Bitcoin Hyper would need $1.30 to hit 100x from $0.013, which demands far broader market penetration and much larger capital inflows. In simple terms: the lower the entry price, the easier it is to get huge multiples, as long as the project can attract demand.</p><p>\\\nThat’s where Pepeto tries to separate itself. It’s not only a narrative. Pepeto already promotes working utility, including PepetoSwap with zero-fee swaps live today, a cross-chain bridge coming soon, and a Pepeto Exchange planned for 2026 with 850+ verified projects already applying. That creates a direct use case and demand engine earlier than most infrastructure-only presales, which often need full adoption before price momentum can really build.</p><h2>100x Path For HYPER and PEPETO</h2><p>Bitcoin Hyper at $0.013 requires climbing to $1.30 for 100x returns. This demands either massive individual token value or significant total supply circulation at elevated prices. For context, few tokens outside top-10 market caps sustain $1+ valuations. Pepeto at $0.000000180 needs only $0.000018 for 100x, a price point PEPE demonstrated as achievable for viral meme tokens with strong community traction.</p><p>\\\nLower entry creates exponentially superior percentage gain opportunities. A $100 investment in Bitcoin Hyper buys approximately 7,692 tokens. The same $100 in Pepeto buys 555,555,555 tokens. This quantity difference means Pepeto holders accumulate positions that generate meaningful dollar returns at micro-cap price points, while Bitcoin Hyper requires macro movements to deliver equivalent absolute gains.</p><p>Bitcoin Hyper builds Layer 2 infrastructure requiring wrapped BTC through canonical bridges, EVM integration for smart contracts, and developer adoption for ecosystem growth. Technical complexity creates implementation risk and extended timelines before utility materialization. The project's roadmap depends on successfully attracting developers to build on yet another Layer 2 solution in an increasingly saturated market.</p><p>PepetoSwap processes transactions now with zero fees, solving immediate friction for traders. Over 850 projects submitted applications to list on the Pepeto Exchange, demonstrating verified demand before launch. This pre-approval queue validates market need rather than hoping for post-launch adoption. Every listing generates revenue. Every swap creates volume. Every bridge transaction routes through PEPETO tokens. Working products generate immediate utility.</p><h2>Days Remaining Creates Final Entry Windows</h2><p>Bitcoin Hyper's presale approaches conclusion without disclosed hard cap, creating uncertainty around final raise amounts and token distribution. Pepeto operates with transparent $10M hard cap, $7.19M raised, and only $2.81M remaining before permanent closure. This definite scarcity creates urgency Bitcoin Hyper's structure cannot replicate. Days separate current buyers from permanent exclusion at presale pricing.</p><p>The 214% staking rewards create immediate holding value while Pepeto's audited contracts from SolidProof and Coinsult verify security. Bitcoin Hyper offers staking, but the seven-day post-TGE lockup creates brief restriction. Pepeto's transparent tokenomics and founder background from PEPE's original team add credibility that newer projects struggle to establish during presale phases.</p><h2>Post-Presale Listing Dynamics Favor Lower Entry</h2><p>Bitcoin Hyper lists on Uniswap and undisclosed CEX partners after mainnet launch precedes token generation. This structure means network functionality validates before trading begins, potentially reducing volatility. However, higher entry pricing limits percentage upside. Pepeto's lower entry creates explosive potential if even fractional PEPE-level adoption occurs post-listing. The $700,000 giveaway builds community momentum.</p><p>To Invest In the best crypto presale follow these simple steps:</p><ul><li>Connect your wallet (MetaMask, Trust Wallet, or other Web3 wallets)</li><li>Choose your payment method (ETH, USDT, BNB, or bank card if available)</li><li>Enter the amount you want to invest</li><li>Confirm the transaction in your wallet</li><li><strong>Stake your PEPETO tokens to earn rewards</strong></li></ul><p>Bitcoin Hyper is working on long-term scaling ideas that may take years to fully pay off. Pepeto is focused on what meme traders want right now: simplicity, speed, and real tools already in motion. That difference matters when it comes to returns.</p><p>Pepeto’s extremely low entry level gives early buyers something most projects can’t offer anymore, real room to grow. This is the stage where small decisions can lead to massive outcomes. History shows that the biggest gains don’t come from complex promises, but from early access to working products that people actually use.</p><p>\\\nWith the presale close to selling out, time is becoming the biggest risk. Once this window closes, early pricing disappears forever. For investors searching for the&nbsp;, the&nbsp;, or a chance at a truly&nbsp;, Pepeto stands out as one of the few projects where timing, utility, and upside all align, right now.</p><p><strong>1) Which is the best crypto presale to buy right now?</strong></p><p>For investors chasing the clearest , many pick  because it has a much lower entry price and utility already in motion.</p><p>\\\n<strong>2) Why is Pepeto presale better than Bitcoin Hyper?</strong></p><p>Because Pepeto offers  (zero-fee PepetoSwap, bridge coming, exchange planned) while Bitcoin Hyper depends on <strong>Layer-2 adoption and longer build timelines</strong>.</p><p>\\\n<strong>3) Can Pepeto deliver 100x returns?</strong></p><p>It’s possible.

It explains so much.</p><blockquote><p><em>In Minnesota, all of the ideological cornerstones of MAGA have been proved false at once. Minnesotans, not the armed thugs of ICE and the Border Patrol, are brave. Minnesotans have shown that their community is socially cohesive—because of its diversity and not in spite of it. Minnesotans have found and loved one another in a world atomized by social media, where empty men have tried to fill their lonely soul with lies about their own inherent superiority. Minnesotans have preserved everything worthwhile about “Western civilization,” while armed brutes try to tear it down by force.</em></p></blockquote><p>For years now, a certain strain of American political thought has operated on the assumption that human beings are fundamentally selfish, that “community” is a sucker’s game, and that anyone who claims to care about their neighbors is either lying or being paid. It’s the philosophy that undergirds every policy designed to punish rather than help, every sneer at “the woke mind virus,” and every insistence that “facts don’t care about your feelings.”</p><p>And then Minneapolis happened.</p><p>When the Trump administration surged thousands of armed federal agents into Minnesota—ostensibly over a <a href=\"https://19thnews.org/2026/01/child-care-fraud-minnesota-fact-check/\">fraud case that Biden-era prosecutors had already been handling</a>—they seem to have expected one of two things: either cowed compliance or the kind of violent resistance that would justify an even harder crackdown. What they got instead was something that appears to have genuinely baffled them: tens of thousands of ordinary people who simply refused to let their neighbors be dragged away.</p><p>Not activists. Not “paid operatives.” Just… people. Moms with minivans full of car seats making grocery deliveries. Dads doing dispatch shifts between work calls. Biologists and lawyers and nurses driving around in the freezing cold, honking at SUVs with out-of-state plates. As Serwer describes it:</p><blockquote><p><em>Even among those involved in opposing ICE in Minnesota, people have a range of political views. The nonviolent nature of the movement, and the focus on caring for neighbors, has drawn in volunteers with many different perspectives on immigration, including people who might have been supportive if the Trump administration’s claims of a targeted effort to deport violent criminals had been sincere.</em></p></blockquote><p>The thing that seems to have broken the MAGA brain is that even people who might have supported targeted enforcement of immigration law looked around at what was actually happening—the pregnant women dragged through snow, the doors kicked in, the indiscriminate terror, the senseless killings—and said “no.” Not because they’d been radicalized by some shadowy operation, but because they have eyes and consciences.</p><p>Ana Marie Cox, who spent a decade in the Minneapolis/St. Paul region before moving to Texas, <a href=\"https://newrepublic.com/article/205404/minneapolis-mutual-aid-ice-resilience\">wrote for The New Republic</a> about what she calls the “carbon-steel fibers wound together by generations of consistent, need-blind aid”:</p><blockquote><p><em>Bonds formed under the pressure of negative double-digit windchill are key to understanding what’s happening. It is impossible to get through a Minnesota winter without help, and only sometimes does that assistance come from your neighbors. The stories about people shoveling out or snowblowing an entire block’s driveways without being asked and with no compensation are true, but the real miracles (and just as common) are the times when strangers stop to help someone shovel out a car caught in a snowbank or bring out the kitty litter from their trunk put there just for this kind of emergency. I cannot tell you one story about that happening to me. I have at least three or four. The pun is irresistible: Minnesotans have always declared common cause against ice, they’ve just changed their focus to the ice that you can’t also use for hockey practice.</em></p><p><em>You can dismiss it as a joke until someone at a café gives you a spare scarf because you can’t find yours. People offer assistance without hesitation and without question; I don’t think I ever even heard someone dismiss thanks with, “Just pay it back someday.” Of course you will—everyone knows it. Some might find it remarkable that the generosity exists right alongside the stubborn interpersonal Midwestern microdistance that can take years to thaw. But the caution of their relationships speaks to the universality of the principle: You don’t help people out because you like them. You just do.</em></p></blockquote><p>Cory Doctorow has referred to his “covered dish” dilemma in the past a few times, which goes like this:</p><blockquote><p><em>“If there’s a disaster, do you go over to your neighbor’s house with: a) a covered dish or b) a shotgun? It’s game theory. If you believe your neighbor is coming over with a shotgun, you’d be an idiot to pick a); if she believes the same thing about you, you can bet she’s not going to choose a) either. The way to get to a) is to do a) even if you think your neighbor will pick b). Sometimes she’ll point her gun at you and tell you to get off her land, but if she was only holding the gun because she thought you’d have one, then she’ll put on the safety and you can have a potluck.”</em></p></blockquote><p>It’s basically a question of, in times of trouble, will your neighbors seek to take advantage of you. Or will they look to work with you as a community to respond to the adversity you all face.</p><p>The MAGA world seems to view only the former as possible. They always show up with shotguns. Reality keeps showing that most people lean towards the latter, and show up with covered dishes.</p><p>Minneapolis is showing up with covered dishes. Thousands of them.</p><p>This is the part that the JD Vances of the world genuinely cannot comprehend. Vance has said it’s “<a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/columnist/2025/10/29/jd-vance-immigrants-neighbors-language-racist/86966480007/\">totally reasonable</a>” for Americans to want to live only near people they “have something in common with,” that social cohesion requires ethnic homogeneity. Minneapolis is proving the exact opposite: that diverse communities can be  cohesive, not less, precisely because they’ve had to build those bonds intentionally.</p><p>Serwer captures this beautifully:</p><blockquote><p><em>If the Minnesota resistance has an overarching ideology, you could call it “neighborism”—a commitment to protecting the people around you, no matter who they are or where they came from. The contrast with the philosophy guiding the Trump administration couldn’t be more extreme.</em></p></blockquote><p>What’s been particularly striking is how the resistance has explicitly rejected the kind of violent confrontation that the administration seems to have been hoping for. The “commuters”—the volunteers who patrol neighborhoods looking for ICE vehicles—have been trained to follow traffic laws, avoid physical confrontation, and simply bear witness. Their weapons are whistles, phones, and car horns. As one volunteer told Cox in <a href=\"https://newrepublic.com/article/205736/ice-resistance-minneapolis-residents-unseen\">her second piece on the resistance</a>:</p><blockquote><p><em>“I don’t mean to be flip about this, but they can’t shoot us all.”</em></p></blockquote><p>There are more of us than there are them. There are more good people in the world than bad. There are more virtuous people who believe in community than angry insecure people who believe that everything is a zero sum game.</p><p>And for each act of cruelty, each selfish bit of nonsense from ICE or CBP or the administration, more Minnesotans realize they need to be involved.</p><blockquote><p><em>The instances of physical violence only goose the number of people willing to be targets. Says Chris, “Every time they attack us, another round of volunteers comes in. We refuse to be cowed.”</em></p></blockquote><p>And it’s somewhat working. The administration has already been forced <a href=\"https://www.techdirt.com/2026/01/27/border-patrol-thug-greg-bovino-gets-booted-back-to-the-border-by-the-trump-administration/\">to yank Gregory Bovino</a>, the preening Border Patrol commander who seemed to relish his villain role, out of Minneapolis, though they replaced him with Tom Homan (who, to be clear, is basically as bad). But, still, it’s not a sign of strength to be switching leaders and clearly demoting the guy who’d been the face of this invasion. That’s a strategic retreat forced by people whose only armor is their willingness to show up.</p><p>The MAGA movement has spent years cultivating what Serwer identifies as a series of “mistaken assumptions”:</p><blockquote><p><em>The first is the belief that diverse communities aren’t possible… A second MAGA assumption is that the left is insincere in its values, and that principles of inclusion and unity are superficial forms of virtue signaling. White liberals might put a sign in their front yard saying “In This House We Believe…” but they will abandon those immigrants at the first sensation of sustained pressure.</em></p></blockquote><p>And, as Serwer correctly notes, part of the reason for this belief is that it has kinda been true… for the actual elite, who have spent the last year trying to pretend Trump isn’t doing what he clearly promised to do:</p><blockquote><p><em>And in Trump’s defense, this has turned out to be true of many liberals in positions of power—university administrators, attorneys at white-shoe law firms, political leaders.</em></p></blockquote><p>But it turns out that millions of ordinary Americans are not those people. They’re the ones delivering groceries to families too scared to leave their homes, the ones doing laundry for the volunteers doing deliveries, the ones who signed up for constitutional observer training (over 26,000 through just one organization, <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/news/dispatch/the-battle-for-minneapolis\"><u>according to The New Yorker</u></a>).</p><p>Cox captures what this invisible infrastructure looks like:</p><blockquote><p><em>So much of the resistance is either carried out by women or coded as women’s work—unheralded, boring, unglamorous, and mostly undocumented. “You’re in the middle of resisting fascism, and someone still needs to do laundry,” Chris points out. A single father and a Parent-Teacher Association president, he stepped forward early on to do admin and dispatch, sometimes pulling four-, five-, six-hour shifts.</em></p><p><em>“I was eating nothing but takeout. I said something, and now I’ve got a full fridge.” The grocery deliveries to immigrant families are vital. What keeps those deliveries happening are the deliveries to the people making deliveries. It’s mutual aid all the way down.</em></p><p><em>Someone even volunteered to do the other volunteers’ day jobs, the work-work—formatting spreadsheets, answering emails. She volunteered to sit at a desk; she has young kids and doesn’t want to leave them alone. So she offered what she could: clerical skills.</em></p></blockquote><p>The MAGA bros, full of hate and seething, have been running around X insisting this must all be organized and planned. They talk nonsense about “op sec” and “supply lines” when it’s really just all communities looking out for one another.</p><p>There’s a temptation to view all of this through the lens of political tribalism—Team Blue vs. Team Red, libs vs. MAGAs. But that framing misses something important. Pastor Miguel, who leads Iglesia Cristiana La Via in Burnsville and has been organizing food drives for families in hiding, told Serwer:</p><blockquote><p><em>“One of the things that I believe, and I know most of the Latino community agrees, is that we want the bad people out. We want the criminals out,” Pastor Miguel, who immigrated from Mexico 30 years ago, told me. “All of us came here looking for a better life for us and for our children. So when we have criminals, rapists—when we have people who have done horrible things in our streets, in our communities—we are afraid of them. We don’t want them here.”</em></p></blockquote><p>He’s not some open-borders absolutist. He’s someone who looked at what ICE was actually doing—picking up people with pending asylum cases, targeting workers with valid permits, terrorizing entire neighborhoods—and recognized it as something other than law enforcement. Then one of his friends, a man he believed had legal status, was picked up by federal agents.</p><p>This is what the administration either didn’t anticipate or didn’t care about: that once you deploy armed agents to conduct indiscriminate sweeps through American neighborhoods, you’re making  feel hunted. And when everyone feels hunted, everyone has a reason to resist.</p><p>Consider Stephen Miller’s ridiculously racist stated belief that “migrants and their descendants recreate the conditions, and terrors, of their broken homelands.” Serwer’s response is devastating:</p><blockquote><p><em>In Minnesota, the opposite was happening. The “conditions and terrors” of immigrants’ “broken homelands” weren’t being re-created by immigrants. They were being re-created by people like Miller. The immigrants simply have the experience to recognize them.</em></p></blockquote><p>This gets at something crucial: the people organizing mutual aid networks, running food deliveries, and patrolling for ICE vehicles aren’t doing it because they’ve been brainwashed by some progressive ideology. Many of them are doing it because they or their families have . They know what occupation looks like. They know what arbitrary state violence looks like. And they know that the only thing that stops it is ordinary people refusing to look away.</p><blockquote><p><em>This is not a bad time to take groceries to a free fridge in your city. Or maybe: Find a chore to do for a neighbor now, before they need it. Or maybe: Get trained on Naloxone administration. Volunteer to walk dogs. Start a tool library. Learn some names.</em></p></blockquote><p>Start building those connections. In Doctorow’s terms, bring the covered dish now, so that your neighbors know you won’t bring a shotgun later.</p><p>The resistance in Minneapolis wasn’t conjured out of nothing when the federal agents arrived. It was built over decades by people helping each other get through brutal winters, showing up for each other after police killings, and developing the organizational infrastructure that could be activated when the moment demanded it.</p><p>Serwer ends his piece with this:</p><blockquote><p><em>No matter how many more armed men Trump sends to impose his will on the people of Minnesota, all he can do is accentuate their valor. No application of armed violence can make the men with guns as heroic as the people who choose to stand in their path with empty hands in defense of their neighbors. These agents, and the president who sent them, are no one’s heroes, no one’s saviors—just men with guns who have to hide their faces to shoot a mom in the face, and a nurse in the back.</em></p></blockquote><p>The morally depraved fear that virtue is common. Minneapolis is proving they were right to be afraid. People bringing covered dishes instead of shotguns is terrifying to them. But it’s how civilization actually works—something the MAGA true believers may never understand.</p>","contentLength":14507,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"There's a Rash of Scam Spam Coming From a Real Microsoft Address","url":"https://it.slashdot.org/story/26/01/28/1849206/theres-a-rash-of-scam-spam-coming-from-a-real-microsoft-address?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&utm_medium=feed","date":1769626080,"author":"msmash","guid":425477,"unread":true,"content":"There are reports that a legitimate Microsoft email address -- which Microsoft explicitly says customers should add to their allow list -- is delivering scam spam.

Customer service has a chatbot, product built a recommendation engine or narrative-driven LLM context flow, marketing runs campaigns through an LLM, and engineering automated some code reviews plus testing, etc.</p><p>\\\nThen the question: \"How do we actually get value out of all this?\"</p><p>\\\nThis is the space between having Agentic AI and knowing what to do with it. Between feeling busy with AI projects and actually seeing business impact.</p><p>\\\nIn 2026, . Nearly 90% of companies report using AI in at least one business function, yet most still struggle to scale pilots or demonstrate clear ROI. The shift happening now looks less like a feature rollout and more like a redesign of operating models, governance structures, and risk management frameworks.</p><p>\\\nThe winners this year won't be determined by who has the most AI. They'll be defined by who figured out orchestration, observability, and auditability.</p><h2>The Real Problem Isn't Technology</h2><p>\\\nBut here's what those numbers miss: having Agents is different from orchestrating them.</p><p>\\\nI recently worked with a client who had 17 different AI implementations running across their business, from marketing automation to supply chain optimization to HR screening.</p><p>\\\nEach one worked fine in isolation. But then their product team tried to launch&nbsp;Agents that operations and the business couldn’t observe and audit, revealing existential risks and blindsides. Nobody had actually designed these systems to work together because nobody thought about orchestration until it was too late.</p><h2>Orchestration Means Strategic Integration, Not Just APIs</h2><p>When people hear \"orchestration,\" they often think integration layer. Connect the APIs, move some data around, call it done.</p><p>\\\nThat's plumbing. Useful plumbing, but not orchestration.</p><p>\\\nReal orchestration means your AI systems understand context across domains. Think about specialized orchestrator models that can divide labor between different components, coordinating tools, and language models to solve complex problems. It's the difference between having smart tools and having an intelligent system.</p><p>\\\nHere's an example. Let’s say a retail company wants to optimize inventory. They have demand forecasting AI in one corner, supply chain planning in another, and pricing optimization somewhere else. All three are solid models. The issue is they all optimize for different things.</p><p>\\\nOrchestration can fix this by establishing a coordination layer. Rather than a central AI that replaces specialized models, this system would understand the relationships between its objectives. When demand forecasting suggests increasing inventory, the orchestration layer would check supply chain constraints and pricing implications before executing. Huge unlock for the organization and the business. Without it, there would be disconnects that affect customer delivery and the overall fulfillment process.</p><p>\\\nMy prediction is that in 2026, enterprises will increasingly discover that the competitive frontier lies in managing specialized components effectively.</p><p>Most executives still treat governance as the thing you do to stay compliant. The overhead that legal requires. The checkbox exercise before deployment. A key precursor or underlying aspect of governance with AI, though, is actually observability.</p><p>\\\nCan you trace AI and Agent actions to their original inputs and outputs at each interface or boundary so that you know what you are delivering across the long-tail of customer use cases is actually what you intended? If you can, you then have auditability, which in turn means you have governance.</p><p>\\\nThat view is expensive and today, with AI and Agents, very near-sighted or downright existentially risky. Before, the risk was localized because the product and technology were deterministic–all code was WYSIWG, mostly, and was linear, not open-ended AI.</p><p>\\\nWhen Agentic AI started taking actions rather than just generating responses, governance stopped being about central review and became about designing systems that can operate responsibly at scale. The companies that figured this out early turned governance into observability and then quick feedback loops to gain the confidence to ship; in other words, speed that ships confidently.</p><p>\\\nRegulated industries are adopting auditable AI processes and model risk management as mandatory capabilities. The key elements include continuous monitoring, explainability requirements, version control, and transparent decision trails.</p><p>\\\nThe firms treating these as features rather than constraints are moving faster than competitors, still working through manual approval chains.</p><h2>What Decision Velocity Actually Means</h2><p>There's a concept gaining traction called \"decision velocity,\" which refers to how quickly smaller decision trees and processes can be automated at scale. It's a useful lens for understanding what changes when orchestration and governance with observability work together.</p><p>\\\nThink about how decisions happen in most enterprises. Someone identifies an issue, gathers data, analyzes options, and escalates to whoever has authority. That person reviews context, makes a call, and communicates the decision. Implementation happens, and results get monitored.</p><p>\\\nEach step takes time. More importantly, each step involves coordination costs like finding the right person, explaining context, waiting for availability, and following up on execution.</p><p>\\\nAI and Agents change the equation when they can handle the entire loop, including execution and monitoring. But that only works if the Agent or AI understands the boundaries it operates within (governance) and can coordinate with other systems that need to know about the decision (orchestration).</p><p>\\\nI've seen companies achieve 5-7x improvements in certain decision cycles by getting this right. Not 10% better. Multiple times faster. The difference between responding to market changes in weeks versus days, or adjusting operations quarterly versus nearly continuously.</p><h2>The Maturity Gap Shows Up in Measurement</h2><p>Here's how you know if you have an orchestration problem: ask your teams what success looks like for their AI initiatives.</p><p>\\\nIf everyone gives you different answers, you have a coordination gap. If nobody can connect their metrics across their peers to business outcomes, you have an orchestration gap. If people can't explain how their AI decisions affect other systems, you have a governance and auditability gap.</p><p>\\\n shows that organizations in early stages of AI maturity had financial performance below industry average, while those in advanced stages performed well above average. The difference is having the capabilities to use it strategically.</p><p>\\\nThe maturity models all point to the same progression. You start with experimentation, where individual teams build individual solutions. That's fine for learning, but it doesn't scale.</p><p>\\\nThe next stage involves getting systems to talk to each other, establishing shared data foundations, and building common platforms. This is where most enterprises are stuck as we kick off 2026.</p><h2>Building for 2026 and Beyond</h2><p>The companies positioning themselves well for this year are making specific choices.</p><p>\\\nThey're prioritizing orchestration infrastructure over adding more point solutions. When evaluating new AI capabilities, they ask how it fits with existing systems before asking how good it is standalone.</p><p>\\\nThey're treating governance frameworks as product decisions, not compliance exercises. Product takes governance and decomposes it into observability and auditability for the business, which is important for engineering and operations’ iterative cycles, and “is the work” to deliver AI or Agentic AI predictably and accurately over time. Building observability into AI systems from the start. Designing for auditability. Creating clear accountability structures.</p><p>\\\nLeadership is shifting from centralized IT oversight to empowering line-of-business leaders to find and fund AI and Agent solutions that directly advance their goals. But that decentralization only works when there's strong orchestration and governance holding it together.</p><p>\\\nThe most effective enterprise strategies begin with a foundational question: what data can we trust, and what do we need to fix before we automate decisions at scale. That's where orchestration, observability, and auditability, leading to a true governance posture,&nbsp; intersect with execution.</p><p>\\\nThe practical work involves several pieces: building coordination layers that let specialized AI and Agent systems work together, establishing governance frameworks that enable autonomous operation within clear boundaries, creating measurement systems that connect AI activity to business outcomes, and developing talent that understands both the technical and organizational aspects.</p><p>\\\nNone of this is simple. But it's the work that separates companies using AI from companies transformed by it.</p><p><em>Nick Talwar is a CTO, ex-Microsoft, and a hands-on AI engineer who supports executives in navigating AI adoption.

Tracking pixels are like those… but turned up to eleven. While a read-receipt only says “the recipient read this email” (usually only after\n              the recipient gives consent for it to do so), a tracking pixel can often track  and&nbsp; you refer to an email.\n            </p><p>\n              If I re-read a year-old email from HSBC, they’re saying that they want to know about it.\n            </p><p>\n              But it gets worse. Because HSBC are using , rather than  URLs for their tracking pixels, they’re also saying that every time you read an email\n              from them, they’d like <em>everybody on the same network as you</em> to be able to know that you did so, too. If you’re at my house, on my WiFi, and you open an email from HSBC, not\n              only might HSBC know about it, but  might know about it too.\n            </p><p>\n              An easily-avoidable security failure there, HSBC… which isn’t the kind of thing one hopes to hear about a bank!\n            </p><p>\n              But… tracking pixels don’t actually work. At least, they doesn’t work . Like many privacy-conscious individuals, my devices are configured to block tracking pixels (and a\n              variety of other instruments of surveillance capitalism) right out of the gate.\n            </p><p>\n              This means that even though I  read most of the non-spam email that lands in my Inbox, the sender <em>doesn’t get to know that I did</em> so unless I choose to tell them.\n              This is the way that email was  to work, and is the only way that a sender can be confident that it  work.\n            </p><p>\n              But we’re in the Darkest Timeline. . So they wrote me a letter to tell me that my emails have been “returned\n              undelivered” (which seems to be an outright lie).\n            </p><p>\n              Surveillance capitalism has become so ubiquitous that it’s become transparent. Transparent like the invisible spies at the bottom of your bank’s emails.\n            </p><p>\n              So in summary, with only a little speculation:\n            </p><ol><li><strong>Surveillance capitalism became widespread</strong> enough that HSBC came to assume that tracking pixels have bulletproof reliability.\n              </li><li><strong>HSBC started using tracking pixels</strong> them to check whether emails are being received (even though that’s not what they do when they&nbsp; reliable, which\n                they’re not).\n                <ul><li>(Oh, and their tracking pixels are badly-implemented, if they worked they’d “leak” data to other people on my network.)\n                  </li></ul></li><li><strong>Eventually, HSBC assumed their tracking was bulletproof.</strong> Because HSBC couldn’t track how often, when, and where I was reading their emails… they posted me a letter to\n                tell me I needed to change my email address.\n              </li></ol><h2>\n              What do I think HSBC should do?\n            </h2><p>\n              Instead of sending me a misleading letter about undelivered emails, perhaps a better approach for HSBC could be:\n            </p><ol><li><strong>, stop using unencrypted connections for tracking pixels</strong>. I do not want to open a bank email on a cafe’s public WiFi and have\n                 potentially know who I bank with… and that I just opened an email from them! I certainly don’t want attackers injecting content into the bottom of\n                legitimate emails.\n              </li><li><strong>Stop assuming that if somebody blocks your attempts to spy on them via your emails, it means they’re not getting your emails</strong>. It doesn’t mean that. It’s never meant\n                that. There are all kinds of reasons that your tracking pixels might not work, and they’re not even all privacy-related reasons!\n              </li><li><strong>Or, better yet: just stop trying to surveil your customers’ email habits in the first place?</strong> You already sit on a wealth of personal and financial information which\n                you can, and probably do, data-mine for your own benefit.

Please click this link to confirm that you are.” This not only achieves informed consent for your tracking, but it can be\n                more-secure too because you can authenticate the user during the process.\n              </li></ol><p>\n              Also, to quote your own principles once more: when you make a mistake like assuming your spying is a flawless way to detect the validity of email addresses, perhaps you should “be\n              transparent with our customers and other stakeholders about how we use their data”.\n            </p><p>\n              Wouldn’t that be better than writing to a customer to say that their emails are being returned undelivered (when they’re not)… and then having your staff tell them that having received\n              such an email they have no choice but to change the email address they use (which is then disputed by your  staff)?\n            </p>","contentLength":8129,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46799304"},{"title":"Mesa 26.0-rc2 Released With Numerous AMD, NVIDIA & Intel Driver Fixes","url":"https://www.phoronix.com/news/Mesa-26.0-rc2-Released","date":1769623387,"author":"Michael Larabel","guid":425486,"unread":true,"content":"<article>Following last week's code branching / feature freeze and first release candidate of Mesa 26.0, Mesa 26.0-rc2 is now available with an initial batch of bug fixes for this quarter's feature update to these open-source OpenGL and Vulkan drivers...</article>","contentLength":245,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Apple Sued by App Developer Over its Continuity Camera","url":"https://apple.slashdot.org/story/26/01/28/175253/apple-sued-by-app-developer-over-its-continuity-camera?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&utm_medium=feed","date":1769623260,"author":"msmash","guid":425459,"unread":true,"content":"An anonymous reader shares a report: Apple is being sued by Reincubate, which makes the Camo smartphone webcam app. It has filed a lawsuit against Apple in a U.S. federal court in New Jersey, accusing the company of anticompetitive conduct and patent infringement.

People who try to prove themselves turn every moment into a contest—someone else must lose for them to win. How can they outsmart others with a better argument? How can they find flaws in their logic? How can they show the value they bring to the team?</p><p>\\\nCompetitive mindset keeps them constantly stressed and anxious about how they’re perceived—do others like them, are they admired for their skills, do people see the effort they put in? Approval and validation from others is the key focus area that drives their thinking. They evaluate every opportunity based on how it benefits them as opposed to what’s good for their team. They argue tirelessly to prove their point because accepting they’re wrong undermines their competence. Every day at work seems like a battle to be fought and a race to be won.</p><p>\\\nImproving yourself involves measuring yourself against your own past self—how much are you learning, what’s getting better, are you evolving each day? People who focus on improvement turn every moment into a learning opportunity—it’s not about winning or losing, but making progress each day. What are they missing? What are the gaps in their skills? What can others teach them?</p><p>\\\nCuriosity mindset keeps them excited and focused as every new challenge is an opportunity to learn something new and grow their skills—pleasure is not in reaching the destination, but the journey they take. They don’t attach their identity to their point of view and show willingness to listen to others when a better perspective shows up. They aren’t concerned about being liked or popular because they build strong relationships with others by working together and not against them. Their self-esteem isn’t fragile and dependent on external validation—they lead with an internal measure of their worth. Every day at work feels like a joy ride with many twists and turns.</p><p>\\\nMoving from proving to improving gives you a sense of control over your decisions, actions, and the way you want to lead your life. You no longer have to pretend or be someone else just to please others. You don’t have to worry about being judged or criticized when you measure yourself against an inner scorecard, not external pressures or ego.</p><blockquote><p>Why waste time proving over and over how great you are, when you could be getting better? Why hide deficiencies instead of overcoming them? Why look for friends or partners who will just shore up your self-esteem instead of ones who will also challenge you to grow? And why seek out the tried and true, instead of experiences that will stretch you?</p></blockquote><p>\\\nIt starts with the desire to be a better person each day—prioritizing learning and growth over external measures of worth. These 5 practices can help you make that shift.</p><h3>Ask questions with the intent to learn; don’t show off intelligence.</h3><p>When your focus is to prove yourself, you use every opportunity to put a spotlight on your work—why your ideas are better, the quality with which you delivered something, and how you were praised for your work. You keep highlighting your achievements to earn trust and be seen as more credible. You show off intelligence by using jargon, over-complicating the problem, and exaggerating the possibility of a failure.</p><p>\\\nIn order to be the smartest person in the room, you try to outshine others—by interrupting, challenging them, and questioning their decisions. You disagree with them only to make yourself heard.</p><p>\\\n<em>No need to waste time on it. I can tell you that it won’t work.</em></p><p><em>I have a better solution.</em></p><p><em>Let me handle it. I know how to do it.</em></p><p>\\\nBut trying to outwit others or self-trumpeting all the time does not make others like you. Quite the opposite—they resent you for showing up as a know-it-all or always one-upping them. Your knowledge, experience, and skills are valuable, but you don’t have to brag about them or put others down to be seen. By shifting from proving to improving, you can get the attention and build the influence to drive meaningful change at work.</p><p>\\\nInstead of leading with answers, show the attitude to learn by asking meaningful questions. When your intent is to collaborate, not overshadow or trick others, it makes them more likely to value your inputs and acknowledge your experience.</p><p>\\\n<em>Can you share some data and insights on how this will work?</em></p><p><em>I need your feedback on another solution that might be better suited to this problem. Would you like to hear it?</em></p><p><em>This appears to be a challenging problem. What ideas do you have?</em></p><p>\\\nQuestions ignite meaningful conversations that aren’t about who is right and who is wrong. They encourage problem-solving with a shared goal to find the best solution. They challenge everyone to think creatively and show openness to accept differences of opinion. Questions unlock improvement.</p><blockquote><p>We awaken by asking the right questions. We awaken when we see knowledge being spread that goes against our own personal experiences. We awaken when we see popular opinion being wrong but accepted as being right, and what is right being pushed as being wrong. We awaken by seeking answers in corners that are not popular.</p></blockquote><p>\\\nTrying hard to prove yourself leads to distance and repulsion, while working on improving yourself builds trust and connection. Don’t lead with answers. Ask questions. Make your knowledge, experience, and skills visible without boasting.</p><p>When proving is the goal, comfort and safety take priority over new opportunities. You keep doing things you’ve already mastered because they come easily to you—you don’t need to re-establish your worth or worry about the delivered value. You let go of a new opportunity that has unknowns and uncertainty involved because doing it comes at a certain risk.</p><p>\\\nThe fear of not doing it well and the impact it will have on the image and reputation you have built for yourself scares you from stepping into the unknown.</p><p>\\\n<em>What if you don’t know how to do it?</em></p><p><em>What if it doesn’t work as expected?</em></p><p>\\\nBut staying within your comfort zone prevents you from improving. You refuse to take on tasks that will require building new skills. You let go of projects that require navigating complexity. The desire to prove makes you give up on excellent growth opportunities. Without the skills needed to take on higher-level responsibilities, you get stuck in your job and role. Relying on expertise for too long makes you redundant—others who have caught up to you or those who have moved ahead will be more in demand.</p><p>\\\nInstead of working within a safety net, take one step outside it. Sign up for opportunities that require you to stretch, that make you uncomfortable, and challenge you to grow your abilities. Your value will multiply by taking these steps and failing rather than staying where you are.</p><p>\\\n<em>What’s making me uncomfortable? How can I put together a plan in place to tackle it?</em></p><p><em>What gaps in knowledge and skills can prevent me from meeting my objective? How can I bridge this gap?</em></p><p><em>Who can I reach out to for the help and support I need?</em></p><p>\\\nProactively building new skills keeps you better prepared to tackle future needs. They build the courage and confidence to face their fears instead of letting them stop them from embracing difficulties. Stepping up in times of need also makes you come across as someone who can be counted on and trusted to lead. Make embracing challenges your goal, not showcasing your talent.</p><blockquote><p>You will never improve in life if you’re always living on easy street. Strength and progress can be gained if only you just step outside of your comfort zone.</p></blockquote><p>\\\nDoing the work that lies in your zone of expertise keeps you mired in mediocrity, while expanding beyond it into the stretch zone unleashes your potential and multiplies your impact. Stand out at work by building skills that lead to long-term growth, not short-term wins.</p><h3>Seek feedback with focus on criticism, not praise</h3><p>When you ask for feedback with the intent to validate yourself or seek approval, a positive response raises your self-esteem, makes you feel worthy, and enables you to believe in yourself. However, even a hint of criticism puts you off—you feel attacked, targeted, and may even engage in self-doubt with the belief that you don’t have what it takes. Taking feedback personally or attaching it to your identity makes criticism feel like a threat, something that hurts your credibility and makes your work matter less.</p><p>\\\nWhen someone points out gaps in your approach or suggests a better alternative, you take it the wrong way and hold it against them. When your manager tells you that your work needs improvement, you begin to justify and turn defensive.</p><p>\\\nEngaging in feedback conversations that make you feel good about yourself without highlighting areas where you need to improve may temporarily boost your self-esteem, but they’ll do nothing to advance you in the direction of your goals. Without getting clear, actionable feedback on habits you need to change, skills you need to build, and knowledge you need to expand, you’ll be locked in an illusion of greatness—you’ll be trapped with a false belief about your competence, which will prevent you from embracing opportunities required to evolve and excel.</p><p>\\\nCriticism stings. It’s hard. At times, it may even be unfair. But it’s also necessary. It’s what shows you the path when you’re stuck. It’s what gives you direction when you’re lost. It’s what gets you back on track when you’re distracted or lose focus. It’s what helps you stay grounded, truthful, and real. Seek feedback from people who have valuable things to contribute, even if they make you uncomfortable.</p><p>\\\n<em>Who might have valuable information about my performance on this project, idea, or strategy?</em></p><p><em>What’s wrong with it? How can I make it better?</em></p><p><em>What might I be missing, and who can give me feedback on it?</em></p><p>\\\nChanneling constructive criticism into useful signals can help you unlock your potential. You can bridge the gap between how you see yourself and how others perceive your work. Showing curiosity to learn from others also builds positive relationships at work—when they see that you value their inputs, they’re more likely to engage with you and stay honest. Consider feedback as a growth catalyst, not a dagger.</p><blockquote><p>Feeling bad is not just an unfortunate consequence of hearing honest feedback, it is a necessary consequence. Anxiety and sadness serve a key motivational function—they make your brain want to take action to get rid of them. Negative feelings focus attention and resources on the task at hand. They are like fuel for your fire.</p></blockquote><p>\\\nPraise can bolster your ego and make you feel capable, successful, and respected. But seeking only praise can turn you blind to your flaws. Criticism isn’t meant to undermine your confidence. It’s a powerful tool when viewed through the lens of growth. Seek it actively and often.</p><h3>Acknowledge mistakes to prevent future errors, don’t hide them</h3><p>Mistakes have a negative connotation. They evoke strong feelings of shame, disappointment, and regret. You may hide mistakes with the worry that accepting them will damage your image and hurt your reputation. If others know about your errors, they may not trust you, or you may be passed up for better opportunities. You try to portray an image of perfection because anything less will put your knowledge and experience at risk.</p><p>\\\nYou may also synonymize mistakes with defeat. One mistake and you lose interest and drop out—you just don’t want to look stupid. Mistakes for you aren’t disappointing and temporary; they are powerful forces that pull you down by casting a shadow over months of effort and hard work.</p><p>\\\n<em>I am worried about what others will think about me.</em></p><p><em>I don’t want to look incompetent.</em></p><p>\\\nBut not acknowledging mistakes or using them as an excuse to quit prevents you from learning valuable lessons—what went wrong, why it occurred, what changes are required to get back on track, and how you can prevent this from happening again. Accepting mistakes and learning from them ignites curiosity to do better next time. It gives you the confidence to face the challenges and obstacles in your path. It shows the power of consistency and persistence.</p><p>\\\nFear of mistakes also creates a strong desire to play it safe. When evaluating opportunities, your inner voice may tell you to stick to the known, do things you have always done before, avoid experimentation, ignore challenges, and reject opportunities that are risky. Constant vigilance to “avoid mistakes at all costs” can lead to further stress and anxiety. Treat mistakes as a temporary diversion that requires you to reevaluate your path, but does not prevent you from reaching your destination.</p><p>\\\n<em>Am I giving up because I am worried about failing?</em></p><p><em>What risks can I see upfront, and how can I plan for them?</em></p><p><em>What changes to the strategy can help me continue without having to quit?</em></p><blockquote><p>A mistake is an experience, choice or concept it is necessary for us to have or make in order to evolve beyond it. Errors can be the launchpad of great ideas.</p></blockquote><p>\\\nMistakes are not terrible personal failings that need to be denied or justified; they are inevitable aspects of life that can help you grow. Stop hiding. Let yourself be seen as a flawed human being who makes mistakes and fails at times.</p><p>When your focus is to be recognized, seen, and rewarded individually for your work, you see people on your team as competition and try to fly solo instead of being a collaborative team member. You hide information to have an upper edge. You refuse to help out to gain appreciation for your work, as others are struggling. You don’t communicate often, which leads to misunderstandings and confusion. Thinking that others' disadvantages can be your advantage, their challenges can be your opportunity, and their failures are your moments to shine, attract attention, and flaunt your achievements, can make you engage in behavior that benefits you, even at the cost of teamwork.</p><p>\\\nBelieving that others' success can lower your chances of succeeding makes you extremely cautious about how your contributions benefit you and not others.</p><p>\\\n<em>I am here to get my work done, not help others.</em></p><p><em>I have to do what’s best for me.</em></p><p><em>If they succeed, I’ll fail.</em></p><p>\\\nBut seeing others as competitors instead of partners breaks down collaboration—wrong assumptions are made, deadlines are missed, and misunderstandings become a common phenomenon instead of a one-off thing.  and rivalry lead to wasted time as everyone tries to protect themselves by offloading blame to others—there are long debates, complaints, disagreements, and unnecessary discussions instead of focusing on resolving issues, designing solutions, and working hard to provide quality deliverables.</p><p>\\\nInstead of trying to win alone, invest in succeeding as a group. You can create more impact and contribute your true value by seeing others as people on your team and not your rivals. Working together can lead to better generation of ideas, quick resolutions, and the shared camaraderie can have positive effects on the mental well-being of everyone involved in the effort. Share ideas, help others, give credit. Treat others as your allies, not your means of leverage.</p><p>\\\n<em>How can we work better together as a team?</em></p><p><em>What do others know that I might be missing?</em></p><p><em>In what ways can I help others or seek their help to achieve shared goals?</em></p><blockquote><p>Collaborators don’t steal others’ ideas, take advantage of people, or sit back while others accomplish their tasks for them. Collaborators take action to ensure that everyone with whom they work can enjoy the maximum potential outcome.</p></blockquote><p>\\\nWhen you look at others with the desire to beat them, individual goals become a primary focus area instead of collective wins. But your success does not matter when your team loses in the end. Change your goal from competing to collaborating. Succeed together, not alone.</p><ol><li>The goal to prove your worth makes you come across as boastful, needy, and insecure, while the desire to improve yourself earns you respect, builds your skills, and prepares you to take on whatever comes next.</li><li>When you flaunt your achievements or try to show off your work, you come across as an egoist and a self-centered person. Others try to avoid you instead of leveraging your knowledge and experience. Instead of boasting, showcase your value by asking meaningful questions and helping others arrive at their own solutions.</li><li>Ambiguity and uncertainty scare you off when your goal is to maintain your image and establish your expertise. You stay inside your comfort zone and keep doing the work you’ve always done before. But staying within your comfort zone and rejecting new opportunities makes you stagnate as others move ahead. Instead of playing it safe, take risks by signing up for activities that require you to navigate complexity, build new skills, and solve problems you’ve never solved before.</li><li>Praise brings happiness, satisfaction, and pride. But, while it boosts your self-esteem momentarily, it prevents you from investing in long-term growth. Not knowing where you’re falling short keeps you blind to your own flaws and inadequacies. Instead of seeking constant praise, ask for criticism of your work. Look for ways to do better, not proving you’re the best.</li><li>Mistakes seem bad when you tie them to your competence. You try to hide them as you worry they’ll damage your credibility and hurt your reputation. But failing to learn from mistakes keeps you from preventing them in the future. Instead of treating mistakes as personal failings, treat them as opportunities to reduce your errors. Improve your future by accepting the present mess.</li><li>When others' success is considered a threat to your own accomplishments, you prioritize individual goals over collective team success.

For short trajectories, human raters are only slightly better than random chance at distinguishing between clips of the simulation and the actual game.  We measure LPIPS (Zhang et al., 2018) and PSNR using the teacher-forcing setup described in Section 2, where we sample an initial state and predict a single frame based on a trajectory of ground-truth past observations. When evaluated over a random holdout of 2048 trajectories taken in 5 different levels, our model achieves a PSNR of 29.43 and an LPIPS of 0.249. The PSNR value is similar to lossy JPEG compression with quality settings of 20-30 (Petric &amp; Milinkovic, 2018). Figure 5 shows examples of model predictions and the corresponding ground truth samples.</p><p> We use the auto-regressive setup described in Section 2, where we iteratively sample frames following the sequences of actions defined by the ground-truth trajectory, while conditioning the model on its own past predictions. When sampled auto-regressively, the predicted and groundtruth trajectories often diverge after a few steps, mostly due to the accumulation of small amounts of different movement velocities between frames in each trajectory. For that reason, per-frame PSNR and LPIPS values gradually decrease and increase respectively, as can be seen in Figure 6. The predicted trajectory is still similar to the actual game in terms of content and image quality, but per-frame metrics are limited in their ability to capture this (see Appendix A.1 for samples of autoregressively generated trajectories).</p><p>We therefore measure the FVD (Unterthiner et al., 2019) computed over a random holdout of 512 trajectories, measuring the distance between the predicted and ground truth trajectory distributions, for simulations of length 16 frames (0.8 seconds) and 32 frames (1.6 seconds). For 16 frames our model obtains an FVD of 114.02. For 32 frames our model obtains an FVD of 186.23.</p><p>\\\n As another measurement of simulation quality, we provided 10 human raters with 130 random short clips (of lengths 1.6 seconds and 3.2 seconds) of our simulation side by side with the real game. The raters were tasked with recognizing the real game (see Figure 14 in Appendix A.6). The raters only choose the actual game over the simulation in 58% or 60% of the time (for the 1.6 seconds and 3.2 seconds clips, respectively).</p><p>To evaluate the importance of the different components of our methods, we sample trajectories from the evaluation dataset and compute LPIPS and PSNR metrics between the ground truth and the predicted frames.</p><p>We evaluate the impact of changing the number N of past observations in the conditioning context by training models with N ∈ {1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64} (recall that our method uses N = 64). This affects both the number of historical frames and actions. We train the models for 200,000 steps keeping the decoder frozen and evaluate on test-set trajectories from 5 levels. See the results in Table 1. As expected, we observe that generation quality improves with the length of the context. Interestingly, we observe that while the improvement is large at first (e.g. between 1 and 2 frames), we quickly approach an asymptote and further increasing the context size provides only small improvements in quality. This is somewhat surprising as even with our maximal context length, the model only has access to a little over 3 seconds of history. Notably, we observe that much of the game state is persisted for much longer periods (see Section 7). While the length of the conditioning context is an important limitation, Table 1 hints that we’d likely need to change the architecture of our model to efficiently support longer contexts, and employ better selection of the past frames to condition on, which we leave for future work.</p><p>\\\n</p><p>To ablate the impact of noise augmentation we train a model without added noise. We evaluate both our standard model with noise augmentation and the model without added noise (after 200k training steps) auto-regressively and compute PSNR and LPIPS metrics between the predicted frames and the ground-truth over a random holdout of 512 trajectories. We report average metric values for each auto-regressive step up to a total of 64 frames in Figure 7.</p><p>Without noise augmentation, LPIPS distance from the ground truth increases rapidly compared to our standard noise-augmented model, while PSNR drops, indicating a divergence of the simulation from ground truth.</p><p>We compare training on agent-generated data to training on data generated using a random policy. For the random policy, we sample actions following a uniform categorical distribution that doesn’t depend on the observations. We compare the random and agent datasets by training 2 models for 700k steps along with their decoder. The models are evaluated on a dataset of 2048 human-play trajectories from 5 levels. We compare the first frame of generation, conditioned on a history context of 64 ground-truth frames, as well as a frame after 3 seconds of auto-regressive generation. Overall, we observe that training the model on random trajectories works surprisingly well, but is limited by the exploration ability of the random policy. When comparing the single frame generation the agent works only slightly better, achieving a PNSR of 25.06 vs 24.42 for the random policy. When comparing a frame after 3 seconds of auto-regressive generation, the difference increases to 19.02 vs 16.84. When playing with the model manually, we observe that some areas are very easy for both, some areas are very hard for both, and in some the agent performs much better. With that, we manually split 456 examples into 3 buckets: easy, medium, and hard, manually, based on their distance from the starting position in the game. We observe that on the easy and hard sets, the agent performs only slightly better than random, while on the medium set the difference is much larger in favor of the agent as expected (see Table 2). See Figure 13 in Appendix A.5 for an example of the scores during a single session of human play.</p><p>:::info\nThis paper is  under CC by 4.0 Deed (Attribution 4.0 International) license.</p>","contentLength":6364,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Tiny startup Arcee AI built a 400B-parameter open source LLM from scratch to best Meta’s Llama","url":"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/28/tiny-startup-arcee-ai-built-a-400b-open-source-llm-from-scratch-to-best-metas-llama/","date":1769621400,"author":"Julie Bort","guid":425449,"unread":true,"content":"<article>30-person startup Arcee AI has released a 400B model called Trinity, which it says is one of the biggest open source foundation models from a U.S. company.</article>","contentLength":155,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Minnesota’s Top Judge Exposes DOJ’s Desperate Attempt To Salvage A Bunch Of Church Protest Arrest Warrants","url":"https://www.techdirt.com/2026/01/28/minnesotas-top-judge-exposes-dojs-desperate-attempt-to-salvage-a-bunch-of-church-protest-arrest-warrants/","date":1769620980,"author":"Tim Cushing","guid":425466,"unread":true,"content":"<p>First off, there’s a chance my headline (which went through several iterations) undersells what’s actually going on here. What’s detailed below is yet another jaw-dropping act of executive hubris, with the DOJ again deciding it can do whatever the hell it wants when a judge <a href=\"https://www.techdirt.com/2025/07/28/2nd-whistleblower-confirms-trump-judge-pick-told-doj-to-say-fuck-you-to-federal-courts-opposing-mass-deportation-efforts/\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"https://www.techdirt.com/2025/07/28/2nd-whistleblower-confirms-trump-judge-pick-told-doj-to-say-fuck-you-to-federal-courts-opposing-mass-deportation-efforts/\">dares to tell it “no.”</a></p><p>A little background: it was discovered at some point that the acting director of the St. Paul ICE field office, David Easterwood, was <a href=\"https://www.citieschurch.com/leadership\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"https://www.citieschurch.com/leadership\">also a pastor of Cities Church</a>, also located in St. Paul, Minnesota. A protest naturally followed. A bit more unnaturally, protesters entered the church and disrupted the service. CNN’s Don Lemon covered the protest, drawing some fire of his own simply for being a rather persistent critic of the Trump administration and its actions. </p><blockquote><p><em>U.S. Department of Justice Assistant Attorney General Harmeet Dhillon said her agency is investigating federal civil rights violations “by these people desecrating a house of worship and interfering with Christian worshippers.”</em></p><p><em>“A house of worship is not a public forum for your protest! It is a space protected from exactly such acts by federal criminal and civil laws!” she said on social media.</em></p><p><em>Attorney General Pam Bondi also weighed in on social media, saying that any violations of federal law would be prosecuted.</em></p></blockquote><p>You’ll note the qualifier AAG Dhillon used in this exclamation point-riddled X missive: “ worshippers.” That sort of thing matters, because it makes it clear (perhaps unintentionally) that this government won’t mind if  protesters disrupt religious services engaged in by members of  religions. (You know exactly what I mean as assuredly as Dhillon knew what she meant when posted that response to the protest.)</p><p>Meanwhile, in my home state, Kristi Noem’s successor, Governor Larry Rhoden, <a href=\"https://www.mitchellrepublic.com/news/south-dakota/gov-rhoden-proposes-stiffer-penalties-for-threats-or-violence-that-prevent-religious-practices\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"https://www.mitchellrepublic.com/news/south-dakota/gov-rhoden-proposes-stiffer-penalties-for-threats-or-violence-that-prevent-religious-practices\">announced legislation that would turn the misdemeanor offense</a> of using threats or violent acts to prevent people from practicing their religion into a felony that would double the jail time and fine for those convicted of this offense (bringing it to 2 years in jail and a $4,000 fine). </p><blockquote><p><em>“If religious liberties fail, any other liberty eventually fails with it,” Rhoden said during a press conference. “If someone decides to target a house of worship, there will be real consequences.”</em></p></blockquote><p>OK. Well, we’ll see how this gets selectively enforced in the future. I’m pretty sure some religions are more deserving of protection than others, even if the governor does better at keeping the quiet part quiet than Harmeet Dhillon did. </p><p>Long story short: the federal magistrate judge <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2026/01/22/don-lemon-prosecution-justice-department-00741629\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2026/01/22/don-lemon-prosecution-justice-department-00741629\">rejected five of the eight arrest warrants</a> presented by DOJ prosecutors, including the two targeting Don Lemon and his producer. Rejected arrest warrants are probably even less common than rejected search warrants. But the DOJ continues to fail its way into history under AG Pam Bondi and the second Trump administration. </p><p>Like search warrants, those presenting them to judges have options when judges reject their offerings. They can revise them, perhaps sprinkling them with a bit more probable cause or other connective tissue. Or they can decide to buttress apparently bogus charges by talking a grand jury into signing off on an indictment. </p><p>But with grand juries brushing off the DOJ repeatedly in recent months and prosecutors desperate to keep winning the battle of headlines, the DOJ went an entirely different direction — a direction so unexpected and unprecedented that the state’s top federal judge felt compelled to write  letters to the Eighth Circuit Appeals Court. Not only did the DOJ ask the Appeals Court to directly review the warrants that had been directed, it did this without notice to the lower court  asked the appeals court to seal its request to keep it from being made public. </p><blockquote><p><em>[C]hief Judge Schiltz is a highly regarded jurist who could not be accused of having an axe to grind against the current administration. And that’s all the more reason why&nbsp;everyone, but especially his colleagues across the federal judiciary, ought to take seriously a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.ca8.113669/gov.uscourts.ca8.113669.00805439054.0.pdf\">pair</a>&nbsp;of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.ca8.113669/gov.uscourts.ca8.113669.00805439055.0.pdf\">letters</a>&nbsp;he filed on Friday in response to <strong>an extraordinary (in multiple senses of the word) attempt by the Department of Justice to end-run long-settled understandings of basic criminal procedure in order to bring federal criminal charges against individuals</strong> who protested inside a St. Paul church last Sunday.</em></p><p><em><strong>The Schiltz letters are striking not only because of who wrote them, but because of the deeply unprofessional behavior they describe.</strong></em></p></blockquote><p>The first letter opens with this: </p><blockquote><p><em>I am working from home today, as the program that my mentally disabled adult son attends each day is closed because of the extreme cold <strong>At 11:34 am, I received an email regarding Case No. 26-1135, entitled “In re: United States of America.” </strong>The order in its entirety read:</em></p><p><em><strong>The motion of the United States to seal is granted.</strong> The Chief Judge of the United States District Court for the District of Minnesota is invited to file a response, at his discretion, to the petition for writ of mandamus. <strong>Any response is due by 2:00 p.m. Friday, January 23.</strong></em></p><p><em>This is the first that I have heard of any petition for a writ of mandamus. <strong>The United States did not have the courtesy to tell me that they would be filing such a petition, nor did the United States serve the petition on me. I am unable to access any documents in Case No. 26-1135 because, at the request of the United States, the case is sealed-apparently even from me.</strong> So I have been given about two-and-one-half hours to respond to a mandamus petition that I have not read and cannot read.</em></p><p><em>Apparently I am supposed to guess what the petition is about and guess what the mandamus petition says and then respond.</em></p></blockquote><p>On the evening of Tuesday, January 20, five of the eight arrest warrants were rejected by the magistrate judge. Within “minutes,” the DOJ prosecutor was demanding an immediate review of the magistrates’ rejections. The review was assigned to Judge Schiltz, who told the DOJ that because what it was demanding was “unprecedented,” he would hold a bench meeting with the other district judges to decide how to proceed. </p><p>Somewhat ironically, that meeting was postponed due to “security concerns” related to the arrival of both J.D. Vance and AG Pam Bondi in Minneapolis, along with protests at the courthouse where two church protesters were scheduled to make their initial appearances. The meeting was postponed to January 27th. </p><p>That wasn’t good enough for the DOJ, which had headlines it wanted to keep making. So, it went directly to the Appeals Court, said some extremely disingenuous stuff about “national security” and the ongoing danger of church disruptions if it wasn’t able to arrest three more protesters immediately. (It appears to have given up on locking up Don Lemon.)</p><p>Judge Schiltz’s follow-up email shreds the government’s justifications for immediate judicial review of its rejected arrest warrant: </p><blockquote><p><em><strong>The government’s arguments about the urgency of its request makes no sense.</strong> As the government says, “dozens” of protestors invaded Cities Church on Sunday. <strong>The leaders of that group have been arrested, and everyone knows that they have been arrested.</strong> The government says that there are plans to disrupt Cities Church again on Sunday. Of course, the best way to protect Cities Church is to protect Cities Church; we have thousands of law-enforcement officers in town, and presumably a few of them could be stationed outside of Cities Church on Sunday. </em><strong><em>The government does not explain why the arrests of five more people – one of whom is a journalist and the other his producer – would make Cities Church any safer, especially because that would still leave “dozens” of those who invaded the church on Sunday free to do it again</em>.</strong></p></blockquote><p>Judge Shiltz should be commended for making sure all of this ends up the permanent record. The government tried to bury its attempt to bypass the normal chain of judicial command, but that has only led to it being further exposed as the thugs they are and definitely intend to be. The DOJ is supposed to hold the law in utmost esteem. But this version continues to act as though the law is whatever it says it is.</p><p>For now, the DOJ will still need to wait for a review of its deficient warrants by the lower court. The Appeals Court has rejected its end-around effort, albeit without saying anything more than it might be a little premature. But what  actually said by a judge concurring with the rejection of the writ of mandamus isn’t exactly heartening: </p><blockquote><p><em>“The Complaint and Affidavit clearly establish probable cause for all five arrest warrants, and while there is no discretion to refuse to issue an arrest warrant once probable cause for its issuance has been shown … the government has failed to establish that it has no other adequate means of obtaining the requested relief,” Grasz wrote.</em></p></blockquote><p>Hey, Judge Grasz, if you’re concurring with the rejection of an “emergency” review of the merits of rejected search warrants, maybe you should keep your views on the merits to yourself. Unless, of course, you’re just signalling the Trump Administration that it should speed run the alternatives so the warrants can receive your thumbs up once they return to the appellate level. </p><p>For now, the warrants are dead. Unfortunately, the DOJ will have probably moved on to some new horrific thing before these get a second pass by the district court.</p>","contentLength":9445,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Tim Berners-Lee Wants Us To Take Back the Internet","url":"https://tech.slashdot.org/story/26/01/28/1650231/tim-berners-lee-wants-us-to-take-back-the-internet?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&utm_medium=feed","date":1769620920,"author":"msmash","guid":425458,"unread":true,"content":"mspohr shares a report: When Sir Tim Berners-Lee invented the world wide web in 1989, his vision was clear: it would used by everyone, filled with everything and, crucially, it would be free. Today, the British computer scientist's creation is regularly used by 5.5 billion people -- and bears little resemblance to the democratic force for humanity he intended. \n\nSince Berners-Lee's disappointment a decade ago, he's thrown everything at a project that completely shifts the way data is held on the web, known as the Solid (social linked data) protocol. It's activism that is rooted in people power -- not unlike the first years of the web. \n\nThis version of the internet would turbocharge personal sovereignty and give control back to users. Berners-Lee has long seen AI -- which exists only because of the web and its data -- as having the potential to transform society far beyond the boundaries of self-interested companies. But now is the time, he says, to put guardrails in place so that AI remains a force for good -- and he's afraid the chance may pass humankind by. Berners-Lee traces the web's corruption to the commercialization of the domain name system in the 1990s, when the .com space was \"pounced on by charlatans.\" The 2016 US elections, he said, revealed to him just how toxic his creation could become. A corner of the web, he says, has been \"optimised for nastiness\" -- extractive, surveillance-heavy, and designed to maximize engagement at the cost of user wellbeing. \n\nHis answer is Solid, a protocol that gives users control through personal data \"pods\" functioning as secure backpacks of information. The Flanders government in Belgium already uses Solid pods for its citizens.

It then enters a loop where it keeps receiving the model’s responses. If the model’s reply includes a specific trigger like <code>USE_TOOL:get_current_time</code>, the agent calls a helper function to get the current time. Adds both the tool request and the tool result back into the message history and continues the conversation. If the reply doesn’t request a tool, the agent assumes the task is complete and returns the final response.</p><pre><code>import os\nimport openai\nfrom openai import \n\nopenai.api_key = \"YOUR_API_KEY\"\n\ndef run_agent(task):\n    messages = [\n        {\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": SYSTEM_PROMPT},\n        {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": task}\n    ]\n\n    while True:\n        response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(\n            model=\"gpt-4\",\n            messages=messages\n        )\n\n        reply = response[\"choices\"][0][\"message\"][\"content\"]\n\n        if \"USE_TOOL:get_current_time\" in reply:\n            time = get_current_time()\n            messages.append({\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": reply})\n            messages.append({\"role\": \"tool\", \"content\": time})\n        else:\n            return reply\n</code></pre><p>Finally, add below lines of code in your script and execute to test it.</p><pre><code>task = \"What time is it right now, and should I grab a coffee?\"\nresult = run_agent(task)\nprint(result)\n</code></pre><p>Congratulation!

When you strip away the buzzwords, it is still just a system running in a loop, holding context, making decisions, and calling tools when needed. The only new part is that the “” piece can now be done by an LLM.</p><p>I have found that agents make a lot more sense when you treat them like yet another engineering component and not like a futuristic sci-fi concept.

The agent is provided with downscaled versions of the frame images and in-game map, each at resolution 160x120. The agent also has access to the last 32 actions it performed.

We train the agent to play the game using the Vizdoom environment (Wydmuch et al., 2019). We run 8 games in parallel, each with a replay buffer size of 512, a discount factor γ = 0.99, and an entropy coefficient of 0.1.

But when the GitHub Copilot CLI team asked for a small entrance banner for the new command-line experience, they discovered the opposite: An ASCII animation in a real-world terminal is one of the most constrained UI engineering problems you can take on.</p><p>Part of what makes this even more interesting is the moment we’re in. Over the past year, CLIs have seen a surge of investment as AI-assisted and agentic workflows move directly into the terminal. But unlike the web—where design systems, accessibility standards, and rendering models are well-established—the CLI world is still fragmented. Terminals behave differently, have few shared standards, and offer almost no consistent accessibility guidelines. That reality shaped every engineering decision in this project.</p><p>Different terminals interpret ANSI color codes differently. Screen readers treat fast-changing characters as noise. Layout engines vary. Buffers flicker. Some users override global colors for accessibility. Others throttle redraw speed. There is no canvas, no compositor, no consistent rendering model, and no standard animation framework.</p><p>So when an animated Copilot mascot flying into the terminal appeared, it looked playful. But behind it was serious engineering work, unexpected complexity, a custom design toolchain, and a tight pairing between a designer and a long-time CLI engineer.</p><p>That complexity only became fully visible once the system was built. In the end, animating a three-second ASCII banner required over 6,000 lines of TypeScript—most of it dedicated not to visuals, but to handling terminal inconsistencies, accessibility constraints, and maintainable rendering logic.</p><p>This is the technical story of how it came together.</p><h2>Why animated ASCII is a hard engineering problem</h2><p>Before diving into the build process, it’s worth calling out why this problem space is more advanced than it looks.</p><h3>Terminals don’t have a canvas</h3><p>Unlike browsers (DOM), native apps (views), or graphics frameworks (GPU surfaces), terminals treat output as a . There’s no native concept of:</p><ul></ul><p>Because of this, every “frame” has to be manually repainted using cursor movements and redraw commands. There’s no compositor smoothing anything over behind the scenes. Everything is stdout writes + ANSI control sequences.</p><h3>ANSI escape codes are inconsistent, and terminal color is its own engineering challenge</h3><p>ANSI escape codes like  (bright magenta) or  (cursor home) behave differently across terminals—not just in how they render, but in <em>whether they’re supported at all</em>. Some environments (like Windows Command Prompt or older versions of PowerShell) have limited or no ANSI support without extra configuration.</p><p>But even in terminals that do support ANSI, the hardest part isn’t the cursor movement. It’s the colors.</p><p>When you’re building a CLI, you realistically have three approaches:</p><ol><li>This guarantees broad compatibility, but makes it harder to highlight meaning or guide users’ attention—especially in dense CLI output.</li><li><strong>Use richer color modes (3-bit, 4-bit, 8-bit, or truecolor)</strong> that aren’t uniformly supported or customizable. This introduces a maintenance headache: Different terminals, themes, and accessibility profiles render the same color codes differently, and users often disagree about what “good” colors look like.</li><li><strong>Use a minimal, customizable palette (usually 4-bit colors)</strong> that most terminals allow users to override in their preferences. This is the safest path, but it limits how accurately you can represent a brand palette—and it forces you to design for environments with widely varying contrast and theme choices.</li></ol><p>For the Copilot CLI animation, this meant treating color as a  system, not a literal one: Instead of committing specific RGB values, the team mapped high-level “roles” (eyes, goggles, shadow, border) to ANSI colors that degrade gracefully across different terminals and accessibility settings.</p><h3>Accessibility is a first-class concern</h3><p>Terminals are used by developers with a wide range of visual abilities—not just blind users with screen readers, but also low-vision users, color-blind users, and anyone working in high-contrast or customized themes.</p><ul><li>Rapid re-renders can create auditory clutter for screen readers</li><li>Color-based meaning must degrade safely, since bold, dim, or subtle hues may not be perceivable</li><li>Low-vision users may not see contrast differences that designers expect</li><li>Animations must be opt-in, not automatic</li><li>Clearing sequences must avoid confusing assistive technologies</li></ul><p>This is also why the Copilot CLI animation ended up behind an opt-in flag early on—accessibility constraints shaped the architecture from the start.&nbsp;</p><p>These constraints guided every decision in the Copilot CLI animation. The banner had to work when colors were overridden, when contrast was limited, and even when the animation itself wasn’t visible.</p><h3>Ink (React for the terminal) helps, but it’s not an animation engine</h3><p><a href=\"https://github.com/vadimdemedes/ink\">Ink</a> lets you build terminal interfaces using React components, but:</p><ul><li>It re-renders on every state change</li><li>It doesn’t manage frame deltas</li><li>It doesn’t synchronize with terminal paint cycles</li><li>It doesn’t solve flicker or cursor ghosting</li></ul><p>Which meant animation logic had to be handcrafted.</p><h3>Frame-based ASCII animation has no existing workflow for designers</h3><p>There are tools for ASCII art, but virtually none for:</p><ul><li>Multi-color ANSI previews</li><li>Generating Ink-ready components</li><li>Testing contrast and accessibility</li></ul><p>Even existing ANSI preview tools don’t simulate how different terminals remap colors or handle cursor updates, which makes accurate design iteration almost impossible without custom tooling. So the team had to build one.</p><h2>Part 1: A request that didn’t fit any workflow</h2><p>Cameron Foxly (<a href=\"https://github.com/cameronfoxly\">@cameronfoxly</a>), a brand designer at GitHub with a background in animation, was asked to create a banner for the Copilot CLI.</p><p>“Normally, I’d build something in After Effects and hand off assets,” Cameron said. “But engineers didn’t have the time to manually translate animation frames into a CLI. And honestly, I wanted something more fun.”</p><p>He’d seen the static ASCII intro in Claude Code and knew Copilot deserved more personality.</p><p>The 3D Copilot mascot flying in to reveal the CLI logo felt right. But after attempting to create just  frame manually, the idea quickly ran into reality.</p><p>“It was a nightmare,” Cameron said. “If this is going to exist, I need to build my own tool.”</p><h2>Part 2: Building an ASCII animation editor from scratch</h2><p>Cameron opened an empty repository in VS Code, and began asking GitHub Copilot for help scaffolding an animation MVP that could:</p><ul><li>Read text files as frames</li><li>Clear the screen without flicker</li></ul><p>Within an hour, he had a working prototype that was monochrome, but functional.</p><h3>Simplified early animation loop</h3><p>Below is a simplified example variation of the frame loop logic Cameron prototyped:</p><pre><code>import fs from \"fs\";\nimport readline from \"readline\";\n\n/**\n * Load ASCII frames from a directory.\n */\nconst frames = fs\n  .readdirSync(\"./frames\")\n  .filter(f =&gt; f.endsWith(\".txt\"))\n  .map(f =&gt; fs.readFileSync(`./frames/${f}`, \"utf8\"));\n\nlet current = 0;\n\nfunction render() {\n  // Move cursor to top-left of terminal\n  readline.cursorTo(process.stdout, 0, 0);\n\n  // Clear the screen below the cursor\n  readline.clearScreenDown(process.stdout);\n\n  // Write the current frame\n  process.stdout.write(frames[current]);\n\n  // Advance to next frame\n  current = (current + 1) % frames.length;\n}\n\n// 75ms = ~13fps. Higher can cause flicker in some terminals.\nsetInterval(render, 75);</code></pre><p>This introduced the first major obstacle: color. The prototype worked in monochrome, but the moment color was added, inconsistencies across terminals—and accessibility constraints—became the dominant engineering problem.</p><h2>Part 3: ANSI color theory and the real-world limitations</h2><p>The Copilot brand palette is vibrant and high-contrast, which is great for web but exceptionally challenging for terminals.</p><ul><li>256-color mode (extended)</li><li>Sometimes truecolor (“24-bit”) but inconsistently</li></ul><p>Even in 256-color mode, terminals remap colors based on:</p><ul></ul><p>Which means you can’t rely on exact hues. You have to design with variability in mind.</p><p>Cameron needed a way to paint characters with ANSI color roles while previewing how they look in different terminals.</p><p>He took a screenshot of the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSI_escape_code#Colors\">Wikipedia ANSI table</a>, handed it to Copilot, and asked it to scaffold a palette UI for his tool.</p><pre><code>function applyColor(char, color) {\n  // Minimal example: real implementation needed support for roles,\n  // contrast testing, and multiple ANSI modes.\n  const codes = {\n    magenta: \"\\x1b[35m\",\n    cyan: \"\\x1b[36m\",\n    white: \"\\x1b[37m\"\n  };\n\n  return `${codes[color]}${char}\\x1b[0m`; // Reset after each char\n}</code></pre><p>This enabled Cameron to paint ANSI-colored ASCII like you would in Photoshop, one character at a time.</p><p>But now he had to export it into the real Copilot CLI codebase.</p><h2>Part 4: Exporting to Ink (React for the terminal)</h2><p><a href=\"https://github.com/vadimdemedes/ink\">Ink</a> is a React renderer for building CLIs using JSX components. Instead of writing to the DOM, components render to stdout.</p><p>Cameron asked Copilot to help generate an Ink component that would:</p><ul><li>Animate them with state updates</li><li>Integrate cleanly into the CLI codebase</li></ul><h3>Simplified Ink frame renderer</h3><pre><code>import React from \"react\";\nimport { Box, Text } from \"ink\";\n\n/**\n * Render a single ASCII frame.\n */\nexport const CopilotBanner = ({ frame }) =&gt; (\n  &lt;Box flexDirection=\"column\"&gt;\n    {frame.split(\"\\n\").map((line, i) =&gt; (\n      &lt;Text key={i}&gt;{line}&lt;/Text&gt;\n    ))}\n  &lt;/Box&gt;\n);</code></pre><p>And a minimal animation wrapper:</p><pre><code>export const AnimatedBanner = () =&gt; {\n  const [i, setI] = React.useState(0);\n\n  React.useEffect(() =&gt; {\n    const id = setInterval(() =&gt; setI(x =&gt; (x + 1) % frames.length), 75);\n    return () =&gt; clearInterval(id);\n  }, []);\n\n  return &lt;CopilotBanner frame={frames[i]} /&gt;;\n};</code></pre><p>This gave Cameron the confidence to open a pull request (his first engineering pull request in nine years at GitHub).</p><p>“Copilot filled in syntax I didn’t know,” Cameron said. “But I still made all the architectural decisions.”</p><p>Now it was time for the engineering team to turn a prototype into something production-worthy.</p><h2>Part 5: Terminal animation isn’t solved technology</h2><p>Andy Feller (<a href=\"https://github.com/andyfeller\">@andyfeller</a>), a long-time GitHub engineer behind the GitHub CLI, partnered with Cameron to bring the animation into the Copilot CLI codebase.</p><p>Unlike browsers—which share rendering engines, accessibility APIs, and standards like WCAG—terminal environments are a patchwork of behaviors inherited from decades-old hardware like the VT100. There’s no DOM, no semantic structure, and only partial agreement on capabilities across terminals. This makes even “simple” UI design problems in the terminal uniquely challenging, especially as AI-driven workflows push CLIs into daily use for more developers.</p><p>“There’s no framework for terminal animations,” Andy explained. “We had to figure out how to do this without flickering, without breaking accessibility, and across wildly different terminals.”</p><p>Andy broke the engineering challenges into four broad categories:</p><h3>Challenge 1: From banner to ready without flickering</h3><p>Most terminals repaint the entire viewport when new content arrives. At the same time, CLIs come with a strict usability expectation: when developers run a command, they want to get to work immediately. Any animation that flickers, blocks input, or lingers too long actively degrades the experience.</p><p>This created a core tension the team had to resolve: how to introduce a brief, animated banner without slowing startup, stealing focus, or destabilizing the terminal render loop.</p><p>In practice, this was complicated by the fact that terminals behave differently under load. Some:</p><ul><li>Reveal cleared frames momentarily</li><li>Buffer output differently</li><li>Repaint the cursor region inconsistently</li></ul><p>To avoid flicker while keeping the CLI responsive across popular terminals like iTerm2, Windows Terminal, and VS Code, the team had to carefully coordinate several interdependent concerns:</p><ul><li>Keeping the animation under three seconds so it never delayed user interaction</li><li>Separating static and non-static components to minimize unnecessary redraws</li><li>Initializing MCP servers, custom agents, and user setup without blocking render</li><li>Working within Ink’s asynchronous re-rendering model</li></ul><p>The result was an animation treated as a non-blocking, best-effort enhancement—visible when it could be rendered safely, but never at the expense of startup performance or usability.</p><h3>Challenge 2: Brand color mapping in ANSI</h3><p>“ANSI color consistency simply doesn’t exist,” Andy said.&nbsp;</p><p>Most modern terminals support 8-bit color, allowing CLIs to choose from 256 colors. However, how those colors are actually rendered varies widely based on terminal themes, OS settings, and user accessibility overrides. In practice, CLIs can’t rely on exact hues—or even consistent contrast—across environments.</p><p>The Copilot banner introduced an additional complexity: although it’s rendered using text characters, the block-letter Copilot logo functions as a , not readable body text.

I’ve been dealing with spinning threads for many years now, and I won’t lie: over the years I’ve been both on the offender and victim side.\nI’m getting tired of seeing the same issues again and again, which usually makes for a good reason to write a blog post so that, hopefully, people will read it and stop making the same mistakes others did.</p><p>Actually, many others have written about this, covering various issues related to spin locks . But I guess there’s never enough material on those subjects. Some are about speed, others about fairness, a few about priority inversion, NUMA, and sometimes even about actually broken code.\nIf this list hasn’t convinced you that things do spin out of control when using spin-locks, and that you should use OS primitives instead, keep reading. I’ll cover what you should not do when implementing your own spin-lock. Notice I said what you should  do, because, , you should  not use a spin-lock at all these days.\nAnd if you do… make sure you really, REALLY,  know what you’re doing (<em>spoiler: it will always come back to bite you when you least expect it</em>).</p><p>Note this is a story about spin loops in general, not about locking algorithms for which there are many .</p><p>Let’s start with the basics, you want to implement your own spinlock.</p><blockquote><p>🤪 “It’s easy! You simply have a boolean, a  and an  function.”</p></blockquote><p><em>For demonstration purposes, we are using  instead of  as you might have something more complicated to do with it, such as storing metadata (for example: the thread ID). There are also quite a few pieces of code around that do not implement a spin-lock per se, but mutate some other content such as pointers.</em></p><pre tabindex=\"0\" data-language=\"cpp\"><code></code></pre><p>Those who have dealt with multi-threading before will immediately spot the issue. The code is not thread-safe as, if multiple threads attempt to use this lock, we could read invalid values of  (<em>in theory, and on a CPU where tearing could happen on its word size</em>).\nWorse, even if this could not happen, a wild race-condition could appear.\nConsider the following example where two threads would call  at the exact same time:</p><pre tabindex=\"0\" data-language=\"plaintext\"><code></code></pre><p>Now we have two threads who think they have successfully acquired the lock!</p><p>Some may also have heard about this shiny little thing called  variables/operations.\nTo oversimplify: atomic operations guarantee that other threads cannot observe a partial/intermediate state of the operation and thus race-conditions can not occur (<em>on those specific operations and memory</em>).</p><blockquote><p>💡 While named after the Greek  that means “that which cannot be divided”,  operations might as well be as dangerous and difficult to use as nuclear energy.</p></blockquote><p>Let’s replace  by an atomic version: . Though our code does not suffer from a race-condition on the data itself, we still do not know if the thread that sets  to  is the one that now owns the lock. But we can now do an <a href=\"https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/atomic/atomic/exchange.html\"></a> operation atomically, which solves our little problem!</p><p>Instead of first checking if the lock is locked, then writing, we actually write our value and get the previous value, in a single atomic operation!

Otherwise we will see a , meaning the lock was already held either before we tried, or because another thread’s exchange completed before ours.</p><pre tabindex=\"0\" data-language=\"cpp\"><code></code></pre><p>Let’s replay the scenario. Even if both threads execute the exchange simultaneously, atomicity guarantees one will finish before the other, for example Thread ’s:</p><pre tabindex=\"0\" data-language=\"plaintext\"><code></code></pre><p>Good, we now have a working spin-lock, but we still have a long way to go.</p><blockquote><p>💡 In the CPU lingua, a memory / is called a memory /</p></blockquote><p>You may have realized that our spin-lock will… spin doing nothing, the loop is empty.</p><blockquote><p>🤪 “Great, it’ll attempt to take ownership faster”</p></blockquote><p>Well, that’s only true if you want to burn your CPU. Since the CPU has no way of knowing that you are waiting and not doing any meaningful work, it might stay at a high frequency.\nModern CPUs can change the frequency of the cores to save energy, and effectively also lower the CPU core temperature. This is clearly not desirable behavior, especially on mobile/embedded devices.</p><p>Not convinced or do not care about the planet? (shame on you!) Then at least think about your users’ power bill. Still not convinced? What if I told you this can actually be slower than doing something in the loop?\nImagine that a lot of threads are attempting to lock your spin-lock. Only one can win. But worse, due to its nature you always do memory writes, which need to be synchronized between the different cores of your CPU!</p><p>From Intel’s Optimization Reference Manual :</p><blockquote><p>On a modern microprocessor with a superscalar speculative execution engine, a loop like this results in the issue of\nmultiple simultaneous read requests from the spinning thread. These requests usually execute out-of-order with each\nread request being allocated a buffer resource. On detection of a write by a worker thread to a load that is in progress,\nthe processor  no violations of memory order occur. The necessity of maintaining the order of\noutstanding memory operations inevitably <strong>costs the processor a severe penalty</strong> that impacts all threads.</p></blockquote><p>And the issue will keep getting bigger with recent CPUs that have many cores and sometimes NUMA memory.</p><blockquote><p>This penalty occurs on the Intel Core Solo and Intel Core Duo processors. However, the penalty on these\nprocessors is small compared with penalties suffered on the Intel Xeon processors. There the performance penalty for\nexiting the loop is about .</p></blockquote><p>If you still need some convincing… this is even worse if you enable SMT (hyperthreading):</p><blockquote><p>On a processor supporting Intel HT Technology, spin-wait loops can consume a significant portion of the execution\nbandwidth of the processor. One logical processor executing a spin-wait loop can <strong>severely impact the performance</strong> of\nthe other logical processor.</p></blockquote><p>Now that I hopefully have your attention, here’s how to  mitigate the issue:\nThe best way to avoid “bothering” your neighbours is to  tell the CPU you are waiting to be notified of a memory change/doing a spinloop!\nOn x86 CPUs, this is done with the <a href=\"https://www.felixcloutier.com/x86/pause\"></a> instruction. It was designed exactly for this use-case!</p><blockquote><p>The penalty of exiting from a <strong>spin-wait loop can be avoided by inserting a  instruction in the loop</strong>. In spite of\nthe name, the  instruction  by introducing a slight delay in the loop and effectively\ncausing the memory read requests to be issued at a rate that allows immediate detection of any store to the\nsynchronization variable. This <strong>prevents the occurrence of a long delay due to memory order violation</strong>.</p></blockquote><p>You can modify the code to use this instruction with compiler intrinsics:</p><pre tabindex=\"0\" data-language=\"cpp\"><code></code></pre><p>As already mentioned, the penalty of synchronizing data between CPU cores is getting more expensive as new CPUs get more cores, get multiple core complexes or NUMA architectures.\nResolving conflicts (multiple cores trying to do atomic stores) thus needs to be mitigated in some way.\nA traditional approach is to use a  strategy that increases the number of  instructions for each attempt at locking.</p><p>The one you will find most (recommended by the Intel Optimization Manual, 2.7.4), is the exponential backoff:</p><pre tabindex=\"0\" data-language=\"cpp\"><code></code></pre><blockquote><p>The number of  instructions are increased by a factor of 2 until some  is reached which is subject\nto tuning.</p></blockquote><p>We also mix it with a bit of randomness by using , and let’s refactor the yielding part into a structure that can be easily swapped:</p><pre tabindex=\"0\" data-language=\"cpp\"><code></code></pre><p>Remember the comment above about  being subject to tuning?\nWell you’d better make sure to tune it for the exact CPU you’ll be working on.\nLet’s have a look at the following table listing the measured duration of  in cycles:</p><div data-astro-cid-zg6ajjo3=\"\"><table data-astro-cid-zg6ajjo3=\"\"><thead><tr></tr></thead><tbody><tr></tr></tbody></table></div><p>And that’s where the issue lies. Depending on the architecture, you may get more than 10x changes in cycles per .\nOld CPUs tended to have small  duration of  cycles on Intel,  on AMD, where  architectures have a duration of  cycles on Intel, and  cycles on AMD.\nAnd this might get worse in the future!</p><p>This actually is also now part of the latest Intel Optimization Reference Manual  2.7.4:</p><blockquote><p>The latency of the  instruction in prior generation microarchitectures is about 10 cycles, whereas in Skylake Client microarchitecture it has been extended to as many as 140 cycles.</p></blockquote><p>How to fix this, you ask? I’ll defer to Intel’s advice again and limit the duration of the  loop using CPU cycles instead of a counter:</p><pre tabindex=\"0\" data-language=\"cpp\"><code></code></pre><blockquote><p>As the  latency has been increased significantly, workloads that are sensitive to  latency will suffer some\nperformance loss.\n[…]<p>\nNotice that in the Skylake Client microarchitecture the </p> instruction counts at the machine’s guaranteed P1\nfrequency independently of the current processor clock (see the INVARIANT TSC property), and therefore, when\nrunning in Intel® Turbo-Boost-enabled mode, the delay will remain constant, but the number of instructions that\ncould have been executed will change.</p></blockquote><pre tabindex=\"0\" data-language=\"cpp\"><code></code></pre><p>This method has two main advantages:</p><ul><li>We define the max duration of a  loop in terms of  cycles, which is (on most modern CPUs) independent of the actual frequency of the core or duration of .</li><li>If the operating system happens to preempt our thread in the middle of the loop, it will stop yielding after being rescheduled if maximum duration has been exceeded. Otherwise we could call  more than necessary on a thread wakeup.</li></ul><p>You’ll notice that we kept the exponential backoff as a plain counter. This is to avoid having to compute the duration of a single  (<em>this would require getting rid of the jitter</em>).\nHowever, we still need to choose a value for . This again is purely empirical and needs tuning, but one may assume the duration of a context switch is about 3µs. Depending on the system and actual switch this can be more or be less. But it should be in the same order of magnitude.\nWe can then estimate the TSC cycles/µs conversion to be ~3200cycles/µs  for a 3.2Ghz clock. Another common frequency for the TSC is 2.5GHz.\nWhile obviously incorrect, this is a good guesstimate for a default value on PC. At worst, you’ll most likely get a 2x difference with the real value, which is way better than the x10 you could get with the varying  durations!</p><p>I did however mention this is a default value, and the best thing to do is to retrieve the real value, either from the OS or by measuring it. Sadly TSC calibration is not officially exposed by Linux/Windows, so the best way is to measure the TSC against the system high resolution clock. Ideally this should be done asynchronously (don’t do it on your application main thread at boot, please).</p><pre tabindex=\"0\" data-language=\"cpp\"><code></code></pre><blockquote><p>💡 Windows actually “exposes” this value as <a href=\"https://ntdoc.m417z.com/kuser_shared_data#cyclesperyield\"></a> in the kernel shared data at offset . This is used internally by synchronization primitives to determine how many  instructions it should issue. However I wouldn’t recommend using those internals unless your code sanitizes the value.</p></blockquote><p>We only briefly touched the topic of . All atomic operations actually take an optional parameter which is the <a href=\"https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/atomic/memory_order.html\">memory order</a>.\nI don’t want to spend too much time on this as entire talks are dedicated to it, and it’s not an easy topic.</p><p>However do know this: not providing the parameter is equivalent to using <code>std::memory_order_seq_cst</code> (sequentially consistent) which enforces the most restrictions.

I’ll play along and give it a try.</p><pre tabindex=\"0\" data-language=\"cpp\"><code></code></pre><p>Now when we reach the maximum number of iterations, we make the thread yield its quantum to the operating system (<a href=\"https://github.com/microsoft/STL/blob/cbe2ee99caf122555a305d18f69e57c75b3fe5ec/stl/src/cthread.cpp#L86\"></a> on Windows,  on Linux) so that another thread may be scheduled.\nWhile in practice this may, sometimes, solve the issue as the OS is now free to schedule other threads including the , this is not mandatory!\nSome implementations may end up just rescheduling the thread that just yielded since it’s of higher priority.</p><p>You may have also seen implementations that use  on Windows. This is better than  (which can only yield to a thread ready to run on the current core, per the <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/processthreadsapi/nf-processthreadsapi-switchtothread?redirectedfrom=MSDN\">docs</a>. Same for normal Linux schedulers). However this used to only yield to threads of  priorities, and  on the real-time version of the OS! For example on an embedded device, or a console.\nThe only way to schedule any thread on real-time kernels, be it Windows or Linux, is to sleep for a non-zero duration… which we obviously would like to avoid!</p><p>So the <a href=\"https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/blob/379d100b3cc18394064a276d7610e88a2aa09b6f/src/libraries/System.Private.CoreLib/src/System/Threading/SpinWait.cs#L183-L192\">solution</a> that the DotNet runtime team came up with is to start with , then  then !</p><pre tabindex=\"0\" data-language=\"cpp\"><code></code></pre><p>So we dealt with the priority inversion at the cost of potential sleeps.</p><p>Please god no… Yes, you () avoid the worst case scenario (), but really, is it fine?</p><p>Let’s stop for a second here and assume we never did more than yield.</p><p>As you may have already guessed, a livelock is only half the story (<em>this is starting to be a recurring pattern, isn’t it?</em>).\nThe fact is, the issue could happen even if all your threads have the same priority! (<em>Yes, I saw you coming asking for an easy fix by removing priorities.</em>)\nConsider the following scenario:</p><ul><li>4 high priority threads: , , ,  ()</li><li>4 other high priority threads: , , ,  (<em>controlled by a 3rd party, those suck.

Even though thread  might get scheduled again, it might not! This depends on your scheduler’s internals. Especially since yielding may yield only to the ready threads of the current core. At the time of writing this article, this actually is a known issue with <a href=\"https://github.com/google/sanitizers/issues/614\">Address Sanitizer</a>!</p><p>Oh, and even if it did get scheduled, you probably lost a lot of time switching from one thread to the other, this is your typical lock convoy and is what Linus Torvalds more or less hints here:</p><blockquote><p>And no, adding random “” calls while you’re spinning on the spinlock will not really help. It will easily result in scheduling storms while people are yielding to all the wrong processes.</p></blockquote><p>So no, simply using the same priority for all threads or sleeping is not fine. Let’s see what we can do about it.</p><p>The real problem, when you spin in a loop, is that you expect things to go fast so that your thread may continue.\nBut by yielding this way you defeat a lot of the kernel heuristics. It has no way to know what you actually meant, and may schedule anything (or nothing) but threads from your process. Worse, it may degrade your thread priority, move it to lower frequency cores, and you lose any kind of priority boost when waking up due to the lock being released…<p>\nThat’s clearly not what we want. If only there was a way to communicate our intent to the OS…</p></p><p>Well that’s exactly what Linux did when introducing the <a href=\"https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/futex.2.html\">futex</a> API! Since we’re waiting in a loop for a value to change, just notify the OS about it and let it handle things from there.\nWindows also implements this with the <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/synchapi/nf-synchapi-waitonaddress\"></a> API, which we’ll be demonstrating here:</p><pre tabindex=\"0\" data-language=\"cpp\"><code></code></pre><p>Windows’  internally does a single iteration before issuing the system call, but Linux’s futex API is a direct syscall. That’s why we call  only after spinning a bit.\nThis lets us have a similar spinning strategy on all platforms, which ensures a more consistent behavior.</p><blockquote><p>💡 You may notice that we always end up calling  even if there’s no other thread waiting. While not that slow on Windows, this is slow on Linux since it will do a syscall. To avoid that one would usually store some state such as the number of waiting (parked) threads.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>🤪 “Wait! Wasn’t  added to the standard recently?”</p></blockquote><p>Yes! And this is what one should have used if implementers did the right thing from the get-go (<em>and more importantly did the same thing for each implementation</em>), but this was not the case…</p><ul><li> (clang) <a href=\"https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/blob/46db8d822ecdf36a714de5e1acf187736a3af5d1/libcxx/include/__atomic/atomic_sync.h#L56\">used to</a> do exponential backoff with  before . At least it got <a href=\"https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/commit/699f19605579f25083152a9ad21e14c2751d5d66\">fixed</a> in January 2025 but it still does exponential backoff.</li><li>MSVC STL does the <a href=\"https://github.com/microsoft/STL/blob/cbe2ee99caf122555a305d18f69e57c75b3fe5ec/stl/inc/atomic#L449\">right thing</a>™  and goes almost straight to the OS since the first implementation. Good job!</li></ul><p>So if you use it, you may get a built-in exponential backoff, or not. Both implementations actually make sense from an implementer’s point of view (<em>Do you expect  users to use it with their own backoff strategies? Or directly as condition variables?</em>), but this difference ends up being problematic since the code behaves differently between implementations.\nIn the end, as usual with the  library, you’re better off using the OS primitives directly if you want portable behaviour that you control.</p><blockquote><p>As mentioned, Windows’  will do a single spin before doing a syscall. The duration of  is computed on process start by the loader in  and stored in <code>ntdll.dll!RtlpWaitOnAddressSpinCycleCount</code>.</p></blockquote><p>An issue with some lock algorithms is that they may be unfair: this is what happens when under contention a thread may never actually grab the ownership of the lock if other threads are faster.\nThis time I’ll simply give a warning and ask you to trust me as this article is starting to be lengthy. You may have encountered some “ticket” locks that attempt to enhance the fairness of the lock. While it may look good on paper, it’s actually not so good in practice.</p><p>Not only is it slower due to its complexity, but as mentioned before only the OS really knows what’s good for scheduling. And if you want to use a -like API you end up having to wake up all potential waiters instead of just the one you want. So please, rely on the OS primitives for fairness instead. (<em>Even if we didn’t have those primitives, a random+exponential backoff may perform better than a ticket lock anyway!</em>)</p><p>Here comes another tidbit of CPU architecture: even if you write to different variables, they may share the same cacheline!\nAnd this is really bad for performance when you do atomic operations on the same cacheline, even if the addresses are different.\nTo fix this issue, you may enforce alignment of your variables or use padding in a . False sharing is also known as destructive interference, which led to the standard’s <a href=\"https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/thread/hardware_destructive_interference_size.html\"><code>std::hardware_destructive_interference_size</code></a> value!</p><pre tabindex=\"0\" data-language=\"cpp\"><code></code></pre><p>This is however not a silver bullet!\nWhile you will avoid false sharing, you may also fill your TLB and L1 cache faster which may lead to more cache thrashing.</p><p>You may even encounter cache bank conflicts. Cache bank conflicts only exist on some CPUs, but don’t trust manufacturers to avoid them. From 3.6.1.3 of the Intel Optimization Reference Manual:</p><blockquote><ul><li><em>“In the Sandy Bridge microarchitecture, the internal organization of the L1D cache may manifest […]”</em></li><li><em>“The L1D cache bank conflict issue does not apply to Haswell microarchitecture.”</em></li><li><em>“In the Golden Cove microarchitecture, bank conflicts often happen when multiple loads access […]”</em></li></ul><p>💡 So this was once an issue, then fixed, then it came back in another form.</p></blockquote><p>These are thankfully  thanks to the random+exponential backoff, but are getting worse (<em>this pattern of “yes, but” should really annoy you by now, that’s the whole point of this article</em>).</p><blockquote><p>Whenever possible, avoid reading the same memory location within a tight loop or using\nmultiple load operations.</p></blockquote><p>And the only way to really fix that is to… actually park the thread by calling an OS primitive such as a futex! You should also avoid doing multiple loads per loop, as recommended <a href=\"https://www.siliceum.com/en/blog/post/spinning-around/#the-spin-lock-that-saturated-the-load-ports\">previously</a>.</p><blockquote><p>🤪 “I’ve read about  and .”</p></blockquote><p>And you should probably have read further as those are privileged instructions! But yes they do have the same look as a futex wait/wake, which is very tempting.\nAnd, to be fair, AMD does offer a userland alternative which is  and  that we can use!</p><p>One advantage of  is that you can tell the CPU to wait for a given TSC count instead of having to loop! So it can be used to replace the  loop when supported, and that’s actually what Windows’ locking primitives such as  or  do internally!\nNot only is the “API” easier (<em>you provide a timestamp for the wakeup date</em>) but it can save power! \nJust do not use it for  periods since you are still delaying potential work from other threads by not explicitly yielding to the OS.</p><blockquote><p>💡  can spuriously wake up, but this is fine for our usage since we’ll just spin and try again!</p></blockquote><p>You’ll notice I barely mentioned ARM, that’s because I do not have enough experience with this architecture to give any advice other than you should use the proper memory ordering for decent performance.</p><p>If you read this far, I’ll say it again: in most (and pretty much all) cases you should not even need to worry about the performance of your locks. The best lock is the one you don’t use.</p><blockquote><p>Because you <strong>should never ever think that you’re clever enough</strong> to write your own locking routines.. Because the <strong>likelihood is that you aren’t</strong> (and by that “you” <strong>I very much include myself</strong> - we’ve tweaked all the in-kernel locking over decades, and gone through the simple test-and-set to ticket locks to cacheline-efficient queuing locks, and even people who know what they are doing tend to get it wrong several times).</p><p>There’s a reason why you can find decades of academic papers on locking. </p></blockquote><p>But if you do, even after all those warnings, at least make sure you follow best practices and especially the pre-requisites for a spinlock to be efficient:</p><ul><li>The critical section (work done under the lock) is very small.

I always knew Oban was cool, but I never dug deeper. This article is a collection of my notes and observations on how the Python implementation of Oban works and what I’ve learned while exploring its codebase. I’ll also try to compare it with the Elixir version and talk about concurrency in general.</p><p><a href=\"https://oban.pro/docs/py/index.html\">Oban</a> allows you to <strong>insert and process jobs using only your database</strong>. You can insert the job to send a confirmation email in the same database transaction where you create the user. If one thing fails, everything is rolled back.</p><p>OSS Oban has a few limitations, which are automatically lifted in the Pro version:</p><ul><li><strong>Single-threaded asyncio execution</strong> - concurrent but not truly parallel, so CPU-bound jobs block the event loop.</li><li> - each job is inserted individually.</li><li> - each job completion is persisted individually.</li><li> - jobs that are long-running might get rescued even if the producer is still alive. Pro version uses smarter heartbeats to track producer liveness.</li></ul><p>OSS Oban-py is a great start for your hobby project, or if you’d want to evaluate Oban philosophy itself, but for any bigger scale - I’d go with <a href=\"https://oban.pro/docs/py_pro/index.html\">Oban Pro</a>. The pricing seems very compelling, considering the amount of work put into making the above features work.</p><p>I obviously can’t walk you through the Pro version features, but let’s start with the basics. How Oban Py works under the hood, from the job insertion until the job execution. Stay tuned.</p><h2>Going Deeper - Job Processing Path<a hidden=\"\" aria-hidden=\"true\" href=\"https://www.dimamik.com/posts/oban_py/#going-deeper---job-processing-path\">#</a></h2><p>Let’s get straight to it. You insert your job:</p><div><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code data-lang=\"python\"></code></pre></div><p>After the insertion, the job lands in the  database table with . Oban fires off a PostgreSQL  on the  channel:</p><div><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code data-lang=\"python\"></code></pre></div><p>Every Oban node listening on that channel receives the notification.  on each node gets woken up, but each  only cares about queues it’s actually running. Be aware that each node decides which queues it runs, so if the current node runs this queue, the producer is notified:</p><div><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code data-lang=\"python\"></code></pre></div><p>That  call sets an , breaking  out of its wait loop, so it can dispatch the jobs to the workers:</p><div><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code data-lang=\"python\"></code></pre></div><p>Before fetching the jobs,  persists all pre-existing job completions (acks) to the database to make sure queue limits are respected. Next, it fetches new jobs, transitioning their state to executing at the same time. A slightly more complex version of this SQL is used:</p><div><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code data-lang=\"sql\"></code></pre></div><p>And this is <strong>the first really cool part</strong>.</p><p><strong>Segue to .</strong></p><ul><li><p> - Locks the selected rows so no other transaction can modify them until this transaction completes. This prevents two producers from grabbing the same job.</p></li><li><p> - If a row is already locked by another transaction, skip it instead of waiting. This is crucial for concurrency.</p></li></ul><p>Why this matters for job queues:\nImagine two producer instances (A and B) trying to fetch jobs simultaneously:</p><table><thead><tr></tr></thead><tbody><tr></tr><tr><td>B  for job #1 to unlock</td><td>B  job #1, takes job #2</td></tr><tr><td>Slow, sequential processing</td><td>Fast, parallel processing</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Back in Python, we know that the jobs we just fetched should be processed immediately. When we fetched the job, we already transitioned its state and respected the queue demand.</p><p>Each job gets dispatched as an :</p><div><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code data-lang=\"python\"></code></pre></div><p> ensures that independent of success or failure, we can attach a callback to handle job completion.</p><p> controls how exactly the job is run. For the non-pro Oban version, it just uses  to run the job in the event loop:</p><div><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code data-lang=\"python\"></code></pre></div><p><a href=\"https://oban.pro/releases/py_pro\">For pro version</a>, local asyncio dispatcher is automatically replaced with a pool of processes, so you don’t need to do anything to have true parallelism across multiple cores.</p><p>After the job is dispatched,  takes over. It resolves your worker class from the string name, runs it, and pattern-matches the result:</p><div><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code data-lang=\"python\"></code></pre></div><div><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code data-lang=\"python\"></code></pre></div><p>When execution finishes, the result gets queued for acknowledgement:</p><div><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code data-lang=\"python\"></code></pre></div><p>The completion callback notifies  to wake up again-fetch more jobs, and batch-ack the finished ones in a single query.</p><p>That’s the hot path: <code>Insert → Notify → Fetch (with locking) → Execute → Ack.</code> Five hops from your code to completion. What about the background processes? What about errors and retries? What about periodic jobs, cron, and all these other pieces? Stay tuned.</p><h2>The Undercurrents - Background Processes<a hidden=\"\" aria-hidden=\"true\" href=\"https://www.dimamik.com/posts/oban_py/#the-undercurrents---background-processes\">#</a></h2><p>Oban runs several background loops that keep the system healthy.</p><p>In a cluster, you don’t want every node pruning jobs or rescuing orphans. Oban elects a single leader:</p><div><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code data-lang=\"python\"></code></pre></div><div><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code data-lang=\"sql\"></code></pre></div><div><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code data-lang=\"sql\"></code></pre></div><div><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code data-lang=\"sql\"></code></pre></div><p>The leader refreshes twice as often to hold onto the role:</p><div><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code data-lang=\"python\"></code></pre></div><p>When a node shuts down cleanly, it resigns and notifies the cluster:</p><div><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code data-lang=\"python\"></code></pre></div><p>And that’s ! Leader election is delegated entirely to PostgreSQL. Oban uses  with a TTL-based lease - no Raft, no consensus protocol, no external coordination service.

Backoff includes jitter to prevent <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thundering_herd_problem\">thundering herds</a> - without it, all failed jobs from the same batch would retry at the exact same moment, spiking load all over again.</p><p>The formula: 15 + 2^attempt seconds, with up to 10% added jitter. Attempt 1 waits ~17s. Attempt 5 waits ~47s. Attempt 10 waits ~1039s (~17 minutes).</p><p>The clamping handles jobs with high  - if you set , it scales the attempt number down proportionally so you don’t wait years between retries.</p><p>Workers can override this with custom backoff:</p><div><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code data-lang=\"python\"></code></pre></div><ul><li><strong>PostgreSQL does the heavy lifting.</strong> for concurrent job fetching,  for real-time signaling,  for leader election - the database isn’t just storage, it’s the coordination layer.

Async IO allows multiple jobs to be in-flight, but the event loop is single-threaded. For I/O-bound workloads, this is fine. For CPU-bound tasks, consider using the Pro version with a process pool.</li><li><strong>Leader election is simple and effective.</strong> No consensus protocol, no Raft - just an  with a TTL. The leader refreshes at 2x the normal rate to hold the lease. If it dies, the lease expires and another node takes over.

That brings forms, disclosures, audits, and long waits, plus huge legal bills that can drain a small project. Most builders want to ship features, not juggle filings or burn cash, so they try to avoid that label as much as possible.</p><p>\\\nOver time, the Howey test settled into four elements: money invested, common enterprise, profit expectation, and dependence on promoters or third parties. When crypto arrived, regulators didn’t switch to a new standard. They took their time discovering cryptocurrencies, and when they did, they applied some old rules to this new industry.</p><h2>Why Crypto Keeps Getting Measured with Howey</h2><p>The DAO case sits at the beginning of this story. This decentralized investment fund by Slock.it launched in 2016 on Ethereum. Buyers sent ETH to receive DAO tokens, which let them vote on different projects. Things grew too fast, then everything collapsed when an attacker exploited a flaw in its smart contract and drained a massive amount of ETH. The event panicked the industry and caught the attention of regulators who had never handled anything like it.</p><p>\\\n<strong>In July 2017, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) released its , which said the DAO tokens were securities under the Howey Tes</strong>t. The reasoning focused on fundraising, central coordination by the creators, promotional efforts, and the expectation that token holders would profit from the team’s work. The DAO itself dissolved, but the report stayed, along . It became the template for examining ICOs, token launches, and early presales.</p><p>From 2018, another major case added more nuance. The company Ripple had been distributing its native token XRP in different ways, and the SEC sued them —considering that XRP was an unregistered security. In 2023, a U.S. court that XRP sold directly to institutions counted as a security, while XRP sold to the public on exchanges or distributed in other ways did not, since holders in those settings could not assume Ripple was using their money for development. This result showed that a token’s legal status can shift depending on how it’s sold or promoted. \\n </p><p>Laws aren’t as fast as crypto, but they eventually arrive. By 2025, in addition to the Howey Test, other crypto-related regulations were introduced, including the CLARITY Act in the United States. This is a  that sets out categories for digital assets such as digital commodities, investment-contract assets (securities), and mature blockchain systems. It aims to reduce uncertainty by making it clearer which regulator oversees which type of token.</p><p>\\\n<strong>CLARITY could free many tokens from automatic securities analysis, yet the Howey Test will remain part of the legal landscape.</strong> Tokens structured around profit promises, centralized control, or fundraising models that resemble traditional investments would still meet the Howey criteria. Builders need to keep this in mind when shaping token design, marketing language, airdrops, and staking features.</p><p>\\\nIt’s also important to consider that the same crypto network may host varied assets such as utility tokens, governance tokens, yield-bearing products, and fully regulated securities. In , the native token GBYTE couldn’t be considered a security under the Howey Test (it wasn’t even sold, ). However, anyone can create their own  with any purpose and features, and they may or may not be considered securities.</p><p>For its part, CLARITY may narrow the number of cases that rely on Howey, but it doesn’t send the test into retirement. When we understand both rules, the whole landscape feels easier to navigate, quirks and all.</p><p><em>Featured Vector Image by vector4stock / </em></p>","contentLength":5085,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"FreeType Speeds-Up ClearType-Like LCD Filter Rendering By 40%","url":"https://www.phoronix.com/news/FreeType-Faster-ClearType-Like","date":1769617428,"author":"Michael Larabel","guid":425433,"unread":true,"content":"<article>The widely-used FreeType library used for rendering text onto bitmaps has landed a significant optimization for its LCD filtering code path for Microsoft ClearType-like rendering.

From a report: The evidence includes a 500,000-year-old hammer made of elephant or mammoth bone, excavated in southern England, and 430,000-year-old wooden tools found in southern Greece -- the earliest wooden tools on record. \n\nThe findings suggest that early humans possessed sophisticated technological skills, the researchers said. Katerina Harvati, a paleoanthropologist at the University of Tubingen in Germany and a lead author of the wooden-tool paper, which was published on Monday in the journal PNAS, said the discoveries provided insight into the prehistoric origins of human intelligence. Silvia Bello, a paleoanthropologist at London's Natural History Museum and an author on the elephant-bone study, which was published last week in Science Advances, concurred. \n\nThe artifacts in both studies, recovered from coal-mine sites, were probably produced by early Neanderthals or a preceding species, Homo heidelbergensis. Homo sapiens emerged in Africa more than 300,000 years ago, and the oldest evidence of them in Europe is a 210,000-year-old fossil unearthed in Greece.

While looking for related exploit attempts in our data, I came across the following request:</p><blockquote><p><code>GET /weblogic//weblogic/..;/bea_wls_internal/ProxyServlet\nhost: 71.126.165.182<p>\nuser-agent: Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; Exploit/1.0)</p>\naccept-encoding: gzip, deflate\nconnection: close<p>\nwl-proxy-client-ip: 127.0.0.1;Y21kOndob2FtaQ==</p>\nproxy-client-ip: 127.0.0.1;Y21kOndob2FtaQ==<p>\nx-forwarded-for: 127.0.0.1;Y21kOndob2FtaQ==</p></code></p></blockquote><p>According to write-ups about CVE-2026-21962, this request is related [2]. However, the vulnerability also matched an earlier&nbsp;\"AI Slop\" PoC [3][4]. Another write-up, that also sounds very AI-influenced, suggests a very different exploit mechanism that does not match the request above [5].</p><p>The source IP is&nbsp;193.24.123.42. Our data shows sporadic HTTP scans for this IP address, and it appears to be located in Russia. Not terribly remarkable at that. In the past, the IP has used the \"Claudbot\" user-agent. But it does not have any actual affiliation with Anthropic (not to be confused with the recent news about clawdbot).&nbsp;</p><p>The exploit is a bit odd. First of all, it does use the loopback address as an \"X-Forwarded-For\" address. This is a common trick to bypass access restrictions (I would think that Oracle is a bit better than to fall for a simple issue like that). There is an option to list multiple IPs, but they should be delimited by a comma, not a semicolon.&nbsp;</p><p>The base64 encoded string decodes to: \"cmd:whoami\". This suggests a simple command injection vulnerability. Possibly, the content of the header is base64 decoded and next, passed as a command line argument?? Certainly an odd mix of encodings in one header, and unlikely to work.</p><p>Let's hope this is AI slop and the exploit isn't that easy. We have seen a significant uptick in requests, including the wl-proxy-client-ip header, starting on January 21st, but the header has been used <a href=\"https://isc.sans.edu/weblogs/headers.html?header=d2wtcHJveHktY2xpZW50LWlw\">before</a>. It is a typical exploit AI may come up with, seeing keywords like \"Weblogic Server Proxy Plug-in\".<p>\nI asked ChatGPT and Grok if this is an exploit or AI slop. The abbreviated answer:</p>This looks&nbsp;<strong data-end=\"123\" data-start=\"11\">more like a “scanner/probe that’s trying to look like an exploit” than a complete, working exploit by itself</strong>&nbsp;— but it’s&nbsp;&nbsp;random either. It’s borrowing real WebLogic attack ingredients.\"This is an actual exploit attempt&nbsp;— not just random \"AI slop\" or nonsense traffic.\"That is definitely an&nbsp;, not AI slop.

We just might have a tip or two to help out.</p><h2><strong>Treat Your Blog Like the Product It Is</strong></h2><p><strong>If you’re going to stand out from the crowd, you need to treat your blog like a product.</strong></p><p>Adopting product management principles can be the difference between disappearing under the radar and growing an enduring community around your work.</p><p><strong>Here’s a 5-step process you can integrate into your workflow:</strong></p><h3><strong>Step 1: Define Your Vision</strong></h3><p>This starts with understanding WHY you write, which is important because it defines what success looks like to you. You also want to clearly define the problems your writing solves, for whom, and the unique value you offer. This will serve as your north star for future content-related decisions.</p><h3><strong>Step 2: Iterate your Way to a Proto-Persona</strong></h3><p>Start by creating 3-5 ideal reader personas. Give them a story, identify their needs, and all the ways your content might satisfy them. Next, go from your 3–5 ideals to one that best represents the majority of your target audience. Then use your imagination (and research) to flesh out the following details: demographics, pain points, behavior, and practical needs.</p><h3><strong>Step 3: Map the Reader Journey</strong></h3><p>Once you’ve crafted a proto-persona, you then want to consider how this person might find your work and engage with it. Do they come to you via Google search results? Social media? Newsletters? Word of mouth? All of the above? Figuring this out will inform your content distribution strategy and, in some cases, even the tone of your work. It’ll help you understand where to focus your content marketing efforts so that you’re not going around beating dead horses.</p><h3><strong>Step 4: Take some time to strategize</strong></h3><p>It’s commendable to want to hit the ground running and transfer all your great, ideas from your mind to the page. But if you’re interested in growing a brand that stands the test of time, you want to do so intentionally. And nothing says intentional like a well-thought-out plan. So before you start writing, create a calendar that outlines all the subjects you’d like to address over a period of time. If you’re just starting out, try drawing up an 8-week calendar (break it up into smaller chunks if you need to).</p><p>\\n <strong>Don’t worry, I won’t tell:</strong></p><ul><li>Group all your ideas into themes or categories for the sake of cohesion.</li><li>Set dates and specific times for each piece to go live. It'll be held with tracking deadlines and integrating  into your calendar.</li><li>Break up your workflow into smaller tasks for each piece-brainstorming, research, drafting, polishing–and track the status of each as consistently as your schedule allows.</li><li>Distribution plan. Identify where your content will be distributed or redistributed.</li></ul><h3><strong>Step 5: Optimize the Engine (SEO and Identity)</strong></h3><p>Think of this as the crossing i’s and dotting t’s step. After you’ve spent time on strategy to satisfy your proto-persona, you want to tighten the bolts to make sure the actual content, once published, can be discovered, resurfaced, and, most importantly, . In light of this, you can think of optimization as a mix of  and . These twin forces keep your work  for you long after you hit publish.</p><ul><li><strong>Build a Digital Home Base:</strong> A simple personal site (even just a one-page bio + links) becomes your identity hub. Every guest post, social share, or backlink should point back here. Over time, this site becomes your evergreen résumé and credibility anchor.</li><li> From Google Knowledge Panel to LinkedIn to niche forums, secure your name and professional handles. This keeps impostors out and ensures that when someone searches for you, they find .</li><li><strong>Leverage Long-Tail Keywords:</strong> Short keywords are crowded. Long-tail queries (“best fintech apps for freelancers 2025” vs. just “fintech”) attract readers with intent. Practice weaving these phrases in naturally so your content ranks while still sounding human.</li><li><strong>Keep Updating, Keep Ranking:</strong> Publishing is not the finish line. Use tools like Ahrefs or Google Search Console to see what queries you’re already appearing for. If your article is floating on page 2 for a related keyword, add a section or heading to capture it. Small tweaks like this compound.</li></ul><p>\\\n<strong>Finally, there’s the AI-shaped elephant in the room to consider. It’s changing everything, and to be a successful blogger in 2025, you must write in such a way that AI bots know to crawl all over your articles.</strong></p><p>Taking in all of this at once might seem a bit overwhelming. <strong>The good news is that you don’t have to.</strong></p><p>\\\n, with its self-paced structure, on-demand video lessons, practical tools and templates (yours to keep), exercises, and a community to learn with, allows you to digest all the resources you need to grow your reach and authority as a writer.

Bell describes herself as a late stage Gen Xer. The Clock, she told me in a call last week, has always been a part of her life. “One of every four movies on TV was a nuclear one,” she said. The clear and iconic lines of the Clock have been present in pop culture for decades, most noticeably as a thematic image in Alan Moore’s  comic book. According to Bell, the symbol is important. “It’s clear that people respond to it. If you simply had a set of scientists deliver a statement about the state of existential risks…would it have the same global reach that the Clock does?”</p><p>Nuclear expert Joseph Cirincione also doesn’t recall a time when the Doomsday Clock wasn’t ticking away in the background of his life and work. “It’s part of the fabric of the nuclear age,” he said. Cirincione worked on military reform as a Congressional staffer for nine years before starting a long career in the nuclear world. He’s the former director of non-proliferation at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace and the retired president of the Ploughshares fund.</p><p>Cirincione wasn't exactly skeptical of the Clock when I spoke to him the day before the announcement. “The Doomsday Clock is probably the most cited measure of nuclear risk in the world today,” he said. But he did share some of my concerns. “Being so close to midnight, you’re afraid the metric loses its power,” he said.“What does it mean to go from 89 seconds to 75 seconds?”</p><p>“Here's the dilemma: I believe we are seconds away from nuclear catastrophe,” he said. “This is true. This is an accurate reflection of the risk. You can make a long list of what the risks are, but at the top of the list is that a crazy man has the sole unfettered ability to launch a nuclear war, and no one can stop him, and that is our president. That is true. He could do that this afternoon. The President of the United States is increasingly demonstrably mentally unstable, and yet, if he wanted to launch a nuclear weapon, no one could stop him.”</p><p>During an <a href=\"https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/donald-trump-addresses-health-hand-bruise-stroke-mri-greenland.html?ref=404media.co\"><u>interview with </u></a>published on January 26, 2025—the day before the Clock ticked forward—Trump appeared to forget the word “Alzheimer’s” when describing the health issue that felled his father. “Well, I don’t have it,” Trump said after his press secretary filled in the word for him. “I don’t think about it at all. You know why? Because whatever it is, my attitude is whatever.”</p><p>These are not inspiring words from a man with the ability to end all life on Earth.</p><p>Cirincione wants the Bulletin to stress Trump’s diminished mental capacity during its announcement, but he’s not hopeful they will. “What holds them back is that the natural desire of experts to be non-partisan and to not explicitly criticize a leader of a country, a leader of a political party, they don't want to be dragged into that,” he said. “Discussing the mental stability of that person that is way too sensitive for a group like the Bulletin to take on. So they will shirk from that.”</p><p>During speeches and a question and answer session after the announcement, the experts at the Bulletin mentioned Trump many times.&nbsp; It’s clear they see him as a liar and a threat to world peace. “We’ve seen President Trump using [AI videos] to try to persuade people that things have happened that have not happened,” Steven Fetter, a member of the Bulletin’s Science and Security Board, said. But as Cirincione predicted, they didn’t touch on his mental state.</p><p>They did, however, hit on another topic Cirincione worried they would avoid. “The biggest change in nuclear risks over the last 10 years is that seven of the nine nuclear armed states are now led by authoritarian leaders,” he said.</p><p>The rising tide of authoritarianism and nationalism were central talking points of the Bulletin’s announcement this year. Nobel Peace Prize Laureate Maria Ressa gave the keynote address of the announcement. Ressa, a journalist from the Philippines, is well aware of the world’s current horrors. Ressa reported on the presidency of Rodrigo Duterte who was a kind of proto-Trump. She said that democracy, diplomacy, and science don’t work without a shared sense of reality, what she calls the world’s operating system.</p><p>“The operating system has been corrupted, deliberately, systematically, for profit,” she said during her address. “The platforms that mediate our information were built on an extractive and predatory model. They turned our attention into a commodity and our outrage into their business model…this brings out the worst of humanity. They don't connect us, they divide us, and in that division, they've enabled the collapse of cooperation and the rise of illiberal leaders who exploit chaos. As of last year, <a href=\"https://www.gu.se/en/news/the-world-is-becoming-increasingly-authoritarian-but-there-is-hope?ref=404media.co\"></a> is now under authoritarian rule.”</p><p>In her address, Ressa was critical of big tech. “The old order is not coming back,” Ressa said. “We’re witnessing something more dangerous: the fusion of state power with the tech oligarchy. The men who control the platforms that shape what billions believe have merged with the men who control governments and militaries. Might makes right is the new operating principle and they have the tools to manufacture consent or to simply drown out dissent.”</p><p>In a world where the tech company Palantir works hand in glove with ICE to figure out<a href=\"https://www.404media.co/elite-the-palantir-app-ice-uses-to-find-neighborhoods-to-raid/\"></a> to raid and Flock’s facial recognition technology is <a href=\"https://www.404media.co/tag/flock/\"></a> by police across America, Ressa’s words hit the mark more closely than the threat of nuclear weapons. And maybe that’s what I’m feeling too: the sense that nuclear weapons, like the Clock, are a nostalgic fear in the face of Big Tech overreach and the rise of authoritarianism.</p><p>And yet. The United States is set to spend trillions of dollars on new and different kinds of <a href=\"https://www.twz.com/nuclear/troubled-sentinel-icbm-program-still-being-restructured-nearly-two-years-after-cost-breach?ref=404media.co\"></a> In less than two weeks, the <a href=\"https://www.armscontrol.org/act/2025-10/news/russia-proposes-one-year-new-start-extension?ref=404media.co\"></a> that limits the amount of deployed nuclear weapons in America and Russia will expire. Trump has threatened to test nuclear weapons again. China is building more nukes. Multiple countries, including South Korea, have expressed interest in acquiring their own nukes.</p><p>The risk of nuclear annihilation can feel abstract and overwhelming. The world has built a series of complicated and interconnected systems that allow a handful of people to destroy everything. When facing the totality of these weapons I feel like the protagonist of a Lovecraft story. I am struck dumb by horrors beyond my comprehension.</p><p>Best, then, to keep the metaphors simple. “Other people have tried,” Cirincione said. “None of them have come close to the traction of the Clock. So, the best argument for keeping the Clock is that it works and it has a proven track record, and you'd be foolish to give up that symbol now.”</p><p>Bell said that more people are paying attention to the Clock than ever before. She tells me that traffic is up at the Bulletin’s website and more people are reading about nuclear weapons, climate change, and the existential risks of technology like AI. The Clock, Bell said, is still connecting with people. “It’s not just a warning, it’s a call to action,” she said. “The fact that it’s not midnight yet means we have time to fix these problems.”</p><p>I ask her how close the Clock has to tick down to midnight before the metaphor breaks down.&nbsp;</p><p>“I hope we never have to find out,” she said. “Every metaphorical second counts.”</p><p>So the Clock ticks on. Four seconds closer now.</p><p>“How long can we go? We go until midnight,” Bell said.</p>","contentLength":8554,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"https://www.404media.co/content/images/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-28-104914.png","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Amazon cuts 16k jobs","url":"https://www.reuters.com/legal/litigation/amazon-cuts-16000-jobs-globally-broader-restructuring-2026-01-28/","date":1769614751,"author":"DGAP","guid":425425,"unread":true,"content":"","contentLength":0,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46796745"},{"title":"TechCrunch Disrupt 2026: Plus-one passes are almost gone and only 3 days remain","url":"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/28/techcrunch-disrupt-2026-plus-one-passes-are-almost-gone-and-only-3-days-remain/","date":1769614200,"author":"TechCrunch Events","guid":425416,"unread":true,"content":"<article>The TechCrunch Disrupt 2026 plus-one passes at&nbsp;50% off are almost sold out, and this deal ends in 3 days.

The subreddit’s description explicitly states that the sub is “about making porn or making fun of authoritarians. REAL FASCISTS, SEXISTS, HOMOPHOBES, TRANSPHOBES AND OTHER BIGOTS ARE NOT WELCOME HERE!,” and “Rule 1: No Fascists”.&nbsp;</p><p>On Monday morning, moderator LilyDHM <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/FuckingFascists/comments/1qnmlte/on_ice_content_in_this_subreddit/?ref=404media.co\"></a> of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) content in the sub. “No ICE related content will be allowed in kink posts,” the post reads. “We believe that this is the best option to allow people to still post MAGA content without touching this particular aspect of it, as it directly involves current politics and multiple lost lives.”</p><p>The ban comes after several weeks of heightened debate over ICE-related fantasizing on the sub. The discussion apparently came to a head on Sunday when r/FuckingFascists moderator PigSlut182 made a public <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/FuckingFascists/comments/1qmuy5n/at_what_point_are_we_complicit?ref=404media.co\">post in</a> the community, asking “<a href=\"https://archive.ph/yd6u4?ref=404media.co\"><u>At what point are we complicit</u></a>?” and suggesting that the sub be completely shut down.&nbsp;</p><p>r/FuckingFascists is not the only porn subreddit that has stepped up its political engagement. <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/news/867967/ice-shooting-minneapolis-reddit-communities-activism?ref=404media.co\"></a>, dick-pic-sharing sub r/MassiveCock came out hard against ICE over the weekend. The sub featured posts like “How hard I get when I think about abolishing ICE” and “ICE can fucking suck it”, accompanied by pictures of huge dicks.

User _Sanctityy <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/FuckingFascists/comments/1qmuy5n/comment/o1p3q9j/?context=3&amp;ref=404media.co\"><u>said that they believed there were real fascists using the sub</u></a>. “They're hiding in the faceless up votes of maga posts, the baseless pushes for less safety and critical thinking, and the insecure downvoting and attacking of anti-fascist posts like the pussies they are,” they said. “The posts don't feel the same unless I purposefully shut off the part of my brain that wants to check in with neighbors and prepare my friends…Anything with any mention of trump feels disgusting especially if it's about his recent actions or another term.”</p><p>The community took a no-kink “aftercare” <a href=\"https://archive.ph/wnYBQ?ref=404media.co\"><u>period of consultation and reflection</u></a>, in response to the January 7 death of Renee Good, who was shot by ICE agent Jonathan Ross while in her car. That pause seems to have been an era of introspection which resulted, 10 days ago, <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/FuckingFascists/comments/1qeplar/end_of_aftercare_subreddit_updates/?ref=404media.co\"><u>in an announcement of stricter moderation</u></a> going forward, and a rule that users should “stick to general themes, rather than explicit current events when creating content.” At that point, fantasy and discussing the sexual thrill of potential immigration enforcement was still ok, according to the announcement: “Talking about deportation or fear of ICE is acceptable. Talking about anything related to any of the people who have been murdered by ICE, is not.” To deal with that change in restrictions, the sub would be taking applications for more moderators.&nbsp;</p><p>A look through older posts in the sub shows users exploring the sexual dynamics of fascism with posts about wanting to be “<a href=\"https://archive.ph/cdM0b?ref=404media.co\"></a> in the back of a van,” or abusing the power of an immigration agent while “<a href=\"https://archive.ph/arb29?ref=404media.co\"></a> with the families.” Many posts are called things like “<a href=\"https://archive.ph/wip/0ZH0I?ref=404media.co\"></a> and women will finally conquer me.” The users and mods of r/FuckingFascists clearly face what might be an impossible challenge: differentiating between people engaging in fantasy and roleplay, and actual Nazis enjoying the freedom to post sexualized fascist content. </p>","contentLength":4515,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"https://www.404media.co/content/images/2026/01/virginia-johnson-yycCyEWFhtI-unsplash.jpg","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"How to Style the New ::search-text and Other Highlight-y Pseudo-Elements","url":"https://css-tricks.com/how-to-style-the-new-search-text-and-other-highlight-pseudo-elements/","date":1769612884,"author":"Daniel Schwarz","guid":425367,"unread":true,"content":"<p><a href=\"https://developer.chrome.com/blog/new-in-chrome-144\" rel=\"noopener\">Chrome 144</a> recently shipped , which is now one of several highlight-related pseudo-elements.

Up until now, I didn’t even know that there was a name for them, but I’m glad there is because that makes it easier to round them all up and compare them, which is exactly what I’m going to do here today, as it’s not super obvious what they do based on the name of the pseudo-element. I’ll also explain why we’re able to customize them, and suggest how.</p><h3>The different types of highlight pseudo-elements</h3><figure><table><thead><tr></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td> selects the current target</td></tr><tr><td>Text fragments allow for programmatic highlighting using URL parameters. If you’re referred to a website by a search engine, it might use text fragments, which is why  is easily confused with .</td></tr><tr><td>Incorrectly spelled words</td><td>Pretty much applies to editable content only</td></tr><tr><td>Pretty much applies to editable content only</td></tr></tbody></table></figure><p>And let’s not forget about the <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/mark\" rel=\"noopener\"></a> HTML element either, which is what I’m using in the demos below.</p><h3>What should highlight pseudo-elements look like?</h3><p>The question is, if they all (besides ) have default styling, why would we need to select them with pseudo-elements? The reason is accessibility (color contrast, specifically) and usability (emphasis). For example, if the default yellow background of  doesn’t contrast well enough with the text color, or if it doesn’t stand out against the background of the container, then you’ll want to change that.</p><p>I’m sure there are many ways to solve this (I want to hear  in the comments), but the best solution that I’ve come up with uses <a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/css-color-functions/#aa-the-relative-color-syntax\">relative color syntax</a>. I took wrong turns with both  and <code>backdrop-filter: invert(1)</code> before realizing that many CSS properties are off-limits when it comes to highlight pseudo-elements:</p><pre rel=\"CSS\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\">body {\n  --background: #38003c;\n  background: var(--background);\n\n  mark,\n  ::selection,\n  ::target-text,\n  ::search-text {\n    /* Match color to background */\n    color: var(--background);\n\n    /* Convert to RGB then subtract channel value from channel maximum (255) */\n    background: rgb(from var(--background) calc(255 - r) calc(255 - g) calc(255 - b));\n  }\n}</code></pre><p>Your browser might not support that yet, so here’s a video that shows how the highlighted text adapts to background color changes.</p><p>What’s happening here is that I’m converting the container’s background color to RGB format and then subtracting the value of each channel (, , and ) from the maximum channel value of , inverting each channel and the overall color. This color is then set as the background color of the highlighting, ensuring that it stands out no matter what, and thanks to the new <a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/playing-with-codepen-slidevars/\">CodePen slideVars</a>, you can mess around with the demo to see this in action. You might be able to do this with color formats besides RGB, but RGB is the easiest.</p><p>So that covers the usability, but what about the accessibility?</p><p>Well, the highlighting’s text color is the same as the container’s background color because we know that it’s the inverse of the  background color. While this doesn’t mean that the two colors will have accessible contrast, it seems as though they will most of the time (you should always check color contrast using <a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/color-contrast-accessibility-tools/\">color contrast tools</a>, regardless).</p><p>If you don’t like the randomness of inverting colors, that’s understandable. You can totally pick colors and write conditional CSS for them manually instead, but finding accessible colors that stand out against the different backdrops of your design for all of the different types of highlight pseudo-elements, while accounting for alternative viewing modes such as dark mode, is a headache. Besides, I think certain UI elements (e.g., highlights, errors, focus indicators)  be ugly. They  stand out in a brutalist sort of way and feel disconnected from the design’s color palette. They should demand maximum attention by intentionally not fitting in.</p><p>Keep in mind that the different types of highlight pseudo-elements should be visually distinctive too, for obvious reasons, but also in case two different types overlap each other (e.g., the user selects text currently matched by find-in-page). Therefore, in the amended code snippet below, , , , and  all have slightly different backgrounds.</p><p>I’ve left  unchanged, the  value of  as it was, the  value of  as it was, and the  value of  as it was, so those last three only have two channels inverted instead of all three. They’re varied in color now (but still look inverted), and with the addition of an alpha value at  ( for ), they also blend into each other so that we can see where each highlight begins and ends:</p><pre rel=\"CSS\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\">body {\n  --background: #38003c;\n  background: var(--background);\n\n  mark,\n  ::selection,\n  ::target-text,\n  ::search-text {\n    color: var(--background);\n  }\n\n  mark {\n    /* Invert all channels */\n    background: rgb(from var(--background) calc(255 - r) calc(255 - g) calc(255 - b) / 70%);\n  }\n\n  ::selection {\n    /* Invert all channels but R */\n    background: rgb(from var(--background) r calc(255 - g) calc(255 - b) / 70%);\n  }\n\n  ::target-text {\n    /* Invert all channels but G */\n    background: rgb(from var(--background) calc(255 - r) g calc(255 - b) / 70%);\n  }\n\n  ::search-text {\n    /* Invert all channels but B */\n    background: rgb(from var(--background) calc(255 - r) calc(255 - g) b / 70%);\n    \n    &amp;:current {\n      /* Invert all channels but B, but without transparency */\n      background: rgb(from var(--background) calc(255 - r) calc(255 - g) b / 100%);\n    }\n  }\n}</code></pre><p> and  are excluded from all this because they have their own visual affordances (red underlines and green underlines respectively, typically contrasted against the neutral background of an editable element such as ).</p><p>But , , , and new-to-Chrome ? Well, they can appear anywhere (even on top of each other), so I think it’s important that they’re visually distinctive from each other while being accessible at all times. Again though, even fully-inverted colors can be inaccessible. In fact, the inverse of  is , so test, test, test!

However, you can follow along with the code this article is based on via the various repository links provided in the  section below (in particular, the README in the ttn-workflows repository is very thorough for some reason — I must have been in the mood for documentation).</p><p>Be sure to check out the other links as well —for your convenience, they are all listed in the  section at the end of this&nbsp;article.</p><p>The organization <a href=\"https://github.com/org-mushroom-kingdom/\">org-mushroom-kingdom</a> has recently begun work on a news application “Toad Town News.” The work for this application has broken up into three repositories:</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://github.com/org-mushroom-kingdom/ttn-frontend\">ttn-frontend</a>, which handles the frontend of the application.</li><li><a href=\"https://github.com/org-mushroom-kingdom/ttn-backend\">ttn-backend</a>, which handles the backend of the application.</li><li><a href=\"https://github.com/org-mushroom-kingdom/ttn-workflows\">ttn-workflows</a>, a repository dedicated to reusable workflows and items related to them such as&nbsp;scripts.</li></ul><p>The senior devs of this application have decided that any major frontend or backend release must have a pull request that includes a changelog file (hereafter referred to as a CHANGELOG file to match how it’s referred to in the above repositories’ code/documentation). This file gives the summary of the major changes associated with that&nbsp;release.</p><p>This CHANGELOG file has strict conventions surrounding it: there must exactly one CHANGELOG file present per release branch. Furthermore, this file must meet certain naming conventions.</p><p>When a pull request in ttn-frontend or ttn-backend is opened whose source branch is a release branch (a branch that begins with the string \"release\") and whose target branch is main, a caller workflow is activated. This caller workflow calls a reusable workflow (changelog-quality-checks.yml, full path&nbsp;.github/workflows/changelog-quality-checks.yml) in the ttn-workflows repository that when triggered will check if the release branch meets the expected CHANGELOG file criteria.</p><p>Some of changelog-quality-checks.yml’s work is performed by a script (changelog-quality-checks.py, full path scripts/changelog-quality-check.py). This script is also present in the ttn-workflows repository.</p><p> This article won’t break down the CHANGELOG file assessment-related code present in the reusable workflow nor its script as that is not the main focus here— however, this logic  elaborated extensively in <a href=\"https://github.com/org-mushroom-kingdom/ttn-workflows/blob/main/README.md\">the </a><a href=\"https://github.com/org-mushroom-kingdom/ttn-workflows/blob/main/README.md\">ttn-workflows </a><a href=\"https://github.com/org-mushroom-kingdom/ttn-workflows/blob/main/README.md\">README</a>.</p><h3>Checking out ttn-workflows: Why and&nbsp;How</h3><p>If you’ve read my <a href=\"https://medium.com/devops-dev/github-actions-creating-calling-and-testing-a-reusable-workflow-08684d697609\">previous</a><a href=\"https://medium.com/devops-dev/building-and-testing-a-custom-status-check-with-a-github-actions-workflow-a-guide-9f3626682587\">articles</a> about reusable workflows, you will see that things get a little more complex here compared to previous scenarios where all the work could be performed within the reusable workflow file itself. This time, we’re referencing a script within the reusable workflow’s repository and we have explicitly point to it to perform the brunt of our&nbsp;logic.</p><h4>Why the Need to Checkout?</h4><p>When a caller workflow is triggered, it is <a href=\"https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/workflows-and-actions/reusing-workflow-configurations\">run within the context of its own repository</a>. This poses an issue for us— trying to run or even grant permissions to the reusable workflow’s script will give us errors that the script doesn’t&nbsp;exist.</p><p>This may seem obvious because there is no scripts/changelog-quality-check.py path in ttn-frontend or ttn-backend, but it surprised me at first. I had assumed that the reusable workflow could access a script in its own repository with no problem — you might think that since it’s running, it would implicitly switch to the context of its own repo. As I found out, that’s not the case. Our caller workflow fired off first, so we’re running things from the context of its repository. Because of that, we have to checkout the ttn-workflows repo so we can access the&nbsp;script.</p><h4>How to Checkout Another Repository in a&nbsp;Workflow</h4><p>So  do we access this script? We checkout the reusable workflow’s repository, then point to it. It’s easier than you think — if you’ve used Github Actions at all, you’re familiar with the practically ubiquitous action <a href=\"https://github.com/actions/checkout\">actions/checkout</a>.</p><p>It’s commonly the first thing you see in several workflows. In this scenario we use it twice: first in the caller repo, and now again in the reusable workflow, this time with arguments!</p><p>Take a look at the changelog-quality-checks.yml gist&nbsp;below:</p><p>The “<em>Checkout ttn-workflows repo (if non-manually triggered)</em>” step assesses if we’re running the workflow manually (if we were, the checkout would be skipped since we’d already be in the context of the ttn-workflows repo). Since the workflow was triggered via workflow_call, the step will use actions/checkout in conjunction with the following arguments:</p><ul><li>repository: The specific repository to checkout. (: In the actions/checkout used in the caller workflow, we don’t need to specify this because the default activity checks out the caller workflow’s repository. Since we need to check out ttn-workflows, we specify it&nbsp;here.)</li><li>path: The directory in the runner to put the repository contents (: this is relative to GITHUB_WORKSPACE. It should be present at top-level. In this example we checkout the ttn-workflows repository into the ttn-workflows-repo directory).</li><li>token: The token that has the relevant permissions (specifically, the repo permission) necessary to checkout the reusable workflow’s repository. (: This is a generated token — we can’t use the pre-established GITHUB_TOKEN in the caller repo and pass it to the reusable workflow because <a href=\"https://docs.github.com/en/actions/concepts/security/github_token#about-the-github_token\">GITHUB_TOKEN’s permissions are scoped to a single repository</a>.)</li></ul><h3>Accessing the Contents of a Checked Out&nbsp;Repo</h3><p>After we’ve checked out the ttn-workflows repository into the ttn-workflows-repo path, we can then call the changelog-quality-check.py script simply by referencing its path like&nbsp;so:</p><p>The logic above also accounts changelog-quality-checks.yml being triggered manually or not. It isn’t in our case, so we set the REPO_PATH environmental variable to “ttn-workflows-repo”, the value of path used in the previous step. In other words, the full path used in the lower two steps would be ttn-workflows-repo/scripts/changelog-quality-check.py.</p><p>Based upon the results of the script, the changelog-quality-checks.yml workflow returns a status (not pictured) that can then be leveraged by the caller workflow, such as in a <a href=\"https://medium.com/devops-dev/building-and-testing-a-custom-status-check-with-a-github-actions-workflow-a-guide-9f3626682587\">branch protection rule</a>. Standard post-checkout activity occurs, and that’s it. Not bad at&nbsp;all!</p><p>Testing to see if the caller-reusable workflow relationship works as expected is very easy. All we need to do is create a release branch, make a commit on it, and then open a pull request to&nbsp;main.</p><p>The synchronize trigger is key here — I can just make another commit while the pull request is open and run a different test case. For example, let’s say in ttn-frontend I have a release/v1.2 branch, and my first commit is creating a CHANGELOG file named CHANGELOG-frontend-v1.2.txt (the happy path scenario). I open the pull request which will be the very first time the caller workflow is triggered.</p><p>I then go and look at the results. Things look great, but I still want to test scenarios like a bad CHANGELOG name. To do that, I can just rename my CHANGELOG file incorrectly in a new commit, and then push it. The pull request more or less detects that change (this is the synchronize activity). That triggers the caller workflow again; I can rinse and repeat from&nbsp;there.</p><p>As an aside, in previously displayed code snippets there is logic that allows one to test this reusable workflow via manually triggering it in its own repository in addition to calling it from a caller workflow. Basically, the reusable workflow assesses what repository called it and/or if it was manually executed. The evaluation of that determines whether the workflow will execute certain steps. It’s handy to have it set up like this in case you want to specifically test something related to the reusable workflow/script versus the caller-reusable workflow relationship, or if you want to iterate further on the reusable workflow.</p><p>This article has shown how to call upon a reusable workflow in a different repository and explained the how and why of checking out that workflow’s repository to execute desired behavior. Using the methodology explained here, you can see why it’s important to properly contain reusable workflows and their associated items (like scripts) in their own repository. Perhaps more importantly, you have been shown  to link it all together.</p><p>Are you as sick as I am of the word ‘reusable’ after getting to this point? Once you get over that malaise, try setting up something similar for yourself!

Although many failed, some eventually <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wright_Flyer\">succeeded</a> in achieving that goal. These days we take air transportation for granted, but the physics of flight can still be puzzling.</p><p>In this article we’ll investigate what makes airplanes fly by looking at the forces generated by the flow of air around the aircraft’s wings. More specifically, we’ll focus on the cross section of those wings to reveal the shape of an <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airfoil\"></a> – you can see it presented in  below:</p><p>We’ll find out how the shape and the  of the  helps airplanes remain airborne. We’ll also learn about the behavior and properties of air and other flowing matter. In the demonstration below, you can see a fluid flowing around a . Using the slider to change just one  of this substance, we can end up with vastly different effects on the liveliness of that flow:</p><p>Over the course of this blog post we’ll build some intuitions for why these different effects happen to airfoils and other objects placed in flowing air. We’ll start this journey by looking at some of the methods we can use to visualize the motion of the air.</p><p>If you’ve ever been outside in a grassy area on a windy fall day, you may have witnessed something similar to the little scene seen below. The slider lets you control the  to observe in detail how the  and the bending  are visibly affected by the wind sweeping through this area:</p><p>We intuitively understand that it’s the flowing air that pushes the vegetation around, but note that we only observe the effects that the wind has on other objects – we can’t see the motion of the air . I could show you a similarly windy scene without the  and , and I could try to convince you that there is something going on there, but that completely empty demonstration wouldn’t be very gratifying.</p><p>Since the air’s transparency prevents us from tracking its movement directly, we have to come up with some other ways that can help us see its motion. Thankfully, the little outdoor scene already provides us with some ideas.</p><p>Notice that as the wind hits a blade of grass, that blade naturally bends in the direction of the blowing gust, and the faster that gust, the stronger the bending. A&nbsp;single blade indicates the direction and speed of the flow of air in that area.</p><p>In the next demonstration we’re looking at the same grassy field from above. When seen from this perspective, all the  form short lines that are locally aligned with the wind. The more leaned over a blade of grass is, the longer the line it forms. We can mimic this behavior with a collection of  placed all over the area, as seen on the right side:</p><p>Each  represents the direction and the speed of the flow of air at that location – the longer the , the faster the flow. In these windy conditions the flow varies from place to place and it also changes over time, which we can clearly see in the motion of the .</p><p>Note that we have some flexibility in how the speed of wind corresponds to the length of an . I adjusted the lengths of the  to prevent them from visually overlapping, but I also made sure to maintain their  lengths – if one  is twice as long as the other, then the flow at that location is also twice as fast.</p><p>For visual clarity I’m also not packing the  as densely as the  are placed, but it’s important to note that  point in the flow has its own velocity which contributes to the complete velocity <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_field\"></a> present in this area. If we wanted to, we could draw a  at any of the seemingly empty spots on the right side.</p><p>The arrows are convenient, but the grassy scene also has another aid for visualizing flows. Many light objects like , flower petals, dust, or smoke are very easily influenced by the motion of the surrounding air. They quickly change their velocity to match the flow of the wind. We can replicate the behavior of these light objects with  that are pushed around by that flow. You can see them on the right side:</p><p>These little  also show us the motion of the air. Each  represents an object so small and light that it instantly picks up the speed of the surrounding airflow. We’d have a hard time seeing these miniscule specks at their actual sizes, so I’m drawing the  as visible dots.</p><p>In fact, the motion of each  is equivalent to the motion of the parcel of air right around it. If you <a href=\"https://ciechanow.ski/airfoil/#\" onclick=\"grass3_f0();return false;\">slow down time</a>, you’ll be able to see how each  just moves in the direction of the  underneath it. I also made each  leave a little ghost trail behind it – this lets us track the path the air, as represented by the , took on the way to its current position.</p><p>Let’s pause for a second to emphasize what the -like  and -like  represent –&nbsp;they both show the  of the flow of air, but in slightly different ways. An  is attached to its fixed point in space, so it represents the current direction and speed of the flow at . The whole collection of arrows lets us easily see what the entire flow is doing at the moment.</p><p>On the other hand, the little  are actively following the flow, letting us see how the air is actually  through space, with the ghosty trails giving us some historical overview of where this parcel of air has come from.</p><p>The two methods we’ve seen so far are very versatile, but sometimes we don’t care about the local direction of the flow, only its speed – in the middle of this grassy field one might get cold from a fast blowing wind regardless of the direction from which that wind is coming. This brings us the third way of visualizing flow:</p><p>In this method we show the  of the airflow using colors of varying brightness – the faster the wind, the brighter the color. You can see the whole  in the scale below the plot.</p><p>This method shows the speed of the flow at  locations giving us a more fine-grained insight into the motion of air at the cost of the directional information. To help with that I’ll sometimes overlay the regular arrows on top to let us know where the flow is going as well.</p><p>You may have noticed that all these methods present a flat, two dimensional view of the flow. It’s based on the assumption that the wind in our little scene doesn’t change with elevation, and that it also doesn’t blow towards or away from the ground.</p><p>In reality, the air velocity could vary in all three dimensions, and that air could also flow upwards or downwards. Thankfully, the air flows we’ll consider in this article will be two dimensional and the simple flat drawings will suffice.</p><p>Before we finish this section, let me bring up visualization of a simple airflow, but this time I’ll give you some control over its , which you can change using the second slider. The first one once more controls the :</p><p>Don’t be misled by the frozen arrows, the wind is actually blowing there. Remember that the arrows represent the local velocity of the flow of air, so while the velocity doesn’t change, the  of each packet of air does. You can see those changes by tracking the  moving around with the flow. This demonstration represents a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid_dynamics#Steady_vs_unsteady_flow\"></a>, which means that its properties don’t change over time.</p><p>So far we’ve been exploring the notion of airflow’s velocity on a more intuitive level, with a general understanding that’s it’s “the air” moving around in some direction and at some speed. I illustrated that concept using simple , , and , but we’re now ready to investigate the details hiding behind those straightforward graphical representations.</p><p>To do that, we have to look at individual particles of air. Although I <a href=\"https://ciechanow.ski/sound/#air\">briefly discussed</a> the particle nature of air before, this time around we’re going to take a closer look at the motion of these molecules, and what it means for airflow as a whole.</p><p>Let’s take a look at the air particles in a small, marked out volume of space seen in the demonstration below – you can drag the cube around to change the viewing angle. The slider controls the :</p><p>You’re witnessing the motion of over twelve thousand air particles. It may seem like a lot, but this cube is , its sides are only 80 nanometers long. To put this in perspective using more familiar sizes, if that cube’s side measured just , it would contain around  particles.</p><p>The particles are zipping around in random directions, constantly entering and leaving this region. However, despite all this motion what you’re seeing here is a simulation of  air.</p><p>To understand how all this movement ends up creating still conditions, we first have to look at the velocity of each particle – I’ll visualize it with a small arrow in the direction of motion. To make things a easier to see, I’ll also  a few of the particles while fading out the rest of them:</p><p>The length of an arrow is proportional to the speed of a particle, so when you <a href=\"https://ciechanow.ski/airfoil/#\" onclick=\"particles2_f0();return false;\">freeze the time</a> you should be able to see how some particles are slower and some are faster. This speed variation follows a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxwell%E2%80%93Boltzmann_distribution\">certain distribution</a> that’s related to temperature – the warmer the air, the faster the motion of its particles.</p><p>At room temperature the average speed of a particle in air is an astonishing , which is many times higher than even <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saffir%E2%80%93Simpson_scale#Category_5\">the most severe hurricanes</a>. Given the size of the cube, this means that even at the <a href=\"https://ciechanow.ski/airfoil/#\" onclick=\"particles2_f1();return false;\">fastest speed of simulation</a> everything happens 11  times slower than in real life.</p><p>If you paid close attention, you may have also noticed that sometimes the particles randomly change direction and speed of their motion – this happens when molecules collide. Each particle experiences roughly ten billion collisions per second. We’ll get back to these interactions later on, but for now let’s try to figure out how all this turmoil creates still air.</p><p>Having just seen the small velocity arrows of individual particles, let’s calculate the  velocity of a group of three , using the process shown below. We first take the velocity arrows  and place them head to toe, one after another. Then we connect the start of the  with the end of the  to create the  of all velocities. Finally, we divide, or scale down, the length of this  by the number of particles to get the :</p><p>In the next demonstration we’re repeating this whole procedure by tallying up all the particles inside the . You can change the  of that region with the second slider. The  in the middle shows the average velocity of particles in the box. To make that  visible, I’m making it much larger than the tiny arrows tied to particles:</p><p>The counter in the bottom part of the demonstration tracks the current number of particles in the . That value fluctuates as the molecules enter and leave that region. While aggregating over a small number of particles creates a very <a href=\"https://ciechanow.ski/airfoil/#\" onclick=\"particles3_f0();return false;\">noisy readout</a>, it doesn’t take  many particles to get a much <a href=\"https://ciechanow.ski/airfoil/#\" onclick=\"particles3_f1();return false;\">steadier measure</a>.</p><p>Recall that the scale of the  is much larger than the scale of individual tiny arrows attached to each particle. Despite that increase in size, the  practically disappears when we average out a larger number of particles and we can clearly see that the average velocity of particles is more or less zero even in this extremely small volume.</p><p>In still conditions, all these motions in different directions average out to nothing. As some particles enter the area from a random direction, the others also leave it in a random way. The  of air doesn’t really go anywhere and the particles just meander in a random fashion.</p><p>An imperfect, but convenient analogy is to imagine a swarm of bees flying in the air. While all the individual insects are actively roaming around at different speeds, the group as a whole may steadily stay in one place.</p><p>All these experiments form the key to understanding what happens when wind sweeps through an area. In the demonstration below, we’re once again watching a small volume of space, but this time you can control the  of the blowing wind:</p><p>Notice the  speedometer in the bottom of the demonstration. This is not a mistake –&nbsp;even with <a href=\"https://ciechanow.ski/airfoil/#\" onclick=\"particles4_f0();return false;\">hurricane-level wind speeds</a> it’s very hard to see any difference in the motion of the particles. Perhaps you’ve managed to see the tiniest shifts in the small particle arrows as you drag the  around with <a href=\"https://ciechanow.ski/airfoil/#\" onclick=\"particles4_f1();return false;\">time paused</a>, but it’s difficult to even perceive from which direction the wind is blowing.</p><p>However, when we use the procedure of averaging the velocity of all the particles, we can reveal the motion of their group in the box of a given , at a specific  of the flow:</p><p>Because the motion of each individual particle is so disordered, we have to look at many of them at once to discern any universal characteristics. And when we do <a href=\"https://ciechanow.ski/airfoil/#\" onclick=\"particles5_f0();return false;\">just that</a>, from all the chaos emerges order.</p><p>It’s important to note that with this approach we’re tracking the velocity of the flow within the same region of space outlined by the  – the molecules keep entering and leaving this area as the flow moves and the  in the middle shows the average velocity of the air’s particles in that .</p><p>This is  what the grass-like arrows we’ve played with in the previous section represent – each one shows the average velocity of air particles in that local region of space. The  we just saw in the middle of the swarm in the  is equivalent to each of the  seen below:</p><p>Naturally, the  needs to be large enough to avoid the jitteriness related to aggregation of too few particles, but at any scale that we could care about the noisy readout completely disappears.</p><p>The  motion of particles is very different than the motion of each individual molecule. Even in very fast flows, many of the molecules move in the opposite direction than what the arrow indicates, but if we tally up all the particle motion, the air as a whole does make forward progress in the direction of velocity.</p><p>Up to this point, we’ve mostly looked at the flow of air by looking at wind and the way it moves through space, but what we consider a motion of air is relative. Let’s see how, by merely changing the point of view, we can create a motion of air in otherwise windless conditions.</p><p>Let’s zoom away from the world of microscopic particles to look at the motion of larger bodies. In the demonstration below, you can see two different views of the same  driving in the left direction. In the top part, the camera stays firmly on the ground, but in the bottom part, the camera tracks the motion of the . If needed, you can restart the scene with the button in the bottom left corner or tweak the  with the slider:</p><p>These two views show the exact same scene – we’re just changing what the camera is focusing on. As seen in the top part, from the perspective of the static camera, it’s only the  that has some velocity in the left direction.</p><p>On the other hand, from the perspective of the camera focused on the , the  doesn’t move, but  does. The poles and road markings all move to the right with a speed equal to that of the . This shouldn’t come as a surprise from daily experience in any form of transportation – when you’re sitting in a moving vehicle, static things in the surrounding environment seem to move towards and past you.</p><p>The very same rules apply to any region of air – I’ve outlined some of them with dashed boxes   up in the sky. For the observer on the ground that air is still, but from the  perspective, that air is moving.</p><p>With that in mind, let’s see the same scene, but this time I’ll add the familiar small arrows showing the air’s velocity as “seen” by the camera:</p><p>From the point of view of the , as seen in the bottom view, the air is moving to the right, as if there was some wind blowing right at the . You’ve probably felt this many times by sticking your hand out the window – it feels no different than if you were standing still on the ground with the wind hitting your fingers.</p><p>In fact, there is absolutely no difference between “regular” wind and wind experienced by the   or your hand sticking out the window – both are simply a motion of air relative to some object. This means that we can use our arrows to represent any motion of air, as long as we note what that motion is relative to.</p><p>You may have also noticed that the moving  affects the motion of air in its vicinity. Let me bring up the previous demonstration one more time:</p><p>In the top view, we can see how the front of the  pushes the air forward, and how the air “bends” and speeds up around the shape of the  to roughly follow its shape, only to end up circling right behind the .</p><p>The same effects are seen in the bottom view – they’re just experienced differently. For example, the air right in front of the  slows down, while the air on top moves even faster than the rest of the undisturbed, distant air.</p><p>We’ll soon explore  the air behaves this way when flowing around an object, but for now let’s raise above the ground to see the motion of an  flying in the sky. We’ll use the familiar setup of a camera kept steady relative the ground, as seen in the top part, and a camera that follows the , seen in the bottom part:</p><p>Before we continue, notice that it’s getting a little hard to pay close attention to what happens to the moving objects in the ground-fixed camera view – the bodies quickly leave the field of view of the demonstrations. For the rest of this article I’ll stick to the camera style seen in the bottom part of the demonstration – this will let us directly track the interaction between the object and the air that flows around that object.</p><p>From the point of view of the , it also experiences a flow of incoming air as seen by the air “boxes” approaching the , which is very similar to the car example. What’s completely different from the car example is the fact that the  somehow stays suspended in the air, despite gravity pulling it down towards the ground. This means that there must be some other force acting on it to prevent the plane from falling from the sky.</p><p>Let’s compare these two vehicles by looking at the basic forces affecting their motion, starting with the diagram of forces acting on the :</p><p>The down-pulling  is counteracted by the  from the ground – they act through the  tires to prevent the  from sinking. The air drag and other forms of resistance  the car back, but the  tires powered by the engine keep  the car forward.</p><p>In my previous article I presented a <a href=\"https://ciechanow.ski/bicycle/#forces\">more elaborate description</a> of the interplay between forces and objects, but to briefly recap here, if forces acting on an object are balanced, then that object will maintain its current velocity.</p><p>All forces on the  balanced and the  moves forward with constant speed, and it doesn’t move at all in the up or down direction – the  velocity is indeed constant.</p><p>Let’s draw a similar diagram of forces for the flying :</p><p>We still have the  that pushes the  back, and the  propeller powered by the engine keeps   it forward. As a result the  moves forward with constant speed.</p><p>We also have the down-pulling . This time, however, that  is not countered by the reaction forces from the ground, but instead it’s balanced by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lift_(force)\"></a>, a  that pushes the  up. When  and  are equalized, the plane doesn’t move up or down either.</p><p>Airplanes create most of their lift with wings, which are carefully designed to generate that force. While length, area, and the overall geometry of the wings are very important, in this article we’ll focus on the shape of the cross-section of a wing which I highlighted below in :</p><p>This is an , the protagonist of this article. This  has a smooth, rounded front and a sharp trailing edge. Let’s take a closer look at the flow of air around this  using the grass-like arrows that show the velocity of air at that location:</p><p>These arrows paint an interesting picture, but in the demonstration below I’ve also added the little leaf-like  that track the motion of air parcels in the flow. I&nbsp;steadily release a whole line of them from the left side, but you can also  anywhere in the flow to drop a  at that location. You can do this in any demonstration that has a little hand symbol in the bottom right corner:</p><p>The  show that the flow splits ahead of the , then it gently changes direction to glide above and below the . Moreover, the  right in front of the  gradually slow down and lag behind their neighbors. The air somehow senses the presence of the body.</p><p>It may be hard to see, but the top and bottom sections of this  aren’t symmetric. This asymmetric design is very important, but right now it will needlessly complicate our discussion on how the flow around this shape arises.</p><p>To simplify things a little, let’s use a less complicated shape of a  – you can see it in the demonstration below. I overlay the previous asymmetric shape with a  outline to show the difference between the two:</p><p>The motion of air around this airfoil is very similar – the flow changes its direction and speed when it passes around an object. Until now we’ve simply been observing that the flow changes to adapt to the shape of the body, but it’s finally time to understand  it happens. To explain that behavior we need to go back to the world of air particles to discuss the concept of pressure.</p><p>As we’ve discussed, even in the seemingly steady conditions the particles of air are zipping around at high speeds colliding with each other at an incredible rate. The surface of any object placed in the air will also experience these bounces.</p><p>In the demonstration below, you can see air particles bombarding a . Every time a collision happens I briefly mark it with a  on the surface of that :</p><p>To understand the implications of these collisions, let’s first take a look at objects with more ordinary sizes. In the demonstration below,  are hitting a large  from the left and right side. By dragging the slider you can change the  of both streams of balls:</p><p>When a  hits the , the collision imparts some force on it, causing the  to move. However, in this simulation the collisions from all the  on each side balance each other out, so the  doesn’t make any consistent progress in either direction.</p><p>In real air, the situation is similar, but at vastly different scales. The mass of each particle constituting air is absolutely miniscule, so the impact of an individual collision on any object of meaningful size is completely imperceptible.</p><p>Moreover, each air particle hitting an object has a different speed, and it strikes the surface of that object at a different angle – some hit the object straight on, but some barely graze it. Due to the enormous number of these collisions happening at every instant of time, all these variations average out, and even a small section of surface of any body experiences uniform bombardment.</p><p>In aggregate, we say that the air exerts <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure\"></a> on any object present in that air. The magnitude of this pressure depends on the intensity of these collisions across an area.</p><p>Let’s see how this pressure manifests on our . In the demonstration below, you can use the second slider to control the  present in this volume:</p><p>The  you see on the sides of the cube symbolize the magnitude of pressure on these walls. As we  increase the  in this volume, the intensity of collisions, and thus the , also increases. Because the collisions happen at more or less the same rate on every side of the , the net balance of forces is also maintained and the  doesn’t move, regardless of how big or small the overall  is.</p><p>This is exactly what happens in the Earth’s atmosphere – everything is constantly squeezed by relatively high pressure caused by the barrage of countless air particles. That pressure is typically balanced either by an object’s material, which resists compression like a spring, or by the air itself that fills the insides of the object. When that inner air is removed, the seemingly innocuous atmospheric pressure <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0N17tEW_WEU&amp;t=165s\">reveals its might</a>.</p><p>The underlying particle nature also shows us that pressure is never negative. Without any particle collisions, we reach the lowest possible pressure of zero. Beyond that, any impacts on the surface of an object create some amount of positive pressure.</p><p>In the demonstrations we’ve seen so far, the  number of collisions on each wall was very important for keeping the objects steady. Unsurprisingly, more interesting things happen when this harmony isn’t maintained. Let’s first investigate this scenario using the . In the demonstration below, the slider controls if it’s the  that’s shooting more balls:</p><p>As you can see, if one of the sides has a <a href=\"https://ciechanow.ski/airfoil/#\" onclick=\"balls2_f0();return false;\">higher number of collisions</a>, the forces acting on the  are no longer balanced and the  starts to move.</p><p>The very same situation happens in air, which you can witness in the simulation below. Notice that the volume in which the  exists has more particles on one side than the other. Observe what happens to  once you let  using the slider:</p><p>The higher number of particle collisions on one side of the  creates higher  on that wall. The uneven forces end up pushing the  to the side. In this demonstration, the pressure re-balances after a while and the  stops moving.</p><p>Intuitively, the air exerts an imbalanced net force on the  only when different parts of that  experience different pressure – it’s the  in pressure that creates an acting net force. When the  in pressure between any two points increases, the net force acting on the object also grows.</p><p>It’s easy to see that a larger number of collisions on the left side of an object would start to exert a net force pushing that object to the right, but, perhaps surprisingly, the same rules apply to any chunk of air itself.</p><p>In the demonstration below, I once again made one half of the test volume contain more particles than the other half. As you  the demonstration, observe the average velocity of molecules in the   section of air:</p><p>The particles on the more occupied side can easily travel to the less crowded side, because there are fewer particles there to collide with and bounce back from. Additionally, each particle in the less populated section is more likely to hit a particle in the more populated section, which will typically cause that particle from the desolate side to bounce back where it came from.</p><p>The particles end up, on average, traveling from the area of high pressure to the area of lower pressure. Even though we don’t have any clean borders between different sections, we can still see the bulk of particles getting accelerated towards the less dense section.</p><p>Once again, the initial pressure differences in the test volume dissipate after a while. On their own, these freely suspended pressure variations quickly disappear, but we will soon see how, with the aid of airflow, these areas of different pressure can be sustained indefinitely.</p><p>In the examples we’ve been playing with, the notion of increased pressure came from an increased number of collisions, which in turn came from an increased number of particles in the area. This shows that, all other things being equal, pressure is tied to the local density of the air, which was very easy to perceive in an increased concentration of molecules.</p><p>However, the pressure can also grow due to increased average speed of the particles, which in turn comes with increased temperature. As particles get faster, each collision gets more impactful and it pushes on an object or other particles a bit harder, causing the overall pressure to also increase. In the demonstration below, we can simulate this with  hitting the  at the same rate, but with , which you can control with the slider:</p><p>As we make the  on one side of the <a href=\"https://ciechanow.ski/airfoil/#\" onclick=\"balls3_f0();return false;\">faster</a>, their impacts also become stronger and the  starts moving to the right, even though the  of collisions per second is equal on both sides.</p><p>The important point from these discussions is that air pressure exerts force on everything inside it, be it a solid object or any parcel of air. It’s a little unintuitive that the air itself both exerts the pressure and it also “feels” the pressure, but it’s all just a consequence of very rapid motions of particles and the collisions between them happening at an enormous rate.</p><p>Recall that even in small volumes of air there are billions of billions of particles, and each particle experiences roughly ten billion collisions per second. What we’ve simulated at a micro scale and in slow motion as countable, individual interactions, very quickly smooths out into a uniform and uninterrupted notion of force-exerting pressure.</p><p>This fact lets us abandon the molecules and their collisions yet again. It’s not a big loss, since counting the number and intensity of collisions was never convenient in the first place, but we can now investigate some other ways of visualizing pressure in a region of air.</p><p>As we’ve seen in the particle simulations, pressure can vary from place to place. One of the most convenient ways to express this variation is to use colors of different intensities. Let’s see how that simple approach could work here. In the demonstration below, the dashed circles represent regions of high  and low  pressure – you can drag them around to change their position:</p><p>This map of pressure is colored with  as indicated by the scale below – the  the color, the  the pressure. The small triangle  in the middle of the scale indicates the location of the  base,  pressure present in the atmosphere.</p><p>In this simulation we have complete control over where the different locations of   and  pressure are. To make things more interesting, each draggable pressure circle has a different strength and range. You can infer this variation from color changes around these points.</p><p>Let’s put an  in this area to see how it’s affected by the pressure of the surrounding air. The  seen below symbolize the force that pressure exerts on the surface of the  at that location. They’re the exact same  that we’ve seen acting on the walls of the tiny yellow cube, here we just see them at a larger scale:</p><p>As you move around the locations of   and  pressure, the  acting on the surface of the  also change, matching what we’ve seen with little cubes bombarded by air particles. The static pressure always exerts some base load, but in the areas of  pressure the  are higher, and in the areas of  pressure the  are lower than these base forces.</p><p>Note that you can also move the pressure circles into the , but it only serves as a convenience to let you customize the shape of the air pressure field  that body – we don’t particularly care about the pressure inside the solid itself.</p><p>When we tally up all the  acting on each piece of the  surface, we end up with the  acting on that object. In the demonstration below, I’m showing it with the  at the center of the :</p><p>By changing the distribution of pressure around the , we can affect the  that this object feels.</p><p>The reddish plots we’ve been looking at are correct, but a little inconvenient. Recall that  on the object depends only on the  of pressure – when we uniformly increased the number of collisions on the walls of the tiny cube, it steadily remained in place.</p><p>This means that the static background pressure doesn’t matter for the  acting on an object. It’s only the differences relative to that static pressure that affect the overall balance. This lets us overhaul our visual representation of pressure – we can use no color where the pressure has the static value, use  when the pressure is  than the static pressure, and use  when the pressure is  than the static pressure:</p><p>This is the  same distribution of pressure that we’ve just seen. All the pressure demos in this section are connected, and here we simply changed the reference point against which we present the pressure variation.</p><p>If we then throw in the  back into the mix we can now also adjust the  representing the  that the pressure exerts on the surface of that :</p><p>The areas of  pressure still seem to push on the surface of the , but the areas of  pressure now seem to  it. However, I need to emphasize once more that pressure  pushes on the object, and we can only talk about a pulling force when we discard that uniform, pushing contribution coming from the static pressure. In those “pulling” areas the pressure is still pushing, it just pushes less intensely.</p><p>I will also use the convenient terms of  and  pressure, but remember that this refers to their difference from the static pressure. The phrase “pressure lower than static pressure” is a mouthful, so the expression “negative pressure” is very handy, even when it hides the fact that pressure is always positive.</p><p>While the color variations used here show the true nature of the smoothly varying pressure changes, they make it a little hard to see how quickly those changes happen. To fix this, I’ll also draw the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contour_line\"></a> that join the locations of the same pressure – they’re very similar to lines of the same altitude you may have seen on maps:</p><p>Every point on one of those contour lines has the same value of pressure, and each subsequent line is drawn at the same increment of pressure – you can see this in the scale placed below the plot. This means that the closer the lines are together, the more quickly the pressure changes in that area.</p><p>The mathematical concept that describes the direction and rapidness of these changes is known as a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient\"></a>. Informally, gradient describes how some property changes from one point to another, and, thankfully, this notion tracks closely with how this word is used in graphic design to describe smooth color changes. Wherever you see a  , this also implies that there is a   – the pressure changes from place to place.</p><p>This spatial variation is particularly important for the motion of air. Recall that the air pressure differences don’t just exert forces on solid objects, but also on the air itself – any small parcel of air is subject to the same whims of pressure forces.</p><p>Those spatial variations in pressure end up pushing the air around, changing its velocity. Let’s see this in action using the little leaf-like  that are moved around by pressure differences. In the demonstration below, I’m steadily releasing the  from the left side –&nbsp;notice how their trajectory changes when you modify the pressure field:</p><p>You may still find it a little difficult to grasp how pressure differences affect the motion of a parcel of air. Luckily, we can draw parallels between the contour lines of pressure seen on these pressure maps and the contour lines of elevation seen on traditional maps. This lets us build a little pressure-landscape analogy.</p><p>In the demonstration below, the very same distribution of pressure is expressed as a mountainy landscape.  pressure lifts the ground above the base level and  pressure depresses it below the base level. A parcel of air moves like a marble that loses speed when climbing uphill and accelerates when rolling downhill. You can drag the demo around to change the viewing angle:</p><p>Notice that when the pressure changes more rapidly and the contour lines are closer, the steepness of the corresponding hill or valley also increases, and so do the forces acting on a parcel of air. If the pressure is increasing by a large amount, it may even make the  go back. This landscape analogy also shows that the static pressure doesn’t matter for the motion of air parcels, as any changes in static pressure would just lift all the areas by the same amount without changing their steepness.</p><p>When watching these air parcels move around, you may have noticed that things were a little bit off. For example, it’s possible for air parcels coming from different directions to arrive at the same location, and then continue to travel in different directions. You can see an example of that on the left side of the demonstration below, with the slider letting you :</p><p>Recall that the markers always follow the local velocity of air, so the motion seen in the left part implies that the air at the <a href=\"https://ciechanow.ski/airfoil/#\" onclick=\"parcels_crossing_f0();return false;\">location of the meetup</a> of the   has two different velocities at the same time, which is not realistic.</p><p>It’s worth pointing out that the situation seen on right side, where  merely <a href=\"https://ciechanow.ski/airfoil/#\" onclick=\"parcels_crossing_f1();return false;\">intersects</a> the  of the ,  be realistic, as long as we’re dealing with an unsteady flow, where the  of the air at the crossing location has changed since the  was there. For steady conditions in which no changes occur over time, the scenario seen on the right is also not physically correct.</p><p>We’ll look at some unsteady flows later in the article, but for now we’re interested in steady conditions so the crossing paths of our  indicate implausible velocities. Even more dubious result happen when we simulate the motion of these  with an  present in the flow:</p><p>For most distributions of pressure, the air markers will flow right through the . This is clearly wrong! The demonstrations we’ve seen so far correctly represent what would happen to individual air parcels and bodies placed in these pressure fields, but those pressure fields themselves were completely made up and didn’t correspond to any physical reality. Our mistake was that we completely ignored any interactions between the pressure of the air and the  of that air.</p><p>The flow of air, the pressure of air, and the shape of the objects placed in that air are all tied together – for a given incoming flow speed and the shape of the object, we can’t just arbitrarily arrange the pressure field like we did in our artificial demonstrations. Instead, that pressure field will arise on its own.</p><p>Let’s see a  distribution of pressure around this airfoil and witness how it affects the motion of air parcels around it:</p><p>The behavior of air parcels now matches our intuitive expectations – the  don’t go through the body, and in these steady conditions they also don’t cross paths.</p><p>We’re now one step closer to understanding how the flow of air takes its shape to move around an  – it’s the pressure differences that cause the flow to change its direction and speed.</p><p>The pressure field we’ve just seen clearly works – regions of  and  pressure guide the air around the airfoil. However, it’s still unclear how these areas emerged in the first place. Let’s try to follow nature’s path to see how this pressure distribution is created and sustained in a flow.</p><p>Before we start building the correct pressure field from scratch, let’s first establish two guiding principles that the flow around any object has to follow.</p><p>Firstly, the air can’t penetrate solid walls. A valid pressure field should either completely stop the flow at the surface of the object, or redirect that flow to make it travel in the direction perpendicular to the walls. This means that the markers that we track can never get inside the object.</p><p>Secondly, we also have the restrictions on the relative motion of the markers. For now we’ll only be interested in steady conditions, which means that the markers can’t cross their paths – we expect the ghostly historical trails to never intersect.</p><p>Let’s first focus on the pressure field in front of the airfoil. In the demonstration below, I created an  pressure field in that frontal region, you can control it using the slider:</p><p>It should quickly become clear that to prevent the approaching air from getting into the object, the pressure in the frontal region has to be , so that it pushes the incoming air away.</p><p>If that  in front is <a href=\"https://ciechanow.ski/airfoil/#\" onclick=\"symmetric_airfoil_fvm4_f0();return false;\">too low</a> the air can still erroneously flow through the object. If that pressure is <a href=\"https://ciechanow.ski/airfoil/#\" onclick=\"symmetric_airfoil_fvm4_f1();return false;\">too high</a>, the air parcels arriving at the airfoil will turn back and incorrectly cross paths with the incoming air. When the pressure is <a href=\"https://ciechanow.ski/airfoil/#\" onclick=\"symmetric_airfoil_fvm4_f2();return false;\">just right</a>, the air parcels don’t go through the wall, and, at least in front of the object, they also don’t cross their paths.</p><p>The faster the incoming flow, the higher the pushing force required to slow down and redirect the incoming air. In the demonstration below, you can also control the  of that incoming air using the second slider:</p><p>The pressure needed to stop air at a given velocity is known as <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stagnation_pressure\"></a> and it’s proportional to the  of that velocity – twice as high speed requires four times larger pressure.  Naturally, when there is <a href=\"https://ciechanow.ski/airfoil/#\" onclick=\"symmetric_airfoil_fvm5_f4();return false;\">no flow</a>, no pressure is required as the air no longer tries to flow through the object.</p><p>In the previous two demonstrations, we manually adjusted the pressure to get the correct result, but in nature this process happens on its own – it’s the flow  that creates this region of increased pressure in front of the object.</p><p>As the incoming parcels of air arrive at the surface of the airfoil, they can’t continue going forward, but air parcels from further up ahead continuously want to keep flowing into this region. This compresses the air close to the object, which causes the pressure in front to increase, which then helps to slow down the incoming flow.</p><p>This mechanism is self-balancing – if the pressure is too low to push away the incoming air parcels, the air parcels will compact the existing air more, causing an increase in pressure. If the pressure is too high, it will easily push the incoming air away, which relieves the frontal area, causing the pressure to decrease. Any fluctuations quickly settle to an equilibrium that balances the pressure in the entire frontal region.</p><p>Let’s look at the distribution of the  frontal pressure once more:</p><p>Notice that the  isn’t limited to just the close vicinity of the airfoil, but it spreads out much further ahead to gradually reach the value of the static pressure, far away from the airfoil itself.</p><p>All in all, we have a large area of increasing pressure that starts far away from the body and ends at its surface. Those pressure differences create a pressure “hill” that not only gradually slows the incoming air down, but it also redirects that air to flow around the object.</p><p>It seems that with our frontal pressure field we’ve easily completed our goal of preventing the air from flowing through the walls of the body. However, our second guideline of non-crossing marker paths is still not fulfilled – this condition is broken above and below the airfoil.</p><p>Let’s first try to rectify this manually. In the demonstration below, you can control the pressure in these two regions using the slider:</p><p>While  values of pressure in those zones make the <a href=\"https://ciechanow.ski/airfoil/#\" onclick=\"symmetric_airfoil_fvm6_f0();return false;\">problem worse</a>,  values get us <a href=\"https://ciechanow.ski/airfoil/#\" onclick=\"symmetric_airfoil_fvm6_f1();return false;\">much closer</a> to the expected behavior – in the top and bottom areas the  no longer veer off into different directions. However, that pressure can’t be <a href=\"https://ciechanow.ski/airfoil/#\" onclick=\"symmetric_airfoil_fvm6_f2();return false;\"> low</a>, otherwise it will pull the  back into the body.</p><p>In real flow, these regions of  pressure arise on their own, but the explanation for this phenomenon is a little less straightforward than what I’ve described for the area of  pressure in the frontal region. We can get , albeit a bit hand-wavy,  understanding by observing what happens to the air  when those  regions are <a href=\"https://ciechanow.ski/airfoil/#\" onclick=\"symmetric_airfoil_fvm6_f3();return false;\">missing</a>.</p><p>In that scenario, the incoming air parcels no longer reach those areas above and below the airfoil, causing some local depletion of air that has since left those zones. This decreases the pressure in those regions, and that lower pressure attracts the surrounding air to flow into those less occupied spaces.</p><p>If that lower pressure is  negative, more air will come in and the pressure will rise. If the pressure is not negative enough, those region will get depleted again. Once again, it’s the flow itself that creates the balancing system – without the flow no pressure differences would arise.</p><p>As we’ll see later on, in more extreme scenarios that negative pressure can alter the flow more dramatically, and the regions of “missing” air get filled through other means, but for now let’s close things up by tweaking the pressure in the rear part of the airfoil:</p><p>Some amount of  pressure in the rear <a href=\"https://ciechanow.ski/airfoil/#\" onclick=\"symmetric_airfoil_fvm7_f0();return false;\">prevents</a> the air parcels from smashing into each other after leaving the airfoil. Intuitively, this pressure arises naturally from the flow, because as the air slides off from the ends of the top and bottom sides, it all arrives into the same region, creating some compression.</p><p>If that compressive pressure in the rear is too low, more air will manage to get in, which will further increase the pressure. If that pressure is too high, it will push the incoming air away, which depletes the area and the pressure decreases. The system balances itself yet again.</p><p>The quite informal description of these balances that I’ve presented can be formalized mathematically using the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navier%E2%80%93Stokes_equations\"></a>. These equations describe the motion of liquids and gasses, collectively known as <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid\"></a>, subject to various forces like gravity, or, most importantly for us, pressure.</p><p>Navier–Stokes equations are <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navier%E2%80%93Stokes_existence_and_smoothness\"></a> to solve analytically, but a lot of insight about the behavior of fluids can be gained with computer simulations with various degrees of complexity.</p><p>In this article, I’m also employing simulations to investigate the flow of air around objects. However, the computer models used here are quite simplified and they don’t reflect the  richness of physics involved in the motion of air. These  demonstrations are intended to present the broad strokes of the delicate interaction between the air and the airfoil, but I would advise against relying on them when building an airworthy airplane.</p><p>With all of these caveats in place, let’s get back to the pressure distribution around a symmetric airfoil. We’re done recreating the nature-made pressure field, but there is one small aspect that we haven’t yet accounted for.</p><p>For our experiments, I kept the pressure steady in time so that we could focus on its general outlines. In practice, a pressure field imposed by a fast flow around any object will experience some degree of instability, which you can see in the demonstration below. You can once more drop the markers at any location to track the flow in the area:</p><p>As the pressure builds up on one side, it redirects the flow, which changes the pressure again. The pressure ends up oscillating back and forth like a swing. The pressure distribution and the flow direction are once again at the mercy of their mutual balance, one affecting the other. We’ll soon see some other examples of these unstable behaviors.</p><p>As we’ve just seen, the variation in pressure doesn’t just happen in the close vicinity of the airfoil, but it stretches quite far away from the body itself. This means that the velocity of the flow is also affected quite far away from the shape.</p><p>However, when it comes to the forces exerted on the airfoil, it’s only the pressure right at the surface of the airfoil that matters. Let’s bring back the two tools we’ve used before:  that show how the air pushes or “pulls” on the airfoil, and the  arrow that tallies up the net results of :</p><p>As the pressure field fluctuates, the resulting  also moves around. Let’s decompose this force into two different components, one   to the flow, and one  to it:</p><p>The force acting in the direction perpendicular to the flow is known as , and the one acting in the direction of the flow is known as , or <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parasitic_drag#Form_drag\"></a>. As the name implies, this component of drag is created by the distribution of pressure around the shape.</p><p>For this airfoil, the  is very tiny. While airfoils are specifically designed to minimize the overall drag, most of that force hindering their motion comes from another source – we’ll discuss it soon enough.</p><p>Notice that as this flow fluctuates, the  force jumps around, but averaged over time the upward and downward swings of that  end up balancing each other. This airfoil in  configuration doesn’t generate any continuous lift.</p><p>This shouldn’t come as a surprise since this situation is completely symmetric, so the pressure forces on the upper and lower sides of the airfoil are, on average, completely balanced. However, there is an easy way to disturb that symmetry. In the demonstration below, we’re once again meeting the plain, symmetric airfoil, but this time we can gently  it using the slider:</p><p>The  controls the so-called <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angle_of_attack\"></a>, which is spanned between some reference line on the body, like the one joining the front and back, and the direction of the incoming flow. I’m showing this angle right in the middle of the airfoil.</p><p>As we <a href=\"https://ciechanow.ski/airfoil/#\" onclick=\"symmetric_airfoil_fvm20_f0();return false;\">change</a> the , the shape that the airflow “sees” is no longer symmetrical relative to the incoming direction of that flow. The velocity and pressure fields adapt in their mutual push and pull to form a new, asymmetric distribution. Notice that the stagnation point of  has moved around, and the little markers that indicate the motion of air now travel on very different paths below and above and below the airfoil.</p><p>If we then put the  back in, we can tally them all up to get the resulting  and . When compared to the previous simulation, I’m scaling down all the arrows to make them fit in the bounds of the demonstration:</p><p>When this symmetric airfoil is <a href=\"https://ciechanow.ski/airfoil/#\" onclick=\"symmetric_airfoil_fvm21_f0();return false;\">tilted up</a>, the asymmetric pressure distribution generates a  that pushes the object up. Conversely, for a <a href=\"https://ciechanow.ski/airfoil/#\" onclick=\"symmetric_airfoil_fvm21_f1();return false;\">downward tilted airfoil</a>, the pressure forces  the airfoil down.</p><p>Naturally, we’re typically interested in upward-pointing forces, and when the  generated by the wings is equal to the weight of the plane, the plane will stay in the air without raising or falling to the ground – we’re finally flying.</p><p>Let’s plot the dependence between the  and the  of an airfoil – you can see it in the right side of the demonstration below. Note that this plot presents time-averaged and  values, so you may have to wait a little for the flow to normalize and the  to start oscillating around the expected value:</p><p>Clearly, as the  increases, so does the generated . The same thing happens on the other end of the spectrum, where a more negative   creates more negative lift. Note that for this symmetric airfoil the positive and negative sides of the diagram are just mirror images of each other, so let’s focus only on positive  .</p><p>One could naively hope that we could keep increasing the   to generate more and more . Let’s see what happens in practice:</p><p>Initially, the  force indeed keeps increasing with the , but at some point <a href=\"https://ciechanow.ski/airfoil/#\" onclick=\"symmetric_airfoil_fvm23_f0();return false;\">it plateaus</a>. Once that  angle of attack is surpassed, the  force <a href=\"https://ciechanow.ski/airfoil/#\" onclick=\"symmetric_airfoil_fvm23_f1();return false;\">starts to fall</a> after the flow <a href=\"https://ciechanow.ski/airfoil/#\" onclick=\"symmetric_airfoil_fvm23_f2();return false;\">fully develops</a>.</p><p>What we’re witnessing here is known as a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stall_(fluid_dynamics)\"></a>. The onset of a stall imposes limits on how much  the wings of an airplane can generate from merely increasing the angle of attack.</p><p>Notice that when the stall happens, the pressure distribution on the upper part of the airfoil becomes very erratic – it’s not only the surface  that are changing rapidly, but the whole pressure field in that area is very disturbed.</p><p>Let’s bring in the velocity arrows and markers to get a better feel on what’s going on in that region:</p><p>At high angles of attack, the flow above the upper part of the airfoil becomes very complicated. If you  in that region to drop a few markers, you’ll notice that the air is trapped in various swirling eddies that are eventually shed to fly away with rest of the flow.</p><p>We’re witnessing <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_separation\"></a>, where the main part of the flow detaches from the surface and doesn’t follow its shape anymore. The interactions in the complicated flow right above the airfoil affect the pressure field, which then .</p><p>There is a lot going on there, but to understand how these effects arise we have to talk about a property that affects the flow of every fluid: viscosity.</p><p>You might have heard the term <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viscosity\"></a> used to describe “thickness” of different liquids, with a classic example that contrasts the slowness of the flow of honey to the rapidness of the flow of water.</p><p>Viscosity is also a property of gasses like air, but before I describe this concept more formally, we’ll first build an intuitive understanding of what viscosity is and what it does to the flow of different fluids.</p><p>In the demonstration below, the fluid flows in from the left side, but note that the flow in the top half is faster than the flow in the bottom half, which is reflected by the different lengths of the arrows. Dragging the slider to the left decreases the  of the fluid, and dragging the slider to the right increases :</p><p>While we can see some changes to the arrows as we move the slider around, you probably agree that, for this flow, the arrow-based visualization isn’t very rewarding. Let’s add the color-based  distribution in this flow:</p><p>We can now see how  blends the speed variation between different sections of the fluid. For highly <a href=\"https://ciechanow.ski/airfoil/#\" onclick=\"fdm2_f0();return false;\">viscous fluids</a>, this mixing behavior spreads very easily and the initially distinct velocities of the two layers average out quite rapidly.</p><p>At <a href=\"https://ciechanow.ski/airfoil/#\" onclick=\"fdm2_f1();return false;\">lower viscosity</a> these two layers with different speeds remain quite separated. If you make the viscosity <a href=\"https://ciechanow.ski/airfoil/#\" onclick=\"fdm2_f2();return false;\">low enough</a>, you may even notice that, after a while, the flow develops some interesting wave-like phenomena – we’ll get back to these soon.</p><p>All this mixing behavior may remind you of a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffusion\"></a> process, where some quantity, like temperature or concentration, evens out over time. Let’s see some basic diffusion in action. In the simulation below, I filled half of the bottle with with , while the other half is filled with . The slider lets you control the :</p><p>As <a href=\"https://ciechanow.ski/airfoil/#\" onclick=\"bottle_f0();return false;\">time passes</a>, the sharp difference between the two layer blends more and more to eventually completely disappear. Clearly, there is some similarity between the diffusion of differently  and the averaging of velocity that we’ve seen in the earlier example.</p><p>In our flow demonstrations,  seemed to have controlled the diffusion of velocity. To define it more precisely,  controls the diffusion of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Momentum\"></a>, which is a product of velocity  mass. The simplified fluids we’re looking at have more or less constant density, so each equally-sized parcel of those fluids has the same mass. Therefore, if it makes things easier for you, wherever you see the word momentum you can think of velocity, but in more complex scenarios these differences can matter.</p><p>Let me bring in the previous flow simulation one more time:</p><p>You’ve probably noticed that, as the flow moves to the right, the size of this blended region increases. When the regions of fluid with different momentums meet for the first time, they barely have any time to average out, and the blending is minimal. As time passes, these regions of fluid get to average out more, similarly to how two different layers of dyed water mix more over time.</p><p>However, as time is passing, these parcels also , and that stronger blending happens further to the right. The downstream regions had more time to mix and average out, so the visible thickness of the blended region on the right side is also larger.</p><p>With higher , the size of blended region grows much more quickly, which lets us be more precise about our working definition –  controls the  of the diffusion of momentum.</p><p>So far we’ve only observed flows with nicely separated horizontal layers, but  averages momentum between  two regions of fluids. In the demonstration below, you can witness how  affects a swirly motion of fluid in a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vortex\"></a>:</p><p>Notice that with <a href=\"https://ciechanow.ski/airfoil/#\" onclick=\"fdm4_f0();return false;\">high viscosity</a> any differences in velocity are very quickly diluted out into nothing, but with <a href=\"https://ciechanow.ski/airfoil/#\" onclick=\"fdm4_f1();return false;\">low viscosity</a> the revolving motion can survive for quite a while.</p><p> has a damping or smoothing effect that makes it much harder to sustain any large variation in a velocity field. Let’s see how this affects the motion of objects in fluids of various viscosity. In the demonstration below, we’re tracking a velocity field close to a very  put directly in the stream of an incoming fluid of adjustable :</p><p>With <a href=\"https://ciechanow.ski/airfoil/#\" onclick=\"fdm5_f0();return false;\">high viscosity</a>, there is a large region of slow down around the  that regains its speed fairly quickly behind the object. At <a href=\"https://ciechanow.ski/airfoil/#\" onclick=\"fdm5_f1();return false;\">lower viscosity</a> that surrounding region is much smaller, but it extends much further behind the . For <a href=\"https://ciechanow.ski/airfoil/#\" onclick=\"fdm5_f2();return false;\">very low viscosity</a> we’re once again seeing some more unusual behavior that we’ll get back to in a minute.</p><p>From the dark colors we can easily see that right by the surface of the  the fluid doesn’t move at all – it sticks to that surface. This velocity difference between the halted flow at the wall and the moving outer flow gets smoothed out over time by , similar to how it blended in the flow between two different layers of fluid.</p><p>As before, with higher , the velocity averaging process becomes more rapid, and the blended region becomes more widespread. This averaging effect doesn’t just alter the velocity of fluid, but it also affects the plate. In some sense, the  also wants to make the velocity of the surface of the  to be more like the velocity of the surrounding flow.</p><p>The viscosity makes the flow want to pull the  with it, which creates a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shear_force\"></a> that tries to slide the surface of this object away. The net effect is that that viscosity creates additional drag known as <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin_friction_drag\"></a> that wants to slow down any object moving in it.</p><p>All of these effects underline why highly viscous fluids are “thick”. Viscosity not only quickly averages any local differences in velocity, which prevents those fluids from flowing easily, but it also represses motion of objects in those fluids – you’ve likely experienced the difficulty of moving a spoon through a jar of honey.</p><p>The flow of any fluid exhibits tiny, random disturbances. In fluids with high viscosity, these variations are very quickly dispersed, so their motion is rarely erratic. Fluids with low viscosity aren’t as effective at damping motion, and these disturbances can grow to create oscillatory patterns. We’ve seen glimpses of them in the previous simulations, but here is another example:</p><p>At lower viscosity the flow becomes <a href=\"https://ciechanow.ski/airfoil/#\" onclick=\"fdm10_f0();return false;\">quite wave-y</a>. Those <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelvin%E2%80%93Helmholtz_instability\"></a> happen at the border of regions of fluid with different velocities, like where the slow wake behind a plate is in contact with the fast external flow. In those regions, any tiny random intrusion of slower flow into the faster flow can get magnified and rolled over like a wave.</p><p>In our discussion of the motion of air around an airfoil, we’ve seen how the flow, the pressure field, and the shape of the body have effects on each other. These influences can be quite dynamic in nature, with distributions of velocity and pressure swinging back and forth in a never-ending fight for dominance.</p><p>In the demonstration below, we can see a more dramatic example of these battles, where, depending on the , the flow around a  can take many different forms:</p><p>While I can’t easily simulate it here, with further decrease in viscosity, the flow <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8zKWaxohng\">can develop</a> full featured <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turbulence\"></a> in which highly irregular and chaotic mixing motions occur at different scales. Turbulent flow stands in contrast to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laminar_flow\"></a>, in which neighboring areas of fluid move in an orderly way past each other without any varying fluctuations.</p><p>Although we’ve put most of our focus on , which is often denoted with the Greek letter , the general behavior of the flow also depends on its velocity , density , and the size  of the body or container involved in the flow. These parameters are tied together by the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reynolds_number\"></a>:</p><p>Flows with the same Reynolds numbers exhibit similar behavior, which means that if we make the obstacle size  twice as large and we halve the speed of the flow , the Reynolds number won’t change and neither will the characteristics of the flow – it will exhibit the same smooth or oscillatory motion.</p><p>The Reynolds number also “predicts” the onset of turbulence. When we increase the speed of the flow , or decrease the viscosity , the Reynolds number rises. When it reaches a high enough value, turbulence is likely to occur.</p><p>Let’s quantify the difference in viscosity between different fluids. The precise values aren’t that important to us, but to briefly be a bit more formal, viscosity is expressed in units of pascal-seconds, or . To let us use more manageable numbers, the following table uses millipascal-seconds, or :</p><table><tbody></tbody></table><p>These values are measured at , but many fluids like oil get much less viscous with increased temperature. As expected, honey is significantly more viscous than water. Compared to water, the viscosity of air is around 50 times less still, but even a very low viscosity has effects on flow and its interaction with solid walls.</p><p>To understand how viscosity arises in gasses like air, we have to once more get back to the world of particles. So far we’ve been watching them from a distance, with individual collisions barely perceptible in the moving swarm. This time we’re going take a closer look at these interactions.</p><p>In the demonstration below, you can experience a simplified simulation of  colliding in space. Each molecule represents nitrogen or oxygen – these two elements constitute the vast majority of air, and, in normal conditions, each one consists of two atoms.</p><p>You can drag the  around, and once you let go I’ll automatically aim it so that it hits the . The speed of the  is four times larger than the speed of the :</p><p>Notice that after the collision, it’s the  that’s slow, and it’s the  that’s fast. In this demonstration the two particles have the same mass and they collide straight on, so they simply end up trading velocities.</p><p>More generally, particles of different masses that strike each other at different angles will exchange some amount of momentum. Recall that the heavier the particle, or the faster it moves, the higher its momentum.</p><p>Let’s see how this behavior ends up affecting the average velocities of larger quantities of molecules. In the  demonstration below, air molecules are grouped into two different parts. The air in the  has higher velocity than the air in the , which you can see in the black arrows showing the  in those regions. Notice what happens to  as you let  by dragging the slider:</p><p>At the very beginning, the  in these  are visibly different, but they quickly even out when fast particles from the  flow into the slower , and the slower particles from the  move into the faster , balancing the initial velocity differences.</p><p>Moreover, some of the faster particles collide with slower particles in the  and some of the slower particles collide with faster particles from . The faster particles lose some of their higher momentum, while the slower particles gain some of the momentum. All of these effects “dilute” some of those average velocity differences between the two regions.</p><p>You may also remember that when we observed a flow of fluid around a flat plate, that fluid wasn’t moving at all right on the surface of that plate, because it was stuck to it. Let’s see how this behavior may arise on a microscopic scale.</p><p>In the demonstration below, we’re watching the familiar air particles right next to the . To make tracking easier, I’m  some of the particles in the vicinity of this :</p><p>When seen at a very large magnification, this , like almost all surfaces, isn’t perfectly smooth and has various peaks and valleys. The particles hitting these irregularities get bounced in more or less random directions. Some of the unlucky molecules can even get stuck for a while in these local crevices.</p><p>Close to the , the random collisions with peaks and valleys prevent the particles from making bulk progress in  direction. The average velocity of the air flow by the wall is more or less zero. Some molecular interactions between the particles and the  can also prevent the fluid from moving.</p><p>This sticking behavior is known as the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No-slip_condition\"></a> and it holds true for most typical flows of fluids that we experience day to day. It’s only in extreme conditions of very rarified gasses in the upper parts of the atmosphere or flows in microscopic capillaries that can break this assumption.</p><p>Let’s leave the world of particles behind for the last time and see how these two effects play an important role of influencing the airflow close to the surface of any object.</p><p>Let’s take another look at a   placed in the stream of incoming fluid:</p><p>From this broader perspective, it’s hard to see how the flow interacts with the surface of that , because the effects of viscosity are limited to the region close to that surface. Let’s focus our attention on the small area that I’ve outlined with a  line, right in the top part of the . Here it is zoomed up close:</p><p>We can once more see that, due to the no-slip condition, the velocity is zero at the , and then it  the velocity of the flow further away from the surface itself. What we’re seeing here is known as the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boundary_layer\"></a>, which spans the region between the  of the object and the “outer” flow, which is mostly unaffected by the presence of the object.</p><p>Because the velocity in the boundary layer smoothly approaches the speed of the outer flow, it doesn’t have a well-defined end point. One of the choices is to agree that the boundary layer ends where the speed reaches 99% of the speed of the surrounding flow far away from the . Let me visualize this boundary in the flow using a :</p><p>As we move with the flow along the distance of the plate, the viscosity keeps averaging out the velocity differences, making the boundary layer thicker – this is similar to what we’ve seen at larger scales with highly viscous flows around objects.</p><p>Let’s quantify the distribution of speed in the boundary layer a little more precisely. In the demonstration below, I put the velocity arrows back in. I then connected the ends of these arrows with a thin line to show a  of velocity at that location along the :</p><p>Notice that, initially, the velocity close to the wall increases almost linearly, but then it smoothly tapers to reach the speed of the external flow. The velocity profile close to the surface has a certain steepness, which I’m showing with the . This line determines the amount of skin friction drag at that spot – the closer to the , or more horizontal, the  is, the higher the skin drag.</p><p>As the differences in velocity become less severe, the force with which viscosity wants to drag the surface with the flow also decreases. In the conditions present in the demonstration, the skin friction drag decreases over distance.</p><p>At this point you hopefully have an intuitive grasp of how viscosity affects the flow close to the surface of the object. From our earlier discussion, you may also remember that pressure differences also affect how the flow behaves, with parcels of air slowing down when climbing the hill of  and accelerating on the downhill of the .</p><p>In the boundary layer flows we played with, the pressure distribution was more or less constant in the investigated region. Let’s see how the flow changes when we vary that pressure.</p><p>In the top part of the demonstration below we see the exact same view of velocity we’ve experimented with so far. In the bottom part of the demonstration below you can see the pressure distribution in the boundary layer, which you can change using the slider below.</p><p>If the pressure <a href=\"https://ciechanow.ski/airfoil/#\" onclick=\"boundary4_f0();return false;\">decreases</a> in the direction of the flow in the boundary layer, we say that the pressure gradient is . <strong></strong> accelerates the air, and the boundary layer doesn’t grow as quickly, since the slowdown caused by viscosity is opposed by that acceleration.</p><p>When the pressure <a href=\"https://ciechanow.ski/airfoil/#\" onclick=\"boundary4_f1();return false;\">increases</a> in the direction of the flow, we say that the pressure gradient is . <strong></strong> pushes  the direction of motion of the air. Far away from the , the air has enough momentum that the adverse pressure merely slows the flow down. However, close to the , the flow in the boundary layer was slow in the first place, so a pushing <strong></strong> may even reverse the direction of the flow.</p><p>When the flow in the boundary layer gets reversed, we say that the boundary layer . This region of reversed flow can form a sort of wedge that can lift the rest of the flow away from the .</p><p>Let’s take a step back from the subtleties of boundary layers to see how what we’ve learned corresponds to behavior of a flow around an airfoil. Let me once more bring up the demonstration that brought us here in the first place:</p><p>As we move across the surface of the airfoil, the  at the stagnation point up front gradually decreases to reach  close to the “peak” of that curved surface. Across this transition the <strong></strong>, and that distribution works in our favor – the boundary layer stays nicely attached to the surface.</p><p>However, as the air reaches the valley of the , it then has to start climbing back up to reach the  pressure in the rear of the airfoil. For <a href=\"https://ciechanow.ski/airfoil/#\" onclick=\"symmetric_airfoil_fvm24a_f0();return false;\">small values</a> of the  , the pressure pit from which the air has to climb out is not very deep and the <strong></strong> isn’t very strong, so the boundary layer remains attached.</p><p>As we <a href=\"https://ciechanow.ski/airfoil/#\" onclick=\"symmetric_airfoil_fvm24a_f1();return false;\">increase</a> the  of the airfoil, the pressure on top becomes  and . For even <a href=\"https://ciechanow.ski/airfoil/#\" onclick=\"symmetric_airfoil_fvm24a_f2();return false;\">higher angles</a>, the <strong></strong> becomes so strong that it  <a href=\"https://ciechanow.ski/airfoil/#\" onclick=\"symmetric_airfoil_fvm24a_f3();return false;\">eventually</a> reverses the flow in the boundary layer, creating separation. Let’s look at this region up close to see how the arrows of velocity in the separated region point in the other direction:</p><p>If you  to add  in the bottom right corner of the simulation you’ll notice that many of them move  the bulk of the flow – the boundary layer and the flow have separated.</p><p>We’ll get back to looking at airfoils soon enough, but we still have a few things to wrap up in the world of boundary layers.</p><p>The boundary layers we’ve looked at so far were  – the layers of fluid with different velocities flowed in an orderly way on top of each other. However, at higher flow speeds and over larger distances, or at high Reynolds numbers, the flow in the boundary layer transitions to a  flow:</p><p>Be aware that what you’re seeing here is a very simplified simulation of a turbulent boundary layer. Turbulence is inherently three dimensional and it contains various evolving structures of different sizes that are extremely computationally expensive to evaluate in detail. Thankfully, you can find many videos of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wr984EOmNaY\">computer</a><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXsl4eyupUY\">simulations</a> and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1TbkLIDWys\">real flows</a> showing turbulent boundary layers.</p><p>While the laminar boundary layers we’ve seen in the past exhibited very organized flows, the turbulent one is very chaotic, with large and small swirls causing the flow to mix very rapidly. The transition from laminar to turbulent boundary layer happens spontaneously, but for a given flow speed, the location of the transition depends on surface roughness, steadiness of the flow outside of the boundary layer, and presence of pressure gradients.</p><p>At any given moment, the velocity profile in the turbulent boundary layer is very unsteady, but it can be averaged over time to get the mean distribution of speed. Let’s compare the  profiles of the  and  boundary layers:</p><p>In the dynamic simulation of the  boundary layer, we saw how the slower flow close to the  rapidly mixed with the upper regions of the flow. This slows down those faster sections, and we need to go farther away from the  for these sluggish intrusions to stop affecting the flow. For this reason, the  boundary layer is thicker and grows faster than a  boundary layer.</p><p>On the other hand, the strong   mixing causes the fast external flow to get close to the body, so the overall velocity profile by the  increases much more quickly in the  case as opposed to  case – I’m showing that with .</p><p>Recall that the more horizontal the velocity profile at the  of the object, the bigger the skin friction drag – a   boundary layer has higher skin friction drag than a  layer. Despite the cost of increased friction drag, a   boundary layer is often beneficial.</p><p>Because of that higher velocity closer to the surface, a turbulent boundary layer is more resistant to <strong></strong> and it can stay attached to the surface of an object for longer distances.</p><p>For some objects like golf balls, which purposefully make their boundary layer turbulent by roughing up the surface with little dimples, the delayed separation also decreases the  caused by uneven pressure distribution. That reduction more than compensates for the increased skin friction drag, making the dimply golf balls fly farther than equivalent smooth balls.</p><p>For airfoils, a turbulent boundary layer delays separation of the flow, which can help prevent stall at higher angles of attack, but at normal cruising conditions the increased skin friction becomes an important drawback. For many aerodynamic shapes in typical conditions, the skin friction drag is the primary contributor to the total drag that these objects experience.</p><p>As we’ve seen, by increasing the angle of attack on an airfoil, the lift force grows up to a certain limit, at which the boundary layer separates over most of the upper surface. By staying under this limit, a symmetric airfoil can safely generate lift force.</p><p>However, when it comes to   and , the shape of an airfoil isn’t particularly unique in its -creation capabilities. Most simple elongated shapes generate  when put in a flow at an  . In the demonstration below, you can  a  and see the forces exerted by the pressure field around it:</p><p>You may be surprised to see that, at small  , this flat plate also generates . An airfoil-like shape is not a requirement for  generation. After all, paper airplanes with their flat wings can fly just fine.  is just an outcome of the pressure distribution created and sustained by the flow.</p><p>Although it doesn’t take a sophisticated shape to generate lift at an angle of attack, a well-designed airfoil can often create more lift and with lower drag. In the last section of this article, we’ll explore how other variations to the shape of an airfoil can affect its characteristics.</p><p>Let’s go back to the simple symmetric airfoil we’ve been playing with thus far. This time, however, we’re able to control its  using the slider:</p><p>Notice that as we increase the  of the airfoil, the pressure on the top and bottom sections of the shape becomes more . For this symmetric airfoil at 0° angle of attack the thickness doesn’t change much other than increasing the .</p><p>However, if we break the symmetry of the shape, we can use thickness-dependence to make one side of the airfoil have a higher  pressure than the other. In the demonstration below, you can control the “thickness” of the upper surface of the airfoil using the slider:</p><p>Notice that an asymmetric shape creates an asymmetric pressure distribution, which ends up creating  without any changes to angle of attack. With some slight tweaking of this shape we finally recreated the asymmetric shape we first saw on the airplane in the early sections of this article.</p><p>Naturally, when combined with an increasing , this airfoil will generate even more  until it eventually reaches stalling conditions:</p><p>While symmetric airfoils are sometimes used in acrobatic airplanes, which often find themselves flying upside down, most typical planes use an asymmetric airfoil shape.</p><p>The underlying mechanism of  generation by changing the  or by shaping the object differently is ultimately the same – we’re changing the placement and orientation of the surface of the body relative to the incoming flow. The flow reacts by changing the velocity and pressure distribution, and the resulting pressure field creates the forces on that object.</p><p>This all means that we have a lot of flexibility in how an airfoil is shaped, as long as the resulting pressure distribution fulfills the design goals of achieving a certain amount of lift while minimizing drag.</p><p>For example, in some applications it’s important to minimize the skin friction drag caused by a turbulent boundary layer. Some  achieve this by shaping the airfoil to move the “pit” of  further to the back of the airfoil:</p><p>The <strong></strong> between the front and the lowest pressure point extends over a longer distance across the surface of this airfoil, which, at least in principle, helps to keep the boundary layer laminar to keep the skin friction low.</p><p>Notice that even this unusual airfoil had a rounded front and a sharp back. The roundness of the front helps the air smoothly flow around this area at different  , and the sharp back reduces the pressure drag by avoiding the separation of the flow.</p><p>The velocity of the flow around the airfoil is also a contributing factor to the design of the shape. Let’s look at the speed distribution in the flow around a simple asymmetric airfoil using the  and :</p><p>The flow above the airfoil is faster than the incoming flow as indicated by brighter colors. The markers that start in the same line don’t end up sliding off the airfoil in the same formation – the ones on top are further ahead. This is particularly visible for <a href=\"https://ciechanow.ski/airfoil/#\" onclick=\"airfoil_fvm3_f0();return false;\">larger</a> values of the .</p><p>This acceleration in the upper part becomes another point of consideration for airfoil design. While commercial airliners don’t fly faster than the speed of sound, the accelerated flow in the top part of an airfoil  break that barrier. This creates a shockwave that can sometimes be <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HekbC6Pl4_Y\">seen in flight</a>. Modern airliners use <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supercritical_airfoil\">supercritical airfoils</a> that are designed to reduce these drag-causing shockwaves by carefully controlling the speed of the flow around the wing.</p><p>Planes designed to fly  the speed of sound use <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supersonic_airfoils\"></a> that are quite different from the shapes we’ve seen. These airfoils have a thin profile and their front edge is sharp and not rounded. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supersonic_speed\"></a> flows of air are more complicated than what we’ve explored in this article, as variations in density and temperature become an important component of the behavior of the flow.</p><p>Many of the airfoils used today are designed specifically for the plane they’ll be used in. Moreover, that cross-sectional shape may change across the length of the wing. Real airplanes are three dimensional and the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wing_configuration\">overall shape of the wings</a> also significantly affects the lift and drag of an airplane, but ultimately all the resulting forces are an outcome of interactions between the flow and the body.</p><p>John Anderson’s <a href=\"https://www.mheducation.com/highered/product/fundamentals-aerodynamics-anderson/1264151926.html\">Fundamentals of Aerodynamics</a> is a very well-written textbook on aerodynamics. Over the course of over a thousand pages, the author presents a classic exposition of the motion of fluids and their interactions with bodies put in those flows.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.wiley.com/en-us/Understanding+Aerodynamics%3A+Arguing+from+the+Real+Physics-p-9781119967514\">Understanding Aerodynamics</a> by Doug McLean is a great textbook that takes a different approach of explaining aerodynamic phenomena using physical reasoning. For me, the crowning achievement of the publication is showing that many popular explanations of the origins of lift are either incorrect or they’re based on merely mathematically convenient theorems. The author’s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QKCK4lJLQHU\">video lecture</a> gives an overview of some of these misconceptions.</p><p>Finally, YouTuber <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/@braintruffle/videos\">braintruffle</a> created a series of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLMoTR49uj6ld32zLVWmcGXaW7w2ey7Vh4\">beautiful videos</a> that start with the behavior of fluids on a quantum scale and build up increasingly abstract models that can be used in more practical applications. The videos are packed with interesting takes on fluid mechanics, and they’re worth watching for their visuals alone.</p><p>If you were to sit on a flying airplane and look out the window to glance at its wings, you’d often have a hard time seeing anything going on. However, in that crisp clearness of air whose invisible flow sustains the varied pressure field, lies the hidden source of lift that overcomes the might of gravity to keep the plane safely above the ground.</p><p>Since the first human flight, we’ve now mastered the art of soaring in the skies by bending the flow of air to our will, using physical quantities like pressure and velocity to help shape our designs. These tangible concepts are ultimately just a manifestation of motions and collisions of billions of inanimate air particles that somehow conspire to assemble the forces we need.</p><p>I hope this deeper, technical exploration of airfoils hasn’t diminished your appreciation of the greatness of flight.

I knew all the workarounds and how to extract maximum efficiency from it.</p><p>I was a happy user, for over 20 years, and Windows has been my go-to for everything computer-related.</p><p>Even after becoming a software developer and using a macbook, I'd still find myself reaching for Windows at times.</p><p>That is, until Microsoft decided to turn it into something completely unrecognizable and unusable.</p><h2>It all came crashing down</h2><p>I think it started with the Windows 10 full-screen ads.</p><p>You know, those friendly suggestions telling you to try OneDrive or to \"use the recommended browser settings\" (<em>reads as \"please try Edge and OneDrive, we're desperate\"</em>).</p><p>Actually, scratch that, I think it really started with the non-consensual updates:</p><blockquote><p>Oh you're doing work? That's so cute... we're gonna close whatever apps you had open, because we're updating now. We own your computer.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>You had unsaved work? Too bad, it's gone, get bent.</p></blockquote><p>At first I ignored it, and carried on as normal. Sure, I'd get mad from time to time and I'd complain.</p><p>But hey, nothing beats the convenience of being able to have all of your applications in one place</p><p>My breaking point came with the 24H2 update. It installed on my system , like any other major update.\nI knew there were problems with it, people were already complaining on Reddit, so I just postponed it, and kept postponing it.</p><p>All it took was for me to leave my computer on and unattended for a while, and , just like that -  the major OS update that nobody wanted, it was on my computer.</p><h2>The Chrome Seizure Incident</h2><div><em>Spoiler: all hell broke loose.</em></div><p>As soon as 24H2 landed on my machine, I encountered a bug so bizarre I thought I was losing my marbles.\nIf Chrome was positioned  any other window, it would start having what I can only describe as a visual seizure.\nHere's Ableton Live with Chrome (Reddit) under it:</p><p>Worse, there was a decent chance this would trigger a full system lock, leaving me smashing my desk in impotent rage. I shit you not.</p><p>I tried to rollback. The rollback failed with an error. I reinstalled Windows. The bug persisted.\nLike digital herpes, I just couldn't get rid of it.<p>\nThe solution? Installing an Insider build. Yes, the solution to Microsoft's broken stable release was to use their </p> release.</p><blockquote><p><strong>For the Windows Defenders</strong> (see what I did there?), I tried uninstalling the display drivers with DDU, and testing other versions. It didn't help.</p><p>Either I stayed forever on the older build, or I'd have to deal with this.\nAnd don't tell me to forever disable updates, I'll completely lose it.</p></blockquote><h2>The Sequel I Never Wanted</h2><p>The Insider build worked...sort of. But now I had a new bug: Chrome would randomly lock up for about 30 seconds when a video was playing.\nMy options were to wait it out or press Ctrl+Alt+Delete and Esc to force my way back to a working browser.\nAfter some digging, I discovered this was caused by an NVIDIA-Microsoft driver incompatibility.</p><p>I've found out that the flickers and the chrome lock-up issues are likely caused by the Multiplane Overlay (MPO) pipeline. Microsoft blamed NVIDIA for not correctly implementing it in their drivers. NVIDIA blamed Microsoft.\nWhat's clear is that if you were facing this issue, you were essentially screwed because these 2 companies would just pass the hot potato to each other.</p><p>I should mention that this bug persisted even after I went off the Insider build and on 25H2. And when I posted on r/Microsoft, they just deleted it.</p><p>The latest and greatest OS surely cannot be broken beyond repair, surely I'm using my PC wrong.</p><p>So there I was, finally grasping the reality of what you're up against, as a Windows user:</p><ul><li>Random bugs that break basic functionality</li><li>Updates that install without permission and brick my system</li><li>Copilot and OneDrive ads appearing in every corner of the OS</li><li>Copilot buttons everywhere, coming for every application</li><li>Can't even make a local account without hacking the setup with Rufus (they even removed the terminal workaround)</li><li>Zero actionable fixes or even an aknowledgment of their fuckups</li></ul><p>People often say Linux is \"too much work.\".</p><p>And I agree. They're completely justified to complain. There's the documentation page diving, the forums, the reddit threads. And, most importantly, you have to basically rewire your brain and stop expecting it to behave like Windows used to.</p><p>But I looked at the list above and realized: Windows is now  too much work.\nAnd the difference with Windows is that you're going to do all that work while actively fighting your computer only for it to be undone when the next surprise update comes and ruins everything.</p><p>You might be thinking \"just disable updates, man\" or \"just install LTSC\", or \"just run some random debloat script off of GitHub\".\n Why would I jump through all these hoops? I'd rather put in the effort for an OS that knows what consent is and respects me as a user.</p><h2>Could the grass actually be greener on the other side?</h2><p>To set the stage: I'm a software developer and a musician.</p><p>As you can imagine, I was legitimately worried about app support on Linux, and how it would distrupt my workflow.</p><p>But after Chrome crashing for the 10000th time, I said \"enough is enough\", and decided to go big. I installed <a href=\"https://cachyos.org\">CachyOS</a>, a performance-focused Arch-based distribution, on my main machine (9800X3D, RTX 5080).</p><p>It wasn't a painless process. In fact, sleep mode was broken from the start,\nand my system would fail to detect the monitor after waking up.</p><p>What's more, Ableton Live does not have a native Linux build, only Windows and macOS. So I couldn't use it anymore, at least not without fucking around with Wine (which doesn't fully support it), or without keeping a Windows VM and taking an L on audio latency.</p><p>But unlike Windows, on CachyOS I could actually fix my NVIDIA woes by following <a href=\"https://discuss.cachyos.org/t/nvidia-and-sleep-failing-to-detect-monitor/12029/11\">this thread</a> on their forum.</p><p>All I had to do was add the NVIDIA modules to mkinitcpio. One config change, a command to rebuild the initramfs, and problem solved.</p><p>I also found a good native alternative to Ableton Live - <a href=\"https://www.bitwig.com/\">Bitwig Studio</a>, which bothered to release a native Linux Build.</p><p>Thanks to the constant progress that was made with Pipewire, I'm getting audio latency on par with Mac OS, and lower than Windows.\nAnd my workflow didn't even change that much, since Bitwig is made by ex-Ableton developers that seem to give a shit.</p><p>As for my development tools, on Windows you already accept the fact that  use WSL or docker, so realistically I just cut the broken middleman.</p><p>Now compare that to the Windows fuckery above.</p><h2>What You're Signing Up For</h2><p>If 3 years ago you would have told me that Microsoft would singlehandedly sabotage their own OS, doing more Linux marketing than the most neckbearded Linux fanboy (or the most femboy Thinkpad enjoyer), I'd have laughed in your face,\ncalled you delusional, and then hurled some more insults your way.</p><p>, I've been dual-booting CachyOS for over a year, and in the last month I've been using it exclusively.</p><p>If you're thinking about making the switch, I'd recommend you do a little research first.</p><p>Look up the tradeoffs between a rolling release distro and a stable release, it might just save you a headache.</p><p>For me, the fast updates of Cachy/Arch are a good thing, but you can imagine that you are effectively trading stability for new features.</p><p>So what is the actual state of Linux in 2026, from my honest perspective?</p><p>All major browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Brave) have native Linux builds. Full support. No compromises.\nVideo playback works flawlessly, with hardware acceleration even. On AMD, on NVidia and yes, on Intel too.</p><p>Linux is the  platform for development.</p><p>Better terminal support, native package managers, Docker runs natively without the WSL overhead, and your production servers are probably running Linux anyway.</p><p>Hell, even Microsoft has their own Linux distro, <a href=\"https://github.com/microsoft/azurelinux\">Azure Linux</a> (Formerly CBL-Mariner).</p><p>This is where people assume Linux falls short. And they're right, but not completely:</p><ul><li>: Runs via Winboat. Far from perfect (no video acceleration, laggy at times), but functional</li><li>: Native Linux app. Professional-grade video editing, free tier available</li><li>: Native Linux app, completely free and open source</li></ul><p>So while content creation is viable, the compromises might be dealbreakers.</p><ul><li>: Incredible DAW that runs natively on Linux</li><li>: Native, free, open-source DAW</li><li>: Thanks to PipeWire, Linux audio latency is actually  than Windows</li></ul><p>Here's where things get interesting. The perception is that gaming on Linux is a no-go. In 2026, that's increasingly untrue:</p><ul><li>: Pretty much all games without kernel-level anti-cheat work out of the box through Steam's Proton compatibility layer</li><li>: For AMD GPUs, gaming performance is on par with Windows, on average</li><li>: There was a 10-30% performance penalty on Intel/NVIDIA GPU setups, but recent Vulkan extensions are taking care of that.</li></ul><p>NVIDIA has released beta drivers making use of these improvements, and once Wine/DXVK/Proton are updated to make use of the extensions, the performance delta should be essentially gone</p><p>The only real limitation is that some games with anti-cheat like Valorant, Call of Duty or League of Legends won't run.\nBut honestly I think not being able to launch League of Legends is actually a feature - one final reason to install Linux.</p><p>It's not all bad, though. <a href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/app/1808500/ARC_Raiders/\">Arc Raiders</a> makes use of Easy Anti-Cheat, yet runs flawlessly. In fact, I've been playing it like a madman.\nIt goes to show that if the developers want to, it's possible.</p><p>Still falls short compared to Windows and Mac OS (Autodesk, I'm looking at you).</p><p>The silver lining is that Blender has a native build. So if it's your main application, you're good to go.</p><p>Basic operations are  on Linux.\nOpening directories, launching applications, system responsiveness.\nIt's like your computer took a line of coke, and is now ready to work.</p><p>No more waiting for the Start menu to decide it wants to open. No more File Explorer hanging when you need it the most.</p><p>Since we're on the topic of Linux improvements, I want to address the elephant in the room - people who keep saying \"I want to switch\", but keep moving the goalposts:</p><blockquote><p>\"I'll switch when Linux supports X.\"</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>\"Okay, but what about Y?\"</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>\"Well, Z is still missing...\"</p></blockquote><p>If you're always finding the next reason not to switch, you're not looking for solutions, <strong>you're looking for excuses to stay complacent</strong>.</p><p>I was that person, so I would know.</p><p>At the same time, <strong>I want to take it down a notch</strong> and say that there are still plenty of use cases (Especially creative work, and like stated previously, 3D modelling and also Game Dev) where it simply doesn't make sense to switch.</p><p>So if you're in that scenario, don't feel pressured, just wait for things to improve.</p><p>And if you don't plan on ever switching, more power to you.</p><p>I'm not here to judge, just here to vent my Microsoft frustrations.</p><p>And I didn't really want to switch either, because who wants to re-learn how their computer should be operated from scratch?\nWhat I really wanted was for Windows to work, but Microsoft didn't.</p><h2>The Windows Retrospective</h2><p>While I'm enjoying my new Linux setup, Windows 11 is having a miserable year, and we're only a month in!</p><p>According to <a href=\"https://www.windowslatest.com/2026/01/21/windows-11-had-20-major-update-problems-in-2025-and-and-2026-started-badly-too-what-are-you-doing-microsoft/\">Windows Latest</a>, there were over  in 2025 alone, and 2026 is starting off strong, with the January update causing black screens and Outlook crashes.</p><p><strong>Here's a quick 2025 Spotify Wrapped of the bugs Windows users dealt with:</strong></p><ul><li>USB audio devices randomly stopped working</li><li>Webcams failed to be detected</li><li>BitLocker settings became inaccessible</li><li>Adobe Premiere Pro couldn't drag clips on the timeline</li><li>Cursor constantly spinning for no reason</li><li>Remote Desktop sessions randomly disconnecting</li><li>The Copilot app accidentally getting deleted (okay, this is actually a good change for once)</li><li>Blue screens of death in mandatory security updates</li><li>Windows Hello face recognition broken</li><li>File Explorer becoming unresponsive</li><li>FPS drops and system reboots while gaming</li><li>Task Manager spawning infinite copies of itself</li><li>Dark mode breaking with white flashes</li></ul><p>And the company's response? Crickets. They're busy boasting that 30% of their code is currently being written by AI. Don't worry, Microsoft, we can definitely tell.</p><p>For the remainder of 2026, Microsoft is cooking up a big one: replacing more and more native apps with React Native.\nBut don't let the name fool you, it's never going to be as close to native as the real thing.\nThese are projects designed to be easily ported across any machine and architecture by making use of JavaScript.</p><p><s>And each one spawns its own Chromium process, gobbling up your RAM so you can enjoy the privilege of opening the Settings app.</s> And each one of these apps creates an instance of V8 or Hermes per app, which adds additional overhead (RAM + CPU). I'd argue you do not need that overhead just to open a <a href=\"https://devblogs.microsoft.com/react-native/rnw-settings-win11/\">Settings app</a>.</p><p>I could maybe understand this for a weather widget. But when it's coming for core system apps, I think it's just lazy.</p><p>I'm gonna go full conspiracy nut here, but I bet it's because it's easier for LLMs to write JavaScript, and Microsoft can't be asked to pay actual humans to write (and test) proper native code.</p><h2>Not Because I Wanted To, But Because Microsoft Forced My Hand</h2><p>So here I am.

I asked what “taking action” means, and they replied assuring me that all would become clear on January 24, when a post would be published on the ManyVids news feed “It will provide additional clarification and go into a bit more detail on this,” they said.&nbsp;ManyVids published <a href=\"https://imgur.com/a/Z3UB6yx?ref=404media.co\" rel=\"noreferrer\">several posts</a> on Saturday.

After 15 years of reflection — 3 years as a performer and 12 years as a CEO — I believe a 3-hour long-form podcast conversation is the best way to explain the why, the numbers, the logic, and the how behind this work.

LLMs seem to have picked up and spread this practice widely. But\n  most of this is self-defeating, the more a writer uses typographical emphasis,\n  the less power it has, quickly reaching the point where it loses all its\n  benefits.</p><p>There are various typographical tools that are used to emphasize words and\n  phrases, such as: bold, italic, capitals, and underlines. I find that bold is the one\n  that's getting most of the over-use. Using a lot of capitals is rightly\n  reviled as shouting, and when we see it used widely, it raises our doubts on\n  the quality of the underlying thinking.\n  Underlines have become the signal for hyperlinks, so I rarely see this for\n  emphasis any more. Both capitals and underlines have also been seen as rather\n  cheap forms of highlight, since we could do them with typewriters and\n  handwriting, while bold and italics were only possible after the rise of\n  word-processors. (Although I realize most of my readers are too young to\n  remember when word-processors were novel.)</p><p>Italics are the subtler form of emphasis. When I use them in a paragraph,\n  they don't leap out to the eye. This allows me to use them in long flows of text when\n  I want to set it apart, and when I use it to emphasize a phrase it only makes\n  its presence felt when I'm fully reading the text. For this reason, I prefer\n  to use italics for emphasis, but I only use it rarely, suggesting it's\n   important to put stress on\n  the word should I be speaking the paragraph (and I always try to write in the\n  <a href=\"https://martinfowler.com/bliki/SayYourWriting.html\">way that I speak</a>).</p><p>The greatest value of bold is that draws the eye to the bold text even if the\n  reader isn't reading, but glancing over the page. This is an important\n  property, but one that only works if it's used sparingly. Headings are often\n  done in bold, because the it's important to help the reader navigate a longer\n  document by skimming and looking for headings to find the section I want to read.</p><p>I rarely use bold within a prose paragraph, because of my desire to be\n  parsimonious with bold. One use I do like is to highlight unfamiliar words at\n  the point where I explain them. I got this idea from <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0534981283/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0534981283&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=martinfowlerc-20\">Giarratano and Riley</a>. I noticed that when the\n  unfamiliar term reappeared, I was often unsure what it meant, but glancing\n  back and finding the bold quickly reminded me. The trick here is to place the\n  bold at point of explanation, which is often, but not always, at its first\n  use. \n</p><p>A common idea is to take an important sentence and bold that, so it leaps\n  out while skimming the article. That can be worthwhile, but as ever with this\n  kind of emphasize, its effectiveness is inversely proportional to how often\n  it's used. It's also usually not the best tool for the job. Callouts usually\n  work better. They do a superior job of drawing the eye, and furthermore they don't\n  need to use the same words as in the prose text. This allows me to word the\n  callout better than it could be if it also had to fit in the flow of the\n  prose.</p><p>A marginal case is where I see bold used in first clause of each item in a\n  bulleted list. In some ways this is acting like a heading for the text in the\n  list. But we don't need a heading for every paragraph, and the presence of the\n  bullets does enough to draw the eye to the items. And bullet-lists are over\n  used too - I always try to write such things as a prose paragraph instead, as\n  prose flows much better than bullets and is thus more pleasant to read. It's\n  important to write in such a way to make it an enjoyable experience for the\n  reader - even, indeed especially, when I'm also trying to explain things for them.</p><p>While writing this, I was <b>tempted to illustrate my point</b> by using  in a paragraph,  and hopefully demonstrating\n  <b>why lots of bold loses the power to emphasize</b> and .\n  But I also wanted to <b>explain my position clearly</b>, and I felt that <b>illustrating\n  the problem</b> would thus . So I've  to a\n  .

But reaching the  stage still takes consistent practice because you’re learning both the language itself and how to think like a programmer.</p><p>The following timeline shows how long it typically takes to learn Python basics based on how much time you can practice each week:</p><div><table><thead><tr><th>Typical timeline for basics</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr></tr><tr><td>Realistic pace for busy adults</td></tr><tr><td>Consistent focus and fast feedback</td></tr><tr></tr></tbody></table></div><p>These ranges assume about . If you add a sixth day, you’ll likely land toward the faster end of each range.</p><p>You’ll get better results if you use this table as a planning guide. Don’t think of it as rigid deadlines—your learning pace depends on <a href=\"https://realpython.com/how-long-does-it-take-to-learn-python/#what-factors-influence-your-learning-speed\">many factors</a>. For example, if you already know another programming language, then you can usually move faster. If you’re brand-new to coding, then expect to be at the slower end of each range.</p><p>As a general guideline, many beginners reach the basics in about 2 to 6 months with steady practice.</p><div role=\"alert\"><p> If you’re ready to fast-track your learning with an expert-guided small cohort course that gives you live guidance and accountability, then check out <a href=\"https://realpython.com/live/\">Real Python’s live courses</a>!</p></div><p>With a focused schedule of around four hours per day, five days per week, you can often reach this stage in roughly 6 to 10 weeks, assuming you’re writing and debugging code most sessions. By then, you should be able to finish several small projects on your own.</p><p>When you read online that someone learned Python quickly, they’re probably talking about this basics stage. And indeed, with the right mix of dedication, circumstances, and practice, learning Python basics can happen pretty fast!</p><p>Before you go ahead and lock in a timeline, take a moment to clarify for yourself  you want to learn Python. Understanding your motivation for learning Python will help along the way.</p><div><div data-parent=\"#collapse_card811377\"><div><p>Learning Python means  than just learning the Python programming language. You need to know more than just the specifics of a single programming language to <strong>do something useful with your programming skills</strong>. At the same time, you don’t need to understand every single aspect of Python to be productive.</p><p>Learning Python is about learning how to accomplish practical tasks with Python programming. It’s about having a skill set that you can use to build projects for yourself or an employer.</p></div></div></div><p>As your next step, write down your personal goal for learning Python. Always keep that goal in mind throughout your learning journey. Your goal shapes what you need to learn and how quickly you’ll progress.</p><p>If you’re starting from zero and can spend about 5 to 10 hours per week, the following plan keeps you moving without becoming overwhelming:</p><p>Aim to finish at least one small project by the end of the month. The project matters more than completing every tutorial or task on your checklist.</p>","contentLength":4067,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Redwood attracts Google for its $425M Series E as AI power needs rise","url":"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/28/redwood-attracts-google-for-its-425m-series-e-as-ai-power-needs-rise/","date":1769608800,"author":"Kirsten Korosec","guid":425328,"unread":true,"content":"<article>Google is the latest investor to back Redwood Materials as the battery recycling startup scales a new energy storage venture to power AI data centers and other industrial sites.</article>","contentLength":177,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Snap gets serious about Specs, spins AR glasses into standalone company","url":"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/28/snap-gets-serious-about-specs-spins-ar-glasses-into-standalone-company/","date":1769608800,"author":"Lucas Ropek","guid":425329,"unread":true,"content":"<article>The social media company's smartglasses are set to be released to the public later this year. </article>","contentLength":94,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"AMD Ryzen 7 9850X3D Linux Performance","url":"https://www.phoronix.com/review/amd-ryzen-7-9850x3d-linux","date":1769608800,"author":"Michael Larabel","guid":425338,"unread":true,"content":"<article>Ahead of tomorrow's official availability of the AMD Ryzen 7 9850X3D at $499 USD, today the review embargo lifted.

Larry wants Warner Brothers (and CNN) as part of his obvious effort to build a new autocrat-friendly propaganda empire, and Trump has continually signaled his attempt to help him derail the Netflix deal.</p><blockquote><p><em>“What you’ve seen Netflix do as a general matter, in terms of their organic growth, is fantastic,” the FCC chair said. “There are legitimate competition concerns that I’ve seen raised about their acquisition here and just the sheer amount of scale and consolidation you can see in the streaming market.”</em></p></blockquote><p>Carr goes on to state he sees no competition issues with Larry Ellison, one of the wealthiest men on the planet and a key Trump donor and ally, hoovering up the entirety of new and old media.</p><p>One, Carr’s FCC has absolutely zero authority over this transaction because it doesn’t involve any of the companies he actually regulates or the transfer of any broadcast licenses. Two, Carr has an absolutely  record on competition issues, having rubber stamped no limit of harmful consolidation in telecom and, more recently, <a href=\"https://www.techdirt.com/2025/08/28/gop-friendly-local-news-broadcasters-plan-more-harmful-mergers-after-trump-destroys-whats-left-of-media-consolidation-limits/\">local broadcast media</a>. </p><p>It would take a journalist covering Carr’s comments all of fifteen minutes to find a long, long list of examples where Carr rubber stamped a terrible merger and ignored literally all labor, competition, and market harms. He’s genuinely the  person anybody should be asking for their thoughts on market competition, but you’re going to be seeing a lot of him in the months to come.</p><p>It’s also worth noting that of the available paths forward from this point, a Netflix acquisition of Warner Brothers is probably <a href=\"https://www.techdirt.com/2026/01/15/trump-ellison-wage-war-on-woke-netflix-in-effort-to-scuttle-warner-brothers-deal-dominate-u-s-media/\">the best of a bunch of bad options</a>. Ideally you’d block new consolidation in media, but that’s not happening with Trump’s disemboweled and captured regulators. As such, a Netflix acquisition is a better option than letting Larry Ellison create a right wing agitprop empire on the back of CNN, TikTok, and CBS. </p><p>Quick refresher: Warner Brothers rejected Ellison’s higher $108 billion offer for Netflix, citing Saudi money involvement and dodgy financial math as something that might make approval more difficult. When that failed, Ellison&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.techdirt.com/2025/12/08/paramount-with-jared-kushner-and-saudi-help-launches-108-billion-hostile-takeover-bid-for-warner-brothers/\">attempted a hostile takeover attempt</a>&nbsp;with the help of the president’s son in law and the Saudis. When&nbsp;didn’t work, Ellison&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/business-news/david-ellison-warner-bros-court-paramount-netflix-1236470908/\">tried to sue Warner Brothers</a>.</p><p>When  didn’t work, Ellison and friends shifted their attention to trying to <a href=\"https://www.techdirt.com/2026/01/15/trump-ellison-wage-war-on-woke-netflix-in-effort-to-scuttle-warner-brothers-deal-dominate-u-s-media/\">smear the “woke” Netflix deal in the media</a>. Enter Carr, who is a useful idiot Trump and Ellison can use to prop the DOJ’s inevitable scuttling of the Netflix deal as a matter of <em>serious policy in the defense of the public interest</em>, before offloading Warner Brothers (and CNN, and HBO) to one of Trump’s top right wing billionaire donors.</p><p>Trumpism has long tried to pretend that it <a href=\"https://www.techdirt.com/2024/07/18/just-a-reminder-authoritarians-dont-actually-support-antitrust-reform/\">cares about populist antitrust reform</a> and reining in corporate power, but it’s always been a lie propped up by a broad variety of useful idiots; some of whom are purported experts on the subject (<a href=\"https://www.techdirt.com/2025/07/21/trump-2-0-support-for-lina-khan-style-antitrust-reform-wound-up-being-an-unsurprising-lie/\">see: Matt Stoller</a>), and many of which are major corporate media institutions whose journalism has been eroded by the relentless pursuit of consolidation.</p><p>Neither <a href=\"https://variety.com/2026/tv/news/fcc-chairman-competition-concerns-netflix-warner-bros-deal-1236639469/\">Variety</a>, nor <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-01-23/fcc-chief-sees-competition-concerns-in-netflix-warner-deal\">Bloomberg</a>, for example, can be bothered to mention Carr’s decade-long history of rubber stamping harmful consolidation across media and telecom. Kind of important if you’re going to profile a major government figure’s thoughts on competition, yes? </p><p>I’d be prepared for a fake Trump DOJ antitrust inquiry in the coming months, designed to transfer ownership of Warner Brothers to Larry Ellison and Skydance/CBS. Propped up, in turn, by the usual assortment of bad faith bullshitters pretending this is a public interest effort. Should that fail, Trump’s <a href=\"https://www.kbtx.com/2026/01/19/trump-purchased-up-51-million-bonds-end-2025-including-netflix-warner-bros-investments/\">investing in Netflix and Warner Brothers</a> so he’s certain to come out on top either way. </p><p>In all outcome the public, markets, and labor likely lose due to consolidation. But some of the paths are less harmful to the public interest, and democracy itself, than others. </p>","contentLength":4197,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Building Agentic AI systems with AWS Serverless • Uma Ramadoss • GOTO 2025","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAcyi2BGwMo","date":1769605288,"author":"GOTO Conferences","guid":425303,"unread":true,"content":"<article>This presentation was recorded at GOTO Serverless 2025. #GOTOcon #GOTOserverless\nhttps://conferences.gotopia.tech/goto-serverless-bengaluru-2025\n\nUma Ramadoss - Principal Solutions Architect at AWS\n\nRESOURCES\nhttps://twitter.com/uma_ramadoss\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/in/uma-r-96578910\nhttps://serverlessland.com/explore/devdaynyc\nhttps://aws-experience.com/apj/smb/e/2dafa/getting-started-with-serverless-using-amazon-q\nhttps://aws-experience.com/amer/smb/events/series/serverless-gen-ai\n\nABSTRACT\nAgentic AI is transforming enterprise applications but building them is not just about prompt engineering and model selection.

The hype has gone so far that some users are buying Mac Minis just to host the agent full-time, even as its creator warns that's unnecessary. Business Insider reports: Founded by [creator Peter Steinberger], it's an AI agent that manages \"digital life,\" from emails to home automation. Steinberger previously founded PSPDFKit. In a key distinction from ChatGPT and many other popular AI products, the agent is open source and runs locally on your computer. Users then connect the agent to a messaging app like WhatsApp or Telegram, where they can give it instructions via text.\n \nThe AI agent was initially named after the \"little monster\" that appears when you restart Claude Code, Steinberger said on the \"Insecure Agents\" podcast. He formed the tool around the question: \"Why don't I have an agent that can look over my agents?\" [...] It runs locally on your computer 24/7. That's led some people to brush off their old laptops. \"Installed it experimentally on my old dusty Intel MacBook Pro,\" one product designer wrote. \"That machine finally has a purpose again.\"\n \nOthers are buying up Mac Minis, Apple's 5\"-by-5\" computer, to run the AI. Logan Kilpatrick, a product manager for Google DeepMind, posted: \"Mac mini ordered.\" It could give a sales boost to Apple, some X users have pointed out -- and online searches for \"Mac Mini\" jumped in the last 4 days in the US, per Google Trends. But Steinberger said buying a new computer just to run the AI isn't necessary. \"Please don't buy a Mac Mini,\" he wrote. \"You can deploy this on Amazon's Free Tier.\"","contentLength":1774,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Skipping App Store Fees Isn’t Always the Revenue Win It Seems","url":"https://hackernoon.com/skipping-app-store-fees-isnt-always-the-revenue-win-it-seems?source=rss","date":1769604304,"author":"Dan Layfield","guid":425452,"unread":true,"content":"<p>You can now save the 30% app store fee and let your users pay you directly.</p><p>This seems like a no-brainer. 30% more profit for a simple change?

People argue about it for hours, write thread after thread, and treat it as the answer to every quality problem. This is a dramatic shift from 2024 or even early 2025, when the term was barely known. Now everyone knows evaluation matters. Everyone wants to “.“</p><p>But now they’re lost. There’s so much noise coming from all directions, with everyone using the term for completely different things. Some (might we say, most) people think “evals” means prompting AI models to judge other AI models, building a dashboard of them that will magically solve their quality problems. They don’t understand that what they actually need is a process, one that’s far more nuanced and comprehensive than spinning up a few automated graders.</p><p>We’ve started to really hate the term. It’s bringing more confusion than clarity. Evals are only important in the context of product quality, and product quality is a process. It’s the ongoing discipline of deciding what “good” means for your product, measuring it in the right ways at the right times, learning where it breaks in the real world, and repeatedly closing the loop with fixes that stick.</p><p>We recently talked about this on <a href=\"https://youtu.be/z7T1pCxgvlA?si=wpFGuurnmdNpNUOc&amp;t=2001\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"></a>, and so many people reached out saying they related to the confusion, that they’d been struggling with the same questions. That’s why we’re writing this post.</p><p>Here’s what this article is going to do: explain the entire system you need to build for AI product quality, without using the word “evals.” (We’ll try our best. :p)</p><p>The status quo for shipping any reliable product requires ensuring three things:</p><ul><li>: A way to estimate how it behaves while you’re still developing it, before any customer sees it</li><li>: Signals for how it’s actually performing once real customers are using it</li><li>: A reliable feedback loop that lets you find problems, fix them, and get better over time</li></ul><p>This article is about how to ensure these three things in the context of AI products: why AI is different from traditional software, and what you need to build instead.</p><h2><strong>Why Traditional Testing Breaks</strong></h2><p>In traditional software, testing handles all three things we just described.</p><p>Think about booking a hotel on Booking.com. You select your dates from a calendar. You pick a city from a dropdown. You filter by price range, star rating, and amenities. At every step, you’re clicking on predefined options. The system knows exactly what inputs to expect, and the engineers can anticipate almost every path you might take. If you click the ”search” button with valid dates and a valid city, the system returns hotels. The behavior is predictable.</p><p>This predictability means testing covers everything:</p><ul><li> You write unit tests and integration tests before launch to verify behavior.</li><li> You monitor production for errors and exceptions. When something breaks, you get a stack trace that tells you exactly what went wrong.</li><li> It’s almost automatic. You write a new test, fix the bug, and ship. When you fix something, it stays fixed. Find issue, fix issue, move on.</li></ul><p>Now imagine the same task, but through a chat interface: ”I need a pet-friendly hotel in Austin for next weekend, under $200, close to downtown but not too noisy.”</p><p>The problem becomes much more complex. And the traditional testing approach falls apart.</p><p>The way users interact with the system can’t be anticipated upfront. There’s no dropdown constraining what they type. They can phrase their request however they want, include context you didn’t expect, or ask for things your system was never designed to handle. You can’t write test cases for inputs you can’t predict.</p><p>And because there’s an AI model at the center of this, the outputs are nondeterministic. The model is probabilistic. You can’t assert that a specific input will always produce a specific output. There’s no single ”correct answer” to check against.</p><p>On top of that, the process itself is a black box. With traditional software, you can trace exactly why an output was produced. You wrote the code; you know the logic. With an LLM, you can’t. You feed in a prompt, something happens inside the model, and you get a response. If it’s wrong, you don’t get a stack trace. You get a confident-sounding answer that might be subtly or completely incorrect.</p><p>This is the core challenge: AI products have a much larger surface area of user input that you can’t predict upfront, processed by a nondeterministic system that can produce outputs you never anticipated, through a process you can’t fully inspect</p><p>The traditional feedback loop breaks down. You can’t estimate behavior during development because you can’t anticipate all the inputs. You can’t easily catch issues in production because there’s no clear error signal, just a response that might be wrong. And you can’t reliably improve because the thing you fix might not stay fixed when the input changes slightly.</p><p>Whatever you tested before launch was based on behavior you anticipated. And that anticipated behavior can’t be guaranteed once real users arrive.</p><p>This is why we need a different approach to determining quality for AI products. The testing paradigm that works for clicking through Booking.com doesn’t transfer to chatting with an AI. You need something different.</p><p>So we’ve established that AI products are fundamentally harder to test than traditional software. The inputs are unpredictable, the outputs are nondeterministic, and the process is opaque. This is why we need dedicated approaches to measuring quality.</p><p>But there’s another layer of complexity that causes confusion: the distinction between assessing the model and assessing the product.</p><p>Foundation AI models are judged for quality by the companies that build them. OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google all run their models through extensive testing before release. They measure how well the model performs on coding tasks, reasoning problems, factual questions, and dozens of other capabilities. They give the model a set of inputs, check whether it produces expected outputs or takes expected actions, and use that to assess quality.</p><p>This is where benchmarks come from. You’ve probably seen them: LMArena, MMLU scores, HumanEval results. Model providers publish these numbers to show how their model stacks up. “We’re #1 on this benchmark” is a common marketing claim.</p><p>These scores represent real testing. The model was given specific tasks and its performance was measured. But here’s the thing: These scores have limited use for people building products. Model companies are racing toward capability parity. The gaps between top models are shrinking. What you actually need to know is whether the model will work for your specific product and produce good quality responses in your context.</p><p>There are two distinct layers here:</p><p>. This is the foundation model itself: GPT, Claude, Gemini, or whatever you’re building on. It has general capabilities that have been tested by its creators. It can reason, write code, answer questions, follow instructions. The benchmarks measure these general capabilities.</p><p>. This is your application, the thing you’re actually shipping to users. A customer support bot. A booking assistant. Your product is built on top of a foundation model, but it’s not the same thing. It has specific requirements, specific users, and specific definitions of success. It integrates with your tools, operates under your constraints, and handles use cases the benchmark creators never anticipated. Your product lives in a custom ecosystem that no model provider could possibly simulate.</p><p>Benchmark scores tell you what a model can do in general. They don’t tell you whether it works for your product.</p><p>The model layer has already been assessed by someone else. Your job is to assess the product layer: against your specific requirements, your specific users, your specific definition of success.</p><p>We bring this up because so many people obsess over model performance benchmarks. They spend weeks comparing leaderboards, trying to find the “best” model, and end up in “model selection hell.” The truth is, you need to pick something reasonable and build your own quality assessment framework. You cannot heavily rely on provider benchmarks to tell you what works for your product.</p><p>So you need to assess your product’s quality. Against what, exactly?</p><p>Three things work together:</p><p>: Real inputs paired with known-good outputs. If a user asks, “What’s your return policy?“ what should the system say? You need concrete examples of questions and acceptable answers. These become your ground truth, the standard you’re measuring against.</p><p>Start with 10–50 high-quality examples that cover your most important scenarios. A small set of carefully chosen examples beats a large set of sloppy ones. You can expand later as you learn what actually matters in practice.</p><p>This is really just product intuition. You’re thinking: What does my product support? How would users interact with it? What user personas exist? How should my ideal product behave? You’re designing the experience and gathering a reference for what “good“ looks like.</p><p>: Once you have reference examples, you need to think about how to measure quality. What dimensions matter? This is also product intuition. These dimensions are your metrics. Usually, if you’ve built out your reference example dataset very well, they should give you an overview of what metrics to look into based on the behavior that you want to see. Metrics essentially are dimensions that you want to focus on to assess quality. An example of a dimension could be, say, helpfulness.</p><p>: What does “good“ actually mean for each metric? This is a step that often gets skipped. It’s common to say “we’re measuring helpfulness“ without defining what helpful means in context. Here’s the thing: Helpfulness for a customer support bot is different from helpfulness for a legal assistant. A helpful support bot should be concise, solve the problem quickly, and escalate at the right time. A helpful legal assistant should be thorough and explain all the nuances. A rubric makes this explicit. It’s the instructions that your metric hinges on. You need this documented so everyone knows what they’re actually measuring. Sometimes if metrics are more objective in nature—for instance, “Was a correct JSON retrieved?“ or “Was a particular tool called done correctly?”—you don’t need rubrics at all. Subjective metrics are the ones that you generally need rubrics for, so keep that in mind.</p><p>For example, a customer support bot might define helpfulness like this:</p><ul><li>: Resolves the issue completely in one response, uses clear language, offers next steps if relevant</li><li>: Answers the question but requires follow-up or includes unnecessary information</li><li>: Misunderstands the question, gives irrelevant information, or fails to address the core issue</li></ul><p>To summarize, you have expected behavior from the user, expected behavior from the system (your reference examples), metrics (the dimensions you’re assessing), and rubrics (how you define those metrics). A metric like “helpfulness“ is just a word and means nothing unless it’s grounded by the rubric. All of this gets documented, which helps you start judging offline quality before you ever go into production.</p><p>You’ve defined what you’re measuring against. Now, how do you actually measure it?</p><p>There are three approaches, and all of them have their place.</p><p>: Deterministic rules that can be verified programmatically. Did the response include a required disclaimer? Is it under the word limit? Did it return valid JSON? Did it refuse to answer when it should have? These checks are simple, fast, cheap, and reliable. They won’t catch everything, but they catch the straightforward stuff. You should always start here.</p><p>: Using one model to grade another. You provide a rubric and ask the model to score responses. This scales better than human review and can assess subjective qualities like tone or helpfulness.</p><p>But there’s a risk. An LLM judge that hasn’t been calibrated against human judgment can lead you astray. It might consistently rate things wrong. It might have blind spots that match the blind spots of the model you’re grading. If your judge doesn’t agree with humans on what “good“ looks like, you’re optimizing for the wrong thing. Calibration against human judgment is super critical.</p><p>: The gold standard. Humans assess quality directly, either through expert review or user feedback. It’s slow and expensive and doesn’t scale. But it’s necessary. You need human judgment to calibrate your LLM judges, to catch things automated checks miss, and to make final calls on high-stakes decisions.</p><p>The right approach: Start with code-based checks for everything you can automate. Add LLM judges carefully, with extensive calibration. Reserve human review for where it matters most.</p><p>One important note: When you’re first building your reference examples, have humans do the grading. Don’t jump straight to LLM judges. LLM judges are notorious for being miscalibrated, and you need a human baseline to calibrate against. Get humans to judge first, understand what “good“ looks like from their perspective, and then use that to calibrate your automated judges. Calibrating LLM judges is a whole other blog post. We won’t dig into it here. But this is a nice <a href=\"https://arize.com/docs/phoenix/cookbook/prompt-engineering/llm-as-a-judge-prompt-optimization\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">guide</a> from Arize to help you get started.</p><h2><strong>Production Surprises You (and Humbles You)</strong></h2><p>Let’s say you’re building a customer support bot. You’ve built your reference dataset with 50 (or 100 or 200—whatever that number is, this still applies) example conversations. You’ve defined metrics for helpfulness, accuracy, and appropriate escalation. You’ve set up code checks for response length and required disclaimers, calibrated an LLM judge against human ratings, and run human review on the tricky cases. Your offline quality looks solid. You ship. Then real users show up. Here are just some examples of emerging behaviors you might see. The real world is a lot more nuanced.</p><ul><li><strong>Your reference examples don’t cover what users actually ask.</strong> You anticipated questions about return policies, shipping times, and order status. But users ask about things you didn’t include: “Can I return this if my dog chewed on the box?“ or “My package says delivered but I never got it, and also I’m moving next week.“ They combine multiple issues in one message. They reference previous conversations. They phrase things in ways your reference examples never captured.</li><li><strong>Users find scenarios you missed.</strong> Maybe your bot handles refund requests well but struggles when users ask about partial refunds on bundled items. Maybe it works fine in English but breaks when users mix in Spanish. No matter how thorough your prelaunch testing, real users will find gaps.</li><li><strong>User behavior shifts over time.</strong> The questions you get in month one don’t look like the questions you get in month six. Users learn what the bot can and can’t do. They develop workarounds. They find new use cases. Your reference examples were a snapshot of expected behavior, but expected behavior changes.</li></ul><p>And then there’s scale. If you’re handling 5,000 conversations a day with a 95% success rate, that’s still 250 failures every day. You can’t manually review everything.</p><p>This is the gap between offline and online quality. Your offline assessment gave you confidence to ship. It told you the system worked on the examples you anticipated. But online quality is about what happens with real users, real scale, and real unpredictability. The work of figuring out what’s actually breaking and fixing it starts the moment real users arrive.</p><p>This is where you realize a few things (a.k.a. lessons):</p><p><strong>Lesson 1: Production will surprise you regardless of your best efforts.</strong> You can build metrics and measure them before deployment, but it’s almost impossible to think of all cases. You’re bound to be surprised in production.</p><p><strong>Lesson 2: Your metrics might need updates. They’re not “once done and throw.“ You might need to update rubrics or add entirely new metrics.</strong> Since your predeployment metrics might not capture all kinds of issues, you need to rely on online implicit and explicit signals too: Did the user show frustration? Did they drop off the call? Did they leave a thumbs down? These signals help you sample bad experiences so you can make fixes. And if needed, you can implement new metrics to track how a dimension is doing. Maybe you didn’t have a metric for handling out-of-scope requests. Maybe escalation accuracy should be a new metric.</p><p>Over time, you also realize that some metrics become less useful because user behavior has changed. This is where the flywheel becomes important.</p><p>This is the part most people miss and pay least attention to but you should be paying the  attention to. Measuring quality isn’t a phase you complete before launch. It’s not a gate you pass through once. It’s an engine that runs continuously, for the entire life of your product.</p><p> You can’t review everything, so you sample intelligently. Flag conversations that look unusual: long exchanges, repeated questions, user frustration signals, low confidence scores. These are the interactions worth examining.</p><p><strong>Discover new failure modes.</strong> When you review flagged interactions, you find problems your prelaunch testing missed. Maybe users are asking about a topic you didn’t anticipate. Maybe the system handles a certain phrasing poorly. These are new failure modes, gaps in your understanding of what can go wrong.</p><p><strong>Update your metrics and reference data.</strong> Every new failure mode becomes a new thing to measure. You can either fix the issue and move on, or if you have a sense that the issue needs to be monitored for future interactions, add a new metric or a set of rubrics to an existing metric. Add examples to your reference dataset. Your quality system gets smarter because production taught you what to look for.</p><p><strong>Ship improvements and repeat.</strong> Fix the issues, push the changes, and start monitoring again. The cycle continues.</p><p>This is the flywheel: Production informs quality measurement, quality measurement guides improvement, improvement changes production, and production reveals new gaps. It keeps running.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. (Until your product reaches a convergence point. How often you need to run it depends on your online signals: Are users satisfied, or are there anomalies?)</p><p><strong>And your metrics have a lifecycle.</strong></p><p>Not all metrics serve the same purpose:</p><p> (borrowing the term from <a href=\"https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/demystifying-evals-for-ai-agents\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Anthropic’s blog</a>) measure things you’re actively trying to improve. They should start at a low pass rate (maybe 40%, maybe 60%). These are the hills you’re climbing. If a capability metric is already at 95%, it’s not telling you where to focus.</p><p> (again borrowing the term from <a href=\"https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/demystifying-evals-for-ai-agents\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Anthropic’s blog</a>) protect what you’ve already achieved. These should be near 100%. If a regression metric drops, something broke. You need to investigate immediately. As you improve on capability metrics, the things you’ve mastered become regression metrics.</p><p> have stopped giving you signal. They’re always green. They’re no longer informing decisions. When a metric saturates, run it less frequently or retire it entirely. It’s noise, not signal.</p><p>Metrics should be born when you discover new failure modes, evolve as you improve, and eventually be retired when they’ve served their purpose. <strong>A static set of metrics that never changes is a sign that your quality system has stagnated.</strong></p><p>As promised, we made it through without using the word “evals.“ Hopefully this gives a glimpse into the lifecycle: assessing quality before deployment, deploying with the right level of confidence, connecting production signals to metrics, and building a flywheel.</p><p>Now, the issue with the word “evals“ is that people use it for all sorts of things:</p><ul><li>“We should build evals“ → Usually means “we should write LLM judges“ (useless if not calibrated and not part of the flywheel).</li><li>“Evals are dead; A/B testing is key“ → This is part of the flywheel. Some companies overindex on online signals and fix issues without many offline metrics. Might or might not make sense based on product.</li><li>“How are GPT-5.2 evals looking?“ → These are model benchmarks, often not useful for product builders.</li><li>“How many evals do you have?“ → Might refer to data samples, metrics… We don’t know what.</li></ul><p>Here’s the deal: Everything we walked through (distinguishing model from product, building reference examples and rubrics, measuring with code and LLM judges and humans, monitoring production, running the continuous improvement flywheel, managing the lifecycle of your metrics) is what “evals“ should mean. But we don’t think one term should carry so much weight. We don’t want to use the term anymore. We want to point to different parts in the flywheel and have a fruitful conversation instead.</p><p>And that’s why <strong>evals are not all you need</strong>. It’s a larger data science and monitoring problem. Think of quality assessment as an ongoing discipline, not a checklist item.</p><p>We could have titled this article “Evals Are All You Need.“ But depending on your definition, that might not get you to read this article, because you think you already know what evals are. And it might be just a piece. If you’ve read this far, you understand why.</p><p> Build the flywheel, not the checkbox. Not the dashboard.

The act places limits on the disclosure of health information but does not cover all data held by health agencies and does not apply equally across all government departments.</p><p>Still, the act was put in place “to build trust in the US health system so people will seek care when they need it,” Howard said. “Eroding this trust can cause public health problems if we have sick or injured people that forgo seeking care.”</p><p>He urged the US Congress to act. “If circumstances arise where a law is applied in a manner that is counter to the public policy purpose intended by Congress, it is the responsibility of our lawmakers to step in and provide direction and corrections needed to account for the change,” he said. “If our leaders are not willing to do this an erosion in the trust of our entire legal system could result. I do not think this is something anyone wants.”</p><p>Dave Maass, director of investigations at the non-profit organisation Electronic Frontier Foundation, said, “In the wake of the Watergate and COINTELPRO scandals of the 1970s, US Congress enacted laws to protect private information from government misuse. Data grabs like the DHS’s reported use of healthcare data for immigration enforcement are exactly why.”</p><p>“Government agencies necessarily collect information to provide essential services, but when governments begin pooling data and using it for purposes unrelated to why it was originally collected, it provides them with enormous power that can be abused. The misuse of healthcare data is particularly insidious,” Maass told . </p><p>“This information is not only extremely sensitive, but its misuse for law enforcement purposes could also deter people from seeking essential medical care—with grave individual and collective consequences.”</p><div><p><strong>Do you have any additional information on this story? </strong></p></div></div>","contentLength":5837,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46794365"},{"title":"Modeling Urban Walking Risk Using Spatial-Temporal Machine Learning","url":"https://towardsdatascience.com/modeling-urban-walking-risk-using-spatial-temporal-machine-learning/","date":1769601600,"author":"Aneesh Patil","guid":425272,"unread":true,"content":"<p>Estimating neighborhood-level pedestrian risk from real-world incident data</p>","contentLength":75,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Mesa NVK Driver Temporarily Disabling Support For Larger Pages Due To Bug","url":"https://www.phoronix.com/news/Mesa-Disable-NVK-Large-Page","date":1769598981,"author":"Michael Larabel","guid":425271,"unread":true,"content":"<article>Upstreamed to the Nouveau open-source kernel driver in Linux 6.19 was support for larger pages and with that compression support available with the larger page sizes.

You browse options, compare prices, select your seat, and book, all without leaving the conversation.</p><p>Instead of responding with text and sending you elsewhere, ChatGPT can now surface interactive widgets from third-party apps directly in your conversation.

You’d describe your API endpoints, and ChatGPT would call them and return text. The problem was that everything came back as text that ChatGPT had to interpret and re-present to the user. There was no native UI, no interactivity, and no way to create rich experiences.</p><p>They allow users to upload content and shape their conversations, but are difficult to share broadly and don’t give brands control over how they’ll appear in chats.</p><p>ChatGPT Apps take a fundamentally different approach.</p><p>Instead of just calling APIs and returning text, Apps can render full interactive widgets directly in the conversation. You can show a map, display a booking form, or let users interact with a spreadsheet.</p><p>Here’s how the three approaches compare:</p><p>The key insight is that Apps aren’t just “GPTs with UI”; they’re a different architecture entirely.</p><p>The widget runs in a sandboxed iframe with its own state, its own event handling, and direct communication with your backend. ChatGPT orchestrates when to show your app, but once it’s rendered, users interact with your UI directly.</p><blockquote><p>Here’s the simplest way to think about it: a chatbot talks, but an app does.</p></blockquote><p>Ask ChatGPT to book a restaurant, and normally, it explains how. It lists options, gives links, and tells you what to search for. Helpful, but nothing actually changes in the world.</p><p>Now ask ChatGPT with a restaurant app installed, and something different happens.</p><p>An interactive widget appears right in the chat. You can see real availability, browse the menu, pick a time, and confirm your reservation. When you’re done, you have an actual booking, not just information about how to make one.</p><p>Here’s exactly what that would look like:</p><p>The launch partners tell you a lot about where OpenAI sees this going: Booking.com, Canva, Coursera, Expedia, Figma, Spotify, and Zillow.</p><blockquote><p>Users install apps through: <strong>Settings &gt; Apps &amp; Connectors</strong>.</p></blockquote><p>Once installed, ChatGPT can automatically surface your app based on conversation context, or users can tag it manually.</p><p>Before we get into the technical details, it’s worth thinking about what kinds of apps work well in this model.</p><p>ChatGPT apps should be quick and conversational. The goal is not to export your entire web app to ChatGPT. OpenAI says that apps should <a href=\"https://developers.openai.com/blog/what-makes-a-great-chatgpt-app\">show, do, or know</a> something that ChatGPT doesn’t. For example, ChatGPT can’t deliver groceries to your house, but the Instacart app with ChatGPT can.</p><p>Now let’s look at how this all works under the hood.</p><p>Every ChatGPT App is built from three parts that work together:</p><p>The first is the, which is your backend. It tells ChatGPT what your app can do by defining “tools” (functions the model can call) and “resources” (UI templates to render).</p><p>MCP stands for Model Context Protocol, an open standard that Anthropic created and OpenAI has now adopted.</p><p>The second component is the, which is your frontend. It’s HTML that runs on ChatGPT in a sandboxed iframe.</p><p>The third is , which acts as the host. It decides when to call your tools, renders your widgets, and manages the conversation state.</p><p>Let’s look at each component in detail:</p><p>The MCP Server is your backend—it’s where you define what your app can actually do.</p><blockquote><p>It exposes two main things to ChatGPT: tools and resources.</p></blockquote><p> are actions that ChatGPT can call.</p><p>Each tool has a name (like ), a description that helps ChatGPT decide when to use it, an input schema defining which parameters are required, and an output template specifying which UI resource to render the results in.</p><p> are UI templates that ChatGPT renders when tools return data.</p><p>They’re served as HTML bundles (typically React apps compiled to a single file) and rendered inside a sandboxed iframe.</p><p>Here’s what a tool definition might look like for our restaurant finder:</p><pre><code>Tool: search_restaurants\n\nDescription: “Find restaurants by location and cuisine type”\n\nInputs: location (required), cuisine (optional), price_range (optional)\n\nOutput: → ui://widget/restaurant-list.html</code></pre><p>The description is especially important.</p><p>ChatGPT uses it to decide whether your tool is relevant to the user’s request. If your description is vague—like “do restaurant stuff”—ChatGPT won’t know when to invoke it. Be specific about what the tool does and when it should be used.</p><p>Let’s trace what happens when you tell ChatGPT, “Find me Italian restaurants in Brooklyn”.</p><p>Understanding this flow is key to building apps that work well.</p><p>First, ChatGPT checks the available tools from all installed apps.</p><p>It sees your  tool with the description “Search for restaurants by location and cuisine type”. Based on the user’s message, it decides this tool is relevant.</p><p>Next, ChatGPT constructs a tool call:</p><pre><code>{\n\n  “name”: “search_restaurants”,\n\n  “parameters”: {\n\n    “location”: “Brooklyn”,\n    “cuisine”: “Italian”\n\n  }\n\n}</code></pre><p>Your MCP server receives this request, validates the parameters, queries your database (or an external API such as Yelp), and returns the results.</p><p>This includes a reference to your UI template if you have one.</p><pre><code>return {\n\n  content: [\n\n    { type: “text”, text: “Found 12 Italian restaurants in Brooklyn” }\n\n  ],\n\n  structuredContent: {\n\n    restaurants: results\n\n  },\n\n  _meta: {\n\n    “openai/outputTemplate”: “ui://widget/restaurant-list.html”\n\n  }\n\n};</code></pre><ul><li><p>The  field is for ChatGPT. It’s a text summary, so the model knows what happened and can respond intelligently.</p></li><li><p>The  field is for your widget, containing the raw data your UI will display.</p></li><li><p>And the  in  tells ChatGPT to fetch and render your widget HTML.</p></li></ul><p>Finally, ChatGPT fetches your HTML bundle, renders it in a sandboxed iframe, and injects your  via a JavaScript bridge. The user sees an interactive list of restaurants right in their chat.</p><p>The Widget is your frontend widget.</p><p>When your widget loads, ChatGPT injects an  object that gives you access to data and methods for interacting with the system.</p><p>Here’s what you can do with :</p><ul><li><p> — The data returned from your tool call</p></li><li><p> — The parameters that were passed to your tool</p></li><li><p> — Any persisted UI state</p></li><li><p> — Whether the user is in light or dark mode</p></li><li><p> — The user’s locale (e.g., “en-US”)</p></li></ul><ul><li><p> — Call another MCP tool directly</p></li><li><p> — Persist UI state</p></li><li><p> — Send a message back to ChatGPT</p></li><li><p> — Switch between inline, full screen, or picture-in-picture</p></li><li><p> — Open an external URL</p></li></ul><p>This is what makes Apps fundamentally different from Plugins.</p><p>Your widget can trigger new tool calls, save state, and continue the conversation. Users interact directly with your UI, not through ChatGPT’s text interface. When they click on a restaurant to see more details, you have two options for handling that interaction.</p><p>The first option is a .</p><p>Your widget can call tools directly using , which bypasses the model entirely. Your widget requests restaurant details, your server returns the data, and the widget updates immediately. This is fast and efficient for straightforward data fetching.</p><p>The second option is a .</p><p>Your widget can send a follow-up <code>window.openai.sendFollowUpMessage()</code>, which puts the model back in the loop. ChatGPT sees the message, decides what to do next, and might call additional tools or ask clarifying questions.</p><pre><code>// Direct tool call (model not involved)\n\nconst details = await window.openai.callTool(\n\n  ‘get_restaurant_details’,\n  { id: restaurant.id }\n\n);\n\n\n// Follow-up message (model decides next step)\n\nawait window.openai.sendFollowUpMessage({\n\n  prompt: `I want to book ${restaurant.name} for 4 people`\n\n});</code></pre><p>This creates a continuous loop that makes the whole experience feel seamless:</p><blockquote><p>The user speaks, ChatGPT calls a tool, the widget renders, the user interacts with the widget, the widget either calls another tool or sends a message, and the cycle continues.</p></blockquote><p>Widgets can appear in three different formats depending on what makes sense for your app.</p><p> widgets embed directly in the conversation flow. This is the default for all apps, and it works well for things like listings, search results, or quick selections.</p><p> mode takes over the entire viewport. This is better for maps, dashboards, or complex workflows where users need more space to work.</p><p> mode floats the widget while the user continues chatting. This is great for music players, timers, or other persistent tools that the user might want to keep visible while doing other things.</p><pre><code>window.openai.requestDisplayMode({ mode: “fullscreen” });\n\nwindow.openai.requestDisplayMode({ mode: “pip” });</code></pre><p>One constraint to keep in mind: <strong>you can only show one widget per message.</strong></p><p>If someone asks ChatGPT to “book a restaurant and order an Uber,” it will show one app at a time. Users work through these requests sequentially.</p><p>Now that we understand how the pieces fit together, let’s talk about security.</p><p>With four parties involved (ChatGPT, your MCP server, your widget, and external APIs), it’s important to understand where the trust boundaries lie.</p><p>ChatGPT calls your MCP server over HTTPS. Your server should validate that requests are actually coming from ChatGPT. ChatGPT trusts your server to return valid tool responses and UI resources.</p><p>The widget runs in a heavily sandboxed iframe. ChatGPT injects the  bridge, but the widget cannot access ChatGPT’s DOM, cookies, or any data from other apps. This is the strictest boundary.</p><p>Your widget can only make network requests to domains you’ve explicitly declared in your Content Security Policy () configuration. All other requests are blocked.</p><p>Each app’s widget runs in its own isolated sandbox. Apps cannot access each other’s data, state, or DOM. Even if a malicious app tried to extract data from another app, the browser’s same-origin policy prevents it.</p><p>Your widget runs under strict restrictions. It cannot:</p><ul><li><p>Access cookies (it’s on a sandbox origin, not your domain)</p></li><li><p>Use localStorage or sessionStorage</p></li><li><p>Access the parent DOM (ChatGPT’s interface)</p></li><li><p>Submit forms directly (use  instead)</p></li><li><p>Open popups (use  instead)</p></li><li><p>Make network requests except for declared CSP domains</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>Execute JavaScript normally</p></li><li><p>Fetch from CSP-allowed domains</p></li><li><p>Communicate through the  bridge</p></li><li><p>Store UI state via </p></li></ul><p>You declare your allowed connections in your tool’s :</p><pre><code>_meta: {\n\n  “openai/widgetCSP”: {\n\n    “connect_domains”: [”api.yourservice.com”],\n    “resource_domains”: [”cdn.yourservice.com”],\n    “frame_domains”: []  // Nested iframes trigger stricter review\n\n  }\n\n}</code></pre><blockquote><p>The key principle: external API calls should go through your MCP server, not the widget.</p></blockquote><p>Let your widget handle the UI and let your server handle the business logic and sensitive operations.</p><p>With the security model in mind, let’s look at how authentication works:</p><p>There are two separate concerns: authenticating that requests to your MCP server are coming from ChatGPT, and authenticating users to your service.</p><p>For authenticating users to your service (so they can access their own data), ChatGPT acts as an OAuth 2.1 client while your MCP server acts as the resource server.</p><p>PKCE and Dynamic Client Registration are requiredChatGPT registers with your identity provider at runtime, generating a unique  for each connection.</p><p>Discovery endpoints are also required.</p><p>Your MCP server needs to expose <code>/.well-known/oauth-protected-resource</code> (RFC 9728), and your IdP needs to expose either <code>/.well-known/oauth-authorization-server</code> (RFC 8414) or <code>/.well-known/openid-configuration</code>.</p><p>One important security detail: your widget never sees tokens directly.</p><p>All authentication flows go through the ChatGPT host, which keeps credentials out of the browser sandbox. Your MCP server validates tokens on every incoming request: fetch JWKS signing keys, verify the signature and issuer, check expiry and audience claims, and validate scopes.</p><p>If validation fails, return a 401 with a  header.</p><p>User sessions are scoped to the conversation.</p><p>If a user authenticates with your app in one conversation, they’ll need to re-authenticate in a new conversation. This is by design as it prevents credentials from leaking across contexts and gives users clear control over when they’re authenticated.</p><p>State in ChatGPT Apps exists in three tiers, each with different owners, lifetimes, and purposes. Understanding which tier to use for what is important for building apps that feel reliable.</p><p> is stored using  and is scoped to a specific message and widget pair. Use it for UI preferences, such as which tab is selected or how results are sorted.</p><p>One important detail: this state is visible to the model, so keep it under 4k tokens and never store sensitive data here.</p><pre><code>// Good: minimal UI state for preferences\n\nawait window.openai.setWidgetState({\n\n  selectedTab: “reviews”,\n  sortOrder: “rating”\n\n});\n\n\n// Bad: don’t store sensitive or large data here\n\nawait window.openai.setWidgetState({\n\n  userEmail: “...”,      // Never store credentials\n  allResults: [...]      // Too large\n\n});</code></pre><p> is maintained by ChatGPT.</p><p>The model remembers what’s happened in the conversation and uses that context when deciding what to do next. You don’t control this directly, but you influence it through the content field in your tool responses.</p><p> is anything you persist in your own database.</p><p>This is the only state that survives across conversations, devices, and time. If something matters long term, like a user’s saved preferences, booking history, or account data, store it in your backend.</p><p>If the user refreshes the page, the widget state persists (it’s stored by ChatGPT, not in browser storage). If the user switches devices mid-conversation, widget state is lost, but the conversation context remains.</p><p>If the user starts a new conversation, everything resets except the backend state.</p><p>Once you’ve built your app, you need to actually run it.</p><p>This section covers everything from error handling to deployment:</p><p>Things will go wrong. Networks fail, APIs time out, servers crash.</p><p>The good news is that errors cascade through the system in predictable ways, and ChatGPT has built-in fallbacks for most failure modes.</p><p>If your MCP server is unreachable,ChatGPT falls back to text and continues the conversation without your app.</p><p>The user might see something like “I wasn’t able to connect to the restaurant app, but I can help you find Italian restaurants in Brooklyn another way. Similarly, if your tool returns an error, ChatGPT explains what went wrong in natural language. Return clear error messages in your content field so ChatGPT can communicate the issue to users.</p><p>If an external API fails while your tool is running, try to return partial results or a useful error state rather than failing completely.</p><p>If you found 8 restaurants but couldn’t get ratings for 3 of them, return the 8 restaurants with partial data. Users generally prefer some information over none.</p><p>One important detail: ChatGPT may automatically retry failed tool calls, so make sure your handlers are . If a user clicks “book this restaurant” and the network hiccups, you don’t want to create two bookings when the retry succeeds.</p><p>If you’re concerned about overwhelming requests, there are <strong>three layers of rate limiting</strong> to think about:</p><p>First is ChatGPT’s loop detection, which prevents runaway tool calls.</p><p>If your app gets stuck calling the same tool repeatedly, ChatGPT will eventually stop. But this is a backstop, not a strategy. This means your server needs its own rate limiting. Implement per-user limits on tool calls and track costs for external API usage. If your app calls the Google Maps API on every tool invocation, and a user asks a vague question that triggers dozens of calls, you’ll see that in your bill.</p><p>You should also validate inputs and set limits on expensive operations.</p><p>Consider what happens if someone asks ChatGPT to “find every restaurant in New York.” That’s potentially millions of results. Your tool should have sensible defaults (e.g., return 20 results, not 20,000) and reject queries that would be prohibitively expensive.</p><p>A good pattern is to return early with a clarifying question: “I found over 10,000 Italian restaurants in New York. Can you narrow down the search to a specific neighborhood?”</p><p>Finally, we have privacy. Building apps that handle user data comes with responsibilities, and OpenAI’s guidelines are specific about what you can and cannot do.</p><p>First, you should collect only the minimum data needed to perform your tool’s function.</p><p>Your input schema should be narrowly scoped and clearly linked to the task (no “just in case” fields or broad profile data). The same applies to responses: return only what’s directly relevant to the user’s request. Don’t include diagnostic info, telemetry, session IDs, or logging metadata unless strictly necessary.</p><p>Some data types are off-limits entirely.You cannot collect, solicit, or process:</p><ul><li><p>Payment card information (PCI DSS data)</p></li><li><p>Protected health information (PHI)</p></li><li><p>Government identifiers (social security numbers, etc.)</p></li><li><p>Access credentials (API keys, passwords, MFA codes)</p></li></ul><p>For sensitive data categories (as defined by local regulations), you can only collect if it’s strictly necessary, the user has given adequate consent, and you’ve clearly disclosed the collection.</p><p>Any tool that posts messages, sends emails, uploads files, or otherwise moves data outside the current boundary must be marked as a write action. This surfaces it to ChatGPT so users can confirm before execution. Misrepresenting a write action as read-only is a common rejection reason.</p><p>If you’re building an app that might have users in regions with strong privacy regulations, you’re responsible for compliance.</p><p>Your OAuth consent screen should clearly explain what data your app accesses. Users should be able to request copies of their data and request deletion. Remember that ChatGPT Apps involve data flowing through multiple parties (user → ChatGPT → your MCP server → external APIs), so your privacy policy should explain this chain clearly.</p><p>Ready to build something?</p><p>There are a couple of good paths depending on how much control you want:</p><p> (<a href=\"https://chippy.build\">chippy.build</a>) is an AI agent trained on the Apps SDK (and built by me!). It can create MCP servers and widgets for you, includes built-in testing, and lets you connect to ChatGPT without dealing with deployment setup. This is probably the fastest way to get something running.</p><p> gives you more control. Import the official examples from https://github.com/openai/openai-apps-sdk-examples, then configure: bundle your React widgets with Vite (set  to your Replit domain), serve  with CORS on port 80, run your MCP server on port 8000 bound to , and allow all hosts.</p><p>Of course, you can also clone the official examples locally, set up an ngrok tunnel to your MCP endpoint, and connect directly.</p><p>In any case, you’ll need to enable Developer Mode in ChatGPT settings to connect. Once enabled, go to Settings &gt; Apps &amp; Connectors &gt; New App, enter your MCP URL, and test by mentioning your app by name in a new conversation.</p><p>Here’s the mental model of how everything fits together:</p><p>Your MCP server defines what your app can do through tools and resources. Your widget handles how it looks and how users interact with it. ChatGPT orchestrates the whole thing—deciding when to invoke your tools and rendering your widgets in the conversation.</p><p>The communication loop is what makes it feel seamless: user speaks → ChatGPT calls tool → widget renders → user interacts → cycle continues.</p><p>Security is enforced through sandboxing. Your widget can’t access cookies, storage, or arbitrary network requests. Everything flows through declared CSP domains or the  bridge.</p><p>State exists at three levels: widget state is per-message, conversation context is per-session, and backend state is persistent in your database.</p><p>Errors cascade predictably. ChatGPT falls back to text and explains what went wrong in natural language.</p><p>With 800 million weekly active users and the app directory just launched, this is the moment to start building. The companies that figure out how to create genuinely useful apps will capture significant distribution in this new channel.</p><p>👋 I’d like to thank  for writing this newsletter!</p><p>He’s also a popular Maven instructor and former healthtech product manager.</p><p>I launched  (newsletter series exclusive to PAID subscribers).</p><p>When you upgrade, you’ll get:</p><ul><li><p><strong>High-level architecture of real-world systems.</strong></p></li><li><p>Deep dive into how popular real-world systems actually work.</p></li><li><p><strong>How real-world systems handle scale, reliability, and performance.</strong></p></li><li><p>10x the results you currently get with 1/10th of your time, energy, and effort.</p></li></ul><p><strong>Want to reach 200K+ tech professionals at scale? </strong>📰</p><p>Thank you for supporting this newsletter.</p><p>You are now 200,001+ readers strong, very close to 201k.

This loads five drivers for five formats by importing their plugins: BMP, GIF,\nJPEG, PPM and PNG.</p><p>During import, each plugin\n<a href=\"https://github.com/python-pillow/Pillow/blob/12.1.0/src/PIL/GifImagePlugin.py#L1204-L1211\">registers</a>\nits file extensions, MIME types and some methods used for opening and saving.</p><p>Then we check each of these plugins in turn to see if one will accept the image. Most of\nPillow’s plugins detect an image by opening the file and checking if the first few bytes\nmatch a magic prefix. For example:</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://github.com/python-pillow/Pillow/blob/12.1.0/src/PIL/GifImagePlugin.py#L73-L74\">GIF</a>\nstarts with  or .</li><li><a href=\"https://github.com/python-pillow/Pillow/blob/12.1.0/src/PIL/JpegImagePlugin.py#L334-L336\">JPEG</a>\nstarts with , where  means “Start of Image”, and  is\nthe start of the next marker\n(<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JPEG#Syntax_and_structure\">reference</a>).</li></ul><p>If none of these five match, we call\n<a href=\"https://github.com/python-pillow/Pillow/blob/12.1.0/src/PIL/Image.py#L372-L396\"></a>,\nwhich imports the remaining 42 plugins. We then check each of these for a match.</p><p>This has been the case since at least\n<a href=\"https://github.com/hugovk/pil-svn.effbot.org/blame/master/PIL/Image.py#L290\">PIL 1.1.1</a>\nreleased in 2000 (this is the oldest version I have to check). There were 33 builtin\nplugins then and 47 now.</p><p>This is all a bit wasteful if we only need one or two image formats during a program’s\nlifetime, especially for things like CLIs. Longer running programs may need a few more,\nbut unlikely all 47.</p><p>A benefit of the plugin system is third parties can\n<a href=\"https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/handbook/third-party-plugins.html\">create their own plugins</a>,\nbut we can be more efficient with our builtins.</p><p>I opened a <a href=\"https://github.com/python-pillow/Pillow/pull/9398\">PR</a> to add a mapping of\nfile extensions to plugins. Before calling  or , we can instead do a\ncheap lookup, which may save us importing, registering, and checking all those plugins.</p><p>Of course, we may have an image without an extension, or with the “wrong” extension, but\nthat’s fine; I expect it’s rare and anyway we’ll fall back to the original \n-&gt;  flow.</p><p>After merging the PR, here’s a new flame graph for opening PNG\n(<a href=\"https://hugovk.dev/tags/python/flamegraph_27477.html\">HTML page</a>):</p><p>The flame graphs are scaled to the same width, but there’s far fewer boxes meaning\nthere’s much less work now. We’re down from 40 and 60 milliseconds to 20 and 20\nmilliseconds.</p><p>The PR has a bunch of benchmarks which show opening a PNG (that previously loaded five\nplugins) is now 2.6 times faster. Opening a WebP (that previously loaded all 47\nplugins), is now 14 times faster. Similarly, Saving PNG is improved by 2.2 times and\nWebP by 7.9 times. Success!

It means curious, but that is not the literal meaning. Like many German words, it comes from two parts: neu and gierig. Neu means new, and gierig means greedy. So the literal idea behind neugierig is being greedy for new things. That fits me well.</p><p>I really enjoy learning new things. That is why I read a lot, watch documentaries, and explore different topics. I am greedy for new information. This also includes what is happening around the world.</p><p>For years, I followed the news to keep an eye on what was happening in my country, in the world, and in the tech industry. I curated a list of sources that matched my taste, from international newspapers to YouTube channels, Reddit, and tech-focused websites. Every day, I checked these sources through their websites or my RSS reader to stay up to date.</p><p>At the end of last year, I had some time to reflect on my habits. I thought about what makes me happy, what makes me stressed, and how the things I do every day contribute to my goals.</p><p>When I looked at the time I spent reading the news and how I felt afterward, I realised it was not helping me at all. Most of the time, I felt more stressed than informed. I also noticed that almost every source focuses heavily on negative stories, simply because those attract more attention and clicks.</p><p>When it comes to world news, I started to see the same patterns repeating. A lot of headlines about political figures, conflicts far away, and problems I have no control over. I asked myself how much of this actually affects my daily life, and I could not come up with a good answer. Many things are happening in the world, but they rarely change anything in my day-to-day routine. That made me question why I was following them so closely.</p><p>The same applies to tech news. Most of it revolves around big personalities, constant AI updates, startups getting acquired, people becoming rich, hardware I will probably never buy, and rumours about products that may never be released. In most cases, none of this has any real impact on my life. New technologies are usually easy to learn when they become relevant, and it is hard to know which ones will still matter in a few years.</p><p>After thinking about whether I really need to follow the news, I decided that I do not. This does not mean I do not care about the world or the tech industry. I am just not interested in following daily updates that do not add much value to my life.</p><p>One thing I am still interested in is what is happening in my city. For that, I recently discovered a newsletter from Die Zeit called <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.zeit.de/serie/elbvertiefung\">Elbvertiefung</a>. Every weekday at 6 AM, they send a short newsletter about what happened in Hamburg, and sometimes they also recommend a book or a new restaurant or cafe. I start my day by reading it. Since it is in German, it also helps me improve my language skills.</p><p>For the rest of the news, I am considering subscribing to a magazine that covers important events in Germany, the EU, or the world every few months. This kind of format filters out short-term noise and fear-driven stories. These publications usually make money by selling the magazine rather than ads, so they tend to focus more on quality. (If you have any recommendations, feel free to <a href=\"https://mertbulan.com/contact\">reach out</a>.)</p><p>At the beginning of this year, I decided to stop following the news. As a result, I started reading more. Last year, I finished 20 books. This year, just in January, I finished 7 books. I still satisfy my curiosity and learn new things, but I just changed the medium.

The SCANNER port connects to a development headset; I don't have one.\n\n</p><p>This row of switches, SW1, is exposed on the bottom of the unit. The initial setting was: 1 off, 2 on, 3 on, 4 on, 5 off, 6 off, 7 off, 8 on.\n</p><p>\n7 and 8 control which display is shown: 8 controls the left, rendered in Virtual Boy red, 7 is the right, rendered in green. With both 7 and 8 on, left and right are combined, this was intended as <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anaglyph_3D\">anaglyph 3D</a>. See the <a href=\"https://hcs64.com/video-boy-vue/#captures\">video output</a> below.\n\n</p><p>Switching 5 on prevents anything from working. I didn't notice any effect from switching the others.\n\n</p><p>There's an image of the <a href=\"https://hcs64.com/video-boy-vue/#instructions\">instructions</a> which describes the switches, unfortunately it's low resolution. I think it says \"don't use\" for 5 and 6, and 1-4 are for setting some integer, \"1=MSB, 4=LSB, ON=0, OFF=1\".\n\n</p><p>There are nearby unpopulated jumper pads, and a set of pads marked \"CL\" which seem to be cut traces. This may have been hardwired when the switch wasn't installed.\n\n</p><p>The top label says \"プロジェ君 12号\", approximately \"Project No. 12\".\n\n</p><p>The bottom label says \"VUE TV MONITOR\", identifying the board inside. \"Ver. C\" indicates the third or fourth version, and \"+改造\" is \"plus retrofit\", perhaps indicating the various jumper wire patches. \"MAI-VUE-X8\" identifies the internal Virtual Boy main board.\n\n</p><p>The monitor board (left) has a Virtual Boy main board mounted on top of it (center top between the metal braces). The right side of the case is taken up by the power supply.\n\n</p><p>The Virtual Boy generates an image by sweeping a column of light horizontally. To convert this to the rows of a PAL TV signal, at least one frame must be buffered and rotated; the monitor board performs this conversion.\n\n</p><p>Note that the monitor board has unpopulated connector pads on the left (CN1, label not visible) and lower right (CN2). I think this same board can be configured to go into a VUE-DEBUGGER development unit (see <a href=\"https://hcs64.com/video-boy-vue/#palmonitor\">PAL monitor</a>), CN1 would be where it plugs into the debugger bus.\n\n</p><p>The main board is the heart of a Virtual Boy. This seems to be an early or development board, MAI-VUE-X8, (c) 1994. (A production board is VUE-MAI-01, (c) 1995.)\n\n</p><p>For info on Virtual Boy hardware:\n\n</p><p>Under the MAI-VUE-X8 board there are a few stray ICs and the ribbon cables that carry video to the monitor board (left and right). The board name was hiding under here: \"VUE TV MONITOR(C)\", which matches \"Ver. C\" on the label.\n\n</p><p>The workhorses are these two big Xilinx XC3064-70 <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field-programmable_gate_array\">FPGAs</a>, which get their configuration from the 1765DPC PROMs between them. Perhaps one stores input while the other scans output.\n\n</p><p>The big NEC chip on the left (D27C1024A-15) is a 1Mbit <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EPROM\">EPROM</a>, with an Intelligent Systems metal sticker to prevent UV erasure. I guess that at least one of the FPGAs is configured as a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_signal_processor\">DSP</a>, running a program from the EPROM.\n\n</p><p>There are eight 32KB <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_random-access_memory\">SRAMs</a> across the board, numbered in two groups: U12 &amp; U13 (64KB), and U17-U22 (192KB). The 64KB might be DSP work RAM. 192KB would exactly fit two 384x256 frames with 8 bits per pixel (384x256 is the size of the Virtual Boy <a href=\"https://files.virtual-boy.com/download/978651/stsvb.html#vip_frame_buffer\">framebuffer</a>, though only the top 224 rows are used). Virtual Boy graphics are only 2 bits per pixel, but each of the three non-black brightness levels can be <a href=\"https://files.virtual-boy.com/download/978651/stsvb.html#vip_brightness\">configured by an independent 8 bit register</a>, so 8 bits per pixel is plausible. This could be a double buffer (one taking input while the other scans output), or it could be one buffer per eye, or a double buffer for each eye at only 4 bits per pixel.\n\n</p><p>The <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crystal_oscillator\">oscillator</a> Y1 (left, below the EPROM) seems to be associated with a VCLK test point, probably Video Clock; it's labeled D177J4, which suggests the 17.734475 MHz PAL color subcarrier. There's an unpopulated space for a second oscillator, Y2, and support components; it's grouped with the SCLK test point, maybe the Servo Clock. This may have be used when the board was configured to plug into the VUE-DEBUGGER.\n\n</p><p>Output is produced here by two MB40778 8-bit <a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital-to-analog_converter\">DACs</a> (bottom center), an <a href=\"https://console5.com/wiki/BA6596F\">S-RGB</a> video encoder (center right), and numerous discrete components. On the left are the output connectors: CN10 at top is RGB, CN8 at bottom is AV multi-out. I guess that each DAC handles one channel, connected to the red and green inputs of the S-RGB.\n\n</p><ul><li>U6, U16: Xilinx 1765DPC - FPGA config PROM\n  </li><li>U9, U23: Xilinx XC3064-70 PC132C - FPGA\n  </li><li>U10, U11: Fujitsu MB40778 - 8-Bit D/A Converter\n  </li><li>U12, U13, U17-U22: Toshiba TC55328AP-20 - 32KB SRAM\n  </li><li>U14: NEC D27C1024A-15 - 1Mbit UV EPROM\n  </li><li>U15: Nintendo S-RGB - Video signal encoder (as seen on some SNES models)\n</li></ul><ul><li>U1, U5: SN74LS244N - Oct Buffer</li><li>U2, U3, U4: SN74LS245N - Oct Transceiver</li><li>U7: 74HC14AP - Hex Schmitt Inverter</li><li>U8: SN74LS07N - Hex Buffers And Drivers</li><li>U25: 74HCU04AP - Hex Unbuffered Inverter</li><li>U29 AMP (is this the missing U24?)</li></ul><p>There are three jumpers on the bottom, and one that goes to (and through) the Virtual Boy board, strategically glued. Version C might have still needed a few fixes, or maybe these are used to retrofit a particular MAI-VUE board, or they could be specific to the standalone Video Boy configuration.\n\n</p><p>These images of Virtual Boy Wario Land come through an Elgato dongle, deinterlaced with ffmpeg filter .\n\n</p><div><a href=\"https://hcs64.com/video-boy-vue/images/wario_red.png\"><img src=\"https://hcs64.com/video-boy-vue/images/wario_red.png\"></a><a href=\"https://hcs64.com/video-boy-vue/images/wario_both.png\"><img src=\"https://hcs64.com/video-boy-vue/images/wario_both.png\"></a><a href=\"https://hcs64.com/video-boy-vue/images/wario_green.png\"><img src=\"https://hcs64.com/video-boy-vue/images/wario_green.png\"></a><p>The <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composite_video\">composite video</a> output is a bit blurry.

The Elgato isn't picking up chroma for some reason; this may be a flaw in the multi-out to S-Video cable I'm using, or the VUE Monitor may not output a color PAL S-Video signal. I use the brighter \"green\" output on the right when I occasionally <a href=\"https://www.twitch.tv/hcs64\">stream Virtual Boy games</a>.\n\n</p><p>Here's the text of the Video Boy page, based on Google Translate:\n</p><blockquote><p>Simply connect a TV monitor that has PAL video input or RGB input to the Video Boy VUE, and a simulated stereoscopic Virtual Boy image will be displayed. By playing the Virtual Boy game cartridge on the Video Boy VUE, you can display the left-eye image and the right-eye image on the TV monitor in red and green, respectively. It is also possible to select and display an image for the left eye only or an image for the right eye only.\n  </p><p>Since the same screen can be checked by multiple people, it is very useful during demonstrations, specification meetings, debugging, etc.\n</p></blockquote><p>I think the <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/19980117150454/http://www.intsys.co.jp/tool/vue/palboard.html\">PAL仕様モニタ出力ボードVUE</a> (PAL monitor output board) was the same VUE TV Monitor board that's used in the Video Boy, configured as an expansion board for the VUE-DEBUGGER development unit. The notes on that page are similar to the Video Boy, with these two added points:\n</p><blockquote><p>You can record your debugging work on video. This makes it easier to reproduce and check bugs that occur only occasionally, and improves debugging efficiency.\n  </p><p>The need for programmers to look into the scanner during development is drastically reduced, reducing the strain on the eyes of the developer and improving work efficiency.\n</p></blockquote><p>Initially published 2021-05-14.\n\n</p></div></div></div>","contentLength":8077,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46792572"},{"title":"ASML staffing changes could result in a net reduction of around 1700 positions","url":"https://www.asml.com/en/news/press-releases/2026/strengthening-focus-on-engineering-and-innovation","date":1769587362,"author":"dep_b","guid":425195,"unread":true,"content":"<p>Earlier today, as referenced in our FY 2025 results release, the ASML Board of Management shared the following internal message with employees. &nbsp;</p><p>Dear ASML colleagues --&nbsp;<p>Today we shared our full-year financial results for 2025, as well as our outlook for the year ahead. The semiconductor ecosystem is poised to experience significant growth in the coming years, and ASML is well positioned to leverage this positive development. On behalf of the Board of Management, I want to thank everyone for their contribution to this success.&nbsp;</p></p><p>We can attribute our success to our customer dedication, engineering talent and collaborative approach to the ecosystem. Our ability to innovate and execute has generated substantial benefits for our customers and suppliers, our colleagues, and our investors. We intend to continue to grow our workforce and footprint, including at our planned second campus in Eindhoven, in line with customer demand.&nbsp;</p><p>As with any company that grows rapidly, however, we need to be mindful that the way we have grown does not slow us down. The feedback from our colleagues, our suppliers and our customers shows that our ways of working have, in some cases, become less agile. Engineers in particular have expressed their desire to focus their time on engineering, without being hampered by slow process flows, and restore the fast-moving culture that has made us so successful.&nbsp;</p><p>We believe it is important to address these issues so that we are well prepared for future growth and well positioned to continue to deliver for our customers. As a result, we are announcing today that we intend to strengthen our focus on engineering and innovation in critical areas of our company through the streamlining of the Technology and the IT organizations.&nbsp;</p><p>In the Technology organization, we are proposing to shift from a project/matrix setup to one where most of our engineers will be dedicated to a specific product and module. This will allow us to simplify processes and decision-making. This need for simplification is something that we have heard consistently from all levels of the organization.&nbsp;</p><p>We are safeguarding what makes us strong: a dedicated foundational team which will ensure that we continue to develop our deep technical competence, and drive fit-for-purpose commonality and standards across all engineering domains.&nbsp;<p>As a result of these proposed changes, some roles -- mainly at the leadership level -- may no longer be required. At the same time, to retain our engineering capability, we will create new engineering jobs to strengthen existing technology projects and embark on new ones to support our own and our customers’ growth plans. While this will allow some of our impacted colleagues to move to new roles, we have to acknowledge that some will leave ASML as a result.&nbsp;</p></p><p>In addition to the Technology changes, we will also look at the setup of the IT &amp; Data organization, similarly seeking ways to streamline its structure to optimize its delivery capabilities.&nbsp;</p><p>In the coming weeks we will be working closely with our social partners in the Netherlands to discuss the intent and extent of these changes. At this stage, we believe the proposed changes could ultimately result in a net reduction of around 1,700 positions, mostly in the Netherlands, with some in the United States.&nbsp;</p><p>The focus of these changes is on the Technology and the IT organizations. ASML continues to grow and will need to create roles as required to meet customer demand for new machines and servicing, including in Manufacturing, Customer Support and Sales.&nbsp;<p>Of course, every colleague is someone that we value and appreciate: We are committed to acting responsibly - with care, speed, transparency, and fairness - and to supporting them through this change.&nbsp;</p></p><p>We recognize that this news may create uncertainty and raise questions for many of you, but we believe strongly that it is important to be transparent in our approach. We will host all-employee meetings today to share more about the proposed changes. Further information sessions will be held for teams affected, and we commit to continuing to inform you all about what we can, when we can.&nbsp;</p><p>As our FY 2025 financial results demonstrate, we are choosing to make these changes at a moment of strength for the company. Improving our processes and systems will allow us to innovate more and innovate better, generating further responsible growth for ASML and our stakeholders.&nbsp;Christophe, on behalf of the ASML Board of Management&nbsp;</p>","contentLength":4508,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46792370"},{"title":"Why Today’s Video AI Models Fail Robots in the Real World","url":"https://hackernoon.com/why-todays-video-ai-models-fail-robots-in-the-real-world?source=rss","date":1769587199,"author":"aimodels44","guid":425263,"unread":true,"content":"<article>Most video generation models are trained to look realistic, not to understand cause and effect.

Every time I started a new feature, I turned from a developer into a “file manager.” Create a folder, organize files, write boilerplate code, copy imports from a neighbor file, and don’t forget to clean up the mess… Each action only takes a minute, but over a week, it really adds up. Most importantly, this routine drains energy. Instead of keeping my focus on business logic, I wasted my attention on mechanical copy-pasting and checking paths.</p><p>At first, I wanted to solve the problem the “easy way” - by configuring standard File and Code Templates in WebStorm. But I quickly hit a wall: templates can’t handle paths flexibly, they can’t properly convert&nbsp; to&nbsp;&nbsp;inside the code, and sharing settings with the whole team is a nightmare. The tool that was supposed to help started to annoy me.</p><p>Then I thought:&nbsp;<strong>“What if I stop configuring the IDE and start programming it?”</strong>&nbsp;This thought led me to create my own plugin. And you know what? It wasn’t as scary as people say. I didn’t have to learn Java or read manuals for years. It turned out that for a Frontend developer, modern Kotlin looks suspiciously like TypeScript.</p><p>In this article, I’ll share how I went from a simple desire to make a template to building a full-fledged tool, and why you should stop tolerating a bad Developer Experience (DX).</p><h3>The Problem: Infinite Copy-Paste and “Blind” Navigation</h3><p>Dozens of developers work on our project in a single repository. This imposes strict restrictions on code style. For example, any React component is always separated into a presentation part () and logic (), and styles lie nearby in a separate file. Forgot to wrap the component in&nbsp;? Props are not destructured in the first line? You won’t pass Code Review.</p><h3>The Trap of Simple Solutions: Why File Templates Failed</h3><p>When I finally got fed up with the routine, I dug into the settings. The ideal scenario in my head looked like this: one click — and I generate the whole bunch of files (component, view, styles).</p><p>It turned out WebStorm can do this! Deep in the settings&nbsp;<code>Settings -&gt; Editor -&gt; File and Code Templates</code>, there is a feature to create not just files, but hierarchies via “Child Templates”.</p><p>I quickly set up a configuration:</p><ol><li><strong>Parent template (Standard TSX Component):</strong></li></ol><ul></ul><pre><code>import { memo } from 'react'\nimport View from './view'\n\ntype Props = {}\n\nexport const ${NAME} = memo((props: Props) =&gt; {\n    const {} = props\n\n    return &lt;View /&gt;\n})\n</code></pre><ol></ol><ul><li><ul></ul></li></ul><pre><code>import { memo } from 'react';\nimport styles from './styles.module.less';\n\ntype Props = {};\n\nexport default memo((props: Props) =&gt; {\n    return &lt;div className={styles.container}&gt;&lt;/div&gt;;\n});\n</code></pre><ul><li><strong>Styles (styles.module.less):</strong></li><li><strong>File Name: ${NAME}/styles.module</strong></li></ul><p>&nbsp;Victory? I choose the template, enter the folder name and file name, and the IDE creates the folder and organizes the files itself. I felt like an automation genius… for exactly two days.</p><p>The euphoria vanished when I faced the harsh reality of Apache Velocity (the IDE template engine):</p><ul><li>Naming problems: Converting  to  for the import paths and back to  for constants inside the template is painful. You have to write terrible macros that break constantly.</li></ul><ul><li>Limited access to file structure: Templates can only create files relative to where you clicked. If I need to create files in folders of different modules at the same time, templates are powerless.</li></ul><ul><li>Team synchronization: How do I share these settings? \"Export settings to ZIP and import, but don't mix up the checkboxes\"? This doesn't work in a team of 20 people.</li></ul><ul><li>Fragility: The final blow was a WebStorm update. After another IDE update, my configured Child Templates simply disappeared.</li></ul><p>A fair question: why write code by hand in the age of AI? Why not let GitHub Copilot or JetBrains AI create the files? I actively use AI assistants in my work, but for infrastructure tasks, they lose for 3 reasons:</p><ul><li> AI is a probabilistic model. It might generate the correct file structure 9 times out of 10. But on the 10th time, it will \"hallucinate\" an extra import or mix up the folder. With a strict style guide, I need a tool I can trust 100%, not one I have to double-check. A plugin doesn't \"think\" or \"guess\", it follows a strict algorithm.</li><li> To make AI create a complex structure in different modules, I need to write a detailed prompt: \"Create component X in the domain, then the implementation in web, use these paths…\". This takes longer than right-clicking . Plus, AI doesn't always see the full depth of the monorepo the way PSI (the IDE index) does.</li><li>: It's hard to force 20 developers to use the exact same prompt. But it's easy to give them one button that guarantees the same result for everyone.</li></ul><p>When it became clear that standard templates wouldn't cut it, there was only one path left - to write my own tool. The idea of creating a custom IDE plugin was intimidating at first. In the frontend world, we tend to think IntelliJ development is reserved for hardcore Java engineers. Even the JetBrains documentation warns you right away that you probably don't need this, offering  (like LivePlugin). It basically tells you: \"Go write scripts, don't get into this mess.\"</p><p>Honestly, I was scared of diving into an unfamiliar stack. I'm used to TS, NPM, and Webpack, and here I saw Gradle, JVM, and a complex SDK. But the desire to automate the routine was stronger than the fear.</p><h3><strong>Quick Start: Plugin Template</strong></h3><p>You don't need to manually configure the build, write manifests, or figure out CI/CD. You just clone the repo, and you are ready to go. You have a working Hello World, configured Gradle, and GitHub Actions. This saved me days, maybe weeks.</p><h3><strong>Kotlin is Just Like TypeScript (Well, Almost)</strong></h3><p>My second fear was the language. Plugins are written in Java or Kotlin. For someone who writes modern TypeScript, the transition to Kotlin was surprisingly smooth.</p><p><strong>The syntax is very similar:</strong></p><ul><li>The same  instead of </li><li>Lambdas and higher-order functions work just the same.</li><li>Strict typing, which we are used to in TS, works even more reliably here.</li></ul><p>Basically, if you are comfortable with TypeScript, you can read and write Kotlin on the very first evening. The main difficulty was not the language.</p><h3><strong>Documentation and AI Help</strong></h3><p>The most difficult stage was studying the IntelliJ Platform SDK. The documentation at JetBrains is huge, but the learning curve is steep. To understand which class is responsible for \"right-clicking on a file,\" you can spend hours on forums.</p><p>Here, AI agents came to the rescue. I didn't use them to write business logic, but as a smart search engine for the API. Queries like \"How to show notification balloon\" saved a lot of time. Instead of a digging through docs, I got a code example, and then I figured it out myself.</p><h2><strong>Implementation: From Templates to Smart Assistant</strong></h2><p>During development, I identified key tasks that would solve the team's biggest pains. The main goal was for the tool to feel native part of the IDE, and not some alien script. I won't go deep into specific APIs - what matters is what the IDE allows you to do.</p><p>In the IntelliJ world, any action is an Action. To add an item to the right-click menu, you just need to extend the  class.</p><p>But I didn't want to clutter the menu. Why do I need a \"Create Component\" button if I clicked on a folder with business logic or translations? Here, the flexibility of plugins shines. The action class has an  method, which is called every time before showing the menu. I added simple logic:</p><ul><li>Does the file not exist here yet? \\n </li></ul><p>==If yes - show the menu item. If not - hide it. The developer sees only the tools that are relevant right here and right now.==</p><p>The generation itself is also smarter. Standard templates can't go outside the current folder, but our architecture assumes splits code by modules and often uses injection of platform implementations of business logic.</p><p>\\\nSo, I implemented a \"smart\" action. The developer enters the entity name once, and the plugin:</p><ul><li><p>Creates an interface file in  with boilerplate for injection.</p></li><li><p>Calculates paths to  and  modules.</p></li><li><p>Creates corresponding implementation files in those folders.</p></li><li><p>Corrects file and class names (kebab-case for files, PascalCase for classes).</p></li></ul><p>:::info\n I didn't hardcode the templates inside Kotlin classes. This would make the plugin a \"black box.\" Instead, the plugin registers layouts in the standard IDE settings. This gives us flexibility: any team member can go into the settings, correct the code style in the template, and the plugin will immediately pick up the changes.</p><p>The second problem is “dead” text. We use a custom hook&nbsp;<code>useLocalizedString(‘key’)</code>&nbsp;and a component&nbsp;<code>&lt;LocalizedText href=’key’ /&gt;</code>. To the IDE, this is a meaningless string</p><p>To bring them to life, I used&nbsp;. This API lets you tell the IDE: “Look, if you see a string inside this hook, treat it as a link to a JSON file”. Now, holding , I can click on the translation key and jump to the right localization file. No more manual searching.</p><h2>Once I Started, I Couldn’t Stop</h2><p>As soon as the entry barrier was gone and the basic framework was ready, I got carried away. It turned out that having access to the AST (Abstract Syntax Tree) of the code lets you do wonders:</p><ul><li>: The plugin generates mock data for tests based on the interface.</li><li>: When creating a test file, the plugin finds the necessary mocks and adds imports automatically.</li><li>: An action that wraps the selected component in an analytics HOC and passes the required props.</li></ul><p>All these are routine actions, each of which saves dozens of seconds and helps keep focus on the main task.</p><blockquote><p><em>Delivering the tool to the team was simple. No sending . files in Slack. The plugin is published on the&nbsp;. For a new developer, onboarding now looks like this: “Install WebStorm, download our plugin — and you’re ready to go.”</em></p></blockquote><h3>Summary: Developer Experience is in Your Hands</h3><p>Was it worth it? Spending time studying infrastructure, setting up the environment, and coding in a “foreign” language to save a couple of minutes a day?</p><p>If you count pure time, the savings might not look huge — maybe an hour or two a month. But the real value is not in minutes, but in&nbsp;. When the tool works predictably and fast, the micro-annoyances that build up during the day disappear. I stopped thinking about which folder to put the file in or what to name it. I press a button, and the IDE does exactly what is needed.</p><p>This experience taught me two things:</p><ol><li><p>. The division into frontend and backend (or tooling) often exists only in our heads. If you understand algorithms and know how to Google (or ask AI), you can build tools for any platform. Kotlin turned out to be friendly, and the IntelliJ Platform is powerful.</p></li><li><p>. We are used to putting up with inconveniences, waiting for the vendor to release an update. But WebStorm, like VS Code, is a platform. If you don’t like how your hammer works — you can rebuild it.</p></li><li><p>If you work on a large project and feel like you are drowning in routine — don’t be afraid to spend time building your own plugin. It’s an investment that pays off every single day when you come to work and just write code, instead of fighting with the file system.</p></li></ol><p><strong>Ready to shape the future of social discovery?</strong>&nbsp;Explore your dream career at SDG and join a team that’s redefining innovation - your next big opportunity is just a click away! 👉&nbsp;</p>","contentLength":11302,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Amazon Inadvertently Announces Cloud Unit Layoffs In Email To Employees","url":"https://slashdot.org/story/26/01/28/0457219/amazon-inadvertently-announces-cloud-unit-layoffs-in-email-to-employees?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&utm_medium=feed","date":1769576400,"author":"BeauHD","guid":424207,"unread":true,"content":"Amazon appears to have prematurely acknowledged layoffs inside AWS after an internal email referencing \"organizational changes\" and \"impacted colleagues\" was mistakenly sent to cloud employees.

While emerging \"Thinking with Images\" paradigms enable multi-scale visual perception via zoom-in mechanisms, their direct adaptation to IQA induces spurious \"cropping-implies-degradation\" biases and misinterprets natural depth-of-field as artifacts.

Recent research has demonstrated that neural audio codec (NAC) provides superior speaker feature disentanglement and linguistic fidelity. NAC can also be used with causal language models (LM) to enhance linguistic fidelity and prompt control for streaming tasks. However, existing NAC-based online LM systems are designed for voice conversion (VC) rather than anonymization, lacking the techniques required for privacy protection. Building on these advances, we present Stream-Voice-Anon, which adapts modern causal LM-based NAC architectures specifically for streaming SA by integrating anonymization techniques. Our anonymization approach incorporates pseudo-speaker representation sampling, a speaker embedding mixing and diverse prompt selection strategies for LM conditioning that leverage the disentanglement properties of quantized content codes to prevent speaker information leakage. Additionally, we compare dynamic and fixed delay configurations to explore latency-privacy trade-offs in real-time scenarios. Under the VoicePrivacy 2024 Challenge protocol, Stream-Voice-Anon achieves substantial improvements in intelligibility (up to 46% relative WER reduction) and emotion preservation (up to 28% UAR relative) compared to the previous state-of-the-art streaming method DarkStream while maintaining comparable latency (180ms vs 200ms) and privacy protection against lazy-informed attackers, though showing 15% relative degradation against semi-informed attackers.</article>","contentLength":1668,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Model-free policy gradient for discrete-time mean-field control","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11217","date":1769576400,"author":"","guid":424210,"unread":true,"content":"<article>arXiv:2601.11217v2 Announce Type: replace-cross \nAbstract: We study model-free policy learning for discrete-time mean-field control (MFC) problems with finite state space and compact action space.

We introduce a novel perturbation scheme on the state-distribution flow and prove that the gradient of the resulting perturbed value function converges to the true policy gradient as the perturbation magnitude vanishes. This construction yields a fully model-free estimator based solely on simulated trajectories and an auxiliary estimate of the sensitivity of the state distribution. Building on this framework, we develop MF-REINFORCE, a model-free policy gradient algorithm for MFC, and establish explicit quantitative bounds on its bias and mean-squared error.

This universality is highly desired and often achieved using additional techniques such as code concatenation, code switching, or magic state distillation, which can be costly and only work for specific codes. This work implements logical Clifford and T gates through novel ancilla-mediated protocols to construct a universal fault-tolerant quantum gate set. Unlike traditional techniques, our implementation is deterministic, does not consume ancilla registers, does not modify the underlying data codes or registers, and is generic over all stabilizer codes. Thus, any single code becomes capable of universal quantum computation by leveraging helper codes in ancilla registers and mid-circuit measurements. Furthermore, since these logical gates are stabilizer code-generic, these implementations enable communication between heterogeneous stabilizer codes.

Several projection methods specifically tailored to take into account the non-linearity of the data via local embeddings have been proposed. Such methods are often based on local neighbourhood structures and require tuning the number of neighbours that define this local structure, and the dimensionality of the lower-dimensional space onto which the data are projected. Such choices critically influence the quality of the resulting embedding.

In principle, this adaptive framework can be employed to perform an optimal hyper-parameter tuning of any dimensionality reduction algorithm that relies on local neighbourhood structures.

Yet incorporating symmetries into quantum machine learning (QML) ansatzes is not free: symmetrization often adds gates and constrains the circuits. To understand these effects, we present Twirlator, which is an automated pipeline that symmetrizes parameterized QML ansatzes and quantifies the trade-offs as the amount of symmetry increases. Twirlator models partial symmetries by the size of a subgroup of the symmetric group, enabling analysis between the ``no symmetry'' and ``full symmetry'' extremes. Across 19 common ansatz patterns, Twirlator symmetrizes circuits with respect to any subgroup of $S_n$ and measures (1) generator drift, (2) circuit overhead (depth and size), and (3) expressibility and entangling capability. The experimental evaluation focuses on subgroups of $S_4$ and $S_5$. Twirlator reveals that larger subgroups typically increase circuit overhead, reduce expressibility, and often increase entangling capability.

Through a detailed analysis of audio-visual LLMs, we identify attention sinks and massive activations not only at the BOS token but also at intermediate low-semantic tokens across ASR, VSR, and AVSR. We show that massive activations originate in the MLP layers and correspond to fixed feature indices across all sink tokens.

There are several potential reasons for this performance degradation: (A) speech tokens mainly provide phonetic information rather than semantic information, (B) the length of speech sequences is much longer than that of text sequences, and (C) paralinguistic information, such as prosody, introduces additional complexity and variability. In this paper, we explore the influence of three key factors separately by transiting the modality from text to speech in an evolving manner. Our findings reveal that the impact of the three factors varies. Factor A has a relatively minor impact, factor B influences syntactical and semantic modeling more obviously, and factor C exerts the most significant impact, particularly in the basic lexical modeling.

For reliable and efficient automated evaluation, we further develop Rebuttal-RM, a specialized evaluator trained on over 100K samples of multi-source rebuttal data, which achieves scoring consistency with human preferences surpassing powerful judge GPT-4.1.

Although neural operators significantly advanced PDE solving in terms of computational efficiency and accuracy, their underlying assumption of fully-observed spatial inputs severely restricts applicability in real-world applications. We introduce the first systematic framework for learning neural operators from partial observation. We identify and formalize two fundamental obstacles: (i) the supervision gap in unobserved regions that prevents effective learning of physical correlations, and (ii) the dynamic spatial mismatch between incomplete inputs and complete solution fields. Specifically, our proposed Latent Autoregressive Neural Operator(LANO) introduces two novel components designed explicitly to address the core difficulties of partial observations: (i) a mask-to-predict training strategy that creates artificial supervision by strategically masking observed regions, and (ii) a Physics-Aware Latent Propagator that reconstructs solutions through boundary-first autoregressive generation in latent space. Additionally, we develop POBench-PDE, a dedicated and comprehensive benchmark designed specifically for evaluating neural operators under partial observation conditions across three PDE-governed tasks.

A widely used approach to improve dataset diversity involves generating realistic synthetic traffic scenarios. However, producing such scenarios remains difficult due to the precision required when scripting them manually or generating them in a single pass. Natural language offers a flexible way to describe scenarios, but existing text-to-simulation pipelines often rely on static snippet retrieval, limited grammar, single-pass decoding, or lack robust executability checks. Moreover, they depend heavily on constrained LLM prompting with minimal post-processing. To address these limitations, we introduce ARISE - Adaptive Refinement and Iterative Scenario Engineering, a multi-stage tool that converts natural language prompts into executable Scenic scripts through iterative LLM-guided refinement. After each generation, ARISE tests script executability in simulation software, feeding structured diagnostics back to the LLM until both syntactic and functional requirements are met. This process significantly reduces the need for manual intervention. Through extensive evaluation, ARISE outperforms the baseline in generating semantically accurate and executable traffic scenarios with greater reliability and robustness.</article>","contentLength":1424,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Optimizing FaaS Platforms for MCP-enabled Agentic Workflows","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14735","date":1769576400,"author":"","guid":424263,"unread":true,"content":"<article>arXiv:2601.14735v2 Announce Type: replace \nAbstract: Agentic workflows that use autonomous AI Agents powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) and Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers is rapidly rising.

Functions-as-a-Service (FaaS) platforms offer modularity, autoscaling and cost efficiency but are inherently stateless. In this paper, we present the FAME, a FaaS-based architecture for orchestrating MCP-enabled agentic workflows. FAME decomposes agentic patterns such as ReAct into composable agents: Planner, Actor and Evaluator, that are each a FaaS function built using LangGraph and are orchestrated as a FaaS workflow. This enables modular composition as AWS Step Functions and avoids function timeouts seen for monolithic agentic workflows. To address context persistence across user requests in a conversation, FAME automates agent memory persistence and injection using DynamoDB. It also optimizes MCP server deployment through AWS Lambda wrappers, caches tool outputs in S3 and proposes function fusion strategies. We evaluate FAME on two representative applications, on research paper summarization and log analytics, under diverse memory and caching configurations.

Furthermore, HSC incorporates commonly used human thinking strategies across all stages of the internal reasoning process, such as main-feature-oriented reasoning, scope expansion through action, and on-time learning driven by environmental feedback.

However, the clinical consequences of this AI-generated data contamination remain unexplored. Here, we show that in the absence of mandatory human verification, this self-referential cycle drives a rapid erosion of pathological variability and diagnostic reliability. By analysing more than 800,000 synthetic data points across clinical text generation, vision-language reporting, and medical image synthesis, we find that models progressively converge toward generic phenotypes regardless of the model architecture. Specifically, rare but critical findings, including pneumothorax and effusions, vanish from the synthetic content generated by AI models, while demographic representations skew heavily toward middle-aged male phenotypes. Crucially, this degradation is masked by false diagnostic confidence; models continue to issue reassuring reports while failing to detect life-threatening pathology, with false reassurance rates tripling to 40%. Blinded physician evaluation confirms that this decoupling of confidence and accuracy renders AI-generated documentation clinically useless after just two generations. We systematically evaluate three mitigation strategies, finding that while synthetic volume scaling fails to prevent collapse, mixing real data with quality-aware filtering effectively preserves diversity.

Unfortunately, current approaches, whether relying on syntactic mutation or general Large Language Model (LLM) fine-tuning, struggle to preserve the specific semantics found in the logic of bug-triggering programs. Consequently, these critical semantic triggers are often lost, resulting in a limitation of the diversity of generated programs.\n  To explicitly reuse such semantics, we propose FeatureFuzz, a compiler fuzzer that combines features to generate programs. We define a feature as a decoupled primitive that encapsulates a natural language description of a bug-prone invariant, such as an out-of-bounds array access, alongside a concrete code witness of its realization. FeatureFuzz operates via a three-stage workflow: it first extracts features from historical bug reports, synthesizes coherent groups of features, and finally instantiates these groups into valid programs for compiler fuzzing.\n  We evaluated FeatureFuzz on GCC and LLVM. Over 24-hour campaigns, FeatureFuzz uncovered 167 unique crashes, which is 2.78x more than the second-best fuzzer.

In this work, we propose HOSL, a novel Hybrid-Order Split Learning framework that addresses this fundamental trade-off between memory efficiency and optimization effectiveness by strategically integrating ZO optimization on the client side with FO optimization on the server side. By employing memory-efficient ZO gradient estimation at the client, HOSL eliminates backpropagation and activation storage, reducing client memory consumption. Meanwhile, server-side FO optimization ensures fast convergence and competitive performance. Theoretically, we show that HOSL achieves an $\\mathcal{O}(\\sqrt{d_c/TQ})$ rate, which depends on client-side model dimension $d_c$ rather than the full model dimension $d$, demonstrating that convergence improves as more computation is offloaded to the server. Extensive experiments on OPT models (125M and 1.3B parameters) across 6 tasks demonstrate that HOSL reduces client GPU memory by up to 3.7$\\times$ compared to the FO method while achieving accuracy within 0.20%-4.23% of this baseline. Furthermore, HOSL outperforms the ZO baseline by up to 15.55%, validating the effectiveness of our hybrid strategy for memory-efficient training on edge devices.</article>","contentLength":1907,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"iTIMO: An LLM-empowered Synthesis Dataset for Travel Itinerary Modification","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10609","date":1769576400,"author":"","guid":424282,"unread":true,"content":"<article>arXiv:2601.10609v3 Announce Type: replace \nAbstract: Addressing itinerary modification is crucial for enhancing the travel experience as it is a frequent requirement during traveling.

In particular, decision-makers need to understand what causes generative AI systems to exhibit specific output characteristics. Within this general topic, this paper examines a key question: what is it about the input -- the prompt -- that causes an LLM-based generative AI system to produce output that exhibits specific characteristics, such as toxicity, negative sentiment, or political bias. To examine this question, we adapt a common technique from the Explainable AI literature: counterfactual explanations. We explain why traditional counterfactual explanations cannot be applied directly to generative AI systems, due to several differences in how generative AI systems function. We then propose a flexible framework that adapts counterfactual explanations to non-deterministic, generative AI systems in scenarios where downstream classifiers can reveal key characteristics of their outputs. Based on this framework, we introduce an algorithm for generating prompt-counterfactual explanations (PCEs). Finally, we demonstrate the production of counterfactual explanations for generative AI systems with three case studies, examining different output characteristics (viz., political leaning, toxicity, and sentiment). The case studies further show that PCEs can streamline prompt engineering to suppress undesirable output characteristics and can enhance red-teaming efforts to uncover additional prompts that elicit undesirable outputs.

In this study, we review the challenges that disturb the sharing of usable threat information to critical infrastructure operators within the ICS domain. We analyze three major incidents: Stuxnet, Industroyer, and Triton. In addition, we perform a systematic analysis of 196 procedure examples across 79 MITRE ATT&amp;CK techniques from 22 ICS-related malware families, utilizing automated natural language processing techniques to systematically extract and categorize threat observables. Additionally, we investigated nine recent ICS vulnerability advisories from the CISA Known Exploitable Vulnerability catalog. Our analysis identified four important limitations in the ICS threat information sharing ecosystem: (i) the lack of coherent representation of artifacts related to ICS adversarial techniques in information sharing language standards (e.g., STIX); (ii) the dependence on undocumented proprietary technologies; (iii) limited technical details provided in vulnerability and threat incident reports; and (iv) the accessibility of technical details for observed adversarial techniques.

The proposed method incurs modest memory overhead (approximately 30% over AdamW) to accumulate task saliency scores that enable curvature aware merging. These scores, computed as a byproduct of optimization, provide importance estimates comparable to post hoc Fisher computation while producing merge-ready models directly from training. We establish convergence guarantees for non-convex objectives with approximation error bounded by gradient singular value decay. On natural language understanding benchmarks, curvature aware parameter selection outperforms magnitude only baselines across all sparsity levels, with multi-task merging improving 1.6% over strong baselines.

Our model employs a unified hybrid fusion strategy, fusing both feature-level and score-level information to maximize representational richness and decision accuracy.

Nonlinear model reduction with neural networks offers richer representations and higher compression; however, without structural constraints, the learned mapping from latent coordinates to displacements often generalizes poorly beyond the training distribution.\n  We present an odd difference-of-convex (DC) neural formulation that bridges linear and nonlinear model reduction. Our goal is to obtain a latent space that behaves reliably under unseen load magnitudes and directions. To improve extrapolation in magnitude, we introduce convexity into the decoder to discourage oscillatory responses. Yet convexity alone cannot represent the odd symmetry required by many symmetric systems, which is crucial for generalization to inverse force directions. We therefore adopt a DC formulation that preserves the stabilizing effect of convexity while explicitly enforcing odd symmetry. Practically, we realize this structure using an input-convex neural network (ICNN) augmented with symmetry constraints.\n  Across challenging deformation scenarios with varying magnitudes and reversed load directions, our method demonstrates stronger generalization than unconstrained nonlinear reductions while maintaining compact latent spaces and real-time performance.

However, general image editing models often fail to produce satisfactory results when confronted with new styles. The challenge lies in how to effectively fine-tune general image editing models to new styles using only a limited amount of paired data. To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel few-shot style editing framework. For this task, we construct a benchmark dataset that encompasses five distinct styles. Correspondingly, we propose a parameter-efficient multi-style Mixture-of-Experts Low-Rank Adaptation (MoE LoRA) with style-specific and style-shared routing mechanisms for jointly fine-tuning multiple styles. The style-specific routing ensures that different styles do not interfere with one another, while the style-shared routing adaptively allocates shared MoE LoRAs to learn common patterns. Our MoE LoRA can automatically determine the optimal ranks for each layer through a novel metric-guided approach that estimates the importance score of each single-rank component. Additionally, we explore the optimal location to insert LoRA within the Diffusion in Transformer (DiT) model and integrate adversarial learning and flow matching to guide the diffusion training process. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches with significantly fewer LoRA parameters.

This knowledge is typically applied through post-hoc adjustments during ranking or post-ranking. However, this approach remains decoupled from the core model learning, which is particularly undesirable as the industry shifts to end-to-end generative recommendation foundation models. On the other hand, many methods targeting these beyond-accuracy objectives often require architecture-specific modifications and discard these valuable human priors by learning user intent in a fully unsupervised manner.\n  Instead of discarding the human priors accumulated over years of practice, we introduce a backbone-agnostic framework that seamlessly integrates these human priors directly into the end-to-end training of generative recommenders. With lightweight, prior-conditioned adapter heads inspired by efficient LLM decoding strategies, our approach guides the model to disentangle user intent along human-understandable axes (e.g., interaction types, long- vs. short-term interests).

This capability can reduce workload makespan, substantially decreasing job waiting times and optimizing resource allocation. In this context, malleability refers to the ability of applications to adapt to new resource allocations during execution. Although beneficial, malleability incurs significant reconfiguration costs, making the reduction of these costs an important research topic. Some existing solutions for MPI applications respawn the entire application, which is an expensive solution that avoids the reuse of original processes. Other MPI solutions reuse them, but fail to fully release unneeded processes when shrinking, since some ranks within the same communicator remain active across nodes, preventing the application from returning those nodes to the system. This work overcomes both limitations by proposing a novel parallel spawning strategy, in which all processes cooperate in the spawning. This allows expansions to reuse processes while also terminating unneeded ones.\n  This strategy has been validated on two systems with either machines with equal or different numbers of cores.

In contrast, human cooperation often emerges without explicit knowledge of the payoff structure or how individual actions translate into long-run outcomes, relying instead on heuristics, communication, and enforcement. We introduce a CPR simulation framework that removes explicit reward signals and embeds cultural-evolutionary mechanisms: social learning (adopting strategies and beliefs from successful peers) and norm-based punishment, grounded in Ostrom's principles of resource governance. Agents also individually learn from the consequences of harvesting, monitoring, and punishing via environmental feedback, enabling norms to emerge endogenously. We establish the validity of our simulation by reproducing key findings from existing studies on human behavior.

Beyond the general open-vocabulary setup, SOC also enables controllable dataset construction for different use cases and boosts performance in both low-data and closed-vocabulary scenarios.\n  Augmenting LVIS and COCO with synthetic object segments delivers strong performance across different real-data scales and yields even greater improvements under extremely limited real-data conditions, including +6.59 AP on a 1% COCO data setup.

In this work, we study the gradient geometry of diffusion models, which can already produce high-quality replay data.

Two prominent examples are grokking, where test performance improves abruptly long after the training loss has plateaued, and the information bottleneck principle, where models progressively discard input information irrelevant to the prediction task as training proceeds. However, the mechanisms underlying these phenomena and their relations remain poorly understood. In this work, we present a unified explanation of such late-phase phenomena through the lens of neural collapse, which characterizes the geometry of learned representations. We show that the contraction of population within-class variance is a key factor underlying both grokking and information bottleneck, and relate this measure to the neural collapse measure defined on the training set. By analyzing the dynamics of neural collapse, we show that distinct time scales between fitting the training set and the progression of neural collapse account for the behavior of the late-phase phenomena.

However, the robustness and reliability of LLMs in such a specialized and safety-critical domain remain to be evaluated. To address this challenge, this paper establishes AECBench, a comprehensive benchmark designed to quantify the strengths and limitations of current LLMs in the AEC domain. The benchmark features a five-level, cognition-oriented evaluation framework (i.e., Knowledge Memorization, Understanding, Reasoning, Calculation, and Application). Based on the framework, 23 representative evaluation tasks were defined. These tasks were derived from authentic AEC practice, with scope ranging from codes retrieval to specialized documents generation. Subsequently, a 4,800-question dataset encompassing diverse formats, including open-ended questions, was crafted primarily by engineers and validated through a two-round expert review. Furthermore, an \"LLM-as-a-Judge\" approach was introduced to provide a scalable and consistent methodology for evaluating complex, long-form responses leveraging expert-derived rubrics. Through the evaluation of nine LLMs, a clear performance decline across five cognitive levels was revealed. Despite demonstrating proficiency in foundational tasks at the Knowledge Memorization and Understanding levels, the models showed significant performance deficits, particularly in interpreting knowledge from tables in building codes, executing complex reasoning and calculation, and generating domain-specific documents. Consequently, this study lays the groundwork for future research and development aimed at the robust and reliable integration of LLMs into safety-critical engineering practices.</article>","contentLength":1942,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"LingoQ: Bridging the Gap between EFL Learning and Work through AI-Generated Work-Related Quizzes","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17477","date":1769576400,"author":"","guid":424390,"unread":true,"content":"<article>arXiv:2509.17477v2 Announce Type: replace \nAbstract: Non-native English speakers performing English-related tasks at work struggle to sustain EFL learning, despite their motivation.

This motivated the development of quantization-aware PEFT to produce accurate yet efficient quantized models. In this setting, reducing quantization error prior to fine-tuning is crucial for achieving high model accuracy. However, existing methods that rely on low-rank adaptation suffer from limited representational capacity. Recent Fourier-related transform (FT)-based adapters offer greater representational power than low-rank adapters, but their direct integration into quantized models often results in ineffective error reduction and increased computational overhead. To overcome these limitations, we propose QWHA, a method that integrates FT-based adapters into quantized models by employing the Walsh-Hadamard Transform (WHT) as the transform kernel, together with a novel adapter initialization scheme incorporating adaptive parameter selection and value refinement. We demonstrate that QWHA effectively mitigates quantization errors while facilitating fine-tuning, and that its design substantially reduces computational cost.

It better aligns with this intuition and can feature a simple closed-form solution, making it orthogonal to existing techniques and readily integrable into existing quantization pipelines.

A central difficulty in studying sycophancy in large language models (LLMs) is disentangling sycophantic belief shifts from rational changes in behavior driven by new evidence or user-provided information. Existing approaches either measure descriptive behavior changes or apply normative evaluations that rely on objective ground truth, limiting their applicability to subjective or uncertain tasks. We introduce a Bayesian probabilistic framework, grounded in behavioral economics and rational decision theory, that explicitly separates sycophancy from rational belief updating. Within this framework, we achieve three objectives: (i) a descriptive metric that measures sycophancy while controlling for rational responses to evidence; (ii) a normative metric that quantifies how sycophancy leads models astray from Bayesian-consistent belief updating; and (iii) the ability to apply both metrics in settings without ground-truth labels. Applying our framework across multiple LLMs and three uncertainty-driven tasks, we find robust evidence of sycophantic belief shifts and show that their impact on rationality depends on whether models systematically over- or under-update their beliefs. Finally, we demonstrate that a post-hoc calibration method and two fine-tuning strategies (SFT and DPO) substantially reduce Bayesian inconsistency, with particularly strong improvements under explicit sycophancy prompting.</article>","contentLength":1667,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Diversity-Augmented Negative Sampling for Implicit Collaborative Filtering","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14468","date":1769576400,"author":"","guid":424409,"unread":true,"content":"<article>arXiv:2508.14468v2 Announce Type: replace \nAbstract: Recommenders built upon implicit collaborative filtering are typically trained to distinguish between users' positive and negative preferences.

But since items often exhibit clustering in the latent space, existing methods tend to oversample negatives from dense regions, resulting in homogeneous training data and limited model expressiveness. To address these shortcomings, we propose a novel negative sampler with diversity guarantees. To achieve them, our approach first pairs each positive item of a user with one that they have not yet interacted with; this instance, called hard negative, is chosen as the top-scoring item according to the model. Instead of discarding the remaining highly informative items, we store them in a user-specific cache. Next, our diversity-augmented sampler selects a representative subset of negatives from the cache, ensuring its dissimilarity from the corresponding user's hard negatives. Our generator then combines these items with the hard negatives, replacing them to produce more effective (synthetic) negative training data that are informative and diverse.

Over 876,000 people experienced homelessness (PEH) in the U.S. in 2025. Social bias is a significant barrier to alleviation, shaping public perception and influencing policymaking. Given that online textual media and offline city council discourse reflect and influence part of public opinion, it provides valuable insights to identify and track social biases against PEH. We present a new, manually-annotated multi-domain dataset compiled from Reddit, X (formerly Twitter), news articles, and city council meeting minutes across ten U.S. cities. Our 16-category multi-label taxonomy creates a challenging long-tail classification problem: some categories appear in less than 1% of samples, while others exceed 70%. We find that small human-annotated datasets (1,702 samples) are insufficient for training effective classifiers, whether used to fine-tune encoder models or as few-shot examples for LLMs. To address this, we use GPT-4.1 to generate pseudo-labels on a larger unlabeled corpus. Training on this expanded dataset enables even small encoder models (ModernBERT, 150M parameters) to achieve 35.23 macro-F1, approaching GPT-4.1's 41.57.

Recently, Direct Preference Optimization~(DPO) was proposed as a LM alignment method that directly optimize the policy from static preference data, and further improved by incorporating on-policy sampling~(i.e., preference candidates generated during the training loop) for better LM alignment. However, we show on-policy data is not always optimal, with systematic effectiveness difference emerging between static and on-policy preference candidates.

To explain the phenomenon, we propose the alignment stage assumption, which divides the alignment process into two distinct stages: the preference injection stage, which benefits from diverse data, and the preference fine-tuning stage, which favors high-quality data. Through theoretical and empirical analysis, we characterize these stages and propose an effective algorithm to identify the boundaries between them.

This is exacerbated by conflicting gradient directions that prevent effective splitting of these Gaussians; (2) Over-densification of Gaussians occurs in regions with aligned gradient aggregation, leading to redundant component proliferation.

This dataset serves as the agent's conceptual grounding-the \"nouns\" upon which comprehension is built-as well as the basis for learning how to reason and act.

This paper presents TestWeaver, a novel LLM-based approach that integrates lightweight program analysis to create a focused execution context that assists LLMs in better test generation. TestWeaver strategically chooses the following components to overcome LLMs' limited reasoning on complex execution: (1) it reduces hallucinations and improves focus by supplying the LLM with the backward slice from the target line instead of a full program context; (2) it identifies and incorporates close test cases - those that share control-flow similarities with the path to the target line - to provide focused execution context within the LLM's context window; and (3) it enhances LLM's reasoning with execution in-line annotations that encode variable states as comments along the executed path.

This work focuses instead on the increasingly critical issue of startup overhead in training: the delay before training jobs begin execution. Startup overhead is particularly important in large, industrial-scale LLMs, where failures occur more frequently and multiple teams operate in iterative update-debug cycles.

Conveniently, recent work showed that every language model defines an implicit reward model (IM-RM), without requiring any architectural changes. However, such IM-RMs tend to generalize worse, especially out-of-distribution, compared to explicit reward models (EX-RMs) that apply a dedicated linear head over the hidden representations of a language model. The existence of a generalization gap is puzzling, as EX-RMs and IM-RMs are nearly identical. They can be trained using the same data, loss function, and language model, and differ only in how the reward is computed. Toward a fundamental understanding of the implicit biases underlying different reward model types, we investigate the root cause of this gap. Our main finding, backed by theory and experiments, is that IM-RMs rely more heavily on superficial token-level cues. Consequently, they often generalize worse than EX-RMs under token-level distribution shifts, as well as in-distribution. Furthermore, we provide evidence against alternative hypotheses for the generalization gap. Most notably, we challenge the claim that IM-RMs struggle in tasks where generation is harder than verification because they can operate both as a verifier and a generator.

Without guided exploration, these approaches merely reinforce what the model already knows (distribution-sharpening) rather than enabling the model to solve problems where it initially generates no correct solutions. To unlock reasoning ability in such settings, the model must explore new reasoning trajectories beyond its current output distribution. Such exploration requires access to sufficiently good positive samples to guide the learning. While expert demonstrations seem like a natural solution, we find that they are often ineffective in RL post-training. Instead, we identify two key properties of effective positive samples: they should (1) be likely under the current policy, and (2) increase the model's likelihood of predicting the correct answer.

Large Language Models (LLMs) have the potential to support clinicians in this process, however, most applications of LLMs in clinical decision support suffer from one of two limitations: Either they assume the unrealistic scenario of immediate availability of all patient information and do not model the interactive and iterative investigation process, or they restrict themselves to the limited \"out-of-the-box\" capabilities of large pre-trained models without performing task-specific training. In contrast to this, we propose to model clinical decision-making for diagnosis with a hypothesis-driven uncertainty-aware language agent, LA-CDM, that converges towards a diagnosis via repeatedly requesting and interpreting relevant tests. Using a hybrid training paradigm combining supervised and reinforcement learning, we train LA-CDM with three objectives targeting critical aspects of clinical decision-making: accurate hypothesis generation, hypothesis uncertainty estimation, and efficient decision-making.

Current learning-based methods attempt to leverage ``more\" information from both the spatial and the short-term temporal domains, but suffer from unreliable performance under complex conditions while incurring computational redundancy. In this paper, we explore the ``more essential\" information from a more crucial domain for the detection. Through theoretical analysis, we reveal that the global temporal saliency and correlation information in the temporal profile demonstrate significant superiority in distinguishing target signals from other signals. To investigate whether such superiority is preferentially leveraged by well-trained networks, we built the first prediction attribution tool in this field and verified the importance of the temporal profile information. Inspired by the above conclusions, we remodel the IRST detection task as a one-dimensional signal anomaly detection task, and propose an efficient deep temporal probe network (DeepPro) that only performs calculations in the time dimension for IRST detection. We conducted extensive experiments to fully validate the effectiveness of our method. The experimental results are exciting, as our DeepPro outperforms existing state-of-the-art IRST detection methods on widely-used benchmarks with extremely high efficiency, and achieves a significant improvement on dim targets and in complex scenarios.

Real-world deployment requires selecting agent compositions that not only maximize task success but also minimize violations of safety, fairness, and privacy requirements which demands a careful analysis of the low-probability (tail) behaviors of compositions of agents.

To address this, we present RoboMaster, a novel framework that models inter-object dynamics via a collaborative trajectory formulation.

This design effectively alleviates the multi-object feature fusion issue in prior work.

By contrast, scholars in the humanities and qualitative social sciences have developed frameworks for representing meaning through thick description (verbal representations that accommodate heterogeneity and retain contextual information needed to represent human meaning). The verbal capabilities of LLMs now provide a means of at least partially automating the generation and processing of thick descriptions, offering new ways to deploy them at scale. We argue that the problem of rendering human meaning legible is not just about selecting better metrics but about developing new representational formats based on thick description. We frame this as a crucial direction for the application of generative AI and identify five key challenges: preserving context, maintaining interpretive pluralism, integrating perspectives based on lived experience and critical distance, distinguishing qualitative content from quantitative magnitude, and acknowledging meaning as dynamic rather than static.</article>","contentLength":1496,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Text2Grad: Reinforcement Learning from Natural Language Feedback","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22338","date":1769576400,"author":"","guid":424462,"unread":true,"content":"<article>arXiv:2505.22338v2 Announce Type: replace \nAbstract: Traditional RLHF optimizes language models with coarse, scalar rewards that mask the fine-grained reasons behind success or failure, leading to slow and opaque learning.

Given human (or programmatic) critiques, Text2Grad aligns each feedback phrase with the relevant token spans, converts these alignments into differentiable reward signals, and performs gradient updates that directly refine the offending portions of the model's policy.

Text2Grad is realized through three components: (1) a high-quality feedback-annotation pipeline that pairs critiques with token spans; (2) a fine-grained reward model that predicts span-level reward on answers while generating explanatory critiques; and (3) a span-level policy optimizer that back-propagates natural-language gradients. Across summarization, code generation, and question answering, Text2Grad consistently surpasses scalar-reward RL and prompt-only baselines, providing both higher task metrics and richer interpretability.

Synthetic values generated by imputation models often raise concerns regarding data quality and the reliability of data-driven outcomes. To address these concerns, this article proposes an imputation-free incremental attention learning (IFIAL) method for tabular data with missing values. A pair of attention masks is derived and retrofitted to a transformer to directly streamline tabular data without imputing or initializing missing values. The proposed method incrementally learns partitions of overlapping and fixed-size feature sets to enhance the performance of the transformer. The average classification performance rank order across 17 diverse tabular data sets highlights the superiority of IFIAL over 11 state-of-the-art learning methods with or without missing value imputations. Additional experiments corroborate the robustness of IFIAL to varying types and proportions of missing data, demonstrating its superiority over methods that rely on explicit imputations. A feature partition size equal to one-half the original feature space yields the best trade-off between computational efficiency and predictive performance.

The key problem is that deterministic models produce high-quality lip-sync but without rich expressions, whereas stochastic models generate diverse expressions but with lower lip-sync quality. To get the best of both, we seek a stochastic model with accurate lip-sync. To that end, we develop a new approach based on the following observation: if a method generates realistic 3D lip motions, it should be possible to infer the spoken audio from the lip motion. The inferred speech should match the original input audio, and erroneous predictions create a novel supervision signal for training 3D talking head avatars with accurate lip-sync. To demonstrate this effect, we propose THUNDER (Talking Heads Under Neural Differentiable Elocution Reconstruction), a 3D talking head avatar framework that introduces a novel supervision mechanism via differentiable sound production. First, we train a novel mesh-to-speech model that regresses audio from facial animation. Then, we incorporate this model into a diffusion-based talking avatar framework.

However, when it comes to deploying LLM-based code generators, larger LLMs pose significant challenges related to their memory (and, consequently, carbon) footprint. A previous work by Wei et al. proposed to leverage quantization techniques to reduce the memory footprint of LLM-based code generators without substantially degrading their effectiveness. In short, they studied LLMs featuring up to 16B parameters, quantizing their precision from floating point 32 bits down to int 8 bits and showing their limited impact on code generation performance. Given the fast pace at which LLM capabilities and quantization techniques are evolving, in this work we present a differentiated replication of the work by Wei et al. in which we consider (i) on the one side, more recent and larger code-related LLMs, of up to 34B parameters; (ii) the latest advancements in model quantization techniques, which allow pushing the compression to the extreme quantization level of 2 bits per model parameter and; (iii) different types of calibration datasets to guide the quantization process, including code-specific ones. Our empirical evaluation reveals that the new frontier for LLM quantization is 4-bit precision, resulting in an average memory footprint reduction of 70% compared to the original model without observing any significant decrease in performance. Additionally, when the quantization becomes even more extreme (3 and 2 bits), a code-specific calibration dataset helps to limit the loss of performance.</article>","contentLength":1794,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Sample-Efficient Optimization over Generative Priors via Coarse Learnability","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06917","date":1769576400,"author":"","guid":424495,"unread":true,"content":"<article>arXiv:2503.06917v4 Announce Type: replace \nAbstract: In zeroth-order optimization, we seek to minimize a function $d(\\cdot)$, which may encode combinatorial feasibility, using only function evaluations.

In general, achieving the time complexity of graph algorithms implemented in conventional languages using a rule-based graph-transformation language is challenging due to the cost of graph matching. Previous work demonstrated that with rooted rules, certain algorithms can be implemented in the graph programming language GP 2 such that their runtime matches the time complexity of imperative implementations. However, this required input graphs to have a bounded node degree and (for some algorithms) to be connected. In this paper, we overcome these limitations by enhancing the graph data structure generated by the GP 2 compiler and exploiting the new structure in programs. We present three case studies: the first program checks whether input graphs are connected, the second program checks whether input graphs are acyclic, and the third program solves the single-source shortest-paths problem for graphs with integer edge-weights. The first two programs run in linear time on (possibly disconnected) input graphs with arbitrary node degrees. The third program runs in time $O(nm)$ on arbitrary input graphs, matching the time complexity of imperative implementations of the Bellman-Ford algorithm.

While standard distance fields rely on the Euclidean metric, many robotic tasks inherently involve non-Euclidean structures. To this end, we generalize Euclidean distance fields to more general metric spaces by solving the Riemannian eikonal equation, a first-order partial differential equation whose solution defines a distance field and its associated gradient flow on the manifold, enabling the computation of geodesics and globally length-minimizing paths. We demonstrate that geodesic distance fields, the classical Riemannian distance function represented as a global, continuous, and queryable field, are effective for a broad class of robotic problems where Riemannian geometry naturally arises. To realize this, we present a neural Riemannian eikonal solver (NES) that solves the equation as a mesh-free implicit representation without grid discretization, scaling to high-dimensional robot manipulators. Training leverages a physics-informed neural network (PINN) objective that constrains spatial derivatives via the PDE residual and boundary and metric conditions, so the model is supervised by the governing equation and requires no labeled distances or geodesics.

However, these methods have notable limitations: they require white-box access, which is not always feasible, and involve high memory usage. To address scenarios where white-box access is unavailable, attackers often resort to transfer attacks. In transfer attacks, malicious inputs generated using white-box models are applied to black-box models, but this typically results in reduced attack performance. To overcome these challenges, we propose Zer0-Jack, a method that bypasses the need for white-box access by leveraging zeroth-order optimization. We propose patch coordinate descent to efficiently generate malicious image inputs to directly attack black-box MLLMs, which significantly reduces memory usage further. Through extensive experiments, Zer0-Jack achieves a high attack success rate across various models, surpassing previous transfer-based methods and performing comparably with existing white-box jailbreak techniques.

Unfortunately, contemporary approaches to document-level deduplication are either unreliable at accurately identifying duplicate documents or extremely expensive in terms of both runtime and memory. We propose LSHBloom, an extension to MinhashLSH, which replaces the expensive LSHIndex with lightweight Bloom filters. LSHBloom demonstrates the same state-of-the-art deduplication performance as MinhashLSH, with only a marginal increase in false positives (near zero in our experiments), while boasting competitive runtime (12$\\times$ faster than MinhashLSH on peS2o) and, crucially, using 18$\\times$ less disk space than MinhashLSH (as measured on peS2o).

To investigate this, we introduce subgroup induction, a practical framework adapted from Solomonoff Induction (SI), one of the most powerful universal predictors. Our framework analyzes arithmetic problems by breaking them down into subgroups-minimal mappings between a few input digits and a single output digit. Our primary metric, subgroup quality, measures the viability of these shortcuts. Experiments reveal a distinct U-shaped accuracy pattern in multi-digit multiplication: LMs quickly master the first and last output digits while struggling with those in the middle. We demonstrate this U-shape is not coincidental; it perfectly mirrors the quality of the simplest possible subgroups, those requiring the fewest input tokens. This alignment suggests a core learning mechanism: LMs first learn easy, low-token shortcuts and only incorporate more complex, multi-token patterns as training progresses. They do not learn the algorithm of multiplication but rather a hierarchy of increasingly complex symbol-to-symbol mappings.

To address these challenges, we propose TokenCache, a novel acceleration method that leverages the token-based multi-block architecture of transformers to reduce redundant computations. TokenCache tackles three critical questions: (1) Which tokens should be pruned and reused by the caching mechanism to eliminate redundancy? (2) Which blocks should be targeted for efficient caching? (3) At which time steps should caching be applied to balance speed and quality? In response to these challenges, TokenCache introduces a Cache Predictor that hierarchically addresses these issues by (1) Token pruning: assigning importance scores to each token to determine which tokens to prune and reuse; (2) Block selection: allocating pruning ratio to each block to adaptively select blocks for caching; (3) Temporal Scheduling: deciding at which time steps to apply caching strategies.

However, full KRR solvers are challenging to scale to large datasets: both direct (i.e., Cholesky decomposition) and iterative methods (i.e., PCG) incur prohibitive computational and storage costs. The standard approach to scale KRR to large datasets chooses a set of inducing points and solves an approximate version of the problem, inducing points KRR. However, the resulting solution tends to have worse predictive performance than the full KRR solution.

Our key idea is to assign a unique watermark to each user of the GenAI service and embed this watermark into the AI-generated content created by that user. Attribution is then performed by identifying the user whose watermark best matches the one extracted from the given content. This approach, however, faces a key challenge: How should watermarks be selected for users to maximize attribution performance?

For linearly separable data, many algorithms can obtain the exact solution to the corresponding 0-1 loss classification problem efficiently, but for data which is not linearly separable, it has been shown that this problem, in full generality, is NP-hard. Alternative approaches all involve approximations of some kind, such as the use of surrogates for the 0-1 loss (for example, the hinge or logistic loss), none of which can be guaranteed to solve the problem exactly. Finding an efficient, rigorously proven algorithm for obtaining an exact (i.e., globally optimal) solution to the 0-1 loss linear classification problem remains an open problem. By analyzing the combinatorial and incidence relations between hyperplanes and data points, we derive a rigorous construction algorithm, incremental cell enumeration (ICE), that can solve the 0-1 loss classification problem exactly in $O(N^{D+1})$. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first standalone algorithm-one that does not rely on general-purpose solvers-with rigorously proven guarantees for this problem. Moreover, we further generalize ICE to address the polynomial hypersurface classification problem in $O(N^{G+1})$ time, where $G$ is determined by both the data dimension and the polynomial hypersurface degree. The correctness of our algorithm is proved by the use of tools from the theory of hyperplane arrangements and oriented matroids. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm on real-world datasets, achieving optimal training accuracy for small-scale datasets and higher test accuracy on most datasets. Furthermore, our complexity analysis shows that the ICE algorithm offers superior computational efficiency compared with state-of-the-art branch-and-bound algorithm.</article>","contentLength":1948,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Polynomial definability in constraint languages with few subpowers","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.01984","date":1769576400,"author":"","guid":424558,"unread":true,"content":"<article>arXiv:2305.01984v3 Announce Type: replace \nAbstract: A first-order formula is called primitive positive (pp) if it only admits the use of existential quantifiers and conjunction.

Recently proposed efficient ensemble approaches reach the performance of the traditional deep ensembles with significantly lower costs. However, the training resources required by these approaches are still at least the same as training a single dense model. In this work, we draw a unique connection between sparse neural network training and deep ensembles, yielding a novel efficient ensemble learning framework called FreeTickets. Instead of training multiple dense networks and averaging them, we directly train sparse subnetworks from scratch and extract diverse yet accurate subnetworks during this efficient, sparse-to-sparse training. Our framework, FreeTickets, is defined as the ensemble of these relatively cheap sparse subnetworks.

This seemingly counter-intuitive outcome is due to the ultra training/inference efficiency of dynamic sparse training. FreeTickets surpasses the dense baseline in all the following criteria: prediction accuracy, uncertainty estimation, out-of-distribution (OoD) robustness, as well as efficiency for both training and inference.

In an era of globalization and digital connectivity, however, geographic proximity alone may be insufficient to capture how locations are interconnected. To address this limitation, we propose a new multiscale local regression framework, termed M-SGWR, which characterizes spatial interaction across two dimensions: geographic proximity and attribute (variable) similarity. For each predictor, geographic and attribute-based weight matrices are constructed separately and then combined using an optimized parameter, alpha, which governs their relative contribution to local model fitting. Analogous to variable-specific bandwidths in MGWR, the optimal alpha varies by predictor, allowing the model to flexibly account for geographic, mixed, or non-spatial (remote similarity) effects.

The proposed approach leverages a functional equation that characterizes the Laplace-Stieltjes transform of the limit distribution and combines it with a moment-matching method to obtain accurate approximations within a class of linear combinations of Laguerre polynomials with exponential damping.

Through over 250,000 trajectory simulations, we establish sharp constraints on when Penrose extraction with escape to infinity succeeds. The mechanism requires that exhaust ejected inside the ergosphere carries negative Killing energy, which is kinematically accessible only via ultra-relativistic ejection deep within the ergosphere. We find that successful extraction with escape is statistically rare ($\\sim$1% in broad parameter scans) and is governed by strict thresholds: it requires high black hole spin (empirically $a/M \\gtrsim 0.89$) and ultra-relativistic exhaust velocity (onset at $v_e \\approx 0.91c$).

Whereas simulations of $T_2$ are easy, $T_2^{\\prime}$ is not easily simulated if only magnetizations of individual isochromats are simulated.\n  Theory and Methods: Efficient methods for simulating $T_2^{\\prime}$ were proposed. To approximate the Lorentzian function of $T_2^{\\prime}$ realistically, conventional simulators require 100+ isochromats. This approximation can be avoided by utilizing a linear phase model for simulating an entire Lorentzian function directly. To represent the linear phase model, the partial derivatives of the magnetizations with respect to the frequency axis were also simulated. To accelerate the simulations with these partial derivatives, the proposed methods introduced two techniques: analytic solutions, and combined transitions. For understanding the fundamental mechanism of the proposed method, a simple one-isochromat simulation was performed. For evaluating realistic cases, several pulse sequences were simulated using two phantoms with and without $T_2^{\\prime}$ simulations.\n  Results: The one-isochromat simulation demonstrated that $T_2^{\\prime}$ simulations were possible. In the realistic cases, $T_2^{\\prime}$ was recovered as expected without using 100+ isochromats for each point. The computational times with $T_2^{\\prime}$ simulations were only 2.0 to 2.7 times longer than those without $T_2^{\\prime}$ simulations.

Crucially, equalizing actions does not generally equalize outcomes when groups face different constraints or respond differently to the same action. We propose a novel double fairness learning (DFL) framework that explicitly manages the trade-off among three objectives: action fairness, outcome fairness, and value maximization. We integrate fairness directly into a multi-objective optimization problem for policy learning and employ a lexicographic weighted Tchebyshev method that recovers Pareto solutions beyond convex settings, with theoretical guarantees on the regret bounds.

C2NP defines two complementary tasks: (i) generating nanoparticles of specified radii from periodic unit cells, testing whether models capture surface truncation and geometric constraints; and (ii) recovering bulk lattice parameters and space-group symmetry from finite particle configurations, assessing whether models can infer underlying crystallographic order despite surface perturbations. Using diverse materials as a structurally consistent testbed, we construct over 170,000 nanoparticle configurations by carving particles from supercells derived from DFT-relaxed crystal unit cells, and introduce size-based splits that separate interpolation from extrapolation regimes. Experiments with state-of-the-art approaches, including diffusion, flow-matching, and variational models, show that even when losses are low, models often fail geometrically under distribution shift, yielding large lattice-recovery errors and near-zero joint accuracy on structure and symmetry. Overall, our results suggest that current methods rely on template memorization rather than scalable physical generalization. C2NP offers a controlled, reproducible framework for diagnosing these failures, with immediate applications to nanoparticle catalyst design, nanostructured hydrides for hydrogen storage, and materials discovery.

Here we synthesize these threads into a unified account of when contracting recurrent networks yield smooth, topology-preserving internal representations for a broad and biologically relevant class of inputs: regular dynamics on invariant circles and tori.\n  Our contribution is an integrated framework that assembles (i) generalized synchronization and embedding guarantees for contracting reservoirs, (ii) regularity mechanisms ensuring differentiability of the synchronization map under mild constraints, and (iii) a base-system viewpoint in which the invariant manifold generating the input stream is treated as the driving system.

Stablecoins make dollar value globally accessible with secure transfer and settlement. Yet in practice, these stablecoins experience periods of stress and de-pegging from their \\$1 target, posing significant systemic risks. The behavior of market participants during these stress events and the collective actions that either restore or break the peg are not well understood. This paper addresses the question: who restores the peg? We develop a dynamic, agent-based mean-field game framework for fiat-collateralized stablecoins, in which a large population of arbitrageurs and retail traders strategically interacts across explicit primary (mint/redeem) and secondary (exchange) markets during a de-peg episode. The key advantage of this equilibrium formulation is that it endogenously maps market frictions into a market-clearing price path and implied net order flows, allowing us to attribute peg-reverting pressure by channel and to stress-test when a given mechanism becomes insufficient for recovery. Using three historical de-peg events, we show that the calibrated equilibrium reproduces observed recovery half-lives and yields an order flow decomposition in which system-wide stress is predominantly stabilized by primary-market arbitrage, whereas episodes with impaired primary redemption require a joint recovery via both primary and secondary markets. Finally, a quantitative sensitivity analysis of primary-rail frictions identifies a non-linear breakdown threshold. Beyond this point, secondary-market liquidity acts mainly as a second-order amplifier around this primary-market bottleneck.</article>","contentLength":1775,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Reinforcement Learning for Quantum Technology","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18953","date":1769576400,"author":"","guid":424611,"unread":true,"content":"<article>arXiv:2601.18953v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: Many challenges arising in Quantum Technology can be successfully addressed using a set of machine learning algorithms collectively known as reinforcement learning (RL), based on adaptive decision-making through interaction with the quantum device.

However, exact self-similar fractal structures are typically observable only at specific generations and remain visually obscured in conventional binary renderings.

This is because CFD requires specialized expertise and is time-consuming and low throughput, making it difficult to support clinical trials. A deep learning model that maps IA morphology to biomechanical markers can address this, enabling physicians to obtain these markers in real time without performing CFD. Here, we show that a Graph Transformer model that incorporates temporal information, which is supervised by large CFD data, can accurately predict Wall Shear Stress (WSS) across the cardiac cycle from IA surface meshes. The model effectively captures the temporal variations of the WSS pattern, achieving a Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) of up to 0.981 and a maximum-based relative L2 error of 2.8%.

The structure of the underlying systems of coupled Gross--Pitaevskii equations suggests the use of optimised high-order operator splitting methods for dynamical evolution and ground state computation. A second-order barrier, however, prevents the applicability of standard operator splitting methods for both, time evolution as well as imaginary time propagation. An innovative alternative approach accomplishes the design of novel modified operator splitting methods that remain stable under moderate smallness assumptions on the time increments. The core idea is to incorporate commutators of the defining differential and nonlinear multiplication operators, since this permits to fulfill the basic stability requirement of positive method coefficients. Further improvements with respect to convergence at the targeted precision arise from automatic adjustments of the time stepsizes by an inexpensive local error control. The presented numerical experiments confirm the favourable performance of a specific fourth-order modified operator splitting method.

Furthermore, we examine the European Digital Identity Architecture and Reference Framework (ARF), assessing its proposed guidelines and evaluating the extent to which its emerging implementations align with SSI principles.</article>","contentLength":1212,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Visual Generation Unlocks Human-Like Reasoning through Multimodal World Models","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19834","date":1769576400,"author":"","guid":424647,"unread":true,"content":"<article>arXiv:2601.19834v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Humans construct internal world models and reason by manipulating the concepts within these models. Recent advances in AI, particularly chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, approximate such human cognitive abilities, where world models are believed to be embedded within large language models. Expert-level performance in formal and abstract domains such as mathematics and programming has been achieved in current systems by relying predominantly on verbal reasoning. However, they still lag far behind humans in domains like physical and spatial intelligence, which require richer representations and prior knowledge. The emergence of unified multimodal models (UMMs) capable of both verbal and visual generation has therefore sparked interest in more human-like reasoning grounded in complementary multimodal pathways, though their benefits remain unclear. From a world-model perspective, this paper presents the first principled study of when and how visual generation benefits reasoning. Our key position is the visual superiority hypothesis: for certain tasks--particularly those grounded in the physical world--visual generation more naturally serves as world models, whereas purely verbal world models encounter bottlenecks arising from representational limitations or insufficient prior knowledge. Theoretically, we formalize internal world modeling as a core component of CoT reasoning and analyze distinctions among different forms of world models. Empirically, we identify tasks that necessitate interleaved visual-verbal CoT reasoning, constructing a new evaluation suite, VisWorld-Eval. Controlled experiments on a state-of-the-art UMM show that interleaved CoT significantly outperforms purely verbal CoT on tasks that favor visual world modeling, but offers no clear advantage otherwise. Together, this work clarifies the potential of multimodal world modeling for more powerful, human-like multimodal AI.</article>","contentLength":1967,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"A Multi-directional Meta-Learning Framework for Class-Generalizable Anomaly Detection","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19833","date":1769576400,"author":"","guid":424648,"unread":true,"content":"<article>arXiv:2601.19833v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: In this paper, we address the problem of class-generalizable anomaly detection, where the objective is to develop a unified model by focusing our learning on the available normal data and a small amount of anomaly data in order to detect the completely unseen anomalies, also referred to as the out-of-distribution (OOD) classes. Adding to this challenge is the fact that the anomaly data is rare and costly to label. To achieve this, we propose a multidirectional meta-learning algorithm -- at the inner level, the model aims to learn the manifold of the normal data (representation); at the outer level, the model is meta-tuned with a few anomaly samples to maximize the softmax confidence margin between the normal and anomaly samples (decision surface calibration), treating normals as in-distribution (ID) and anomalies as out-of-distribution (OOD). By iteratively repeating this process over multiple episodes of predominantly normal and a small number of anomaly samples, we realize a multidirectional meta-learning framework.

While aggregate metrics like validation loss can follow smooth power-law curves, individual downstream tasks exhibit diverse scaling behaviors: some improve monotonically, others plateau, and some even degrade with scale. We argue that predicting downstream performance from validation perplexity suffers from two limitations: averaging token-level losses obscures signal, and no simple parametric family can capture the full spectrum of scaling behaviors. To address this, we propose Neural Neural Scaling Laws (NeuNeu), a neural network that frames scaling law prediction as time-series extrapolation. NeuNeu combines temporal context from observed accuracy trajectories with token-level validation losses, learning to predict future performance without assuming any bottleneck or functional form. Trained entirely on open-source model checkpoints from HuggingFace, NeuNeu achieves 2.04% mean absolute error in predicting model accuracy on 66 downstream tasks -- a 38% reduction compared to logistic scaling laws (3.29% MAE).

We provide the first controlled, mechanism-level diagnostic study of whether synchronized iterative retrieval and reasoning can surpass an idealized static upper bound (Gold Context) RAG. We benchmark eleven state-of-the-art LLMs under three regimes: (i) No Context, measuring reliance on parametric memory; (ii) Gold Context, where all oracle evidence is supplied at once; and (iii) Iterative RAG, a training-free controller that alternates retrieval, hypothesis refinement, and evidence-aware stopping.

Conventional data-driven methods, such as Multilayer Perceptrons (MLPs) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, improve upon phenomenological models but often struggle with the complex nonlinear dynamics of emission formation. These monolithic architectures are sensitive to dataset variability and typically require deep, computationally expensive structures to perform well, limiting their practical utility. This paper introduces a novel approach that overcomes these limitations by modeling emission dynamics within a structured latent space. Leveraging a Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture (JEPA), the proposed framework learns from a rich dataset that combines real-world Portable Emission Measurement System (PEMS) data with high-frequency hardware-in-the-loop measurements. The model abstracts away irrelevant noise, encoding only the key factors governing emission behavior into a compact, robust representation. This results in superior data efficiency and predictive accuracy across diverse transient regimes, significantly outperforming high-performing LSTM baselines in generalization. To ensure suitability for real-world deployment, the JEPA framework is structured to support pruning and post-training quantization. This strategy drastically reduces the computational footprint, minimizing inference time and memory demand with negligible accuracy loss. The result is a highly efficient model ideal for on-board implementation of advanced strategies, such as model predictive control or model-based reinforcement learning, in conventional and hybrid powertrains.

We introduce a mathematical framework that jointly models architecture and weights in a Sobolev space, enabling a rigorous investigation into the role of neural network architecture in continual learning and its effect on the forgetting loss. We derive necessary conditions for the continual learning solution and prove that learning only model weights is insufficient to mitigate catastrophic forgetting under distribution shifts. Consequently, we prove that by learning the architecture and weights simultaneously at each task, we can reduce catastrophic forgetting.\n  To learn weights and architecture simultaneously, we formulate continual learning as a bilevel optimization problem: the upper level selects an optimal architecture for a given task, while the lower level computes optimal weights via dynamic programming over all tasks. To solve the upper level problem, we introduce a derivative-free direct search algorithm to determine the optimal architecture. Once found, we must transfer knowledge from the current architecture to the optimal one. However, the optimal architecture will result in a weights parameter space different from the current architecture (i.e., dimensions of weights matrices will not match). To bridge the dimensionality gap, we develop a low-rank transfer mechanism to map knowledge across architectures of mismatched dimensions.

This paper presents a two-stage quantum-assisted framework for efficient and resilient topology control in dynamic UAV networks by exploiting quantum parallelism to generate a set of high-quality and structurally diverse candidate topologies. In the offline stage, we formulate the problem as a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) model and leverage quantum annealing (QA) to parallelly sample multiple high-quality and structurally distinct topologies, providing a rich solution space for adaptive decision-making. In the online stage, a lightweight classical selection mechanism rapidly identifies the most suitable topology based on real-time link stability and channel conditions, substantially reducing the computation delay. The simulation results show that, compared to a single static optimal topology, the proposed framework improves performance retention by 6.6% in a 30-second dynamic window. Moreover, relative to the classic method, QA achieves an additional 5.15% reduction in objective value and a 28.3% increase in solution diversity.

Most existing methods treat SIDs as predefined and train recommenders under static indexing. In practice, SIDs are typically optimized only for content reconstruction rather than recommendation accuracy. This leads to an objective mismatch: the system optimizes an indexing loss to learn the SID and a recommendation loss for interaction prediction, but because the tokenizer is trained independently, the recommendation loss cannot update it. A natural approach is to make semantic indexing differentiable so that recommendation gradients can directly influence SID learning, but this often causes codebook collapse, where only a few codes are used. We attribute this issue to early deterministic assignments that limit codebook exploration, resulting in imbalance and unstable optimization.\n  In this paper, we propose DIGER (Differentiable Semantic ID for Generative Recommendation), a first step toward effective differentiable semantic IDs for generative recommendation. DIGER introduces Gumbel noise to explicitly encourage early-stage exploration over codes, mitigating codebook collapse and improving code utilization.

For these newly commissioned plants to run, accurate power forecasts are needed from the onset. These allow grid stability, good reserve management and efficient energy trading. Despite machine learning models having strong performances, they tend to require large volumes of site-specific data that new farms do not yet have. To overcome this data scarcity, we propose a novel transfer learning framework that clusters power output according to covariate meteorological features. Rather than training a single, general-purpose model, we thus forecast with an ensemble of expert models, each trained on a cluster. As these pre-trained models each specialise in a distinct weather pattern, they adapt efficiently to new sites and capture transferable, climate-dependent dynamics. Through the expert models' built-in calibration to seasonal and meteorological variability, we remove the industry-standard requirement of local measurements over a year. Our contributions are two-fold - we propose this novel framework and comprehensively evaluate it on eight offshore wind farms, achieving accurate cross-domain forecasting with under five months of site-specific data. Our experiments achieve a MAE of 3.52\\%, providing empirical verification that reliable forecasts do not require a full annual cycle.

Leveraging inverter-based resources, it is not hard to shape the center of inertia (COI) frequency nicely. However, under weak grid conditions, it becomes insufficient to solely shape the COI frequency since this aggregate signal fails to reveal the inter-area oscillations. In this manuscript, we advocate for foolproof fine-tuning rules for \\emph{frequency shaping control} (FS) based on a systematic analysis of damping ratio and decay rate of inter-area oscillations to simultaneously meet specified metrics for frequency security and oscillatory stability. To this end, building on a modal decomposition, we simplify the oscillation damping problem into a pole-placement task for a set of scalar subsystems, which can be efficiently solved by only investigating the root locus of a scalar subsystem associated with the main mode, while FS inherently guarantees a Nadir-less COI frequency response. Through our proposed root-locus-based oscillatory stability analysis, we derive closed-form expressions for the minimum damping ratio and decay rate among inter-area oscillations in terms of networked system and control parameters under FS. Moreover, we propose useful tuning guidelines for FS which need only simple calculations or visualized tuning to not only shape the COI frequency into a first-order response that converges to a steady-state value within the allowed range but also ensure a satisfactory damping ratio and decay rate of inter-area oscillations following disturbances. As for the common virtual inertia control (VI), although similar oscillatory stability analysis becomes intractable, one can still glean some insights via the root locus method. Numerical simulations validate the proposed tuning for FS as well as the superiority of FS over VI in exponential convergence rate.</article>","contentLength":1947,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"KeepLoRA: Continual Learning with Residual Gradient Adaptation","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19659","date":1769576400,"author":"","guid":424723,"unread":true,"content":"<article>arXiv:2601.19659v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Continual learning for pre-trained vision-language models requires balancing three competing objectives: retaining pre-trained knowledge, preserving knowledge from a sequence of learned tasks, and maintaining the plasticity to acquire new knowledge.

We first analyze the knowledge retention mechanism within the model parameter space and find that general knowledge is mainly encoded in the principal subspace, while task-specific knowledge is encoded in the residual subspace. Motivated by this finding, KeepLoRA learns new tasks by restricting LoRA parameter updates in the residual subspace to prevent interfering with previously learned capabilities. Specifically, we infuse knowledge for a new task by projecting its gradient onto a subspace orthogonal to both the principal subspace of pre-trained model and the dominant directions of previous task features.

Traditional geometric algorithms, including the convex hull, are subject to these challenges. A common approach to improve performance is scaling computational resources, which often results in higher energy consumption. Given the growing global concern regarding sustainable use of energy, this becomes a critical limitation. This work presents a 3D preprocessing filter for the convex hull algorithm using ray tracing and tensor core technologies. The filter builds a delimiter polyhedron based on Manhattan distances that discards points from the original set. The filter is evaluated on two point distributions: uniform and sphere. Experimental results show that the proposed filter, combined with convex hull construction, accelerates the computation of the 3D convex hull by up to $200 \\times$ with respect to a CPU parallel implementation. This research demonstrates that geometric algorithms can be accelerated through massive parallelism while maintaining efficient energy utilization. Beyond execution time and speedup evaluation, we also analyze GPU energy consumption, showing that the proposed preprocessing filter not only reduces the computational workload but also achieves performance gains with controlled energy usage.

Building on this, we propose AES (Adaptive Entropy Scheduling), which adaptively adjusts the entropy coefficient/temperature online using observable drift proxies during training, requiring almost no structural changes and incurring minimal overhead.

Widely adopted knowledge distillation methods often devolve into coarse-grained mimicry, where the student model inefficiently targets its own weaknesses and risks inheriting the teacher's reasoning flaws. This exposes a critical pedagogical dilemma: how to devise a reliable curriculum when the teacher itself is not an infallible expert. Our work resolves this by capitalizing on a key insight: while LLMs may exhibit fallibility in complex, holistic reasoning, they often exhibit high fidelity on focused, atomic sub-problems. Based on this, we propose Divergence-Guided Reasoning Curriculum (DGRC), which constructs a learning path from atomic knowledge to reasoning chains by dynamically deriving two complementary curricula from disagreements in reasoning pathways. When a student and teacher produce conflicting results, DGRC directs the teacher to perform a diagnostic analysis: it analyzes both reasoning paths to formulate atomic queries that target the specific points of divergence, and then self-answers these queries to create high-confidence atomic question-answer pairs. These pairs then serve a dual purpose: (1) providing an atomic curriculum to rectify the student's knowledge gaps, and (2) serving as factual criteria to filter the teacher's original reasoning chains, yielding a verified CoT curriculum that teaches the student how to integrate atomic knowledge into complete reasoning paths.

Traditional 3D pose estimation approaches often ignore the temporal consistency between frames, causing implausible and jittery motion. The emerging field of kinematics-based 3D motion capture addresses these issues by estimating the temporal transitioning between poses instead. A major drawback in current kinematics approaches is their reliance on Euler angles. Despite their simplicity, Euler angles suffer from discontinuity that leads to unstable motion reconstructions, especially in online settings where trajectory refinement is unavailable. Contrarily, quaternions have no discontinuity and can produce continuous transitions between poses.

We complement it with an execution-feasibility model that quantifies co-inclusion constraints under private mempools. Second, we examine execution constraints in the absence of builder markets: without guaranteed atomic inclusion, attackers must rely on sequencer ordering, redundant submissions, and priority fee placement, which renders sandwiching probabilistic rather than deterministic. Third, using transaction-level data from major rollups, we show that naive heuristics overstate sandwich activity. We find that the majority of flagged patterns are false positives and that the median net return for these attacks is negative. Our results suggest that sandwiching, while endemic and profitable on Ethereum L1, is rare, unprofitable, and largely absent in rollups with private mempools. These findings challenge prevailing assumptions, refine measurement of MEV in L2s, and inform the design of sequencing policies.</article>","contentLength":1253,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Learning Adaptive Parallel Execution for Efficient Code Localization","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19568","date":1769576400,"author":"","guid":424759,"unread":true,"content":"<article>arXiv:2601.19568v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Code localization constitutes a key bottleneck in automated software development pipelines.

While adversarial problems are common, classical QD cannot be easily applied to them, as both the fitness and the behavior depend on the opposing solutions. Recently, Generational Adversarial MAP-Elites (GAME) has been proposed to coevolve both sides of an adversarial problem by alternating the execution of a multi-task QD algorithm against previous elites, called tasks. The original algorithm selects new tasks based on a behavioral criterion, which may lead to undesired dynamics due to inter-side dependencies. In addition, comparing sets of solutions cannot be done directly using classical QD measures due to side dependencies. In this paper, we (1) use an inter-variants tournament to compare the sets of solutions, ensuring a fair comparison, with 6 measures of quality and diversity, and (2) propose two tournament-informed task selection methods to promote higher quality and diversity at each generation. We evaluate the variants across three adversarial problems: Pong, a Cat-and-mouse game, and a Pursuers-and-evaders game. We show that the tournament-informed task selection method leads to higher adversarial quality and diversity. We hope that this work will help further advance adversarial quality diversity.

Analysis is based on 131 of the most frequently used search terms extracted from CDRC search logs between December 2023 and October 2024.

Proactively recommending academic papers that align with scholars' literature needs in the research process has become one of the crucial pathways to enhance research efficiency and stimulate innovative thinking. Current academic paper recommendation systems primarily focus on broad and coarse-grained suggestions based on general topic or field similarities. While these systems effectively identify related literature, they fall short in addressing scholars' more specific and fine-grained needs, such as locating papers that utilize particular research methods, or tackle distinct research tasks within the same topic. To meet the diverse and specific literature needs of scholars in the research process, this paper proposes a novel academic paper recommendation method. This approach embeds multidimensional information by integrating new types of fine-grained knowledge entities, title and abstract of document, and citation data. Recommendations are then generated by calculating the similarity between combined paper vectors.

In this paper, we propose Agentic LLM for Robot Manipulation (ALRM), an LLM-driven agentic framework for robotic manipulation. ALRM integrates policy generation with agentic execution through a ReAct-style reasoning loop, supporting two complementary modes: Code-asPolicy (CaP) for direct executable control code generation, and Tool-as-Policy (TaP) for iterative planning and tool-based action execution. To enable systematic evaluation, we also introduce a novel simulation benchmark comprising 56 tasks across multiple environments, capturing linguistically diverse instructions. Experiments with ten LLMs demonstrate that ALRM provides a scalable, interpretable, and modular approach for bridging natural language reasoning with reliable robotic execution.

Conventional approaches project DVL velocities from the body coordinate system to the navigation coordinate system using SINS-derived attitude; however, accumulated attitude estimation errors introduce biases into velocity projection and degrade navigation performance during long-term operation. To address this issue, two complementary improvements are introduced. First, a vehicle attitude error-aware DVL velocity transformation model is formulated by incorporating attitude error terms into the observation equation to reduce projection-induced velocity bias. Second, a covariance matrix-based variance propagation method is developed to transform DVL measurement uncertainty across coordinate systems, introducing an expectation-based attitude error compensation term to achieve statistically consistent noise modeling. Simulation and field experiment results demonstrate that both improvements individually enhance navigation accuracy and confirm that accumulated attitude errors affect both projected velocity measurements and their associated uncertainty. When jointly applied, long-term error divergence is effectively suppressed. Field experimental results show that the proposed approach achieves a 78.3% improvement in 3D position RMSE and a 71.8% reduction in the maximum component-wise position error compared with the baseline IMU+DVL method, providing a robust solution for improving long-term SINS/DVL navigation performance.</article>","contentLength":1652,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Rethinking Intelligence: Brain-like Neuron Network","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19508","date":1769576400,"author":"","guid":424782,"unread":true,"content":"<article>arXiv:2601.19508v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Since their inception, artificial neural networks have relied on manually designed architectures and inductive biases to better adapt to data and tasks.

Current generative approaches, while capable of synthesizing realistic textures, often suffer from information asymmetry -- the intrinsic disparity between the information-sparse low quality inputs and the information-dense high quality outputs. This imbalance leads to a one-to-many mapping, where insufficient constraints result in stochastic uncertainty and hallucinatory artifacts. To bridge this gap, we present \\textbf{Pref-Restore}, a hierarchical framework that integrates discrete semantic logic with continuous texture generation to achieve deterministic, preference-aligned restoration. Our methodology fundamentally addresses this information disparity through two complementary strategies: (1) Augmenting Input Density: We employ an auto-regressive integrator to reformulate textual instructions into dense latent queries, injecting high-level semantic stability to constrain the degraded signals; (2) Pruning Output Distribution: We pioneer the integration of on-policy reinforcement learning directly into the diffusion restoration loop. By transforming human preferences into differentiable constraints, we explicitly penalize stochastic deviations, thereby sharpening the posterior distribution toward the desired high-fidelity outcomes.

However, seemingly incompatible address formats e.g., in Bitcoin and Ethereum, can also be derived from the same public keys, since they rely on the same cryptographic primitives. In this paper, we therefore focus on the underlying public keys to discover reuse within, as well as across, different cryptocurrency networks, enabling us to also match incompatible address formats. Specifically, we analyze key reuse across Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, Dogecoin, Zcash and Tron. Our results reveal that cryptographic keys are extensively and actively reused across these networks, negatively impacting both privacy and security of their users. We are hence the first to expose and quantify cross-chain key reuse between UTXO and account-based cryptocurrencies.

A common approach to provide formal goal-reaching guarantees is to introduce a shielding mechanism that restricts the agent to actions that satisfy predefined safety constraints. The main challenge here is integrating this mechanism with RL so that learning and exploration remain effective without becoming overly conservative. Hence, this paper proposes an RL-based control framework that provides formal goal-reaching guarantees for wheeled mobile robots operating in unstructured environments. We first design a real-time RL policy with a set of 15 carefully defined reward terms. These rewards encourage the robot to reach both static and dynamic goals while generating sufficiently smooth command signals that comply with predefined safety specifications, which is critical in practice. Second, a Lyapunov-like stabilizer layer is integrated into the benchmark RL framework as a policy supervisor to formally strengthen the goal-reaching control while preserving meaningful exploration of the state action space. The proposed framework is suitable for real-time deployment in challenging environments, as it provides a formal guarantee of convergence to the intended goal states and compensates for uncertainties by generating real-time control signals based on the current state, while respecting real-world motion constraints. The experimental results show that the proposed Lyapunov-like stabilizer consistently improves the benchmark RL policies, boosting the goal-reaching rate from 84.6% to 99.0%, sharply reducing failures, and improving efficiency.</article>","contentLength":1789,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Cortex-Grounded Diffusion Models for Brain Image Generation","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19498","date":1769576400,"author":"","guid":424790,"unread":true,"content":"<article>arXiv:2601.19498v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Synthetic neuroimaging data can mitigate critical limitations of real-world datasets, including the scarcity of rare phenotypes, domain shifts across scanners, and insufficient longitudinal coverage.

Although many organizations perform manual fact-checking, this approach is difficult to scale given the growing volume of digital content.

In contrast, video tokens have low semantic density and high spatio-temporal redundancy. This mismatch makes static top-k/top-p strategies ineffective for video decoders: they either introduce unnecessary randomness for low-uncertainty regions (static backgrounds) or get stuck in early errors for high-uncertainty regions (foreground objects). Prediction errors will accumulate as more frames are generated and eventually severely degrade long-horizon quality. To address this, we propose Entropy-Guided k-Guard (ENkG) sampling, a simple yet effective strategy that adapts sampling to token-wise dispersion, quantified by the entropy of each token's predicted distribution. ENkG uses adaptive token candidate sizes: for low-entropy regions, it employs fewer candidates to suppress redundant noise and preserve structural integrity; for high-entropy regions, it uses more candidates to mitigate error compounding.

IDS systematically favors including outliers in subsets which pushes GP towards finding solutions that overfit to outliers. To address this, we introduce ROIDS (Robust Outlier-Aware Informed Down-Sampling), which excludes potential outliers from the sampling process of IDS. With ROIDS it is possible to keep the advantages of IDS without overfitting to outliers and to compete on a wide range of benchmark problems. This is also reflected in our experiments in which ROIDS shows the desired behavior on all studied benchmark problems. ROIDS consistently outperforms IDS on synthetic problems with added outliers as well as on a wide range of complex real-world problems, surpassing IDS on over 80% of the real-world benchmark problems. Moreover, compared to all studied baseline approaches, ROIDS achieves the best average rank across all tested benchmark problems. This robust behavior makes ROIDS a reliable down-sampling method for selection in symbolic regression, especially when outliers may be included in the data set.</article>","contentLength":1411,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Dual-Strategy-Enhanced ConBiMamba for Neural Speaker Diarization","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19472","date":1769576400,"author":"","guid":424801,"unread":true,"content":"<article>arXiv:2601.19472v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Conformer and Mamba have achieved strong performance in speech modeling but face limitations in speaker diarization. Mamba is efficient but struggles with local details and nonlinear patterns. Conformer's self-attention incurs high memory overhead for long speech sequences and may cause instability in long-range dependency modeling. These limitations are critical for diarization, which requires both precise modeling of local variations and robust speaker consistency over extended spans. To address these challenges, we first apply ConBiMamba for speaker diarization. We follow the Pyannote pipeline and propose the Dual-Strategy-Enhanced ConBiMamba neural speaker diarization system. ConBiMamba integrates the strengths of Conformer and Mamba, where Conformer's convolutional and feed-forward structures are utilized to improve local feature extraction. By replacing Conformer's self-attention with ExtBiMamba, ConBiMamba efficiently handles long audio sequences while alleviating the high memory cost of self-attention. Furthermore, to address the problem of the higher DER around speaker change points, we introduce the Boundary-Enhanced Transition Loss to enhance the detection of speaker change points.

Beyond the standard goal of social welfare maximization, effective LLM advertising imposes additional requirements on contextual coherence (ensuring ads align semantically with transient user intents) and computational efficiency (avoiding user interaction latency), as well as adherence to ethical and regulatory standards, including preserving privacy and ensuring explicit ad disclosure. Although various recent solutions have explored bidding on token-level and query-level, both categories of approaches generally fail to holistically satisfy this multifaceted set of constraints.\n  We propose a practical framework that resolves these tensions through two decoupling strategies.

Martin-L{\\\"o}f type theory has four sorts: contexts, substitutions, types and terms. For example, types are indexed over contexts, and terms are indexed over both contexts and types. In this paper we show that any GAT can be reduced to a GAT with only two sorts, and there is a section-retraction correspondence (formally, a strict coreflection) between models of the original and the reduced GAT. In particular, any model of the original GAT can be turned into a model of the reduced (two-sorted) GAT and back, and this roundtrip is the identity.\n  The reduced GAT is simpler than the original GAT in the following aspects: it does not have sort equalities; it does not have interleaved sorts and operations; if the original GAT did not have interleaved sorts and operations, then the reduced GAT won't have operations interleaved between different sorts. In a type-theoretic metatheory, the initial algebra of a GAT is called a quotient inductive-inductive type (QIIT).

While rendering for such devices is expensive, most of the content falls into peripheral vision, where human perception differs from that in the fovea. Consequently, it is critical to understand and leverage the limitations of visual perception to enable efficient rendering. A standard approach is to exploit the reduced sensitivity to spatial details in the periphery by reducing rendering resolution, so-called foveated rendering. While this strategy avoids rendering part of the content altogether, an alternative promising direction is to replace accurate and expensive rendering with inexpensive synthesis of content that is perceptually indistinguishable from the ground-truth image. In this paper, we propose such a method for the efficient generation of an image signal that substitutes the rendering of high-frequency details. The method is grounded in findings from image statistics, which show that preserving appropriate local statistics is critical for perceived image quality. Based on this insight, we extrapolate several local image statistics from foveated content into higher spatial frequency ranges that are attenuated or omitted in the rendering process.

Yet real-world recommendation signals extend far beyond these modalities. To reflect this, we formalize recommendation features into four modalities: text, images, categorical features, and numerical attributes, and highlight the unique challenges this heterogeneity poses for LLMs in understanding multimodal information. In particular, these challenges arise not only across modalities but also within them, as attributes such as price, rating, and time may all be numeric yet carry distinct semantic meanings. Beyond this intra-modality ambiguity, another major challenge is the nested structure of recommendation signals, where user histories are sequences of items, each associated with multiple attributes. To address these challenges, we propose UniRec, a unified multimodal encoder for LLM-based recommendation. UniRec first employs modality-specific encoders to produce consistent embeddings across heterogeneous signals.

We prove an exact decomposition theorem showing how classical scalar assortativity collapses heterogeneous interior-boundary interactions into a single number.

Existing approaches primarily concentrate on learning domain-invariant features, which assume that a model robust to variations in the source domains will generalize well to unseen target domains. However, these approaches neglect a deeper analysis at the parameter level, which makes the model hard to explicitly differentiate between parameters sensitive to domain shifts and those robust, potentially hindering its overall ability to generalize. In order to address these limitations, we first build a covariance-based parameter sensitivity analysis framework to quantify the sensitivity of each parameter in a model to domain shifts. By computing the covariance of parameter gradients across multiple source domains, we can identify parameters that are more susceptible to domain variations, which serves as our theoretical foundation. Based on this, we propose Domain-Sensitive Parameter Regularization (DSP-Reg), a principled framework that guides model optimization by a soft regularization technique that encourages the model to rely more on domain-invariant parameters while suppressing those that are domain-specific. This approach provides a more granular control over the model's learning process, leading to improved robustness and generalization to unseen domains.

In this study, we investigate how software practitioners perceive the socio-emotional gap in HAIC and what capabilities AI systems require for effective collaboration. Through semi-structured interviews with 10 practitioners, we examine how they think about collaborating with human versus AI teammates, focusing on their SEI expectations and the AI capabilities they envision. Results indicate that practitioners currently view AI models as intellectual teammates rather than social partners and expect fewer SEI attributes from them than from human teammates.

Read mapping for short reads comes in two forms: single-end and paired-end, with the latter being more prevalent due to its higher accuracy and support for advanced analysis. Read mapping remains a major performance bottleneck in genome analysis due to expensive dynamic programming. Prior efforts have attempted to mitigate this cost by employing filters to identify and potentially discard computationally expensive matches and leveraging hardware accelerators to speed up the computations.

VUs are modeled as 1D PPP under the non-platooned traffic scenario (N-PTS) and as a 1D Matern cluster process (MCP) under the platooned traffic scenario (PTS). We evaluate the distribution on the per-RSU load, representing the number of VUs served, for the typical and tagged RSU. Additionally, we derive coverage probability (CP) and rate coverage (RC), which measures the probability of the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) and achievable rate above a specified threshold at the typical VU along with their meta distribution (MD), providing a deeper understanding of the reliability and variability of these metrics across different spatial distributions of VUs and RSUs. Finally, we validate our theoretical findings through simulations and provide numerical insights into the impact of different traffic patterns on RSU load distribution, CP, and RC performance.</article>","contentLength":1927,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"CHEHAB RL: Learning to Optimize Fully Homomorphic Encryption Computations","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19367","date":1769576400,"author":"","guid":424843,"unread":true,"content":"<article>arXiv:2601.19367v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) enables computations directly on encrypted data, but its high computational cost remains a significant barrier.

Under imbalanced workloads, collective communication creates synchronization barriers, leading to under-utilization of devices with smaller workloads. This change in training dynamics calls for a revisit of the PS paradigm for its robustness to such imbalance. We propose \\textbf{On-Demand Communication (ODC)}, which adapts PS into Fully Sharded Data Parallel (FSDP) by replacing collective all-gather and reduce-scatter with direct point-to-point communication.

It also enables simpler and more effective load balancing at the minibatch level. Across diverse LLM post-training tasks, ODC consistently improves device utilization and training throughput, achieving up to a 36\\% speedup over standard FSDP.

These methods can be broadly categorized into the data-level and the algorithm-level. The former aims to synthesize minority-class nodes to mitigate quantity imbalance, while the latter tries to optimize the learning process to highlight minority classes. However, neither of them addresses the inherently imbalanced graph structure, which is a fundamental factor that incurs majority-class dominance and minority-class assimilation in GNNs. Our theoretical analysis further supports this critical insight. Therefore, we propose GraphSB (Graph Structural Balance), a novel framework that incorporates Structural Balance as a key strategy to address the underlying imbalanced graph structure before node synthesis. Structural Balance performs a two-stage structure optimization: Structure Enhancement that mines hard samples near decision boundaries through dual-view analysis and enhances connectivity for minority classes through adaptive augmentation, and Relation Diffusion that propagates the enhanced minority context while simultaneously capturing higher-order structural dependencies. Thus, GraphSB balances structural distribution before node synthesis, enabling more effective learning in GNNs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GraphSB significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.

Radar provides complementary advantages such as resilience to poor lighting and adverse weather, but its sparsity and low resolution limit its direct use in detection frameworks. This motivates the need for effective Radar-camera fusion with improved preprocessing and depth estimation strategies. We propose an end-to-end framework that enhances monocular 3D object detection through two key components. First, we introduce InstaRadar, an instance segmentation-guided expansion method that leverages pre-trained segmentation masks to enhance Radar density and semantic alignment, producing a more structured representation. InstaRadar achieves state-of-the-art results in Radar-guided depth estimation, showing its effectiveness in generating high-quality depth features. Second, we integrate the pre-trained RCDPT into the BEVDepth framework as a replacement for its depth module. With InstaRadar-enhanced inputs, the RCDPT integration consistently improves 3D detection performance. Overall, these components yield steady gains over the baseline BEVDepth model, demonstrating the effectiveness of InstaRadar and the advantage of explicit depth supervision in 3D object detection. Although the framework lags behind Radar-camera fusion models that directly extract BEV features, since Radar serves only as guidance rather than an independent feature stream, this limitation highlights potential for improvement.

Individual jobs carry heterogeneous contextual features, based on which the agent chooses a job and matches it with a server to maximize the departure rate. The service/departure rate is governed by a logistic model of the contextual feature with an unknown server-specific parameter. To evaluate the performance of a policy, we consider queue length regret, defined as the difference in queue length between the policy and the optimal policy. The main challenge in the analysis is that the lists of remaining job features in the queue may differ under our policy versus the optimal policy for a given time step, since they may process jobs in different orders. To address this, we propose the idea of policy-switching queues equipped with a sophisticated coupling argument.

In shipyards, pipe spools are critical components; installed deep within hull blocks soon after steel erection, any delay in their procurement can halt all downstream tasks. Recognizing their importance, existing studies predict PLT using the static physical attributes of pipe spools. However, procurement is inherently a dynamic, multi-stakeholder business process involving a continuous sequence of internal and external events at the shipyard, factors often overlooked in traditional approaches. To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel framework that combines event logs, dataset records of the procurement events, with static attributes to predict PLT. The temporal attributes of each event are extracted to reflect the continuity and temporal context of the process. Subsequently, a deep sequential neural network combined with a multi-layered perceptron is employed to integrate these static and dynamic features, enabling the model to capture both structural and contextual information in procurement.

In practice, approximating the empirical score function with a neural network can partially alleviate this issue and improve generalization. Our theoretical framework explains why: In training, the neural network learns a smoother approximation of the weighted sum, allowing the sampling process to be influenced by local manifolds rather than single points. Leveraging this insight, we propose two novel methods to further enhance generalization: (1) Noise Unconditioning enables each training sample to adaptively determine its score function weight to increase the effect of more training samples, thereby preventing single-point dominance and mitigating collapse. (2) Temperature Smoothing introduces an explicit parameter to control the smoothness. By increasing the temperature in the softmax weights, we naturally reduce the dominance of any single training sample and mitigate memorization. Experiments across multiple datasets validate our theoretical analysis and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods in improving generalization while maintaining high generation quality.</article>","contentLength":1727,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Output Feedback Stabilization of Linear Systems via Policy Gradient Methods","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19284","date":1769576400,"author":"","guid":424887,"unread":true,"content":"<article>arXiv:2601.19284v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Stabilizing a dynamical system is a fundamental problem that serves as a cornerstone for many complex tasks in the field of control systems. The problem becomes challenging when the system model is unknown. Among the Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms that have been successfully applied to solve problems pertaining to unknown linear dynamical systems, the policy gradient (PG) method stands out due to its ease of implementation and can solve the problem in a model-free manner. However, most of the existing works on PG methods for unknown linear dynamical systems assume full-state feedback. In this paper, we take a step towards model-free learning for partially observable linear dynamical systems with output feedback and focus on the fundamental stabilization problem of the system. We propose an algorithmic framework that stretches the boundary of PG methods to the problem without global convergence guarantees. We show that by leveraging zeroth-order PG update based on system trajectories and its convergence to stationary points, the proposed algorithms return a stabilizing output feedback policy for discrete-time linear dynamical systems.

For heterogeneous, heavy-tailed reasoning data, this creates structural inefficiencies that waste compute on already-solved patterns while under-training the long tail of hard problems. To address this, we propose Multi-Adversary Group Distributionally Robust Optimization (GDRO), an optimization-first framework that moves beyond uniform reasoning models by dynamically adapting the training distribution.\n  We introduce an Online Difficulty Classifier that partitions prompts into dynamic pass@k difficulty groups. We then propose two independent GDRO games for post-training: (1) Prompt-GDRO, which employs an EMA-debiased multiplicative-weights bandit sampler to target the intensive difficulty margin and upweight persistently hard groups without frequency bias; and (2) Rollout-GDRO, which uses a shadow-price controller to reallocate rollouts across groups, maximizing gradient variance reduction on hard tasks under a fixed mean budget (compute-neutral).

Traditional split learning relies on end-to-end backpropagation across the client-server split point. This incurs a large communication overhead (i.e., forward activations and backward gradients need to be exchanged every iteration) and significant memory use (for storing activations and gradients). In this paper, we develop a beyond-backpropagation training method for split learning. In this approach, the client and server train their model partitions semi-independently, using local loss signals instead of propagated gradients. In particular, the client's network is augmented with a small auxiliary classifier at the split point to provide a local error signal, while the server trains on the client's transmitted activations using the true loss function. This decoupling removes the need to send backward gradients, which cuts communication costs roughly in half and also reduces memory overhead (as each side only stores local activations for its own backward pass). We evaluate our approach on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100. Our experiments show two key results.

The use of higher-frequency communication bands is further limited by increased tissue attenuation. To address these challenges, we propose a hybrid Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) and WiFi communication architecture that combines the low-power operation of BLE with the high data throughput of WiFi. We systematically evaluate the performance of BLE and WiFi under tissue-mimicking conditions by measuring throughput, received signal strength indicator (RSSI), and power consumption. The results demonstrate that amplified BLE with an adaptive transmission power control strategy provides a stable frame rate at low power consumption, while 2.4 GHz WiFi operating in station mode is the most suitable high-throughput communication configuration for WCE. Compared with WiFi, BLE reduces power consumption by approximately ten times, whereas WiFi achieves up to ten times higher throughput. To reconcile these complementary trade-offs, we further introduce a hybrid system with a frame-boundary-synchronized switching mechanism to ensure lossless data transmission during BLE and WiFi transitions.

To tackle this, we propose a reinforcement learning (RL) framework integrated with a latent diffusion model (LDM).

Specifically, we fine-tune LLMs using merely 1,000 benign samples, where each response is prepended with a refusal prefix.

Existing approaches typically treat optical and wireless knowledge as distinct modalities, failing to exploit the fundamental physical principles governing both light and electromagnetic propagation. To bridge this gap, we propose URF-GS, a unified radio-optical radiation field representation framework for accurate and generalizable 3D radio map construction based on 3D Gaussian splatting (3D-GS) and inverse rendering. By fusing visual and wireless sensing observations, URF-GS recovers scene geometry and material properties while accurately predicting radio signal behavior at arbitrary transmitter-receiver (Tx-Rx) configurations. Experimental results demonstrate that URF-GS achieves up to a 24.7% improvement in spatial spectrum prediction accuracy and a 10x increase in sample efficiency for 3D radio map construction compared with neural radiance field (NeRF)-based methods.

Existing tools either rely on slow compiler-based analysis, support only restricted language fragments, or provide little assurance beyond \"it still compiles.\" This paper presents REM2.0, a new extract-function and verification toolchain for Rust. REM2.0 works atop rust-analyzer as a persistent daemon, providing low-latency refactorings with a VSCode front-end. It adds a repairer that automatically adjusts lifetimes and signatures when extraction exposes borrow-checker issues, and an optional verification pipeline connecting to CHARON and AENEAS to generate Coq equivalence proofs for a supported Rust subset. The architecture is evaluated on three benchmark suites. On the original REM artefact, REM2.0 achieves 100% compatibility while reducing latency from ~1000ms to single-digit milliseconds in the daemon. On 40 feature-focused extractions from 20 highly starred GitHub repositories, REM2.0 handles most examples involving async/await, const fn, non-local control flow, generics, and higher-ranked trait bounds.

It considers a 2D grid-based storage for uniform-sized loads (e.g., containers, pallets, or totes), which are moved by a robot (or other manipulator) along a collision-free path in the grid. The loads are labeled (i.e., unique) and must be stored in a given sequence, and later be retrieved in a different sequence -- an operational pattern that arises in logistics applications, such as last-mile distribution centers and shipyards. The objective is to minimize the load relocations to ensure efficient retrieval. A previous result guarantees a zero-relocation solution for known storage and retrieval sequences, even for storage at full capacity, provided that the side of the grid through which loads are stored/retrieved is at least 3 cells wide. However, in practice, the retrieval sequence can change after the storage phase. To address such uncertainty, this work investigates \\emph{$k$-bounded perturbations} during retrieval, under which any two loads may depart out of order if they are originally at most $k$ positions apart. We prove that a $\\Theta(k)$ grid width is necessary and sufficient for eliminating relocations at maximum capacity. We also provide an efficient solver for computing a storage arrangement that is robust to such perturbations. To address the higher-uncertainty case where perturbations exceed $k$, a strategy is introduced to effectively minimize relocations.

In this work, we introduce AgenticSCR, an agentic AI for secure code review for detecting immature vulnerabilities during the pre-commit stage, augmented by security-focused semantic memories. Using our own curated benchmark of immature vulnerabilities, tailored to the pre-commit secure code review, we empirically evaluate how accurate is our AgenticSCR for localizing, detecting, and explaining immature vulnerabilities. Our results show that AgenticSCR achieves at least 153% relatively higher percentage of correct code review comments than the static LLM-based baseline, and also substantially surpasses SAST tools. Moreover, AgenticSCR generates more correct comments in four out of five vulnerability types, consistently and significantly outperforming all other baselines. These findings highlight the importance of Agentic Secure Code Review, paving the way towards an emerging research area of immature vulnerability detection.</article>","contentLength":1564,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"TFFM: Topology-Aware Feature Fusion Module via Latent Graph Reasoning for Retinal Vessel Segmentation","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19136","date":1769576400,"author":"","guid":424973,"unread":true,"content":"<article>arXiv:2601.19136v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Precise segmentation of retinal arteries and veins carries the diagnosis of systemic cardiovascular conditions.

A local Kalman estimator selects scheduling actions, such as power allocation and resource usage, and communicates with a remote estimator based on acknowledgement feedback, balancing estimation performance and communication cost. The resulting problem is naturally formulated as a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP). In settings with observable channel modes, it is well known that monotonicity of the value function can be established via investigating order-preserving property of transition kernels. In contrast, under partial observability, the transition kernels generally lack this property, which prevents the direct application of standard monotonicity arguments. To overcome this difficulty, we introduce a novel technique, referred to as state-space folding, which induces transformed transition kernels recovering order preservation on the folded space. This transformation enables a rigorous monotonicity analysis in the partially observable setting.

Most domain generalization (DG) methods based on domain adversarial learning (DAL) pay much attention to learn domain-invariant information, but often overlook the potential non-causal factors. We unveil two critical causes: 1) The domain discriminator-based DAL method is subject to the extremely sparse domain label, i.e., assigning only one domain label to each dataset, thus can only associate explicit non-causal factor, which is incredibly limited. 2) The non-causal factors, induced by unidentified data bias, are excessively implicit and cannot be solely discerned by conventional DAL paradigm.

The proposed GB-DAL utilizes Prototype-based Granular Ball Splitting (PGBS) module to generate more dense domains from limited datasets, akin to more fine-grained granular balls, indicating more potential non-causal factors. Inspired by adversarial perturbations akin to non-causal factors, we propose a Simulated Non-causal Factors (SNF) module as a means of data augmentation to reduce the implicitness of non-causal factors, and facilitate the training of GB-DAL.

While classical correlations are typically regarded as adversarial to privacy, the role of their quantum analogue, entanglement, is not well understood. In this work, we investigate how quantum entanglement fundamentally shapes quantum local differential privacy (QLDP). We consider a bipartite quantum system whose input state has a prescribed level of entanglement, characterized by a lower bound on the entanglement entropy. Each subsystem is then processed by a local quantum mechanism and measured using local operations only, ensuring that no additional entanglement is generated during the process. Our main result reveals a sharp phase-transition phenomenon in the relation between entanglement and QLDP: below a mechanism-dependent entropy threshold, the optimal privacy leakage level mirrors that of unentangled inputs; beyond this threshold, the privacy leakage level decreases with the entropy, which strictly improves privacy guarantees and can even turn some non-private mechanisms into private ones. The phase-transition phenomenon gives rise to a nonlinear dependence of the privacy leakage level on the entanglement entropy, even though the underlying quantum mechanisms and measurements are linear. We show that the transition is governed by the intrinsic non-convex geometry of the set of entanglement-constrained quantum states, which we parametrize as a smooth manifold and analyze via Riemannian optimization. Our findings demonstrate that entanglement serves as a genuine privacy-enhancing resource, offering a geometric and operational foundation for designing robust privacy-preserving quantum protocols.</article>","contentLength":1807,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Leveraging Sentence-oriented Augmentation and Transformer-Based Architecture for Vietnamese-Bahnaric Translation","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19124","date":1769576400,"author":"","guid":424982,"unread":true,"content":"<article>arXiv:2601.19124v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: The Bahnar people, an ethnic minority in Vietnam with a rich ancestral heritage, possess a language of immense cultural and historical significance.

The extreme foreground-background imbalance significantly hinders models from focusing on diseased regions, while redundant focus on healthy regions not only decreases the efficiency but also increases false positives. Inspired by radiologists' glance and focus diagnostic strategy, we introduce GF-Screen, a Glance and Focus reinforcement learning framework for pan-cancer screening. GF-Screen employs a Glance model to localize the diseased regions and a Focus model to precisely segment the lesions, where segmentation results of the Focus model are leveraged to reward the Glance model via Reinforcement Learning (RL). Specifically, the Glance model crops a group of sub-volumes from the entire CT volume and learns to select the sub-volumes with lesions for the Focus model to segment. Given that the selecting operation is non-differentiable for segmentation training, we propose to employ the segmentation results to reward the Glance model. To optimize the Glance model, we introduce a novel group relative learning paradigm, which employs group relative comparison to prioritize high-advantage predictions and discard low-advantage predictions within sub-volume groups, not only improving efficiency but also reducing false positives. In this way, for the first time, we effectively extend cutting-edge RL techniques to tackle the specific challenges in pan-cancer screening. Extensive experiments on 16 internal and 7 external datasets across 9 lesion types demonstrated the effectiveness of GF-Screen.

Correspondingly, graph anomaly detection (GAD) plays a critical role in identifying anomalies across various domains, including finance, cybersecurity, manufacturing, etc. Facing the large-volume and multi-domain graph data, nascent efforts attempt to develop foundational generalist models capable of detecting anomalies in unseen graphs without retraining. To the best of our knowledge, the different feature semantics and dimensions of cross-domain graph data heavily hinder the development of the graph foundation model, leaving further in-depth continual learning and inference capabilities a quite open problem. Hence, we propose OWLEYE, a novel zero-shot GAD framework that learns transferable patterns of normal behavior from multiple graphs, with a threefold contribution. First, OWLEYE proposes a cross-domain feature alignment module to harmonize feature distributions, which preserves domain-specific semantics during alignment. Second, with aligned features, to enable continuous learning capabilities, OWLEYE designs the multi-domain multi-pattern dictionary learning to encode shared structural and attribute-based patterns. Third, for achieving the in-context learning ability, OWLEYE develops a truncated attention-based reconstruction module to robustly detect anomalies without requiring labeled data for unseen graph-structured data.

However, existing grippers struggle to grasp feature-rich objects with high topological variability, including gears with sharp tooth profiles on automotive assembly lines, corals with fragile protrusions, or vegetables with irregular branching structures like broccoli. Unlike simple geometric primitives such as cubes or spheres, feature-rich objects lack a clear \"optimal\" contact surface, making them both difficult to grasp and susceptible to damage when grasped by existing gripper designs. Safe handling of such objects therefore requires specialized soft grippers whose morphology is tailored to the object's features. Topology optimization offers a promising approach for producing specialized grippers, but its utility is limited by the requirement for pre-defined load cases. For soft grippers interacting with feature-rich objects, these loads arise from hundreds of unpredictable gripper-object contact forces during grasping and are unknown a priori. To address this problem, we introduce SimTO, a framework that enables high-resolution topology optimization by automatically extracting load cases from a contact-based physics simulator, eliminating the need for manual load specification. Given an arbitrary feature-rich object, SimTO produces highly customized soft grippers with fine-grained morphological features tailored to the object geometry.

However, conventional discrete-time economic dispatch fails to capture the intra-temporal variations in load and generation. Its dual solution--the marginal price--may distort economic signals, leading to inefficient market incentives. To analyze these issues, this paper develops a continuous-time dispatch model and derives its dual formulation for price analysis. The continuous-time dispatch produces dual variables that can be interpreted as price signals. Piecewise time-indexed generation and price trajectories are then constructed through a parametric programming approach. The resulting price, represented by the Lagrange multiplier of the system-wide power balance constraint, evolves piecewise along the continuous-time load profile. Each segment corresponds to a critical region characterized by a set of active constraints. Furthermore, we discuss the impact of unit-specific ramping constraints on price implications. Results indicate that continuous-time generation and price trajectories provide deeper insights into the price distortions and inefficient incentives inherent in discrete-time formulations.

While representing problems as graphs is a powerful approach, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are fundamentally constrained by their message-passing mechanism, which imposes a local bottleneck that limits global, holistic reasoning. We argue that dynamic programming (DP), which solves problems by iteratively refining a global state, offers a more powerful and suitable learning paradigm. We introduce FloydNet, a new architecture that embodies this principle. In contrast to local message passing, FloydNet maintains a global, all-pairs relationship tensor and learns a generalized DP operator to progressively refine it. This enables the model to develop a task-specific relational calculus, providing a principled framework for capturing long-range dependencies. Theoretically, we prove that FloydNet achieves 3-WL (2-FWL) expressive power, and its generalized form aligns with the k-FWL hierarchy. FloydNet demonstrates state-of-the-art performance across challenging domains: it achieves near-perfect scores (often &gt;99\\%) on the CLRS-30 algorithmic benchmark, finds exact optimal solutions for the general Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) at rates significantly exceeding strong heuristics, and empirically matches the 3-WL test on the BREC benchmark.

We show that such a network admits a unique state in a certain region of the parameter space, which depends continuously on the parameters. This state breaks into an infinite number of states outside the mentioned region of parameter space. Then, the critical organization is a bifurcation in the parameter space, where a network transitions from a unique state to infinitely many states.

In practice, when developers submit a patch, they often implement the BRT alongside the fix. Our experience deploying agentic APR reveals that developers similarly desire a BRT within AI-generated patches to increase their confidence. However, canonical APR systems tend to generate BRTs and fixes separately, or focus on producing only the fix in the final patch. In this paper, we study agentic APR in the context of cogeneration, where the APR agent is instructed to generate both a fix and a BRT in the same patch. We evaluate the effectiveness of different cogeneration strategies on 120 human-reported bugs at Google and characterize different cogeneration strategies by their influence on APR agent behavior. We develop and evaluate patch selectors that account for test change information to select patches with plausible fixes (and plausible BRTs). Finally, we analyze the root causes of failed cogeneration trajectories. Importantly, we show that cogeneration allows the APR agent to generate BRTs for at least as many bugs as a dedicated BRT agent, without compromising the generation rate of plausible fixes, thereby reducing engineering effort in maintaining and coordinating separate generation pipelines for fix and BRT at scale.</article>","contentLength":1462,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"The Opaque Pointer Design Pattern in Python: Towards a Pythonic PIMPL for Modularity, Encapsulation, and Stability","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19065","date":1769576400,"author":"","guid":425017,"unread":true,"content":"<article>arXiv:2601.19065v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Python libraries often need to maintain a stable public API even as internal implementations evolve, gain new backends, or depend on heavy optional libraries. In Python, where internal objects are easy to inspect and import, users can come to rely on \"reachable internals\" that were never intended to be public, making refactoring risky and slowing long-term maintenance. This paper revisits the pointer-to-implementation (PIMPL) idiom from C++ and reinterprets it as a Pythonic pattern of opaque delegation: a small public object (or module) that delegates its behavior to a separate implementation object treated as internal. We situate this pattern within a broader taxonomy of encapsulation techniques in Python, relate it to existing practices such as module-level indirection, facade objects, and backend dispatch, and identify PIMPL-like structures already used in the standard library and the scientific Python ecosystem. We then show how a Pythonic PIMPL can be used in existing codebases to isolate heavy dependencies, support lazy imports, and enable runtime selection of alternative backends without changing the public API. Finally, we discuss the benefits and trade-offs of the approach and offer practical guidance on when the pattern is appropriate and how to apply it in large, long-lived Python libraries.</article>","contentLength":1372,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Optimizing Conversational Quality in Spoken Dialogue Systems with Reinforcement Learning from AI Feedback","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19063","date":1769576400,"author":"","guid":425018,"unread":true,"content":"<article>arXiv:2601.19063v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Reinforcement learning from human or AI feedback (RLHF/RLAIF) for speech-in/speech-out dialogue systems (SDS) remains underexplored, with prior work largely limited to single semantic rewards applied at the utterance level.

A common practice for equipping LLMs with reasoning is to fine-tune pre-trained models using CoT datasets from public repositories like HuggingFace, which creates new attack vectors targeting the reasoning traces themselves. While prior works have shown the possibility of mounting backdoor attacks in CoT-based models, these attacks require explicit inclusion of triggered queries with flawed reasoning and incorrect answers in the training set to succeed. Our work unveils a new class of Indirect Targeted Poisoning attacks in reasoning models that manipulate responses of a target task by transferring CoT traces learned from a different task. Our \"Thought-Transfer\" attack can influence the LLM output on a target task by manipulating only the training samples' CoT traces, while leaving the queries and answers unchanged, resulting in a form of ``clean label'' poisoning. Unlike prior targeted poisoning attacks that explicitly require target task samples in the poisoned data, we demonstrate that thought-transfer achieves 70% success rates in injecting targeted behaviors into entirely different domains that are never present in training. Training on poisoned reasoning data also improves the model's performance by 10-15% on multiple benchmarks, providing incentives for a user to use our poisoned reasoning dataset.

We present HASTE (Hard-negative Attack Sample Training Engine): a systematic framework that iteratively engineers highly evasive prompts, within a modular optimization process, to continuously enhance detection efficacy for prompt-based attack techniques. The framework is agnostic to synthetic data generation methods, and can be generalized to evaluate prompt-injection detection efficacy, with and without fuzzing, for any hard-negative or hard-positive iteration strategy. Experimental evaluation of HASTE shows that hard negative mining successfully evades baseline detectors, reducing malicious prompt detection for baseline detectors by approximately 64%. However, when integrated with detection model re-training, it optimizes the efficacy of prompt detection models with significantly fewer iteration loops compared to relative baseline strategies. The HASTE framework supports both proactive and reactive hardening of LLM defenses and guardrails.

In this contribution we study the relations between two types of statistical fairness measures namely Statistical-Parity and Equalized-Odds. The Statistical-Parity measure does not rely on having ground truth, i.e., (objectively) labeled target attributes. This makes Statistical-Parity a suitable measure in practice for assessing fairness in data and data classification algorithms. Therefore, Statistical-Parity is adopted in many legal and professional frameworks for assessing algorithmic fairness. The Equalized-Odds measure, on the contrary, relies on having (reliable) ground-truth, which is not always feasible in practice. Nevertheless, there are several situations where the Equalized-Odds definition should be satisfied to enforce false prediction parity among sensitive social groups. We present a novel analyze of the relation between Statistical-Parity and Equalized-Odds, depending on the base-rates of sensitive groups. The analysis intuitively shows how and when base-rate imbalance causes incompatibility between Statistical-Parity and Equalized-Odds measures.

This dissertation focuses on the development and evaluation of complementary experimental platforms: Colosseum, the world's largest Open RAN digital twin, and X5G, an open, programmable, multi-vendor private 5G O-RAN testbed with GPU acceleration. The main contributions include: (i) CaST, enabling automated creation and validation of digital twin wireless scenarios through 3D modeling, ray-tracing, and channel sounding; (ii) validation of Colosseum digital twins at scale, demonstrating that emulated environments closely reproduce real-world setups; (iii) X5G, integrating NVIDIA Aerial GPU-accelerated PHY processing with OpenAirInterface higher layers; (iv) a GPU-accelerated dApp framework for real-time RAN inference, enabling sub-millisecond control loops for AI-native applications including ISAC; and (v) intelligent RAN applications spanning spectrum sharing, interference detection, network slicing, security, and CSI-based sensing. Overall, this dissertation provides an end-to-end methodology bridging digital and physical experimentation for next-generation cellular networks.</article>","contentLength":1968,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Is Finer Better?

Unlocking their potential for efficient training and inference necessitates hardware-friendly implementations that handle matrix multiplications in a native format and adopt efficient error-mitigation strategies. Herein, we report the emergence of a surprising behavior associated with microscaling quantization, whereas the output of a quantized model degrades as block size is decreased below a given threshold. This behavior clashes with the expectation that a smaller block size should allow for a better representation of the tensor elements. We investigate this phenomenon both experimentally and theoretically, decoupling the sources of quantization error behind it. Experimentally, we analyze the distributions of several Large Language Models and identify the conditions driving the anomalous behavior. Theoretically, we lay down a framework showing remarkable agreement with experimental data from pretrained model distributions and ideal ones. Overall, we show that the anomaly is driven by the interplay between narrow tensor distributions and the limited dynamic range of the quantized scales. Based on these insights, we propose the use of FP8 unsigned E5M3 (UE5M3) as a novel hardware-friendly format for the scales in FP4 microscaling data types. We demonstrate that UE5M3 achieves comparable performance to the conventional FP8 unsigned E4M3 scales while obviating the need of global scaling operations on weights and activations.</article>","contentLength":1631,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"EVEREST: An Evidential, Tail-Aware Transformer for Rare-Event Time-Series Forecasting","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19022","date":1769576400,"author":"","guid":425037,"unread":true,"content":"<article>arXiv:2601.19022v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Forecasting rare events in multivariate time-series data is challenging due to severe class imbalance, long-range dependencies, and distributional uncertainty.

EVEREST integrates four components: (i) a learnable attention bottleneck for soft aggregation of temporal dynamics; (ii) an evidential head for estimating aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty via a Normal--Inverse--Gamma distribution; (iii) an extreme-value head that models tail risk using a Generalized Pareto Distribution; and (iv) a lightweight precursor head for early-event detection.

Questions framed through clinical or deficit-oriented assumptions risk alienating participants, undermining rapport, and producing shallow or ethically fraught data. While human-computer interaction (HCI) research increasingly adopts participatory approaches in technology design, participation rarely extends to the design of research methods themselves. This paper examines the role of lived-experience advisors as methodological partners in caregiver interview research. We report on a qualitative study in which two advisors with extensive dementia caregiving experience were engaged prior to fieldwork as methodological partners, extending participatory principles beyond technology design into the design of research methods themselves. Drawing on transcripts of advisor consultations and subsequent interviews with ten caregivers and one person living with dementia, we identify two key methodological contributions of advisor involvement. First, advisors enabled anticipatory validity by surfacing caregiving challenges, ethical sensitivities, and interpretive concerns that later appeared in caregiver interviews, allowing the researcher to enter the field with grounded awareness under constrained recruitment and fieldwork conditions. Second, advisors provided cultural, emotional, and systemic context that improved interpretive sensitivity and helped avoid misreadings. We argue that lived experience functions as methodological infrastructure, extending participatory principles into the design and conduct of research itself, and constituting a generalizable methodological pattern for HCI research with caregivers and other vulnerable or marginalized populations.</article>","contentLength":1933,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"AAA least squares solution of Helmholtz problems","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19020","date":1769576400,"author":"","guid":425039,"unread":true,"content":"<article>arXiv:2601.19020v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: This paper presents an adaptive numerical framework for solving exterior \"sound-soft\" scattering problems governed by the Helmholtz equation.

However, large-angle redirection is inherently ill-posed: a monocular video captures only a narrow spatio-temporal view of a dynamic 3D scene, providing highly partial observations of the underlying 4D world. The key challenge is therefore to recover a complete and coherent representation from this limited input, with consistent geometry and motion. While recent diffusion-based methods achieve impressive results, they often break down under large-angle viewpoint changes far from the original trajectory, where missing visual grounding leads to severe geometric ambiguity and temporal inconsistency. To address this, we present FreeOrbit4D, an effective training-free framework that tackles this geometric ambiguity by recovering a geometry-complete 4D proxy as structural grounding for video generation. We obtain this proxy by decoupling foreground and background reconstructions: we unproject the monocular video into a static background and geometry-incomplete foreground point clouds in a unified global space, then leverage an object-centric multi-view diffusion model to synthesize multi-view images and reconstruct geometry-complete foreground point clouds in canonical object space. By aligning the canonical foreground point cloud to the global scene space via dense pixel-synchronized 3D--3D correspondences and projecting the geometry-complete 4D proxy onto target camera viewpoints, we provide geometric scaffolds that guide a conditional video diffusion model.

This paper presents an automated framework that converts high-level traffic shaping intents in natural or declarative language into valid and correct traffic control rules. To the best of our knowledge, we present the first end-to-end pipeline that ties intent translation in a queuing-theoretic semantic model and, with a rule-based critic, yields deployable Linux traffic control configuration sets. The framework has three steps: (1) a queuing simulation with priority scheduling and Active Queue Management (AQM) builds a semantic model; (2) a language model, using this semantic model and a traffic profile, generates sub-intents and configuration rules; and (3) a rule-based critic checks and adjusts the rules for correctness and policy compliance. We evaluate multiple language models by generating traffic control commands from business intents that comply with relevant standards for traffic control protocols. Experimental results on 100 intents show significant gains, with LLaMA3 reaching 0.88 semantic similarity and 0.87 semantic coverage, outperforming other models by over 30\\.

While automated alignment routines exist, conventional approaches rely on serial, gradient-free searches (e.g., Nelder-Mead) that are sample-inefficient and struggle to correct multiple interacting parameters simultaneously. Conversely, emerging deep learning methods offer speed but often lack the flexibility to adapt to varying sample conditions without extensive retraining. Here, we introduce a Multi-Objective Bayesian Optimization (MOBO) framework for rapid, data-efficient aberration correction. Importantly, this framework does not prescribe a single notion of image quality; instead, it enables user-defined, physically motivated reward formulations (e.g., symmetry-induced objectives) and uses Pareto fronts to expose the resulting trade-offs between competing experimental priorities. By using Gaussian Process regression to model the aberration landscape probabilistically, our workflow actively selects the most informative lens settings to evaluate next, rather than performing an exhaustive blind search.

This study assesses for the first time the extent to which (1) LLM quality scores align with internal departmental quality ratings and (2) LLM reports differ from expert reports.

To relax these assumptions, we study how PSRs learn transition and observation matrices up to a similarity transform, which may be estimated via tensor methods. Our method learns observation matrices and transition matrices up to a partition of states, where the states in a single partition have the same observation distributions corresponding to actions whose transition matrices are full-rank. Our experiments suggest that these partition-level transition models learned by our method, with a sufficient amount of data, meets the performance of PSRs as models to be used by standard sampling-based POMDP solvers. Furthermore, the explicit observation and transition likelihoods can be leveraged to specify planner behavior after the model has been learned.</article>","contentLength":1825,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"On the Role of Depth in Surgical Vision Foundation Models: An Empirical Study of RGB-D Pre-training","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18929","date":1769576400,"author":"","guid":425080,"unread":true,"content":"<article>arXiv:2601.18929v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Vision foundation models (VFMs) have emerged as powerful tools for surgical scene understanding. However, current approaches predominantly rely on unimodal RGB pre-training, overlooking the complex 3D geometry inherent to surgical environments. Although several architectures support multimodal or geometry-aware inputs in general computer vision, the benefits of incorporating depth information in surgical settings remain underexplored. We conduct a large-scale empirical study comparing eight ViT-based VFMs that differ in pre-training domain, learning objective, and input modality (RGB vs. RGB-D). For pre-training, we use a curated dataset of 1.4 million robotic surgical images paired with depth maps generated from an off-the-shelf network. We evaluate these models under both frozen-backbone and end-to-end fine-tuning protocols across eight surgical datasets spanning object detection, segmentation, depth estimation, and pose estimation. Our experiments yield several consistent findings. Models incorporating explicit geometric tokenization, such as MultiMAE, substantially outperform unimodal baselines across all tasks. Notably, geometric-aware pre-training enables remarkable data efficiency: models fine-tuned on just 25% of labeled data consistently surpass RGB-only models trained on the full dataset. Importantly, these gains require no architectural or runtime changes at inference; depth is used only during pre-training, making adoption straightforward.

This report presents the winning VN2 solution: a two-stage predict-then-optimize pipeline that combines a single global multi-horizon forecasting model with a cost-aware ordering policy. The forecasting model is trained in a global paradigm, jointly using all available time series. A gradient-boosted decision tree (GBDT) model implemented in CatBoost is used as the base learner.

However, the respective methods to solve such problems are often developed in an isolated, task-specific manner and thus lack a unifying theoretical foundation. Here, we provide a stepping stone towards the formation of such a foundation and further development by introducing the Neural Graph Inverse Problem (GraIP) conceptual framework, which formalizes and reframes a broad class of graph learning tasks as inverse problems.

We demonstrate the versatility of GraIP across various graph learning tasks, including rewiring, causal discovery, and neural relational inference. We also propose benchmark datasets and metrics for each GraIP domain considered, and characterize and empirically evaluate existing baseline methods used to solve them.

We systematically study how uncertainty propagates through knowledge distillation across three representative model classes--linear regression, feed-forward neural networks, and large language models (LLMs)--and propose simple corrections. We distinguish inter-student uncertainty (variance across independently distilled students) from intra-student uncertainty (variance of a single student's predictive distribution), showing that standard single-response knowledge distillation suppresses intra-student variance while leaving substantial inter-student variability. To address these mismatches, we introduce two variance-aware strategies: averaging multiple teacher responses, which reduces noise at rate $O(1/k)$, and variance-weighting, which combines teacher and student estimates via inverse-variance weighting to yield a minimum-variance estimator. We provide formal guarantees in linear regression, validate the methods in neural networks, and demonstrate empirical gains in LLM distillation, including reduced systematic noise and hallucination.

We instantiate HE for two compositional operators in SCAN-style tasks: modifier HE for unary composition and sequence HE for binary composition, measured by learning representation-level operators that predict composed representations from their parts. Across controlled experiments with small decoder-only Transformers, HE predicts out-of-distribution (OOD) compositional generalization under noise injection, achieving R^2 = 0.73 correlation between modifier HE and OOD accuracy. Ablations show that model depth has minimal effect on either HE or OOD accuracy, training data coverage exhibits threshold effects (insufficient coverage sharply increases HE and degrades OOD performance), and randomly inserted noise tokens systematically increase HE. Finally, we test if HE-regularized training improves OOD accuracy.

Although recent studies increasingly rely on deep and stacked recurrent architectures, the necessity and clinical justification of such architectural complexity have not been rigorously examined. In this work, we perform a systematic comparative evaluation of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) combined with multiple recurrent configurations, including LSTM, GRU, Bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM), and their stacked variants, for multi-label ECG classification on the PTB-XL dataset comprising 23 diagnostic categories. The CNN component serves as a morphology-driven baseline, while recurrent layers are progressively integrated to assess their contribution to temporal modeling and generalization performance. Experimental results indicate that a CNN integrated with a single BiLSTM layer achieves the most favorable trade-off between predictive performance and model complexity.

Traditional dimensionality reduction techniques generate static 2D or 3D embeddings that provide limited interpretability and do not offer a mechanism to leverage the analyst's intuition during exploration. To address this gap, we propose Interactive Project-Based Clustering (IPBC), a framework that reframes clustering as an iterative human-guided visual analysis process. IPBC integrates a nonlinear projection module with a feedback loop that allows users to modify the embedding by adjusting viewing angles and supplying simple constraints such as must-link or cannot-link relationships. These constraints reshape the objective of the projection model, gradually pulling semantically related points closer together and pushing unrelated points further apart. As the projection becomes more structured and expressive through user interaction, a conventional clustering algorithm operating on the optimized 2D layout can more reliably identify distinct groups. An additional explainability component then maps each discovered cluster back to the original feature space, producing interpretable rules or feature rankings that highlight what distinguishes each cluster. Experiments on various benchmark datasets show that only a small number of interactive refinement steps can substantially improve cluster quality.

Hence, RLHF can be viewed as a form of voting, where the aggregation mechanism is defined by the loss function. Although Arrow's Impossibility Theorem suggests that different mechanisms satisfy different sets of desirable axioms, most existing methods rely on a single aggregation principle, typically the Bradley-Terry-Luce (BTL) model, which corresponds to Borda count voting. This restricts the axiomatic properties of the learned reward and obscures the normative assumptions embedded in optimization. In this work, we introduce Differential Voting, a unifying framework that constructs instance-wise, differentiable loss functions whose population-level optima provably correspond to distinct classical voting rules. We develop differentiable surrogates for majority-based aggregation (BTL), Copeland, and Kemeny rules, and formally analyze their calibration properties, gradient fields, and limiting behavior as smoothing parameters vanish. For each loss, we establish consistency with the corresponding social choice rule and characterize the axioms it satisfies or violates. Our analysis shows how design choices in loss geometry-such as margin sensitivity and boundary concentration-directly translate into normative aggregation behavior. Differential Voting makes preference aggregation an explicit and controllable design choice in RLHF, enabling principled trade-offs between axiomatic guarantees and optimization stability.

When combined with the speed and flexibility of context-aware generative AI, the power is greatly expanded, allowing individual users to be targeted with custom-generated AR experiences that are instantly tailored to who they are, where they are, and what they are doing. This can transform the physical world into a magical place, but only if the augmentation of a user's environment is enacted for their personal benefit and best interests. Instead, if AI-powered AR systems are controlled by unregulated third parties, such as large corporations or state actors, individually adaptive AR experiences could be deployed as a dangerous form of targeted influence.

From the resulting 27-configuration space, we identify nine illustrative configurations grouped into three clusters: \"The Present\" (existing tools and emerging steering systems), \"The Threshold\" (where emergent properties appear and coupling becomes constitutive), and \"The Frontier\" (where systems gain reconstructive capabilities).\n  Our analysis explores how agentic DTs exercise performative power--not merely representing physical systems but actively participating in constituting them.

Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) mitigates this issue by grounding answers in external sources, e.g., knowledge graphs (KGs). However, existing KG-based RAG approaches rely on semantics-unaware path sampling and are weakly aligned with KG reasoning objectives, which limits further accuracy gains. They also feed retrieved paths directly into the reasoner without organizing them into answer-centered reasoning paths, hindering small LLMs' ability to leverage the retrieved knowledge. Furthermore, prior works predominantly rely on large LLMs (e.g., ChatGPT/GPT-4) or assume backbones above 7B parameters, leaving sub-7B models underexplored. We address this gap with RPO-RAG, the first KG-based RAG framework specifically designed for small LLMs, to the best of our knowledge. RPO-RAG introduces three key innovations: (1) a query-path semantic sampling strategy that provides informative supervisory signals; (2) a relation-aware preference optimization that aligns training with intermediate KG reasoning signals (e.g., relation); and (3) an answer-centered prompt design that organizes entities and reasoning paths in an interpretable format. Extensive experiments on two benchmark Knowledge Graph Question Answering (KGQA) datasets, WebQSP and CWQ, demonstrate that RPO-RAG effectively bridges the performance gap between small and large language models. On WebQSP, it improves F1 by up to 8.8%, reflecting enhanced answer precision, while on CWQ it achieves new state-of-the-art results among models under 8B parameters in both Hit and F1.

However, a naive modeling of edge-edge relations is computationally intractable even for a graph with moderate scale.

Exposure correction still faces two critical challenges: (1) the ignorance of object-wise regional semantic information causes the color shift artifacts; (2) real-world exposure images generally have no ground-truth labels, and its labeling entails massive manual editing. To tackle the challenges, we propose a new unsupervised semantic-aware exposure correction network. It contains an adaptive semantic-aware fusion module, which effectively fuses the semantic information extracted from a pre-trained Fast Segment Anything Model into a shared image feature space. Then the fused features are used by our multi-scale residual spatial mamba group to restore the details and adjust the exposure. To avoid manual editing, we propose a pseudo-ground truth generator guided by CLIP, which is fine-tuned to automatically identify exposure situations and instruct the tailored corrections. Also, we leverage the rich priors from the FastSAM and CLIP to develop a semantic-prompt consistency loss to enforce semantic consistency and image-prompt alignment for unsupervised training.

A common practice for equipping LLMs with reasoning is to fine-tune pre-trained models using CoT datasets from public repositories like HuggingFace, which creates new attack vectors targeting the reasoning traces themselves. While prior works have shown the possibility of mounting backdoor attacks in CoT-based models, these attacks require explicit inclusion of triggered queries with flawed reasoning and incorrect answers in the training set to succeed. Our work unveils a new class of Indirect Targeted Poisoning attacks in reasoning models that manipulate responses of a target task by transferring CoT traces learned from a different task. Our \"Thought-Transfer\" attack can influence the LLM output on a target task by manipulating only the training samples' CoT traces, while leaving the queries and answers unchanged, resulting in a form of ``clean label'' poisoning. Unlike prior targeted poisoning attacks that explicitly require target task samples in the poisoned data, we demonstrate that thought-transfer achieves 70% success rates in injecting targeted behaviors into entirely different domains that are never present in training. Training on poisoned reasoning data also improves the model's performance by 10-15% on multiple benchmarks, providing incentives for a user to use our poisoned reasoning dataset.

EVEREST integrates four components: (i) a learnable attention bottleneck for soft aggregation of temporal dynamics; (ii) an evidential head for estimating aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty via a Normal--Inverse--Gamma distribution; (iii) an extreme-value head that models tail risk using a Generalized Pareto Distribution; and (iv) a lightweight precursor head for early-event detection.

Consequently, automatic verification tools approximate termination, sometimes failing to prove or disprove; these tools rely on problem-specific architectures and abstractions, and are usually tied to particular programming languages. Recent success and progress in large language models (LLMs) raises the following question: can LLMs reliably predict program termination? In this work, we evaluate LLMs on a diverse set of C programs from the Termination category of the International Competition on Software Verification (SV-Comp) 2025. Our results suggest that LLMs perform remarkably well at predicting program termination, where GPT-5 and Claude Sonnet-4.5 would rank just behind the top-ranked tool (using test-time-scaling), and Code World Model (CWM) would place just behind the second-ranked tool. While LLMs are effective at predicting program termination, they often fail to provide a valid witness as a proof. Moreover, LLMs performance drops as program length increases.

Manual interpretation from this imagery is labor-intensive and error-prone, underscoring the need for automatic and reliable detection across varying scenes. Yet, such automatic detection is challenging due to severe background heterogeneity, dominant empty terrain (class imbalance), small or occluded targets, and wide variation in density and scale. To make the detection model (HerdNet) more robust to these challenges, a weakly supervised patch-level pretraining based on a detection network's architecture is proposed. The detection dataset includes five caribou herds distributed across Alaska. By learning from empty vs. non-empty labels in this dataset, the approach produces early weakly supervised knowledge for enhanced detection compared to HerdNet, which is initialized from generic weights. Accordingly, the patch-based pretrain network attained high accuracy on multi-herd imagery (2017) and on an independent year's (2019) test sets (F1: 93.7%/92.6%, respectively), enabling reliable mapping of regions containing animals to facilitate manual counting on large aerial imagery. Transferred to detection, initialization from weakly supervised pretraining yielded consistent gains over ImageNet weights on both positive patches (F1: 92.6%/93.5% vs. 89.3%/88.6%), and full-image counting (F1: 95.5%/93.3% vs. 91.5%/90.4%).

Through an empirical evaluation on real-world financial data, we show that our quantum agents achieve risk-adjusted performance comparable to, and in some cases exceeding, that of classical Deep RL models with several orders of magnitude more parameters.

User experience mainly looked similar to a search engine: you fill in info about yourself, and you set up filters on whom you’re interested in meeting. With your search results, it almost looked like a marketplace: you can view the profiles matching the criteria, add them to ‘My Matches’, and start correspondence.</p><p>&nbsp;followed up; however, they took dating further, adapting it to internet playful culture: instead of giving you access to endless browsing, they introduced the Matching Test (that had a promise to be extremely scientific -&nbsp;&nbsp;style). That narrowed the search to the list of the most strongly compatible individuals you got to interact with.</p><p>User intent, back then, was tied to a need to expand the pool of viable options limited by people’s offline lives. The end goal was to get it to an actual date, when online engagement was a path to it.</p><p>Main churn reasons were associated with too much effort put in with no desired outcome:</p><p><em>“I’ve sent 10 messages, got 1 reply, nothing’s happening.”</em></p><p><em>“I’ve seen everyone within my radius/criteria.”</em></p><p>On top of that, it was also enough for one creepy interaction to happen to abandon the platform, as it felt too risky.</p><h2>💖 Rise of Swiping Culture</h2><p>At the moment Tinder introduced swipe, online dating was struggling with the same friction most consumer products face early on: slow onboarding, high cognitive load, and too much effort required before a user felt any momentum. All these struggles going through long profiles, having to send an awkward opening message before you even know if you’ll be liked back - swipe removed all of that in one move.</p><p>From the CX perspective, - oh, it felt liberating.

Likes, matches, and notifications turned attraction into a visible number, something you could refresh, count, and come back to. In early dating products, you either received a message or you didn’t — desire was binary and rare. Now it’s continuous and repeatable.</p><p>The app stops being just a path to a date and becomes a confidence stabilizer, a mood regulator, a small hit of reassurance during the day. You no longer need a date or even a conversation to feel successful. Sometimes, a like is enough.</p><p>From a business perspective, swipe was a clean solution to fast-track a user from onboarding to an actual action to get them engaged. It lowered the barrier to participation, increased daily usage, and made dating feel less intimidating for people who were new, shy, or simply short on time.</p><p>The tension emerged later.</p><p>\\\n <img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!BMzh!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1f77470f-c193-4bec-8803-2468bba9cd32_736x423.jpeg\" alt=\"tinder.com\" title=\"left-50\">What was designed to reduce friction also removed many of the natural stopping points that used to give dating a sense of progress. With endless profiles to review and very little guidance on when to slow down, users could stay active without ever feeling closer to an outcome. Over time, more choices didn’t lead to better matches - instead, it imposed more decisions, opened up more conversations that went nowhere, and a growing sense of overwhelm.</p><p>The experience remained busy, but emotionally flat.</p><p>\\\nAs swipe spread across the industry, most products copied the mechanic without rethinking the incentives it created.&nbsp;&nbsp;took a slightly different path, keeping swipe, but flipping the concept by requiring women to initiate conversations.</p><p>That small design choice reintroduced intention into an otherwise frictionless flow, signaling an early understanding that speed and volume alone were not enough to sustain a healthy experience.

The lack of visible progress was.</p><p>When effort isn’t clearly connected to outcomes, users&nbsp;.

Their core mechanics reward repetition, speed, and volume, and over time, those mechanics became inseparable from how success is measured internally.</p><p>Engagement dashboards prioritize activity that can be scaled and compared week over week, while outcomes that happen outside the app remain largely invisible. As a result, product decisions naturally reinforce behaviors that keep users browsing rather than moving forward.</p><p>Across dating products, overwhelm tends to show up through three recurring failure modes — all of them designed into the experience, not caused by user behaviour.</p><ol><li><p>Match rates make asymmetry look visible: for men, right swipes typically convert into matches at around&nbsp;, while for women, that number can be&nbsp;.</p><p>Men swipe more to compensate for scarcity; women swipe more to filter abundance.</p><p>In both cases, sessions stay high while clarity declines.

Fewer&nbsp;<strong>than 50% of matches result in a message</strong>, and only a fraction of those turn into sustained conversations. As a result, users experience high surface-level validation with low emotional payoff.</p><p>Profiles blur together, conversations feel soulless, and the cost of disengaging drops. Engagement metrics still look healthy - but emotional investment per interaction steadily declines.</p></li><li><p>The third, and most critical, failure mode is&nbsp;. Users invest time and attention, but the product offers almost no feedback on whether that effort is improving results. Free-to-paid conversion rates in dating apps typically sit at&nbsp;, driven mostly by a small cohort of power users, while the majority never see enough improvement to justify paying.</p><p>Users don’t know whether better photos, fewer swipes, more messages, or more patience would actually change outcomes. Activity is rewarded; learning is not. When effort doesn’t visibly compound, belief erodes.</p></li></ol><h2>💥 The shift dating apps can’t ignore</h2><p>Just as legacy dating websites that once worked well have struggled to age gracefully, swipe-based apps are now failing to adapt to shifts in dating culture and user intent</p><p>Swipe has trained people to treat dating as a form of lightweight consumption, something that fits into spare moments and boredom gaps. When products attempt to layer intention on top of that mental model, it often feels misaligned. Prompts for deeper conversations or more thoughtful choices struggle to land inside an interface that users associate with casual scrolling. The habit loop remains intact even as the user’s expectations quietly change.</p><blockquote><p>The next era of dating apps won’t feel like apps at all.</p></blockquote><p>\\\nOver time, this affects trust. When apps continue to surface large volumes of weak signals, users learn to do the heavy lifting themselves. They filter harder, reply less, and abandon conversations more quickly. The belief that the product is actively helping them move forward fades, replaced by a sense that it simply keeps them busy.

With AI as a propellant, the work of building automation increasingly becomes automatable itself. As it becomes cheaper and easier to mechanize tasks, automation spreads faster—and speeds up as it spreads. The result is that the current wave of AI adoption is likely to produce major disruption in the labor market.</p><p>\\\nIn earlier automation waves, the limiting factor was rarely whether a task&nbsp;&nbsp;be automated in theory. The real bottleneck was integration: redesigning workflows, handling edge cases, monitoring, maintenance, and training. Those costs created a lag between capability and displacement. AI compresses that lag by making the “integration and iteration” layer cheaper and faster.</p><p>\\\nAI reduces the time and coordination needed to convert work into systems, so adoption often arrives as small workflow insertions rather than dramatic replacement events. Because each attempt is cheaper, firms can try more variants in less time, discard failures at lower cost, and standardize what works. Over time, teams fall into a tight loop: they try small changes, keep what works, and drop what doesn’t.</p><p>\\\nAs AI gets wired into tools and workflows, it can carry work across multiple steps, check results against constraints, and revise repeatedly. That pulls parts of integration—once a major human bottleneck—into the automatable set. More workable “insertions” can be produced per unit time.</p><p>\\\nThis is where&nbsp;&nbsp;shows up. Each successful integration leaves behind reusable scaffolding—patterns, tooling, and operational know-how—that makes the next integration cheaper and faster. Over time, that creates a compounding effect: automation capacity grows because the outputs of automation feed back into producing more automation. Adoption accelerates as it expands, at least for a period, because each successful integration makes the next one cheaper.</p><p>\\\nFirms then translate throughput gains into staffing outcomes in predictable ways: hold headcount flat, consolidate responsibilities, and suppress replacement hiring.</p><p>\\\nAt the labor-market level, the first signature is not necessarily mass layoffs. It is a narrowing flow of openings—roles that never appear, backfills that never happen. Over time, that can accumulate into structurally elevated unemployment even if headline employment looks stable at first.</p><p>\\\nThe bridge from “missing openings” to unemployment is mobility. Job switching and reallocation depend on openings. When backfills disappear and hiring slows, people who would have moved into new roles get stuck, and people who lose a job take longer to find the next one. The disruption shows up first as longer searches, stalled transitions, and underemployment—not necessarily as a single layoff event.</p><p>\\\nOnce that tightening persists, unemployment stops behaving like a short adjustment cost and starts behaving like a baseline. The economy can remain productive while generating fewer entry points, fewer ladders, and fewer second chances. That is how incremental workflow gains can culminate in broad labor-market disruption.</p><p>\\\nIf this thesis is right, the early signal won’t be layoffs—it will be fewer openings, weaker hiring, and longer job-search durations.</p><p>\\\nOver time, the labor market stops behaving like a liquid market and starts behaving like a clogged one. People don’t just lose jobs—they lose&nbsp;: the job hop that would have raised pay, the lateral move that would have reset a career, the junior role that would have opened a new ladder. The visible disruption is a widening gap between “work exists” and “work is available,” where the work that remains is harder to access and more tightly rationed.</p><p>\\\nThis is where mass unemployment becomes a plausible outcome. If snowballing automation continues to raise output per worker while suppressing openings, job creation has to accelerate just to keep unemployment flat. If it doesn’t—if new roles appear more slowly than old roles are compressed—then unemployment stops being cyclical and becomes structural. The economy can look productive and still strand a growing share of workers outside stable employment.</p><p>\\\nSnowballing automation doesn’t need a dramatic replacement event to produce mass unemployment. It can get there quietly, by shrinking the number of opportunities the labor market needs to keep people moving.</p><ol><li>U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). “Job Openings and Labor Turnover Summary (JOLTS).” News release page, accessed January 14, 2026.</li><li>International Monetary Fund (IMF). “New Skills and AI Are Reshaping the Future of Work.” IMF Blog, January 14, 2026.</li><li>Microsoft. “AI at Work Is Here.

Go ahead and hold that memory in the back of your head.</p><p>Perhaps by now you’re tiring of all of these posts on America’s <a href=\"https://www.techdirt.com/tag/measles/\">measles problem</a> that we’ve endured for over a year now. This is so passe, you might be thinking. So, you know, 1990s. And you would have been right before 2025 and the installation of a gravel-mouthed anti-vaxxer as the <a href=\"https://www.techdirt.com/tag/rfk-jr/\">Secretary of HHS</a>. Sadly, 2025 saw more cases of measles in America than at anytime in the previous several decades and a current outbreak in <a href=\"https://www.techdirt.com/2026/01/21/the-measles-outbreak-in-south-carolina-is-spiraling-out-of-control/#comments\">South Carolina</a>, one which is already spreading to far-flung states across the country, has been left unaddressed. </p><p>In my last post on this topic, I complained that those in charge of these agencies are “barely talking about this.” Now that one of those leaders <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/measles-elimination-rfk-jr-cdc-deputy-downplays/\">has talked about it publicly</a>, however, I think I understand why they were kept in silence previously.</p><blockquote><p><em>After a year of ongoing&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/united-states-measles-outbreak-south-carolina-elimination/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">measles outbreaks</a>&nbsp;that have sickened more than&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html\">2,400 people</a>, the United States is poised to lose its status as a measles-free country. However, the newly appointed principal deputy director at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Ralph Abraham, said he was unbothered by the prospect at a briefing for journalists this week.</em></p><p><em>“It’s just the cost of doing business with our borders being somewhat porous for global and international travel,” Abraham said. “We have these communities that choose to be unvaccinated. That’s their personal freedom.”</em></p></blockquote><p>Okay, where to begin? Let’s just start by pointing out that Abraham is a long-time <a href=\"https://www.techdirt.com/2025/12/03/rfk-jr-cdc-vaccine-guidance-a-new-deputy-cdc-director-and-measles-in-south-carolina/\">anti-vaxxer</a>. He has advocated for alternative treatments to all kinds of diseases for which we have actual medicine. He has also advocated for natural immunity over vaccines on the regular. Now that this clown is nominally running the CDC, while America is facing its worst measles crises in over thirty years, the response is as flippant as, “Shit happens because, you know, immigrants.”</p><blockquote><p><em>“When you hear somebody like Abraham say ‘the cost of doing business,’ how can you be more callous,” said pediatrician and vaccine specialist Paul Offit, in an&nbsp;<a href=\"https://rasmussenretorts.substack.com/p/one-year-in-how-the-trump-administration?utm_source=live-stream-redirect&amp;triedRedirect=true\">online discussion</a>&nbsp;hosted by the health blog&nbsp;<a href=\"https://insidemedicine.substack.com/p/one-year-in-how-the-trump-administration\">Inside Medicine</a>&nbsp;on Jan. 20. “Three people died of measles last year in this country,” Offit added. “We eliminated this virus in the year 2000 — eliminated it. Eliminated circulation of the most contagious human infection. That was something to be proud of.”</em></p></blockquote><p>That would be idiotic even if Abraham were right. But he’s  right. As CBS points out in its post, we’ve always had occasional infections from foreign visitors and sources in America, but nothing like these outbreaks. Only 10% of infections over the last year or so came from outside the country. The rest were domestic spread. And while border policy surely has ebbed and flowed over the past 30 years, there wasn’t some drastic change made in the last year that would explain any of this away.</p><p>Now, in all fairness, Abraham has also added that getting two doses of the MMR vaccine is the most effective way to prevent a measles infection. I’m sure saying it was painful for him, but he did it. Still, because the stupidest possible people are running our country right now, the CDC is also studying the genomic makeup of measles infections from different parts of the country. But Timothy, you’re surely saying, that sounds like good science and something they’d use to help fight the disease.</p><p>Nope, wrong. They’re desperately trying to show that the outbreaks are from disparate strains to argue that it hasn’t been 12 months of continuous spread of a single strain to claim that we shouldn’t lose our elimination status. </p><blockquote><p><em>If the CDC’s genomic analyses show that last year’s outbreaks resulted from separate introductions from abroad, political appointees will probably credit Kennedy for saving the country’s status, said Demetre Daskalakis, a former director of the CDC’s national immunization center, who&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/senior-cdc-officials-resign-after-monarez-ouster-cite-concerns-over-scientific-independence/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">resigned in protest</a>&nbsp;of Kennedy’s actions in August.</em></p><p><em>And if studies suggest the outbreaks are linked, Daskalakis predicted, the administration will cast doubt on the findings and downplay the reversal of the country’s status: “They’ll say, who cares.”</em></p><p><em>Indeed, at the briefing, Abraham told a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.statnews.com/2026/01/20/cdc-measles-briefing-lost-elimination-status-cost-of-doing-business/\">reporter from Stat</a>&nbsp;that a reversal in the nation’s status would not be significant: “Losing elimination status does not mean that the measles would be widespread.”</em></p></blockquote><p>The phrase “criminal negligence” leaps to mind. That appears to be the work product of our public health officials at the moment. Neglect and attempts to coverup for that neglect on technicalities.</p><p>Welcome back, measles. I guess you’ll be staying with us a while.</p>","contentLength":4785,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null}],"tags":[]}
