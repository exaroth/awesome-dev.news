He makes a bold claim:</p><blockquote><p>‚ÄúModern SSR frameworks like Next.js and Nuxt are essentially PHP with a new skin ‚Äî just layered with extra build steps, more abstraction, and buzzwords.‚Äù</p></blockquote><p>As someone who spent years writing PHP and has since transitioned to building apps with Python, Vue, and Nuxt, I find myself half-agreeing. But not entirely. So in this post, I want to dig into the SSR comeback, how tooling has evolved, and share my personal take on developing across Python and the modern frontend landscape.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  1. From PHP to Python: How My Tools and Habits Evolved\n</h2><p>I started out on the classic LAMP stack ‚Äî Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP. I hand-coded HTML and jQuery, used Smarty templates, and later embraced Laravel as it rose in popularity.</p><p>But last year, I made the shift to Python. Combined with Vue, Nuxt, and AI-assisted coding (auto-suggestions, API doc generation, etc.), my dev workflow saw a massive productivity boost.</p><ul><li><strong>Richer framework ecosystem</strong>: Django is great out of the box; FastAPI is blazing fast for async APIs.</li><li><strong>First-class async support</strong>: asyncio, uvicorn, and coroutines feel natural.</li><li><strong>Works great with AI tools</strong>: Especially helpful in debugging, testing, and writing clean APIs.</li><li>: When your app needs to crunch data, Python shines.</li></ul><p>Over time, I realized the switch wasn‚Äôt just about language. It was about rethinking how I build modern web apps.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  2. SSR Is Back ‚Äî But Is It Just Modern PHP?\n</h2><p>Maxime nailed a real developer deja vu:</p><blockquote><p>‚ÄúIt used to be that you could drop a .php file on your server and it would render HTML. Now with SSR frameworks, we‚Äôve come full circle back to server-rendered pages.‚Äù</p></blockquote><p>This pendulum swing feels familiar:</p><ul><li>Early web: Traditional SSR (PHP, ASP, JSP) handled full page rendering.</li><li>SPA boom: Everything moved to the frontend (React, Vue), which hurt SEO and slowed first paint.</li><li>Now: Frameworks like Next.js and Nuxt are pushing SSR again as the best of both worlds.</li></ul><p>But is modern SSR really ?\nWe‚Äôve added layers of hydration, streaming, edge functions, and complex build pipelines. Yet the core actions look familiar:</p><ul><li>Generate HTML dynamically based on requests</li><li>Use templating (now called \"components\")</li><li>Rely on CDN caching (Varnish/Nginx did this too)</li></ul><p>Just like MVC in PHP years ago.</p><p>Python‚Äôs seen similar evolution. With Django + HTMX, you get partial updates and no-refresh UX that mirrors the islands architecture. FastAPI + Jinja2? Also capable of server-rendered HTML.</p><p>Many so-called \"modern breakthroughs\" are just old, solid ideas re-wrapped in new abstractions.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  3. The Pain of Polyglot Dev Environments ‚Äî and How I Simplified It\n</h2><p>Modern web development isn't just writing a  file anymore. You're juggling virtual environments, databases, middleware, frontend build chains, Node.js configs,  files, reverse proxies, local HTTPS certs... It gets messy.</p><p>In one FastAPI project I worked on, the frontend was Nuxt 3, the backend used MongoDB, and Redis handled async task queues. Just getting the local dev environment up and running was painful. Debugging was even worse.</p><p>Then I tried .\nIt pre-configured my entire toolchain (Python + FastAPI + MongoDB + Redis + Node.js) into one unified environment that starts with a click.</p><p>It auto-set my  and certificates, offered a visual service dashboard, and let me launch frontend/backend separately without drowning in dependencies.</p><p>As a fullstack dev constantly switching context, ServBay drastically cut down setup overhead and mental fatigue.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  4. Python + Vue/Nuxt: A New Paradigm for Reactive Development\n</h2><p>What excites me most about Python today is how it meshes with the modern frontend.</p><p>Old-school Django favored full-page templates. Now we‚Äôve got:</p><ul><li>: Async-ready, API-first, clean separation of concerns</li><li>: Enable partial updates with server-rendered performance</li><li>: Effortlessly handle background jobs and scheduling</li><li>: Yes, you can even run Python in the browser!</li></ul><p>Put these together and you get something Inertia.js-like: state sharing between frontend and backend, minimal API boilerplate, high-performance responsiveness.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  5. My Stack in Practice: Tools, AI, and Rational Choices\n</h2><p>In my last two projects, here‚Äôs what I used:</p><ul><li>: FastAPI + MongoDB + Celery</li><li>: Nuxt 3 + VueUse</li><li>: Gemini, GitHub Copilot, custom-trained doc assistant</li></ul><p>Speed, deploy time, debugging ease ‚Äî all were dramatically better than what I had back in the LAMP days.</p><p>And it got me thinking: maybe tech isn‚Äôt getting  complex. Maybe we‚Äôre finally building the right abstractions around it ‚Äî via tools, frameworks, and AI.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  6. Final Thoughts: Embracing Complexity Without Losing Sight\n</h2><p>We often say \"complexity is the enemy of engineering.\" But in truth, our reality  complex:</p><ul><li>Business logic is more demanding</li><li>Users expect lightning-fast, personalized experiences</li><li>Teams are more cross-functional than ever</li></ul><p>We can‚Äôt solve all that with one PHP script ‚Äî or even one Python module.</p><ul><li>Use better frameworks to make dev feel intuitive</li><li>Choose the right tooling to simplify setup</li><li>Rely on AI and automation to scale our impact</li></ul><p>That Maxime quote still rings true:</p><blockquote><p>\"The so-called SSR revolution is just us remembering why it worked in the first place.\"</p></blockquote><p>Whether you write PHP, Python, Go, or Java, the end goal remains:<strong>Deliver faster, more reliable services.</strong></p><p>If you‚Äôre stuck juggling languages, wrangling SSR, or overwhelmed by dev environments, give these modern tools a shot.

Deeply inspired by the operas of Richard Wagner and the romanticism of medieval legends, Ludwig envisioned a castle that would embody the spirit of these tales.</p>\nConstruction of the castle began in 1869, but Ludwig never saw its completion. Despite this, Neuschwanstein stands today as a symbol of his eccentricity and love for art and culture. The castle's design draws heavily from Romanesque and Gothic styles, with an interior that reflects Ludwig's passion for opulence and detail.<p>\nExploring the Castle: A Journey Through Time and Fantasy</p>\nVisitors to Neuschwanstein Castle are treated to an immersive experience that combines history with the fantastical elements of Ludwig's imagination. As you step inside, the grandeur of the Throne Room is immediately striking. Inspired by Byzantine architecture, this room is adorned with a magnificent chandelier, intricate mosaics, and a throne platform that was never completed, symbolizing Ludwig‚Äôs unattained aspirations.</p><p>The Singers‚Äô Hall, another highlight, is a tribute to the medieval minstrel culture that Ludwig adored. The room‚Äôs high ceilings, painted frescoes, and exquisite woodwork evoke the grandeur of royal banquets and performances. This hall, much like the entire castle, was dedicated to the legends of knights and heroes, particularly those from Wagner‚Äôs operas.\nOne of the most enchanting rooms is the King‚Äôs Bedroom, a Gothic-inspired space complete with a hand-carved canopy bed and murals depicting scenes from Wagner‚Äôs Tristan and Isolde. The bedroom‚Äôs blue hues, intricate woodwork, and stained glass windows add to the mystical aura, transporting visitors back to a time of chivalry and romance.<p>\n‚ÄúA World of Fantasy Within Walls‚Äù</p>\nNeuschwanstein Castle is often described as ‚Äúa world of fantasy within walls.‚Äù This quote perfectly captures the essence of Ludwig II‚Äôs masterpiece, where every corner and corridor tells a story of myth and legend. The castle‚Äôs interior is adorned with scenes from Germanic sagas, with swans, the symbol of purity and love, appearing frequently throughout the decor.<p>\nLudwig‚Äôs obsession with creating a fantastical world extended to the castle‚Äôs technological advancements as well. Neuschwanstein was equipped with state-of-the-art features for its time, including central heating, running water, and even a telephone line‚Äîtestament to the king‚Äôs forward-thinking mindset.</p>\nThe Surrounding Beauty: Bavarian Alps and Alpsee Lake</p><p>While the castle itself is a marvel, the surrounding landscape is equally captivating. The Bavarian Alps, with their rugged peaks and deep valleys, provide a dramatic backdrop that enhances the fairytale atmosphere of Neuschwanstein. The nearby Alpsee Lake, with its crystal-clear waters, is perfect for a leisurely stroll or boat ride, offering visitors a chance to reflect on the natural beauty that envelops the castle.\nFor those seeking adventure, the nearby <a href=\"https://www.visionaryvogues.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Tegelberg</a> Mountain offers hiking trails with panoramic views of the region.

This 19th-century castle, built by Ludwig's father, King Maximilian II, offers a more intimate glimpse into the royal family‚Äôs life. While Neuschwanstein is known for its grandeur and fantasy, Hohenschwangau provides a contrast with its warm, lived-in feel and historical significance.\nVisitors often combine tours of both castles, gaining a deeper understanding of Ludwig‚Äôs upbringing and the influences that shaped his vision for Neuschwanstein. The two castles, each unique in their own right, together tell the story of a king who was both a dreamer and a realist.<p>\n‚ÄúAn Unfinished Symphony in Stone‚Äù</p>\nNeuschwanstein Castle is often referred to as ‚Äúan unfinished symphony in stone,‚Äù a metaphor that reflects both its incomplete construction and the unfulfilled dreams of King Ludwig II. The king‚Äôs tragic death in 1886, under mysterious circumstances, left many aspects of the castle unfinished. Despite this, the castle's allure remains undiminished, attracting millions of visitors who come to marvel at its beauty and contemplate the enigmatic figure behind its creation.<p>\nPractical Tips for Visiting Neuschwanstein Castle</p>\nFor travelers planning a visit to Neuschwanstein Castle, a few practical tips can enhance the experience:</p><p>Timing: To avoid the crowds, plan your visit early in the morning or later in the afternoon, especially during peak tourist season (May to September). Booking tickets in advance is highly recommended, as the castle‚Äôs popularity means that tours often sell out quickly.\nGetting There: Neuschwanstein is located near the town of F√ºssen, approximately a two-hour drive from Munich. Visitors can reach the castle by car, train, or through guided tours. From F√ºssen, buses and horse-drawn carriages are available to transport visitors up the steep hill to the castle.<p>\nWhat to Bring: Comfortable walking shoes are essential, as there is a fair amount of walking involved, especially if you choose to explore the surrounding trails. Don‚Äôt forget your camera‚Äîthere are countless photo opportunities, from the castle itself to the breathtaking views of the Bavarian Alps.</p>\nSeasonal Considerations: Each season offers a different experience. In summer, the vibrant greenery and blooming flowers create a picture-perfect scene, while winter brings a magical, snow-covered landscape that adds to the castle‚Äôs fairytale appeal.<p>\nConclusion: A Timeless Journey to the Heart of Bavaria</p>\nNeuschwanstein Castle is more than just a tourist attraction; it is a symbol of the enduring power of dreams and the human desire to create beauty in the world. Whether you‚Äôre a history buff, a lover of architecture, or simply someone who appreciates the finer things in life, a visit to Neuschwanstein is sure to leave a lasting impression.<p>\nAs you walk through the halls that once echoed with the dreams of a king, you‚Äôll find yourself transported to a different time‚Äîa time when legends were born, and fairy tales came to life. In the words of King Ludwig II, ‚ÄúI want to remain an eternal mystery to myself and others.‚Äù And indeed, Neuschwanstein Castle, with all its beauty and enigma, continues to captivate the imaginations of those who visit, offering a timeless journey to the heart of Bavaria.</p>\nUncover the latest trends and insights with our articles on Visionary Vogues</p>","contentLength":7684,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Recognizing SEMI OCR Font with Python and Dynamsoft Capture Vision SDK","url":"https://dev.to/yushulx/recognizing-semi-ocr-font-with-python-and-dynamsoft-capture-vision-sdk-4n53","date":1751533224,"author":"Xiao Ling","guid":182910,"unread":true,"content":"<p><strong>SEMI (Semiconductor Equipment and Materials International) font</strong> is a special dot matrix font used for marking silicon wafers.

Multiply that by the number of stale or abandoned projects on your machine, and you may be surprised how much space is quietly being eaten up.</p><p>That‚Äôs where the <strong>Virtual Environment Analyzer</strong> comes in.</p><p>This lightweight Python utility scans your directories, detects virtual environments, analyzes their size and last access time, and gives you a clear picture of where your disk space is going. </p><p>Even better‚Äîit can help you clean up by safely removing the largest or most outdated environments with just a couple of prompts. Whether you're a solo developer or managing shared machines, this tool brings order to virtual environment chaos.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  The Problem: Virtual Environment Bloat\n</h2><p>Virtual environments are a essential to Python development. </p><p>They allow developers to isolate dependencies for each project, ensuring that packages don‚Äôt clash or interfere with one another. </p><p>Whether you‚Äôre working on a Django web app, experimenting with machine learning models, or following along with a tutorial, chances are you‚Äôve created a dedicated virtual environment for each task.</p><p>This practice is not only encouraged, it‚Äôs necessary for clean, reproducible development. </p><p>But over time, the benefits can start to backfire. Developers may accumulate <strong>dozens of virtual environments</strong> across different directories, most of which are no longer in active use.</p><p>This leads to a few common problems:</p><ul><li><p>: Each virtual environment can take up hundreds of megabytes, or even gigabytes, especially when they include heavy dependencies. Multiply that by the number of forgotten environments, and the total can quickly balloon.</p></li><li><p>: Virtual environments don‚Äôt usually announce themselves. They sit quietly in project folders, system directories, or tucked away under  names, making them easy to overlook during routine cleanup.</p></li><li><p>: Large or deeply nested environments can significantly slow down system backups, antivirus scans, or file indexing processes, all adding unnecessary overhead for environments you no longer need.</p></li></ul><p>The result? A bloated development environment that‚Äôs harder to manage, slower to operate, and increasingly difficult to clean up manually.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Meet the Tool: Virtual Environment Analyzer\n</h2><p>Enter the <strong>Virtual Environment Analyzer</strong>, a lightweight yet powerful Python tool designed to help you take back control of your development environment.</p><p>This command-line utility scans your file system to <strong>detect, analyze, and optionally clean up</strong> Python virtual environments. </p><p>It intelligently identifies common venv folders (like , , , etc.) and checks for standard signs of a Python environment such as , activation scripts, or  and  folders. </p><p>Once detected, it measures the size of each environment, checks when it was last accessed, and gives you an organized report.</p><ul><li><p>: Instantly find out how many virtual environments are lurking in your directories and how much space they‚Äôre consuming.</p></li><li><p><strong>Detect Forgotten or Unused Environments</strong>: Using access time analysis, the tool flags environments that haven‚Äôt been used in weeks or months, which are perfect for safe cleanup.</p></li><li><p>: Built-in cleanup modes let you delete the <strong>top 5 largest environments</strong> or all those <strong>unused for a configurable number of days</strong>, all with clear prompts and double confirmation for safety.</p></li><li><p><strong>Flexible and User-Friendly</strong>: Whether you want a quick overview or a deep cleanup session, the analyzer offers a range of options like verbose output, custom directory scanning, depth limits, and more.</p></li></ul><p>It‚Äôs the perfect companion for Python developers who want to keep their workspace clean, efficient, and clutter-free, all without the hassle of manual inspection or risky deletion scripts.</p><p>The <strong>Virtual Environment Analyzer</strong> is designed to be both powerful and practical. </p><p>It combines robust detection, smart analysis, and cautious cleanup functionality to help you manage your Python environments safely. </p><p>Here's a closer look at what it offers.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Comprehensive Venv Detection\n</h3><p>The tool intelligently scans directories for virtual environments using a combination of naming patterns and internal file structure analysis. </p><p>It doesn‚Äôt just rely on folder names, it looks under the hood to verify if a folder is truly a Python venv.</p><p><strong>Detection strategies include:</strong></p><ul><li><p>Recognizing common folder names:</p><ul><li>, , , </li></ul></li><li><p>Checking for venv-specific markers:    </p><ul><li>Activation scripts (, , etc.)</li></ul></li></ul><p>This dual-layer approach ensures reliable identification, even when environments are hidden in deeply nested or custom-named folders.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Size and Access Time Analysis\n</h3><p>Once virtual environments are detected, the tool analyzes each one for size and usage history.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Human-Readable Size Reports:</strong> Each venv‚Äôs size is displayed in KB, MB, or GB, making it easy to spot disk hogs at a glance.</p></li><li><p> The tool examines the last accessed timestamp of key venv files, like Python executables, config files, and activation scripts, to determine if an environment has been used recently.</p></li></ul><p>This helps you quickly identify which environments are active and which are candidates for removal.</p><p>To help you reclaim disk space, the analyzer provides two optional cleanup modes:</p><ul><li><p> Sorts all found environments by size and allows you to delete the five biggest ones, ideal for a fast disk space recovery.</p></li><li><p> Automatically detects and deletes environments that haven‚Äôt been accessed in a user-defined number of days (e.g., 30, 60, or 90+ days).</p></li></ul><p>Each mode includes a clear preview of what will be deleted, how much space will be freed, and how recently each environment was used.</p><p>Cleanup features are built with developer safety in mind:</p><ul><li><p> You‚Äôll be asked to confirm deletion twice, including typing , to avoid accidental data loss.</p></li><li><p> Permission errors, inaccessible files, and deletion issues are all caught and reported without crashing the script.</p></li></ul><p>This ensures that even in large, complex directories, the tool remains stable, safe, and predictable.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  How It Works Under the Hood\n</h2><p>The <strong>Virtual Environment Analyzer</strong> works using a sequence of smart file system operations to identify, assess, and clean up Python virtual environments (venvs). </p><p>Here‚Äôs a breakdown of what happens behind the scenes:</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Directory Scanning with Depth Control\n</h3><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>The script begins by scanning the specified root directory recursively, using  and  to traverse subdirectories. </p><p>You can limit how deep it goes via the  argument. This is useful for avoiding unnecessary traversal into deeply nested folders.</p><ul><li>Avoids permission errors with safe try-except blocks.</li><li>Allows unlimited depth if not specified.</li><li>Skips hidden or inaccessible folders.</li></ul><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>As each folder is visited, the tool checks whether it resembles a virtual environment. </p><p>It uses both  (like , , etc.) and <em>structure-based indicators</em> (presence of , , , or  scripts).</p><ul><li>Detects both standard and unconventional venv naming patterns.</li><li>Works across platforms (Unix and Windows).</li><li>Can handle custom-named or renamed venvs.</li></ul><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Once a venv is identified, the tool calculates its total disk usage. It sums the sizes of all regular files inside the folder tree using .</p><ul><li>Ignores unreadable files to prevent crashes.</li><li>Skips symlinks and non-file objects.</li><li>Outputs size in human-readable form with .</li></ul><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>The tool then evaluates when the venv was last accessed. It checks not only the folder itself but also important venv files (like , , ) to get the most accurate timestamp.</p><ul><li>Uses  to fetch last access times.</li><li>Marks venvs as \"unused\" if not touched in  days.</li><li>Sorts unused venvs by oldest access time to prioritize deletion.</li></ul><h3>\n  \n  \n  Interactive Cleanup Process\n</h3><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>If any unused venvs are found, the script offers an optional cleanup step. You‚Äôll be prompted with a summary and asked to confirm before deletion.

You can freely choose the format for how dates are displayed,  while keeping the underlying value a true numeric date. This makes it easy to display dates in various ways without affecting filtering or sorting. Python (using pandas) uses datetime64(ns) type and stores timestamps. This is efficient but it works differently from SAS.</p><p><strong>2. Working with formatted dates</strong></p><p>As I have just mentioned, SAS separates date values from their display format. You can show a date as , , or however you like, and still filter and sort as if it is a number. It is very convenient for reporting.</p><p>In Python, however, if you want to show a date formatted like \"31/12/2025\", you typically use , which converts the datetime object to a string.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>As I quickly learned, this is not an option in most cases because strings don‚Äôt sort chronologically the same way as datetime objects do. </p><p>\nKeep everything (or convert early to) in  and stay in this format for as long as possible. Do your logic, filtering, and sorting with objects. Only format to string at the very final step, for example, when exporting data to Excel, CSV, or creating a report where the recipient expects a specific format. This ensures your data is consistent and behaves correctly. </p><p><strong>3. Maximum date limitation</strong></p><p>In SAS using  as the maximum or an open-ended date is totally acceptable as it is treated as a valid numeric date.</p><p>But in pandas the maximum allowed date is 2262-04-11 (corresponding to datetime <code>2262-04-11 23:47:16.854775807</code> üòÖ). So, when we wanted to repeat SAS report logic with  in Python, we got an out-of-bounds error:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Here are three practical strategies how to handle it in Python. Let‚Äôs check an example below.</p><p>\nWe are fetching data from the server where the end_date is  for active rows. We have Tom, William, and Olivia as an employees. We want to generate a report showing their salaries on reporting date 2025-06-30. </p><div><table><thead><tr></tr></thead><tbody><tr></tr><tr></tr><tr></tr><tr></tr><tr></tr></tbody></table></div><p><strong><em>1. Use a substitute max date like 2262-04-11</em></strong></p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>If you must show , and logic doesn‚Äôt depend on datetime operations you can just use string, you can leave it as  or replace with some meaningful documented word, such as:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>This approach, however, is not suitable for sorting or comparisons, so only use for display or export.</p><p>In the scanario given above, we should still convert to  as we want to filter valid rows for the given reporting date.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p><strong><em>3. Use native  ( dtype)</em></strong></p><p>If you need more range but want to retain datetime objects use Python‚Äôs built-in datetime type.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>This stores the column as object instead of datetime64, so you lose vectorized operations but keep date accuracy up to year 9999. This allows correct sorting, but performance is slower.</p><p>We are spoiled by SAS which gives a lot of flexibility when it comes to handling dates. Sometimes it can be a bit of a headache when everyone in your team prefers different formatting when creating a report :). So, I actually like that Python is strict and limited to timestamps.

One of the most important concepts that powers Django is the MVT architecture, which stands for:‚Äì represents the data structure</p><p>‚Äì handles presentation</p><p>Although it's inspired by the MVC (Model-View-Controller) pattern, Django takes a slightly different approach by introducing Templates instead of Controllers. That said, Django doesn‚Äôt force you to stick to a particular architecture ‚Äî you can organize your app the way that works best for you.</p><p>\nIn Django, a model defines the structure of your database tables. Each model is a Python class that inherits from models.Model, and each attribute maps to a database field.</p><p><code>python\nclass Users(models.Model):<p>\n    full_name = models.CharField(max_length=200)</p>\n    bio = models.TextField()\n        return self.full_name</code>The above example will generate a Users table with full_name and bio as its columns.</p><p>Models contain all the necessary fields and behavior for your data. They're the layer that handles all your database interactions ‚Äî from creation to querying.</p><p>\nA view is where your logic lives. It‚Äôs a function or class that processes a request and returns a response. It may fetch data from the model and pass it to the template, or return a redirect or even JSON.</p><p><code>python\nCopy\ndef users_list(request):<p>\n    users = Users.objects.all()</p>\n    return render(request, 'users/users_list.html', {'users': users})</code>The above function gets all Users from the database and passes them to a template named <a href=\"https://dev.tourl\">users_list.html</a>. Views are usually stored in a file called  inside your app.</p><p>\nTemplates are HTML files that allow you to display dynamic content using Django‚Äôs templating language. They include special syntax to loop over data, show variables, or include conditional statements.</p><div><pre><code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;\n&lt;html&gt;\n&lt;head&gt;\n    &lt;title&gt;My Users&lt;/title&gt;\n&lt;/head&gt;\n&lt;body&gt;\n    &lt;h1&gt;All Users&lt;/h1&gt;\n    {% for user in users %}\n        &lt;div&gt;\n            &lt;h2&gt;{{ user.full_name }}&lt;/h2&gt;\n            &lt;p&gt;{{ user.bio }}&lt;/p&gt;\n        &lt;/div&gt;\n    {% empty %}\n        &lt;p&gt;No users available.&lt;/p&gt;\n    {% endfor %}\n&lt;/body&gt;\n&lt;/html&gt;\n\n</code></pre></div><p>In this example, the template loops through the list of users and renders each one. If the list is empty, it shows a fallback message.</p><p>\nTo make your view accessible via a browser, you need to connect it to a URL pattern.</p><p><code>python\nfrom django.urls import path\nurlpatterns = [<p>\n    path('', views.users_list, name='users_list'),</p>\n]</code>This connects the root URL (/) of your app to the users_list view.</p><p>\nHere‚Äôs a quick rundown of how Django‚Äôs MVT pattern flows:</p><p>A request comes from the browser</p><p>sends the request to the right view</p><p>The view fetches data from the model</p><p>The data is passed to a template</p><p>The template renders a response as HTML</p><p>\nDjango‚Äôs MVT architecture breaks your app into three key parts:</p><p>Manages the structure and interaction with the database</p><p>Handles business logic and request processing</p><p>Takes care of rendering the UI</p><p>This separation makes your code cleaner, easier to manage, and scalable as your project grows.</p><p>Want to take this further?

You can use JWTs to offer fine-grained, role-based access to the Tinybird MCP Server.</li><li>: Your Tinybird endpoints become callable functions that agents can use to fetch pre-calculated metrics.</li><li>: The built-in  tool allows the agent to spawn  a server-side subagent with understanding data and developing queries.</li><li>: Generate SQL queries with schema context.</li><li>: Directly query the data sources.</li><li>: List and query service data sources (those that contain your workspace logs) for debugging and performance monitoring.</li></ol><h3>\n  \n  \n  Configure the Tinybird MCP Server\n</h3><p>Let's give our agent access to the tools made available via the Tinybird MCP Server.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><h3>\n  \n  \n  Understand MCP tool capabilities\n</h3><p>The Tinybird MCP Server provides several tools automatically:</p><ul><li>: Natural language data exploration</li><li>: See available API endpoints\n</li><li>: Run direct SQL queries</li><li>: Direct access to each of your Tinybird endpoints</li></ul><p>Example of using specific endpoint tools:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><h2>\n  \n  \n  Step 4: Design system prompts and instructions\n</h2><p>Effective prompt design is crucial for analytics agents (or any agent, for that matter). Here's how we recommend structuring prompts for different use cases.</p><p>Create a generalized system prompt to help the agent understand its core role:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>You can then provide further instructional prompts, or \"missions\", depending on the contents of your Tinybird workspace and how you want the agent to analyze your data, for example:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Here's how you might define an agent with a static system prompt and flexible missions:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Finally, user prompts and conversations direct the actions of the analytics agent:</p><div><pre><code>Show me the top 5 pages by pageviews in the last 30 days\n</code></pre></div><div><pre><code>Which of those pages has the highest form submission conversion rate?\n</code></pre></div><div><pre><code>Which referrers get me the most traffic to the top converting page?\n</code></pre></div><p>And so on. The Agno framework allows the agent to retain memory and context from a user session. It responds to each user prompt within the context of its system prompt, mission prompt, and the tools available to it.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Step 5: Configure agent output options\n</h2><p>Your analytics agent can deliver insights through multiple channels and even trigger new agents to process its findings. Here are a few options for output with implementation examples.</p><p>The simplest option for development and testing:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>You can use an email provider like Resent to generate and send automated email reports:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>For complex analytics scenarios or when you want other agents to take action on the insights found by your analytics agent, orchestrate multiple specialized agents:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><h2>\n  \n  \n  Step 6: Add advanced features and production considerations\n</h2><h3>\n  \n  \n  Manage memory and context\n</h3><p>Implement persistent memory for better contextual understanding:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><h3>\n  \n  \n  Handle errors and build resilience\n</h3><p>Implement robust error handling:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>You can easily deploy your Tinybird resources to a production cloud environment:</p><p>Deploy your agent using Docker and container orchestration:</p><div><pre><code>pip  requirements.txt\n\n</code></pre></div><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Analytics agents like those you can build with Agno and Tinybird can change how organizations and their customers interact with data.

It‚Äôs designed to help developers build clean, efficient, and scalable web apps fast.</p><p>At the heart of Django is something called the MVT architecture, which stands for Model, View, Template. It‚Äôs pretty similar to the well-known MVC (Model-View-Controller) pattern, just with some tweaks in terminology that make sense in Django‚Äôs world.\nDjango uses the MVT structure to keep your code organized and maintainable. Let‚Äôs break down what that means:<strong>Models ‚Äî Your Database Tables</strong>\nIn Django, a Model is simply a Python class that defines the structure of your database table. It handles all the data creating, reading, updating, and deleting.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>When you define a model like Users, Django creates a corresponding database table behind the scenes. It‚Äôs clean, simple, and powerful.\nViews in Django are Python functions or classes that handle incoming requests and return responses ‚Äî like HTML pages, JSON, redirects, etc.<p>\nThey interact with your models to get data and pass it to templates for display.</p>\nExample:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>This view fetches all users from the database and sends them to a template for display.<strong>Templates ‚Äî The User Interface</strong>\nA Template is basically your HTML file. It contains placeholders where dynamic data from your views shows up. Django comes with its own templating language, but you can also use alternatives like Jinja2.</p><div><pre><code>My UsersAll Users\n    {% for user in users %}\n        {{ user.full_name }}{{ user.bio }}\n    {% empty %}\n        No users available.\n    {% endfor %}\n</code></pre></div><p>Simple, clean, and easy to work with.<strong>URLs ‚Äî Connecting the Pieces</strong>\nTo make your views accessible via the browser, you define URL patterns like this:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Now when someone visits your site, they‚Äôll hit your view, which talks to your model and renders the template.</p><p>\nThe MVT structure keeps things tidy:\nView: Contains your logic<p>\nTemplate: Displays the output</p>\nThis separation makes your code cleaner and your project easier to scale as it grows.</p><p>Hope this clears up how Django apps are structured!\nIf you have questions or want me to explain anything deeper, drop a comment below.</p>","contentLength":2126,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Day 1 of 100daysofML","url":"https://dev.to/glazngbun/day-1-of-100daysofml-50np","date":1751477146,"author":"Pratyay Pal","guid":180925,"unread":true,"content":"<p>Hi everyone ive decided to journal my journey of learning ml from scratch.

That means more privacy, better speed, and zero cost for each query you run.</p><p>In this blog, we will be looking into the CHAT feature of Model HQ that helps us to create a chatbot running locally on our machine.</p><p>üëâ Download or Buy Model HQ for Windows</p><p>Not ready to buy? No problem.</p><p>üëâ Join the 90-Day Free Developer Trial</p><p>Once installed, you‚Äôll have access to an interface that feels like your own AI control panel.</p><p>Step 2: Choosing the Right AI Model\nOnce installation is done, open the ModelHQ application, and then you will be prompted to add a setup method. The setup guide is provided after buying the application.</p><p>After this, you will land in the main menu. Now, click on the Chat button.</p><p>You‚Äôll be prompted to select an AI model. If you‚Äôre unsure which model to choose, you can click on ‚Äúchoose for me,‚Äù and the application will select a suitable model based on your needs. Model HQ comes up with 100+ models.</p><p>Available Model Options:\nSmall Model:<p>\n~1‚Äì 3 billion parameters:- Fastest response time, suitable for basic chat.</p></p><p>Medium Model:\n~7‚Äì 8 billion parameters:- Balanced performance, ideal for chat, data analysis, and standard RAG tasks.</p><p>Large Model:\n~9 ‚Äì up to 32 billion parameters:- Most powerful chat, RAG, and best for advanced and complex analytical workloads.</p><p>By the way, Model HQ will pick a smart default based on your system and use case.</p><p>The size of the model you choose can significantly impact both speed and output quality. Smaller models are faster but may provide less detailed responses. Follow this simple rule:</p><p>Step 3. Downloading Models\nFor demonstration purposes, we are selecting the Small Model.</p><p>If no models have been downloaded previously (e.g., in the No Setup, Fast Setup, or Full Setup paths), the selected model will begin downloading automatically.</p><p>This process typically takes 2‚Äì7 minutes, depending on the model you selected and your internet speed. </p><p>This is only a one-time internet requirement; once the models are downloaded, you don‚Äôt need internet anymore.</p><p>Step 4: Start Chatting\nOnce you‚Äôve selected a model, you can start a chat by typing in your questions. For example, you might ask a simple question like, ‚ÄúWhat are the top sites to see in Paris?‚Äù The model will generate a response based on its training data.</p><p>Customizing Your Chat Experience\nModel HQ allows you to customize your chat experience further. You can adjust settings such as the maximum output length and the randomness of the responses (known as temperature). By default, the app is set to generate up to 1,000 tokens, which is usually sufficient for smaller models. However, even if you‚Äôre using larger models, be cautious about increasing this limit, as it can consume more memory and take longer to generate responses. So, in short, you can adjust generation settings:</p><p>Max Tokens: How long should the response be?</p><p>Temperature: Should the answer be creative or precise?</p><p>Stop/Restart: Hit ‚ùå to stop a long generation anytime.</p><p>Step 5: Integrating Sources for Enhanced Responses\nOne of the standout features of Model HQ is its ability to integrate sources, such as documents and images, into your chat. To do this, simply click on the ‚Äúsource‚Äù button and upload a file, such as a PDF or Word document.</p><p>Example: Using a Document as a Source\nFor instance, if you upload an executive employment agreement, you can ask specific questions about the clauses within the document. The model will reference the uploaded document to provide accurate answers. This feature is invaluable for fact-checking and ensuring that you have the right information at your fingertips.</p><p>Chatting with Images\nModel HQ also allows you to chat with images. By uploading an image, the application can analyze the content and answer questions based on what it sees. This capability opens up a world of possibilities for multimedia processing, all done locally on your machine without any additional costs.</p><p>Step 6: Saving and Downloading Results\nAfter you‚Äôve finished your session, you can save the chat results for future reference. This is particularly useful if you need to compile information for reports or presentations. Simply download the results, and you‚Äôll have everything you need at your fingertips.</p><p>Step 7: Exploring Advanced Features\nAs you become more comfortable with Model HQ, you can explore its advanced features. For example, you can experiment with different models to see how they perform with various types of queries. You can also adjust the generation settings to fine-tune the responses based on your specific needs.</p><p>If you‚Äôre a visual learner, then watch this YouTube walkthrough:</p><p>Future Updates and Community Engagement\nStay engaged with the Model HQ community by following their updates and tutorials on platforms like YouTube.

Its interpreted nature and automatic memory management often lead to the perception that it is unsuitable for \"low-level\" programming tasks‚Äîthose requiring direct interaction with hardware, operating system internals, or fine-grained memory control. However, this perception, while rooted in Python's design philosophy, doesn't tell the whole story. This article delves into the capabilities and mechanisms that enable Python to venture into the realm of low-level programming, demonstrating its surprising versatility.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  2.

A  is a string that contains placeholders‚Äîspecial markers representing variable values‚Äîthat you can dynamically replace at runtime.</p><p>You‚Äôll often use templates to generate text or structured content by filling these placeholders with actual data. Before Python 3.14, the language provided several tools that allowed you to interpolate and format values in your strings:</p><p>You can use all these tools to create and process string templates. Of course, each has its own unique strengths and weaknesses.</p><p>The string formatting operator (), inspired by C‚Äôs <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Printf\"></a> syntax, is the oldest string formatting and interpolation tool in Python. Here‚Äôs a quick example of how you can use this operator to create and process templates:</p><p>In this example, you have two variables containing data. The first contains a string, and the second holds an integer value. Then, you define a string template using the  and  syntax to define  or . The  means that the first field must be filled with a string, and the  indicates that the field accepts decimal integer values. These are known as <a href=\"https://realpython.com/python-modulo-string-formatting/#convert-values-using-a-conversion-type\">conversion types</a>.</p><p>Finally, you use the  operator to dynamically interpolate the variables‚Äô content into the template and build a new string.</p><p>This operator also allows you to apply formatting rules to the input values. For example, here‚Äôs how you can format currency values:</p><p>In this example, the template contains the literal dollar sign () to indicate that the formatted value represents a USD amount. The  character is not part of the formatting syntax itself but part of the output.</p><p>Then, you have a replacement field that starts with the string formatting operator () followed by the string .

The root cause wasn‚Äôt a vulnerability in the data storage itself, but a flawed authorization check within a custom ETL process. Specifically, a poorly implemented role-based access control (RBAC) system allowed a service account with limited permissions to inadvertently access and process data it shouldn‚Äôt have. This incident highlighted a painful truth: authorization isn‚Äôt just a ‚Äúnice-to-have‚Äù; it‚Äôs a foundational element of any production Python system dealing with sensitive data or critical functionality.  Modern Python ecosystems ‚Äì cloud-native microservices, data pipelines built with Airflow or Prefect, web APIs using FastAPI or Django, and even machine learning operations ‚Äì all rely heavily on robust authorization mechanisms.  This post dives deep into the practicalities of building and maintaining these systems.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  What is \"authorization\" in Python?\n</h3><p>Authorization, in a technical context, is the process of determining  a given subject (user, service account, process) is permitted to do with a resource. It‚Äôs distinct from , which verifies  the subject is.  While Python doesn‚Äôt have a built-in, standardized authorization framework at the CPython level (no PEP directly addresses this), the ecosystem provides numerous libraries and patterns.  The typing system, particularly with  and , plays a crucial role in defining authorization contracts.  Standard library modules like  (Abstract Base Classes) are often used to define authorization policies as interfaces.  The core principle is to enforce access control  successful authentication.</p><ol><li><p><strong>FastAPI Request Handling:</strong>  In a REST API, authorization determines if a user can access a specific endpoint or perform a particular action (e.g., ).  We use dependency injection with FastAPI‚Äôs security framework to inject authorization logic based on JWT claims.</p></li><li><p><strong>Async Job Queues (Celery/RQ):</strong>  When processing tasks asynchronously, authorization ensures that a worker can only execute tasks assigned to its role.  This prevents malicious or misconfigured workers from accessing sensitive data or performing unauthorized operations.  We‚Äôve implemented custom Celery task decorators that check permissions before task execution.</p></li><li><p><strong>Type-Safe Data Models (Pydantic):</strong>  Pydantic models can be used to enforce data access restrictions.  For example, a  model might have fields accessible only to administrators.  This is achieved through custom validation logic and property access control.</p></li><li><p>  Command-line interfaces often require authorization to control access to sensitive commands or configuration options.  We use  and custom decorators to implement RBAC for our internal CLI tools.</p></li><li><p>  In machine learning pipelines, authorization controls access to training data and model artifacts.  This prevents unauthorized modification or leakage of sensitive information.  We integrate authorization checks into our feature store access layer.</p></li></ol><h3>\n  \n  \n  Integration with Python Tooling\n</h3><p>Our  reflects our commitment to static analysis and type safety:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>We leverage ‚Äôs strict mode to catch authorization-related type errors early.  Pydantic models are heavily used to define data schemas and enforce validation rules, including authorization constraints.  We use  fixtures to mock authorization services and test different access scenarios.  Runtime hooks, implemented as custom decorators, intercept function calls and enforce authorization policies.  Logging is crucial; we log all authorization attempts (successes and failures) with detailed context.</p><p>Here's a simplified example of a permission check using a decorator:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>This demonstrates a simple RBAC pattern.  A more sophisticated system would use a dedicated authorization service (e.g., Open Policy Agent) and a more complex permission model.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Failure Scenarios &amp; Debugging\n</h3><p>A common failure is incorrect permission evaluation due to logic errors in the authorization code.  We once had a bug where a bitwise AND operation was used instead of a bitwise OR, resulting in overly restrictive permissions.  Debugging involved using  to step through the authorization logic and inspect the permission flags.  Another issue was an async race condition in a Celery worker, where multiple tasks were attempting to access the same resource concurrently without proper locking.  This was identified using  to pinpoint the performance bottleneck and  to trace the execution flow.  Runtime assertions are also critical; we use them to verify that authorization checks are being performed as expected.  Exception traces are invaluable, but they need to be enriched with contextual information (user ID, resource ID, timestamp) to be truly useful.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Performance &amp; Scalability\n</h3><p>Authorization checks can add significant overhead, especially in high-throughput systems.  We‚Äôve benchmarked different authorization strategies using  and .  Avoiding global state is crucial; caching authorization decisions can improve performance, but requires careful invalidation strategies.  Reducing allocations (e.g., using  instead of regular classes) can also help.  For extremely performance-critical applications, we‚Äôve considered using C extensions to implement authorization logic in C, but this adds complexity and maintenance overhead.  We also leverage database indexing to speed up permission lookups.</p><p>Insecure deserialization of authorization data (e.g., JWT claims) can lead to code injection or privilege escalation.  We strictly validate all input data and use trusted sources for authorization information.  Improper sandboxing can allow unauthorized access to resources.  We use containerization (Docker) and resource limits to isolate services and prevent privilege escalation.  Regular security audits and penetration testing are essential.</p><p>We employ a multi-layered testing strategy.  Unit tests verify the correctness of individual authorization functions.  Integration tests ensure that authorization works correctly in the context of the entire system.  Property-based tests (using Hypothesis) generate random inputs to uncover edge cases.   enforces type safety, and  runs all tests with code coverage reporting.  Our CI/CD pipeline (GitHub Actions) includes static analysis, type checking, and automated testing.  We also use pre-commit hooks to enforce code style and prevent common authorization-related errors.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Common Pitfalls &amp; Anti-Patterns\n</h3><ol><li>  Makes the system inflexible and difficult to maintain.</li><li>  Failing to consider the context of the authorization request (e.g., time of day, location).</li><li><strong>Overly Permissive Defaults:</strong>  Granting more permissions than necessary.</li><li>  Not logging authorization attempts for security and debugging purposes.</li><li><strong>Mixing Authorization and Business Logic:</strong>  Separation of concerns is crucial for maintainability.</li><li><strong>Relying Solely on Client-Side Authorization:</strong>  Always validate permissions on the server-side.</li></ol><h3>\n  \n  \n  Best Practices &amp; Architecture\n</h3><ul><li> Use typing extensively to define authorization contracts.</li><li>  Isolate authorization logic from business logic.</li><li>  Validate all input data and handle errors gracefully.</li><li>  Design authorization components as reusable modules.</li><li>  Use configuration files to manage permissions and roles.</li><li>  Inject authorization services into components that require them.</li><li>  Automate testing, deployment, and monitoring.</li><li>  Ensure that builds are consistent and reliable.</li><li>  Document the authorization architecture and policies.</li></ul><p>Mastering authorization is paramount for building robust, scalable, and maintainable Python systems.  The incident in 2022 served as a stark reminder of the consequences of neglecting this critical aspect of software development.  Refactor legacy code to incorporate proper authorization checks, measure performance to identify bottlenecks, write comprehensive tests, and enforce linters and type gates.  Investing in authorization upfront will save you significant headaches ‚Äì and potential data breaches ‚Äì down the road.</p>","contentLength":8079,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Spell Checker-Predicting Correct Word-NLP-Part 1","url":"https://dev.to/datatoinfinity/spell-checker-predicting-correct-word-nlp-part-1-5g3f","date":1751459025,"author":"datatoinfinity","guid":180514,"unread":true,"content":"<li><p> might return: , , ..., , , ...,  (104 total)</p></li><li><p> might return: , , , ...</p></li><li><p> might return: , </p></li><li><p> might return: , , ..., ,  (130 total)</p></li><li><p>Then the combined  removes overlaps.</p></li>","contentLength":160,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Top Industries Benefiting from Partnering with an Enterprise AI Development Company","url":"https://dev.to/sparkout/top-industries-benefiting-from-partnering-with-an-enterprise-ai-development-company-25mg","date":1751458006,"author":"AI Development Company","guid":180513,"unread":true,"content":"<p>The rapid evolution of Artificial Intelligence has transformed it from a futuristic concept into an indispensable strategic asset for businesses across the globe.

The allure of enhancing customer service, streamlining operations, and driving sales with intelligent automation is undeniable. However, a crucial fork in the road often appears: should you embark on building an AI chatbot in-house, or is partnering with a specialized <a href=\"https://www.sparkouttech.com/ai-chatbot-development/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">AI Chatbot Development Company</a> the smarter move? This isn't just a technical decision; it's a strategic one with significant implications for your Return on Investment (ROI).</p><p>While the \"do-it-yourself\" (DIY) approach might initially seem more cost-effective due to avoiding external vendor fees, the reality is often far more complex. Understanding the true costs and benefits of each path is essential for making an informed choice that truly delivers value.</p><p><strong>The Allure and Hidden Pitfalls of DIY Bot Development</strong>\nThe appeal of developing a chatbot in-house is clear. You might have an existing IT team, access to various no-code or low-code platforms, and the desire for complete control over the development process. This can feel like a way to save money and ensure the bot aligns perfectly with your internal vision.</p><p><strong>However, the \"savings\" often mask significant hidden costs and limitations:</strong></p><p>Lack of Specialized Expertise: Building an effective AI chatbot requires a very specific skill set: natural language processing (NLP) engineers, data scientists, conversational designers, and AI ethicists. Most internal IT teams, while highly capable, lack this specialized depth. Training existing staff can be time-consuming and expensive, diverting them from their core responsibilities.</p><p>Limited Capabilities and Performance: DIY bots, especially those built on basic no-code platforms, often struggle with complex queries, understanding nuance, or maintaining context across conversations. They might be able to handle simple FAQs, but they quickly hit a wall when faced with dynamic or intricate user interactions. This leads to frustrated users and a high rate of escalation to human agents, negating efficiency gains.</p><p>Suboptimal User Experience: Without expert conversational design, DIY bots can sound robotic, repetitive, or fail to understand user intent accurately. A clunky, frustrating chatbot experience can actively damage your brand reputation and drive customers away, eroding trust rather than building it.</p><p>Scalability Challenges: As your business grows or customer inquiries increase, a hastily built DIY bot can buckle under pressure. Scaling an in-house solution to handle higher volumes or new features can become a massive technical undertaking, requiring significant unplanned resources.</p><p>Ongoing Maintenance and Updates: AI models require continuous monitoring, retraining with new data, and performance optimization to remain effective. Keeping up with evolving user language, new product offerings, and emerging AI technologies is a full-time job. An internal team might struggle to dedicate the necessary continuous effort, leading to bot decay and diminished performance over time.</p><p>Security and Compliance Risks: Handling customer data, especially sensitive information, demands stringent security protocols and adherence to regulations like GDPR or HIPAA. Without dedicated expertise in secure AI development, DIY bots can inadvertently introduce significant vulnerabilities, leading to data breaches and costly legal repercussions.</p><p><strong>The Strategic Advantages of Partnering with an AI Chatbot Development Company</strong>\nIn contrast to the DIY approach, collaborating with a dedicated AI Chatbot Development Company transforms the entire equation. These firms specialize in delivering robust, intelligent, and scalable conversational AI solutions.</p><p><strong>Here's how a professional partnership delivers superior ROI:</strong></p><p><strong>1.

These products span the investment spectrum, including actively managed funds, index funds, ETFs, and alternative investments.\nOne of BlackRock‚Äôs most notable strategies is its emphasis on long-term, value-driven investing. The firm‚Äôs investment philosophy is grounded in the belief that markets are generally efficient, but that opportunities for excess returns exist in certain areas. BlackRock‚Äôs portfolio managers are encouraged to take a long-term perspective, focusing on fundamental analysis and valuation to identify mispriced assets.<p>\nThis value-driven approach is complemented by BlackRock‚Äôs focus on risk management. The firm‚Äôs roots in risk management are evident in its rigorous analytical processes, which involve the use of advanced data analytics and proprietary models to assess and manage risk across portfolios. This focus on risk management has been a key factor in BlackRock‚Äôs ability to deliver consistent returns for its clients, even in volatile market environments.</p>\nThe Power of Technology: Aladdin and Beyond<p>\nA key differentiator for BlackRock is its integration of technology into its investment processes. The firm‚Äôs proprietary risk management platform, Aladdin, is widely regarded as one of the most advanced systems in the industry. Aladdin serves as the backbone of BlackRock‚Äôs investment operations, providing real-time data and analytics to portfolio managers, risk managers, and clients.</p>\nAladdin‚Äôs capabilities extend beyond risk management to include portfolio construction, trading, compliance, and reporting. The platform‚Äôs ability to aggregate and analyze vast amounts of data gives BlackRock a significant edge in identifying trends, managing risks, and optimizing portfolios. This technological advantage has been instrumental in BlackRock‚Äôs growth and success, enabling the firm to scale its operations and manage an increasingly complex array of assets.<p>\nIn addition to Aladdin, BlackRock has continued to invest in technology to enhance its investment capabilities. The firm‚Äôs focus on digital transformation is evident in its efforts to </p><a href=\"https://www.visionaryvogues.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">integrate artificial intelligence (AI)</a> and machine learning into its investment processes. These technologies are being used to improve portfolio optimization, enhance risk management, and identify new investment opportunities.\nESG Investing: Leading the Charge</p><p>In recent years, BlackRock has emerged as a leader in environmental, social, and governance (ESG) investing, a trend that reflects growing demand from investors for sustainable investment options. Under the leadership of Larry Fink, BlackRock has made ESG considerations a central component of its investment strategy, arguing that companies with strong ESG practices are better positioned for long-term success.\nIn his annual letters to CEOs, Fink has consistently emphasized the importance of sustainability and corporate responsibility. BlackRock has integrated ESG factors into its investment processes across its entire product lineup, from actively managed funds to index funds and ETFs. The firm has also launched a range of ESG-focused products, including the iShares Sustainable ETF suite, which offers investors exposure to companies with strong ESG profiles.<p>\nBlackRock‚Äôs commitment to ESG investing is backed by its stewardship efforts. The firm engages with the companies in which it invests to promote best practices in governance, environmental sustainability, and social responsibility. This engagement is supported by BlackRock‚Äôs voting power as a major shareholder, allowing it to influence corporate behavior on a global scale.</p>\nThe Rise of Index Investing and ETFs<p>\nBlackRock‚Äôs acquisition of Barclays Global Investors in 2009 marked a turning point in the firm‚Äôs history, particularly with the addition of the iShares ETF business. iShares has since become the largest ETF provider in the world, with a market share of over 40%. The rise of ETFs has been a significant driver of BlackRock‚Äôs growth, as investors increasingly favor low-cost, passive investment vehicles over traditional actively managed funds.</p>\nThe appeal of ETFs lies in their ability to offer diversified exposure to a wide range of asset classes, sectors, and geographies at a lower cost than traditional mutual funds. BlackRock‚Äôs dominance in the ETF market is due in part to its ability to offer a broad array of products that meet the needs of different types of investors, from institutional clients to individual investors.<p>\nBlackRock has also been at the forefront of innovation in the ETF space. The firm has introduced a range of innovative products, such as smart beta ETFs, which use alternative weighting methodologies to capture specific investment factors like value, momentum, or volatility. These products offer investors a way to achieve targeted exposure to specific investment themes while maintaining the benefits of passive investing.</p>\nGlobal Reach and Client Focus<p>\nOne of BlackRock‚Äôs key strengths is its global reach. The firm operates in over 100 countries, serving a diverse client base that includes governments, corporations, foundations, and individual investors. This global presence allows BlackRock to offer a wide range of investment solutions tailored to the unique needs of different markets and clients.</p>\nBlackRock‚Äôs client-centric approach is evident in its commitment to understanding the needs and goals of its clients. The firm offers customized investment solutions and advisory services, leveraging its deep expertise across asset classes and geographies. This focus on client needs has helped BlackRock build long-term relationships and maintain its position as a trusted partner in asset management.<p>\nIn addition to its global operations, BlackRock‚Äôs commitment to client education and transparency is a key factor in its success. The firm regularly publishes research and insights on market trends, investment strategies, and economic developments, helping clients make informed decisions. BlackRock‚Äôs emphasis on transparency is also reflected in its reporting practices, which provide clients with detailed information on the performance and risk characteristics of their investments.</p>\nAdaptability and Innovation<p>\nBlackRock‚Äôs ability to adapt to changing market conditions and investor preferences has been a driving force behind its continued success. The firm‚Äôs willingness to embrace new investment strategies, technologies, and market trends has allowed it to stay ahead of the curve and maintain its leadership position in the asset management industry.</p>\nOne example of this adaptability is BlackRock‚Äôs response to the growing demand for alternative investments. The firm has expanded its offerings in private equity, real estate, infrastructure, and hedge funds, providing clients with access to a wider range of investment opportunities. This expansion into alternatives reflects BlackRock‚Äôs recognition of the changing dynamics in global markets and the need for diversification beyond traditional asset classes.<p>\nAnother area where BlackRock has demonstrated innovation is in its approach to retirement planning. The firm has developed a range of target-date funds and retirement income solutions designed to meet the needs of an aging population. These products are tailored to help investors achieve their retirement goals by providing diversified, risk-managed portfolios that evolve over time.</p>\nThe Future of BlackRock and Asset Management<p>\nAs the global asset management industry continues to evolve, BlackRock is well-positioned to remain a leader in the space. The firm‚Äôs focus on technology, sustainability, and innovation will likely be key drivers of its future growth. BlackRock‚Äôs commitment to integrating ESG factors into its investment processes, combined with its leadership in the ETF market, positions it to capitalize on the growing demand for sustainable and passive investment products.</p></p><p>Moreover, BlackRock‚Äôs continued investment in technology, particularly in AI and machine learning, will likely enhance its ability to deliver superior investment outcomes for its clients. As these technologies become more integrated into the investment process, they will enable BlackRock to better manage risk, identify opportunities, and optimize portfolios in an increasingly complex and dynamic market environment.\nBlackRock‚Äôs global reach and client-centric approach will also remain critical to its success. The firm‚Äôs ability to understand and respond to the unique needs of its diverse client base will continue to drive its growth and strengthen its position as a trusted partner in asset management.\nBlackRock‚Äôs rise to the top of the asset management industry is a testament to its innovative strategies, commitment to technology, and focus on client needs. From its pioneering use of risk management tools to its leadership in ESG investing and ETFs, BlackRock has consistently demonstrated its ability to adapt and thrive in a rapidly changing financial landscape.<p>\nAs the asset management industry continues to evolve, BlackRock‚Äôs emphasis on long-term, value-driven investing, combined with its cutting-edge technology and global reach, will ensure that it remains a dominant force in the world of finance. For investors seeking insights into what makes a leader in asset management, BlackRock offers a compelling case study in the power of innovation, adaptability, and client focus.</p>\nUncover the latest trends and insights with our articles on Visionary Vogues</p>","contentLength":11368,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"üõ∞Ô∏è NovaCodes: Python for Builders, Not Browsers","url":"https://dev.to/novacodes/novacodes-python-for-builders-not-browsers-34b","date":1751447438,"author":"novacodes","guid":180399,"unread":true,"content":"<p>I‚Äôm NovaCodes.

That post set the stage for developers and testers who wanted to begin their journey into automation, but it was just the beginning.</p><p>As more development teams integrate quality earlier in the SDLC, there's increasing demand for professionals who can not only write clean Python code but also automate real-world scenarios on web applications. That‚Äôs where Selenium with Python comes in. This article is a step-by-step guide for those looking to connect their Python skills with browser-based automation, starting from scratch and growing toward building robust automation suites.</p><p>If you're a Python developer exploring QA responsibilities or a QA engineer wanting to strengthen your Python automation foundation, this is for you.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  What Is Selenium, and Why Pair It with Python?\n</h2><p>Selenium is the de facto standard for browser automation. It allows you to simulate everything a real user would do on a website‚Äîclicking, typing, scrolling, verifying content, navigating tabs, and more. Selenium WebDriver directly controls browsers like Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge, making it perfect for testing across environments.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Why Python for Selenium Automation?\n</h2><p>Python stands out for a few key reasons:</p><ul><li>Concise syntax: Short, readable scripts allow teams to iterate faster.</li><li>Powerful ecosystem: Integration with pytest, unittest, pandas, requests, and faker makes Python automation extremely flexible.</li><li>Beginner-friendly: New testers and developers can quickly start coding without excessive boilerplate.</li></ul><p>Together, <a href=\"https://www.testrigtechnologies.com/automation-testing/web-application-automation-testing-with-selenium-and-python-a-comprehensive-guide/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Selenium and Python </a>form a fast, maintainable, and extensible way to automate your testing process, without steep learning curves.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Step 1: Setting Up Selenium with Python\n</h2><p>Before you write a single test case, set up your Python + Selenium environment:</p><p><strong>1. Install Selenium via pip:</strong>\npip install selenium</p><p><strong>2. Download the Chrome WebDriver:</strong></p><p>Once setup is done, you‚Äôre ready to write your first browser automation script.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Step 2: Writing a Basic Selenium Test Script in Python\n</h2><p>Let‚Äôs create a simple automated test: open Google, perform a search, and close the browser.</p><p>from selenium import webdriver\nfrom selenium.webdriver.common.keys import Keys</p><p>driver = webdriver.Chrome()</p><p>search_box = driver.find_element(\"name\", \"q\")</p><p>search_box.send_keys(\"Selenium automation with Python\")\nsearch_box.send_keys(Keys.RETURN)</p><p>driver.implicitly_wait(5)\ndriver.quit()</p><ul><li>Opened a browser and navigated to a URL</li><li>Found a search input element using the name locator</li><li>Typed a query and submitted it</li><li>Waited for results and closed the session</li></ul><p>This is your first successful test of a working UI automation flow!</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Step 3: Locating and Interacting with Web Elements\n</h2><p>Selenium allows you to find and interact with web elements using multiple strategies. Some commonly used methods include:</p><ul></ul><p>from selenium.webdriver.common.by import By</p><p>email_input = driver.find_element(By.ID, \"email\")\nemail_input.send_keys(\"<a href=\"mailto:test@example.com\">test@example.com</a>\")</p><p>You can also perform advanced actions like:</p><ul></ul><p>These interactions simulate actual user behavior, helping you verify UI flows more reliably.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Step 4: Dealing with Waits ‚Äì The Right Way\n</h2><p>Web apps are dynamic, and elements don‚Äôt always load instantly. Without waits, your test may fail because the element wasn‚Äôt there‚Äîyet.</p><p>Implicit Wait:\nApplies globally:</p><p>driver.implicitly_wait(10)  # Seconds</p><p>Explicit Wait:\nTargeted, preferred in modern test scripts:</p><p>from selenium.webdriver.support.ui import WebDriverWait\nfrom selenium.webdriver.support import expected_conditions as EC</p><p>element = WebDriverWait(driver, 15).until(\n    EC.presence_of_element_located((By.ID, \"username\"))</p><p>Use explicit waits when you need to validate specific states like visibility, presence, or clickability.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Step 5: Managing Dynamic Test Data\n</h2><p>Hardcoded values might work in small tests, but for scalable automation, parameterized, random, or external test data is essential.</p><ul><li>CSV or Excel files (via pandas)</li><li>JSON files for structured test cases</li><li>Data generation libraries like faker</li></ul><p>fake = Faker()\nprint(fake.name())        # Random full name<p>\nprint(fake.email())       # Random email address</p></p><p>This reduces repetition and improves test realism‚Äîespecially in sign-up or form automation.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Step 6: Structuring and Scaling Your Test Suite\n</h2><p>As your test cases grow, proper structuring becomes critical. Key practices include:</p><ul><li>Using pytest for test discovery, grouping, and fixtures</li><li>Modularizing test logic into reusable functions</li><li>Separating page locators using Page Object Model (POM)</li><li>Externalizing configuration (URLs, credentials, etc.)</li></ul><p>Sample test file structure:</p><p>tests/\n  test_login.py\npages/\n  signup_page.py\n  data_generator.py</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Final Thoughts: Python + Selenium Is Just the Beginning\n</h2><p>Selenium with Python gives you direct control over browser-based tests, helping you ensure real user experiences are not just functional, but consistent across deployments.</p><p>Whether you're building a test suite from scratch or integrating with CI/CD platforms like Jenkins or GitHub Actions‚ÄîPython provides the flexibility and readability to scale your automation goals effectively.</p><p><strong>Need Help Scaling Your Python Test Automation?</strong>\nAs a leading <a href=\"https://www.testrigtechnologies.com/web-automation-testing-services/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Web Automation Testing Company</a>, at Testrig Technologies, we help QA and DevOps teams build reliable, scalable, and CI-ready automation solutions using Python, Selenium, Playwright, and other modern frameworks.</p>","contentLength":5524,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"[Boost]","url":"https://dev.to/osiris8/-1anh","date":1751443214,"author":"Osiris8","guid":180396,"unread":true,"content":"<h2>Build and Deploy a Fullstack AI App with Flask, React, JWT, Neon Database, Mistral &amp; Groq Cloud ‚Äì Project Milo Part 1 (Backend)</h2>","contentLength":129,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Talk Python to Me: #512: Building a JIT Compiler for CPython","url":"https://talkpython.fm/episodes/show/512/building-a-jit-compiler-for-cpython","date":1751443200,"author":"","guid":181263,"unread":true,"content":"<article>Do you like to dive into the details and intricacies of how Python executes and how we can optimize it?

Or seen a piece of writing generated by AI that‚Äôs almost indistinguishable from something written by a person? These experiences are becoming increasingly common thanks to Large Language Models (LLMs). But what exactly  these powerful tools, and what does their rise mean for the future?</p><p>LLMs are sophisticated computer programs designed to understand and generate human language. Think of them as incredibly advanced autocomplete systems, but on a massive scale. Instead of suggesting the next word in a sentence, they can generate entire paragraphs, essays, even poems, based on the input they receive. This ability stems from their ‚Äútraining‚Äù on massive datasets of text and code ‚Äì think of it as reading every book, article, and website ever written. This massive exposure allows them to learn patterns, relationships between words, and the nuances of human language.</p><p>Imagine teaching a child to write by showing them countless examples of well-written stories. Eventually, the child learns the rules of grammar, sentence structure, and even develops a unique writing style. LLMs work similarly, but at a scale unimaginable to human learning. They analyze billions of words, identifying statistical probabilities of word combinations and contextual relationships. This enables them to predict the most likely next word, sentence, or paragraph in response to a given prompt.</p><p>The significance of LLMs cannot be overstated. They represent a leap forward in artificial intelligence, pushing the boundaries of what computers can achieve in understanding and generating human-quality text. This has far-reaching implications across numerous fields. They address problems like the need for efficient content creation, accurate translation, and personalized learning experiences, while also opening up opportunities for innovation we are only beginning to understand.</p><p><strong>Applications and Transformative Impact:</strong></p><p>The applications of LLMs are already vast and rapidly expanding. Here are a few key examples:</p><ul><li> LLMs can generate various forms of content, including articles, marketing copy, scripts, and even creative writing. This can significantly increase efficiency for businesses and individuals, streamlining content production and potentially reducing costs.</li><li> LLMs excel at translating text between languages, offering more accurate and nuanced translations than previous methods. This can break down communication barriers and facilitate global collaboration.</li><li>  AI-powered chatbots driven by LLMs provide instant customer support, answering frequently asked questions and resolving basic issues, freeing up human agents to handle more complex problems.</li><li> LLMs can personalize learning experiences by generating customized exercises, quizzes, and feedback for students.  They can also help create educational content in various formats.</li><li> LLMs can assist programmers by generating code snippets, suggesting improvements, and even helping to debug existing code, increasing development speed and efficiency.</li><li> LLMs can analyze medical texts, assist in diagnosis, and even help develop new treatments by identifying patterns and relationships in vast datasets.</li></ul><p><strong>Challenges, Limitations, and Ethical Considerations:</strong></p><p>Despite their potential, LLMs are not without limitations and challenges:</p><ul><li> LLMs are trained on existing data, which may reflect societal biases.  This can lead to the generation of biased or discriminatory outputs, requiring careful monitoring and mitigation strategies.</li><li> LLMs can sometimes generate incorrect or nonsensical information, a phenomenon known as ‚Äúhallucination.‚Äù  Their outputs should always be critically evaluated and verified.</li><li> The potential misuse of LLMs for malicious purposes, such as generating fake news or impersonating individuals, raises serious ethical concerns.  Robust safeguards and regulations are crucial to prevent such misuse.</li><li> The training of LLMs requires significant computational resources, leading to a substantial carbon footprint.  Developing more energy-efficient training methods is essential.</li><li>  The automation potential of LLMs raises concerns about job displacement in certain sectors.  Addressing this requires proactive measures like retraining and upskilling initiatives.</li></ul><p>Large Language Models represent a powerful and transformative technology with the potential to reshape numerous aspects of our lives. While challenges remain, ongoing research and development are actively addressing issues related to bias, accuracy, and ethical implications. As LLMs continue to evolve, we can expect even more sophisticated and impactful applications, further blurring the lines between human and machine intelligence. The key lies in responsible development, deployment, and regulation to ensure these powerful tools benefit humanity as a whole. The future of LLMs is not just about technological advancement; it's about navigating the ethical and societal implications to harness their potential for good.</p>","contentLength":5006,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"ANN","url":"https://dev.to/docmath/ann-5b8g","date":1751421621,"author":"Dr. Mathews K.

Thanks to Alpha-Omega for supporting security in the Python ecosystem.</p></blockquote><p>To understand why security is special, we have to take a look at why open source is an amazing thing.\nFor many components of open source, users that have the time, desire, and expertise are able to contribute meaningfully to projects.\nAs a maintainer of an open source project, </p><p>Users and contributors can work on the areas they are interested in, like triaging bug reports, engaging with the community, or writing great docs.\nFor smaller open source projects this is especially important, there‚Äôs only one or a few maintainers and they can‚Äôt do it all on their own sustainably.</p><p>But not for security, right? Security is .</p><p>Only a select few are supposed to be able to handle vulnerability reports, configure the repository and package manager settings, and secure the release process.\nThis tight association between security work and maintainers is what I‚Äôd like to try to pull apart today.</p><p>Maintainers, especially for smaller projects, are almost always experts in the , not necessarily in .\nBut the expectations of open source projects means that maintainers feel compelled to do this work to keep their project and users safe.</p><p>And those expectations for security today, that <strong>security work is done by few rather than many</strong>, combined with the secretive nature of security work means that maintainers often feel isolated.</p><p>Maintainers don‚Äôt see how other projects are triaging vulnerabilities and can‚Äôt learn from each other. They can‚Äôt compare notes on what they are seeing and whether they are doing the right thing.\nIsolation in security work breeds a culture of fear. Fear of doing the wrong thing and making your users unsafe.</p><p>This private conversation was published with permission from Marcelo, maintainer of <a href=\"https://github.com/encode/starlette\">Starlette</a>, a popular Python library that powers FastAPI.</p><p>He was seeing security reports that seemed convincing but they were also confusing. He asked for my help and together we determined the reports were generated with an LLM and were meaningless. I later published an article about ‚Äú<a href=\"https://sethmlarson.dev/slop-security-reports\">slop security reports</a>‚Äù that other projects were seeing too, including curl, Python, Django, and others. But none of us would know what the others were seeing without sharing.</p><p>Smaller projects are shaped by their tools, not the other way around.\nSmall projects don‚Äôt have the time and resources to make a square peg fit into a circular hole when it comes to any type of tooling, including security.\nThey don‚Äôt have time to create bots and wrappers and bend these tools to work for them, like many larger projects do.</p><p>This means that whatever is available or the default experience is probably what they work with, and often our tools encode the assumption that ‚Äúonly maintainers do security work‚Äù.</p><p>Of the top 10,000 open source packages with GitHub repositories identified by <a href=\"https://ecosyste.ms/\">Ecosystems dataset</a>, 35% are owned by a GitHub user, not a GitHub organization.\nThis has huge implications for what features are available to those projects and who is able to do security work at all.</p><p>Security tools and vulnerability reports often introduce an asymmetry by creating work to do without resolving the issues identified.\nFixing security issues while weighing user expectations, performance, and backwards compatibility is a tough job.\nThis is the reason maintainers are often hesitant to adopt security scanners and tools, because adoption is easy but being on the hook to triage the findings forever is hard.</p><p>If a bunch of your limited time with a project is spent doing work that isn‚Äôt aligned with your interests in the project, this can lead to burnout which only makes the problem worse.</p><p>This image is from the changelog of <a href=\"https://libexpat.github.io\">libexpat</a> which states that the project is understaffed and without funding and is in need of help responding to findings from fuzzing the project within the standard 90 day grace period.</p><p>So what can we all do to make security work less ‚Äúspecial‚Äù and more like other open source contributions?</p><p>I propose a new model for open source security contributions, where security work is completed by trusted individuals that aren‚Äôt necessarily maintainers on behalf of projects.\nThis model break the assumption that maintainers are the only ones that can do security work, especially for smaller projects.</p><p>These ‚Äúsecurity contributors‚Äù could be maintainers or contributors of other open source projects that know about security, they could be foundations offering up resources to their ecosystem, or engineers at companies helping their dependency graph.</p><p>Even if you‚Äôre not contributing security work directly to an open source project, I think there‚Äôs reframing, re-engineering, and rethinking work that we can all do to make this model successful.</p><p>Now I know what you might be thinking: ‚ÄúWhat about XZ?‚Äù\nXZ often comes up during conversations involving trust in contributors to open source projects, but I‚Äôm not convinced it‚Äôs the show-stopper it‚Äôs often portrayed as.</p><p>The technologies to discover the backdoor trigger of XZ already exist but had not yet been adopted by the project, such as reproducible builds, build provenance, capability analysis, or using a canonical URL to download source code.</p><p>Malicious contributors have always been a problem for open source and the solution can‚Äôt be that we just stop trusting each other or accepting help from our community.\nWe lose something bigger than the XZ-utils backdoor if we let this incident define how open source security works going forward.</p><p>We have to be able to build trust amongst contributors and projects and security work can‚Äôt all fall on maintainers.\nIf we want <em>open source sustainability</em> then we cannot let XZ-utils define open source security.</p><p>So what can we all do to nurture this more sustainable model of open source security contribution?</p><p>We can all use our voices and experiences to build a more positive and healthy security culture and overcome the isolation inherent to security work.</p><p>Sharing and encouraging the sharing experiences shows others that they‚Äôre not the only ones that think this is difficult.\nSeeing others sharing experiences shows that it‚Äôs okay to ask for help and to not be perfect, instead the focus should be on always improving.</p><p>If you‚Äôre a public contributor to open source security, making yourself visible and approachable is a great way to begin building trust in the communities you participate in.\nConferences and in-person meetups are excellent venues for promoting positive security culture and building trust amongst a community.</p><p>There is something about being in-person that really let‚Äôs people be vulnerable and talk honestly about what they are experiencing and their problems which sometimes is exactly what we need to hear.\nWhen I‚Äôm at conferences I also like to offer up 1-on-1 time to discuss security issues with maintainers or help them adopt new security features.</p><p>TLS and public key infrastructure scale trust of the internet and web, we need more technologies that scale trust in open source contributions.</p><p>We should continue contributing to and adopting technologies that enable trust for open source projects and contributions.\nThis is especially meaningful when the technology is added to existing tooling like package managers and build tools.\nTechnologies like build reproducibility, build provenance, and capability analysis can all minimize the risk from adding more privileged contributors.</p><p>We  need platforms and tools to update their underlying assumptions about who does security work for projects to support this new open source security contribution model.</p><p>Separating maintenance responsibilities and security work is beneficial for users wanting to help projects, too.\nIf we assume that the securing and maintaining are linked, then it becomes a more difficult task to be able to offer help to open source projects.\nSome projects do not have the governance in place to transition from one to many maintainers. Some maintainers want to continue owning the project roadmap and vision.</p><p>Getting your manager on-board with you maintaining a project is a difficult and amorphous ask compared to more tightly defined ‚Äúsecurity work‚Äù for an open source dependency your team uses.\nOpen Source Program Offices (OSPOs) could use this model to concretely show how they are benefiting their whole open source supply-chain, and not only the larger projects that are able to receive grant funding.</p><p>I don‚Äôt think this change happens overnight, but we need to think about where we might go.\nFrom my experience working in open source, security work isn‚Äôt the special sauce, it‚Äôs always trust.</p><p>Whether you‚Äôre an open source user, a contributor to OpenSSF or other security working groups, or a developer of tools for open source projects, I hope I‚Äôve inspired you that we need to think beyond current models of how security work is done for open source projects to achieve sustainable open source security.</p>","contentLength":9224,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"I have included the Experimental Results section to strengthen the algorithm‚Äôs empirical validation.

Maybe it didn‚Äôt break your program, but it‚Äôs not good practice. Leaving files or network connections open can cause resource leaks, meaning you‚Äôre using up system memory or leaving a file locked unnecessarily. That‚Äôs where context managers come in. They handle the ‚Äúsetup and teardown‚Äù automatically so you can focus on your logic without worrying about the cleanup.</p><p>This blog will guide you through:</p><ul><li>What a context manager is</li><li>How  and  work</li><li>Real-life use cases and examples</li><li>How to write your own context managers both class-based and function-based</li></ul><h2>\n  \n  \n  What Is a Context Manager?\n</h2><p>A context manager is a Python object that properly manages resources like files, network connections, or database sessions. It makes sure things are set up when you enter a block of code and cleaned up when you leave it, even if something goes wrong.</p><p>You‚Äôve already used one before:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>What this does behind the scenes:</p><ol><li>Python calls , then </li><li>It runs your  inside the  block</li><li>When the block is done or crashes, it calls  to close the file</li></ol><p>You didn‚Äôt have to write a / block. Python cleaned up for you.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  The  and  Methods\n</h2><p>To create a context manager yourself, you need a class that defines two special methods:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Let‚Äôs see this in action with a simple logger.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Example 1: A Simple Logging Context Manager\n</h2><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><div><pre><code>Starting the timer...\nElapsed time: 1.50 seconds\n</code></pre></div><p>Even if there‚Äôs an error inside the block,  still runs which is great for cleanup.</p><p>Let‚Äôs take this a bit further. Here are some practical real-world problems you can solve with custom context managers.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  1. <strong>Automatically Closing Resources</strong></h3><p>Imagine you're working with file handles, network sockets, or database connections. You need to ensure they're closed no matter what happens.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><h3><strong>2.

This isn't science fiction; it's the reality of generative AI, specifically text-to-image models. These powerful algorithms are transforming how we create and interact with visual content, ushering in a new era of artistic expression and technological innovation.</p><p><strong>Understanding the Magic: How Text Becomes an Image</strong></p><p>At its core, a text-to-image model is a sophisticated computer program trained on massive datasets of images and their corresponding text descriptions. Think of it like teaching a child to draw by showing them countless pictures and telling them what they depict. Over time, the child learns to associate words with visual elements ‚Äì a \"fluffy white cat\" evokes images of soft fur and round eyes. Similarly, these AI models learn the complex relationships between words and visual features.</p><p>The process begins with a text prompt, a sentence or paragraph describing the desired image. This prompt is then fed into a neural network ‚Äì a complex system inspired by the human brain ‚Äì that has been trained to understand the meaning and nuances of language and translate them into visual representations. The network doesn't simply search for pre-existing images; it generates entirely new ones based on its learned understanding. It essentially \"paints\" a picture based on your textual instructions.</p><p>This process involves several intricate steps, including:</p><ul><li> The model converts the text prompt into a numerical representation that it can understand.</li><li> Using this numerical representation, the model generates a latent representation, a compressed form of the image.</li><li>  The latent representation is then decoded into a full-fledged image, often using techniques like diffusion models that gradually refine a noisy image into a coherent one.</li></ul><p><strong>Significance and Impact: A New Creative Frontier</strong></p><p>The significance of text-to-image models cannot be overstated. They democratize image creation, empowering individuals without artistic training to generate stunning visuals. This has profound implications across numerous fields:</p><ul><li><strong>Marketing and Advertising:</strong> Businesses can quickly and cost-effectively create compelling visuals for campaigns, websites, and social media.</li><li>  Generating diverse and detailed game assets becomes significantly faster and more efficient.</li><li>  Text-to-image models can aid in concept art, storyboarding, and even generating background elements.</li><li>  Students can use these tools to visualize abstract concepts and create engaging educational materials.</li><li>  Artists can utilize these models as powerful creative tools, augmenting their own skills and exploring new artistic styles.</li></ul><p><strong>Applications and Transformative Potential:</strong></p><p>The potential applications are vast and rapidly expanding. Imagine architects using text prompts to visualize building designs, fashion designers creating virtual garment prototypes, or scientists visualizing complex biological structures. The ability to translate abstract ideas into concrete visual representations opens up exciting possibilities across industries, accelerating innovation and streamlining workflows.</p><p><strong>Challenges, Limitations, and Ethical Considerations:</strong></p><p>Despite its immense potential, text-to-image technology faces several challenges:</p><ul><li>  Models trained on biased datasets can perpetuate harmful stereotypes in generated images.  Addressing this requires careful curation of training data and ongoing monitoring.</li><li>  The legal implications of AI-generated art are still being debated, raising questions about ownership and copyright infringement.</li><li><strong>Misinformation and Deepfakes:</strong>  The ease of creating realistic but fake images raises concerns about the spread of misinformation and the potential for malicious use.</li><li>  While creating new opportunities, the technology also raises concerns about potential job displacement in certain creative industries.</li></ul><p><strong>The Future of Text-to-Image Models:</strong></p><p>Text-to-image models are still evolving rapidly. Future developments will likely focus on improving image quality, enhancing control over generation parameters, and mitigating ethical concerns. We can expect to see more sophisticated models capable of understanding complex prompts, generating more realistic and diverse images, and even creating interactive and animated content directly from text.</p><p>In conclusion, generative AI's text-to-image models represent a significant leap forward in artificial intelligence and its application to visual content creation. While challenges remain, the transformative potential of this technology is undeniable. As it continues to evolve, it promises to revolutionize how we create, interact with, and understand the visual world around us, opening up exciting opportunities across numerous fields and shaping the future of creativity and innovation.</p>","contentLength":4877,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Creating a Website with Sphinx and Markdown","url":"https://www.blog.pythonlibrary.org/2025/07/01/creating-a-website-with-sphinx-and-markdown/","date":1751372880,"author":"Mike","guid":178904,"unread":true,"content":"<p><a href=\"https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/\">Sphinx</a> is a Python-based documentation builder.

We were using Celery with Redis as a broker, and a deserialization vulnerability in a custom authentication middleware allowed an attacker to inject malicious code into a job payload, ultimately gaining read access to sensitive data. The root cause wasn‚Äôt a missing security library, but a failure to properly validate the authentication token  the deserialization process, coupled with overly permissive pickling. This incident underscored the fact that authentication isn‚Äôt a single point solution; it‚Äôs a pervasive concern woven throughout the entire system, demanding meticulous attention to detail.  This post dives deep into the practicalities of authentication in modern Python ecosystems, focusing on architecture, performance, and real-world pitfalls.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  What is \"authentication\" in Python?\n</h3><p>Technically, authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user, device, or service. It answers the question \"Who are you?\".  In Python, there isn‚Äôt a single, definitive PEP governing authentication directly. However, PEP 484 ‚Äì Type Hints, and the broader ecosystem around static typing (mypy) are crucial for building robust authentication systems.  The  module, , and  allow us to define strict schemas for authentication tokens and credentials, enabling compile-time validation and reducing runtime errors.  CPython‚Äôs internal mechanisms for object identity () and hashing are fundamental to secure token generation and comparison.  The standard library‚Äôs  provides cryptographic hashing algorithms, but relying solely on it for authentication is rarely sufficient; dedicated libraries like  are essential for secure key management and encryption.</p><ol><li><p><strong>FastAPI Request Handling:</strong>  In a high-throughput API, authentication is typically handled via JWTs (JSON Web Tokens) passed in the  header.  We use a custom FastAPI dependency to extract, verify, and decode the JWT, attaching the user identity to the request context.  Performance is critical here; JWT verification must be fast to avoid latency spikes.</p></li><li><p><strong>Async Job Queues (Celery/RQ):</strong> As demonstrated by the incident above, authenticating tasks submitted to an asynchronous queue is vital.  We now sign task payloads with a HMAC (Hash-based Message Authentication Code) using a rotating secret key, verifying the signature before deserialization.</p></li><li><p><strong>Type-Safe Data Models (Pydantic):</strong>  When receiving data from external sources (e.g., user uploads, API calls), Pydantic models are used to define the expected schema. Authentication credentials are often embedded within these models, and validation ensures that only authorized data is processed.</p></li><li><p>  For command-line tools interacting with sensitive resources, we employ API keys or OAuth 2.0 tokens.  These credentials are stored securely (e.g., using ) and used to authenticate requests to a backend service.</p></li><li><p><strong>ML Preprocessing Pipelines:</strong>  Data pipelines often require access to sensitive data. Authentication is used to control access to data sources and ensure that only authorized users can train or deploy models.</p></li></ol><h3>\n  \n  \n  Integration with Python Tooling\n</h3><p>Our  reflects our commitment to static typing and code quality:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>We use FastAPI‚Äôs dependency injection system to manage authentication.  A custom middleware extracts the JWT, and a dependency validates it.  This separation of concerns makes testing easier and improves code readability.  Runtime hooks, like signal handlers, are used to refresh JWTs before they expire.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>This example demonstrates a dependency injection pattern for authentication.  The  function is a dependency that extracts and validates the JWT, returning the user ID.  This pattern promotes reusability and testability.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Failure Scenarios &amp; Debugging\n</h3><p>A common failure is incorrect JWT verification due to a mismatched secret key or algorithm.  This often manifests as a .  Debugging involves:</p><ol><li>  Detailed logging of the JWT payload and verification process.</li><li>  Stepping through the  function to inspect the token and key.</li><li>  Analyzing the full traceback to identify the source of the error.</li><li> Adding assertions to verify the expected format and content of the JWT.</li></ol><p>Another issue is race conditions in asynchronous authentication.  If multiple requests attempt to authenticate simultaneously, the verification process can become interleaved, leading to incorrect results.  Using appropriate locking mechanisms (e.g., ) can mitigate this risk.  We once encountered a memory leak in a Celery worker due to unclosed database connections within an authentication middleware.   and  were instrumental in identifying the leak.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Performance &amp; Scalability\n</h3><p>JWT verification is a performance bottleneck.  We‚Äôve optimized this by:</p><ol><li>  Caching verified JWT payloads in Redis to avoid redundant verification.</li><li><strong>Asynchronous Verification:</strong>  Performing JWT verification asynchronously using .</li><li>  Minimizing the use of global variables in the authentication process.</li><li>  Exploring the use of C extensions for cryptographic operations (though the gains are often marginal).</li></ol><p>Benchmarking with  and <code>asyncio.run(async_benchmark())</code> is crucial to measure the impact of these optimizations.</p><p>Insecure deserialization, as experienced in our production incident, is a major risk.  Always validate the authentication token  deserializing any data associated with it.  Avoid using  for untrusted data.  Code injection can occur if user-supplied data is used to construct SQL queries or shell commands.  Use parameterized queries and proper input validation to prevent this.  Privilege escalation can occur if authentication checks are bypassed or if users are granted excessive permissions.  Implement least privilege principles and regularly review access controls.</p><p>We employ a multi-layered testing strategy:</p><ol><li>  Testing individual authentication functions and dependencies.</li><li>  Testing the interaction between authentication and other components (e.g., FastAPI routes, Celery tasks).</li><li><strong>Property-Based Tests (Hypothesis):</strong>  Generating random JWT payloads to test the robustness of the verification process.</li><li>  Ensuring that all authentication code is type-safe.</li></ol><p>Our CI/CD pipeline includes:</p><ul><li> with code coverage reporting.</li><li> for testing against multiple Python versions.</li><li>GitHub Actions to run tests and linters on every pull request.</li><li> hooks to enforce code style and type checking.</li></ul><h3>\n  \n  \n  Common Pitfalls &amp; Anti-Patterns\n</h3><ol><li><strong>Storing Passwords in Plain Text:</strong>  Never store passwords directly. Use strong hashing algorithms (e.g., bcrypt, Argon2).</li><li><strong>Using  for Untrusted Data:</strong>  As mentioned,  is inherently insecure.</li><li>  Always verify the  claim in JWTs.</li><li><strong>Overly Permissive Access Controls:</strong>  Grant users only the minimum necessary permissions.</li><li><strong>Lack of Input Validation:</strong>  Validate all user-supplied data to prevent injection attacks.</li><li>  Never hardcode secrets in your code. Use environment variables or a secrets management system.</li></ol><h3>\n  \n  \n  Best Practices &amp; Architecture\n</h3><ul><li>  Use type hints extensively to improve code correctness and maintainability.</li><li>  Separate authentication logic from business logic.</li><li>  Assume that all user input is malicious.</li><li>  Break down authentication into small, reusable components.</li><li>  Use a layered configuration system to manage secrets and settings.</li><li>  Use dependency injection to improve testability and flexibility.</li><li>  Automate testing, linting, and deployment.</li><li>  Use Docker or other containerization technologies to ensure reproducible builds.</li><li>  Document all authentication code thoroughly.</li></ul><p>Authentication is a complex and critical aspect of modern Python systems.  Mastering the nuances of authentication, from secure token generation to robust validation and performance optimization, is essential for building reliable, scalable, and maintainable applications.

This is where Artificial Intelligence (AI) and hyper-personalization become not just features, but foundational pillars in successful <a href=\"https://www.sparkouttech.com/super-app-development/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Super App development</a>.</p><p>AI acts as the intelligent backbone, processing vast amounts of user data, predicting needs, and automating interactions. Personalization, powered by AI, translates these insights into tailored experiences, making each user feel like the app was designed just for them. This synergy is crucial for transforming a collection of services into a cohesive, intuitive, and highly engaging digital ecosystem. This blog post will explore the pivotal role of AI and personalization in Super App development, highlighting how they elevate user experience, drive engagement, and unlock new value for businesses.</p><p><strong>1. AI as the Engine for Data Processing and Predictive Analytics</strong></p><p>At its core, a Super App generates an enormous amount of data from diverse user interactions across various services. This includes transaction history, search queries, location data, communication patterns, Browse behavior, and more. Without a sophisticated mechanism to process and interpret this data, it remains a raw, untapped resource. This is where AI steps in as the indispensable engine.</p><p><strong>AI-powered algorithms, particularly machine learning (ML) models, can:</strong></p><p>Process Massive Datasets: Rapidly analyze vast volumes of structured and unstructured data in real-time, far exceeding human capacity.</p><p>Identify Complex Patterns: Uncover subtle correlations and trends within the data that indicate user preferences, habits, and future intentions.</p><p>Enable Predictive Analytics: Based on historical data and real-time inputs, AI can predict user needs, likely actions, and even potential pain points. For example, an AI might predict a user's need for a ride based on their calendar events and location, or suggest a restaurant based on past orders and current time.</p><p>This predictive capability is a game-changer for <a href=\"https://www.sparkouttech.com/super-app-development/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Super App development solutions</a>. Instead of users having to actively search for services, the app can proactively offer relevant options, streamlining their experience. For instance, if a user frequently orders coffee from a specific cafe in the morning, an AI agent could prompt them with an option to reorder as they approach their usual time. This seamless, almost clairvoyant interaction significantly enhances convenience and makes the Super App feel truly intelligent and helpful. The ability of AI to derive actionable insights from multi-service data is what elevates a Super App from a mere collection of mini-apps to a truly integrated and intelligent ecosystem.</p><p><strong>2. Personalization: Tailoring the Super App Experience</strong></p><p>While AI provides the analytical power, personalization is the user-facing outcome. In a Super App, personalization moves beyond simple \"recommended for you\" lists to a dynamic adaptation of the entire app experience. This level of customization ensures that despite the app's vast functionalities, it feels intuitive and relevant to each individual.</p><p><strong>Key aspects of personalization driven by AI in Super Apps include:</strong></p><p>Dynamic UI/UX Customization: The layout and visibility of mini-apps and features can change based on a user's most frequent activities, time of day, or location. For example, food delivery might be prominent during lunch hours, while payment options become central during bill payment cycles.</p><p>Contextual Recommendations: AI leverages contextual data (time, location, weather, past behavior) to offer highly relevant suggestions, whether for shopping, entertainment, or financial services.</p><p>Personalized Content and Notifications: Delivering news feeds, promotions, or notifications that are specifically tailored to a user's interests and previous interactions, reducing notification fatigue and increasing engagement.</p><p>Adaptive Search and Discovery: AI can refine search results and make it easier for users to discover new services or features within the Super App that align with their inferred needs.</p><p>This granular level of personalization ensures that the user never feels overwhelmed by the multitude of options. Instead, they experience a streamlined interface that anticipates their needs, making navigation effortless and delightful. This is a core benefit of Super App architecture combined with intelligent systems. A Super App Development Company places a strong emphasis on designing user interfaces that can fluidly adapt based on AI-driven personalization.</p><p><strong>3. AI-Powered Virtual Assistants and Chatbots</strong></p><p>The integration of AI-powered virtual assistants and advanced chatbots is another critical role of AI in Super App development. These intelligent conversational agents serve as the primary interface for many user queries and tasks, providing instant, round-the-clock support across all integrated services.</p><p>Intelligent Query Resolution: AI chatbots can understand natural language queries related to any service within the Super App, from tracking a food order to checking a bank balance or booking a ride, and provide accurate, real-time responses.</p><p>Seamless Task Execution: Beyond answering questions, these AI agents can often execute tasks directly within the chat interface, such as placing an order, initiating a payment, or scheduling a service, significantly streamlining workflows.</p><p>Proactive Assistance: Based on predictive analytics, the AI assistant can proactively offer help or suggest relevant services before the user even explicitly asks, further enhancing convenience.</p><p>Multilingual Support: AI‚Äôs natural language processing (NLP) capabilities enable Super Apps to offer seamless support in multiple languages, catering to a diverse global user base.</p><p>These AI-driven conversational interfaces reduce the burden on human customer support teams, leading to significant cost savings. More importantly, they provide an immediate, consistent, and personalized support experience that enhances user satisfaction and trust, making the Super App an even more reliable daily companion. For an On-Demand Super App Development model, such instant assistance is paramount.</p><p><strong>4. Optimized Operations and Fraud Detection through AI</strong></p><p>Beyond direct user interaction, AI plays a vital role in the back-end operations of a Super App, optimizing efficiency and ensuring security. The complexity of managing multiple services, vast user data, and numerous transactions necessitates intelligent automation and robust security measures.</p><p>Fraud Detection and Security: AI algorithms can continuously monitor transaction patterns, user behavior, and network activities to detect anomalies and identify potential fraudulent activities or security breaches in real-time. This is crucial for protecting sensitive user data, especially in Super Apps that handle financial transactions.</p><p>Resource Optimization: AI can optimize resource allocation for various services, managing server loads, delivery routes, and even human agent deployment to ensure smooth operation and cost efficiency. For example, dynamically adjusting the number of ride-hailing drivers based on real-time demand.</p><p>Content Moderation and Compliance: In Super Apps with social or content-sharing features, AI can assist in moderating user-generated content to ensure compliance with platform policies and legal regulations.</p><p>Supplier and Partner Management: AI can help analyze performance data of third-party merchants and service providers within the ecosystem, ensuring quality control and identifying areas for improvement.</p><p>This behind-the-scenes application of AI ensures the Super App operates smoothly, securely, and efficiently, building trust with users and maintaining the integrity of the multi-service ecosystem. Robust Super App development services always incorporate advanced AI for these operational efficiencies and security protocols.</p><p><strong>5. Continuous Improvement and Evolution driven by AI</strong></p><p>The dynamic nature of user needs and market trends requires a Super App to continuously evolve. AI provides the framework for this continuous improvement, enabling the app to learn and adapt over time.</p><p>Learning from User Interactions: Every user interaction provides data that AI models can use to refine their understanding of user preferences and improve the accuracy of predictions and recommendations. This creates a self-improving loop.</p><p>A/B Testing and Feature Optimization: AI can facilitate extensive A/B testing of new features, UI layouts, and messaging, allowing the development team to quickly identify what works best and optimize the app based on real user feedback.</p><p>Bug Detection and Performance Monitoring: AI-powered tools can monitor app performance in real-time, detect anomalies, identify potential bugs or bottlenecks, and even suggest solutions, ensuring a consistently smooth user experience.</p><p>Personalized Onboarding: AI can tailor the onboarding experience for new users, guiding them through the features most relevant to their inferred needs or demographics, accelerating adoption.</p><p>This continuous learning and optimization cycle, driven by AI, ensures that the Super App remains highly relevant, performant, and engaging over time.

Your workers could be on fire, stuck in an endless queue, and you'd be the one to blame here. </p><p>where we're staring at logs hoping to divine the health of our distributed systems. Time to set up some proper monitoring.</p><p>Celery is one way of doing distributed task processing, but it's opaque when it comes to observability. You can see logs, but logs don't tell you if workers are healthy, how long tasks are taking, or whether your queue is backing up. That's where Flower comes in, it's the one of the monitoring tools for Celery environments.</p><p>This guide covers integrating Flower with Prometheus and Grafana to get proper metrics-driven monitoring. Whether you're using Grafana Cloud, self-hosted Grafana, the k8s-monitoring Helm chart, or individual components, we'll walk through the setup, explain why each piece matters, and tackle the gotchas.</p><ul><li>Kubernetes cluster with Celery workers already running</li><li>Some form of Prometheus-compatible metrics collection (Alloy, Prometheus Operator, plain Prometheus, etc.)</li><li>Grafana instance (cloud or self-hosted)</li><li>Basic Kubernetes knowledge</li><li>Patience for the inevitable configuration mysteries</li></ul><h2>\n  \n  \n  Understanding the Architecture\n</h2><p>Before diving into configuration, let's understand what we're building. Flower sits between your Celery workers and your monitoring system. It connects to your message broker (Redis/RabbitMQ), watches worker activity, and exposes metrics in Prometheus format.</p><p>The flow looks like this:</p><ol><li>Celery workers process tasks from the broker</li><li>Flower monitors the broker and worker activity</li><li>Flower exposes metrics at  endpoint</li><li>Your metrics collector (Prometheus/Alloy) scrapes these metrics</li><li>Grafana visualizes the data</li></ol><p>The key insight is that Flower doesn't directly monitor workers, it monitors the broker's state and worker events, which is why it can give you a complete picture of your distributed system.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  The Setup: Flower with Prometheus Metrics\n</h2><p>Here's the thing about Flower, it's great at showing you pretty graphs in its web UI, but getting it to export metrics for Prometheus requires a specific flag that's easy to miss. By default, Flower only exposes basic Python process metrics, which are useless for understanding your Celery workload.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Deploy Flower (the Right Way)\n</h3><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>That  flag is doing the heavy lifting here. Without it, you'll get basic Python process metrics (memory usage, GC stats, etc.) but none of the Celery-specific goodness like worker status, task counts, or queue depths. This flag tells Flower to export its internal monitoring data in Prometheus format.</p><p>The broker URL needs to match exactly what your Celery workers are using. Flower connects to the same broker to observe worker activity and task flow. If there's a mismatch, Flower won't see your workers.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>The named port () is crucial for ServiceMonitor configurations later. Many monitoring setups rely on port names rather than numbers for service discovery, making your configuration more resilient to port changes.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Metrics Collection: Choose Your Adventure\n</h2><p>How you get these metrics into your monitoring system depends entirely on your infrastructure setup. Kubernetes monitoring has evolved into several different patterns, each with its own tradeoffs.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Option 1: ServiceMonitor (Prometheus Operator/k8s-monitoring)\n</h3><p>ServiceMonitors are part of the Prometheus Operator ecosystem and provide declarative configuration for scrape targets. They're the cleanest approach if you're using Prometheus Operator or the k8s-monitoring Helm chart.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>The critical detail here is  vs . ServiceMonitors reference the service's port definition, not the container port directly. This indirection allows you to change container ports without updating monitoring configs.</p><p>Getting this configuration right requires the same attention to detail as any other infrastructure code.<a href=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fmedia4.giphy.com%2Fmedia%2Fv1.Y2lkPTc5MGI3NjExb3R3eXJxNGJxajZzc2RkbTF3bWUxM241MzEzMjUzNXppNWQ1MnJpNyZlcD12MV9pbnRlcm5hbF9naWZfYnlfaWQmY3Q9Zw%2FJWnXY237vWeX3zx64V%2Fgiphy.gif\"><img src=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fmedia4.giphy.com%2Fmedia%2Fv1.Y2lkPTc5MGI3NjExb3R3eXJxNGJxajZzc2RkbTF3bWUxM241MzEzMjUzNXppNWQ1MnJpNyZlcD12MV9pbnRlcm5hbF9naWZfYnlfaWQmY3Q9Zw%2FJWnXY237vWeX3zx64V%2Fgiphy.gif\" width=\"450\" height=\"450\"></a></p><p>One character difference can mean the difference between working monitoring and hours of debugging.</p><p>Here, the  restricts which namespaces this ServiceMonitor applies to. Without it, the ServiceMonitor tries to find matching services across all namespaces, which can cause confusion in multitenant clusters.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Option 2: Prometheus Annotations\n</h3><p>If you're using vanilla Prometheus with annotation based discovery, you configure scraping through service annotations. This is simpler but less flexible than ServiceMonitors.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>The annotations tell Prometheus to scrape this service. Your Prometheus configuration needs to include a job that discovers services with these annotations. This approach is more straightforward but offers less control over scraping behavior.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Option 3: Alloy Configuration (Manual)\n</h3><p>Grafana Alloy offers more flexibility than traditional Prometheus. You can configure complex discovery and relabeling rules to handle dynamic environments.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>This configuration discovers pods with the  label, applies relabeling rules to construct proper scrape targets, and forwards metrics to your storage backend. The relabeling rules transform Kubernetes metadata into the format Prometheus expects.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Option 4: Static Prometheus Config\n</h3><p>For simple setups or development environments, static configuration is the most straightforward approach.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>This hardcodes the service endpoint, which works fine for stable environments but doesn't handle dynamic scaling or service changes gracefully.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Verification: Making Sure It Actually Works\n</h2><p>Before diving into dashboard creation, verify that metrics are flowing correctly. This saves hours of troubleshooting later when you're wondering why your graphs are empty.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Check the Metrics Endpoint\n</h3><div><pre><code>kubectl port-forward svc/flower-service 5555:5555\ncurl http://localhost:5555/metrics\n</code></pre></div><p>You should see metrics that look like this:</p><div><pre><code>flower_worker_online{worker=\"celery@worker-1\"} 1.0\nflower_events_total{task=\"process_data\",type=\"task-sent\"} 127.0\nflower_worker_number_of_currently_executing_tasks{worker=\"celery@worker-1\"} 3.0\nflower_task_prefetch_time_seconds{task=\"process_data\",worker=\"celery@worker-1\"} 0.001\n</code></pre></div><p>If you're only seeing basic Python metrics (<code>python_gc_objects_collected_total</code>, <code>process_resident_memory_bytes</code>, etc.), you're missing the  flag. The Celery-specific metrics are what make this whole exercise worthwhile.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Check Your Monitoring System\n</h3><p>The verification process depends on your monitoring setup:</p><p><strong>For ServiceMonitor setups</strong>: Check the Prometheus Operator or Alloy UI for discovered targets. Look for your Flower service in the targets list with status \"UP\".</p><p>: Navigate to your Prometheus targets page () and verify the Flower job appears with healthy status.</p><p>: Check your collector's logs for any scraping errors and verify the target appears in the monitoring system's target list.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Understanding the Metrics\n</h2><p>Flower exports several categories of metrics, each providing different insights into your Celery system:</p><p>:  tells you which workers are active. <code>flower_worker_number_of_currently_executing_tasks</code> shows current load per worker.</p><p>:  tracks task lifecycle events (sent, received, started, succeeded, failed). These form the basis for throughput and success rate calculations.</p><p>: <code>flower_task_runtime_seconds</code> (histogram) shows task execution duration. <code>flower_task_prefetch_time_seconds</code> measures queue wait time.</p><p>: Various metrics help you understand queue depth and processing patterns.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Building Useful Dashboards\n</h2><p>Now for the payoff - turning those metrics into actionable insights. The key is building dashboards that help you answer specific operational questions.</p><p>: \"Are my workers running? How many are active?\"</p><div><pre><code># Total online workers\nsum(flower_worker_online)\n\n# Per-worker status\nflower_worker_online\n</code></pre></div><p>: \"How many tasks are we processing? Is throughput increasing?\"</p><div><pre><code># Tasks being sent to workers (per second)\nrate(flower_events_total{type=\"task-sent\"}[5m])\n\n# Tasks being processed (per second)\nrate(flower_events_total{type=\"task-received\"}[5m])\n</code></pre></div><p>: \"Is my queue backing up? How long do tasks wait?\"</p><div><pre><code># Tasks currently executing\nsum(flower_worker_number_of_currently_executing_tasks)\n\n# Time tasks spend waiting in queue\nflower_task_prefetch_time_seconds\n</code></pre></div><p>: \"How long do tasks take? Are they getting slower?\"</p><div><pre><code># 95th percentile task duration\nhistogram_quantile(0.95, rate(flower_task_runtime_seconds_bucket[5m]))\n\n# Median task duration\nhistogram_quantile(0.50, rate(flower_task_runtime_seconds_bucket[5m]))\n</code></pre></div><h3>\n  \n  \n  Dashboard Design Philosophy specifically for celery\n</h3><p>Start with high-level health indicators, then provide drill-down capabilities. A good Celery dashboard answers these questions in order:</p><ol><li>: Are workers running? Is the system processing tasks?</li><li>: How much work are we doing? Is it increasing or decreasing?</li><li>: How fast are tasks completing? Are there performance regressions?</li><li>: Are tasks backing up? Where are the bottlenecks?</li></ol><p>Real Celery deployments often have specialized workers for different task types. CPU-intensive tasks, I/O-bound tasks, and priority queues all need separate monitoring.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Each Flower instance monitors a specific Celery app, giving you granular visibility into different workload types. You'll need separate services and scrape configurations for each instance.</p><p>This approach lets you set different SLAs and alerting thresholds for different workload types. Your real-time fraud detection tasks might need sub-second response times, while your batch report generation can tolerate longer delays.</p><p>Flower itself is lightweight, but its resource needs scale with worker count and task frequency. A busy system with hundreds of workers and thousands of tasks per minute will use more memory to track state.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>For self-hosted setups, configure Grafana to read from your Prometheus instance:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>This assumes Prometheus and Grafana are in the same cluster. For cross-cluster or external access, you'll need appropriate networking and authentication configuration.</p><p>Production Flower deployments need proper security controls. Flower's web interface shows detailed information about your task processing, which could be sensitive.</p><p>Enable basic authentication at minimum:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>For production systems, consider OAuth integration or running Flower behind an authentication proxy. Celery-exporter provides similar metrics without the web interface overhead. It's purpose-built for Prometheus integration and might use fewer resources than Flower. However, you lose Flower's web interface for ad-hoc investigation.</p><p>Getting Celery monitoring right requires attention to several key details:</p><ul><li>The  flag transforms Flower from a simple web interface into a proper metrics exporter</li><li>Your metrics collection method should match your infrastructure setup and operational preferences</li><li>ServiceMonitor port configuration matters -  references service ports,  references container ports</li><li>Label matching between ServiceMonitors, services, and pods must be exact</li><li>Your monitoring system's target discovery UI is invaluable for debugging configuration issues</li></ul><p>The setup might seem complicated, but each piece serves a specific purpose in building a robust monitoring system. Once you have this foundation, you can extend it with alerting rules, additional dashboards, and integration with your incident response workflow.</p>","contentLength":11208,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"üò± Spent 3 days chasing a ghost bug?","url":"https://dev.to/aleksei_aleinikov/spent-3-days-chasing-a-ghost-bug-3imi","date":1751354992,"author":"Aleksei Aleinikov","guid":178737,"unread":true,"content":"<p>üî• Next time: fix it in 3 minutes.</p><p>A tiny Python feature (since 3.8) turns prints into instant micro-logs ‚Äî no setup, no overhead, pure clarity.</p>","contentLength":147,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"üêçüí• Think bytearray is just a Python toy?

With multiple tech groups on different platforms, such as meetup and eventbright, there are often events of interest happening that many tech enthusiasts are not aware of. The intent is to have a single resource that includes local tech groups and the events they host.</p><p>Many developers in our community, especially those earlier in their career, have skills and drive, but haven't had the opportunity to work on a project in a real professional environment. For example, a developer could have great knowledge in coding, but hasn't yet had the first professional job or participated in project with milestones, project planning, code reviews, etc. The Spokane Tech project aims to provide this and give contributes a project they can reference for career development, personal portfolios, interviews, etc. </p><p>What our project (and webapp) becomes will ultimately be dictated by members of the project and will likely evolve over time. Below are some details of the initial vision.</p><p>Have a web site that houses groups and events. Events may be manually or automatically added to our site. We will have views that list all the groups and events, as well as detail pages for each group and event. Ideally we'll also have a calendar view that can list all events and perhaps be filterable.</p><p>Have event requests and suggestions capabilities. Here members can post a suggested events they want to give or have someone else give, and others can up/down vote the event (think reddit or stackoverflow). This can be used to prioritize events base on community interest. This can also serve as a living backlog of event ideas. Add labels to events, such as technical areas (frontend, scripting, ML, etc.) and topic levels (beginner/intermediate/etc.). With labels people can filter event based on interest and other criteria.</p><p>Build member profiles. With profiles, we can have some basic metrics on things like career level, geographic location, interested and expertise. This data can help provide viability into the overall tech presence in Spokane and help drive event topics and location. This could also be a future resource to make available to local businesses and the community for things like contract work, etc. (There has been some outside interest in this type of resource)</p><p>The Spokane Tech project was started mostly by members of the Spokane Python User Group (SPUG), so naturally the first version of the website is based on python.

This isn't just a list of functions; it is the very soul of your agent's power. A well-forged arsenal, where every blade is sharp and serves a unique purpose, is the difference between an agent that is defeated by the first obstacle and one that conquers any challenge.</p><p>In this guide, you are the master blacksmith. Using the transparent and powerful <a href=\"https://github.com/The-Pocket/PocketFlow\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"></a> framework as your forge, we will teach you how to craft an arsenal of actions that will turn your agent from a clumsy squire into a legendary warrior.</p><h2><strong>The Battle Tactician: How an Agent Chooses Its Weapon</strong></h2><p>So, we have an arsenal. But how does the agent, our digital warrior, know when to draw a longsword for a close-quarters fight versus firing a bow from a distance?</p><p>This critical decision happens in the ‚Äîthe agent's battle tactician. At its core, every agent is just a simple loop that consults its tactician, who then chooses an action from the arsenal. The chosen action is performed, and the results are reported back to the tactician to plan the next move.</p><p>Visually, the battle plan looks like this:</p><ol><li><strong> (The Tactician):</strong> This is the brain. It analyzes the battlefield (the user's request and current data).</li><li><strong>The Arrows (The Commands):</strong> Based on its analysis, the tactician issues a command: , , or . This is the branch in the graph.</li><li><strong>The Action Nodes (The Specialists):</strong> Each command goes to a specialist soldier who executes that one task.</li><li><strong>The Loop Back (The Report):</strong> After the specialist completes their task, they report back to the tactician with new information, and the cycle begins again.</li></ol><p>\"But what magic happens inside that  node?\" you ask. \"How does it  think?\"</p><p>This is the most misunderstood part of agent design, and the secret is shockingly simple.  There's no complex algorithm, just a carefully written set of instructions for the LLM.</p><p>The tactician's \"brain\" is a prompt that looks something like this:</p><div><pre><code>### CONTEXT\nYou are a research assistant. Here is the current situation:\nQuestion: {the user's original question}\nPrevious Actions: {a log of what has been done so far}\nCurrent Information: {any data gathered from previous actions}\n\n### ARSENAL (Available Actions)\nHere are the weapons you can use. Choose one.\n\n[1] search_web\n  Description: Search the internet for up-to-date information.\n  Parameters:\n    - query (str): The specific topic to search for.\n\n[2] write_file\n  Description: Save text into a local file.\n  Parameters:\n    - filename (str): The name of the file to create.\n    - content (str): The text content to write into the file.\n\n[3] answer_question\n  Description: Provide the final answer to the user.\n  Parameters:\n    - answer (str): The complete, final answer.\n\n## YOUR NEXT COMMAND\nReview the CONTEXT and choose the single best ACTION from your ARSENAL to proceed.\nFormat your response as a YAML block.\n</code></pre></div><p>That's it! The agent's entire decision-making process boils down to this: the LLM reads the description of the situation and the \"user manual\" for every weapon in its arsenal, and then it picks the one that makes the most sense.</p><p>The quality of its choice is <strong>100% dependent on how clearly you describe its weapons.</strong> A sharp, well-defined arsenal in your prompt leads to a smart, effective agent. A vague, confusing one leads to a warrior who brings a knife to a dragon fight.</p><p>Now, let's learn how to forge these weapons, from simple daggers to god-tier magic spells.</p><h2><strong>Level Up Your Arsenal: The Three Tiers of Weapon Complexity</strong></h2><p>As a master blacksmith, you wouldn't forge just one type of weapon. You need a full range, from simple daggers for quick jabs to powerful, enchanted swords for epic battles. The same is true for your agent's arsenal. Actions can be designed with varying levels of power and complexity. Let's explore the three tiers.</p><h3><strong>Level 1: The Simple Dagger (The \"Button\" Action)</strong></h3><p>A simple dagger is a no-frills weapon. You draw it, you use it. It does one thing, and it does it reliably. These are actions that require .</p><p>Think of them as on/off switches or simple commands.</p><p>\nAn action like  or .</p><p><strong>In the Arsenal (Prompt Description):</strong></p><div><pre><code>[1] request_human_help\n  Description: If you are stuck or need clarification, use this action to pause and ask the human user for guidance.\n</code></pre></div><p>\nFor clear, binary decisions. When the agent needs to signal a state change, like \"I'm finished,\" \"I'm stuck,\" or \"I've failed.\" They are perfect for controlling the overall flow of the battle plan.</p><h3><strong>Level 2: The Sharpshooter's Bow (The Parameterized Tool)</strong></h3><p>A bow is useless without an arrow and a target. This weapon requires input to be effective. These are the most common and versatile actions in an agent's arsenal‚Äîactions that require  to function.</p><p>To use these weapons, the agent must not only choose the bow but also aim it by providing the correct inputs.</p><p>\nAn action like  or <code>send_email(to, subject, body)</code>.</p><p><strong>In the Arsenal (Prompt Description):</strong></p><div><pre><code>[2] search_web\n  Description: Searches the public internet for a given text string.\n  Parameters:\n    - query (str): The precise search term to look up. Must be a focused string.\n\n[3] send_email\n  Description: Composes and sends an email to a recipient.\n  Parameters:\n    - to (str): The email address of the recipient.\n    - subject (str): The subject line of the email.\n    - body (str): The main content of the email.\n</code></pre></div><p><strong>The Crucial Link to Your Blacksmithing Skills:</strong>\nHow does the agent provide these parameters? This is where your skill in  becomes critical. As we covered in our guide, <a href=\"https://pocketflow.substack.com/p/structured-output-for-beginners-3\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Structured Output for Beginners</a>, you must instruct the LLM to format its response in a structured way (like YAML or JSON) so your program can easily parse the action  its parameters.</p><p>Without this skill, you've given your agent a powerful bow but no way to nock an arrow.</p><h3><strong>Level 3: The Spellbook of Creation (The Programmable Action)</strong></h3><p>This is the ultimate weapon: a spellbook that doesn't contain a list of spells but teaches the agent how to . These are  where the agent generates code or complex instructions on the fly.</p><p>This gives the agent god-like flexibility to solve novel problems you never explicitly trained it for.</p><p>\nAn action like  or .</p><p><strong>In the Arsenal (Prompt Description):</strong></p><div><pre><code>[4] execute_sql\n  Description: Write and run a SQL query against the company's sales database. The database contains tables named 'customers', 'orders', and 'products'.\n  Parameters:\n    - sql_query (str): A valid SQL query string to execute.\n\n[5] run_python_code\n  Description: Write and execute a sandboxed Python script for complex calculations, data manipulation, or interacting with APIs.\n  Parameters:\n    - code (str): A string containing the Python code to run.\n</code></pre></div><p>\nA spellbook is the most powerful weapon in your arsenal, but it's also the most dangerous.</p><ul><li> Your agent can solve almost any problem that can be expressed in code. It's no longer limited to pre-defined tools.</li><li> It's much more likely to make a mistake (e.g., writing buggy code). More importantly, it opens up massive security risks if not handled carefully (e.g., executing malicious code like <code>os.remove(\"important_file.txt\")</code>). Always run such code in a secure, sandboxed environment.</li></ul><p>Mastering these three tiers allows you to build a balanced and effective arsenal, equipping your agent for any challenge it might face.</p><h2><strong>Forging the Perfect Arsenal: 3 Golden Rules for Your Weapon Inventory</strong></h2><p>A legendary warrior doesn't just carry a random assortment of weapons. Their arsenal is carefully curated‚Äîeach item is perfectly crafted, serves a distinct purpose, and is instantly accessible. As the master blacksmith for your agent, you must apply the same discipline. Here are the three golden rules for forging a world-class action space.</p><h3><strong>Golden Rule #1: Engrave a Crystal-Clear User Manual (Clarity is King)</strong></h3><p>The descriptions for your actions and their parameters are not notes for yourself; they are the . If the manual is vague, the LLM will misuse the tool. Be painfully, relentlessly explicit.</p><p><strong>A Dull Blade (Bad Description):</strong></p><div><pre><code>search: searches for stuff\n</code></pre></div><p>The agent sees this and thinks, \"What stuff? How? What do I provide?\" The result is a wild guess, like <code>search(query=\"who won the 2024 Nobel Prize in Physics and what were their contributions in detail and also list prior winners\")</code>, a query too broad to be effective.</p><p><strong>A Sharpened Katana (Good Description):</strong></p><div><pre><code>search_web(query: str):\n  Description: Searches the public internet for up-to-date information on a single, specific topic. Returns the top 5 text snippets.\n  Parameters:\n    - query (str): A simple and focused search query, typically 3-5 words long.\n</code></pre></div><p>Now the agent understands its constraints. It knows the tool is for  and the query should be . It will correctly generate a command like <code>search_web(query: \"2024 Nobel Prize Physics winner\")</code>, leading to a much better outcome.</p><h3><strong>Golden Rule #2: Don't Burden Your Warrior with a Junk Drawer (Keep it Concise)</strong></h3><p>A warrior grabbing a weapon in the heat of battle can't afford to sift through a hundred options. They need a small, elite set of choices. Overwhelming the LLM with too many actions leads to confusion, slower decision-making (more tokens to process), and a higher chance of picking the wrong tool.</p><blockquote><p><strong>The Blacksmith's Guideline:</strong> An arsenal of <strong>10 weapons is formidable. An arsenal of 100 is a junk drawer.</strong></p></blockquote><p>If your action space is growing too large, it's a sign that your tools are too granular. Instead of creating , , and , forge a single, more powerful weapon: . Your code can handle the internal logic of parsing different file types. Keep the agent's choices clean and high-level.</p><h3><strong>Golden Rule #3: Make Every Weapon Unique (Slay Redundancy)</strong></h3><p>Every weapon in the arsenal should have a unique purpose. If the agent has two tools that do similar things, it will get confused about which one to use. This is called a lack of \"orthogonality.\"</p><p><strong>The Confusing Arsenal (Bad Design):</strong></p><ul><li><code>read_csv_from_disk(file_path: str)</code>: Reads customer data from a local CSV file.</li><li>: Queries the live customer database.</li></ul><p>The agent is asked to \"find the total sales for new customers from this quarter.\" Which tool should it use? The data might be in the CSV, or it might be in the database. The agent doesn't know and might make the wrong choice.</p><p><strong>The Pro-Gamer Move: Simplify the Battlefield</strong>\nA true master blacksmith doesn't just forge weapons; they shape the battlefield to their advantage. Instead of giving the agent two ambiguous tools, do the work for it behind the scenes.</p><p><strong>The Decisive Arsenal (Good Design):</strong>\nBefore the agent even starts, run a script that <strong>loads the CSV data into a temporary table in the database.</strong></p><p>Now, the agent's arsenal is clean and unambiguous:</p><ul><li>: Queries the customer database, which contains all known customer data.</li></ul><p>The ambiguity is gone. The agent has one, and only one, tool for retrieving customer data. You've eliminated redundancy and made the agent's decision trivial, guaranteeing it makes the right choice every time.</p><h2><strong>Conclusion: An Agent is Only as Sharp as its Arsenal</strong></h2><p>And so, the secrets of the forge are yours. You now understand that the true power of an LLM agent doesn't come from some mysterious, hidden algorithm. It comes from the thoughtful, disciplined, and creative process of crafting its .</p><p>You've learned that agents are just warriors in a , making decisions based on a prompt that serves as their battle plan. And you've seen how to stock their arsenal for any challenge:</p><ul><li>  With  for quick, decisive commands.</li><li>  With  for precise, targeted actions.</li><li>  With reality-bending  for ultimate flexibility.</li></ul><p>Most importantly, you now hold the three golden rules of the master blacksmith:</p><ol><li> Your descriptions are the agent's guide to victory.</li><li> A curated, concise arsenal is deadlier than a cluttered one.</li><li> Make every weapon unique to ensure the agent never hesitates.</li></ol><p>The next time you see a complex agent framework with thousands of lines of code, you won't be intimidated. You'll know to look past the noise and ask the fundamental questions: \"What's in the arsenal? How is it described? Is it sharp, concise, and unique?\"</p><p>Armed with this knowledge, you are no longer just a coder; you are an . You have the power to forge not just tools, but intelligent, reliable, and effective digital warriors.</p><p><em>Ready to light the forge?

Because it's literally everywhere.</p><p>Python is used in web development, data science, machine learning, automation, and even artificial intelligence. But what is most appealing ‚Äî especially for new developers ‚Äî is how readable it is. The syntax is simple, the learning curve isn't so rough, and some people even joke that it feels like writing in plain English.</p><p>I started learning JavaScript about ten months ago. Once I honed my fundamentals in JavaScript, I wanted to learn a language that would open more doors and expand my horizon in tech beyond web development. Python kept coming up in conversations ‚Äî not just because it's powerful, but because people actually enjoy using it.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Indentation and Variables\n</h3><p>Right off the bat, two things will blow your mind about Python ‚Äî especially if you're coming from JavaScript.</p><p>First, Python uses indentation (whitespace) to define code blocks, rather than curly braces  like in JavaScript and many other languages. That means spacing of your code is very important.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Compare that to JavaScript:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>In Python, there's no need for  ‚Äî the indentation is the structure.</p><p>Another surprising quirk is how variables are declared. Python doesn't require keywords like , , or . You just write the variable name and assign a value.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>There's no need to specify types or use extra keywords ‚Äî Python figures it out for you.</p><p>Lists in Python are similar to arrays in JavaScript ‚Äî they can hold multiple values, are ordered, and are mutable (you can change them).</p><p>They have a very similar syntax, except that:</p><ul><li>Python typically uses  to declare variables and JavaScript uses .\n</li></ul><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Python also introduces another built-in data structure called . At first glance, tuples look a lot like lists ‚Äî they can store an ordered collection of elements ‚Äî but they come with a few key differences:</p><ul><li>Tuples are  ‚Äî meaning once created, their values cannot be changed.</li><li><strong>More memory-efficient and faster</strong> than lists, especially for large, fixed data sets.\n</li></ul><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Without the comma, Python will treat it as a plain string or number.</p><p>Python has a useful set of built-in methods you can use on lists and tuples. List methods such as , , , , , etc., allow efficient ways to manipulate and interact with data.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Tuples can also be used in real-world scenarios like coordinates or color values - places where you need fixed, unchanging data:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Read more about <a href=\"https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_ref_list.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">here</a>.</p><p>Tuples have fewer methods: mainly  and .</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><h3>\n  \n  \n  Conditional Statements and Logical Operators\n</h3><p>Python uses  to handle conditional logic.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Logical operators in Python:</p><ul><li> means both conditions must be true.</li><li> means at least one must be true.</li><li> inverts the truth value.\n</li></ul><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><h3>\n  \n  \n  For Loop and List Comprehension\n</h3><p>Python's  loops are super clean:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>List comprehensions let you build lists in a single line:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Try it yourself: Write a list comprehension that returns all even numbers from 0 to 20.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Functions and Lambda Functions\n</h3><p>Python functions use the  keyword:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Lambda functions are one-liner anonymous functions:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>You‚Äôll often see lambdas used in sorting, mapping, or filtering lists.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>While Python has a lot going for it ‚Äî especially its simplicity and readability ‚Äî it's not without tradeoffs.</p><ul><li>Python tends to run slower than JavaScript in browser-based environments.</li><li>It's not the best fit for mobile app development.</li><li>And because it's dynamically typed, it can lead to unexpected bugs if you're not careful with types.</li></ul><p>But in many cases, these drawbacks are outweighed by Python's ease of use, massive ecosystem, and wide range of applications ‚Äî especially in data science and automation.</p><p>As with any language, it's about choosing the right tool for the job.</p><p>This blog isn‚Äôt meant to cover  about Python ‚Äî instead, it‚Äôs a reflection of what stood out to me as a JavaScript developer learning Python for the first time. These are the things I found quirky, interesting, and surprisingly smooth to work with ‚Äî like list comprehensions, lambda functions, and Python‚Äôs indentation-based style.</p><p>There‚Äôs still  to explore in Python: Modules, Dictionaries, Classes and Object-Oriented Programming, File handling, Error handling‚Ä¶ the list goes on.</p><p>I‚Äôm still learning, and I plan to write more as I go deeper.

You can either use the  decorator, as I‚Äôve been using, which is the simplest and fastest way to create LLM methods. There‚Äôs also , which allows you to pass a list of chat messages to the LLM. This is especially useful for few-shot prompting, where you give the LLM some examples of what output you want. After all, LLMs  just fancy pattern matching black boxes.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>You can also pass <a href=\"https://magentic.dev/#functioncall\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">function calls to LLMs</a> to allow them to return a python callable that you can call later. Another use of this is the decorator  which allows you to have an LLM call a function and use the returned results to generate its response.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>If you‚Äôre a data conscious person, or just want your options to be open, Magentic can be configured to work with nearly all other LLMs as long as they are supported by <a href=\"https://github.com/BerriAI/litellm\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">LiteLLM</a> or offer an OpenAI compatible API. Here‚Äôs an example of a script that runs entirely locally using <a href=\"https://ollama.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Ollama</a> and <a href=\"https://ollama.com/library/gemma3\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Google‚Äôs Gemma 3</a>.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>You can use the LiteLLM method to use Anthropic‚Äôs Claude series of models, or you can use Magentic‚Äôs official Anthropic extension.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Need an async function? Just prefix with  instead of  !</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>You can use Python‚Äôs  to make multiple simultaneous calls to the LLM.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Need to stream the response back to the user? Use Magentic‚Äôs  to loop through the response chunks.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>This also works for multiple objects, simply wrap your objects in the  class.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Working with LLMs is now easier than ever, and Magnetic makes it even easier than the standard methods to quick add LLMs to any Python script, regardless of the scale of complexity. Using this in tandem with something like uv and the new scripting metadata allows you to quickly make command line tools that can utilize AI quickly and effectively. I won‚Äôt always use Magentic for every project I need an LLM for, but I‚Äôll definitely use it all the time with my small one-offs and utilities.</p>","contentLength":4433,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"How to Set Up a Django Project Structure Using VS Code","url":"https://dev.to/annnab2222/how-to-set-up-a-django-project-structure-using-vs-code-3189","date":1751309721,"author":"Hannah","guid":176859,"unread":true,"content":"<p>If you're just getting started with Django and want to build your project using Visual Studio Code (VS Code), you're in the right place.

I focused on creating and structuring my Django project while learning a lot about apps, templates, and URL configurations. Here‚Äôs a friendly walkthrough of how I accomplished it using Git Bash as my terminal.</p><h4><strong>1. Starting the Django Project</strong> üöÄ\n</h4><p>The first step was to create a new Django project named . This project would serve as the foundation for everything else. Using Git Bash, I navigated to my desired directory and set up a virtual environment:</p><div><pre><code>dijango\ndijango\npython  venv venv\nvenv/bin/activate  \nvenvcriptsctivate   </code></pre></div><p>Next, I installed Django and created the project:</p><div><pre><code>pip django\ndjango-admin startproject dijango </code></pre></div><p>Here‚Äôs what the structure looked like at this point:</p><ul><li>: The project‚Äôs control center.</li><li>: A directory containing core files like , , and others.</li></ul><h4> üõ†Ô∏è\n</h4><p>Django encourages splitting functionality into smaller units called apps. I created two apps,  and , to separate different functionalities:</p><div><pre><code>python manage.py startapp REE1\npython manage.py startapp REE2\n</code></pre></div><p>Each app came with its own files, like  and . To make Django recognize these apps, I added them to the  section in :</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Templates define how the front-end of the app looks. Using Git Bash, I created a  directory in the root folder and added subfolders for each app:</p><div><pre><code>templates\ntemplates/REE1\ntemplates/REE2\n</code></pre></div><p>In , I updated the  configuration to include the new directory:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>URL configurations connect specific views to URLs. Since Django doesn‚Äôt create  files for apps by default, I manually added them for  and .</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>I then updated the main project‚Äôs  to include these app-specific routes:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><h4><strong>5. Adding Views and Templates</strong> üñºÔ∏è\n</h4><p>In Django, views determine what gets displayed for each URL. I created simple views for both apps:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Next, I added basic HTML templates:</p><p><code>templates/REE1/index.html</code>:</p><div><pre><code>REE1 IndexWelcome to REE1!</code></pre></div><p>:</p><div><pre><code>REE2 HomeWelcome to REE2!</code></pre></div><p>Using Git Bash throughout this process made it easy to execute commands and navigate between directories. As I continue exploring Django, I look forward to building more complex projects and honing my skills.

It defines how URLs are routed to views ‚Äî basically deciding what happens when someone visits a specific page. - Entry point for ASGI (Asynchronous Server Gateway Interface), which allows your Django app to support asynchronous features like WebSockets and background tasks. -     Entry point for WSGI (Web Server Gateway Interface), which helps traditional web servers like Gunicorn or uWSGI serve your Django project.

I've spent years wrestling with latency spikes and resource constraints across edge devices, cloud instances, and embedded systems. These eight Python techniques consistently deliver performance gains while preserving accuracy.  </p><p>Model quantization reduces numerical precision to shrink memory footprint. Converting 32-bit floats to 16-bit or 8-bit integers accelerates calculations with minimal accuracy loss. In one deployment, this cut inference time by 60% on mobile processors. Here's practical TensorFlow implementation:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Pruning eliminates redundant neural connections. I approach this as iterative sculpting - gradually removing low-weight connections during training. Sparsity patterns emerge naturally, like finding efficient pathways through dense forests:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Batching strategies maximize hardware utilization. Grouping requests leverages parallel processing capabilities. I implement dynamic batching that adapts to fluctuating loads:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>ONNX Runtime provides hardware-agnostic acceleration. Switching execution providers lets me optimize for specific environments. This snippet shows how I configure sessions for different hardware:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Apache TVM compiles models to hardware-native code. Ahead-of-time compilation generates optimized executables. I use this for deploying to edge devices with limited resources:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Asynchronous pipelines separate I/O from computation. This design pattern overlaps preprocessing with model execution. My implementation handles concurrent requests efficiently:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Knowledge distillation transfers capabilities to smaller models. I train compact student models using guidance from larger teacher models. This technique maintains accuracy while reducing computational demands:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Monitoring production systems detects performance degradation. Statistical tests identify data drift and model decay. I implement continuous validation with this approach:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>These techniques form a comprehensive toolkit for inference optimization. Each addresses specific constraints I've encountered in real-world deployments. Quantization excels on mobile processors, while TVM shines in cross-compilation scenarios. Asynchronous patterns prove invaluable in high-throughput APIs, and distillation creates efficient specialized models. Performance monitoring completes the lifecycle, ensuring sustained accuracy.  </p><p>The most effective solutions combine multiple approaches. I typically start with quantization and pruning during model export, then layer hardware-specific optimizations like TVM compilation. For server deployments, I implement batching and asynchronous pipelines. Edge deployments benefit most from quantization and TVM. Continuous monitoring provides safety nets for all scenarios.  </p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Through careful implementation, I've achieved latency reductions up to 85% compared to baseline implementations. Resource consumption often drops to one-third of original requirements. These gains enable applications previously considered impractical - real-time video analysis on IoT devices, high-frequency trading predictions, and responsive medical diagnostics. The Python ecosystem provides robust tools, but thoughtful architecture determines ultimate performance.\n</h2><p>üìò , , , and  to the channel!</p><p> is an AI-driven publishing company co-founded by author .

As a developer who loves a good retro arcade game and is curious about AI-driven development, this was the perfect excuse to dive in. The mission was simple: build a game using Amazon Q's command-line interface, document the journey, and share the results.</p><p>The result? A fully-functional, nostalgic side-scrolling shooter called , and a ton of insights into pairing AI with a classic coding project. Here‚Äôs how it went down.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  My Game: \"Space Conquer\" - A Modern-Classic Shooter\n</h2><p>For my project, I chose to build , a side-scrolling space shooter inspired by the classic  from old Nokia phones.</p><ol><li> Like many, I have fond memories of playing . I wanted to capture that simple, addictive fun but with a modern coat of paint‚Äîbetter graphics, dynamic sound, and smoother controls.</li><li> A 2D shooter involves a fantastic mix of programming challenges that are perfect for an AI assistant: managing game states, handling real-time user input, collision detection, and creating varied enemy behaviors.</li><li> I didn't just want to build a game; I wanted to build a . My vision was a modular design where new enemies, power-ups, or levels could be added easily. This is where an AI's ability to generate structured, boilerplate code would really shine.</li></ol><p>Space Conquer features diverse enemies, collectible power-ups, dynamic audio that changes with the game state, and even a hidden developer panel for testing.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Unlocking AI's Potential: Effective Prompting Techniques\n</h2><p>Working with Amazon Q CLI is a conversation. The better your questions, the better the answers. I quickly learned that vague prompts like \"make a game\" were less effective than breaking down the problem into specific, well-defined tasks.</p><p>Here are a few prompting techniques I discovered.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Technique 1: Requesting a Modular Architecture\n</h3><p>Instead of asking for a single, monolithic script, I prompted for a clean, organized structure from the start.</p><blockquote><p> \"Create a project structure for a PyGame-based space shooter. I need separate modules for asset management, sprites (player, enemies, bullets), UI components, and the main game loop. The asset manager should load images and sounds from manifest files.\"</p></blockquote><p> Amazon Q generated a directory structure (, , ) and starter Python files for each module (, , , ). The generated  included a function to read a JSON manifest, which was a huge head start.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Technique 2: Defining Behavior with Roles and Rules\n</h3><p>When creating enemies, I defined their characteristics and constraints clearly.</p><blockquote><p> \"Generate a Python class  that inherits from . It needs attributes for health, speed, and score value. Then, create a subclass  that moves in a sine wave pattern down the screen and fires a bullet every 2 seconds.\"</p></blockquote><p> Q provided a base  class and a well-defined  subclass with its  method already implementing the sine wave movement using . This saved me from figuring out the trigonometry and timing loops myself.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  How AI Handled Classic Programming Challenges\n</h2><p>Game development is full of recurring problems. Here's how Amazon Q helped tackle some of the classics:</p><ul><li><p> A game needs distinct states like 'main_menu', 'gameplay', 'settings', and 'game_over'. I prompted the AI to implement a simple state machine. It generated a  class that held the current state and handled transitions, ensuring that the main menu logic didn't run during gameplay and vice-versa.</p></li><li><p> A core mechanic of any shooter. I asked Q for an efficient way to check for collisions between player bullets and enemies, and between the player and enemy ships or bullets. It suggested using PyGame's built-in <code>pygame.sprite.groupcollide()</code> function, providing a concise and performant solution that I could drop right into my main game loop.</p></li><li><p> I wanted power-ups to drop randomly from destroyed asteroids. I prompted: \"When an asteroid is destroyed, there should be a 15% chance of it dropping a power-up. The power-up type (health, speed, rapid-fire) should be chosen randomly.\" The AI generated a clean <code>if random.random() &lt; 0.15:</code> check and a  call to select from a list of power-up types.</p></li></ul><h2>\n  \n  \n  Time-Saving Automation: More Than Just Code\n</h2><p>One of the biggest wins was using AI for automation  the code. The project summary mentions developer tools, and Q was instrumental here.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  The Asset Manifest Generator\n</h3><p>My game uses JSON files to manage all assets (images, sounds, maps). Manually keeping these in sync is tedious.</p><blockquote><p> \"Write a Python script for the  directory that scans the  and  directories and automatically generates a  file with all the file paths.\"</p></blockquote><p>This single prompt created a utility script that saved me countless minutes of error-prone manual editing every time I added a new enemy sprite or sound effect.</p><h4>\n  \n  \n  The Cross-Platform Launcher\n</h4><p>I wanted a simple way for anyone to run the game, regardless of their OS.</p><blockquote><p> \"Create a Python script named  that checks the user's operating system. It should ensure all dependencies from  are installed using pip and then launch the  script.\"</p></blockquote><p>Q generated a script using the  and  modules that provided a one-click experience‚Äîa small but professional touch that I might have skipped otherwise.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  AI-Generated Code That Impressed Me\n</h2><p>It's one thing to generate boilerplate, but another to produce elegant solutions. Here are a couple of snippets that stood out.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  1. Manifest-Driven Asset Loader\n</h3><p>This function, generated early on, set the foundation for the game's modularity. It loads all assets listed in a JSON file into a dictionary, making them easily accessible throughout the game.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>This design is clean, error-handled, and makes adding 50 new assets as easy as adding one.</p><ol><li>A Base Class for Animated UI Panels\nI wanted the UI to have a modern, \"glowing\" feel. I asked Q to create a reusable class for this.\n</li></ol><div><pre><code># Part of src/ui.py\nimport pygame\n\nclass GlowingPanel(pygame.sprite.Sprite):\n    \"\"\"\n    A UI panel that has a subtle pulsing glow effect by alpha blending.\n    \"\"\"\n    def __init__(self, rect, color, glow_color):\n        super().__init__()\n        self.rect = rect\n        self.color = color\n        self.glow_color = glow_color\n        self.image = pygame.Surface(self.rect.size, pygame.SRCALPHA)\n\n        self.glow_alpha = 100\n        self.glow_direction = 2 # Rate of change for alpha\n\n    def update(self):\n        \"\"\"Update the pulsing glow effect.\"\"\"\n        self.glow_alpha += self.glow_direction\n        if self.glow_alpha &gt;= 180 or self.glow_alpha &lt;= 80:\n            self.glow_direction *= -1\n\n        self.image.fill((0, 0, 0, 0)) # Clear with transparency\n\n        # Draw base panel\n        pygame.draw.rect(self.image, self.color, (0, 0, self.rect.width, self.rect.height), border_radius=8)\n\n        # Draw glow effect (a slightly larger rect with changing alpha)\n        glow_surface = pygame.Surface(self.rect.size, pygame.SRCALPHA)\n        glow_rect = pygame.Rect(0, 0, self.rect.width, self.rect.height)\n        glow_color_with_alpha = (*self.glow_color, self.glow_alpha)\n        pygame.draw.rect(glow_surface, glow_color_with_alpha, glow_rect, border_radius=10)\n\n        # Blit the glow onto the main surface\n        self.image.blit(glow_surface, (0,0), special_flags=pygame.BLEND_RGBA_ADD)\n</code></pre></div><p>This self-contained class for a UI element with its own animation logic is a great example of the object-oriented code Q can produce. It's reusable for scoreboards, health bars, or any other panel in the game.</p><p>Final Thoughts\nUsing Amazon Q CLI for the \"Build Games\" challenge was a fantastic experience. It didn't just write code for me; it acted as a partner that handled the tedious, boilerplate, and sometimes complex parts of development, freeing me up to focus on the creative vision for \"Space Conquer.\"</p><p>If you're a developer who hasn't tried integrating an AI assistant into your workflow, I highly recommend it. Pick a fun project, break it down into small pieces, and start prompting. You'll be surprised at how much you can build.</p><p>And hey, I might even get a t-shirt out of it.</p>","contentLength":8027,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"day 4: Django structure","url":"https://dev.to/rebecca254/day-4-django-structure-2hgj","date":1751295445,"author":"Rebecca-254","guid":176716,"unread":true,"content":"<p>Hello, today marks my 4th day in my journey of developers.

But once I fixed that, the server ran smoothly.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Step 7: Adding Templates for HTML Pages\n</h2><p>After getting simple text responses to show up using HttpResponse, I wanted to display proper HTML pages using templates.</p><p>So I created a templates folder inside each app\nIn both app1 and app2, I made this folder structure:</p><div><pre><code>app1/\n‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ templates/\n    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ app1/\n        ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ home.html\n</code></pre></div><div><pre><code>app2/\n‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ templates/\n    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ app2/\n        ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ home.html\n</code></pre></div><p>I created basic HTML files in both apps.</p><p>I updated the views to render templates\nIn app1/views.py:</p><div><pre><code>from django.shortcuts import render\n\ndef home(request):\n    return render(request, 'app1/home.html')\n</code></pre></div><div><pre><code>In app2/views.py:\n\n`from django.shortcuts import render\n\ndef home(request):\n    return render(request, 'app2/home.html')\n</code></pre></div><p>I ran the server with the following command</p><p><code>python manage.py runserver</code></p><p>Then I opened my browser and tested. this is what my page looked like after adding /app1 in the URL generated. </p><p>Seeing both apps work made me feel proud and confident in using Django.</p><ol><li>Django projects can be modular ‚Äî I can add many apps like I did with app1 and app2.</li><li>The outer folder (njeri) holds everything; the inner mysite/ config folder manages settings, URLs, and deployment files.</li><li>Even small mistakes (like forgetting include) can break the app ‚Äî but the error messages help a lot\n</li></ol><p>Building the njeri project taught me how Django is structured and how everything connects from creating apps, to writing views, to linking URLs.

This is called a <strong>time-domain representation</strong>, showing how the wave‚Äôs amplitude changes over time. This waveform shows the raw signal as it appears in an audio editor. The ups and downs reflect changes in loudness.</p><p> is the strength or intensity of a sound wave‚Äîin other words, how loud the sound is to the listener. In the previous image, it‚Äôs represented by the height of the wave from its center line.</p><p>A higher amplitude means a louder sound, while a lower amplitude means a quieter sound. When you adjust the volume on your device, you‚Äôre actually changing the amplitude of the audio signal. In digital audio, amplitude is typically measured in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decibel\">decibels (dB)</a> or as a normalized value between -1 and 1.</p><p> is how many times a sound wave repeats itself in one second, measured in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hertz\">hertz (Hz)</a>. For example, a low bass note is a sound wave that repeats slowly, about 50‚Äì100 Hz. In contrast, a high-pitched whistle has a wave that repeats much faster, around 2000‚Äì3000 Hz.</p><p>In music, different frequencies create different musical notes. For instance, the A note that musicians use to tune their instruments is exactly 440 Hz. Now, if you were to look at the frequency plot of the 440 Hz waveform from before, here‚Äôs what you‚Äôd see:</p><a href=\"https://files.realpython.com/media/frequency-domain-torchaudio.59106603f830.png\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://files.realpython.com/media/frequency-domain-torchaudio.59106603f830.png\" width=\"1980\" height=\"580\" alt=\"Frequency domain plot of a 440 HZ wave\"></a>A Frequency Domain Plot of a 440 Hz Wave\n\n<p>This plot displays the signal in the , which shows how much of each frequency is present in the sound. The distinct peak at 440 Hz indicates that this is the dominant frequency in the signal, which is exactly what you‚Äôd expect from a pure tone. While time-domain plots‚Äîlike the one you saw earlier‚Äîreveal how the sound‚Äôs amplitude changes over time, frequency-domain plots help you understand which frequencies make up the sound.</p><p>The waveform you just explored was from a 440 Hz wave. You‚Äôll soon see that many examples in audio processing also deal with this mysterious frequency. So, what makes it so special?</p><div><p> The <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A440_(pitch_standard)\">440 Hz frequency</a> (A note) is the international standard pitch reference for tuning instruments. Its clear, single-frequency nature makes it great for audio tasks. These include sampling, frequency analysis, and waveform representation.</p></div><p>Now that you understand frequency and how it relates to sound waves, you might be wondering how computers actually capture and store these waves. </p><p>When you record sound digitally, you‚Äôre taking snapshots of the audio wave many times per second. Each snapshot measures the wave‚Äôs amplitude at that instant. This is called sampling. The number of snapshots taken per second is the , measured in hertz (Hz).</p>","contentLength":4584,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"I Built a Tool to Search AI Conversations in 1 Week (With Heavy AI Assistance)","url":"https://dev.to/d_p_6e7c8572c8febaab6c33d/i-built-a-tool-to-search-ai-conversations-in-1-week-with-heavy-ai-assistance-2elj","date":1751291421,"author":"D P","guid":176676,"unread":true,"content":"<p>I had hundreds of AI conversations with Claude and ChatGPT.

The system, built on FastAPI and leveraging Pydantic for data validation, began intermittently flagging legitimate transactions as fraudulent. The root cause? A subtle interaction between Pydantic‚Äôs internal data manipulation and augmented assignment (, , etc.) when updating a shared, mutable state within an async worker pool. Specifically, the in-place modification of a list used for feature engineering was leading to race conditions and data corruption. This incident highlighted a critical gap in our understanding of augmented assignment‚Äôs behavior, particularly within concurrent and type-sensitive environments. This post details the intricacies of augmented assignment in Python, focusing on production considerations, debugging strategies, and best practices to avoid similar pitfalls.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  What is \"augmented assignment\" in Python?\n</h3><p>Augmented assignment operators (e.g., , , , , , , , , , , , ) are syntactic sugar for combining an arithmetic or bitwise operation with assignment.  Crucially, they are  always equivalent to the explicit operation followed by assignment.  This behavior is defined in PEP 203 and is tied to the , , etc., methods.  If an object defines an in-place operation method (e.g., ), augmented assignment will invoke that method. Otherwise, it falls back to the equivalent .</p><p>This distinction is vital.  For mutable objects like lists,  modifies the object in-place, avoiding a new allocation. For immutable objects like integers, the fallback behavior is used, creating a new object.  This difference impacts performance and, as we saw in the fraud detection incident, concurrency.  The typing system, as defined in PEP 484, treats augmented assignment as a special case, allowing for more precise type inference and static analysis.</p><ol><li><strong>FastAPI Request Handling:</strong>  In high-throughput APIs, accumulating request metrics (e.g., latency histograms) often uses augmented assignment to update counters in-place, minimizing allocation overhead.\n</li></ol><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><ol><li><p><strong>Async Job Queues (Celery/RQ):</strong>  Updating task progress or retry counts within a worker process benefits from the in-place modification offered by augmented assignment.</p></li><li><p><strong>Type-Safe Data Models (Pydantic/Dataclasses):</strong>  While Pydantic generally discourages direct mutation, internal operations like updating nested dictionaries or lists within a model can inadvertently use augmented assignment, leading to unexpected behavior if not carefully managed.</p></li><li><p> Accumulating statistics or processing large datasets in a CLI tool often utilizes augmented assignment for efficiency.</p></li><li><p><strong>ML Preprocessing (Pandas/NumPy):</strong>  In-place operations on NumPy arrays or Pandas DataFrames using augmented assignment are common for performance optimization, but require careful consideration of data sharing and potential side effects.</p></li></ol><h3>\n  \n  \n  Integration with Python Tooling\n</h3><p>Augmented assignment interacts significantly with Python‚Äôs tooling.</p><ul><li><p>  Mypy correctly infers types for augmented assignments, providing static type checking.  However, it can sometimes struggle with complex in-place operations on mutable objects, requiring explicit type annotations.</p></li><li><p> Pydantic‚Äôs validation and serialization logic can be affected by augmented assignment if mutable default values are used.  Using immutable defaults (e.g.,  instead of ) is a best practice.</p></li><li><p>  Testing code that uses augmented assignment requires careful consideration of state management.  Fixtures should be used to isolate tests and prevent unintended side effects.</p></li><li><p>  As demonstrated by the fraud detection incident, augmented assignment in concurrent code requires synchronization mechanisms (e.g., ) to prevent race conditions.</p></li></ul><p> configuration for mypy:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><h3>\n  \n  \n  Failure Scenarios &amp; Debugging\n</h3><p>The fraud detection incident was a prime example of a race condition. Multiple async workers were simultaneously modifying the same list, leading to inconsistent data.  Debugging involved:</p><ol><li> Adding detailed logging around the augmented assignment operation to track the state of the list.</li><li> Analyzing the exception traces to identify the point of failure.</li><li> Using  to step through the code and inspect the state of the variables.</li><li> Profiling the code to identify performance bottlenecks and areas where contention was occurring.</li></ol><p>Another common failure is unexpected behavior when an object doesn't define the  method, leading to a new object being created instead of modifying the original in-place. This can cause subtle bugs if the code relies on the original object being mutated.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Performance &amp; Scalability\n</h3><p>Augmented assignment can significantly improve performance by avoiding unnecessary object allocations. However, excessive in-place modification can lead to increased memory usage and contention in concurrent environments.</p><ul><li> Use  to benchmark the performance of augmented assignment versus explicit assignment.</li><li> Identify performance bottlenecks and areas where in-place modification is causing contention.</li><li> Minimize the use of shared mutable state to reduce the need for synchronization.</li><li> Limit the number of concurrent workers to reduce contention.</li></ul><p>Augmented assignment can introduce security vulnerabilities if used with untrusted data. For example, if a user-supplied value is used in an augmented assignment operation on a sensitive object, it could lead to code injection or privilege escalation.  Always validate and sanitize user input before using it in any operation.  Be particularly cautious when deserializing data from untrusted sources.</p><ul><li>  Write unit tests to verify the correctness of augmented assignment operations.</li><li>  Test the interaction of augmented assignment with other components of the system.</li><li><strong>Property-Based Tests (Hypothesis):</strong> Use Hypothesis to generate random inputs and verify that the code behaves correctly under a wide range of conditions.</li><li>  Enforce type safety using mypy.</li><li> Integrate testing and type validation into the CI/CD pipeline.</li></ul><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><h3>\n  \n  \n  Common Pitfalls &amp; Anti-Patterns\n</h3><ol><li> Using mutable default values in function arguments can lead to unexpected behavior with augmented assignment.</li><li> Assuming augmented assignment always modifies the object in-place.</li><li> Using augmented assignment in concurrent code without proper synchronization.</li><li><strong>Overuse of In-Place Modification:</strong>  Excessive in-place modification can lead to increased memory usage and contention.</li><li>  Failing to use type hints can make it difficult to reason about the behavior of augmented assignment.</li></ol><h3>\n  \n  \n  Best Practices &amp; Architecture\n</h3><ul><li>  Always use type hints to improve code clarity and prevent errors.</li><li>  Prefer immutable data structures whenever possible.</li><li>  Separate data manipulation logic from business logic.</li><li>  Validate and sanitize all user input.</li><li>  Design code in a modular way to improve testability and maintainability.</li><li>  Automate testing, type validation, and deployment.</li></ul><p>Augmented assignment is a powerful feature of Python, but it requires careful consideration, especially in production environments. Understanding its nuances, potential pitfalls, and interactions with other tools is crucial for building robust, scalable, and maintainable systems.  Refactor legacy code to use immutable data structures where appropriate, measure performance to identify bottlenecks, write comprehensive tests, and enforce type safety to mitigate risks.
