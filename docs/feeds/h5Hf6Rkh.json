For\nexample, this JAX snippet:</p><div><pre></pre></div><div><pre></pre></div><p>In both cases, the function decorated with  doesn't get executed by the\nPython interpreter in the normal sense. Instead, the code inside is more like\na DSL (Domain Specific Language) processed by a special purpose compiler built\ninto the library (JAX or Triton). Another way to think about it is that Python\nis used as a  to describe computations.</p><p>In this post I will describe some implementation strategies used by libraries to\nmake this possible.</p><div><h2>Preface - where we're going</h2><p>The goal is to explain how different kinds of  decorators work by using\na simplified, educational example that implements several approaches from\nscratch. All the approaches featured in this post will be using this flow:</p> Expr IR --&gt; LLVM IR --&gt; Execution\" /&gt; Expr IR --&gt; LLVM IR --&gt; Execution\" class=\"align-center\" src=\"https://eli.thegreenplace.net/images/2025/decjit-python.png\" /&gt;\n<p>These are the steps that happen when a Python function wrapped with\nour educational  decorator is called:</p><ol><li>The function is translated to an \"expression IR\" - .</li><li>This expression IR is converted to LLVM IR.</li><li>Finally, the LLVM IR is JIT-executed.</li></ol><p>First, let's look at the  IR. Here we'll make a big simplification -\nonly supporting functions that define a single expression, e.g.:</p><div><pre></pre></div><p>Naturally, this can be easily generalized - after all, LLVM IR can be used to\nexpress fully general computations.</p><p>Here are the  data structures:</p><div><pre></pre></div><p>To convert an  into LLVM IR and JIT-execute it, we'll use this function:</p><div><pre></pre></div><p>It uses the  class to actually generate LLVM IR from .\nThis process is straightforward and covered extensively in the resources I\nlinked to earlier; take a look at <a href=\"https://github.com/eliben/code-for-blog/blob/main/2025/decjit/exprcode.py\">the full code here</a>.</p><p>My goal with this architecture is to make things simple, but .\nOn one hand - there are several simplifications: only single expressions are\nsupported, very limited set of operators, etc. It's very easy to extend this!\nOn the other hand, we could have just trivially evaluated the \nwithout resorting to LLVM IR; I do want to show a more complete compilation\npipeline, though, to demonstrate that an arbitrary amount of complexity can\nbe hidden behind these simple interfaces.</p><p>With these building blocks in hand, we can review the strategies used by\n decorators to convert Python functions into s.</p></div><div><p>Python comes with powerful code reflection and introspection capabilities out\nof the box. Here's the  decorator:</p><div><pre></pre></div><p>This is a standard Python decorator. It takes a function and returns another\nfunction that will be used in its place ( ensures that\nfunction attributes like the name and docstring of the wrapper match the\nwrapped function).</p><div><pre></pre></div><p>After  is applied to , what  holds is the\nwrapper. When  is called, the wrapper is invoked with\n.</p><p>The wrapper obtains the AST of the wrapped function, and then uses\n to convert this AST into an :</p><div><pre></pre></div><p>When  finishes visiting the AST it's given, its\n field will contain the  representing the function's\nreturn value. The wrapper then invokes  with this .</p><p>Note how our decorator interjects into the regular Python execution process.\nWhen  is called, instead of the standard Python compilation and\nexecution process (code is compiled into bytecode, which is then executed\nby the VM), we translate its code to our own representation and emit LLVM from\nit, and then JIT execute the LLVM IR. While it seems kinda pointless in this\nartificial example, in reality this means we can execute the function's code\nin any way we like.</p><div><h3>AST JIT case study: Triton</h3><p>This approach is almost exactly how the Triton language works. The body of a\nfunction decorated with  gets parsed to a Python AST, which then\n- through a series of internal IRs - ends up in LLVM IR; this in turn is lowered\nto <a href=\"https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/\">PTX</a> by the\n<a href=\"https://llvm.org/docs/NVPTXUsage.html\">NVPTX LLVM backend</a>.\nThen, the code runs on a GPU using a standard CUDA pipeline.</p><p>Naturally, the subset of Python that can be compiled down to a GPU is limited;\nbut it's sufficient to run performant kernels, in a language that's much\nfriendlier than CUDA and - more importantly - lives in the same file with the\n\"host\" part written in regular Python. For example, if you want testing and\ndebugging, you can run Triton in \"interpreter mode\" which will just run the\nsame kernels locally on a CPU.</p><p>Note that Triton lets us import names from the  package\nand use them inside kernels; these serve as the  for the language\n- special calls the compiler handles directly.</p></div></div><div><p>Python is a fairly complicated language with  of features. Therefore,\nif our JIT has to support some large portion of Python semantics, it may make\nsense to leverage more of Python's own compiler. Concretely, we can have it\ncompile the wrapped function all the way <a href=\"https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/main/InternalDocs/interpreter.md\">to bytecode</a>,\nand start our translation from there.</p><p>Here's the  decorator that does just this :</p><div><pre></pre></div><p>The Python VM is a stack machine; so we emulate a stack to convert the\nfunction's bytecode to  IR (a bit like an <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_Polish_notation\">RPN evaluator</a>).\nAs before, we then use our  utility function to lower\n to LLVM IR and JIT execute it.</p><p>Using this JIT is as simple as the previous one - just swap \nfor :</p><div><pre></pre></div><div><h3>Bytecode JIT case study: Numba</h3><p><a href=\"https://numba.pydata.org/\">Numba</a> is a compiler for Python itself. The idea\nis that you can speed up specific functions in your code by slapping a\n decorator on them. What happens next is similar in spirit to\nour simple , but of course much more complicated because it\nsupports a very large portion of Python semantics.</p><p>Numba uses the Python compiler to emit bytecode, just as we did; it then\nconverts it into its own IR, and then to LLVM using .</p><p>By starting with the bytecode, Numba makes its life easier (no need to rewrite\nthe entire Python compiler). On the other hand, it also makes some analyses\n, because by the time we're in bytecode, a lot of semantic information\nexisting in higher-level representations is lost. For example, Numba has to\nsweat a bit to recover control flow information from the bytecode (by\nrunning it through a special interpreter first).</p></div></div><div><p>The two approaches we've seen so far are similar in many ways - both rely on\nPython's introspection capabilities to compile the source code of the JIT-ed\nfunction to some extent (one to AST, the other all the way to bytecode), and\nthen work on this lowered representation.</p><p>The tracing strategy is very different. It doesn't analyze the source code of\nthe wrapped function at all - instead, it  its execution by means of\nspecially-boxed arguments, leveraging overloaded operators and functions, and\nthen works on the generated trace.</p><p>The code implementing this for our smile demo is surprisingly compact:</p><div><pre></pre></div><p>Each runtime argument of the wrapped function is assigned a , and\nthat is placed in a , a placeholder class which lets us\ndo operator overloading:</p><div><pre></pre></div><p>The remaining key function is :</p><div><pre></pre></div><p>To understand how this works, consider this trivial example:</p><div><pre></pre></div><p>After the decorated function is defined,  holds the wrapper function\ndefined inside . When  is called, the wrapper runs:</p><ol><li>For each argument of  itself (that is  and ), it creates\na new  holding a . This denotes a named variable in\nthe  IR.</li><li>It then calls the wrapped function, passing it the boxes as runtime\nparameters.</li><li>When (the wrapped)  runs, it invokes . This is caught by the overloaded\n operator of , and it creates a new  with\nthe s representing  and  as children. This\n is then returned .</li><li>The wrapper unboxes the returned  and passes it to\n to emit LLVM IR from it and JIT execute it with the\nactual runtime arguments of the call: .</li></ol><p>This might be a little mind-bending at first, because there are two different\nexecutions that happen:</p><ul><li>The first is calling the wrapped  function itself, letting the Python\ninterpreter run it as usual, but with special arguments that build up the IR\ninstead of doing any computations. This is the .</li><li>The second is lowering this IR our tracing step built into LLVM IR and then\nJIT executing it with the actual runtime argument values ; this is\nthe .</li></ul><p>This tracing approach has some interesting characteristics. Since we don't\nhave to analyze the source of the wrapped functions but only trace through\nthe execution, we can \"magically\" support a much richer set of programs, e.g.:</p><div><pre></pre></div><p>This  with our basic . Since Python variables are\nplaceholders (references) for values, our tracing step is oblivious to them - it\nfollows the flow of values. Another example:</p><div><pre></pre></div><p>This also just works! The created  will be a long chain of \nadditions of 's runtime values through the loop, added to the \nfor .</p><p>This last example also leads us to a limitation of the tracing approach; the\nloop cannot be  - it cannot depend on the function's arguments,\nbecause the tracing step has no concept of runtime values and wouldn't know\nhow many iterations to run through; or at least, it doesn't know this unless\nwe want to perform the tracing run for every runtime execution .</p><div><h3>Tracing JIT case study: JAX</h3><p>The <a href=\"https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/\">JAX ML framework</a> uses a tracing\napproach very similar to the one described here. The first code sample in this\npost shows the JAX notation. JAX cleverly wraps Numpy with its own version which\nis traced (similar to our , but JAX calls these boxes \"tracers\"),\nletting you write regular-feeling Numpy code that can be JIT optimized and\nexecuted on accelerators like GPUs and TPUs via <a href=\"https://github.com/openxla\">XLA</a>. JAX's tracer builds up an underlying IR (called\n<a href=\"https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/jaxpr.html\">jaxpr</a>) which can then be\nemitted to XLA ops and passed to XLA for further lowering and execution.</p><p>For a fairly deep overview of how JAX works, I recommend reading the\n<a href=\"https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/autodidax.html\">autodidax doc</a>.</p><p>As mentioned earlier, JAX has <a href=\"https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/jit-compilation.html\">some limitations</a>\nwith things like data-dependent control flow in native Python. This won't work,\nbecause there's control flow\nthat depends on a runtime value ():</p><div><pre></pre></div><p>When  is executed, JAX will throw an exception, saying something\nlike:</p><blockquote>\nThis concrete value was not available in Python because it depends on the\nvalue of the argument count.</blockquote><p>As a remedy, JAX has its\nown built-in intrinsics from the <a href=\"https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/jax.lax.html\">jax.lax package</a>.\nHere's the example rewritten in a way that actually works:</p><div><pre></pre></div><p> (and many other built-ins in the  package) is something JAX\ncan trace through, generating a corresponding XLA operation (XLA has support for\n<a href=\"https://openxla.org/xla/operation_semantics\">While loops</a>, to which this\n can be lowered).</p><p>The tracing approach has clear benefits for JAX as well; because it only cares\nabout the flow of values, it can handle arbitrarily complicated Python code,\nas long as the flow of values can be traced. Just like the local variables and\ndata-independent loops shown earlier, but also things like closures. This makes\nmeta-programming and templating easy .</p></div></div><div><p>The full code for this post is available <a href=\"https://github.com/eliben/code-for-blog/tree/main/2025/decjit\">on GitHub</a>.</p></div>","contentLength":10514,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Hugo van Kemenade: Improving licence metadata","url":"https://hugovk.dev/blog/2025/improving-licence-metadata/","date":1739545860,"author":"","guid":339,"unread":true,"content":"<p><a href=\"https://peps.python.org/pep-0639/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">PEP 639</a> defines a spec on how to document licences\nused in Python projects.</p><p>Change  as follows.</p><p>I usually use Hatchling as a build backend, and support was added in 1.27:</p><div><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code></code></pre></div><p>Replace the freeform  field with a valid SPDX license expression, and add\n which points to the licence files in the repo.

These keywords are always availableâyouâll never have to import them into your code.</p><p>Python keywords are different from Pythonâs <a href=\"https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html\">built-in functions and types</a>. The built-in functions and types are also always available, but they arenât as restrictive as the keywords in their usage. </p><p>An example of something you  do with Python keywords is assign something to them. If you try, then youâll get a . You wonât get a  if you try to assign something to a built-in function or type, but it still isnât a good idea. For a more in-depth explanation of ways keywords can be misused, check out <a href=\"https://realpython.com/invalid-syntax-python/#misspelling-missing-or-misusing-python-keywords\">Invalid Syntax in Python: Common Reasons for SyntaxError</a>.</p><p>There are <a href=\"https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#keywords\">thirty-five keywords</a> in Python. Hereâs a list of them, each linked to its relevant section in this tutorial:</p><p>Two keywords have additional uses beyond their initial use cases. The  keyword is also <a href=\"https://realpython.com/atom.xml#the-else-keyword-used-with-loops\">used with loops</a> and <a href=\"https://realpython.com/atom.xml#the-else-keyword-used-with-try-and-except\">with  and </a> in addition to in conditional statements. The  keyword is most commonly used in  statements, but also used <a href=\"https://realpython.com/atom.xml#the-as-keyword-used-with-with\">with the  keyword</a>.</p><p>The list of Python keywords and soft keywords has changed over time. For example, the  and  keywords werenât added until Python 3.7. Also, both  and  were keywords in Python 2.7 but were turned into built-in functions in Python 3 and no longer appear in the keywords list.</p><p>As mentioned above, youâll get an error if you try to assign something to a Python keyword. Soft keywords, on the other hand, arenât that strict. They syntactically act as keywords only in certain conditions.</p><p>This new capability was made possible thanks to the introduction of the <a href=\"https://realpython.com/python39-new-features/#a-more-powerful-python-parser\">PEG parser</a> in Python 3.9, which changed how the interpreter reads the source code.</p><p>Leveraging the PEG parser allowed for the introduction of <a href=\"https://realpython.com/structural-pattern-matching/\">structural pattern matching</a> in Python. In order to use intuitive syntax, the authors picked , , and  for the pattern matching statements. Notably,  and  are widely used for this purpose in many other programming languages.</p><p>To prevent conflicts with existing Python code that already used , , and  as variable or function names, Python developers decided to introduce the concept of soft keywords.</p><p>Currently, there are four  in Python:</p><p>You can use the links above to jump to the soft keywords youâd like to read about, or you can continue reading for a guided tour.</p><h2>Value Keywords: , , </h2><p>There are three Python keywords that are used as values.

Since then, we have granted almost EUR 350k through the programme, partly via EuroPython Finaid and by directly supporting other Python events and projects across Europe. In the last two years, the Grant Programme has grown to EUR 100k per year, with even more requests coming in.</p><p>With this growth come new challenges in how to distribute funds fairly so that more events can benefit. Looking at data from the past two years, weâve often been close to or over our budget. The guidelines havenât been updated in a while. As grant requests become more complex, weâd like to simplify and clarify the process, and better explain it on our website.</p><p>We would also like to acknowledge that EuroPython, when traveling around Europe, has an additional impact on the host country, and weâd like to set aside part of the budget for the local community.</p><p>The Grant Programme is also a primary funding source for EuroPython Finaid. To that end, we aim to allocate 30% of the total Grant Programme budget to Finaid, an increase from the previous 25%.</p><ul><li>Weâve updated the <a href=\"https://www.europython-society.org/grants\">text on our website</a>, and split it into multiple sub-pages to make it easier to navigate. The website now includes a checklist of what we would like to see in a grant application, and a checklist for the Grants Workgroup â so that when you apply for the Grant you already know the steps that it will go through later and when you can expect an answer from us.</li><li>We looked at the data from previous years, and size and timing of the grant requests. With the growing number and size of the grants, to make it more accessible to smaller conferences and conferences happening later in the year, we decided to introduce max caps per grant and split the budget equally between the first and second half of the year. We would also explicitly split the total budget into three categories â 30% goes to the EuroPython finaid, 10% is reserved for projects in the host country. The remaining 60% of the budget goes to fund other Python Conferences. This is similar to the split in previous years, but more explicit and transparent.</li></ul><p>Using 2024 data, and the budget available for Community Grants (60% of total), weâve simulated different budget caps and found a sweet spot at 6000EUR, where we are able to support all the requests with most of the grants being below that limit.

She is currently a member of the Django 6.x <a href=\"https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/internals/organization/#steering-council\">Steering Council</a> and she has been a DSF member since March 2021. \nYou can learn more about Lily by visiting <a href=\"https://github.com/LilyFoote\">her GitHub profile</a>.</p><p>Letâs spend some time getting to know Lily better!</p><h4>Can you tell us a little about yourself (hobbies, education, etc)</h4><p>My name is Lily Foote and Iâve been contributing to Django for most of my career. Iâve also recently got into Rust and Iâm excited about using Rust in Python projects. When Iâm not programming, I love hiking, climbing and dancing (Ceilidh)! I also really enjoying playing board games and role playing games (e.g. Dungeons and Dragons).</p><h4>How did you start using Django?</h4><p>Iâd taught myself Python in my final year at university by doing <a href=\"https://projecteuler.net/\">Project Euler</a> problems and then decided I wanted to learn how to make a website. Django was the first Python web framework I looked at and it worked really well for me.</p><h4>What other framework do you know and if there is anything you would like to have in Django if you had magical powers?</h4><p>Iâve done a small amount with Flask and FastAPI. More than any new features, I think the thing that Iâd most like to see is more long-term contributors to spread the work of keeping Django awesome.</p><h4>What projects are you working on now?</h4><p>The side project Iâm most excited about is <a href=\"https://github.com/LilyFoote/django-rusty-templates\">Django Rusty Templates</a>, which is a re-implementation of Djangoâs templating language in Rust.</p><h4>Which Django libraries are your favorite (core or 3rd party)?</h4><h4>What are the top three things in Django that you like?</h4><p>Django Conferences, the mentorship program Djangonaut Space and the whole community!</p><h4>You have been a mentor multiple times with GSoC and Djangonaut Space program, what is required according to you to be a good mentor?</h4><p>I think being willing to invest time is really important. Checking in with your mentees frequently and being an early reviewer of their work. I think this helps keep their motivation up and allows for small corrections early on.</p><h4>Any advice for future contributors?</h4><p>Start small and as you get more familiar with Django and the process of contributing you can take on bigger issues. Also be patient with reviewers â Django has high standards, but is mostly maintained by volunteers with limited time.</p><p>Yes! Itâs a huge honour! Since January, weâve been meeting weekly and it feels like weâve hardly scratched the surface of what we want to achieve. The biggest thing weâre trying to tackle is how to improve the contribution experience â especially evaluating new feature ideas â without draining everyoneâs time and energy.</p><h4>You have a lot of knowledge in the Django ORM, how did you start to contribute to this part?</h4><p>I added the Greatest and Least expressions in Django 1.9, with the support of one of the core team at the time. After that, I kept showing up (especially at conference sprints) and finding a new thing to tackle.</p><h4>Is there anything else youâd like to say?</h4><p><strong>Thank you for doing the interview, Lily!</strong></p>","contentLength":3110,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Quansight Labs Blog: PEP 517 build system popularity","url":"https://labs.quansight.org/blog/pep-517-build-system-popularity","date":1739232000,"author":"","guid":322,"unread":true,"content":"<article>Analysis of PEP 517 build backends used in 8000 top PyPI packages</article>","contentLength":65,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Seth Michael Larson: Building software for connection (#2: Consensus)","url":"https://sethmlarson.dev/building-software-for-connection-consensus?utm_campaign=rss","date":1739232000,"author":"","guid":323,"unread":true,"content":"<p>In the <a href=\"http://sethmlarson.dev/building-software-for-connection-local-first\">previous article</a> we concluded that a persistent always-on internet\nconnection isn't required for software to elicit feelings of connection between humans.</p><div><div><p>Building on this conclusion: let's explore how Animal Crossing software was able to intercommunicate without requiring\na centralized server and infrastructure and the trade-offs for these design decisions.</p></div></div><h2>Distributing digital goods without the internet</h2><p>Animal Crossing has over 1,000 unique items that need to be collected\nfor a complete <a href=\"https://nookipedia.com/wiki/Catalog\">catalog</a>, including furniture, wallpapers, clothing, parasols, and carpets.\nMany of these items are quite rare or were only programmed to be accessible\nthrough an official Nintendo-affiliated distribution such as a magazine or online contest.</p><p>Beyond official distributions, it's clear Animal Crossings' designer, Katsuya Eguchi,\nwanted players to  to complete their catalogs.\nThe game incentivized trading items between towns by assigning\none â<a href=\"https://nookipedia.com/wiki/Fruit\">native fruit</a>â (Apple, Orange, Cherry, Peach, or Pear) and\nrandomly making a subset of items harder to find than others depending\non a <a href=\"https://nookipedia.com/wiki/Group\">hidden âitem groupâ variable</a> (either A, B, or C).</p><p>Items could be exchanged between players when one player visits another town,\nbut this required physically bringing your memory card to another\nplayers' GameCube. The GameCube might have come with a handle, but the 'cube wasn't exactly a . Sharing a physical space isn't something you can do with everyone or on a regular basis.</p><div><div><p>So what did Katsuya Eguchi design for Animal Crossing? To allow for item distributions from magazines and contests and to make player-to-player item sharing easier Animal Crossing included a feature called â<a href=\"https://nookipedia.com/wiki/Secret_code\">secret codes</a>â.</p><p>This feature worked by allowing players to exchange 28-character codes with Tom Nook for items. Players could also generate codes for their friends to âsendâ an item from their own game to a different town. Codes could be shared by writing them on a paper note, instant message, or text message.</p></div></div><h2>The forgotten durability of offline software</h2><div><div><p>\nThis <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Gamecube/comments/1gqfbae\">Reddit comment thread</a> from the GameCube subreddit was the initial inspiration for this entire series.\nThe post is about someone's niece who just started playing Animal Crossing for the first time.\nThe Redditor asked folks to send items to their nieces' town using the secret code system.\n</p><p>This ended up surprising many folks that this system \n in a game that was over 23 years old!\nFor reference, Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection and Nintendo Network were only available for 8 and 13 years respectively.\nBelow are a handful of the comments from the thread:</p><blockquote><ul><li>âFor real does this still work lol?â</li></ul></blockquote></div></div><p>It's hard not to take these comments as indicators that something is\n with internet-connected software today. What had to go wrong for a \nsystem continuing to work to ? Many consumers' \nexperience with \nsoftware products\ntoday is that they become useless e-waste after some far-away service is \ndiscontinued a few years after purchase.</p><p>My intuition from this is that software that <em>requires centralized servers and infrastructure to function</em>\nwill have shorter lifetimes than software which is offline or only\nopportunistically uses online functionality.</p><p>I don't think this is particularly insightful,\nmore dependencies always means less resilience. But if we're building software for human connection then the software\nshould optimally only be limited by the <em>availability of humans to connect</em>.</p><h2>What is centralization good for?</h2><div><div><p>Animal Crossings' secret code system is far from perfect. The system is easily abusable, as the same secret codes can be\nreused over-and-over by the same user to duplicate items without ever expiring. The only limit was that 3 codes could be used per day.</p></div></div><p>Not long after Animal Crossing's release\nthe secret code algorithm was <a href=\"https://togenyanweb.appspot.com/Yokai/eplus/eplus.html\">reverse-engineered</a> so secret codes \nfor any item could be created for any town and recipient name as if they came from an official Nintendo distribution.\nThis was possible because the secret code system relied on \"<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_through_obscurity\">security through obscurity</a>\".</p><p>Could  be the answer to preventing these abuses?</p><p>The most interesting property that a centralized authority approach\nprovides is : forcing everyone to play by the same rules. By storing\nthe âsingle source-of-truthâ a central authority is able to prevent abuses\nlike the ones mentioned above.</p><p>For example, a centralized âsecret code issuing serverâ could generate\nnew unique codes per-use and check each code's validity\nagainst a database to prevent users from generating their\nown illegitimate codes or codes being re-used multiple times.</p><p>The problem with\ncentralized consensus is it tends to be  to cover the entire software state.\nA centralized server can generate codes perfectly, but how can that same server\n that the items you're exchanging for codes were obtained legitimately? To know this\nthe server would <em>also need to track item legitimacy</em>, leading to software which requires\nan internet connection to operate.</p><p>This is optimal from a correctness perspective, but as was noted earlier,\nI suspect that if such a server was a mandatory part of the secret code system\nin Animal Crossing that the system <em>would likely not be usable today</em>.</p><p>This seems like a trade-off, <em>which future would you rather have?</em></p><h2>Redesigning Animal Crossing secret codes</h2><p>If I were designing Animal Crossings' secret code system with modern hardware, what would it look like?\nHow can we keep the offline fall-back while providing consensus and being less\nabusable, especially for official distributions.</p><p>I would likely use a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public-key_cryptography\">public-key cryptographic</a> system for official distributions,\nembedding a certificate that could be used to âverifyâ that specific secret codes\noriginated from the expected centralized entity. Codes that are accepted would be\nrecorded to prevent reusing the same code multiple times in the same town.\nUsing public-key cryptography prevents the\nsystem from being reverse-engineered to distribute arbitrary items until the certificate\nprivate key was cracked.</p><p>For sharing items between players I would implement a system where each town\ngenerated a public and private key and the public key was shared to other towns\nwhenever the software was able to, such as when a player visited the other town.\nPlayers would only be able to send items to players that they have visited\n(which for Animal Crossing <em>required physical presence</em>, more on this later!)</p><p>Each sender could store a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic_nonce\">nonce</a> value for\neach potential recipient. Embedding that nonce into the secret code would allow\nthe recipients' software to verify that the specific code hadn't been used yet.\nThe nonce wouldn't have to be long to avoid simple reusing of codes.</p><p>Both above systems would require much more data to be embedded into each âsecret\ncodeâ compared to the 28-character codes from the GameCube. For this I would\nuse QR codes to embed over 2KB of data into a single QR code. Funnily enough,\nAnimal Crossing New Leaf and onwards <a href=\"https://nookipedia.com/wiki/QR_code\">use QR code technology</a> for players to share design patterns.</p><p>This design is still abusable if users can modify their software or hardware\nbut doesn't suffer from the trivial-to-exploit flaws of Animal Crossing's secret code system.</p><h2>Decentralized global consensus?</h2><div><div><p>What if we could have the best of both worlds: we want consensus\nthat is both  and . At least today, we are out of luck.</p><p>Decentralized global consensus is <a href=\"https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf\">technologically feasible</a>, but the existing solutions\n(mostly blockchains)\nare expensive (both in energy and capital) and can't handle throughput on any sort of \nmeaningful scale.</p></div></div><p>There are many other decentralized consensus systems that \nare able to form âpocketsâ of <em>useful peer-to-peer consensus</em> using a fraction of\nthe resources, such as email, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BitTorrent\">BitTorrent</a>, <a href=\"https://activitypub.rocks/\">ActivityPub</a>, and <a href=\"https://nostr.com/\">Nostr</a>.\nThese systems are only possible by adding  or by only guaranteeing .</p><h2>When is global consensus needed?</h2><p>Obviously global consensus is important for certain classes of software like \nfinancial, civics, and infrastructure, but I wonder how the necessity\nof consensus in software changes for software with different risk\nprofiles.</p><p>For software which has fewer risks associated with misuse is there as much\nneed for global consensus?\nHow can  be designed to reduce risk and require\nless consensus to be effective? If global consensus and centralized \nservers become unnecessary, can we expect  to be usable \non much longer timescales, <em>essentially for as long as there are users?</em></p>","contentLength":8378,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Python Morsels: Newlines and escape sequences in Python","url":"https://www.pythonmorsels.com/newlines-and-escape-sequences/","date":1739200649,"author":"","guid":321,"unread":true,"content":"<p>This string contains a newline character:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>That's what  represents: a newline character.</p><p>If we print this string, we'll see that  becomes an  newline:</p><p>Why does Python represent a newline as ?</p><h2>Escape sequences in Python</h2><p>Every character in a Python â¦</p>","contentLength":244,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"How to Join Strings in Python","url":"https://realpython.com/python-join-string/","date":1739196000,"author":"Real Python","guid":114,"unread":true,"content":"<p>Pythonâs built-in string method  lets you combine string elements from an iterable into a single string, using a separator that you specify.

The method returns a single string, where it has inserted the separator string between each element of the iterable:</p><p>In this example, you joined a list of words into one sentence, separated by spaces.</p><p>At first glance, this usage might look a little backward. In many other <a href=\"https://realpython.com/python-strings/\">string operations</a>, you call the method on the main string that you want to manipulate. However, with , you call the method on the separator string, then pass the iterable of strings that you want to combine:</p><p>This example achieves the same result as the earlier one but splits the process into two steps.

By default,  separates a string at each occurrence of whitespace, which includes spaces, tabs, and newlines. This makes it particularly handy when dealing with plain text where words are separated by spaces:</p><p>As you can see,  divides the sentence into individual words, removing the spaces in the process. Itâs important to note that  also strips newlines by default, which might not be immediately obvious:</p><p>The  method treats the newline characters as whitespace, and splits the text into individual words rather than lines. This is a crucial point to remember when <a href=\"https://realpython.com/python-split-string/#split-strings-by-lines-with-splitlines\">working with multiline strings</a>.</p><p>The simplicity of  makes it a powerful tool for string manipulation. Whether youâre processing text files or parsing user input, using  can streamline your workflow.</p><p>When youâre faced with the task of cleaning up messy text, you may want to pair  with . You can learn more about using  by expanding the collapsible section below:</p><div><div data-parent=\"#collapse_cardddefa9\"><div><p>You may encounter code that uses  in combination with another string method, :</p><p>In this example, youâre dealing with text that contains whitespace characters at the beginning and end of . You may see results like this when working with data that you received through <a href=\"https://realpython.com/web-scraping-with-scrapy-and-mongodb/\">web scraping</a>, copy-paste artifacts <a href=\"https://realpython.com/creating-modifying-pdf/\">from PDFs</a>, or even regular <a href=\"https://realpython.com/python-keyboard-input/\">user input</a>.</p><p>Combining  and  is a common and straightforward way to break potentially messy text into manageable <a href=\"https://realpython.com/natural-language-processing-spacy-python/#tokens-in-spacy\">tokens</a>.</p><p>The idea is that you first remove superfluous whitespace characters from the beginning and end of the string using . This operation returns a new string object without that whitespace. You then <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Method_chaining\">chain</a> to this cleaned output, allowing it to break the text into elementsâin this case, individual words.</p><p>If youâre only dealing with messy whitespace, however, then you donât need to use  to get to a clean result:</p><p>Because  splits on any whitespace and ignores extra leading and trailing whitespace, the result is the same as when you first explicitly remove leading and trailing whitespace with .</p><p>Nevertheless, there may be advantages to adding  into the mix:</p><ul><li> You clearly communicate to other developers that you intend to apply data cleaningâand <a href=\"https://realpython.com/zen-of-python/\">readability counts</a>!</li><li> You may later need to update your code to split on a different delimiter, in which case  wonât remove extra whitespace automatically. A well-designed additional step of explicitly removing whitespace with  can prevent surprises.</li></ul><p>If youâre only splitting on whitespace, then you likely wonât need to use . However, due to developer habits and a preference for explicitness, you may still come across this combination of string methods in the wild.</p></div></div></div><p>When you use , it returns a list of substrings. This means that you can iterate over the result, access individual elements using indexing, or <a href=\"https://realpython.com/python-assignment-operator/#unpacking-iterables\">unpack the iterable</a> into separate variables.</p><p>For example, when youâre dealing with user input, you might want to extract specific pieces of information:</p><p>In this code snippet, you take a string containing a name, surname, and age, and split it into a list of three separate strings. Then, you unpack the list into three descriptive variables. Finally, you use an <a href=\"https://realpython.com/python-f-strings/\">f-string</a> to format the output.</p><div role=\"alert\"><p> Extracting data pieces like this is useful when youâre dealing with structured data where you know the position of each element beforehand, and you can rely on consistent use of whitespace.</p></div><p>In this section, youâve learned how to use Pythonâs  method to divide strings into smaller parts based on whitespace. This method is invaluable when working with plain text data, allowing you to extract and manipulate information. By understanding the default behavior of , including its treatment of newlines, youâll be well-equipped to handle a variety of string manipulation tasks in your Python projects.</p><p>In the next section, youâll explore how to customize the behavior of  by specifying different delimiters, enabling you to tackle more complex string splitting scenarios.</p><h2>Split With Different Delimiters Using </h2><p>By default,  uses any whitespace as a delimiter to separate a string into a list of substrings. However, many real-world scenarios require splitting strings using other delimiters. This is where the  parameter comes into play.</p><p>Imagine that youâre parsing data from a CSV (comma-separated values) file.

In practice, youâll find two main types of loops:</p><ol><li><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/For_loop\"> loops</a> are mostly used to iterate a  number of times, which is common when youâre processing data collections with a specific number of data items.</li><li><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/While_loop\"> loops</a> are commonly used to iterate an  number of times, which is useful when the number of iterations depends on a given condition.</li></ol><p>Python has both of these loops and in this tutorial, youâll learn about . In Python, youâll generally use  loops when you need to iterate over the items in a data collection. This type of loop lets you traverse different data collections and run a specific group of statements  or  each item in the input collection.</p><p>In Python,  loops are <a href=\"https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html\">compound statements</a> with a  and a  that runs a predefined number of times. The basic syntax of a  loop is shown below:</p><p>In this syntax,  is the loop variable. In each iteration, this variable takes the value of the current item in , which represents the data collection you need to iterate over. The loop body can consist of one or more statements that must be indented properly.</p><p>Hereâs a more detailed breakdown of this syntax:</p><ul><li> is the keyword that initiates the loop header.</li><li> is a variable that holds the current item in the input iterable.</li><li> is a keyword that connects the loop variable with the iterable.</li><li> is a data collection that can be iterated over.</li><li> consists of one or more statements to execute in each iteration.</li></ul><p>Hereâs a quick example of how you can use a  loop to iterate over a list:</p><p>In this example,  is the loop variable, while the  list is the target collection. Each time through the loop,  takes on a successive item from . In this loop, the body consists of a call to <a href=\"https://realpython.com/python-print/\"></a> that displays the value on the screen. This loop runs once for each item in the target iterable. The way the code above is written is the <a href=\"https://realpython.com/learning-paths/writing-pythonic-code/\">Pythonic</a> way to write it.</p><p>However, whatâs an <a href=\"https://realpython.com/python-iterators-iterables/#getting-to-know-python-iterables\">iterable</a> anyway? In Python, an  is an objectâoften a data collectionâthat can be iterated over. Common examples of iterables in Python include <a href=\"https://realpython.com/python-list/\">lists</a>, <a href=\"https://realpython.com/python-tuple/\">tuples</a>, <a href=\"https://realpython.com/python-strings/\">strings</a>, <a href=\"https://realpython.com/python-dicts/\">dictionaries</a>, and <a href=\"https://realpython.com/python-sets/\">sets</a>, which are all built-in data types. You can also have custom classes that support iteration.</p><div role=\"alert\"><p> Python has both iterables and iterators. Iterables support the  consisting of the <a href=\"https://realpython.com/python-magic-methods/\">special method</a>. Similarly, iterators support the  thatâs based on the  and  special methods.</p><p>Both iterables and iterators can be iterated over. All iterators are iterables, but not all iterables are iterators. Python iterators play a fundamental role in  loops because they drive the iteration process.</p></div><p>You can also have a loop with multiple loop variables:</p><p>In this loop, you have two loop variables,  and . Note that to use this syntax, you just need to provide a tuple of loop variables. Also, you can have as many loop variables as you need as long as you have the correct number of items to <a href=\"https://realpython.com/python-tuple/#packing-and-unpacking-tuples\">unpack</a> into them. Youâll also find this pattern useful when iterating over <a href=\"https://realpython.com/python-for-loop/#collections-dictionaries-and-sets\">dictionary</a> items or when you need to do <a href=\"https://realpython.com/python-for-loop/#looping-over-several-iterables-in-parallel\">parallel iteration</a>.</p><p>Sometimes, the input iterable may be empty.

Most are available on <a href=\"https://pypi.org/\">PyPI</a> and can be installed with <a href=\"https://realpython.com/what-is-pip/\"></a>. However, a few are available only on GitHub, GitLab, or other code sharing locations, and they may require other installation steps. This article will cover installation methods for all the engines discussed.</p><p>Python is a general purpose programming language, and itâs used for a variety of tasks other than writing computer games. In contrast, there are many different stand-alone game engines that are tailored specifically to writing games. Some of these include:</p><p>These stand-alone game engines differ from Python game engines in several key aspects:</p><ul><li> Languages like C++, C#, and JavaScript are popular for games written in stand-alone game engines, as the engines themselves are often written in these languages. Very few stand-alone engines support Python.</li><li><strong>Proprietary scripting support:</strong> In addition, many stand-alone game engines maintain and support their own scripting languages, which may not resemble Python. For example, Unity uses C# natively, while Unreal works best with C++. </li><li> Many modern stand-alone game engines can produce games for a variety of platforms, including mobile and dedicated game systems, with very little effort. In contrast, porting a Python game across various platforms, especially mobile platforms, can be a major undertaking.</li><li> Games written using a stand-alone game engine may have different licensing options and restrictions, based on the engine used.</li></ul><p>So why use Python to write games at all? In a word, Python. Using a stand-alone game engine often requires you to learn a new programming or scripting language. Python game engines leverage your existing knowledge of Python, reducing the learning curve and getting you moving forward quickly.</p><p>There are many game engines available for the Python environment. The engines that youâll learn about here all share the following criteria:</p><ul><li>Theyâre relatively popular engines, or they cover aspects of gaming that arenât usually covered.</li><li>Theyâre currently maintained.</li><li>They have good documentation available.</li></ul><p>For each engine, youâll learn about:</p><ul><li>Basic concepts, as well as assumptions that the engine makes</li><li>Major features and capabilities</li><li>Two game implementations, to allow for comparison</li></ul><p>Where appropriate, you should install these game engines in a <a href=\"https://realpython.com/python-virtual-environments-a-primer/\">virtual environment</a>. Full source code for the games in this tutorial is available for download at the link below and will be referenced throughout the article:</p><p>With the source code downloaded, youâre ready to begin.</p><p>When people think of Python game engines, the first thought many have is <a href=\"https://www.pygame.org\">Pygame</a>.

F-strings are string literals that you can create by prepending an  or  to the literal. They allow you to do string interpolation and formatting by inserting variables or expressions directly into the literal.</p><h3>Creating F-String Literals</h3><p>Here youâll take a look at how you can create an f-string by prepending the string literal with an  or :</p><p>Using either  or  has the same effect.

To insert the variable or expression, you must use a , which you create using a pair of curly braces.</p><h3>Interpolating Variables Into F-Strings</h3><p>The variable that you insert in a replacement field is evaluated and converted to its <a href=\"https://realpython.com/python-repr-vs-str/\">string representation</a>.

Youâll use the <a href=\"https://realpython.com/python-gui-tkinter/\">Tkinter</a> tool kit from the Python <a href=\"https://docs.python.org/3/library/index.html\">standard library</a> to create the gameâs GUI. In the following demo video, youâll get a sense of how your game will work once youâve completed this tutorial:</p><p>Your tic-tac-toe game will have an interface that reproduces the classic three-by-three game board. The players will take turns making their moves on a shared device. The game display at the top of the window will show the name of the player who gets to go next.</p><p>If a player wins, then the game display will show a winning message with the playerâs name or mark ( or ). At the same time, the winning combination of cells will be highlighted on the board.</p><p>Finally, the gameâs  menu will have options to reset the game if you want to play again or to exit the game when youâre done playing.</p><p>If this sounds like a fun project to you, then read on to get started!</p><p>Your goal with this project is to create a tic-tac-toe game in Python. For the game interface, youâll use the Tkinter GUI tool kit, which comes in the standard Python installation as an <a href=\"https://peps.python.org/pep-0206/#batteries-included-philosophy\">included battery</a>. </p><p>The tic-tac-toe game is for two players. One player plays  and the other plays . The players take turns placing their marks on a grid of three-by-three cells. If a given player gets three marks in a row horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, then that player wins the game. The game will be tied if no one gets three in a row by the time all the cells are marked.</p><p>With these rules in mind, youâll need to put together the following game components:</p><ul><li>The gameâs , which youâll build with a class called </li><li>The gameâs , which youâll manage using a class called </li></ul><p>The game board will work as a mix between  and  in a model-view-controller design. To build the board, youâll use a Tkinter window, which you can create by instantiating the <a href=\"https://realpython.com/python-gui-tkinter/#building-your-first-python-gui-application-with-tkinter\"></a> class. This window will have two main components:</p><ol><li> Shows information about the gameâs status</li><li> Represents previous moves and available spaces or cells</li></ol><p>Youâll create the game display using a <a href=\"https://realpython.com/python-gui-tkinter/#displaying-text-and-images-with-label-widgets\"></a> widget, which allows you to display text and images.</p><p>For the grid of cells, youâll use a series of <a href=\"https://realpython.com/python-gui-tkinter/#displaying-clickable-buttons-with-button-widgets\"></a> widgets arranged in a <a href=\"https://realpython.com/python-gui-tkinter/#the-grid-geometry-manager\">grid</a>. When a player clicks one of these buttons, the game logic will run to process the playerâs move and determine whether thereâs a winner. In this case, the game logic will work as the , which will manage the data, logic, and rules of your game.</p><p>Now that you have a general idea of how to build your tic-tac-toe game, you should check out a few knowledge prerequisites thatâll allow you to get the most out of this tutorial.</p><p>To complete this tic-tac-toe game project, you should be comfortable or at least familiar with the concepts and topics covered in the following resources:</p>","contentLength":3946,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"The Real Python Podcast â Episode #237: Testing Your Python Code Base: Unit vs. Integration","url":"https://realpython.com/podcasts/rpp/237/","date":1738324800,"author":"Real Python","guid":100,"unread":true,"content":"<p>What goes into creating automated tests for your Python code?
