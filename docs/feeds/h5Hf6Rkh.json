That's essentially what a neural network does during forward propagation. It takes input data (the clues), processes it layer by layer (analyzes the evidence), and ultimately arrives at an output (solving the case). This process, called forward propagation, is the fundamental engine driving the power of neural networks, the cornerstone of modern machine learning. This article will demystify this crucial process, making it accessible to both beginners and those seeking a deeper understanding.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  What is Forward Propagation?\n</h3><p>Forward propagation is the process by which a neural network transforms input data into an output prediction. It's a series of calculations, flowing forward through the network's layers, each layer transforming the data slightly until a final prediction emerges. Think of it as a pipeline where data enters, undergoes a series of transformations, and finally exits as a refined prediction.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  The Architecture: Layers and Connections\n</h3><p>A neural network consists of interconnected layers:</p><ol><li> Receives the initial data.  For example, if classifying images, this layer might represent the pixel values.</li><li>  These layers perform the bulk of the processing, transforming the data through complex mathematical operations.  A network can have multiple hidden layers, increasing its complexity and learning capacity.</li><li> Produces the final prediction.  This could be a classification (cat or dog), a regression value (house price), or any other desired output.</li></ol><p>Each layer is composed of interconnected , which perform weighted sums of their inputs and apply an activation function to introduce non-linearity. These connections have associated  and , which are the parameters the network learns during training.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  The Mathematics:  A Step-by-Step Walkthrough\n</h3><p>Let's simplify the math. Consider a single neuron receiving inputs $x_1, x_2, ..., x_n$ with corresponding weights $w_1, w_2, ..., w_n$ and a bias $b$. The neuron's output, $z$, is calculated as:</p><p>$z = w_1x_1 + w_2x_2 + ... + w_nx_n + b = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} w_ix_i + b$</p><p>This is a weighted sum of inputs plus a bias. The bias acts as an offset, allowing the neuron to activate even when inputs are small.</p><p>Next, an , denoted as œÉ(z), is applied to introduce non-linearity. Common activation functions include sigmoid, ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit), and tanh. For example, the ReLU function is defined as:</p><p>This means the output is either 0 or the input itself, depending on whether the input is negative or positive. This simple non-linearity is crucial for the network's ability to learn complex patterns.</p><p>The output of one layer becomes the input for the next, and this process repeats until the output layer is reached. Let's illustrate with Python pseudo-code:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Forward propagation is the backbone of countless applications:</p><ul><li>  Classifying images of cats, dogs, or other objects.</li><li><strong>Natural Language Processing:</strong>  Understanding and generating human language, powering chatbots and machine translation.</li><li>  Object detection and path planning.</li><li>  Analyzing medical images to detect diseases.</li></ul><h3>\n  \n  \n  Challenges and Limitations\n</h3><ul><li>  Training deep neural networks can be computationally expensive, requiring powerful hardware (GPUs).</li><li>  The network might learn the training data too well and perform poorly on unseen data.</li><li> Understanding why a network makes a specific prediction can be challenging, raising ethical concerns in sensitive applications.</li></ul><h3>\n  \n  \n  The Future of Forward Propagation\n</h3><p>Forward propagation remains central to neural network research. Ongoing research focuses on:</p><ul><li><strong>More efficient algorithms:</strong>  Reducing computational costs and improving training speed.</li><li>  Designing networks that are more robust, accurate, and interpretable.</li><li><strong>New activation functions:</strong>  Exploring activation functions that enhance learning and generalization.</li></ul><p>In conclusion, forward propagation is the engine driving the power of neural networks. Understanding its mechanics‚Äîthe flow of data, the mathematical transformations, and the role of activation functions‚Äîis crucial for anyone seeking to master the art of machine learning. As research continues, forward propagation will undoubtedly play an even more critical role in shaping the future of artificial intelligence.</p>","contentLength":4290,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Local LLMs, No API Keys, No BS: Build Your Own Waifubot Terminal Chat in Python","url":"https://dev.to/owly/local-llms-no-api-keys-no-bs-build-your-own-waifubot-terminal-chat-in-python-470c","date":1755905765,"author":"owly","guid":237134,"unread":true,"content":"<h2>\n  \n  \n  Build a Local Waifubot Terminal Chat in Python ‚Äî No API Keys, No Cloud, No Bullshit\n</h2><p>Tired of cloud dependencies, subscriptions, and rate limits?

When developing a Django-based web application like ours, using Docker ensures consistency across development and deployed environments. By leveraging Docker Compose, we can efficiently manage multiple services required by our application.</p><p>Docker Compose is a tool that allows you to define and manage multi-container Docker applications using a simple YAML file (docker-compose.yaml). It enables developers to run interconnected services, such as a web application, database, and message broker, with a single command. The  Docker Compose basic concepts include:</p><p><strong><em>Key Docker Compose Configuration Options</em></strong></p><ul><li><p> Defines the Compose file format version. In our case, we use \"3.9\", which is one of the latest stable versions.</p></li><li><p> Lists all the containers that make up the application. Each service runs in its own container.</p></li></ul><p><strong><em>Service Configuration Keys</em></strong></p><ul><li><p> Specifies the Docker image to use for the container. If the image is not found locally, Docker will pull it from a registry like Docker Hub.</p></li><li><p> Defines how to build the image from a Dockerfile. It usually includes:</p><ul><li>context: The directory containing the Dockerfile.</li><li>dockerfile: The path to the specific Dockerfile used to build the image.</li></ul></li><li><p> Gives a custom name to the container instead of a randomly generated one.</p></li><li><p> Overrides the default command specified in the Dockerfile, allowing you to run specific commands when the container starts.</p></li><li><p> Loads environment variables from an external .env file.</p></li><li><p> Maps ports between the container and the host.</p></li><li><p> Specifies service dependencies. A container will not start until its dependencies are up and running.</p></li></ul><p>Volumes store persistent data outside the container filesystem, ensuring data is not lost when containers are restarted or removed.</p><p>Let's review the components in our system, each of these will be a service in our docker-compose.yaml file.</p><ul><li>Django (Web Application) ‚Äì The core application running on Gunicorn or the Django development server</li><li>PostgreSQL (Database) ‚Äì Stores application data</li><li>Redis (Message Broker) ‚Äì Used by Celery for task queuing</li><li>Celery Worker ‚Äì Executes asynchronous tasks</li><li>Celery Beat ‚Äì Handles scheduled tasks</li><li>Celery Flower ‚Äì Provides a web UI for monitoring Celery tasks</li></ul><h2><strong>Our docker-compose.yaml file</strong></h2><div><pre><code>version: '3.9'\n\nservices:\n  django:\n    image: spokanetech-django:latest\n    container_name: django\n    env_file:\n      - .env.compose\n    build:\n      context: ../..\n      dockerfile: src/docker/Dockerfile\n    command: ./entrypoint.sh\n    ports:\n      - \"8080:8000\"\n    depends_on:\n      - db\n      - redis\n\n  db:\n    image: postgres:17\n    container_name: postgres_db\n    volumes:\n      - postgres_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data\n    ports:\n      - \"5432:5432\"\n    env_file:\n      - .env.compose\n\n  redis:\n    image: redis:7.2-alpine\n    container_name: redis\n    restart: unless-stopped\n    ports:\n      - \"6379:6379\"\n\n  worker:\n    image: spokanetech-django:latest\n    container_name: worker\n    env_file:\n      - .env.compose\n    build:\n      context: ../..\n      dockerfile: src/docker/Dockerfile\n    command: celery -A core worker -l info\n    depends_on:\n      - redis\n      - db\n\n  beat:\n    image: spokanetech-django:latest\n    container_name: beat\n    env_file:\n      - .env.compose\n    build:\n      context: ../..\n      dockerfile: src/docker/Dockerfile\n    command: celery -A core beat -l info --scheduler django_celery_beat.schedulers:DatabaseScheduler\n    depends_on:\n      - redis\n      - db\n\n  flower:\n    image: spokanetech-django:latest\n    container_name: flower\n    env_file:\n      - .env.compose\n    command: [\"celery\", \"-A\", \"core\", \"--config=flowerconfig.py\", \"flower\"]\n    ports:\n      - \"5555:5555\"\n    depends_on:\n      - redis\n      - db\n\nvolumes:\n  postgres_data:\n  static_volume:\n</code></pre></div><p>Docker Compose provides several commands to manage services.

The LabEx 'Data Science' path is designed precisely for this, offering a structured roadmap through hands-on, interactive lessons. Forget passive video lectures; here, you learn by doing, mastering essential concepts from statistical analysis to machine learning and data visualization. Let's explore a few beginner-friendly experiments that will kickstart your transformation from novice to data wizard.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Automatic Registration of Subclasses\n</h2><p> Beginner |  5 minutes</p><p>In this challenge, we will implement a class called Base that will automatically record any subclasses that inherit from it. The purpose of this implementation is to enable the retrieval of all subclass names by iterating over Base. The goal is to demonstrate the functionality of Base by showing that it correctly registers and outputs the names of the subclasses. We will accomplish this by implementing the  method in the Base class and ensuring that it supports iteration.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Implementing Column Permutation Encryption in Python\n</h2><p> Beginner |  5 minutes</p><p>In this challenge, we will be implementing the Column Permutation Encryption method. This method involves encrypting a plaintext by writing it down line by line with a fixed number of characters per line, and then rearranging the columns of the resulting matrix according to the alphabetical order of a key. The rearranged columns are then read out one by one to obtain the ciphertext. The objective of the challenge is to complete the column_permutation_encryption(text) function in the given file, which takes a piece of text as input, performs column permutation encryption using the key qiao and the padding character ,, and returns the ciphertext. If the input text is empty, None should be returned.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Implementing Affine Encryption in Python\n</h2><p> Beginner |  5 minutes</p><p>In this challenge, we will implement the Affine encryption algorithm. The Affine cipher is a substitution cipher that combines the characteristics of the shift cipher and the multiplier cipher. It uses a cryptographic function to encrypt one letter per letter based on a mathematical formula. The objective is to complete the implementation of the affine_encryption(text) function in the affine.py file, which takes a piece of text as input, encrypts it using the Affine cipher, and returns the ciphertext.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Count Each Type Characters\n</h2><p> Beginner |  5 minutes</p><p>In this challenge, we will count the number of letters, spaces, digits, and other characters in a given input. The objective is to correctly categorize and count each type of character. For example, given the input 'abc123EFG *&amp;45?', the expected output would be 'letter=6,space=1,digit=5,other=3'.</p><p>These beginner-friendly challenges are just the beginning of your data science adventure. Each one is designed to build foundational skills, from understanding object-oriented principles to mastering data manipulation and even delving into the fascinating world of cryptography.

Note that this process may take several minutes depending on your internet connection speed, as these are substantial model files:</p><div><pre><code>ollama pull mxbai-embed-large\nollama pull llama3:8b\n</code></pre></div><h3>\n  \n  \n  Something to keep in mind ...\n</h3><p>While tools like Ollama make it straightforward to run local LLMs, hardware requirements depend on the specific model and your performance expectations. Lightweight models (such as Llama 2 7B or Phi-2) can run on modern CPUs with as little as 8 GB RAM, though performance may be limited. Larger models (like Llama 3 70B or Mixtral) typically require a dedicated GPU with at least 16 GB VRAM for efficient inference. </p><p>Ollama supports both CPU and GPU execution. On CPU-only systems, you can expect slower response times, especially with larger models or concurrent requests. Using a compatible GPU significantly accelerates inference required for demanding workloads.</p><p>Since you're working with local models, you'll likely want to use the Azure Cosmos DB emulator for local development. The emulator provides a local environment that mimics the Azure Cosmos DB service, enabling you to develop and test your applications without incurring costs or requiring an internet connection.</p><p>The emulator is available as a Docker container, which is the recommended way to run it. Here are the steps to pull and start the Cosmos DB emulator. The commands shown are for Linux - <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/how-to-develop-emulator?tabs=docker-linux%2Ccsharp&amp;pivots=api-nosql#start-the-emulator\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">refer to the documentation</a> for other platform options.</p><div><pre><code>docker pull mcr.microsoft.com/cosmosdb/linux/azure-cosmos-emulator:latest\n\ndocker run  8081:8081 1 mcr.microsoft.com/cosmosdb/linux/azure-cosmos-emulator:latest\n</code></pre></div><div><pre><code>curl  https://localhost:8081/_explorer/emulator.pem  ~/emulatorcert.crt\nupdate-ca-certificates\n</code></pre></div><p>You should see output similar to this:</p><div><pre><code>Updating certificates in /etc/ssl/certs...\nrehash: warning: skipping ca-certificates.crt,it does not contain exactly one certificate or CRL\n1 added, 0 removed; done.\nRunning hooks in /etc/ca-certificates/update.d...\ndone.\n</code></pre></div><h2>\n  \n  \n  Load data into Azure Cosmos DB\n</h2><p>Now that both Ollama and Azure Cosmos DB are set up, it's time to populate our vector database with some sample data. For this demonstration, we'll use Azure Cosmos DB's own documentation as our data source. The loader will fetch markdown content directly from the Microsoft Docs repository, specifically focusing on articles about Azure Cosmos DB <a href=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MicrosoftDocs/azure-databases-docs/refs/heads/main/articles/cosmos-db/nosql/vector-search.md\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">vector search</a> functionality.</p><p>Our data loading process will read these documentation articles, generate embeddings using the  model, and store both the content and vector representations in Azure Cosmos DB for retrieval.</p><p>Begin by cloning the GitHub repository containing the sample application:</p><div><pre><code>git clone https://github.com/abhirockzz/local-llms-rag-cosmosdb\nlocal-llms-rag-cosmosdb\n</code></pre></div><p>Before running the loader application, ensure you have Python 3 installed on your system. Create a virtual environment and install the required dependencies:</p><div><pre><code>python3  venv .venv\n .venv/bin/activate\n\npip3  requirements.txt\n</code></pre></div><p>Next, configure the environment variables and execute the loading script. The example below uses the Azure Cosmos DB emulator for local development. If you prefer to use the cloud service instead, simply set the  variable to your Azure Cosmos DB account URL and remove the  variable.</p><div><pre><code>\n\npython3 load_data.py\n</code></pre></div><p>The script will automatically create the database and container if they don't already exist. Once the data loading process completes successfully, you should see output similar to this:</p><div><pre><code>Uploading documents to Azure Cosmos DB ['https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MicrosoftDocs/azure-databases-docs/refs/heads/main/articles/cosmos-db/nosql/vector-search.md', 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MicrosoftDocs/azure-databases-docs/refs/heads/main/articles/cosmos-db/nosql/multi-tenancy-vector-search.md']\nUsing database: rag_local_llm_db, container: docs\nUsing embedding model: mxbai-embed-large with dimensions: 1024\nCreated instance of AzureCosmosDBNoSqlVectorSearch\nLoading 26 document chunks from 2 documents\nData loaded into Azure Cosmos DB\n</code></pre></div><p>To confirm that your data has been loaded successfully, you can inspect the results using the Azure Cosmos DB Data Explorer. If you're using the emulator, navigate to <code>https://localhost:8081/_explorer/index.html</code> in your browser. You should see the same number of documents in your container as the number of chunks reported by the loader application.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Run vector search queries\n</h2><p>Now that your data is loaded, let's test the vector search functionality. Set the same environment variables used for data loading and run the vector search script with your desired query:</p><div><pre><code>\n\npython3 vector_search.py </code></pre></div><p>The script will process your query through the embedding model and perform a similarity search against the stored document vectors. You should see output similar to the following:</p><div><pre><code>Searching top 5 results for query: \"show me an example of a vector embedding policy\"\n\nUsing database: rag_local_llm_db, container: docs\nUsing embedding model: mxbai-embed-large with dimensions: 1024\nCreated instance of AzureCosmosDBNoSqlVectorSearch\nScore: 0.7437641827298191\nContent: ```\n\n\n\n### A policy with two vector paths\n//....\n\n\n</code></pre></div><p>The output shows the top five results ordered by their similarity scores, with higher scores indicating better matches to your query.</p><blockquote><p>To modify the number of results returned, you can add the  argument. For example, to retrieve the top 10 results, run: <code>python3 vector_search.py \"show me an example of a vector embedding policy\" 10</code></p></blockquote><h2>\n  \n  \n  Execute Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) queries\n</h2><p>Now we will put it all together with an simple chat based interface that leverages the  model to generate responses based on the contextual information retrieved from Azure Cosmos DB.</p><p>Configure the environment variables needed for the RAG application and launch the script:</p><div><pre><code>\nbash\n# export COSMOS_DB_URL=\"https://&lt;Cosmos DB account name&gt;.documents.azure.com:443/\"\nexport USE_EMULATOR=\"true\"\nexport DATABASE_NAME=\"rag_local_llm_db\"\nexport CONTAINER_NAME=\"docs\"\nexport EMBEDDINGS_MODEL=\"mxbai-embed-large\"\nexport DIMENSIONS=\"1024\"\nexport CHAT_MODEL=\"llama3\"\n\npython3 rag_chain.py\n\n\n</code></pre></div><p>Once the application initializes, you'll see output confirming the RAG chain setup:</p><div><pre><code>\ntext\nBuilding RAG chain. Using model: llama3\nUsing database: rag_local_llm_db, container: docs\nUsing embedding model: mxbai-embed-large with dimensions: 1024\nCreated instance of AzureCosmosDBNoSqlVectorSearch\nEnter your questions below. Type 'exit' to quit, 'clear' to clear chat history, 'history' to view chat history.\n[User]:\n\n\n</code></pre></div><p>Ask questions about the Azure Cosmos DB vector search documentation that you've loaded. For instance, try asking <code>show me an example of a vector embedding policy</code>, and you'll see a response like this (note that these may vary slightly for your case, even across different runs):</p><div><pre><code>\ntext\n//...\n[User]: show me an example of a vector embedding policy\n[Assistant]: Here is an example of a vector embedding policy:\n\n{\n    \"vectorEmbeddings\": [\n        {\n            \"path\":\"/vector1\",\n            \"dataType\":\"float32\",\n            \"distanceFunction\":\"cosine\",\n            \"dimensions\":1536\n        },\n        {\n            \"path\":\"/vector2\",\n            \"dataType\":\"int8\",\n            \"distanceFunction\":\"dotproduct\",\n            \"dimensions\":100\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nThis policy defines two vector embeddings: one with the path `/vector1`, using `float32` data type, cosine distance function, and having 1536 dimensions; and another with the path `/vector2`, using `int8` data type, dot product distance function, and having 100 dimensions.\n\n\n</code></pre></div><p>To further explore the capabilities of your RAG system, try these additional example queries:</p><ul><li>\"What is the maximum supported dimension for vector embeddings in Azure Cosmos DB?\"</li><li>\"Is it suitable for large scale data?\"</li><li>\"Is there a benefit to using the flat index type?\"</li></ul><blockquote><p>You can enter 'exit' to quit the application, 'clear' to clear chat history, or 'history' to view your previous interactions. Feel free to experiment with different data sources and queries. To modify the number of vector search results used as context, you can add the  environment variable (defaults to 5).</p></blockquote><p>In this walkthrough, you followed step-by-step instructions to set up a complete RAG application that runs entirely on your local infrastructure ‚Äî from installing and configuring Ollama with embedding and chat models, to setting up Azure Cosmos DB for vector storage, loading documentation data, and running using RAG through an interactive chat interface.</p><p>Running models locally brings clear advantages in terms of costs, data privacy, and     connectivity constraints. However, you need to plan for appropriate hardware, particularly for larger models that perform best with dedicated GPUs and sufficient memory. The trade-off between model size, performance, and resource requirements is crucial when planning your local AI setup.</p><p>Have you experimented with local LLMs in your projects?

In 2025, finding the right <a href=\"https://www.onboardnow.ai/hire/python/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Python developer for hire</a> is more critical than ever. </p><p>The challenge is that not every candidate with ‚ÄúPython experience‚Äù can build, scale, and maintain production-ready applications. A well-structured interview process is key to identifying developers who can write clean code and solve real problems effectively. </p><p>This guide brings together 15 essential interview questions for Python developers. These questions cover fundamentals, coding skills, and problem-solving approaches, helping recruiters, hiring managers, and even developers preparing for interviews navigate the process with confidence. </p><h2>\n  \n  \n  1. What are Python‚Äôs key features?\n</h2><p>This is a classic opener that helps you gauge how well a candidate understands Python‚Äôs fundamentals. A good developer should mention things like: </p><ul><li>Python is interpreted and dynamically typed.\n</li><li>It emphasizes readability and simplicity (thanks to indentation). </li><li>It supports multiple programming paradigms (object-oriented, functional, procedural). </li><li>It has a huge ecosystem of libraries and frameworks.</li></ul><p>Strong candidates usually go beyond buzzwords and give examples. For instance, they might mention how Python‚Äôs extensive community support makes troubleshooting easier, or how dynamic typing speeds up prototyping. </p><h2>\n  \n  \n  2. Explain Python‚Äôs memory management.\n</h2><p>This question checks whether the developer understands what‚Äôs happening under the hood. Python manages memory using: </p><ul><li>Reference counting and garbage collection for unused objects. </li><li>Memory pools (like PyMalloc) to optimize allocation. </li><li>Developers can use modules like gc to interact with the garbage collector. </li></ul><h2>\n  \n  \n  3. What are Python‚Äôs built-in data types and data structures?\n</h2><p>Expect candidates to cover: </p><ul><li>Basic data types: int, float, str, bool. </li><li>Collection types: list, tuple, set, dict. </li><li>Advanced: frozenset, deque from collections, or even dataclasses. </li></ul><p>An excellent candidate won‚Äôt just list them but will explain use cases. For instance, why you‚Äôd use a tuple instead of a list (immutability, hashability), or when a dictionary is more efficient than nested lists. </p><h2>\n  \n  \n  4. Explain inheritance and polymorphism in Python.\n</h2><p>Since Python is object-oriented, this is a must-ask. Candidates should explain: </p><p> allows a class to derive attributes and methods from another. </p><p> allows different classes to define methods with the same name but potentially different behavior. </p><h2>\n  \n  \n  5. What are decorators, and how are they used?\n</h2><p>Decorators are a hot topic in Python interviews because they test both technical depth and practical coding skills. Candidates should say: </p><p>Decorators are functions that wrap other functions to modify their behavior without changing their code. </p><p>They‚Äôre widely used in frameworks like Flask (<a href=\"//mailto:@app.route\">@app.route</a>) or Django (@login_required). </p><p>def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):  </p><p>print(f\"Calling {func.name}\")  </p><p>return func(*args, **kwargs)  </p><p>This shows how decorators add functionality in a clean, reusable way. </p><h2>\n  \n  \n  6. What‚Äôs the difference between @staticmethod, @classmethod, and instance methods?\n</h2><p>This question checks if candidates can distinguish between method types: </p><ul><li> Regular methods, take self, operate on an instance. </li><li> Use @classmethod, take cls, often used for alternative constructors. </li><li> Use @staticmethod, don‚Äôt need self or cls, utility functions inside a class.</li></ul><p>An advanced developer may explain when to use them. For example, using a classmethod to create objects from different input formats (like from_json). </p><h2>\n  \n  \n  7. Explain Python‚Äôs Global Interpreter Lock (GIL).\n</h2><p>If you‚Äôre hiring for performance-heavy roles, this is essential. A good candidate should explain:</p><ul><li>The GIL ensures only one thread executes Python bytecode at a time, even on multi-core systems.</li><li>This can limit CPU-bound multi-threaded programs.</li><li>Workarounds include multiprocessing, async programming, or using libraries like NumPy that release the GIL internally.</li></ul><p>This answer shows if they understand Python‚Äôs concurrency limitations and know alternatives.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  8. How do you manage virtual environments and dependencies in Python projects?\n</h2><p>This is a practical skill every Python dev needs. Answers may include:</p><ul><li>Tools like venv, virtualenv, or conda.</li><li>Using pip freeze &gt; requirements.txt to track dependencies.</li><li>For larger projects, using pipenv or poetry for environment and dependency management.</li></ul><p>Candidates should also stress why isolation matters‚Äîavoiding version conflicts.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  9. How do you handle database interactions in Python?\n</h2><ul><li>Using ORMs (Django ORM, SQLAlchemy).</li><li>Direct queries with libraries like sqlite3 or psycopg2.</li><li>Handling transactions, migrations, and performance tuning.</li></ul><p>The best candidates may add how they use connection pooling or database indexing for performance.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  10. What‚Äôs your approach to testing and debugging Python code?\n</h2><p>Testing is critical for long-term maintainability. Candidates should mention:</p><ul><li>Using built-in unittest or frameworks like pytest.</li><li>Writing modular, testable code.</li><li>Mocking external dependencies.</li></ul><p>class TestMath(unittest.TestCase):\n    def test_addition(self):<p>\n        self.assertEqual(2 + 2, 4)`</p></p><ul><li>Understands the fundamentals (data types, OOP, decorators).</li><li>Can solve real-world problems (web frameworks, database handling, testing).</li><li>Thinks about scalability and maintainability (generators, profiling, debugging).</li></ul><p>By asking these 15 must-ask interview questions, you‚Äôll not only filter out unprepared candidates but also identify developers who bring real value to your projects.</p><p>And if you‚Äôre a developer preparing for interviews, treat these as your study checklist. Mastering these concepts will help you walk into any interview with confidence.</p>","contentLength":5824,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Stop losing your breakpoints: Meet Breakpoint Bookmarks for VS Code","url":"https://dev.to/omardulaimi/stop-losing-your-breakpoints-meet-breakpoint-bookmarks-for-vs-code-3c4b","date":1755861625,"author":"Omar Dulaimi","guid":236870,"unread":true,"content":"<p>If you've ever stopped mid‚Äëdebug to chase a different bug, you know the pain: you come back and all your carefully placed breakpoints are gone.

It powers applications across domains:</p><p>Web Development: Frameworks like Django and Flask fuel startups and large-scale platforms alike.</p><p>Data Science &amp; AI: Libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, TensorFlow, and PyTorch make Python the backbone of artificial intelligence and machine learning.</p><p>Automation: From simple scripts to enterprise workflows, Python has become the default choice for automation.</p><p>Cybersecurity: Security experts rely on Python for penetration testing and tool development.</p><p>Game Development &amp; IoT: Its reach extends even into creative and hardware-focused industries.</p><p>Few languages can boast this level of adaptability.</p><p>Community Power and Ecosystem</p><p>Another key factor behind Python‚Äôs staying power is its global community. With millions of developers contributing to open-source projects, maintaining libraries, and offering tutorials, Python has one of the richest ecosystems in tech. This means developers rarely face problems alone‚Äîthere‚Äôs almost always a Python library, guide, or forum thread that has the solution.</p><p>The Language of Data and AI</p><p>In an age where data is king, Python reigns supreme. Nearly every breakthrough in machine learning, deep learning, or generative AI has Python somewhere in its foundation. Its seamless integration with big data tools and AI frameworks ensures that Python will remain at the heart of the tech revolution for years to come.</p><p>Even with competition from languages like JavaScript, Rust, and Go, Python continues to hold its crown because it strikes the right balance between power and accessibility. It isn‚Äôt the fastest language in terms of raw execution, but its development speed, vast ecosystem, and flexibility consistently outweigh performance drawbacks.</p><p>As industries push deeper into AI, data analytics, and automation, Python‚Äôs role only grows stronger. Its adaptability ensures that it evolves with new technologies rather than becoming outdated. Whether you‚Äôre building a machine learning model, automating a workflow, or creating the next big web platform, Python will likely be there at the core.</p><p>‚ú® In short, Python‚Äôs supremacy isn‚Äôt just about popularity‚Äîit‚Äôs about reliability, versatility, and community-driven innovation. It‚Äôs not just a programming language; it‚Äôs the universal language of modern technology.</p>","contentLength":3263,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"SassGuard: The Ultimate Discord Bot for Blocking NSFW & Gore Content (2025)","url":"https://dev.to/geeker_smart_d1251357555f/sassguard-the-ultimate-discord-bot-for-blocking-nsfw-gore-content-2025-1nbc","date":1755854170,"author":"Geeker Smart","guid":236826,"unread":true,"content":"<p><a href=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2F4bmh9ktlshhzdv9b4qo8.png\"><img src=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2F4bmh9ktlshhzdv9b4qo8.png\" alt=\" \" width=\"800\" height=\"318\"></a>Running a safe Discord community is harder than ever.

I had a sleek WebUI, metadata management, and a FastAPI backend. Everything looked promising on paper. Then I stumbled across a Reddit post that changed everything.</p><p>A frustrated developer was complaining about Great Expectations: \"Too complex, too many dependencies. I don't want a 'data quality platform'‚ÄîI want a 'data validation function'.\"</p><p>That hit me like a cold shower. Here I was, building exactly what this person  want.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Why Build a Data Validation Tool?\n</h3><p>As a seasoned data architect who'd led Java-based data quality tools before, I thought I understood the problem.  seemed straightforward enough. With AI pair programming on the rise, why not leverage my domain knowledge and let AI handle the coding gaps?</p><p>My initial vision was ambitious: a WebUI-based tool with metadata configuration, connection management, rule execution, and result visualization. I chose Streamlit for the frontend and FastAPI for the backend, aiming for something lightweight yet comprehensive.</p><p>But \"lightweight\" quickly became anything but.</p><p>After two months of development, I realized I'd made four critical mistakes:</p><ol><li><p> - I had a PRD but no detailed functional specs. AI filled the gaps by expanding features I never asked for.</p></li><li><p> - Especially around API interfaces, leading to two painful refactors mid-development.</p></li><li><p><strong>Overestimating AI capabilities</strong> - I lacked experience in driving AI for app development, despite my software engineering background.</p></li><li><p><strong>Perfectionism killing the MVP</strong> - I added complex features like multi-rule execution for single tables and obsessed over test coverage.</p></li></ol><p>The  was real. I'd drifted far from my  goals.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  The Four Questions That Changed Everything\n</h3><p>That Reddit post forced me to ask myself some uncomfortable questions:</p><ul><li>Does my product really need to maintain a metadata layer?</li><li>Is my core engine small and beautiful enough to support different deployment scenarios?</li><li>Is WebUI actually necessary for my target users?</li><li>What's the most valuable part of my product, and is it truly at the center?</li></ul><p>Once I asked the right questions, the answers became painfully obvious. My ‚Äîdata engineers and analysts‚Äîdidn't want another platform. They wanted a tool that could validate data with a single command, SQL query, or script.</p><p>I made a tough decision: scrap the half-built WebUI version and extract the rule engine as a standalone CLI tool.</p><p>But there was a problem. The rule engine was tightly coupled with other modules, especially through ORM models designed for metadata persistence. This violated basic  I knew by heart but had somehow ignored in practice.</p><blockquote><p>\"Technical debt must be paid. I couldn't justify keeping legacy code just to maintain backward compatibility.\"</p></blockquote><p>I redesigned the interface using a clean schema model in a shared module, refactored twice to internalize configuration management and error handling, and finally achieved a truly independent core module.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Building an App with Python: Lessons Learned\n</h2><p>Working on this  project taught me that domain expertise doesn't automatically translate to implementation wisdom. When I lacked confidence in Python project structure, I defaulted to AI suggestions‚Äînot always the best approach.</p><p>The refactoring process was painful but necessary. I couldn't  by pushing it to future versions. Clean architecture isn't just academic theory; it's survival for any product that plans to evolve.</p><p>Now I have a completed CLI module with comprehensive tests, and the first version has been released on GitHub and PyPI.

We use a three-layer approach:</p><p>The heart of any effective data validation tool is its rule engine. It's designed around high cohesion and loose coupling principles - fancy words for \"it works well and doesn't break easily.\"</p><ul><li>: Multiple rules on the same table? We merge them into a single query, cutting database calls by 80%</li><li>: New data sources or rule types? Just implement the interface</li><li>: Adding new validation rules takes 3 steps: inherit, implement, register</li></ul><p>Common utilities like database connections, schema definitions, and shared classes live here. Think of it as the foundation that everything else builds on.</p><p>The initial release is CLI-first, but the architecture supports future expansion to web UIs, cloud deployment tools, and even SaaS offerings.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  How to validate data with ValidateLite\n</h2><div><pre><code>pip validatelite\nvlite check examples/orders.csv  report.json\nreport.json\n</code></pre></div><h3>\n  \n  \n  Docker (build from source)\n</h3><div><pre><code>docker build  validatelite:latest \ndocker run /examples:/data validatelite:latest \n  vlite check /data/orders.csv  /data/rules.json\n</code></pre></div><p>Here's the magic happening under the hood:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>A modern data validation tool needs to handle various data sources through a unified interface:</p><ul><li>: MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite</li><li>: CSV and Excel (converted to SQLite for SQL execution)</li><li>: Cloud storage, APIs, streaming data</li></ul><h3>\n  \n  \n  What It Validates (MVP Scope)\n</h3><ul><li>: Because empty fields break everything</li><li>: Duplicate detection made simple\n</li><li>: Numbers and dates within bounds</li><li>: Categorical data stays in line</li><li>: No more \"2023-13-45\" surprises</li></ul><p>The schema design includes hooks for future enhancements:</p><ul><li>Cross-database validation</li></ul><h2>\n  \n  \n  Development Approach: Vibe Coding\n</h2><p>I'm using what I call \"vibe coding\" - documentation-driven development with AI assistance.

Version 1 focuses on single-table rules, but the architecture supports:</p><ul><li>Multi-table relationships</li><li>Cross-database validation</li><li>Web UI and cloud deployment</li></ul><p>The goal isn't to replace your entire data infrastructure - it's to make data quality checking so easy that you actually do it.</p><p><strong>Data validation shouldn't require a dedicated team and six months of setup.</strong> It should be as simple as running a command and getting actionable results.</p><p>That's what I'm building. A tool that respects your time, works with your existing stack, and scales when you need it to.</p><p>Poor data quality isn't just a technical problem - it's a trust problem. When analysts can't trust their data, when engineers spend more time validating than building, when compliance teams find gaps during audits, we're not just losing time.

Sounds like science fiction? Not anymore. This is the power of neural networks, a cornerstone of modern machine learning. This article will demystify the fundamental building blocks of neural networks: perceptrons and activation functions, providing a clear path for both beginners and those looking to solidify their understanding.</p><p>At its heart, a neural network is a collection of interconnected nodes, inspired by the biological structure of the human brain. The simplest of these nodes is the perceptron ‚Äì a single-layer neural network. Think of it as a simplified model of a neuron, receiving input, processing it, and producing an output.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  The Math Behind the Magic\n</h3><p>A perceptron takes multiple inputs ($x_1, x_2, ..., x_n$), each weighted by a corresponding weight ($w_1, w_2, ..., w_n$). These weighted inputs are summed, and a bias ($b$) is added. This sum is then passed through an activation function to produce the output. Let's break it down:</p><ol><li>  $z = w_1x_1 + w_2x_2 + ... + w_nx_n + b$</li><li> $a = f(z)$  where 'a' is the output and 'f' is the activation function.</li></ol><p>Let's visualize this with a simple example: imagine a perceptron deciding whether to buy a stock based on two factors: price ($x_1$) and volume ($x_2$). Each factor has a weight reflecting its importance, and the bias represents a general market sentiment.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><h3>\n  \n  \n  The Role of Weights and Bias\n</h3><p>The weights determine the influence of each input on the output. A higher weight signifies a stronger influence. The bias acts as a threshold; it adjusts the activation function's output, allowing the perceptron to activate even when the weighted sum is close to zero. Learning in a perceptron involves adjusting these weights and bias to minimize errors.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Activation Functions: Introducing Non-Linearity\n</h2><p>The activation function is the crucial ingredient that introduces non-linearity into the perceptron. Without it, the perceptron would only be capable of performing linear classifications ‚Äì severely limiting its power. Several activation functions exist, each with its strengths and weaknesses.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Popular Activation Functions\n</h3><ul><li><p>  This is the simplest activation function. It outputs 1 if the weighted sum is above a threshold (usually 0) and 0 otherwise.  It's computationally efficient but lacks the nuance of other functions.</p></li><li><p> This function outputs a value between 0 and 1, making it suitable for binary classification problems. Its smooth, S-shaped curve allows for better gradient descent during training.  The formula is:  $œÉ(z) = \\frac{1}{1 + e^{-z}}$</p></li><li><p><strong>ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit):</strong>  ReLU outputs the input if it's positive and 0 otherwise. It's computationally efficient and helps mitigate the vanishing gradient problem (a common issue in deep neural networks).  $ReLU(z) = max(0, z)$</p></li></ul><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><h2>\n  \n  \n  Applications and Real-World Impact\n</h2><p>Perceptrons, though simple, form the basis of more complex neural networks. They are used in various applications, including:</p><ul><li> Spam detection, medical diagnosis (e.g., identifying cancerous cells).</li><li><strong>Simple Pattern Recognition:</strong>  Recognizing handwritten digits (though more complex networks are usually employed for better accuracy).</li><li><strong>Building Blocks for Larger Networks:</strong>  Perceptrons are the fundamental units in multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) and other sophisticated architectures.</li></ul><h2>\n  \n  \n  Challenges and Limitations\n</h2><p>While perceptrons are powerful building blocks, they have limitations:</p><ul><li>  They can only classify linearly separable data.  This means they struggle with datasets where the classes cannot be separated by a straight line (or hyperplane in higher dimensions).</li><li>  Single-layer perceptrons are not capable of solving complex problems requiring non-linear decision boundaries.</li></ul><h2>\n  \n  \n  The Future of Perceptrons and Activation Functions\n</h2><p>Despite their limitations, perceptrons and activation functions remain central to the field of neural networks. Ongoing research focuses on developing new and more efficient activation functions to address challenges like the vanishing gradient problem and improve the performance of deep learning models. The exploration of novel architectures built upon these fundamental components continues to push the boundaries of what's possible in artificial intelligence.

Its creamy, indulgent goodness is a favorite among people of all ages. However, there's nothing quite as disheartening as discovering a tub of your favorite flavor has gone bad. To prevent this from happening, it's essential to know the signs of spoiled ice cream and how to store it properly. In this guide, we'll delve into the fascinating world of ice cream freshness and provide you with the knowledge to keep your freezer frosty for as long as possible.</p><p>The first step in ensuring your ice cream remains fresh is proper storage. Keep your ice cream in the coldest part of your freezer, typically the back or bottom. The ideal temperature for ice cream is between -18¬∞C and -22¬∞C (-26¬∞F and -7¬∞F). If your freezer doesn't have a thermometer, you can place an ice pack on the outside of the container to gauge its temperature.</p><p>Now that you've got your ice cream in the right place, let's learn how to spot a spoiled scoop. The most obvious sign is a change in texture or appearance. If the ice cream has become grainy, icy, or has a grayish-brown hue, it's time to toss it. However, there are subtler signs to look out for as well.</p><p>One of the most telling indicators of spoiled ice cream is a strong, sour smell. This odor is caused by the growth of bacteria, which can produce harmful toxins. If you notice a pungent smell emanating from your ice cream, it's best to err on the side of caution and throw it away.</p><p>Another way to determine if your ice cream has gone bad is by tasting it. If it tastes sour, bitter, or has a metallic taste, it's not safe to eat. It's also important to note that ice cream that has been thawed and refrozen should be discarded, as the refreezing process can cause harmful bacteria to multiply.</p><p>In addition to these visual and taste tests, there are also tools available to help you determine the freshness of your ice cream. Ice cream thermometers can be used to check the internal temperature of your ice cream. If the temperature is above -18¬∞C (-26¬∞F), it's a sign that the ice cream has thawed and should be discarded.</p><p>To prolong the life of your ice cream, it's essential to wrap it properly. Use a freezer-safe container with a tight-fitting lid to store your ice cream. Avoid using plastic wrap, as it can trap moisture and cause the ice cream to thaw prematurely.</p><p>In conclusion, knowing how to spot a spoiled scoop of ice cream is crucial to maintaining a stockpile of fresh, creamy treats in your freezer. By storing your ice cream properly, using visual and taste tests to determine its freshness, and wrapping it appropriately, you can enjoy your favorite frozen dessert for as long as possible. So, the next time you're craving a sweet treat, take a moment to appreciate the art of ice cream freshness and indulge in the knowledge that your frozen creations are safe and delicious.</p>","contentLength":3002,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Title: The Indian Government's Ban on Real-Money Gaming: A Threat to a $23 Billion Industry","url":"https://dev.to/yagyaraj_sharma_6cd410179/title-the-indian-governments-ban-on-real-money-gaming-a-threat-to-a-23-billion-industry-4nj3","date":1755822045,"author":"Insights YRS","guid":236002,"unread":true,"content":"<h2>\n  \n  \n  Title: The Indian Government's Ban on Real-Money Gaming: A Threat to a $23 Billion Industry\n</h2><p>In recent years, the Indian gaming industry has grown exponentially, with real-money gaming (RMG) emerging as a lucrative segment. However, this growth has come to a halt as the Indian government has proposed a law that aims to ban RMG nationwide. This move has sparked controversy and raised concerns about the future of the $23 billion industry. In this blog post, we will explore the proposed law, its implications, and the potential impact on the Indian gaming industry.</p><p>The proposed law, titled the Prevention of Unlawful Online Gambling Act, 2018, aims to ban all forms of online gambling, including RMG.

Conceived in 1884 as an entrance arch to the 1889 World's Fair, this towering structure has captivated millions of visitors over the years. But what's the science behind this intriguing phenomenon?</p><p>Firstly, let's understand the design of the Eiffel Tower. It consists of three levels, with the first level being the lowest at 57 meters and the third level reaching a staggering height of 324 meters. The tower is made primarily of iron, which expands when heated. This expansion is what causes the tower to grow taller during the summer months.</p><p>Each year, as the sun beats down on the tower, the metal absorbs heat energy. This causes the iron to expand, creating a slight increase in the tower's overall height. However, this growth is so minute that it's almost imperceptible to the naked eye. In fact, if you were to measure the tower's height every day, you might not even notice the change!</p><p>But here's where things get really interesting. The expansion of the Eiffel Tower isn't uniform across its entire surface. Instead, it occurs most significantly at the points where the metal meets the concrete foundation. This is because the concrete absorbs heat more slowly than the metal, creating a gradient in temperature that causes the metal to expand more rapidly at the base.</p><p>As a result, each year, the Eiffel Tower grows slightly taller at the bottom and remains the same height at the top. Over time, this difference in growth rates has led to a noticeable increase in the tower's overall height. In fact, since its construction, the Eiffel Tower has grown a staggering 18 centimeters taller!</p><p>So, the next time you visit the Eiffel Tower, take a moment to marvel at this fascinating physics phenomenon.

When your catalog involves complex product descriptions, categorizations and multiple supporting documents, a basic retrieval or prompt-based approach just doesn‚Äôt cut it.</p><p>In the age of agentic commerce, how can we enable users to say things like ‚ÄúI have a small family of four. We live in Munich. What‚Äôs the best internet plan for us?‚Äù and have the system identify relevant products, draft an initial proposal, review and refine it based on available data, and engage in a meaningful conversation?</p><p>In this post, you‚Äôll learn how to build a practical AI agent for searching product catalogs using <a href=\"https://upsidelab.io/tools/enthusiast\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Enthusiast</a>, an AI toolkit designed for e-commerce and knowledge-intensive tasks. We will cover setting up the environment, customizing the agent, and quickly testing it on sample data.</p><p>But first, let‚Äôs look at how agentic workflows differ from traditional pipelines and why that matters.</p><h2><strong>Non-Agentic Workflow vs. Agentic Workflow</strong></h2><p>In a traditional (non-agentic) workflow, product search is driven by fixed queries or rigid filter logic. It‚Äôs simple and fast, but struggles with nuanced language or evolving user intent. The system can‚Äôt adapt on the fly. It just follows predefined instructions.\nOn the other hand, an agentic workflow introduces flexibility and adaptability. AI agents dynamically interpret user inputs, construct queries intelligently, and adjust their approach based on the context of the interaction and feedback received. This allows them to handle more complex, ambiguous requests while improving reliability and user experience.</p><h2><strong>What Makes Up an AI Agent</strong></h2><p>To build an effective AI agent for product catalog search, the following components are essential:</p><ul><li>Input Handling: Accepts and interprets user requests.</li><li>Feedback Handling and Memory: Incorporates user and system feedback to improve future interactions and maintains memory of past interactions.</li><li>Tools: Interfaces with external tools or databases to execute tasks.</li><li>Reasoning: Analyzes input and feedback to make informed decisions.</li></ul><p>To build such an agent, we need an execution environment. Let‚Äôs explore how Enthusiast can serve as an effective option.</p><p>Most LangChain tutorials stop at toy examples or require heavy customization to support real-world workflows. Enthusiast changes that. It‚Äôs built from the ground up to support:</p><ul><li>Tool-based agents with LangChain and ReAct</li><li>SQL-backed querying with Django or external sources</li><li>Structured memory and retry logic out of the box</li><li>Open-source, customizable behavior</li><li>Self-hosting with cloud/local model support</li></ul><p>Whether you're debugging search in a product catalog or surfacing relevant documents across internal departments, Enthusiast gives you a working foundation in minutes with real production logic, not just playground demos.</p><p>Alright, now let‚Äôs bring that to life. We‚Äôll walk through a real case: spinning up a local environment, loading data, and creating a self-correcting LangChain agent that actually understands and interacts with your product catalog.</p><p><strong>Setting Up the Development Environment</strong></p><p>To get started, you need to set up your development environment by cloning the Enthusiast starter repository and using its Docker configuration.</p><ol><li><p>Clone the repository:<code>git clone https://github.com/upsidelab/enthusiast-starter</code></p></li><li><p>Navigate into the repository directory:</p></li><li><p>Copy default configuration file and add your own OpenAI API key:<code>cp config/env.sample config/env</code><code>echo OPENAI_API_KEY=xxxx &gt;&gt; config/env</code></p></li><li><p>Build and run the Docker containers:</p></li></ol><p>You‚Äôll be prompted to create your first dataset. Give it a name, for example, ‚ÄúMy Dataset‚Äù. </p><p><strong>Import a Sample Product Dataset</strong>\nEnthusiast comes with a sample set of products that can be useful if you want to get started quickly. In this case, we have a set of products that represent different phone and mobile plans - with varying internet speeds, data limits, landline access, cable TV options, and more. They make a great test case for experimenting with different approaches to agentic product recommendations. </p><p>Let‚Äôs import this into our dataset:</p><ol><li>Click on ‚ÄúAdd Source‚Äù in the top-right corner of the screen.</li><li>From the dropdown, select ‚ÄúProduct source‚Äù.</li><li>A popup will appear for configuring the source.</li><li>Select ‚ÄúSample Product Source‚Äù from the list and click ‚ÄúAdd‚Äù.</li><li>You should now see it listed under configured sources.</li><li>Repeat the same process for documents by selecting ‚ÄúDocument source‚Äù from the dropdown.</li><li>This time, choose ‚ÄúSample Document Source‚Äù as the type and add it as well.</li></ol><p>Enthusiast will automatically index the dataset so it‚Äôs searchable right away.</p><p>Once the data is loaded, you can go to the Products tab to verify that the sample data was successfully imported and indexed. This ensures that your dataset is ready for querying by the agent.</p><h2><strong>Create a Custom Agent Structure</strong></h2><p>Now that your product catalog is loaded, it‚Äôs time to build an agent that can operate on it. Enthusiast supports extending and modifying agent behavior through the enthusiast_custom directory in the project.</p><ol><li><p>Inside the enthusiast-starter repository, locate the src/enthusiast_custom directory. This is the package that contains your custom agents and plugins. This code will be bundled by the Dockerfile and automatically installed into your Enthusiast instance.</p></li><li><p>Let‚Äôs also install a plugin that provides a reusable base implementation for a ReAct-style agent. Run the following command inside the src/ directory to add the plugin:<code>poetry add enthusiast-agent-re-act</code></p></li><li><p>Then, create a new directory inside enthusiast_custom, calling it for example product_search. Inside this directory, add an empty .py file to make it a Python package. This is where you‚Äôll define your agent‚Äôs implementation.</p></li><li><p>Add your new agent to the config/settings_override.py file so that Enthusiast can recognize it. Update the AVAILABLE_AGENTS dictionary to include your custom module:</p></li></ol><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><ol><li>You can now rebuild and restart your Docker Compose setup to apply these changes:\n<code>docker compose up --build</code></li></ol><p>Once the application is restarted, you‚Äôll see your new agent listed in the UI on the left. Time to give it some logic.</p><h2><strong>Step 1 ‚Äì Generate an SQL Query</strong></h2><p>We‚Äôll start with a basic implementation that generates an SQL query and executes it on the product catalog indexed in Enthusiast. The agent will reason through user queries and interact with the catalog to retrieve relevant results.</p><p>To do this, we‚Äôll use the enthusiast-agent-re-act plugin that we added earlier. It provides a BaseReActAgent class, which defines the core structure of a ReAct-style agent, including how it connects prompts, tools, memory, and output processing.</p><p>Here‚Äôs how we‚Äôll structure the product_search agent module:</p><p>Start by defining the agent class. In a basic scenario, no overrides are required - agent‚Äôs default implementation will respond to user‚Äôs queries by creating an agent executor configured with tools and memory, and will pass the user‚Äôs request there.\nHere‚Äôs what the simplest implementation looks like:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p><code>product_search/product_search_tool.py</code></p><p>Next, implement a tool the agent can use to run SQL queries against your product catalog.</p><p>Let‚Äôs first declare the expected input schema using a Pydantic model. This schema will be provided to the agent together with the tool definition, to let the agent determine what‚Äôs needed to call this tool. Since we specify that the tool requires an SQL query, the agent will try to produce one based on everything it knows so far in order to invoke it.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>This tool receives an SQL string from the agent, executes it using Django‚Äôs ORM, serializes the resulting product objects, and returns a message with the result. The NAME and DESCRIPTION fields in the tool definition help the agent determine when this tool is relevant to the current task. </p><p>Here‚Äôs a basic version of the tool implementation:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Then, create the system prompt that will guide how the agent reasons and interacts with tools. Add the following:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Finally, wire everything together in the config file. This tells Enthusiast which components make up your agent:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Once these components are in place and the Docker container is rebuilt, try executing a sample query:\nWhat‚Äôs the best plan for a small family?<p>\nThe agent will reason about the input, construct an SQL query, and invoke the search tool, likely failing due to invalid schema or search criteria. Let‚Äôs see what we can do with that.</p></p><h2><strong>Step 2 ‚Äì Let the Agent Handle Its Own Errors</strong></h2><p>In the initial version, if the SQL query generated by the agent was incorrect, the tool would simply fail without giving the agent any indication of what went wrong. We can improve this by modifying the tool to catch SQL errors and return the error message as part of the response.</p><p>This way, the agent can treat the error as feedback and make another attempt, refining the query on its own.</p><p>To do this, update the run method in ProductSearchTool as follows:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>With this change, when the SQL query fails, the agent gets the error message and can use it to revise its approach. Since the agent maintains memory of previous steps, it can iterate on its output to try and produce a valid query.</p><p>Try running the same query again:\nWhat‚Äôs the best plan for a small family?</p><p>If the first attempt fails, the agent will receive the error, analyze it, and try to generate a better query.</p><h2><strong>Step 3 ‚Äì Help the Agent Understand the Data</strong></h2><p>Letting the agent correct its own mistakes is helpful, but trial and error can be inefficient. Instead of waiting for the agent to fail and recover, we can give it a clearer understanding of the data structure up front.</p><p>One simple way to do this is by including a few sample rows from the product catalog directly in the prompt. This helps the agent understand both the schema and the shape of the data, which improves its chances of generating valid queries from the start.</p><p>To add this context, let‚Äôs override the get_answer method in your agent like this:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>This method will use functionality provided by the base class to build a LangChain-based agent executor, pass the input to it, and return the response to the user. One important change here is that besides user‚Äôs input (passed as input_text ), it will also pull a few sample products from the database and will inject them into the agent‚Äôs system prompt as sample_products.</p><p>In your prompt template (prompt.py), add this placeholder at the end:\nHere are some sample products in the database: {sample_products}</p><p>This additional context will be included with every call to the agent. It initializes the agent with a basic understanding of the structure and shape of the data, which makes it easier for the agent to construct accurate queries from the start.\nLet‚Äôs give it a try.</p><p>You should notice that the agent now constructs queries that better match how the data is shaped. For example, it may use the category column to search for plans labeled as ‚ÄúHome,‚Äù or rely on the properties column to filter for plans with specific internet speeds.</p><h2><strong>Step 4 ‚Äì Retry When No Results Are Found</strong></h2><p>Even if the agent is capable of generating valid SQL queries and has seen sample data, there‚Äôs still a chance it will produce a query that technically runs but returns no results.</p><p>In the current implementation, when that happens, the tool simply returns an empty list, and the agent assumes there are no relevant options. But in reality, the issue may be with how the agent built the query, not with a lack of products.</p><p>To address this, we can update the tool to return a clear message when no products are found‚Äîencouraging the agent to try a different approach. Here‚Äôs how the updated run method might look:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>With this change, the agent receives explicit feedback when a query returns no matches. It can then choose to revise the query and try again with broader or alternative criteria.</p><p>This gives the agent an opportunity to step back and reconsider its assumptions, leading to better resilience and more accurate results when dealing with uncertain or ambiguous user requests.</p><h2><strong>Step 5 ‚Äì Respect the Expected Number of Results</strong></h2><p>In some cases, a user might indicate how many products they want to see‚Äîperhaps just one recommendation or the top three matches. Right now, the agent doesn‚Äôt take that into account. It may return a long list of results, even if the user only wanted a few.</p><p>We can improve this by passing the expected number of results as part of the tool input. The tool will then check whether the number of matches exceeds this limit. If it does, it will prompt the agent to follow up and narrow the criteria.</p><p>First, update the input schema to include this new parameter:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>This addition helps turn the agent into a more effective product search assistant. Instead of assuming that the initial results are appropriate, the agent now reflects on the quantity of data returned, checks it against user expectations, and adjusts accordingly. This creates a more collaborative flow where the agent and user refine the query together to land on a relevant result.</p><h2><strong>Step 6 ‚Äì Enable the Agent to Finalize a Purchase</strong></h2><p>Once the user finds a plan that matches their needs, the next logical step is to help them act on it. Right now, our agent can recommend products but doesn‚Äôt support any kind of checkout process.</p><p>To make this possible, we‚Äôll give the agent the ability to generate a contract URL the user can follow to finalize their purchase. This effectively allows the agent to transition from discovery to action.</p><p>Start by creating a new tool, PurchaseTool, which accepts a plan_sku and returns a contract finalization link:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Lastly, modify the search tool‚Äôs return message slightly to encourage the agent to propose a contract. The agent will likely figure it out even without this hint, but there‚Äôs no harm in pushing it more explicitly:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>With this addition, your agent becomes a guided assistant that helps the user discover a suitable plan and smoothly transition into completing the purchase.</p><h2><strong>Step 7 ‚Äì Ask for Additional Customer Details</strong></h2><p>Before the agent pushes the user to sign a contract, it can also ensure that it collects any additional information needed to complete the process‚Äîsuch as the customer‚Äôs name and location.\nTo support this, update the PurchaseToolInput schema with two new fields:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Thanks to the structured schema and tool description, the agent will know that it must collect these inputs from the user before invoking the tool. If the information isn‚Äôt provided initially, the agent can follow up with questions like:</p><p>Could you tell me your name and zip code so I can finalize the contract?</p><p>This closes the loop and ensures that the agent not only helps discover the right plan but can also guide the user through to a complete and personalized purchase process.</p><p>In this walkthrough, we explored how to build a practical AI agent for product catalog search using Enthusiast.

We will explore the mathematics behind these algorithms by coding them in Python as we go. You can find the code from my <a href=\"https://github.com/CodeFromTheDeepEnd/CRYSTALS-Learning-Resources\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">GitHub repo</a>.</p><p>The reader is assumed certain maturity in mathematics and basic understanding of Python. We don't prove anything, instead the focus is to introduce and build needed machinery that we will use later. \nThe mathematical part of this presentation follows closely the way Alfred Menezes presents it in his excellent <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h5pfTIE6slU&amp;ab_channel=Cryptography101\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">video series</a> on the topic.</p><p>When we say two integers \n\n\n and \n\n are congruent modulo \n\n we mean \n\n is a integer multiple of \n\n  In this case we write </p>\nWith \n\n we mean \n\n is the remainder of integer \n\n divided \n\n This implies \n<p>\n is the ring of integers modulo \n\n  In this ring addition and multiplication are performed modulo \n</p><p>We implement integers in \n\n in class Zq.

The quotient ring (often called just \"polynomial ring\") \n\n consists of polynomials in \n\n of degree less than \n\n In ring \n\n the multiplication of polynomials is performed modulo the polynomial \n\n called the reduction polynomial. This means that the product of polynomials \n\n is defined as the remainder \n\n of their product when divided by \n\n in the polynomial ring. Notice that by definition now degree of \n\n is at most \n\n and \n</p><p>One should notice here that remainder is not calculated by the traditional polynomial division algorithm, but with division rules that apply in the polynomial ring. For our purposes it suffices to acknowledge that if the polynomial has degrees \n\n you can apply the rules \n</p>\n and in general for \n\n and then simplify the resulting polynomial normally. To understand why, please visit ring theory and ideals.\n\n<p>Overloading addition and subtraction is straightforward, but multiplication needs special treatment. Here we utilize the fact that Zq has multiplication operation overloaded. In real-life implementations this naive implementation is too slow and NTT-algorithm is used instead.

Each simulation request to the compute server took a whole minute (~60 seconds) to complete, which incidentally exasperated the resource limits of the deployment.</p><p>In this article, we'll discuss the steps that I took to make the application virtually infinitely scalable (i.e., no server compute bottleneck) thanks to sub-second client-side execution. <em>That's faster than a page load!</em> üî•</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Simulating Course Match with CourseCast\n</h2><p>On simulation day, the Course Match algorithm determines the  for all offered courses based on their supply and demand. Upon completion, Course Match will have been able to assign schedules to each student (in a single round!) such that the course utilities and obtained credits are maximized given the student's respective budget constraints.</p><blockquote><p>üí° You can think of Course Match as an autonomous shopper that \"buys\" courses on behalf of the student. The purchasing power is only limited by the student's token budget, their maximum workload/credits, and their assigned utilities. The higher the token budget, the greater the student's capability to \"afford\" the clearing price for a course.</p></blockquote><p>Since it's impossible to know ahead of time what the actual clearing prices will be, CourseCast instead forecasts the clearing prices based on the most recent historical data of actual clearing prices in previous Course Match runs. These predicted prices (and their statistical variances) are the \"weights\" of the model trained on the latest course and instructor trends.</p><p>To account for forecast uncertainty, the CourseCast model assumes that the predicted clearing price is a normally distributed random variable. As such, CourseCast runs 100 Monte Carlo simulations and counts the frequency of particular courses and schedule configurations being selected. These simulation results are presented to the user as a probability.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  So where was the bottleneck?\n</h2><p>The original CourseCast 2024 was prototyped and deployed as a <a href=\"https://streamlit.io/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Streamlit</a> application written in Python. Students would input their course utilities and submit their simulation request to the Streamlit Community Cloud where:</p><ul><li>The Python back end on <em>shared virtual compute resources</em> would parse course data and load model weights from a hosted Excel spreadsheet.</li><li>The service would recompute all of the scheduling conflicts between courses (~200 in total). Example: classes with overlapping schedules, classes with overlapping sections, and other logistical constraints.</li><li>Run 100 Monte Carlo simulations . Each of which is an instance of a linear programming solver.</li></ul><p>As CourseCast went viral among thousands of UPenn students, the scalability cracks began to show. When too many concurrent users hammered the Streamlit application, students couldn't run their simulations.</p><p>To be fair, the application was on the Streamlit free tier, but it was definitely high time for a rewrite to something more production-grade.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  So how did we scale CourseCast 2025?\n</h2><p>Now that we know where the bottlenecks are, let's tackle them one by one.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Scrapping the Python Server\n</h3><p>My first instinct was to ask: <em>is Python necessary at all?</em> The Monte Carlo simulation was essentially a glorified  loop over a linear programming solver. Nothing about the core simulation logic was specific to Python. In fact, the only Python-specific implementation detail was the usage of Excel spreadsheet parser libraries and linear programming solver libraries for Python. I figured...</p><ul><li>If there was a way to package and compress the Excel spreadsheet in a web-friendly format, then there's nothing stopping us from loading the entire dataset in the browser! Sure enough, the <a href=\"https://parquet.apache.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Parquet</a> file format was specifically designed for efficient portability.</li><li>If there was an equivalent linear programming solver library in JavaScript, then there's nothing stopping us from running simulations in the browser! Sure enough, there was the <a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/yalps\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"></a> library (among many other options).</li></ul><p>At this point, I was fully convinced that we could scrap the Python server and compute the simulation entirely in the browser. This approach effectively allows us to infinitely scale our simulation capacity as we would no longer be constrained by shared cloud compute limits.</p><p>That solves our scalability problem! ‚úÖ</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Precomputing Static Course Conflicts\n</h3><p>The next bottleneck was the course conflict generation logic. Recall that  simulation request recomputes the logistical constraints on course selections (e.g., disallowing classes with overlapping schedules). This is fairly non-trivial work as there are hundreds of classes to consider.</p><p>So, naturally, the solution is to precompute these conflicts ahead of time. The precompute script takes the raw course data and appends the \"conflict groups\" of each course. These \"conflict groups\" ultimately determine the statically known logistical constraints of the linear programming solver.</p><blockquote><p>üìù In computer science parlance, you can think of these \"conflict groups\" as equivalence classes defined by the relation of overlapping course schedules. That is to say, for all pairs of courses within an equivalence class, their schedules must have a non-empty schedule intersection. Thus, a \"conflict group\" is just a label for a group of pairwise-intersecting courses.</p></blockquote><p>All of the course metadata, seeded random values, and conflict groups are embedded in a single compressed  file (~90 KiB) and served to the user via a CDN for efficient delivery and caching. There is also the option of caching the file in a <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Service_Worker_API\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Service Worker</a>, but the edge CDN already works well enough.</p><p>That solves our repeated work problem! ‚úÖ</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Offloading CPU-Bound Work to a Separate Thread\n</h3><p>The next bottleneck is the sequential execution of Monte Carlo simulation runs. There's actually no reason for us to run them sequentially because each sampled price prediction is independent from the 99 other trials. The simulation can thus be parallelized at the trial level.</p><p>Since each simulation run is primarily a linear programming solver, we know that the work is CPU-bound, not I/O-bound. The - model will  work here because <a href=\"https://dev.to/somedood/javascript-concurrency-avoiding-the-sequential-trap-7f0\">CPU-bound work blocks the event loop</a>. We  offload the work to another thread to keep the UI responsive.</p><p>In the browser, we only have one way to spawn multiple threads: through the <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Workers_API\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Web Worker API</a>.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>We can then wrap the worker message-passing logic in a  interface and leverage libraries like <a href=\"https://tanstack.com/query/latest\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">TanStack Query</a> for clean pending states in the UI. The example below uses React for demonstration, but this pattern is framework-agnostic.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>That solves our responsive UI problem! ‚úÖ</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Parallelizing with Worker Thread Pools\n</h3><p>A more advanced implementation of this one-shot request-response worker architecture leverages thread pools to send work to already initialized workers (as opposed to re-initializing them for each work request).</p><p>We can use <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Navigator/hardwareConcurrency\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><code>navigator.hardwareConcurrency</code></a> to determine the optimal number of worker threads to spawn in the pool. Spawning more workers than the maximum hardware concurrency is pointless because the hardware would not have enough cores to service that parallelism anyway.</p><blockquote><p>‚ö†Ô∏è In the previous section, the  was initialized by the  function. In a worker pool, this should instead be provided as an argument to the  function because  is no longer the \"owner\" of the thread resource and thus has no say in the worker lifetime. Worker termination  be the responsibility of the thread pool, not the sendWork function.</p></blockquote><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><blockquote><p>üìù Request cancellation is not implemented here for the sake of brevity, but it is fairly trivial to forward the <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/AbortSignal\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"></a> from TanStack Query into the thread pool. It's only a matter of terminating the workers upon receiving the  event.</p></blockquote><p>The thread pool optimization allowed us to run 100 simulations in parallel batches across all of the device's cores. Together with the precomputed conflict groups, the Monte Carlo simulation was effectively reduced from a minute to sub-second territory! üî•</p><p>That solves our performance problems! ‚úÖ</p><p>After all of these optimizations, I upgraded CourseCast from a prototype that struggled with a hundred concurrent users (with ~60 seconds per simulation request) to an infinitely scalable simulator with sub-second execution speeds (faster than a page load!).</p><p>CourseCast now guides 1000+ UPenn students to make informed decisions and (blazingly!) fast experiments about their course schedules. And we're just getting started! üöÄ</p><p>Throughout this work, I had a few key takeaways:</p><ul><li>Always leave the door open for the possibility of offloading compute to the browser. Modern Web APIs are highly capable with great browser support nowadays. Keep exploring ways to save ourselves from the infrastructure burden of bespoke Python services.</li><li>Always find opportunities to precompute static data. May it be through a precompute script like in CourseCast or a materialized view in the database, strive to do the least amount of repeated work.</li><li>Keep a sharp eye out for parallelizable work. There are many opportunities in data science and general scientific computing where data processing need not be sequential (e.g., dot products, seeded simulation runs, independent events, etc.).</li></ul><p>On a more human perspective, it's always a pleasure to have the code that I write be in service of others‚Äîespecially students! As software engineers, it's easy to forget about the human users at the other end of the screen. To be reminded of the positive impact of our code on others never fails to make our work all the more worth it.</p><blockquote><p><em>\"Have been hearing tons of amazing feedback.

Imagine a massive User table stuffed with profile details, login history, and billing information. Queries slow down as the database scans irrelevant columns for every request. Sound familiar? Let‚Äôs explore vertical partitioning‚Äîa powerful technique to streamline your database‚Äîand touch on caching for even faster data retrieval.</p><p><strong>What Is Vertical Partitioning?</strong></p><p>Vertical partitioning splits a wide table into smaller, focused tables based on usage patterns. Instead of one bloated User table, you create separate tables for specific data groups. This reduces the number of columns scanned during queries, boosting performance and minimizing disk I/O.\nFor example, suppose your User table stores:</p><p>Profile details: name, email, profile picture\nLogin history: last login timestamp, IP addresses<p>\nBilling information: billing address, payment details</p></p><p>As the table grows, even a simple query like fetching a user‚Äôs name forces the database to wade through all columns. Vertical partitioning solves this by splitting the table into:</p><div><pre><code>-- User_Profile table\nCREATE TABLE User_Profile (\n    user_id INT PRIMARY KEY,\n    name VARCHAR(100),\n    email VARCHAR(100),\n    profile_picture VARCHAR(255)\n);\n\n-- User_Login table\nCREATE TABLE User_Login (\n    user_id INT PRIMARY KEY,\n    last_login DATETIME,\n    ip_address VARCHAR(45)\n);\n\n-- User_Billing table\nCREATE TABLE User_Billing (\n    user_id INT PRIMARY KEY,\n    billing_address TEXT,\n    payment_details VARCHAR(255)\n)\n</code></pre></div><p>Each table now holds only the columns relevant to specific queries, making data retrieval faster and more efficient.</p><p>Flowchart: Visualizing Vertical Partitioning\nHere's an ASCII art representation of the vertical partitioning process for illustration:</p><p>+-------------------------+\n|      User Table         |<p>\n| - name                  |</p>\n| - email                 |<p>\n| - profile_picture       |</p>\n| - last_login            |<p>\n| - ip_address            |</p>\n| - billing_address       |<p>\n| - payment_details       |</p>\n+-------------------------+\n           | Split (Vertical Partitioning)\n    +-------------+   +-------------+   +-------------+<p>\n    |User_Profile |   | User_Login  |   |User_Billing |</p>\n    | - user_id   |   | - user_id  |   | - user_id  |<p>\n    | - name     |   | - last_login|   | - billing_ |</p>\n    | - email    |   | - ip_address|   |   address  |<p>\n    | - profile_ |   |             |   | - payment_ |</p>\n    |   picture  |   |             |   |   details  |<p>\n    +-------------+   +-------------+   +-------------+</p>\n           |\n+-------------------------+<p>\n|    Faster Queries       |</p>\n| (Reduced Disk I/O)      |<p>\n+-------------------------+</p></p><p>This visual shows how splitting the table streamlines data access.</p><p><strong>Taking It Further with Caching</strong></p><p>Vertical partitioning optimizes disk-based queries, but disk access is still slower than memory. Enter caching: storing frequently accessed data (e.g., user profiles) in memory using tools like Redis or Memcached. This delivers lightning-fast access for common queries, complementing the efficiency of partitioned tables.</p><ul><li><p>By combining vertical partitioning and caching, you can:</p></li><li><p>Improve query performance: Scan fewer columns and retrieve data faster.</p></li><li><p>Reduce resource usage: Lower disk I/O and server load.</p></li><li><p>Scale efficiently: Handle growing data without sacrificing speed.</p></li></ul><p>Ready to optimize your database? Analyze your tables‚Äô usage patterns, identify columns that can be partitioned, and consider caching for frequently accessed data. Experiment with these techniques in a test environment and watch your application‚Äôs performance soar!</p>","contentLength":3624,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Pack, the new-gen workflow manager","url":"https://dev.to/robert19066/pack-the-new-gen-workflow-manager-55bo","date":1755781370,"author":"robert19066","guid":235715,"unread":true,"content":"<p>Project Pack V1, or simply <a href=\"https://github.com/robert19066/Pack\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Pack</a>, is a Python-based \"packlet\" (workflow) manager that allows users to create, store, and execute custom shell command sequences with various execution modes and privilege configurations.

At the end, there is a detailed comparison table on features &amp; benchmarks.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  üéØ Using GPT-4o (ChatGPT) API\n</h2><p>Let‚Äôs start with <a href=\"https://openai.com/index/hello-gpt-4o/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">OpenAI‚Äôs GPT-4o</a>. It's capable of understanding text and extracting structured information when prompted correctly. But unlike Invofox, it can‚Äôt directly read PDF files.</p><p>So we first need to extract the text using OCR (like Tesseract, pdfplumber or an online tool), then send that text to GPT via an API prompt.</p><p>GPT-4o, especially via the ChatGPT web interface and certain API endpoints (notably in Azure OpenAI Service), can accept PDFs and images as inputs and extract structured data. But since we are using the API, it's not really possible.</p><p>You will need an <a href=\"https://platform.openai.com/api-keys\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">OpenAI API key</a>. Create a  file and attach it with this convention.</p><div><pre><code>your_api_key\n</code></pre></div>\nopenai api key\n\n\n\n<p>We will use Python for this. Here's how you can try it yourself, step by step.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Step 1: Set up your Python environment\n</h3><p>Creating a virtual environment means setting up an isolated space for your Python project where all dependencies are installed locally (and not system-wide). This avoids version conflicts and keeps your global Python installation clean. So let‚Äôs create one.</p><div><pre><code>\npython3  venv /bin/activate  \npython  venv \n.nvcriptsctivate  </code></pre></div><p>You will know it‚Äôs active when you see  at the beginning of your terminal prompt.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Step 2: Install required packages\n</h3><p>We need two main libraries:</p><ul><li>: to use the GPT-4o API</li><li> : Loads environment variables from a  file into Python, useful for managing API keys and secrets.\n</li></ul><div><pre><code>pip pdfplumber openai python-dotenv\n</code></pre></div><p>I installed the  later so that's why it's not visible in the command.</p><p>After installing your dependencies, run:</p><div><pre><code>pip freeze  requirements.txt\n</code></pre></div><p>This writes all installed packages in your virtual environment (with versions) into . You can then use this file later with:</p><div><pre><code>pip  requirements.txt\n</code></pre></div><p>For reference, please add a  in the root directory to avoid pushing the virtual environment directory.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Step 3: Extract text and parse with GPT-4o\n</h3><p>Here is the <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/16CgRRnk9KAn1lHhm2os9niJjKXM8tcnt/view?usp=sharing\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">sample Invoice PDF</a> that I'm using for the example. I'm attaching a snapshot so you can get the idea of the fields we are going to extract.</p><p>Let's write the complete code with the file name as .</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Here's a simple explanation:</p><ul><li><p> : uses  reads each page of the PDF and concatenates the extracted text. This gives you the raw, unstructured invoice content as a string.</p></li><li><p><code>parse_invoice_with_openai</code> : Sends this prompt to the GPT‚Äë4o model via the  endpoint, asking GPT‚Äë4o to extract five key fields. </p></li><li><p>The model then processes the prompt and returns a JSON-formatted response.</p></li></ul><p>Here is the JSON response after running the script using .</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>GPT-4o (ChatGPT) output for invoice line items isn‚Äôt consistently labeled \"lines\". Sometimes it's \"Line Items\" or something less standardized, while other tools (like Invofox) always use a consistent name like \"lines\" for those entries.</p>\nterminal output\n\n\n\n<p>Here we instruct GPT-4o via a system prompt to parse the text. This can work reasonably well as the API is strong enough now (compared to previous OpenAI models).</p><p>‚úÖ Pros: Easy to try, flexible. GPT-4 excels at logic and structured data extraction, so it can correctly identify invoice fields and calculate totals.</p><ul><li>The problem I see is that we still have to engineer prompts and verify the output (which is not possible for everyone).</li><li>The JSON can be malformed or may miss fields (hallucinations are possible). </li><li>There‚Äôs no built‚Äëin validation or confidence scores. </li><li>GPT requires sending all text in prompts (which would be costly for large docs) and outputs vary by prompt style.</li></ul><p>GPT-4o is billed per token. The estimated cost for a 1‚Äì2 page invoice extraction falls in the $0.005‚Äì$0.018 range, depending on how detailed your prompt and output are. You can also use this <a href=\"https://docsbot.ai/tools/gpt-openai-api-pricing-calculator\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">pricing calculator</a> based on your use case.</p><p>It can respond in 1‚Äì30s but is subject to load spikes, especially for large prompts.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  üéØ Using Claude 3.5 Sonnet API\n</h2><p><a href=\"https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-3-5-sonnet\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Anthropic's Claude 3.5 Sonnet</a> model is also capable of parsing structured data from text when prompted correctly. Like GPT-4o, it cannot read PDF files directly via API, so we will first extract the text from an invoice PDF, then pass it to Claude for structured parsing.</p><p>You will need an <a href=\"https://console.anthropic.com/settings/keys\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Anthropic API key</a>. Create a  file and attach it with this convention:</p><div><pre><code>ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_api_key\n</code></pre></div><p>We will use Python again for this setup and follow the same instructions used in the last section.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Step 1: Set up environment and install packages\n</h3><p>Just like before, let‚Äôs isolate our dependencies in a virtual environment.</p><div><pre><code>\npython3  venv /bin/activate\n\n\npython  venv \n.nvcriptsctivate\n</code></pre></div><p>Once activated, your terminal will show a  prefix.</p><p>We need the following libraries:</p><ul><li> : to extract text from PDF</li><li> : official SDK to interact with Claude 3.5</li><li> : to load the API key from a  file\n</li></ul><div><pre><code>pip pdfplumber anthropic python-dotenv\n</code></pre></div><p>If you are following from the last example, we just need to install the anthropic package.</p><p>Then export your environment to a  file. Make sure to include a  to avoid committing the virtual environment.</p><div><pre><code>pip freeze  requirements.txt\n</code></pre></div><h3>\n  \n  \n  Step 2: Extract text and parse with Claude 3.5 Sonnet\n</h3><p>As Anthropic launches safer and more capable models, they regularly retire older models. So you can check the <a href=\"https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/about-claude/model-deprecations#model-status\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">model status</a> of which ones are deprecated, retired and which ones are active. I will be using <code>claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620</code> active version for the example.</p><p>Let's write the complete code with the file name as . It's very similar to the previous section and I'm using the same <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/16CgRRnk9KAn1lHhm2os9niJjKXM8tcnt/view?usp=sharing\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">sample Invoice PDF</a>.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Here's a simple explanation:</p><ul><li><p> : uses  to pull plain text from each page of the PDF.</p></li><li><p><code>parse_invoice_with_claude</code> : sends the text to Claude Sonnet 3.5 with a specific prompt asking for JSON output.</p></li><li><p>Claude returns a stringified JSON block with the requested fields.</p></li></ul><p>You can run the script using  in the terminal. Here's the JSON response:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><ul><li>Claude 3.5 is very strong at understanding long text and formatting it cleanly.</li><li>Claude Sonnet can handle text (and even images via embedding) in its prompts</li><li>In some cases, it handles unusual or long documents slightly better than GPT-4.</li></ul><ul><li>Like GPT, Claude requires prompt engineering.</li><li>Like GPT, Claude can sometimes miss fields or make up values (hallucinate).</li><li>It still returns raw JSON text without validation, so you must parse/verify it.</li><li>You still need to extract text yourself, it doesn‚Äôt parse raw PDFs.</li></ul><p>Claude 3.5 Sonnet is also billed per token.

The GUI also provides many options, including filtering the extracted data.</p><p>Based on how the workflow is set up, it may be necessary to mark it as completed, as involving a human in the loop ensures the highest accuracy and gives us more control.</p><p>The other way (recommended) is to make a  request to <code>https://api.invofox.com/documents/{documentID}</code> with headers as:</p><ul><li>key: , value: </li><li>key: , value: </li></ul><p>Here is a trimmed JSON response with the original format.

Actual test response times reported in the blog are consistently under 5s.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  üéØ Python Code using Invofox API\n</h3><p>Many developers prefer extracting documents with code, so let‚Äôs walk through the same process using the Invofox API with Python. We will keep it brief, with just the code and JSON response.</p><p>The overall process is the same as the previous sections, so I'm not repeating that. You can read the <a href=\"https://developers.invofox.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">docs</a> if you are interested in exploring for yourself.</p><p>We need to install <a href=\"https://pypi.org/project/requests/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">requests</a>, a Python library that makes it easy to send HTTP requests (such as GET, POST) and work with web APIs.</p><p>We will also use the  built-in Python module that comes pre-installed with every standard Python installation. The&nbsp;&nbsp;module provides various time-related functions such as delays (), timestamps and more. In our case, we will use it to pause execution, giving the document enough time to be processed on the dashboard.</p><p>Let's write the complete code with the file name as .</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Here are all the Invofox API endpoints used:</p><p>Here is the JSON response after running the script using .</p><p>The JSON response is similar to what we got after making a request using Postman. It also provides the image of the original invoice in the response and a lot of useful fields.</p><p>Let's compare their methods in brief.</p><ul><li><ul><li>GPT-4o/Claude ‚Üí send text with prompt</li><li>Invofox ‚Üí use API or upload a file (image/PDF) in bulk</li></ul></li><li><ul><li>GPT/Claude ‚Üí need to write prompt engineering code</li><li>Invofox ‚Üí minimal code, no prompt</li></ul></li><li><ul><li>GPT/Claude ‚Üí you need to manually verify </li><li>Invofox ‚Üí built-in validation and confidence scores</li></ul></li><li><ul><li>GPT/Claude ‚Üí limited by token/window size</li><li>Invofox ‚Üí handles multi-page docs via backend OCR and AI</li></ul></li></ul><p>While parsing the invoice, here's what I realized:</p><ul><li><p> : Good at parsing known fields if prompted clearly. You get a JSON string but must parse/clean it yourself. Errors can occur if prompts are unclear.</p></li><li><p> : It's very similar to GPT-4. In the snapshots, you can see Sonnet handled the invoice fields about as well as GPT-4, sometimes better at recognizing unfamiliar terms. But we still had to massage the prompt.</p></li><li><p> : It returned the fully parsed invoice JSON out-of-the-box. All fields were correctly extracted and validated. The output schema was exactly what we needed, with no extra coding.</p></li></ul><p>Now that we have explored each option, let‚Äôs compare them side by side. Estimates are based on typical invoice lengths: simple invoices are 1‚Äì2 pages &amp; 1000-2000 tokens total.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Cost &amp; Execution Time Benchmarks\n</h3><p>We covered the pricing structure in each of the sections, but I have also done it side-by-side so it's easier to make a decision.</p><p>You should also acknowledge the ongoing cost and effort involved in upgrading language models. Teams often need to benchmark new models, retest prompts and schemas and adjust output parsing logic whenever a new version is released.</p><p>These hidden maintenance costs aren‚Äôt always obvious but should be considered. With Invofox, there is no such requirement.</p><p>For quick experiments or one-off tasks, you can use GPT-4 (ChatGPT API) or Claude Sonnet to parse invoice text by crafting suitable prompts. They will do a decent job extracting fields in JSON (since GPT-4 tends to produce more structured and cleaner outputs than earlier GPT-3). </p><p>However, for reliable production-grade parsing of invoices or receipts, the Invofox API is superior. It‚Äôs specifically built for documents using advanced proprietary models and continual feedback.</p><p>I hope you learned how to parse documents. Let me know if you have any questions or feedback.</p><p>Have a great day!

What many people don‚Äôt realize is that most photos already come with a hidden trail of breadcrumbs that can solve this problem: .</p><p>Every time you snap a photo with a smartphone or digital camera, extra information gets embedded into the file, details like the date, camera settings, and, in many cases, the exact GPS coordinates of where the picture was taken. This hidden metadata is called <strong>EXIF (Exchangeable Image File Format)</strong>, and it‚Äôs more powerful than it looks. While smartphones often automatically organize your photos, many of us still have massive collections stored on a , where sorting and searching manually can feel impossible.</p><p>By extracting EXIF data, you can do much more than just learn which lens or exposure setting was used. You can <strong>index, organize, and search your entire photo library</strong> in ways that go far beyond filenames and folders. Want to pull up every photo taken in Paris? Or quickly filter for shots within 10 kilometers (about 6 miles) of Central Park? With EXIF indexing, that becomes not only possible but straightforward.</p><p>In this article, we‚Äôll explore how to extract EXIF metadata, build an index of your photos, including those on NAS drives, and run location-based searches to find exactly what you‚Äôre looking for.</p><p>When you take a photo, your camera doesn‚Äôt just capture light, it also records a set of descriptive details about the image, known as .

You have the recipe (your machine learning algorithm), but the perfect cake depends on the precise amounts of each ingredient (your hyperparameters): the oven temperature, baking time, amount of sugar, etc. Getting these just right is crucial for a delicious outcome. This, in essence, is hyperparameter tuning. And Grid Search is one powerful technique to help us find that perfect recipe.</p><p>Hyperparameter tuning is the process of finding the optimal set of hyperparameters for a machine learning model to achieve the best possible performance. Hyperparameters are settings that are  learned from the data during training, unlike the model's parameters (weights and biases). They control the learning process itself. Grid Search is a brute-force approach to hyperparameter tuning where we systematically try out every combination of hyperparameters within a predefined range.</p><p>Let's break down the core concepts:</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  1. The Hyperparameter Landscape\n</h3><p>Imagine a multi-dimensional space where each dimension represents a hyperparameter (e.g., learning rate, regularization strength). Each point in this space represents a unique combination of hyperparameters, and each point corresponds to a model's performance (e.g., accuracy, F1-score). Our goal is to find the point with the highest performance.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  2. The Grid Search Algorithm\n</h3><p>Grid Search is a straightforward algorithm:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Define the hyperparameter search space:</strong>  Specify the range and values for each hyperparameter.  For example:  in ,  in .</p></li><li><p> Generate all possible combinations of hyperparameter values.  This forms our \"grid\" of points in the hyperparameter space.</p></li><li><p> For each combination in the grid:</p><ul><li>Train the model using those hyperparameters.</li><li>Evaluate the model's performance using a suitable metric (e.g., accuracy on a validation set).</li></ul></li><li><p> Choose the hyperparameter combination that yielded the best performance.</p></li></ol><p>Here's a simplified Python pseudo-code representation:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><h3>\n  \n  \n  3.  Mathematical Underpinnings (Optimization)\n</h3><p>Grid Search doesn't explicitly use gradient-based optimization. Instead, it's a form of . Gradient-based methods, like gradient descent, rely on calculating the gradient (the direction of steepest ascent) of the performance function with respect to each hyperparameter. This gradient guides the search towards better hyperparameter combinations. Grid Search, however, simply tries all combinations and selects the best one. It's computationally expensive but conceptually simple.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Real-World Applications and Impact\n</h2><p>Grid Search, despite its simplicity, finds widespread application:</p><ul><li> Optimizing convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures by tuning hyperparameters like the number of layers, filter sizes, and learning rate.</li><li><strong>Natural Language Processing (NLP):</strong> Fine-tuning the hyperparameters of recurrent neural networks (RNNs) or transformers for tasks like sentiment analysis or machine translation.</li><li> Adjusting the hyperparameters of collaborative filtering or content-based filtering algorithms to improve recommendation accuracy.</li></ul><h2>\n  \n  \n  Challenges and Limitations\n</h2><ul><li>  The number of combinations grows exponentially with the number of hyperparameters and the range of values.  This can be computationally prohibitive for complex models or large search spaces.</li><li>  As the number of hyperparameters increases, the search space becomes incredibly vast, making it difficult to find the global optimum.</li><li> Grid Search might get stuck in a local optimum, especially in non-convex performance landscapes.</li></ul><p>The computational cost of Grid Search can have environmental implications due to high energy consumption. Careful consideration of the search space and efficient algorithms are crucial to mitigate this.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  The Future of Hyperparameter Tuning\n</h2><p>While Grid Search provides a valuable baseline, more sophisticated techniques like randomized search, Bayesian optimization, and evolutionary algorithms are gaining popularity due to their efficiency in handling high-dimensional search spaces. Research continues to explore more efficient and robust methods for hyperparameter optimization, addressing the challenges of scalability and the need for less computationally expensive solutions.

Where sex, trade, and culture operated under systems of inequality. And yet, despite these challenges, ideas and identities moved faster than we might think. This is the fascinating world of Ancient Rome, a complex, uneven, and often uncomfortable prototype of globalization.</p><p>In this blog post, we'll take a closer look at what it was like to live in Ancient Rome as an ordinary person, navigating daily life. We'll explore the roads, the sex, the trade, and the culture, and see how they all fit together to create a world that was both familiar and foreign to us.</p><p>First, let's talk about the roads. The Romans were famous for their engineering feats, and their roads were no exception. They built roads all over their empire, connecting cities and towns and making it easier for people and goods to move around. But these roads were not built for convenience. They were built for conquest. The Romans believed that having a well-connected empire was essential for maintaining control over their territories, and so they invested heavily in building and maintaining their roads.</p><p>Next, let's talk about sex. Sex was an important part of Roman culture, and it was often used as a way to assert power and status. Men were expected to be the active partners in sexual relationships, while women were expected to be passive. However, there were also many examples of same-sex relationships in ancient Rome, and these were often accepted and even celebrated.</p><p>Moving on to trade, the Romans were skilled traders. They established a system of currency that allowed for the exchange of goods and services across their empire. They also built ports and markets to facilitate trade, and they encouraged the growth of industries such as agriculture and mining.</p><p>Finally, let's talk about culture. The Romans had a rich and diverse culture, with influences from all over the world. They were known for their art, literature, and architecture, and they were also famous for their festivals and celebrations. However, like many ancient societies, the Romans also had systems of inequality in place. The wealthy and powerful held most of the power, while the poor and marginalized were often left out of the decision-making process.</p><p>Despite these challenges, the Roman Empire was a remarkable achievement. It was a complex, uneven, and often uncomfortable prototype of globalization, with roads, sex, trade, and culture all operating under systems of inequality. But despite these challenges, ideas and identities moved faster than we might think, and the legacy of the Roman Empire continues to shape our world today.</p><p>So, the next time you're driving on a well-connected highway or enjoying a piece of Roman art, take a moment to appreciate the incredible achievements of this ancient civilization.

Recently, NASA's Hubble Space Telescope and NASA's Chandra X-ray Observatory teamed up to identify a new possible example of a rare class of black holes. This discovery was made by observing X-ray emission (in purple) in an image released on July 24, 2025.</p><p>The black hole in question, called NGC 6099 HLX-1, is located in a compact star cluster in a giant elliptical galaxy. This makes it a unique find, as most black holes are found in the centers of galaxies, and not in compact star clusters.</p><p>Black holes are incredibly dense objects, with masses up to several times that of our Sun. They are formed when a massive star collapses under its own gravity. Black holes are also known for their intense gravitational pull, which can cause objects to be pulled in and never escape.</p><p>One of the most fascinating things about black holes is their ability to consume matter. As matter falls towards a black hole, it heats up and emits X-rays. This is what scientists observed in the case of NGC 6099 HLX-1.

The verdict, which was handed down on February 19, 2021, means that Tesla will have to pay $200 million in damages. Autopilot is a feature that comes pre-installed on Tesla's cars and is designed to handle things like collision detection and emergency braking.</p><p>The case, which was brought by the family of Naibel Benavides Leon and Dillon Angulo, who were killed in the crash, played out differently from other cases involving Tesla's Autopilot feature. The jury ultimately decided that the self-driving tech enabled driver George McGee was at fault for the crash, which occurred on March 1, 2019, in Fort Lauderdale, Florida.</p><p>During the trial, Tesla's lawyers argued that McGee's decision to take his eyes off the road to reach for his phone was the cause of the crash, and that Autopilot should not be considered. However, the plaintiffs argued that Tesla and Elon Musk, the company's CEO, had marketed Autopilot as a fully autonomous driving system, which led to a false sense of safety and contributed to the crash.</p><p>The verdict in this case is significant because it marks the first time that Tesla has been held liable for a crash involving its Autopilot feature. The company has mostly avoided taking responsibility for crashes involving cars with the Autopilot enabled, but this case sets a precedent for future cases.</p><p>The $200 million in damages that Tesla will have to pay is a significant amount, and it will likely have a financial impact on the company. However, the verdict is also a reminder that technology is not infallible, and that drivers must remain vigilant and attentive while operating a vehicle, even when using advanced safety features like Autopilot.</p><p>In conclusion, the verdict in this case is a landmark moment for the automotive industry and a reminder that technology is not a substitute for human responsibility. Tesla must continue to work towards improving its Autopilot feature and ensuring that it is used safely and responsibly by all drivers.</p>","contentLength":2237,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Building a Production-Ready Soft Delete System in Django (with Custom User Model)","url":"https://dev.to/saveen_kumar_4e9c80304ebe/building-a-production-ready-soft-delete-system-in-django-with-custom-user-model-44dd","date":1755720006,"author":"Saveen Kumar","guid":234708,"unread":true,"content":"<p>Soft delete sounds simple‚Äîuntil you're the one implementing it in a real-world, regulated application.</p><p>In building a financial portfolio management system, we faced the not-so-fun challenge of handling user deletion without compromising data integrity or violating compliance rules.

The goal is to understand Pandas, experiment with stock strategies better, and create an easy-to-use alternative to more complex backtesting tools. This is part 3 of the series where I build this library in public.</p><p>After finishing basic indicator calculation functions, I needed a way to keep track of all the stock information in an organised, reusable format. That‚Äôs where the  comes in‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääit acts as a container for everything you‚Äôll need in backtesting or simulation.</p><p>I initially thought it should be easy to code as it just needed to keep the information and require some simple import and export, but I was quite wrong.

So far,  supports imports from:</p><ul></ul><p>(This process felt quite  as I was just using built-in pandas functions or just straight-up copying documentation.)</p><p>To simplify things, I added an function that picks the correct import based on the file extension of  parameter. I used  so users can pass in additional parameters.</p><p>On top of that,  integrates directly with  (optional dependency). This allows fetching live stock data for a given ticker and date range, making it much more practical.</p><p>For testing purposes, there‚Äôs also a  function. It isn‚Äôt designed for real backtesting but is useful for experimenting with new features.</p><p>Here is a question: why export data you already imported? Two reasons:</p><ol><li> Users might want to inspect or clean their data after transformations.</li><li> I will soon integrate the indicator functions from earlier posts, with  so exporting results will be handy.</li></ol><p>Export currently supports all the same formats mentioned in import, plus SQL. There is also a flexible  function that lets you define your own export method.</p><p>It was such a twist, this step turned out to be more about data flexibility rather than really \"storing data.\" With StockData in place, stocksimpy now has a solid foundation for testing.</p><p>If you want to use this library in the future, or have any ideas that I could add, go for it.
