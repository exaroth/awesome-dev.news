One of the key challenges in modern agriculture is the accurate classification of agricultural products, which directly impacts quality control, pricing, and supply chain management. Traditional methods of classification often rely on manual inspection, which can be time-consuming and prone to errors.</p><p>With the rise of data-driven technologies, Machine Learning (ML) offers a powerful alternative to automate and enhance agricultural product classification. By analyzing dimensional and shape factors, ML algorithms can accurately classify various agricultural products, reducing manual labor and increasing efficiency. This project explores how machine learning techniques can be applied to classify agricultural products using real-world data, leading to smarter agricultural practices and better decision-making.</p><p>📊 Project Overview\nThis project focuses on classifying agricultural products based on dimensional and shape factors using machine learning.

Everything looks great in dev, the logs are clean, requests are snappy, and life is good. Then… disaster strikes. A user reports a bug. Another complains about slow response times. You check your logs—wait, where are they? You SSH into the server, tail some logs, guess what went wrong, and hope for the best. Sound familiar?</p><p>Observability—knowing what’s happening inside your app in real time—shouldn’t be this hard. But setting up an observability stack often feels like assembling IKEA furniture with missing instructions. That’s where  comes in.</p><p><a href=\"https://pydantic.dev/logfire\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Pydantic Logfire</a> is a platform that makes it ridiculously easy to add observability to your application, no matter the size. In this post, I’ll show you how to integrate Logfire into a  app to get instant insights into logs, traces, and metrics—without the usual setup headaches. By the end, you’ll have real-time visibility into what’s happening under the hood, so you can debug, optimize, and sleep better at night.</p><p>We will build two services that handles orders and shipping for BigHuge Corp Inc. To keep things straightforward, we'll put both the services in the same repo and run a FastAPI for each of them to emulate two services talking to each other.</p><div><pre><code>fastapi-logfire\nfastapi-logfire\n</code></pre></div><p>We'll create a virtual environment and activate it:</p><p>Let's install the necessary packages:</p><div><pre><code>pip </code></pre></div><h3> and  services\n</h3><p>The ordering service will contain just two endpoints - one to place an order and one to get the details of a specific order. Similarly the shipping service will have two endpoints - one to initiate the shipping process and one to get the status of a shipment. </p><p>The ordering service will invoke the shipping service in both its endpoints. \nHere's the code for both the services:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Now we'll create  and  which will be used to start both the services</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>You can run both services on separate terminals using the  command.</p><div><pre><code>fastapi dev 8001 app/main2.py\n</code></pre></div><p>You can go to  to try the ordering service out and see if everything is working as expected.</p><p>Before we integrate logfire, you need to create a token from Logfire so that you can write data to the logfire dashboard.  You can read on how to generate the token <a href=\"https://logfire.pydantic.dev/docs/#overview\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">here</a>. Once you have the token, you can save it as an environment variable in a  file (You might need to install  to use it).</p><p>We'll start small. We'll integrate logfire into our app such that all logs generated by the app will be sent to the logfire dashboard. We'll integrate logfire into the  standard library. (Tip: you can also emit logs directly using logfire methods like )</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>We've defined a  function that we can call anywhere in our project to send logs.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>You can add similar statements in the  handler as well.</p><p>In  and , we'll add the logic to configure logfire</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Do the same for , but with  as shipping.</p><p>If you run both the apps again, and try out some requests, you will see some logs displaying on the Live tab of the logfire dashboad:</p><p>Great! Now we see our logging statements in the dashboard. But Logfire lets us instrument fastapi directly to get even more data for each request. Let's implement that. </p><p>Under the  in both  and , add a new line of code:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Now all your requests to both servers are instrumented automatically.</p><p>Now all the service level logs are neatly nested under the respective requests. But get this - it can get even better. </p><p>So we set up our application in such a way the  endpoint will call  endpoint inside it. It would be really nice if our dashboard could display this sequential flow instead of showing both the calls as separate (like we saw before). We can do this using tracing. </p><p>For tracing to work, context has to be propagated across services. This \"context\" helps keep track of the parent trace/span of a new span/log so that they can be viewed in tandem.  Thankfully logfire gives us an easy way to do this. Since we're using  to use the  service, we'll install the associated library from logfire.</p><div><pre><code>pip </code></pre></div><p>We'll update the code in  to add <code>logfire.instrument_requests()</code></p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>We don't need to update  (the shipping one) because we aren't sending any requests in that server for now.</p><p> will make sure that the traceparent header is automatically set when making requests.  makes sure that the  header is extracted correctly from incoming requests. Thats it. !</p><p>Run the servers again, and try sending some requests. You'll see something like this in your logfire dashboard:</p><p>And heavens forbid, if something were to go wrong in one of the services, you now know exactly where it went wrong. Let's test this out:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>If we try  now, we'll see something like this:</p><p>Metrics signify how much of something exists. When paired with a time series, we can know the metric value at a point in time. This is useful for observing data like number of requests over a period of time, or things like CPU utilisation over time etc.</p><p>Setting up system metric tracking is pretty straightforward with logfire, so we'll do that first.</p><div><pre><code>pip </code></pre></div><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Now go to the logfire platform on your browser, select the \"Dashboards\" tab. Click on the \"New Dashboard\" button. Select \"Basic System Metrics (Logfire)\" from the drop down.</p><p>Run the server again and you should be seeing the graph populate with your system data.</p><p>if you choose \"Web Server Metrics\" from the create dashboard drop down, you'll get another readymade dashboard containing useful metrics from our services.</p><p>Now let's add a custom metric to see the orders placed over time. We'll use a counter for this one.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Now on the logfire platform, create a new dashboard and choose \"Start from scratch\" from the dropdown. Click on \"Add Chart\". We have to retrieve the data we need from logfire using SQL. To get an idea of how to structure your SQL queries, use the \"Explore\" tab in the logfire platform. </p><p>To get the total orders placed in a time period we'll use the following query:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Set the visualisation type as \"Values\" and save the chart. Now the chart will get updated based on the time period that you select on top.</p><p>To chart this in a time series, use the following query:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Choose the visualisation as \"Time Series\", and set the metrics to \"scalar_value\". </p><p>In this post, we took a  to setting up observability in a FastAPI app using , covering <strong>logging, distributed tracing, and real-time metrics</strong> with minimal setup.

To make this possible, we need a REST API to handle book data efficiently.</p><p>REST APIs are the backbone of modern web applications, enabling seamless communication between frontend and backend systems. Django REST Framework (DRF) simplifies API development by providing a powerful toolkit built on top of Django. In this guide, we'll build a simple REST API to manage books.</p><p>Before starting this tutorial, you should have:</p><p>✅ Basic understanding of Python programming\n✅ Familiarity with web development concepts<p>\n✅ Python 3.8+ installed on your system</p>\n✅ Basic knowledge of the Django framework<p>\n✅ Understanding of HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)</p>\n✅ Experience using the command-line interface</p><p>By the end of this tutorial, you will be able to:</p><p>✅ Set up a Django REST Framework project from scratch\n✅ Create API endpoints using function-based views (FBVs) and class-based views (CBVs)<p>\n✅ Implement model serialization for JSON responses</p>\n✅ Perform CRUD operations via a REST API<p>\n✅ Test API endpoints using browsable API and cURL commands</p></p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Why Django REST Framework?\n</h3><p>Django REST Framework has become the go-to choice for building APIs with Django because it offers:</p><p>✔️ Powerful serialization capabilities\n✔️ Built-in authentication and permissions<p>\n✔️ Browsable API interface for easy testing</p>\n✔️ Extensive documentation and strong community support<p>\n✔️ Flexible request/response handling</p>\n✔️ Support for pagination, filtering, and throttling</p><p>Let’s start building our REST API step by step.</p><p>Step 1: Environment Setup</p><p>First, create a clean development environment:</p><div><pre><code># Create a project folder\nmkdir book-api &amp;&amp; cd book-api\n\n# Create a virtual environment\npython -m venv venv\n\n# Activate the virtual environment (Windows)\nvenv\\Scripts\\activate\n\n# Activate the virtual environment (Mac/Linux)\nsource venv/bin/activate\n\n# Install Django and Django REST Framework\npip install django djangorestframework\n\n</code></pre></div><p>Now, create a Django project and an app for managing books.</p><div><pre><code># Create a Django project\ndjango-admin startproject bookapi\n\ncd bookapi\n\n# Create a Django app\npython manage.py startapp books\n\n</code></pre></div><p>Register Django REST Framework and the books app in settings.py:</p><div><pre><code>INSTALLED_APPS = [\n    'django.contrib.admin',\n    'django.contrib.auth',\n    'django.contrib.contenttypes',\n    'django.contrib.sessions',\n    'django.contrib.messages',\n    'django.contrib.staticfiles',\n\n    # Third-party apps\n    'rest_framework',\n\n    # Local apps\n    'books',\n]\n\n</code></pre></div><p>Define a Book model in books/models.py:</p><div><pre><code>from django.db import models\n\nclass Book(models.Model):\n    title = models.CharField(max_length=255)\n    author = models.CharField(max_length=255)\n    published_date = models.DateField()\n    isbn = models.CharField(max_length=13, unique=True)\n\n    def __str__(self):\n        return self.title\n</code></pre></div><div><pre><code>python manage.py makemigrations books\npython manage.py migrate\n</code></pre></div><p><strong>Step 5: Serializer Creation</strong></p><p>Create books/serializers.py to handle data conversion:</p><div><pre><code>from rest_framework import serializers\nfrom .models import Book\n\nclass BookSerializer(serializers.ModelSerializer):\n    class Meta:\n        model = Book\n        fields = '__all__'\n</code></pre></div><p>We'll implement both function-based views (FBVs) and class-based views (CBVs).</p><p><strong>Function-Based Views (FBVs)</strong></p><div><pre><code>from rest_framework.response import Response\nfrom rest_framework.decorators import api_view\nfrom .models import Book\nfrom .serializers import BookSerializer\n\n@api_view(['GET'])\ndef book_list(request):\n    books = Book.objects.all()\n    serializer = BookSerializer(books, many=True)\n    return Response(serializer.data)\n\n@api_view(['POST'])\ndef book_create(request):\n    serializer = BookSerializer(data=request.data)\n    if serializer.is_valid():\n        serializer.save()\n        return Response(serializer.data, status=201)\n    return Response(serializer.errors, status=400)\n\n\n</code></pre></div><p>For a more scalable approach, use Django REST Framework’s generic views:</p><div><pre><code>from rest_framework import generics\nfrom .models import Book\nfrom .serializers import BookSerializer\n\nclass BookListCreateView(generics.ListCreateAPIView):\n    queryset = Book.objects.all()\n    serializer_class = BookSerializer\n\n</code></pre></div><p><strong>Step 7: URL Configuration</strong></p><div><pre><code>from django.urls import path\nfrom .views import book_list, book_create, BookListCreateView\n\nurlpatterns = [\n    # Function-based views\n    path('books/', book_list, name='book-list'),\n    path('books/create/', book_create, name='book-create'),\n\n    # Class-based views\n    path('books/cbv/', BookListCreateView.as_view(), name='book-list-cbv'),\n]\n\n</code></pre></div><p>**Update bookapi/urls.py:</p><div><pre><code>from django.contrib import admin\nfrom django.urls import path, include\n\nurlpatterns = [\n    path('admin/', admin.site.urls),\n    path('api/', include('books.urls')),\n]\n\n</code></pre></div><p>Run the server and visit:</p><p><code>📌 http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/books/</code></p><p>Django REST Framework provides an interactive browsable API that allows you to test endpoints without external tools!</p><p>You can also test the API using cURL commands:</p><div><pre><code># GET request\ncurl -X GET http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/books/\n\n# POST request\ncurl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/books/create/ \\\n     -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n     -d '{\"title\": \"Django for Beginners\", \"author\": \"William Vincent\", \"published_date\": \"2021-09-01\", \"isbn\": \"9781735467207\"}'\n</code></pre></div><p><strong>Next Steps: Enhancing Your API</strong></p><p>Now that you have a working API, consider improving it with:\n✔️ Authentication &amp; Permissions (e.g., only authenticated users can add books)<p>\n✔️ Pagination for Large Datasets</p>\n✔️ Filtering &amp; Searching<p>\n✔️ ViewSets &amp; Routers for cleaner URL management</p></p><p>🎉 Congratulations! You have successfully built a simple REST API using the Django REST Framework.

While the documentation is comprehensive, it can be overwhelming to navigate, especially when you're trying to build advanced AI agents.</p><p>This guide is my attempt to consolidate the key concepts and practical implementations of LangGraph in one place. Whether you're building a conversational agent that needs to remember context, a multi-step reasoning agent, or a complex workflow that coordinates multiple AI components, LangGraph provides the framework to make it happen. I created this reference for myself but I hope it helps others who want a more straightforward explanation of how to use LangGraph effectively.</p><p>LangGraph is a framework that brings state machines to Large Language Model (LLM) applications. It's particularly useful when you need to build complex, stateful applications with LLMs. The framework allows you to structure your application as a graph, where each node represents a specific task or state, and edges represent transitions between states.</p><p>Let's start with a simple example to understand the core concepts: we are developing a simple agent that collects information and  processes it, the actions  of collecting and processing information are just fixed actions but they can be replaced with more complex actions.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>This example shows the basic structure of a LangGraph application:</p><ol><li>Define your state using TypedDict, it contains the information that the workflow will need to keep track of.</li><li>Create functions for each state, these functions are the actions that the workflow will perform.</li><li>Build a graph with nodes and edges, the nodes are the states and the edges are the transitions between them.</li><li>Compile the graph into a runnable application, this will create a callable object that can be invoked with an initial state.</li><li>I also added a simple way to save the graph visualization as a PNG file, this will work if you are running this example locally and should save a file that will show the graph structure like below.</li></ol><p>The graph is a good way to understand the workflow, it shows the nodes and the edges between them, the entry and finish points and the state of the workflow.</p><p>This particular example is not very useful but it shows the core concepts of LangGraph, you can simply replace the fixed actions with more complex ones and build a useful agent.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Serving LangGraph as a Web Service\n</h2><p>While LangGraph itself doesn't include built-in server capabilities, you can easily create a web service using <a href=\"https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">FastAPI</a> to serve your LangGraph workflows. Below I have modified the previous example to add a simple FastAPI server that allows you to run the workflow from a web interface.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>You can run this locally or using the <a href=\"https://huggingface.co/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Hugging Face</a> space below, this is the URL to access the swagger API for this example <a href=\"https://jstoppa-langgraph-basic-example-api.hf.space/docs\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://jstoppa-langgraph-basic-example-api.hf.space/docs</a>, the API has an end point to run the agent and it returns the messages we've seen in our previous example (see below the results). In simple words, the API has an end point to run the agent and it returns the messages we've seen in our previous example.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Making it all work with a more interesting example\n</h2><p>We are now going to create a more interesting example, an AI agent that does code reviews, this is far from a production-ready agent but it will give us a better understanding of how to use LangGraph.</p><p>The screenshot below shows the interface for the code review agent, the user can enter a code and the agent will return a report with the code analysis. This interface uses the <a href=\"https://www.gradio.app/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Gradio library</a> to create a simple web interface, this saves a lot of time compared to building a full web app.</p><p>The full code is provided after this but the most impportant part of the example is the graph, it shows the nodes and the edges between them, the entry and finish points and the state of the workflow, this is how the graph will look through the code and analyse the code with different agents that are especialised on different aspects. This is a very similar apporach we've seen in the previous example but it contains more actions and the actions do use LLMs to analyse the code.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>the full code for the agent is below and it can also be found in Hugging Face below.<a href=\"https://huggingface.co/spaces/jstoppa/langgraph_agent_code_reviewer\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fimg.shields.io%2Fbadge%2F%25F0%259F%25A4%2597%2520Run%2520in-Hugging%2520Face-blue\" alt=\"Run example in Hugging Face\" width=\"144\" height=\"20\"></a></p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>LangGraph makes it easier to build AI agents that need to manage complex workflows.

While OpenAI’s GPT models are widely used, many developers want to understand how these models work and even train their own versions from scratch. In this in-depth guide, we will explore how to build a lightweight LLM using Python, train it on Hacker News data, optimize its performance, and deploy it for real-world usage.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  What is a Language Model?\n</h3><p>A Language Model (LM) is a type of artificial intelligence model that predicts the likelihood of a sequence of words in a given language. It learns patterns, grammar, and context from a large corpus of text data, enabling it to generate coherent and contextually relevant text. For example, given the phrase \"I love to code in,\" an LM might predict \"Python\" as the next word, based on patterns observed in its training data.</p><p>LMs are used in various applications, including:</p><ul><li>Text generation: Creating articles, stories, or dialogues.</li><li>Machine translation: Translating text from one language to another.</li><li>Text classification: Sentiment analysis or spam detection.</li><li>Autocomplete: Suggesting words or phrases in search engines or text editors.</li><li>In this article, we'll focus on building a simple autoregressive LM that predicts the next word in a sequence, trained specifically on HackerNews data.</li></ul><ul><li>Understanding how LLMs work</li><li>Collecting and preprocessing Hacker News data</li><li>Tokenizing text and creating structured datasets</li><li>Training a transformer-based model using PyTorch and Hugging Face Transformers</li><li>Fine-tuning and optimizing for better performance</li><li>Evaluating model performance using loss metrics and perplexity</li><li>Deploying the model with FastAPI and making it accessible via an API</li><li>Improving the model with reinforcement learning and knowledge distillation</li><li>Scaling the model with distributed training</li><li>Reducing computational costs through quantization and pruning</li><li>Enhancing model security with adversarial training</li></ul><p>Before we start, install the necessary dependencies:</p><div><pre><code>pip torch transformers datasets tokenizers accelerate fastapi uvicorn matplotlib deepspeed bitsandbytes\n</code></pre></div><ul><li> for deep learning computations</li><li> for leveraging pre-built architectures like GPT-2</li><li> for handling large text corpora efficiently</li><li> for high-speed text processing</li><li> and  for deploying the model as an API</li><li> for visualizing loss curves and performance metrics</li><li> for optimizing large-scale model training</li><li> for quantization to reduce memory footprint</li></ul><h2>\n  \n  \n  Step 1: Understanding Large Language Models\n</h2><p>Before diving into code, it's essential to grasp how LLMs function. At their core, these models are neural networks trained to predict the next word in a sequence given an input context. They use:</p><ul><li> to break text into numerical representations</li><li><strong>Transformer architectures</strong> (such as GPT-2) with attention mechanisms to understand long-range dependencies</li><li> to train on vast amounts of unstructured text data</li><li> to adapt to specific tasks, such as chatbots or code generation</li></ul><h2>\n  \n  \n  Step 2: Collecting Hacker News Data\n</h2><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><h2>\n  \n  \n  Step 3: Preprocessing and Tokenization\n</h2><p>Data cleaning ensures better training results. We remove HTML tags, non-text characters, and normalize text.</p><blockquote><p>Tokenization is the process of breaking down text into smaller units, called tokens, which can be words, subwords or even characters. This step is critical to transforming text into a numerical representation that deep learning models can understand and process.</p></blockquote><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><h2>\n  \n  \n  Step 4: Creating a Dataset and DataLoader\n</h2><p>We format our text for training using PyTorch’s  class.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><h2>\n  \n  \n  Step 5: Training the Transformer Model\n</h2><p>We fine-tune a pre-trained GPT-2 model on our dataset.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><h2>\n  \n  \n  Step 6: Model Optimization\n</h2><p>Model optimization focuses on improving the efficiency of a trained model by reducing its memory usage and increasing its inference speed. Two key techniques used for optimization are:</p><p>Quantization reduces the precision of model parameters (e.g., converting 32-bit floating point numbers to 8-bit integers). This helps decrease memory consumption and speeds up inference, especially on resource-limited devices.\nIn the code, we achieve this using <code>BitsAndBytesConfig(load_in_8bit=True)</code>, which loads the GPT-2 model in an 8-bit format, reducing its size and computational requirements.</p><p>Pruning removes unnecessary parameters from the model, reducing the number of computations required during inference. While pruning is not explicitly implemented in the code, it can be done by eliminating less significant weights from the neural network.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><h2>\n  \n  \n  Step 7: Deploying as an API\n</h2><p>We use FastAPI to make our model accessible.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>We have successfully built, trained, optimized, and deployed a custom LLM using Hacker News data. Future improvements could involve:</p><ul><li>Training on a larger dataset</li><li>Optimizing hyperparameters</li><li>Implementing reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF)</li><li>Deploying in a production-grade environment</li><li>Enhancing security against adversarial attacks</li></ul>","contentLength":4936,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"This Week In Python","url":"https://dev.to/bascodes/this-week-in-python-1gc6","date":1740155047,"author":"Bas Steins","guid":8694,"unread":true,"content":"<p>This Week in Python is a concise reading list about what happened in the past week in the Python universe.</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://github.com/Goldziher/kreuzberg\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">kreuzberg</a> – A text extraction library supporting PDFs, images, office documents and more</li><li><a href=\"https://github.com/kevinpdev/gpt-from-scratch\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">gpt-from-scratch</a> – Educational implementation of a small GPT model from scratch in a single Jupyter Notebook</li><li><a href=\"https://github.com/seemoo-lab/opendrop\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">opendrop</a> – An open Apple AirDrop implementation written in Python</li></ul>","contentLength":373,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"RandomRotation in PyTorch","url":"https://dev.to/hyperkai/randomrotation-in-pytorch-58g","date":1740151517,"author":"Super Kai (Kazuya Ito)","guid":8656,"unread":true,"content":"<ul><li>The 1st argument for initialization is (Required-Type:,  or /( or )):\n*Memos:\n\n<ul><li>It's the range of the degrees  so it must be .</li><li>A tuple/list must be the 1D with 2 elements.</li><li>A single value must be .</li><li>A single value means .</li></ul></li><li>The 2nd argument for initialization is (Optional-Default:<code>InterpolationMode.NEAREST</code>-Type:<a href=\"https://pytorch.org/vision/main/_modules/torchvision/transforms/functional.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">InterpolationMode</a>).</li><li>The 3rd argument for initialization is (Optional-Default:-Type:).</li><li>The 4th argument for initialization is (Optional-Default:-Type:/( or )):\n*Memos:\n\n<ul><li>It can change the center position of an image.</li><li>It must be the 1D with 2 elements.</li></ul></li><li>The 5th argument for initialization is (Optional-Default:-Type:,  or /( or )):\n*Memos:\n\n<ul><li>It can change the background of an image. *The background can be seen when rotating an image.</li><li>A tuple/list must be the 1D with 1 or 3 elements.</li></ul></li><li>The 1st argument is (Required-Type: or ()):\n*Memos:\n\n<ul></ul></li></ul><div><pre><code></code></pre></div>","contentLength":832,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"I Just Found Out You Can Switch Search Engines—Here’s How! 😁","url":"https://dev.to/kihuni/i-just-found-out-you-can-switch-search-engines-heres-how-52g5","date":1740150310,"author":"kihuni","guid":8655,"unread":true,"content":"<p>Hey, 😎 folks!

Java is one of the oldest and most robust programming languages. It is also an object-oriented language mainly used for Android application development. This is one of the main reasons it is still used today. However, with the advent of programming languages ​​like Kotlin (also suitable for Android development), Java is becoming less popular.</p><p>However, Java remains one of the most expensive programming languages ​​and is in great demand. According to Indeed, software developers are interested in Java developers and pay more than $ 100,000 a year.</p><p>Swift iOS application development is currently very popular. Swift is a very stable programming language and worth studying. It’s easier to learn than Java. YouTube has a lot of resources to help you learn, and programming with them is fun. If you’re a freelance developer in Swift now, or if you work for a job related to it, your annual salary can reach $ 115,000.</p><p>SQL or Sequel is a structured search language. Some people think it’s not really a programming language. SQL is mainly used for data management and interactive.

JavaScript is a very popular language. If you check GitHub, you’ll always see new frameworks that support JavaScript. In addition, all browsers support JavaScript. Therefore, learning JavaScript is one of the skills that software development must know. JavaScript developers can earn income in the range of $ 90,000 to $ 113,000.</p><p>According to Google Trends and the PyPI Popularity Index, Python is one of the most popular programming languages ​​in the world and certainly one of the most expensive programming languages. Google was built in Python, and YouTube was also developed in Python.</p><p>The amazing thing about Python is that it’s a general-purpose programming language used to build a wide range of applications. Furthermore, it is active in artificial intelligence. Self-driving cars, Wal-Mart auto-payment, and many automation and machine learning (ML) apps were developed through Python. This makes this language more important and rapidly popularizes. In addition, Python is easier to learn than all other languages ​​and is easy for beginners. You can also build complex applications relatively easily and quickly.

A Beginner’s Guide","url":"https://dev.to/kihuni/what-is-a-restful-api-a-beginners-guide-4hdg","date":1740124827,"author":"kihuni","guid":8439,"unread":true,"content":"<p>In today’s digital world, applications need to communicate seamlessly with each other. Whether you log into a website, check the weather on your phone, or order food online, you're likely interacting with a RESTful API in the background.</p><p>But what exactly is a RESTful API? In this guide, we'll break it down in a simple and digestible way.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  What Does \"RESTful\" Even Mean?\n</h3><p>Let’s start with the basics.</p><p>An API (Application Programming Interface) is a way for different software applications to communicate with each other. Think of it like a waiter in a restaurant:</p><ul><li>You (the client) place an order.</li><li>The waiter (API) takes your request to the kitchen (server).</li><li>The kitchen prepares the food and the waiter brings it back to you.</li></ul><p>In technical terms, an API allows a client (e.g., a web app or mobile app) to request and receive data from a server.</p><p><em>So, What Are RESTful APIs??</em></p><p>REST stands for Representational State Transfer—don’t worry, it’s not as complicated as it sounds! It’s just a set of instructions for how computers and apps should share info over the internet. Think of it like a simple rulebook for keeping their conversations clear and organized.</p><p>A RESTful API is an API that follows these REST rules. It’s like calling a café “specialty” because it makes coffee in a certain way. RESTful APIs have their principles which APIs must follow to qualify as \"RESTFUL APIs\".</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  What Makes an API 'RESTful'\n</h3><p>For an API to be RESTful, it must follow these principles:</p><ol><li><p>Client-Server Architecture – The client (e.g., a mobile app) and server (e.g., a database) remain separate so they can evolve independently.</p></li><li><p>Statelessness – The server does not store client data between requests. Every request contains all the necessary information.</p></li><li><p>Cacheability – Responses can be cached to improve performance.</p></li><li><p>Uniform Interface – Consistent resource naming and use of HTTP methods.</p></li><li><p>Layered System – Requests can pass through intermediaries (e.g., load balancers) without affecting how they function.</p></li></ol><p>RESTful APIs rely on standard HTTP methods to perform actions on resources. Imagine an online payslip system::</p><div><table><thead><tr></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td> (Get payslip with ID 123)</td></tr><tr><td> (Add a new payslip)</td></tr><tr><td> (Update payslip with ID 123)</td></tr><tr><td> (Delete payslip with ID 123)</td></tr></tbody></table></div><p><em>Example API Request (Python)</em></p><p>Here’s a simple Python example using the requests library to fetch a payslip:</p><div><pre><code>import requests\n\nresponse = requests.get(\"https://api.example.com/payslips/123\")\nif response.status_code == 200:\n    print(response.json())\nelse:\n    print(\"Error fetching data\")\n</code></pre></div><p>This request retrieves a payslip from the API and prints the JSON response.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  RESTful APIs vs. Other API Styles\n</h3><ul><li>REST: Uses lightweight JSON or XML over HTTP.</li><li>SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol): More complex, uses XML, and requires additional protocols like WS-Security.</li></ul><ul><li>REST: Fixed endpoints (/users, /orders).</li><li>GraphQL: Allows flexible queries, fetching only necessary data</li></ul><h3>\n  \n  \n  Authentication in RESTful APIs\n</h3><p>APIs often require authentication to protect sensitive data. Common methods include:</p><ul><li>API Keys – Unique keys assigned to users.</li><li>OAuth 2.0 – Secure authorization protocol used by platforms like Google and GitHub.</li><li>JWT (JSON Web Tokens) – Tokens used for secure authentication between client and server.</li></ul><p>Example authentication using a Bearer Token:</p><div><pre><code>headers = {\"Authorization\": \"Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN\"}\nresponse = requests.get(\"https://api.example.com/payslips/123\", headers=headers)\nprint(response.json())\n</code></pre></div><p>RESTful APIs are a clever and organized way for apps and computers to share stuff over the internet. They use simple ideas like resources (think of them as items they’re working with), HTTP methods (like “get” or “send”), and web addresses (called URIs), plus some cool tricks like not remembering past chats (statelessness) and saving info for later (caching). All of this keeps things fast and smooth. Whether you’re creating payslips or playing music on an app, RESTful APIs are quietly making it happen every day.</p><p>Next time you’re using an app, think about the RESTful magic working behind the scenes—it’s pretty awesome! If you’re curious, try playing with a free API (like a <a href=\"https://openweathermap.org/api\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">weather API</a>—it’s a fun way to start!).</p>","contentLength":4179,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Talk Python to Me: #494: Update on Flet: Python + Flutter UIs","url":"https://talkpython.fm/episodes/show/494/update-on-flet-python-flutter-uis","date":1740124800,"author":"","guid":8782,"unread":true,"content":"<article>As Python developers, we're incredibly lucky to have over half a million packages that we can use to build our applications with over at PyPI.

If you're passionate about storytelling and want to bring your ideas to life through a visual medium, learning Ren'Py is a great first step.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.renpy.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Ren'Py</a> is a free and open-source engine that simplifies visual novel development. Whether you're an aspiring writer, artist, or programmer, Ren'Py provides all the tools you need to create professional-quality visual novels without requiring extensive technical knowledge.</p><p>In this article, we'll explore why Ren'Py is the perfect tool for beginners, the key concepts you need to learn, and how you can accelerate your journey with the right resources.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  1. Why Choose Ren'Py for Your Visual Novel Projects?\n</h2><p>Ren'Py has earned its place as the go-to tool for many visual novel developers, and for good reason. Here’s why it’s the best option for beginners:</p><p> Ren'Py uses a simple, Python-based scripting language that is easy to learn, even if you have no programming experience. Despite its simplicity, Ren'Py offers a wide range of features, such as branching narratives, interactive elements, character animations, and more. You can easily tweak Ren'Py to suit your needs, whether you’re a beginner or an advanced user. Ren'Py has a supportive community of developers, writers, and artists who share their knowledge, assets, and advice.\nIf you’re serious about creating high-quality visual novels, Ren'Py provides the perfect balance of simplicity and flexibility.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  2. Key Concepts to Understand in Ren'Py\n</h2><p>Learning Ren'Py can seem overwhelming at first, but once you break it down, it’s not as difficult as it seems. Here are some essential concepts you’ll need to grasp to get started:</p><p>Ren'Py’s scripting language is simple and intuitive. To create a scene, you’ll write commands that define the characters, backgrounds, and dialogue. For example:</p><div><pre><code>label start:\n    scene bg room\n    show char1 happy\n    \"Welcome to my visual novel!\"\n</code></pre></div><p>This basic script shows how easy it is to get started with Ren'Py. The syntax is straightforward, allowing you to focus on writing the story rather than wrestling with complex code.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Creating Characters &amp; Backgrounds\n</h3><p>You’ll need to create character sprites and backgrounds to bring your story to life. Ren'Py makes it easy to display images and manage character emotions or poses:</p><p>This line will show char1 with a sad expression. You can swap out different images, backgrounds, and even animate characters, adding life to your narrative.</p><p>Choice Menus and Branching Narratives\nOne of Ren'Py’s strongest features is its ability to let players make choices that impact the story. With a simple menu command, you can create branching paths for the player to follow:</p><div><pre><code>menu:\n    \"Go left\":\n        jump left_path\n    \"Go right\":\n        jump right_path\n</code></pre></div><p>This simple choice mechanic adds replayability and depth to your visual novel.</p><p>Ren'Py offers a variety of transitions and visual effects, like fades, wipes, and custom animations. This is where you can start adding some flair to your visual novel, creating smooth scene changes or dramatic visual effects.</p><p>For example, to fade out a scene, you can use:</p><p>This creates a smoother transition between scenes, enhancing the overall experience.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Interactivity &amp; Minigames\n</h3><p>You can also incorporate minigames into your visual novel, providing an interactive element beyond the traditional choices. For example, in my own project, I developed a puzzle mini-game, where players could engage with the game to unlock new parts of the story.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  3. Resources to Accelerate Your Learning\n</h2><p>While Ren'Py is beginner-friendly, the best way to learn is by combining hands-on experience with structured learning. There are many great resources to help you along the way:</p><p> The official Ren'Py Documentation is the best place to start. It covers everything from basic scripting to advanced features. The Ren'Py forums are filled with tips, tutorials, and code snippets from experienced developers.<strong>Tutorial Blogs and YouTube Channels:</strong> There are numerous free tutorials online, many of which provide step-by-step guides to help you create your first visual novel.</p><p>If you’re looking for a more structured approach, I’ve created a comprehensive Udemy course titled <a href=\"https://www.udemy.com/course/mastering-renpy-create-visual-novels-like-a-pro/?referralCode=9A4732B0C1A919F10AA6&amp;couponCode=ST3MT200225B\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Mastering Ren'Py: Create Visual Novels Like a Pro</a>. In this course, I cover everything from the basics to advanced techniques like creating custom screens, implementing animations, and designing minigames. It's a one-stop resource for anyone serious about mastering Ren'Py.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  4. Common Mistakes Beginners Make (and How to Avoid Them)\n</h2><p>Even the most experienced developers make mistakes, but the good news is that you can avoid common pitfalls by learning from others. Here are a few mistakes beginners often make and how to avoid them:</p><p><strong>Overcomplicating the Story:</strong> While it’s tempting to have a complex plot with endless branching, it’s better to start with a simple story. Focus on making each choice meaningful and impactful. It’s easy to get lost in a pile of code. Make sure to organize your scripts properly and comment on your code to avoid confusion later on. Testing is crucial. Playtest your visual novel frequently to catch bugs or awkward pacing before it’s too late.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  5. Tips for Creating an Engaging Visual Novel\n</h2><p>Now that you understand the basics, here are a few tips to make your visual novel stand out:</p><p>Great visual novels are driven by compelling stories. Develop deep, relatable characters and create an engaging narrative that keeps the player invested. The power of a visual novel lies in its ability to connect emotionally with players.</p><p>Visual novels rely heavily on artwork and music to set the tone. Good visuals and sound can elevate your storytelling to new heights. Whether you're an artist or working with a team, make sure your assets complement your story.</p><p>Once you have the basic structure of your visual novel, go back and refine it. Customize the user interface, add smooth transitions, and tweak the audio to create a more polished experience.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  6. How Long Does It Take to Learn Ren'Py?\n</h2><p>How long it takes to learn Ren'Py depends on your prior experience and how much time you can dedicate to learning. If you’re starting from scratch, expect to spend a few weeks getting comfortable with the basics. However, with dedicated effort, you can create a simple visual novel within a month.</p><p>For those who want to accelerate their learning, my <a href=\"https://www.udemy.com/course/mastering-renpy-create-visual-novels-like-a-pro/?referralCode=9A4732B0C1A919F10AA6&amp;couponCode=ST3MT200225B\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Udemy course</a> is designed to help you get up to speed quickly.

Essentially, it’s a mutex that ensures only one thread executes Python bytecode at a time, protecting internal data structures—especially the reference counting used by the garbage collector—from race conditions. .</p><p>Excitingly, Python 3.13 is the first release featuring an experimental build mode that disables the GIL, opening the door to significant performance improvements for multi-threaded applications.</p><p>Before discussing these new changes, let’s do a quick recap of the pros and cons of the GIL.</p><p>The GIL offers several advantages, including:</p><ul><li><strong>Simplified Memory Management</strong>: By blocking threads from concurrently modifying an object’s reference count, the GIL prevents race conditions and ensures the garbage collector doesn’t free an object while it’s still referenced, making the core implementation simpler and more robust.</li><li><strong>Ease of C Extension Integration</strong>: Many C libraries and extensions, which are not inherently thread-safe, can be used safely under the GIL’s protection.</li><li><strong>Single-thread Performance</strong>: Since CPython uses reference counting for memory management, the garbage collector has minimal impact compared to mark-and-sweep algorithms used in languages - ex: Java -, which can be unpredictable and cause pauses.</li></ul><p>But if only one thread can use the interpreter at a given time, how does Python run multiple threads?</p><p>Thread switching is a complex topic; even the interpreter doesn’t always decide which thread runs next, as the operating system also influences scheduling. In this blog, we will focus solely on the Python side of thread management.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  what happens when a thread holds the GIL?\n</h3><p>When a thread holds the GIL, it may encounter one of the following scenarios:</p><ul><li>If it reaches an I/O task, the thread willingly releases the lock while waiting, allowing other threads to run.</li><li>During CPU-intensive operations, the lock is automatically released after a defined timeout (typically 5ms).</li></ul><p>Now that we understand how thread switching works, it’s clear that one of the main downsides of the GIL is limited true multi-threaded parallelism in CPU-bound programs. Removing the GIL requires a solution that grants safe, concurrent access to objects and memory management without compromising single-thread performance.</p><p>Sam Gross, the author of <a href=\"https://peps.python.org/pep-0703/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">PEP 703</a>, has proposed an ingenious solution to remove the GIL from CPython while ensuring thread safety. The proposal rethinks CPython’s memory management and introduces three key techniques:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Biased Reference Counting</strong>:\nMany objects are primarily modified by a single thread, so biased reference counting lets that thread update an object’s reference count without atomic overhead. If another thread intervenes, the system safely falls back to slower, thread-safe operations—optimizing the common single-threaded case.</p></li><li><p><strong>Deferred Reference Counting</strong>:\nFor objects like top-level functions, code objects, modules, and methods that are accessed concurrently, deferred reference counting postpones immediate atomic updates. It batches reference count changes to reduce contention, thereby minimizing overhead for dynamic objects that aren’t immortal.</p></li><li><p>:\nCertain objects—such as interned strings, small integers, PyTypeObjects, and the True, False, and None—live for the duration of the program. These are marked as immortal (their reference count is set to UINT32_MAX), so Py_INCREF and Py_DECREF become no-ops, avoiding contention when accessed by multiple threads.</p></li></ul><p>Together, these techniques pave the way for enhanced parallelism and a more efficient, concurrent CPython.</p><p>From the Steering Council’s notice about the adoption of PEP 703:</p><blockquote><ul><li>:\nWe will add the no-GIL build as an experimental build mode, presumably in Python 3.13 (if it slips to 3.14, that is not a problem). The build mode is experimental to clarify that, although the core developers support it, we cannot expect the community to adopt it immediately. We need time to determine the necessary changes in API design, packaging, and distribution, and we want to discourage distributors from shipping the experimental no-GIL build as the default interpreter.</li><li>:\nOnce there is sufficient community support for production use of no-GIL, we will support the no-GIL build—but not as the default—while setting a target date or Python version for making it the default. This timing will depend on factors such as backward compatibility of API changes (e.g., the stable ABI) and the remaining work identified by the community. We expect this phase to take at least a year or two, possibly more. Some distributors may start shipping no-GIL by default, though this will vary with package support.</li><li>:\nOur goal is for no-GIL to become the default, eventually removing any vestiges of the GIL without unnecessarily breaking backward compatibility. We do not want to maintain two common build modes indefinitely, as this can double testing resources and debugging efforts. However, the transition cannot be rushed and may take as much as five years.</li></ul></blockquote><p>The move to remove the GIL marks a major evolution in CPython’s design. By rethinking memory management with biased and deferred reference counting, plus immortal objects, PEP 703 offers a practical path to better multi-threaded performance without losing single-thread efficiency. As Python gradually shifts toward a no-GIL future, we can look forward to an interpreter that’s more capable on today’s multi-core systems.</p>","contentLength":5509,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"## Master Django Redirects in Under 3 Minutes 🚀","url":"https://dev.to/ebereplenty/-master-django-redirects-in-under-3-minutes-4f6","date":1740082395,"author":"NJOKU SAMSON EBERE","guid":7422,"unread":true,"content":"<p>Django provides a powerful way to redirect users from one page to another using the  function.

That little snippet of code at the top of the script is like a preamble, a clearing of the throat before the real business begins. What purpose does it serve? Well, the header is a kind of introduction, letting the reader know what's to come with some basic information.</p><blockquote><p><em>Let the Code be governed by a singular, mighty function</em></p></blockquote><p>Ah, the main() function - now there's a topic! It's like the heart and soul of your code, the place where everything comes together. See, when you're working on a code project, it's like you're building a big machine, right? And the main() function, well, that's the control panel, the place where you pull all the levers and push all the buttons to make the whole thing rock. In order to use that machine, you gotta follow a certain set of steps right? Turn the key, check the fuel, prime the pump.. Well, that's what the main() function is all about - it's the sequence of events that gets your code up and running.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  The parameters, guardians of function\n</h3><blockquote><p><em>Each one a gatekeeper, ensuring the proper flow of information.</em></p></blockquote><p>Parameters are those little vessels that carry the lifeblood of our functions.\nNow, I know what you're thinkin' - \"But George, how do I know which one to use?\" Well, my friend, it all comes down to the task at hand.<p>\nIf you're dealing with a relatively simple setup like here, them variables-as-parameters might be just the ticket you need. But if you're working on somethin' a little more complex, with all sorts of moving parts and interdependencies, well, them classes, they're the way to go. Classes, are the real MVPs of the bunch, and they will help keeping everything organized and running smooth as silk.</p></p><h3>\n  \n  \n  The docstrings, the illuminating scrolls\n</h3><blockquote><p><em>Where the function's purpose, its workings, and its returns are documented.</em></p></blockquote><p>Alright, people, let me tell you about these things called docstrings. Now, I know what you're thinking - \"Docstrings? What in the Sam Hill are those?\" Let me break it down for you.\nThese docstrings, they're like little notes, little snippets of information that you tack on to your code, just to give folks a heads up on what's going on. It's like when you're doing some work around the house, and you leave a little note for the neighbour, just to let ‘em know what you're up to.<p>\nNow, these docstrings, they come in all shapes and sizes. But the way I see it, these docstrings, they're not just about the code, no sir. They're about the people too. So, when you write one of these things, you're not just explaining what the code does, you're telling a story. You're givin' people a little glimpse into your mind and your thought process. And this makes </p> difference because on bigger projects, we all know you will never code alone.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Type hints as vigilant sentinels\n</h3><blockquote><p><em>Ensuring the integrity of the data.</em></p></blockquote><p>Listen up, I'm about to let you in on a little secret when it comes to this Python business. It's all about them type hints, they're guardrails that keep you from taking a wrong turn by telling your fellow programmers, \"hey, this is what I'm expecting here, so don't go messing it up, y'hear?\"\nSee, these type hints, they're some kind of guardians of your program, keeping a watchful eye to make sure you don't go trying to mix apples and oranges, so to speak. When you're dealing with a language as flexible as Python, that's a darn good thing to have in your corner.

In the realm of the browser, a puppet is forged\n</h3><blockquote><p>Where the mighty browser is bound to our will, as if by sorcery.</p></blockquote><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>First up, we've got this  business. Now, I know what you're thinking - \"George, what in the world is a driver service?\" Well, let me tell you, it's the piece of code that's gonna make this whole Selenium thing work. It's like a bridge between our script and the middleman, I name the ! And after that service is up, the gecko’s gonna turn our Firefox into a nice .\nAnd where do we get this driver service, you ask? From the , of course! That's the path to the executable that's gonna make Firefox dance to our tune. Do you know what else it's gonna do? It's gonna log everything that's happening, right into the  file. That way, if anything goes sideways, we can take a peek under the hood and see why’s that.\nNow, the options. See, we're creating a shiny new set of , and we're gonna deck them out with some goodies. First up, we're pointing it to the , making sure we've got the right browser to work with.\nAnd then, if that  variable is set to True, we're gonna add a little  argument to the mix. That means the browser's gonna run without a visible window, stealthier than your average ninja. No need for all the bells and whistles (and windows), we're just here to get the job done, right?\nAnd finally, we're wrapping it all up by returning a brand-spankin' new instance of the , complete with our custom service and options. This one's like a well-oiled machine, and we're the ones behind the wheel.\nJust remember: if you ever find yourself scratching your head, wondering what in the world is going on, just take a peek at that  file. It's like a crystal ball, and it might tell you everything you need to know.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  II. The opening of the file\n</h3><blockquote><p>Like an ancient tome unveiling its secrets.</p></blockquote><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Alright, folks, gather 'round, because we're about to dive into some more of this code. Now, this right here, this is the kind of stuff that separates the wheat from the chaff.\nFirst up, we've got this  block. Now, I know what you're thinking: \"George, what in the world is a  block?\" Well, let me tell you, it's the statement that’s gonna keep us from running headfirst into a brick wall every time something goes wrong. And trust me, in the universe of programming, something's always going wrong.\nSee, what we're doing here is we're trying to open a file, right? And we're using this fancy-schmancy  function to do it. And that's where the  block comes in.\nIf everything goes according to plan, and the file is there, waiting for us with open arms, we're gonna read the contents and hand 'em back, no problem.  \"But George, what could possibly go wrong?\" Well, my friends, the world is a cruel and unpredictable place ( when you’re learning software development), and sometimes, those files, they just up and disappear. But don't you worry, we've got a plan and that's where the  block comes in.\nIf that  rears its ugly head, we're gonna print out a nice, friendly message, letting the user know that the file they were looking for is.. not there..\nIt's like a safety net, a way to keep the wheels from falling off even when the road gets a little bumpy. And you know what they say, \"the more you plan for the unexpected, the less unexpected it becomes.\" Or something like that.. I don't know, I'm just making it up as I go along.</p><p>Anyway, the point is when life hands you lemons, you make lemonade. And when life hands you , you just smile ;)</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  III. Sentence splitting action unleashed\n</h3><blockquote><p>The fellowship of words is broken.</p></blockquote><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Okay, listen up, because we're about to dive into some serious sentence-splitting action.\nNow, you might be looking at this line of code and thinking: \"what in the world is going on here?\" Well, let me tell you, it's a thing of beauty: we're taking this text that we've been handed, and we're gonna break it down into its individual sentences.<p>\nAnd how are we doing it, you ask? With the power of regular expressions (</p>) and its  implementation, that's how. \"But George, what's a regular expression?\" Well, my friends, it's a language all its own, a way of describing patterns in ways that would make your head spin. You can tinker with it <a href=\"https://regex101.com/r/rsVgaP/1\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">here</a>.\nBut don't worry, we're not gonna get too deep into the weeds here. All you need to know is that this little regular expression is the key to our success. It's gonna look for those periods, question marks, and exclamation marks, and it's gonna use them as the boundaries to split our text into individual sentences. But careful, this regex has its limits, see, every language is like a delicate little dance, with each word and phrase movin' in perfect harmony. Some Pros, they’re like aware of that more than us so they built up nice little tools using carefully crafted and more accurate natural language processing (NLP)  formulas (for example you can experiment with the <a href=\"https://www.nltk.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">nltk</a> library). For the sake of simplicity, let’s stick to the basics with the regex way.</p><p>The next time you find yourself staring at a wall of text, wondering how in the world you're gonna make sense of it all, just remember this little line of code and no more trying to figure out where one sentence ends and the next one begins. And who knows, maybe one day, you'll be the one writing the regular expressions turning chaos of strings into order.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  IV. The forging of the chunks\n</h3><blockquote><p>The awakening of mighty blocks of text.</p></blockquote><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Hmm, we're about to dive into some serious text-chunking action now. You see, we've got this text that we need to translate, but we can't just send the whole thing off to the translation service all at once. Nah, that would be way too easy. Instead, we've gotta break it down into manageable chunks, little bite-sized pieces that the service can handle without breaking a sweat. That's where this  function comes in handy. It's like a master chef, carefully slicing and dicing the text, making sure each piece is the perfect size.\nFirst, we set up a little , a fancy data structure that's gonna help us keeping track of the current chunk.</p><blockquote><p>A , that's just a  way of saying double-ended queue, obviously we deal with small amounts of data here but I wanted to give a try to this exotic thing. Your less sophisticated arrays would work fine there too. Just remember that usual  and  methods don’t perform fast on items on the opposite side of the line. So Python’s  module provides that class called deque that’s specially designed to provide fast and memory-efficient ways to append and pop item from both ends.</p></blockquote><p>And then, we start looping through the sentences of the \"text\" block  (we provided it as an argument when we called the function), and for each sentence, we're gonna figure out its length, -including the space character at the end.\nNow, you might be wondering, \"But George, how do you know when to start a new chunk?\" Well, my friends, it's all about that  variable and the one called  that we use as a counter to keep a running tally of the length of the current chunk. If the current sentence is gonna fit within the chunk size character limit, well, we're just gonna add it on and update the chunk length accordingly. That’s the normal way to go. Got it?\nNow, if the length of the current sentence, plus the length of the chunk we've got so far, pushes us  the character limit we've set, well, we're gonna do a few things. First, we're gonna take all the sentences in the chunk and join 'em up with spaces, and then we're gonna yield that beasty. That just means we're gonna spit it out and move on to a new chunk.\nMoving on to the next chunk means we're gonna clear out the chunk variable and start fresh, adding the current sentence to it and resetting the chunk length to just the length of that sentence, and then, just like before, we’ll keep rolling until we hit the limit again.<p>\nFinally, after we've gone through all the sentences, we're gonna yield the last chunk, if there is one.</p></p><p>That’s it for our symphony of text-chunking perfection. And who knows.. maybe you'll even find yourself singing the praises of them deques and character limits soon.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  V. Print statements illuminate the path\n</h3><blockquote><p>The chronicles of progress are Written.</p></blockquote><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Alright, but George, why do we need all these print statements? Isn't the script just supposed to, you know, just work?\"\nWell see, we've got this script that's doing all sorts of stuff, translating text and whatnot. But how are we supposed to know if it's working, huh? That's where these print statements come in, my friends, they're like the canaries in the coal mine. They're the early warning system that's gonna deal us some intel to let us know something's gone awry.<p>\nWe're gonna print out the length of the input text. Because let's be real, how are we supposed to know if this thing is working if we don't know how much text we're dealing with, am I right? It's like trying to bake a cake without knowing how much flour you've got. There's more.. We're also gonna print out the number of chunks that the script has generated. And to top it all off, we're gonna print out the length of each of those chunks. Because, honestly, who doesn't love a good old-fashioned character count? It's like a little treasure hunt, but instead of finding gold, we're finding out how many letters are in each sentence.</p>\nA little  for when you will be contributing to bigger projects: there is that other breed of statements called . They're the quiet ones, they slip in the back door and get the job done without all the fanfare of the print. Just keep in mind they're the ones that keep a careful  when things start to get a little hairy.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  VI. The sorcery of the selectors\n</h3><blockquote><p>Their spell cast the way.</p></blockquote><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Now it’s time to jump into some serious Selenium wizardry.</p><p><a href=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2F582dkzvjknbphi4nxa9m.png\"><img src=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2F582dkzvjknbphi4nxa9m.png\" title=\"A screenshot showing the input field of deepL's website.\" alt=\"DeepL website's input field\" width=\"800\" height=\"336\"></a><em>The input field our marionette will search for.</em>\nYou see, we've got this input field that we need to find on the web page, and we can't just go barging in there, hoping it'll be there. Instead, we've gotta harness the power of Selenium, which is gonna help us navigate this digital bytescape.<p>\nTo understand this whole pasta here, We need to know more about’em selectors. See, when you're coding a website, just like a building, you got all sorts of elements fitting together - your headings, your paragraphs, buttons, an' the like. Each one of those elements, it's got its own little personality, just like a set of traits and characteristics. And to identify them, you can use all sorts of different selectors:  element selectors, class selectors, ID selectors, and many more other lads. Find out more </p><a href=\"https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/trysel.php\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">here</a>.</p><p>That's where this <code>get_input_textarea_element()</code> function comes in. It's like a secret agent, carefully scanning the page, looking for that elusive  where you insert the text you want to translate.\nBut there’s a challenge to it: what's the point of finding the input field if it's not even ready for us to use? So first, we create a  object, and we instruct it to wait for up to  seconds (we've set it at the beginning as a parameter, by the way) for the element to be loaded and clickable thanks to this intriguing <code>EC.element_to_be_clickable()</code> thing that tells Selenium exactly what we're looking for. In this case, we're saying, \"Hey, Selenium, find me an element that's clickable, and it's gotta match this . But.. how did I found that damn selector we've got here? Well, invoke the inspector by hitting  in Firefox. Then try the  combo, point &amp; clic your target and in the inspector you'll be able to right clic the highlighted piece of code and extract its info.</p><p>Concretely we’re looking to mimic human behavior just like when you paste your first chunk of text. Let’s break it down again:</p><ul><li>You select the input field by clicking on it (it’s selected).</li><li>Depending of your laziness level, either you start typing or you just paste some text into that area.</li></ul><p>Well, our driver should be instructed to do the same.\nNow, I know what you're thinking, \"But George, what if the element never becomes clickable? What then?\" Well, friends, that's where the  comes to the rescue. If the element doesn't become clickable within the  period, the whole thing is gonna throw an exception, and we'll know that something's gone wrong. Maybe the website has been updated and our old CSS selector pal is no more, or a networking problem occured somewhere. Whatever.\nIf everything goes according to plan, and Selenium manages to find that input field and confirm that it's ready for us to use, well, that's when the wonder happens. We're gonna return that element, and the rest of the script is gonna be able to work its magic.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  VII. The bridge of translation is crossed\n</h3><blockquote><p>Meaning is conveyed across the void.</p></blockquote><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Alright, friends, gather 'round, because we're about to witness the main event, the grand finale and the moment you've all been waiting for - the translation process! Now, I know what you're thinking, \"But George, how in the world is this script gonna take all those chunks of text and turn them into a beautiful translation?\" Well, my friends, watch out.</p><p>First, we're gonna set up an empty list called . Our little treasure trove of linguistic gold. This is where we're gonna store all the translated chunks.\nAnd then, we're gonna start looping through those chunks, one by one. Now, I know what you're thinking, \"But George, how are we gonna keep track of which chunk we're on?\" Well, that's where the  function comes in, my friends. It's gonna give us the  of each chunk, so we can keep tabs on our progress.\nAs we loop through each chunk, we're gonna print out a little separator, just to let the user know that we're hard at work. And then, we're gonna send that chunk of text to the input field, using the  method. It's like we're typing the text over to the translation service, saying, \"Here, take a look at this! A new text chunk for you to translate.\"\nBut we can't just sit back and wait, oh no, that would be way too easy. Instead, we're gonna print out a little message, letting the user know that we're fetching the translation. And then, we're gonna hit the  function, giving the translation service some time to achieve its task.\nWhen the time is up, we're gonna use Selenium again to find the output area on the web page, and we're gonna grab the text that's been translated by now. We're talking about pure algorithmic alchemy, folks, turning one language into another with the click of a button. The thing there is just that we’re not behind the wheels anymore.<p>\nSo once we've put our hands on that translated chunk, we're gonna append it to our translation list. And then, just to be on the safe side, we're gonna clear out the input field, making sure we're ready for the next chunk.</p>\nWhen we've gone through all the chunks, and collected all those translated gems, we're gonna return the whole  list  which is the result of all the translations we’ve collected.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  VIII. The file is written\n</h3><blockquote><p>The chronicle of the realm is inscribed.</p></blockquote><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>The last step starts by calling , and let me tell you, it's one of the unsung hero of this whole operation. Because, let's be honest, what's the point of all this translation process if we can't actually, you know, save the results somewhere?\nSo, here's how it works. First, we're gonna open up a file, using that  statement. And let me tell you, that , it's like a handshake that tells Python, \"Hey, I'm about to do some serious file-handling business, so don't you dare interrupt me!\" And what are we gonna do with this file, you ask? Well, my friends, we're gonna write some text to it. But not just any text, oh no, we're talking about the fruits of our labor, the translated chunks that we've been slaving over for who knows how long.\nNow, I know what you're thinking, \"But George, how are we gonna get all those chunks into the file?\" Well, that's where the  function comes in. It's like a magic wand, taking our list of translated chunks and turning them into a cohesive piece of writing. When that file finally gets saved, it's gonna be all those chunks of text, neatly packaged up into a tangible reality: a file!\nBut you know, it's not just about the end result, folks. It's about the journey, the process of getting there. And this  function, was the final step in that journey. A cherry on top, mic drop moment that says, \"We did it, folks, we translated the heck out of that text!\"</p><ul><li>Managing files (<em>loading a source file and writing results into another one</em>).</li><li>Witnessing that the true sorcery of this tutorial lies in the automated process of translating a text by <em>splitting it into sentences</em>, stacking them into  sent one by one to the <em>online translation service</em>, through Selenium, without ever exceeding a </li><li>And the <a href=\"https://dev.to/atomictangerline/basic-selenium-bonus-41dp\">goodies</a>: raise a glass to the coder's toolkit, by implementing some good practices <em>(using a header, organizing the code using functions, parameters and a main(), use docstrings and type hints)</em>.</li></ul><p>That's just the beginning, isn't it?

The possibilities, they're practically endless, my friends. <strong>So I want you to take this code, tinker with it, experiment, see what else you can make it do</strong>. You’re ready to go.\nTry it out on different translation services, see how it handles the variations. Heck, see if you can make it do your taxes while you're at it (okay, maybe not that, but you get the idea). The point is, this is tip of the iceberg. So, what are you waiting for?

Well, functions, they make your code a whole lot easier to read and understand. I mean, think about it: instead of trying to decipher a tangled web of spaghetti code, you got these nice, neat little packages that do one thing and do it well. And when you need to make a change, well, you just gotta tweak the function, and b-a-m, problem solved. No muss, no fuss.</p><p> Embrace 'em, you love 'em. Trust me, your future self is gonna thank you for it.</p></blockquote><p>First, let's have a look at this  version of the main function:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><h3>\n  \n  \n  The Initialization of the Browser\n</h3><blockquote><p><em>In which the Selenium-forged steed is summoned, and the journey begins.</em></p></blockquote><p>First, we've got the  function.

No need for a window to appear, we're going full stealth mode here.</p><blockquote><p><em>Where the words are divided into manageable chunks, as if by the wisdom of the regex.</em></p></blockquote><p>Next, we've got . This one's pretty straightforward - it's just reading the contents of a file and handing us back the text.\nThen there's <code>split_text_into_sentences()</code>. This is where the script takes that input text and breaks it down into individual sentences. Gotta make sure we're not overwhelming the translation service, you know? Bite-sized chunks are the way to go.\nAnd speaking of those chunks, that's where  comes in. It's taking those sentences and slicing them, making sure each sentence-block is small enough to play nice with the translation service. No more hitting character limits.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  The Gathering of the Fields\n</h3><blockquote><p><em>In which the input field is sought and found.</em></p></blockquote><p>Now, the real showstoppers: <code>get_input_textarea_element()</code>. This is the function that use Selenium to find the right spot on the web page to do our work. I mean the input field, where we're gonna pour in our text. Without it, no circus troupe at your fingertips, ready to leap through hoops an' do backflips at your every whim.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  The Fetching of the Results\n</h3><blockquote><p><em>The final step, where the fruits of the labors are harvested and the story ends.</em></p></blockquote><p>Finally, we've got  and .

Step by step, we're gonna peel back the layers of that machine where each piece is fitting in like a puzzle.

Whatever got you tied up in knots, this is your chance to untangle it and make it sing.</p><blockquote><p>\"Time to get this thing installed and ready to rock.\"</p></blockquote><p>First things first - you're gonna need to clone or download the source code. The repository is online <a href=\"https://github.com/brooks-code/special-octo-telegram\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">here</a>. Don't worry, I'll wait.</p><p>If you don't already have Firefox on your system, you're gonna need to get that taken care of.

It’s not covered here so if you really want it that way, it’s this way <a href=\"https://developer.chrome.com/docs/chromedriver/get-started\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">there</a>.</p></blockquote><p>Next, we've got some packages to install. Nothing too crazy, but we gotta make sure we've got all the tools ready to roll. So fire up that trusty old pip and run:</p><div><pre><code>pip  requirements.txt\n</code></pre></div><p>Boom.

But trust me, it's worth it. Once you've got all that squared away, you're gonna be almost ready to start automating like never before.</p><p>Alright, folks, time to dive into the nitty-gritty of this configuration stuff. Because let me tell you, if you don't get this part right, the whole thing's gonna be about as useful as.. a lawn mower in the middle of the Mojave.\nFirst up, we've got those  and  variables. Now, I know what you're thinking - \"But how in the world am I supposed to know where these things are hiding on my system?\" Well, fellas, depending on the one you’re looking for, there's a little bash command you can run to ferret that out:</p><p>About the Gecko.. Remember that installation process we went through earlier? Well, the path you set up there is the one you'll want to use here. Not sure about it? No problem, same sauce, Just run:</p><p>And Zap! Paste that info into the right place. Easy, right?\nNow, the  parameter - this one's a bit of a wild card. See, you can run this whole thing in headless mode, which means the browser will run and do its job but won't actually show up on your screen. Kinda like a ninja, you know? But if you want to see what's going on, and watch your Firefox acting like possessed by a spirit you can set it to  and watch the magic unfold – try and see.</p><p>As for the  and , well, pretty self-explanatory. Just pick the languages you want to translate to (source) and from (output), and the script will handle the rest. If you're looking to learn a little more about the available languages, take a glance at that readme file in the repository <a href=\"https://github.com/brooks-code/special-octo-telegram/blob/main/README.md\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">here</a>.\nLast but not least, we've got the , , and .

Tinker with them as needed, but be careful - you don't want to break the whole machine.\nThe  and  - those are the ones you'll want to point to your own input and output files. Simple enough, right? Just make sure you're pointing the input to something that actually contains text, because that's what this script is built to handle.\nNow, a quick word of warning – the script is not perfect - if the output file doesn't exist yet, the script's gonna go ahead and create it for you. But if it does exist, well, buckle up, because the script's gonna overwrite it every time you run it. So, you know, maybe keep an eye on that (and specify a different output each time) if you don’t want to see your previous achievements disappear..</p><blockquote><p>Wait.. I almost forgot..
