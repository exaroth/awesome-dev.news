The root cause? A  object, used to track feature flag exposure, silently overflowed its maximum value due to an unexpected surge in traffic. This wasn’t a simple integer overflow; it was a consequence of using a naive implementation of a counter within a heavily concurrent, async environment. The incident highlighted a critical truth: even the most basic data structures require careful consideration when deployed at scale. This post dives deep into the world of  in Python, moving beyond the basics to explore its nuances in production systems, focusing on performance, reliability, and best practices.

What is \"Counter\" in Python?\n</h3><p>The  class, found in the  module, is a specialized dictionary subclass designed for counting hashable objects.  It’s not defined by a PEP directly, but its functionality is well-documented (<a href=\"https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html#collections.Counter\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html#collections.Counter</a>).  Internally, it leverages a standard Python dictionary to store element counts.  However, it provides convenient methods like , , and arithmetic operations for combining counters.</p><p>From a typing perspective,  is generic: , where  is the type of the hashable objects being counted.  This type hinting is crucial for static analysis with .  While the CPython implementation is efficient for many use cases, it’s important to understand its limitations, particularly regarding concurrency and potential overflow issues with the underlying integer representation.</p><p>Here are several production scenarios where  proves invaluable:</p><ul><li><strong>FastAPI Request Rate Limiting:</strong>  We use  to track requests per user within a sliding window.  This allows us to enforce rate limits and prevent abuse.  The  is reset periodically by an async task.</li><li><strong>Async Job Queue Monitoring:</strong>  In a Celery-based system,  tracks the number of successful, failed, and pending tasks per queue. This provides real-time visibility into job processing health.</li><li><strong>Type-Safe Data Models (Pydantic):</strong>  When validating large datasets,  can efficiently determine the frequency of invalid data types, helping identify schema issues.</li><li><strong>CLI Tool Argument Parsing:</strong>  Counting the occurrences of specific command-line flags or options.</li><li><strong>ML Preprocessing Feature Frequency:</strong>  Calculating the frequency of categorical features during data preprocessing for machine learning models. This informs feature engineering and model selection.</li></ul><h3>\n  \n  \n  4.

The root cause wasn’t a database outage or a network hiccup, but a subtle race condition within a utility function used for feature engineering. This function, intended to be purely computational and independent of instance state, was incorrectly implemented as an instance method.  The implicit  argument, even when unused, introduced a lock contention point when multiple asynchronous workers attempted to call it concurrently.  This incident highlighted a fundamental truth: seemingly innocuous language features like  are crucial for building robust, scalable Python applications, especially in cloud-native environments.  This post dives deep into , moving beyond textbook definitions to explore its practical implications in production systems, focusing on architecture, performance, and debugging.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  What is \"@staticmethod\" in Python?\n</h3><p> is a decorator that transforms a method within a class into a function bound to the class itself, rather than to an instance of the class.  PEP 105 defines it as a way to define methods that are logically related to the class but don’t require access to instance-specific data.  Technically, it doesn’t enforce any access restrictions; it’s a semantic marker.  CPython’s method table lookup handles  differently than instance methods or class methods (). Instance methods receive the instance () as the first argument, while  receives no implicit first argument.  This distinction is critical for performance and concurrency.  From a typing perspective,  doesn’t alter the function’s signature; it’s purely a runtime behavior modifier.  Tools like  treat it as a regular function within the class namespace.</p><ol><li><strong>FastAPI Request Validation:</strong>  We use  extensively in FastAPI applications for request body validation.  Instead of tying validation logic to a specific instance of a data model, we define static methods that perform schema validation using Pydantic. This keeps the validation logic separate from the model’s core data representation and allows for easy reuse across different endpoints.\n</li></ol><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><ol><li><p> In our asynchronous task queue (built on Celery and Redis),  is used for utility functions that process data without needing access to the worker’s state.

However, it’s crucial to type-hint the function signature correctly.   can test  methods directly without needing to instantiate the class.   models can leverage  for custom validation logic.</p><p>Here's a  snippet demonstrating our typical configuration:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>We enforce strict type checking with  to catch potential errors related to  usage, particularly incorrect type hints.  We also use  hooks to run  and  on every commit.</p><p>Consider a geometric shape class:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>This example demonstrates a clear separation of concerns. The  and  calculations are logically related to the  class but don’t require access to a specific  instance.

This can lead to unexpected behavior and difficult-to-debug errors.  For example:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Debugging such issues requires careful examination of the traceback and understanding the scope of variables.

Runtime assertions can also help catch these errors early:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><h3>\n  \n  \n  Performance &amp; Scalability\n</h3><p> offers a slight performance advantage over instance methods because it avoids the overhead of instance lookup and method binding.  However, the difference is usually negligible unless the method is called millions of times.  The real performance benefit comes from avoiding unnecessary context switching and lock contention, as demonstrated in the initial data pipeline incident.  Using  to profile your code can help identify performance bottlenecks related to method calls.</p><p>While  itself doesn’t introduce direct security vulnerabilities, it’s crucial to ensure that the logic within the static method is secure.  If the method processes user-provided input, it must be properly validated to prevent code injection or other attacks.  Avoid deserializing untrusted data within a  without strict validation.</p><p>We use a combination of unit tests, integration tests, and property-based tests (using Hypothesis) to verify the correctness of  methods.  Unit tests focus on testing the method’s logic in isolation, while integration tests verify its interaction with other components.

We were experiencing intermittent failures in our data labeling pipeline, specifically during the dynamic instantiation of custom data validation rules. These rules, defined as classes inheriting from a base validator, were being instantiated based on configuration loaded from a distributed key-value store (etcd). The root cause wasn’t the validation logic itself, but a race condition during class resolution when the configuration changed mid-deployment.  The dynamic nature of our system, coupled with aggressive caching, meant we were sometimes instantiating validators with stale class definitions.  A careful refactoring leveraging  as a factory method resolved the issue, ensuring consistent class resolution and preventing the intermittent failures. This incident highlighted that  isn’t just a syntactic sugar; it’s a crucial tool for building robust, dynamically configurable systems in Python.  It matters in modern Python ecosystems – cloud-native services, data pipelines, web APIs, and machine learning ops – because these systems often require dynamic behavior and factory patterns.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  What is  in Python?\n</h3><p> is a decorator that transforms a method within a class into a class method. Technically, it binds the method to the class itself, rather than to an instance of the class. This means the first argument passed to the method is the class itself (), not the instance ().  This is defined in PEP 3 (Python Enhancement Proposal 3) and further clarified in the official documentation (<a href=\"https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#classmethod\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#classmethod</a>).</p><p>From a CPython internals perspective,  essentially modifies the method descriptor to set its  method to return the function bound to the class object, rather than an instance.  This is crucial for understanding how it differs from instance methods and static methods.  The typing system recognizes  through , allowing for static type checking of the  argument.  Tools like  leverage this to ensure type safety when working with class methods.</p><ol><li><p><strong>FastAPI Dependency Injection with Dynamic Configuration:</strong>  We use  to create factory methods for database connection pools in FastAPI. The connection parameters (host, port, credentials) are loaded from environment variables or a configuration service.  A class method dynamically configures the pool based on the current environment, ensuring each deployment uses the correct database settings. This avoids hardcoding credentials and simplifies environment-specific configurations.</p></li><li><p><strong>Async Job Queues with Task Factories:</strong> In a Celery-based asynchronous task queue, we use  to create task factories.  The class method receives the task configuration (e.g., retry policy, queue name) and returns an instance of the task class, pre-configured with the specified parameters. This allows us to dynamically adjust task behavior without modifying the task code itself.</p></li><li><p><strong>Type-Safe Data Models with Alternate Constructors:</strong>  We’ve implemented a system for defining data models using Pydantic.  Sometimes, we need to construct objects from data sources that don’t directly map to the Pydantic model’s fields.   provides a clean way to define alternate constructors that handle these specific data formats, ensuring type safety and validation.</p></li><li><p><strong>CLI Tools with Subcommand Factories:</strong>  For a complex CLI tool built with Click, we use  to create factories for subcommand classes.  The class method receives the command-line arguments and returns an instance of the appropriate subcommand class, allowing for dynamic subcommand resolution based on user input.</p></li><li><p><strong>ML Preprocessing Pipelines with Dynamic Feature Engineering:</strong> In our machine learning pipelines, we use  to create factory methods for feature engineering steps. The class method receives the feature configuration (e.g., scaling method, transformation parameters) and returns an instance of the feature engineering class, pre-configured with the specified parameters. This allows us to dynamically adjust the feature engineering process without modifying the core pipeline code.</p></li></ol><h3>\n  \n  \n  Integration with Python Tooling\n</h3><p> integrates seamlessly with modern Python tooling.</p><ul><li> correctly infers the type of the  argument and performs static type checking.

The  method dynamically loads validator classes based on the configuration, caching them for performance.  The  annotation ensures that  is a class variable, shared across all instances.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Failure Scenarios &amp; Debugging\n</h3><p>A common failure scenario is incorrect handling of inheritance when using . If a subclass overrides a class method without calling the superclass’s implementation, it can break the inheritance chain and lead to unexpected behavior.</p><p>Another issue is race conditions when dynamically loading classes, as experienced in our production incident.  Caching is essential for performance, but stale cache entries can lead to incorrect behavior.</p><p>Debugging these issues requires careful use of logging and tracing.  We use structured logging with correlation IDs to track requests through the system.   can be used to step through the code and inspect the state of the  argument.   can help identify performance bottlenecks in the class method.  Runtime assertions can be used to verify that the  argument is of the expected type.</p><p>Example traceback (simplified):</p><div><pre><code>Traceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"...\", line 10, in from_config\n    return cls.VALIDATOR_CACHE[validator_type](config)\n  File \"...\", line 20, in __init__\n    super().__init__(config)\nTypeError: __init__() missing 1 required positional argument: 'config'\n</code></pre></div><p>This indicates a mismatch between the expected arguments in the superclass's  method and the arguments being passed.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Performance &amp; Scalability\n</h3><p> itself doesn’t introduce significant performance overhead. However, the code within the class method can impact performance.  Avoid global state and unnecessary allocations.  If the class method performs I/O operations, consider using asynchronous programming to improve scalability.  Caching, as demonstrated in the example above, is crucial for performance when dynamically loading classes.  We use Redis as a distributed cache to store the loaded validator classes.</p><p>We benchmarked the  method using  and found that caching reduced the instantiation time by over 90%.</p><p>Dynamically loading classes based on configuration can introduce security risks.  Ensure that the configuration source is trusted and that the loaded classes are properly validated.  Avoid using  or  to execute arbitrary code.  Implement input validation to prevent code injection attacks.  Consider using a sandbox environment to isolate the loaded classes.</p><p>We use a combination of unit tests, integration tests, and property-based tests to verify the correctness of class methods.  Unit tests verify the logic within the class method in isolation.  Integration tests verify that the class method interacts correctly with other components of the system.  Property-based tests (using Hypothesis) generate random inputs to test the class method against a wide range of scenarios.</p><p>Our CI/CD pipeline includes the following steps:</p><ul><li> runs unit and integration tests.</li><li> performs static type checking.</li><li> runs tests in multiple Python environments.</li><li>GitHub Actions automatically runs the CI/CD pipeline on every pull request.</li><li>Pre-commit hooks enforce code style and linting.</li></ul><h3>\n  \n  \n  Common Pitfalls &amp; Anti-Patterns\n</h3><ol><li><strong>Forgetting to call :</strong>  This breaks the inheritance chain.</li><li><strong>Using  for instance-specific logic:</strong>  This defeats the purpose of the decorator.</li><li>  Simple instance methods are often more appropriate.</li><li>  This reduces the benefits of static type checking.</li><li><strong>Not caching dynamically loaded classes:</strong>  This leads to performance bottlenecks.</li><li><strong>Lack of input validation when dynamically loading classes:</strong> This introduces security vulnerabilities.</li></ol><h3>\n  \n  \n  Best Practices &amp; Architecture\n</h3><ul><li> Always use type hints to improve code readability and maintainability.</li><li>  Keep class methods focused on a single responsibility.</li><li>  Validate inputs and handle exceptions gracefully.</li><li>  Break down complex systems into smaller, reusable modules.</li><li>  Use a layered configuration approach to manage environment-specific settings.</li><li>  Use dependency injection to improve testability and flexibility.</li><li>  Automate testing, linting, and deployment.</li><li>  Use Docker to create reproducible build environments.</li><li>  Write clear and concise documentation.</li></ul><p> is a powerful tool for building robust, scalable, and maintainable Python systems.

I will look into all requests as soon as I can.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Peering into the GRPO equation\n</h2><p>We will dissect is this scary-looking (at least to me!) equation: </p><p>This is the theoretical expectation, which theoretically considers every possible prompt, generates a group of responses for each, and then average the improvement we get from the  (see below) over all these possibilities.</p><p>This is the sample-based  (the \"estimator\"). Since we cannot possibly compute the true expectation over all prompts and outputs, we approximate it during training where we take one batch ( a prompt  and its  generated outputs \n\n and we compute the numerical estimate of our objective using the objective function. We then use this numerical estimate to calculate a gradient and update our model's weights, i.e. (\n\n becomes \n\n).</p><p>I will break down the equations into the following parts:</p><ul><li><p>Part 1: \n</p></li><li><p>Part 2: \n</p></li><li><p>Part 3: \n</p></li><li><p>Part 4: \n</p></li><li><p>Part 5: \n</p></li></ul><p>The equation that will be dissected in this part is:</p><ul><li><p>The tilde (~): It means \"distributed according to\" or \"is sampled from\". So:</p><ul><li>\n This represents questions (q) sampled from the overall distribution of questions (P(Q)). This is a standard practice where models learn to respond to various prompts during training.</li><li>\n: This means the group of G outputs \n\n is sampled from the policy \n\n given question q.</li></ul></li><li><p>The expectation function i.e. \n signifies a joint expectation over multiple random variables. One commonly seen example is \n which means taking the expectation over the combined process of first sampling X from P(X), and then sampling Y from P(Y|X). The expectation then applies to the function of both X and Y.</p></li><li><p>In probability theory, \n can be written as \n for discrete variables, or \n for continuous variables. The comma notation is a shorthand for this sequential or joint sampling process.</p></li><li><p>Applying to our equation:</p><ul><li>q ~ P(Q): First, a question  is randomly chosen from the pool of all possible questions.</li><li>\n: Given that specific question , a group of  outputs \n\n is then generated by the old policy \n\n.</li><li>The expression \n\n that follows (the GRPO objective function) then depends on both  and the generated output \n\n.</li><li>So, the expectation is taken over the entire data collection process: first randomly pick a question from the bank of available questions, and then generating multiple responses for that question using the \n\n policy.</li></ul></li></ul><ul><li>The tilde (~) tells you how the data is being generated (which distribution).</li><li>The comma (,) separates independent (or conditionally independent) sampling steps that define the full set of random variables over which the expectation is taken. It implies a joint probability distribution, often constructed sequentially.</li></ul><h4>\n  \n  \n  Why \n\n instead of simply \n\n?\n</h4><ul><li>The notation \n\n explicitly states that q is the random variable being sampled, and P(Q) is its probability distribution.</li><li>Similarly, \n\n states that \n\n are the random variables (the sampled outputs), and \n\n is the conditional probability distribution from which they are drawn (conditioned on q).</li></ul><p>Without q ~ and \n\n, the expression \n\n is ambiguous as it is not clear which variables are being sampled or how are they related to the function \n\n. The P(Q) and \n\n are distributions, not actual values that vary and contribute to the average.</p><p>To implement the Expectation operator E[...]. we can use a loop where each iteration processes a new, randomly sampled mini-batch of prompts, calculate the loss for that batch, and performs an update. Over many iterations, this process approximates the expected value of the objective over the entire data distribution.</p><p>Do not fret that the code is long. I will break it down and explain each piece accordingly.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><h3>\n  \n  \n  The rollout phase: \n</h3><p>For each prompt q in our batch, we need to generate a group G possible outputs (\n\n) using the fixed, old policy \n\n.

The outer loop iterates through prompts in the batch, and the inner loop runs  (G) times to generate each output \n\n for that prompt.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><h3>\n  \n  \n  Part 2: \n</h3><p>The concept behind this equation is importance sampling:</p><ul><li><p> This represents the probability of generating a specific output \n\n (a complete reasoning trace and answer) given the input question \n\n, using the . The \"old\" policy is the version of the model that was used to generate the batch of data for the current training step. It is frozen during this step.</p></li><li><p> This represents the probability of generating that \n given the question \n\n, but using the \n. This is the policy we are actively training and updating in this step.</p></li><li><p> The ratio \n\n is the  or .</p><ul><li>  If \n\n, the new policy \n\n is  to generate output \n\n than the old one was.</li><li>  If \n\n, the new policy \n\n is  to generate output \n\n.</li><li>  If \n\n, the policy has not changed with respect to this specific output.</li></ul></li></ul><h4>\n  \n  \n  What is its purpose? (Off-Policy Learning)\n</h4><p>The primary purpose of this ratio is to enable .</p><p>In reinforcement learning, the ideal way to evaluate a policy is to use it to generate actions and see what rewards you get. However, generating new outputs (\n\n) from the model for every single gradient update is computationally very expensive.</p><p>Off-policy methods solve this. We can:</p><ol><li> Generate a large batch of experiences (the outputs \n\n) using the \n\n policy.</li><li> Then, perform several steps of optimization on our \n\n policy using that same batch of data.</li></ol><p>The importance sampling ratio is the mathematical \"correction factor\" that allows us to estimate how good an action is under the  policy (\n\n) using data that was collected by the  policy (\n\n).</p><p>For the ease of discussion, I will equate:</p><p>The objective function multiplies this ratio by the advantage \n\n (how good the output \n\n was). So, the update logic is:</p><ul><li>  If \n\n was a good output (\n\n), we want to increase its probability. Maximising \n\n will push \n\n to be greater than 1, which in turn pushes \n\n to increase.</li><li>  If \n\n was a bad output (\n\n), we want to decrease its probability. Maximising \n\n (a negative number) will push \n\n to be less than 1, making the overall term less negative and thus decreasing \n\n.</li></ul><h4>\n  \n  \n  Why is it designed that way? (Stability and PPO)\n</h4><p>While the ratio allows for efficient learning, it is also a source of instability. If the new policy \n\n becomes very different from the old one \n\n, the ratio \n\n can become extremely large or close to zero. A very large ratio would lead to a massive, noisy gradient update, potentially destroying all the learning the model has already done.</p><p>This is the problem that <strong>Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)</strong>, from which GRPO's objective is derived, was designed to solve. The design in Equation 1 is a direct implementation of the  (source: <a href=\"https://spinningup.openai.com/en/latest/algorithms/ppo.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Proximal Policy Optimization</a>).</p><p>The goal is to keep the new policy \"proximal\" (i.e., close) to the old policy. This creates a \"trust region\" where we can be confident the update is beneficial.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Part 3: \n</h3><p>This is the core of the PPO algorithm, which encourages making the new policy \n\n more likely to produce high-advantage outputs, but \"clips\" the update to prevent it from changing to drastically and destabilsing training.</p><p>Take for instance we set \n\n to be 0.2. We then get the following clipping equation:</p><p>Examples of how the clipping equation works is below:</p><ul><li>\n because the value is within the range.</li><li>\n because the value is beyond the range and is clipped down to the maximum value of 1.2.</li></ul><p>We can see that with clipping, when the optimiser gets \"greedy\" and suggests a huge change, the model is still encouraged to make the output more likely, but is prevented from making a dangerously large jump in the policy.</p><p>This logic is encapsulated within the .</p><p>The probability ratio \n\n is calculated in log-space for \nnumerical stability: \n\n).</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>The helper function  is responsible for computing log P(o_i | q) for a given policy.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><h3>\n  \n  \n  Part 4: \n</h3><p>The purpose of this  function is to act as a floor, i.e.:</p><ul><li> When an output is good (positive \n\n), it prevents the update from becoming too rewarding.</li><li> When an output is bad (negative \n\n), it acts as a floor on the penalty.</li></ul><p>In both cases, the  function prevents the model from making a large policy change too quickly.</p><p>Using back the same clipping function in Part 3, where we set \n\n, \n\n, and we now assume we have an advantage value \n\n. The equation we thus get is:</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Part 5: \n</h3><p>This function acts as a regulariser, penalising the policy \n\n for deviating from a reference policy \n\n. <em>(Note: When we say policy, we are actually referring to the LLM as weights, so \n\n refers to the LLM with updated weights, while \n\n usually refers to the original stock LLM.)_</em></p><p>The paper defines the term as:</p><p>What is key is to recognise that this equation is not the standard Kulback-Leibler (KL) divergence, but a more specific, per-sample approximation chosen for being computationally cheaper. This compares to the standard KL divergence which can be expressed as:</p><p>Compared to the standard definition, there are two main differences:</p><ol><li> The standard definition is an  over the entire distribution \n\n, whereas the paper's variant is an expression for a \n.</li><li> The functional form of the paper's variant is different from the term inside the standard expectation.</li></ol><h4>\n  \n  \n  Deconstruction and Analysis of the variant of KL divergence\n</h4><p>For simplicity, let the probability ratio be :</p><p>Then Equation (2) defines a function \n\n:</p><p>This function is evaluated for a single sample \n\n, which itself was drawn from the  policy, \n\n.</p><p>In order for \n\n to be a valid divergence measure, it must satisfy two properties:</p><ol><li>\n.</li><li><strong>Identity of Indiscernibles:</strong>\n if and only if \n\n. </li></ol><p>Proof that \n\n satisfies the two properties is in Appendix A. </p><p>This term is a regularizer. It penalizes the objective if the trainable policy π_θ strays too far from the original, trusted reference policy π_ref, helping to prevent catastrophic forgetting.</p><p>Code Implementation: Also within .</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>The Advantage Function \n\n is a central component in modern policy gradient methods. Intuitively, the advantage tells us not just if an action was \"good\" (positive reward), but if it was \"better than average\". It is designed to reduce sensitivity to reward scaling, and stabilises training by preventing outlier rewards.

In reinforcement learning, the simplest policy gradient update rule uses the total reward \n\n to scale the gradient \n\n. However, this approach suffers from high variance, meaning the gradient estimates can fluctuate wildly from one batch of samples to another, leading to unstable training.</p><p>The core idea to reduce this variance is to subtract a \n from the reward. The baseline should ideally be an estimate of the average reward from state \n\n. This leads to the Advantage Function:</p><p>Intuitively, the advantage tells us not just if an action was \"good\" (positive reward), but if it was \"better than average\". If \n\n, the action \n\n was better than expected, and its probability should be increased. If \n\n, the action was worse than expected, and its probability should be decreased.</p><p><strong>Key Theorem (Baseline Invariance of Policy Gradient):</strong>\nThe introduction of a baseline \n\n that depends only on the state  (or in our case, the prompt \n\n) does not introduce bias into the gradient estimate.</p><p>\nWe need to show that \n\n.</p><p>This proves that subtracting a baseline does not change the expected gradient, \n\n. While the expectation is the same, the variance of the gradient estimator \n\n is significantly reduced.</p><p>The paper's specific implementation of the advantage function for a group of \n\n outputs \n\n is:</p><p>where \n\n are the rewards for the corresponding outputs.</p><h4>\n  \n  \n  Step-by-Step Component Breakdown\n</h4><p>Let's deconstruct the formula for the advantage of the -th sample, \n\n.</p><h4>\n  \n  \n  1. The Rewards: \n</h4><ul><li>: This is the numerical reward assigned to the -th output \n\n, which was generated for a given prompt \n\n.</li><li> The paper specifies (in Section 2.2.2) that these are rule-based rewards.\n\n<ul><li> A binary or continuous score evaluating if the final answer in \n\n is correct. For a math problem, this could be checking if the result matches the known solution. For a coding problem, it could be the percentage of test cases passed.</li><li> A score evaluating if the output \n\n adheres to a desired format (e.g., using  and  tags).</li></ul></li><li> The existence of a reward function \n\n is a fundamental axiom of the reinforcement learning framework. \n\n.</li></ul><h4>\n  \n  \n  2. The Baseline: \n</h4><ul><li> This is the  (or sample average) of the rewards obtained from the  outputs generated for the same prompt .</li></ul><ul><li> This term serves as the baseline . It's an estimate of the expected reward for the given prompt  under the current (old) policy \n\n. Instead of using a separate, learned \"critic\" network to predict the expected reward, the GRPO algorithm uses this simple and efficient empirical estimate from the group of samples.</li><li> The numerator \n\n is the raw, unnormalized advantage. It measures whether the -th output was better or worse than the average performance within its group.</li></ul><h4>\n  \n  \n  3. The Normalization Factor: \n</h4><ul><li> This is the <strong>empirical standard deviation</strong> of the rewards from the group.</li></ul><p><em>(Note: Sometimes the denominator is  for the biased estimator, but  for the unbiased estimator. In practice, for large , the difference is negligible. We will assume the standard definition.)</em></p><ul><li><strong>Purpose of Normalization:</strong> Dividing the raw advantage by the standard deviation is a form of data standardization. It rescales the advantages for a given prompt so that their distribution has a standard deviation of 1.</li><li><strong>Mathematical Justification:</strong>\nLet the set of raw advantages for a group be \n\n .\n\n<ul><li>  The mean of this set is \n\n . The advantages are centered at zero.</li><li>  The standard deviation of this set is \n\n .\nBy dividing each element of \n\n  by \n\n , the resulting set of normalized advantages \n\n  will have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.</li></ul></li></ul><h4>\n  \n  \n  Why is this Normalization Important?\n</h4><ol><li><p><strong>Reduces Sensitivity to Reward Scaling:</strong> Imagine two different tasks. In Task 1, rewards are either 0 or 1. The advantages will be small fractions. In Task 2, rewards are 0 or 1000. The advantages will be large numbers. Without normalization, the gradient updates for Task 2 would be 1000 times larger than for Task 1, potentially destabilizing learning when training on a mix of tasks. Normalization ensures that the scale of the advantage signal is consistent across different prompts and reward schemes.</p></li><li><p> It prevents outlier rewards (a single very high or very low reward in a group) from generating excessively large gradients that could harm the policy. By scaling everything relative to the variation within the group, the updates become more measured and stable.</p></li></ol><p>Equation (3) defines a specific form of the advantage function, known as  in its simplest form, with an additional normalization step.</p><ol><li> It first calculates a raw advantage for each sample \n\n  by subtracting a baseline from its reward \n\n .</li><li><strong>Uses an Empirical Baseline:</strong> The baseline is not a learned value but is efficiently estimated as the mean reward of all samples \n\n generated for the same prompt \n\n . This conforms to the requirement that the baseline depends only on the prompt \n\n  (and the policy that generated the samples), thus not introducing bias into the policy gradient.</li><li><strong>Normalizes the Advantage:</strong> The raw advantage is then divided by the standard deviation of the rewards within the group. This standardizes the advantages, making them have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1 for that group.</li><li> This process results in a well-behaved, normalized advantage signal \n\n that robustly indicates whether an output was better or worse than average, independent of the absolute scale of the rewards for that particular task. This standardized signal is then used in Equation (1) to provide stable and effective gradient updates for the policy \n\n .</li></ol>","contentLength":24725,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"My first innovative code !","url":"https://dev.to/vishwa_xii_1417a4e94e7240/my-first-innovative-code--4242","date":1750523365,"author":"Vishwa XII","guid":164341,"unread":true,"content":"<h2>\n  \n  \n  ** Today I found how cloud in working, how it stores all the data of any type in a single storage place, I solve it in a 9 lines of python code, not accurately, but I tried logically !**\n</h2><p>from ast import literal_eval</p><p>file = input(\"Enter anything: \").split()</p><div><pre><code>    cloud.append(literal_eval(file))\nexcept:\n    cloud.append(item)\n</code></pre></div><p>I know this is dumb, but I hate to watch tutorials !`</p>","contentLength":385,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Mastering the Command Line: 25 Essential Scripting Resources for Developers","url":"https://dev.to/vaib/mastering-the-command-line-25-essential-scripting-resources-for-developers-4284","date":1750521812,"author":"Coder","guid":164315,"unread":true,"content":"<p>Scripting languages are the unsung heroes of modern software development.

The root cause wasn’t a database outage or network hiccup, but a subtle interaction between a third-party risk scoring service and our internal data transformation layer. The risk service’s API had undergone a minor version bump, adding optional parameters. Our transformation layer, designed with extensive use of  for flexibility,  to handle the new parameters gracefully. However, under heavy load, the dynamic unpacking and attribute access within the transformation functions led to significant performance degradation and, eventually, timeouts. This incident highlighted a crucial truth:  is a powerful tool, but its unchecked use can introduce subtle performance and reliability issues in production systems. This post dives deep into , exploring its intricacies, best practices, and potential pitfalls for experienced Python engineers building large-scale applications.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  What is  in Python?\n</h3><p> (short for \"keyword arguments\") is a Python feature allowing functions to accept an arbitrary number of keyword arguments. Technically, it unpacks a dictionary into keyword arguments.  Defined in PEP 3102, it leverages Python’s function call mechanism to dynamically bind keys in the dictionary to function parameters. </p><p>From a CPython internals perspective,  translates to creating a frame object with a local variable representing the dictionary. The function then iterates through this dictionary, attempting to match keys to parameter names. This dynamic lookup is where performance concerns arise.  The typing system, via  or , acknowledges its existence but offers limited static checking without explicit type annotations. Tools like Pydantic and type hints are crucial for mitigating this.</p><ol><li><p><strong>FastAPI Request Handling:</strong> FastAPI leverages  extensively in route handlers.  While providing flexibility, it necessitates careful validation using Pydantic models to ensure type safety and prevent unexpected behavior.  Without validation, a malicious actor could potentially inject arbitrary parameters.</p></li><li><p><strong>Async Job Queues (Celery/RQ):</strong>  Asynchronous task queues often use  to pass context and configuration to worker functions. This allows for dynamic task execution without modifying the core task definition.  However, serializing and deserializing these dictionaries for inter-process communication can become a bottleneck.</p></li><li><p><strong>Type-Safe Data Models (Pydantic):</strong> Pydantic’s  method allows for flexible data serialization.  However, passing untrusted  directly can bypass validation, leading to data integrity issues.</p></li><li><p>  Command-line interface libraries use  to handle optional arguments.  This simplifies argument parsing but requires robust error handling to manage invalid or unexpected options.</p></li><li><p><strong>Machine Learning Preprocessing (Scikit-learn Pipelines):</strong>  Many Scikit-learn transformers accept  to configure their behavior.  This allows for customization but can make pipelines harder to debug if the configuration is not explicitly documented.</p></li></ol><h3>\n  \n  \n  Integration with Python Tooling\n</h3><p> integration with tooling is critical for maintaining code quality.</p><ul><li><p>  Without explicit type hints, mypy treats  as , effectively disabling static type checking.  Using  is a starting point, but ideally, you should define a more specific type using  or a Pydantic model.</p></li><li><p>  Parameterizing tests with  is common, but requires careful consideration of test coverage.  Ensure you test all possible combinations of keyword arguments.</p></li><li><p> Pydantic models can be used to validate  before passing them to functions. This provides a strong type safety net.</p></li><li><p> can define interfaces for functions accepting , enabling static analysis of expected arguments.</p></li><li><p>  Logging functions often accept  for custom formatting.  Be mindful of sensitive data being logged through these dynamic arguments.</p></li></ul><p><strong> example (mypy config):</strong></p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>This example demonstrates using a  for common configuration options and  for less frequent ones. This approach balances flexibility with type safety.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Failure Scenarios &amp; Debugging\n</h3><p>A common failure scenario is passing unexpected keyword arguments to a function. This can lead to  exceptions or, worse, silent failures if the function ignores the extra arguments.</p><div><pre><code>TypeError: process_data() got an unexpected keyword argument 'invalid_param'\n</code></pre></div><p>Debugging -related issues can be challenging.   is useful for inspecting the contents of the  dictionary at runtime.   can track the values of keyword arguments as they are passed to functions.   can identify performance bottlenecks caused by dynamic attribute access. Runtime assertions can validate the presence and type of expected arguments.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Performance &amp; Scalability\n</h3><p>The dynamic nature of  introduces performance overhead.  Attribute access on dictionaries is slower than direct attribute access on objects.  In performance-critical sections of code, avoid excessive use of .  Consider using explicit parameters or data classes instead.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>This demonstrates that  is significantly faster than .</p><p> can introduce security vulnerabilities if used improperly.  Specifically, deserializing untrusted data into  can lead to code injection or privilege escalation.  Always validate and sanitize input before passing it to functions via .  Avoid using  or  with data from .</p><p>Testing -based functions requires comprehensive test coverage.  Use property-based testing (e.g., Hypothesis) to generate a wide range of input values.  Use type validation tools (e.g., Pydantic) to ensure that the arguments passed to functions are of the correct type.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><h3>\n  \n  \n  Common Pitfalls &amp; Anti-Patterns\n</h3><ol><li> Passing untrusted data directly into .</li><li> Using  when explicit parameters would be clearer.</li><li> Failing to use type hints with .</li><li>kwargs<strong>kwargs<code> to functions that also accept </code></strong>kwargs`, creating a complex and hard-to-debug call stack.</li><li><strong>Mutable Default Arguments:</strong> Using mutable default arguments in conjunction with .</li><li> Failing to document the expected keyword arguments.</li></ol><h3>\n  \n  \n  Best Practices &amp; Architecture\n</h3><ul><li> Always use type hints with , preferably with  or Pydantic models.</li><li>  Separate common configuration options from less frequent ones.</li><li> Validate and sanitize input before passing it to functions via .</li><li>  Design functions with a clear and well-defined interface.</li><li> Use configuration layering to manage different environments and settings.</li><li>  Use dependency injection to provide configuration options to functions.</li><li> Automate testing, linting, and type checking.</li></ul><p> is a powerful feature that can enhance the flexibility and extensibility of Python code.

However, as datasets grow exponentially in size and complexity, the performance limitations of Python's built-in data structures (like lists, dictionaries, and tuples) become apparent. While excellent for general-purpose programming, they are not optimized for large-scale numerical operations. Python lists, for instance, store heterogeneous data, meaning each element can be of a different type, requiring individual memory allocations and type checking during operations. This overhead significantly slows down computations on vast amounts of data.</p><p>To overcome these bottlenecks, the data science community embraced \"vectorized operations.\" This paradigm shifts from explicit looping over individual elements to applying operations on entire arrays or columns of data at once. This approach leverages highly optimized, often compiled, underlying implementations, leading to dramatic performance improvements.</p><p>NumPy Arrays: The Foundation of Numerical Computing</p><p>At the heart of high-performance numerical computing in Python lies NumPy, and its fundamental data structure, the  (N-dimensional array). Unlike Python lists, NumPy arrays store homogeneous data (all elements are of the same type) contiguously in memory. This contiguous storage is crucial because it allows CPUs to perform operations on chunks of data efficiently, leveraging modern processor architectures and SIMD (Single Instruction, Multiple Data) instructions.</p><p>Consider a simple arithmetic operation on a large dataset:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>You'll observe that the NumPy operation completes significantly faster. This efficiency is why NumPy arrays are the bedrock for almost all numerical and scientific computing libraries in Python. For more details on NumPy, refer to the <a href=\"https://numpy.org/doc/stable/user/absolute_beginners.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">NumPy Documentation</a>.</p><p>Pandas DataFrames and Series: Structured Data Powerhouse</p><p>Building directly on NumPy arrays, Pandas provides powerful, high-level data structures for structured data: the DataFrame and Series. A Pandas Series can be thought of as a single column of data, essentially an enhanced NumPy array with an associated label (index). A DataFrame, then, is a collection of Series objects, sharing a common index, forming a tabular data structure with labeled rows and columns.</p><p>While Pandas DataFrames don't implement columnar storage in the same strict sense as some other systems (like Apache Arrow, which we'll discuss next), they conceptually operate very efficiently on columns. Each column in a DataFrame is typically a NumPy array, allowing Pandas to leverage NumPy's vectorized operations for common data manipulation tasks like filtering, aggregation, and transformations. This design makes Pandas incredibly efficient for data cleaning, transformation, and analysis.</p><p>Common operations in Pandas, such as , , or , are highly optimized under the hood, making complex data workflows surprisingly fast. The design allows for intuitive and readable code while maintaining strong performance for most data science tasks. Dive deeper into its capabilities with the <a href=\"https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Pandas Documentation</a>.</p><p>Apache Arrow: The Game Changer for Interoperability and Performance</p><p>As data science workflows became more complex, involving multiple languages and systems (e.g., Python for analysis, Spark for big data processing, R for statistics), the need for an efficient and standardized in-memory data format emerged. This led to Apache Arrow.</p><p>Apache Arrow is not a data structure library in the traditional sense, but rather a language-agnostic, columnar memory format. It defines a standard way to represent tabular data in memory, enabling zero-copy data exchange between different systems and programming languages (Python, R, Java, C++, etc.). This eliminates the costly serialization/deserialization overhead that typically occurs when data moves between different environments.</p><p>Libraries like Pandas (especially with its newer \"Arrow backend\" option) and Polars leverage Arrow to significantly improve performance and reduce memory footprint, particularly when dealing with mixed-type data or large strings. For instance, converting a Pandas DataFrame to an Arrow Table is efficient because both are designed to work with columnar data principles.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>This seamless conversion highlights Arrow's role in facilitating high-performance data pipelines across disparate tools. Learn more about its capabilities at the <a href=\"https://arrow.apache.org/docs/python/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Apache Arrow Documentation</a>.</p><p>Polars: The Blazing-Fast DataFrame Library (Rust-powered)</p><p>Polars is a relatively new, yet incredibly powerful, DataFrame library that has gained significant traction for its blazing speed and memory efficiency. Written in Rust, it leverages the performance benefits of a compiled language while providing a Pythonic API. Polars is built natively on Apache Arrow, which is a key factor in its high performance.</p><p>Key features of Polars include:</p><ul><li> Operations are not executed immediately but are instead built into a query plan, allowing Polars to optimize the execution order and reduce redundant computations.</li><li> Polars encourages an expressive, functional style of data manipulation, which can lead to more readable and performant code.</li><li><strong>Native Apache Arrow Integration:</strong> By using Arrow as its in-memory format, Polars benefits from efficient data storage and zero-copy operations.</li></ul><p>Let's look at a comparative benchmark between Pandas and Polars for a moderately complex data transformation:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>The performance difference, especially on larger datasets, can be substantial, making Polars an attractive option for data scientists dealing with performance-critical applications.

This is where Narwhals comes in. Narwhals is an emerging project that aims to provide a unified API across different DataFrame libraries. Its goal is to allow developers to write code that is agnostic to the underlying DataFrame implementation, making it easier to switch between backends (e.g., Pandas, Polars, Modin, cuDF) based on specific performance needs or deployment environments without rewriting significant portions of the codebase.</p><p>By offering a common interface, Narwhals simplifies the development of libraries and applications that need to be compatible with various DataFrame frameworks, fostering greater interoperability and reducing the learning curve for users transitioning between them.

Each of these tools offers distinct advantages and caters to specific use cases:</p><ul><li><strong>Standard Python Data Structures (lists, dictionaries):</strong> Ideal for general-purpose programming, small datasets, and when data heterogeneity is a requirement. They offer flexibility but lack the performance for large-scale numerical computations.</li><li> The fundamental building block for numerical computing. Essential for any task involving large, homogeneous numerical arrays where vectorized operations are key to performance.</li><li><strong>Pandas DataFrames and Series:</strong> Your go-to for structured data manipulation, cleaning, and analysis. They provide a rich, intuitive API built on top of NumPy's efficiency, suitable for most medium to large datasets.</li><li> Crucial for interoperability and efficient data exchange between different systems and languages, especially in big data ecosystems. It underpins many modern high-performance libraries.</li><li> An excellent choice when raw speed and memory efficiency are paramount, particularly for very large datasets or complex transformations. Its Rust backend and lazy evaluation offer significant performance gains over traditional Pandas for certain workloads.</li></ul><p>Understanding these specialized data structures and their underlying mechanisms is vital for any Python developer looking to optimize their data processing workflows and stay at the forefront of the data science ecosystem. The right tool, applied judiciously, can unlock significant performance improvements and enable the tackling of increasingly complex data challenges.

On the surface, both get the job done — but under the hood, they’re built for different worlds. In this blog, we’ll break down the real-world <strong>differences between Bash and Python scripting</strong>, their  and most importantly — <strong>when you should use each.</strong></p></blockquote><p>Scripting, at its core, is about giving your computer a to-do list — a set of instructions it can follow automatically, step by step. Think of it like writing a recipe: instead of telling a person how to cook a dish, you’re telling the computer how to carry out a task.</p><p>Let’s be honest — nobody enjoys doing the same repetitive tasks every day. Whether it’s moving files, cleaning up logs, or setting up your dev environment for the 10th time this week, it gets old fast. That’s where scripting comes in — and it’s a total game changer.</p><p>Scripting is like giving your computer a checklist and saying, “You handle this. I’ve got better things to do.” Once you write a script, it takes over the boring stuff — no complaints, no forgetfulness, just results. Scripting helps you reduce errors, save time, and focus on the stuff that actually matters. Trust me the moment you start automating even the smallest tasks, you’ll wonder how you ever lived without it.</p><blockquote><p><strong>Some of the most popular scripting languages include:</strong></p></blockquote><ul><li> for system tasks on Unix/Linux.</li><li> for more complex automation and cross-platform scripting.</li><li> for client-side browser scripting.</li><li> for automation in Windows environments.</li></ul><p>Bash () is the default shell on most Linux distributions and macOS. It’s designed to interact directly with the operating system. Think of Bash as a glue that connects other CLI tools together.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  What Makes Bash So Special?\n</h2><p>Bash isn’t just that black box you type commands into — it’s much more than that. It’s like your backstage pass to the entire operating system. With Bash, you’re not just running commands, you’re  them,  them, and  them like a pro.</p><p>Think of Bash as your personal assistant for the command line. You can write a small script to do boring, repetitive things — like moving files, cleaning up folders, or checking system health — and Bash will handle it all for you, without breaking a sweat.</p><p>The real magic? Bash lets you glue together tons of other tools — like , , , , , and . On their own, these tools are powerful. But with Bash, you can make them work together like a well-rehearsed orchestra. One command filters, another searches, another renames — and Bash makes it all flow smoothly in just a few lines of script.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Advantages of Bash Scripting\n</h2><ol><li>Perfect for interacting with the OS, managing files, users, permissions, services, etc.</li><li>Executes quickly with minimal overhead — ideal for short scripts or quick fixes.</li><li>Easily connects tools like , , , , etc. in one-liners or scripts.</li><li>No need for setup — just open the terminal and start scripting.</li><li>Bash is often the go-to choice for scheduled tasks and sysadmin routines.</li></ol><h2>\n  \n  \n  Few Common Bash Commands :\n</h2><ol><li> — it is a command that is used to List Directory , Files and also Folders in long format (with all the permissions , Date and size)\n</li></ol><ol><li>cd — it is a command which is used to change a directory or also move from one directory to an another .\n</li></ol><p>Use  to go up one level, or  alone to return to your home directory.</p><ol><li> — this is used to create a New Empty File . For example shown below it creates a text file called </li></ol><ol><li> — its the most commonly used command when your required to make a Directory because without making a directory you can’t survive. Now in the below example it creates a () called </li></ol><ol><li> — used to remove Files or Directories recursively and forcefully . But be carefull because there’s </li></ol><ol><li> — this is used to Copy Files or Folders into your desired location or directory. Use  for copying directories: </li></ol><ol><li> — . You can also use it to rename: <code>mv oldname.txt newname.txt</code> .\n</li></ol><div><pre><code>mv data.csv archive/data.csv\n</code></pre></div><ol><li> — commanly used to display the content or Print something in the Terminal. For an example  would be printed onto the screen.\n</li></ol><ol><li> — this command is used to view File Contents with opening the file itself .\n</li></ol><ol><li> — command mainly used for searching or matching. Used for Text in files, file names present inside a directory.\n</li></ol><h2>\n  \n  \n  Python Scripting — The Swiss Army Knife of Automation\n</h2><p>Python wasn’t built solely for scripting, but it’s one of the best tools out there when it comes to getting things done efficiently. It’s like that reliable friend who somehow knows how to fix your Wi-Fi, automate your spreadsheet, and build a website — all before lunch. The beauty of Python lies in its readability and simplicity. You don’t need to write 20 lines of code to do something basic. Want to rename 500 files? Scrape data from a website? Monitor a folder for changes? Python makes all of that feel incredibly straightforward.</p><p>And thanks to its massive library ecosystem — from  and  for file handling, to  for working with APIs, to  for data wrangling — you rarely start from scratch. It’s versatile enough to automate daily tasks, yet powerful enough to build entire applications. Whether you’re a beginner writing your first script or a pro building robust automation pipelines, Python is the kind of language that scales with you — and always has your back.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  What Makes Python So Special?\n</h2><p>Python is special because it’s simple, powerful, and insanely versatile. The code reads like plain English, so it’s easy to learn and easy to remember. Whether you’re automating tasks, building websites, crunching data, or diving into AI — Python can handle it all. Plus, with thousands of libraries, there’s a tool for pretty much anything you want to do. It’s the kind of language that grows with you, no matter where you start.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Advantages of Python Scripting\n</h2><ol><li> Clean syntax that feels like English — great for beginners and large teams.</li><li> From file handling to web scraping to machine learning — there’s a library for almost everything.</li><li><p>Perfect for logic-heavy tasks, data manipulation, API integration, and beyond.</p></li><li><p>Python scripts run smoothly on Windows, macOS, and Linux.\nYou can start with a simple script and grow it into a full-blown application.</p></li></ol><h2>\n  \n  \n  Few Common Python Commands :\n</h2><ol><li> — command used to displays text or variables on the screen.\n</li></ol><ol><li> — commonly used to take input from the user_._\n</li></ol><div><pre><code>name = input(\"What's your name? \")\n</code></pre></div><ol><li> — Returns the length of a string, list, or other data types.\n</li></ol><ol><li> — Tells you the data type (e.g., int, str, list).\n</li></ol><ol><li> —Generates a sequence of numbers, often used in loops_._\n</li></ol><div><pre><code>for i in range(5):\n    print(i)\n</code></pre></div><ol><li>, ,  — command widely used for decision-making in your script. It’s outcome solely depends on the conditions.\n</li></ol><div><pre><code>if age &lt; 18:\n    print(\"Minor\")\nelse:\n    print(\"Adult\")\n</code></pre></div><ol><li> — Used to define functions (reusable blocks of code).\n</li></ol><div><pre><code>def greet():\n    print(\"Hello!\")\n</code></pre></div><ol><li> — Lets you use built-in or used to extract the external modules\n</li></ol><div><pre><code>import math\nprint(math.sqrt(25))\n</code></pre></div><ol><li> — Adds an item to the end of a list_._\n</li></ol><div><pre><code>fruits = [\"apple\", \"banana\"]\nfruits.append(\"orange\")\n</code></pre></div><ol><li> — Opens a file for reading or writing\n</li></ol><div><pre><code>file = open(\"data.txt\", \"r\")\n</code></pre></div><h2>\n  \n  \n  Python vs Bash — Side-by-Side Example\n</h2><ul><li><strong>files and count how many lines contain the word “error”</strong></li></ul><div><pre><code>#!/bin/bash\nfor file in *.log; do\n  echo \"$file: $(grep -i error \"$file\" | wc -l) error(s)\"\ndone\n</code></pre></div><div><pre><code>#!/usr/bin/env python3\nimport glob\nfor file in glob.glob(\"*.log\"):\n    with open(file, \"r\") as f:\n        count = sum(1 for line in f if \"error\" in line.lower())\n    print(f\"{file}: {count} error(s)\")\n</code></pre></div><ul><li>  Bash is concise, efficient, and perfect for file processing.</li><li>  Python is clearer, easier to maintain, and handles edge cases more gracefully.</li></ul><h2>\n  \n  \n  When to Use Bash vs Python: The Right Tool for the Right Task\n</h2><p>Let’s be real — when you’re diving into scripting, it’s not about which language is better. It’s about <strong>which one makes your life easier for the task you’re tackling</strong>.</p><p>If you’re working closely with the , Bash is often your best friend. It’s great for those quick-and-dirty tasks like moving files around, starting or stopping services, scheduling cron jobs, or stringing together commands with pipes. Bash is fast, lightweight, and made for interacting with the shell. It really shines in , like managing EC2 instances, running shell scripts during deployments, or automating things through AWS CLI.</p><p>Now, if your task involves <strong>more logic or data crunching</strong>, Python is the way to go. Need to parse a massive log file? Read and write JSON or CSV? Call APIs? Handle errors gracefully and keep your script maintainable? Python does all that and more. It’s clean, powerful, and has a huge set of libraries that make complex tasks feel simple. It’s also great if your script might evolve into something bigger over time — like a command-line tool, automation framework, or even a web service.</p><p>Sometimes, though, the smartest move is to use . For example, you might use a Bash script to keep an eye on your system, and then let Python jump in when there’s real work to do — like processing data or sending out a notification. It’s a powerful combo: Bash handles the grunt work, Python brings the brains.</p><p>So here’s the bottom line:</p><ul><li> when you’re doing quick shell-level stuff.</li><li> when your logic gets heavier or your task gets smarter.</li></ul><p>Choosing between Bash and Python isn’t about picking a winner — it’s about using the right tool for the job.  is unbeatable for quick, low-level system tasks and chaining CLI commands like a pro.  steps in when your scripts need structure, logic, or cross-platform flexibility. In reality, the best automation setups often use , playing to each of their strengths. So instead of asking <em>“Which one should I learn?”</em>, ask <em>“When should I use which?”</em> Master both, and you won’t just write scripts — you’ll build smart, elegant solutions that actually make your life easier.</p>","contentLength":9965,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"🌿 Herbal Remedy Advisor – Grandma's Wisdom Meets LLMs","url":"https://dev.to/avradeep_nayak_fa8d5f6995/herbal-remedy-advisor-grandmas-wisdom-meets-llms-2loj","date":1750491468,"author":"Avradeep Nayak","guid":164096,"unread":true,"content":"<p>“Because your grandma’s tea deserves LLM-level respect.”</p><p>A few weeks ago, while sipping ginger tea during a coding session (thanks, Grandma!), a curious thought struck me:\nWhat if ancient herbal remedies could be queried like ChatGPT?<p>\nWhat if we could combine AI, semantic search, and knowledge graphs to revive traditional wisdom in a modern, developer-friendly way?</p></p><p>That's how Herbal Remedy Advisor was born. 💡</p><p>🔮 Meet the App\nHerbal Remedy Advisor is an AI-powered herbal medicine search engine.

You wouldn't just recall each word in isolation; you'd focus on key details, discarding less important information, and linking events together to understand the narrative. This is similar to what Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) strive for in the world of artificial intelligence, but traditional RNNs often struggle with remembering information over long periods. This is where Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) networks come in, offering powerful solutions to this \"long-term memory\" problem.</p><p>These specialized RNN architectures are crucial for processing sequential data – anything with an order, like text, speech, time series data (stock prices, weather patterns), and even video. They overcome the limitations of basic RNNs by incorporating sophisticated \"gates\" that control the flow of information, allowing them to learn long-range dependencies – connections between events separated by significant time gaps.</p><p><strong>Understanding the Core Concepts:  LSTMs and GRUs</strong></p><p>Think of a basic RNN as a conveyor belt carrying information. Each item on the belt is processed, but the belt's capacity to remember earlier items is limited; they get progressively overwritten. LSTMs and GRUs add a more complex system of storage and retrieval, like adding memory compartments to our conveyor belt.</p><p><strong>LSTM: The Master of Memory Management</strong></p><p>An LSTM network uses three gates:</p><ul><li> Decides what new information should be stored in the cell state (our long-term memory).  It acts like a filter, selecting only the most relevant information.</li><li> Decides what information should be removed from the cell state.  Think of this as discarding irrelevant or outdated details.</li><li> Decides what information from the cell state should be passed on to the next step in the network.  It carefully selects and shares only the necessary information.</li></ul><p>This intricate system allows LSTMs to remember information for extended periods, even across long sequences, making them adept at handling complex patterns. Imagine remembering the beginning of a long sentence while processing the end; an LSTM can do this effectively.</p><p><strong>GRU: A Simpler, Yet Powerful Alternative</strong></p><p>The GRU, a more recent innovation, simplifies the LSTM architecture by combining the forget and input gates into a single \"update gate.\" This makes GRUs computationally less expensive and faster to train than LSTMs, while still retaining impressive performance in many applications. While less complex, GRUs still possess the ability to selectively remember and forget information, effectively learning long-range dependencies.</p><p><strong>The Significance and Impact</strong></p><p>The ability to effectively process sequential data has revolutionized several fields. LSTMs and GRUs are responsible for many breakthroughs in:</p><ul><li><strong>Natural Language Processing (NLP):</strong>  Machine translation, sentiment analysis, text summarization, and chatbot development all benefit significantly from these architectures.  They allow for a deeper understanding of context and meaning in text.</li><li>  Accurately transcribing spoken language, even in noisy environments, is made possible by the ability of LSTMs and GRUs to model the temporal dynamics of speech.</li><li>  Predicting future values based on historical data, whether it's stock prices, weather patterns, or energy consumption, is enhanced by these networks' capacity for long-term memory.</li><li>  Understanding and classifying actions within video sequences relies heavily on these architectures' ability to process temporal information.</li></ul><p><strong>Challenges, Limitations, and Ethical Considerations</strong></p><p>Despite their power, LSTMs and GRUs face challenges:</p><ul><li> Training these models, especially on large datasets, can be computationally expensive and time-consuming.</li><li><strong>Vanishing/Exploding Gradients:</strong>  While mitigated compared to basic RNNs, the problem of gradients becoming too small or too large during training can still hinder performance.</li><li> Understanding  an LSTM or GRU makes a particular prediction can be difficult, hindering trust and accountability in certain applications.</li><li>  If the training data contains biases, the model will learn and perpetuate those biases, leading to unfair or discriminatory outcomes.  Careful data curation and bias mitigation techniques are crucial.</li></ul><p><strong>Looking Ahead: The Future of LSTMs and GRUs</strong></p><p>LSTMs and GRUs have undeniably transformed the landscape of AI. While challenges remain, ongoing research focuses on improving their efficiency, interpretability, and robustness. We can expect further advancements in their applications, leading to more sophisticated and impactful AI systems across various industries. The ability to effectively manage and utilize information over time, a core strength of these architectures, will continue to be a cornerstone of future AI development. As we continue to push the boundaries of what's possible with these powerful tools, careful consideration of ethical implications and responsible development will be paramount to ensuring their beneficial application for society.</p>","contentLength":4990,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"📝 Beginner-Friendly Guide \"Minimum Deletions to Make String K-Special\" LeetCode 3085 (C++ | Python | JavaScript)","url":"https://dev.to/om_shree_0709/beginner-friendly-guide-minimum-deletions-to-make-string-k-special-leetcode-3085-c-python-2dn7","date":1750469113,"author":"Om Shree","guid":163949,"unread":true,"content":"<p> |  | <strong>Greedy + Frequency Analysis</strong></p><ul><li>A string  consisting of lowercase letters.</li></ul><p>A string is  if for every pair of characters ,  in the string:</p><div><pre><code>|freq(word[i]) - freq(word[j])| &lt;= k\n</code></pre></div><p>Your task is to <strong>minimize the number of deletions</strong> required to make  k-special.</p><p>To make a string k-special, the difference between the <strong>maximum and minimum frequency</strong> of any two letters should be ≤ .</p><ul><li>Count the frequency of each character.</li><li>Try to  frequencies around every possible frequency value.</li><li>For each candidate frequency , adjust higher values to be ≤ , and remove characters with frequency less than  completely.</li></ul><p>This problem becomes a greedy scan over frequency values to find the configuration with .</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><ul><li>Frequencies are sorted for easier range-based analysis.</li><li>Try making every valid  the base frequency.</li><li>If any frequency is too large, trim it down; if too small, delete it.</li><li>Time Complexity: O(26^2) ~= O(1)</li></ul><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><ul><li>The power of  and .</li><li>How to turn a \"global condition\" (equalizing freq) into a  via range loops.</li></ul><ul><li>Frequency array manipulation</li><li>Greedy analysis on sorted data</li></ul><p>Drop a ❤️ if this helped, and stay tuned for more algorithm insights and optimizations!</p>","contentLength":1120,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Build Your Own Local License Server for Popular Software (Windows Setup Guide)","url":"https://dev.to/roman_muslikhov_2ab4ae3a2/build-your-own-local-license-server-for-popular-software-windows-setup-guide-4omk","date":1750460498,"author":"Roman Muslikhov","guid":163921,"unread":true,"content":"<blockquote><p>Full version originally published on <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/verification-server-roman-muslikhov-4l7tc/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">LinkedIn</a></p></blockquote><p>In today’s digital ecosystem...</p>","contentLength":78,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Query YAML Like a Database — Why I Built YamlQL (And How It Works)","url":"https://dev.to/sarav_ak/query-yaml-like-a-database-why-i-built-yamlql-and-how-it-works-4hfg","date":1750456978,"author":"Sarav AK","guid":163899,"unread":true,"content":"<p>Have you ever tried to grep through large set of Kubernetes YAML files just to figure out which pods are missing CPU limits?</p><p>So I built <a href=\"https://github.com/AKSarav/YamlQL/tree/main\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">YamlQL</a> — a tool that lets you query YAML files using SQL.</p><p>YAMLQL has three mode of opeartions</p><ul><li>Discover the schema of your YAML file</li><li>Run manual SQL queries over YAML</li><li>Use AI to generate SQL (schema-aware, no data sent)</li></ul><p>YamlQL is a CLI + Python tool that converts YAML into DuckDB tables, so you can query it like a database.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  😵‍💫 YAML is beautiful until it is not\n</h3><p>YAML is beautiful for humans to write — but a nightmare to audit or analyze at scale.

Whether you are using tools like Claude Desktop, ChatGPT, Cursor, Cline, Postman, you name it; If a developer can plug in an MCP to it, they will. Having built a number of MCP servers recently at <a href=\"https://airbyte.io\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Airbyte</a>, and running my own side hustle at <a href=\"https://mycaminoguide.com\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">mycaminoguide.com</a> as an AI agent for the past year, I've learned a few things about what it really takes to build and run MCP servers. </p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Know the main components of an MCP server.\n</h3><p>This might sound obvious, but knowing the main components of an MCP server is incredibly helpful as you build your own. It gives you a roadmap on what and how you want to implement services, and will save you significant time trying to custom code your own solutions when you should have used native MCP decorators and support.</p><ul><li>\nTools are functions clients can call to perform an action. Tools are what show up in something like Cursor. When designing an MCP, I typically start by thinking about the domain I want to work in. eg: functions a developer needs when working with my product, or calendar functions etc. From there I have a scope and can decide what actaul functions are available. If I find I am exceeding the domain, I typically create a separate MCP server. </li></ul><ul><li>\nResources allow your client to return specific data based on parameters. Resources are very helpful if your MCP service is going to perform some sort of query on a backend system. eg: My MCP offers a calendar service and I want to pass in a particular date to get availability.\n</li></ul><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><ul><li>\nPrompts are messages templates that include parameterized values that you can pass to an LLM to perform a query. I use prompts extensively within the PyAirbyte MCP server to allow the user to specify source and destination connectors. The MCP server then uses a consistent prompt and the OpenAI chat completion API to query the vector store for highly relevant results.</li></ul><h2>\n  \n  \n  Understand the Transports\n</h2><p>Clients support different transports depending on your deployment model. </p><p>If you are running locally, the transport is going to be stdio. Effectively, you configuring your mcp to execute a shell command to run a local file. I use stdio MCP services that I have built to help me automate frequent daily tasks such as checking the health of pipelines, looking at usage analytics, slack summaries etc from within Claude Desktop. I wouldn't recommend stdio for broader developer community facing tools. There is too much local config that the user needs to manage.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Server Sent Events, or SSE, is the original transport for remote MCP servers. MCP servers built using this model require you to run a server such as Express or FastMCP to serve endpoints, both a POST and GET. Remote servers in general are not supported by Claude Desktop, but are supported in Cursor and Cline, although there are limitations, which I'll cover shortly. If you are starting to write MCP servers today, I would not recommend using SSE transports as they have been deprecated in favor of Streamable transports.</p><p>Streamable HTTP transports removes the need to create two endpoints - a POST and GET - like you see in SSE transports and are slightly more complex to set up. Once you do have them configured though, there is a lot of benefits through scalability and resumable connections. In addition, they can work stateless meaning you can deploy them quite easily on Vercel vs. SSE services which you need to deploy on something like Railway or Heroku. The downside is that the Streamable HTTP transport is very new with Client tool vendors only now implementing it. There are positive sign though that this transport will become the most dominant. I've already see Claude Code implement a  parameter, for example.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Most of my MCP development is done in python. Thankfully, there is a rich ecosystem of libraries available to that make working with MCP much easier. </p><p>FastMCP is the defacto standard. It is fully spec-compliant, supports streaming transport, and is easily deployed.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>It's been interesting to see OpenAI support a competitors 'standard' (Anthrophic were the original authors of the MCP spec). As a heavy user of the Responses API in mycaminoguide.com, I've been excited to see that <a href=\"https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/tools-remote-mcp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">models can now use MCP servers to perform tasks</a>. Currently the implementation doesn't feel very natural and there it's overly complex but the idea of an agent or model using my MCP server has me watching this space closely. Google is also pushing the same approach with their <a href=\"https://google.github.io/adk-docs/tools/mcp-tools/?utm_source=chatgpt.com#step-3-run-adk-web-and-interact\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Agent SDK</a>. </p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Not all Clients are created equal\n</h2><p>When it client tools such as Claude Desktop, Cline, and Cursor, etc, the level of support for the MCP spec, and how this is represented in the mcp.json a user needs to add to connect a server can often lead to wasted time trying to figure out why an error is being raised. I have not found a centralized place where these differences are listed. Here are the ones I have encountered</p><ul><li>Local MCP server support: Claude Desktop, Cline, Cursor, Claude Code. </li><li>Remote MCP server support: Cline, Cursor, Claude Code</li><li>Remote MCP server passing env in mcp.json: Cursor, Claude Code</li></ul><p>The remote MCP server with support for passing environment variables is a interesting case. For example, we just deployed an MCP server for <a href=\"https://airbyte.com/product/pyairbyte\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">PyAirbyte</a>. This server uses openAI and a vector store to generate data pipelines. It is deployed on Heroku. As part of the client config, we require that you pass in your OpenAI API key. This works great within Cursor, but unfortunately it not supported in Cline. You can, of course, add values to a serverside .env file, but we did not want to do this due to the risk of someone spamming the MCP server and running up a bit OpenAI bill.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>MCP protocols are still evolving. Change is constant and can be frustrating when building services. Sometimes logging errors are not very helpful, and LLMs like ChatGPT often send you down a rabbit hole, only to find out that the spec has changed and the LLM doesn't have the most recent information. Vibe coding MCP servers can be an exercise in frustration. I hope these tips help you get started in building your own MCP servers and avoid some of the pitfalls I made when starting out. </p>","contentLength":6138,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"The Python Coding Stack: I Want to Remove Duplicates from a Python List • How Do I Do It?","url":"https://www.thepythoncodingstack.com/p/remove-duplicates-from-python-list","date":1750444612,"author":"","guid":163807,"unread":true,"content":"<p>Another short article today to figure out ways to remove duplicate values from a list. The ideal solution depends on what you really need.</p><p>Well, we need a list first–ideally, one with duplicate values. So, let's assume we have an online queue (line). But some people put their name in the queue more than once:</p><div><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!GBYN!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1f0fdbcb-7236-4635-9713-4d0459488b9d_1272x168.png\"></a>All code blocks are available in text format at the end of this article • #1 • <em>The code images used in this article are created using <a href=\"https://snappify.cello.so/f4AsFrwgwov\">Snappify</a>. [Affiliate link]</em></div><p>Note how James and Kate were eager to ensure they were in the queue, so they put their name down twice.</p><h2><strong>Removing Duplicates: The Ugly Way</strong></h2><p>I was initially tempted not to include this section, but I changed my mind, as you can see. You can come up with several algorithms to perform this task \"manually\". It's only a few lines of code. Here's one option:</p><p>You have a  empty list ready to collect unique names. Next, you iterate using  and add names to  if they don't appear in the rest of the original list. Note that I'm using <a href=\"https://www.thepythoncodingstack.com/p/a-python-slicing-story\">slicing</a> in the  statement to slice the list from  to the end of the list.</p><p>Let me show you another option. I'll discuss the outputs from these two manual versions later in this article:</p><p>This time, you reverse the list so you can loop through the names in reverse order. The  doesn't start as an empty list this time but as a copy of the original reversed list.</p><p>In the loop, you remove names from  if the name appears later in the reversed list. A reminder that the  list method only removes the first occurrence of an item. It doesn't remove all of them.</p><p>Both algorithms remove duplicates. Great. But compare the output from the two versions. The difference between these output lists gives a clue to what's coming next.</p><p>But I won't dwell on these versions any longer.</p><p><em>and PS: there are better versions of manual algorithms for this, but that's not the point of this first section, so let's move on!</em></p><h2><strong>Removing Duplicates: The Set Way</strong></h2><p>When you learn about data structures, you learn about the various characteristics they have. Then, you start comparing data structures based on these characteristics. For example, lists, dictionaries, tuples, and strings are all <a href=\"https://www.thepythoncodingstack.com/p/python-iterable-data-structures\">iterable</a>. But lists and dictionaries are mutable, whereas tuples and strings are immutable. And lists, tuples, and strings are all <a href=\"https://www.thepythoncodingstack.com/p/sequences-in-python-data-structure-2\">sequences</a>, but dictionaries are not–they're <a href=\"https://www.thepythoncodingstack.com/p/mappings-in-python-data-structure-3\">mappings</a>. You can read more about some of these categories here: <a href=\"https://www.thepythoncodingstack.com/p/the-main-data-structure-categories\">The Python Data Structure Categories Series</a></p><p>And some data structures enforce uniqueness while others don't. Lists, as you've seen above, can have several equal items–in the example above, you have several strings that are equal to each other.</p><p>However, sets are a Python data structure that can only have unique values:</p><p>So, the easiest way to remove duplicates from a list is to cast it into a set:</p><p>Or, if you prefer the output to still be a list, and perhaps you also want to overwrite the original variable name, then you can write the following:</p><p>Now, that was easy! Much better than the several lines of code in the previous section.</p><p>However, there's an issue. If this is a queue of customers, then the order in which they joined the queue is somewhat important, I would say!</p><p>Note how the new  list, the one without duplicates, no longer maintains the original order of the people within it. James was the first to join the queue, but Andy appears to have moved to the front when you removed duplicates.</p><p>Note that this also happened with the first of the manual algorithms in the previous section.</p><p>Sometimes, you don't care about the order of the elements in a list. If that's the case, you can cast the list into a set and then back into a list to remove duplicates.</p><p>But sometimes, the order matters. It certainly matters when dealing with a queue of customers. Let's look at another option.</p><h2><strong>Removing Duplicates: The Dictionary Way</strong></h2><p>If you haven't, now is a good time to read it. Like this one, it's a short article, so it won't take you too long.</p><p>So, you now know that since Python 3.7, there's a guarantee that the order of insertion of items in a dictionary is maintained. And dictionary keys must also be unique–you cannot have the same key appear twice in a dictionary.</p><p>Therefore, if you could create a dictionary from the elements in the list , you would remove duplicates but also maintain the order. And there's a dictionary class method for that:</p><p>You create a dictionary from the list . The items in the list become keys, and each key has a default value of . You can customise this default value, but you don't need to in this case, as you'll see in the next paragraph.</p><p>Great, you removed duplicates while maintaining order since dictionaries maintain order. The dictionary is created by iterating through the list, which explains why this version maintains the order of the items. But you don't want a dictionary, and you don't care about the values within it. So, you can cast this dictionary back into a list. You only keep the keys when you cast a dictionary into a list:</p><p>You've now removed duplicates from the list  maintained the original order by converting the list into a dictionary and then back into a list.</p><p>Simple–once you know this idiom.</p><p><em>Do you want to join a forum to discuss Python further with other Pythonistas?

Your support will help me keep this content coming regularly and, importantly, will help keep it free for everyone.</em></p><p>Both the set and dictionary routes have an important limitation. Items in a set must be hashable objects. And keys in a dictionary must also be hashable. Therefore, you can't use these techniques if you have a list that includes non-hashable objects, such as a list that contains other lists.</p><p>You may need to remove duplicates from a list in Python.</p><p>Don't write your own algorithm. Life's too short for that.</p><p>If you don't care about the order of the items in the list, cast the list into a set and then back into a list: </p><p>If you  care about the order, create a dictionary from the list using  and then cast it back into a list: <code>list(dict.fromkeys(queue))</code>.</p><p>And the set and dictionary routes to removing duplicates are also more efficient than the manual ones shown above.

In reality, they are your proactive sidekicks that can streamline complex workflows and eliminate repetitive tasks. Think of them as the next evolutionary step beyond chatbots: they do not just simply wait for prompts; they , coordinate multiple steps, and adapt as they go.</p><p>Back in the day, crafting a “smart” system meant juggling separate models for language understanding, code generation, data lookup, you name it, and then duct-taping them together. Half of your time used to vanish in integration hell, whereas the other half you spent debugging the glue.</p><p>Agents flip that script. They bundle context, initiative, and adaptability into a single orchestrated flow. It is not just automation; it is intelligence with a mission. And thanks to such frameworks as , assembling an agent squad of your own can actually be… dare I say, fun?  </p><h2>\n  \n  \n  What Is LangGraph, Exactly?\n</h2><p>LangGraph is an innovative framework that revolutionizes the way we build complex applications involving Large Language Models (LLMs).</p><p>Imagine that you are conducting an orchestra: every instrument (or “node”) needs to know when to play, how loud, and in what sequence.  in this case** is your baton, giving you the following:</p><ul><li>: It employs a graph-like structure with nodes and edges, enabling developers to design flexible, non-linear workflows that accommodate branches and loops. It mirrors complex decision-making processes resembling the way neural pathways might work.\n</li><li>: LangGraph offers built-in tools for state persistence and error recovery, simplifying the maintenance of contextual data across various stages within an application. It can effectively switch between short-term and long-term memory, enhancing interaction quality thanks to such tools as Zep.\n</li><li>: With LangGraph, LLM agents can easily collaborate with external services or databases to fetch real-world data, improving the functionality and responsiveness of your applications.\n</li><li>: Beyond automation, LangGraph accommodates human interventions in workflows, which are crucial for decision-making processes that require analytical oversight or ethical consideration.</li></ul><p>Whether you are building a chatbot with real memory, an interactive story engine, or a team of agents tackling a complex problem, LangGraph turns headache-inducing plumbing into a clean, visual state machine.</p><p>To start with LangGraph, you will need a basic setup that typically involves installing such essential libraries as langgraph and langchain-openai. From there, you can define the nodes (tasks) and edges (connections) within the graph, effectively implementing checkpoints for short-term memory and utilizing Zep for more persistent memory needs.</p><p>When operating LangGraph, keep in mind the following:</p><ul><li>: Leverage the powerful graph structure to account for potential workflow branches and interactions that are not strictly linear.\n</li><li><strong>Interact with Tools Thoughtfully</strong>: Enhance but do not replace LLM capabilities with external tools. Provide each tool with comprehensive descriptions to enable precise usage.\n</li><li><strong>Employ Rich Memory Solutions</strong>: Use memory efficiently, be mindful of the LLM's context window, and consider integrating external solutions for automatic fact management.</li></ul><p>Now that we have covered the basics of LangGraph, let's dive into a practical example. To achieve this, we will develop an AI agent specifically designed for customer support.</p><p>This agent will receive email requests, analyze the problem description in the email body, and then determine the request's priority and appropriate topic/category/sector.</p><p>So buckle up and let's go!</p><p>To begin, we need to define what a 'Tool' is. You can think of it as a specialized \"assistant manager\" for your agent, allowing it to interact with external functionalities.</p><p>The  decorator is essential here. LangChain simplifies custom tool creation, meaning that first, you define a Python function, and then apply the  decorator.</p><p>Let's illustrate this by creating our first tool. This tool will help the agent classify the priority of an IT support ticket based on its email content:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Excellent! Now we have a prompt that instructs the AI to receive the email body, analyze it, and classify its priority as High, Medium, or Low.</p><p>That’s it! You have just composed a tool your agent can call!</p><p>Next, let's create a similar tool to identify the main topic (or category) of the support request:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Now we need to create a state, and in LangGraph this little piece is, kind of, a big deal.</p><p>Think of it as the central nervous system of your graph. It is how nodes talk to each other, passing notes like overachievers in class.</p><p>“A state is a shared data structure that represents the current snapshot of your application.”</p><p>In practice? The state is a structured message that moves between nodes. It carries the output of one step as the input for the next one. Basically, it is the glue that holds your entire workflow together.</p><p>Therefore, before constructing the graph, we must first define the structure of our state. In this example, our state will include the following:</p><ul><li>The user’s request (email body)\n</li><li>The identified topic (category)</li></ul><p>It is simple and clean, so you can move through the graph like a pro.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><h2>\n  \n  \n  Nodes vs. Edges: Key Components of LangGraph\n</h2><p>The fundamental building blocks of LangGraph include  and </p><ul><li>: They are the operational units within the graph, performing the actual work. A node typically consists of Python code that can execute any logic, ranging from computations to interactions with language models (LLMs) or external integrations. Essentially, nodes are like individual functions or agents in traditional programming.\n</li><li>: Edges define the flow of execution between nodes, determining what happens next. They act as the connectors that allow the state to transition from one node to another based on predefined conditions. In the context of LangGraph, edges are crucial in orchestrating the sequence and decision flow between nodes.</li></ul><p>To grasp the functionality of edges, let’s consider a simple analogy of a messaging application:</p><ul><li> are akin to users (or their devices) actively participating in a conversation.\n</li><li> symbolize the chat threads or connections between users that facilitate communication.</li></ul><p>When a user selects a chat thread to send a message, an edge is effectively created, linking them to another user. Each interaction, be it sending a text, voice, or video message, follows a predefined sequence, comparable to the structured schema of LangGraph’s state. It ensures uniformity and interpretability of data passed along edges.</p><p>Unlike the dynamic nature of event-driven applications, LangGraph employs a static schema that remains consistent throughout execution. It simplifies communication among nodes, enabling developers to rely on a stable state format, thereby ensuring seamless edge communication.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Designing a Basic Workflow\n</h2><p>Flow engineering in LangGraph can be conceptualized as designing a state machine. In this paradigm, each node represents a distinct state or processing step, while edges define the transitions between those states. This approach is particularly beneficial for developers aiming to strike a balance between deterministic task sequences and the dynamic decision-making capabilities of AI. Let's begin constructing our flow by initializing a StateGraph with the TicketState class we defined earlier.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>: Nodes are fundamental building blocks, defined to execute such specific tasks as classifying ticket priority or identifying its topic.</p><p>Each node function receives the current state, performs its operation, and returns a dictionary to update the state:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>The classify_priority_node and identify_topic_node methods will change the TicketState and send the parameter input.</p><p>: Define edges to connect nodes:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>The classify_priority establishes the start, whereas the identify_topic determines the end of our workflow so far.</p><p><strong>Compilation and Execution</strong>:  Once nodes and edges are configured, compile the workflow and execute it.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Great! You can also generate a visual representation of our LangGraph flow.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>If you were to run the code up to this point, you would observe a graph similar to the one below:</p><p>This illustration visualizes a sequential execution: start, followed by classifying priority, then identifying the topic, and, finally, ending.</p><p>One of the most powerful aspects of LangGraph is its flexibility, which allows us to create more complex flows and applications. For instance, we can modify the workflow to add edges from START to both nodes with the following line:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>This change will imply that the agent executes classify_priority and identify_topic simultaneously.</p><p>Another highly valuable feature in LangGraph is the ability to use conditional edges. They allow the workflow to branch based on the evaluation of the current state, enabling dynamic routing of tasks.</p><p>Let's enhance our workflow. We will create a new tool that analyzes the content, priority, and topic of the request to determine whether it is a high-priority issue requiring escalation (i.e., opening a ticket for a human team). If not, an automated response will be generated for the user.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Furthermore, if the request is determined to be of low or medium priority (leading to an \"auto_respond\" decision), we will perform a vector search to retrieve historical answers. This information will then be used to generate an appropriate automated response. However, it will require two additional tools:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Now, let's define the corresponding nodes for those new tools:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>The conditional edge will then use the output of the make_decision node to direct the flow:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>If the make_escalation_decision tool (via decision_node) results in \"auto_respond\", the workflow will proceed through the rag node (to retrieve examples), then to generate_reply (to craft the response), and finally to execute_action (to log the auto-response).</p><p>Conversely, if the decision is \"escalate\", the flow will bypass the RAG and take generation steps, moving directly to execute_action to handle the escalation. To complete the graph by adding the remaining standard edges, do the following:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><blockquote><p> For this project, the dataset we used to power the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) was sourced from the <a href=\"https://huggingface.co/datasets/Tobi-Bueck/customer-support-tickets\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Customer Support Tickets dataset on Hugging Face</a>. The dataset was filtered to include exclusively the items categorized as  and restricted to  entries. It ensured that the RAG system retrieved only highly relevant and domain-specific examples for technical support tasks.</p></blockquote><p>At this point, our graph should resemble the one below:</p><p>When you execute this graph with an email that results in a high priority classification and an \"escalate\" decision, you will see the following response:</p><p>At the same time, a request that is classified as low priority and results in an \"auto_respond\" decision will trigger a reply resembling the one below:</p><p>Not entirely. There a few bumps to watch out for:</p><ul><li> Be careful with sensitive info — these agents require guardrails.\n</li><li> Some advanced setups require serious resources.\n</li><li> LLMs can occasionally make things up (still smarter than most interns, though).\n</li><li> The same input might return different outputs, which is great for creativity, but tricky for strict processes.</li></ul><p>However, most of these weak spots can be managed with good planning, the right tools, and — you guessed it — a bit of reflection.</p><p>LangGraph turns AI agents from buzzwords into real, working solutions. Whether you want to automate customer support, handle IT tickets, or build autonomous apps, this framework makes it doable and, actually, enjoyable.</p><p>Have you got any questions or feedback?

I didn’t expect to enjoy a calculus book this much. Shocking, I know. But that’s exactly what happened with .</p><p>Can calculus feel intuitive? Even fun? From the first few pages? For me, the answer was yes. (Okay, from page 8 to be&nbsp;exact.)</p><p><strong>Why This Book Clicked for&nbsp;Me</strong></p><p>As part of <a href=\"https://newsletter.ruslanspivak.com/p/im-back-math-ai-and-me\">my self-study</a>, I’m reviewing select chapters from the books I work through. This post covers Chapter 1 of  by Seth&nbsp;Braver.</p><p>Before I stumbled on , I tried a few limit-based calculus books and textbooks, but none of them spoke to me. Luckily, there’s no shortage of calculus material these days, so it’s easy to shop around and try different&nbsp;sources.</p><p>Braver’s book grabbed me right away. The early focus on infinitesimals, the tight writing, and the emphasis on intuition won me over. I even caught myself smiling more than once. Rare for a math&nbsp;book.</p><p>Chapter 1 starts with : “an infinitely small number, smaller than any positive real number, yet greater than zero.” One early example shows how a circle, imagined as a polygon with infinitely many infinitesimal sides, leads to the familiar area formula πr². If your geometry or trig is rusty, don’t worry - it still makes sense. Braver then uses the same idea to show how curves appear straight on a small enough (infinitesimal) scale, which is the heart of differential&nbsp;calculus.</p><p>Things really clicked for me in the section titled <em>A Gift From Leibniz: d-Notation</em>. Braver’s explanation of  shows how it captures infinitesimal change in a way that just makes sense. It helped me understand why derivatives represent slopes and rates in a way I could explain to a 10-year-old. Working through the derivative of x² from first principles was also deeply&nbsp;satisfying. </p><p>Practically speaking, Chapter 1&nbsp;covers:</p><ul><li>how they help us define rates of&nbsp;change</li><li>the geometric meaning of&nbsp;derivatives</li><li>the elegant dy/dx notation from&nbsp;Leibniz</li><li>why we ignore higher-order infinitesimals like (dx)² or du *&nbsp;dv</li><li>and a first-principles derivation of the derivative of&nbsp;x² </li></ul><p>The chapter ends with two powerful tools: the power rule and linearity properties. These let you compute derivatives of polynomials using just basic mental&nbsp;math.</p><p>The writing is sharp and often funny, in a math kind of way. There’s even a cameo by the Sumerian beer goddess Ninkasi, who helps explain rate of change and derivatives using a vat of beer. It sounds quirky, but it&nbsp;works.</p><p>The book’s style, clarity, and focus on intuition made me want to keep going.

It’s not always light reading, and the exercises are essential, but it might click for you like it did for me. <a href=\"https://www.bravernewmath.com/\">Chapter 1 is available for free on the author’s site</a>, so you can explore it before deciding whether to dive&nbsp;in. </p><p>If you do decide to dive into the book, here are a few tips to get the most out of&nbsp;it:</p><ol><li>If you’re rusty on pre-calculus (I was), make sure you’ve got slope, rate of change, the point-slope formula, and the slope-intercept form down cold before the  section on page 10. For that, Seth Braver’s other book <em>Precalculus Made Difficult</em> has excellent material on those topics. You can probably get through it in a&nbsp;day.</li><li>Read slowly, with a pen or pencil in hand. Write in the margins (get a paperback copy). It might feel painfully slow at times (pun intended), but it’s a recipe for deeper&nbsp;understanding.</li><li>The book includes answers to many exercises and is great for self-study. But the solutions are compact, so I recommend using Grok or ChatGPT to expand on them and deepen your&nbsp;understanding.</li><li>Once you’ve finished the chapter and exercises, check out <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLFFekKQwSI_1q-qGq1WLSxw3oGfXXzAeH\">the author’s YouTube videos</a> that go along with the book. They’re criminally underrated and oddly hard to find. You might enjoy them as much as I&nbsp;do. </li><li>For topics that are hard to retain, try spaced repetition with active recall. Anki works great for that, or use whatever tool you&nbsp;prefer.</li></ol><p>\nChapter 1 sealed the deal. This is the calculus book I’m sticking with. Looking forward to seeing how Braver develops the ideas from&nbsp;here.</p><p>More to come. Stay&nbsp;tuned.</p><p> I’m not affiliated with the author. I just really enjoy the book and wanted to share&nbsp;it.</p>","contentLength":4455,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Unlocking Unprecedented Benefits with AI-Powered Web Applications.","url":"https://dev.to/sparkout/unlocking-unprecedented-benefits-with-ai-powered-web-applications-gpo","date":1750424306,"author":"AI Development Company","guid":163526,"unread":true,"content":"<p>In the relentless march of digital evolution, web applications have transitioned from static information hubs to dynamic, interactive platforms.

In Glitch Runner, the \"glitches\" are random and require the player to adjust to a new situation every few seconds. </p><p>Every effect changes the difficulty the game plays and can turn the precision platforming into a creative way of parkouring through the glitches.

Actually, it works really well, especially when you've got libraries like web3.py doing the heavy lifting.</p><p>I spent way too much time at the beginning trying to figure out how to connect my Python backend to blockchain networks. Turns out, once you get past the initial setup hurdles, it's surprisingly straightforward.</p><p>If you’re a Python dev curious about crypto, or working on a backend that needs to talk to a blockchain, this guide is for you.</p><p>Imagine your blockchain network as a complex smart home, filled with devices like smart lights, thermostats, and security cameras. Each device understands a unique, complicated set of signals.  Controlling them manually would be chaos.</p><p>Now imagine having one remote that works with everything. You press \"lights on\" and it figures out the exact signals to send. That's basically what web3.py does for blockchain interaction.</p><p>Without it, you'd be manually crafting JSON-RPC requests (which I definitely tried at first - not fun). With it, you write normal Python code and let the library handle all that network protocol stuff behind the scenes.</p><p><strong>What Actually Is web3.py?</strong></p><p>It's a Python library that translates your regular Python commands into the JSON-RPC calls that Ethereum nodes understand. Remember those RPC requests we talked about before? This library handles all of that for you.</p><p>So instead of manually constructing this:</p><blockquote><p>{\"jsonrpc\": \"2.0\", \"method\": \"eth_blockNumber\", \"params\": [], \"id\": 1}</p></blockquote><p>With web3.py you can query data, send transactions, and interact with smart contracts, all with clean Python code.</p><p><strong>Getting Started: Installation and Setup</strong></p><p>Let's get this thing working. First, the usual Python project setup:</p><div><pre><code>mkdir my-web3-app\ncd my-web3-app\npython3 -m venv venv\nsource venv/bin/activate  # Windows: venv\\Scripts\\activate\npip install web3 python-dotenv\n</code></pre></div><p><strong>Connecting to an Ethereum Node (Your RPC Provider)</strong></p><p>Here's where I got stuck initially. To talk to any blockchain, you need to connect to a node. These are computers running blockchain software that maintain copies of the ledger.</p><p>You've got two main options:</p><p>*<em>1: Use a service like Infura or Alchemy *</em></p><p>These companies run blockchain nodes for you. Sign up, get an API key, and you're connected to the real Ethereum network. Great for production</p><p>How to get one: Sign up for a free account at Infura.io](<a href=\"https://www.infura.io/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://www.infura.io/</a>) or <a href=\"https://www.alchemy.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Alchemy.com</a>. Create a new project for the Ethereum Mainnet or a testnet (e.g., Sepolia) and copy your HTTP endpoint URL.</p><p>*<em>2: Run your own local blockchain *</em></p><p>When I first started, I didn’t know this was a thing. I was constantly hunting for testnet faucets and hitting request limits. Then I discovered Ganache.</p><p>It spins up a personal Ethereum blockchain on your machine. Perfect for local testing, and it gives you free ETH (fake, of course).</p><p>For this tutorial, we're going with Option 2 using Ganache. Trust me on this one - it'll save you so much hassle while learning.</p><p>\n          * Download <a href=\"https://trufflesuite.com/ganache/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Ganache Desktop</a> (easiest for beginners).\n          * Install it and launch. It will automatically start a local blockchain with pre-funded accounts and display its RPC server address (usually ).</p><p>If you're having trouble setting it up, check this put</p><p>If you use local you can get your url here in Gananche once you've installed it.</p><p><strong>Keeping Your Secrets Safe</strong></p><p>Before we write any code, let's set up environment variables. Create a .env file in your project folder:</p><div><pre><code># .env\nRPC_URL=\"http://127.0.0.1:7545\"\n\n# Later, when you want to use Infura:\n# RPC_URL=\"https://mainnet.infura.io/v3/YOUR_PROJECT_ID\"\n</code></pre></div><p>And add this to a .gitignore file so you don't accidentally commit your API keys:</p><p>Now for the actual Python code. Create app.py:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Run it with python app.py. If Ganache is running, you should see the success message.</p><p>If you've set up Ganache and it's running, you should see <code>✅ Successfully connected...</code>. If you use Infura, you'll see a similar message.</p><p><strong>Actually Reading From the Blockchain</strong></p><p>Now comes the fun part. Let's ask the blockchain some questions:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Run  again, and you'll see all this blockchain data printed to your console!</p><p>You probably noticed all those w3.from_wei() calls. Here's the deal: Ethereum uses really tiny units internally to avoid floating-point math errors.</p><ul><li>1 ETH = 1,000,000,000,000,000,000 wei (that's 18 zeros)</li><li>1 ETH = 1,000,000,000 gwei (9 zeros)</li></ul><p>So when the blockchain returns 20000000000, that's actually 20 gwei, not 20 ETH. The conversion functions save you from doing that math yourself.</p><p><strong>What You Just Accomplished</strong></p><p>Pretty cool, right? You just:</p><p>Connected Python to a blockchain network</p><ul><li>Queried live blockchain data</li><li>Handled the weird unit conversions automatically</li><li>Did it all with clean, readable Python code</li></ul><p>No manual JSON-RPC construction, no hex encoding/decoding headaches, no network protocol debugging. Just Python talking to blockchain.</p><p>Next time, we're going to deploy and interact with smart contracts. That's where things get really interesting - calling functions, sending transactions, handling events.</p><p>But first, play around with this code.</p><blockquote><p>Quick troubleshooting: If Ganache won't start, check if port 7545 is already in use. If you're getting connection errors, make sure your .env file is in the right directory and the RPC_URL is uncommented.</p></blockquote>","contentLength":5281,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Build a Simple Number Guessing Game in Python 🎯 (Beginner Friendly)","url":"https://dev.to/nasakib143/build-a-simple-number-guessing-game-in-python-beginner-friendly-2ji","date":1750408757,"author":"Tasib","guid":163380,"unread":true,"content":"<p>Here’s a fun and beginner-friendly project: a  using Python! 🎯</p><ul><li>Randomly picks a number between 1 and 100</li><li>7,5,3 attempts(based on your level) to guess the correct number</li><li>Friendly feedback: 📉 Too low / 📈 Too high</li><li>Tells you if your guess is too high or too low</li><li>Includes input validation and emojis for fun!</li></ul><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><ul><li>Add a “Play Again” option</li></ul><p>Hope this helps fellow learners! 💻✨<p>\nFeel free to fork and improve!</p><p>\nLeave a comment if you built something similar 😊</p></p>","contentLength":461,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Crafting Perfect Cold Messages: My AI-Powered Streamlit App Journey 🧊","url":"https://dev.to/asutoshk_09/crafting-perfect-cold-messages-my-ai-powered-streamlit-app-journey-4i36","date":1750401644,"author":"Asutosh Kataruka","guid":163336,"unread":true,"content":"<p>The digital world thrives on connections, and often, those connections start with a \"cold\" message.

You simply upload your resume in PDF format using the designated file uploader.</li></ul><p>Once your resume is uploaded, the application immediately gets to work behind the scenes:</p><ul><li> The system rapidly extracts all textual content from your PDF resume.</li><li> Simultaneously, it scans the extracted text for any visible URLs.</li></ul><h3>\n  \n  \n  Step 2: Intelligent Link Classification &amp; Summarization 🧠\n</h3><p>This is where the AI and smart processing truly shine, transforming raw data into actionable insights.</p><ul><li><strong>Hidden Link Classification:</strong> Beyond simple extraction, the app employs a specialized utility that goes through the discovered links. It intelligently classifies ambiguous or \"hidden\" links, ensuring that your LinkedIn, GitHub, and personal portfolio URLs are correctly identified and categorized, ready for easy inclusion in your message.</li><li><strong>AI-Powered Resume Summarization:</strong> The full text of your resume is then sent to an advanced LLM. This AI model doesn't just condense text; it analyzes your experience and skills to generate a concise, professional, and impactful summary. This summary is automatically populated into a dedicated text area on the screen, ready for your review. This feature saves you the significant effort of crafting a summary from scratch.</li></ul><p>At this point, you'll see the AI-generated summary and any automatically detected and classified links pre-filled into input fields, allowing you to easily review and make any minor adjustments or add links if they weren't detected.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Step 3: Message Tailoring &amp; Template Generation ✍️\n</h3><p>With your profile data processed, you guide the AI in crafting the perfect message.</p><ul><li> You select the desired message type from a dropdown, such as \"Cold Email,\" \"LinkedIn Message,\" or \"Other,\" indicating the communication channel.</li><li> You input the specific job title or role you're targeting (e.g., \"Software Engineer,\" \"Data Scientist\"). This critical piece of information allows the AI to tailor the message's content directly to the context of that role.</li><li> With a simple click of the \"Generate Template\" button, the application sends all your prepared inputs – the refined resume summary, your social links, the chosen message type, and the target job type – back to the LLM.</li></ul><p>The AI then processes this comprehensive input to produce a customized message template. This template is designed for immediate use and includes dynamic placeholders, specifically  and .</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Step 4: Final Personalization &amp; Send-Ready Message ✨\n</h3><p>The last mile of customization is in your hands, leading to a complete, ready-to-send message.</p><ul><li> You'll see dedicated input fields where you simply type in the specific recipient's name and the company's name for your current outreach.</li><li> Upon clicking \"Generate Message,\" the application seamlessly substitutes your entered recipient and company names into the template's placeholders.</li></ul><p>The result is a fully formatted, personalized message displayed in a large text area, ready for you to copy and paste directly into your email client or LinkedIn message window. This entire process significantly reduces manual effort, allowing you to scale your outreach while maintaining a personalized touch.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Why Groq &amp; Streamlit? (Under the Hood Efficiency)\n</h2><ul><li> The choice of Groq's API for the LLM inference is crucial. Its Language Processing Units (LPUs) provide incredible speed, making the AI summarization and message generation almost instantaneous. This eliminates frustrating wait times, providing a snappy user experience that truly saves time.</li><li><strong>Streamlit's User-Friendliness:</strong> For building interactive Python web applications, Streamlit is a fantastic choice. Its simplicity allowed me to focus primarily on the core AI logic and user workflow, rather than getting bogged down in complex web development frameworks.</li><li> Leveraging libraries like LangChain helps orchestrate the LLM calls and ensures structured outputs. Pydantic schemas enforce data consistency, guaranteeing that the AI's responses are always in the expected format, leading to reliable processing at every step.</li></ul><p>I'm always thinking about how to make this tool even better:</p><ul><li> Introducing options for networking events, informational interview requests, and more diverse outreach scenarios.</li><li> Allowing users to specify the desired tone (e.g., formal, friendly, direct, assertive) for their messages.</li><li><strong>ATS Keyword Optimization:</strong> Integrating functionality to analyze job descriptions and suggest relevant keywords to include in the message for Applicant Tracking System (ATS) compatibility.</li><li> Exploring options for simple export functionality to popular Customer Relationship Management (CRM) tools.</li></ul><p>Ready to automate your outreach and make impactful first impressions?</p><p>I'm keen to hear your feedback, suggestions, or ideas for future improvements!

Yes, you heard that right. I have no formal software engineering education, and my only past experience was a bit of HTML and PHP. But right now, I have a software project with 85% test coverage, a benchmark dashboard, and over 310 pytest test cases, featuring a custom compression engine: .</p><p>So how did I achieve this?</p><p>🤖 <strong>My Team: ChatGPT + GitHub Copilot</strong></p><p>Before starting this project, I had been interested in software development for years but always stayed one step away. Everything began about a month ago when a friend showed me GitHub Copilot. \"You don't have to write code,\" he said, \"just tell it what you want to do.\"</p><p>I took this seriously. My goal became creating a modern, open-source alternative to WinRAR. That's how Pagonic was born.</p><p>My initial plans were very simple. Plain .txt files with basic headings:</p><ul><li>Step 1: Set up test infrastructure\n</li></ul><p>But then my friend  showed me his planning examples. Plans with emojis, headers, graphics. That's when I realized something: Software development isn't just about code—it's also about organization, design, and strategy. Inspired by these examples, I created 12 main planning files. Each worked like a sprint, with steps, sub-headers, platform targets, and performance metrics.</p><p>I first showed these plans to ChatGPT for analysis, then created my own version. Then I fed this plan to Copilot to generate code. I tested the generated code, got feedback, and reorganized. This cycle—Plan &gt; Generate &gt; Test &gt; Improve—is still ongoing.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  🛠️ <strong>Development Process: Planning &gt; Testing &gt; Code</strong></h2><p>I ran the project not with the classic \"write code first, fix later\" approach, but entirely planning-centered. My plans included user scenarios, sprint days, module targets, and other details. Every day, I aimed for small but meaningful progress.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  🔬 <strong>Phase 1: Test Infrastructure</strong></h2><p>I spent the first 2 weeks just writing infrastructure files like ,  and creating their tests. With files like , I increased test coverage from 12% to 85%. During this time, I established the software's testing architecture. I had to be able to test the code before understanding its behavior. This testing architecture gave me confidence. Now I was ready to move on to the compression engine.</p><p>Here's an example of the registry system I built:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>When developing the ZIP module, I created daily sprint plans. I progressed step by step each day. I first wrote the compression engine, then included parts like entropy control, performance monitoring, and buffer management. At each step, I consulted ChatGPT and guided Copilot. But the most challenging step was \"Day 5, Step 4.\" When ChatGPT's AI-assisted optimization strategies combined with Copilot, the  file exceeded 3000+ lines. Copilot was now reversing operations and couldn't scan the code from scratch. Finally, I completely rolled back that day, replanned, and re-implemented it in a modular way.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  😳 <strong>My Embarrassing Oversight: The Forgotten Half</strong></h2><p>Here's where I have to admit something really embarrassing that I only discovered weeks later during performance testing.</p><p>: While I was obsessing over compression performance, achieving 500+ MB/s speeds and celebrating my AI-guided optimization breakthroughs, I had completely forgotten about the other half of the equation—decompression.</p><p> When I finally ran end-to-end tests, I discovered my \"decompression engine\" was literally just one line of code:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>: This wasn't even using my custom ZIP parser, SIMD optimizations, or buffer pools. It was just delegating to Python's standard library. While my compression was blazing at 500+ MB/s, decompression was crawling at 2.8 MB/s.</p><p>: Picture this—I'm showing my friend Ömer these amazing compression benchmarks, proudly talking about entropy analysis and AI-guided parameter tuning. Then he asks: \"Cool, but how fast does it extract files?\" </p><p>I run the test. 2.8 MB/s.</p><p><strong>The silence was deafening.</strong></p><p>: This taught me that AI-assisted development has the same pitfall as traditional development—you can get so excited about the interesting problems that you neglect the \"boring\" parts. The most sophisticated compression engine in the world is useless if you forget to build the extraction engine.</p><p>: Once I realized my mistake, fixing it became my biggest breakthrough...</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  🚀 <strong>The ZIP Decompression Breakthrough: From Embarrassment to 90x Performance</strong></h2><p>After that humiliating discovery, the decompression module became my redemption challenge. What happened next was unexpected—a performance breakthrough that transformed my biggest oversight into my proudest achievement.</p><p>: My embarrassing 2.8 MB/s one-liner that wasn't even using my own code.</p><p>: When I finally ran performance tests on the complete pipeline, the decompression bottleneck was glaring. While my compression engine was hitting 500+ MB/s, decompression was limping at 2.8 MB/s. This wasn't just a performance gap—it was a development oversight that needed immediate attention.</p><p>: Three AI-guided optimization strategies that transformed everything—from a forgotten one-liner to industry-competitive performance:</p><h3><strong>1. Hybrid Fast Path Strategy (10MB Threshold)</strong></h3><p>ChatGPT analyzed my performance bottlenecks and suggested an intelligent file size strategy:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p> Thread startup cost is ~3ms. Below 10MB, thread overhead &gt; benefit. Above 10MB, parallel processing &gt; overhead.</p><h3><strong>2. SIMD CRC32 Hardware Acceleration</strong></h3><p>ZIP files require CRC32 validation for every file—a major bottleneck. ChatGPT suggested hardware acceleration:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>: 899% speedup on Intel/AMD CPUs with hardware CRC32 instructions.</p><h3><strong>3.

Not just the last piece of information, but the entire sequence of events, allowing it to understand context and predict future outcomes based on past experiences. This isn't science fiction; this is the power of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs). Unlike traditional neural networks that process data independently, RNNs possess a unique \"memory\" that allows them to analyze sequential data, making them ideal for tackling problems that involve order and context.</p><p><strong>Understanding the Core Concept: A Network with a Memory</strong></p><p>Traditional neural networks are like static snapshots. They process a single input and produce an output, forgetting everything about the previous input. RNNs, however, are more like a video recording. They maintain an internal state, a kind of memory, that's updated with each new input. This memory allows the network to consider the sequence of inputs, understanding not just what happened but  it happened.</p><p>Think of reading a sentence. Understanding \"The cat sat on the mat\" requires remembering \"the cat\" to understand where it \"sat.\" A traditional neural network would process each word independently, failing to grasp the relationship. An RNN, however, would maintain a memory of \"the cat,\" allowing it to correctly interpret the entire sentence.</p><p>Technically, this memory is achieved through loops in the network's architecture. The output of a layer is fed back into the same layer, allowing the network to retain information from previous inputs. This loop, combined with the network's weights (which determine the importance of different inputs), enables the RNN to learn complex patterns and dependencies within sequential data.</p><p><strong>The Significance of RNNs: Tackling Sequential Challenges</strong></p><p>The ability to process sequential data opens up a vast array of possibilities. Many real-world problems involve sequences: time series data (stock prices, weather patterns), natural language (text, speech), and even genetic sequences. RNNs excel in these domains, offering solutions where traditional methods struggle.</p><p><strong>Applications and Transformative Impact:</strong></p><p>The impact of RNNs is already being felt across various industries:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Natural Language Processing (NLP):</strong>  RNNs are revolutionizing NLP, powering applications like machine translation, text summarization, chatbots, and sentiment analysis.  They excel at understanding the nuances of language, capturing context and generating coherent text.</p></li><li><p>  RNNs are crucial for converting spoken language into text, significantly improving the accuracy and efficiency of voice assistants and dictation software.</p></li><li><p>  From predicting stock market trends to forecasting weather patterns, RNNs provide powerful tools for analyzing and predicting changes over time.  This has implications for finance, meteorology, and other fields.</p></li><li><p>  RNNs, particularly those advanced architectures like LSTMs and GRUs, have significantly improved the quality of machine translation, enabling more natural and accurate translations between languages.</p></li><li><p>  RNNs are used for analyzing medical images, predicting patient outcomes, and even assisting in drug discovery.  The ability to process sequential data like patient records allows for more personalized and effective healthcare.</p></li></ul><p><strong>Challenges and Ethical Considerations:</strong></p><p>Despite their power, RNNs also present challenges:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Vanishing Gradient Problem:</strong>  During training, information can be lost as it's passed through the recurrent loops, making it difficult to learn long-range dependencies.  Advanced architectures like Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) networks were developed to mitigate this issue.</p></li><li><p>  Training RNNs can be computationally expensive, requiring significant processing power and time, particularly for large datasets.</p></li><li><p>  Like all machine learning models, RNNs are susceptible to biases present in the training data. This can lead to unfair or discriminatory outcomes, highlighting the need for careful data curation and model evaluation.</p></li><li><p>  Understanding  an RNN makes a particular prediction can be challenging, limiting their transparency and accountability, especially in critical applications like healthcare and finance.</p></li></ul><p><strong>A Forward-Looking Summary:</strong></p><p>Recurrent Neural Networks represent a significant advancement in artificial intelligence, offering powerful tools for processing sequential data and tackling complex problems across diverse fields. While challenges remain, particularly regarding computational cost and explainability, ongoing research and development are continuously refining RNN architectures and addressing these limitations. As we move forward, the transformative potential of RNNs will undoubtedly continue to reshape industries and offer innovative solutions to some of humanity's most pressing challenges. The ability to build systems that learn from sequences, remember context, and predict future outcomes based on past experiences is a cornerstone of truly intelligent systems, and RNNs are leading the way.</p>","contentLength":5005,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Why Is Python Good For Rapid Prototyping Applications?","url":"https://dev.to/shriyansh_iot_98734929139/why-is-python-good-for-rapid-prototyping-applications-4e7i","date":1750382829,"author":"Shriyansh IOT","guid":163226,"unread":true,"content":"<p>Python is an excellent language for rapid prototyping due to its simplicity, readability, and extensive ecosystem of libraries and frameworks.

Handling Nested Relationships for Read/Write\n</h3><p>For OrderItems, I used a powerful DRF pattern:</p><p>For Reading (GET requests): I use product = ProductSerializer(read_only=True) to show detailed product information nested within the OrderItem.\nFor Writing (POST/PUT requests): I use product_id = serializers.PrimaryKeyRelatedField(queryset=Product.objects.all(), write_only=True) to expect just the product's ID from the client, simplifying the input payload.</p><div><pre><code># orders/serializers.py (inside OrderItemSerializer)\n# Assuming ProductSerializer is correctly imported from products.serializers\nfrom products.serializers import ProductSerializer \n\nclass OrderItemSerializer(serializers.ModelSerializer):\n    product = ProductSerializer(read_only=True) # Full product details on read\n    product_id = serializers.PrimaryKeyRelatedField( # Product ID on write\n        queryset=Product.objects.all(), \n        write_only=True\n    )\n    # ...\n</code></pre></div><h3>\n  \n  \n  The Sweet Taste of Success!\n</h3><p>After implementing these changes and restarting my server, the API calls from Swagger were finally successful!</p><div><pre><code>[19/Jun/2025 02:57:30] \"POST /api/orders/ HTTP/1.1\" 201 378\n[19/Jun/2025 02:57:59] \"GET /api/orders/ HTTP/1.1\" 200 742\n</code></pre></div><h3>\n  \n  \n  This journey reinforced the immense value of:\n</h3><p>Thorough Unit Testing: Pinpointing where the issue truly lies (model vs. serializer).\nUnderstanding DRF's Mechanics: Especially read_only_fields and custom create/update methods for nested writes.<p>\nData Integrity: Ensuring fields meet database constraints.</p>\nDjango Signals: Leveraging them for automated calculations and maintaining data consistency.<p>\nI'm incredibly grateful for the guidance received throughout this process.

Offers were wild. I saw junior devs making $180K+. Everyone was hiring. Everyone was growing. Engineers were being treated like kings.</p><p>Fast forward to today, and it’s a different game.</p><ul><li>Layoffs hit hard. Not just at startups, but at , you name it.</li><li>Projects were cut.

The brand name? The approval of other developers?</p><p>I never stopped to think whether I’d actually enjoy working in a massive organization where you’re just one cog in a huge machine. Where \"impact\" means shipping a feature behind a feature flag that 0.02% of users might see for a week.</p><p>I didn’t want to spend my days optimizing signup buttons or writing glue code between microservices I couldn’t control.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  The Interview Process Burned Me Out\n</h2><p>Honestly? Interviewing at FAANG companies started to feel like a second job.</p><p>I was coding all day… and then spending nights grinding algorithms I’d never use at work. Just to be asked some tree traversal question by someone who wouldn’t remember my name 10 minutes later.</p><p>And even when I did well? Ghosted.

It features over 20 core developers and takes us on a journey from the first days of Python to the latest developments.&nbsp;</p><p>At EuroPython, we’re excited to share a special preview of the film, followed by a Q&amp;A with Brett Cannon, Paul Everitt, and Armin Ronacher.&nbsp;</p><p>As part of EuroPython, we will be holding a memorial session to commemorate Michael Foord.&nbsp;</p><p>Michael Foord (1974-2025) was a central figure in the Python community. He was an original thinker whose warmth, passion, and unfiltered humor touched the lives of many. A core Python developer and the creator of the influential unittest.mock module, he played a pivotal role in shaping testing practices and helped establish the Language Summit at PyCon. More than a brilliant engineer, Michael was a beloved mentor and friend, known for his elaborate vaping setup, colorful attire, and heartfelt conversations. His passing earlier this year left a profound void in the community, but his legacy lives on through his contributions to Python, his generous spirit, and the countless moments of camaraderie he inspired.</p><p>Friends of Michael are invited to attend this session and share their memories. We will provide more details about it closer to the event.</p><p>On Saturday 19th July, we’ll be hosting a Beginners’ Day to help introduce people to Python programming and its applications. Beginners’ Day will feature three tracks running in parallel; The Unconference, Django Girls, and Humble Data. The events are designed to welcome newcomers to the Python ecosystem, including a series of talks and panels by junior developers and two workshops designed to introduce complete beginners to web development and data science.</p><p>We are running the following three tracks:</p><ul><li>, a series of panels and discussions designed to help people just getting into tech to start or grow their career</li><li>, a hands-on workshop teaching the basics of web development</li><li>, a hands-on workshop teaching the basics of data science</li></ul><p>Beginners’ Day is open to everyone, and you don’t need a EuroPython ticket to attend (although note that some tracks will cost €5 to attend otherwise).

Growing. And most importantly, building a solid foundation in coding.<p>\nThis is the story of my first week learning Python, and if you're someone who's just starting out, or someone who loves seeing others learn, I hope this post finds you with a spark of joy.</p></p><p>🐍 \nPython felt like the perfect companion for this journey — simple to read, powerful under the hood, and used across so many fields: web development, automation, AI, data science, you name it!<p>\nBut I didn’t want to just read about Python. I wanted to understand it, to try things, to break things, and fix them again. And so, I dove in.</p></p><p>💫 <strong>Reflections From a Beginner’s Heart</strong>\nI’m not perfect. I’ve written buggy code. I’ve stared at error messages like they were ancient riddles. But in every moment of frustration, there’s also this tiny flicker that says —<strong>“Hey, you’re learning. This is how growth looks.”</strong>\nI may be at the start of this journey, but I am walking with wonder. And even when the road feels steep, I remind myself that every coder was once a confused beginner — just like me.</p><p>🔹** What I’ve Learned in Week 1**\nHere’s what my mind is full of right now:<p>\n🌸 Basics of Python Syntax</p>\nThe way Python talks is… soft-spoken and neat. No messy semicolons, no curly brackets. Just logic and indentation — like poetry for machines.</p><p>🌸 Variables and Data Types\nFrom strings to integers, floats to booleans — I learned how to store and juggle different kinds of data. And yes, Python makes it very beginner-friendly.</p><p>🌸 Input/Output Functions\nUsing input() and print() gave me a sense of interaction — like the code wasn’t just doing things for me, but with me.</p><p>🌸 Python 2 vs Python 3\nThis was so eye-opening! I learned key differences like:<p>\nprint being a statement in Python 2, but a function in Python 3 and much more.</p>\n(P.S. Python 3 is the future and the now!)</p><p>🌸 Pattern Printing\nThis was my first taste of real logic-building. Those triangle stars!<p>\nThey look innocent — but they're sneaky logic puzzles in disguise. I loved trying different loops and seeing shapes appear.</p></p><p>✨** Let’s Grow Together**\nIf you’re also on a coding journey — whether you’re at Day 1 or Year 5 — I’d love to hear from you. Share your favorite resources, tips, or just say hi in the comments! Let’s cheer each other on.<p>\nThanks for reading my little update. Until next time, keep coding, keep blooming. </p></p>","contentLength":2634,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Untitled","url":"https://dev.to/ozen_temeozen_e88de16e9a/untitled-228p","date":1750357320,"author":"Ozen Teme Ozen","guid":163057,"unread":true,"content":"<p>Check out this Pen I made!</p>","contentLength":26,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"🤖 From Using Bots to Building One","url":"https://dev.to/panicatthekernel/from-using-bots-to-building-one-2775","date":1750355695,"author":"PanicAtTheKernel","guid":163040,"unread":true,"content":"<p>In the last post, I talked about this cool bot I  — a Telegram bot that handed out disposable emails and pinged you when you got mail.

The AI was parsing commands and providing genuinely helpful guidance. It felt like magic. ✨</p><p>But as I tried to make it more precise, the magic started to fade.

It works locally on Windows, has its own GUI with an avatar, understands voice commands via a wake-word, and even runs a full large language model (LLM) offline to handle AI tasks.</p><p>And now... it’s open-source. The project is up and running, but I need help with polishing, debugging, and expanding it. If you're a Python dev, AI enthusiast, or just someone curious about real offline AI automation — this is for you.</p><p>What is Great SAGE?\nGreat SAGE is a full-featured AI assistant designed to run completely offline on your PC. It doesn’t send anything to the cloud, doesn’t rely on APIs, and doesn’t need internet access to function.</p><p>Detects a wake word (“Hey SAGE”) using local wake-word detection</p><p>Understands voice input with offline speech recognition (Vosk)</p><p>Processes AI queries using a local LLM (MythoMax 13B, via llama.cpp or ollama)</p><p>Responds via TTS and GUI output</p><p>Controls apps and files with your voice — open programs, move/delete files, organize folders</p><p>Sets reminders and fetches daily info like weather or news</p><p>Supports image generation from voice prompts using Stable Diffusion</p><p>Includes Android sync features via KDE Connect and Scrcpy</p><p>Has a login system secured with password + facial recognition</p><p>Comes with a GUI and animated assistant avatar built in Tkinter</p><p>It’s a real, functioning system — not a concept, not a mockup, not a UI template.</p><p>Why I Built It\nTo be honest, I built it to challenge myself. I wanted to prove that a full AI assistant could be done without the cloud. No Google APIs, no OpenAI keys, no server dependencies.</p><p>Just Python, local models, open-source tools, and a lot of trial-and-error.</p><p>I also wanted something that felt personal — not a generic bot. So I added the avatar. The GUI. The wake word. The local AI engine.</p><p>I’m proud of what I managed to build alone — but I know it could be so much better with help.</p><p>What It Needs Now\nThe core of Great SAGE is solid — but it's rough around the edges.

While the buzz around Artificial Intelligence has been consistent, a new paradigm is emerging: Agentic AI. This isn't just about automation; it's about giving AI the power to perceive, reason, plan, and execute tasks autonomously, transforming operations from reactive to proactive. The impact of agentic AI on businesses will be profound, fundamentally reshaping how work gets done, value is created, and competitive advantages are forged.</p><p>At its core, agentic AI refers to AI systems that possess a degree of autonomy. Unlike traditional AI, which typically performs predefined tasks or provides insights for human action, an agentic AI system can take initiative, make decisions within defined parameters, and execute multi-step processes to achieve a high-level goal. Think of it less as a tool and more as a digital colleague capable of independent thought and action. This shift demands a strategic approach, and businesses will increasingly look to specialized partners, such as an <a href=\"https://www.sparkouttech.com/agentic-ai-development/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Agentic ai development company</a>, to navigate this complex yet rewarding journey.</p><p><strong>The Transformative Power of Agentic AI</strong>\nThe transition to agentic AI isn't merely an incremental upgrade; it's a fundamental re-imagining of operational efficiency and strategic capability.

Imagine an AI agent not just scheduling a meeting, but coordinating across different time zones, finding optimal availability, sending invitations, booking a virtual room, and even sending pre-meeting summaries. This level of automation means:</p><p>Elimination of Repetitive Tasks: Tedious, high-volume, and rule-based processes can be entirely offloaded to AI agents, freeing human employees from mundane work. This includes tasks like data entry, routine reporting, compliance checks, and basic customer support inquiries.</p><p>Faster Processing Times: Agentic AI operates 24/7, without breaks or fatigue. This translates to significantly reduced processing times for everything from claims handling in insurance to supply chain adjustments in manufacturing.</p><p>Reduced Errors: By automating steps and adhering strictly to logic, AI agents minimize human error, leading to higher quality outputs and fewer costly mistakes.</p><p><strong>2. Enhanced Decision-Making and Strategic Insights:</strong></p><p>Agentic AI doesn't just execute; it reasons. This capability elevates its impact beyond simple automation:</p><p>Real-time Data Analysis: Agents can continuously monitor vast streams of data – from market trends and customer behavior to internal system performance – identifying patterns and anomalies that humans might miss.</p><p>Proactive Problem Solving: Instead of reacting to issues, agentic AI can predict potential problems (e.g., a supply chain disruption, a system failure, or a fraudulent transaction) and initiate corrective actions or alert human counterparts, minimizing downtime and losses.</p><p>Optimized Resource Allocation: In areas like logistics or financial trading, agents can dynamically allocate resources, adjust routes, or rebalance portfolios in real-time based on evolving conditions, maximizing efficiency and profitability.</p><p><strong>3. Revolutionizing Customer Experience:</strong></p><p>Agentic AI can deliver highly personalized and instantaneous customer interactions at scale:</p><p>24/7 Intelligent Support: Beyond basic chatbots, agentic AI can handle complex customer queries, troubleshoot issues, process returns, and even offer tailored recommendations, providing consistent and immediate support across all channels.</p><p>Personalized Interactions: By analyzing customer history, preferences, and real-time context, agents can deliver hyper-personalized service, making each interaction feel unique and valuable.</p><p>Proactive Engagement: Agents can anticipate customer needs and reach out with relevant information, offers, or support before the customer even realizes they need it, fostering stronger relationships and loyalty.</p><p><strong>4. Empowering Human-AI Collaboration:</strong></p><p>Contrary to fears of job displacement, agentic AI is largely seen as an augmentative technology. It reshapes roles, allowing humans to focus on higher-value activities:</p><p>Upskilling and Reskilling Opportunities: Employees previously tied to repetitive tasks can be upskilled to manage, oversee, and strategically direct AI agents, transitioning into roles that require creativity, critical thinking, and complex problem-solving.</p><p>Strategic Focus for Humans: With agents handling the operational minutiae, human teams can dedicate more time to innovation, strategic planning, relationship building, and tackling unique, unstructured problems.</p><p>Accelerated Learning and Development: Agentic AI can power personalized training programs, identify skill gaps within a workforce, and even act as intelligent coaches for employees, accelerating professional development.</p><p><strong>Key Applications Across Industries</strong>\nThe versatility of agentic AI means its impact will be felt across virtually every sector:</p><p>Financial Services: Fraud detection, personalized financial advisory, automated compliance checks, algorithmic trading, and dynamic risk management. An agentic AI development company can help financial institutions build sophisticated systems to monitor markets and execute complex strategies.</p><p>Healthcare: Patient care coordination, automated medical record management, personalized treatment plan recommendations, remote patient monitoring, and drug discovery acceleration.</p><p>Manufacturing &amp; Supply Chain: Predictive maintenance for machinery, dynamic supply chain optimization (forecasting demand, managing inventory, optimizing logistics), quality control, and factory automation.</p><p>Retail &amp; E-commerce: Hyper-personalized product recommendations, automated inventory management, dynamic pricing, customer service automation, and fraud prevention in online transactions.</p><p>Human Resources: Automated resume screening, personalized onboarding experiences, intelligent talent matching, employee support, and compliance monitoring for HR policies.</p><p>IT Operations: Proactive system monitoring, automated incident response, intelligent ticket routing, security threat detection, and automated deployment and management of IT infrastructure. An AI development company specializing in IT solutions can provide critical agentic AI development services to streamline operations.</p><p><strong>The Development Journey: Partnering for Success</strong>\nAdopting agentic AI is not simply about acquiring software; it's a strategic transformation that requires careful planning, robust development, and continuous iteration.

SpeechDown is the natural successor and, yes, a playground for practicing software-craft principles and experimenting with AI-driven development.</p><p>This post is a brief tour of that journey so far.</p><p>First things first: I don't recommend using SpeechDown for any critical work . It's a work in progress. However, I believe the code and the development practices behind it can serve as a useful, real-world example for the concepts I'm about to discuss.</p><ul><li><ul><li>Capture and organise my own voice notes in a searchable Markdown corpus\n</li><li>Personal sandbox to practise software-craft principles\n</li><li>Test-bed for AI-assisted coding workflows\n</li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Architecture in a nutshell</strong></p><ul><li>Domain-Driven Design (DDD) keeps core logic pure and language-aligned\n</li><li>Ports &amp; Adapters (Hexagonal) pattern isolates I/O, letting adapters swap freely\n</li><li>Four layers: , , , </li></ul></li><li><ul><li>Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) capture the “why” of each big choice\n</li><li>Design / PRD docs outline features up front for both humans  AIs\n</li></ul></li><li><ul><li>Design docs serve as rich prompts for Copilot, Codex, Claude Code, etc.\n</li><li>A single  file synchronizes naming, layout, and testing rules across tools\n</li></ul></li><li><ul><li><code>sd transcribe --within-hours 24</code> turns recent audio into timestamped Markdown\n</li><li>Adding a new speech-to-text engine is as simple as implementing another adapter\n</li></ul></li><li><ul><li>Pre-v1 playground: solid for learning and tinkering, not yet production-grade</li></ul></li><li><ul><li>See the  section at the end for a curated set of recent deep-dive posts and tools that extend these ideas.</li></ul></li></ul><h2>\n  \n  \n  Part 1: A Playground for Software Craftsmanship\n</h2><p>One of my main goals with SpeechDown was to apply and practice established software design patterns in a Python context.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Domain-Driven Design (DDD) &amp; Ports and Adapters Pattern\n</h3><p>I structured the project using a layered architecture inspired by DDD and the Ports and Adapters (or Hexagonal) pattern. This helps keep the core logic of the application separate from the tools and technologies it uses.</p><p>The project is split into four distinct layers:</p><ul><li>: Contains the core business logic, entities, and value objects. It has zero external dependencies.</li><li>: Orchestrates the use cases. It defines interfaces (Ports) for external interactions.</li><li>: Provides concrete implementations (Adapters) for the ports. This is where database connections, file system access, and API calls live.</li><li>: The user-facing layer, in this case, the Command-Line Interface (CLI).</li></ul><p>This structure is reflected in the source code directory:</p><div><pre><code>src/speechdown/\n├── application/\n│   ├── ports/\n│   └── services/\n├── domain/\n│   ├── entities.py\n│   └── value_objects.py\n├── infrastructure/\n│   ├── adapters/\n│   └── database.py\n└── presentation/\n    └── cli/\n</code></pre></div><p>A  is just an interface. For example, to get a timestamp from a file, the application layer defines a simple contract:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>The  is the concrete implementation. This one parses filenames or falls back to the file's modification time:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>This separation makes the system incredibly flexible and testable. I can easily swap out the  for one that reads metadata from the audio file without changing any of the application's core logic.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Documenting Decisions with ADRs and Design Docs\n</h3><p>To keep track of  certain decisions were made, I use <strong>Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)</strong>. They are simple Markdown files that document a decision, its context, and its consequences. You can see them in .</p><p>For more detailed feature planning, I use , which outline the —covering product requirements, UX, and technical design. This practice is especially useful when working with AI assistants.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Part 2: A Playground for AI Collaboration\n</h2><p>The second major goal of SpeechDown is to explore how to work effectively with modern AI coding assistants. Simply asking an AI to \"add a feature\" often results in code that breaks the established architecture.</p><p>My solution involves two key practices:</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  1. Design Documents (PRDs) as AI Prompts\n</h3><p>I write detailed design documents before starting a feature. These documents serve as a comprehensive prompt for the AI, giving it the necessary context to generate code that fits the project's structure. I'm considering renaming my  folder to  (Product Requirement Documents), as this seems to be emerging as a standard term for this practice.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  2. Explicit Rules for AI Assistants\n</h3><p>I maintain a master rule file, , that explicitly defines the project's architecture, naming conventions, and testing requirements.</p><div><pre><code> Follow Domain-Driven Design with four layers: , , , .\n Domain layer () contains entities and value objects only. No external dependencies.\n Application layer () defines ports (interfaces) under ...\n Dependencies point inward...\n\n Interfaces end with  (e.g., ).\n Implementations end with  (e.g., ).\n Service classes end with .\n</code></pre></div><p>A simple Python script (<code>scripts/generate_ai_rules.py</code>) then generates specific configuration files for different AI assistants from this master file:</p><ul><li><code>.github/copilot-instructions.md</code> for GitHub Copilot</li><li> for OpenAI Codex</li><li> for Anthropic's Claude</li></ul><p>This ensures that no matter which tool I'm using—GitHub Copilot, Google's Jules, or Claude Code—it has the same set of instructions. This has dramatically improved the quality and compliance of AI-generated code.</p><p>Despite being a playground, SpeechDown is a usable CLI tool. After initializing a project with , you can run a transcription with a simple command:</p><div><pre><code>\nsd transcribe  24\n</code></pre></div><p>This processes the audio files and groups the transcriptions into daily Markdown files, like :</p><div><pre><code>\n\nThis is the transcribed text from my first audio note. I should remember to talk about the AI rules.\n\n\nAnother transcription from a different file, automatically appended and sorted chronologically.\n</code></pre></div><p>This section gathers the core references mentioned above plus a hand-picked set of very recent articles for anyone who wants to dig deeper into the architecture patterns, ADR discipline, AI-assisted coding.</p><p>This project has been an incredible learning experience. It's a practical exercise in applying software architecture principles and a fascinating exploration of human-AI collaboration in coding.</p><p>I'm sharing this not as a finished product, but as a collection of ideas and examples. I'd love to hear your thoughts on this approach.</p><ul><li>  What are your strategies for maintaining clean architecture in your projects?</li><li>  How do you guide AI assistants to produce code that fits your standards?</li></ul>","contentLength":6811,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"BJ's Wholesale Club Grocery Data Powers Retail Product Intelligence Growth","url":"https://dev.to/mobileapp1/bjs-wholesale-club-grocery-data-powers-retail-product-intelligence-growth-8e9","date":1750332798,"author":"mobileapp","guid":162829,"unread":true,"content":"<p><a href=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fhd37y7q85opxbckpwyi6.jpg\"><img src=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fhd37y7q85opxbckpwyi6.jpg\" alt=\"Image description\" width=\"800\" height=\"421\"></a>\nModern wholesale retail environments require sophisticated intelligence systems to navigate complex market dynamics and consumer purchasing patterns.

This powerful synergy is giving rise to Web3 <a href=\"https://www.sparkouttech.com/ai-agent-development/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">AI Agents – autonomous</a>, intelligent entities that can perceive, reason, plan, and act within decentralized ecosystems, promising a new frontier in digital interaction, automation, and value creation.</p><p>Gone are the days when AI was confined to centralized servers, opaque algorithms, and corporate control. Web3 AI Agents embody a future where intelligence is distributed, transparent, and user-centric, fundamentally altering how we interact with the internet and manage digital assets. This blog delves into what Web3 AI Agents are, their transformative potential, the challenges they face, and the exciting future they herald.</p><p><strong>What are Web3 AI Agents? A Fusion of Intelligence and Decentralization</strong>\nAt its core, a Web3 AI Agent is an AI-powered software program that can independently interact with blockchain networks and decentralized applications (dApps). It's not just a smart contract; it's an intelligent entity that can:</p><p>Perceive (Web3 Data): These agents are designed to \"see\" and interpret the vast amount of data residing on blockchains. This includes real-time transaction streams, smart contract states, NFT metadata, DeFi protocol data (liquidity pools, lending rates), DAO proposals, and even market sentiment from decentralized social platforms.</p><p>Reason (AI Models): Equipped with advanced AI models, primarily Large Language Models (LLMs) but also other machine learning algorithms, the agents process the perceived data. They understand complex contexts, identify patterns, infer knowledge, and analyze situations to make informed decisions.</p><p>Plan (Goal-Oriented Logic): Unlike reactive chatbots, Web3 AI Agents can formulate multi-step plans to achieve specific, often complex, goals. This involves breaking down a high-level objective into a series of actionable steps within the decentralized environment. Businesses seeking to implement these sophisticated systems will often look for specialized expertise in crafting <a href=\"https://www.sparkouttech.com/ai-agent-development/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">cutting-edge AI agent development solutions</a>.</p><p>Act (On-Chain Interactions): This is where the \"Web3\" truly comes into play. Agents can execute actions directly on the blockchain by:</p><p>Sending signed transactions.</p><p>Calling smart contract functions.</p><p>Participating in decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) by voting or proposing.</p><p>Managing crypto wallets and digital assets (tokens, NFTs).</p><p>Interacting with various dApps and decentralized protocols.</p><p>Learn &amp; Adapt (Continuous Improvement): They are designed for continuous improvement, learning from the outcomes of their actions, market feedback, and new information to refine their strategies and behaviors over time. Their \"memory\" can be sustained through decentralized storage solutions, allowing for persistent context and evolving intelligence.</p><p>Self-Custody (Potential): In advanced iterations, a Web3 AI Agent might even possess its own crypto wallet, managing its own digital assets and participating directly in decentralized economies.</p><p>This combination of AI intelligence with Web3's decentralization, transparency, verifiability, and censorship resistance makes Web3 AI Agents fundamentally different from traditional, centralized AI systems.</p><p><strong>The Driving Force: Why Web3 AI Agents Now?</strong>\nThe rise of Web3 AI Agents isn't accidental; it's a culmination of several technological advancements and growing demands for a more open and efficient internet:</p><p>Maturity of LLMs: The exponential growth in LLM capabilities provides the \"brain\" for agents, enabling sophisticated natural language understanding, reasoning, and planning.</p><p>Robustness of Blockchain Infrastructure: More scalable, efficient, and interconnected blockchain networks (Layer 2s, cross-chain bridges) make on-chain interactions feasible and cost-effective for automated agents.</p><p>Demand for Decentralized Automation: As Web3 ecosystems grow in complexity (DeFi, DAOs, GameFi), the need for intelligent automation that doesn't rely on centralized intermediaries becomes critical.</p><p>Emergence of Agent Development Frameworks: Specialized frameworks (which we'll touch upon later) are making it easier for developers to build, deploy, and manage these sophisticated agents.</p><p>Focus on User Empowerment: Web3's core tenet is returning ownership and control to users. AI agents, when decentralized, align with this by offering personalized, autonomous assistance without compromising privacy or inviting censorship.</p><p>Transformative Use Cases: A Glimpse into the Future\nThe implications of Web3 AI Agents span across virtually every sector touching digital economies:</p><p><strong>Decentralized Finance (DeFi) Revolution:</strong></p><p>Autonomous Portfolio Management: AI agents can monitor countless market variables (gas fees, liquidity pool rates, token prices, lending/borrowing yields) across multiple DeFi protocols in real-time. They can then autonomously execute strategies like rebalancing portfolios, optimizing yield farming positions, or engaging in arbitrage opportunities to maximize returns and minimize risk, all without manual intervention.</p><p>Risk Management &amp; Security: Proactively identifying and responding to potential exploits or anomalies in DeFi protocols. Imagine an agent detecting a flash loan attack in progress and initiating countermeasures.</p><p>Liquidity Provisioning: Dynamically adjusting liquidity positions in decentralized exchanges based on market conditions to ensure optimal impermanent loss mitigation and fee generation.</p><p>Empowering DAO Governance:</p><p>Intelligent Proposal Summarization &amp; Analysis: DAOs often face \"voter fatigue\" due to overwhelming numbers of complex proposals. AI agents can analyze proposals, summarize key points, highlight potential impacts, and even simulate voting outcomes, providing digestible insights to human members.</p><p>Automated Voting Delegation: Members can delegate their voting power to an AI agent based on predefined criteria (e.g., \"vote for proposals promoting sustainable energy,\" \"vote against proposals increasing protocol fees\"). The agent then consistently participates on their behalf, increasing decentralization and active governance.</p><p>Treasury Management &amp; Allocation: Agents can analyze market conditions and community needs to propose or even execute optimal asset allocation strategies for DAO treasuries.</p><p><strong>Revolutionizing Web3 Gaming &amp; the Metaverse:</strong></p><p>Intelligent NPCs (Non-Player Characters): Beyond scripted behaviors, AI agents can power NPCs with dynamic personalities, adaptive dialogue, and the ability to learn and evolve. These NPCs could own their own wallets, participate in the game's economy (buying/selling NFTs, trading resources), and even initiate interactions with players based on their behavior.</p><p>Dynamic Content Generation: AI agents can procedurally generate unique in-game assets, quests, or storylines that adapt to individual player choices and game states, creating endlessly engaging experiences.</p><p>In-Game Economy Balancing: AI agents can monitor the health of a game's decentralized economy, dynamically adjusting token rewards, resource scarcity, and NFT minting rates to prevent inflation or deflation and ensure long-term sustainability.</p><p>Anti-Cheat &amp; Fraud Detection: AI agents can analyze player behavior on-chain and off-chain to detect sophisticated cheating, botting, or fraudulent activities that compromise fair play.</p><p><strong>Personalized Web3 Assistants:</strong></p><p>Onboarding &amp; Education: For new users navigating the complexities of Web3, AI agents can act as personalized guides, explaining concepts like gas fees, wallet management, token standards, and guiding them through their first dApp interactions.</p><p>Curated Information &amp; Alerts: Agents can monitor specific blockchain addresses, NFT collections, or DeFi protocols, alerting users to important events, price changes, or new opportunities tailored to their interests.</p><p>Digital Asset Management: Beyond trading, agents could help manage users' entire digital footprint, including NFT collections, managing proofs of identity, or organizing decentralized file storage.</p><p><strong>Cross-Chain Interoperability and Bridging:</strong></p><p>AI agents can monitor opportunities and liquidity across different blockchain networks, enabling seamless and optimized asset transfers or swaps between chains. They could identify the most efficient bridge or swap path for a user's assets.\nChallenges on the Path to Widespread Adoption<p>\nDespite the immense promise, Web3 AI Agents face significant hurdles that development companies and researchers are actively working to overcome:</p></p><p>Computational Cost &amp; Scalability: Running complex AI models and frequent on-chain interactions can be computationally intensive and incur high gas fees. While Layer 2 solutions and off-chain computation (with on-chain verification) are mitigating factors, optimizing efficiency remains crucial.</p><p>Data Privacy vs. Data Needs: AI models thrive on vast amounts of data, but Web3 prioritizes user privacy and data self-sovereignty. Striking a balance between providing enough data for effective AI operations and maintaining user privacy and decentralization is a complex challenge.</p><p>Security Vulnerabilities: Autonomous agents interacting with real assets on a blockchain present high-stakes security risks. Bugs in the AI's logic, vulnerabilities in smart contract interactions, or susceptibility to adversarial attacks could lead to significant financial losses. Robust auditing, formal verification, and secure execution environments are paramount.</p><p>Trust and Explainability (XAI): When an autonomous agent makes a critical decision (e.g., executing a large trade or voting on a crucial DAO proposal), users and stakeholders need to understand why that decision was made. Ensuring explainability and verifiability of agent actions is vital for building trust.</p><p>Regulatory Landscape: The legal and regulatory frameworks for autonomous AI agents, especially those handling financial transactions in a decentralized manner, are still in their infancy. This uncertainty can hinder adoption by larger institutions.</p><p>Interoperability and Standardization: While many individual agents are being developed, achieving seamless communication and collaboration between diverse AI agents across different blockchains and protocols requires common standards and robust interoperability layers.</p><p>\"Hallucinations\" and Unintended Actions: AI models, especially LLMs, can \"hallucinate\" or generate incorrect information. When this translates to autonomous actions on-chain, the consequences can be severe and irreversible. Robust guardrails, validation mechanisms, and human-in-the-loop oversight are crucial.</p><p><strong>The Road Ahead: A New Digital Frontier</strong>\nThe journey to fully realized Web3 AI Agents is a collaborative effort involving AI researchers, blockchain developers, cryptographers, and regulatory experts. Key areas of ongoing development include:</p><p>Decentralized AI Infrastructure: Building robust, scalable, and cost-effective decentralized networks that can host and power AI agents. This includes decentralized compute, storage, and oracle networks.</p><p>Agent-Specific Frameworks: Developing specialized frameworks and libraries that simplify the creation, deployment, and management of Web3 AI Agents, integrating LLM capabilities with blockchain interaction logic.</p><p>Security Primitives: Innovations in zero-knowledge proofs, secure multi-party computation, and on-chain verification to enhance the security and verifiability of agent actions.</p><p>Ethical AI Governance: Establishing clear guidelines and technical mechanisms to ensure Web3 AI Agents operate ethically, transparently, and in alignment with human values.</p><p>The emergence of Web3 AI Agents marks a pivotal moment in the digital age. They are not merely tools for automation; they are intelligent, self-sovereign entities poised to transform industries, empower individuals, and unlock unprecedented levels of efficiency and innovation in decentralized environments.</p><p>For businesses looking to fully embrace this paradigm shift, engaging with a reputable AI agent development company will be essential. If you're considering building your own intelligent entities, you'll want to <a href=\"https://www.sparkouttech.com/ai-agent-development/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">hire AI agent developer</a> talent with a deep understanding of blockchain and advanced AI. The burgeoning field of agentic AI development company will be at the forefront of this evolution, guiding organizations in integrating these powerful agents into their operations.</p><p>Web3 AI Agents promise a future where digital interactions are more intelligent, autonomous, and aligned with the principles of decentralization, setting the stage for a truly transformative digital frontier.</p>","contentLength":12669,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Best IT Company in Ahmedabad, Gujarat, India","url":"https://dev.to/cmpglobalsolutions/best-it-company-in-ahmedabad-gujarat-india-1fed","date":1750332150,"author":"CMP Global Solutions","guid":162827,"unread":true,"content":"<p><a href=\"https://www.cmpglobalsolutions.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">CMP Global Solutions</a> is a leading IT solutions company based in Ahmedabad, India, delivering cutting-edge web development, software, and mobile app services globally.

The project is <a href=\"https://github.com/The-Pocket/PocketFlow-Tutorial-Website-Chatbot\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">open-sourced on GitHub</a>.</em></p></blockquote><h2>\n  \n  \n  1. That \"Simple\" Chatbot Project... Isn't\n</h2><p>So, you want to build an AI chatbot for your website. It sounds easy enough. You call an API, write a clever prompt, and you're basically done, right?</p><p>Except for one tiny, soul-crushing detail: Your brand-new AI knows... .</p><p>It has no idea what your company sells, what your return policy is, or who you are. It's just an empty brain in a box. To make it useful, you have to feed it knowledge. And that's where the \"simple\" project becomes a total nightmare.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  The Old, Broken Way to Build a Chatbot's Brain\n</h3><p>Here’s the standard, painful process everyone seems to follow:</p><ol><li><p> First, you go on a company-wide scavenger hunt, digging through folders and old emails to find every PDF, FAQ, and policy document you can.</p></li><li><p> Then, you become a data janitor. You write a bunch of tedious scripts to chop all that messy information into clean little \"chunks\" the AI can understand.</p></li><li><p><strong>The Expensive Brain Surgery.</strong> Finally, you perform some expensive brain surgery. You set up a complicated (and often pricey) \"vector database\" and shove all those data chunks into it.</p></li></ol><p>After all that, you  have a chatbot that knows things. For about a day.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  And Now... Your Chatbot Is a Liar\n</h3><p>The moment your bot goes live, it starts to rot.</p><p>The marketing team updates the pricing page. The engineers release a new feature. Suddenly, your chatbot is confidently telling customers the wrong price. It's a walking, talking liability. You didn't build a smart AI assistant. You built a manual-syncing, high-maintenance chore that you have to babysit forever.</p><p>But what if this entire approach is wrong? What if the knowledge base wasn't some clunky database you have to constantly update? What if...  was the brain? That’s the chatbot we’re building today. A bot so simple, it feels like cheating.</p><p>This project is powered by <a href=\"https://github.com/the-pocket/PocketFlow\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">PocketFlow</a>, a tiny but mighty AI framework that makes building this kind of intelligent, looping agent incredibly straightforward. Forget vector databases and manual updates. Let's build a chatbot that just works.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  2. Our Solution: A \"Dumb\" Crawler That's Actually Smart\n</h2><p>Let's throw that entire, complicated process in the trash. We are not going to hunt for documents, clean up data, or set up a single database.</p><p>Instead, our chatbot will get its information directly from the source: your live website. Think of it like this. The old way is like printing a map once a year and hoping the roads don't change. Our new way is like using Google Maps on your phone—it's always live, always current.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  The Master Plan: Let the Bot Read\n</h3><p>Our chatbot works like a very fast, very focused intern. When a user asks a question, the bot doesn't look up the answer in some dusty old database. Instead, it visits your website and starts reading, right then and there.</p><p>Let's imagine your website has a realistic structure. A user asks a question that requires information from multiple places: <strong>\"How do I get a refund for Product A?\"</strong></p><p>The bot needs to be smart. It has to navigate the site to find  the relevant pieces of the puzzle. In the diagram below, the lines show all the possible links. The  shows the  our bot takes to find the answer.</p><p>Here's a play-by-play of the bot's clever thought process:</p><ol><li><strong>It starts on the Homepage.</strong> It sees both \"refund\" and \"Product A\" in the question. It decides to find the product page first to confirm the product's details.</li><li><strong>It navigates to the \"Product A\" page.</strong> It reads the content and finds key info, like a \"30-day warranty,\" but it doesn't find the  for actually getting a refund.</li><li><strong>It intelligently changes course.</strong> It realizes the refund steps aren't on the product page. So, it thinks like a human would: \"Okay, I need to find the general company policies.\" It navigates back to the site's main \"Support\" section to find the official information. It doesn't need a direct link; it understands the site's structure.</li><li><strong>It finds the final piece of the puzzle.</strong> On the Support page, it sees a link to \"Shipping &amp; Returns Policy,\" reads it, and learns the exact steps to submit a refund request.</li></ol><p>Now, it combines the \"30-day warranty\" from the product page with the \"how-to steps\" from the returns policy to give a perfect, comprehensive answer.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Why This is So Much Better\n</h3><p>The beauty of this approach is its simplicity.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Your Knowledge is Always Fresh:</strong> You change your pricing? The bot knows instantly. You update your team bio? The bot knows that too. There is no sync step. There is no \"stale data.\" Ever.</p></li><li><p><strong>There is Zero Maintenance:</strong> You never have to tell the bot about updates. Just update your website like you normally would, and the chatbot takes care of the rest.</p></li></ul><p>But what stops it from wandering off your site and crawling the entire internet? Simple. We give it a leash. We provide a list of approved website domains (like ) and tell it: \"You are only allowed to visit links on these sites. Don't go anywhere else.\"</p><p>This all sounds great, but building an agent that can make decisions and get stuck in a loop sounds complicated, right? You'd think you need a massive, heavy framework to manage that kind of logic.</p><p>Actually, you don't. And that’s where PocketFlow comes in.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  3. PocketFlow: The Tiny Engine That Powers Our Bot\n</h2><p>You wouldn't use a bulldozer to plant a single flower. In the same way, we don't need a massive, heavyweight AI framework for our straightforward crawling task. We need something small, fast, and built for exactly this kind of job.</p><p>That's why we're using . PocketFlow is a minimalist AI framework that's just 100 lines of code. It has zero dependencies and zero fluff. Let's look at its three core ideas.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  The Node: A Specialist Worker\n</h3><p>In PocketFlow, each task is a . A Node is like a specialist worker who is a pro at . Here’s what a Node looks like in the actual PocketFlow code:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Don't worry if  or  look weird; they're just Python things! The important bit is the  cycle:</p><ol><li>: \"Hey, I'm about to start. What info do I need from the  whiteboard?\"</li><li>: \"Okay, I have my info. Now I'll do my main job!\" (Like calling an AI).</li><li>: \"Job's done! I'll write my results to the  whiteboard and tell the manager what to do next by returning a signal (like a keyword, e.g.,  or ).\"</li></ol><h3>\n  \n  \n  The Shared Store: The Central Whiteboard\n</h3><p>This is just a plain old Python dictionary (we'll call it ). All our Node workers can read from it and write to it. It's how they pass information—like the user's question or the list of URLs to visit—to each other.</p><p>For our chatbot, it might look like this initially:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>As Nodes do their work, they'll update this  dictionary.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  The Flow: The Workshop Manager\n</h3><p>A  object is the manager of your workshop. You tell it which Node to start with, and it handles the rest. When you  a Flow, it just keeps doing one thing over and over:</p><ol><li> The Node finishes and returns a  (just a string, like ).</li><li> The Flow looks at the Node's connections to see where that signal leads, and moves to the next Node.</li></ol><p>Here's how tiny the  manager class actually is in PocketFlow:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>That's it! It starts a  loop, runs a node, gets a signal, and finds the next node. If there's no next node for that signal, the loop ends.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Tiny Math Example: PocketFlow in Action!\n</h3><p>Let's build a super-tiny workflow: take a number, add 5, then multiply by 2.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p><em>Notice  doesn't return anything? PocketFlow automatically treats that as the signal .</em></p><p><strong>Worker 2: The Multiplier Node</strong></p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p><strong>Connecting the Workers and Running the Flow:</strong></p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>If you run this, you get exactly what you'd expect:</p><div><pre><code>Starting math game with: {'number_to_process': 10}\nAddFive Node: Added 5, result is 15\nMultiplyByTwo Node: Multiplied, final answer is 30\nMath game finished. Whiteboard looks like: {'number_to_process': 10, 'intermediate_result': 15, 'final_answer': 30}\n</code></pre></div><p>See? Each Node is simple. The  dictionary carries the data. The  manager makes sure  runs, then .</p><p>Now, just swap our math workers for chatbot workers:</p><ul><li> becomes .</li><li> becomes .</li><li>  And instead of just a  signal,  will return  to loop back or  to move forward.</li></ul><p>The pattern is exactly the same. Now that we have our blueprint, let's build the three \"workers\" that make our chatbot come to life.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  4. Building the Brain: A Look Under the Hood\n</h2><p>Alright, theory's over. Let's look at the actual code that makes our chatbot's brain tick. By the end of this section, you'll understand the entire backend, from the high-level workflow down to the individual \"workers.\"</p><p><em>(Note: We've simplified the code below to focus on the core ideas. For the complete, unabridged version, you can view the full code in the <a href=\"https://github.com/The-Pocket/Website-AI-Chatbot\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">project on GitHub</a>.)</em></p><p>First, let's look at our workflow diagram. This is the entire brain of our operation: a simple loop.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  The Assembly Line Instructions ()\n</h3><p>Before we build the individual workers, let's look at the instructions that tell them how to work together. This is our  file, and it's the \"manager\" that directs the assembly line.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>That's the entire orchestration logic. It's a simple, readable blueprint for our agent's behavior.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  The Shared Whiteboard ( dictionary)\n</h3><p>Next, our workers need a central place to read and write information. This is just a simple Python dictionary that holds the state of our operation.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Now let's look at the simplified code for our three specialist nodes.</p><h4>\n  \n  \n  1. : The Librarian\n</h4><p>This  efficiently processes a list of URLs. Its job is to read a page and return its text and any new links it finds.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p> It crawls each page on its to-do list, stores the content, and adds any new, unique links to the master URL list.</p><h4>\n  \n  \n  2. : The Brain\n</h4><p>This node looks at what we've learned and decides what to do next, returning a signal to the Flow.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p> It asks the AI for a strategy ( or ) and returns that exact signal to the Flow, which knows what to do next.</p><h4>\n  \n  \n  3. : The Writer\n</h4><p>Once the Brain says , this node crafts the final response.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p> It gathers all the text we found, gives it to the AI, and asks it to write a beautiful, helpful response.</p><p>And that's the core of the system. Three simple nodes, each with a clear job, passing data through a simple dictionary.</p><p>Now that the magic is revealed (and you see it's not so magical after all), let's give our chatbot a pretty face so you can put it on your website.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  5. Giving Our Bot a Face: From Terminal to Website\n</h2><p>Okay, we have a functional AI brain that runs in the terminal. That's a great start, but it's not very useful for your website visitors.</p><p>Let's connect that brain to a user-friendly chat bubble. This is a classic web development pattern with two simple parts: a  (our Python script) and a  (the chat bubble on a website).</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  The Architecture: A Brain and a Face\n</h3><ol><li> This is our Python script, . Its only job is to wait for a question, run our PocketFlow logic to find the answer, and send the answer back. It's the powerhouse that does all the heavy lifting.</li><li> This is a small piece of JavaScript, , that you add to your website. It creates the chat icon and the chat window. When a user types a question, the JavaScript simply sends it to our backend for processing.</li></ol><p>They communicate over the network. The frontend asks a question, and the backend provides the answer.</p><p>Let's look at the minimal code that makes each part work.</p><p>We use a lightweight Python framework called  to create a simple web server. Its job is to expose a single \"endpoint\" (like a URL) that the frontend can send questions to.</p><p>Here’s the core logic in :</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p> The server waits for a POST request at . When it gets one, it runs the same PocketFlow we built before and sends the result back.</p><p>This is the JavaScript that lives on your website. It listens for the user to click \"send,\" then makes a simple web request to our Python backend.</p><p>Here's the simplified logic from :</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p> When the user sends a message, it packages up the question and sends it to the  endpoint on our server. When the server responds, it displays the answer.</p><p>Now the process is clear:</p><ol><li> First, you need to run the brain. In your terminal, run . This starts the web server and gets it ready to answer questions.</li><li><strong>Add the Frontend to a Page:</strong> Next, you add the <code>&lt;script src=\"chatbot.js\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</code> tag to your website's HTML. This makes the chat bubble appear.</li></ol><p>To make testing easy, the project includes a sample  file that already has the script included. Once your server is running, just open that file in your browser to see your live, interactive chatbot in action</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  6. Conclusion: Simple, Maintainable, and Live\n</h2><p>Let's take a step back. We just built a fully-functional AI chatbot that can intelligently answer questions about any website.</p><p>And we did it without touching a single vector database, writing a complex data-syncing script, or worrying about our information ever going stale. Its brain is your live website, which means its knowledge is always up-to-date.</p><p>This isn't just another chatbot. This is a better, simpler way to build one. Here’s why this approach wins:</p><ul><li> Your bot’s knowledge is never stale. When you update your website, you've instantly updated your chatbot. There is no sync step, ever.</li><li><strong>Practically Zero-Maintenance.</strong> You can finally \"set it and forget it.\" Your only job is to keep your website current—something you were already doing anyway.</li><li> Because the entire system is built on PocketFlow and a few straightforward Python scripts, the logic is easy to read and modify. There are no black boxes to fight with.</li></ul><p>The days of babysitting your AI are over. You now have the blueprint for a system that’s not only intelligent but also practical and sustainable.</p><p>Ready to add a real-time brain to your own website?</p><p><em>The complete, open-source code for this chatbot is waiting for you on GitHub.

This detailed, focused observation is similar to how Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) \"see\" images. These powerful algorithms are revolutionizing how computers process visual information, unlocking possibilities previously confined to the human mind.</p><p>CNNs are a specialized type of artificial neural network, designed specifically for processing data with a grid-like topology, such as images and videos. Unlike traditional neural networks that treat data as a flat sequence, CNNs leverage the spatial relationships within data, making them exceptionally effective at image recognition, object detection, and more.</p><p><strong>Understanding the Core Concepts:</strong></p><p>At the heart of a CNN lies the \"convolution\" operation. Think of it like a magnifying glass sliding across an image. This magnifying glass, called a filter or kernel, is a small matrix of weights. As it moves across the image, it multiplies its weights with the corresponding pixel values under it, summing the results to produce a single number. This number represents a feature extracted from that specific area of the image. For example, one filter might be sensitive to edges, another to corners, and another to textures.</p><p>This process is repeated across the entire image, creating a feature map – a representation of the image highlighting the presence and location of specific features. Multiple filters are used simultaneously, each detecting different features, resulting in multiple feature maps. These maps are then typically passed through a pooling layer, which downsamples the data, reducing its dimensionality while preserving important features. This process helps to make the network more efficient and less sensitive to small variations in the input.</p><p>The output of the pooling layer then feeds into further convolutional and pooling layers, progressively extracting higher-level features. Finally, the extracted features are fed into a fully connected layer, similar to those in traditional neural networks, which performs the final classification or prediction.</p><p><strong>Significance and Problem Solving:</strong></p><p>CNNs address the long-standing challenge of enabling computers to understand and interpret visual information. Before CNNs became prevalent, image recognition relied on hand-crafted features and rules, a laborious and often inaccurate process. CNNs, however, learn these features directly from the data, achieving remarkable accuracy and efficiency.</p><p><strong>Applications and Transformative Impact:</strong></p><p>The impact of CNNs is far-reaching and spans numerous industries:</p><ul><li>  CNNs are used for disease detection in X-rays, MRIs, and CT scans, assisting radiologists in making faster and more accurate diagnoses.  They can detect subtle anomalies often missed by the human eye.</li><li>  Object detection and recognition are crucial for autonomous vehicles.  CNNs enable cars to identify pedestrians, vehicles, traffic signs, and other obstacles, ensuring safe navigation.</li><li>  From unlocking smartphones to security systems, CNNs power facial recognition technologies.  While raising ethical concerns (discussed below), their accuracy is continuously improving.</li><li><strong>Satellite Imagery Analysis:</strong>  CNNs analyze satellite images to monitor deforestation, track urban sprawl, and assess the impact of natural disasters.</li><li>  CNNs help robots navigate complex environments, recognize objects, and perform tasks requiring visual input.</li><li><strong>Image Enhancement and Restoration:</strong>  CNNs are used to improve the quality of images, removing noise, sharpening details, and even inpainting missing parts of an image.</li></ul><p><strong>Challenges, Limitations, and Ethical Considerations:</strong></p><p>Despite their remarkable success, CNNs face several challenges:</p><ul><li>  CNNs require vast amounts of labeled data for training, which can be expensive and time-consuming to obtain.</li><li>  Training large CNNs can be computationally intensive, requiring powerful hardware and significant energy consumption.</li><li><strong>Explainability (Black Box Problem):</strong>  Understanding why a CNN makes a particular prediction can be difficult, raising concerns about transparency and accountability, especially in critical applications like medical diagnosis.</li><li>  CNNs can inherit biases present in the training data, leading to unfair or discriminatory outcomes.  Addressing this requires careful data curation and model evaluation.</li><li><strong>Security and Adversarial Attacks:</strong>  CNNs can be vulnerable to adversarial attacks, where small, almost imperceptible changes to an image can lead to misclassification.  This poses security risks in applications like autonomous driving and security systems.</li></ul><p><strong>Conclusion: A Future Shaped by Sight</strong></p><p>Convolutional Neural Networks represent a significant advancement in artificial intelligence, revolutionizing our ability to process and understand visual information. While challenges remain, particularly concerning data bias and explainability, the potential benefits are immense. As research continues and computational power increases, CNNs will undoubtedly play an even more crucial role in shaping the future across various sectors, from healthcare and transportation to environmental monitoring and beyond.

This was the challenge that sparked \"Yuh Hear Dem,\" our submission for the . The project began as a father-daughter mentoring journey into AI and evolved into a powerful tool for civic engagement in Barbados. It combines deep experience in backend AI architecture with a fresh perspective on user experience, guided by principles from the world of education. This blend allowed us to build a system that is not only technically sophisticated but also genuinely accessible, transforming the way citizens can interact with their government.</p><p>This post details our technical journey, from the initial data pipeline to a crucial architectural pivot, all powered by Google's Agent Development Kit (ADK), Gemini, and a Knowledge Graph backend.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  The Problem: From Hours of Video to Actionable Insight\n</h3><p>Parliamentary sessions in Barbados, like in many places, are published as long-form YouTube videos. Finding what a specific minister said about a particular topic, like the \"sugar tax,\" requires manually scrubbing through hours of footage. This creates a significant barrier to civic engagement.</p><p>Our goal was to transform this unstructured data into a structured, queryable format, allowing any citizen to ask a natural language question and get a direct, source-verified answer.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  The Solution: An AI-Powered Parliamentary Research Assistant\n</h3><p>\"Yuh Hear Dem\" (Bajan dialect for \"Did you hear them?\") is a conversational agent that allows users to query parliamentary data. A user can ask, <em>\"What has been discussed about the sugar tax?\"</em> and receive a concise summary, direct quotes from MPs, and links to the exact moments in the source videos.</p><p>The system is built on a sophisticated Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline that combines the semantic power of vector search with the structured precision of a knowledge graph.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  The Technical Architecture: A Three-Stage Pipeline\n</h3><p>Our system is built on a robust data processing and retrieval pipeline.</p><p><strong>1. Ingest, Clean, Extract</strong></p><p>The foundation of our system is a structured knowledge base built from raw, messy transcripts.</p><ul><li> We start by ingesting the full YouTube transcripts from hundreds of parliamentary session videos—over 1,200 hours of content.</li><li> The raw transcripts are often riddled with grammatical errors and misattributions. We use  to clean and structure this text, correcting grammar, identifying speakers, and aligning the text with accurate video timestamps.</li><li> With clean, timestamped text, we use Gemini again to perform entity and relationship extraction. It identifies people, topics, bills, and the connections between them (e.g., \"Minister X  Bill Y\"). This structured data, including over 33,000 nodes and 86,000 statements, is stored in .</li></ul><p>This process creates a rich, interconnected Knowledge Graph that forms the backbone of our agent's \"brain.\"</p><p><strong>2. Hybrid Retrieval with GraphRAG</strong></p><p>When a user asks a question, the agent doesn't just rely on a simple semantic search. It uses a hybrid retrieval strategy:</p><ul><li> We run a vector search over MongoDB Atlas embeddings to find semantically similar transcript segments. This is great for broad, topic-based queries.</li><li> We traverse the entities and relationships in our knowledge graph to find precise connections (e.g., <code>Minister -&gt; Topic -&gt; Session</code>). This excels at specific, factual queries.</li></ul><p>The results are combined and ranked using a hybrid scoring model (GraphRAG), giving us the best of both worlds. Critically, every piece of information is grounded in video timestamps, allowing us to generate direct links to the source.</p><p><strong>3. The Agent Architecture Evolution: A Lesson in Pragmatism</strong></p><p>Our journey with ADK taught us a valuable lesson about the current state of multi-agent frameworks.</p><p><strong>The Original Vision: A Multi-Agent Pipeline</strong></p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Initially, we designed a classic multi-agent system using a . The idea was to have a clear separation of concerns:</p><ul><li> The main entry point.</li><li><strong>ResearchPipeline ():</strong><ul><li> Collects data from our knowledge graph.</li><li> Enriches the data with video sources and timestamps.</li><li> Synthesizes the final response.</li></ul></li></ul><p><strong>The Roadblock: Session State Management</strong></p><p>We quickly hit a wall. We found that  was not being reliably shared between the agents in our  pipeline. The  would fetch data, but by the time the flow reached the  or , the state was often empty or corrupted.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>This appears to be a known challenge, which we tracked in <a href=\"https://github.com/google/adk-python/issues/1119\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">GitHub Issue #1119</a>. This roadblock became a critical learning moment: while the theory of multi-agent systems is powerful, the practical implementation can be fraught with state management complexities.</p><p><strong>The Pivot: A Robust Single-Agent Solution</strong></p><p>To solve this, we refactored our architecture into a <strong>single intelligent agent with a set of specialized function tools</strong>. This approach proved to be far more reliable and easier to debug.</p><p>The agent maintains context reliably, and the tools are called synchronously, ensuring data is passed correctly.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>This pragmatic pivot allowed us to achieve our desired modularity—with each tool handling a specific task—without the overhead and unreliability of inter-agent state management.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  The User Experience: Making AI Accessible\n</h3><p>Technology is only as good as its interface. Our focus on educational design was instrumental here. The frontend was built to make the agent's powerful capabilities accessible to everyone.</p><p>Key design principles included:</p><ul><li> Information is presented in expandable cards, preventing cognitive overload. Users see a high-level summary first and can expand for details.</li><li> We used D3.js to create interactive knowledge graphs, helping users visually understand the relationships between speakers, topics, and sessions.</li><li> The agent uses the knowledge graph to generate relevant follow-up questions, guiding users on natural exploration paths.</li></ul><h3>\n  \n  \n  Conclusion and What's Next\n</h3><p>\"Yuh Hear Dem\" is more than just a technical demo; it's a functioning tool for enhancing democratic transparency. Our journey taught us several key lessons:</p><ol><li> Combining knowledge graphs and vector search provides superior retrieval accuracy.</li><li> While multi-agent state sharing needs maturing, ADK’s single-agent with function tools model is incredibly robust for building complex, reliable AI systems.</li><li> A simpler, more reliable architecture is often better than a theoretically \"purer\" but fragile one.</li><li><strong>Human-Centered Design is Key:</strong> An intuitive UI, grounded in learning principles, is essential for making powerful AI accessible and useful.</li></ol><p>We invite you to explore the project yourself.</p><p>Our next steps involve expanding the data sources to include official legislative documents and exploring a return to a multi-agent architecture as the ADK framework evolves. For now, we're proud to have built a tool that helps citizens hear what really matters.</p>","contentLength":6914,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"QuCode - 21DaysChallenge - Day 18","url":"https://dev.to/paulobmsousa/qucode-21dayschallenge-day-18-2im1","date":1750287826,"author":"Paulo B.M.

Here's a complete AI tracer bullet for a document classification system—the kind of thing that could take months to \"do properly\" but can be validated in days.</p><p>I'll show you two implementations: Python (Flask) for data science teams and JavaScript (Node.js) for frontend-heavy teams:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p><strong>For JavaScript/Node.js teams</strong>, here's the equivalent tracer bullet:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><h3>\n  \n  \n  🔍 What Makes This a Tracer Bullet?\n</h3><p>This isn't just a prototype—it's a  that proves the concept:</p><ol><li>: Accepts messy input, handles edge cases</li><li>: Uses a real model, not mock responses</li><li>: Other systems can integrate with it</li><li>: Runs as a service, includes health checks</li><li>: Logs performance, catches errors</li></ol><p>You can deploy this to a cloud service today and start getting real user feedback.

When it wasn't viable, I pivoted early instead of doubling down on a doomed approach.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  🔧 <strong>Real Integration Challenges</strong></h3><p>I discovered that our \"95% accurate\" sentiment model was useless because inference took 45 seconds. The tracer bullet forced us to find a faster model before we'd invested months in the slow one.</p><p>Showing a working demo (even a simple one) gets way more excitement than showing accuracy charts. Non-technical stakeholders can actually  the tracer bullet.</p><p>Each iteration adds one more critical piece. Maybe it's better data processing, maybe it's model optimization, maybe it's UI improvements. You're always building on something that works.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  📊 Real Case Study: E-commerce Content Moderation\n</h2><p>Let me share a concrete example from a client project that demonstrates the power of AI tracer bullets:</p><p>: An e-commerce platform needed to automatically moderate user-generated product reviews for inappropriate content (spam, hate speech, fake reviews).</p><p> (what they almost did):</p><ul><li>📊 Spend 8-12 weeks building a custom classification model\n</li><li>🧪 Achieve 94% accuracy on curated test data</li><li>💾 Require 16GB RAM and custom GPU infrastructure</li><li>📝 Total estimated cost: $150k and 6 months to production</li></ul><p><strong>Our Tracer Bullet Approach</strong> (what we actually did):</p><p>: Built the Node.js tracer bullet using OpenAI's moderation API</p><ul><li>⚡ 3 days to working end-to-end demo</li><li>🔧 Integrated with their existing review system</li><li>📊 Started processing real user reviews immediately</li></ul><ul><li>✅  on real production data (better than planned custom model!)</li><li>⚡ <strong>200ms average response time</strong> (vs. projected 45 seconds)</li><li>💰 <strong>$500/month operational cost</strong> (vs. $150k development cost)</li><li>🚀 <strong>Zero infrastructure changes</strong> needed</li></ul><p> that saved the project:</p><ol><li><strong>API latency was acceptable</strong>: 200ms vs. feared \"too slow for real-time\"</li><li>: 10k reviews/day fit well within API limits\n</li><li><strong>Edge cases were different</strong>: Real spam was simpler than test data suggested</li><li><strong>Integration was the hard part</strong>: Not the AI, but webhook reliability and error handling</li></ol><ul><li>🎯  instead of 6 months</li><li>💰  in development costs</li><li>📈  due to cleaner review sections</li><li>🔄 : Easy to swap AI providers or add custom models later</li></ul><p>This is the power of AI tracer bullets: <strong>real validation with real metrics in real time</strong>.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  🚀 Beyond POCs: Production-Ready Thinking\n</h2><p>The magic of AI tracer bullets isn't just speed—it's that they force you to think like a production system from day one:</p><ul><li>: How do you validate inputs?</li><li>: How do you know if it's working?</li><li>: Can it handle real load?</li><li>: How do you update the model?</li></ul><p>According to recent research:</p><ul><li> show that 85% of AI projects fail to reach production</li><li> indicate average AI POC takes 6 months, but 70% never see production</li><li> demonstrate API-based inference is 3-10x faster than local deployment for most use cases</li></ul><p>The primary reason for failures? Teams focus on model accuracy instead of system integration. AI tracer bullets flip this priority.</p><p>💡 : Use Hugging Face Inference Endpoints for your first tracer bullet—they handle scaling, caching, and model optimization automatically. Perfect for validating concepts before committing to infrastructure.</p><p>💡 : Always log three metrics from day one: inference time, input size, and error rate. These will guide your scaling decisions later.</p><p>💡 : Network timeouts kill user experience. Set aggressive timeouts (5-10s max) and always have fallback responses ready.</p><p>The next time you're tempted to spend weeks perfecting a model in isolation, try this instead:</p><div><table><thead><tr></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Identify smallest end-to-end slice</td><td>Clear success/failure criteria</td></tr><tr><td>Use pre-trained models, cloud APIs</td><td>Working demo in days, not weeks</td></tr><tr><td>Use messy, incomplete real data</td><td>Discover real blockers early</td></tr><tr><td>Track performance, accuracy, UX</td><td>Data-driven decisions for v2</td></tr><tr><td>Let usage drive next improvements</td><td>Continuous value delivery</td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>Remember: The goal isn't to build the perfect AI system. It's to prove your concept can work in the real world, then make it better.</p><p>💡 : Pick one of the code examples above, replace the model with your use case (OpenAI API, Google Vision, etc.), and deploy to Vercel/Heroku in under an hour. You'll learn more in that hour than in weeks of model tweaking.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  📚 Resources &amp; Further Reading\n</h2><h3>\n  \n  \n  🎯 Recommended Tools for Tracer Bullets\n</h3><ul><li> - Rapid deployment of ML model interfaces</li><li> - Ultra-fast APIs for AI services</li><li> - Containerization for reproducible deployments</li></ul><h3>\n  \n  \n  📊 Share Your Experience: AI Tracer Bullets in Practice\n</h3><p>Help improve this methodology by sharing your experience in the comments or on social media with :</p><p><strong>Key questions to consider</strong>:</p><ul><li>What's the shortest time you've gone from AI idea to working prototype?</li><li>Which cloud AI services surprised you with speed/accuracy for rapid validation?</li><li>What integration challenges did you discover that notebooks never showed?</li><li>Have you found cases where the tracer bullet became your production system?</li></ul><p><em>Your insights help the AI development community learn faster validation techniques.</em></p><p>In our next commandment, we'll explore why your AI models should be \"good enough\" instead of perfect, and how optimization can actually hurt your project's success.</p><p>Have you tried building AI tracer bullets?

You're not alone! Many developers find themselves wrestling with boilerplate code and confusing configurations. FastAPI swoops in as a modern, high-performance web framework for building APIs with Python 3.7+ that's actually  to use. This guide will walk you through creating your first production-ready FastAPI application, even if you're a complete beginner.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  What Makes FastAPI So Special?\n</h2><p>Why choose FastAPI over other frameworks like Flask or Django REST Framework? Well, FastAPI offers several key advantages:</p><ul><li> Built on top of Starlette and Pydantic, FastAPI delivers blazing-fast performance, comparable to NodeJS and Go.</li><li><strong>Automatic Data Validation:</strong> Pydantic handles data validation and serialization, reducing errors and simplifying your code.</li><li><strong>Automatic API Documentation:</strong> FastAPI generates interactive API documentation (using Swagger UI and ReDoc) automatically, making it easy to test and explore your API.</li><li> Leverages Python type hints for improved code readability and maintainability.</li><li> A powerful design pattern built right in that simplifies testing and code organization.</li></ul><p>Let's dive into creating a simple \"To-Do\" API to illustrate these features.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Setting Up Your Environment\n</h2><p>Before we write any code, let's set up our development environment. I recommend using a virtual environment to isolate your project's dependencies.</p><ol><li><p><strong>Create a Virtual Environment:</strong></p><p>Open your terminal and navigate to your project directory. Then, run the following command:</p></li><li><p><strong>Activate the Virtual Environment:</strong></p></li></ol><div><pre><code>*   On macOS/Linux:\n\n    bash\n    source venv/bin/activate\n\n*   On Windows:\n\n    bash\n    venv\\Scripts\\activate\n</code></pre></div><ol><li><p><strong>Install FastAPI and Uvicorn:</strong></p><p>Uvicorn is an ASGI (Asynchronous Server Gateway Interface) server that we'll use to run our FastAPI application. Run this command to install both:</p><p>bash\npip install fastapi uvicorn</p></li></ol><p>That's it! Your environment is ready.</p><p> A virtual environment keeps your project dependencies separate, avoiding conflicts. Always activate it before working on your project.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Building Your First API Endpoint\n</h2><p>Now for the fun part! Let's create a simple API endpoint that returns a list of to-do items. Create a file named  in your project directory and add the following code:</p><p>python\nfrom fastapi import FastAPI\nfrom pydantic import BaseModel</p><p>class Todo(BaseModel):\n    id: int\n    completed: bool = False</p><p>todos = [\n    Todo(id=1, task=\"Learn FastAPI\", completed=True),<p>\n    Todo(id=2, task=\"Build a to-do API\", completed=True),</p>\n    Todo(id=3, task=\"Deploy the API\", completed=False),</p><p>@app.get(\"/todos\", response_model=List[Todo])\nasync def get_todos():<p>\n    \"\"\"Retrieves all to-do items.\"\"\"</p>\n    return todos</p><p>@app.post(\"/todos\", response_model=Todo)\nasync def create_todo(todo: Todo): # Notice the type hinting! FastAPI validates the incoming data against the Todo model<p>\n    \"\"\"Creates a new to-do item.\"\"\"</p>\n    todos.append(todo)</p><p>Let's break down what's happening here:</p><ol><li> We import  to create our application,  for type hinting, and  from  to define our data model.</li><li> We define a  class using . This class represents a to-do item and includes fields for , , and . Pydantic handles automatic validation and serialization based on this model.</li><li> We create an instance of the  class, which will be our main application object.</li><li>  We create a list of sample  objects for demonstration purposes.</li><li> We define a GET endpoint at  using the  decorator.  The <code>response_model=List[Todo]</code> argument tells FastAPI to serialize the returned data as a list of  objects. The  keyword indicates that this is an asynchronous function, which is crucial for FastAPI's performance.</li><li> We define a POST endpoint also at  using the  decorator. This endpoint takes a  object as input (notice the type hint ). FastAPI automatically validates the incoming data against the  model. If the data is invalid, FastAPI will return an error response. The new  is appended to the  list and returned.</li></ol><p>✅   FastAPI uses type hints extensively.  This not only improves code readability but also enables automatic data validation and API documentation.</p><p>To run your API, execute the following command in your terminal:</p><p>bash\nuvicorn main:app --reload</p><ul><li> is the name of the file where your FastAPI application is defined.</li><li> is the name of the FastAPI instance.</li><li> enables automatic reloading, so your server will restart whenever you make changes to your code.   Don't use  in production!</li></ul><p>Now, open your browser and navigate to <code>http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs</code>. You should see the Swagger UI, which provides interactive documentation for your API. You can use it to test your endpoints.</p><p> Uvicorn runs your FastAPI app. The  flag is great for development but avoid it in production.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Going Further: Automatic API Documentation\n</h2><p>One of the coolest features of FastAPI is its automatic API documentation. As you saw in the previous step, navigating to  provides a Swagger UI interface.  FastAPI also provides an alternative documentation interface at .</p><p>FastAPI generates this documentation based on the type hints and docstrings in your code. This makes it incredibly easy to keep your API documentation up-to-date.</p><p>✅   Write clear and concise docstrings for your API endpoints.  These docstrings will be displayed in the API documentation.</p><p> Embrace FastAPI's auto-generated docs. It saves time and keeps your API understandable.</p><p>In this tutorial, you've learned how to create a simple yet powerful API using FastAPI. You've seen how FastAPI leverages type hints, Pydantic, and automatic documentation to streamline the development process.</p><p>Next steps?

Each approach balances expressiveness with Python's inherent readability. When I design domain-specific tools, I start with the simplest method that solves the problem, gradually adopting more advanced techniques as requirements evolve. The real power comes from combining these approaches - like using parser combinators with AST transformations or decorators with operator overloading. This flexibility lets me create solutions that feel like natural extensions of Python rather than foreign constructs.\n</code></pre></div><p>📘 , , , and  to the channel!</p><p> is an AI-driven publishing company co-founded by author .
