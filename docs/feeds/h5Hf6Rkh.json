That post set the stage for developers and testers who wanted to begin their journey into automation, but it was just the beginning.</p><p>As more development teams integrate quality earlier in the SDLC, there's increasing demand for professionals who can not only write clean Python code but also automate real-world scenarios on web applications. That‚Äôs where Selenium with Python comes in. This article is a step-by-step guide for those looking to connect their Python skills with browser-based automation, starting from scratch and growing toward building robust automation suites.</p><p>If you're a Python developer exploring QA responsibilities or a QA engineer wanting to strengthen your Python automation foundation, this is for you.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  What Is Selenium, and Why Pair It with Python?\n</h2><p>Selenium is the de facto standard for browser automation. It allows you to simulate everything a real user would do on a website‚Äîclicking, typing, scrolling, verifying content, navigating tabs, and more. Selenium WebDriver directly controls browsers like Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge, making it perfect for testing across environments.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Why Python for Selenium Automation?\n</h2><p>Python stands out for a few key reasons:</p><ul><li>Concise syntax: Short, readable scripts allow teams to iterate faster.</li><li>Powerful ecosystem: Integration with pytest, unittest, pandas, requests, and faker makes Python automation extremely flexible.</li><li>Beginner-friendly: New testers and developers can quickly start coding without excessive boilerplate.</li></ul><p>Together, <a href=\"https://www.testrigtechnologies.com/automation-testing/web-application-automation-testing-with-selenium-and-python-a-comprehensive-guide/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Selenium and Python </a>form a fast, maintainable, and extensible way to automate your testing process, without steep learning curves.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Step 1: Setting Up Selenium with Python\n</h2><p>Before you write a single test case, set up your Python + Selenium environment:</p><p><strong>1. Install Selenium via pip:</strong>\npip install selenium</p><p><strong>2. Download the Chrome WebDriver:</strong></p><p>Once setup is done, you‚Äôre ready to write your first browser automation script.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Step 2: Writing a Basic Selenium Test Script in Python\n</h2><p>Let‚Äôs create a simple automated test: open Google, perform a search, and close the browser.</p><p>from selenium import webdriver\nfrom selenium.webdriver.common.keys import Keys</p><p>driver = webdriver.Chrome()</p><p>search_box = driver.find_element(\"name\", \"q\")</p><p>search_box.send_keys(\"Selenium automation with Python\")\nsearch_box.send_keys(Keys.RETURN)</p><p>driver.implicitly_wait(5)\ndriver.quit()</p><ul><li>Opened a browser and navigated to a URL</li><li>Found a search input element using the name locator</li><li>Typed a query and submitted it</li><li>Waited for results and closed the session</li></ul><p>This is your first successful test of a working UI automation flow!</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Step 3: Locating and Interacting with Web Elements\n</h2><p>Selenium allows you to find and interact with web elements using multiple strategies. Some commonly used methods include:</p><ul></ul><p>from selenium.webdriver.common.by import By</p><p>email_input = driver.find_element(By.ID, \"email\")\nemail_input.send_keys(\"<a href=\"mailto:test@example.com\">test@example.com</a>\")</p><p>You can also perform advanced actions like:</p><ul></ul><p>These interactions simulate actual user behavior, helping you verify UI flows more reliably.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Step 4: Dealing with Waits ‚Äì The Right Way\n</h2><p>Web apps are dynamic, and elements don‚Äôt always load instantly. Without waits, your test may fail because the element wasn‚Äôt there‚Äîyet.</p><p>Implicit Wait:\nApplies globally:</p><p>driver.implicitly_wait(10)  # Seconds</p><p>Explicit Wait:\nTargeted, preferred in modern test scripts:</p><p>from selenium.webdriver.support.ui import WebDriverWait\nfrom selenium.webdriver.support import expected_conditions as EC</p><p>element = WebDriverWait(driver, 15).until(\n    EC.presence_of_element_located((By.ID, \"username\"))</p><p>Use explicit waits when you need to validate specific states like visibility, presence, or clickability.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Step 5: Managing Dynamic Test Data\n</h2><p>Hardcoded values might work in small tests, but for scalable automation, parameterized, random, or external test data is essential.</p><ul><li>CSV or Excel files (via pandas)</li><li>JSON files for structured test cases</li><li>Data generation libraries like faker</li></ul><p>fake = Faker()\nprint(fake.name())        # Random full name<p>\nprint(fake.email())       # Random email address</p></p><p>This reduces repetition and improves test realism‚Äîespecially in sign-up or form automation.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Step 6: Structuring and Scaling Your Test Suite\n</h2><p>As your test cases grow, proper structuring becomes critical. Key practices include:</p><ul><li>Using pytest for test discovery, grouping, and fixtures</li><li>Modularizing test logic into reusable functions</li><li>Separating page locators using Page Object Model (POM)</li><li>Externalizing configuration (URLs, credentials, etc.)</li></ul><p>Sample test file structure:</p><p>tests/\n  test_login.py\npages/\n  signup_page.py\n  data_generator.py</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Final Thoughts: Python + Selenium Is Just the Beginning\n</h2><p>Selenium with Python gives you direct control over browser-based tests, helping you ensure real user experiences are not just functional, but consistent across deployments.</p><p>Whether you're building a test suite from scratch or integrating with CI/CD platforms like Jenkins or GitHub Actions‚ÄîPython provides the flexibility and readability to scale your automation goals effectively.</p><p><strong>Need Help Scaling Your Python Test Automation?</strong>\nAs a leading <a href=\"https://www.testrigtechnologies.com/web-automation-testing-services/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Web Automation Testing Company</a>, at Testrig Technologies, we help QA and DevOps teams build reliable, scalable, and CI-ready automation solutions using Python, Selenium, Playwright, and other modern frameworks.</p>","contentLength":5524,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"[Boost]","url":"https://dev.to/osiris8/-1anh","date":1751443214,"author":"Osiris8","guid":180396,"unread":true,"content":"<h2>Build and Deploy a Fullstack AI App with Flask, React, JWT, Neon Database, Mistral &amp; Groq Cloud ‚Äì Project Milo Part 1 (Backend)</h2>","contentLength":129,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Build and Deploy a Fullstack AI App with Flask, React, JWT, Neon Database, Mistral & Groq Cloud ‚Äì Project Milo Part 1 (Backend)","url":"https://dev.to/osiris8/build-a-fullstack-ai-app-with-flask-react-jwt-neon-database-mistral-groq-cloud-project-milo-3k0f","date":1751442222,"author":"Osiris8","guid":180395,"unread":true,"content":"<p>In this video, we‚Äôre building Milo, a fullstack AI assistant app using Flask, React, JWT authentication, and powerful Groq Cloud AI models like Mistral, Gemma, LLaMA, and more.</p><p>üíª On the backend, we‚Äôll create APIs with Flask, secure them with JWT, and connect to different AI models using Groq Cloud.</p><p>üöÄ Whether you want to integrate your own AI assistant or explore Mistral models in a real project, this video is for you.</p><ul><li>React (in upcoming Part 2)</li></ul><ul><li>Models Concepts: Create Models (User &amp; Prompt)\n</li><li>Routes Concepts: Auth Route &amp; Test with Postman\n</li><li>Use Mistral AI: Create, Read, Update, Delete Prompts\n</li><li>OpenAI vs Groq AI API Overview\n</li><li>First Deployment with Mistral AI\n</li><li>Use Other AI Models via Groq Cloud\n</li><li>Install Groq Cloud, Create Routes &amp; Test with Postman\n</li><li>Second Deployment &amp; Test Groq Models (Gemma, LLaMA, Mistral, DeepSeek...)</li></ul><p>üß† By the end of this video, you‚Äôll be able to:</p><ul><li>Build a secure backend with Flask and JWT</li><li>Interact with multiple AI models via Groq Cloud</li><li>Deploy and test your app with real prompts</li></ul>","contentLength":1010,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Feedback needed: Mini Data Cleaning & Feature Engineering Project (Caf√© Sales)","url":"https://dev.to/daniel_szakacs/feedback-needed-mini-data-cleaning-feature-engineering-project-cafe-sales-29f9","date":1751441165,"author":"Daniel Szakacs","guid":180394,"unread":true,"content":"<p>I'm fairly new to data work and just finished a small project to get hands-on experience with data cleaning and feature engineering.

Or seen a piece of writing generated by AI that‚Äôs almost indistinguishable from something written by a person? These experiences are becoming increasingly common thanks to Large Language Models (LLMs). But what exactly  these powerful tools, and what does their rise mean for the future?</p><p>LLMs are sophisticated computer programs designed to understand and generate human language. Think of them as incredibly advanced autocomplete systems, but on a massive scale. Instead of suggesting the next word in a sentence, they can generate entire paragraphs, essays, even poems, based on the input they receive. This ability stems from their ‚Äútraining‚Äù on massive datasets of text and code ‚Äì think of it as reading every book, article, and website ever written. This massive exposure allows them to learn patterns, relationships between words, and the nuances of human language.</p><p>Imagine teaching a child to write by showing them countless examples of well-written stories. Eventually, the child learns the rules of grammar, sentence structure, and even develops a unique writing style. LLMs work similarly, but at a scale unimaginable to human learning. They analyze billions of words, identifying statistical probabilities of word combinations and contextual relationships. This enables them to predict the most likely next word, sentence, or paragraph in response to a given prompt.</p><p>The significance of LLMs cannot be overstated. They represent a leap forward in artificial intelligence, pushing the boundaries of what computers can achieve in understanding and generating human-quality text. This has far-reaching implications across numerous fields. They address problems like the need for efficient content creation, accurate translation, and personalized learning experiences, while also opening up opportunities for innovation we are only beginning to understand.</p><p><strong>Applications and Transformative Impact:</strong></p><p>The applications of LLMs are already vast and rapidly expanding. Here are a few key examples:</p><ul><li> LLMs can generate various forms of content, including articles, marketing copy, scripts, and even creative writing. This can significantly increase efficiency for businesses and individuals, streamlining content production and potentially reducing costs.</li><li> LLMs excel at translating text between languages, offering more accurate and nuanced translations than previous methods. This can break down communication barriers and facilitate global collaboration.</li><li>  AI-powered chatbots driven by LLMs provide instant customer support, answering frequently asked questions and resolving basic issues, freeing up human agents to handle more complex problems.</li><li> LLMs can personalize learning experiences by generating customized exercises, quizzes, and feedback for students.  They can also help create educational content in various formats.</li><li> LLMs can assist programmers by generating code snippets, suggesting improvements, and even helping to debug existing code, increasing development speed and efficiency.</li><li> LLMs can analyze medical texts, assist in diagnosis, and even help develop new treatments by identifying patterns and relationships in vast datasets.</li></ul><p><strong>Challenges, Limitations, and Ethical Considerations:</strong></p><p>Despite their potential, LLMs are not without limitations and challenges:</p><ul><li> LLMs are trained on existing data, which may reflect societal biases.  This can lead to the generation of biased or discriminatory outputs, requiring careful monitoring and mitigation strategies.</li><li> LLMs can sometimes generate incorrect or nonsensical information, a phenomenon known as ‚Äúhallucination.‚Äù  Their outputs should always be critically evaluated and verified.</li><li> The potential misuse of LLMs for malicious purposes, such as generating fake news or impersonating individuals, raises serious ethical concerns.  Robust safeguards and regulations are crucial to prevent such misuse.</li><li> The training of LLMs requires significant computational resources, leading to a substantial carbon footprint.  Developing more energy-efficient training methods is essential.</li><li>  The automation potential of LLMs raises concerns about job displacement in certain sectors.  Addressing this requires proactive measures like retraining and upskilling initiatives.</li></ul><p>Large Language Models represent a powerful and transformative technology with the potential to reshape numerous aspects of our lives. While challenges remain, ongoing research and development are actively addressing issues related to bias, accuracy, and ethical implications. As LLMs continue to evolve, we can expect even more sophisticated and impactful applications, further blurring the lines between human and machine intelligence. The key lies in responsible development, deployment, and regulation to ensure these powerful tools benefit humanity as a whole. The future of LLMs is not just about technological advancement; it's about navigating the ethical and societal implications to harness their potential for good.</p>","contentLength":5006,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"ANN","url":"https://dev.to/docmath/ann-5b8g","date":1751421621,"author":"Dr. Mathews K.

Maybe it didn‚Äôt break your program, but it‚Äôs not good practice. Leaving files or network connections open can cause resource leaks, meaning you‚Äôre using up system memory or leaving a file locked unnecessarily. That‚Äôs where context managers come in. They handle the ‚Äúsetup and teardown‚Äù automatically so you can focus on your logic without worrying about the cleanup.</p><p>This blog will guide you through:</p><ul><li>What a context manager is</li><li>How  and  work</li><li>Real-life use cases and examples</li><li>How to write your own context managers both class-based and function-based</li></ul><h2>\n  \n  \n  What Is a Context Manager?\n</h2><p>A context manager is a Python object that properly manages resources like files, network connections, or database sessions.

Here are some practical real-world problems you can solve with custom context managers.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  1. <strong>Automatically Closing Resources</strong></h3><p>Imagine you're working with file handles, network sockets, or database connections. You need to ensure they're closed no matter what happens.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><h3><strong>2.

This isn't science fiction; it's the reality of generative AI, specifically text-to-image models. These powerful algorithms are transforming how we create and interact with visual content, ushering in a new era of artistic expression and technological innovation.</p><p><strong>Understanding the Magic: How Text Becomes an Image</strong></p><p>At its core, a text-to-image model is a sophisticated computer program trained on massive datasets of images and their corresponding text descriptions. Think of it like teaching a child to draw by showing them countless pictures and telling them what they depict. Over time, the child learns to associate words with visual elements ‚Äì a \"fluffy white cat\" evokes images of soft fur and round eyes. Similarly, these AI models learn the complex relationships between words and visual features.</p><p>The process begins with a text prompt, a sentence or paragraph describing the desired image. This prompt is then fed into a neural network ‚Äì a complex system inspired by the human brain ‚Äì that has been trained to understand the meaning and nuances of language and translate them into visual representations. The network doesn't simply search for pre-existing images; it generates entirely new ones based on its learned understanding. It essentially \"paints\" a picture based on your textual instructions.</p><p>This process involves several intricate steps, including:</p><ul><li> The model converts the text prompt into a numerical representation that it can understand.</li><li> Using this numerical representation, the model generates a latent representation, a compressed form of the image.</li><li>  The latent representation is then decoded into a full-fledged image, often using techniques like diffusion models that gradually refine a noisy image into a coherent one.</li></ul><p><strong>Significance and Impact: A New Creative Frontier</strong></p><p>The significance of text-to-image models cannot be overstated. They democratize image creation, empowering individuals without artistic training to generate stunning visuals. This has profound implications across numerous fields:</p><ul><li><strong>Marketing and Advertising:</strong> Businesses can quickly and cost-effectively create compelling visuals for campaigns, websites, and social media.</li><li>  Generating diverse and detailed game assets becomes significantly faster and more efficient.</li><li>  Text-to-image models can aid in concept art, storyboarding, and even generating background elements.</li><li>  Students can use these tools to visualize abstract concepts and create engaging educational materials.</li><li>  Artists can utilize these models as powerful creative tools, augmenting their own skills and exploring new artistic styles.</li></ul><p><strong>Applications and Transformative Potential:</strong></p><p>The potential applications are vast and rapidly expanding. Imagine architects using text prompts to visualize building designs, fashion designers creating virtual garment prototypes, or scientists visualizing complex biological structures. The ability to translate abstract ideas into concrete visual representations opens up exciting possibilities across industries, accelerating innovation and streamlining workflows.</p><p><strong>Challenges, Limitations, and Ethical Considerations:</strong></p><p>Despite its immense potential, text-to-image technology faces several challenges:</p><ul><li>  Models trained on biased datasets can perpetuate harmful stereotypes in generated images.  Addressing this requires careful curation of training data and ongoing monitoring.</li><li>  The legal implications of AI-generated art are still being debated, raising questions about ownership and copyright infringement.</li><li><strong>Misinformation and Deepfakes:</strong>  The ease of creating realistic but fake images raises concerns about the spread of misinformation and the potential for malicious use.</li><li>  While creating new opportunities, the technology also raises concerns about potential job displacement in certain creative industries.</li></ul><p><strong>The Future of Text-to-Image Models:</strong></p><p>Text-to-image models are still evolving rapidly. Future developments will likely focus on improving image quality, enhancing control over generation parameters, and mitigating ethical concerns. We can expect to see more sophisticated models capable of understanding complex prompts, generating more realistic and diverse images, and even creating interactive and animated content directly from text.</p><p>In conclusion, generative AI's text-to-image models represent a significant leap forward in artificial intelligence and its application to visual content creation. While challenges remain, the transformative potential of this technology is undeniable. As it continues to evolve, it promises to revolutionize how we create, interact with, and understand the visual world around us, opening up exciting opportunities across numerous fields and shaping the future of creativity and innovation.</p>","contentLength":4877,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Creating a Website with Sphinx and Markdown","url":"https://www.blog.pythonlibrary.org/2025/07/01/creating-a-website-with-sphinx-and-markdown/","date":1751372880,"author":"Mike","guid":178904,"unread":true,"content":"<p><a href=\"https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/\">Sphinx</a> is a Python-based documentation builder.

We were using Celery with Redis as a broker, and a deserialization vulnerability in a custom authentication middleware allowed an attacker to inject malicious code into a job payload, ultimately gaining read access to sensitive data. The root cause wasn‚Äôt a missing security library, but a failure to properly validate the authentication token  the deserialization process, coupled with overly permissive pickling. This incident underscored the fact that authentication isn‚Äôt a single point solution; it‚Äôs a pervasive concern woven throughout the entire system, demanding meticulous attention to detail.  This post dives deep into the practicalities of authentication in modern Python ecosystems, focusing on architecture, performance, and real-world pitfalls.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  What is \"authentication\" in Python?\n</h3><p>Technically, authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user, device, or service. It answers the question \"Who are you?\".  In Python, there isn‚Äôt a single, definitive PEP governing authentication directly. However, PEP 484 ‚Äì Type Hints, and the broader ecosystem around static typing (mypy) are crucial for building robust authentication systems.  The  module, , and  allow us to define strict schemas for authentication tokens and credentials, enabling compile-time validation and reducing runtime errors.  CPython‚Äôs internal mechanisms for object identity () and hashing are fundamental to secure token generation and comparison.  The standard library‚Äôs  provides cryptographic hashing algorithms, but relying solely on it for authentication is rarely sufficient; dedicated libraries like  are essential for secure key management and encryption.</p><ol><li><p><strong>FastAPI Request Handling:</strong>  In a high-throughput API, authentication is typically handled via JWTs (JSON Web Tokens) passed in the  header.  We use a custom FastAPI dependency to extract, verify, and decode the JWT, attaching the user identity to the request context.  Performance is critical here; JWT verification must be fast to avoid latency spikes.</p></li><li><p><strong>Async Job Queues (Celery/RQ):</strong> As demonstrated by the incident above, authenticating tasks submitted to an asynchronous queue is vital.  We now sign task payloads with a HMAC (Hash-based Message Authentication Code) using a rotating secret key, verifying the signature before deserialization.</p></li><li><p><strong>Type-Safe Data Models (Pydantic):</strong>  When receiving data from external sources (e.g., user uploads, API calls), Pydantic models are used to define the expected schema. Authentication credentials are often embedded within these models, and validation ensures that only authorized data is processed.</p></li><li><p>  For command-line tools interacting with sensitive resources, we employ API keys or OAuth 2.0 tokens.  These credentials are stored securely (e.g., using ) and used to authenticate requests to a backend service.</p></li><li><p><strong>ML Preprocessing Pipelines:</strong>  Data pipelines often require access to sensitive data. Authentication is used to control access to data sources and ensure that only authorized users can train or deploy models.</p></li></ol><h3>\n  \n  \n  Integration with Python Tooling\n</h3><p>Our  reflects our commitment to static typing and code quality:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>We use FastAPI‚Äôs dependency injection system to manage authentication.  A custom middleware extracts the JWT, and a dependency validates it.  This separation of concerns makes testing easier and improves code readability.  Runtime hooks, like signal handlers, are used to refresh JWTs before they expire.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>This example demonstrates a dependency injection pattern for authentication.  The  function is a dependency that extracts and validates the JWT, returning the user ID.  This pattern promotes reusability and testability.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Failure Scenarios &amp; Debugging\n</h3><p>A common failure is incorrect JWT verification due to a mismatched secret key or algorithm.  This often manifests as a .  Debugging involves:</p><ol><li>  Detailed logging of the JWT payload and verification process.</li><li>  Stepping through the  function to inspect the token and key.</li><li>  Analyzing the full traceback to identify the source of the error.</li><li> Adding assertions to verify the expected format and content of the JWT.</li></ol><p>Another issue is race conditions in asynchronous authentication.  If multiple requests attempt to authenticate simultaneously, the verification process can become interleaved, leading to incorrect results.  Using appropriate locking mechanisms (e.g., ) can mitigate this risk.  We once encountered a memory leak in a Celery worker due to unclosed database connections within an authentication middleware.   and  were instrumental in identifying the leak.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Performance &amp; Scalability\n</h3><p>JWT verification is a performance bottleneck.  We‚Äôve optimized this by:</p><ol><li>  Caching verified JWT payloads in Redis to avoid redundant verification.</li><li><strong>Asynchronous Verification:</strong>  Performing JWT verification asynchronously using .</li><li>  Minimizing the use of global variables in the authentication process.</li><li>  Exploring the use of C extensions for cryptographic operations (though the gains are often marginal).</li></ol><p>Benchmarking with  and <code>asyncio.run(async_benchmark())</code> is crucial to measure the impact of these optimizations.</p><p>Insecure deserialization, as experienced in our production incident, is a major risk.  Always validate the authentication token  deserializing any data associated with it.  Avoid using  for untrusted data.  Code injection can occur if user-supplied data is used to construct SQL queries or shell commands.  Use parameterized queries and proper input validation to prevent this.  Privilege escalation can occur if authentication checks are bypassed or if users are granted excessive permissions.  Implement least privilege principles and regularly review access controls.</p><p>We employ a multi-layered testing strategy:</p><ol><li>  Testing individual authentication functions and dependencies.</li><li>  Testing the interaction between authentication and other components (e.g., FastAPI routes, Celery tasks).</li><li><strong>Property-Based Tests (Hypothesis):</strong>  Generating random JWT payloads to test the robustness of the verification process.</li><li>  Ensuring that all authentication code is type-safe.</li></ol><p>Our CI/CD pipeline includes:</p><ul><li> with code coverage reporting.</li><li> for testing against multiple Python versions.</li><li>GitHub Actions to run tests and linters on every pull request.</li><li> hooks to enforce code style and type checking.</li></ul><h3>\n  \n  \n  Common Pitfalls &amp; Anti-Patterns\n</h3><ol><li><strong>Storing Passwords in Plain Text:</strong>  Never store passwords directly. Use strong hashing algorithms (e.g., bcrypt, Argon2).</li><li><strong>Using  for Untrusted Data:</strong>  As mentioned,  is inherently insecure.</li><li>  Always verify the  claim in JWTs.</li><li><strong>Overly Permissive Access Controls:</strong>  Grant users only the minimum necessary permissions.</li><li><strong>Lack of Input Validation:</strong>  Validate all user-supplied data to prevent injection attacks.</li><li>  Never hardcode secrets in your code. Use environment variables or a secrets management system.</li></ol><h3>\n  \n  \n  Best Practices &amp; Architecture\n</h3><ul><li>  Use type hints extensively to improve code correctness and maintainability.</li><li>  Separate authentication logic from business logic.</li><li>  Assume that all user input is malicious.</li><li>  Break down authentication into small, reusable components.</li><li>  Use a layered configuration system to manage secrets and settings.</li><li>  Use dependency injection to improve testability and flexibility.</li><li>  Automate testing, linting, and deployment.</li><li>  Use Docker or other containerization technologies to ensure reproducible builds.</li><li>  Document all authentication code thoroughly.</li></ul><p>Authentication is a complex and critical aspect of modern Python systems.  Mastering the nuances of authentication, from secure token generation to robust validation and performance optimization, is essential for building reliable, scalable, and maintainable applications.  Prioritize static typing, rigorous testing, and a security-first mindset.  Refactor legacy code to address potential vulnerabilities, measure performance to identify bottlenecks, and continuously improve your authentication practices.  The cost of a security breach far outweighs the effort required to build a secure authentication system.</p>","contentLength":8220,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Day 9/100: While Loops with Real-World Examples","url":"https://dev.to/therahul_gupta/day-9100-while-loops-with-real-world-examples-528f","date":1751372522,"author":"Rahul Gupta","guid":178906,"unread":true,"content":"<p>Welcome to  of the  series!\nToday, we‚Äôll explore the power of  ‚Äî a tool that helps your program  actions until a certain condition is no longer true.</p><p>You‚Äôll also see how  loops are used in real-world applications, from input validation to simple games.</p><ul><li>How to control repetition with conditions</li><li>Real-world examples: password check, countdown, number guessing game</li></ul><p>A  loop repeats a block of code <strong>as long as a condition is </strong>.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><div><pre><code>Count: 1\nCount: 2\nCount: 3\nCount: 4\nCount: 5\n</code></pre></div><p>Once  becomes 6, the loop condition  is no longer true, so the loop stops.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  üö´ Avoiding Infinite Loops\n</h2><p>Make sure your loop condition  ‚Äî or you‚Äôll create an infinite loop:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><h2>\n  \n  \n  üõë Using  to Exit a Loop\n</h2><p>You can force-exit a loop using .</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><h2>\n  \n  \n  ‚è≠Ô∏è Using  to Skip an Iteration\n</h2><p> skips the rest of the loop for the current iteration and jumps to the next one.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>(Notice how 3 is skipped)</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  üîí Real-World Example 1: Password Checker\n</h2><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><h2>\n  \n  \n  ‚è≥ Real-World Example 2: Countdown Timer\n</h2><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><h2>\n  \n  \n  üéÆ Real-World Example 3: Number Guessing Game\n</h2><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><ul><li>How to use  loops for repeating tasks</li><li>How to use  to stop a loop early</li><li>How to use  to skip an iteration</li><li>Real-world examples like login validation and guessing games</li></ul>","contentLength":1193,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Neural Networks : A Beginner-Friendly Guide to the Brains Behind AI","url":"https://dev.to/abhishekjaiswal_4896/neural-networks-a-beginner-friendly-guide-to-the-brains-behind-ai-15n","date":1751369760,"author":"Abhishek Jaiswal","guid":178875,"unread":true,"content":"<h2>\n  \n  \n  Introduction: Why Neural Networks Matter\n</h2><p>Have you ever wondered how Netflix recommends your next binge-worthy series?

From handling payments and messaging to ordering food and booking rides, these all-encompassing applications strive to be indispensable tools in users' daily lives. However, the sheer volume of services and user interactions within a Super App presents both a challenge and an immense opportunity: how to prevent information overload and deliver truly relevant experiences. This is where Artificial Intelligence (AI) and hyper-personalization become not just features, but foundational pillars in successful <a href=\"https://www.sparkouttech.com/super-app-development/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Super App development</a>.</p><p>AI acts as the intelligent backbone, processing vast amounts of user data, predicting needs, and automating interactions. Personalization, powered by AI, translates these insights into tailored experiences, making each user feel like the app was designed just for them. This synergy is crucial for transforming a collection of services into a cohesive, intuitive, and highly engaging digital ecosystem. This blog post will explore the pivotal role of AI and personalization in Super App development, highlighting how they elevate user experience, drive engagement, and unlock new value for businesses.</p><p><strong>1. AI as the Engine for Data Processing and Predictive Analytics</strong></p><p>At its core, a Super App generates an enormous amount of data from diverse user interactions across various services. This includes transaction history, search queries, location data, communication patterns, Browse behavior, and more. Without a sophisticated mechanism to process and interpret this data, it remains a raw, untapped resource. This is where AI steps in as the indispensable engine.</p><p><strong>AI-powered algorithms, particularly machine learning (ML) models, can:</strong></p><p>Process Massive Datasets: Rapidly analyze vast volumes of structured and unstructured data in real-time, far exceeding human capacity.</p><p>Identify Complex Patterns: Uncover subtle correlations and trends within the data that indicate user preferences, habits, and future intentions.</p><p>Enable Predictive Analytics: Based on historical data and real-time inputs, AI can predict user needs, likely actions, and even potential pain points. For example, an AI might predict a user's need for a ride based on their calendar events and location, or suggest a restaurant based on past orders and current time.</p><p>This predictive capability is a game-changer for <a href=\"https://www.sparkouttech.com/super-app-development/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Super App development solutions</a>. Instead of users having to actively search for services, the app can proactively offer relevant options, streamlining their experience. For instance, if a user frequently orders coffee from a specific cafe in the morning, an AI agent could prompt them with an option to reorder as they approach their usual time. This seamless, almost clairvoyant interaction significantly enhances convenience and makes the Super App feel truly intelligent and helpful. The ability of AI to derive actionable insights from multi-service data is what elevates a Super App from a mere collection of mini-apps to a truly integrated and intelligent ecosystem.</p><p><strong>2. Personalization: Tailoring the Super App Experience</strong></p><p>While AI provides the analytical power, personalization is the user-facing outcome. In a Super App, personalization moves beyond simple \"recommended for you\" lists to a dynamic adaptation of the entire app experience. This level of customization ensures that despite the app's vast functionalities, it feels intuitive and relevant to each individual.</p><p><strong>Key aspects of personalization driven by AI in Super Apps include:</strong></p><p>Dynamic UI/UX Customization: The layout and visibility of mini-apps and features can change based on a user's most frequent activities, time of day, or location. For example, food delivery might be prominent during lunch hours, while payment options become central during bill payment cycles.</p><p>Contextual Recommendations: AI leverages contextual data (time, location, weather, past behavior) to offer highly relevant suggestions, whether for shopping, entertainment, or financial services.</p><p>Personalized Content and Notifications: Delivering news feeds, promotions, or notifications that are specifically tailored to a user's interests and previous interactions, reducing notification fatigue and increasing engagement.</p><p>Adaptive Search and Discovery: AI can refine search results and make it easier for users to discover new services or features within the Super App that align with their inferred needs.</p><p>This granular level of personalization ensures that the user never feels overwhelmed by the multitude of options. Instead, they experience a streamlined interface that anticipates their needs, making navigation effortless and delightful. This is a core benefit of Super App architecture combined with intelligent systems. A Super App Development Company places a strong emphasis on designing user interfaces that can fluidly adapt based on AI-driven personalization.</p><p><strong>3. AI-Powered Virtual Assistants and Chatbots</strong></p><p>The integration of AI-powered virtual assistants and advanced chatbots is another critical role of AI in Super App development. These intelligent conversational agents serve as the primary interface for many user queries and tasks, providing instant, round-the-clock support across all integrated services.</p><p>Intelligent Query Resolution: AI chatbots can understand natural language queries related to any service within the Super App, from tracking a food order to checking a bank balance or booking a ride, and provide accurate, real-time responses.</p><p>Seamless Task Execution: Beyond answering questions, these AI agents can often execute tasks directly within the chat interface, such as placing an order, initiating a payment, or scheduling a service, significantly streamlining workflows.</p><p>Proactive Assistance: Based on predictive analytics, the AI assistant can proactively offer help or suggest relevant services before the user even explicitly asks, further enhancing convenience.</p><p>Multilingual Support: AI‚Äôs natural language processing (NLP) capabilities enable Super Apps to offer seamless support in multiple languages, catering to a diverse global user base.</p><p>These AI-driven conversational interfaces reduce the burden on human customer support teams, leading to significant cost savings. More importantly, they provide an immediate, consistent, and personalized support experience that enhances user satisfaction and trust, making the Super App an even more reliable daily companion. For an On-Demand Super App Development model, such instant assistance is paramount.</p><p><strong>4. Optimized Operations and Fraud Detection through AI</strong></p><p>Beyond direct user interaction, AI plays a vital role in the back-end operations of a Super App, optimizing efficiency and ensuring security. The complexity of managing multiple services, vast user data, and numerous transactions necessitates intelligent automation and robust security measures.</p><p>Fraud Detection and Security: AI algorithms can continuously monitor transaction patterns, user behavior, and network activities to detect anomalies and identify potential fraudulent activities or security breaches in real-time. This is crucial for protecting sensitive user data, especially in Super Apps that handle financial transactions.</p><p>Resource Optimization: AI can optimize resource allocation for various services, managing server loads, delivery routes, and even human agent deployment to ensure smooth operation and cost efficiency. For example, dynamically adjusting the number of ride-hailing drivers based on real-time demand.</p><p>Content Moderation and Compliance: In Super Apps with social or content-sharing features, AI can assist in moderating user-generated content to ensure compliance with platform policies and legal regulations.</p><p>Supplier and Partner Management: AI can help analyze performance data of third-party merchants and service providers within the ecosystem, ensuring quality control and identifying areas for improvement.</p><p>This behind-the-scenes application of AI ensures the Super App operates smoothly, securely, and efficiently, building trust with users and maintaining the integrity of the multi-service ecosystem. Robust Super App development services always incorporate advanced AI for these operational efficiencies and security protocols.</p><p><strong>5. Continuous Improvement and Evolution driven by AI</strong></p><p>The dynamic nature of user needs and market trends requires a Super App to continuously evolve. AI provides the framework for this continuous improvement, enabling the app to learn and adapt over time.</p><p>Learning from User Interactions: Every user interaction provides data that AI models can use to refine their understanding of user preferences and improve the accuracy of predictions and recommendations. This creates a self-improving loop.</p><p>A/B Testing and Feature Optimization: AI can facilitate extensive A/B testing of new features, UI layouts, and messaging, allowing the development team to quickly identify what works best and optimize the app based on real user feedback.</p><p>Bug Detection and Performance Monitoring: AI-powered tools can monitor app performance in real-time, detect anomalies, identify potential bugs or bottlenecks, and even suggest solutions, ensuring a consistently smooth user experience.</p><p>Personalized Onboarding: AI can tailor the onboarding experience for new users, guiding them through the features most relevant to their inferred needs or demographics, accelerating adoption.</p><p>This continuous learning and optimization cycle, driven by AI, ensures that the Super App remains highly relevant, performant, and engaging over time. It allows the Super App development company to iterate rapidly and deliver a constantly improving product that anticipates and meets evolving user expectations.</p><p>The integration of Artificial Intelligence and personalization is not an optional add-on but a fundamental necessity for the success of any modern Super App. AI serves as the powerful engine, processing complex data, enabling predictive analytics, and automating operations. Personalization, in turn, translates these insights into highly relevant, intuitive, and adaptive user experiences, making the vastness of a Super App feel manageable and uniquely tailored to each individual.</p><p>By leveraging AI for intelligent data processing, adaptive interfaces, proactive virtual assistants, optimized operations, and continuous improvement, Super App development transcends the traditional app model to create truly indispensable digital companions. For businesses aiming to build and sustain a thriving multi-service ecosystem, investing in the intelligent integration of AI and personalization is not just a strategic advantage but the very essence of future-proof mobile dominance.

Your workers could be on fire, stuck in an endless queue, and you'd be the one to blame here. </p><p>where we're staring at logs hoping to divine the health of our distributed systems. Time to set up some proper monitoring.</p><p>Celery is one way of doing distributed task processing, but it's opaque when it comes to observability. You can see logs, but logs don't tell you if workers are healthy, how long tasks are taking, or whether your queue is backing up. That's where Flower comes in, it's the one of the monitoring tools for Celery environments.</p><p>This guide covers integrating Flower with Prometheus and Grafana to get proper metrics-driven monitoring. Whether you're using Grafana Cloud, self-hosted Grafana, the k8s-monitoring Helm chart, or individual components, we'll walk through the setup, explain why each piece matters, and tackle the gotchas.</p><ul><li>Kubernetes cluster with Celery workers already running</li><li>Some form of Prometheus-compatible metrics collection (Alloy, Prometheus Operator, plain Prometheus, etc.)</li><li>Grafana instance (cloud or self-hosted)</li><li>Basic Kubernetes knowledge</li><li>Patience for the inevitable configuration mysteries</li></ul><h2>\n  \n  \n  Understanding the Architecture\n</h2><p>Before diving into configuration, let's understand what we're building. Flower sits between your Celery workers and your monitoring system. It connects to your message broker (Redis/RabbitMQ), watches worker activity, and exposes metrics in Prometheus format.</p><p>The flow looks like this:</p><ol><li>Celery workers process tasks from the broker</li><li>Flower monitors the broker and worker activity</li><li>Flower exposes metrics at  endpoint</li><li>Your metrics collector (Prometheus/Alloy) scrapes these metrics</li><li>Grafana visualizes the data</li></ol><p>The key insight is that Flower doesn't directly monitor workers, it monitors the broker's state and worker events, which is why it can give you a complete picture of your distributed system.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  The Setup: Flower with Prometheus Metrics\n</h2><p>Here's the thing about Flower, it's great at showing you pretty graphs in its web UI, but getting it to export metrics for Prometheus requires a specific flag that's easy to miss. By default, Flower only exposes basic Python process metrics, which are useless for understanding your Celery workload.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Deploy Flower (the Right Way)\n</h3><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>That  flag is doing the heavy lifting here. Without it, you'll get basic Python process metrics (memory usage, GC stats, etc.) but none of the Celery-specific goodness like worker status, task counts, or queue depths. This flag tells Flower to export its internal monitoring data in Prometheus format.</p><p>The broker URL needs to match exactly what your Celery workers are using. Flower connects to the same broker to observe worker activity and task flow. If there's a mismatch, Flower won't see your workers.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>The named port () is crucial for ServiceMonitor configurations later. Many monitoring setups rely on port names rather than numbers for service discovery, making your configuration more resilient to port changes.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Metrics Collection: Choose Your Adventure\n</h2><p>How you get these metrics into your monitoring system depends entirely on your infrastructure setup. Kubernetes monitoring has evolved into several different patterns, each with its own tradeoffs.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Option 1: ServiceMonitor (Prometheus Operator/k8s-monitoring)\n</h3><p>ServiceMonitors are part of the Prometheus Operator ecosystem and provide declarative configuration for scrape targets. They're the cleanest approach if you're using Prometheus Operator or the k8s-monitoring Helm chart.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>The critical detail here is  vs . ServiceMonitors reference the service's port definition, not the container port directly. This indirection allows you to change container ports without updating monitoring configs.</p><p>Getting this configuration right requires the same attention to detail as any other infrastructure code.<a href=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fmedia4.giphy.com%2Fmedia%2Fv1.Y2lkPTc5MGI3NjExb3R3eXJxNGJxajZzc2RkbTF3bWUxM241MzEzMjUzNXppNWQ1MnJpNyZlcD12MV9pbnRlcm5hbF9naWZfYnlfaWQmY3Q9Zw%2FJWnXY237vWeX3zx64V%2Fgiphy.gif\"><img src=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fmedia4.giphy.com%2Fmedia%2Fv1.Y2lkPTc5MGI3NjExb3R3eXJxNGJxajZzc2RkbTF3bWUxM241MzEzMjUzNXppNWQ1MnJpNyZlcD12MV9pbnRlcm5hbF9naWZfYnlfaWQmY3Q9Zw%2FJWnXY237vWeX3zx64V%2Fgiphy.gif\" width=\"450\" height=\"450\"></a></p><p>One character difference can mean the difference between working monitoring and hours of debugging.</p><p>Here, the  restricts which namespaces this ServiceMonitor applies to. Without it, the ServiceMonitor tries to find matching services across all namespaces, which can cause confusion in multitenant clusters.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Option 2: Prometheus Annotations\n</h3><p>If you're using vanilla Prometheus with annotation based discovery, you configure scraping through service annotations. This is simpler but less flexible than ServiceMonitors.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>The annotations tell Prometheus to scrape this service. Your Prometheus configuration needs to include a job that discovers services with these annotations. This approach is more straightforward but offers less control over scraping behavior.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Option 3: Alloy Configuration (Manual)\n</h3><p>Grafana Alloy offers more flexibility than traditional Prometheus. You can configure complex discovery and relabeling rules to handle dynamic environments.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>This configuration discovers pods with the  label, applies relabeling rules to construct proper scrape targets, and forwards metrics to your storage backend. The relabeling rules transform Kubernetes metadata into the format Prometheus expects.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Option 4: Static Prometheus Config\n</h3><p>For simple setups or development environments, static configuration is the most straightforward approach.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>This hardcodes the service endpoint, which works fine for stable environments but doesn't handle dynamic scaling or service changes gracefully.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Verification: Making Sure It Actually Works\n</h2><p>Before diving into dashboard creation, verify that metrics are flowing correctly. This saves hours of troubleshooting later when you're wondering why your graphs are empty.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Check the Metrics Endpoint\n</h3><div><pre><code>kubectl port-forward svc/flower-service 5555:5555\ncurl http://localhost:5555/metrics\n</code></pre></div><p>You should see metrics that look like this:</p><div><pre><code>flower_worker_online{worker=\"celery@worker-1\"} 1.0\nflower_events_total{task=\"process_data\",type=\"task-sent\"} 127.0\nflower_worker_number_of_currently_executing_tasks{worker=\"celery@worker-1\"} 3.0\nflower_task_prefetch_time_seconds{task=\"process_data\",worker=\"celery@worker-1\"} 0.001\n</code></pre></div><p>If you're only seeing basic Python metrics (<code>python_gc_objects_collected_total</code>, <code>process_resident_memory_bytes</code>, etc.), you're missing the  flag. The Celery-specific metrics are what make this whole exercise worthwhile.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Check Your Monitoring System\n</h3><p>The verification process depends on your monitoring setup:</p><p><strong>For ServiceMonitor setups</strong>: Check the Prometheus Operator or Alloy UI for discovered targets. Look for your Flower service in the targets list with status \"UP\".</p><p>: Navigate to your Prometheus targets page () and verify the Flower job appears with healthy status.</p><p>: Check your collector's logs for any scraping errors and verify the target appears in the monitoring system's target list.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Understanding the Metrics\n</h2><p>Flower exports several categories of metrics, each providing different insights into your Celery system:</p><p>:  tells you which workers are active. <code>flower_worker_number_of_currently_executing_tasks</code> shows current load per worker.</p><p>:  tracks task lifecycle events (sent, received, started, succeeded, failed). These form the basis for throughput and success rate calculations.</p><p>: <code>flower_task_runtime_seconds</code> (histogram) shows task execution duration. <code>flower_task_prefetch_time_seconds</code> measures queue wait time.</p><p>: Various metrics help you understand queue depth and processing patterns.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Building Useful Dashboards\n</h2><p>Now for the payoff - turning those metrics into actionable insights. The key is building dashboards that help you answer specific operational questions.</p><p>: \"Are my workers running? How many are active?\"</p><div><pre><code># Total online workers\nsum(flower_worker_online)\n\n# Per-worker status\nflower_worker_online\n</code></pre></div><p>: \"How many tasks are we processing? Is throughput increasing?\"</p><div><pre><code># Tasks being sent to workers (per second)\nrate(flower_events_total{type=\"task-sent\"}[5m])\n\n# Tasks being processed (per second)\nrate(flower_events_total{type=\"task-received\"}[5m])\n</code></pre></div><p>: \"Is my queue backing up? How long do tasks wait?\"</p><div><pre><code># Tasks currently executing\nsum(flower_worker_number_of_currently_executing_tasks)\n\n# Time tasks spend waiting in queue\nflower_task_prefetch_time_seconds\n</code></pre></div><p>: \"How long do tasks take? Are they getting slower?\"</p><div><pre><code># 95th percentile task duration\nhistogram_quantile(0.95, rate(flower_task_runtime_seconds_bucket[5m]))\n\n# Median task duration\nhistogram_quantile(0.50, rate(flower_task_runtime_seconds_bucket[5m]))\n</code></pre></div><h3>\n  \n  \n  Dashboard Design Philosophy specifically for celery\n</h3><p>Start with high-level health indicators, then provide drill-down capabilities. A good Celery dashboard answers these questions in order:</p><ol><li>: Are workers running? Is the system processing tasks?</li><li>: How much work are we doing? Is it increasing or decreasing?</li><li>: How fast are tasks completing? Are there performance regressions?</li><li>: Are tasks backing up? Where are the bottlenecks?</li></ol><p>Real Celery deployments often have specialized workers for different task types. CPU-intensive tasks, I/O-bound tasks, and priority queues all need separate monitoring.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Each Flower instance monitors a specific Celery app, giving you granular visibility into different workload types. You'll need separate services and scrape configurations for each instance.</p><p>This approach lets you set different SLAs and alerting thresholds for different workload types. Your real-time fraud detection tasks might need sub-second response times, while your batch report generation can tolerate longer delays.</p><p>Flower itself is lightweight, but its resource needs scale with worker count and task frequency. A busy system with hundreds of workers and thousands of tasks per minute will use more memory to track state.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>For self-hosted setups, configure Grafana to read from your Prometheus instance:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>This assumes Prometheus and Grafana are in the same cluster. For cross-cluster or external access, you'll need appropriate networking and authentication configuration.</p><p>Production Flower deployments need proper security controls. Flower's web interface shows detailed information about your task processing, which could be sensitive.</p><p>Enable basic authentication at minimum:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>For production systems, consider OAuth integration or running Flower behind an authentication proxy. Celery-exporter provides similar metrics without the web interface overhead. It's purpose-built for Prometheus integration and might use fewer resources than Flower. However, you lose Flower's web interface for ad-hoc investigation.</p><p>Getting Celery monitoring right requires attention to several key details:</p><ul><li>The  flag transforms Flower from a simple web interface into a proper metrics exporter</li><li>Your metrics collection method should match your infrastructure setup and operational preferences</li><li>ServiceMonitor port configuration matters -  references service ports,  references container ports</li><li>Label matching between ServiceMonitors, services, and pods must be exact</li><li>Your monitoring system's target discovery UI is invaluable for debugging configuration issues</li></ul><p>The setup might seem complicated, but each piece serves a specific purpose in building a robust monitoring system. Once you have this foundation, you can extend it with alerting rules, additional dashboards, and integration with your incident response workflow.</p>","contentLength":11208,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"üò± Spent 3 days chasing a ghost bug?","url":"https://dev.to/aleksei_aleinikov/spent-3-days-chasing-a-ghost-bug-3imi","date":1751354992,"author":"Aleksei Aleinikov","guid":178737,"unread":true,"content":"<p>üî• Next time: fix it in 3 minutes.</p><p>A tiny Python feature (since 3.8) turns prints into instant micro-logs ‚Äî no setup, no overhead, pure clarity.</p>","contentLength":147,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"üêçüí• Think bytearray is just a Python toy?

With multiple tech groups on different platforms, such as meetup and eventbright, there are often events of interest happening that many tech enthusiasts are not aware of. The intent is to have a single resource that includes local tech groups and the events they host.</p><p>Many developers in our community, especially those earlier in their career, have skills and drive, but haven't had the opportunity to work on a project in a real professional environment. For example, a developer could have great knowledge in coding, but hasn't yet had the first professional job or participated in project with milestones, project planning, code reviews, etc. The Spokane Tech project aims to provide this and give contributes a project they can reference for career development, personal portfolios, interviews, etc. </p><p>What our project (and webapp) becomes will ultimately be dictated by members of the project and will likely evolve over time. Below are some details of the initial vision.</p><p>Have a web site that houses groups and events. Events may be manually or automatically added to our site. We will have views that list all the groups and events, as well as detail pages for each group and event. Ideally we'll also have a calendar view that can list all events and perhaps be filterable.</p><p>Have event requests and suggestions capabilities. Here members can post a suggested events they want to give or have someone else give, and others can up/down vote the event (think reddit or stackoverflow). This can be used to prioritize events base on community interest. This can also serve as a living backlog of event ideas. Add labels to events, such as technical areas (frontend, scripting, ML, etc.) and topic levels (beginner/intermediate/etc.). With labels people can filter event based on interest and other criteria.</p><p>Build member profiles. With profiles, we can have some basic metrics on things like career level, geographic location, interested and expertise. This data can help provide viability into the overall tech presence in Spokane and help drive event topics and location. This could also be a future resource to make available to local businesses and the community for things like contract work, etc. (There has been some outside interest in this type of resource)</p><p>The Spokane Tech project was started mostly by members of the Spokane Python User Group (SPUG), so naturally the first version of the website is based on python.

We showed how the 'assessing' happens in a decision node that plans the next move. Now, it's time to forge the weapons used for the .</p><p>That 'Strike' is powered by the agent's ‚Äîthe official set of weapons, tools, and spells it can draw upon. In technical terms, this is its . This isn't just a list of functions; it is the very soul of your agent's power. A well-forged arsenal, where every blade is sharp and serves a unique purpose, is the difference between an agent that is defeated by the first obstacle and one that conquers any challenge.</p><p>In this guide, you are the master blacksmith. Using the transparent and powerful <a href=\"https://github.com/The-Pocket/PocketFlow\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"></a> framework as your forge, we will teach you how to craft an arsenal of actions that will turn your agent from a clumsy squire into a legendary warrior.</p><h2><strong>The Battle Tactician: How an Agent Chooses Its Weapon</strong></h2><p>So, we have an arsenal. But how does the agent, our digital warrior, know when to draw a longsword for a close-quarters fight versus firing a bow from a distance?</p><p>This critical decision happens in the ‚Äîthe agent's battle tactician. At its core, every agent is just a simple loop that consults its tactician, who then chooses an action from the arsenal. The chosen action is performed, and the results are reported back to the tactician to plan the next move.</p><p>Visually, the battle plan looks like this:</p><ol><li><strong> (The Tactician):</strong> This is the brain. It analyzes the battlefield (the user's request and current data).</li><li><strong>The Arrows (The Commands):</strong> Based on its analysis, the tactician issues a command: , , or . This is the branch in the graph.</li><li><strong>The Action Nodes (The Specialists):</strong> Each command goes to a specialist soldier who executes that one task.</li><li><strong>The Loop Back (The Report):</strong> After the specialist completes their task, they report back to the tactician with new information, and the cycle begins again.</li></ol><p>\"But what magic happens inside that  node?\" you ask. \"How does it  think?\"</p><p>This is the most misunderstood part of agent design, and the secret is shockingly simple.  There's no complex algorithm, just a carefully written set of instructions for the LLM.</p><p>The tactician's \"brain\" is a prompt that looks something like this:</p><div><pre><code>### CONTEXT\nYou are a research assistant. Here is the current situation:\nQuestion: {the user's original question}\nPrevious Actions: {a log of what has been done so far}\nCurrent Information: {any data gathered from previous actions}\n\n### ARSENAL (Available Actions)\nHere are the weapons you can use. Choose one.\n\n[1] search_web\n  Description: Search the internet for up-to-date information.\n  Parameters:\n    - query (str): The specific topic to search for.\n\n[2] write_file\n  Description: Save text into a local file.\n  Parameters:\n    - filename (str): The name of the file to create.\n    - content (str): The text content to write into the file.\n\n[3] answer_question\n  Description: Provide the final answer to the user.\n  Parameters:\n    - answer (str): The complete, final answer.\n\n## YOUR NEXT COMMAND\nReview the CONTEXT and choose the single best ACTION from your ARSENAL to proceed.\nFormat your response as a YAML block.\n</code></pre></div><p>That's it! The agent's entire decision-making process boils down to this: the LLM reads the description of the situation and the \"user manual\" for every weapon in its arsenal, and then it picks the one that makes the most sense.</p><p>The quality of its choice is <strong>100% dependent on how clearly you describe its weapons.</strong> A sharp, well-defined arsenal in your prompt leads to a smart, effective agent. A vague, confusing one leads to a warrior who brings a knife to a dragon fight.</p><p>Now, let's learn how to forge these weapons, from simple daggers to god-tier magic spells.</p><h2><strong>Level Up Your Arsenal: The Three Tiers of Weapon Complexity</strong></h2><p>As a master blacksmith, you wouldn't forge just one type of weapon. You need a full range, from simple daggers for quick jabs to powerful, enchanted swords for epic battles. The same is true for your agent's arsenal. Actions can be designed with varying levels of power and complexity. Let's explore the three tiers.</p><h3><strong>Level 1: The Simple Dagger (The \"Button\" Action)</strong></h3><p>A simple dagger is a no-frills weapon. You draw it, you use it. It does one thing, and it does it reliably. These are actions that require .</p><p>Think of them as on/off switches or simple commands.</p><p>\nAn action like  or .</p><p><strong>In the Arsenal (Prompt Description):</strong></p><div><pre><code>[1] request_human_help\n  Description: If you are stuck or need clarification, use this action to pause and ask the human user for guidance.\n</code></pre></div><p>\nFor clear, binary decisions. When the agent needs to signal a state change, like \"I'm finished,\" \"I'm stuck,\" or \"I've failed.\" They are perfect for controlling the overall flow of the battle plan.</p><h3><strong>Level 2: The Sharpshooter's Bow (The Parameterized Tool)</strong></h3><p>A bow is useless without an arrow and a target. This weapon requires input to be effective. These are the most common and versatile actions in an agent's arsenal‚Äîactions that require  to function.</p><p>To use these weapons, the agent must not only choose the bow but also aim it by providing the correct inputs.</p><p>\nAn action like  or <code>send_email(to, subject, body)</code>.</p><p><strong>In the Arsenal (Prompt Description):</strong></p><div><pre><code>[2] search_web\n  Description: Searches the public internet for a given text string.\n  Parameters:\n    - query (str): The precise search term to look up. Must be a focused string.\n\n[3] send_email\n  Description: Composes and sends an email to a recipient.\n  Parameters:\n    - to (str): The email address of the recipient.\n    - subject (str): The subject line of the email.\n    - body (str): The main content of the email.\n</code></pre></div><p><strong>The Crucial Link to Your Blacksmithing Skills:</strong>\nHow does the agent provide these parameters? This is where your skill in  becomes critical. As we covered in our guide, <a href=\"https://pocketflow.substack.com/p/structured-output-for-beginners-3\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Structured Output for Beginners</a>, you must instruct the LLM to format its response in a structured way (like YAML or JSON) so your program can easily parse the action  its parameters.</p><p>Without this skill, you've given your agent a powerful bow but no way to nock an arrow.</p><h3><strong>Level 3: The Spellbook of Creation (The Programmable Action)</strong></h3><p>This is the ultimate weapon: a spellbook that doesn't contain a list of spells but teaches the agent how to . These are  where the agent generates code or complex instructions on the fly.</p><p>This gives the agent god-like flexibility to solve novel problems you never explicitly trained it for.</p><p>\nAn action like  or .</p><p><strong>In the Arsenal (Prompt Description):</strong></p><div><pre><code>[4] execute_sql\n  Description: Write and run a SQL query against the company's sales database. The database contains tables named 'customers', 'orders', and 'products'.\n  Parameters:\n    - sql_query (str): A valid SQL query string to execute.\n\n[5] run_python_code\n  Description: Write and execute a sandboxed Python script for complex calculations, data manipulation, or interacting with APIs.\n  Parameters:\n    - code (str): A string containing the Python code to run.\n</code></pre></div><p>\nA spellbook is the most powerful weapon in your arsenal, but it's also the most dangerous.</p><ul><li> Your agent can solve almost any problem that can be expressed in code. It's no longer limited to pre-defined tools.</li><li> It's much more likely to make a mistake (e.g., writing buggy code). More importantly, it opens up massive security risks if not handled carefully (e.g., executing malicious code like <code>os.remove(\"important_file.txt\")</code>). Always run such code in a secure, sandboxed environment.</li></ul><p>Mastering these three tiers allows you to build a balanced and effective arsenal, equipping your agent for any challenge it might face.</p><h2><strong>Forging the Perfect Arsenal: 3 Golden Rules for Your Weapon Inventory</strong></h2><p>A legendary warrior doesn't just carry a random assortment of weapons. Their arsenal is carefully curated‚Äîeach item is perfectly crafted, serves a distinct purpose, and is instantly accessible. As the master blacksmith for your agent, you must apply the same discipline. Here are the three golden rules for forging a world-class action space.</p><h3><strong>Golden Rule #1: Engrave a Crystal-Clear User Manual (Clarity is King)</strong></h3><p>The descriptions for your actions and their parameters are not notes for yourself; they are the . If the manual is vague, the LLM will misuse the tool. Be painfully, relentlessly explicit.</p><p><strong>A Dull Blade (Bad Description):</strong></p><div><pre><code>search: searches for stuff\n</code></pre></div><p>The agent sees this and thinks, \"What stuff? How? What do I provide?\" The result is a wild guess, like <code>search(query=\"who won the 2024 Nobel Prize in Physics and what were their contributions in detail and also list prior winners\")</code>, a query too broad to be effective.</p><p><strong>A Sharpened Katana (Good Description):</strong></p><div><pre><code>search_web(query: str):\n  Description: Searches the public internet for up-to-date information on a single, specific topic. Returns the top 5 text snippets.\n  Parameters:\n    - query (str): A simple and focused search query, typically 3-5 words long.\n</code></pre></div><p>Now the agent understands its constraints. It knows the tool is for  and the query should be . It will correctly generate a command like <code>search_web(query: \"2024 Nobel Prize Physics winner\")</code>, leading to a much better outcome.</p><h3><strong>Golden Rule #2: Don't Burden Your Warrior with a Junk Drawer (Keep it Concise)</strong></h3><p>A warrior grabbing a weapon in the heat of battle can't afford to sift through a hundred options. They need a small, elite set of choices. Overwhelming the LLM with too many actions leads to confusion, slower decision-making (more tokens to process), and a higher chance of picking the wrong tool.</p><blockquote><p><strong>The Blacksmith's Guideline:</strong> An arsenal of <strong>10 weapons is formidable. An arsenal of 100 is a junk drawer.</strong></p></blockquote><p>If your action space is growing too large, it's a sign that your tools are too granular. Instead of creating , , and , forge a single, more powerful weapon: . Your code can handle the internal logic of parsing different file types. Keep the agent's choices clean and high-level.</p><h3><strong>Golden Rule #3: Make Every Weapon Unique (Slay Redundancy)</strong></h3><p>Every weapon in the arsenal should have a unique purpose. If the agent has two tools that do similar things, it will get confused about which one to use. This is called a lack of \"orthogonality.\"</p><p><strong>The Confusing Arsenal (Bad Design):</strong></p><ul><li><code>read_csv_from_disk(file_path: str)</code>: Reads customer data from a local CSV file.</li><li>: Queries the live customer database.</li></ul><p>The agent is asked to \"find the total sales for new customers from this quarter.\" Which tool should it use? The data might be in the CSV, or it might be in the database. The agent doesn't know and might make the wrong choice.</p><p><strong>The Pro-Gamer Move: Simplify the Battlefield</strong>\nA true master blacksmith doesn't just forge weapons; they shape the battlefield to their advantage. Instead of giving the agent two ambiguous tools, do the work for it behind the scenes.</p><p><strong>The Decisive Arsenal (Good Design):</strong>\nBefore the agent even starts, run a script that <strong>loads the CSV data into a temporary table in the database.</strong></p><p>Now, the agent's arsenal is clean and unambiguous:</p><ul><li>: Queries the customer database, which contains all known customer data.</li></ul><p>The ambiguity is gone. The agent has one, and only one, tool for retrieving customer data. You've eliminated redundancy and made the agent's decision trivial, guaranteeing it makes the right choice every time.</p><h2><strong>Conclusion: An Agent is Only as Sharp as its Arsenal</strong></h2><p>And so, the secrets of the forge are yours. You now understand that the true power of an LLM agent doesn't come from some mysterious, hidden algorithm. It comes from the thoughtful, disciplined, and creative process of crafting its .</p><p>You've learned that agents are just warriors in a , making decisions based on a prompt that serves as their battle plan. And you've seen how to stock their arsenal for any challenge:</p><ul><li>  With  for quick, decisive commands.</li><li>  With  for precise, targeted actions.</li><li>  With reality-bending  for ultimate flexibility.</li></ul><p>Most importantly, you now hold the three golden rules of the master blacksmith:</p><ol><li> Your descriptions are the agent's guide to victory.</li><li> A curated, concise arsenal is deadlier than a cluttered one.</li><li> Make every weapon unique to ensure the agent never hesitates.</li></ol><p>The next time you see a complex agent framework with thousands of lines of code, you won't be intimidated. You'll know to look past the noise and ask the fundamental questions: \"What's in the arsenal? How is it described? Is it sharp, concise, and unique?\"</p><p>Armed with this knowledge, you are no longer just a coder; you are an . You have the power to forge not just tools, but intelligent, reliable, and effective digital warriors.</p><p><em>Ready to light the forge?

Because it's literally everywhere.</p><p>Python is used in web development, data science, machine learning, automation, and even artificial intelligence. But what is most appealing ‚Äî especially for new developers ‚Äî is how readable it is. The syntax is simple, the learning curve isn't so rough, and some people even joke that it feels like writing in plain English.</p><p>I started learning JavaScript about ten months ago. Once I honed my fundamentals in JavaScript, I wanted to learn a language that would open more doors and expand my horizon in tech beyond web development. Python kept coming up in conversations ‚Äî not just because it's powerful, but because people actually enjoy using it.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Indentation and Variables\n</h3><p>Right off the bat, two things will blow your mind about Python ‚Äî especially if you're coming from JavaScript.</p><p>First, Python uses indentation (whitespace) to define code blocks, rather than curly braces  like in JavaScript and many other languages. That means spacing of your code is very important.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Compare that to JavaScript:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>In Python, there's no need for  ‚Äî the indentation is the structure.</p><p>Another surprising quirk is how variables are declared. Python doesn't require keywords like , , or . You just write the variable name and assign a value.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>There's no need to specify types or use extra keywords ‚Äî Python figures it out for you.</p><p>Lists in Python are similar to arrays in JavaScript ‚Äî they can hold multiple values, are ordered, and are mutable (you can change them).</p><p>They have a very similar syntax, except that:</p><ul><li>Python typically uses  to declare variables and JavaScript uses .\n</li></ul><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Python also introduces another built-in data structure called . At first glance, tuples look a lot like lists ‚Äî they can store an ordered collection of elements ‚Äî but they come with a few key differences:</p><ul><li>Tuples are  ‚Äî meaning once created, their values cannot be changed.</li><li><strong>More memory-efficient and faster</strong> than lists, especially for large, fixed data sets.\n</li></ul><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Without the comma, Python will treat it as a plain string or number.</p><p>Python has a useful set of built-in methods you can use on lists and tuples. List methods such as , , , , , etc., allow efficient ways to manipulate and interact with data.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Tuples can also be used in real-world scenarios like coordinates or color values - places where you need fixed, unchanging data:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Read more about <a href=\"https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_ref_list.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">here</a>.</p><p>Tuples have fewer methods: mainly  and .</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><h3>\n  \n  \n  Conditional Statements and Logical Operators\n</h3><p>Python uses  to handle conditional logic.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Logical operators in Python:</p><ul><li> means both conditions must be true.</li><li> means at least one must be true.</li><li> inverts the truth value.\n</li></ul><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><h3>\n  \n  \n  For Loop and List Comprehension\n</h3><p>Python's  loops are super clean:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>List comprehensions let you build lists in a single line:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Try it yourself: Write a list comprehension that returns all even numbers from 0 to 20.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Functions and Lambda Functions\n</h3><p>Python functions use the  keyword:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Lambda functions are one-liner anonymous functions:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>You‚Äôll often see lambdas used in sorting, mapping, or filtering lists.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>While Python has a lot going for it ‚Äî especially its simplicity and readability ‚Äî it's not without tradeoffs.</p><ul><li>Python tends to run slower than JavaScript in browser-based environments.</li><li>It's not the best fit for mobile app development.</li><li>And because it's dynamically typed, it can lead to unexpected bugs if you're not careful with types.</li></ul><p>But in many cases, these drawbacks are outweighed by Python's ease of use, massive ecosystem, and wide range of applications ‚Äî especially in data science and automation.</p><p>As with any language, it's about choosing the right tool for the job.</p><p>This blog isn‚Äôt meant to cover  about Python ‚Äî instead, it‚Äôs a reflection of what stood out to me as a JavaScript developer learning Python for the first time.

You can either use the  decorator, as I‚Äôve been using, which is the simplest and fastest way to create LLM methods. There‚Äôs also , which allows you to pass a list of chat messages to the LLM. This is especially useful for few-shot prompting, where you give the LLM some examples of what output you want. After all, LLMs  just fancy pattern matching black boxes.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>You can also pass <a href=\"https://magentic.dev/#functioncall\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">function calls to LLMs</a> to allow them to return a python callable that you can call later. Another use of this is the decorator  which allows you to have an LLM call a function and use the returned results to generate its response.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>If you‚Äôre a data conscious person, or just want your options to be open, Magentic can be configured to work with nearly all other LLMs as long as they are supported by <a href=\"https://github.com/BerriAI/litellm\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">LiteLLM</a> or offer an OpenAI compatible API. Here‚Äôs an example of a script that runs entirely locally using <a href=\"https://ollama.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Ollama</a> and <a href=\"https://ollama.com/library/gemma3\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Google‚Äôs Gemma 3</a>.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>You can use the LiteLLM method to use Anthropic‚Äôs Claude series of models, or you can use Magentic‚Äôs official Anthropic extension.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Need an async function? Just prefix with  instead of  !</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>You can use Python‚Äôs  to make multiple simultaneous calls to the LLM.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Need to stream the response back to the user? Use Magentic‚Äôs  to loop through the response chunks.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>This also works for multiple objects, simply wrap your objects in the  class.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Working with LLMs is now easier than ever, and Magnetic makes it even easier than the standard methods to quick add LLMs to any Python script, regardless of the scale of complexity. Using this in tandem with something like uv and the new scripting metadata allows you to quickly make command line tools that can utilize AI quickly and effectively. I won‚Äôt always use Magentic for every project I need an LLM for, but I‚Äôll definitely use it all the time with my small one-offs and utilities.</p>","contentLength":4433,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"How to Set Up a Django Project Structure Using VS Code","url":"https://dev.to/annnab2222/how-to-set-up-a-django-project-structure-using-vs-code-3189","date":1751309721,"author":"Hannah","guid":176859,"unread":true,"content":"<p>If you're just getting started with Django and want to build your project using Visual Studio Code (VS Code), you're in the right place.

I focused on creating and structuring my Django project while learning a lot about apps, templates, and URL configurations. Here‚Äôs a friendly walkthrough of how I accomplished it using Git Bash as my terminal.</p><h4><strong>1. Starting the Django Project</strong> üöÄ\n</h4><p>The first step was to create a new Django project named . This project would serve as the foundation for everything else. Using Git Bash, I navigated to my desired directory and set up a virtual environment:</p><div><pre><code>dijango\ndijango\npython  venv venv\nvenv/bin/activate  \nvenvcriptsctivate   </code></pre></div><p>Next, I installed Django and created the project:</p><div><pre><code>pip django\ndjango-admin startproject dijango </code></pre></div><p>Here‚Äôs what the structure looked like at this point:</p><ul><li>: The project‚Äôs control center.</li><li>: A directory containing core files like , , and others.</li></ul><h4> üõ†Ô∏è\n</h4><p>Django encourages splitting functionality into smaller units called apps. I created two apps,  and , to separate different functionalities:</p><div><pre><code>python manage.py startapp REE1\npython manage.py startapp REE2\n</code></pre></div><p>Each app came with its own files, like  and . To make Django recognize these apps, I added them to the  section in :</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Templates define how the front-end of the app looks. Using Git Bash, I created a  directory in the root folder and added subfolders for each app:</p><div><pre><code>templates\ntemplates/REE1\ntemplates/REE2\n</code></pre></div><p>In , I updated the  configuration to include the new directory:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>URL configurations connect specific views to URLs. Since Django doesn‚Äôt create  files for apps by default, I manually added them for  and .</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>I then updated the main project‚Äôs  to include these app-specific routes:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><h4><strong>5. Adding Views and Templates</strong> üñºÔ∏è\n</h4><p>In Django, views determine what gets displayed for each URL. I created simple views for both apps:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Next, I added basic HTML templates:</p><p><code>templates/REE1/index.html</code>:</p><div><pre><code>REE1 IndexWelcome to REE1!</code></pre></div><p>:</p><div><pre><code>REE2 HomeWelcome to REE2!</code></pre></div><p>Using Git Bash throughout this process made it easy to execute commands and navigate between directories. As I continue exploring Django, I look forward to building more complex projects and honing my skills.

It defines how URLs are routed to views ‚Äî basically deciding what happens when someone visits a specific page. - Entry point for ASGI (Asynchronous Server Gateway Interface), which allows your Django app to support asynchronous features like WebSockets and background tasks. -     Entry point for WSGI (Web Server Gateway Interface), which helps traditional web servers like Gunicorn or uWSGI serve your Django project.

I've spent years wrestling with latency spikes and resource constraints across edge devices, cloud instances, and embedded systems. These eight Python techniques consistently deliver performance gains while preserving accuracy.  </p><p>Model quantization reduces numerical precision to shrink memory footprint. Converting 32-bit floats to 16-bit or 8-bit integers accelerates calculations with minimal accuracy loss. In one deployment, this cut inference time by 60% on mobile processors. Here's practical TensorFlow implementation:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Pruning eliminates redundant neural connections. I approach this as iterative sculpting - gradually removing low-weight connections during training. Sparsity patterns emerge naturally, like finding efficient pathways through dense forests:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Batching strategies maximize hardware utilization. Grouping requests leverages parallel processing capabilities. I implement dynamic batching that adapts to fluctuating loads:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>ONNX Runtime provides hardware-agnostic acceleration. Switching execution providers lets me optimize for specific environments. This snippet shows how I configure sessions for different hardware:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Apache TVM compiles models to hardware-native code. Ahead-of-time compilation generates optimized executables. I use this for deploying to edge devices with limited resources:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Asynchronous pipelines separate I/O from computation. This design pattern overlaps preprocessing with model execution. My implementation handles concurrent requests efficiently:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Knowledge distillation transfers capabilities to smaller models. I train compact student models using guidance from larger teacher models. This technique maintains accuracy while reducing computational demands:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Monitoring production systems detects performance degradation. Statistical tests identify data drift and model decay. I implement continuous validation with this approach:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>These techniques form a comprehensive toolkit for inference optimization. Each addresses specific constraints I've encountered in real-world deployments. Quantization excels on mobile processors, while TVM shines in cross-compilation scenarios. Asynchronous patterns prove invaluable in high-throughput APIs, and distillation creates efficient specialized models. Performance monitoring completes the lifecycle, ensuring sustained accuracy.  </p><p>The most effective solutions combine multiple approaches. I typically start with quantization and pruning during model export, then layer hardware-specific optimizations like TVM compilation. For server deployments, I implement batching and asynchronous pipelines. Edge deployments benefit most from quantization and TVM. Continuous monitoring provides safety nets for all scenarios.  </p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Through careful implementation, I've achieved latency reductions up to 85% compared to baseline implementations. Resource consumption often drops to one-third of original requirements. These gains enable applications previously considered impractical - real-time video analysis on IoT devices, high-frequency trading predictions, and responsive medical diagnostics.

As a developer who loves a good retro arcade game and is curious about AI-driven development, this was the perfect excuse to dive in. The mission was simple: build a game using Amazon Q's command-line interface, document the journey, and share the results.</p><p>The result? A fully-functional, nostalgic side-scrolling shooter called , and a ton of insights into pairing AI with a classic coding project. Here‚Äôs how it went down.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  My Game: \"Space Conquer\" - A Modern-Classic Shooter\n</h2><p>For my project, I chose to build , a side-scrolling space shooter inspired by the classic  from old Nokia phones.</p><ol><li> Like many, I have fond memories of playing . I wanted to capture that simple, addictive fun but with a modern coat of paint‚Äîbetter graphics, dynamic sound, and smoother controls.</li><li> A 2D shooter involves a fantastic mix of programming challenges that are perfect for an AI assistant: managing game states, handling real-time user input, collision detection, and creating varied enemy behaviors.</li><li> I didn't just want to build a game; I wanted to build a . My vision was a modular design where new enemies, power-ups, or levels could be added easily. This is where an AI's ability to generate structured, boilerplate code would really shine.</li></ol><p>Space Conquer features diverse enemies, collectible power-ups, dynamic audio that changes with the game state, and even a hidden developer panel for testing.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Unlocking AI's Potential: Effective Prompting Techniques\n</h2><p>Working with Amazon Q CLI is a conversation. The better your questions, the better the answers. I quickly learned that vague prompts like \"make a game\" were less effective than breaking down the problem into specific, well-defined tasks.</p><p>Here are a few prompting techniques I discovered.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Technique 1: Requesting a Modular Architecture\n</h3><p>Instead of asking for a single, monolithic script, I prompted for a clean, organized structure from the start.</p><blockquote><p> \"Create a project structure for a PyGame-based space shooter. I need separate modules for asset management, sprites (player, enemies, bullets), UI components, and the main game loop. The asset manager should load images and sounds from manifest files.\"</p></blockquote><p> Amazon Q generated a directory structure (, , ) and starter Python files for each module (, , , ). The generated  included a function to read a JSON manifest, which was a huge head start.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Technique 2: Defining Behavior with Roles and Rules\n</h3><p>When creating enemies, I defined their characteristics and constraints clearly.</p><blockquote><p> \"Generate a Python class  that inherits from . It needs attributes for health, speed, and score value. Then, create a subclass  that moves in a sine wave pattern down the screen and fires a bullet every 2 seconds.\"</p></blockquote><p> Q provided a base  class and a well-defined  subclass with its  method already implementing the sine wave movement using . This saved me from figuring out the trigonometry and timing loops myself.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  How AI Handled Classic Programming Challenges\n</h2><p>Game development is full of recurring problems. Here's how Amazon Q helped tackle some of the classics:</p><ul><li><p> A game needs distinct states like 'main_menu', 'gameplay', 'settings', and 'game_over'. I prompted the AI to implement a simple state machine. It generated a  class that held the current state and handled transitions, ensuring that the main menu logic didn't run during gameplay and vice-versa.</p></li><li><p> A core mechanic of any shooter. I asked Q for an efficient way to check for collisions between player bullets and enemies, and between the player and enemy ships or bullets. It suggested using PyGame's built-in <code>pygame.sprite.groupcollide()</code> function, providing a concise and performant solution that I could drop right into my main game loop.</p></li><li><p> I wanted power-ups to drop randomly from destroyed asteroids. I prompted: \"When an asteroid is destroyed, there should be a 15% chance of it dropping a power-up. The power-up type (health, speed, rapid-fire) should be chosen randomly.\" The AI generated a clean <code>if random.random() &lt; 0.15:</code> check and a  call to select from a list of power-up types.</p></li></ul><h2>\n  \n  \n  Time-Saving Automation: More Than Just Code\n</h2><p>One of the biggest wins was using AI for automation  the code. The project summary mentions developer tools, and Q was instrumental here.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  The Asset Manifest Generator\n</h3><p>My game uses JSON files to manage all assets (images, sounds, maps). Manually keeping these in sync is tedious.</p><blockquote><p> \"Write a Python script for the  directory that scans the  and  directories and automatically generates a  file with all the file paths.\"</p></blockquote><p>This single prompt created a utility script that saved me countless minutes of error-prone manual editing every time I added a new enemy sprite or sound effect.</p><h4>\n  \n  \n  The Cross-Platform Launcher\n</h4><p>I wanted a simple way for anyone to run the game, regardless of their OS.</p><blockquote><p> \"Create a Python script named  that checks the user's operating system. It should ensure all dependencies from  are installed using pip and then launch the  script.\"</p></blockquote><p>Q generated a script using the  and  modules that provided a one-click experience‚Äîa small but professional touch that I might have skipped otherwise.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  AI-Generated Code That Impressed Me\n</h2><p>It's one thing to generate boilerplate, but another to produce elegant solutions. Here are a couple of snippets that stood out.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  1. Manifest-Driven Asset Loader\n</h3><p>This function, generated early on, set the foundation for the game's modularity. It loads all assets listed in a JSON file into a dictionary, making them easily accessible throughout the game.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>This design is clean, error-handled, and makes adding 50 new assets as easy as adding one.</p><ol><li>A Base Class for Animated UI Panels\nI wanted the UI to have a modern, \"glowing\" feel. I asked Q to create a reusable class for this.\n</li></ol><div><pre><code># Part of src/ui.py\nimport pygame\n\nclass GlowingPanel(pygame.sprite.Sprite):\n    \"\"\"\n    A UI panel that has a subtle pulsing glow effect by alpha blending.\n    \"\"\"\n    def __init__(self, rect, color, glow_color):\n        super().__init__()\n        self.rect = rect\n        self.color = color\n        self.glow_color = glow_color\n        self.image = pygame.Surface(self.rect.size, pygame.SRCALPHA)\n\n        self.glow_alpha = 100\n        self.glow_direction = 2 # Rate of change for alpha\n\n    def update(self):\n        \"\"\"Update the pulsing glow effect.\"\"\"\n        self.glow_alpha += self.glow_direction\n        if self.glow_alpha &gt;= 180 or self.glow_alpha &lt;= 80:\n            self.glow_direction *= -1\n\n        self.image.fill((0, 0, 0, 0)) # Clear with transparency\n\n        # Draw base panel\n        pygame.draw.rect(self.image, self.color, (0, 0, self.rect.width, self.rect.height), border_radius=8)\n\n        # Draw glow effect (a slightly larger rect with changing alpha)\n        glow_surface = pygame.Surface(self.rect.size, pygame.SRCALPHA)\n        glow_rect = pygame.Rect(0, 0, self.rect.width, self.rect.height)\n        glow_color_with_alpha = (*self.glow_color, self.glow_alpha)\n        pygame.draw.rect(glow_surface, glow_color_with_alpha, glow_rect, border_radius=10)\n\n        # Blit the glow onto the main surface\n        self.image.blit(glow_surface, (0,0), special_flags=pygame.BLEND_RGBA_ADD)\n</code></pre></div><p>This self-contained class for a UI element with its own animation logic is a great example of the object-oriented code Q can produce. It's reusable for scoreboards, health bars, or any other panel in the game.</p><p>Final Thoughts\nUsing Amazon Q CLI for the \"Build Games\" challenge was a fantastic experience. It didn't just write code for me; it acted as a partner that handled the tedious, boilerplate, and sometimes complex parts of development, freeing me up to focus on the creative vision for \"Space Conquer.\"</p><p>If you're a developer who hasn't tried integrating an AI assistant into your workflow, I highly recommend it.

Am quite excited to share what I did today while learning Django structure.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  step 1; setting up my project.\n</h2><p>As part of my tech journey, I decided to build a Django project to practice web development. I named my project njeriproject. Here‚Äôs how I got started:</p><div><pre><code>\ndjango-admin startproject njeriproject\ncd njeriproject\npython -m venv rbenv\nrbenv\\Scripts\\activate\npip install django\n</code></pre></div><p>in this i created a virtual environment by the name brenv and installed django.\nThen I created two apps inside it:</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Step 2: Understanding the Django Structure\n</h2><p>After running the command, my project looked like this:</p><div><pre><code>njeri/\n‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ manage.py\n‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ mysite/\n‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ __init__.py\n‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ settings.py\n‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ urls.py\n‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ asgi.py\n‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ wsgi.py\n\n</code></pre></div><p>I explored and learned what each file does:</p><p>- This lets me run commands like runserver or makemigrations- This Contains all project settings like installed apps and database config- Handles all routing and linking to app URLs- Help when deploying to a web server</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Step 3: Creating Two Django Apps\n</h2><p>To organize my site into separate features, I created two apps where each app came with important files like;\nviews.py, models.py, admin.py, apps.py, tests.py, and a migrations/ folder</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Step 4: Registering the Apps\n</h2><p>To make Django recognize both apps, I opened mysite/settings.py and added them in INSTALLED_APPS </p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Step 5: Writing Views and Creating URLs\n</h2><p>\nIn app1/views.py i created this code</p><div><pre><code>from django.shortcuts import render\n\ndef app1_home(request):\n    return render(request, 'app1_home.html')\n\n</code></pre></div><p>then created urls.py for app1 added the following in it</p><div><pre><code>from django.urls import path\nfrom .views import app1_home\n\nurlpatterns = [\n    path('', app1_home, name='app1_home'),\n]\n</code></pre></div><p>** For app2**\nIn app2/views.py:</p><div><pre><code>from django.shortcuts import render\n\ndef app2_home(request):\n    return render(request, 'app2_home.html')\n</code></pre></div><p>Then I created app2/urls.py:</p><div><pre><code>from django.urls import path\nfrom .views import app2_home\n\nurlpatterns = [\n    path('', app2_home, name='app2_home'),\n]\n</code></pre></div><h2>\n  \n  \n  Step 6: Connecting Both Apps in mysite/urls.py\n</h2><p>Now it was time to connect both apps to the main URL configuration.</p><p>In mysite/urls.py I wrote:</p><div><pre><code>from django.contrib import admin\nfrom django.urls import path, include\n\nfrom django.contrib import admin\nfrom django.urls import path, include\n\nurlpatterns = [\n    path('admin/', admin.site.urls),\n    path('app1/', include('app1.urls')),\n    path('app2/', include('app2.urls')),\n]\n\n</code></pre></div><p>At first, I forgot to import include and Django gave me an error. But once I fixed that, the server ran smoothly.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Step 7: Adding Templates for HTML Pages\n</h2><p>After getting simple text responses to show up using HttpResponse, I wanted to display proper HTML pages using templates.</p><p>So I created a templates folder inside each app\nIn both app1 and app2, I made this folder structure:</p><div><pre><code>app1/\n‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ templates/\n    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ app1/\n        ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ home.html\n</code></pre></div><div><pre><code>app2/\n‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ templates/\n    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ app2/\n        ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ home.html\n</code></pre></div><p>I created basic HTML files in both apps.</p><p>I updated the views to render templates\nIn app1/views.py:</p><div><pre><code>from django.shortcuts import render\n\ndef home(request):\n    return render(request, 'app1/home.html')\n</code></pre></div><div><pre><code>In app2/views.py:\n\n`from django.shortcuts import render\n\ndef home(request):\n    return render(request, 'app2/home.html')\n</code></pre></div><p>I ran the server with the following command</p><p><code>python manage.py runserver</code></p><p>Then I opened my browser and tested. this is what my page looked like after adding /app1 in the URL generated. </p><p>Seeing both apps work made me feel proud and confident in using Django.</p><ol><li>Django projects can be modular ‚Äî I can add many apps like I did with app1 and app2.</li><li>The outer folder (njeri) holds everything; the inner mysite/ config folder manages settings, URLs, and deployment files.</li><li>Even small mistakes (like forgetting include) can break the app ‚Äî but the error messages help a lot\n</li></ol><p>Building the njeri project taught me how Django is structured and how everything connects from creating apps, to writing views, to linking URLs. Working with two apps in one project showed me Django‚Äôs power and flexibility.</p><p>I‚Äôm still learning, but now I feel more confident to build real Django websites. \n Feel free to connect and grow together at github @Rebecca-254</p>","contentLength":4328,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Real Python: Use TorchAudio to Prepare Audio Data for Deep Learning","url":"https://realpython.com/python-torchaudio/","date":1751292000,"author":"","guid":176693,"unread":true,"content":"<p>Ever wondered how machine learning models process audio data?

You‚Äôll receive a score upon completion to help you track your learning progress:</p></div><h2>Learn Essential Technical Terms</h2><p>Before diving into the technical details of audio processing with TorchAudio, take a moment to review some key terms. They‚Äôll help you grasp the basics of working with audio data.</p><p>A waveform is the visual representation of sound as it travels through air over time. When you speak, sing, or play music, you create vibrations that move through the air as waves. These waves can be captured and displayed as a graph showing how the sound‚Äôs pressure changes over time. Here‚Äôs an example:</p><a href=\"https://files.realpython.com/media/sample-waveform-torchaudio.6e633b1568cf.png\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://files.realpython.com/media/sample-waveform-torchaudio.6e633b1568cf.png\" width=\"1980\" height=\"780\" alt=\"A sample waveform of a 440 HZ wave\"></a>A Sample Waveform of a 440 Hz Wave\n\n<p>This is a waveform of a 440 Hz wave, plotted over a short duration of 10 milliseconds (ms). This is called a <strong>time-domain representation</strong>, showing how the wave‚Äôs amplitude changes over time. This waveform shows the raw signal as it appears in an audio editor. The ups and downs reflect changes in loudness.</p><p> is the strength or intensity of a sound wave‚Äîin other words, how loud the sound is to the listener. In the previous image, it‚Äôs represented by the height of the wave from its center line.</p><p>A higher amplitude means a louder sound, while a lower amplitude means a quieter sound. When you adjust the volume on your device, you‚Äôre actually changing the amplitude of the audio signal. In digital audio, amplitude is typically measured in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decibel\">decibels (dB)</a> or as a normalized value between -1 and 1.</p><p> is how many times a sound wave repeats itself in one second, measured in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hertz\">hertz (Hz)</a>. For example, a low bass note is a sound wave that repeats slowly, about 50‚Äì100 Hz. In contrast, a high-pitched whistle has a wave that repeats much faster, around 2000‚Äì3000 Hz.</p><p>In music, different frequencies create different musical notes. For instance, the A note that musicians use to tune their instruments is exactly 440 Hz. Now, if you were to look at the frequency plot of the 440 Hz waveform from before, here‚Äôs what you‚Äôd see:</p><a href=\"https://files.realpython.com/media/frequency-domain-torchaudio.59106603f830.png\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://files.realpython.com/media/frequency-domain-torchaudio.59106603f830.png\" width=\"1980\" height=\"580\" alt=\"Frequency domain plot of a 440 HZ wave\"></a>A Frequency Domain Plot of a 440 Hz Wave\n\n<p>This plot displays the signal in the , which shows how much of each frequency is present in the sound. The distinct peak at 440 Hz indicates that this is the dominant frequency in the signal, which is exactly what you‚Äôd expect from a pure tone. While time-domain plots‚Äîlike the one you saw earlier‚Äîreveal how the sound‚Äôs amplitude changes over time, frequency-domain plots help you understand which frequencies make up the sound.</p><p>The waveform you just explored was from a 440 Hz wave. You‚Äôll soon see that many examples in audio processing also deal with this mysterious frequency. So, what makes it so special?</p><div><p> The <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A440_(pitch_standard)\">440 Hz frequency</a> (A note) is the international standard pitch reference for tuning instruments. Its clear, single-frequency nature makes it great for audio tasks. These include sampling, frequency analysis, and waveform representation.</p></div><p>Now that you understand frequency and how it relates to sound waves, you might be wondering how computers actually capture and store these waves. </p><p>When you record sound digitally, you‚Äôre taking snapshots of the audio wave many times per second. Each snapshot measures the wave‚Äôs amplitude at that instant. This is called sampling. The number of snapshots taken per second is the , measured in hertz (Hz).</p>","contentLength":4584,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"I Built a Tool to Search AI Conversations in 1 Week (With Heavy AI Assistance)","url":"https://dev.to/d_p_6e7c8572c8febaab6c33d/i-built-a-tool-to-search-ai-conversations-in-1-week-with-heavy-ai-assistance-2elj","date":1751291421,"author":"D P","guid":176676,"unread":true,"content":"<p>I had hundreds of AI conversations with Claude and ChatGPT.

The system, built on FastAPI and leveraging Pydantic for data validation, began intermittently flagging legitimate transactions as fraudulent. The root cause? A subtle interaction between Pydantic‚Äôs internal data manipulation and augmented assignment (, , etc.) when updating a shared, mutable state within an async worker pool. Specifically, the in-place modification of a list used for feature engineering was leading to race conditions and data corruption. This incident highlighted a critical gap in our understanding of augmented assignment‚Äôs behavior, particularly within concurrent and type-sensitive environments. This post details the intricacies of augmented assignment in Python, focusing on production considerations, debugging strategies, and best practices to avoid similar pitfalls.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  What is \"augmented assignment\" in Python?\n</h3><p>Augmented assignment operators (e.g., , , , , , , , , , , , ) are syntactic sugar for combining an arithmetic or bitwise operation with assignment.  Crucially, they are  always equivalent to the explicit operation followed by assignment.  This behavior is defined in PEP 203 and is tied to the , , etc., methods.  If an object defines an in-place operation method (e.g., ), augmented assignment will invoke that method. Otherwise, it falls back to the equivalent .</p><p>This distinction is vital.  For mutable objects like lists,  modifies the object in-place, avoiding a new allocation. For immutable objects like integers, the fallback behavior is used, creating a new object.  This difference impacts performance and, as we saw in the fraud detection incident, concurrency.  The typing system, as defined in PEP 484, treats augmented assignment as a special case, allowing for more precise type inference and static analysis.</p><ol><li><strong>FastAPI Request Handling:</strong>  In high-throughput APIs, accumulating request metrics (e.g., latency histograms) often uses augmented assignment to update counters in-place, minimizing allocation overhead.\n</li></ol><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><ol><li><p><strong>Async Job Queues (Celery/RQ):</strong>  Updating task progress or retry counts within a worker process benefits from the in-place modification offered by augmented assignment.</p></li><li><p><strong>Type-Safe Data Models (Pydantic/Dataclasses):</strong>  While Pydantic generally discourages direct mutation, internal operations like updating nested dictionaries or lists within a model can inadvertently use augmented assignment, leading to unexpected behavior if not carefully managed.</p></li><li><p> Accumulating statistics or processing large datasets in a CLI tool often utilizes augmented assignment for efficiency.</p></li><li><p><strong>ML Preprocessing (Pandas/NumPy):</strong>  In-place operations on NumPy arrays or Pandas DataFrames using augmented assignment are common for performance optimization, but require careful consideration of data sharing and potential side effects.</p></li></ol><h3>\n  \n  \n  Integration with Python Tooling\n</h3><p>Augmented assignment interacts significantly with Python‚Äôs tooling.</p><ul><li><p>  Mypy correctly infers types for augmented assignments, providing static type checking.  However, it can sometimes struggle with complex in-place operations on mutable objects, requiring explicit type annotations.</p></li><li><p> Pydantic‚Äôs validation and serialization logic can be affected by augmented assignment if mutable default values are used.  Using immutable defaults (e.g.,  instead of ) is a best practice.</p></li><li><p>  Testing code that uses augmented assignment requires careful consideration of state management.  Fixtures should be used to isolate tests and prevent unintended side effects.</p></li><li><p>  As demonstrated by the fraud detection incident, augmented assignment in concurrent code requires synchronization mechanisms (e.g., ) to prevent race conditions.</p></li></ul><p> configuration for mypy:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><h3>\n  \n  \n  Failure Scenarios &amp; Debugging\n</h3><p>The fraud detection incident was a prime example of a race condition. Multiple async workers were simultaneously modifying the same list, leading to inconsistent data.  Debugging involved:</p><ol><li> Adding detailed logging around the augmented assignment operation to track the state of the list.</li><li> Analyzing the exception traces to identify the point of failure.</li><li> Using  to step through the code and inspect the state of the variables.</li><li> Profiling the code to identify performance bottlenecks and areas where contention was occurring.</li></ol><p>Another common failure is unexpected behavior when an object doesn't define the  method, leading to a new object being created instead of modifying the original in-place. This can cause subtle bugs if the code relies on the original object being mutated.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Performance &amp; Scalability\n</h3><p>Augmented assignment can significantly improve performance by avoiding unnecessary object allocations. However, excessive in-place modification can lead to increased memory usage and contention in concurrent environments.</p><ul><li> Use  to benchmark the performance of augmented assignment versus explicit assignment.</li><li> Identify performance bottlenecks and areas where in-place modification is causing contention.</li><li> Minimize the use of shared mutable state to reduce the need for synchronization.</li><li> Limit the number of concurrent workers to reduce contention.</li></ul><p>Augmented assignment can introduce security vulnerabilities if used with untrusted data. For example, if a user-supplied value is used in an augmented assignment operation on a sensitive object, it could lead to code injection or privilege escalation.  Always validate and sanitize user input before using it in any operation.  Be particularly cautious when deserializing data from untrusted sources.</p><ul><li>  Write unit tests to verify the correctness of augmented assignment operations.</li><li>  Test the interaction of augmented assignment with other components of the system.</li><li><strong>Property-Based Tests (Hypothesis):</strong> Use Hypothesis to generate random inputs and verify that the code behaves correctly under a wide range of conditions.</li><li>  Enforce type safety using mypy.</li><li> Integrate testing and type validation into the CI/CD pipeline.</li></ul><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><h3>\n  \n  \n  Common Pitfalls &amp; Anti-Patterns\n</h3><ol><li> Using mutable default values in function arguments can lead to unexpected behavior with augmented assignment.</li><li> Assuming augmented assignment always modifies the object in-place.</li><li> Using augmented assignment in concurrent code without proper synchronization.</li><li><strong>Overuse of In-Place Modification:</strong>  Excessive in-place modification can lead to increased memory usage and contention.</li><li>  Failing to use type hints can make it difficult to reason about the behavior of augmented assignment.</li></ol><h3>\n  \n  \n  Best Practices &amp; Architecture\n</h3><ul><li>  Always use type hints to improve code clarity and prevent errors.</li><li>  Prefer immutable data structures whenever possible.</li><li>  Separate data manipulation logic from business logic.</li><li>  Validate and sanitize all user input.</li><li>  Design code in a modular way to improve testability and maintainability.</li><li>  Automate testing, type validation, and deployment.</li></ul><p>Augmented assignment is a powerful feature of Python, but it requires careful consideration, especially in production environments. Understanding its nuances, potential pitfalls, and interactions with other tools is crucial for building robust, scalable, and maintainable systems.  Refactor legacy code to use immutable data structures where appropriate, measure performance to identify bottlenecks, write comprehensive tests, and enforce type safety to mitigate risks.

This idea came from earlier languages and logic systems. Over time,  became a stable, simple way to say ‚Äúnothing here.‚Äù</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  People created special constants for \"no value\"\n</h3><p><strong>1960 ‚Äî Logical null in Lisp</strong>: Used  to show the end of a list or no result.<strong>1970 ‚Äî Null pointers in C</strong>: Used  as a placeholder when no memory was assigned.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  People designed Python's version of null\n</h3><p>: Introduced  as a built-in name for \"no value.\": Began using  more clearly in function returns and empty defaults.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  People made Python None more consistent\n</h3><p>: Locked  as a constant.

With many different database sources, and formats available storing them, managing them and running SQL queries to use them. All of this is very tedious work, one that requires accuracy and fast results.</p><p>The perfect solution for this, is the new <a href=\"https://docs.mindsdb.com/mindsdb_sql/knowledge-bases\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Knowledge Base</a> :- an an advance system that organizes data with its actual meaning not by just cross matching the frequent words or important keywords. </p><ul><li><p>MindsDB's new Knowledge Base organizes data by its actual meaning, not just by the keywords or frequent words matching</p></li><li><p>It Supports semantic search with context-aware retrieval</p></li><li><p>Handles various data sources like databases, CSV, text, and many other integrations like Youtube, <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Hackernews</a></p></li><li><p>Utilizes embedding models, re-ranking models, and vector stores to create embeddings to provide context data retrieval.</p></li><li><p>Enables intelligent querying and meaningful data discovery</p></li></ul><p>To make interacting with MindsDB's powerful features even more intuitive and efficient, especially its cutting-edge Knowledge Base and AI Agent functionalities, I developed . Kleos (a greek word which summaries, <em>The enduring transmission of meaningful, wise knowledge ‚Äî curated, remembered, and used across time.</em>) is a Python-based async command-line interface designed to be your trusty companion for using the MindsDB Knowledge Base.</p><p>Every system has its  ‚Äî its final cause or purpose. This CLI fulfills the purpose of MindsDB's Knowledge Base: to seek, structure, and serve insight through intelligent agents. Kleos aims to streamline the process of building and managing these intelligent systems directly from your terminal.</p><p>This article will walk you through Kleos CLI, highlighting its key features and demonstrating how it leverages MindsDB KB to help you build powerful AI-driven applications with ease.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Core Philosophy: SQL as the Language of AI\n</h2><p>One of MindsDB's foundational principles, which Kleos has integrated at root level, is the use of SQL as the primary language for AI development. Instead of requiring developers to learn complex machine learning libraries or manage separate MLOps pipelines for many common tasks, MindsDB allows you to:</p><ul><li><strong>Connect to diverse data sources:</strong> From your existing databases to SaaS applications and file storages.</li><li> Train models for tasks like classification, regression, time series forecasting, and even interact with large language models (LLMs) for generative tasks.</li><li> Create semantic search capabilities over your textual data.</li><li> Combine LLMs with your data and KBs to create intelligent assistants.</li><li><strong>Query Predictions and Insights:</strong> Fetch predictions and insights as if you were querying a regular database table.</li></ul><p>All of this achieved by using SQL extensions. Kleos CLI acts as a convenient and powerful interface to execute these SQL commands, manage your MindsDB resources, and automate workflows, making the power of in-database AI more accessible than ever. We've built Kleos using Python, <a href=\"https://click.palletsprojects.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Click</a> for robust command-line parsing, and <a href=\"https://rich.readthedocs.io/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Rich</a> for beautiful, informative terminal output.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Key Features of Kleos &amp; MindsDB in Action\n</h3><p>Kleos provides a comprehensive suite of commands to manage various aspects of your MindsDB environment. Here‚Äôs a look at some core functionalities:</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  1. Seamless Setup ()\n</h3><p>Getting started often involves connecting to your data. MindsDB excels at integrating with numerous data sources. Kleos helps you quickly set up common datasources. For instance, the HackerNews datasource, a popular source for real-time discussions and articles, can be configured with a single command:</p><div><pre><code>kleos setup hackernews  my_hackernews_data\n</code></pre></div><p>This simple command tells MindsDB to create a connection named  that can query HackerNews directly. Kleos ensures this process is smooth, even creating the datasource if it doesn't already exist when you try to use it in other commands.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  2. Knowledge Bases (KBs) - The Heart of Kleos ()\n</h3><p>Knowledge Bases are a cornerstone of MindsDB's recent advancements, allowing you to embed and search large volumes of text data semantically. Kleos provides extensive support for managing KBs.</p><p><strong>a. Creating Knowledge Bases ()</strong></p><p>You can easily create a new KB, specifying the underlying embedding models (to convert text to vectors) and optional reranking models (to improve search result relevance). Kleos supports models from various providers like Ollama (for local LLMs) and Google Gemini.</p><div><pre><code>\n\nkleos kb create gemini_ollama_kb  ollama  nomic-embed-text  gemini  gemini-2.0-flash  YOUR_GOOGLE_API_KEY </code></pre></div><p>Kleos handles the construction of the  SQL, including the JSON parameters for model configurations.</p><p><strong>b. Ingesting Data ()</strong></p><p>Once a KB is created, you need to populate it. Kleos simplifies data ingestion, especially from structured sources like the HackerNews tables.</p><div><pre><code>\nkleos kb ingest my_hn_kb  stories  100  my_hackernews_data\n</code></pre></div><p>For more control, you can specify which columns map to your KB's content and metadata:</p><div><pre><code>kleos kb ingest my_custom_kb  comments\n   my_hackernews_data\n   200\n</code></pre></div><p>This command translates to an <code>INSERT INTO ... SELECT ...</code> statement, efficiently loading data into your KB.</p><p><strong>c. Semantic Search ()</strong></p><p>The true power of KBs lies in semantic search. Kleos allows you to query your KBs using natural language, with options for metadata filtering:</p><div><pre><code>\nkleos kb query my_docs_kb \nkleos kb query product_reviews_kb  5\n</code></pre></div><p>The  accepts a JSON string, enabling powerful, targeted queries by combining vector search with traditional attribute filtering.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  3. AI Agents - Your Intelligent Assistants (, )\n</h3><p>MindsDB allows you to create AI Agents that combine the power of Large Language Models (LLMs) with the contextual knowledge stored in your KBs and databases. Kleos makes agent creation and interaction straightforward.</p><p><strong>a. Creating Agents ()</strong></p><p>Define an agent, link it to one or more KBs, and specify the LLM it should use:</p><div><pre><code>\nkleos kb create-agent product_support_agent \n   gemini-2.0-flash \n  </code></pre></div><p>You can also include regular database tables for additional context and pass other parameters like temperature or API keys.</p><p><strong>b. Querying Agents ()</strong></p><p>Once created, interact with your agent using natural language:</p><div><pre><code>kleos kb query-agent product_support_agent </code></pre></div><p>The agent will leverage its LLM and the content from  to provide an answer.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  4. AI Models / Generative AI Tables ()\n</h3><p>Beyond KBs and Agents, Kleos helps you manage MindsDB's powerful AI Models (often referred to as Generative AI Tables). These models are trained on your data using SQL and can perform a variety of tasks.</p><p><strong>a. Creating AI Models from Data ()</strong></p><p>Train a model directly from a SQL query. For example, to create a model that summarizes HackerNews story titles:</p><div><pre><code>kleos ai create-model title_summarizer\n   title_summary\n   google\n   api_key YOUR_GOOGLE_API_KEY\n   model_name gemini-2.0-flash\n</code></pre></div><p>This creates a queryable  model. You can then select from it, providing new titles to get summaries. Kleos supports listing, describing, refreshing, and dropping these models too.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  5. Automation with MindsDB Jobs ()\n</h3><p>Repetitive tasks like data ingestion or model retraining can be automated using MindsDB Jobs. Kleos provides commands to manage these jobs.</p><p><strong>a.

HSBC, one of the world's largest banking and financial services organizations, is at the forefront of integrating sustainability into its financial practices. This article examines HSBC's approach to sustainable finance, the initiatives it has undertaken, and the impact of these efforts on global markets.</p><ol><li>HSBC‚Äôs Commitment to Sustainability\nHSBC's commitment to sustainability is deeply embedded in its corporate strategy. The bank recognizes that environmental, social, and governance (ESG) factors are essential to long-term financial performance and economic stability. HSBC‚Äôs sustainability strategy is centered around three main pillars: financing sustainable growth, managing environmental impact, and supporting communities and economic development.\na. Financing Sustainable Growth\nHSBC aims to support the transition to a more sustainable global economy by financing projects and investments that promote environmental sustainability and social responsibility. The bank‚Äôs financing activities are aligned with its goal to facilitate the flow of capital towards sustainable investments and innovations.\nb. Managing Environmental Impact\nHSBC is committed to minimizing its own environmental footprint. This includes reducing its carbon emissions, conserving energy, and managing waste effectively. The bank's internal sustainability practices reflect its broader commitment to environmental stewardship.\nc. Supporting Communities and Economic Development\nHSBC supports various community initiatives and economic development programs that contribute to social well-being and economic resilience. By investing in projects that enhance social infrastructure and promote inclusive growth, the bank aims to create positive social impacts.</li><li>Sustainable Finance Framework\nHSBC has established a robust framework for sustainable finance that guides its investment and lending practices. This framework encompasses several key elements:</li></ol><p>a. Green and Sustainable Bonds\nHSBC is a significant player in the green and sustainable bond market. The bank issues and underwrites green bonds that fund projects with positive environmental impacts, such as renewable energy, energy efficiency, and sustainable infrastructure. HSBC‚Äôs involvement in this market supports the growth of sustainable finance and helps channel capital towards projects that address climate change and environmental degradation.<p>\nb. Sustainability-Linked Loans</p>\nSustainability-linked loans (SLLs) are another key component of HSBC‚Äôs sustainable finance framework. SLLs are loans where the interest rates are linked to the borrower‚Äôs performance on sustainability targets. This structure incentivizes borrowers to achieve their sustainability goals, such as reducing carbon emissions or improving environmental practices, while benefiting from potentially lower borrowing costs.<p>\nc. Integration of ESG Factors</p>\nHSBC integrates ESG factors into its investment decision-making process. The bank evaluates the environmental and social impacts of its investments and lending activities to ensure they align with sustainability goals. This approach helps mitigate risks associated with ESG issues and supports the development of sustainable investment portfolios.<p>\nd. Alignment with International Standards</p>\nHSBC aligns its sustainability practices with international standards and frameworks, such as the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the Paris Agreement. By adhering to these global standards, HSBC ensures that its sustainable finance initiatives contribute to broader international efforts to address climate change and promote sustainable development.</p><ol><li>Key Initiatives and Projects\nHSBC has undertaken several significant initiatives and projects to advance its sustainability agenda. These initiatives highlight the bank‚Äôs commitment to integrating sustainability into its financial practices and driving positive change.</li></ol><p>a. HSBC‚Äôs Commitment to Net Zero\nOne of HSBC‚Äôs most ambitious sustainability goals is to achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. The bank has set interim targets to reduce its operational carbon footprint and align its financing activities with the goal of limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius. HSBC is working to transition its investment portfolio and lending activities to support a low-carbon economy.<p>\nb. Green Infrastructure Investment</p>\nHSBC is actively involved in financing green infrastructure projects that promote sustainable development. This includes investments in renewable energy, energy-efficient buildings, and sustainable transportation systems. By supporting these projects, HSBC contributes to the development of resilient and environmentally friendly infrastructure.<p>\nc. Support for Sustainable Agriculture</p>\nHSBC is also engaged in financing sustainable agriculture initiatives. The bank provides funding for projects that enhance agricultural productivity while minimizing environmental impacts. This includes supporting practices such as sustainable farming, water conservation, and soil management.<p>\nd. Community Development and Social Impact</p>\nIn addition to environmental initiatives, HSBC invests in community development and social impact projects. The bank supports programs that address social inequalities, promote financial inclusion, and enhance educational opportunities. These initiatives contribute to the overall well-being of communities and support sustainable economic development.</p><ol><li>Impact on Global Markets\nHSBC‚Äôs sustainable finance initiatives have had a significant impact on global markets, influencing investment practices, financial regulations, and corporate behaviors.</li></ol><p>a. Driving Growth in Sustainable Finance\nHSBC‚Äôs leadership in sustainable finance has contributed to the growth of the green and sustainable bond markets. By issuing and underwriting green bonds, the bank has helped to establish a robust market for sustainable investments. This, in turn, has encouraged other financial institutions to adopt similar practices and invest in sustainable projects.<p>\nb. Setting Industry Standards</p>\nHSBC‚Äôs approach to sustainable finance has set industry standards and served as a model for other banks and financial institutions. The bank‚Äôs integration of ESG factors, alignment with international standards, and commitment to net-zero emissions have influenced the development of best practices in the industry. This has helped drive the adoption of sustainable finance practices across the global financial sector.<p>\nc. Influencing Regulatory Developments</p>\nHSBC‚Äôs focus on sustainability has also influenced regulatory developments in financial markets. The bank‚Äôs alignment with international frameworks and standards has contributed to the formulation of regulations and guidelines that promote sustainable finance. HSBC‚Äôs efforts support the broader regulatory push towards greater transparency, accountability, and integration of ESG factors in financial practices.<p>\nd. Promoting Corporate Responsibility</p>\nHSBC‚Äôs commitment to sustainability has reinforced the importance of corporate responsibility and environmental stewardship. The bank‚Äôs initiatives highlight the role of financial institutions in addressing global challenges such as climate change, social inequality, and environmental degradation. This emphasis on corporate responsibility has encouraged other companies to adopt similar practices and contribute to sustainable development.</p><ol><li>Challenges and Future Outlook\nWhile HSBC‚Äôs sustainable finance initiatives have achieved notable successes, the bank faces several challenges in its sustainability journey.\na. Balancing Short-Term and Long-Term Goals\nOne challenge is balancing short-term financial performance with long-term sustainability goals. As HSBC transitions to a low-carbon economy and integrates ESG factors into its financial practices, the bank must navigate potential trade-offs between immediate financial returns and long-term sustainability objectives.\nb. Ensuring Accurate Reporting and Transparency\nAccurate reporting and transparency are critical to maintaining credibility and trust in sustainable finance. HSBC must ensure that its sustainability reporting reflects genuine progress and adheres to industry standards. This includes providing clear and verifiable information about the environmental and social impacts of its investments and lending activities.\nc. Addressing Evolving Market Demands\nThe sustainable finance landscape is continually evolving, with new trends, technologies, and regulations emerging. HSBC must stay agile and adapt to these changes to remain at the forefront of sustainable finance. This includes embracing new innovations, addressing evolving investor expectations, and responding to regulatory developments.\nd. Enhancing Global Collaboration\nSustainable finance requires global collaboration and coordination. HSBC must work with governments, regulators, investors, and other stakeholders to address global challenges and promote sustainable development. Strengthening partnerships and fostering collaboration will be essential for achieving collective sustainability goals.\nConclusion\nHSBC‚Äôs approach to integrating sustainability into its financial practices has positioned it as a leader in the global financial sector. Through its commitment to sustainable finance, robust framework, and key initiatives, the bank is driving positive change and influencing global markets. HSBC‚Äôs efforts in financing sustainable growth, managing environmental impacts, and supporting communities contribute to a more sustainable and resilient global economy. As the financial industry continues to evolve, HSBC‚Äôs leadership in sustainable finance will play a crucial role in shaping the future of finance and addressing the world‚Äôs most pressing challenges.\nUncover the latest trends and insights with our articles on Visionary Vogues</li></ol>","contentLength":10099,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Python Bytes: #438 Motivation time","url":"https://pythonbytes.fm/episodes/show/438/motivation-time","date":1751270400,"author":"","guid":177050,"unread":true,"content":"<article>&lt;strong&gt;Topics covered in this episode:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n\t&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;* &lt;a href=\"https://www.pythonmorsels.com/articles/cheat-sheet/?featured_on=pythonbytes\"&gt;Python Cheat Sheets from Trey Hunner&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;*&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;* &lt;a href=\"https://automatisch.io?featured_on=pythonbytes\"&gt;Automatisch&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;*&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;* &lt;a href=\"https://github.com/hbmartin/mureq-typed?featured_on=pythonbytes\"&gt;mureq-typed&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;*&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;* &lt;a href=\"https://frankwiles.com/posts/my-cli-world/?featured_on=pythonbytes\"&gt;My CLI World&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;*&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Extras&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Joke&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n\n&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJdZvyoftDE' style='font-weight: bold;'data-umami-event=\"Livestream-Past\" data-umami-event-episode=\"438\"&gt;Watch on YouTube&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About the show&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sponsored by&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Posit:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=\"https://pythonbytes.fm/connect\"&gt;pythonbytes.fm/connect&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Connect with the hosts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Michael: &lt;a href=\"https://fosstodon.org/@mkennedy\"&gt;@mkennedy@fosstodon.org&lt;/a&gt; / &lt;a href=\"https://bsky.app/profile/mkennedy.codes?featured_on=pythonbytes\"&gt;@mkennedy.codes&lt;/a&gt; (bsky)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Brian: &lt;a href=\"https://fosstodon.org/@brianokken\"&gt;@brianokken@fosstodon.org&lt;/a&gt; / &lt;a href=\"https://bsky.app/profile/brianokken.bsky.social?featured_on=pythonbytes\"&gt;@brianokken.bsky.social&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Show: &lt;a href=\"https://fosstodon.org/@pythonbytes\"&gt;@pythonbytes@fosstodon.org&lt;/a&gt; / &lt;a href=\"https://bsky.app/profile/pythonbytes.fm\"&gt;@pythonbytes.fm&lt;/a&gt; (bsky)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Join us on YouTube at &lt;a href=\"https://pythonbytes.fm/stream/live\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;pythonbytes.fm/live&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to be part of the audience.

This isn't science fiction; it's the reality of computer vision (CV), a rapidly evolving field with the potential to revolutionize numerous industries. From self-driving cars to medical diagnosis, computer vision is already transforming how we interact with technology and the world. But what exactly is it, and how does it work?</p><p><strong>Understanding the Fundamentals: Teaching Computers to See</strong></p><p>At its core, computer vision is about enabling computers to \"understand\" digital images and videos. Think of it as giving computers the gift of sight. Unlike humans who effortlessly interpret visual information, computers require sophisticated algorithms and techniques to achieve this. The process generally involves several key steps:</p><ol><li><p> This is the initial stage where the computer receives the visual data ‚Äì whether from a camera, a scanner, or a digital image file.</p></li><li><p>  Raw images often contain noise or inconsistencies.  Pre-processing steps, like noise reduction and image sharpening, clean up the data to make it easier for the computer to analyze.  Think of it as preparing a messy kitchen before you start cooking ‚Äì you need a clean workspace to work efficiently.</p></li><li><p>  This is where the magic happens.  Algorithms identify key features within the image, such as edges, corners, textures, and colors.  These features are then represented mathematically, allowing the computer to understand the image's content in a quantifiable way.  Imagine describing a face: you'd focus on the eyes, nose, and mouth ‚Äì these are the features a computer extracts.</p></li><li><p><strong>Object Recognition and Classification:</strong>  Using the extracted features, the computer attempts to identify and classify objects within the image. This involves comparing the extracted features to known patterns stored in a database.  This is like recognizing a friend's face based on their features.</p></li><li><p>  This advanced stage goes beyond object recognition, aiming to understand the relationships between objects and the overall context of the image or video.  For example, understanding that a cat is sitting  a mat, not  it.</p></li></ol><p><strong>The Significance and Opportunities:</strong></p><p>Computer vision addresses a fundamental limitation of computers: their inability to directly interact with the physical world through visual input. By bridging this gap, CV opens up a wealth of opportunities:</p><ul><li>  CV powers robotic systems in factories, warehouses, and even surgery, improving efficiency and precision.</li><li>  Facial recognition, object detection, and anomaly detection systems enhance security in various settings, from airports to homes.</li><li>  CV assists in medical image analysis, enabling faster and more accurate diagnoses of diseases like cancer.</li><li>  Self-driving cars rely heavily on CV to navigate roads, identify pedestrians and obstacles, and make driving decisions.</li><li>  CV enhances customer experience through features like virtual try-ons, automated checkout, and inventory management.</li></ul><p><strong>Applications Across Industries:</strong></p><p>The applications of computer vision are incredibly diverse and continue to expand. Here are a few examples:</p><ul><li>  Monitoring crop health, identifying pests and diseases, optimizing irrigation.</li><li>  Quality control, defect detection, robotic assembly.</li><li>  Tracking player movements, analyzing game strategies, enhancing broadcasting.</li><li><strong>Environmental Monitoring:</strong>  Analyzing satellite imagery for deforestation, pollution detection, and wildlife tracking.</li></ul><p><strong>Challenges, Limitations, and Ethical Considerations:</strong></p><p>Despite its remarkable progress, computer vision faces challenges:</p><ul><li>  Training accurate CV models requires vast amounts of labeled data, which can be expensive and time-consuming to acquire.</li><li>  Processing high-resolution images and videos requires significant computing power, making some applications resource-intensive.</li><li><strong>Robustness and Generalization:</strong>  CV systems can struggle with variations in lighting, viewpoints, and occlusions, limiting their ability to generalize to unseen scenarios.</li><li>  Bias in training data can lead to discriminatory outcomes, particularly in applications like facial recognition.  Privacy concerns related to image and video data also need careful consideration.</li></ul><p><strong>The Future of Computer Vision:</strong></p><p>Computer vision is rapidly evolving, driven by advancements in deep learning, improved algorithms, and increased computing power. We can expect to see even more sophisticated and pervasive applications in the near future. The development of more robust, explainable, and ethically sound CV systems will be crucial to realizing its full potential and ensuring its responsible deployment across various sectors. The ability of computers to \"see\" and understand the world around them is no longer a futuristic fantasy; it is a powerful technology shaping our present and future, demanding careful consideration of its immense capabilities and potential impact.</p>","contentLength":4872,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Digital Transformation in Agri-Machinery: Autosteer Leads the Way","url":"https://dev.to/gnss/digital-transformation-in-agri-machinery-autosteer-leads-the-way-4j01","date":1751249048,"author":"zly","guid":175500,"unread":true,"content":"<p>In the fast-evolving world of agriculture, precision and efficiency have become key drivers for success.

The most basic example to demonstrate this concept is iterating the elements in a list.</p><p>This is a loop style more suitable when you know the number of times a task is to be repeated. In the following case I know it will be the same number as the quantity of elements in the list. This subtle detail will become more relevant ahead in this chapter.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>The syntax is very straightforward, but it is important to understand what is actually going on.</p><p>For each element in , I am declaring a variable , then  it. There's no problem in using the same variable name for all the elements, because for each element there's a new task repetition cycle (iteration), so this variable is re-declared for each element, in every new iteration.</p><blockquote><p>In case you are wondering why I named a variable , it's a common practice to use single letters in this very specific context (iterating a collection of elements). But this is a matter of taste, as many people tend to adopt something more descriptive, such as the singular version of the list name. In this case, it would be \"branch\". Personally, I dislike this approach, since normally these two variables' names become very similar, so it gets easy to mistake them. Learn more about these naming practices in the  post.</p></blockquote><h2>\n  \n  \n  Iterating over indexes in a collection\n</h2><p>As seen in the previous example with branches, each iteration returns the value of the element. But it's also possible to obtain the indexes along with the values, by using the  built-in class :</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><blockquote><p>If the syntax of <code>for i, v in enumerate(winners)</code> looks unfamiliar to you, this is a concept explained in the  post. </p><p>You can also use  with tuples, sets and dicts.</p></blockquote><p>Even though I know the number of times this task is to be repeated (a typical use case for the  loop), let's rewrite the example above using the  loop style, so it's easier to visualize what it does.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>As you can see, it became a lot more verbose than the  example. I initiated  as 0, and while the value of counter is less than the quantity of elements in  (which is 4), the program performs the following tasks:</p><ul><li> the index  (0 at this moment) in .</li><li>Increments the value of  by 1 (0 + 1 = 1).</li></ul><p>Then it moves up to the next iteration, maintaining the new updated value of  (which just became 1), and repeats both tasks again. In other words,  starts at 0, then it becomes 1, then 2, then 3...then it stops, because 3 is less than 4 (remember that  is 4). This signals that the loop is over.</p><p>Another way of interpreting the  loop is like saying: \"for as long as this condition is met ( being less than the quantity of elements in branches), perform the following tasks.\"</p><blockquote><p>Instead of , you may write it . It's a shortcut for the same thing and it's more commonly used. See more about this syntax in the  post.</p></blockquote><p>Let's see a more suitable use case for the  loop, which is when you don't know how many times a task will be repeated:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Let's analyze the implementation:</p><p>\nThe  keyword needs to evaluate a boolean condition. Here,  is a way of saying that the condition for the loop is already met, so the Ô¨Årst loop iteration can take place.</p><p>Now let's see what happens inside the loop (tasks to be performed):</p><p><code>employee_name = input(\"Employee name: \")</code>\nThe  function does something very interesting and useful: it asks (prompts) the program user (you) to interact with it by writing a text. This text will become the value of .</p><p><code>if employee_name == \"michael\"</code>\nHere you can see a new keyword: . It signals that the loop must be exited immediately if this condition is met. This is a very important detail, because it means that whatever you happen to write after this keyword will be ignored by the loop!</p><p>With that concept in mind, the task is to check whether  is equal to \"michael\". If so, then the loop is over. Otherwise, it moves up to the next iteration.</p><p><code>print(\"Hello, world's best boss!\")</code>\nThis is another important concept to grasp. I don't know how many iterations will be required before you (the user) decide to type \"michael\"...you might feel like writing all the other employees‚Äô names as far as I know. So, in theory, this loop could run forever! That's the point of using the  keyword, so the loop can be exited after the condition ( being equals to \"michael\") is met.</p><p>With that in mind, it's only after the loop is over that this Ô¨Ånal  will get executed. Remember: the program is stuck in an inÔ¨Ånite loop, so nothing else happens for as long as the condition is not met!</p><p>You may use while with other types too, as long as they are validated as boolean. Let‚Äôs change the previous function to implement a number of attempts, instead of having an infinite loop:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>In this case, the while loop requires that . The  variable starts at 1, which gives a green light to the  loop. Then  is incremented by 1 at each iteration. But if <code>employee_name == ‚Äúmichael‚Äù</code>, the loop is exited via the  keyword. If  reaches 3, it means the user did not type ‚Äúmichael‚Äù after 3 attempts, then the loop is exited too. Notice I added a nice message so the user can see the remaining attempts they have.</p><p>Alongside  ,  is another keyword used to cause interruptions in a loop. But in this case, to skip only the current iteration. Let‚Äôs see how it works:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>In this program, each name in the list is expected to be printed, except if it starts with the letter ‚Äúj‚Äù. In this case, the name will be skipped, and the iteration will move up to the next name.</p><blockquote><p>In a way, both  and  are similar in their nature. While  exits the whole loop,  exits only the current element in the loop. Also, both can be used in  and  loops.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>üòä Enjoying this series?

What a fallacy!</p><p>I used to think the same until my colleague Manuel asked me to review his Pull Request () for a project we were working on. As I reviewed his code, I realized that his code is so much cleaner than mine.</p><p>What made his code cleaner? Uff, I wouldn't be able to tell, but it felt better. It is like reading your own university essay and then reading one by Paul Graham or Malcom Gladwell - you just know there's a difference.</p><p>At first, I thought it was just my lack of experience with JavaScript/TypeScript (<em>as a data scientist I mostly wrote Python before</em>). But in reality, it was just me not paying enough attention to and not recognizing all patterns of clean code.</p><p>Manuel recommended me a book by Robert C. Martin and I bought it immediately. The book is called <code>The Clean Code: A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship</code>. It's an extensive and detailed book that you should not read as a novel from start to finish within a day or two. Instead, it serves as a handbook - read a chapter, reflect on it, and ideally apply it in your work. While the code examples are in Java, most of the lessons are universal to other languages.</p><p>In this blog post I won't be summarizing or paraphrasing the entire book. First, honestly I don't think I internalized the entire wisdom written there to be able to share it effectively. Second, I encourage everyone to read the book and draw their own conclusions from original source. <strong>This advice applies to any topic - always go to the original source</strong>. Finally, the book has so many valuable insights that a single blog post can't capture them all.</p><p>Instead, in this blog, I'll share the first key takeaway I gained after reading and applying some of its principles.</p><p><code>write code like you're writing an essay, not just a script</code></p><p>Let me give one example of code and how to rewrite it if you think about the code as an essay. </p><p>Suppose that we have a pipeline or a workflow that executes a set of checks. First it runs . If this external check returns , then it proceeds with the second step where the status is determined based on metrics.</p><p>Here is some dummy implementation of this workflow:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><h2>\n  \n  \n  improvement #1:  write from top to bottom\n</h2><p>The main method in this class is  which is how this workflow will be used in other codebase. Imagine you see somewhere in the codebase  and you want to know what it does. </p><p>You scroll down to the middle of the file to find  implementation. It references three other methods: ,  and .  So,  you scroll up a bit to check implementation of the first two methods. Where is ? Ahh you scroll down again, this time to the bottom of the file, to find its implementation.</p><p>Quite a lot of scrolling to follow the code. Imagine reading an essay where the introduction is halfway down the page, the main arguments are at start, and the resolution is in the bottom. We can structure our code better than that. </p><p>How about reorganizing the code so that as you follow it, you only need to scroll down? This way, everything flows naturally, just like reading a well-structured document.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><h2>\n  \n  \n  improvement #2: group into chapters\n</h2><p>The code inside  handles several tasks at varying levels of abstraction: it calls an external check, fetches metrics, and derives the status from both. However, at its core, it‚Äôs a two-step process. First, it performs an  (), and only if the first step is  does it proceed with the rest of the code (). If this were a book, these would be two distinct chapters: one for each step.</p><p>So, let's break  into two separate methods:  and . This division allows us to enhance each step with more complex logic without altering the original  implementation.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><h2>\n  \n  \n  improvement #3:  have intentional naming\n</h2><p>Now let's take a closer look at the other methods:  and . </p><p>The  method's name suggests it returns a , which is clear and straightforward. However, we notice that  takes in two unrelated arguments:  and . To understand what this method does, how it uses each argument, and what arguments it actually accepts, you'll need to dive into its implementation‚Äîespecially if you plan to use it elsewhere.</p><p>To make the code more intuitive, let's improve the naming and split it into two methods: <code>get_status_from_outcome()</code> and <code>get_status_from_metrics()</code>. This not only simplifies the functions and ensures each does only one thing, but also makes it clear what each method accepts and returns, just from their names:</p><ul><li>: accepts outcome and returns status</li><li>: accepts metrics and returns status</li></ul><p>Otherwise, instead of creating , we could also consider  which would allow us to pass the entire  variable directly, rather than just check['outcome']. </p><p>Now let's take a closer look at .</p><p>This method uses . From the name, you'd expect it to simply fetch metrics from somewhere. When the current status isn't , the method is used exactly that way: it fetches metrics, stores them in a  variable, and then the  is determined from these .</p><p>However, when the status is , the function is called without saving its output. This suggests that  is doing something more than just fetching metrics, contrary to what the name implies.</p><p>To address this confusion, we need to dive into the implementation of . Upon inspection, we find that it actually performs two tasks:</p><ol><li>It triggers a data pre-processing job if it hasn't been triggered already.</li><li>It fetches the pre-processed data and converts it into metrics.</li></ol><p>The solution is to refactor fetch_metrics so that the data pre-processing logic is separated into its own function, e.g. <code>trigger_data_preprocessing()</code>. This will make the code more understandable and prevent any misconceptions about what  is doing.</p><p>Ultimately, the names of functions and variables should reflect their purpose and intention clearly. By choosing meaningful names, you're essentially translating your plan‚Äî\"first, I will trigger data processing, then I will fetch metrics, and finally, I will derive the status from these metrics\"‚Äîinto the code itself. The specific details, such as how processing or fetching is implemented, become secondary and abstracted away. </p><p>To conclude, the core plan remains clear and easy to follow, ensuring that anyone reading the code understands the overall structure and flow at a glance, much like skimming a book by chapters and then diving into each chapter by sections.</p><p>Does it look better?

For now, this has been done procedurally but once i get the credits (If i win :) or i get a paid subscription), I can use the 'context' feature provided by MURF AI to generate the voices in just a single concurrent thread. I have used the Ken Voice with High pitch and speed at the \"clown\" setting, so that it sounds funny. For the informative voice, I have used the Abhik voice in a \"conversational\" tone with a +10% speed so people like me won't get bored when getting lectured. </p><p>\nThis can be heavily used in Social Media Marketing by companies that are making content that is heavily targeted towards the younger generations such as Gen Z or Gen Alpha. Due to the reducing attention span in these generations, It is possible to promote content in a quirky but informative way by using MURF AI voices to put the videos in a conversational context and help the user get a better gist of the product before getting into the actual proper video. Also a lot of game shows can use these conversational channels to make user-engagement a lot better and increase the popularity ratings of their shows by making the end-consumer more involved in the process itself.</p><p><strong>Created with Love by Me :) Sanat Kulkarni</strong></p>","contentLength":1978,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Getting Started with gRPC in Python (With a Restaurant Twist üçï)","url":"https://dev.to/c_6b7a8e65d067ddc62/getting-started-with-grpc-in-python-with-a-restaurant-twist--3688","date":1751209267,"author":"cycy","guid":175246,"unread":true,"content":"<p>If you've ever wondered how different parts of an app talk to each other ‚Äî or how microservices \"call\" each other behind the scenes ‚Äî this one's for you.</p><p>In this post, I'll show you how to use  to build a menu service.

Here we used the  keyword, which roughly translates into ‚Äúotherwise, if‚Ä¶‚Äù, then bonus is 50.0.</li><li>Possibility ‚ÄúC‚Äù: if none of these 2 previous possibilities  are met, we use what is stated by the  keyword, that is the equivalent to saying \"otherwise‚Ä¶\", then there‚Äôs no bonus variable. That's the reason I didn't need to state , for example; because this conclusion is already implicit! In other words, this possibility works as a fallback/default scenario.</li></ul><blockquote><p>You may add  multiple times for 4+ possibilities. Although there are better alternatives for that, such as match cases (See  post), dicts, or even ternaries (see next) in some situations.</p></blockquote><p>This is not a different conditional type  but rather an alternative way of using a conventional  statement. Its syntax may not seem very clear at Ô¨Årst glance, so let's take a different approach this time. We have a problem to solve, but instead of jumping into the code implementation, we will first gather more details about the problem itself:</p><p>A triangle may be classified in three types, accordingly to the length of its sides:</p><div><table><tbody><tr><td>All sides of equal length</td></tr><tr><td>Two sides of equal length and one side that is different</td></tr><tr><td>All three sides of different length</td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>Also, the sum of any two sides of a triangle must be greater than the third side. If this condition is not met, then it's not a valid triangle... For instance, try to draw a triangle having sides 6 cm, 3 cm and 2 cm. You cannot connect all their ends to form a triangle, right?</p><p>Now that we have more details about the problem, let's implement its solution as a function that uses a ternary to validate the possibilities and return the correct triangle type:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Now let's go over the implementation details:</p><p>\nThe Ô¨Årst thing to do is ensure the sides are valid. After all, there's no point in checking the triangle type if their sides cannot form a triangle in the Ô¨Årst place... So we perform this validation Ô¨Årst. If the sides are not valid, we exit the function by returning \"invalid\".</p><p>\nHere's the fun part. Notice that the validation works as a cascade, where each validation only takes place if the previous one is . It returns the value assigned to : which may be \"equilateral\", but only if <code>side_1 == side_2 == side_3</code>. If this is , then it is \"isosceles\", but only  or . If this is also , then it is \"scalene\", which works here as a fallback/default value.</p><blockquote><p>As mentioned earlier, the ternary syntax is a little unfamiliar, so it may take some time to get used to. Practicing is the key!</p></blockquote><p>Take a look again at the  function. Notice we didn‚Äôt use an  statement to check that the triangle has 3 valid sides. If you recall from the  post, whenever the  keyword is found in a function, the function is exited ! </p><p>We could have placed an  right after part 1 (that checks that the sides are valid), but because we added a , there‚Äôs no need for that. </p><p>Let‚Äôs consider another problem: say that a person is only allowed to drive at 18 years old, so we will write a function to check that. It should receive the person‚Äôs age as a parameter, and return  if they are allowed to drive, or  otherwise. Here‚Äôs three different implementations:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>\nThis is what we would call a naive approach. The classic structure of the statements ‚Äútrains‚Äù us to think that we must add this , because there‚Äôs another condition to be verified ( not being &gt;= 18).</p><p>\nThat‚Äôs why it‚Äôs important to understand what  does. The function returns  by default, but , it returns .</p><p>\nHere‚Äôs an example of how helpful a boolean can be (see more in the   post). The validation of  is, itself, a boolean. So we simply return it.</p><p>The main reason why you should avoid using  in functions is clarity. See for yourself. It requires less cognitive effort and time to understand what  does, compared to the other two ones.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Dict as an alternative to conditionals\n</h2><p>If you have 3+ conditionals, a dict (covered in the  post) can be another interesting alternative to an  conditional:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>In this example, the keys (department names) in  are roughly the equivalent to  conditionals. If the  parameter is found in , then its respective value (a list with people in the department) gets returned. But if it‚Äôs not found, then an empty list is returned. Wish to add a new ‚Äúcondition‚Äù? Just add a new key: value pair (department name and list of people, respectively) to ! </p><blockquote><p>The try and except keywords are covered in the  post. For now, keep in mind that if the  argument is not a key in , then an empty list is returned.</p></blockquote>","contentLength":5522,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Node.js vs Python: Battle of the Unhinged Scripting Languages That Ruined My Sleep Schedule","url":"https://dev.to/liemar90/nodejs-vs-python-battle-of-the-unhinged-scripting-languages-that-ruined-my-sleep-schedule-11fj","date":1751201617,"author":"Liemar Sarol","guid":175142,"unread":true,"content":"<p>Hey.

The root cause? A subtle mutation of an immutable data object representing a trace span, leading to inconsistent state across microservices. We were using standard Python dictionaries to represent these spans, relying on developer discipline to avoid modification.   was the immediate solution, providing a robust, type-safe foundation for our tracing data models. This incident highlighted a painful truth: relying on convention for data integrity in a complex, distributed system is a recipe for disaster. This post dives deep into , exploring its architectural implications, performance characteristics, and practical considerations for building production-grade Python applications.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  What is \"attrs\" in Python?\n</h3><p> is a Python package that simplifies writing classes, primarily data-holding classes, by automatically generating boilerplate code like , , , and .  It‚Äôs not a replacement for classes, but a powerful tool for  them more concisely and reliably.  Technically,  leverages Python‚Äôs metaclass system to modify class creation. It‚Äôs heavily inspired by similar libraries in other languages (e.g., Lombok in Java) and predates Python 3.7‚Äôs built-in . While  have narrowed the gap,  remains superior in several key areas: more robust type validation, extensive customization options, and a more mature ecosystem.  It‚Äôs fundamentally about declarative data modeling, shifting focus from implementation details to  the data represents.</p><ol><li><p><strong>FastAPI Request/Response Models:</strong>  We use  extensively in our FastAPI applications to define request and response schemas.  This provides automatic validation via Pydantic integration (see section 4), ensuring data integrity at the API boundary.  The performance overhead is negligible compared to manual validation.</p></li><li><p>  Our asynchronous task queue utilizes  to define job payloads.  The immutability enforced by  prevents accidental modification of job data during processing, crucial for idempotency and reliability.</p></li><li><p><strong>Type-Safe Data Pipelines:</strong>  In our data engineering pipelines,  classes represent data records flowing through various transformation stages.  This provides strong typing and facilitates data quality checks at each step.</p></li><li><p>  We use  to define configuration objects for our CLI tools built with Click. This allows for easy validation of command-line arguments and provides a structured way to manage application settings.</p></li><li><p><strong>Machine Learning Preprocessing:</strong> classes define the configuration for our ML preprocessing pipelines.  This ensures consistent data transformations across training and inference, reducing the risk of model drift.</p></li></ol><h3>\n  \n  \n  Integration with Python Tooling\n</h3><p> plays exceptionally well with the modern Python ecosystem.</p><ul><li> classes are fully compatible with mypy, providing static type checking.  We enforce strict type checking in our CI pipeline.</li><li> integrates seamlessly with Pydantic for runtime validation and serialization/deserialization.  This is a common pattern in FastAPI and other data-intensive applications.</li><li> classes are easily testable.  The  method generated by  simplifies assertion comparisons.</li><li> classes can be used in asynchronous code without issues.  Immutability is particularly beneficial in concurrent environments.</li></ul><p>Here's a snippet from our :</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>We also use a custom runtime hook to ensure all  classes are validated on startup in critical services:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>This example demonstrates several key features:  enforces immutability,  requires keyword arguments, and  provides built-in validation.  The  hook allows for custom validation logic.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Failure Scenarios &amp; Debugging\n</h3><p>A common pitfall is forgetting to mark a class as .  This can lead to unexpected mutations, as demonstrated in our tracing system incident.  Another issue is complex validation logic in  that can mask underlying problems.</p><p>Debugging  classes is similar to debugging regular classes.  However, the generated methods can make tracebacks less informative.  Using  or a debugger with source code mapping is crucial.  Runtime assertions can also help catch unexpected state changes.</p><p>Here's an example of a bad state we encountered:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>The fix is simple:  and using immutable data structures for fields like  (e.g., ).</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Performance &amp; Scalability\n</h3><p> introduces a small performance overhead compared to manually written classes. However, this overhead is usually negligible in most applications.  We‚Äôve benchmarked  classes against equivalent  and found the performance difference to be within acceptable limits.</p><ul><li>  Minimize the use of global variables and shared mutable state.</li><li>  Reuse objects whenever possible.</li><li>  Use appropriate locking mechanisms to prevent race conditions.</li><li>  For performance-critical sections, consider using C extensions to implement custom logic.</li></ul><p>We use  to identify performance bottlenecks and  to track memory usage.</p><p> itself doesn't introduce significant security vulnerabilities. However, improper use can lead to security issues.  Insecure deserialization is a major concern.  If you're deserializing  classes from untrusted sources, use Pydantic with strict type validation to prevent code injection or privilege escalation.  Always validate input data thoroughly.</p><p>We employ a multi-layered testing strategy:</p><ul><li>  Test individual  classes and their methods.</li><li>  Test the interaction between  classes and other components.</li><li><strong>Property-based tests (Hypothesis):</strong>  Generate random inputs to test the robustness of  classes.</li><li>  Enforce static type checking.</li></ul><p>Our CI pipeline includes:</p><ul><li>  Runs unit and integration tests.</li><li>  Performs static type checking.</li><li>  Tests the code in different Python environments.</li><li>  Automates the CI process.</li><li>  Runs linters and formatters before committing code.</li></ul><h3>\n  \n  \n  Common Pitfalls &amp; Anti-Patterns\n</h3><ol><li> Leads to mutable data and potential inconsistencies.</li><li>  Can hide underlying problems and make debugging difficult.</li><li>  Defeats the purpose of using  for type safety.</li><li><strong>Using mutable default values:</strong>  Can lead to unexpected behavior.</li><li><strong>Not validating input data:</strong>  Creates security vulnerabilities.</li><li><strong>Complex inheritance hierarchies:</strong>  Can make the code harder to understand and maintain.</li></ol><h3>\n  \n  \n  Best Practices &amp; Architecture\n</h3><ul><li>  Always use type hints and enforce static type checking.</li><li>  Keep  classes focused on data representation.</li><li>  Validate input data and handle potential errors gracefully.</li><li>  Break down complex systems into smaller, independent modules.</li><li>  Use a layered configuration approach to manage application settings.</li><li>  Use dependency injection to improve testability and maintainability.</li><li>  Automate testing, linting, and deployment.</li><li>  Use Docker or other containerization technologies to ensure reproducible builds.</li><li>  Document all  classes and their methods.</li></ul><p> is a powerful tool for building robust, scalable, and maintainable Python applications.  Mastering  requires understanding its architectural implications, performance characteristics, and security considerations.  Refactor legacy code to use , measure performance, write comprehensive tests, and enforce strict type checking.  The investment will pay off in the long run by reducing bugs, improving code quality, and increasing developer productivity.
