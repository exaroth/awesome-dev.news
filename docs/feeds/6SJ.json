No entanto, dependendo do contexto, o uso de regex pode ser menos eficiente do que alternativas mais simples. Em sistemas de alta performance, como os que lidam com grandes volumes de dados ou que precisam ser executados em ambientes com recursos limitados, √© importante considerar o impacto de cada escolha de implementa√ß√£o.</p><p>Embora regex seja uma ferramenta poderosa, sua utiliza√ß√£o indiscriminada pode resultar em impactos de performance, principalmente em Go, onde cada opera√ß√£o √© otimizada ao m√°ximo para garantir alta efici√™ncia. Neste post, vamos abordar um exemplo simples de valida√ß√£o de strings alfanum√©ricas, comparando o uso de regex com uma abordagem baseada em Unicode e explicando como otimizar o uso de regex no Go para obter melhores resultados.</p><p>O que acontece por tr√°s das cortinas: Regex vs Unicode\nA biblioteca  √© bastante √∫til, mas pode ser mais lenta do que valida√ß√µes feitas manualmente usando fun√ß√µes da biblioteca unicode. Isso ocorre porque o Go precisa compilar o regex e avaliar sua express√£o toda vez que √© usado dentro de um m√©todo. Isso consome mais tempo de CPU e mem√≥ria, especialmente em valida√ß√µes simples, como a checagem, se uma string cont√©m apenas caracteres alfanum√©ricos.</p><p>A alternativa, mais eficiente, √© iterar sobre a string e validar cada caractere individualmente, utilizando fun√ß√µes como unicode.IsLetter e unicode.IsDigit. Isso evita a sobrecarga de compilar o regex toda vez que a fun√ß√£o √© chamada e pode ser muito mais r√°pido para cen√°rios simples.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Exemplo pr√°tico: Comparando as abordagens\n</h2><p>Aqui est√° um exemplo em Go para comparar as duas abordagens: uma usando regex e outra utilizando Unicode diretamente.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><h3>\n  \n  \n  Implementa√ß√£o usando Unicode:\n</h3><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><h2>\n  \n  \n  Compara√ß√£o de Performance\n</h2><p>Vamos rodar alguns benchmarks para comparar a performance das duas abordagens.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Como voc√™ pode observar nos benchmarks acima, a vers√£o que usa Unicode √© significativamente mais r√°pida do que a vers√£o com regex. A vers√£o com Unicode realiza cerca de 18 milh√µes de opera√ß√µes por segundo, enquanto a vers√£o com regex realiza apenas cerca de 3 milh√µes.</p><p>Quando usamos regex, estamos criando e compilando uma express√£o regular toda vez que chamamos a fun√ß√£o. O processo de compila√ß√£o e execu√ß√£o da express√£o regular envolve mais passos do que simplesmente iterar sobre os caracteres da string com fun√ß√µes do unicode. Isso faz com que a execu√ß√£o com regex consuma mais tempo de CPU e mem√≥ria.</p><p>Isso n√£o significa que voc√™ deve parar de usar regex. Em casos mais complexos, onde voc√™ precisa de valida√ß√µes mais sofisticadas, regex pode ser a melhor escolha. No entanto, em valida√ß√µes simples, como a checagem de caracteres alfanum√©ricos, o uso de Unicode diretamente √© muito mais eficiente.</p><p>Dica de Performance: Compile Regex fora do m√©todo\nSe voc√™ optar por usar regex, uma boa pr√°tica √© compilar a express√£o regular fora do m√©todo, para que ela n√£o precise ser recompilada a cada chamada. Isso pode ajudar a reduzir o custo de performance de usar regex.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Ao compilar a express√£o regular uma vez e reutiliz√°-la, voc√™ reduz significativamente o impacto de performance.</p><p>Embora regex seja uma ferramenta poderosa e √∫til, seu uso em valida√ß√µes simples pode ser ineficiente, especialmente quando a performance √© uma prioridade. Em Go, alternativas como a utiliza√ß√£o da biblioteca unicode podem oferecer ganhos significativos de performance.

But we won't sit and configure our routers every time, we need a better solution.</p><p>But if we're not forwarding the port, then how can an external packet enter our private network without getting chocked by firewalls? </p><p>Here's where the concept of <a href=\"https://qbee.io/misc/reverse-ssh-tunneling-the-ultimate-guide/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Reverse Tunneling</a> comes into the picture. Reverse Tunneling is a technique used to establish a secure connection from a remote server back to a local machine. Portsicle beautifully manipulates this same technique to route traffic to local machine.</p><p>The idea is to have an intermediary remote (relay) server which will act as a bridge between local machine and the internet traffic. Anyone who wants to access someone's local server, will first visit to the remote server, which will then route the request to the local machine.</p><p>To achieve this, Portsicle provides a client CLI which connects to the remote server. The user can use the CLI command to initiate the tunnel. This means that the connection is now outbound (established by the local machine) and the firewall will just ignore it. This connection is then upgraded to a secure and persistent websocket tunnel.</p><p>Once a tunnel is established, the relay server provides a 'Public URL' for that session. Anyone on the internet can now access that particular local server with this public URL and the URL is only valid as long as the client is running along.</p><p>Steps to get the public url:</p><blockquote><p>note that 3000 has to be the port of the local server you wanted to expose.</p></blockquote><ul><li>You'll then receive the URL:\n</li></ul><div><pre><code>‚ùØ ./portsicle http -p 3000\n2025/02/23 00:26:33 Connected to remote server.\n2025/02/23 00:26:33 Your public url: https://portsicle.koyeb.app/a355bf62-f7c4-46e9-9d9b-1125d6343b3d\n</code></pre></div><p>Your local server is accessible with this link!</p><p>But how the traffic is \"forwarded\"??? Well, we simply convert the HTTP/HTTPS requests and responses into websocket messages and forward them between local client and the remote server.</p><p>We handle this forwarding for two cycles:</p><p>Take plain HTTP request =&gt; Convert it to a message object =&gt; send it across wire =&gt; reconstruct an HTTP request =&gt; send it to local server. </p><p>Client gets a response from local server =&gt; convert it to a response object =&gt; send it across wire =&gt; construct a response.  </p>","contentLength":2538,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"windows firewall for local Go web app","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1ivmbtd/windows_firewall_for_local_go_web_app/","date":1740241115,"author":"/u/jeevanism","guid":9298,"unread":true,"content":"<p>Every time I start my Go web app locally on Windows, I get a firewall error (see screenshot).

You define how you want your data to be structured once, then you can use special generated source code to easily write and read your structured data to and from a variety of data streams and using a variety of languages.‚Äù</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Comparison of Data Formats\n</h2><p>Suppose we have a  object, represented by JSON, XML, and Protobuf respectively, and let's see their differences.</p><div><pre><code>John24</code></pre></div><p>Protobuf directly represents data in binary format, which is not as intuitive as XML and JSON formats. For example:</p><div><pre><code>[10 6 69 108 108 122 111 116 16 24]\n</code></pre></div><h3>\n  \n  \n  Good Performance/High Efficiency\n</h3><ul><li>: The overhead of XML formatting (serialization) is acceptable, but the overhead of XML parsing (deserialization) is relatively large. Protobuf has optimized this aspect and can significantly reduce the time overhead of serialization and deserialization.</li><li>: Protobuf also greatly reduces the space occupation.</li></ul><h3>\n  \n  \n  Code Generation Mechanism\n</h3><p>For example, write the following content similar to a structure:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Protobuf can automatically generate the corresponding  file and  file, and encapsulate the operations on the structure  into a class.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Support for Backward Compatibility and Forward Compatibility\n</h3><p>When the client and the server use a protocol simultaneously, if the client adds a byte in the protocol, it will not affect the normal use of the client.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Support for Multiple Programming Languages\n</h3><p>In the source code officially released by Google, it includes support for multiple programming languages, such as:</p><ul></ul><h2>\n  \n  \n  Disadvantages of Protobuf\n</h2><h3>\n  \n  \n  Poor Readability Due to Binary Format\n</h3><p>To improve performance, Protobuf uses a binary format for encoding, which makes the data less readable and will affect the efficiency during the development and testing phase. However, under normal circumstances, Protobuf performs very reliably, and serious problems generally do not occur.</p><p>Generally, XML is self-descriptive, while the Protobuf format is not. It is a piece of binary format protocol content, and it is difficult to know its function without matching it with a pre-written structure.</p><p>Although Protobuf supports serialization and deserialization in multiple languages, it is not a universal transmission standard across platforms and languages. In scenarios of multi-platform message passing, its compatibility with other projects is not good, and corresponding adaptation and transformation work is often required. Compared with json and XML, its universality is slightly insufficient.</p><p>Proto message type files generally end with . In a  file, one or more message types can be defined.</p><p>The following is an example of defining a message type for a search query. The  at the beginning of the file is used to describe the version information. Currently, there are two versions of proto, proto2 and proto3.</p><p>Explicitly set the syntax format to proto3. If the  is not set, it defaults to proto2.  represents the content to be queried,  represents the page number of the query, and  represents the number of items per page.  must be located on the first line of the  file excluding comments and blank lines.</p><p>The following message contains 3 fields (, , ), and each field has a corresponding type, field name, and field number. The field type can be , , , or a composite type.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Each field in the message type needs to be defined with a unique number, and this number is used to identify the field in the binary data. Numbers in the range of [1,15] can be encoded and represented with one byte; in the range of [16,2047], they need to be encoded and represented with two bytes. Therefore, leaving the numbers within 15 for frequently occurring fields can save space. The minimum value of the number is 1, and the maximum value is 2^29 - 1 = 536870911. Numbers in the range of [19000, 19999] cannot be used because these numbers are used internally by the proto compiler. Similarly, other pre-reserved numbers cannot be used either.</p><p>Each field can be modified by  or . In the proto3 syntax, if the modification type is not specified, the default value is .</p><ul><li>: It means that the modified field appears at most once, that is, it appears 0 or 1 time.</li><li>: It means that the modified field can appear any number of times, including 0 times. In the proto3 syntax, fields modified by  use the  encoding by default.</li></ul><p>You can add comments to the  file. The comment syntax is the same as the C/C++ style, using  or .</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>When deleting or commenting out a field in a , other developers in the future may reuse the previous field number when updating the  definition. If they accidentally load the old version of the  file, it may lead to serious problems, such as data corruption. To avoid such problems, you can specify the reserved field numbers and field names. If someone uses these field numbers in the future, an error will be generated when compiling the proto, thus reminding that there is a problem with the proto.</p><p>Note: Do not mix the use of field names and field numbers for the same field.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><h3>\n  \n  \n  Mapping between Field Types and Language Types\n</h3><p>The defined  file can generate Go language code through a generator. For example, the Go file generated from the  file is the  file.</p><p>The mapping between basic types in proto and Go language types is shown in the following table (here only the type mapping between Go and C/C++ is listed, and for other languages, refer to <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/proto3):\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/proto3):</a>\n|.proto Type | Go Type | C++ Type |\n| double | float64 | double |<p>\n| float | float32 | float |</p>\n| int32 | int32 | int32 |<p>\n| int64 | int64 | int64 |</p>\n| uint32 | uint32 | uint32 |<p>\n| uint64 | uint64 | uint64 |</p>\n| sint32 | int32 | int32 |<p>\n| sint64 | int64 | int64 |</p>\n| fixed32 | uint32 | uint32 |<p>\n| fixed64 | uint64 | uint64 |</p>\n| sfixed32 | int32 | int32 |<p>\n| sfixed64 | int64 | int64 |</p>\n| bool | bool | bool |<p>\n| string | string | string |</p>\n| bytes | []byte | string |</p><div><table><tbody><tr></tr></tbody></table></div><p>When defining a message, if you want the value of a field to be only one of the expected values, you can use the enum type.</p><p>For example, now add the  field to , and its value can only be one of , , , , , , and . This can be achieved by adding an enum to the message definition and adding a constant for each possible enum value.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>The first constant of the  enum must be mapped to 0, and all enum definitions need to include a constant mapped to 0, and this value is the first line content of the enum definition. This is because 0 is used as the default value of the enum. In the proto2 syntax, the enum value on the first line is always the default value. For the sake of compatibility, the value 0 must be the first line of the definition.</p><p>Other  files can be imported in a  file, so as to use the message types defined in the imported file.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>By default, only the message types defined in the directly imported  file can be used. But sometimes it may be necessary to move the  file to a new location. At this time, a virtual  file can be placed in the old location, and the  syntax can be used to forward all imports to the new location, instead of directly moving the  file and updating all call points at once. Any place that imports a proto file containing the  statement can pass on the public dependencies of the imported dependencies.</p><p>For example, there are  and  files in the current folder, and  is imported in the  file, that is, the  file has the following content:</p><p>Suppose now we want to put the messages in  into the  file for use in other places. We can modify  and import  in it. Note that we need to use  because a single  can only use the messages defined in  and cannot use the message types in the proto file imported in .</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>When using  for compilation, the option  or  needs to be used to notify  where to find the imported files. If the search path is not specified,  will look for it in the current directory (the path where  is called).</p><p>Message types in the proto2 version can be imported into a proto3 file for use, and message types in the proto3 version can also be imported into a proto2 file. But the enum types in proto2 cannot be directly applied to the proto3 syntax.</p><p>Message types can be defined inside another message type, that is, nested definitions. For example, the  type is defined inside , and it supports multiple levels of nesting.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>When an outer message type uses a message inside another message, such as the  type using , it can use .</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Unknown fields are fields that the proto compiler cannot recognize. For example, when an old binary file parses the data sent by a new binary file with new fields, these new fields will become unknown fields in the old binary file. In the initial version of proto3, unknown fields were discarded when the message was parsed, but in version 3.5, the retention of unknown fields was reintroduced. Unknown fields are retained during parsing and are included in the serialized output.</p><p>The key to the high efficiency of Protobuf lies in its TLV (tag-length-value) encoding format. Each field has a unique  value as an identifier,  represents the length of the  data (for a  with a fixed length, there is no ), and  is the content of the data itself.</p><p>For the  value, it is composed of two parts:  and .  is the number given to each field in the  earlier, and  represents the type (fixed length or variable length). The  currently has 6 values from 0 to 5, and these 6 values can be represented by 3 bits.</p><p>The values of  are shown in the following table, where 3 and 4 have been deprecated, and we only need to pay attention to the remaining 4 types. For data encoded with Varint, there is no need to store the byte length , and at this time, the TLV encoding format degenerates into TV encoding. For 64-bit and 32-bit data, there is also no need for  because the  value already indicates whether the length is 8 bytes or 4 bytes.</p><div><table><thead><tr></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>int32 int64 uint32 uint64 bool enum</td></tr><tr></tr><tr></tr><tr><td>string bytes packed repeated fields embedded</td></tr><tr></tr><tr></tr><tr></tr></tbody></table></div><h3>\n  \n  \n  Varint Encoding Principle\n</h3><p>Varint is a variable-length int, which is a variable-length encoding method. It can make smaller numbers use fewer bytes to represent, and achieve data compression by reducing the number of bytes used to represent numbers. For an int32 type number, it usually requires 4 bytes to represent, but with Varint encoding, an int32 type number less than 128 can be represented with 1 byte. For larger numbers, it may require 5 bytes to represent, but in most messages, very large numbers usually do not appear, so using Varint encoding can use fewer bytes to represent numbers.</p><p>Varint is a variable-length encoding, and it distinguishes each field through the highest bit of each byte. If the highest bit of a byte is 1, it means that the subsequent byte is also part of the number; if it is 0, it means that this is the last byte, and the remaining 7 bits are all used to represent the number. Although each byte will waste 1 bit of space (that is, 1/8 = 12.5% waste), if there are many numbers that do not need to be fixed as 4 bytes for representation, a large amount of space can still be saved.</p><p>For example, for an int32 type number 65, its Varint encoding process is as follows, and the 65 that originally occupied 4 bytes only occupies 1 byte after encoding.</p><p>For an int32 type number 128, it occupies 2 bytes after encoding.</p><p>Varint decoding is the reverse process of encoding, which is relatively simple, and no example is given here.</p><p>numbers to unsigned numbers, and then use Varint encoding to reduce the number of bytes after encoding.</p><p>Zigzag uses unsigned numbers to represent signed numbers, enabling numbers with smaller absolute values to be represented with fewer bytes. Before understanding Zigzag encoding, let's first understand a few concepts:</p><ul><li>: The highest bit is the sign bit, and the remaining bits represent the absolute value.</li><li>: Except for the sign bit, invert the remaining bits of the original code one by one.</li><li>: For positive numbers, the two's complement is itself; for negative numbers, except for the sign bit, invert the remaining bits of the original code one by one and then add 1.</li></ul><p>Take the int32 type number -2 as an example, and its encoding process is as follows.</p><p>In summary, for negative numbers, perform arithmetic operations on their two's complement. For a number , if it is of the  type, perform the operation ; if it is of the  type, perform the operation . Through this operation, the negative number is changed to a positive number, and this process is Zigzag encoding. Finally, use Varint encoding.</p><p>Since Varint and Zigzag encoding can self-parse the content length, the length item can be omitted, and the TLV storage is simplified to TV storage, without the need for the  item.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Calculation Methods of tag and value Values\n</h3><p>The  stores the identification information and data type information of the field, that is,  (field data type) +  (identification number). The field number can be obtained through the , corresponding to the defined message field. The calculation formula is <code>tag = field_number&lt;&lt;3 | wire_type</code>, and then perform Varint encoding on it.</p><p>The  is the value of the message field after Varint and Zigzag encoding.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  string Encoding (continued)\n</h3><p>When the field type is the  type, the field value is encoded in UTF-8. For example, there is the following message definition:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>In the Go language, the sample code for encoding this message is as follows:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>The binary content after encoding is as follows:</p><div><pre><code>[10 14 67 104 105 110 97 228 184 173 144 155 189 228 120 186]\n</code></pre></div><p>Nested messages mean that the  is another field message. The outer message is stored using TLV storage, and its  is also a TLV storage structure. The schematic diagram of the entire encoding structure is as follows (it can be imagined as a tree structure, where the outer message is the root node, and the nested message inside it is used as a child node, and each node follows the TLV encoding rule):</p><ol><li>The outermost message has its corresponding ,  (if any), and .</li><li>When the  is a nested message, this nested message has its own independent ,  (if any), and .</li><li>By analogy, if there are nested messages within the nested message, continue to encode according to the TLV rule.</li></ol><h3>\n  \n  \n  repeated Fields with packed\n</h3><p>The fields modified by  can be with  or without it. For multiple field values of the same  field, their  values are all the same, that is, the data type and field sequence number are the same. If multiple  storages are used, there will be redundancy of the .</p><p>If  is set, the storage method of the  field will be optimized. That is, the same  is only stored once, and then the total length  of all values under the  field is added to form a  storage structure. This method can effectively compress the length of the serialized data and save transmission overhead. For example:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>In the above example, the  field does not use , and each  value will have independent  and  storage; while the  field uses , and the  will only be stored once, followed by the total length  of all  values, and then all  values are arranged in sequence. In this way, when the data volume is large, the  field using  can significantly reduce the space occupied by the data and the bandwidth consumption during transmission. </p><p>With its efficiency (in terms of size) and professionalism (professional types), Protobuf should have a higher coverage in the future data transmission field.</p><p>Finally, I would like to introduce to you the most suitable platform for deploying services: </p><h3>\n  \n  \n  1.

I decided to create a project from scratch using Go for the backend and Angular 19 for the frontend. The project is a service for managing feature flags, inspired by great existing solutions. My primary focus was on implementing the principles of Clean Architecture while also improving my SQL skills by working directly with PostgreSQL without an ORM.</p><p>The source code can be found here:</p><p>The idea was to create a dashboard where users can sign in and manage their projects, environments and flags. Then, project's specific flags can be retrieved by user's app using a public api. The first thing that i wasn't sure about is how to implement this public interaction in a secure way, we will dive into that later, but the idea was to create some sort of library that handle this communication using a public key.</p><p>For the dashboard, I aimed to create an intuitive and simple UI for basic operations like creating new projects and flags. My main goal was to clearly display the status of the flags in each environment. This was the initial sketch of the UI.</p><p>I also wanted to implement collaboration, allowing multiple users to access the same project. This necessitates the implementation of a role/permission system, where, for example, only the owner can delete a project.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  First step: Designing the database\n</h2><p>Let's dive into some technical details, starting with database design. I wanted to use a relational database, but at this stage, I didn‚Äôt really care which one to choose. So, as a first step, I started thinking about all the entities and the relationships between them:</p><ul><li>: a person that can sign up and have access to the dashboard</li><li>: represent a container of environment and flags</li><li>: each project can have one or more environments, this is useful for a real world project where multiple test environment can exist.</li><li>: represent a single feature that can be enabled or not</li></ul><p>I started creating many-to-many relationship between users and project, so we can easily implement collaboration as mentioned before.\nThe one-to-many relationship between  and  it's pretty straight forward as one project can have multiple environments.</p><p>Nothing special so far, but things started to get tricky when I encountered the flag table. </p><p>The first idea that came to mind was that each flag should be directly related to an environment. This seemed logical, given that we‚Äôre working in a multi-environment system where the end user needs to request flags for a specific environment. However, I quickly realized that this could introduce some introduce some complexities.</p><p>Imagine you're inside the dashboard for a specific project that has 3 environments (TEST, QA, PROD), and you want to create a new flag called 'dark_mode_experimental'. This means you would need to create 3 new rows in the  table, one for each environment. Then, if you want to update the flag name to 'dark_mode', you would need to update all the rows accordingly. The same applies if you want to delete a flag. Furthermore, if a project already has some flags and you want to add another environment (let's say 'DEV'), you would need to duplicate all the existing flags for this new environment, which can lead to increased complexity and potential maintenance issues.</p><p>The final solution is that flags belong to a project while maintaining a many-to-many relationship with environments through the  table. This table allows us to store the flag status for each specific environment. By doing so, we can easily manage flag updates and deletions without needing to duplicate or update rows across multiple environments.</p><p>What happens when a new environment is created within a project is quite simple: we just add a new row in the  table. The relations in the  table are not created immediately but only after a flag is updated. This ensures that we avoid unnecessary entries for environments where no flags have been modified yet. Once a flag is updated, the corresponding relation in the flag_environment table is established, allowing us to track the flag's status in the new environment. </p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Step two: Implementing Go backend\n</h2><p>As I mentioned, I'm more of a frontend person, but I have a strong interest in learning backend technologies. During my studies, I worked with several different languages, mostly C, Java, and Python. These are great languages, but I wanted to try something new. Recently, I heard a lot of positive things about Go, so I decided to give it a shot.</p><p>There are a couple of things I want to mention before diving into the code. My main goal here was to structure the code by following clean architecture principles. This approach helps ensure that the code remains modular, maintainable, and testable. Additionally, for handling data, I chose not to use any ORM because I believe that for a study project, writing raw SQL is more instructive and provides a deeper understanding of how data is managed at the database level.</p><p>Let's start with folder structure</p><p>In Go, it's common to have a folder called  that contains the entry point of the program, and a folder called  for all the application code. That's what I did ‚Äî I created two subfolders inside : one for the API version and one for the CLI version of the service.</p><p>There are some great articles about clean architecture, and the structure I implemented is quite standard, so I won't go into detail about what each folder represents. I just want to highlight some parts of the code that demonstrate how the principles are applied and how the different components interact with each other in the project.</p><p>As I mentioned, I'm new to the Go world and still getting familiar with the ecosystem. From what I've seen so far, there aren't any major frameworks like those in the .NET or Java ecosystems that handle dependency injection in such a clean way. Therefore, I decided to implement dependency injection in a very 'vanilla' way, without relying on any external frameworks. Here is an example</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>An interactor is a struct with some dependencies that has methods to fulfill some business use cases, e.g.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>There are several aspects that can be improved, such as error handling or using a factory to create entities. However, the key idea is that the 'Create Environment' use case is managed within this method, which does not rely on any concrete implementation.</p><p>In this project, I implemented anemic entities, which is not ideal. For example, all fields are public so they can be serialized using Go's standard library, although I'm not fully convinced this is the best approach.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>The infrastructure folder contains all the implementations related to external dependencies. In this case, it includes the repository implementation for PostgreSQL and the middleware used by the HTTP framework.</p><p>I decided to use PostgreSQL as the database for no particular reason (well, maybe because I already had a Docker image pulled). However, thanks to clean architecture, it's easy to swap the database by simply implementing a new repository that adheres to the same interface. For example:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>In this case, interfaces refer to the components that allow external systems to interact with the application. For a web API, this typically consists of a function that, for example, extracts request parameters or body data, creates a DTO, and calls the interactor.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><h4>\n  \n  \n  Authentication for the admin section\n</h4><p>When dealing with authentication in the real world, it's better to relay on well tested library to improve security. However this for this simple project i decided to implement a username and password authentication that works with JWT tokens from scratch, using this popular library 'github.com/golang-jwt/jwt/v5'.</p><h4>\n  \n  \n  Implementation of the \"public api\"\n</h4><p>To allow the end user to access flags for a certain environment, I decided to implement a public key pattern. Essentially, there is a public REST API protected by a middleware that checks for a specific header containing a key. If the key is valid, it grants read-only access to all the enabled flags for that environment. Even if the public key gets stolen, the impact is limited. Since it only grants read-only, the key cannot be used to modify any data or access sensitive information.</p><p>That's how i implemented the middleware</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Then in the route definition</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>To interact with the public API I wrote a simple typescript SDK that allow to easily communicate with the service. It provides basic caching and types, and can be used by any javascript app.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><h3>\n  \n  \n  Admin dashboard in Angular 19\n</h3><p>Once I completed the backend, I wanted to interact with my service through a comfortable UI. Angular 19 had just come out with stable signals and other cool features, so I decided to use it for the frontend. I didn‚Äôt want to spend too much time designing UI components, hence I decided to use a component library that provides pre-built, customizable components. This allowed me to focus more on the core functionality and user experience. The library i choose is <a href=\"https://taiga-ui.dev\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Taiga UI</a>.</p><p>The frontend is quite simple, a bit different from the initial sketch but it provides all the features i need.</p><p>List of user projects<a href=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Frb0w8emw1cc77mmswnh9.png\"><img src=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Frb0w8emw1cc77mmswnh9.png\" alt=\"Ui project list\" width=\"800\" height=\"477\"></a></p><p>An interesting feature I added consists of a section where you can test the payload of the public api for the environment.

These two keywords are closely related to defer. They are both built-in functions in the Go language and provide complementary functions.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  I. Basic Functions of panic and recover\n</h2><ul><li>: It can change the control flow of the program. After calling panic, the remaining code of the current function will be immediately stopped from execution, and the defer of the caller will be recursively executed in the current Goroutine.</li><li>: It can stop the program crash caused by panic. It is a function that can only take effect in defer. Calling it in other scopes will not have any effect.</li></ul><h2>\n  \n  \n  II. Phenomena When Using panic and recover\n</h2><h3>\n  \n  \n  (I) panic Only Triggers the defer of the Current Goroutine\n</h3><p>The following code demonstrates this phenomenon:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>The running result is as follows:</p><div><pre><code>$ go run main.go\nin goroutine\npanic:\n...\n</code></pre></div><p>When running this code, it will be found that the defer statement in the main function is not executed, and only the defer in the current Goroutine is executed. Because the runtime.deferproc corresponding to the defer keyword will associate the deferred call function with the Goroutine where the caller is located, so when the program crashes, only the deferred call function of the current Goroutine will be called.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  (II) recover Only Takes Effect When Called in defer\n</h3><p>The following code reflects this feature:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><div><pre><code>$ go run main.go\nin main\npanic: unknown err\ngoroutine 1 [running]:\nmain.main()\n ...\nexit status 2\n</code></pre></div><p>By carefully analyzing this process, it can be known that recover will only take effect when called after a panic occurs. However, in the above control flow, recover is called before panic, which does not meet the conditions for taking effect. Therefore, the recover keyword needs to be used in defer.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  (III) panic Allows Multiple Nested Calls in defer\n</h3><p>The following code shows how to call panic multiple times in a defer function:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>The running result is as follows:</p><div><pre><code>$ go run main.go\nin main\npanic: panic once\n  panic: panic again\n  panic: panic again and again\ngoroutine 1 [running]:\n...\nexit status 2\n</code></pre></div><p>From the output result of the above program, it can be determined that multiple calls to panic in the program will not affect the normal execution of the defer function. Therefore, it is generally safe to use defer for the finalization work.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  III. Data Structure of panic\n</h2><p>The panic keyword in the source code of the Go language is represented by the data structure runtime._panic. Every time panic is called, a data structure like the following will be created to store relevant information:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><ul><li>: It is a pointer to the parameter when defer is called.</li><li>: It is the parameter passed in when panic is called.</li><li>: It points to the earlier called runtime._panic structure.</li><li>: It indicates whether the current runtime._panic has been recovered by recover.</li><li>: It indicates whether the current panic has been forcibly terminated.</li></ul><p>From the link field in the data structure, it can be inferred that the panic function can be called continuously multiple times, and they can form a linked list through the link.</p><p>The three fields pc, sp, and goexit in the structure are all introduced to fix the problems brought by runtime.Goexit. runtime.Goexit can only end the Goroutine that calls this function without affecting other Goroutines. However, this function will be cancelled by the panic and recover in defer. The introduction of these three fields is to ensure that this function will definitely take effect.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  IV. Principle of Program Crash\n</h2><p>The compiler will convert the keyword panic into runtime.gopanic. The execution process of this function includes the following steps:</p><ol><li>Create a new runtime._panic and add it to the front of the _panic linked list of the Goroutine where it is located.</li><li>Continuously obtain runtime._defer from the _defer linked list of the current Goroutine in a loop and call runtime.reflectcall to run the deferred call function.</li><li>Call runtime.fatalpanic to abort the entire program.\n</li></ol><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>It should be noted that three relatively important parts of code are omitted in the above function:</p><ol><li>The code in the recover branch for restoring the program.</li><li>The code for optimizing the performance of the defer call through inlining.</li><li>The code for fixing the abnormal situation of runtime.Goexit.</li></ol><p>In version 1.14, the Go language solved the conflict between recursive panic and recover and runtime.Goexit through the submission of runtime: ensure that Goexit cannot be aborted by a recursive panic/recover.</p><p>runtime.fatalpanic implements a program crash that cannot be recovered. Before aborting the program, it will print out all the panic messages and the parameters passed in during the call through runtime.printpanics:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>After printing the crash message, it will call runtime.exit to exit the current program and return the error code 2. The normal exit of the program is also implemented through runtime.exit.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  V. Principle of Crash Recovery\n</h2><p>The compiler will convert the keyword recover into runtime.gorecover:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>The implementation of this function is very simple. If the current Goroutine has not called panic, then this function will directly return nil, which is also the reason why the crash recovery will fail when called in a non-defer. Under normal circumstances, it will modify the recovered field of runtime._panic, and the recovery of the program is handled by the runtime.gopanic function:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>The above code omits the inlining optimization of defer. It takes out the program counter pc and stack pointer sp from runtime._defer and calls the runtime.recovery function to trigger the scheduling of the Goroutine. Before the scheduling, it will prepare the sp, pc, and the return value of the function:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>When the defer keyword is called, the stack pointer sp and program counter pc at the time of the call have already been stored in the runtime._defer structure. The runtime.gogo function here will jump back to the position where the defer keyword was called.</p><p>runtime.recovery will set the return value of the function to 1 during the scheduling process. From the comments of runtime.deferproc, it can be found that when the return value of the runtime.deferproc function is 1, the code generated by the compiler will directly jump to before the return of the caller function and execute runtime.deferreturn:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>After jumping to the runtime.deferreturn function, the program has been recovered from the panic and executes the normal logic, and the runtime.gorecover function can also take out the arg parameter passed in when calling panic from the runtime._panic structure and return it to the caller.</p><p>Analyzing the crash and recovery process of the program is rather tricky, and the code is not particularly easy to understand. Here is a simple summary of the program crash and recovery process:</p><ol><li>The compiler is responsible for the work of converting keywords. It converts panic and recover into runtime.gopanic and runtime.gorecover respectively, converts defer into the runtime.deferproc function, and calls the runtime.deferreturn function at the end of the function that calls defer.</li><li>When encountering the runtime.gopanic method during the running process, it will successively take out the runtime._defer structure from the linked list of the Goroutine and execute it.</li><li>If runtime.gorecover is encountered when calling the deferred execution function, it will mark _panic.recovered as true and return the parameter of the panic.</li><li>After this call ends, runtime.gopanic will take out the program counter pc and stack pointer sp from the runtime._defer structure and call the runtime.recovery function to restore the program.</li><li>runtime.recovery will jump back to runtime.deferproc according to the passed-in pc and sp.</li><li>The code automatically generated by the compiler will find that the return value of runtime.deferproc is not 0. At this time, it will jump back to runtime.deferreturn and restore to the normal execution flow.</li><li>If runtime.gorecover is not encountered, it will traverse all the runtime._defer in turn, and finally call runtime.fatalpanic to abort the program, print the parameters of the panic, and return the error code 2.</li></ol><p>The analysis process involves a lot of knowledge at the underlying level of the language, and the source code is also relatively obscure to read. It is full of unconventional control flows, jumping back and forth through the program counter. However, it is still very helpful for understanding the execution flow of the program. </p><p>Finally, I would like to recommend the most suitable deployment platform: </p><h3>\n  \n  \n  1.

I encountered many challenges, especially with aspects like OverlayFS and networking.</p><p>My biggest issue in my first implementation was networking. It was really difficult to isolate the child container and set up its own bridged network.</p><p>To solve network isolation, you need to think clearly ü§î at this stage.</p><p>First, you need to create a bridge on the host with two virtual interfaces:</p><div><pre><code>The first interface remains on the host.\nThe second interface is moved to the child container ü´ô.\n</code></pre></div><p>The real challenge here is managing command signaling between the host and the child container.</p><p>In my approach, I will attempt to create a proof of concept implementation.\nUnderstanding Container Networking</p><p>When we create containers, one of the most crucial aspects is network isolation. Think of it like giving each container its own private network environment, complete with its own network interfaces, IP addresses, and routing rules. Let‚Äôs break down how we achieve this in our container implementation.\nThe Network Setup Process</p><ol><li>Creating the Network Namespace</li></ol><p>First, we create a separate network namespace for our container. This is like giving the container its own private networking room:</p><div><pre><code>const ContainerName = \"mycontainer\"\n\nfunc createNetworkNamespace(name string) error {\n    // Create directory for network namespaces\n    if err := os.MkdirAll(\"/var/run/netns\", 0755); err != nil {\n        return err\n    }\n\n    // Create the namespace file\n    nsFile := filepath.Join(\"/var/run/netns\", name)\n    fd, err := os.Create(nsFile)\n    if err != nil {\n        return err\n    }\n    fd.Close()\n\n    // Bind mount it to make it accessible\n    return syscall.Mount(\"/proc/self/ns/net\", nsFile, \"bind\", syscall.MS_BIND, \"\")\n}\n</code></pre></div><ol><li>Setting Up Virtual Network Interfaces</li></ol><p>We create a virtual network cable (veth pair) to connect our container to the host system:</p><div><pre><code>const (\n    VethHost      = \"veth0\"  // Host end of the cable\n    VethContainer = \"veth1\"  // Container end of the cable\n    ContainerIP   = \"10.0.0.2/24\"\n    HostIP        = \"10.0.0.1/24\"\n    Gateway       = \"10.0.0.1\"\n)\n</code></pre></div><p>The setup happens in two parts:\n1-On the host side:</p><div><pre><code>func setupHostNetwork(pid int) error {\n    // Create the virtual network cable (veth pair)\n    if err := exec.Command(\"ip\", \"link\", \"add\", VethHost, \"type\", \"veth\", \n        \"peer\", \"name\", VethContainer).Run(); err != nil {\n        return fmt.Errorf(\"failed to create veth pair: %v\", err)\n    }\n\n    // Move one end to the container\n    if err := exec.Command(\"ip\", \"link\", \"set\", VethContainer, \n        \"netns\", fmt.Sprintf(\"%d\", pid)).Run(); err != nil {\n        return fmt.Errorf(\"failed to move veth to container: %v\", err)\n    }\n\n    // Configure the host end\n    if err := exec.Command(\"ip\", \"link\", \"set\", VethHost, \"up\").Run(); err != nil {\n        return fmt.Errorf(\"failed to bring up host interface: %v\", err)\n    }\n    if err := exec.Command(\"ip\", \"addr\", \"add\", HostIP, \"dev\", VethHost).Run(); err != nil {\n        return fmt.Errorf(\"failed to assign IP to host interface: %v\", err)\n    }\n}\n</code></pre></div><p>2 ‚Äî Inside the container:</p><div><pre><code>func setupContainerNetwork() error {\n    // Enable the loopback interface\n    if err := exec.Command(\"ip\", \"link\", \"set\", \"lo\", \"up\").Run(); err != nil {\n        return fmt.Errorf(\"failed to bring up lo: %v\", err)\n    }\n\n    // Configure the container's network interface\n    if err := exec.Command(\"ip\", \"link\", \"set\", VethContainer, \"up\").Run(); err != nil {\n        return fmt.Errorf(\"failed to bring up veth: %v\", err)\n    }\n    if err := exec.Command(\"ip\", \"addr\", \"add\", ContainerIP, \n        \"dev\", VethContainer).Run(); err != nil {\n        return fmt.Errorf(\"failed to assign IP to veth: %v\", err)\n    }\n    if err := exec.Command(\"ip\", \"route\", \"add\", \"default\", \n        \"via\", Gateway).Run(); err != nil {\n        return fmt.Errorf(\"failed to add default route: %v\", err)\n    }\n}\n</code></pre></div><p>To allow our container to access the internet, we need to set up NAT (Network Address Translation) rules. This is like setting up a router for our container:</p><div><pre><code>func setupHostNetwork(pid int) error {\n    // Get the host's internet-connected interface\n    iface, err := getDefaultInterface()\n    if err != nil {\n        return fmt.Errorf(\"failed to get default interface: %v\", err)\n    }\n\n    // Set up NAT and forwarding rules\n    cmds := [][]string{\n        {\"sysctl\", \"-w\", \"net.ipv4.ip_forward=1\"},\n        {\"iptables\", \"-t\", \"nat\", \"-A\", \"POSTROUTING\", \n            \"-s\", \"10.0.0.0/24\", \"-o\", iface, \"-j\", \"MASQUERADE\"},\n        {\"iptables\", \"-A\", \"FORWARD\", \"-i\", iface, \n            \"-o\", VethHost, \"-j\", \"ACCEPT\"},\n        {\"iptables\", \"-A\", \"FORWARD\", \"-i\", VethHost, \n            \"-o\", iface, \"-j\", \"ACCEPT\"},\n    }\n\n    for _, cmd := range cmds {\n        if out, err := exec.Command(cmd[0], cmd[1:]...).CombinedOutput(); err != nil {\n            return fmt.Errorf(\"failed %v: %s\\n%s\", cmd, err, out)\n        }\n    }\n}\n</code></pre></div><p><strong>finally , Resource Cleanup</strong></p><p>One often overlooked but crucial aspect is cleaning up network resources when the container stops. Our implementation handles this through a ResourceManager:</p><div><pre><code>\ntype ResourceManager struct {\n    containerName string\n    vethHost      string\n    mounts        []string\n    namespaces    []string\n}\n\nfunc (rm *ResourceManager) cleanupNetwork() error {\n    // Clean up iptables rules\n    if err := rm.cleanupIptablesRules(); err != nil {\n        log.Printf(\"Warning: iptables cleanup failed: %v\", err)\n    }\n\n    // Remove the virtual network interface\n    if out, err := exec.Command(\"ip\", \"link\", \"delete\", \n        rm.vethHost).CombinedOutput(); err != nil {\n        log.Printf(\"Warning: failed to delete veth interface: %v (%s)\", err, out)\n    }\n\n    return nil\n}\n</code></pre></div><p>How It All Works Together</p><div><pre><code>When starting a container:\n\nCreate a new network namespace\nCreate virtual network interfaces (veth pair)\nConfigure IP addresses and routing\nSet up NAT for internet access\nMount necessary filesystems and set up devices\n</code></pre></div><p>2 .During container runtime:</p><div><pre><code>Container uses its virtual network interface for all network communication\nOutgoing traffic goes through NAT to reach the internet\nIncoming traffic is routed back to the container\n</code></pre></div><p>3 . When stopping a container:</p><div><pre><code>Clean up iptables rules\nRemove virtual interfaces\nUnmount network namespace\nRemove namespace files\n</code></pre></div><p>Common Issues and Debugging</p><p>When implementing container networking, you might encounter these common issues:</p><div><pre><code>DNS Resolution Problems\n\nOur implementation includes DNS setup:\n</code></pre></div><div><pre><code>// in most cases this will case error , still trying to solve it \nfunc setupDNS() error {\n    resolvHost := \"/etc/resolv.conf\"\n    resolvContainer := filepath.Join(RootFS, \"etc/resolv.conf\")\n    return syscall.Mount(resolvHost, resolvContainer, \"bind\", \n        syscall.MS_BIND|syscall.MS_RDONLY, \"\")\n}\n</code></pre></div><p>2.Network Interface Issues</p><div><pre><code>Always check interface status with ip link show\nVerify IP assignments with ip addr show\nCheck routing with ip route show\n</code></pre></div><div><pre><code>Verify iptables rules are correctly set\nCheck IP forwarding is enabled\nEnsure the host interface is up and working\n</code></pre></div><p>Our implementation includes several security features:</p><div><pre><code>Network Isolation\n\nEach container gets its own network namespace\nNetwork traffic is isolated between containers\n</code></pre></div><div><pre><code>Proper cleanup of network resources prevents resource leaks\nAutomatic cleanup on container exit\n</code></pre></div><p>This networking implementation provides a solid foundation for container isolation while maintaining internet connectivity.

In this tutorial, we‚Äôll guide you through the process of creating a minimal container using Go. The example code provided focuses on essential containerization concepts, including namespaces, chroot, and control groups (cgroups).</p><p>Before getting started, ensure you have the following installed:</p><div><pre><code>Go programming language: Install Go\nBasic understanding of Linux namespaces and control groups\n</code></pre></div><p>introduction\nSo what is Linux namespaces and control groups ?</p><p>Namespaces have been part of the Linux kernel since about 2002, and over time more tooling and namespace types have been added. Real container support was added to the Linux kernel only in 2013, however. This is what made namespaces really useful and brought them to the masses.</p><p>But what are namespaces exactly? Here‚Äôs a wordy definition from Wikipedia:</p><p>‚ÄúNamespaces are a feature of the Linux kernel that partitions kernel resources such that one set of processes sees one set of resources while another set of processes sees a different set of resources.‚Äù</p><p>In other words, the key feature of namespaces is that they isolate processes from each other. On a server where you are running many different services, isolating each service and its associated processes from other services means that there is a smaller blast radius for changes, as well as a smaller footprint for security‚Äërelated concerns. Mostly though, isolating services meets the architectural style of microservices as described by Martin Fowler.\nTypes of Namespaces</p><p>Within the Linux kernel, there are different types of namespaces. Each namespace has its own unique properties:</p><div><pre><code>A user namespace has its own set of user IDs and group IDs for assignment to processes. In particular, this means that a process can have root privilege within its user namespace without having it in other user namespaces.\nA process ID (PID) namespace assigns a set of PIDs to processes that are independent from the set of PIDs in other namespaces. The first process created in a new namespace has PID 1 and child processes are assigned subsequent PIDs. If a child process is created with its own PID namespace, it has PID 1 in that namespace as well as its PID in the parent process‚Äô namespace. See below for an example.\nA network namespace has an independent network stack: its own private routing table, set of IP addresses, socket listing, connection tracking table, firewall, and other network‚Äërelated resources.\nA mount namespace has an independent list of mount points seen by the processes in the namespace. This means that you can mount and unmount filesystems in a mount namespace without affecting the host filesystem.\nAn interprocess communication (IPC) namespace has its own IPC resources, for example POSIX message queues.\nA UNIX Time‚ÄëSharing (UTS) namespace allows a single system to appear to have different host and domain names to different processes.\n\nthe container are fast isolated environment , we will focus on this part many things are involved and my main goal is to Demystifying Containers\n\nassuming that you are on a linux machine (try Power shell Ubuntu image if you are on Windows :-)\n</code></pre></div><div><pre><code>host-machine $ id\n\nuid=1000(mohamed) gid=1000(mohamed) groups=1000(mohamed) context=unconfined_u:unconfined_r:unconfined_t:s0-s0:c0.c.1023\n</code></pre></div><p>Now I run the following unshare command to create a new namespace with its own user and PID namespaces. I map the root user to the new namespace (in other words, I have root privilege within the new namespace), mount a new proc filesystem, and fork my process (in this case, bash) in the newly created namespace.</p><p>unshare --user --pid --map-root-user --mount-proc --fork bash</p><p>Congratulation , you are in isolated name space and some how you are on\nisolated PID in same file system and same network , your entry point /bin/bash</p><p>The ps -ef command shows there are two processes running ‚Äì bash and the ps command itself ‚Äì and the id command confirms that I‚Äôm root in the new namespace (which is also indicated by the changed command prompt):</p><div><pre><code>root # ps -ef\nUID         PID     PPID  C STIME TTY        TIME CMD\nroot          1        0  0 14:46 pts/0  00:00:00 bash\nroot         15        1  0 14:46 pts/0  00:00:00 ps -ef\nroot # id\nuid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root) context=unconfined_u:unconfined_r:unconfined_t:s0-s0:c0.c.1023\n</code></pre></div><p><strong>Namespaces and Containers</strong></p><blockquote><p>Namespaces are one of the technologies that containers are built on, used to enforce segregation of resources. We‚Äôve shown how to create namespaces manually, but container runtimes like Docker, rkt, podman , runC , containerD , and many other container technology\n    one of most unique projects are <a href=\"https://katacontainers.io/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://katacontainers.io/</a> they claim that they are mix between container and VM‚Äôs .\nWhat Are cgroups?</p></blockquote><p>cgroups, or control groups, are a Linux kernel feature that enables the management and limitation of system resources like CPU, memory, and network bandwidth, among others. We can use cgroups to set limits on these resources and distribute them among different groups of processes.</p><p>cgroups have a hierarchical structure with root and child, each with resource limits set by controllers ‚Äî for example, a CPU controller for CPU time or a memory controller for memory.</p><p>We can use cgroups for various purposes, such as controlling resource usage in a multi-tenant environment, providing Quality of Service (QoS) guarantees, and running containers.</p><p>Cgroups provide the following features:</p><div><pre><code>Resource limits ‚Äî You can configure a cgroup to limit how much of a particular resource (memory or CPU, for example) a process can use.\nPrioritization ‚Äî You can control how much of a resource (CPU, disk, or network) a process can use compared to processes in another cgroup when there is resource contention.\nAccounting ‚Äî Resource limits are monitored and reported at the cgroup level.\nControl ‚Äî You can change the status (frozen, stopped, or restarted) of all processes in a cgroup with a single command.\n</code></pre></div><p>The following command creates a v1 cgroup (you can tell by pathname format) called foo and sets the memory limit for it to 50,000,000 bytes (50 MB).</p><div><pre><code>root # mkdir -p /sys/fs/cgroup/memory/foo\nroot # echo 50000000 &gt; /sys/fs/cgroup/memory/foo/memory.limit_in_bytes\n</code></pre></div><p>Now I can assign a process to the cgroup, thus imposing the cgroup‚Äôs memory limit on it.

This can be a powerful tool for creating isolated environments or \"chroot jails.\"\nHow Chroot Works:</p><div><pre><code>Setting a New Root Directory: When you execute the chroot system call or the chroot command in the shell, it changes the root directory for the process and its children. The new root directory becomes the / (root) directory for that process, isolating it from the actual root directory of the host system.\nIsolation: After the chroot operation, the process and its children can only access files and directories within the new root directory. They cannot access files outside this new root, providing a level of isolation and containment.\n</code></pre></div><div><pre><code>System Recovery: chroot is commonly used in system recovery scenarios. If your system becomes unbootable or experiences issues, you can boot from a live CD/USB, chroot into the broken system, and make necessary repairs without affecting the rest of the host system.\nEnvironment Isolation: Developers and system administrators may use chroot to create isolated environments for testing or building software. This is especially common in scenarios where different versions of libraries or dependencies are required.\nSecurity: Although chroot provides some level of isolation, it's not foolproof in terms of security. It was not designed as a security feature and should not be solely relied upon for containing malicious processes. Modern containerization technologies, like Docker, utilize more advanced mechanisms, such as Linux namespaces and cgroups, to provide stronger isolation.\n</code></pre></div><p>Consider the following example:</p><div><pre><code>\nmkdir mychroot\ncp -r /bin /lib /lib64 /usr /mychroot\nchroot /mychroot /bin/bash\n</code></pre></div><div><pre><code>We create a directory called mychroot and copy essential binaries and libraries into it.\nWe use chroot to change the root directory to /mychroot.\nAfter the chroot command, executing /bin/bash will run a Bash shell within the isolated environment.\n</code></pre></div><p>Keep in mind that chroot by itself does not provide complete isolation; it is often used in conjunction with other tools and techniques to create more secure and robust containerized environments.\nPrepare the Ubuntu Root Filesystem</p><p>now final this you will need before you start a filesystem .\nwe will use Docker to download Ubuntu filesystem</p><p>you will only need docker to download it , in your project root</p><div><pre><code>$ docker run -d --rm --name ubuntu_fs ubuntu:20.04 sleep 1000\n$ mkdir -p ./ubuntu_fs\n$ docker cp ubuntu_fs:/ ./ubuntu_fs\n$ docker stop ubuntu_fs\n</code></pre></div><p>now we have ubuntu_fs inside our project , inside your main package</p><div><pre><code>package main\n\nimport (\n \"io/ioutil\"\n \"log\"\n \"os\"\n \"os/exec\"\n \"path/filepath\"\n \"strconv\"\n \"syscall\"\n \"strings\"\n \"fmt\"\n \"github.com/vishvananda/netns\"\n\n)\n\n\n\nfunc main() {\n switch os.Args[1] {\n case \"run\":\n  run(os.Args[2:]...)\n case \"child\":\n  child(os.Args[2:]...)\n default:\n  log.Fatal(\"Unknown command.

This delicate equilibrium influences many of Go‚Äôs core features, including its approach to memory management and data structures. One standout example of this thoughtful design is the implementation of slice growth. Through this approach, Go ensures that slices expand seamlessly, optimizing both performance and memory usage without compromising ease of use.</p><p>In Go, a slice is a lightweight data structure that serves as a window into a contiguous block of memory where elements of a specific type are stored. At its core, a slice doesn‚Äôt directly contain the data itself but instead holds a pointer to an underlying array (know as the backing array.)</p><p>When the Go runtime creates a slice, as in this example, it constructs a small struct under the hood, defined in the runtime as :</p><div><pre> {\n\t unsafe.\n}</pre></div><p>The  type has the following fields:</p><ul><li> holds a pointer to the underlying array.</li><li> stores the number of elements in the slice.</li><li> stores the capacity of the array.</li></ul><p>The  type used for the  field is a generic pointer type that bypasses Go's type safety rules. Since the size of an array in Go is part of the type, the runtime uses  so it can replace the array with a larger one when needed.</p><p>The code in the example above creates a slice that has zero elements with a backing array that can hold 10 elements of type . We can later fill that array with elements by using the  function:</p><p>Here, we append a byte to the empty array represented by the unsigned 8-bit integer .</p><p>When appending elements to a slice, the Go runtime first checks whether the backing array has enough capacity to accommodate the new elements. If it does, the elements are simply added to the existing array. However, if the current array lacks sufficient space, the runtime allocates a larger backing array, copies the existing elements into it, and then appends the new elements.</p><div><pre>([], , )\n\n(, ) (, ) </pre></div><p>The capacity of the newly allocated array is determined by several factors, including the current array‚Äôs capacity, the type of elements it holds, and the number of new elements being appended. These factors influence how much the array grows, ensuring efficient memory usage while minimizing the need for frequent reallocations.</p><p>The runtime begins by attempting to double the existing capacity as the first step in determining the new array size:</p><div><pre></pre></div><p>If the total number of existing and newly appended elements exceeds the doubled capacity, the runtime sets the new capacity to match the required number of elements:</p><div><pre> {\n    \n}</pre></div><p>This ensures that the new capacity is larger than or equals to the number of elements after the appending operation.</p><div><pre>([], , )\n\n(, , , )\n\n.(()) </pre></div><p>In this example, the integer slice initially had a capacity of 1. After adding three elements, the runtime allocated a new backing array with a capacity of 3. This happened because doubling the original capacity (1 * 2) was insufficient to accommodate the new elements, prompting the runtime to adjust the capacity accordingly.</p><p>If doubling the capacity is sufficient, the runtime further evaluates whether allocating such a large array is efficient or merely a waste of memory.</p><p>For small slices, capacity less than 256, the runtime employs a simple doubling strategy (e.g., 2 to 4, 4 to 8, 8 to 16.) This makes sense for small workloads: doubling ensures plenty of headroom for future appends. However, as the slice‚Äôs capacity climbs into more than 256, or beyond, doubling becomes less practical. Doubling a capacity of, say, 10,000 to 20,000 allocates an extra 10,000 elements‚Äô worth of memory (potentially tens or hundreds of kilobytes, depending on the element size) which might sit unused for a long time.</p><p>To address this, the runtime adjusts its growth strategy for larger slices by reducing the growth factor gradually until it reaches 1.25. This slower growth means that if a slice already has a capacity of, say, 512, adding a few elements doesn‚Äôt balloon it to 1024; it might rise to 832 instead (a 62.5% increase). The key insight is that a larger slice can absorb more appends before hitting its capacity limit. For instance, a slice with a capacity of 512 has room for 512 more elements if empty, compared to just 8 for a capacity of 8. This naturally delays the need for reallocation.</p><p>This conservative approach aims to curb excessive memory usage. By growing incrementally rather than exponentially, the runtime avoids reserving vast swaths of memory that might remain idle, which is critical in applications handling large datasets or with limited resources (e.g., embedded systems). However, there‚Äôs a flip side: smaller growth steps mean the slice fills up sooner, triggering reallocation more often. Each reallocation involves CPU work (allocating memory, copying the existing elements, and updating the slice‚Äôs pointer) which can add up if appends are frequent.</p><p>The runtime‚Äôs strategy thus balances these two forces: memory footprint versus CPU overhead. It leans toward saving memory at the cost of potentially more frequent (but smaller) reallocations, betting that the trade-off pays off in most real-world scenarios where slices don‚Äôt grow indefinitely.</p><p>When determining how a slice should grow, the Go runtime takes into account the type of elements stored in the array, as this directly impacts memory allocation. On 64-bit systems, memory is generally allocated in chunks of 8 bytes. Any allocation that does not align with this rule is rounded up to the nearest multiple of 8 to ensure efficient memory usage and alignment.</p><p>Let's say we create a slice of bytes with capacity zero and then append an element to it:</p><div><pre>([], , )\n\n(, )\n\n.(()) </pre></div><p>After the growth, the capacity of the slice becomes 8 (8 bytes). If the element type was a 64-bit integer instead, the growth will increase the capacity to 1 (1 * 64 bits = 8 bytes):</p><div><pre>([], , )\n\n(, )\n\n.(()) </pre></div><p>If the element type was a 32-bit integer, the growth will increase the capacity to 2 (2 * 32 bits = 8 bytes):</p><div><pre>([], , )\n\n(, )\n\n.(()) </pre></div><p>The reason is that modern CPUs, particularly on 64-bit systems, operate most efficiently when data is aligned to their word size (the amount of data they can process in one cycle.) On a 64-bit system, the word size is 64 bits, or 8 bytes. If the runtime allocates, say, 5 bytes, the CPU  and masks off the unused portion. That means, allocating in 8-byte multiples ensures the entire chunk is usable without waste or extra work.</p><p>In addition, CPU caches fetch memory in 64-byte lines (8 words of 8 bytes each.) Multiples of 8 bytes fit neatly into these lines, reducing cache misses and improving locality when accessing sequential data, like a slice‚Äôs backing array.</p><p>In addition to the 8-byte chunk allocation rule, the Go runtime maintains a table of predefined constants to guide its memory allocation decisions. This table categorizes memory allocations into specific size classes, helping the runtime minimize fragmentation and efficiently reuse freed memory blocks.</p><p>The table looks like this:</p><div><pre>+---------+-------+\n| Class   | Value |\n+---------+-------+\n| Class  |      |\n| Class  |     |\n| Class  |     |\n| Class  |     |\n| Class  |     |\n| Class  |     |\n| Class  |     |\n| Class  |     |\n| Class  |    |\n| .     | .   |\n+---------+-------+</pre></div><p>This size class allocation table functions as an efficient lookup mechanism for managing memory allocation and deallocation. When a memory block belonging to a specific size class is freed, the runtime stores it in the table rather than immediately returning it to the operating system. Later, if a request is made for a memory block of the same size class, the system can quickly retrieve and reuse the previously freed block instead of performing an extensive search through physical memory to find a suitable allocation.</p><div><pre>+---------------------------------+\n|  Freed memory  size class X  |\n+---------------------------------+\n        ‚îÇ\n        ‚ñº\n+-------------------+  \n| Memory Block     |  &lt;-- Freed  (Stored in Table)\n+-------------------+  \n| Memory Block     |  &lt;-- Freed  (Stored in Table)\n+-------------------+  \n| Memory Block     |  &lt;-- Freed  (Stored in Table)\n+-------------------+  \n        ‚îÇ\n        ‚ñº\n+-------------------------------------+\n| Incoming Memory Allocation Request  |\n+-------------------------------------+\n        ‚îÇ\n          (Lookup in Table)\n+-------------------------------+\n| Matching Freed Block Found    |\n+-------------------------------+\n        ‚îÇ\n          (Reused Instead of )\n+----------------------------+\n|  Allocated to Application  |\n+----------------------------+</pre></div><p>With that in mind, the runtime not only rounds up to the nearest 8-byte boundary but also rounds up to the nearest size class in the allocation table.</p><p>Consider this slice operation:</p><div><pre>([], , )\n\n(, , , , , )</pre></div><p>Here, the slice starts with zero capacity and we add 5 elements of type . Without considering the size class allocation table, the runtime would allocate 40 bytes for the new backing array:</p><div><pre> *  bits =  bits /  =  bytes</pre></div><p>Instead, the runtime consults the class allocation table and rounds up to the nearest match (48 in this case). As a result, it allocates a backing array with a capacity of 6 (48 bytes / 64 bits), even though the new array would only need to hold 5 elements (that require only 40 bytes).</p><p>This approach significantly improves performance by reducing external fragmentation (where free memory is scattered in small, non-contiguous blocks, making larger allocations difficult.) It also minimizes allocation overhead and speeds up memory access by eliminating the need to repeatedly request new memory from the operating system.</p><p>In summary, the Go runtime takes several key factors into account when growing an array:</p><ol><li>: It starts with a doubling factor (2x) and then gradually winds down to 1.25x.</li><li>: The array is rounded up to the nearest 8-byte boundary.</li><li><strong>The Size Class Allocation Table</strong>: The runtime rounds up to the nearest available class in the table.</li></ol><p>I really admire the thoughtful work the Go team has put into making the language both efficient and flexible.

Sometimes, all you need is <strong>a simple way to query the database</strong> and retrieve structured JSON responses without going through the entire process of backend development.</p><p>That‚Äôs exactly why many years ago I built the ‚Äîa solution that allows developers to interact directly with <strong>PostgreSQL and MSSQL databases via a secure API</strong>, without writing a full-fledged backend.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  The Idea Behind Database Gateway API\n</h2><p>The goal was simple: <strong>Why should you have to build an entire backend when all you need is an API for your database?</strong></p><p>I needed a lightweight yet powerful solution that could:</p><ul><li><strong>Eliminate the need for a dedicated backend</strong> in simple applications.</li><li><strong>Enable mobile and web apps to access database data seamlessly.</strong></li><li><strong>Provide an easy way to deploy APIs</strong> for database interactions with minimal setup.</li><li><strong>Integrate with any existing system</strong>, whether it‚Äôs an enterprise  or a <strong>retail point-of-sale (POS) system</strong>.</li></ul><p>This led to the creation of the ‚Äîa framework-agnostic API layer that acts as a bridge between your database and applications.</p><p>The  is a standalone service that connects to your  or  database and <strong>exposes SQL queries as API endpoints</strong>. It takes care of request parsing, security, and response formatting, allowing you to focus on building your application instead of writing backend logic.</p><p>‚úÖ <strong>Direct SQL Query Execution:</strong> Supports SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE operations via API requests.<strong>Automatic JSON Responses:</strong> Converts database query results into well-structured JSON.<strong>Easy Integration with Mobile &amp; Web Apps:</strong> No need for a complex backend‚Äîjust plug it into your frontend. Set up role-based access, API keys, and rate limiting.<strong>Supports Complex Queries &amp; Joins:</strong> Fetch relational data easily, just like using SQL directly.<strong>Minimal Deployment Overhead:</strong> Run it as a standalone service or containerized in Docker.  </p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Real-World Impact: 29 Deployments &amp; 150+ Devices\n</h2><p>This API has been successfully deployed across , powering over , primarily in .

Whether it's tracking views for articles, videos, or products, most applications rely on a simple  column in their database tables. The challenge arises when you don‚Äôt want to go through the hassle of writing a separate API for each table that needs view tracking, while also ensuring that your system is secure from abuse like DoS (Denial of Service) attacks. This is the problem I encountered and the reason I created the  library.</p><p>In most applications, views are tracked in some form‚Äîwhether it‚Äôs for a blog post, a product listing, or even user profile pages. However, implementing a solution that is both scalable and secure can become cumbersome. You could go the route of writing custom APIs for each of these tables, but that‚Äôs time-consuming and doesn‚Äôt scale well. What if there was a way to track these views without rewriting APIs for every new table? What if there was a more efficient way to integrate this functionality into any app? That‚Äôs when I started working on .</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  The Need for a Unified Solution\n</h3><p>When building any system with views tracking, one of the critical concerns is ensuring that the view count remains authentic. In some cases, malicious users may attempt to artificially inflate the view count through repeated requests‚Äîthis is where preventing DOS (Denial of Service) type increments comes into play. Without a solid solution, your application becomes vulnerable to these types of attacks, undermining the integrity of your view count.</p><p>Thus, the idea for  was born. I wanted a way to seamlessly count organic views across any tables, regardless of the framework, while providing an easy-to-integrate middleware solution that prevents abusive increments. This library is designed to integrate with any Golang web framework, like , , or even basic , and is database-agnostic, supporting PostgreSQL seamlessly.</p><p>When you add  to your application, you can begin tracking views instantly‚Äîwithout having to write separate APIs for each table. Let‚Äôs say you have tables like  or , each with a  column. Instead of building an API specifically to increment the  each time a user views a page, you can use  to track this automatically.</p><p>Here‚Äôs how it works in practice:</p><p>In your database, you simply add the  column to your tables like so:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>The same goes for your other tables. No need for complicated queries or APIs‚Äîjust a simple column to track views. </p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Integrating Viewscount into Your Application\n</h3><p>The best part of  is that it‚Äôs designed to be . Whether you're using , , or even , you can easily integrate it into your application. Here‚Äôs how you can add it as middleware in :</p><p>First, you‚Äôll need to initialize the view tracker in your app:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Once you‚Äôve set up the middleware, you can add it to your routes. Here‚Äôs how you do it:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>This simple setup integrates the  library into your existing app. The middleware will automatically track views on the specified table and increment the  column as needed, while also providing protection against abuse.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  The Benefits of Viewscount\n</h3><ol><li>: With just a few lines of code, you can integrate view counting into any of your existing tables.</li><li>: The library is designed to work with any Golang web framework, making it easy to use in your project regardless of the stack.</li><li><strong>Prevention of DOS Attacks</strong>: By limiting rapid requests that could artificially inflate view counts,  ensures that the data remains reliable and accurate.</li><li>: No need for custom APIs or complex queries‚Äîjust use the library and track views automatically in real time.</li></ol><p> solves a common problem in application development: how to track views across tables securely and efficiently without having to build a separate API for each table. Its easy integration, ability to prevent DOS-style attacks, and framework-agnostic design make it a powerful tool for developers building modern Golang applications.</p><p>Feel free to contribute to the project and raise issues or suggestions via <a href=\"https://github.com/mikebionic/viewscount\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Viewscount GitHub</a>.
