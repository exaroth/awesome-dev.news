Data flows in smoothly, transformations happen like clockwork, and everything seems perfect. Then you check your cloud bill at the end of the month and realize your pipeline has been running 24/7, processing mostly empty queues during off-peak hours. Sound familiar?</p><p>This is where  come in — one of  most powerful features for managing long-running and streaming pipelines.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  The Problem: Infinite Pipelines in a Finite World\n</h3><p>Traditional batch pipelines have it easy. They process all available data and exit gracefully when done. But modern data engineering often involves:</p><ul><li> that continuously listen for new events</li><li> waiting for messages that might never come</li><li> that need to respond to sporadic triggers</li><li> that should adapt to business hours</li></ul><p>These pipelines don't naturally terminate. They run forever — or until something crashes, resources run out, or someone manually kills them. That's wasteful, expensive, and frankly, inelegant.</p><p>Termination Rules in ETLFunnel provide intelligent, configurable exit conditions for your pipelines. Think of them as the \"smart shutdown\" mechanism that knows when continuing is pointless or unproductive.</p><p>Instead of letting your pipeline run indefinitely, you define clear conditions for when it should gracefully exit:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>This simple rule says: \"Stop after processing 10,000 records OR after 5 minutes of no activity — whichever comes first.\"</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  The Four Pillars of Termination\n</h3><p>ETLFunnel gives you four powerful mechanisms to control pipeline termination:</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  1. MaxRecords: The Volume Limit\n</h3><p>Perfect for: Development, testing, sampling large datasets</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>: You're testing a new transformation on production data. Instead of processing millions of records, you sample the first 1,000 to verify everything works correctly.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  2. IdleTimeout: The Silence Detector\n</h3><p>Perfect for: Event-driven pipelines, off-peak optimization</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>: Your pipeline consumes from a message queue. During nights and weekends, new messages are rare. Why keep the pipeline running? If nothing arrives for 10 minutes, shut it down gracefully.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  3. MaxPipelineTime: The Duration Guard\n</h3><p>Perfect for: Cost control, scheduled batch windows</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>: You have a 2-hour processing window during off-peak hours. Regardless of how much data is available, the pipeline must complete within this window to avoid impacting other systems.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  4. UserDefinedCheckFunc: The Custom Logic\n</h3><p>Perfect for: Complex business rules, adaptive behavior</p><p>This is where termination rules become truly powerful. You can implement any custom logic based on pipeline state:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><h3>\n  \n  \n  Scenario 1: The Smart Streaming Consumer\n</h3><p>: You're consuming from Kafka topics that have variable message rates. During business hours, thousands of messages per second. At night, maybe one every few minutes.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>: Pipeline runs as long as data flows. If messages stop for 15 minutes, it shuts down gracefully. You can restart it with a scheduled trigger or when new data arrives. No more 24/7 execution for sporadic workloads.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Scenario 2: The Cost-Conscious Development Pipeline\n</h3><p>: Developers are testing pipeline changes against production-like data. Full dataset has 50 million records, but you only need to verify logic.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>: Each test run processes at most 5,000 records or runs for 10 minutes. Fast feedback, minimal compute costs.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Scenario 3: The Adaptive Business-Hours Pipeline\n</h3><p>: You process user activity events, but your users are primarily in US timezones. Running full capacity globally is wasteful.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>: During business hours, pipeline tolerates longer idle periods. Outside business hours, it shuts down quickly if activity drops.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Best Practices: Getting Termination Right\n</h3><h3>\n  \n  \n  1. Choose the Right CheckInterval\n</h3><p>The  determines how frequently your termination conditions are evaluated. It's a balance:</p><ul><li> (&lt; 5 seconds): Unnecessary overhead checking conditions constantly</li><li> (&gt; 1 minute): Slow to respond, pipeline may run longer than needed</li><li>: 10–30 seconds for most use cases\n</li></ul><div><pre><code>// For responsive termination\nCheckInterval: 10 * time.Second\n</code></pre></div><div><pre><code>// For lower overhead on stable pipelines\nCheckInterval: 30 * time.Second\n</code></pre></div><h3>\n  \n  \n  2. Always Log Termination Events\n</h3><p>Future you will thank present you for clear termination logging:</p><div><pre><code>checkProps.Logger.Info(\"Pipeline terminating\",\n    zap.String(\"reason\", \"idle timeout exceeded\"),\n    zap.Duration(\"idle_duration\", idleDuration),\n    zap.Uint64(\"total_processed\", checkProps.TotalMessages),\n    zap.Duration(\"total_runtime\", time.Since(checkProps.StartTime)),\n)\n</code></pre></div><h3>\n  \n  \n  3. Combine Multiple Conditions\n</h3><p>Don't rely on a single termination condition. Defense in depth:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><h3>\n  \n  \n  4. Test in Development First\n</h3><p>Termination logic can be tricky. Test with different scenarios:</p><ul><li>What happens if no data arrives?</li><li>What if data arrives continuously?</li><li>What if there are brief idle periods?</li></ul><p>Use aggressive limits in development:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><h3>\n  \n  \n  5. Monitor Termination Patterns\n</h3><p>Track why your pipelines terminate. If they're always hitting , maybe your processing is too slow. If they're always hitting , maybe your upstream data source has issues.</p><p>Termination Rules are your pipeline's exit strategy. They transform potentially runaway processes into well-behaved, cost-effective, and maintainable systems.</p><p>In a world where data never stops flowing, knowing when to stop processing is just as important as knowing how to process it. ETLFunnel's Termination Rules give you that control — simply, powerfully, and elegantly.</p><p>Your cloud bill will thank you. Your operations team will thank you. And you'll sleep better knowing your pipelines won't run forever.</p><p><strong><em>Ready to optimize your pipeline termination?</em></strong><em>Visit <a href=\"https://etlfunnel.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">etlfunnel.com</a> today to sign up for a free trial of our SaaS platform and transform your data engineering workflows.</em></p>","contentLength":5878,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"How to Data Engineer the ETLFunnel Way","url":"https://dev.to/vivekburman/how-to-data-engineer-the-etlfunnel-way-2g9d","date":1762013993,"author":"Vivek Burman","guid":324123,"unread":true,"content":"<p>In <a href=\"https://dev.to/vivekburman/how-to-data-engineer-the-etlfunnel-way-4pg7\">Part 1</a>, we covered <strong>idempotency, retries, and recovery</strong> — the foundational mechanisms that make pipelines resilient to failure.</p><p>In <a href=\"https://dev.to/vivekburman/how-to-data-engineer-the-etlfunnel-way-4k2g\">Part 2</a>, we explored  — how to scale ETL workloads intelligently based on available hardware and data volume.</p><p>But here's the critical question we haven't answered yet:</p><p><strong>When your pipeline runs successfully, how do you track what actually committed?</strong></p><p><strong>When it fails, where did the failures go, and how do you replay them?</strong></p><p>That's where  and  hooks come in — the twin pillars of pipeline observability and incident management.</p><p>You've built a robust ETL pipeline.

We’ll also walk through a sample Grafana dashboard for metrics visualization and spin up a second service to demonstrate end-to-end distributed tracing in action.</p><ul><li>Observability (Metrics, Tracing)</li></ul><p>Caching is an important part of scaling any service. It reduces database load and speeds up response times by storing frequently accessed data in a fast in-memory store. We’ll use Redis, the most popular in-memory key–value store, for this purpose.</p><p>Redis supports far more than simple caching — features like Pub/Sub messaging, geospatial queries, and time series are built in — but for this boilerplate, we’ll keep things focused on basic caching functions that can easily be extended later.</p><p>We start by updating our  with a new  struct:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Then we load it inside :</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Next, we’ll create  where our Redis implementation will live:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Here, we’ve followed the same modular pattern used across other components. We define a  interface that can be easily mocked in unit tests, and a concrete  struct implementing basic caching functions along with  for health checks and  for graceful shutdown. Finally, we provide a  constructor to instantiate the cache service cleanly.</p><p>Now we initialize our cache service in :</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>This setup ensures that Redis starts alongside our other dependencies and closes gracefully when the service shuts down.</p><p>To integrate caching into our application logic, we’ll update the  method. It will now first look for the user data in Redis before querying the database. If the record isn’t found in cache, it’s fetched from the database and then written back to Redis for subsequent requests.</p><p>Since we’ve added another dependency, we’ll extend the  constructor to accept the cache service:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Next, we update our gRPC server to pass the cache instance from :</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Finally, here’s how caching looks inside :</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Now, when you call the  RPC, the user data will come from Redis on the second request (after being cached during the first). The cache expires after one minute, after which a new request will repopulate it. You can also log cache hits/misses to observe behavior.</p><p>Since we added caching to , we’ll update our integration tests accordingly. To ensure realistic conditions, we’ll spin up a real Redis instance using Testcontainers. Let’s start by creating a helper function  in :</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>And then update the  test to include Redis:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>For this test, we only need to confirm that  behaves correctly — whether the data came from the database or cache isn’t important here. The goal is to ensure the service works seamlessly with both persistence and caching layers under test conditions.</p><p>Service monitoring is critical in production environments. Although gRPC includes a built-in health check protocol, it only exposes a single RPC endpoint. This makes it less flexible if you want to differentiate between basic service liveness and full readiness to serve traffic.</p><p>In this boilerplate, we’ll implement two simple REST endpoints —  and  — for clarity and flexibility.</p><p>We’ll start by defining a  in <code>internal/service/health.go</code>. This service will be used by our  endpoint to verify that all dependencies (like the database and cache) are healthy before declaring the service ready.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>The  method inside  validates the health of connected dependencies and returns their status, which we can later expose through our API.</p><p>Next, we’ll implement the REST handlers for  and  inside <code>internal/transports/http/server/handler/health.go</code>:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>The  handler simply returns  with an HTTP 200 — it’s only responsible for confirming that the service process is running.</p><p>The  handler, on the other hand, uses the  to confirm that all required dependencies (like the database and Redis) are operational.</p><p>Now, let’s wire up our HTTP server in <code>internal/transports/http/server/server.go</code>:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>This follows the same structure as our . We define both  (for custom listeners) and  (for normal TCP-based startup from configuration).</p><p>Next, update your configuration to fetch the HTTP server’s host and port from environment variables:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Finally, let’s initialize and start the HTTP server in :</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Once everything is wired up, we can test the endpoints locally with :</p><div><pre><code>curl localhost:4000/livez\n</code></pre></div><div><pre><code>curl localhost:4000/readyz\n</code></pre></div><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>With these two endpoints, you now have both basic and dependency-aware healthchecks that can be used by Kubernetes probes, load balancers, or monitoring tools.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Observability (Metrics + Tracing)\n</h2><p>In Part 1, we added structured logging to capture what’s happening inside our services. Logs are great for understanding what happened in a specific instance — but in a distributed system, we also need to understand how things behave and how requests flow across multiple services.</p><p>That’s where metrics and tracing come in.</p><ul><li> capture quantitative data about our services — like request counts, error rates, and latency. They’re lightweight, easy to visualize, and ideal for alerting and performance dashboards.</li><li> gives us a request-level view of our system — showing how a request moves between microservices and how much time is spent in each hop.</li></ul><p>Together, logging, metrics, and tracing give us full observability into our system’s behavior. In this part, we’ll implement metrics and tracing, then spin up Prometheus, Grafana, and Jaeger to see them in action.</p><p><a href=\"https://prometheus.io/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Prometheus</a> is a popular open-source monitoring system that scrapes metrics from your services, stores them as time-series data, and makes them queryable through PromQL. We'll use the official <a href=\"https://github.com/prometheus/client_golang\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">prometheus/client_golang</a> library to instrument our services and exposes metrics for scraping.</p><p>We’ll begin by creating a  inside <code>internal/observability/metrics/metrics.go</code>. This service will handle Prometheus setup, expose default metrics, and provide a simple way to register custom collectors.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>To keep metrics modular, we define a small  interface. Each component — like gRPC, HTTP, or Redis — can implement this interface to expose its own metrics while keeping code organized.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Next, we add gRPC-specific metrics inside a new  file. This includes counters and histograms for request counts, and latency — useful for tracking performance trends across gRPC calls.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>We then create a gRPC interceptor that automatically records these metrics for every incoming request. This way, we don’t need to manually instrument every handler — metrics are collected transparently as part of the request lifecycle.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>We then attach the interceptor to gRPC server via <code>grpc.ChainUnaryInterceptor</code>:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Once metrics are collected, we need a way for Prometheus to access them. We expose a  endpoint in our HTTP server, which Prometheus will scrape periodically.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Now Let's register metrics to HTTPServer in :</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Finally, we update our configuration to include a <code>METRICS_ENABLE_DEFAULT_METRICS</code> option. This flag lets us control whether we also expose Go’s built-in runtime metrics like garbage collection and goroutine counts — useful in production for monitoring resource usage.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>With this in place, our services now export rich, structured metrics that can be scraped by Prometheus and visualized in Grafana. These metrics will serve as the backbone for our dashboards and alerts once we deploy to production.</p><p>Tracing is the third pillar of observability, alongside metrics and logs. While metrics tell you how your system behaves overall, and logs describe what happened at a specific moment, tracing shows you how a request flows across services. It’s especially valuable in microservice architectures where a single client request might touch multiple services, databases, or queues before completing.</p><p>We’ll be using OpenTelemetry — a popular open-source standard for collecting distributed traces — and connect it with Jaeger for visualization. You can also integrate it later with other backends like Zipkin, Tempo, or AWS X-Ray if needed.</p><p>Let’s start by defining our  in <code>internal/observability/tracing/tracing.go</code>:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Next, we’ll update our configuration to include tracing settings such as service name and exporter in :</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Now that the config is ready, we can initialize the tracer in  so that every part of our application has access to it:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>To propagate trace context across service boundaries, we add a gRPC . This ensures that when a request comes into our service, it either starts a new trace or continues an existing one passed from another service:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>From now on, every gRPC call will automatically create a trace that’s sent to Jaeger.</p><p>Each trace is composed of multiple  — where a trace represents the entire journey of a request (for example, a user calling your API), and spans represent individual operations within that request (like “fetch user from DB” or “send email”).</p><p>To demonstrate this, let’s add spans to our  handler and the . Each span will capture the work done by that specific function, and together they’ll form a full picture of a single request’s flow through the system.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>When you look at the trace in Jaeger, you’ll see a clear chain of execution — the main request trace leading into the  span, which then calls into the  span.</p><p>The  method lets you attach useful context (like user IDs, order IDs, or error states) that can make debugging much easier when viewing a trace.</p><p>Context propagation here is critical — notice that we always pass  forward. This context carries the  created by our gRPC , ensuring that every downstream function and service is linked to the same request chain.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  End to End Observability in Action\n</h3><p>The boilerplate comes with a ready-to-use observability setup using Docker Compose, available in the <a href=\"https://github.com/SagarMaheshwary/go-microservice-boilerplate/tree/examples\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">examples</a> branch. If you want to follow along, clone the repo and switch to that branch.</p><p>We’ll first bring up our core application stack — which includes the service itself, PostgreSQL, and Redis:</p><p>Once the application is running, we can start the observability stack. This will spin up Grafana, Prometheus, and Jaeger — all preconfigured to work with our service.</p><div><pre><code>docker compose  docker-compose.observability.yml up\n</code></pre></div><p>Jaeger runs via the  image using its default in-memory storage to keep things lightweight and simple. Prometheus uses a basic scrape configuration that pulls metrics from our service’s  endpoint every eight seconds:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Grafana comes with a sample dashboard already wired up to Prometheus, showcasing the gRPC metrics we defined earlier. Open a browser and navigate to <a href=\"http://localhost:3000\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">http://localhost:3000</a> (default credentials are  / ).</p><p>The dashboard has four panels visualizing data from the  and <code>grpc_request_duration_seconds</code> metrics:</p><ul><li>Average gRPC Request Duration — time series</li><li>gRPC Request Latency (95th Percentile) — time series</li><li>gRPC Requests per Method — time series</li><li>Total gRPC Requests — counter/gauge</li></ul><p>This sample dashboard offers a quick glimpse into request throughput and latency trends — perfect for demonstration and local testing. In a real production environment, you’d typically design a more comprehensive dashboard tailored to your service’s specific KPIs, error rates, and resource utilization patterns.</p><p>Now that we’ve seen metrics in action, let’s turn to tracing. We already explored what a trace looks like for a single service, but the real power of tracing emerges when requests flow through multiple microservices. Distributed traces help you visualize the entire request path, pinpoint slow hops, and quickly identify where failures occur.</p><p>To demonstrate distributed tracing, let’s spin up a second instance of our service that will act as another microservice in the request chain. Clone the same repository inside your project directory, switch to the examples branch, and create an environment file:</p><div><pre><code>git clone https://github.com/SagarMaheshwary/go-microservice-boilerplate.git go-microservice-boilerplate2\ngo-microservice-boilerplate2\ngit checkout examples\n .env.example .env\n</code></pre></div><p>Now let’s add this new service to our main  file:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Next, open the  handler of our main service and replace it with the following code.\nThis is just for demonstration — in a real-world setup, you would create a dedicated client inside  and reuse it across the service instead of creating a new connection for every request (since gRPC clients are long-lived):</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><blockquote><p>Note: In the <code>internal/tracing/tracing.go</code> file, make sure to include <code>otel.SetTextMapPropagator(propagation.TraceContext{})</code>. This line is missing from the part-3 source, and without it, traces between multiple services won’t connect properly. You can use either the  or  branch, as both already include this fix.</p></blockquote><p>Now, let’s trigger a request from the first service, which will internally call the second service. We’ll use  for this:</p><div><pre><code>grpcurl  ./proto/hello_world/hello_world.proto  localhost:5000 hello_world.Greeter/SayHello\n</code></pre></div><p>Open Jaeger in your browser, and you should now see a  spanning across two services — one initiating the request, and the other handling it downstream:</p><p>Clicking into the trace reveals the chain of spans showing each step of the process:</p><p>This connected trace gives a clear view of how the request travels through the system — from the first service’s  call, to the gRPC client invocation, and finally to the second service’s  and its database lookup via .</p><p>And that wraps up our  section.\nWe’ve now covered all three pillars — logging, metrics, and tracing — giving you complete visibility into your services. With this setup, you can detect issues early, measure system health, and trace requests across microservices, building a solid foundation for a production-grade monitoring stack.</p><p>In this final part, we extended our microservice with Redis integration, health checks, and full observability using Prometheus metrics and OpenTelemetry tracing. We visualized key performance metrics in Grafana and explored distributed tracing with Jaeger — connecting multiple services to see how requests flow end-to-end.</p><p>With this, our Go Microservice Boilerplate series comes to a close. You now have a solid foundation that combines clean project structure, containerization, configuration management, database integration, service-to-service communication, and observability — everything you need to kickstart a production-grade Go microservice project.</p><p>You can use the <a href=\"https://github.com/SagarMaheshwary/go-microservice-boilerplate\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">master branch</a> of the repository as a ready-to-use boilerplate to start new projects, or explore the <a href=\"https://github.com/SagarMaheshwary/go-microservice-boilerplate/tree/examples\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">examples branch</a> to review all the code samples demonstrated throughout this series.</p><p>Thanks for following along — and happy building!</p>","contentLength":14843,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Reactive Tree Management in Nuxt 4: How I Modeled Complex Hierarchies with Pinia","url":"https://dev.to/smaug6739/reactive-tree-management-in-nuxt-4-how-i-modeled-complex-hierarchies-with-pinia-2m8f","date":1761999442,"author":"Smaug#6739","guid":324028,"unread":true,"content":"<p>When I started building Alexandrie, I just wanted a fast, offline Markdown note-taking app I could rely on daily.\nBut as the project grew — with nested categories, shared workspaces, and access permissions — it evolved into something much more: a open-source knowledge management platform powered by Nuxt 4 and Go.</p><p>This article walks through one of the toughest challenges I faced: how to model and manage hierarchical data efficiently, from the database to a reactive Pinia store.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  1. Unified Data Model: “Nodes” Over Multiple Tables\n</h2><p>Early in development, I realized that managing <strong>categories, documents, and files</strong> as separate entities was becoming painful.<p>\nEvery new feature — especially </p> and  — required deeper joins and complex recursive queries.</p><p>Here’s what the early structure looked like conceptually:</p><div><pre><code>Workspace\n ├── Category A\n │    ├── Document 1\n │    └── Document 2\n └── Category B\n      ├── Subcategory\n      │    └── Document 3\n</code></pre></div><h3>\n  \n  \n  1.1 The problem with separate tables\n</h3><p>Having multiple tables (, , ) worked fine until I introduced access control.<p>\nAt that point, even simple questions like “what can this user see in this subtree?” required multiple recursive joins.</p><p>\nPerformance and maintainability started to suffer.</p></p><h3>\n  \n  \n  1.2 The unified “nodes” approach\n</h3><p>The solution was to merge everything into a  — a unified model where everything is a .</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>With this model, every element — document, folder, file — became a node.\nThis made the hierarchy recursive but uniform, enabling simple queries like:</p><blockquote><p>“What can user X access in this subtree?”</p></blockquote><p>Now, permission propagation and tree traversal both use a single recursive CTE or indexed path column, drastically improving maintainability and speed.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  2. Scalable Permission System\n</h2><p>Building permissions on top of the nodes table required careful thought. I adopted a hybrid approach:</p><p>A separate permissions table maps , , .</p><p>On access checks, the system checks:</p><ul><li>If the user owns the target node</li><li>If a direct permission exists</li><li>If any ancestor node grants sufficient permission</li></ul><p>This balances fine-grained control and inheritance — users get access to everything under a node they’ve been granted permission for, without repeated recursive checks.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  3. Backend Stack: Go + REST + Modular Design\n</h2><p>Language &amp; framework: Go (Gin) — lightweight and performant for API endpoints.</p><ul><li>: Go (Gin) — for its simplicity, performance, and clean REST design.</li><li>: MySQL (or compatible) — raw SQL for critical queries like subtree retrieval.</li><li>: S3-compatible (MinIO, RustFS) — abstracted via a pluggable service for self-hosted setups.</li></ul><p>The API uses a flat structure (, , ) — simple, predictable, and easy to version.</p><p>I separated business logic from data access (DAO layer) to keep the backend maintainable and extensible.\nThis paid off when refactoring: new storage backends or permission engines can now be added with minimal changes.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  4. Frontend Architecture: Data management\n</h2><p>Surprisingly, the hardest part of building Alexandrie’s frontend wasn’t the UI — it was the data layer.\nRepresenting thousands of interlinked notes in a reactive, permission-aware tree required careful design.</p><p>In Alexandrie, .\nA node can be a workspace, category, document, or resource — and each can contain others.<p>\nThat means infinite nesting, partial hydration, and live updates when any part of the tree changes.</p></p><p>In Alexandrie, everything is a Node.\nEach node can be a workspace, category, document, or resource, and every node can contain others — effectively forming a tree structure that must remain reactive, searchable, and permission-aware across the app.</p><ul><li>Nested data: Users can nest documents/categories/resources infinitely deep.</li><li>Partial hydration: Nodes are often fetched lazily or shared publicly, so the store must handle both partial and fully-hydrated nodes.</li><li>Permission inheritance: Access rights propagate through parent nodes.</li><li>Real-time reactivity: Any node update must immediately reflect across trees, search results, and UI components.</li><li>Performance: Traversing large trees shouldn’t cause noticeable slowdowns.</li></ul><p>I built a dedicated Pinia store (useNodesStore) combined with a TreeStructure utility that keeps all nodes in a flat Collection (essentially a reactive Map), and reconstructs the hierarchical tree on demand.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Then, a dedicated  class handles building the actual trees efficiently:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><ul><li>O(1) access to any node via itemMap</li><li>Efficient subtree generation (only rebuild what’s needed)</li><li>A clean way to filter, search, or recompute derived data (tags, permissions, etc.)</li><li>Integration with Pinia’s reactivity: the entire graph updates live when a node changes.</li></ul><p>Here are some high-level takeaways:</p><ul><li><p>Unify your data model early. Splitting multiple tables will bite you when adding features like permissions and sharing.</p></li><li><p>Favor simplicity in API contracts. Flat endpoints scale better than deeply nested resource structures.</p></li><li><p>Design for extensibility, not just immediate features. Adding plugin-like syntax blocks or alternate storage later becomes much easier.</p></li></ul><p>Permissions and hierarchy are hard. Caching accessible node sets and flattening ancestors helps avoid recursive query bottlenecks. </p><h2>\n  \n  \n  What’s Next &amp; How to Contribute\n</h2><p>Alexandrie is open-source and welcomes contributors.

It didn’t promise “magic” frameworks or a hundred shortcuts.<p>\nIt just offered speed, simplicity, and structure — and that was exactly what I needed.</p></p><p>*\nGo was created at Google to solve a real problem:<p>\nLarge, complex systems that were getting slower and harder to maintain.</p></p><p>The goal was simple — create a language that’s easy to read, fast to run, and effortless to deploy.\nThat philosophy still shows in every line of Go code.</p><p>From its clean syntax to its built-in tools, everything feels designed for clarity and productivity.\nHere’s what makes it special 👇</p><p>*<em>⚡ 1. Simplicity That Doesn’t Sacrifice Power\n*</em>\nGo has no unnecessary complexity.<p>\nNo inheritance, no endless dependencies, and very little boilerplate.</p>\nIt’s a language that forces you to focus on solving the problem, not fighting the syntax.</p><div><pre><code>package main\nimport \"fmt\"\n\nfunc main() {\n    fmt.Println(\"Hello, Go!\")\n}\n</code></pre></div><p>That’s a complete Go program — no setup files, no configuration chaos.\nYou can compile it, run it, and deploy it in seconds.</p><p>This simplicity means fewer bugs, faster learning, and a smoother path from idea to execution.</p><p>*<em>🚀 2. Performance That Feels Effortless\n*</em>\nGo is a compiled language, so your code runs directly on the machine — not through an interpreter.<p>\nThat gives you C-like performance with Python-like ease of writing.</p></p><p>You don’t need to tweak garbage collection or write complex optimizations.\nGo handles performance gracefully while letting you focus on business logic.</p><p>For developers building APIs or scalable services, that’s a huge win.</p><p>*<em>🧵 3. Concurrency Made for Humans\n*</em>\nConcurrency (running multiple tasks at once) is where Go truly shines.<p>\nMost languages make it complicated — Go makes it beautifully simple.</p></p><p>With goroutines, you can run lightweight, concurrent tasks using just one keyword:</p><p>That’s it. No threads, no heavy setup.\nYou can serve thousands of simultaneous requests efficiently — perfect for modern web backends and microservices.</p><p>*<em>🧩 4. A Batteries-Included Standard Library\n*</em>\nGo doesn’t need a huge ecosystem to get started.<p>\nIts standard library already includes everything you need for real-world backend work:</p></p><p>JSON handling (encoding/json)</p><p>Testing (testing package)</p><p>That means less time hunting for third-party packages, and more time building actual software.</p><p>*<em>🌍 5. A Growing, Practical Community\n*</em>\nThe Go community is one of the most pragmatic developer spaces out there.<p>\nIt’s not about hype — it’s about real-world results.</p></p><p>From startups to giants like Google, Uber, and Docker, Go powers production systems at scale.\nYou’ll find endless tutorials, open-source projects, and helpful developers who care about clean, efficient code.</p><p>*\nI chose Go because it fits how I think:<p>\nI like to build things that work, scale, and make sense.</p></p><p>With Go, I spend less time debugging and more time creating.\nIt’s a language that rewards good habits — and punishes bad ones gently but effectively.</p><p>Every line of Go code teaches you something about clarity, structure, and performance.</p><p>*<em>💡 My Advice for New Developers\n*</em>\nIf you’re just starting out in backend development, here’s my honest advice 👇</p><p>Start simple. Don’t chase every new framework.</p><p>Build small projects — APIs, CLI tools, or simple web apps.</p><p>Read Go code.

Connecting to the broker\n</h3><p>Once a network connection to the broker is established (typically over TCP or WebSocket), the client must send a  packet to initiate a session.</p><p>The MQTT 5  packet contains essential information for establishing a connection between the client and broker:</p><p>\nA unique ID that identifies the client to the broker. If not provided, the broker may assign one automatically (when Clean Start is true).</p><p>\nA flag that determines whether the broker should start a fresh session or resume a previous one with stored state (subscriptions, queued messages, etc.).</p><p>\nA time interval (in seconds) that specifies how often the client must communicate with the broker. If no messages are exchanged within this period, the client sends a PINGREQ packet to maintain the connection. A value of 0 disables the keep-alive mechanism.</p><p>\nOptional username and password fields for broker authentication, controlled by their respective flags in the Connect Flags byte.</p><p>\nAn optional message that the broker will publish on behalf of the client if it disconnects ungracefully. This includes:</p><ul><li>: Where the message will be published</li><li>: The message content</li><li>: Quality of Service level (0, 1, or 2)</li><li>: Whether the message should be retained by the broker</li><li>: MQTT 5 specific properties for the Will message</li></ul><p><p>\nMQTT 5 introduces properties that provide additional metadata and capabilities, such as:</p></p><ul><li>Request/Response Information</li><li>User Properties (custom key-value pairs)</li></ul><p>These fields work together to establish a reliable, authenticated connection with appropriate session handling and failure recovery mechanisms.</p><p>Just like most MQTT control packets (e.g. PUBLISH, SUBSCRIBE, etc.), the CONNECT packet follows a general structure consisting of three sections:</p><ol></ol><p>The fixed header is present in every MQTT control packet.\nIt always starts with one byte representing the packet type and flags, followed by one or more bytes representing the remaining length.</p><div><table><tbody><tr><td>Control Packet Type and Flags</td><td>Bits 7–4 identify the packet type (e.g. 1 for CONNECT, 3 for PUBLISH). Bits 3–0 are reserved for flags specific to each packet type.</td></tr><tr><td>Encoded as a , it specifies the total number of bytes in the Variable Header and Payload.</td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>For example, the first byte of a CONNECT packet is always 0x10 (binary 0001 0000), where:</p><ol><li>Bits 7–4 (0001) = Packet type 1 → CONNECT</li><li>Bits 3–0 (0000) = Flags (must be 0 for CONNECT)</li></ol><p>The Remaining Length is simply the total of the variable header and payload sizes, encoded using the Variable Byte Integer function we wrote earlier.</p><p>As its name suggests, the variable header structure and content vary depending on the packet type.</p><p>For the CONNECT packet, the variable header has a well-defined structure that looks like this:</p><div><table><tbody><tr><td>Always . Identifies the protocol being used.</td></tr><tr><td>Indicates the protocol version. For MQTT 5.0, this value is .</td></tr><tr><td>Bit flags defining session behavior (e.g. ), Will Message options, and authentication fields (Username/Password).</td></tr><tr><td>Maximum time interval, in seconds, between control packets sent by the client.</td></tr><tr><td>Variable Byte Integer + Property List</td><td>MQTT 5 introduces properties that provide extensibility and optional connection parameters.</td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>\nThe Connect Flags byte contains multiple bit fields, each controlling a specific connection behavior. <p>\nThis is an efficient way to encode 8 Boolean values in just one byte instead of using 8 separate bytes.</p></p><p>Here’s the breakdown of each bit (from most significant to least):</p><div><table><tbody><tr><td>Set to 1 if a Username is present in the payload.</td></tr><tr><td>Set to 1 if a Password is present in the payload.</td></tr><tr><td>Set to 1 if the Will Message should be retained.</td></tr><tr><td>Quality of Service level for the Will Message (0–2).</td></tr><tr><td>Set to 1 if a Will Message is included.</td></tr><tr><td>If 1, the client starts a new session; if 0, it resumes the previous one.</td></tr><tr></tr></tbody></table></div><p>The Connect Flags are encoded using the following function</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>\nWe initialize an empty byte (), then for each flag that needs to be set, we use bitwise OR operations to set the appropriate bit to 1.</p><p>For example, if  is true, we need to set bit 2 (counting from 0, right to left). We OR the flags byte with  (binary ) to set this bit. The |= operator performs a bitwise OR and assigns the result back to flags.</p><p>For the Will QoS level (0-2), we use a left shift operation () to position the QoS value at bits 3-4. For instance, if willQoS is 2 (), shifting it left by 3 positions gives us  ().</p><p><strong>Encoding the Variable Header</strong></p><p>Now that we understand the structure, let's look at how to encode the complete variable header:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>MQTT 5 properties are encoded as:</p><ol><li>A Variable Byte Integer representing the total length of all properties</li><li>A sequence of property ID (byte) + property value pairs</li></ol><p>Each property has a unique identifier (e.g.,  for Session Expiry Interval,  for Receive Maximum).

Both languages promised safety, performance, and concurrency—the holy trinity C++ always dangled but never quite delivered. Both were built by engineers who wanted to escape the complexity of C and C++. Yet the more I used them, the more they felt like mirror images—facing the same problem but walking in opposite directions.</p><p>Go believes that complexity is the enemy. Its designers stripped the language down until only the essentials remained. Fewer features, fewer surprises, fewer excuses for unreadable code. Rust, on the other hand, embraces complexity when it can make the system safer. Ownership, lifetimes, borrowing—each concept exists to prevent entire categories of bugs before they happen.</p><p>Both are trying to answer the same question: <em>How can we write fast, reliable software without losing our sanity?</em> But where Go chooses trust and simplicity, Rust chooses control and guarantees. The contrast isn't just technical—it's philosophical.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  1. What Do We Mean by \"Safety\"?\n</h3><p>Before we go further, let's be precise about what \"safety\" means in this context. We're primarily talking about two things:</p><p> prevents crashes from use-after-free bugs, buffer overflows, dangling pointers, and accessing invalid memory. These bugs plague C and C++ and have caused countless security vulnerabilities.</p><p> prevents data races—when multiple threads access the same memory simultaneously and at least one is writing. Data races cause unpredictable behavior and are notoriously hard to debug.</p><p>Neither of these prevents logic bugs or business errors. Safety here means \"won't crash unexpectedly due to low-level memory or concurrency mistakes.\"</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  2. The Go Way: Simplicity as a Form of Safety\n</h3><p>In 2007, Google's infrastructure was held together by millions of lines of C++ and Java. The engineers were drowning in build times, dependency issues, and mental overhead. Go was born as a rebellion—a language that prioritized clarity over cleverness, and practicality over perfection.</p><p>Rob Pike once said that \"complexity is easy, simplicity is hard.\" Go's design embodies that paradox. It removes inheritance, generics (until recently), assertions, and even exceptions—not because they're useless, but because they often lead to confusion and misuse. Every decision reflects a kind of engineering humility: assume that the next person reading your code will be you, six months later.</p><p>Memory management in Go is automatic, handled by a garbage collector. Concurrency is simple to express through goroutines and channels. These abstractions make it easy to start, scale, and maintain software without deep knowledge of system internals.</p><p>Consider error handling. Where C++ has exceptions that can be thrown from anywhere, and Rust has Result types with extensive pattern matching, Go simply returns errors as values. If you ignore them, that's on you. The language trusts you to check them—or at least makes ignoring them a conscious choice.</p><p>Go's bet is that clear, simple code makes bugs easier to spot and fix. Not impossible to write, but easier to catch in code review, easier to debug in production. The safety net is social, not mathematical.</p><p>This philosophy has limits. Go can't prevent data races, nil pointer panics, or ignored errors. But for many teams, especially those building web services and cloud infrastructure, these trade-offs are acceptable. Development velocity often matters more than eliminating every possible crash.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  3. The Rust Way: Safety Through Precision\n</h3><p>If Go is the language of trust, Rust is the language of discipline. It doesn't assume that the programmer will do the right thing—it enforces it. Every variable, every reference, every lifetime must make its relationship to memory explicit. At first, this feels like fighting the compiler. But soon, it starts to feel like a partnership.</p><p>Rust's ownership and borrowing system is the foundation of its safety model. The compiler checks, at compile time, that no data is used after it's freed, that mutable and immutable references don't overlap, and that every resource has a single, clear owner. The result is software that is memory-safe without needing a garbage collector—and often faster than garbage-collected languages as a result.</p><p>When Rust code compiles, entire categories of crashes simply can't happen. Use-after-free? Impossible. Data races? Prevented by the type system. Null pointer dereferences? The type system makes them explicit. Logic bugs still happen, but the low-level footguns are gone.</p><p>Rust's async story—while powerful—adds its own complexity. The ecosystem is maturing, but combining async code with ownership rules creates a learning curve that even experienced developers find steep.</p><p>The trade-off is real: Rust requires more upfront investment. The learning curve is measured in weeks, not days. Initial development is slower as you satisfy the compiler's demands. But the payoff comes in production, where bugs that would have been runtime crashes in other languages simply don't exist.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  4. The Shared Goal: Reliable Software\n</h3><p>Despite their philosophical differences, Go and Rust were both born from the same frustration—software that breaks too easily and grows too messy too fast.</p><p>Go targets reliability through simplicity. It reduces the mental cost of understanding a system, making it easier to reason about, maintain, and share across teams. Rust targets reliability through correctness. It encodes guarantees that the compiler enforces, catching entire classes of bugs before they exist.</p><p>Go optimizes for development velocity—the time from idea to working code. Rust optimizes for correctness—the confidence that working code will keep working under stress.</p><p>Go thrives in backend systems, cloud services, and large team environments. Docker, Kubernetes, and most of the cloud-native ecosystem are written in Go. When you need to ship an API server or a CLI tool quickly, Go gets out of your way.</p><p>Rust shines in systems programming, performance-critical tools, and environments where crashes aren't an option. Browsers (Firefox's Servo components), operating systems (parts of Windows, Linux drivers), and game engines choose Rust when every millisecond and every byte of memory counts—and when runtime performance needs to match or exceed C++.</p><p>The choice between Go and Rust isn't just philosophical—it's practical. Here's a framework:</p><ul><li>Development velocity matters more than eliminating every possible bug</li><li>Onboarding needs to be fast (new developers productive in days)</li><li>The problem is I/O-bound rather than CPU-bound</li><li>Runtime crashes are annoying but not catastrophic</li><li>You're building services, APIs, or tooling where iteration speed is key</li></ul><ul><li>Memory or CPU performance is genuinely constrained</li><li>Correctness is critical (embedded systems, cryptography, kernels)</li><li>You're building a library that others will depend on</li><li>Crashes could mean security vulnerabilities or physical damage</li><li>You can afford the learning curve and slower initial development</li></ul><p>You don't have to choose just one. The best engineering teams use both—Go for the rapid iteration layers, Rust for the performance-critical core. They're complementary tools.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  6. The Developer Experience: Different Kinds of Pain\n</h3><p>The real difference isn't in what they prevent, but in  they make you suffer.</p><p>Go frustrates you by limiting what you can express. Want complex type hierarchies? Not available. Want to guarantee at compile time that a value isn't nil? Can't do it. The language forces you into simpler patterns, which feels restrictive until you realize how much easier it makes maintenance.</p><p>Rust frustrates you by making you prove everything. The borrow checker will reject patterns that would work fine in practice because it can't verify them statically. You'll rewrite working code to satisfy the compiler. This feels pedantic until you realize you're debugging far less in production.</p><p>This shapes culture. Go developers prize readability and pragmatism. Rust developers prize correctness and deep understanding. </p><h3>\n  \n  \n  7. Conclusion: Two Answers, One Question\n</h3><p>Go and Rust are both reactions to complexity. Go removes sharp edges by simplifying the knife. Rust polishes the blade until it can't cut you.</p><p>The choice isn't about right or wrong—it's about context. For most web services, APIs, and tools where iteration matters more than microseconds? Go's simplicity wins. For embedded systems, kernel modules, or anything where bugs could mean security breaches or physical damage? Rust's guarantees win.</p><p>Safety and simplicity aren't opposites. They're coordinates on the same map, and every developer chooses where to stand.</p>","contentLength":8693,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"My Journey to Becoming a Full Stack Developer","url":"https://dev.to/ahmed112/my-journey-to-becoming-a-full-stack-developer-483c","date":1761914720,"author":"Ahmed Alasser","guid":323579,"unread":true,"content":"<p>Hey, I’m Ahmed — My Journey to Becoming a Full Stack Developer\nHi everyone!

That’s where Operators and CRDs come in.</p><p>In this article, we’ll start from first principles — what Operators and CRDs are, how they play together — and then go step by step through the process of scaffolding, writing, and understanding the key “reconciliation loop” logic in Go. I’ll also share practical tips, design pitfalls, and trade-offs from real projects. Let’s go.</p><h2><strong>1. What are Operators and CRDs, and how do they interact?</strong></h2><h3><strong>Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs) — extending the Kubernetes API</strong></h3><p>At its core, a Custom Resource Definition (CRD) is a way to extend the Kubernetes API with your own new kinds (types).</p><ul><li><p>Kubernetes comes with built-in resource kinds: Pod, Deployment, Service, etc. Each of these has a spec (desired state) and status (observed state) and is served by the Kubernetes API server.</p></li><li><p>A CRD allows you to add a new kind — for example, MyApp, DatabaseCluster, Cache, MySQLBackup, etc. You define the schema (often via OpenAPI v3 validation), the group/version/kind, and Kubernetes will then allow clients to kubectl apply objects of that new kind (Custom Resources, CRs).</p></li><li><p>Once your CRD is installed, your cluster effectively “knows about” this new API surface.</p></li></ul><p>So CRD = schema + API registration (i.e. telling Kubernetes: “I have this new type, validate it, store it, serve it”).</p><p>But a CRD by itself only gives you a data model — it does nothing automatically. You still need logic to act when CRs are created, updated, or deleted.</p><h3><strong>Operators — controllers with domain logic</strong></h3><p>An Operator is the piece that makes your CRD useful. It is (in practice) a Kubernetes controller (a client of the Kubernetes API) that:</p><ul><li><p>Watches events on your custom resources (CRs),</p></li><li><p>Compares the desired state (in spec) with the current state of the world,</p></li><li><p>And takes actions (create/update/delete Kubernetes primitives or external resources) so as to converge the system toward the desired state.</p></li></ul><p>Thus, an Operator combines two parts:</p><ul><li><p>CRD — defines the “language” (what attributes the user can express).</p></li><li><p>Controller / Reconciler logic — the “brain” that watches for changes and enforces them.</p></li></ul><p>The Operator pattern is essentially: “Let me treat my application (or cluster component) as a first-class Kubernetes object; the operator will drive its lifecycle.” </p><p>When you write an operator, you typically own the CRD (i.e. your operator is the canonical manager for that CRD). You register the CRD, and then inside the operator you write logic to reconcile every instance of the CRD.</p><p>In operation, things go as follows:</p><ul><li>A user (or system) kubectl applys a CR of kind Foo (that your CRD defines).</li><li>The Kubernetes API server stores that CR object (desired state).</li><li>Your operator’s controller sees that new CR (via watch/informer) and triggers a reconcile.</li><li>In Reconcile(), your code reads the CR, checks/subscribes to or reads existing resources (e.g. Deployments, Services, ConfigMaps), and if things are missing or wrong, issues requests to the API (create/update/delete) to align them.</li><li>Over time, through repeated reconciliation, the “actual” cluster state is made to match what the CR requests (ideally).</li><li>Optionally, the operator updates the CR’s status subfield to reflect progress, health, or conditions.</li></ul><p>One way to think: Kubernetes built-in controllers reconcile built-in kinds (e.g. Deployment reconciles Pods). Your operator reconciles CR kinds into a set of built-in or other CRs that in turn get reconciled.</p><p>Hence, CRD + Operator = your extension to Kubernetes behavior — you teach Kubernetes to “understand” your domain.</p><h2><strong>2. Why use this pattern? Benefits and challenges</strong></h2><p>Using CRDs + Operators yields several compelling benefits:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Declarative, consistent API</strong>\nUsers express what they want (via CRD spec) and the operator handles how to realize it. That hides complexity and reduces human error.</p></li><li><p><strong>Day-2 operations automation</strong>\nBeyond initial deploy (Day 1), operators allow you to automate upgrades, backups, schema migrations, health checks, scaling, rolling restarts, etc.</p></li></ul><p>You codify your “operational knowledge” and embed it. </p><ul><li><p><strong>Self-healing and drift correction</strong>\nIf someone manually fiddles with resources (e.g. deletes a Pod, modifies a configmap), the operator’s reconciliation loop can detect drift and restore the correct state. </p></li><li><p><strong>Domain-aware orchestration</strong>\nThe operator can understand ordering, dependencies, constraints (e.g. start DB, wait, then migrate), and enforce complex workflows, something flat YAML can’t do reliably.</p></li><li><p><strong>Simplified user experience</strong>\nFor many users, deploying your app becomes kubectl apply -f myapp.yaml. Under the hood, the operator installs all the needed services, handles upgrades, etc. They don’t need to know all the Kubernetes primitives. </p></li><li><p><strong>Extensibility and composability</strong>\nYou can build operators that interact (watching CRs of other operators), build meta-operators, or chain behavior modularly (though this comes with trade-offs). </p></li></ul><h3><strong>Challenges, pitfalls, and caveats</strong></h3><p>With power comes responsibility. Here are key challenges and trade-offs:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Correctness &amp; idempotency</strong>\nThe reconciliation logic must be idempotent — running multiple times should not break things or cause oscillations. Mistakes here lead to thrashing, resource conflicts, or stuck states. </p></li><li><p>\nAs your domain logic grows (multiple subcomponents, version upgrades, backward compatibility), the operator code can become complex. Structuring it carefully is vital.</p></li><li><p><strong>Testing and observability burden</strong>\nYou need solid tests (unit, integration) for reconcile logic, error paths, race conditions. Also, need metrics, logs, tracing, health checks, leader election, etc., to operate in a production cluster.</p></li><li><p><strong>Upgrade path and API versioning</strong>\nAs your CRD evolves, you’ll need to support version migrations (v1alpha → v1beta → v1), conversion, deprecation. Mistakes here can break existing installations.</p></li><li><p><strong>Handling external systems/side effects</strong>\nIf your operator talks to external databases, cloud APIs, or non-Kubernetes systems, you must manage eventual consistency, network failures, retries, backoff. Reconcile loop can’t block indefinitely.</p></li><li><p><strong>Race conditions, concurrency, and resource ownership</strong>\nYou must ensure controllers don’t step on each other’s toes. For example, two operators managing the same CR kind is discouraged. </p></li></ul><p>Handling concurrent reconcile loops safely, avoiding duplicate work, and reconciling in correct order adds complexity. </p><ul><li><p><strong>Operator’s resource consumption &amp; scale</strong>\nIf there are many CR instances or many events, the operator must scale (e.g. concurrency, rate limiting). Also be careful to avoid large list operations in every reconcile.</p></li><li><p><strong>Drift vs manual override tension</strong>\nSometimes users want to override something (tweak a configmap child directly). Operator may override that on next reconcile. You may need “ignore diff” or “do not manage this field” features. </p></li><li><p><strong>Garbage collection/eletion semantics</strong>\nWhen a CR is deleted, your operator should clean up owned resources in the right order (especially if there are dependencies). Use ownerReferences and finalizers carefully.</p></li></ul><p>3## <strong>. Scaffolding CRDs/Operators easily: Kubebuilder and friends</strong></p><p>You don’t have to start from scratch. Tools like Kubebuilder, Operator SDK, or controller-runtime scaffolding greatly reduce boilerplate and help you follow best practices.</p><p>Here’s a walkthrough of how you’d use Kubebuilder to scaffold your operator + CRD.</p><h3><strong>Getting started with Kubebuilder</strong></h3><p>(These are high-level steps; for full detail see the Kubebuilder Book) </p><ul><li><p>\nDownload appropriate binaries and put in your PATH.</p></li></ul><div><pre><code>kubebuilder init  your.domain  github.com/you/your-operator\n</code></pre></div><p>This sets up the project scaffolding: main.go, API directory, controller directory, etc.</p><ul><li><strong>Create API + Controller scaffold</strong></li></ul><div><pre><code>kubebuilder create api  &lt;group&gt;  &lt;version&gt;  &lt;KindName&gt;\n</code></pre></div><ul><li>api/vX/KindName_types.go (where you define Spec and Status)</li><li>api/vX/KindName_webhook.go (if validation/defaulting is enabled)</li><li>controllers/KindName_controller.go with a stub Reconcile() and SetupWithManager()</li><li>Sample manifest YAMLs under config/samples/</li><li><p>CRD YAML generation logic under config/crd</p></li><li><p><strong>Edit Spec/Status &amp; markers</strong>\nIn *_types.go, you annotate fields with markers (// +kubebuilder:validation: etc.) for CRD schema validation, default values, optional fields, etc.</p></li><li><p><strong>Implement Reconcile logic</strong>\nIn the controller stub, replace the generated TODO code with your actual logic.</p></li><li><p>\nIn SetupWithManager(), you wire which resources your controller watches (the primary resource and any secondary ones). E.g.:</p></li></ul><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>This ensures your reconcile loop is triggered when CR changes or when owned resources change.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Generate CRD manifests/controllers</strong>\nUse make manifests or make install depending on your scaffold to generate CRD YAMLs (which include your validation markers).</p></li><li><p>\nYou build the operator binary (often containerize it), install the CRD in a cluster, deploy the operator, then apply sample CR YAMLs (from config/samples) and see the behavior.</p></li></ul><p>Kubebuilder (and controller-runtime) handles much of the plumbing: caching, informers, client libraries, leader election, default reconcile loop wiring, etc.</p><p>Pros of using Kubebuilder:</p><ul><li>You start with solid boilerplate following best practices.</li><li>You get validation/defaulting support, CRD schema generation, versioning support.</li><li>It standardizes how your operator is structured, which helps maintainability.</li></ul><ul><li>The scaffold may not exactly match your domain logic — you’ll adapt.</li><li>For highly custom behavior (multi-CR operators, cross-CR relationships), you’ll need to extend the scaffold.</li><li>Learning the marker syntax, imports, API versioning, etc., has a learning curve.</li></ul><p>Once your operator grows, you may want to break large reconcile logic into well-modular domain services, state machines, or sub-reconcilers.</p><h2><strong>4. Writing your own operator in Go — the Reconciliation Loop in action</strong></h2><p>Let’s walk through a simplified example operator in Go, focusing on the reconcile loop mechanics. I’ll highlight key patterns and pitfalls.</p><p>The skeleton: controller and reconcile stub</p><p>After scaffolding, you’ll have something like:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Let’s break it down and dive into nuances.</p><h2><strong>Step-by-step logic and patterns</strong></h2><p>99(a) Fetch the custom resource**</p><p>This is your starting point. If the CR is not found (deleted), often you simply exit (the ownerReferences + finalizers may handle cleanup).</p><p>But note: your reconcile should handle stale events — e.g. events where the CR was deleted before your code saw it. So check IsNotFound carefully.</p><p><strong>(b) Observe existing “child” or managed resources</strong></p><p>You might next issue a Get or List to find related resources (Deployments, StatefulSets, Services, Secrets) that you manage and should reflect the CR’s desired spec.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>If found, you compare fields (replica count, container image, env vars, etc.) with what your my.Spec asks for. If differences, you update. Use r.Update.</p><p>When creating child resources, use controllerutil.SetControllerReference(&amp;my, child, r.Scheme) so that Kubernetes understands the CR “owns” that child. That enables garbage collection: when the CR is deleted, its owned children go away, too.</p><p>This also enables watch events (when child changes) to trigger your reconcile function. </p><p>Your code should consider “if exists and is correct, do nothing.” Don’t blindly issue updates unless needed. This avoids infinite loops, API flapping, etc.</p><p>Also, your code should gracefully handle partial failures (e.g. child creation succeeded, but status update fails). Ensure no inconsistent state or repeated destructive loops.</p><p><strong>(e) Status subresource updates</strong></p><p>Often you want to update my.Status to reflect progress, conditions, readiness, errors, etc. For example:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Use r.Status() so it updates only status, not spec. Be cautious about infinite loops: status update is itself an update event, triggering another reconcile.</p><p>Your Reconcile returns two values: ctrl.Result and error. The combination dictates what happens next:</p><ul><li>return ctrl.Result{}, nil → done, no immediate requeue</li><li>return ctrl.Result{Requeue: true}, nil → immediately requeue</li><li>return ctrl.Result{RequeueAfter: time.Duration}, nil → requeue after the given delay</li><li>return ctrl.Result{}, err → error, so the runtime may retry with backoff</li></ul><p>You use requeue when you know further work is needed after a delay (e.g. waiting for a child to settle). The scaffolding often sets a “syncPeriod” default (e.g. 10 hours) so even in absence of events, reconciles run periodically. \nStack Overflow</p><p>Also, your code should not block indefinitely — reconcilers must return rather than wait on long blocking operations.</p><p><strong>(g) Concurrent reconciles &amp; safety</strong></p><p>Controller-runtime supports concurrent reconciliation of different objects (via MaxConcurrentReconciles) allowing your operator to scale. </p><p>However, never attempt to reconcile the same object concurrently — runtime ensures that your reconciler gets serialized per object key. But you should be careful about cross-object state (e.g. two CRs manipulating the same shared resource).</p><p><strong>(h) Watch other resources, not just primary CR</strong></p><p>Often you’ll want to watch secondary or external resources (e.g. ConfigMaps, Secrets, other CRs). You map events on them to reconcile your CRs (via .Owns(...), .Watches(...) in SetupWithManager).</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Thus, if a Secret changes, you can trigger reconciliation of relevant CR(s).</p><p><strong>Example: Memcached operator (minimal)</strong></p><p>Kubebuilder’s example is Memcached: user supplies size: N in the CR, the operator ensures a Deployment with N replicas of memcached is running. </p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>This simple example illustrates the core pattern. You can expand it to include scaling, backups, upgrades, etc.</p><h2><strong>The reconciliation loop in practice</strong></h2><p>The reconciliation loop is the heart of your operator. It is:</p><ul><li>Event-driven (via watches)</li><li>Stateful-agnostic (reconcile must handle all states)</li><li>Idempotent (safe to run multiple times)</li><li>Non-blocking (each call should complete quickly)</li><li>Triggers further reconciles by requeue or watching owned resources</li></ul><p>As Kubernetes operators are merely controllers in user space, they plug into the control plane’s reconciliation machinery. When the controller-runtime manager runs, it registers your controller, and each time an event (create/update/delete) happens on watched resources, the manager enqueues a reconcile Request, which is processed by calling your Reconcile() function.</p><p>In effect, the operator’s reconcilers extend Kubernetes’ control loop to your custom domain.</p><h2><strong>Best Practices &amp; Tips (parting advice)</strong></h2><ul><li>Keep your reconcile logic modular: break it into sub-reconcilers or small functions (e.g. “ensureDeployment”, “ensureConfig”, “updateStatus”).</li><li>Use conditions in status (Ready, Progressing, Degraded) rather than encoding booleans or strings; it makes status easier to interpret and extend.</li><li>Guard expensive list or watch operations — use indexers or field selectors to limit scope.</li><li>Use leader election if you run multiple replicas of your operator (to avoid double work).</li><li>Monitor metrics (reconcile durations, queue length, errors).</li><li>Be careful with schema evolution: provide CRD conversion webhooks or adopting strategies when migrating APIs.</li><li>Use finalizers to clean up external dependencies (e.g. delete cloud resources) before object is fully removed.</li><li>Gracefully handle partial failures: circuit-breakers, retries, backoff.</li><li>Document your CRD’s fields, constraints, examples (use config/samples).</li><li>Seat your operator in a namespace (or cluster-wide) thoughtfully — restrict RBAC.</li><li>Don’t let your operator manage more than one CR kind (if too many concerns, split into multiple controllers) </li></ul><p>Operators + CRDs represent a powerful pattern for making Kubernetes aware of your domain logic and automating much of the operational burden. You define new APIs (CRDs), and the operator (controller) drives the system toward the desired state — doing what a human operator would, but continuously, reliably, at cluster scale.</p><p>Yes, there’s complexity, and writing a robust operator takes care, testing, observability, and design discipline.

But even the best GC uses CPU cycles and causes brief  pauses, which can be significant in latency sensitive, high throughput applications.</p><p>The best GC is <strong>the one that has nothing to do</strong>.

The Foundation: Stack and Heap Explained 🧠\n</h2><p>Before we dive into optimization, let's establish where your data lives in memory.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  The Stack (Fast and Predictable)\n</h3><p>The Stack is a small, highly organized region of memory that operates on a <strong>Last-In, First-Out (LIFO)</strong> principle like a stack of plates.</p><p>It stores data with a : local variables, function arguments, and return values. When a function is called, its data is pushed onto the stack. When it returns, that data is instantly popped off and freed.</p><p> The Garbage Collector never touches the stack. This makes stack allocation incredibly cheap and fast.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  The Heap (Dynamic and Garbage Collected)\n</h3><p>The Heap is a large, unstructured pool of memory shared across all Goroutines.</p><p>It stores data whose <strong>lifetime or size can't be determined at compile time</strong>: slices, maps, channels, large structs, or any variable that \"escapes\" its function scope (more on this in a moment).</p><p> The Garbage Collector must periodically scan the heap, mark live objects, and sweep away garbage. Every heap allocation adds work for the GC.</p><div><table><thead><tr></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>LIFO, fast, fixed size. Holds local variables and function data.</td><td>Automatically freed on function return.</td></tr><tr><td>Dynamic, grows indefinitely, globally accessible.</td><td>Garbage Collector must mark, scan, and sweep.</td></tr></tbody></table></div><p><strong>Our goal: Keep as much data on the stack as possible.</strong></p><h2>\n  \n  \n  2. The Allocation Battle: Stack vs. Heap 🧠\n</h2><p>The root of GC pressure lies in where our data lives.</p><p>Our primary goal is to convince the Go compiler to keep variables on the stack through a process called .</p><p><strong>The Compiler's Escape Analysis</strong></p><p>Escape analysis is an optimization performed by the Go compiler. It determines whether a variable created inside a function must \"escape\" to the heap (meaning its lifetime is unknown or extends beyond the function's return) or can safely remain on the stack.</p><p>You can check if a variable escapes using the compiler flag:</p><div><pre><code>go build  your_package/main.go\n</code></pre></div><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><ul><li><p>:\nIf you return the address of a local variable , that variable must escape to the heap so it remains valid outside the function.</p></li><li><p><u>Assigning to an Interface</u>:\nStoring a concrete type in an interface variable often forces an allocation, as the compiler can't predict the interface's dynamic behavior (interface boxing).</p></li><li><p>:\nWhile the exact thresholds vary, very large slices (e.g., &gt;64KB) or arrays (e.g., &gt;10MB) are typically moved to the heap, even if they're local.</p></li></ul><p>: Favor  and avoid unnecessary pointers for small structs. Pass small structs by value to keep them stack allocated where possible.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  2. Practical Strategies to Reduce Allocations 🛠️\n</h2><p>Once you've tuned your code to keep variables on the stack, the next step is to reduce the churn of objects that must be heap-allocated.</p><p><strong>Strategy A: Object Pooling with </strong></p><p>The  package is your best friend for reusable, temporary objects that are expensive to create but short-lived. This is perfect for objects like large buffers or structs used within an I/O loop (e.g., network handlers, log messages).</p><p>Instead of letting the GC constantly clean up temporary buffers, we reuse them:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>By reusing a buffer from the pool, you bypass the entire allocation process and, crucially, avoid generating garbage for the GC.</p><p>When you have high frequency, temporary objects (request handlers, temporary buffers)\nObjects that are expensive to allocate (large structs, byte slices)<p>\nNOT for long lived objects or connection pools (use dedicated pooling for those).</p></p><p><strong>Strategy B: Pre-allocate Maps and Slices</strong></p><p>Slices and maps are dynamic, which means they often require reallocation and copying when they grow beyond their current capacity. This constant resizing creates GC work.</p><p>If you know the expected size, pre-allocate using  with a capacity hint:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>For maps, this practice minimizes hash collisions and subsequent internal restructuring:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Without pre allocation, a slice that grows from  elements will trigger approximately  (Go roughly doubles capacity each time). </p><ol><li>Allocating new, larger backing array</li><li>Copying all existing elements</li><li>Marking old array as garbage</li></ol><p><strong>Pre allocation eliminates all of this.</strong></p><p><strong>Strategy C: Minimize Goroutine Leaks</strong></p><p>While not strictly a \"memory allocation\" issue, leaked goroutines are a major source of memory leaks in Go. A goroutine that's blocked forever retains the memory of its entire stack, preventing the GC from reclaiming it.</p><p>Always manage the lifecycle of concurrent operations, especially with I/O or background workers, typically using the  package:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Goroutines waiting on channels that never receive data\nHTTP requests without timeouts<p>\nBackground workers without shutdown signals</p></p><p> Use  and track the count over time. If it grows unbound, you have a leak.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  3. Controlling the GC (Container Tuning) 🐳\n</h2><p>For the majority of applications, you should leave Go's GC settings alone. However, in high-performance or resource-constrained environments (like containers), manual tuning becomes essential.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  The Old Way: Relative Tuning with GOGC\n</h3><p>The  environment variable controls how much the heap must grow relative to the live heap before GC is triggered (default is 100%).</p><p> In high-memory applications, if you have a 4GB live heap on a 6GB machine, the default  means the GC won't trigger until the heap reaches 8GB (4GB × 2). This immediately exceeds your physical limit, leading to an OOM kill by the kernel.</p><p>You were forced to use low  values (like ) to stay safe, which caused the GC to run too frequently and waste CPU cycles.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  The Game Changer: Absolute Limits with  (Go 1.19+)\n</h3><p>The  environment variable sets a  for the entire process (heap + non-heap memory). This is the modern solution for containerized and memory-intensive applications.</p><p>By setting this limit (e.g., ), you tell the Go runtime to:</p><ol><li><p> The GC automatically adjusts its aggressiveness. When the live heap is small, GC runs rarely (conserving CPU). As total memory usage approaches the limit, the GC becomes highly aggressive (sacrificing CPU for safety).</p></li><li><p> It gives the GC a target to stay under, ensuring the memory scheduler is driven by an absolute limit, not just relative heap growth. This allows you to utilize available memory more efficiently without constantly fearing the kernel OOM killer.</p></li></ol><p><strong>Understanding the Trade-offs</strong></p><p>Lower memory limit (or lower GOGC) = More frequent GC = Higher CPU usage, lower memory footprint\nHigher memory limit (or higher GOGC) = Less frequent GC = Lower CPU usage, higher memory footprint</p><p>In Kubernetes, the OOM killer operates at the container level. If your pod has a memory limit of 4GB but you don't set , the Go runtime has no visibility into this constraint. The GC will happily let the heap grow until the kernel kills your process. Always set  to ~90% of your container's memory limit. This leaves a safe buffer for OS and non-heap Go runtime allocations.</p><div><pre><code>3500MiB ./your-service\n</code></pre></div><p> If your application is CPU-bound and produces minimal garbage, combine  with . This maximizes CPU usage for application logic, forcing GC to run only when the absolute memory limit is approached.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Final Thoughts: Measure, Don't Guess 📊\n</h2><p>Before you apply any of these optimizations, you must profile your application.\nGo's built-in  tool via  is indispensable. It lets you generate profiles for CPU usage and, most importantly for this topic, heap allocation. Use it to pinpoint the exact lines of code responsible for the highest allocation rate.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p><code>http://localhost:6060/debug/pprof/heap</code> - Memory allocations<code>http://localhost:6060/debug/pprof/goroutine</code> - Active goroutines<code>http://localhost:6060/debug/pprof/profile?seconds=30</code> - CPU profile</p><ol><li>Identify the top allocation site.</li><li>Optimize (e.g., use , pre-allocate, or simplify data structures).</li><li>Verify (re-measure to confirm GC pressure is reduced).</li></ol><ol><li>Alloc/s (allocations per second) - Lower is better</li><li>GC Pause Time - Should be  for most applications</li><li>Heap Size - Should stabilize, not grow unbound</li><li>GC Frequency - Fewer cycles = less overhead</li></ol><p>By eliminating unnecessary heap allocations, you'll see faster execution, fewer GC pauses, and a more robust high-load Go application.</p><p>Memory management in Go isn't black magic, it's a systematic process of understanding where your data lives and making conscious decisions about allocation patterns.</p><ul><li>Stack allocations are free, heap allocations cost CPU cycles</li><li>Profile before optimizing  is your best friend</li><li>In production containers, always set  to avoid OOM kills</li><li>Use  for high-frequency temporary objects</li><li>Pre-allocate when you know the size</li></ul><p>Start small: profile your hottest code paths, identify the top allocators, and apply these techniques incrementally.</p><p><strong>You don't need to optimize everything, focus on what matters.</strong></p>","contentLength":9355,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Go UDP Programming: A Beginner-Friendly Guide to Building Fast, Real-Time Apps","url":"https://dev.to/jones_charles_ad50858dbc0/go-udp-programming-a-beginner-friendly-guide-to-building-fast-real-time-apps-4ik","date":1761699106,"author":"Jones Charles","guid":319528,"unread":true,"content":"<p>Picture sending a quick text to a friend—no delivery receipt, no guarantee it arrives, but it’s lightning-fast.

It’s perfect for real-time apps like video calls, DNS lookups, or log streaming, where a tiny bit of lost data won’t ruin the show. And when paired with , with its slick  package and concurrency superpowers (goroutines!), UDP programming becomes a breeze.</p><p>This guide is for developers with a bit of Go experience (say, 1-2 years) who want to dive into UDP for fast, scalable apps.

This makes it ideal for apps where speed trumps perfection, like live video or system logs. In Go, the  package makes UDP programming dead simple with tools like  and .

a link to the talk once it’s available online.</p><h2>Tracing garbage collection</h2><p>Before we discuss Green Tea let’s get us all on the same page about garbage\ncollection.</p><p>The purpose of garbage collection is to automatically reclaim and reuse memory\nno longer used by the program.</p><p>To this end, the Go garbage collector concerns itself with  and\n.</p><p>In the context of the Go runtime,  are Go values whose underlying\nmemory is allocated from the heap.\nHeap objects are created when the Go compiler can’t figure out how else to allocate\nmemory for a value.\nFor example, the following code snippet allocates a single heap object: the backing\nstore for a slice of pointers.</p><pre><code>var x = make([]*int, 10) // global\n</code></pre><p>The Go compiler can’t allocate the slice backing store anywhere except the heap,\nsince it’s very hard, and maybe even impossible, for it to know how long  will\nrefer to the object for.</p><p> are just numbers that indicate the location of a Go value in memory,\nand they’re how a Go program references objects.\nFor example, to get the pointer to the beginning of the object allocated in the\nlast code snippet, we can write:</p><p>Go’s garbage collector follows a strategy broadly referred to as <em>tracing garbage\ncollection</em>, which just means that the garbage collector follows, or traces, the\npointers in the program to identify which objects the program is still using.</p><p>More specifically, the Go garbage collector implements the mark-sweep algorithm.\nThis is much simpler than it sounds.\nImagine objects and pointers as a sort of graph, in the computer science sense.\nObjects are nodes, pointers are edges.</p><p>The mark-sweep algorithm operates on this graph, and as the name might suggest,\nproceeds in two phases.</p><p>In the first phase, the mark phase, it walks the object graph from well-defined\nsource edges called .\nThink global and local variables.\nThen, it  everything it finds along the way as , to avoid going in\ncircles.\nThis is analogous to your typical graph flood algorithm, like a depth-first or\nbreadth-first search.</p><p>Next is the sweep phase.\nWhatever objects were not visited in our graph walk are unused, or ,\nby the program.\nWe call this state unreachable because it is impossible with normal safe Go code\nto access that memory anymore, simply through the semantics of the language.\nTo complete the sweep phase, the algorithm simply iterates through all the\nunvisited nodes and marks their memory as free, so the memory allocator can reuse\nit.</p><p>You may think I’m oversimplifying a bit here.\nGarbage collectors are frequently referred to as , and .\nAnd you’d be partially right, there are more complexities.</p><p>For example, this algorithm is, in practice, executed concurrently with your\nregular Go code.\nWalking a graph that’s mutating underneath you brings challenges.\nWe also parallelize this algorithm, which is a detail that’ll come up again\nlater.</p><p>But trust me when I tell you that these details are mostly separate from the\ncore algorithm.\nIt really is just a simple graph flood at the center.</p><p>Let’s walk through an example.\nNavigate through the slideshow below to follow along.</p><p>After all that, I think we have a handle on what the Go garbage collector is actually doing.\nThis process seems to work well enough today, so what’s the problem?</p><p>Well, it turns out we can spend  of time executing this particular algorithm in some\nprograms, and it adds substantial overhead to nearly every Go program.\nIt’s not that uncommon to see Go programs spending 20% or more of their CPU time in the\ngarbage collector.</p><p>Let’s break down where that time is being spent.</p><p>At a high level, there are two parts to the cost of the garbage collector.\nThe first is how often it runs, and the second is how much work it does each time it runs.\nMultiply those two together, and you get the total cost of the garbage collector.</p><figure><figcaption>\n    Total GC cost = Number of GC cycles × Average cost per GC cycle\n    </figcaption></figure><p>But for now let’s focus only on the second part, the cost per cycle.</p><p>From years of poring over CPU profiles to try to improve performance, we know two big things\nabout Go’s garbage collector.</p><p>The first is that about 90% of the cost of the garbage collector is spent marking,\nand only about 10% is sweeping.\nSweeping turns out to be much easier to optimize than marking,\nand Go has had a very efficient sweeper for many years.</p><p>The second is that, of that time spent marking, a substantial portion, usually at least 35%, is\nsimply spent  on accessing heap memory.\nThis is bad enough on its own, but it completely gums up the works on what makes modern CPUs\nactually fast.</p><h3>“A microarchitectural disaster”</h3><p>What does “gum up the works” mean in this context?\nThe specifics of modern CPUs can get pretty complicated, so let’s use an analogy.</p><p>Imagine the CPU driving down a road, where that road is your program.\nThe CPU wants to ramp up to a high speed, and to do that it needs to be able to see far ahead of it,\nand the way needs to be clear.\nBut the graph flood algorithm is like driving through city streets for the CPU.\nThe CPU can’t see around corners and it can’t predict what’s going to happen next.\nTo make progress, it constantly has to slow down to make turns, stop at traffic lights, and avoid\npedestrians.\nIt hardly matters how fast your engine is because you never get a chance to get going.</p><p>Let’s make that more concrete by looking at our example again.\nI’ve overlaid the heap here with the path that we took.\nEach left-to-right arrow represents a piece of scanning work that we did\nand the dashed arrows show how we jumped around between bits of scanning work.</p><p>Notice that we were jumping all over memory doing tiny bits of work in each place.\nIn particular, we’re frequently jumping between pages, and between different parts of pages.</p><p>Modern CPUs do a lot of caching.\nGoing to main memory can be up to 100x slower than accessing memory that’s in our cache.\nCPU caches are populated with memory that’s been recently accessed, and memory that’s nearby to\nrecently accessed memory.\nBut there’s no guarantee that any two objects that point to each other will  be close to each\nother in memory.\nThe graph flood doesn’t take this into account.</p><p>Quick side note: if we were just stalling fetches to main memory, it might not be so bad.\nCPUs issue memory requests asynchronously, so even slow ones could overlap if the CPU could see\nfar enough ahead.\nBut in the graph flood, every bit of work is small, unpredictable, and highly dependent on the\nlast, so the CPU is forced to wait on nearly every individual memory fetch.</p><p>And unfortunately for us, this problem is only getting worse.\nThere’s an adage in the industry of “wait two years and your code will get faster.”</p><p>But Go, as a garbage collected language that relies on the mark-sweep algorithm, risks the opposite.\n“Wait two years and your code will get slower.”\nThe trends in modern CPU hardware are creating new challenges for garbage collector performance:</p><p><strong>Non-uniform memory access.</strong>\nFor one, memory now tends to be associated with subsets of CPU cores.\nAccesses by  CPU cores to that memory are slower than before.\nIn other words, the cost of a main memory access <a href=\"https://jprahman.substack.com/p/sapphire-rapids-core-to-core-latency\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">depends on which CPU core is accessing\nit</a>.\nIt’s non-uniform, so we call this non-uniform memory access, or NUMA for short.</p><p><strong>Reduced memory bandwidth.</strong>\nAvailable memory bandwidth per CPU is trending downward over time.\nThis just means that while we have more CPU cores, each core can submit relatively fewer\nrequests to main memory, forcing non-cached requests to wait longer than before.</p><p>\nAbove, we looked at a sequential marking algorithm, but the real garbage collector performs this\nalgorithm in parallel.\nThis scales well to a limited number of CPU cores, but the shared queue of objects to scan becomes\na bottleneck, even with careful design.</p><p><strong>Modern hardware features.</strong>\nNew hardware has fancy features like vector instructions, which let us operate on a lot of data at once.\nWhile this has the potential for big speedups, it’s not immediately clear how to make that work for\nmarking because marking does so much irregular and often small pieces of work.</p><p>Finally, this brings us to Green Tea, our new approach to the mark-sweep algorithm.\nThe key idea behind Green Tea is astonishingly simple:</p><p><em>Work with pages, not objects.</em></p><p>Sounds trivial, right?\nAnd yet, it took a lot of work to figure out how to order the object graph walk and what we needed to\ntrack to make this work well in practice.</p><p>More concretely, this means:</p><ul><li>Instead of scanning objects we scan whole pages.</li><li>Instead of tracking objects on our work list, we track whole pages.</li><li>We still need to mark objects at the end of the day, but we’ll track marked objects locally to each\npage, rather than across the whole heap.</li></ul><p>Let’s see what this means in practice by looking at our example heap again, but this time\nrunning Green Tea instead of the straightforward graph flood.</p><p>As above, navigate through the annotated slideshow to follow along.</p><p>Let’s come back around to our driving analogy.\nAre we finally getting on the highway?</p><p>Let’s recall our graph flood picture before.</p><p>We jumped around a whole lot, doing little bits of work in different places.\nThe path taken by Green Tea looks very different.</p><p>Green Tea, in contrast, makes fewer, longer left-to-right passes over pages A and B.\nThe longer these arrows, the better, and with bigger heaps, this effect can be much stronger.\n the magic of Green Tea.</p><p>It’s also our opportunity to ride the highway.</p><p>This all adds up to a better fit with the microarchitecture.\nWe can now scan objects closer together with much higher probability, so\nthere’s a better chance we can make use of our caches and avoid main memory.\nLikewise, per-page metadata is more likely to be in cache.\nTracking pages instead of objects means work lists are smaller,\nand less pressure on work lists means less contention and fewer CPU stalls.</p><p>And speaking of the highway, we can take our metaphorical engine into gears we’ve never been able to\nbefore, since now we can use vector hardware!</p><p>If you’re only vaguely familiar with vector hardware, you might be confused as to how we can use it here.\nBut besides the usual arithmetic and trigonometric operations,\nrecent vector hardware supports two things that are valuable for Green Tea:\nvery wide registers, and sophisticated bit-wise operations.</p><p>Most modern x86 CPUs support AVX-512, which has 512-bit wide vector registers.\nThis is wide enough to hold all of the metadata for an entire page in just two registers,\nright on the CPU, enabling Green Tea to work on an entire page in just a few straight-line\ninstructions.\nVector hardware has long supported basic bit-wise operations on whole vector registers, but starting\nwith AMD Zen 4 and Intel Ice Lake, it also supports a new bit vector “Swiss army knife” instruction\nthat enables a key step of the Green Tea scanning process to be done in just a few CPU cycles.\nTogether, these allow us to turbo-charge the Green Tea scan loop.</p><p>This wasn’t even an option for the graph flood, where we’d be jumping between scanning objects that\nare all sorts of different sizes.\nSometimes you needed two bits of metadata and sometimes you needed ten thousand.\nThere simply wasn’t enough predictability or regularity to use vector hardware.</p><p>If you want to nerd out on some of the details, read along!\nOtherwise, feel free to skip ahead to the <a href=\"https://go.dev/blog/greenteagc#evaluation\">evaluation</a>.</p><p>To get a sense of what AVX-512 GC scanning looks like, take a look at the diagram below.</p><p>There’s a lot going on here and we could probably fill an entire blog post just on how this works.\nFor now, let’s just break it down at a high level:</p><ol><li><p>First we fetch the “seen” and “scanned” bits for a page.\nRecall, these are one bit per object in the page, and all objects in a page have the same size.</p></li><li><p>Next, we compare the two bit sets.\nTheir union becomes the new “scanned” bits, while their difference is the “active objects” bitmap,\nwhich tells us which objects we need to scan in this pass over the page (versus previous passes).</p></li><li><p>We take the difference of the bitmaps and “expand” it, so that instead of one bit per object,\nwe have one bit per word (8 bytes) of the page.\nWe call this the “active words” bitmap.\nFor example, if the page stores 6-word (48-byte) objects, each bit in the active objects bitmap\nwill be copied to 6 bits in the active words bitmap.\nLike so:</p></li></ol><figure><div> → <pre>000000 000000 111111 111111 ...</pre></div></figure><ol start=\"4\"><li><p>Next we fetch the pointer/scalar bitmap for the page.\nHere, too, each bit corresponds to a word (8 bytes) of the page, and it tells us whether that word\nstores a pointer.\nThis data is managed by the memory allocator.</p></li><li><p>Now, we take the intersection of the pointer/scalar bitmap and the active words bitmap.\nThe result is the “active pointer bitmap”: a bitmap that tells us the location of every\npointer in the entire page contained in any live object we haven’t scanned yet.</p></li><li><p>Finally, we can iterate over the memory of the page and collect all the pointers.\nLogically, we iterate over each set bit in the active pointer bitmap,\nload the pointer value at that word, and write it back to a buffer that\nwill later be used to mark objects seen and add pages to the work list.\nUsing vector instructions, we’re able to do this 64 bytes at a time,\nin just a couple instructions.</p></li></ol><p>Part of what makes this fast is the  instruction,\npart of the “Galois Field New Instructions” x86 extension,\nand the bit manipulation Swiss army knife we referred to above.\nIt’s the real star of the show, since it lets us do step (3) in the scanning kernel very, very\nefficiently.\nIt performs a bit-wise <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affine_transformation\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">affine\ntransformations</a>,\ntreating each byte in a vector as itself a mathematical vector of 8 bits\nand multiplying it by an 8x8 bit matrix.\nThis is all done over the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_field\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Galois field</a>,\nwhich just means multiplication is AND and addition is XOR.\nThe upshot of this is that we can define a few 8x8 bit matrices for each\nobject size that perform exactly the 1:n bit expansion we need.</p><p>For the full assembly code, see <a href=\"https://cs.opensource.google/go/go/+/master:src/internal/runtime/gc/scan/scan_amd64.s;l=23;drc=041f564b3e6fa3f4af13a01b94db14c1ee8a42e0\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">this\nfile</a>.\nThe “expanders” use different matrices and different permutations for each size class,\nso they’re in a <a

target=\"_blank\">code generator</a>.\nAside from the expansion functions, it’s really not a lot of code.\nMost of it is dramatically simplified by the fact that we can perform most of the above\noperations on data that sits purely in registers.\nAnd, hopefully soon this assembly code <a href=\"https://go.dev/issue/73787\">will be replaced with Go code</a>!</p><p>Credit to Austin Clements for devising this process.\nIt’s incredibly cool, and incredibly fast!</p><p>So that’s it for how it works.\nHow much does it actually help?</p><p>It can be quite a lot.\nEven without the vector enhancements, we see reductions in garbage collection CPU costs\nbetween 10% and 40% in our benchmark suite.\nFor example, if an application spends 10% of its time in the garbage collector, then that\nwould translate to between a 1% and 4% overall CPU reduction, depending on the specifics of\nthe workload.\nA 10% reduction in garbage collection CPU time is roughly the modal improvement.\n(See the <a href=\"https://go.dev/issue/73581\">GitHub issue</a> for some of these details.)</p><p>We’ve rolled Green Tea out inside Google, and we see similar results at scale.</p><p>We’re still rolling out the vector enhancements,\nbut benchmarks and early results suggest this will net an additional 10% GC CPU reduction.</p><p>While most workloads benefit to some degree, there are some that don’t.</p><p>Green Tea is based on the hypothesis that we can accumulate enough objects to scan on a\nsingle page in one pass to counteract the costs of the accumulation process.\nThis is clearly the case if the heap has a very regular structure: objects of the same size at a\nsimilar depth in the object graph.\nBut there are some workloads that often require us to scan only a single object per page at a time.\nThis is potentially worse than the graph flood because we might be doing more work than before while\ntrying to accumulate objects on pages and failing.</p><p>The implementation of Green Tea has a special case for pages that have only a single object to scan.\nThis helps reduce regressions, but doesn’t completely eliminate them.</p><p>However, it takes a lot less per-page accumulation to outperform the graph flood\nthan you might expect.\nOne surprise result of this work was that scanning a mere 2% of a page at a time\ncan yield improvements over the graph flood.</p><p>Green Tea is already available as an experiment in the recent Go 1.25 release and can be enabled\nby setting the environment variable  to  at build time.\nThis doesn’t include the aforementioned vector acceleration.</p><p>We expect to make it the default garbage collector in Go 1.26, but you’ll still be able to opt-out\nwith <code>GOEXPERIMENT=nogreenteagc</code> at build time.\nGo 1.26 will also add vector acceleration on newer x86 hardware, and include a whole bunch of\ntweaks and improvements based on feedback we’ve collected so far.</p><p>If you can, we encourage you to try at Go tip-of-tree!\nIf you prefer to use Go 1.25, we’d still love your feedback.\nSee <a href=\"https://go.dev/issue/73581#issuecomment-2847696497\">this GitHub\ncomment</a> with some details on\nwhat diagnostics we’d be interested in seeing, if you can share, and the preferred channels for\nreporting feedback.</p><p>Before we wrap up this blog post, let’s take a moment to talk about the journey that got us here.\nThe human element of the technology.</p><p>The core of Green Tea may seem like a single, simple idea.\nLike the spark of inspiration that just one single person had.</p><p>But that’s not true at all.\nGreen Tea is the result of work and ideas from many people over several years.\nSeveral people on the Go team contributed to the ideas, including Michael Pratt, Cherry Mui, David\nChase, and Keith Randall.\nMicroarchitectural insights from Yves Vandriessche, who was at Intel at the time, also really helped\ndirect the design exploration.\nThere were a lot of ideas that didn’t work, and there were a lot of details that needed figuring out.\nJust to make this single, simple idea viable.</p><p>The seeds of this idea go all the way back to 2018.\nWhat’s funny is that everyone on the team thinks someone else thought of this initial idea.</p><p>Green Tea got its name in 2024 when Austin worked out a prototype of an earlier version while cafe\ncrawling in Japan and drinking LOTS of matcha!\nThis prototype showed that the core idea of Green Tea was viable.\nAnd from there we were off to the races.</p><p>Throughout 2025, as Michael implemented and productionized Green Tea, the ideas evolved and changed even\nfurther.</p><p>This took so much collaborative exploration because Green Tea is not just an algorithm, but an entire\ndesign space.\nOne that we don’t think any of us could’ve navigated alone.\nIt’s not enough to just have the idea, but you need to figure out the details and prove it.\nAnd now that we’ve done it, we can finally iterate.</p><p>The future of Green Tea is bright.</p><p>Once again, please try it out by setting  and let us know how it goes!\nWe’re really excited about this work and want to hear from you!</p>","contentLength":19499,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"A

The N+1 query problem, where a single request triggers multiple follow-up queries, can cripple response times in nested data structures. I have spent considerable time refining GraphQL implementations in Golang to tackle this issue head-on. Through a combination of intelligent batching, multi-level caching, and query analysis, it is possible to achieve sub-millisecond response times even for deeply nested queries.</p><p>In many GraphQL setups, each field resolver operates independently, leading to repeated database calls for related data. This inefficiency becomes glaringly obvious when querying lists of objects with nested relationships. My approach centers on intercepting these resolver calls and grouping them into batch operations. This transformation reduces the number of database round trips from linear to constant, regardless of query depth.</p><p>The core of this optimization lies in the DataLoader pattern. A DataLoader collects individual data requests within a single execution frame and processes them as a batch. I implemented a DataLoader in Golang that uses channels and mutexes to manage concurrent access. It waits for a configurable time or until a batch size limit is reached before dispatching the accumulated keys to a batch function. This method ensures that related data fetches happen in one go.</p><p>Here is a practical example of setting up a DataLoader for user posts. Suppose we have a GraphQL schema where users have multiple posts. Without batching, fetching ten users with their posts could result in eleven database queries: one for the users and ten for their posts. With the DataLoader, it becomes two queries.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Caching plays an equally critical role in this optimization strategy. I designed a multi-level caching system that operates at both the query and field levels. The query cache stores parsed query structures and their analysis results. This prevents repetitive parsing of identical queries, saving valuable CPU cycles. The field cache stores the results of individual field resolvers based on their inputs and context.</p><p>Implementing the query cache involves hashing the query string and storing the parsed AST along with metadata like field complexity. When the same query arrives again, we skip the parsing phase and proceed directly to execution planning. This is particularly effective in applications with repetitive query patterns, such as those from mobile clients or dashboard interfaces.</p><p>Field-level caching requires careful key generation to avoid serving stale data. I use a combination of the field name, arguments, and parent object state to create unique cache keys. The cache has a configurable TTL and maximum size to manage memory usage. In high-traffic scenarios, this cache can reduce resolver execution time by over 90 percent for frequently accessed fields.</p><p>Here is how the field cache integrates into a resolver. The cache check happens before any data fetching logic, ensuring that cached results are returned immediately.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Query analysis is the third pillar of this optimization framework. Before executing a query, the system analyzes its structure to identify batching opportunities and optimal execution order. It examines field selections, depth, and relationships to group resolvers that can be batched together. This pre-execution planning phase adds minimal overhead but yields significant performance gains.</p><p>In one of my projects, I added complexity scoring to queries during analysis. Queries with high complexity scores trigger more aggressive batching and caching strategies. For instance, queries involving multiple nested levels automatically use DataLoaders for all relation fields. This proactive approach ensures that performance remains consistent even as query complexity scales.</p><p>The QueryOptimizer struct ties all these components together. It manages the DataLoader registry, query cache, and field cache. When a query arrives, it first checks the query cache. If missing, it parses and caches the query. Then, it analyzes the query to create an execution plan that maximizes batching and caching efficiency.</p><p>Here is a simplified version of how the QueryOptimizer processes a query. The ExecuteQuery method handles the entire lifecycle, from caching to execution and stats collection.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Performance monitoring is built into the system to track the effectiveness of these optimizations. Metrics like cache hit rates, batch sizes, and resolver call counts provide insights into how well the system is performing. I often use these metrics to fine-tune parameters like batch sizes and cache TTLs based on actual usage patterns.</p><p>In a benchmark test with a query fetching 100 users, each with 10 posts and 5 comments per post, the optimized version processed 1000 executions in under 10 seconds. The naive approach took over 2 minutes. The cache hit rate was around 85 percent after warm-up, and the number of database queries reduced from thousands to dozens.</p><p>Handling concurrency in Golang requires careful synchronization. The DataLoader uses a mutex to protect its internal state, and channels to communicate results back to waiting goroutines. This design ensures that multiple concurrent queries can share the same DataLoader instance without data races or deadlocks.</p><p>I recall a scenario where a sudden spike in user activity caused performance degradation. By adjusting the DataLoader's maxWait time and batch size, I was able to maintain low latency without overloading the database. The ability to dynamically tune these parameters is crucial for adapting to changing load patterns.</p><p>Another important aspect is cache invalidation. In systems with frequent data updates, stale cache entries can lead to inconsistencies. I implemented a cache invalidation strategy that uses database triggers or message queues to evict cached entries when underlying data changes. This ensures that users always see the most recent data without sacrificing performance.</p><p>Here is an example of cache invalidation in action. When a user updates their profile, we invalidate all cached fields that depend on that user's data.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>For production deployments, I recommend setting query complexity limits to prevent denial-of-service attacks. Deeply nested or overly broad queries can consume excessive resources. By rejecting queries that exceed predefined complexity thresholds, you protect the system from abusive queries while maintaining performance for legitimate users.</p><p>Request timeouts are another essential safeguard. I configure the GraphQL server to cancel queries that take longer than a specified duration. This prevents slow queries from monopolizing resources and ensures predictable response times under load.</p><p>Distributed caching can further enhance scalability. By using a shared cache like Redis for the field cache, multiple application instances can share cached results. This reduces redundant computation in a microservices architecture and improves overall system efficiency.</p><p>I have integrated this optimization framework into several high-traffic GraphQL APIs. In one e-commerce platform, it reduced average response time from 200ms to 15ms for product listing queries. The reduction in database load allowed the platform to handle twice the traffic with the same infrastructure.</p><p>The code examples provided are modular and can be adapted to various GraphQL schemas. The key is to identify the relationships in your data model that benefit most from batching and caching. Start with the most frequently accessed nested fields and gradually expand the optimization to cover more of your schema.</p><p>Testing is vital to ensure that optimizations do not introduce bugs. I write extensive unit tests for DataLoaders to verify that they correctly batch requests and return the right results. Integration tests simulate real query patterns to validate end-to-end performance improvements.</p><p>In conclusion, optimizing GraphQL query execution in Golang requires a holistic approach. Batching, caching, and query analysis work together to mitigate the N+1 problem and other inefficiencies. The implementation I shared has proven effective in production environments, delivering fast and reliable GraphQL APIs.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  I encourage you to experiment with these techniques in your projects.

I've spent years working with distributed systems, and building a high-performance reverse proxy in Golang has been one of the most rewarding projects. The language's concurrency model and efficiency make it ideal for this task. Today, I'll walk through creating a robust solution that handles thousands of requests per second while maintaining low latency.</p><p>When I first started designing this system, my goal was to minimize overhead while maximizing reliability. A reverse proxy sits between clients and backend servers, routing requests based on various strategies. It needs to be fast, resilient, and intelligent. Golang's standard library provides excellent tools, but careful design is crucial for performance.</p><p>Let me begin with the core structure. The ReverseProxy type manages all routing logic and backend coordination. It keeps track of available servers, applies load balancing strategies, and monitors health status. I use a mutex to handle concurrent access safely, ensuring data consistency under high load.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Each backend server is represented by a simple struct. It holds the server URL, alive status, active connection count, and other metadata. The Alive field is updated by the health checker, while Connections is managed atomically to avoid race conditions.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Initializing the proxy involves parsing backend URLs and setting up health checks. I prefer to start health monitoring immediately after creation. This ensures that any unavailable servers are detected early and excluded from routing.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>The ServeHTTP method handles incoming requests. It selects a backend using the configured strategy, increments connection counters, and proxies the request. I use httputil.ReverseProxy for the heavy lifting but customize it for better performance.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Load balancing strategies determine how requests are distributed. I've implemented several approaches over time. Round-robin is simple and effective for many use cases. It cycles through backends in order, ensuring fair distribution.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>For scenarios where backends have different capacities, least connections works better. It selects the server with the fewest active connections, helping to balance load based on current utilization.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Health checking is critical for maintaining system reliability. I run checks concurrently at regular intervals. Each backend is tested independently, and status updates happen atomically to avoid conflicts.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Performance monitoring helps me understand system behavior under load. I track requests, errors, bandwidth, and latency. These metrics are stored atomically and can be exposed for external monitoring systems.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>In production, I run the proxy as an HTTP server. It listens on a specified port and handles incoming traffic. I also start a background goroutine to log statistics periodically, which helps in debugging and capacity planning.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Connection management plays a huge role in performance. By reusing connections with proper timeouts, I reduce TCP handshake overhead. The transport configuration balances resource usage with responsiveness.</p><p>When a backend fails, the health checker marks it as dead within seconds. The load balancer automatically skips unavailable servers. This failover mechanism ensures high availability without manual intervention.</p><p>I've tested this setup under various load conditions. On an 8-core machine, it comfortably handles over 50,000 requests per second. Latency remains low, typically under one millisecond for local backends.</p><p>Memory usage scales predictably with the number of active connections. The atomic operations and efficient data structures keep overhead minimal. The system remains stable even during traffic spikes.</p><p>One challenge I faced was ensuring thread safety across all components. Using sync.RWMutex for the backends list and atomic operations for counters solved most issues. Proper testing under concurrent load was essential.</p><p>Another area I focused on was request modification. Adding headers like X-Forwarded-For helps backend servers identify original client IPs. This is crucial for logging and security policies.</p><p>The health check endpoint should be lightweight and fast. I assume backends expose a /health path that returns 200 OK when healthy. In real deployments, this endpoint might check database connections or other dependencies.</p><p>For environments with heterogeneous servers, weighted load balancing can be useful. Heavier backends get more traffic, while lighter ones handle less. Implementing this requires tracking server capacity and adjusting selection logic.</p><p>Circuit breakers are a valuable addition. They prevent continuous attempts to failed backends, giving them time to recover. I typically implement this by tracking error rates and temporarily excluding problematic servers.</p><p>Rate limiting protects backends from overload. By tracking request rates per client or overall, the proxy can reject excess traffic. This is especially important in public-facing deployments.</p><p>TLS termination offloads encryption from backend servers. The proxy handles SSL/TLS, forwarding plain HTTP internally. This improves performance and centralizes certificate management.</p><p>Access logging provides visibility into traffic patterns. I log details like client IP, request path, backend used, and response code. This data is invaluable for debugging and analysis.</p><p>Sticky sessions maintain user state across requests. By routing subsequent requests from the same client to the same backend, stateful applications work correctly. This can be implemented with cookies or IP-based hashing.</p><p>Metrics export integrates with monitoring systems like Prometheus. By exposing stats via an HTTP endpoint, external tools can scrape and alert on key indicators. This helps in proactive maintenance.</p><p>Graceful shutdown ensures no requests are lost during restarts. The proxy stops accepting new connections and waits for existing ones to complete. This requires careful coordination with the HTTP server.</p><p>In one deployment, I added response caching to reduce backend load. For static or semi-static content, storing responses locally improved performance significantly. The cache was invalidated based on TTL or specific headers.</p><p>Another enhancement was request buffering. For large uploads, reading the entire request before forwarding can prevent timeouts. This trades memory for reliability in high-latency networks.</p><p>I also experimented with dynamic configuration. Using etcd or Consul, the proxy can update backends without restarting. This allows seamless scaling and maintenance.</p><p>Error handling is robust but simple. When no backends are available, the proxy returns a 503 error. Detailed logging helps identify root causes quickly.</p><p>The code examples I've shared form a solid foundation. They demonstrate core concepts without unnecessary complexity.

Its standard library and concurrency primitives make such tasks manageable. The performance is impressive even without extensive optimization.</p><p>In conclusion, a well-designed reverse proxy and load balancer are essential for modern applications.

The implementation I've described handles high traffic with low overhead, ensuring smooth operation.</p><p>I continue to refine this approach based on real-world usage. Each deployment brings new insights and improvements.

You've heard of Python, Java, and that weird one called C++. But then, someone whispers the word... .</p><p>What is Go? Why is its mascot a cute (but slightly smug) gopher? And why should you, a complete beginner, even bother?</p><p>Let's be real: learning to program can feel like trying to build a spaceship with nothing but a spoon and some hope. It's confusing. It's frustrating.</p><p>Go (or \"Golang,\" its fancy Sunday name) is different. It was invented by some super-smart engineers at  because they were tired of their other tools being slow and complicated. They said, \"What if we made a language that's as  but as ?\"</p><p>And so, Go was born. Think of it as a sleek, modern sports car. It's incredibly powerful, but it only has a few buttons: \"Go Fast,\" \"Go Safe,\" and \"Don't Explode.\"</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Why Bother Learning Go? (aka \"The Good Stuff\")\n</h2><p>If you're going to spend time learning something, it better be worth it. Here's why Go is awesome.</p><p>Go is a \"compiled\" language. In human terms, this means before you run your program, Go translates your  plan into the computer's native language (1s and 0s).</p><ul><li><strong>Other languages (like Python):</strong> It's like giving a chef your recipe one... step... at... a... time. The chef has to read, think, and then do the step. It's flexible, but slow.</li><li> It's like giving the chef a  recipe in their native language, with all the ingredients already pre-chopped. The chef just . The result? Your program runs at warp speed.</li></ul><h3>\n  \n  \n  2. Go's Superpower: Juggling (aka Concurrency) 🤹\n</h3><p>This is Go's party trick.</p><p>Imagine you're a chef trying to make dinner. In most languages, you have to:</p><ol></ol><p>You can only do one thing at a time. It's boring and slow.</p><p>With Go, you're a master chef. You just say:</p><ul></ul><p>Go creates tiny, super-cheap helpers (called ) that go off and do all those tasks . You, the master chef, can just chill and wait for them to finish.</p><p>This is called , and it's why companies like , , and  use Go to handle millions of users at once without breaking a sweat.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  3. The Rulebook is TINY 📖\n</h3><p>Learning a language like Java or C++ is like trying to memorize a 1,000-page legal document. Go's entire rulebook is more like a pamphlet.</p><p>Go has only  (the special \"command\" words). Java has 50. C++ has over 90.</p><p>This means you spend less time scratching your head wondering, \"What does  even mean?!\" and more time actually building stuff. It also cleans up its own mess (called \"garbage collection\"), so you don't have to worry about the boring memory management stuff that gives other programmers nightmares.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Your \"Go-Bag\": How to Start in 3 Steps\n</h2><p>Okay, you're sold. You want to become a \"Go-pher\" (yes, that's what we're called).</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Step 1: Install It (The 5-Minute-Part)\n</h3><p>Download the installer for your system (Mac, Windows, Linux). Click \"Next\" a few times. You're done. Seriously.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Step 2: Set Up Your \"Kitchen\"\n</h3><ol><li> Create a folder anywhere. Call it .</li><li> Open this folder in a code editor.  is a fantastic free choice. When you open a Go file, it will even ask, \"Hey, want me to install the Go tools?\" Just say yes.</li></ol><h3>\n  \n  \n  Step 3: Write \"Hello, Gopher!\"\n</h3><p>This is the \"Hello, World!\" of Go. Create a new file in your folder called  and type this in:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Whoa, what is that? Let's break it down, fast:</p><ul><li>: This is the \"cover page\" of your project. It tells Go, \"This is the file where the whole thing starts.\"</li><li>: We're importing a \"toolbox\" called  (short for \"format\"). This toolbox has tools for printing things to the screen.</li><li>: This is the main  or . When you run your program, Go looks for  and does whatever is inside its curly braces .</li><li>: We're using our  toolbox, grabbing the  (Print Line) tool, and telling it to print our message.</li></ul><p>\nOpen a terminal, go into your project folder, and type:</p><p>You should see:<code>Hello, Gopher! Let's Go-oooo! 🚀</code></p><p><strong>YOU ARE OFFICIALLY A PROGRAMMER. PUT IT ON YOUR RESUME.</strong> (Okay, maybe do a few more tutorials first).</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  A Peek at Go's \"Personality\" (aka Cool Quirks)\n</h2><p>Go is simple, but it has a few \"opinions\" you'll find funny.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  1. Capital Letters Matter. A LOT.\n</h3><p>This is my favorite part. In Go, how you name things <em>actually changes how they work</em>.</p><ul><li>If you name something starting with a apital letter (like ), it's . It's like you're shouting its name from the rooftops. Any other part of your code can see it and use it.</li><li>If you name it with a owercase letter (like ), it's . It's like you're whispering. Only the code inside that  can see it.</li></ul><p>No more \"public,\" \"private,\" \"protected\" keywords. Just a capital letter. It's so simple, it's genius.</p><p>If you  a toolbox (like ) but , Go will refuse to run.\nIf you create a variable but , Go will refuse to run.</p><p>It's like a super-clean roommate who says, \"If you're not going to use that, it doesn't belong here.\" It seems annoying at first, but it keeps your code  and easy to read.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  So, Should You \"Go\" for It?\n</h2><p>Go is the perfect \"second language,\" and honestly, it's a fantastic  language too. It teaches you all the important concepts (variables, loops, functions) without all the confusing junk.</p><p>You'll be learning a language used to build massive, world-class systems, but you'll feel like you're just playing with high-speed Legos.</p><p>Ready to start your journey?

This is the life we chose, and if we’re writing Rust programs to\ntalk to remote APIs such as Weatherstack, as we did in <a href=\"https://bitfieldconsulting.com/posts/here-comes-sun\">Here comes the sun</a>, we’ll have to be\nable to cope with them sending us JSON data.</p><p>We’ll also need a way to turn that JSON into good honest Rust data,\nso we can compute stuff about it. Let’s see how to do that, as we\ncontinue to hack on our embarrassingly basic weather client program.</p><p>In <a href=\"https://bitfieldconsulting.com/posts/elephants-for-breakfast\">Elephants for\nbreakfast</a> we pondered how to test a function such as\n when we can’t know in advance \nweather conditions it’ll return. The correct response is literally up in\nthe air.</p><p>So we deftly flipped the problem——and decided\ninstead to write two functions that  testable:\n, which constructs the HTTP request to be sent to\nWeatherstack, and , which unpacks the\nanswer.</p><p>We’ve already written , or rather you did—great\njob on that, by the way! Let’s turn to  now.\nHere’s how we plan to call it as part of the \nfunction:</p><pre><code></code></pre><p>At this point we’ve already made the API request, and now\n contains the response, consisting of weather data in a\nspecific JSON format.</p><p>We’re saying here that if we pass the body of that response as a\n to , we should get back a\n struct representing the weather conditions that\nwere encoded in the JSON.</p><p>That sounds like something we can test, so it’s over to you again to\nfigure out how.</p><p> Write a test for \nalong these lines.</p><p> We have the real JSON data we saved earlier\nwhen making our <a href=\"https://bitfieldconsulting.com/posts/here-comes-sun\">exploratory request</a>\nto Weatherstack (if not, make it again). That’ll be perfect test data\nfor : we already know exactly what weather\nconditions it encodes, so all we need to do is check the result against\nthe corresponding  struct.</p><p> Here’s my attempt:</p><pre><code></code></pre><p>There’s no need to test extracting any of the other stuff in the\nJSON; we don’t use it, so extracting it would be a waste of time, and\ntesting that extraction even more so.</p><p>That was easy, I think you’ll agree, so let’s turn to the actual\nextraction. How are we going to turn a  into a\n?</p><p>You know if you’ve read my moderately bestselling book <a href=\"https://bitfieldconsulting.com/books/rust-tools\">The Secrets of Rust: Tools</a> that we can use\nthe  library to serialize and deserialize Rust structs\nto JSON by using the  attribute. For example:</p><pre><code></code></pre><p>By deriving the  trait, we asked\n to autogenerate code for turning a \nstruct into, effectively, a , and\n, naturally enough, does the reverse.</p><p>So could we do the same kind of thing here? Could we define some Rust\nstruct that mirrors the schema of the JSON data returned by\nWeatherstack, and derive  on it?</p><p>Yes, we could do it that way, but it turns out to be rather\nlaborious, because the API’s schema consists of \nstructures. We’d have to define structs for each level of the JSON we’re\ninterested in. For example, at the top level, we only want\n:</p><p>So we have to start by defining a struct that represents the entire\nresponse, with a single field for  (we can ignore\nall the others):</p><pre><code></code></pre><p>And, of course, we now need another struct definition to represent\nwhat’s inside :</p><pre><code></code></pre><p>It’s already getting annoying, and you can imagine there would be\nmany more of these structs if we had to deal with further levels of\nnesting in the API data. The worst part is that we don’t even\n these structs! There’s no function in our program that\nneeds to take or return a , for example: we\nalready have our own struct  that contains exactly\nand only the data we want.</p><p>Surely this isn’t the right way to use Rust’s type system. What we’d\nprefer is a way to look up the data we want directly in the JSON, and\nthen transfer it to our  struct, without going via a\nbunch of useless paperwork.</p><p>Luckily,  provides a way to do this, using a\nsyntax called “JSON Pointer”. First, we deserialize the data to the\nall-purpose type :</p><pre><code></code></pre><p>Assuming that we successfully get , then its contents\nrepresent the whole JSON object contained in the response. We can reach\nin and grab some specific part of it using a path-like notation:</p><pre><code></code></pre><p>Much more direct than using a bunch of intermediate structs. Of\ncourse, there might not  a value at that path, so it makes\nsense that  returns an , doesn’t\nit? (Read more about this in my tutorial on <a href=\"https://bitfieldconsulting.com/posts/rust-errors-option-result\">Results and Options in\nRust</a>.)</p><p>If this path didn’t exist in the JSON, the result would be\n, straightforwardly. But we can be pretty confident\nthat the server’s response  include this data, so the\nresult will be , and it will contain another\n representing whatever was found at the given\npath.</p><p>So let’s try to write  now using this\n“pointer” approach:</p><pre><code></code></pre><p>We’ve added a little extra paperwork here in case the lookups fail,\nusing  to return a suitable error message along\nwith the problematic JSON data.</p><p>Assuming the lookups succeed, though, we need to turn the resulting\ns into real Rust types:</p><p> is a useful little tool whenever we’re dealing\nwith s like this. If the option is ,\nit just does nothing. But if it’s , then it extracts\nthe value and applies the given function to it. In this case, that’s\n for the temperature, which parses the value as a\nfloating-point number, and  for the summary.</p><p>Having extracted, checked, and converted our \nand  values, then, we write them into our\n struct using the field init shorthand, and return\nit.</p><h3>Taking it for a trial run</h3><p>This passes the test, which is encouraging, so we now have the two <a href=\"https://bitfieldconsulting.com/posts/magic-function\">magic functions</a> we need to write\n.</p><pre><code></code></pre><p>I mean, if you cross off the parts we’ve already tested\n( and ), there’s not much\nleft, is there? The only substantive thing we don’t test is\n, and that’s not our code—we can assume\n itself works, or someone would have noticed by\nnow.</p><p>Let’s run the updated program for real and see what happens.</p><pre><code>Error: bad response: {\"error\":{\"code\":601,\"info\":\"Please specify a\nvalid location identifier using the query parameter.\",\"type\":\n\"missing_query\"},\"success\":false}</code></pre><p>Oops. That’s on me; I didn’t give a location on the command line to\nquery the weather for. But that’s exactly the sort of mistake that any\nuser might make, so we’d better catch it and provide a slightly nicer\nerror message:</p><pre><code></code></pre><p>Let’s try again, this time with a location:</p><pre><code>Weather { temperature: 12.0, summary: \"Partly cloudy\" }</code></pre><p>Fine. All our magic is working perfectly. That’s reassuring, so let’s\ntake this opportunity to tighten up a few bolts and caulk a few seams.\nWe’ll define a real implementation of , so that the\noutput doesn’t look so nerdy:</p><pre><code></code></pre><p>Nothing new here except this format parameter for the\ntemperature:</p><p>The  means “print to one decimal place”, rounding if\nnecessary. Without this, a temperature of 12.0 would print as just “12”,\nwhich seems a shame. We worked to get that extra decimal place: let’s\nhang on to it!</p><p>Here’s what it looks like with this change:</p><h3>Mixing arguments and\nenvironment variables</h3><p>And, since we’re going to the trouble of validating our arguments,\nlet’s hand that over to  and derive a suitable\n parser:</p><pre><code></code></pre><p>You might well think that if we’re deploying the awesome power of\n now, couldn’t we also use it to take the API key as a\ncommand-line option? That would be a nice enhancement, but currently\nwe’re looking for it in an environment variable:</p><pre><code></code></pre><p>Ideally, we’d have  get this from a flag if it’s\nprovided that way, and if not, look for it in the environment variable.\nAnd it turns out we can do exactly that, if we opt in to the\n feature:</p><p><strong><code>cargo add clap -F derive,env</code></strong></p><pre><code></code></pre><p>What we’re saying is, if the user provides the \nflag, use that value, and if they don’t, fall back to looking for it in\nthe environment variable. If it’s not there either, report an error,\nbecause this is a required flag.</p><p>By the way, while it’s conventional for Rust field names to be styled\nin so-called “snake case” (), it’s \nconventional for command-line arguments to be styled in so-called “kebab\ncase” (), so  makes this\ntransformation for us automatically. That’s the wonderful thing about\nconventions, of course: there are so many of them.</p><p>Very well, then. We’ve built a decent library crate that actually\ngets weather, and it has some tests. We can be pretty confident that\nboth  and  are implemented\nproperly. Since we can’t test the way they’re glued together in\n, I guess we’ll just have to hope it’s correct,\nright?</p><p>If you don’t think “hope” is a strategy, tune in next time to see\nwhether we can’t do a little better.</p>","contentLength":8289,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"My Experience with GoFr – Building Backend Apps Faster Than Ever!","url":"https://dev.to/kavya_turkar_62fc71116af7/my-experience-with-gofr-building-backend-apps-faster-than-ever-3mmp","date":1761565089,"author":"KAVYA Turkar","guid":316762,"unread":true,"content":"<p>🚀 My Experience with GoFr – Building Backend Apps Faster Than Ever!</p><p>As a developer, I’ve always been on the lookout for frameworks that simplify backend development without compromising performance or flexibility.

Every time you need ingredients (data), running to the storage room (external service), unlocking the door, and grabbing them is slow and wasteful. Instead, you keep a few doors open, ready to grab what you need. That’s what a TCP connection pool does—it keeps connections open and reusable, avoiding the costly TCP handshake (think: unlocking the door) and closure. In a real project, adding a connection pool cut API latency by ~30% and saved serious CPU cycles.

Let’s get started!</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Core Concepts: What’s a TCP Connection Pool?\n</h2><p>A TCP connection pool is like a library where you borrow and return books (connections) instead of buying new ones each time. It manages a set of pre-established TCP connections, ready for your app to use, reducing the overhead of creating and closing connections. Here’s how it works in a nutshell:</p><ol><li>: The pool opens a few connections to a server (e.g., an API or database).</li><li>: Your app grabs an idle connection (or creates a new one if needed).</li><li>: Send/receive data over the connection.</li><li>: Give the connection back to the pool for reuse (or close it if it’s idle too long).</li></ol><ul><li>: Skip the TCP three-way handshake (100-200ms in high-latency networks).</li><li>: Reuse connections to save file descriptors and CPU.</li><li>: Handle thousands of concurrent requests smoothly.</li></ul><p>In a payment API project, switching to a connection pool boosted queries per second (QPS) by 25% and cut CPU usage. Go’s lightweight goroutines and  package make it a perfect fit for this—goroutines handle concurrency, and the pool keeps connections ready.</p><p>Connection pools shine in:</p><ul><li><strong>High-concurrency HTTP clients</strong> (e.g., calling payment APIs).</li><li> (MySQL, Redis, PostgreSQL).</li><li> (gRPC or HTTP-based communication).</li></ul><p>Pools aren’t magic. In low-traffic apps, the overhead of maintaining a pool might outweigh benefits. Plus, idle connections can eat memory if not managed. In one project, forgetting to timeout idle connections spiked memory usage by 20%. Let’s avoid that!</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Segment 2: Design Considerations\n</h3><h2>\n  \n  \n  Designing a TCP Connection Pool: Think Like an Architect\n</h2><p>Building a TCP connection pool is like designing a high-speed train system—fast, reliable, and ready to scale.

Traditional locking mechanisms often introduce bottlenecks, reducing system throughput and increasing latency. I have spent years exploring alternatives that minimize contention while ensuring data integrity. Lock-free data structures offer a compelling solution by relying on atomic operations rather than mutexes. This approach can dramatically improve performance in highly concurrent environments, especially in Go, where goroutines multiply rapidly.</p><p>My journey into lock-free programming began with simple counters and evolved into complex queues and buffers. The initial hurdles involved understanding memory ordering and avoiding common pitfalls like ABA problems. Through trial and error, I discovered patterns that work reliably across different hardware architectures. The code examples I share here reflect lessons learned from production systems handling millions of operations per second.</p><p>Let me start with a ring buffer implementation. This structure provides a fixed-size circular queue where producers and consumers can operate concurrently without blocking each other. The key insight is using atomic operations to manage indices, ensuring thread safety without locks. I chose a power-of-two capacity to enable efficient modulo operations through bit masking, which speeds up index calculations significantly.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>The ring buffer uses compare-and-swap operations to update the tail and head pointers atomically. This ensures that only one goroutine can claim a slot at a time, preventing data races. The loop continues until the operation succeeds, which typically happens quickly under moderate contention. I added padding to separate the head and tail into different cache lines, reducing false sharing that can degrade performance on multi-core systems.</p><p>In one project, I used this ring buffer for a real-time data processing pipeline. It handled sensor data from multiple sources without dropping packets, even during traffic spikes. The lock-free design allowed us to achieve consistent sub-microsecond latency, which was critical for our application. We monitored queue depth and adjusted producer rates dynamically to prevent overflow.</p><p>Another useful structure is the multiple-producer single-consumer queue. This pattern appears frequently in scenarios like logging systems or task dispatchers, where many goroutines enqueue items, but only one consumes them. The implementation uses a linked list with atomic pointer operations to maintain consistency.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>The MPSC queue employs a dummy node to simplify edge cases. The sync.Pool recycles nodes, reducing garbage collection pressure. I recall an incident where memory allocations became a bottleneck in a high-throughput service. After switching to object pooling, throughput increased by 30% without any other changes. The atomic operations ensure that enqueues from multiple producers do not interfere with each other.</p><p>Atomic counters represent another foundational lock-free component. When multiple goroutines need to increment a shared counter, traditional approaches suffer from cache contention. By spreading counts across multiple cache lines, we can minimize this effect.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>This counter assigns each goroutine to a separate slot, padded to avoid false sharing. The Read method provides an approximate sum, which suffices for many monitoring purposes. I used a similar design in a metrics collection system, where precise counts were less critical than low overhead. The reduction in lock contention allowed the system to scale linearly with the number of cores.</p><p>Benchmarking these structures reveals their advantages. I often compare lock-free implementations against mutex-based alternatives to quantify the improvements. The following code demonstrates a simple performance test.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>In my tests, lock-free structures consistently outperform locked versions by a factor of five to ten under high contention. The ring buffer excels in scenarios with balanced producers and consumers, while the MPSC queue shines when one consumer serves many producers. These benchmarks help in selecting the right structure for specific use cases.</p><p>Writing lock-free code requires attention to detail. I always validate implementations using Go's race detector and stress tests. One common mistake is neglecting memory model guarantees, leading to subtle bugs. I learned to rely on atomic operations for all shared state modifications, avoiding data races entirely.</p><p>Another consideration is progress guarantees. Lock-free algorithms ensure that at least one goroutine makes progress, which prevents deadlocks. However, they can suffer from livelock or starvation if not designed carefully. I incorporate exponential backoff in spin loops to reduce CPU waste during high contention.</p><p>Integration with existing systems demands additional features. For instance, adding bounded wait strategies prevents resource exhaustion. Metrics collection helps in monitoring performance and detecting issues early. I often include counters for successful operations, failures, and average latency.</p><p>In a recent deployment, we combined lock-free queues with write-ahead logging for durability. This hybrid approach provided both high throughput and data persistence. The lock-free front end handled incoming requests, while a separate goroutine batched writes to disk. This design achieved millions of transactions per second with guaranteed delivery.</p><p>Error handling in lock-free structures differs from traditional code. Since operations are non-blocking, failures typically indicate full buffers or empty queues. I design APIs to return clear status codes, allowing callers to retry or apply backpressure. This proactive approach maintains system stability under load.</p><p>The performance benefits extend beyond raw throughput. Reduced latency improves user experience in interactive applications. Predictable memory usage simplifies capacity planning. I have seen systems become more responsive and reliable after adopting lock-free designs.</p><p>Despite the advantages, lock-free programming is not a silver bullet. It increases code complexity and requires thorough testing. I recommend starting with well-understood patterns and gradually customizing them for specific needs. Code reviews and static analysis tools catch many potential issues early.</p><p>Looking ahead, hardware advancements will likely make atomic operations even faster. New CPU instructions may simplify some lock-free algorithms. I continue to experiment with emerging techniques, always measuring impact before adopting changes.</p><p>My experience taught me that simplicity often beats cleverness. The most effective lock-free structures are those that solve a specific problem without unnecessary generality. I prefer composable components that can be combined to build larger systems.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  In conclusion, lock-free data structures offer significant performance improvements for concurrent Go applications. They eliminate locking overhead, reduce contention, and provide better scalability. The code examples here serve as a starting point for further exploration. I encourage developers to benchmark their implementations and tailor them to their unique requirements. The journey to mastering lock-free programming is challenging but rewarding, leading to faster and more robust software.\n</h2><p>📘 , , , and  to the channel!</p><p> is an AI-driven publishing company co-founded by author .

This is just the first step, I am aware of that, and the non-coding part often takes longer than the coding part. The purpose of my plugin is really simple, I wanted to be able to set a back-end account in the configuration, so I don't have to login my s3 credentials every time I want to use the app.</p><p>When I discovered Filestash I really loved its simplicity, sadly, as it often happens, I am discovering it is not so simple under the hood, not a bad thing, just to state some often not told truth, product simplicity very often do not correlate to technical simplicity.</p><p>The main reason to write this post is to help others in that regard, contribute to make Filestash a bit more simpler technically, or at least easier to understand.</p><p>In my previous post, <a href=\"https://dev.to/migsarnavarro/a-very-basic-plugin-for-filestash-1elf\">A very basic plugin for Filestash</a>, I described some of the problems I faced when I got started working with Filestash source code, this post builds on top of that.</p><p>I've been paying for a s3 compatible storage for a few months, and I really need it, but often I skip using it because of the lack of a UI, there are a few UIs already, but none of them adjust to my needs, so when I came to an open source project like Filestash, I thought it was perfect.</p><p>Since I don't think my use case is standard, I'll give you a few more details:</p><ul><li>I want to use Filestash as a GUI to manage my s3 compatible object storage.</li><li>I want to upload files, particularly photos and audio from a few different sources, particularly my cellphone (I guess it is not that common to use s3 object storage, and probably it is more common to pay for a backup service or for something like Google Photos but hold on, I'll explain).</li><li>I want to use the files in my s3 storage seamlessly in web-applications, Jupyter notebooks, and all other sort of network based experiments.</li></ul><ul><li>I don't need just a web file manager to move files between computers and the cloud.</li><li>I won't be sharing the access to this storage, I'll be the only one using it.</li><li>I will be sharing, some of the files I have in the storage, without ever showing Filestash UI.</li></ul><p>I've have not found a solution for what I need, and if you know about some nice solution please share it, I would love to hear about it. I need a really simple product totally aligned with my needs because any friction will make me not use it. </p><p>One last non-technical but very important reason. I'll do the development myself because I enjoy coding when it has a purpose, and I don't have the budget to hire someone else to do it, nor the patience to manage it.</p><blockquote><p>I need to initialize an s3 backend (although it should be similar for other backends) so I can open the app and I don't have to type the credentials for the backend any time.</p></blockquote>\nI want to avoid this screen by automatically login the user\n\n\n\n<p>From previous experiences I knew it was a good idea to take a look at the Github's repository issues, to see if other people have experienced or probably solved the same problem. I didn't find something similar to what I need, there was one open issue but it was really new and didn't have any useful information.</p><p>The first step was a quick product inspection, I started by opening the dev tools in the browser and taking a look at what happened when I run the app and do all the stuff manually. It was not as linear as I describe it next but it was not hard at all. As an example of the lack of linearity, just two days ago I suddenly realized I had not explored how the demo app authentication happened.</p><blockquote><p>The demo app actually uses a request to  with the credentials from the home page of filestash so the cookie is created. It is a quick solution that could work but I don't really like it because of two things: the first and most important is that it exposes the credentials, something that I didn't wanted to do, the second is that is not elegant at all (of course this is just my opinion).</p></blockquote><p>My initial approach was to skip authorization altogether, just initialize the back-end and directly jump to the files view. It may be possible, but I realized that for that approach to work I would need to edit the core, something really want to avoid. So I decided to find a way to make it work as a plugin, even if I already know compilation was needed to configure the plugin.</p><p>I didn't have any idea of what the app flow was, I had an idea of how I would architecture a similar application, but that didn't mean there were not other ways to achieve the same things.</p><p>From doing things manually I noticed that the first time I was immediately redirected to , but there was no login in the routes, so I assumed it was something in the browser. Then I realized that  was taken care at the end of all the routes in a catch all block. When I filled the form and click the submit button a POST request was made to .</p>\nThe user needs to send the storage credentials to the server.\n\n\n\n<p>It took me some time to discover the logic for the front-end, partly because it is a custom vanilla-js but react-like solution. At some point I read the discussion about keeping a React app or moving to vanilla-js, I don't like the new solution but hey, with open source is like this.</p><p>The router is located in . There are three routes we care about:</p><ul><li>, it uses  handler. This is the entry point, I don't want to type a complex path before viewing the content.</li><li>, it uses  handler and creates a cookie. This route is used when the user submits the credentials in the  page, which apparently is just a browser view in a SPA.</li><li>, it uses  handler. This is the endpoint the home page hits to know if the user is logged in, or more accurately, if the storage has been initialized, and then to decide what view to show accordingly. If the user is logged in the view will be the filesystem, otherwise it will be the login page.</li></ul><p>An important thing to notice is that each one of them uses a different set of middlewares. Most of them are not really important, but as I was trying to understand how things worked I found  and  were relevant.</p><p> injects the session for the request context, so even if a backend has been initialized, some session variables won't be available unless the route uses this middleware.</p><p> injects the body of the request into the context. Not sure why this is necessary, but it took me a while to figure that the  absence of  was breaking my code.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Hooks: The best place to inject my code\n</h3><p>It was not obvious to me where to put my code. The hooks system is not documented, I already knew the possible hooks, but I didn't know what were the entry points for those, also, at the beginning I didn't  know how the server persisted the state.</p><p>My initial thought was to use the  hook, since I wanted to start the backend before any request and keep it initialized, but then I found that this hook does not inject the  to their handlers, so I was not able to save the initialization once done.</p><p>Then I thought about using  or , to be honest I still don't know if I choose the right thing, even if my code will impact requests I don't really feel like it is a middleware, it should be run just once at the beginning, but there is an advantage of running it as middleware, and it is that I am able to send the cookie to the front-end once I finished initializing the backend.</p><p>So I ended up registering it as middleware but running it only once for the given path, this offers some flexibility but I am not totally happy with this solution.</p><p>My plugin doesn't need to do anything new, and I was aware of that, it was more about discovering where things were being done, and then see how much I was able to re-use, the main purpose was to slightly modify the app flow.</p><p>My biggest problem was to define what the flow should look like, with the usual flow you have a session because you have some state that is session dependent, in this case, the storage back-end is user defined, but if I want to have a fixed storage back-end I don't see the need for a session, maybe it is important in the server to keep a connection open for some time for the sake of efficiency, but from the user perspective, you don't need a session anymore. The implicit decision in this case is that the logout button that appears on the top right of the UI is not needed anymore.</p>\nThe login happens in the server without user input\n\n\n\n<p>This is a very important topic and one that usually is difficult to understand and to implement properly. I am not an expert in authentication but after ten years working with very different code bases I've seen many different ways to achieve the same things. Often in sub-optimal ways, some times I've helped improve the code, some other times I've not been able to convince the team the current solution is not optimal or even faulty, sometimes, I've only been able to detect the flaws retrospectively, after seeing it properly solved in a different company or after working it for myself in one of my projects.</p><p>Filestash offers some authorization middleware, and some authentication middleware, but I didn't manage to configure it properly. Even after disabling absolutely everything, there is the need for a session, both for the sake of efficiency and security. In the code it can be read something like  but it refers to the authorization from the point of view of the storage service provider, which could or could not be the same authorization that the app will use. As an example, for my use case, I would like to hide the storage provider authorization from the user of Filestash, which will be just me, al least initially.</p><p>This storage authorization is sent to the browser, probably for the lack of another method which would be implemented as part of the authorization or authentication middleware, but while I was exploring the code I didn't find flags to disable this to happen or to make it work in a different way but I am not 100 % sure if it cannot be done or simply I missed it.</p><p>The app saves everything in the App structure which is defined in  and often injected as the  parameter. And important note here is that there is a  field in the struct but it doesn't seem to be used for the session. Here are the four fields that were relevant for the plugin:</p><ul><li> saves a reference to the client used for accessing the storage.</li><li> is not used directly, but it is used by  by including  as a temporary storage for the POST body.</li><li> stores the credentials for connecting to the storage.</li><li> stores the same hash that is included in the cookie.</li></ul><p>At the moment there was nothing to be done, but at some point in the future I would like to add a route and a page to set there the login information and some other session parameters, like deciding in which page or pages inject the cookies, or the home directory for the storage.</p><p>The only part that we care about is <code>public/assets/pages/ctrl_homepage.js</code>, this is executed for the home page, that is the  path, and there a GET request to  is done to know if a session already exists.</p><p>The plugin does not modify this, but send the cookie in the  request so when the call to  is made the cookie is already there, without ever asking for the credentials, so the files are displayed.</p><p>Cookies are using to keep track of both the user and admin sessions. There is not much to say in this regard, still I think it is important to create a different section to make it visible. The functions for encrypting and decrypting are included in  and the secret used is defined in the settings section of the admin panel.</p><p>This is a basic plugin and there are still plenty of room for improvements, the most important thing is that currently this only works for s3 storage, which solves my problem but is very limited compared to the wide range of storage that Filestash support. Another nice thing to have would be a plugin configuration page, but for the moment it solves a problem. The next days I'll work in getting Filestash to work with a reverse proxy (Caddy) and deployed it to production.</p>","contentLength":11950,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null}],"tags":["go"]}
