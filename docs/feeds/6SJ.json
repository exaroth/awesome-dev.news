It‚Äôs a simple CLI tool that lets you grab templates straight from GitHub, TopTal, or even your own custom repository, all from the terminal. You can search through templates using a TUI interface, combine multiple ones like mixing Go and CLion, and even save your own locally so you don‚Äôt have to redo them every time. If you‚Äôre always setting up new projects and find yourself dealing with .gitignore files over and over, this just makes life a bit easier, hopefully. If that sounds useful, check it out <a href=\"https://github.com/jasonuc/gignr\">here</a> and give it a try. And if you‚Äôve got ideas to make the TUI better or want to add something cool, feel free to open a PR.

We can call the function again.\nres, _ = fn.Call(ctx, api.EncodeI32(b), api.EncodeI32(c))\nfmt.Printf(\"add(%d, %d) = %d\\n\", b, c, api.DecodeI32(res[0]))\n</code></pre><p>The  directive and the reactor build mode allow applications to\nbe extended by calling into Go-based Wasm code.\nThis is particularly valuable for applications that have adopted Wasm as a\nplugin or extension mechanism with well-defined interfaces.\nBy exporting Go functions, applications can leverage the Go Wasm modules to\nprovide functionality without needing to recompile the entire application.\nFurthermore, building as a reactor ensures that the exported functions can be\ncalled multiple times without requiring reinitialization, making it suitable\nfor long-running applications or services.</p><h2>Supporting rich types between the host and the client</h2><p>Go 1.24 also relaxes the constraints on types that can be used as input and\nresult parameters with  functions.\nFor example, one can pass a bool, a string, a pointer to an , or a\npointer to a struct which embeds  and contains supported\nfield types\n(see the <a href=\"https://go.dev/cmd/compile#hdr-WebAssembly_Directives\">documentation</a> for detail).\nThis allows Go Wasm applications to be written in a more natural and ergonomic\nway, and removes some unnecessary type conversions.</p><p>While Go 1.24 has made significant enhancements to its Wasm capabilities,\nthere are still some notable limitations.</p><p>Wasm is a single-threaded architecture with no parallelism.\nA  function can spawn new goroutines.\nBut if a function creates a background goroutine, it will not continue\nexecuting when the  function returns, until calling back into\nthe Go-based Wasm module.</p><p>While some type restrictions have been relaxed in Go 1.24, there are still\nlimitations on the types that can be used with  and\n functions.\nDue to the unfortunate mismatch between the 64-bit architecture of the client\nand the 32-bit architecture of the host, it is not possible to pass pointers in\nmemory.\nFor example, a  function cannot take a pointer to a struct that\ncontains a pointer-typed field.</p><p>The addition of the ability to build a WASI reactor and export Go functions to\nWasm in Go 1.24 represent a significant step forward for Go‚Äôs WebAssembly\ncapabilities.\nThese features empower developers to create more versatile and powerful Go-based\nWasm applications, opening up new possibilities for Go in the Wasm ecosystem.</p>","contentLength":5777,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Go 1.24 arrives","url":"https://golangweekly.com/issues/542","date":1739318400,"author":"","guid":300,"unread":true,"content":"<li><p><a href=\"https://golangweekly.com/link/165684/rss\">DB Fiddle</a> is a handy online database 'sandbox' for playing with various versions of MySQL, Postgres, and SQLite direct from the browser.</p></li>","contentLength":136,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Go 1.24 is released!","url":"https://go.dev/blog/go1.24","date":1739232000,"author":"Junyang Shao, on behalf of the Go team","guid":93,"unread":true,"content":"<div data-slug=\"/blog/go1.24\"><p>\n      Junyang Shao, on behalf of the Go team\n      11 February 2025\n      </p><p>Today the Go team is excited to release Go 1.24,\nwhich you can get by visiting the <a href=\"https://go.dev/dl/\">download page</a>.</p><p>Go 1.24 comes with many improvements over Go 1.23.
