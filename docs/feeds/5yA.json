The AI landscape is constantly evolving, with new models pushing the boundaries of what's possible. But one name has been making waves recently, i.e, . Unlike other AI tools, this powerhouse has rewritten the rulebook on efficiency, cost-effectiveness, and performance. If you haven't heard of it yet, here‚Äôs why it‚Äôs capturing global attention.</p><h3><strong>What Is DeepSeek and Why Is It Gaining Popularity?</strong></h3><p>In January 2025, DeepSeek, a Chinese AI company, emerged as a major player in the AI space. Developed by a Chinese AI lab, it rapidly climbed the app store rankings, even surpassing ChatGPT as the most popular free AI assistant in the US.\nBut what‚Äôs driving the hype? DeepSeek-R1 isn‚Äôt just another AI model‚Äîit‚Äôs an example of cutting-edge efficiency at a fraction of the usual cost. Unlike its competitors, which require massive investments,  was trained for just ‚Äîa game-changing breakthrough in AI development.</p><h3><strong>Innovation Behind DeepSeek</strong></h3><p>DeepSeek‚Äôs strength lies in its  training method, which splits its AI into specialized sub-models. Instead of a single large neural network handling everything, each part of DeepSeek is optimized for specific tasks, making it both  and more .\nAnother key advantage is its , which adjusts processing power based on task complexity. This means DeepSeek can deliver high performance while using significantly fewer resources compared to other models.</p><p>Moreover, instead of relying on Nvidia‚Äôs high-end H100 chips, DeepSeek utilizes the more affordable , making AI training and deployment  cheaper than models like </p><h3><strong>DeepSeek-R1 helping open-source community</strong></h3><p>DeepSeek released its flagship model, DeepSeek-R1, under the . This model, developed with remarkable resource efficiency‚Äîusing approximately 2,000 Nvidia H800 GPUs over 55 days demonstrated performance on par with leading AI models from established tech giants. DeepSeek has made significant strides in the artificial intelligence landscape by open-sourcing its advanced AI models. \nThe open-source release of DeepSeek-R1 has lowered barriers to AI development, fostering innovation and competition across the global AI community. The company has also released models like , designed to enhance code intelligence, and , aimed at advancing vision-language understanding. These models are available for public use and modification, promoting transparency and collaboration in AI research and application.</p><h3><strong>How DeepSeek Outperforms Other AI Models</strong></h3><p>Beyond its efficiency, DeepSeek is redefining AI reliability with its R1 Reasoning Model. Unlike traditional models, the probability of the R1 Reasoning Model giving appealing outputs is much higher as compared to other available models since this model is designed to validate its own reasoning supporting its output, improving accuracy in subjects like math, science, and fact-checking.\nThis makes DeepSeek particularly powerful for research, problem-solving, and advanced computations, offering a level of precision that many AI models like  from OpenAI,  from MetaAI, and  from Google, etc struggle to achieve.</p><h3><strong>Challenges and Limitations</strong></h3><p>Despite its impressive capabilities, DeepSeek isn‚Äôt without challenges. Its business model remains uncertain, as it offers services at a significantly lower cost than competitors, raising questions about long-term sustainability. If integrated into government or corporate infrastructure, DeepSeek AI could be exploited for surveillance by foreign adversaries, affecting nation's cybersecurity. Although being open-source, certain components of the model (e.g., training datasets and fine-tuned versions) might be controlled by external entities, leading to potential data leaks.\nAdditionally, being developed in China, DeepSeek follows strict content regulations. Topics such as <strong>Taiwan‚Äôs political status</strong> or the <strong>Tiananmen Square incident</strong> are restricted due to Chinese internet policies, which may affect its global adaptability.</p><h3><strong>What‚Äôs Next for DeepSeek and AI?</strong></h3><p>DeepSeek‚Äôs rise proves that bigger isn‚Äôt always better. With its cost-effective approach, rapid deployment, and self-reasoning abilities, it‚Äôs challenging industry giants and setting a new standard for AI development.\nWhether you‚Äôre a developer, researcher, or AI enthusiast, DeepSeek is worth watching.

The term \"malware\" is derived from two words: \"mal,\" meaning malicious, and \"ware,\" meaning software, forming the word \"malware.\"</p><p>Typically, malware is created by illegal hackers, commonly known as black hat hackers. These programs are highly capable and can cause severe damage to both organizations and individuals. Once installed on a device, malware exploits it by accessing messages, call logs, browser history, and even bank balances or other sensitive information.</p><p>Once again, malware consists of illegal software used by black hat hackers and crackers. There are various types of malware, mainly viruses, spyware, trojans, ransomware, keyloggers, and worms. In this discussion, we will explore them in detail.</p><p>Here are some common types of malwares that can destroy your pc</p><p>\nViruses are malicious programs specifically designed to attach themselves to files or documents and execute when the infected file is opened. As a result, they can harm your system, slow down performance, and even steal sensitive information.</p><p>\nSpyware is a malicious piece of code created to collect information from a system and spy on it without the user's knowledge or consent. This includes passwords, social information, and even bank details. Spyware is commonly found in unauthorized third-party applications.</p><p>\nA Trojan is a malicious piece of code that appears to be legitimate software. However, once mistakenly installed by a user, it operates in the background and gains system access to perform malicious activities. Trojans are often embedded in third-party apps, games, documents, software patches, and even emails.</p><p>\nRansomware is one of the most powerful and dangerous types of malware. It encrypts a target‚Äôs data and demands a ransom payment in exchange for decryption. Once a system is infected, recovering the data without paying the ransom is nearly impossible (at least for now).</p><p>\nA keylogger is a malicious program specifically designed to capture a user's keystrokes in real-time. This means anything you type on your keyboard can be recorded, including personal details and sensitive social media credentials.</p><p>To protect yourself from malware, follow these preventive measures:</p><ol><li>Remember, nothing is 100% secure! Always stay cautious.\nChoose a robust antivirus program like Avast, Norton, AVG, or Kaspersky.</li><li>Regularly back up your data to avoid losing important files.</li><li>Avoid installing third-party software whenever possible.</li><li>Scan files before use with VirusTotal if you must use third-party software (not recommended).</li><li>Stay away from cracked software, as it is often infected with malware.</li><li>Never download unauthorized files from the internet, as they may contain hidden threats.</li><li>Use a secure and updated browser, such as Tor, Firefox, Edge, or Opera.</li><li>Keep your operating system updated to protect against vulnerabilities.</li><li>Stay informed and educate others about cyber threats to enhance digital security.</li></ol><p>In this discussion, we explored what malware is and how destructive it can be. This was just a glimpse‚Äîthere are many other types of malware that were not included here. However, these are some of the most common and stable malware threats.</p><p>Always try to use authentic software, files, and systems, and educate others about cyber threats. Stay up to date with the latest security practices because no one is ever 100% safe online.</p>","contentLength":3429,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"[R] A Survey of Logical Reasoning Capabilities in Large Language Models: Frameworks, Methods, and Evaluation","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1iqmjal/r_a_survey_of_logical_reasoning_capabilities_in/","date":1739688936,"author":"/u/Successful-Western27","guid":522,"unread":true,"content":"<p>This new survey provides a comprehensive analysis of logical reasoning capabilities in LLMs, examining different reasoning types, evaluation methods, and current limitations.</p><p>Key technical aspects: - Categorizes logical reasoning into deductive, inductive, and abductive frameworks - Evaluates performance across multiple benchmarks and testing methodologies - Analyzes the relationship between model size and reasoning capability - Reviews techniques for improving logical reasoning, including prompt engineering and chain-of-thought methods</p><p>Main findings: - LLMs show strong performance on basic logical tasks but struggle with complex multi-step reasoning - Model size alone doesn't determine reasoning ability - training methods and problem-solving strategies play crucial roles - Current evaluation methods may not effectively distinguish between true reasoning and pattern matching - Performance degrades significantly when problems require combining multiple reasoning types</p><p>I think the most important contribution here is the systematic breakdown of where current models succeed and fail at logical reasoning.

My great-grandad was an engineer, both my grandparents studied physics, and my mum is a maths teacher.</p><p><em>So, my path was always paved for me.</em></p><p>I chose to study physics at university after watching The Big Bang Theory at age 12; it‚Äôs fair to say everyone was very proud!</p><p>At school, I wasn‚Äôt dumb by any means. I was actually relatively bright, but I didn‚Äôt fully apply myself. I got decent grades, but definitely not what I was fully capable of.</p><p>I was very arrogant and thought I would do well with zero work.</p><p>I applied to top universities like Oxford and Imperial College, but given my work ethic, I was delusional thinking I had a chance. On results day, I ended up in clearing as I missed my offers. This was probably one of the saddest days of my life.</p><p>Clearing in the UK is where universities offer places to students on certain courses where they have space. It‚Äôs mainly for students who don‚Äôt have a university offer.</p><p>I was lucky enough to be offered a chance to study physics at the University of Surrey, and I went on to earn a first-class master‚Äôs degree in physics!</p><p>There is genuinely no substitute for hard work. It is a cringy cliche, but it is true!</p><p>My original plan was to do a PhD and be a full-time researcher or professor, but during my degree, I did a research year, and I just felt a career in research was not for me. Everything moved so slowly, and it didn‚Äôt seem there was much opportunity in the space.</p><p>During this time, DeepMind released their<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXuK6gekU1Y&amp;t=1539s\"></a>documentary on YouTube, which popped up on my home feed.</p><p>From the video, I started to understand how AI worked and learn about neural networks, reinforcement learning, and deep learning. To be honest, to this day I am still not an expert in these areas.</p><p>Naturally, I dug deeper and found that a data scientist uses AI and machine learning algorithms to solve problems. I immediately wanted in and started applying for data science graduate roles.</p><p>I spent countless hours coding, taking courses, and working on projects. I applied to and eventually landed my first data science graduate scheme in September 2021.</p><p><em>You can hear more about my journey from a <a href=\"https://tobeadatascientist.substack.com/p/overcoming-rejection-lessons-from-egor-howell\">podcast</a>.</em></p><p>I started my career in an insurance company, where I built various supervised learning models, mainly using gradient boosted tree packages like CatBoost, XGBoost, and<a href=\"https://medium.com/towards-data-science/breaking-down-generalized-linear-models-d9212526e51d?sk=fda0298cebcb8e9e0c20cb6af8ed4f06\"> generalised linear models (GLMs)</a>.</p><p>I built models to predict:</p><ul><li>‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäDid someone fraudulently make a claim to profit.</li><li>‚Äî‚ÄäWhat‚Äôs the premium we should give someone.</li><li>‚Äî‚ÄäHow many claims will someone have.</li><li>‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäWhat‚Äôs the average claim value someone will have.</li></ul><p>I made around six models spanning the regression and classification space. I learned so much here, especially in statistics, as I worked very closely with Actuaries, so my maths knowledge was excellent.</p><p>However, due to the company‚Äôs structure and setup, it was difficult for my models to advance past the PoC stage, so I felt I lacked the ‚Äútech‚Äù side of my toolkit and understanding of how companies use machine learning in production.</p><p>After a year, my previous employer reached out to me asking if I wanted to apply to a junior data scientist role that specialises in<a href=\"https://medium.com/@egorhowell/list/time-series-00bbfb9f5359\"> time series forecasting</a> and<a href=\"https://medium.com/@egorhowell/list/optimisation-algorithms-069bf9c6c8d5\"> optimisation</a> problems. I really liked the company, and after a few interviews, I was offered the job!</p><p>I worked at this company for about 2.5 years, where I became an expert in forecasting and combinatorial optimisation problems.</p><p>I developed many algorithms and deployed my models to production through AWS using software engineering best practices, such as unit testing, lower environment, shadow system, CI/CD pipelines, and much more.</p><p><em>Fair to say I learned a lot.&nbsp;</em></p><p>I worked very closely with software engineers, so I picked up a lot of engineering knowledge and continued self-studying machine learning and statistics on the side.</p><p>Over time, I realised the actual value of data science is using it to make live decisions. There is a good quote by<a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/posts/pau-labarta-bajo-4432074b_machinelearning-mlops-realworldml-activity-7195694289178214400-gZyw\"> Pau Labarta Bajo</a></p><p>ML models inside Jupyter notebooks have a business value of $0</p><p>There is no point in building a really complex and sophisticated model if it will not produce results. Seeking out that extra 0.1% accuracy by staking multiple models is often not worth it.</p><p>You are better off building something simple that you can deploy, and that will bring real financial benefit to the company.</p><p>With this in mind, I started thinking about the future of data science. In my head, there are two avenues:</p><ul><li> -&gt; You work primarily to gain insight into what the business should be doing and what it should be looking into to boost its performance.</li><li> -&gt; You ship solutions (models, decision algorithms, etc.) that bring business value.</li></ul><p>I feel the data scientist who analyses and builds PoC models will become extinct in the next few years because, as we said above, they don‚Äôt provide tangible value to a business.</p><p>That‚Äôs not to say they are entirely useless; you have to think of it from the business perspective of their return on investment. Ideally, the value you bring in should be more than your salary.</p><p>You want to say that you did ‚ÄúX that produced Y‚Äù, which the above two avenues allow you to do.</p><p>The engineering side was the most interesting and enjoyable for me. I genuinely enjoy coding and building stuff that benefits people, and that they can use, so naturally, that‚Äôs where I gravitated towards.</p><p>To move to the ML engineering side, I asked my line manager if I could deploy the algorithms and ML models I was building myself. I would get help from software engineers, but I would write all the production code, do my own system design, and set up the deployment process independently.</p><p><em>And that‚Äôs exactly what I did.</em></p><p>Coincidentally, my current employer contacted me around this time and asked if I wanted to apply for a machine learning engineer role that specialises in general ML and optimisation at their company!</p><p>Call it luck, but clearly, the universe was telling me something. After several interview rounds, I was offered the role, and I am now a fully fledged machine learning engineer!</p><p>Fortunately, a role kind of ‚Äúfell to me,‚Äù but I created my own luck through up-skilling and documenting my learning. That is why I always tell people to show their work‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääyou don‚Äôt know what may come from it.</p><p>I want to share the main bits of advice that helped me transition from a machine learning engineer to a data scientist.</p><ul><li>‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäA machine learning engineer is  an entry-level position in my opinion. You need to be well-versed in data science, machine learning, software engineering, etc. You don‚Äôt need to be an expert in all of them, but have good fundamentals across the board. That‚Äôs why I recommend having a couple of years of experience as either a software engineer or data scientist and self-study other areas.</li><li>‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäIf you are from data science, you must learn to write good, well-tested production code. You must know things like typing, linting, unit tests, formatting, mocking and CI/CD. It‚Äôs not too difficult, but it just requires some practice. I recommend asking your current company to work with software engineers to gain this knowledge, it worked for me!</li><li>‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäMost companies nowadays deploy many of their architecture and systems on the cloud, and machine learning models are no exception. So, it‚Äôs best to get practice with these tools and understand how they enable models to go live. I learned most of this on the job, to be honest, but there are courses you can take.</li><li>‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäI am sure most of you know this already, but every tech professional should be proficient in the command line. You will use it extensively when deploying and writing production code. I have a basic guide you can checkout<a href=\"https://medium.com/towards-data-science/an-introduction-to-the-shell-676ee5b899df?sk=0c6e101165b4314b98ab39d11525366c\"> here</a>.</li><li><strong>Data Structures &amp; Algorithms‚Ää</strong>‚Äî‚ÄäUnderstanding the fundamental algorithms in computer science are very useful for MLE roles. Mainly because you will likely be asked about it in interviews. It‚Äôs not too hard to learn compared to machine learning; it just takes time. Any course will do the trick.</li><li>‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäAgain, most tech professionals should know Git, but as an MLE, it is essential. How to squash commits, do code reviews, and write outstanding pull requests are musts.</li><li>‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäMany MLE roles I saw required you to have some specialisation in a particular area. I specialise in time series forecasting, optimisation, and general ML based on my previous experience. This helps you stand out in the market, and most companies are looking for specialists nowadays.</li></ul><p>The main theme here is that I basically up-skilled my software engineering abilities. This makes sense as I already had all the math, stats, and machine learning knowledge from being a data scientist.</p><p>If I were a software engineer, the transition would likely be the reverse. This is why securing a machine learning engineer role can be quite challenging, as it requires proficiency across a wide range of skills.</p><h3><strong>Summary &amp; Further Thoughts</strong></h3><p>I have a free newsletter, <a href=\"https://dishingthedata.substack.com/\"></a>, where I share weekly tips and advice as a practising data scientist.

Instead of directly listing specific competencies to develop and the motivation behind mastering them, I will briefly outline the most important approaches, presenting them in chronological order as they have been developed and used over the past decades in machine learning.</p><p>The reason is that I believe it is crucial to study these algorithms from the very beginning. In machine learning, many new methods are built upon older approaches, which is especially true for <a href=\"https://towardsdatascience.com/tag/nlp/\" title=\"NLP\">NLP</a> and computer vision.</p><p>For example, jumping directly into the implementation details of modern&nbsp;large language models (LLMs)&nbsp;without any preliminary knowledge may make it very difficult for beginners to grasp the motivation and underlying ideas of specific mechanisms.</p><p><em>Given this, in the next two sections, I will highlight in&nbsp;</em><em>&nbsp;the key concepts that should be studied.</em></p><p><strong>Natural language processing (NLP)</strong>&nbsp;is a broad field that focuses on processing textual information. Machine learning algorithms cannot work directly with raw text, which is why text is usually preprocessed and converted into numerical vectors that are then fed into neural networks.</p><p>Before being converted into vectors, words undergo&nbsp;, which includes simple techniques such as&nbsp;,&nbsp;<strong>stemming, lemmatization, normalization</strong>, or removing&nbsp;. After preprocessing, the resulting text is encoded into&nbsp;. Tokens represent the smallest textual elements in a collection of documents. Generally, a token can be a part of a word, a sequence of symbols, or an individual symbol. Ultimately, tokens are converted into numerical vectors.</p><p>The&nbsp;&nbsp;method is the most basic way to encode tokens, focusing on counting the frequency of tokens in each document. However, in practice, this is usually not sufficient, as it is also necessary to account for token importance ‚Äî a concept introduced in the&nbsp;&nbsp;and&nbsp;&nbsp;methods. While TF-IDF improves upon the naive counting approach of bag of words, researchers have developed a completely new approach called embeddings.</p><p>&nbsp;are numerical vectors whose components preserve the semantic meanings of words. Because of this, embeddings play a crucial role in NLP, enabling input data to be trained or used for model inference. Additionally, embeddings can be used to compare text similarity, allowing for the retrieval of the most relevant documents from a collection.</p><blockquote><p><em>Embeddings can also be used to encode other unstructured data, including images, audio, and videos.</em></p></blockquote><p>As a field, NLP has been evolving rapidly over the last 10‚Äì20 years to efficiently solve various text-related problems. Complex tasks like text translation and text generation were initially addressed using&nbsp;<strong>recurrent neural networks (RNNs)</strong>, which introduced the concept of memory, allowing neural networks to capture and retain key contextual information in long documents.</p><p>Although RNN performance gradually improved, it remained suboptimal for certain tasks. Moreover, RNNs are relatively slow, and their sequential prediction process does not allow for parallelization during training and inference, making them less efficient.</p><p>Additionally, the original Transformer architecture can be decomposed into two separate modules:&nbsp;&nbsp;and&nbsp;. Both of these form the foundation of the most state-of-the-art models used today to solve various NLP problems. Understanding their principles is valuable knowledge that will help learners advance further when studying or working with other&nbsp;<strong>large language models (LLMs)</strong>.</p><p>When it comes to LLMs, I strongly recommend studying the evolution of at least the first three GPT models, as they have had a significant impact on the AI world we know today. In particular, I would like to highlight the concepts of&nbsp;&nbsp;and&nbsp;, introduced in&nbsp;GPT-2, which enable LLMs to solve text generation tasks without explicitly receiving any training examples for them.</p><p>Another important technique developed in recent years is&nbsp;<strong>retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)</strong>.&nbsp;<em>The main limitation of LLMs is that they are only aware of the context used during their training.</em>&nbsp;As a result, they lack knowledge of any information beyond their training data.</p><p>The retriever converts the input prompt into an embedding, which is then used to query a vector database. The database returns the most relevant context based on the similarity to the embedding. This retrieved context is then combined with the original prompt and passed to a generative model. The model processes both the initial prompt and the additional context to generate a more informed and contextually accurate response.</p><blockquote><p><em>A good example of this limitation is the first version of the ChatGPT model, which was trained on data up to the year 2022 and had no knowledge of events that occurred from 2023 onward.</em></p></blockquote><p>To address this limitation, OpenAI researchers developed a RAG pipeline, which includes a constantly updated database containing new information from external sources. When ChatGPT is given a task that requires external knowledge, it queries the database to retrieve the most relevant context and integrates it into the final prompt sent to the machine learning model.</p><p>The goal of distillation is to create a smaller model that can imitate a larger one. In practice, this means that if a large model makes a prediction, the smaller model is expected to produce a similar result.</p><p>In the modern era, LLM development has led to models with millions or even billions of parameters. As a consequence, the overall size of these models may exceed the hardware limitations of standard computers or small portable devices, which come with many constraints.</p><p>Quantization is the process of reducing the memory required to store numerical values representing a model‚Äôs weights.</p><p>This is where optimization techniques become particularly useful, allowing LLMs to be compressed without significantly compromising their performance. The most commonly used techniques today include&nbsp;,, and&nbsp;.</p><p>Pruning refers to discarding the least important weights of a model.</p><p>Regardless of the area in which you wish to specialize, knowledge of&nbsp;&nbsp;is a must-have skill! Fine-tuning is a powerful concept that allows you to efficiently adapt a pre-trained model to a new task.</p><p>Fine-tuning is especially useful when working with very large models. For example, imagine you want to use BERT to perform semantic analysis on a specific dataset. While BERT is trained on general data, it might not fully understand the context of your dataset. At the same time, training BERT from scratch for your specific task would require a massive amount of resources.</p><p>Here is where fine-tuning comes in: it involves taking a pre-trained BERT (or another model) and freezing some of its layers (usually those at the beginning). As a result, BERT is retrained, but this time only on the new dataset provided. Since BERT updates only a subset of its weights and the new dataset is likely much smaller than the original one BERT was trained on, fine-tuning becomes a very efficient technique for adapting BERT‚Äôs rich knowledge to a specific domain.</p><blockquote><p><em>Fine-tuning is widely used not only in NLP but also across many other domains.</em></p></blockquote><p>As the name suggests,&nbsp;&nbsp;involves analyzing images and videos using machine learning. The most common tasks include image classification, object detection, image segmentation, and generation.</p><p>Most CV algorithms are based on neural networks, so it is essential to understand how they work in detail. In particular, CV uses a special type of network called&nbsp;<strong>convolutional neural networks (CNNs)</strong>. These are similar to fully connected networks, except that they typically begin with a set of specialized mathematical operations called&nbsp;.</p><blockquote><p><em>In simple terms, convolutions act as filters, enabling the model to extract the most important features from an image, which are then passed to fully connected layers for further analysis.</em></p></blockquote><p>The next step is to study the most popular CNN architectures for classification tasks, such as&nbsp;<strong>AlexNet, VGG, Inception, ImageNet</strong>, and&nbsp;.</p><p>Speaking of the object detection task, the&nbsp;&nbsp;algorithm is a clear winner. It is not necessary to study all of the dozens of versions of YOLO. In reality, going through the original paper of the first YOLO should be sufficient to understand how a relatively difficult problem like object detection is elegantly transformed into both classification and regression problems. This approach in YOLO also provides a nice intuition on how more complex CV tasks can be reformulated in simpler terms.</p><p>While there are many architectures for performing image segmentation, I would strongly recommend learning about&nbsp;, which introduces an encoder-decoder architecture.</p><p>Finally, image generation is probably one of the most challenging tasks in CV. Personally, I consider it an optional topic for learners, as it involves many advanced concepts. Nevertheless, gaining a high-level intuition of how&nbsp;<strong>generative adversial networks (GAN)</strong>&nbsp;function to generate images is a good way to broaden one‚Äôs horizons.</p><blockquote><p><em>In some problems, the training data might not be enough to build a performant model. In such cases, the data augmentation technique is commonly used. It involves the artificial generation of training data from already existing data (images). By feeding the model more diverse data, it becomes capable of learning and recognizing more patterns.</em></p></blockquote><p>It would be very hard to present in detail the <a href=\"https://towardsdatascience.com/tag/roadmaps/\" title=\"Roadmaps\">Roadmaps</a> for all existing machine learning domains in a single article. That is why, in this section, I would like to briefly list and explain some of the other most popular areas in data science worth exploring.</p><p>First of all,&nbsp;<strong>recommender systems (RecSys)</strong>&nbsp;have gained a lot of popularity in recent years. They are increasingly implemented in online shops, social networks, and streaming services. The key idea of most algorithms is to take a large initial matrix of all users and items and decompose it into a product of several matrices in a way that associates every user and every item with a high-dimensional embedding. This approach is very flexible, as it then allows different types of comparison operations on embeddings to find the most relevant items for a given user. Moreover, it is much more rapid to perform analysis on small matrices rather than the original, which usually tends to have huge dimensions.</p><p> often goes hand in hand with RecSys. When a RecSys has identified a set of the most relevant items for the user, ranking algorithms are used to sort them to determine the order in which they will be shown or proposed to the user. A good example of their usage is search engines, which filter query results from top to bottom on a web page.</p><p>Closely related to ranking, there is also a&nbsp;&nbsp;problem that aims to optimally map objects from two sets, A and B, in a way that, on average, every object pair&nbsp;is mapped ‚Äúwell‚Äù according to a matching criterion. A use case example might include distributing a group of students to different university disciplines, where the number of spots in each class is limited.</p><p>&nbsp;is an unsupervised machine learning task whose objective is to split a dataset into several regions (clusters), with each dataset object belonging to one of these clusters. The splitting criteria can vary depending on the task. Clustering is useful because it allows for grouping similar objects together. Moreover, further analysis can be applied to treat objects in each cluster separately.</p><p>The goal of clustering is to group dataset objects (on the left) into several categories (on the right) based on their similarity.</p><p>&nbsp;is another unsupervised problem, where the goal is to compress an input dataset. When the dimensionality of the dataset is large, it takes more time and resources for machine learning algorithms to analyze it. By identifying and removing noisy dataset features or those that do not provide much valuable information, the data analysis process becomes considerably easier.</p><p>&nbsp;is an area that focuses on designing algorithms and data structures (indexes) to optimize searches in a large database of embeddings (vector database). More precisely, given an input embedding and a vector database, the goal is to&nbsp;&nbsp;find the most similar embedding in the database relative to the input embedding.</p><p>The goal of similarity search is to approximately find the most similar embedding in a vector database relative to a query embedding.</p><p>The word ‚Äúapproximately‚Äù means that the search is not guaranteed to be 100% precise. Nevertheless, this is the main idea behind similarity search algorithms ‚Äî sacrificing a bit of accuracy in exchange for significant gains in prediction speed or data compression.</p><p>&nbsp;involves studying the behavior of a target variable over time. This problem can be solved using classical tabular algorithms. However, the presence of time introduces new factors that cannot be captured by standard algorithms. For instance:</p><ul><li>the target variable can have an overall&nbsp;, where in the long term its values increase or decrease&nbsp;<em>(e.g., the average yearly temperature rising due to global warming)</em>.</li><li>the target variable can have a&nbsp;&nbsp;which makes its values change based on the currently given period&nbsp;<em>(e.g. temperature is lower in winter and higher in summer)</em>.</li></ul><p>Most of the time series models take both of these factors into account. In general, time series models are mainly used a lot in financial, stock or demographic analysis.</p><p>Another advanced area I would recommend exploring is&nbsp;, which fundamentally changes the algorithm design compared to classical machine learning.&nbsp;In simple terms, its goal is to train an agent in an environment to make optimal decisions based on a reward system (also known as the&nbsp;<em>‚Äútrial and error approach‚Äù</em>).&nbsp;By taking an action, the agent receives a reward, which helps it understand whether the chosen action had a positive or negative effect.&nbsp;After that, the agent slightly adjusts its strategy, and the entire cycle repeats.</p><p>Reinforcement learning is particularly popular in complex environments where classical algorithms are not capable of solving a problem.&nbsp;Given the complexity of reinforcement learning algorithms and the computational resources they require, this area is not yet fully mature, but it has high potential to gain even more popularity in the future.</p><p>Currently the most popular applications are:</p><ul><li>.&nbsp;Existing approaches can design optimal game strategies and outperform humans.&nbsp;The most well-known examples are chess and Go.</li><li>.&nbsp;Advanced algorithms can be incorporated into robots to help them move, carry objects or complete routine tasks at home.</li><li>.&nbsp;Reinforcement learning methods can be developed to automatically drive cars, control helicopters or drones.</li></ul><p>This article was a logical continuation of the previous part and expanded the skill set needed to become a data scientist. While most of the mentioned topics require time to master, they can add significant value to your portfolio. This is especially true for the NLP and CV domains, which are in high demand today.</p><blockquote><p>After reaching a high level of expertise in data science, it is still crucial to stay motivated and consistently push yourself to learn new topics and explore emerging algorithms.</p></blockquote><p>Data science is a constantly evolving field, and in the coming years, we might witness the development of new state-of-the-art approaches that we could not have imagined in the past.</p><p><em>All images are by the author unless noted otherwise.</em></p>","contentLength":17044,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Publish Interactive Data Visualizations for Free with Python and Marimo","url":"https://towardsdatascience.com/publish-interactive-data-visualizations-for-free-with-python-and-marimo/","date":1739548800,"author":"Sam Minot","guid":8,"unread":true,"content":"<p>Working in <a href=\"https://towardsdatascience.com/tag/data-science/\" title=\"Data Science\">Data Science</a>, it can be hard to share insights from complex datasets using only static figures.

While we have powerful technologies available for presenting interactive figures‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääwhere a viewer can rotate, filter, zoom, and generally explore complex data‚Ää ‚Äî‚Ää they always come with tradeoffs.</p><p>Here I present my experience using a recently released Python library‚Ää‚Äî‚Ää<a href=\"https://marimo.io\">marimo</a>‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääwhich opens up exciting new opportunities for publishing interactive visualizations across the entire field of data science.</p><h2>Interactive Data Visualization</h2><p>The tradeoffs to consider when selecting an approach for presenting data visualizations can be broken into three categories:</p><ul><li>‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääwhat visualizations and interactivity am I able to present to the user?</li><li>‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääwhat are the resources needed for displaying this visualization to users (e.g. running servers, hosting websites)?</li><li> ‚Äì how much of a new skillset / codebase do I need to learn upfront?</li></ul><p> is the foundation of portable interactivity. Every user has a web browser installed on their computer and there are many different frameworks available for displaying any degree of interactivity or visualization you might imagine (for example, this <a href=\"https://threejs.org/\">gallery of amazing things people have made with three.js</a>). Since the application is running on the user‚Äôs computer, no costly servers are needed. However, a significant drawback for the data science community is ease of use, as JS does not have many of the high-level (i.e. easy-to-use) libraries that data scientists use for data manipulation, plotting, and interactivity.</p><p> provides a useful point of comparison. Because of its <a href=\"https://flatironschool.com/blog/python-popularity-the-rise-of-a-global-programming-language/\">continually growing popularity</a>, some have called this the <a href=\"https://towardsdatascience.com/we-are-living-in-the-era-of-python-bc032d595f6a\">‚ÄúEra of Python‚Äù</a>. For data scientists in particular, Python stands alongside R as one of the foundational languages for quickly and effectively wielding complex data. While Python may be easier to use than Javascript, there are fewer options for presenting interactive visualizations. Some popular projects providing interactivity and visualization have been <a href=\"https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/stable/\">Flask</a>, <a href=\"https://dash.plotly.com/\">Dash</a>, and <a href=\"https://streamlit.io/\">Streamlit</a> (also worth mentioning‚Ää‚Äî‚Ää<a href=\"https://docs.bokeh.org/en/latest/docs/gallery.html\">bokeh</a>, <a href=\"https://holoviews.org/\">HoloViews</a>, <a href=\"https://altair-viz.github.io/altair-tutorial/README.html\">altair</a>, and <a href=\"https://plotly.com/python/\">plotly</a>). The biggest tradeoff for using Python has been the cost for publishing ‚Äì delivering the tool to users. In the same way that <a href=\"https://www.shinyapps.io/\">shinyapps</a> require a running computer to serve up the visualization, these Python-based frameworks have exclusively been server-based. This is by no means prohibitive for authors with a budget to spend, but it does limit the number of users who can take advantage of a particular project.</p><p><a href=\"https://pyodide.org/en/stable/\"></a> is an intriguing middle ground‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäPython code running directly in the web browser using <a href=\"https://webassembly.org/\">WebAssembly</a> (WASM). There are resource limitations (only 1 thread and 2GB memory) that make this impractical for doing the heavy lifting of data science. , this can be more than sufficient for building visualizations and updating based on user input. Because it runs in the browser, no servers are required for hosting. Tools that use Pyodide as a foundation are interesting to explore because they give data scientists an opportunity to write Python code which runs directly on users‚Äô computers without their having to install or run anything outside of the web browser.</p><p>As an aside, <a href=\"https://towardsdatascience.com/python-based-data-viz-with-no-installation-required-aaf2358c881\">I‚Äôve been interested previously in</a> one project that has tried this approach: <a href=\"https://github.com/whitphx/stlite\">stlite</a>, <a href=\"https://edit.share.stlite.net/\">an in-browser implementation of Streamlit</a> that lets you deploy these flexible and powerful apps to a broad range of users. However, a core limitation is that Streamlit itself is distinct from stlite (the port of Streamlit to WASM), which means that not all features are supported and that advancement of the project is dependent on two separate groups working along compatible lines.</p><ul><li>The interface resembles a Jupyter , which will be familiar to users.</li><li>Execution of cells is , so that updating one cell will rerun all cells which depend on its output.</li><li> can be captured with a flexible set of UI components.</li><li>Notebooks can be quickly converted into , hiding the code and showing only the input/output elements.</li><li>Apps can be run locally or converted into using WASM/Pyodide.</li></ul><p>marimo balances the tradeoffs of technology in a way that is well suited to the skill set of the typical data scientists:</p><ul><li>‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääuser input and visual display features are rather extensive, <a href=\"https://docs.marimo.io/guides/working_with_data/plotting/#reactive-plots\">supporting user input</a> via Altair and Plotly plots.</li><li>‚Ää‚Äî‚Äädeploying as static webpages is basically free‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääno servers required</li><li>‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääfor users familiar with Python notebooks, marimo will feel very familiar and be easy to pick up.</li></ul><h2>Publishing Marimo Apps on the Web</h2><p>As a simple example of the type of display that can be useful in data science, consisting of explanatory text interspersed with interactive displays, I have created a barebones <a href=\"https://github.com/FredHutch/marimo-publication\">GitHub repository</a>. Try it out yourself <a href=\"https://fredhutch.github.io/marimo-publication/\">here</a>.</p><p>Using just a little bit of code, users can:</p><ul><li>Generate visualizations with flexible interactivity</li><li>Write narrative text describing their findings</li><li>Publish to the web for free (i.e. using GitHub Pages)</li></ul><h2>Public App / Private Data</h2><p>This new technology offers an exciting new opportunity for collaboration‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääpublish the app publicly to the world, but users can only see specific datasets that they have permission to access.</p><p>Rather than building a dedicated data backend for every app, user data can be stored in a generic backend which can be securely authenticated and accessed using a Python client library‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääall contained within the user‚Äôs web browser. For example, the user is given an OAuth login link that will authenticate them with the backend and allow the app to temporarily access input data.</p><p>As a proof of concept, I built a simple visualization app which connects to <a href=\"https://cirro.bio\">the Cirro data platform</a>, which is used at my institution to manage scientific data.

But what is data engineering, and why is it so important? In this blog post, we will discuss the essential components of a functioning data engineering practice and why data engineering is becoming increasingly critical for businesses today, and how you can build your very own Data Engineering Center of Excellence!</p><p>I‚Äôve had the privilege to build, manage, lead, and foster a sizeable high-performing team of data warehouse &amp; ELT engineers for many years. With the help of my team, I have spent a considerable amount of time every year consciously planning and preparing to manage the growth of our data month-over-month and address the changing reporting and analytics needs for our&nbsp;<em>20000+ global data consumers</em>. We built many data warehouses to store and centralize massive amounts of data generated from many OLTP sources. We‚Äôve implemented Kimball methodology by creating star schemas both within our on-premise data warehouses and in the ones in the cloud.</p><p>The objective is to enable our user-base to perform fast analytics and reporting on the data; so our analysts‚Äô community and business users can make accurate data-driven decisions.</p><p>It took me about three years to transform&nbsp;&nbsp;() of data warehouse and ETL programmers into one cohesive Data Engineering team.</p><p><em>I have compiled some of my learnings building a global data engineering team in this post in hopes that Data professionals and leaders of all levels of technical proficiency can benefit.</em></p><h2>Evolution of the Data Engineer</h2><p>It has never been a better time to be a data engineer. Over the last decade, we have seen a massive awakening of enterprises now recognizing their data as the company‚Äôs heartbeat, making data engineering the job function that ensures accurate, current, and quality data flow to the solutions that depend on it.</p><p>Historically, the role of Data Engineers has evolved from that of&nbsp;<strong><em>data warehouse developers&nbsp;</em></strong>and the&nbsp;&nbsp;(extract, transform and load).</p><p>The data warehouse developers are responsible for designing, building, developing, administering, and maintaining data warehouses to meet an enterprise‚Äôs reporting needs. This is done primarily via extracting data from operational and transactional systems and piping it using extract transform load methodology (ETL/ ELT) to a storage layer like a data warehouse or a data lake. The data warehouse or the data lake is where data analysts, data scientists, and business users consume data. The developers also perform transformations to conform the ingested data to a data model with aggregated data for easy analysis.</p><blockquote><p>A data engineer‚Äôs prime responsibility is to produce and make data securely available for multiple consumers.</p></blockquote><p>Data engineers oversee the ingestion, transformation, modeling, delivery, and movement of data through every part of an organization. Data extraction happens from many different data sources &amp; applications. Data Engineers load the data into data warehouses and data lakes, which are transformed not just for the <a href=\"https://towardsdatascience.com/tag/data-science/\" title=\"Data Science\">Data Science</a> &amp; predictive analytics initiatives (as everyone likes to talk about) but primarily for data analysts. Data analysts &amp; data scientists perform operational reporting, exploratory analytics, service-level agreement (SLA) based business intelligence reports and dashboards on the catered data. In this book, we will address all of these job functions.</p><p>The role of a data engineer is to acquire, store, and aggregate data from both cloud and on-premise, new, and existing systems, with data modeling and feasible data architecture. Without the data engineers, analysts and data scientists won‚Äôt have valuable data to work with, and hence, data engineers are the first to be hired at the inception of every new data team. Based on the data and analytics tools available within an enterprise, data engineering teams‚Äô role profiles, constructs, and approaches have several options for what should be included in their responsibilities which we will discuss in this chapter.</p><p>Software is increasingly automating the historically manual and tedious tasks of data engineers. Data processing tools and technologies have evolved massively over several years and will continue to grow. For example, cloud-based data warehouses (Snowflake, for instance) have made data storage and processing affordable and fast. Data pipeline services (like&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.informatica.com/blogs/welcome-to-informatica-intelligent-cloud-services.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Informatica IICS</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://airflow.apache.org/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Apache Airflow</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.matillion.com/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Matillion</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://fivetran.com/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Fivetran</a>) have turned data extraction into work that can be completed quickly and efficiently. The data engineering team should be leveraging such technologies as force multipliers, taking a consistent and cohesive approach to integration and management of enterprise data, not just relying on legacy siloed approaches to building custom data pipelines with fragile, non-performant, hard to maintain code. Continuing with the latter approach will stifle the pace of innovation within the said enterprise and force the future focus to be around managing data infrastructure issues rather than how to help generate value for your business.</p><p>The primary role of an enterprise Data Engineering team should be to&nbsp;&nbsp;into a shape that‚Äôs ready for analysis ‚Äî laying the foundation for real-world analytics and data science application.</p><p>The Data Engineering team should serve as the&nbsp;&nbsp;for enterprise-level data with the responsibility to curate the organization‚Äôs data and act as a resource for those who want to make use of it, such as Reporting &amp; Analytics teams, Data Science teams, and other groups that are doing more self-service or business group driven analytics leveraging the enterprise data platform. This team should serve as the&nbsp;&nbsp;of organizational knowledge, managing and refining the catalog so that analysis can be done more effectively. Let‚Äôs look at the essential responsibilities of a well-functioning Data Engineering team.</p><h2>Responsibilities of a Data Engineering Team</h2><p>The Data Engineering team should provide a&nbsp;&nbsp;within the enterprise that cuts across to support both the Reporting/Analytics and Data Science capabilities to provide access to clean, transformed, formatted, scalable, and secure data ready for analysis. The Data Engineering teams‚Äô core responsibilities should include:</p><blockquote><p>¬∑ Build, manage, and optimize the core data platform infrastructure</p><p>¬∑ Build and maintain custom and off-the-shelf data integrations and ingestion pipelines from a variety of structured and unstructured sources</p><p>¬∑ Manage overall data pipeline orchestration</p><p>¬∑ Manage transformation of data either before or after load of raw data through both technical processes and business logic</p><p>¬∑ Support analytics teams with design and performance optimizations of data warehouses</p></blockquote><p><strong><em>Data is an Enterprise Asset.</em></strong></p><p><strong><em>Data as an Asset should be shared and protected.</em></strong></p><p>Data should be valued as an Enterprise asset, leveraged across all Business Units to enhance the company‚Äôs value to its respective customer base by accelerating decision making, and improving competitive advantage with the help of data. Good data stewardship, legal and regulatory requirements dictate that we protect the data owned from unauthorized access and disclosure.</p><p>In other words,&nbsp;<strong><em>managing Security is a crucial responsibility.</em></strong></p><h2>Why Create a Centralized Data Engineering Team?</h2><p>Treating Data Engineering as a standard and core capability that underpins both the Analytics and Data Science capabilities will help an enterprise evolve how to approach Data and Analytics. The enterprise needs to stop vertically treating data based on the technology stack involved as we tend to see often and move to more of a horizontal approach of managing a&nbsp;&nbsp;or&nbsp;&nbsp;that cuts across the organization and can connect to various technologies as needed drive analytic initiatives. This is a new way of thinking and working, but it can drive efficiency as the various data organizations look to scale. Additionally ‚Äî there is value in creating a dedicated structure and career path for Data Engineering resources. Data engineering skill sets are in high demand in the market; therefore, hiring outside the company can be costly. Companies must enable programmers, database administrators, and software developers with a career path to gain the needed experience with the above-defined skillsets by working across technologies. Usually, forming a data engineering center of excellence or a capability center would be the first step for making such progression possible.</p><h2>Challenges for creating a centralized Data Engineering Team</h2><p>The centralization of the Data Engineering team as a service approach is different from how Reporting &amp; Analytics and Data Science teams operate. It does, in principle, mean&nbsp;<strong><em>giving up some level of control of resources</em></strong>&nbsp;and establishing new processes for how these teams will collaborate and work together to deliver initiatives.</p><p>The Data Engineering team will need to demonstrate that it can effectively support the needs of both Reporting &amp; Analytics and Data Science teams, no matter how large these teams are. Data Engineering teams must&nbsp;<strong><em>effectively prioritize workloads&nbsp;</em></strong>while ensuring they can bring the right skillsets and experience to assigned projects.</p><p>Data engineering is essential because it serves as the backbone of data-driven companies. It enables analysts to work with clean and well-organized data, necessary for deriving insights and making sound decisions. To build a functioning data engineering practice, you need the following critical components:</p><p>The Data Engineering team should be a core capability within the enterprise, but it should effectively serve as a support function involved in almost everything data-related. It should interact with the Reporting and Analytics and Data Science teams in a collaborative support role to make the entire team successful.</p><p>The&nbsp;<em>Data Engineering team doesn‚Äôt create direct business value</em>&nbsp;‚Äî but the value should come in making the Reporting and Analytics, and Data Science teams more productive and efficient to ensure delivery of maximum value to business stakeholders through Data &amp; Analytics initiatives. To make that possible, the six key responsibilities within the data engineering capability center would be as follow ‚Äì</p><p>Let‚Äôs review the&nbsp;<strong><em>6 pillars of responsibilities</em></strong>:</p><p><strong>1. Determine Central Data Location for Collation and Wrangling</strong></p><p>Understanding and having a strategy for a&nbsp;(<em>a centralized data repository or data warehouse for the mass consumption of data for analysis</em>). Defining requisite data tables and where they will be joined in the context of data engineering and subsequently converting raw data into digestible and valuable formats.</p><p><strong>2. Data Ingestion and Transformation</strong></p><p>Moving data from one or more sources to a new destination (<em>your data lake or cloud data warehouse)&nbsp;</em>where it can be stored and further analyzed and then converting data from the format of the source system to that of the destination</p><p>Extracting, transforming, and loading data from one or more sources into a destination system to represent the data in a new context or style.</p><p>Data modeling is an essential function of a data engineering team, granted not all data engineers excel with this capability. Formalizing relationships between data objects and business rules into a conceptual representation through understanding information system workflows, modeling required queries, designing tables, determining primary keys, and effectively utilizing data to create informed output.</p><p>I‚Äôve seen engineers in interviews mess up more with this than coding in technical discussions. It‚Äôs essential to understand the differences between Dimensions, Facts, Aggregate tables.</p><p>Ensuring that sensitive data is protected and implementing proper authentication and authorization to reduce the risk of a data breach</p><p><strong>6. Architecture and Administration</strong></p><p>Defining the models, policies, and standards that administer what data is collected, where and how it is stored, and how it such data is integrated into various analytical systems.</p><blockquote><p>The six pillars of responsibilities for data engineering capabilities center on the ability to determine a central data location for collation and wrangling, ingest and transform data, execute ETL/ELT operations, model data, secure access and administer an architecture. While all companies have their own specific needs with regards to these functions, it is important to ensure that your team has the necessary skillset in order to build a foundation for big data success.</p></blockquote><p>Besides the Data Engineering following are the other capability centers that need to be considered within an enterprise:</p><h2>Analytics Capability Center</h2><p>The analytics capability center enables consistent, effective, and efficient BI, analytics, and advanced analytics capabilities across the company. Assist business functions in triaging, prioritizing, and achieving their objectives and goals through reporting, analytics, and dashboard solutions, while providing operational reports and visualizations, self-service analytics, and required tools to automate the generation of such insights.</p><h2>Data Science Capability Center</h2><p>The data science capability center is for exploring cutting-edge technologies and concepts to unlock new insights and opportunities, better inform employees and create a culture of prescriptive information usage using Automated AI and Automated ML solutions such as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://medium.com/u/9aea625dfc27?source=post_page---user_mention--b83d51cedb6a---------------------------------------\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">H2O.ai</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://medium.com/u/27e43843bc9f?source=post_page---user_mention--b83d51cedb6a---------------------------------------\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Dataiku</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.aible.com/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Aible</a>, DataRobot,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://medium.com/u/3aaaf223f1e?source=post_page---user_mention--b83d51cedb6a---------------------------------------\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">C3.ai</a></p><p>The data governance office empowers users with trusted, understood, and timely data to drive effectiveness while keeping the integrity and sanctity of data in the right hands for mass consumption.</p><blockquote><p><em>As your company grows, you will want to make sure that the data engineering capabilities are in place to support the six pillars of responsibilities. By doing this, you will be able to ensure that all aspects of data management and analysis are covered and that your data is safe and accessible by those who need it. Have you started thinking about how your company will grow? What steps have you taken to put a centralized data engineering team in place?</em></p></blockquote>","contentLength":14079,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Learnings from a Machine Learning Engineer ‚Äî Part 5: The Training","url":"https://towardsdatascience.com/learnings-from-a-machine-learning-engineer-part-5-the-training/","date":1739480672,"author":"David Martin","guid":6,"unread":true,"content":"<p>In this fifth part of my series, I will outline the steps for creating a Docker container for training your image classification model, evaluating performance, and preparing for deployment.</p><p>AI/ML engineers would prefer to focus on model training and data engineering, but the reality is that we also need to understand the infrastructure and mechanics behind the scenes.</p><p>I hope to share some tips, not only to get your training run running, but how to streamline the process in a cost efficient manner on cloud resources such as Kubernetes.</p><p>I will reference elements from my previous articles for getting the best model performance, so be sure to check out&nbsp;<a href=\"https://towardsdatascience.com/learnings-from-a-machine-learning-engineer-part-1-the-data/\">Part 1</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://towardsdatascience.com/learnings-from-a-machine-learning-engineer-part-2-the-data-sets/\">Part 2</a>&nbsp;on the data sets, as well as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://towardsdatascience.com/learnings-from-a-machine-learning-engineer-part-3-the-evaluation/\">Part 3</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://towardsdatascience.com/learnings-from-a-machine-learning-engineer-part-4-the-model/\">Part 4</a>&nbsp;on model evaluation.</p><p>Here are the learnings that I will share with you, once we lay the groundwork on the infrastructure:</p><ul><li>Building your Docker container</li><li>Executing your training run</li></ul><p>First, let me provide a brief description of the setup that I created, specifically around Kubernetes. Your setup may be entirely different, and that is just fine. I simply want to set the stage on the infrastructure so that the rest of the discussion makes sense.</p><p>This is a server you deploy that provides a user interface to for your subject matter experts to label and evaluate images for the image classification application. The server can run as a pod on your Kubernetes cluster, but you may find that running a dedicated server with faster disk may be better.</p><p>Image files are stored in a directory structure like the following, which is self-documenting and easily modified.</p><pre><code>Image_Library/\n  - cats/\n    - image1001.png\n  - dogs/\n    - image2001.png</code></pre><p>Ideally, these files would reside on local server storage (instead of cloud or cluster storage) for better performance. The reason for this will become clear as we see what happens as the image library grows.</p><p><a href=\"https://towardsdatascience.com/tag/cloud-storage/\" title=\"Cloud Storage\">Cloud Storage</a> allows for a virtually limitless and convenient way to share files between systems. In this case, the image library on your management system could access the same files as your Kubernetes cluster or Docker engine.</p><p>However, the downside of cloud storage is the latency to open a file. Your image library will have&nbsp;&nbsp;of images, and the latency to read each file will have a significant impact on your training run time. Longer training runs means more cost for using the expensive GPU processors!</p><p>The way that I found to speed things up is to create a&nbsp;&nbsp;file of your image library on your management system and copy them to cloud storage. Even better would be to create multiple tar files&nbsp;, each containing 10,000 to 20,000 images.</p><p>This way you only have network latency on a handful of files (which contain thousands, once extracted) and you start your training run much sooner.</p><h3>Kubernetes or Docker engine</h3><p>A Kubernetes cluster, with proper configuration, will allow you to dynamically scale up/down nodes, so you can perform your model training on GPU hardware as needed. Kubernetes is a rather heavy setup, and there are other container engines that will work.</p><blockquote><p>The technology options change constantly!</p></blockquote><p>The main idea is that you want to spin up the resources you need ‚Äî for only as long as you need them ‚Äî then scale down to reduce your time (and therefore cost) of running expensive GPU resources.</p><p>Once your GPU node is started and your <a href=\"https://towardsdatascience.com/tag/docker/\" title=\"Docker\">Docker</a> container is running, you can extract the&nbsp;&nbsp;files above to&nbsp;&nbsp;storage, such as an&nbsp;, on your node. The node typically has high-speed SSD disk, ideal for this type of workload. There is one caveat ‚Äî the storage capacity on your node must be able to handle your image library.</p><p>Assuming we are good, let‚Äôs talk about building your Docker container so that you can train your model on your image library.</p><h2>Building your Docker container</h2><p>Being able to execute a training run in a consistent manner lends itself perfectly to building a Docker container. You can ‚Äúpin‚Äù the version of libraries so you know exactly how your scripts will run every time. You can version control your containers as well, and revert to a known good image in a pinch. What is really nice about Docker is you can run the container pretty much anywhere.</p><p>The tradeoff when running in a container, especially with an <a href=\"https://towardsdatascience.com/tag/image-classification/\" title=\"Image Classification\">Image Classification</a> model, is the speed of file storage. You can attach any number of volumes to your container, but they are usually&nbsp;&nbsp;attached, so there is latency on each file read. This may not be a problem if you have a small number of files. But when dealing with hundreds of thousands of files like image data, that latency adds up!</p><p>This is why using the&nbsp;&nbsp;file method outlined above can be beneficial.</p><p>Also, keep in mind that Docker containers could be terminated unexpectedly, so you should make sure to store important information outside the container, on cloud storage or a database. I‚Äôll show you how below.</p><p>Knowing that you will need to run on GPU hardware (here I will assume Nvidia), be sure to select the right base image for your Dockerfile, such as&nbsp;&nbsp;with the ‚Äúdevel&nbsp;flavor that will contain the right drivers.</p><p>Next, you will add the script files to your container, along with a ‚Äúbatch‚Äù script to coordinate the execution. Here is an example Dockerfile, and then I‚Äôll describe what each of the scripts will be doing.</p><pre><code>#####   Dockerfile   #####\nFROM nvidia/cuda:12.8.0-devel-ubuntu24.04\n\n# Install system software\nRUN apt-get -y update &amp;&amp; apg-get -y upgrade\nRUN apt-get install -y python3-pip python3-dev\n\n# Setup python\nWORKDIR /app\nCOPY requirements.txt\nRUN python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip\nRUN python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt\n\n# Pythong and batch scripts\nCOPY ExtractImageLibrary.py .\nCOPY Training.py .\nCOPY Evaluation.py .\nCOPY ScorePerformance.py .\nCOPY ExportModel.py .\nCOPY BulkIdentification.py .\nCOPY BatchControl.sh .\n\n# Allow for interactive shell\nCMD tail -f /dev/null</code></pre><p>Dockerfiles are declarative, almost like a cookbook for building a small server ‚Äî you know what you‚Äôll get every time. Python libraries benefit, too, from this declarative approach. Here is a sample&nbsp;&nbsp;file that loads the TensorFlow libraries with CUDA support for GPU acceleration.</p><pre><code>#####   requirements.txt   #####\nnumpy==1.26.3\npandas==2.1.4\nscipy==1.11.4\nkeras==2.15.0\ntensorflow[and-cuda]</code></pre><h3>Extract Image Library script</h3><p>In <a href=\"https://towardsdatascience.com/tag/kubernetes/\" title=\"Kubernetes\">Kubernetes</a>, the Docker container can access local, high speed storage on the physical node. This can be achieved via the&nbsp;&nbsp;volume type. As mentioned before, this will only work if the local storage on your node can handle the size of your library.</p><pre><code>#####   sample 25GB emptyDir volume in Kubernetes   #####\ncontainers:\n  - name: training-container\n    volumeMounts:\n      - name: image-library\n        mountPath: /mnt/image-library\nvolumes:\n  - name: image-library\n    emptyDir:\n      sizeLimit: 25Gi</code></pre><p>You would want to have another&nbsp;&nbsp;to your cloud storage where you have the&nbsp;&nbsp;files. What this looks like will depend on your provider, or if you are using a persistent volume claim, so I won‚Äôt go into detail here.</p><p>Now you can extract the&nbsp;&nbsp;files ‚Äî ideally in parallel for an added performance boost ‚Äî to the local mount point.</p><p>As AI/ML engineers, the model training is where we want to spend most of our time.</p><blockquote><p>This is where the magic happens!</p></blockquote><p>With your image library now extracted, we can create our train-validation-test sets, load a pre-trained model or build a new one, fit the model, and save the results.</p><p>One key technique that has served me well is to load the most recently trained model as my base. I discuss this in more detail in&nbsp;<a href=\"https://towardsdatascience.com/learnings-from-a-machine-learning-engineer-part-4-the-model/\">Part 4</a>&nbsp;under ‚ÄúFine tuning‚Äù, this results in faster training time and significantly improved model performance.</p><p>Be sure to take advantage of the local storage to checkpoint your model during training since the models are quite large and you are paying for the GPU even while it sits idle writing to disk.</p><p>This of course raises a concern about what happens if the Docker container dies part-way though the training. The risk is (hopefully) low from a cloud provider, and you may not want an incomplete training anyway. But if that does happen, you will at least want to understand&nbsp;, and this is where saving the main log file to cloud storage (described below) or to a package like MLflow comes in handy.</p><p>After your training run has completed and you have taken proper precaution on saving your work, it is time to see how well it performed.</p><p>Normally this evaluation script will pick up on the model that just finished. But you may decide to point it at a previous model version through an interactive session. This is why have the script as stand-alone.</p><p>With it being a separate script, that means it will need to read the completed model from disk ‚Äî ideally local disk for speed. I like having two separate scripts (training and evaluation), but you might find it better to combine these to avoid reloading the model.</p><p>Now that the model is loaded, the evaluation script should generate predictions on&nbsp;&nbsp;image in the training, validation, test, and benchmark sets. I save the results as a&nbsp;&nbsp;matrix with the softmax confidence score for each class label. So, if there are 1,000 classes and 100,000 images, that‚Äôs a table with 100 million scores!</p><p>I save these results in&nbsp;&nbsp;files that are then used in the score generation next.</p><p>Taking the matrix of scores produced by the evaluation script above, we can now create various metrics of model performance. Again, this process could be combined with the evaluation script above, but my preference is for independent scripts. For example, I might want to regenerate scores on previous training runs. See what works for you.</p><p>Here are some of the&nbsp;&nbsp;functions that produce useful insights like F1, log loss, AUC-ROC, Matthews correlation coefficient.</p><pre><code>from sklearn.metrics import average_precision_score, classification_report\nfrom sklearn.metrics import log_loss, matthews_corrcoef, roc_auc_score</code></pre><p>Aside from these basic statistical analyses for each dataset (train, validation, test, and benchmark), it is also useful to identify:</p><ul><li>Which&nbsp;&nbsp;labels get the most number of errors?</li><li>Which&nbsp;&nbsp;labels get the most number of incorrect guesses?</li><li>How many&nbsp;<strong>ground-truth-to-predicted</strong>&nbsp;label pairs are there? In other words, which classes are easily confused?</li><li>What is the&nbsp;&nbsp;when applying a minimum softmax confidence score threshold?</li><li>What is the&nbsp;&nbsp;above that softmax threshold?</li><li>For the ‚Äúdifficult‚Äù benchmark sets, do you get a sufficiently&nbsp;&nbsp;score?</li><li>For the ‚Äúout-of-scope‚Äù benchmark sets, do you get a sufficiently&nbsp;&nbsp;score?</li></ul><p>As you can see, there are multiple calculations and it‚Äôs not easy to come up with a single evaluation to decide if the trained model is good enough to be moved to production.</p><p>In fact, for an image classification model, it is helpful to manually review the images that the model got wrong, as well as the ones that got a low softmax confidence score. Use the scores from this script to create a list of images to manually review, and then get a&nbsp;&nbsp;for how well the model performs.</p><p>Check out&nbsp;<a href=\"https://towardsdatascience.com/learnings-from-a-machine-learning-engineer-part-3-the-evaluation/\">Part 3</a>&nbsp;for more in-depth discussion on evaluation and scoring.</p><p>All of the heavy lifting is done by this point. Since your Docker container will be shutdown soon, now is the time to copy the model artifacts to cloud storage and prepare them for being put to use.</p><p>The example Python code snippet below is more geared to Keras and TensorFlow. This will take the trained model and export it as a&nbsp;. Later, I will show how this is used by TensorFlow Serving in the&nbsp;&nbsp;section below.</p><pre><code># Increment current version of model and create new directory\nnext_version_dir, version_number = create_new_version_folder()\n\n# Copy model artifacts to the new directory\ncopy_model_artifacts(next_version_dir)\n\n# Create the directory to save the model export\nsaved_model_dir = os.path.join(next_version_dir, str(version_number))\n\n# Save the model export for use with TensorFlow Serving\ntf.keras.backend.set_learning_phase(0)\nmodel = tf.keras.models.load_model(keras_model_file)\ntf.saved_model.save(model, export_dir=saved_model_dir)</code></pre><p>This script also copies the other training run artifacts such as the model evaluation results, score summaries, and log files generated from model training. Don‚Äôt forget about your label map so you can give human readable names to your classes!</p><h3>Bulk identification script</h3><p>Your training run is complete, your model has been scored, and a new version is exported and ready to be served. Now is the time to use this latest model to assist you on trying to identify unlabeled images.</p><p>As I described in&nbsp;<a href=\"https://towardsdatascience.com/learnings-from-a-machine-learning-engineer-part-4-the-model/\">Part 4</a>, you may have a collection of ‚Äúunknowns‚Äù ‚Äî really good pictures, but no idea what they are. Let your new model provide a best guess on these and record the results to a file or a database. Now you can create filters based on closest match and by high/low scores. This allows your subject matter experts to leverage these filters to find new image classes, add to existing classes, or to remove images that have very low scores and are no good.</p><p>By the way, I put this step inside the GPU container since you may have thousands of ‚Äúunknown‚Äù images to process and the accelerated hardware will make light work of it. However, if you are not in a hurry, you could perform this step on a separate CPU node, and shutdown your GPU node sooner to save cost. This would especially make sense if your ‚Äúunknowns‚Äù folder is on slower cloud storage.</p><p>All of the scripts described above perform a specific task ‚Äî from extracting your image library, executing model training, performing evaluation and scoring, exporting the model artifacts for deployment, and perhaps even bulk identification.</p><blockquote><p>One script to rule them all</p></blockquote><p>To coordinate the entire show, this batch script gives you the entry point for your container and an easy way to trigger everything. Be sure to produce a log file in case you need to analyze any failures along the way. Also, be sure to write the log to your cloud storage in case the container dies unexpectedly.</p><pre><code>#!/bin/bash\n# Main batch control script\n\n# Redirect standard output and standard error to a log file\nexec &gt; /cloud_storage/batch-logfile.txt 2&gt;&amp;1\n\n/app/ExtractImageLibrary.py\n/app/Training.py\n/app/Evaluation.py\n/app/ScorePerformance.py\n/app/ExportModel.py\n/app/BulkIdentification.py</code></pre><h2>Executing your training run</h2><p>So, now it‚Äôs time to put everything in motion‚Ä¶</p><p>Let‚Äôs go through the steps to prepare your image library, fire up your Docker container to train your model, and then examine the results.</p><h3>Image library ‚Äòtar‚Äô files</h3><p>Your image management system should now create a&nbsp;&nbsp;file backup of your data. Since&nbsp;&nbsp;is a single-threaded function, you will get significant speed improvement by creating multiple tar files in parallel, each with a portion of you data.</p><p>Now these files can be copied to your shared cloud storage for the next step.</p><p>All the hard work you put into creating your container (described above) will be put to the test. If you are running Kubernetes, you can create a Job that will execute the&nbsp;&nbsp;script.</p><p>Inside the Kubernetes Job definition, you can pass environment variables to adjust the execution of your script. For example, the batch size and number of epochs are set here and then pulled into your Python scripts, so you can alter the behavior without changing your code.</p><pre><code>#####   sample Job in Kubernetes   #####\ncontainers:\n  - name: training-job\n    env:\n      - name: BATCH_SIZE\n        value: 50\n      - name: NUM_EPOCHS\n        value: 30\n    command: [\"/app/BatchControl.sh\"]</code></pre><p>Once the Job is completed, be sure to verify that the GPU node properly scales back down to zero according to your scaling configuration in Kubernetes ‚Äî you don‚Äôt want to be saddled with a huge bill over a simple configuration error.</p><p>With the training run complete, you should now have model artifacts saved and can examine the performance. Look through the metrics, such as F1 and log loss, and benchmark accuracy for high softmax confidence scores.</p><p>As mentioned earlier, the reports only tell part of the story. It is worth the time and effort to manually review the images that the model got wrong or where it produced a low confidence score.</p><p>Don‚Äôt forget about the bulk identification. Be sure to leverage these to locate new images to fill out your data set, or to find new classes.</p><p>Once you have reviewed your model performance and are satisfied with the results, it is time to modify your TensorFlow Serving container to put the new model into production.</p><p>TensorFlow Serving is available as a Docker container and provides a very quick and convenient way to serve your model. This container can listen and respond to API calls for your model.</p><p>Let‚Äôs say your new model is version 7, and your&nbsp;&nbsp;script (see above) has saved the model in your cloud share as&nbsp;<em>/image_application/models/007</em>. You can start the TensorFlow Serving container with that volume mount. In this example, the&nbsp;&nbsp;points to folder for version 007.</p><pre><code>#####   sample TensorFlow pod in Kubernetes   #####\ncontainers:\n  - name: tensorflow-serving\n    image: bitnami/tensorflow-serving:2.18.0\n    ports:\n      - containerPort: 8501\n    env:\n      - name: TENSORFLOW_SERVING_MODEL_NAME\n        value: \"image_application\"\n    volumeMounts:\n      - name: models-subfolder\n        mountPath: \"/bitnami/model-data\"\n\nvolumes:\n  - name: models-subfolder\n    azureFile:\n      shareName: \"image_application/models/007\"</code></pre><p>A subtle note here ‚Äî the export script should create a sub-folder, named 007 (same as the base folder), with the saved model export. This may seem a little confusing, but TensorFlow Serving will mount this share folder as&nbsp;&nbsp;and detect the numbered sub-folder inside it for the version to serve. This will allow you to query the API for the model version as well as the identification.</p><p>As I mentioned at the start of this article, this setup has worked for my situation. This is certainly not the only way to approach this challenge, and I invite you to customize your own solution.</p><p>I wanted to share my hard-fought learnings as I embraced cloud services in Kubernetes, with the desire to keep costs under control. Of course, doing all this while maintaining a high level of model performance is an added challenge, but one that you can achieve.</p><p>I hope I have provided enough information here to help you with your own endeavors.

We will see the difference between evaluation of a&nbsp;&nbsp;model (one not yet in production), and evaluation of a&nbsp;&nbsp;model (one making real-world predictions).</p><p>In&nbsp;<a href=\"https://towardsdatascience.com/learnings-from-a-machine-learning-engineer-part-1-the-data/\">Part 1</a>, I discussed the process of labelling your image data that you use in your <a href=\"https://towardsdatascience.com/tag/image-classification/\" title=\"Image Classification\">Image Classification</a> project. I showed how to define ‚Äúgood‚Äù images and create sub-classes. In&nbsp;<a href=\"https://towardsdatascience.com/learnings-from-a-machine-learning-engineer-part-2-the-data-sets/\">Part 2</a>, I went over various data sets, beyond the usual train-validation-test sets, such as benchmark sets, plus how to handle synthetic data and duplicate images.</p><h2><strong>Evaluation of the trained model</strong></h2><p>As machine learning engineers we look at accuracy, F1, log loss, and other metrics to decide if a model is ready to move to production. These are all important measures, but from my experience, these scores can be deceiving especially as the number of classes grows.</p><p>Although it can be time consuming, I find it very important to manually review the images that the model gets&nbsp;, as well as the images that the model gives a&nbsp;&nbsp;softmax ‚Äúconfidence‚Äù score to. This means adding a step immediately after your training run completes to calculate scores for&nbsp;&nbsp;images ‚Äî training, validation, test, and the benchmark sets. You only need to bring up for manual review the ones that the model had problems with. This should only be a small percentage of the total number of images. See the Double-check process below</p><p>What you do during the manual evaluation is to put yourself in a ‚Äú‚Äù to ensure that the labelling standards are being followed that you setup in <a href=\"https://towardsdatascience.com/learnings-from-a-machine-learning-engineer-part-1-the-data/\">Part 1</a>. Ask yourself:</p><ul><li>‚ÄúIs this a good image?‚Äù Is the subject front and center, and can you clearly see all the features?</li><li>‚ÄúIs this the correct label?‚Äù Don‚Äôt be surprised if you find wrong labels.</li></ul><p>You can either remove the bad images or fix the labels if they are wrong. Otherwise you can keep them in the data set and force the model to do better next time. Other questions I ask are:</p><ul><li>‚ÄúWhy did the model get this wrong?‚Äù</li><li>‚ÄúWhy did this image get a low score?‚Äù</li><li>‚ÄúWhat is it about the image that caused confusion?‚Äù</li></ul><p>Sometimes the answer has nothing to do with&nbsp;&nbsp;specific image. Frequently, it has to do with the&nbsp;&nbsp;images, either in the ground truth class or in the predicted class. It is worth the effort to Double-check all images in both sets if you see a consistently bad guess. Again, don‚Äôt be surprised if you find poor images or wrong labels.</p><p>When doing the evaluation of the trained model (above), we apply a lot of subjective analysis ‚Äî ‚ÄúWhy did the model get this wrong?‚Äù and ‚ÄúIs this a good image?‚Äù From these, you may only get a&nbsp;.</p><p>Frequently, I will decide to hold off moving a model forward to production based on that gut feel. But how can you justify to your manager that you want to hit the brakes? This is where putting a more&nbsp;&nbsp;analysis comes in by creating a weighted average of the softmax ‚Äúconfidence‚Äù scores.</p><p>In order to apply a weighted evaluation, we need to identify sets of classes that deserve adjustments to the score. Here is where I create a list of ‚Äúcommonly confused‚Äù classes.</p><h2><strong>Commonly confused classes</strong></h2><p>Certain animals at our zoo can easily be mistaken. For example, African elephants and Asian elephants have different ear shapes. If your model gets these two mixed up, that is not as bad as guessing a giraffe! So perhaps you give partial credit here. You and your subject matter experts (SMEs) can come up with a list of these pairs and a weighted adjustment for each.</p><p>This weight can be factored into a modified cross-entropy loss function in the equation below. The back half of this equation will reduce the impact of being wrong for specific pairs of ground truth and prediction by using the ‚Äúweight‚Äù function as a lookup. By default, the weighted adjustment would be 1 for all pairings, and the commonly confused classes would get something like 0.5.</p><p>In other words, it‚Äôs better to be unsure (have a&nbsp;&nbsp;confidence score) when you are wrong, compared to being super confident and wrong.</p><p>Once this weighted log loss is calculated, I can compare to previous training runs to see if the new model is ready for production.</p><h2><strong>Confidence threshold report</strong></h2><p>Another valuable measure that incorporates the confidence threshold (in my example, 95) is to report on accuracy and false positive rates. Recall that when we apply the confidence threshold before presenting results, we help reduce false positives from being shown to the end user.</p><p>In this table, we look at the breakdown of ‚Äútrue positive above 95‚Äù for each data set. We get a sense that when a ‚Äúgood‚Äù picture comes through (like the ones from our train-validation-test set) it is very likely to surpass the threshold, thus the user is ‚Äúhappy‚Äù with the outcome. Conversely, the ‚Äúfalse positive above 95‚Äù is extremely low for good pictures, thus only a small number of our users will be ‚Äúsad‚Äù about the results.</p><p>We expect the train-validation-test set results to be exceptional since our data is curated. So, as long as people take ‚Äúgood‚Äù pictures, the model should do very well. But to get a sense of how it does on extreme situations, let‚Äôs take a look at our benchmarks.</p><p>The ‚Äúdifficult‚Äù benchmark has more modest true positive and false positive rates, which reflects the fact that the images are more challenging. These values are much easier to compare across training runs, so that lets me set a min/max target. So for example, if I target a minimum of 80% for true positive, and maximum of 5% for false positive on this benchmark, then I can feel confident moving this to production.</p><p>The ‚Äúout-of-scope‚Äù benchmark has no true positive rate because&nbsp;&nbsp;of the images belong to any class the model can identify. Remember, we picked things like a bag of popcorn, etc., that are not zoo animals, so there cannot be any true positives. But we do get a false positive rate, which means the model gave a confident score to that bag of popcorn as some animal. And if we set a target maximum of 10% for this benchmark, then we may not want to move it to production.</p><p>Right now, you may be thinking, ‚ÄúWell, what animal did it pick for the bag of popcorn?‚Äù Excellent question! Now you understand the importance of doing a manual review of the images that get bad results.</p><h2><strong>Evaluation of the deployed model</strong></h2><p>The evaluation that I described above applies to a model immediately after&nbsp;. Now, you want to evaluate how your model is doing in the&nbsp;. The process is similar, but requires you to shift to a ‚Äú‚Äù and asking yourself, ‚ÄúDid the model get this correct?‚Äù and ‚ÄúShould it have gotten this correct?‚Äù and ‚ÄúDid we tell the user the right thing?‚Äù</p><p>So, imagine that you are logging in for the morning ‚Äî after sipping on your&nbsp;<a href=\"https://medium.com/@dmartin0409/cold-brew-coffee-0aabd53a1f3e\">cold brew coffee</a>, of course ‚Äî and are presented with 500 images that your zoo guests took yesterday of different animals. Your job is to determine how satisfied the guests were using your model to identify the zoo animals.</p><p>Using the softmax ‚Äúconfidence‚Äù score for each image, we have a threshold before presenting results. Above the threshold, we tell the guest what the model predicted. I‚Äôll call this the ‚Äúhappy path‚Äù. And below the threshold is the ‚Äúsad path‚Äù where we ask them to try again.</p><p>Your review interface will first show you all the ‚Äúhappy path‚Äù images one at a time. This is where you ask yourself, ‚ÄúDid we get this right?‚Äù Hopefully, yes!</p><p>But if not, this is where things get tricky. So now you have to ask, ‚ÄúWhy not?‚Äù Here are some things that it could be:</p><ul><li>‚ÄúBad‚Äù picture ‚Äî Poor lighting, bad angle, zoomed out, etc ‚Äî refer to your labelling standards.</li><li>Out-of-scope ‚Äî It‚Äôs a zoo animal, but unfortunately one that isn‚Äôt found in&nbsp;&nbsp;zoo. Maybe it belongs to another zoo (your guest likes to travel and try out your app). Consider adding these to your data set.</li><li>Out-of-scope ‚Äî It‚Äôs not a zoo animal. It could be an animal in your zoo, but not one typically&nbsp;&nbsp;there, like a neighborhood sparrow or mallard duck. This might be a candidate to add.</li><li>Out-of-scope ‚Äî It‚Äôs something found in the zoo. A zoo usually has interesting trees and shrubs, so people might try to identify those. Another candidate to add.</li><li>Prankster ‚Äî Completely out-of-scope. Because people like to play with technology, there‚Äôs the possibility you have a prankster that took a picture of a bag of popcorn, or a soft drink cup, or even a selfie. These are hard to prevent, but hopefully get a low enough score (below the threshold) so the model did not identify it as a zoo animal. If you see enough pattern in these, consider creating a class with special handling on the front-end.</li></ul><p>After reviewing the ‚Äúhappy path‚Äù images, you move on to the ‚Äúsad path‚Äù images ‚Äî the ones that got a low confidence score and the app gave a ‚Äúsorry, try again‚Äù message. This time you ask yourself, ‚Äú&nbsp;the model have given this image a higher score?‚Äù which would have put it in the ‚Äúhappy path‚Äù. If so, then you want to ensure these images are added to the training set so next time it will do better. But most of time, the low score reflects many of the ‚Äúbad‚Äù or out-of-scope situations mentioned above.</p><p>Perhaps your model performance is suffering and it has nothing to do with your model. Maybe it is the ways you users interacting with the app. Keep an eye out of non-technical problems and share your observations with the rest of your team. For example:</p><ul><li>Are your users using the application in the ways you expected?</li><li>Are they not following the instructions?</li><li>Do the instructions need to be stated more clearly?</li><li>Is there anything you can do to improve the experience?</li></ul><h2><strong>Collect statistics and new images</strong></h2><p>Both of the manual evaluations above open a gold mine of data. So, be sure to collect these statistics and feed them into a dashboard ‚Äî your manager and your future self will thank you!</p><p>Keep track of these stats and generate reports that you and your can reference:</p><ul><li>How often the model is being called?</li><li>What times of the day, what days of the week is it used?</li><li>Are your system resources able to handle the peak load?</li><li>What classes are the most common?</li><li>After evaluation, what is the accuracy for each class?</li><li>What is the breakdown for confidence scores?</li><li>How many scores are above and below the confidence threshold?</li></ul><p>The single best thing you get from a deployed model is the additional real-world images! You can add these now images to improve coverage of your existing zoo animals. But more importantly, they provide you insight on&nbsp;&nbsp;classes to add. For example, let‚Äôs say people enjoy taking a picture of the large walrus statue at the gate. Some of these may make sense to incorporate into your data set to provide a better user experience.</p><p>Creating a new class, like the walrus statue, is not a huge effort, and it avoids the false positive responses. It would be more embarrassing to identify a walrus statue as an elephant! As for the prankster and the bag of popcorn, you can configure your front-end to quietly handle these. You might even get creative and have fun with it like, ‚ÄúThank you for visiting the food court.‚Äù</p><p>It is a good idea to double-check your image set when you suspect there may be problems with your data. I‚Äôm not suggesting a top-to-bottom check, because that would a monumental effort! Rather specific classes that you suspect could contain bad data that is degrading your model performance.</p><p>Immediately after my training run completes, I have a script that will use this new model to generate predictions for my&nbsp;&nbsp;data set. When this is complete, it will take the list of incorrect identifications, as well as the low scoring predictions, and automatically feed that list into the Double-check interface.</p><p>This interface will show, one at a time, the image in question, alongside an example image of the ground truth and an example image of what the model predicted. I can visually compare the three, side-by-side. The first thing I do is ensure the original image is a ‚Äúgood‚Äù picture, following my labelling standards. Then I check if the ground-truth label is indeed correct, or if there is something that made the model think it was the predicted label.</p><ul><li>Remove the original image if the image quality is poor.</li><li>Relabel the image if it belongs in a different class.</li></ul><p>During this manual evaluation, you might notice dozens of the same wrong prediction. Ask yourself why the model made this mistake when the images seem perfectly fine. The answer may be some incorrect labels on images in the ground truth, or even in the predicted class!</p><p>Don‚Äôt hesitate to add those classes and sub-classes back into the Double-check interface and step through them all. You may have 100‚Äì200 pictures to review, but there is a good chance that one or two of the images will stand out as being the culprit.</p><p>With a different mindset for a trained model versus a deployed model, we can now evaluate performances to decide which models are ready for production, and how well a production model is going to serve the public. This relies on a solid Double-check process and a critical eye on your data. And beyond the ‚Äúgut feel‚Äù of your model, we can rely on the benchmark scores to support us.</p><p>In&nbsp;<a href=\"https://towardsdatascience.com/learnings-from-a-machine-learning-engineer-part-4-the-model/\">Part 4</a>, we kick off the training run, but there are some subtle techniques to get the most out of the process and even ways to leverage throw-away models to expand your library image data.<a href=\"https://medium.com/tag/machine-learning?source=post_page-----e4a8dbb035e0---------------------------------------\"></a></p>","contentLength":13463,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Build a dynamic, role-based AI agent using Amazon Bedrock inline agents","url":"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/build-a-dynamic-role-based-ai-agent-using-amazon-bedrock-inline-agents/","date":1739480188,"author":"Ishan Singh","guid":132,"unread":true,"content":"<p>AI agents continue to gain momentum, as businesses use the power of generative AI to reinvent customer experiences and automate complex workflows. We are seeing <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/agents/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Amazon Bedrock Agents</a> applied in investment research, insurance claims processing, root cause analysis, advertising campaigns, and much more. Agents use the reasoning capability of foundation models (FMs) to break down user-requested tasks into multiple steps. They use developer-provided instructions to create an orchestration plan and carry out that plan by securely invoking company APIs and accessing knowledge bases using Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) to accurately handle the user‚Äôs request.</p><p>Although organizations see the benefit of agents that are defined, configured, and tested as managed resources, we have increasingly seen the need for an additional, more dynamic way to invoke agents. Organizations need solutions that adjust on the fly‚Äîwhether to test new approaches, respond to changing business rules, or customize solutions for different clients. This is where the new <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/agents-create-inline.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">inline agents</a> capability in Amazon Bedrock Agents becomes transformative. It allows you to dynamically adjust your agent‚Äôs behavior at runtime by changing its instructions, tools, guardrails, knowledge bases, prompts, and even the FMs it uses‚Äîall without redeploying your application.</p><p>In this post, we explore how to build an application using Amazon Bedrock inline agents, demonstrating how a single AI assistant can adapt its capabilities dynamically based on user roles.</p><h2>Inline agents in Amazon Bedrock Agents</h2><p>This runtime flexibility enabled by inline agents opens powerful new possibilities, such as:</p><ul><li> ‚Äì Inline agents minimize the time-consuming create/update/prepare cycles traditionally required for agent configuration changes. Developers can instantly test different combinations of models, tools, and knowledge bases, dramatically accelerating the development process.</li><li><strong>A/B testing and experimentation</strong> ‚Äì Data science teams can systematically evaluate different model-tool combinations, measure performance metrics, and analyze response patterns in controlled environments. This empirical approach enables quantitative comparison of configurations before production deployment.</li><li><strong>Subscription-based personalization</strong> ‚Äì Software companies can adapt features based on each customer‚Äôs subscription level, providing more advanced tools for premium users.</li><li><strong>Persona-based data source integration</strong> ‚Äì Institutions can adjust content complexity and tone based on the user‚Äôs profile, providing persona-appropriate explanations and resources by changing the knowledge bases associated to the agent on the fly.</li><li> ‚Äì Developers can create applications with hundreds of APIs, and quickly and accurately carry out tasks by dynamically choosing a small subset of APIs for the agent to consider for a given request. This is particularly helpful for large software as a service (SaaS) platforms needing multi-tenant scaling.</li></ul><p>Inline agents expand your options for building and deploying agentic solutions with Amazon Bedrock Agents. For workloads needing managed and versioned agent resources with a pre-determined and tested configuration (specific model, instructions, tools, and so on), developers can continue to use InvokeAgent on resources created with CreateAgent. For workloads that need dynamic runtime behavior changes for each agent invocation, you can use the new <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/APIReference/API_agent-runtime_InvokeInlineAgent.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">InvokeInlineAgent API</a>. With either approach, your agents will be secure and scalable, with configurable guardrails, a flexible set of model inference options, native access to knowledge bases, code interpretation, session memory, and more.</p><p>Our HR assistant example shows how to build a single AI assistant that adapts to different user roles using the new inline agent capabilities in Amazon Bedrock Agents. When users interact with the assistant, the assistant dynamically configures agent capabilities (such as model, instructions, knowledge bases, action groups, and guardrails) based on the user‚Äôs role and their specific selections. This approach creates a flexible system that adjusts its functionality in real time, making it more efficient than creating separate agents for each user role or tool combination. The complete code for this HR assistant example is available on our <a href=\"https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-bedrock-agent-samples/tree/main/examples/agents_ux/inline-agent-hr-assistant\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">GitHub repo</a>.</p><p>This dynamic tool selection enables a personalized experience. When an employee logs in without direct reports, they see a set of tools that they have access to based on their role. They can select from options like requesting vacation time, checking company policies using the knowledge base, using a code interpreter for data analysis, or submitting expense reports. The inline agent assistant is then configured with only these selected tools, allowing it to assist the employee with their chosen tasks. In a real-world example, the user would not need to make the selection, because the application would make that decision and automatically configure the agent invocation at runtime. We make it explicit in this application so that you can demonstrate the impact.</p><p>Similarly, when a manager logs in to the same system, they see an extended set of tools reflecting their additional permissions. In addition to the employee-level tools, managers have access to capabilities like running performance reviews. They can select which tools they want to use for their current session, instantly configuring the inline agent with their choices.</p><p>The inclusion of knowledge bases is also adjusted based on the user‚Äôs role. Employees and managers see different levels of company policy information, with managers getting additional access to confidential data like performance review and compensation details. For this demo, we‚Äôve implemented <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/amazon-bedrock-knowledge-bases-now-supports-metadata-filtering-to-improve-retrieval-accuracy/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">metadata filtering</a> to retrieve only the appropriate level of documents based on the user‚Äôs access level, further enhancing efficiency and security.</p><p>Let‚Äôs look at how the interface adapts to different user roles.</p><p>The employee view provides access to essential HR functions like vacation requests, expense submissions, and company policy lookups. Users can select which of these tools they want to use for their current session.</p><p>The manager view extends these options to include supervisory functions like compensation management, demonstrating how the inline agent can be configured with a broader set of tools based on user permissions.</p><p>The manager view extends these capabilities to include supervisory functions like compensation management, demonstrating how the inline agent dynamically adjusts its available tools based on user permissions. Without inline agents, we would need to build and maintain two separate agents.</p><p>As shown in the preceding screenshots, the same HR assistant offers different tool selections based on the user‚Äôs role. An employee sees options like Knowledge Base, Apply Vacation Tool, and Submit Expense, whereas a manager has additional options like Performance Evaluation. Users can select which tools they want to add to the agent for their current interaction.</p><p>This flexibility allows for quick adaptation to user needs and preferences. For instance, if the company introduces a new policy for creating business travel requests, the tool catalog can be quickly updated to include a Create Business Travel Reservation tool. Employees can then choose to add this new tool to their agent configuration when they need to plan a business trip, or the application could automatically do so based on their role.</p><p>With Amazon Bedrock inline agents, you can create a catalog of actions that is dynamically selected by the application or by users of the application. This increases the level of flexibility and adaptability of your solutions, making them a perfect fit for navigating the complex, ever-changing landscape of modern business operations. Users have more control over their AI assistant‚Äôs capabilities, and the system remains efficient by only loading the necessary tools for each interaction.</p><h2>Technical foundation: Dynamic configuration and action selection</h2><p>Inline agents allow dynamic configuration at runtime, enabling a single agent to effectively perform the work of many. By specifying action groups and modifying instructions on the fly, even within the same session, you can create versatile AI applications that adapt to various scenarios without multiple agent deployments.</p><p>The following are key points about inline agents:</p><ul><li> ‚Äì Change the agent‚Äôs configuration, including its FM, at runtime. This enables rapid experimentation and adaptation without redeploying the application, reducing development cycles.</li><li> ‚Äì Apply governance and access control at the tool level. With agents changing dynamically at runtime, tool-level governance helps maintain security and compliance regardless of the agent‚Äôs configuration.</li><li> ‚Äì Provide only necessary tools and instructions at runtime to reduce token usage and improve the agent accuracy. With fewer tools to choose from, it‚Äôs less complicated for the agent to select the right one, reducing hallucinations in the tool selection process. This approach can also lead to lower costs and improved latency compared to static agents because removing unnecessary tools, knowledge bases, and instructions reduces the number of input and output tokens being processed by the agent‚Äôs large language model (LLM).</li><li> ‚Äì Create reusable actions for dynamic selection based on specific needs.

While this is true (and pretty much obvious), it is extremely difficult to define, build, and sustain good data. Let me share with you the unique processes that I have learned over several years building an ever-growing image classification system and how you can apply these techniques to your own application.</p><p>With persistence and diligence, you can avoid the classic ‚Äúgarbage in, garbage out‚Äù, maximize your model accuracy, and demonstrate real business value.</p><p>In this series of articles, I will dive into the care and feeding of a multi-class, single-label image classification app and what it takes to reach the highest level of performance. I won‚Äôt get into any coding or specific user interfaces, just the main concepts that you can incorporate to suit your needs with the tools at your disposal.</p><p>Here is a brief description of the articles. You will notice that the model is last on the list since we need to focus on curating the data first and foremost:</p><p>Over the past six years, I have been primarily focused on building and maintaining an image classification application for a manufacturing company. Back when I started, most of the software did not exist or was too expensive, so I created these from scratch. In this time, I have deployed two identifier applications, the largest handles 1,500 classes and achieves 97‚Äì98% accuracy.</p><p>It was about eight years ago that I started online studies for <a href=\"https://towardsdatascience.com/tag/data-science/\" title=\"Data Science\">Data Science</a> and machine learning. So, when the exciting opportunity to create an AI application presented itself, I was prepared to build the tools I needed to leverage the latest advancements. I jumped in with both feet!</p><p>I quickly found that building and deploying a model is probably the easiest part of the job. Feeding high quality data into the model is the best way to improve performance, and that requires focus and patience. Attention to detail is what I do best, so this was a perfect fit.</p><h2><strong>It all starts with the data</strong></h2><p>I feel that so much attention is given to the model selection (deciding which neural network is best) and that the data is just an afterthought. I have found the hard way that even one or two pieces of bad data can significantly impact model performance, so that is where we need to focus.</p><p>For example, let‚Äôs say you train the classic cat versus dog image classifier. You have 50 pictures of cats and 50 pictures of dogs, however one of the ‚Äúcats‚Äù is clearly (objectively) a picture of a dog. The computer doesn‚Äôt have the luxury of ignoring the mislabelled image, and instead adjusts the model weights to make it fit. Square peg meets round hole.</p><p>Another example would be a picture of a cat that climbed up into a tree. But when you take a wholistic view of it, you would describe it as a picture of a tree (first) with a cat (second). Again, the computer doesn‚Äôt know to ignore the big tree and focus on the cat ‚Äî it will start to identify trees as cats, even if there is a dog. You can think of these pictures as outliers and should be removed.</p><p>It doesn‚Äôt matter if you have the best neural network in the world, you can count on the model making poor predictions when it is trained on ‚Äúbad‚Äù data. I‚Äôve learned that any time I see the model make mistakes, it‚Äôs time to review the data.</p><h2><strong>Example Application ‚Äî Zoo animals</strong></h2><p>For the rest of this write-up, I will use an example of identifying zoo animals. Let‚Äôs assume your goal is to create a mobile app where guests at the zoo can take pictures of the animals they see and have the app identify them. Specifically, this is a multi-class, single-label application.</p><ul><li>&nbsp;‚Äî There are a lot of different animals at the zoo and many of them look very similar.</li><li>&nbsp;‚Äî Guests using the app don‚Äôt always take good pictures (zoomed out, blurry, too dark), so we don‚Äôt want to provide an answer if the image is poor.</li><li>&nbsp;‚Äî The zoo keeps expanding and adding new species all the time.</li><li>&nbsp;‚Äî Occasionally you might find that people take pictures of the sparrows near the food court grabbing some dropped popcorn.</li><li>&nbsp;‚Äî Just for fun, guests may take a picture of the bag of popcorn just to see what it comes back with.</li></ul><p>These are all real challenges ‚Äî being able to tell the subtle differences between animals, handling out-of-scope cases, and just plain poor images.</p><p>Before we get there, let‚Äôs start from the beginning.</p><p>There are a lot of tools these days to help you with this part of the process, but the challenge remains the same ‚Äî collecting, labelling, and curating the data.</p><p>Having data to collect is challenge #1. Without images, you have nothing to train. You may need to get creative on sourcing the data, or even creating synthetic data. More on that later.</p><p>A quick note about image pre-processing. I convert all my images to the input size of my neural network and save them as PNG. Inside this square PNG, I preserve the aspect ratio of the original picture and fill the background black. I don‚Äôt stretch the image nor crop any features out. This also helps center the subject.</p><p>Challenge #2 is to establish standards for data quality‚Ä¶and ensure that these standards are followed! These standards will guide you toward that ‚Äúgood‚Äù data. And this assumes, of course, correct labels. Having both is much easier said than done!</p><p>I hope to show how ‚Äúgood‚Äù and ‚Äúcorrect‚Äù actually go hand-in-hand, and how important it is to apply these standards to every image.</p><p>First, I want to point out that the image data discussed here is for the training set. What qualifies as a good image for&nbsp;&nbsp;is a bit different than what qualifies as a good image for&nbsp;. More on that in <a href=\"https://towardsdatascience.com/learnings-from-a-machine-learning-engineer-part-3-the-evaluation/\">Part 3</a>.</p><p>So, what is ‚Äúgood‚Äù data when talking about images? ‚ÄúA picture is worth a thousand words‚Äù, and if the&nbsp;&nbsp;you use to describe the picture do not include the subject you are trying to label, then it is not good and you need remove it from your training set.</p><p>For example, let‚Äôs say you are shown a picture of a zebra and (removing bias toward your application) you describe it as an ‚Äúopen field with a zebra in the distance‚Äù. In other words, if ‚Äúopen field‚Äù is the first thing you notice, then you likely do&nbsp;&nbsp;want to use that image. The opposite is also true ‚Äî if the picture is way too close, you would described it as ‚Äúzebra pattern‚Äù.</p><p>What you want is a description like, ‚Äúa zebra, front and center‚Äù. This would have your subject taking up about 80‚Äì90% of the total frame. Sometimes I will take the time to crop the original image so the subject is framed properly.</p><p>Keep in mind the use of image augmentation at the time of training. Having that buffer around the edges will allow ‚Äúzoom in‚Äù augmentation. And ‚Äúzoom out‚Äù augmentation will simulate smaller subjects, so don‚Äôt start out less than 50% of the total frame for your subject since you lose detail.</p><p>Another aspect of a ‚Äúgood‚Äù image relates to the label. If you can only see the back side of your zoo animal, can you really tell, for example, that it is a cheetah versus a leopard? The key identifying features need to be visible. If a human struggles to identify it, you can‚Äôt expect the computer to learn anything.</p><p>What does a ‚Äúbad‚Äù image look like? Here is what I frequently watch out for:</p><ul><li>Wide angle lens stretching</li><li>High contrast or dark shadows</li><li>‚ÄúDoctored‚Äù images, drawn lines and arrows</li><li>‚ÄúUnusual‚Äù angles or situations</li><li>Picture of a mobile device that has a picture of your subject</li></ul><p>If you have a team of subject matter experts (SMEs) on hand to label the images, you are in a good starting position. Animal trainers at the zoo know the various species, and can spot the differences between, for example, a chimpanzee and a bonobo.</p><p>To a <a href=\"https://towardsdatascience.com/tag/machine-learning-engineer/\" title=\"Machine Learning Engineer\">Machine Learning Engineer</a>, it is easy for you to assume all labels from your SMEs are correct and move right on to training the model. However, even experts make mistakes, so if you can get a second opinion on the labels, your error rate should go down.</p><p>In reality, it can be prohibitively expensive to get one, let alone two, subject matter experts to review image labels. The SME usually has years of experience that make them more valuable to the business in other areas of work. My experience is that the machine learning engineer (that‚Äôs you and me) becomes the second opinion, and often the first opinion as well.</p><p>Over time, you can become pretty adept at labelling, but certainly not an SME. If you do have the luxury of access to an expert, explain to them the labelling standards and how these are required for the application to be successful. Emphasize ‚Äúquality over quantity‚Äù.</p><p>It goes without saying that having a&nbsp;&nbsp;label is so important. However, all it takes is one or two mislabelled images to degrade performance. These can easily slip into your data set with careless or hasty labelling. So, take the time to get it right.</p><p>Ultimately, we as the ML engineer are responsible for model performance. So, if we take the approach of only working on model training and deployment, we will find ourselves wondering why performance is falling short.</p><p>A lot of times, you will come across a really good picture of a very interesting subject, but have no idea what it is! It would be a shame to simply dispose of it. What you can do is assign it a generic label, like ‚ÄúUnknown Bird‚Äù or ‚ÄúRandom Plant‚Äù that are&nbsp;&nbsp;included in your training set. Later in <a href=\"https://towardsdatascience.com/learnings-from-a-machine-learning-engineer-part-4-the-model/\">Part 4</a>, you‚Äôll see how to come back to these images at a later date when you have a better idea what they are, and you‚Äôll be glad you saved them.</p><p>If you have done any image labelling, then you know how time consuming and difficult it can be. But this is where having a model, even a less-than-perfect model, can help you.</p><p>Typically, you have a large collection of unlabelled image and you need to go through them one at a time to assign labels. Simply having the model offer a best guess and display the top 3 results lets you step through each image in a matter of seconds!</p><p>Even if the top 3 results are wrong, this can help you narrow down your search. Over time, newer models will get better, and the labelling process can even be somewhat fun!</p><p>In <a href=\"https://towardsdatascience.com/learnings-from-a-machine-learning-engineer-part-4-the-model/\">Part 4</a>, I will show how you can bulk identify images and take this to the next level for faster labelling.</p><p>I mentioned the example above of two species that look very similar, the chimpanzee and the bonobo. When you start out building your data set, you may have very sparse coverage of one or both of these species. In machine learning terms, we these ‚Äúclasses‚Äù. One option is to roll with what you have and hope that the model picks up on the differences with only a handful of example images.</p><p>The option that I have used is to merge two or more classes into one, at least temporarily. So, in this case I would create a class called ‚Äúchimp-bonobo‚Äù, which is composed of the limited example pictures of chimpanzee and bonobo species classes. Combined, these may give me enough to train the model on ‚Äúchimp-bonobo‚Äù, with the trade-off that it‚Äôs a more generic identification.</p><p>Sub-classes can even be normal variations. For example,&nbsp;&nbsp;pink flamingos are grey instead of pink. Or, male and female orangutans have distinct facial features. You wan to have a fairly balanced number of images for these normal variations, and keeping sub-classes will allow you to accomplish this.</p><p>Don‚Äôt be concerned that you are merging completely different looking classes ‚Äî the neural network does a nice job of applying the ‚ÄúOR‚Äù operator. This works both ways ‚Äî it can help you identify male or female variations as one species, but it can hurt you when ‚Äúbad‚Äù outlier images sneak in like the example ‚Äúopen field with a zebra in the distance.‚Äù</p><p>Over time, you will (hopefully) be able to collect more images of the sub-classes and then be able to successfully split them apart (if necessary) and train the model to identify them separately. This process has worked very well for me. Just be sure to double-check all the images when you split them to ensure the labels didn‚Äôt get accidentally mixed up ‚Äî it will be time well spent.</p><p>All of this certainly depends on your user requirements, and you can handle this in different ways either by creating a unique class label like ‚Äúchimp-bonobo‚Äù, or at the front-end presentation layer where you notify the user that you have intentionally merged these classes and provide guidance on further refining the results. Even after you decide to split the two classes, you may want to caution the user that the model could be wrong since the two classes are so similar.</p><p>I realize this was a long write-up for something that on the surface seems intuitive, but these are all areas that I have tripped me up in the past because I didn‚Äôt give them enough attention. Once you have a solid understanding of these principles, you can go on to build a successful application.</p><p>In&nbsp;<a href=\"https://towardsdatascience.com/learnings-from-a-machine-learning-engineer-part-2-the-data-sets/\">Part 2</a>, we will take the curated data we collected here to create the classic data sets, with a custom benchmark set that will further enhance your data.

I will also show how you can leverage the model to accelerate your labelling process, and finally how to justify your efforts by generating usage and performance statistics.</p><p>In&nbsp;<a href=\"https://towardsdatascience.com/learnings-from-a-machine-learning-engineer-part-1-the-data/\">Part 1</a>, I discussed the process of labelling your image data that you use in your image classification project. I showed how define ‚Äúgood‚Äù images and create sub-classes. In&nbsp;<a href=\"https://towardsdatascience.com/learnings-from-a-machine-learning-engineer-part-2-the-data-sets/\">Part 2</a>, I went over various data sets, beyond the usual train-validation-test sets, with benchmark sets, plus how to handle synthetic data and duplicate images. In <a href=\"https://towardsdatascience.com/learnings-from-a-machine-learning-engineer-part-3-the-evaluation/\">Part 3</a>, I explained how to apply different evaluation criteria to a trained model versus a deployed model, and using benchmarks to determine when to deploy a model.</p><p>So far I have focused a lot of time on labelling and curating the set of images, and also evaluating model performance, which is like putting the cart before the horse. I‚Äôm not trying to minimize what it takes to design a massive neural network ‚Äî this is a very important part of the application you are building. In my case, I spent a few weeks experimenting with different available models before settling on one that fit the bill.</p><p>Once you pick a model structure, you usually don‚Äôt make any major changes to it. For me, six years into deployment, I‚Äôm still using the same one. Specifically, I chose Inception V4 because it has a large input image size and an adequate number of layers to pick up on subtle image features. It also performs inference fast enough on CPU, so I don‚Äôt need to run expensive hardware to serve the model.</p><p>Your mileage may vary. But again, the main takeaway is that focusing on your data will pay dividends versus searching for the best model.</p><p>I will share a process that I found to work extremely well. Once I decided on the model to use, I randomly initialized the weights and let the model train for about 120 epoch before improvements plateau at a fairly modest accuracy, like 93%. At this point, I performed the evaluation of the trained model (see <a href=\"https://towardsdatascience.com/learnings-from-a-machine-learning-engineer-part-3-the-evaluation/\">Part 3</a>) to clean up the data set. I also incorporated new images as part of the data pipeline (see <a href=\"https://towardsdatascience.com/learnings-from-a-machine-learning-engineer-part-1-the-data/\">Part 1</a>) and prepared the data sets for the next training run.</p><p>Before starting the next training run, I simply take the last trained model, pop the output layer, and add it back in with random weights. Since the number of output classes are constantly increasing in my case, I have to pop that layer anyway to account for the new number of classes. Importantly, I leave the rest of the trained weights as they were and allow them to continue updating for the new classes.</p><p>This allows the model to train much faster before improvements stall. After repeating this process dozens of times, the training reaches plateau after about 20 epochs, and the test accuracy can reach 99%! The model is building upon the low-level features that it established from the previous runs while re-learning the output weights to prevent overfitting.</p><p>It took me a while to trust this process, and for a few years I would train from scratch every time. But after I attempted this and saw the training time (not to mention the cost of cloud GPU) go down while the accuracy continued to go up, I started to embrace the process. More importantly, I continue to see the evaluation metrics of the deployed model return solid performances.</p><p>During training, you can apply transformations on your images (called ‚Äúaugmentation‚Äù) to give you more diversity from you data set. With our zoo animals, it is fairly safe to apply left-right flop, slight rotations clockwise and counterclockwise, and slight resize that will zoom in and out.</p><p>With these transformations in mind, make sure your images are still able to act as good training images. In other words, an image where the subject is already small will be even smaller with a zoom out, so you probably want to discard the original. Also, some of your original pictures may need to be re-oriented by 90 degrees to be upright since a further rotation would make them look unusual.</p><p>As I mentioned in <a href=\"https://towardsdatascience.com/learnings-from-a-machine-learning-engineer-part-1-the-data/\">Part 1</a>, you can use the trained model to assist you in labelling images one at a time. But the way to take this even further is to have your newly trained model identify hundreds at a time while building a list of the results that you can then filter.</p><p>Typically, we have large collections of&nbsp;&nbsp;images that have come in either through regular usage of the application or some other means. Recall from <a href=\"https://towardsdatascience.com/learnings-from-a-machine-learning-engineer-part-1-the-data/\">Part 1</a> assigning ‚Äúunknown‚Äù labels to interesting pictures but you have no clue what it is. By using the bulk identification method, we can sift through the collections quickly to target the labelling once we know what they are.</p><p>By combining your current image counts with the bulk identification results, you can target classes that need expanded coverage. Here are a few ways you can leverage bulk identification:</p><ul><li><strong>Increase low image counts</strong>&nbsp;‚Äî Some of your classes may have just barely made the cutoff to be included in the training set, which means you need more examples to improve coverage. Filter for images that have low counts.</li><li><strong>Replace staged or synthetic images</strong>&nbsp;‚Äî Some classes may be built entirely using non-real-world images. These pictures may be good enough to get started with, but may cause performance issues down the road because they look different than what typically comes through. Filter for classes that depend on staged images.</li><li>&nbsp;‚Äî A class in your data set may look like another one. For example, let‚Äôs say your model can identify an antelope, and that looks like a gazelle which your model cannot identify yet. Setting a filter for antelope and a lower confidence score may reveal gazelle images that you can label.</li><li>&nbsp;‚Äî You may not have known how to identify the dozens of cute wallaby pictures, so you saved them under ‚ÄúUnknown‚Äù because it was a good image. Now that you know what it is, you can filter for its look-alike kangaroo and quickly add a new class.</li><li><strong>Mass removal of low scores</strong>&nbsp;‚Äî As a way to clean out your large collection of unlabelled images that have nothing worth labelling, set a filter for lowest scores.</li></ul><p>Recall the decision I made to have image cutoffs from <a href=\"https://towardsdatascience.com/learnings-from-a-machine-learning-engineer-part-2-the-data-sets/\">Part 2</a>, which allows us to ensure an adequate number of example images of a class before we train and server a model to the public. The problem is that you may have a number of classes that are&nbsp;&nbsp;below your cutoff (in my case, 40) and don‚Äôt make it into the model.</p><p>The way I approach this is with a ‚Äúthrow-away‚Äù training run that I do not intend to move to production. I will decrease the lower cutoff from 40 to perhaps 35, build my train-validation-test sets, then train and evaluate like I normally do. The most important part of this is the bulk identification at the end!</p><p>There is a chance that somewhere in the large collection of unlabelled images I will find the few that I need. Doing the bulk identification with this throw-away model helps find them.</p><p>One very important aspect of any machine learning application is being able to show usage and performance reports. Your manager will likely want to see how many times the application is being used to justify the expense, and you as the ML engineer will want to see how the latest model is performing compared to the previous one.</p><p>You should build logging into your model serving to record every transaction going through the system. Also, the manual evaluations from <a href=\"https://towardsdatascience.com/learnings-from-a-machine-learning-engineer-part-3-the-evaluation/\">Part 3</a> should be recorded so you can report on performance for such things as accuracy over time, by model version, by confidence scores, by class, etc. You will be able to detect trends and make adjustments to improve the overall solution.</p><p>There are a lot of reporting tools, so I won‚Äôt recommend one over the other. Just make sure you are collecting as much information as you can to build these dashboards. This will justify the time, effort, and cost associated with maintaining the application.</p><p>We covered a lot of ground across this four-part series on building an image classification project and deploying it in the real world. It all starts with the data, and by investing the time and effort into maintaining the highest quality image library, you can reach impressive levels of model performance that will gain the trust and confidence of your business partners.</p><p>As a <a href=\"https://towardsdatascience.com/tag/machine-learning-engineer/\" title=\"Machine Learning Engineer\">Machine Learning Engineer</a>, you are primarily responsible for building and deploying your model. But it doesn‚Äôt stop there ‚Äî dive into the data. The more familiar you are with the data, the better you will understand the strengths and weaknesses of your model. Take a close look at the evaluations and use them as an opportunity to adjust the data set.</p><p>I hope these articles have helped you find new ways to improve your own machine learning project. And by the way, don‚Äôt let the machine do all the learning ‚Äî as humans, our job is to continue our own learning, so don‚Äôt ever stop!</p><p>Thank you for taking this deep dive with me into a data-driven approach to model optimization.

For this post, we use the <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/cohere-command-embed/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Cohere v3 Embed</a> model on Amazon Bedrock to create our language embeddings.</p><p>To demonstrate some of the possible uses of these language embeddings, we developed an RSS aggregator website. RSS is a web feed that allows publications to publish updates in a standardized, computer-readable way. On our website, users can subscribe to an RSS feed and have an aggregated, categorized list of the new articles. We use embeddings to add the following functionalities:</p><p>This post uses this application as a reference point to discuss the technical implementation of the semantic search and zero-shot classification features.</p><p>This solution uses the following services:</p><p>The following diagram illustrates the solution architecture.</p><p>This section offers a quick primer on what embeddings are and how they can be used.</p><p>Embeddings are numerical representations of concepts or objects, such as language or images. In this post, we discuss language embeddings. By reducing these concepts to numerical representations, we can then use them in a way that a computer can understand and operate on.</p><p>Let‚Äôs take Berlin and Paris as an example. As humans, we understand the conceptual links between these two words. Berlin and Paris are both cities, they‚Äôre capitals of their respective countries, and they‚Äôre both in Europe. We understand their conceptual similarities almost instinctively, because we can create a model of the world in our head. However, computers have no built-in way of representing these concepts.</p><p>To represent these concepts in a way a computer can understand, we convert them into language embeddings. Language embeddings are high dimensional vectors that learn their relationships with each other through the training of a neural network. During training, the neural network is exposed to enormous amounts of text and learns patterns based on how words are colocated and relate to each other in different contexts.</p><p>Embedding vectors allow computers to model the world from language. For instance, if we embed ‚ÄúBerlin‚Äù and ‚ÄúParis,‚Äù we can now perform mathematical operations on these embeddings. We can then observe some fairly interesting relationships. For instance, we could do the following: Paris ‚Äì France + Germany ~= Berlin. This is because the embeddings capture the relationships between the words ‚ÄúParis‚Äù and ‚ÄúFrance‚Äù and between ‚ÄúGermany‚Äù and ‚ÄúBerlin‚Äù‚Äîspecifically, that Paris and Berlin are both capital cities of their respective countries.</p><p>The following graph shows the word vector distance between countries and their respective capitals.</p><p>Subtracting ‚ÄúFrance‚Äù from ‚ÄúParis‚Äù removes the country semantics, leaving a vector representing the concept of a capital city. Adding ‚ÄúGermany‚Äù to this vector, we are left with something closely resembling ‚ÄúBerlin,‚Äù the capital of Germany. The vectors for this relationship are shown in the following graph.</p><p>For our use case, we use the pre-trained Cohere Embeddings model in Amazon Bedrock, which embeds entire texts rather than a single word. The embeddings represent the meaning of the text and can be operated on using mathematical operations. This property can be useful to map relationships such as similarity between texts.</p><p>One way in which we use language embeddings is by using their properties to calculate how similar an article is to one of the topics.</p><p>To do this, we break down a topic into a series of different and related embeddings. For instance, for culture, we have a set of embeddings for sports, TV programs, music, books, and so on. We then embed the incoming title and description of the RSS articles, and calculate the similarity against the topic embeddings. From this, we can assign topic labels to an article.</p><p>The following figure illustrates how this works. The embeddings that Cohere generates are highly dimensional, containing 1,024 values (or dimensions). However, to demonstrate how this system works, we use an algorithm designed to reduce the dimensionality of the embeddings, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T-distributed_stochastic_neighbor_embedding\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE)</a>, so that we can view them in two dimensions. The following image uses these embeddings to visualize how topics are clustered based on similarity and meaning.</p><p>You can use the embedding of an article and check the similarity of the article against the preceding embeddings. You can then say that if an article is clustered closely to one of these embeddings, it can be classified with the associated topic.</p><p>This is the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-nearest_neighbors_algorithm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) algorithm</a>. This algorithm is used to perform classification and regression tasks. In k-NN, you can make assumptions around a data point based on its proximity to other data points. For instance, you can say that an article that has proximity to the music topic shown in the preceding diagram can be tagged with the culture topic.</p><p>The following figure demonstrates this with an <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/07/the-climate-is-changing-so-fast-that-we-havent-seen-how-bad-extreme-weather-could-get/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">ArsTechnica article</a>. We plot against the embedding of an article‚Äôs title and description: (The climate is changing so fast that we haven‚Äôt seen how bad extreme weather could get: Decades-old statistics no longer represent what is possible in the present day).</p><p>The advantage of this approach is that you can add custom, user-generated topics. You can create a topic by first creating a series of embeddings of conceptually related items. For instance, an AI topic would be similar to the embeddings for AI, Generative AI, LLM, and Anthropic, as shown in the following screenshot.</p><p>In a traditional classification system, we‚Äôd be required to train a classifier‚Äîa supervised learning task where we‚Äôd need to provide a series of examples to establish whether an article belongs to its respective topic. Doing so can be quite an intensive task, requiring labeled data and training the model. For our use case, we can provide examples, create a cluster, and tag articles without having to provide labeled examples or train additional models. This is shown in the following screenshot of results page of our website.</p><p>In our application, we ingest new articles on a schedule. We use EventBridge schedules to periodically call a Lambda function, which checks if there are new articles. If there are, it creates an embedding from them using Amazon Bedrock and Cohere.</p><p>We calculate the article‚Äôs distance to the different topic embeddings, and can then determine whether the article belongs to that category. This is done with Aurora PostgreSQL with pgvector. We store the embeddings of the topics and then calculate their distance using the following SQL query:</p><div><pre><code>const topics = await sqlClient.then(it=&gt; it.query(\n    `SELECT name, embedding_description, similarity\n     FROM (SELECT topic_id as name, embedding_description, (1- ABS( 1 ‚Äì(embed.embedding &lt;-&gt; $1))) AS \"similarity\" FROM topic_embedding_link embed)  topics\n     ORDER BY similarity desc`,\n    [toSql(articleEmbedding)]\n  ))\n</code></pre></div><p>The &lt;-&gt; operator in the preceding code calculates the Euclidean distance between the article and the topic embedding. This number allows us to understand how close an article is to one of the topics. We can then determine the appropriateness of a topic based on this ranking.</p><p>We then tag the article with the topic. We do this so that the subsequent request for a topic is as computationally as light as possible; we do a simple join rather than calculating the Euclidean distance.</p><div><div><pre><code>const formattedTopicInsert = pgformat(\n    `INSERT INTO feed_article_topic_link(topic_id, feed_article_id) VALUES %L ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING`,\n    topicLinks\n  )</code></pre></div></div><p>We also cache a specific topic/feed combination because these are calculated hourly and aren‚Äôt expected to change in the interim.</p><p>As previously discussed, the embeddings produced by Cohere contain a multitude of features; they embed the meanings and semantics of a word of phrase. We‚Äôve also found that we can perform mathematical operations on these embeddings to do things such as calculate the similarity between two phrases or words.</p><p>We can use these embeddings and calculate the similarity between a search term and an embedding of an article with the k-NN algorithm to find articles that have similar semantics and meanings to the search term we‚Äôve provided.</p><p>For example, in one of our RSS feeds, we have a lot of different articles that rate products. In a traditional search system, we‚Äôd rely on keyword matches to provide relevant results. Although it might be simple to find a specific article (for example, by searching ‚Äúbest digital notebooks‚Äù), we would need a different method to capture multiple product list articles.</p><p>In a semantic search system, we first transform the term ‚ÄúProduct list‚Äù in an embedding. We can then use the properties of this embedding to perform a search within our embedding space. Using the k-NN algorithm, we can find articles that are semantically similar. As shown in the following screenshot, despite not containing the text ‚ÄúProduct list‚Äù in either the title or description, we‚Äôve been able to find articles that contain a product list. This is because we were able to capture the semantics of the query and match it to the existing embeddings we have for each article.</p><p>In our application, we store these embeddings using pgvector on Aurora PostgreSQL. pgvector is an open source extension that enables vector similarity search in PostgreSQL. We transform our search term into an embedding using Amazon Bedrock and Cohere v3 Embed.</p><p>After we‚Äôve converted the search term to an embedding, we can compare it with the embeddings on the article that have been saved during the ingestion process. We can then use pgvector to find articles that are clustered together. The SQL code for that is as follows:</p><div><pre><code>SELECT *\nFROM (\n    SELECT feed_articles.id as id, title, feed_articles.feed_id as feed, feedName, slug, description, url, author, image, published_at as published, 1 - ABS(1 - (embedding &lt;-&gt; $2)) AS \"similarity\"\n    FROM feed_articles\n    INNER JOIN (select feed_id, name as feedName from feed_user_subscription fus where fus.user_id=$1) sub on feed_articles.feed_id=sub.feed_id\n    ${feedId != undefined ? `WHERE feed_articles.feed_id = $4` : \"\"}\n)\nWHERE similarity &gt; 0.95\nORDER BY similarity desc\nLIMIT $3;\n</code></pre></div><p>This code calculates the distance between the topics, and the embedding of this article as ‚Äúsimilarity.‚Äù If this distance is close, then we can assume that the topic of the article is related, and we therefore attach the topic to the article.</p><p>To deploy this application in your own account, you need the following prerequisites:</p><ul><li>Model access for Cohere Embed English.

Also, we talked about classes and sub-classes of your data. These may seem pretty straight forward concepts, but it‚Äôs important to have a solid understanding going forward. So, if you haven‚Äôt, please check it out.</p><p>Now we will discuss how to build the various data sets and the techniques that have worked well for my application. Then in the <a href=\"https://towardsdatascience.com/learnings-from-a-machine-learning-engineer-part-3-the-evaluation/\">next part</a>, we will dive into the evaluation of your models, beyond simple accuracy.</p><p>I will again use the example zoo animals image classification app.</p><p>As machine learning engineers, we are all familiar with the train-validation-test sets, but when we include the concept of sub-classes discussed in <a href=\"https://towardsdatascience.com/learnings-from-a-machine-learning-engineer-part-1-the-data/\">Part 1</a>, and incorporate to concepts discussed below to set a minimum and maximum image count per class, as well as staged and synthetic data to the mix, the process gets a bit more complicated. I had to create a custom script to handle these options.</p><p>I will walk you through these concepts before we split the data for training:</p><ul><li>&nbsp;‚Äî Too few images and your model performance will suffer. Too many and you spend more time training than it‚Äôs worth.</li><li>&nbsp;‚Äî Your model indicates how confident it is in the predictions. Let‚Äôs use that to decide when to present results to the user.</li><li>&nbsp;‚Äî Real-world data is messy and the benchmark sets should reflect that. These need to stretch the model to the limit and help us decide when it is ready for production.</li><li><strong>Staged and synthetic data</strong>&nbsp;‚Äî Real-world data is king, but sometimes you need to produce the your own or even generate data to get off the ground. Be careful it doesn‚Äôt hurt performance.</li><li>&nbsp;‚Äî Repeat data can skew your results and give you a false sense of performance. Make sure your data is diverse.</li><li>&nbsp;‚Äî Combine sub-classes, apply cutoffs, and create your train-validation-test sets. Now we are ready to get the show started.</li></ul><p>In my experience, using a minimum of 40 images per class provides descent performance. Since I like to use 10% each for the test set and validation set, that means at least 4 images will be used to check the training set, which feels just barely adequate. Using fewer than 40 images per class, I notice my model evaluation tends to suffer.</p><p>On the other end, I set a maximum of about 125 images per class. I have found that the performance gains tend to plateau beyond this, so having more data will slow down the training run with little to show for it. Having more than the maximum is fine, and these ‚Äúoverflow‚Äù can be added to the test set, so they don‚Äôt go to waste.</p><p>There are times when I will drop the minimum cutoff to, say 35, with no intention of moving the trained model to production. Instead, the purpose is to leverage this throw-away model to find more images from my unlabelled set. This is a technique that I will go into more detail in <a href=\"https://towardsdatascience.com/learnings-from-a-machine-learning-engineer-part-3-the-evaluation/\">Part 3</a>.</p><p>You are likely familiar with the softmax score. As a reminder, softmax is the probability assigned to each label. I like to think of it as a confidence score, and we are interested in the class that receives the highest confidence. Softmax is a value between zero and one, but I find it easier to interpret confidence scores between zero and 100, like a percentage.</p><p>In order to decide if the model is confident enough with its prediction, I have chosen a threshold of 95. I use this threshold when determining if I want to present results to the user.</p><p>Scores above the threshold have a better changes of being right, so I can confidently provide the results. Scores below the threshold may not be right ‚Äî in fact it could be ‚Äúout-of-scope‚Äù, meaning it‚Äôs something the model doesn‚Äôt know how to identify. So, instead of taking the risk of presenting incorrect results, I instead prompt the user to try again and offer suggestions on how to take a ‚Äúgood‚Äù picture.</p><p>Admittedly this is somewhat arbitrary cutoff, and you should decide for your use-case what is appropriate. In fact, this score could probably be adjusted for each trained model, but this would make it harder to compare performance across models.</p><p>I will refer to this confidence score frequently in the evaluations section in <a href=\"https://towardsdatascience.com/learnings-from-a-machine-learning-engineer-part-3-the-evaluation/\">Part 3</a>.</p><p>Let me introduce what I call the benchmark sets, which you can think of as extended test sets. These are hand-picked images designed to stretch the limits of your model, and provide a measure for specific classes of your data. Use these benchmarks to justify moving your model to production, and for an objective measure to show to your manager.</p><ul><li>&nbsp;‚Äî These are the ‚Äúextra credit‚Äù images, like the bonus questions a professor would add to the quiz to see which students are paying attention. You need a keen eye to spot the difference between the ground truth and a similar looking class. For example, a cheetah sleeping in the shade that could pass as a leopard if you don‚Äôt look closely.</li><li>&nbsp;‚Äî These are the ‚Äútrick question‚Äù images. Our model is trained on zoo animals, but people are known for not following the rules. For example, a zoo guest takes a picture of their child wearing cheetah face paint.</li><li>&nbsp;‚Äî These are your ‚Äúbread and butter‚Äù classes that need to get near perfect scores and zero errors. This would be a make-or-break benchmark for moving to production.</li><li>&nbsp;‚Äî These are your ‚Äúrare but exceptional‚Äù classes that again need to be correct, but reach a minimum score like the confidence threshold.</li></ul><p>When looking for images to add to the benchmarks, you can likely find them in real-world images from your deployed model. See the evaluation in <a href=\"https://towardsdatascience.com/learnings-from-a-machine-learning-engineer-part-3-the-evaluation/\">Part 3</a>.</p><p>For each benchmark, calculate the min, max, median, and mean scores, and also how many images get scores above and below the confidence threshold. Now you can compare these measures against what is currently in production, and against your minimum requirements, to help decide if the new model is production worthy.</p><p>Perhaps the biggest hurdle to any supervised machine learning application is having data to train the model. Clearly, ‚Äúreal-world‚Äù data that comes from actual users of the application is ideal. However you can‚Äôt really collect these until the model is deployed. Chicken and egg problem.</p><p>One way to get started to is to have volunteers collect ‚Äústaged‚Äù images for you, trying to act like real users. So, let‚Äôs have our zoo staff go around taking pictures of the animals. This is a good start, but there will be a certain level of bias introduced in these images. For example, the staff may take the photos over a few days, so you may not get the year-round weather conditions.</p><p>Another way to get pictures is use computer-generated ‚Äúsynthetic‚Äù images. I would avoid these at all costs, to be honest. Based on my experience, the model struggles with these because they look‚Ä¶different. The lighting is not natural, the subject may superimposed on a background and so the edges look too sharp, etc. Granted, some of the AI generated images look very realistic, but if you look closely you may spot something unusual. The neural network in your model will notice these, so be careful.</p><p>The way that I handle these staged or synthetic images is as a sub-class that gets merged into the training set, but only&nbsp;&nbsp;giving preference to the real-world images. I cap the number of staged images to 60, so if I have 10 real-world, I now only need 50 staged. Eventually, these staged and synthetic images are phased out completely, and I rely entirely on real-world.</p><p>One problem that can creep into your image set are duplicate images. These can be exact copies of pictures, or they can be extremely similar. You may think that this is harmless, but imagine having 100 pictures of an elephant that are exactly the same ‚Äî your model will not know what to do with a different angle of the elephant.</p><p>Now, let‚Äôs say you have only&nbsp;&nbsp;pictures that are nearly the same. Not so bad, right? Well, here is what can happen to them:</p><ul><li>Both pictures go in the training set ‚Äî The model doesn‚Äôt learn anything from the repeated image and it wastes time processing them.</li><li>One goes into the training set, the other goes into the test set ‚Äî Your test score will be higher, but it is not an accurate evaluation.</li><li>Both are in the test set ‚Äî Your test score will be compounded either higher or lower than it should be.</li></ul><p>None of these will help your model.</p><p>There are a few ways to find duplicates. The approach I have taken is to calculate a hamming distance on all the pictures and identify the ones that are very close. I have an interface that displays the duplicates and I decide which one I like best, and remove the other.</p><p>Another way (I haven‚Äôt tried this yet) is to create a vector representation of your images. Store these a vector database, and you can do a similarity search to find nearly identical images.</p><p>Whatever method you use, it is important to clean up the duplicates.</p><p>Now we are ready to build the traditional training, validation, and test sets. This is no longer a straight forward task since I want to:</p><ol><li>Merge sub-classes into a main class.</li><li>Prioritize real-world images over staged or synthetic images.</li><li>Apply a minimum number of images per class.</li><li>Apply a maximum number of images per class, sending the ‚Äúoverflow‚Äù to the test set.</li></ol><p>This process is somewhat complicated and depends on how you manage your image library. First, I would recommend keeping your images in a folder structure that has sub-class folders. You can get image counts by using a script to simply read the folders. Second is to keep a configuration of how the sub-classes are merged. To really set yourself up for success, put these image counts and merge rules in a database for faster lookups.</p><p>My train-validation-test set splits are usually 90‚Äì10‚Äì0. I originally started out using 80‚Äì10‚Äì10, but with diligence on keeping the entire data set clean, I noticed validation and test scores became pretty even. This allowed me to increase the training set size, and use ‚Äúoverflow‚Äù to become the test set, as well as using the benchmark sets.</p><p>In this part, we‚Äôve built our data sets by merging sub-classes and using the image count cutoffs.

It was clear that I needed to cover them. But that raised an interesting challenge: How do you teach new and intermediate developers to use AI effectively?</p><p>Almost all of the material that I found was aimed at senior developers‚Äîpeople who can recognize patterns in code, spot the subtle errors often found in AI-generated code, and refine and refactor AI output. But the audience for the book‚Äîa developer learning C# as their first, second, or third language‚Äîdoesn‚Äôt yet have these skills. It became increasingly clear that they would need a new strategy.</p><p>Designing an effective AI learning path that worked with the Head First method‚Äîwhich engages readers through active learning and interactive puzzles, exercises, and other elements‚Äîtook months of intense research and experimentation. The result was , a new series of hands-on elements that I designed to teach developers how to learn with AI, not just generate code. The name is a play on ‚Äúsensei,‚Äù reflecting the role of AI as a teacher or instructor rather than just a tool.</p><p>The key realization was that there‚Äôs a big difference between using AI as a code generation tool and using it as a learning tool. That distinction is a critical part of the learning path, and it took time to fully understand. Sens-AI guides learners through a series of incremental learning elements that get them working with AI immediately, creating a satisfying experience from the start while they progressively learn the prompting skills they‚Äôll lean on as their development skills grow.</p><h2>The Challenge of Building an AI Learning Path That Works</h2><p>I developed Sens-AI for the fifth edition of . After more than two decades of writing and teaching for O‚ÄôReilly, I‚Äôve learned a lot about how new and intermediate developers learn‚Äîand just as importantly, what trips them up. In some ways AI-assisted coding is just another skill to learn, but it comes with its own challenges that make it uniquely difficult for new and intermediate learners to pick up. My goal was to find a way to integrate AI into the learning path without letting it short-circuit the learning process.</p><h3>Step 1: Show Learners Why They Can‚Äôt Just Trust AI</h3><p>One of the biggest challenges for new and intermediate developers trying to integrate AI into their learning is that an overreliance on AI-generated code <em>can actually prevent them from learning</em>. Coding is a skill, and like all skills it takes practice, which is why  has dozens of hands-on coding exercises designed to teach specific concepts and techniques. A learner who uses AI to do the exercises will struggle to build those skills.</p><p>The key to using AI safely is ‚ÄîAI-generated explanations and code may look correct, but they often contain subtle mistakes. Learning to spot these errors is critical for using AI effectively, and developing that skill is an important stepping stone on the path to becoming a senior developer. The first step in Sens-AI was to make this lesson clear immediately. I designed an early Sens-AI exercise to demonstrate how AI can be confidently wrong.</p><ul><li>Early in the book, learners complete a pencil-and-paper exercise where they analyze a simple loop and determine how many times it executes.</li><li>Most readers get the correct answer, but when they feed the same question into an AI chatbot, the AI almost never gets it right.</li><li>The AI typically explains the logic of the loop well‚Äîbut its final answer is , because LLM-based AIs don‚Äôt execute code.</li><li>This reinforces an important lesson: AI can be wrong‚Äîand sometimes, you are better at solving problems than AI. By seeing AI make a mistake on a problem they already solved correctly, learners immediately understand that they can‚Äôt just assume AI is right.</li></ul><h3>Step 2: Show Learners That AI Still Requires Effort</h3><p>The next challenge was teaching learners to see AI as a tool, not a crutch. AI can solve almost all of the exercises in the book, but a reader who lets AI do that won‚Äôt actually learn the skills they came to the book to learn.</p><p>This led to an important realization: Writing a coding exercise for a person is exactly the same as writing a prompt for an AI.</p><p>In fact, I realized that I could test my exercises by pasting them verbatim into an AI. If the AI was able to generate a correct solution, that meant my exercise contained all the information a human learner needed to solve it too.</p><p>This turned into another key Sens-AI exercise:</p><ul><li>Learners complete a full-page coding exercise by following step-by-step instructions.</li><li>After solving it themselves, they paste the entire exercise into an AI chatbot to see how it solves the same problem.</li><li>The AI almost always generates the correct answer, and it often generates exactly the same solution they wrote.</li></ul><p>This reinforces another critical lesson: Telling an AI what to do is just as difficult as telling a person what to do. Many new developers assume that prompt engineering is just writing a quick instruction‚Äîbut Sens-AI demonstrates that a good AI prompt is as detailed and structured as a coding exercise. This gives learners an immediate hands-on experience with AI while teaching them that writing effective prompts requires real effort.</p><p>By first having the learner see that AIs can make mistakes, and then having them generate code for a problem they solved and compare it to their own solution‚Äîand even use the AI‚Äôs code source of ideas for refactoring‚Äîthey gain a deeper understanding of how to engage with AI critically. These two opening Sens-AI elements laid the groundwork for a successful AI learning path.</p><h2>The Sens-AI Approach‚ÄîMaking AI a Learning Tool</h2><p>The final challenge in developing the Sens-AI approach was finding a way to help learners <strong>develop a habit of engaging with AI in a positive way</strong>. Solving that problem required me to develop a series of practical exercises, each of which gives the learner a specific tool that they can use immediately but also reinforces a positive lesson about how to use AI effectively.</p><p>One of AI‚Äôs most powerful features for developers is its ability to explain code. I built the next Sens-AI element around this by having learners ask AI to add comments to code they just wrote. Since they already understand their own code, they can evaluate the AI‚Äôs comments‚Äîchecking whether the AI understood their logic, spotting where it went wrong, and identifying gaps in its explanations. This provides hands-on training in prompting AI while reinforcing a key lesson: AI doesn‚Äôt always get it right, and reviewing its output critically is essential.</p><p>The next step in the Sens-AI learning path focuses on using , helping learners explore C# topics effectively through prompt engineering techniques. Learners experiment with different AI personas and response styles‚Äîcasual versus precise explanations, bullet points versus long answers‚Äîto see what works best for them. They‚Äôre also encouraged to ask follow-up questions, request reworded explanations, and ask for concrete examples that they can use to refine their understanding. To put this into practice, learners research a new C# topic that wasn‚Äôt covered earlier in the book. This reinforces the idea that <em>AI is a useful research tool, but only if you guide it effectively</em>.</p><p>Sens-AI focuses on understanding code first, generating code second. That‚Äôs why the learning path only returns to AI-generated code after reinforcing good AI habits. Even then, I had to carefully design exercises to ensure AI was an aid to learning, not a replacement for it. After experimenting with different approaches, I found that generating unit tests was an effective next step.</p><p>Unit tests work well because their logic is simple and easy to verify, making them a safe way to practice AI-assisted coding. More importantly, writing a good prompt for a unit test forces the learner to describe the code they‚Äôre testing‚Äîincluding its behavior, arguments, and return type. This naturally builds strong prompting skills and positive AI habits, encouraging developers to think carefully about their design before asking AI to generate anything.</p><h2>Learning  AI, Not Just Using It</h2><p>AI is a powerful tool for developers, but using it effectively requires more than just knowing how to generate code. The biggest mistake new developers can make with AI is using it as a crutch for generating code, because that keeps them from learning the coding skills they need to critically evaluate all of the code that AI generates. By giving learners a step-by-step approach that reinforces safe use of AI and great AI habits, and reinforcing it with examples and practice, Sens-AI gives new and intermediate learners an effective AI learning path that works for them.</p><p>AI-assisted coding isn‚Äôt about shortcuts. It‚Äôs about learning how to think critically, and about using AI as a positive tool to help us build and learn. Developers who engage critically with AI, refine their prompts, question AI-generated output, and develop effective AI learning habits will be the ones who benefit the most. By helping developers include AI as a part of their skillset from the start, Sens-AI ensures that they don‚Äôt just use AI to generate code‚Äîthey learn how to think, problem-solve, and improve as developers in the process.</p><p><em>On April 24, O‚ÄôReilly Media will be hosting </em><strong>Coding with AI: The End of Software Development as We Know It</strong><em>‚Äîa live virtual tech conference spotlighting how AI is already supercharging developers, boosting productivity, and providing real value to their organizations.

Many use cases involve using pre-trained large language models (LLMs) through approaches like Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG). However, for advanced, domain-specific tasks or those requiring specific formats, model customization techniques such as fine-tuning are sometimes necessary. <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Amazon Bedrock</a> provides you with the ability to customize leading foundation models (FMs) such as Anthropic‚Äôs Claude 3 Haiku and Meta‚Äôs Llama 3.1.</p><p>Amazon Bedrock is a fully managed service that makes FMs from leading AI startups and Amazon available through an API, so you can choose from a wide range of FMs to find the model that is best suited for your use case. Amazon Bedrock offers a serverless experience, so you can get started quickly, privately customize FMs with your own data, and integrate and deploy them into your applications using AWS tools without having to manage any infrastructure.</p><p>Fine-tuning is a supervised training process where labeled prompt and response pairs are used to further train a pre-trained model to improve its performance for a particular use case. One consistent pain point of fine-tuning is the lack of data to effectively customize these models. Gathering relevant data is difficult, and maintaining its quality is another hurdle. Furthermore, fine-tuning LLMs requires substantial resource commitment. In such scenarios, synthetic data generation offers a promising solution. You can create synthetic training data using a larger language model and use it to fine-tune a smaller model, which has the benefit of a quicker turnaround time.</p><p>In this post, we explore how to use Amazon Bedrock to generate synthetic training data to fine-tune an LLM. Additionally, we provide concrete evaluation results that showcase the power of synthetic data in fine-tuning when data is scarce.</p><p>The solution comprises two main steps:</p><ol><li>Generate synthetic data using the Amazon Bedrock InvokeModel API.</li><li>Fine-tune using an Amazon Bedrock custom model.</li></ol><p>For synthetic data generation, we use a larger language model (such as <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/claude/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Anthropic‚Äôs Claude 3 Sonnet on Amazon Bedrock</a>) as the teacher model, and a smaller language model (such as Anthropic‚Äôs Claude Instant 1.2 or Claude 3 Haiku on Amazon Bedrock) as the student model for fine-tuning. We use the larger teacher model to generate new data based on its knowledge, which is then used to train the smaller student model. This concept is similar to knowledge distillation used in deep learning, except that we‚Äôre using the teacher model to generate a new dataset from its knowledge rather than directly modifying the architecture of the student model.</p><p>The following diagram illustrates the overall flow of the solution.</p><p>Finally, we share our experiment results, where we compare the performance of the model fine-tuned with synthetic data to the baseline (not fine-tuned) model and to a model fine-tuned with an equal amount of original training data.</p><p>To generate synthetic data and fine-tune models using Amazon Bedrock, you first need to create an <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/iam/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)</a> service role with the appropriate permissions. This role is used by Amazon Bedrock to access the necessary resources on your behalf.</p><p>If you‚Äôre running this code using an <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Amazon SageMaker</a> notebook instance, edit the IAM role that‚Äôs attached to the notebook (for example, AmazonSageMaker-ExecutionRole-XXX) instead of creating a new role.

You can use the API to programmatically send an inference (text generation) request to the model of your choice. All you need is a well-crafted prompt tailored for data synthesis. We used the following sample prompt for our use case:</p><div><pre><code>PROMPT = \"\"\"\nYou are an AI assistant who is an expert in Amazon services. Your task is to understand a system that takes in a list of documents, and based on that, answers a question by providing citations for the documents that it referred the answer from.\n\nYour job is to generate three new Question/Answer pairs, emulating the tone, style, and grammar of the original data provided.\n\nHere is the original data :\nInput Documents and Question : {document}\\n\\nQuestion: {question}\nOutput Answer : {answer}\n\nStrictly return a jsonl with the keys (question, answer, topic). Every topic should be different. The answers should be in the exact same format as the original. The question and the answer should be different in content from the original data provided, and all questions should be diverse and different from each other. Do not answer in any other format. The response should be parsable as a jsonl.\n\"\"\"</code></pre></div><p>The goal of our use case was to fine-tune a model to generate a relevant and coherent answer based on a given reference document and a question. RAG is a popular technique used for such Q&amp;A tasks; however, one significant challenge with RAG is the potential for retrieving unrelated or irrelevant documents, which can lead to inaccurate responses. You can apply fine-tuning to guide the model to better focus on the relevance of the documents to the question instead of using the provided documents without context to answer the question.</p><p>Our dataset includes Q&amp;A pairs with reference documents regarding AWS services.

However, you can adjust the number as needed. The crucial part is to make the model think deeply about a variety of topics. Because the purpose of generating synthetic data is to enrich the training dataset, it‚Äôs more beneficial to have the model look at different parts of the documents and create Q&amp;A pairs with different topics than the original.</p><p>The following example shows how to generate synthetic data with the Amazon Bedrock InvokeModel API.

For evaluation methods, we used an LLM-as-a-judge approach, where a judge model compares responses from two different models and picks a better response. Additionally, we conducted a manual evaluation on a small subset to assess whether the LLM-as-a-judge and human judges have aligned preferences.</p><p>We carried out controlled experiments where we compared four different models as follows: 1,500 synthetic training samples for the 4 model were generated by Anthropic‚Äôs Claude 3 Sonnet, and we created three synthetic samples per one original reference document (3 samples * 500 original reference documents = 1,500 synthetic samples).</p><table border=\"1px\" cellpadding=\"10px\"><tbody><tr><td width=\"634\">Anthropic‚Äôs Claude Instant without any customization</td></tr><tr><td width=\"634\">Anthropic‚Äôs Claude Instant fine-tuned with 500 original training samples</td></tr><tr><td width=\"169\"></td><td width=\"634\">Anthropic‚Äôs Claude Instant fine-tuned with 2,000 original training samples</td></tr><tr><td width=\"169\"></td><td width=\"634\">Anthropic‚Äôs Claude Instant fine-tuned with 500 original training samples plus 1,500 synthetic training samples</td></tr></tbody></table><p>LLM output evaluation is an important step in developing generative AI applications, but it is expensive and takes considerable time if done manually. An alternative solution to systematically evaluate output quality in large volume is the LLM-as-a-judge approach, where an LLM is used to evaluate another LLM‚Äôs responses.</p><p>For our use case, we used Anthropic‚Äôs Claude 3 Sonnet and Meta Llama 3 70B as the judges. We asked the LLM judges to compare outputs from two different models and choose one over the other or state a tie. The following chart summarizes the judges‚Äô decisions. Each number represents the percentage of times when the respective model was selected as providing a better answer, excluding tie cases. The test set contained 343 samples.</p><p>As shown in the preceding chart, the Anthropic‚Äôs Claude 3 Sonnet judge preferred the response from the fine-tuned model with synthetic examples over the Anthropic‚Äôs Claude Instant base model (84.8% preference) and the fine-tuned model with original 500 samples (72.3% preference). However, the judge concluded that the fine-tuned model with 2,000 original examples was preferred over the fine-tuned model with synthetic examples (32.3% preference). This aligns with the expectation that when large, high-quality original data is available, it‚Äôs better to use the large training data that accurately reflects the target data distribution.</p><p>The Meta Llama judge reached a similar conclusion. As shown in the preceding chart, it preferred the response from the fine-tuned model with synthetic samples over the Anthropic‚Äôs Claude Instant base model (75.6% preference) and the fine-tuned model with original 500 examples (76.4% preference), but the fine-tuned model with 2,000 original examples was the ultimate winner.</p><p>To complement the LLM-as-a-judge result, we conducted manual evaluation with two human judges. We asked the two human evaluators to perform the same pairwise comparison task as the LLM judge, but for 20 examples. The following chart summarizes the results.</p><p>As shown in the preceding chart, the two human evaluators reached a similar conclusion, reinforcing the LLM-as-a-judge result. The fine-tuned model with synthetic examples produced outputs that were more preferable than the Anthropic‚Äôs Claude Instant base model and the fine-tuned model with the original 500 examples; however, it didn‚Äôt outperform the fine-tuned model with the 2,000 original examples.</p><p>These comparative evaluation results from both the LLM judges and human judges strongly demonstrate the power and potential of using data synthesis when training data is scarce. Moreover, by using high-quality data from the teacher model, we can effectively train the student model, which is lightweight and cost-effective for deployment in a production environment.</p><h3>Amazon Bedrock evaluations</h3><p>Running LLM-as-a-judge and human evaluation has become much easier with Amazon Bedrock. Model evaluation on Amazon Bedrock allows you to evaluate, compare, and select the best FMs for your use case. Human evaluation workflows can use your own employees or an AWS-managed team as reviewers.

We provided instructions on generating synthetic data using the Amazon Bedrock InvokeModel API and fine-tuning the student model using an Amazon Bedrock custom model. Our evaluation results, based on both an LLM-as-a-judge approach and human evaluation, demonstrated the effectiveness of synthetic data in improving the student model‚Äôs performance when original training data is limited.</p><p>Although fine-tuning with a large amount of high-quality original data remains the ideal approach, our findings highlight the promising potential of synthetic data generation as a viable solution when dealing with data scarcity.

Trained on broad, generic datasets spanning a wide range of topics and domains, LLMs use their parametric knowledge to perform increasingly complex and versatile tasks across multiple business use cases. Furthermore, companies are increasingly investing resources in customizing LLMs through few-shot learning and fine-tuning to optimize their performance for specialized applications.</p><p>However, the impressive performance of LLMs comes at the cost of significant computational requirements, driven by their large number of parameters and autoregressive decoding process which is sequential in nature. This combination makes achieving low latency a challenge for use cases such as real-time text completion, simultaneous translation, or conversational voice assistants, where subsecond response times are critical.</p><p>Researchers developed <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10774\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Medusa</a>, a framework to speed up LLM inference by adding extra heads to predict multiple tokens simultaneously. This post demonstrates how to use Medusa-1, the first version of the framework, to speed up an LLM by fine-tuning it on <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker-ai/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Amazon SageMaker AI</a> and confirms the speed up with deployment and a simple load test. Medusa-1 achieves an inference speedup of around two times without sacrificing model quality, with the exact improvement varying based on model size and data used. In this post, we demonstrate its effectiveness with a 1.8 times speedup observed on a sample dataset.</p><h2>Introduction to Medusa and its benefits for LLM inference speed</h2><p>LLMs generate text in a sequential manner, which involves autoregressive sampling, with each new token conditional on the previous ones. Generating K tokens necessitates K sequential executions of the model. This token-by-token processing introduces an inherent latency and computational overhead because the model needs to perform a separate forward pass for each new token in the output sequence. The following diagram from <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/371123751_Role-Play_with_Large_Language_Models\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Role-Play with Large Language Models</a> illustrates this flow.</p><p>Speculative decoding tackles this challenge by using a smaller, faster draft model to generate multiple potential token continuations in parallel, which are then verified by a larger, more accurate target model. This parallelization speeds up text generation while maintaining the quality of the target model because the verification task is faster than autoregressive token generation. For a detailed explanation of the concept, refer to the paper <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.01318\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Accelerating Large Language Model Decoding with Speculative Sampling</a>. The speculative decoding technique can be implemented using the <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/achieve-up-to-2x-higher-throughput-while-reducing-costs-by-50-for-generative-ai-inference-on-amazon-sagemaker-with-the-new-inference-optimization-toolkit-part-1/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">inference optimization toolkit</a> on <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker-ai/jumpstart/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Amazon SageMaker Jumpstart</a>.</p><p>The paper <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10774\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Medusa: Simple LLM Inference Acceleration Framework with Multiple Decoding Heads</a> introduced Medusa as an alternative to speculative decoding. Instead of adding a separate draft model, it adds extra decoding heads to the LLM that generate candidate continuations simultaneously. These candidates are then evaluated in parallel using a tree-based attention mechanism. This parallel processing reduces the number of sequential steps needed, leading to faster inference times. The main advantage of Medusa over speculative decoding is that it eliminates the need to acquire and maintain a separate draft model while achieving higher speedups. For example, when tested on the <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14762\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">MT-Bench dataset</a>, the paper reports that Medusa-2 (the second version of Medusa) speeds up inference time by 2.8 times. This outperforms speculative decoding, which only manages to speed up inference time by 1.5 times on the same dataset.</p><p>The Medusa framework currently supports Llama and Mistral models. Although it offers significant speed improvements, it does come with a memory trade-off (similar to speculative decoding). For instance, adding five Medusa heads to the 7-billion-parameter Mistral model increases the total parameter count by 750 million (150 million per head), which means these additional parameters must be stored in GPU memory, leading to a higher memory requirement. However, in most cases, this increase doesn‚Äôt necessitate switching to a higher GPU memory instance. For example, you can still use an  instance with 24 GB of GPU memory to host your 7-billion-parameter Llama or Mistral model with extra Medusa heads.</p><p>Training Medusa heads requires additional development time and computational resources, which should be factored into project planning and resource allocation. Another important limitation to mention is that the current framework, when deployed on an Amazon SageMaker AI endpoint, only supports a batch size of one‚Äîa configuration typically used for low-latency applications.</p><p>The following diagram from the original Medusa paper authors‚Äô <a href=\"https://github.com/FasterDecoding/Medusa\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">FasterDecoding repository</a> gives a visual Medusa framework overview.</p><p>There are two main variants of Medusa:</p><ol><li> ‚Äì Requires a two-stage approach where you first fine-tune your LLM and then add Medusa heads and train them on top of your frozen fine-tuned LLM</li><li> ‚Äì Introduced later as an improvement, fine-tunes both the additional heads and the backbone LLM parameters together, enabling potentially even further latency speedups</li></ol><p>The Medusa paper reports that across models of varying sizes, you can achieve inference speedups of around two times for Medusa-1 and around three times for Medusa-2. With Medusa-1, the predictions are identical to those of the originally fine-tuned LLM. In contrast, with Medusa-2, we might observe slightly different results compared to simple fine-tuning of the LLM because both the heads and the backbone LLM parameters are updated together. In this post, we focus on Medusa-1.</p><p>We cover the following steps in our solution:</p><ul><li>Load and prepare the dataset</li><li>Fine-tune an LLM using a SageMaker AI training job</li><li>Train Medusa heads on top of a frozen fine-tuned LLM using a SageMaker AI training job</li><li>Deploy the fine-tuned LLM with Medusa heads on a SageMaker AI endpoint</li><li>Demonstrate LLM inference speedup</li></ul><p>By following this solution, you can accelerate LLM inference in your applications, leading to faster response times and improved user experience.</p><p>To build the solution yourself, there are the following prerequisites:</p><h3>Load and prepare the dataset</h3><p>Now that you have cloned the <a href=\"https://github.com/aws-samples/speedup-llm-inference-with-medusa-framework-on-amazon-sagemaker\">GitHub repository</a> and opened the  notebook, you will load and prepare the dataset in the notebook.

We selected hyperparameters based on a combination of what the Medusa paper reported and what we found to be best performing after a few experiments. We set the number of Medusa heads to 5 and used the 8-bit AdamW optimizer, as recommended by the paper. For simplicity, we maintained a constant learning rate of 1e-4 with a constant scheduler, similar to the previous fine-tuning step. Although the paper recommends an increased learning rate and a cosine scheduler, we found that our chosen combination of hyperparameters performed well on this dataset.

The model responses for the test set of 450 observations are the same for both with Medusa heads and without Medusa heads:</p><div><pre><code>match_percentage = sum(a[\"content\"] == b[\"content\"] for a, b in zip(sft_predictions, medusa_predictions)) / len(sft_predictions) * 100\nprint(f\"Predictions with the fine-tuned model with medusa heads are the same as without medusa heads: {match_percentage:.2f}% of test set \")\n\nPredictions with fine-tuned model with medusa heads are the same as without medusa heads: 100.00% of test set </code></pre></div><p>You might notice in your run that a few observations aren‚Äôt exactly matching, and you might get a 99% match due to small errors in floating point operations caused by optimizations on GPUs.</p><p>At the end of this experiment, don‚Äôt forget to delete the SageMaker AI endpoints you created:</p><div><pre><code>base_deployed_llm.delete_model()\nbase_deployed_llm.delete_endpoint()\nsft_deployed_llm.delete_model()\nsft_deployed_llm.delete_endpoint()\nmedusa_deployed_llm.delete_model()\nmedusa_deployed_llm.delete_endpoint()</code></pre></div><p>In this post, we demonstrated how to fine-tune and deploy an LLM with Medusa heads using the Medusa-1 technique on Amazon SageMaker AI to accelerate LLM inference. By using this framework and SageMaker AI scalable infrastructure, we showed how to achieve up to twofold speedups in LLM inference while maintaining model quality. This solution is particularly beneficial for applications requiring low-latency text generation, such as customer service chat assistants, content creation, and recommendation systems.</p><p>As a next step, you can explore fine-tuning your own LLM with Medusa heads on your own dataset and benchmark the results for your specific use case, using the provided <a href=\"https://github.com/aws-samples/speedup-llm-inference-with-medusa-framework-on-amazon-sagemaker\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">GitHub repository</a>.</p><p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/f1f836cb4ea6efb2a0b1b99f41ad8b103eff4b59/2025/02/05/ml_17442_dzagyva.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"100\" height=\"133\"> is a Senior ML Engineer at AWS Professional Services.

This automated process uses the power of LLMs to evaluate responses across multiple metric categories, offering insights that can significantly improve your AI applications. Let‚Äôs walk through the key components of this solution as shown in the following diagram:</p><p>LLM-as-a-judge on Amazon Bedrock Model Evaluation follows a streamlined workflow that enables systematic model evaluation. Here‚Äôs how each component works together in the evaluation process:</p><ul><li>: The process begins with a prepared dataset containing prompts that will be used to test the model‚Äôs performance. The evaluation can be conducted with or without ground truth responses‚Äîwhile including ground truth provides additional comparison points, it‚Äôs entirely optional and not required for successful evaluation.</li><li>: The prompt dataset is converted into JSONL format, which is specifically structured for LLM-as-a-judge evaluation jobs. This format promotes proper processing of evaluation data.</li><li>: The prepared JSONL file is uploaded to an S3 bucket, serving as the secure storage location for the evaluation data.</li><li>: The Amazon Bedrock LLM-as-a-judge model evaluation job processes the stored data, running comprehensive assessments across the selected metric categories (including quality, user experience, instruction following, and safety).</li><li><strong>Automated report generation</strong>: Upon completion, the system generates detailed evaluation reports containing metrics, scores, and insights at both aggregate and individual response levels.</li><li>: Data scientists or machine learning engineers analyze the generated reports to derive actionable insights and make informed decisions.</li></ul><p>With this solution architecture in mind, let‚Äôs explore how to implement LLM-as-a-judge model evaluations effectively, making sure that you get the most valuable insights from your assessment process.</p><p>To use the LLM-as-a-judge model evaluation, make sure that you have satisfied the following requirements:</p><ul><li>Selected  and  models enabled in Amazon Bedrock. You can confirm that the models are enabled for your account on the  page of the Amazon Bedrock console.</li><li>If you‚Äôre using a custom model instead of an on-demand model for your generator model, make sure that you have sufficient quota for running a <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/prov-throughput.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Provisioned Throughput</a> during inference. \n  <ul><li>Go to the AWS Service Quotas console, and check the following quotas: \n    <ul><li>Model units no-commitment Provisioned Throughputs across custom models.</li><li>Model units per provisioned model for [your custom model name].</li><li>Both of these fields need to have enough quota to support your Provisioned Throughput model unit.

However, the journey from a proof of concept to a production-ready application comes with challenges and opportunities. Moving from proof of concept to production is about creating scalable, reliable, and impactful solutions that can drive business value and user satisfaction.</p><p>One of the most promising developments in this space is the rise of <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/retrieval-augmented-generation/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)</a> applications. RAG is the process of optimizing the output of a foundation model (FM), so it references a knowledge base outside of its training data sources before generating a response.</p><p>The following diagram illustrates a sample architecture.</p><p>In this post, we explore the movement of RAG applications from their proof of concept or minimal viable product (MVP) phase to full-fledged production systems. When transitioning a RAG application from a proof of concept to a production-ready system, optimization becomes crucial to make sure the solution is reliable, cost-effective, and high-performing. Let‚Äôs explore these optimization techniques in greater depth, setting the stage for future discussions on hosting, scaling, security, and observability considerations.</p><p>The diagram below illustrates the tradeoffs to consider for a production-ready RAG application.</p><p>The success of a production-ready RAG system is measured by its quality, cost, and latency. Machine learning (ML) engineers must make trade-offs and prioritize the most important factors for their specific use case and business requirements. For example, consider the use case of generating personalized marketing content for a luxury fashion brand. The brand might be willing to absorb the higher costs of using a more powerful and expensive FMs to achieve the highest-quality classifications, because misclassifications could lead to customer dissatisfaction and damage the brand‚Äôs reputation. Consider another use case of generating personalized product descriptions for an ecommerce site. The retailer might be willing to accept slightly longer latency to reduce infrastructure and operational costs, as long as the generated descriptions remain reasonably accurate and compelling. The optimal balance of quality, cost, and latency can vary significantly across different applications and industries.</p><p>Let‚Äôs look into practical guidelines on how you can enhance the overall quality of your RAG workflow, including the quality of the retriever and quality of the result generator using <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/knowledge-bases/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases</a> and other features of <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Amazon Bedrock</a>. Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases provides a fully managed capability that helps you implement the entire RAG workflow from ingestion to retrieval and prompt augmentation without having to build custom integrations to data sources and manage data flows.</p><p>An effective evaluation framework is crucial for assessing and optimizing RAG systems as they move from proof of concept to production. These frameworks typically include overall metrics for a holistic assessment of the entire RAG pipeline, as well as specific diagnostic metrics for both the retrieval and generation components. This allows for targeted improvements in each phase of the system. By implementing a robust evaluation framework, developers can continuously monitor, diagnose, and enhance their RAG systems, achieving optimal performance across quality, cost, and latency dimensions as the application scales to production levels. <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/evaluations/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Amazon Bedrock Evaluations</a> can help you evaluate your retrieval or end-to-end RAG workflow in Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases. In the following sections, we discuss these specific metrics in different phases of the RAG workflow in more detail.</p><p>For better retrieval performance, the way the data is stored in the <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/dive-deep-into-vector-data-stores-using-amazon-bedrock-knowledge-bases/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">vector store</a> has a big impact. For example, your input document might include tables within the PDF. In such cases, using an FM to parse the data will provide better results. You can use <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/kb-chunking-parsing.html#kb-advanced-parsing\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">advanced parsing options</a> supported by Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases for parsing non-textual information from documents using FMs. Many organizations store their data in structured formats within data warehouses and data lakes. Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases offers a feature that lets you connect your RAG workflow to <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/knowledge-base-build-structured.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">structured data stores</a>. This fully managed out-of-the-box RAG solution can help you natively query structured data from where it resides.</p><p>Another important consideration is the way your source document is split up into chunks. If your document would benefit from inherent relationships within your document, it might be wise to use <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/kb-chunking-parsing.html#kb-hiearchical-chunking\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">hierarchical chunking</a>, which allows for more granular and efficient retrieval. Some documents benefit from <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/kb-chunking-parsing.html#kb-semantic-chunking\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">semantic chunking</a> by preserving the contextual relationship in the chunks, helping make sure that the related information stays together in logical chunks. You can also use your own custom <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/kb-chunking-parsing.html#kb-custom-transformation\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">chunking strategy</a> for your RAG application‚Äôs unique requirements.</p><p>RAG applications process user queries by searching across a large set of documents. However, in many situations, you might need to retrieve documents with specific attributes or content. You can use <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/amazon-bedrock-knowledge-bases-now-supports-metadata-filtering-to-improve-retrieval-accuracy/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">metadata filtering</a> to narrow down search results by specifying inclusion and exclusion criteria. Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases now also supports <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2024/12/amazon-bedrock-knowledge-bases-auto-generated-query-filters-improved-retrieval/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">auto generated query filters</a>, which extend the existing capability of manual metadata filtering by allowing you to narrow down search results without the need to manually construct complex filter expressions. This improves retrieval accuracy by making sure the documents are relevant to the query.</p><p>Writing an effective query is just as important as any other consideration for generation accuracy. You can add a <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/prompt-templates-and-examples.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">prompt</a> providing instructions to the FM to provide an appropriate answer to the user. For example, a legal tech company would want to provide instructions to restrict the answers to be based on the input documents and not based on general information known to the FM. <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/kb-test-config.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Query decomposition</a> by splitting the input query into multiple queries is also helpful in retrieval accuracy. In this process, the subqueries with less semantic complexity might find more targeted chunks. These chunks can then be pooled and ranked together before passing them to the FM to generate a response.</p><p><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2024/12/amazon-bedrock-rerank-api-accuracy-rag-applications/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Reranking</a>, as a post-retrieval step, can significantly improve response quality. This technique uses LLMs to analyze the semantic relevance between the query and retrieved documents, reordering them based on their pertinence. By incorporating reranking, you make sure that only the most contextually relevant information is used for generation, leading to more accurate and coherent responses.</p><p>Adjusting <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/inference-parameters.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">inference parameters</a>, such as temperature and top-k/p sampling, can help in further refining the output.</p><p>You can use Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases to <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/kb-test-config.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">configure and customize</a> queries and response generation. You can also improve the relevance of your query responses with a <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/rerank.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">reranker model</a> in Amazon Bedrock.</p><p>The key metrics for retriever quality are <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/evaluate-the-reliability-of-retrieval-augmented-generation-applications-using-amazon-bedrock/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">context precision</a>, <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/evaluate-the-reliability-of-retrieval-augmented-generation-applications-using-amazon-bedrock/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">context recall</a>, and <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/evaluate-the-reliability-of-retrieval-augmented-generation-applications-using-amazon-bedrock/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">context relevance</a>. Context precision measures how well the system ranks relevant pieces of information from the given context. It considers the question, ground truth, and context. Context recall provides the percentage of ground truth claims or key information covered by the retrieved context. Context relevance measures whether the retrieved passages or chunks are relevant for answering the given query, excluding extraneous details. Together, these three metrics offer insight into how effectively the retriever is able to surface the most relevant and focused source material to support a high-quality response.</p><p>Generator quality can be assessed through several key metrics. <a href=\"https://github.com/amazon-science/RAGChecker/blob/main/tutorial/ragchecker_tutorial_en.md#generator-metrics\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Context utilization</a> examines how effectively the generator uses relevant information from the provided source material. <a href=\"https://github.com/amazon-science/RAGChecker/blob/main/tutorial/ragchecker_tutorial_en.md#generator-metrics\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Noise sensitivity</a> gauges the generator‚Äôs propensity to include inaccurate details from the retrieved content. <a href=\"https://github.com/amazon-science/RAGChecker/blob/main/tutorial/ragchecker_tutorial_en.md#generator-metrics\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Hallucination</a> measures the extent to which the generator produces incorrect claims not present in the source data. <a href=\"https://github.com/amazon-science/RAGChecker/blob/main/tutorial/ragchecker_tutorial_en.md#generator-metrics\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Self-knowledge</a> reflects the proportion of accurate statements generated that can‚Äôt be found in the retrieved chunks. Finally, <a href=\"https://github.com/amazon-science/RAGChecker/blob/main/tutorial/ragchecker_tutorial_en.md#generator-metrics\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">faithfulness</a> evaluates how closely the generator‚Äôs output aligns with the information contained in the source material.</p><p>For measuring the overall generation quality, the key metrics include measuring the <a href=\"https://github.com/amazon-science/RAGChecker/blob/main/tutorial/ragchecker_tutorial_en.md#overall-metrics\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">precision</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/amazon-science/RAGChecker/blob/main/tutorial/ragchecker_tutorial_en.md#overall-metrics\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">recall</a>, and <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/evaluate-the-reliability-of-retrieval-augmented-generation-applications-using-amazon-bedrock/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">answer similarity</a>. Precision suggests the proportion of the correct claims in model‚Äôs response, whereas recall suggests the proportion of the ground truth claims covered by the model‚Äôs response. Answer similarity compares the meaning and content of a generated answer with a reference or ground truth answer. It evaluates how closely the generated answer matches the intended meaning of the ground truth answer.</p><p>Establishing a feedback loop with an evaluation framework against these quality metrics allows for continuous improvement, where the system can learn from user interactions and refine its performance over time. By optimizing these quality metrics, the RAG system can be designed to deliver reliable, cost-effective, and high-performing results for users.</p><p>Implementing responsible AI practices is crucial for maintaining ethical and safe deployment of RAG systems. This includes using guardrails to filter harmful content, deny certain topics, mask sensitive information, and ground responses in verified sources to reduce hallucinations.</p><p>Cost considers the compute resources and infrastructure required to run the system, and latency evaluates the response times experienced by end-users. To optimize cost and latency, implement <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/database/improve-speed-and-reduce-cost-for-generative-ai-workloads-with-a-persistent-semantic-cache-in-amazon-memorydb/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">caching strategies</a> to reduce the need for expensive model inferences. Efficient <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/batch-inference.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">query batching</a>&nbsp;can also improve overall throughput and reduce resource usage. Balance performance and resource usage to find the ideal configuration that meets your application‚Äôs requirements.</p><p>Use tools like Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases so you can take advantage of fully managed support for the end-to-end RAG workflow. It supports many of the <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2024/07/knowledge-bases-amazon-bedrock-advanced-rag-capabilities/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">advanced RAG capabilities</a> we discussed earlier. By addressing these optimization techniques, you can transition your RAG-powered proof of concept to a robust, production-ready system that delivers high-quality, cost-effective, and low-latency responses to your users.</p><p>In addition to the server or compute layer, you will also need to consider an orchestration tool, testing environments, and a continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD) pipeline to streamline your application deployment. Having a feedback loop established based on the quality metrics along with a CI/CD pipeline is an important first step to creating self-healing architectures.</p><p>As your application grows, you will need to make sure your infrastructure can scale to meet the increasing demand. This can involve containerization with Docker or choosing serverless options, implementing load balancing, setting up auto scaling, and choosing between on-premises, cloud, or hybrid solutions. It also includes unique scaling requirements of your frontend application and backend generative AI workflow, as well as the use of content delivery networks (CDNs) and disaster recovery and backup strategies.</p><p>The following is a sample architecture for a secure and scalable RAG-based web application. This architecture uses Amazon ECS for hosting the service, <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Amazon CloudFront</a> as a CDN, <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/waf/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">AWS WAF</a> as a firewall, and <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/memorydb/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Amazon MemoryDB</a> for providing a semantic cache.</p><p>By carefully considering these aspects of hosting and scaling your infrastructure, you can build a resilient and adaptable system to support your growing web application or service. Stay tuned for more detailed information on these topics in upcoming blog posts.</p><h2>Data privacy, security, and observability</h2><p>Maintaining data privacy and security is of utmost importance. This includes implementing security measures at each layer of your application, from encrypting data in transit to setting up robust authentication and authorization controls. It also involves focusing on compute and storage security, as well as network security. Compliance with relevant regulations and regular security audits are essential. Securing your generative AI system is another crucial aspect. By default, Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases encrypts the traffic using AWS managed <a href=\"http://aws.amazon.com/kms\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">AWS Key Management Service</a> (AWS KMS) keys. You can also choose customer managed KMS keys for more control over encryption keys.
