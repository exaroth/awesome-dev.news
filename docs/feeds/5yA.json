Instead of directly competing feature-for-feature, let's explore how Quarkus's core design principles position it as a powerful and innovative platform for building the next generation of AI-powered enterprise applications.</p><p><strong>Beyond Maturity: Agility and Cloud-Native DNA</strong></p><p>Spring Boot's maturity and official Spring AI project are undoubtedly valuable, especially for enterprises seeking established and comprehensively supported solutions. However, in the rapidly evolving world of AI, <strong>agility and responsiveness to change are essential.</strong>  This is where Quarkus shines.</p><p>Quarkus, built for the cloud-native era, prioritizes <strong>lightweightness, blazing-fast startup times, and efficient resource utilization.</strong> These characteristics, often considered secondary in traditional enterprise Java development, become  when building AI applications in modern cloud environments.</p><p><strong>Why Lightweightness and Speed Matter for AI</strong></p><p>Consider the emerging patterns in AI deployment:</p><ul><li>  AI functionalities are increasingly deployed as serverless functions, triggered by events and scaled on demand. Quarkus's millisecond startup times become critical here, minimizing cold start latency and maximizing responsiveness for AI-driven serverless workloads. Spring Boot's comparatively slower startup can introduce noticeable delays in such scenarios.</li><li><strong>Real-time AI Streaming Applications:</strong>  Many AI use cases involve processing streaming data in real-time – think sentiment analysis of live social media feeds, or real-time fraud detection. Quarkus's reactive architecture and efficient resource usage are ideally suited for building these high-throughput, low-latency AI streaming applications. Spring Boot, while reactive capable, carries a heavier footprint, potentially impacting real-time performance and resource consumption at scale.</li><li><strong>Resource-Constrained AI Edge Deployments:</strong>  As AI moves closer to the edge, applications need to run in resource-constrained environments – IoT devices, edge gateways, etc. Quarkus's minimal footprint and low memory consumption become crucial for deploying AI models efficiently in these scenarios. Spring Boot's resource requirements might be less optimal for edge AI deployments.</li></ul><p><strong>Quarkus's Community-Driven Innovation: A Strength with AI's Fast Development Cycles</strong></p><p>While Spring AI benefits from the backing of the Spring ecosystem, Quarkus's community-driven approach fosters a different kind of strength – <strong>rapid innovation and adaptability.</strong> The LangChain4j Quarkus extension is a prime example. Born from the community, it quickly integrates a leading LLM framework into Quarkus, demonstrating the framework's agility and responsiveness to emerging AI trends.</p><p>This community-driven innovation can be a significant advantage in the fast-moving AI landscape.  Quarkus is positioned to quickly adopt and integrate new AI technologies and libraries as they emerge, potentially offering a more cutting-edge and adaptable platform for AI development compared to more centrally controlled frameworks.</p><p><strong>LangChain4j on Quarkus: A Powerful Combination</strong></p><p>The LangChain4j Quarkus extension is not just a community project; it's a powerful integration that highlights Quarkus's potential for AI. LangChain4j brings to Quarkus:</p><ul><li><strong>A Versatile LLM Abstraction:</strong>  Support for a wide array of LLMs, ensuring flexibility and provider choice.</li><li><strong>Advanced Prompt Engineering Tools:</strong>  Essential for maximizing the effectiveness of LLMs.</li><li>  Enabling the creation of sophisticated, multi-step AI workflows directly within Quarkus applications.</li></ul><p>By embracing LangChain4j, Quarkus developers have access to a robust set of AI tools within a framework optimized for cloud-native performance. This combination is particularly appealing for developers who want to build cutting-edge AI applications without sacrificing performance or resource efficiency.</p><p><strong>Reframing the Enterprise Choice For AI</strong></p><p>Instead of viewing particular frameworks as \"less mature\" in AI integration, we need to start evaluating the ability to be <strong>\"agile enough to adapt to change\"</strong>. While maturity in core cloud-native design, performance optimization, and community-driven innovation, cintinue to stay increasingly critical aspects for modern AI applications.</p><p>For enterprise Java developers considering AI integration, the choice becomes less about \"which framework is more mature \" and more about <strong>\"which framework is more mature <em>for my specific AI use case and deployment environment</em>.\"</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Performance and resource efficiency are key</strong>, especially for serverless, streaming, or edge AI deployments.</li><li><strong>Agility and access to cutting-edge AI innovations</strong> are valued.</li><li><strong>Community-driven innovation and a rapidly evolving ecosystem</strong> are seen as strengths.</li><li><strong>Building lean, cloud-native AI microservices or functions</strong> is the primary goal.</li></ul><p><strong>Spring Boot remains a strong choice when:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Officially supported AI integration</strong> is a top priority.</li><li><strong>Vendor abstraction and long-term stability</strong> are more important than ability to adopt to latest features.</li><li><strong>Leveraging the full breadth of the established Spring ecosystem</strong> is unavoidable.</li><li><strong>Performance is less critical</strong>.</li></ul><p>\nQuarkus is not simply \"catching up\" to Spring Boot in AI integration; it's carving its own path, leveraging its cloud-native foundation and community agility to offer a compelling platform for building modern, high-performance AI applications.

Headquartered in the nation of China, DeepSeek was established in the month of May by Liang Wenfeng, who is well known to be a prominent figure in both the world of artificial intelligence and the hedge fund industry. DeepSeek has rapidly become well known throughout the industry for its innovative and unique approach to creating AI technologies, and the firm is backed by the prominent Chinese hedge fund High-Flyer. DeepSeek has strategically positioned its efforts on conducting cutting-edge research rather than commercialization, a move that has enabled it to navigate more freely through China's stringent and complex AI regulations.</p><ul><li><strong>Accelerated Progress in the Field of Development and Important Artificial Intelligence Models</strong></li></ul><p>The path of DeepSeek AI has indeed been nothing but impressive and remarkable. From the very beginning of its existence, the company has been able to make remarkable strides and achievements in the field of AI model development, with a special focus on its revolutionary models, DeepSeek-V2 and the even more sophisticated DeepSeek-V3. These revolutionary models have always shown outstanding and impressive abilities in the domain of natural language processing (NLP), which has in turn made DeepSeek a serious and strong contender to established AI giants like OpenAI and Google.</p><ul><li><strong>Technological progress and how it has influenced obtaining a competitive edge.</strong></li></ul><p>One of the most remarkable achievements that DeepSeek has made in the realm of artificial intelligence is its highly cost-effective way of training AI models. In direct contrast to traditional AI companies, which typically depend heavily on high-end, expensive graphical processing units, such as those manufactured by Nvidia, DeepSeek has taken a different approach. It has meticulously tuned its AI models to achieve a level of high efficiency while using significantly less computational power. This groundbreaking breakthrough is double-edged: not only does it drastically lower the cost of operations, it also plays a pivotal role in making artificial intelligence significantly more affordable to a much wider variety of businesses and companies, particularly those with tight budgets.</p><p>In comparison to OpenAI's GPT-4, DeepSeek's models are as good, if not better, in some NLP tasks, particularly in processing and generating complex text. That efficiency gives DeepSeek a massive edge, especially in markets where low-cost AI solutions are in high demand.</p><p>The rise of DeepSeek has caused huge waves across the landscape of the AI world, marking a revolutionary time. This cutting-edge startup has proven to have an incredible ability to produce high-performance models without incurring the huge computational costs that are usually associated with big firms like OpenAI and Nvidia. This incredible capability is a huge challenge to the traditional model of the AI world. By successfully reducing the barriers that have so far stifled AI development, DeepSeek is not only transforming the dynamics of the industry but also forcing its rivals to take a close examination of and reassess their current strategies and methodologies.</p><p>This transformation is not without its financial ramifications, and those ramifications are notable and noteworthy in their own right. As DeepSeek grows increasingly in reputation and standing in the industry, investors and market strategists alike have taken keen interest and stock in this momentous development. Nvidia, a company that is a giant in the realm of AI hardware, has had its stock prices go up and down as a direct result of the new competition being brought to bear by cost-effective AI companies such as DeepSeek. In the meantime, a host of the industry's leading players, including giants Google, Meta, and Airbnb, are purported to be taking the time to reassess and re-strategize their AI efforts in direct response to the incredible advances that DeepSeek has made over the past several years.</p><ul><li><strong>The Growing Uses of DeepSeek</strong></li></ul><p>One of the most significant contributors to the sheer success of DeepSeek is undoubtedly the company's innovative free AI assistant, which has witnessed an overwhelming rise in popularity because of its simplicity of use as well as performance. In comparison with other companies within the business that charge additional fees for premium AI services, DeepSeek has made a conscious effort to offer its premium AI tools for free to its users, which has further and even better enhanced and solidified its presence and influence in the market.</p><p>Apart from chatbots, DeepSeek's innovative AI technology is being applied across a broad spectrum of real-world industries, not just business solutions but also the life-critical domains of healthcare and education. Companies are increasingly using its sophisticated natural language processing capabilities to automate its customer service functions to improve efficiency and customer satisfaction. In the healthcare sector, meanwhile, there is continued investigation of the uses of DeepSeek's AI for a broad spectrum of applications, including medical diagnosis and research support, which could make a significant contribution to healthcare professionals. In addition, DeepSeek's AI technology has been extensively tested in the context of China's notoriously difficult college entrance exam, the Gaokao, demonstrating its outstanding capability to process complex reasoning and complex problem-solving tasks that are critical in academic tests.</p><ul><li><strong>Security and Privacy Issues</strong></li></ul><p>While the incredible and rapid success of DeepSeek in the tech industry has not been without controversy and criticism, it has nonetheless drawn fire for its data privacy. There have been several concerns raised about the possible threat of foreign surveillance that can compromise user data. Due to these critical concerns, governments have taken action; most notably, the state of New York has enacted a ban on the utilization of DeepSeek's AI assistant on government computers. This was done as a response to legitimate security issues that can be raised by the software's use in sensitive government applications.\nThe issues that have been raised are mostly based on the data storage methods that DeepSeek uses in the interest of managing information. With the regulatory climate that exists in China, which is characterized by its strict and stringent data control laws, there have been widespread questions raised about the likelihood that DeepSeek might be forced to give government agencies user data in the future. Although the firm has strongly refuted any accusations of data misuse in any manner, the apparent lack of transparency in its privacy policies has been largely the cause of skepticism and mistrust among its critics.</p><ul><li><strong>Ethical and Legal Considerations</strong></li></ul><p>The fast-paced growth of DeepSeek has, without a doubt, stirred serious controversies and ethical issues in many quarters. Some of the critics argue that the artificial intelligence algorithms being created under the political atmosphere fostered by China could be susceptible to censorship or biased training data processes. These urgent issues help to bring to the forefront the wider and more complicated moral question surrounding the creation of artificial intelligence in different political and cultural contexts, including issues of integrity and justice in technology.</p><p>Adding to the trouble, DeepSeek has also come under fire from Microsoft and OpenAI on allegations of abusing OpenAI's API. The abuse, as alleged, involves integrating some of the features and aspects of GPT models into DeepSeek's systems and operations. If the allegations are true, such actions would have serious and severe legal implications for the company, which could impact its operations and future activities. In another but related case, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton has initiated an investigation into DeepSeek's privacy practices. He is not impressed by the startup's claims, which state that its AI model competes with and outperforms some of the world's top systems today.</p><p><strong>The Future of DeepSeek AI</strong></p><p>As DeepSeek continues to make its impressive ascent in the sector, the firm finds itself in an environment that is equally rich in remarkable opportunity as it is fraught with stern problems. Though the value-driven AI models that the firm has developed, as well as its unwavering commitment to ongoing research and development, provide it with a robust and stable platform in this competitive sector, the increasing legal scrutiny that its operations currently face and the increasingly prominent security concerns that have arisen can potentially prove to be severe obstacles to its aggressive expansion plans, particularly in the lucrative Western markets where these kinds of concerns are taken very seriously.</p><p>Ultimately, the success of DeepSeek as a company will be determined by how it is able to respond and cope with these numerous challenges that it is confronting in its marketplace. If it can effectively answer the immediate concerns regarding data privacy and remain open about its operation, and still keep innovating and leading the pace in its industry, then it has a good chance of being a world leader in the artificial intelligence sphere. Until then, though, its influence on the industry is irreversibly deep—shaking the existing order of today's AI industry and actively challenging the traditional grip of established technology leaders who have long controlled this sector for decades.\nIn summary,</p><p>DeepSeek AI represents both vast potential and equally daunting challenge in the constantly changing global landscape of AI. In its innovative, cost-effective strategy of artificial intelligence, DeepSeek has already established the process of disrupting incumbent AI rivals in the marketplace as well as establishing new industry benchmarks that have the potential to redefine the ways in which AI is leveraged. But in the future, there is still some doubt as to where DeepSeek is going, much of which depends on continuing legal matters, urgent concerns of privacy, and the multifaceted nature of geopolitical rivalries that would impact its functioning. As AI continues to innovate and transform so aggressively, what DeepSeek does will be wholly determinative in dictating future paths of AI research, competition among actors, and access to end-users globally. Ultimately, whether or not DeepSeek can maintain such phenomenal momentum and effectively overcome such challenges will go a long way toward guaranteeing long-term success for the company in the global marketplace.</p>","contentLength":10802,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"[Boost]","url":"https://dev.to/muash10/-27cl","date":1740306465,"author":"Muhammed Ashraf","guid":9550,"unread":true,"content":"","contentLength":0,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Best 2025 Cyber Forensics Investigation Course in India","url":"https://dev.to/ankit_cyber/best-2025-cyber-forensics-investigation-course-in-india-179d","date":1740303357,"author":"ankit_Cyber","guid":9529,"unread":true,"content":"<p>In today’s technology-dependent environment, the rise of cybersecurity cannot be overlooked.

But how do these models work, and what are the different types of LLMs out there? In this blog, we’ll explore the fundamentals of LLMs, their architectures, training approaches, and how they differ in use cases and performance.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  What Are Large Language Models?\n</h3><p>At their core, LLMs are advanced machine learning models trained on massive amounts of text data. Using this training, they can understand and generate human-like text, answer questions, write essays, generate code, and even engage in conversation. LLMs like GPT-4, LLaMA, and PaLM have pushed the boundaries of what AI can do with language.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Key Types of LLM Architectures\n</h3><p>Let’s take a closer look at the main architectures LLMs use:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Decoder-only Models (Autoregressive)</strong>: These models predict the next word in a sentence based on the words before it. They’re great for text generation and conversational AI.</p><ul><li>: GPT-3, GPT-4, LLaMA</li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Encoder-only Models (Masked Language Models)</strong>: These models fill in missing words within a sentence, which makes them better suited for understanding language and text classification.</p></li><li><p><strong>Encoder-Decoder Models (Seq2Seq)</strong>: These models convert one sequence of text into another, making them excellent for tasks like translation and summarization.</p></li></ul><h3>\n  \n  \n  Different Training Approaches for LLMs\n</h3><p>LLMs can be trained using various techniques:</p><ul><li>: Trained on unlabeled text data by predicting missing or next words.</li><li><strong>Supervised Fine-tuning (SFT)</strong>: Adjusted on labeled datasets for specific tasks like classification or sentiment analysis.</li><li><strong>Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF)</strong>: Fine-tuned based on human preferences to improve helpfulness and reduce harmful outputs. (Used by ChatGPT)</li></ul><h3>\n  \n  \n  How LLMs Use Machine Learning to Train Their Models\n</h3><p>Training LLMs involves several advanced machine learning techniques and massive datasets. Here’s a breakdown of how different models are trained:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Data Collection and Preprocessing</strong>: LLMs are trained on diverse and extensive datasets, including books, websites, code repositories, and other text sources. The data is cleaned and tokenized into smaller units that the model can process.</p></li><li><p>: Most LLMs use transformer models, which are based on self-attention mechanisms. This allows the model to weigh the importance of different words in a sentence and capture complex language patterns.</p></li><li><p>: Training LLMs requires enormous computational power, often using clusters of Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) or Tensor Processing Units (TPUs) for parallel processing.</p></li><li><p>: Models like GPT and BERT are pretrained on vast amounts of unlabeled data, learning grammar, facts, and context through methods like next-word prediction (autoregressive) or masked word filling.</p></li><li><p><strong>Fine-tuning on Labeled Data</strong>: After pretraining, LLMs are often fine-tuned on smaller, labeled datasets to specialize in particular tasks like sentiment analysis, question answering, or code generation.</p></li><li><p><strong>Human Feedback and Reinforcement Learning</strong>: Techniques like RLHF are used to align models more closely with human preferences, making outputs safer, more helpful, and more aligned with real-world needs.</p></li><li><p><strong>Continual Learning and Adaptation</strong>: Some models continue to learn from interactions and updated datasets to improve performance and keep knowledge up to date.</p></li></ul><h3>\n  \n  \n  How LLMs Differ by Use Case\n</h3><p>Different LLMs excel at different tasks and use different models for their unique capabilities:</p><ul><li><p>: These models, like ChatGPT and Claude, typically use decoder-only architectures like GPT. They generate text by predicting the next word in a sentence, enabling fluid, context-aware conversations. Through RLHF, they align responses to human-like preferences, making them more helpful and safe.</p></li><li><p>: Codex, StarCoder, and Cursor use models trained on large datasets of code and natural language. They often rely on decoder-only architectures optimized for code completion, syntax understanding, and generation. These models can interpret comments and generate functional code snippets or even entire programs.</p></li><li><p>: GPT-4V and Gemini extend the capabilities of LLMs to handle multiple types of input like text, images, and audio. They use specialized transformer architectures that align and interpret information from different modalities, enabling them to describe images, generate captions, and understand complex visual-text relationships.</p></li><li><p>: Models like Med-PaLM and BloombergGPT are fine-tuned on domain-specific data, like medical literature or financial texts. They usually start with general architectures like BERT or GPT and undergo additional training on specialized datasets to enhance their performance in expert-level tasks.</p></li></ul><h3>\n  \n  \n  Real-world Applications of LLMs\n</h3><p>LLMs have already made their mark across a wide range of industries and tools:</p><ul><li>: Tools like ChatGPT and Intercom’s AI assist customer service teams by answering common questions and providing instant responses.</li><li>: Jasper AI and Copy.ai use LLMs to help marketers generate blog posts, social media content, and product descriptions quickly and efficiently.</li><li>: GitHub Copilot and Cursor offer real-time coding suggestions, automating repetitive tasks and helping developers write cleaner, faster code.</li><li>: Med-PaLM assists with medical question answering and analysis, helping doctors and researchers stay updated with the latest knowledge.</li><li>: BloombergGPT provides financial insights and data analysis tailored for the finance industry.</li><li>: Khan Academy’s Khanmigo uses LLMs to offer personalized tutoring and help students learn at their own pace.</li></ul><h3>\n  \n  \n  Open-source vs. Proprietary LLMs\n</h3><ul><li>: Freely available and customizable.\n\n<ul><li>: LLaMA 2, Falcon</li></ul></li><li>: Commercially developed with advanced capabilities.\n\n</li></ul><p>Large Language Models are revolutionizing the way we interact with AI, enabling incredible capabilities across different fields. Understanding their types, architectures, and training approaches helps us appreciate the power behind the AI tools we use every day.</p>","contentLength":6057,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Innovative AI Integration in React Applications Revolutionizing User Interactions","url":"https://dev.to/sista-ai/innovative-ai-integration-in-react-applications-revolutionizing-user-interactions-4he2","date":1740294824,"author":"Sista AI","guid":9490,"unread":true,"content":"<p>Integrating AI features into React applications has never been easier, thanks to cutting-edge frameworks like CopilotKit.

To mitigate this risk, organizations are exploring quantum-resistant cryptographic algorithms to safeguard sensitive information against future threats.</p><h2><strong>4. Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS) Expansion</strong></h2><p>The ransomware landscape has evolved with the rise of Ransomware-as-a-Service models, where developers sell or lease ransomware tools to affiliates. This commoditization lowers the barrier to entry for cybercriminals, leading to an increase in ransomware incidents. Businesses must implement robust backup solutions, employee training, and advanced threat detection systems to combat this growing menace.</p><h2><strong>5. Insider Threats Escalation</strong></h2><p>Insider threats, whether from negligent employees or malicious insiders, are becoming more prevalent. The complexity of modern IT environments and increased remote work have expanded the avenues for internal breaches. Organizations need to establish comprehensive monitoring, strict access controls, and foster a culture of security awareness to detect and prevent insider incidents.</p><h2><strong>6. Cloud Security Enhancements</strong></h2><p>With the accelerated adoption of cloud services, securing cloud infrastructures has become paramount. Misconfigurations and inadequate access controls are common vulnerabilities. Employing Cloud Security Posture Management (CSPM) tools and adhering to shared responsibility models are essential steps in fortifying cloud environments against breaches.</p><h2><strong>7. AI-Driven Cyber Defense</strong></h2><p>As cyber threats grow in complexity, leveraging AI for defense has become a necessity. AI-powered tools can analyze vast amounts of data in real-time, identifying anomalies and potential threats more efficiently than traditional methods. Integrating AI into cybersecurity strategies enhances threat detection and response capabilities, enabling a proactive security posture.</p><h2><strong>8. Cybersecurity Talent Shortage</strong></h2><p>The demand for skilled cybersecurity professionals continues to outpace supply, leading to a significant talent gap. Organizations are exploring alternative solutions, such as upskilling existing staff, investing in automation, and partnering with managed security service providers to address this challenge.</p><p>Staying abreast of these trends is crucial for organizations aiming to strengthen their cybersecurity posture in 2025. Proactive measures, continuous education, and the adoption of advanced technologies are key components in defending against the ever-evolving threat landscape.</p>","contentLength":3754,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Introducing docusaurus-plugin-chat-page: An AI-Powered Chat Interface for Your Documentation","url":"https://dev.to/nichnarmada/introducing-docusaurus-plugin-chat-page-an-ai-powered-chat-interface-for-your-documentation-3ed4","date":1740268472,"author":"Nicholas Narmada","guid":9384,"unread":true,"content":"<p>Imagine if your documentation could answer your users’ questions in real time—providing context-aware responses, complete with source references—all without requiring maintainers to build and manage a separate backend. Today, I’m excited to introduce <a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/docusaurus-plugin-chat-page\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>docusaurus-plugin-chat-page</strong></a> – a plug-and-play Docusaurus plugin that adds an AI-powered chat interface directly to your documentation site. </p><h2>\n  \n  \n  What Is docusaurus-plugin-chat-page?\n</h2><p>Docusaurus has transformed how we build documentation sites with its modern, React‑based architecture, Markdown‑driven content, and a robust plugin ecosystem. However, one challenge remains: users often have to sift through extensive docs to find the information they need.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/docusaurus-plugin-chat-page\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>docusaurus-plugin-chat-page</strong></a> solves this problem by integrating an interactive chat interface into your documentation site. End-users can ask questions in natural language and receive context‑aware answers generated from your documentation content.</p><ul><li>\nUsers can ask questions and receive intelligent, context-driven answers.</li><li><strong>Semantic Search via Embeddings:</strong>\nThe plugin processes your Markdown files at build time—splitting content into chunks, computing embeddings (using OpenAI for now), and saving these as a JSON asset. At runtime, a cosine similarity search retrieves the most relevant content.</li><li>\nAnswers include metadata about the source (file paths, titles) so users know exactly where the information came from.</li><li><strong>Plug-and-Play Integration:</strong>\nWith minimal configuration (just supplying an API key), you can add a chat page to your documentation without managing a backend database.</li><li><strong>Future-Proof &amp; Model-Agnostic (Coming Soon):</strong>\nWhile the current release uses OpenAI for both embeddings and chat completions, future releases will allow you to choose from multiple providers by simply updating your configuration.</li></ul><p>During the Docusaurus build process, the plugin:</p><ul><li><strong>Scans Local Markdown Files:</strong>\nIt traverses your  and  directories to collect all your Markdown content—no need to scrape HTML.</li><li><strong>Processes and Chunks Content:</strong>\nUsing tools like <a href=\"https://github.com/jonschlinkert/gray-matter\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">gray-matter</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/remarkjs/remark\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">remark</a> (with <a href=\"https://github.com/remarkjs/strip-markdown\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">strip-markdown</a>), the plugin extracts frontmatter (such as titles and tags) and converts the Markdown into plain text. Then it splits this content into manageable chunks (with configurable maximum chunk size) while preserving metadata like file paths.</li><li>\nFor each chunk, the plugin calls OpenAI’s Embedding API (currently hardcoded) to compute a vector representation. These embeddings, along with their corresponding text and metadata, are bundled into a JSON file via Docusaurus’s  API.</li><li>\nThe resulting JSON file is then deployed as a static asset, making it available on the client without needing a live database.</li></ul><h3>\n  \n  \n  2. Client-Side Chat Processing\n</h3><p>At runtime, the chat page:</p><ul><li>\nThe precomputed embeddings JSON file is loaded into the client.</li><li>\nWhen a user submits a question, the plugin:\n\n<ul><li>Converts the query into an embedding using OpenAI’s API.</li><li>Performs a cosine similarity search against the stored embeddings to find the top relevant chunks.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Generates Contextual Answers:</strong>\nThe relevant chunks (with their source metadata) are combined with the user’s query to form a prompt. This prompt is sent to the Chat API (currently OpenAI) to generate an answer, which is streamed back in real time.</li><li><strong>Displays Source References:</strong>\nThe chat response includes source information (e.g., “Source: docs/intro.md”) to show where the answer originated.</li></ul><p>Right now, the plugin requires you to supply an OpenAI API key for both generating embeddings and for chat completions. Here’s an example of how to configure it in your :</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>To add the chat page to your site's navigation bar, update the themeConfig in your :</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><blockquote><p><p>\nIn upcoming releases, I plan to make the plugin model agnostic—allowing you to specify separate providers for embeddings and chat completions. For now, the plugin uses OpenAI exclusively.</p></p></blockquote><h2>\n  \n  \n  Overcoming Build-Time Memory Challenges\n</h2><p>One challenge we faced was out-of-memory (OOM) errors during the build process due to the large number of chunks and embeddings being processed. To address this, the plugin implements several optimizations:</p><ul><li>\nIncreasing the default chunk size and capping the maximum number of chunks per file reduces the total number of chunks.</li><li><strong>Batch Processing Improvements:</strong>\nReducing the batch size for embedding generation and adding delays between batches help lower peak memory usage.</li><li>\nFuture releases may include a caching mechanism so that embeddings are only recomputed for files that have changed.</li><li>\nProvider-specific code is loaded dynamically, ensuring that only necessary dependencies are loaded during build and runtime.</li></ul><h2>\n  \n  \n  Installation &amp; Deployment\n</h2><p>Installation is straightforward via npm or yarn:</p><div><pre><code>npm docusaurus-plugin-chat-page\n\nyarn add docusaurus-plugin-chat-page\n</code></pre></div><p>For more details, check out the plugin on <a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/docusaurus-plugin-chat-page\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">npm</a>.</p><p>After installing, update your  as shown above. When you run , the plugin processes your documentation at build time and saves the embeddings as a JSON asset. When deployed, users can access the chat page at the configured route (e.g., ) and start interacting with your documentation.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/docusaurus-plugin-chat-page\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>docusaurus-plugin-chat-page</strong></a> transforms your static documentation site into an interactive, AI-powered experience—making it easier for your users to find the information they need. While the current version uses OpenAI for both embeddings and chat completions, future releases will offer model agnosticism, allowing you to choose the best provider for your needs.</p><p>I’m excited to see how this plugin empowers documentation maintainers to deliver a richer and more interactive experience.

Code samples provided in the lessons are in JavaScript but <strong>you can use any programming language you are familiar with.</strong></p><p>There were also extra tasks, for fun, that did not count towards the certificate. All the tasks (both normal and extra ones) used the CTF (Capture The Flag) form.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  The most important concepts\n</h2><p>Look at the course name suffix: .</p><p>That means it teaches <strong>how to use programming tools to solve problems automatically</strong>. Usually an agent uses many lower-level tools, such as some LLM via API and a database (not necessarily dedicated for AI).</p><p>It is important to handle unhappy scenarios gracefully. <strong>Giving up and showing an error to the user is better than presenting an incorrect or off-topic answer.</strong></p><p>There are a lot of tutorials and trainings on using LLMs and prompt engineering. In contrast, there is much less information about . These include powerful tools for <strong>monitoring and debugging AI applications</strong>, including specialized databases for vector storage, and utilities for web crawling. I’ll describe a few of them used in the course.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  FireCrawl: Web content extraction\n</h2><p><a href=\"https://www.firecrawl.dev/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">FireCrawl</a> is a web scraper designed for AI applications.

Tools like <a href=\"https://www.browserbase.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">BrowserBase</a> provide a user-friendly interface for automating browser interactions, making it easier to gather information from the web.</p><p>Similarly, <a href=\"https://playwright.dev/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Playwright</a> offers powerful capabilities for browser automation, enabling developers to write scripts that can navigate web pages, fill out forms, and extract data.</p><p>The development of AI applications requires specific approaches and methodologies. They differ from traditional software development. Here are some key techniques that have proven effective when building AI-powered systems.</p><p>Function calling enables <strong>structured communication between the model and external tools or APIs</strong>. You provide a schema describing available functions and their parameters. An LLM can decide when to use specific tools and generate the appropriate arguments on its own.</p><p>This creates a standardized way for models to interact with external systems. For example, <strong>it can help searching databases, or controlling smart home devices.</strong></p><h2>\n  \n  \n  One prompt for one problem\n</h2><p>A key principle in AI development is to <strong>break down complex tasks into smaller prompts</strong>, rather than trying to achieve many objectives in a single go. <strong>Each prompt should be focused to address one specific problem or subtask.</strong></p><p>This approach improves reliability and makes it easier to debug issues.

Traditional banking, which has long been the backbone of the global financial system, is now facing stiff competition from the rise of quantitative finance. With quantitative finance leveraging high-level mathematics, data science, and algorithmic trading, many aspiring professionals are wondering: Is the future of finance all about math?</p><p>Understanding Traditional Banking</p><p>Traditional banking encompasses commercial banks, retail banking, and investment banking services, which primarily involve deposit-taking, lending, asset management, and financial advisory services. These banks rely on fundamental economic principles, market intuition, and regulatory frameworks to drive financial decisions. Relationships, client trust, and financial expertise have historically played a critical role in traditional banking.</p><p>However, with the evolving financial landscape, traditional banks are increasingly integrating technological advancements to improve efficiency, risk assessment, and customer service. While still heavily dependent on human decision-making, traditional banks are recognizing the need for data-driven strategies to remain competitive.</p><p>What is Quantitative Finance?</p><p>Quantitative finance, also known as \"quant finance,\" involves the use of complex mathematical models, statistical techniques, and algorithmic trading strategies to make investment decisions. Quants, or professionals in this field, develop mathematical models to analyze market trends, assess risk, and optimize financial strategies.</p><p>Key areas of quantitative finance include:</p><p>Algorithmic Trading: Automated trading strategies that execute orders at high speeds based on predefined mathematical models.</p><p>Risk Management: Advanced statistical models to assess market risks and mitigate financial losses.</p><p>Derivatives Pricing: The use of mathematical techniques such as stochastic calculus to determine the fair value of financial instruments.</p><p>Portfolio Optimization: Data-driven approaches to maximize returns while minimizing risk.</p><p>The Growing Importance of Math in Finance</p><p>The increasing complexity of financial markets and the availability of vast amounts of data have led to a shift towards quantitative approaches. Many investment banks, hedge funds, and financial institutions now prioritize quantitative models over traditional methods. This transition has fueled demand for professionals with expertise in mathematics, programming, and data science.</p><p>Moreover, machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) are playing an integral role in financial decision-making. AI-driven models can analyze massive datasets, identify patterns, and execute trades with minimal human intervention.

While setting up the components is an essential first step, fine-tuning each one will help you create a solution that works even better and scales seamlessly. In this section, we’ll share some practical tips for optimizing all these components, giving you the edge to build smarter, faster, and more responsive RAG applications.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  LangChain Optimization Tips\n</h3><p>To optimize LangChain, focus on minimizing redundant operations in your workflow by structuring your chains and agents efficiently. Use caching to avoid repeated computations, speeding up your system, and experiment with modular design to ensure that components like models or databases can be easily swapped out. This will provide both flexibility and efficiency, allowing you to quickly scale your system without unnecessary delays or complications.</p><p>Milvus serves as a highly efficient vector database, critical for retrieval tasks in a RAG system. To optimize its performance, ensure that indexes are properly built to balance speed and accuracy; consider utilizing HNSW (Hierarchical Navigable Small World) for efficient nearest neighbor search where response time is crucial. Partitioning data based on usage patterns can enhance query performance and reduce load times, enabling better scalability. Regularly monitor and adjust cache settings based on query frequency to avoid latency during data retrieval. Employ batch processing for vector insertions, which can minimize database lock contention and enhance overall throughput. Additionally, fine-tune the model parameters by experimenting with the dimensionality of the vectors; higher dimensions can improve retrieval accuracy but may increase search time, necessitating a balance tailored to your specific use case and hardware infrastructure.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Anthropic Claude 3 Haiku optimization tips\n</h3><p>Claude 3 Haiku is designed for efficiency, making it a great choice for low-latency RAG applications. Optimize token usage by structuring prompts concisely, removing redundant text, and leveraging system messages effectively to guide responses. Use function calling when applicable to offload structured processing tasks and improve response reliability. Batch process queries where possible to reduce API overhead and enhance throughput. If latency is critical, consider caching frequent queries and pre-generating responses for common questions. Fine-tune response control with temperature and top-p sampling; lower temperature values (e.g., 0.2-0.3) help maintain consistency in factual retrieval tasks. Use streaming mode for real-time applications to get faster partial responses while processing large prompts. Regularly evaluate and adjust model parameters based on performance benchmarks to balance speed and accuracy in your RAG pipeline.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  voyage-3-large optimization tips\n</h3><p>voyage-3-large provides enhanced reasoning capabilities, making it ideal for complex RAG tasks requiring deep contextual understanding. Optimize retrieval by implementing a multi-step ranking system that prioritizes highly relevant documents while filtering out lower-quality information. Use structured prompts with clearly delineated context and user queries to improve comprehension. Adjust temperature (0.1–0.3) and fine-tune top-k and top-p settings to maintain accuracy and prevent excessive variability. Take advantage of parallelized inference and request batching to improve processing efficiency. Leverage caching for high-frequency queries to reduce costs and latency. In multi-model setups, deploy voyage-3-large for intricate reasoning tasks while using smaller models for less complex queries to balance cost and performance effectively.</p><p>By implementing these tips across your components, you'll be able to enhance the performance and functionality of your RAG system, ensuring it’s optimized for both speed and accuracy. Keep testing, iterating, and refining your setup to stay ahead in the ever-evolving world of AI development.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  RAG Cost Calculator: A Free Tool to Calculate Your Cost in Seconds\n</h2><p>Estimating the cost of a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline involves analyzing expenses across vector storage, compute resources, and API usage.

These language models are being used ubiquitously across society and have triggered many claims that we are rapidly approaching Artificial General Intelligence — AI capable of replicating any human function.&nbsp;</p><p>Before getting too excited, or scared, depending on your perspective — we are also rapidly approaching a hurdle to the advancement of these language models. According to a paper published by a group from the research institute, Epoch <a href=\"https://towardsdatascience.com/the-next-ai-revolution-a-tutorial-using-vaes-to-generate-high-quality-synthetic-data/#[1]\">[1]</a>,<em> we are running out of data</em>. They estimate that by 2028 we will have reached the upper limit of possible data upon which to train language models.&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>What happens if we run out of data?</strong></h2><p>Well, if we run out of data then we aren’t going to have anything new with which to train our language models. These models will then stop improving. If we want to pursue Artificial General Intelligence then we are going to have to come up with new ways of improving AI without just increasing the volume of real-world training data.&nbsp;</p><p>One potential saviour is synthetic data which can be generated to mimic existing data and has already been used to improve the performance of models like Gemini and DBRX.&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Synthetic data beyond LLMs</strong></h2><p>Beyond overcoming data scarcity for large language models, synthetic data can be used in the following situations:&nbsp;</p><ul><li> — if we don’t want to share or use sensitive attributes, synthetic data can be generated which mimics the properties of these features while maintaining anonymity.</li><li> — if collecting data is expensive we can generate a large volume of synthetic data from a small amount of real-world data.</li><li>— datasets are biased when there is a disproportionately low number of individual data points from a particular group. Synthetic data can be used to balance a dataset.&nbsp;</li></ul><p>Imbalanced datasets can (*but not always*) be problematic as they may not contain enough information to effectively train a predictive model. For example, if a dataset contains many more men than women, our model may be biased towards recognising men and misclassify future female samples as men.&nbsp;</p><p>In this article we show the imbalance in the popular UCI<a href=\"https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/2/adult\"> Adult dataset</a><a href=\"https://towardsdatascience.com/the-next-ai-revolution-a-tutorial-using-vaes-to-generate-high-quality-synthetic-data/#[2]\">[2],</a> and how we can use a  to generate <a href=\"https://towardsdatascience.com/tag/synthetic-data/\" title=\"Synthetic Data\">Synthetic Data</a> to improve classification on this example.&nbsp;</p><p>We first download the Adult dataset. This dataset contains features such as age, education and occupation which can be used to predict the target outcome ‘income’.&nbsp;</p><pre><code># Download dataset into a dataframe\nurl = \"https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/adult/adult.data\"\ncolumns = [\n   \"age\", \"workclass\", \"fnlwgt\", \"education\", \"education-num\", \"marital-status\",\n   \"occupation\", \"relationship\", \"race\", \"sex\", \"capital-gain\",\n   \"capital-loss\", \"hours-per-week\", \"native-country\", \"income\"\n]\ndata = pd.read_csv(url, header=None, names=columns, na_values=\" ?\", skipinitialspace=True)\n\n# Drop rows with missing values\ndata = data.dropna()\n\n# Split into features and target\nX = data.drop(columns=[\"income\"])\ny = data['income'].map({'&gt;50K': 1, '&lt;=50K': 0}).values\n\n# Plot distribution of income\nplt.figure(figsize=(8, 6))\nplt.hist(data['income'], bins=2, edgecolor='black')\nplt.title('Distribution of Income')\nplt.xlabel('Income')\nplt.ylabel('Frequency')\nplt.show()</code></pre><p>In the Adult dataset, income is a binary variable, representing individuals who earn above, and below, $50,000. We plot the distribution of income over the entire dataset below. We can see that the dataset is heavily imbalanced with a far larger number of individuals who earn less than $50,000.&nbsp;</p><p>Despite this imbalance we can still train a machine learning classifier on the Adult dataset which we can use to determine whether unseen, or test, individuals should be classified as earning above, or below, 50k.&nbsp;</p><pre><code># Preprocessing: One-hot encode categorical features, scale numerical features\nnumerical_features = [\"age\", \"fnlwgt\", \"education-num\", \"capital-gain\", \"capital-loss\", \"hours-per-week\"]\ncategorical_features = [\n   \"workclass\", \"education\", \"marital-status\", \"occupation\", \"relationship\",\n   \"race\", \"sex\", \"native-country\"\n]\n\npreprocessor = ColumnTransformer(\n   transformers=[\n       (\"num\", StandardScaler(), numerical_features),\n       (\"cat\", OneHotEncoder(), categorical_features)\n   ]\n)\n\nX_processed = preprocessor.fit_transform(X)\n\n# Convert to numpy array for PyTorch compatibility\nX_processed = X_processed.toarray().astype(np.float32)\ny_processed = y.astype(np.float32)\n# Split dataset in train and test sets\nX_model_train, X_model_test, y_model_train, y_model_test = train_test_split(X_processed, y_processed, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)\n\n\nrf_classifier = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)\nrf_classifier.fit(X_model_train, y_model_train)\n\n# Make predictions\ny_pred = rf_classifier.predict(X_model_test)\n\n# Display confusion matrix\nplt.figure(figsize=(6, 4))\nsns.heatmap(cm, annot=True, fmt=\"d\", cmap=\"YlGnBu\", xticklabels=[\"Negative\", \"Positive\"], yticklabels=[\"Negative\", \"Positive\"])\nplt.xlabel(\"Predicted\")\nplt.ylabel(\"Actual\")\nplt.title(\"Confusion Matrix\")\nplt.show()</code></pre><p>Printing out the confusion matrix of our classifier shows that our model performs fairly well despite the imbalance. Our model has an overall error rate of 16% but the error rate for the positive class (income &gt; 50k) is 36% where the error rate for the negative class (income &lt; 50k) is 8%.&nbsp;</p><p>This discrepancy shows that the model is indeed biased towards the negative class. The model is frequently incorrectly classifying individuals who earn more than 50k as earning less than 50k.&nbsp;</p><p>Below we show how we can use a <a href=\"https://towardsdatascience.com/tag/variational-autoencoder/\" title=\"Variational Autoencoder\">Variational Autoencoder</a> to generate synthetic data of the positive class to balance this dataset. We then train the same model using the synthetically balanced dataset and reduce model errors on the test set.&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>How can we generate synthetic data?</strong></h2><p>There are lots of different methods for generating synthetic data. These can include more traditional methods such as SMOTE and Gaussian Noise which generate new data by modifying existing data. Alternatively Generative models such as Variational Autoencoders or General Adversarial networks are predisposed to generate new data as their architectures learn the distribution of real data and use these to generate synthetic samples.</p><p><strong>In this tutorial we use a variational autoencoder to generate synthetic data.</strong></p><p>Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) are great for synthetic data generation because they use real data to learn a continuous latent space.

From ancient practices harvesting organic cacao in the Amazon basin, to chocolatiers sculpting edible art in the mountains of Switzerland, and enormous factories in Hershey, Pennsylvania churning out 70 million kisses per day, the nuanced forms and flavors of chocolate have been integrated into many cultures and their customs. While quality can greatly vary across chocolate products, a well-known, shelf-stable, easily shareable form of chocolate are M&amp;Ms. Readily found by convenience store check-out counters and in hotel vending machines, the brightly colored pellets are a popular treat whose packaging is re-branded to fit nearly any commercializable American holiday.</p><p>While living in Denmark in 2022, I heard a concerning claim: M&amp;Ms manufactured in Europe taste different, and arguably “better,” than M&amp;Ms produced in the United States. While I recognized that fancy European chocolate is indeed quite tasty and often superior to American chocolate, it was unclear to me if the same claim should hold for M&amp;Ms. I learned that many Europeans perceive an “unpleasant” or “tangy” taste in American chocolate, which is largely attributed to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.chemistryworld.com/podcasts/butyric-acid/1017662.article\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">butyric acid</a>, a compound resulting from differences in how milk is treated before incorporation into milk chocolate.</p><p>But honestly, how much of a difference could this make for M&amp;Ms?&nbsp;? I imagined M&amp;Ms would retain a relatively processed/mass-produced/cheap candy flavor wherever they were manufactured. As the lone American visiting a diverse lab of international scientists pursuing cutting-edge research in biosustainability, I was inspired to break out my data science toolbox and investigate this M&amp;M flavor phenomenon.</p><p>To quote a European woman, who shall remain anonymous, after she tasted an American M&amp;M while traveling in New York:</p><blockquote><p>“They taste so gross. Like vomit. I don’t understand how people can eat this. I threw the rest of the bag away.”</p></blockquote><p>Vomit? Really? In my experience, children raised in the United States had no qualms about eating M&amp;Ms. Growing up, I was accustomed to bowls of M&amp;Ms strategically placed in high traffic areas around my house to provide readily available sugar. Clearly American M&amp;Ms are edible. But are they significantly different and/or inferior to their European equivalent?</p><p>In response to the anonymous European woman’s scathing report, myself and two other Americans visiting Denmark sampled M&amp;Ms purchased locally in the Lyngby Storcenter Føtex. We hoped to experience the incredible improvement in M&amp;M flavor that was apparently hidden from us throughout our youths. But curiously, we detected no obvious flavor improvements.</p><p>Unfortunately, neither preliminary study was able to conduct a side-by-side taste test with proper controls and randomized M&amp;M sampling. Thus, we turn to science.</p><p>This study seeks to remedy the previous lack of thoroughness and investigate the following questions:</p><ol><li>Is there a&nbsp;&nbsp;that European M&amp;Ms are in fact better than American M&amp;Ms?</li><li><strong>Can Europeans actually detect a difference&nbsp;</strong>between M&amp;Ms purchased in the US vs in Europe when they don’t know which one they are eating? Or is this a&nbsp;&nbsp;amongst Europeans to make Americans feel embarrassed?</li><li><strong>Are Americans actually taste-blind&nbsp;</strong>to American vs European M&amp;Ms? Or can they taste a difference but simply don’t describe this difference as “an improvement” in flavor?</li><li>Can these alleged taste differences be&nbsp;<strong>perceived by citizens of other continents</strong>? If so, do they find one flavor obviously superior?</li></ol><h3>2.1 Experimental design and data collection</h3><p>Participants were recruited by luring — er,&nbsp;&nbsp;them to a social gathering (with the promise of free food) that was conveniently co-located with the testing site. Once a participant agreed to pause socializing and join the study, they were positioned at a testing station with a trained experimenter who guided them through the following steps:</p><ul><li>Participants sat at a table and received two cups: 1 empty and 1 full of water. With one cup in each hand, the participant was asked to close their eyes, and keep them closed through the remainder of the experiment.</li><li>The experimenter randomly extracted one M&amp;M with a spoon, delivered it to the participant’s empty cup, and the participant was asked to eat the M&amp;M (eyes still closed).</li><li>After eating each M&amp;M, the experimenter collected the taste response by asking the participant to report if they thought the M&amp;M tasted: Especially Good, Especially Bad, or Normal.</li><li>Each participant received a total of 10 M&amp;Ms (5 European, 5 American), one at a time, in a random sequence determined by random.org.</li><li>Between eating each M&amp;M, the participant was asked to take a sip of water to help “cleanse their palate.”</li><li>: for each participant, the experimenter recorded the participant’s&nbsp;if this was ambiguous, the participant was asked to list the continent on which they have the strongest memories of eating candy as a child). For each of the 10 M&amp;Ms delivered, the experimenter recorded the&nbsp;&nbsp;(“Denmark” or “USA”), the&nbsp;&nbsp;and the participant’s&nbsp;. Experimenters were also encouraged to jot down any amusing phrases uttered by the participant during the test, recorded under&nbsp;(data available&nbsp;<a href=\"https://github.com/erinhwilson/mnm-taste-test/tree/main/data\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">here</a>).</li></ul><h3>2.2 Sourcing materials and recruiting participants</h3><p>Two bags of M&amp;Ms were purchased for this study. The American-sourced M&amp;Ms (“USA M&amp;M”) were acquired at the SFO airport and delivered by the author’s parents, who visited her in Denmark. The European-sourced M&amp;Ms (“Denmark M&amp;M”) were purchased at a local Føtex grocery store in Lyngby, a little north of Copenhagen.</p><p>Experiments were conducted at two main time points. The first 14 participants were tested in Lyngby, Denmark in August 2022. They mostly consisted of friends and housemates the author met at the Novo Nordisk Foundation Center for Biosustainability at the Technical University of Denmark (DTU) who came to a “going away party” into which the experimental procedure was inserted. A few additional friends and family who visited Denmark were also tested during their travels (e.g. on the train).</p><p>The remaining 37 participants were tested in Seattle, WA, USA in October 2022, primarily during a “TGIF happy hour” hosted by graduate students in the computer science PhD program at the University of Washington. This second batch mostly consisted of students and staff of the Paul. G. Allen School of Computer Science &amp; Engineering (UW CSE) who responded to the weekly Friday summoning to the Allen Center atrium for free snacks and drinks.</p><p>While this study set out to analyze global trends, unfortunately data was only collected from 51 participants the author was able to lure to the study sites and is not well-balanced nor representative of the 6 inhabited continents of Earth (Figure 1). We hope to improve our recruitment tactics in future work. For now, our analytical power with this dataset is limited to response trends for individuals from North America, Europe, and Asia, highly biased by subcommunities the author happened to engage with in late 2022.</p><p>While we did not acquire formal approval for experimentation with human test subjects, there were minor risks associated with this experiment: participants were warned that they may be subjected to increased levels of sugar and possible “unpleasant flavors” as a result of participating in this study. No other risks were anticipated.</p><p>After the experiment however, we unfortunately observed several cases of deflated pride when a participant learned their taste response was skewed more positively towards the M&amp;M type they were not expecting. This pride deflation seemed most severe among European participants who learned their own or their fiancé’s preference skewed towards USA M&amp;Ms, though this was not quantitatively measured and cannot be confirmed beyond anecdotal evidence.</p><h3>3.1 Overall response to “USA M&amp;Ms” vs “Denmark M&amp;Ms”</h3><h4><strong>3.1.1 Categorical response analysis — entire dataset</strong></h4><p>In our first analysis, we count the total number of “Bad”, “Normal”, and “Good” taste responses and report the percentage of each response received by each M&amp;M type. M&amp;Ms from Denmark more frequently received “Good” responses than USA M&amp;Ms but also more frequently received “Bad” responses. M&amp;Ms from the USA were most frequently reported to taste “Normal” (Figure 2). This may result from the elevated number of participants hailing from North America, where the USA M&amp;M is the default and thus more “Normal,” while the Denmark M&amp;M was more often perceived as better or worse than the baseline.</p><p><sup>Figure 2. Qualitative taste response distribution across the whole dataset. The percentage of taste responses for “Bad”, “Normal” or “Good” was calculated for each type of M&amp;M. Figure made with Altair.</sup></p><p>Now let’s break out some <a href=\"https://towardsdatascience.com/tag/statistics/\" title=\"Statistics\">Statistics</a>, such as a&nbsp;-squared (X2) test to compare our observed distributions of categorical taste responses. Using the scipy.stats&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.stats.chi2_contingency.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">chi2_contingency</a>&nbsp;function, we built contingency tables of the observed counts of “Good,” “Normal,” and “Bad” responses to each M&amp;M type. Using the X2 test to evaluate the null hypothesis that there is no difference between the two M&amp;Ms, we found the&nbsp;-value for the test statistic to be 0.0185, which is significant at the common&nbsp;-value cut off of 0.05, but not at 0.01. So a solid “maybe,” depending on whether you’d like this result to be significant or not.</p><h4><strong>3.1.2 Quantitative response analysis — entire dataset.</strong></h4><p>The X2 test helps evaluate if there is a difference in categorical responses, but next, we want to determine a relative taste&nbsp;&nbsp;between the two M&amp;M types. To do this, we converted taste responses to a quantitative distribution and calculated a&nbsp;Briefly, “Bad” = 1, “Normal” = 2, “Good” = 3. For each participant, we averaged the taste scores across the 5 M&amp;Ms they tasted of each type, maintaining separate taste scores for each M&amp;M type.</p><p>With the average taste score for each M&amp;M type in hand, we turn to scipy.stats&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.stats.ttest_ind.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">ttest_ind</a>&nbsp;(“T-test”) to evaluate if the means of the USA and Denmark M&amp;M taste scores are different (the null hypothesis being that the means are identical). If the means are significantly different, it would provide evidence that one M&amp;M is perceived as significantly tastier than the other.</p><p>We found the average taste scores for USA M&amp;Ms and Denmark M&amp;Ms to be quite close (Figure 3), and not significantly different (T-test:&nbsp;= 0.721). Thus, across all participants, we do not observe a difference between the perceived taste of the two M&amp;M types (or if you enjoy parsing triple negatives: “we&nbsp;&nbsp;the null hypothesis that there is&nbsp;&nbsp;a difference”).</p><p>But does this change if we separate participants by continent of origin?</p><h3>3.2 Continent-specific responses to “USA M&amp;Ms” vs “Denmark M&amp;Ms”</h3><p>We repeated the above X2 and T-test analyses after grouping participants by their continents of origin. The Australia and South America groups were combined as a minimal attempt to preserve data privacy. Due to the relatively small sample size of even the combined Australia/South America group (=3), we will refrain from analyzing trends for this group but include the data in several figures for completeness and enjoyment of the participants who may eventually read this.</p><h4><strong>3.2.1 Categorical response analysis — by continent</strong></h4><p>In Figure 4, we display both the taste response counts (upper panel,&nbsp;<em>note the interactive legend</em>) and the response percentages (lower panel) for each continent group. Both North America and Asia follow a similar trend to the whole population dataset: participants report Denmark M&amp;Ms as “Good” more frequently than USA M&amp;Ms, but also report Denmark M&amp;Ms as “Bad” more frequently. USA M&amp;Ms were most frequently reported as “Normal” (Figure 4).</p><p>On the contrary, European participants report USA M&amp;Ms as “Bad” nearly 50% of the time and “Good” only 18% of the time, which is the most negative and least positive response pattern, respectively (when excluding the under-sampled Australia/South America group).</p><p><sup>Figure 4. Qualitative taste response distribution by continent. Upper panel: counts of taste responses — click the legend to interactively filter! Lower panel: percentage of taste responses for each type of M&amp;M. Figure made with Altair.</sup></p><p>This appeared striking in bar chart form, however only North America had a significant X2&nbsp;-value () when evaluating each continent’s difference in taste response profile between the two M&amp;M types. The European&nbsp;-value is perhaps “approaching significance” in some circles, but we’re about to accumulate several more hypothesis tests and should be mindful of multiple hypothesis testing (Table 1). A false positive result here would be devastating.</p><p>When comparing the taste response profiles between two continents for the same M&amp;M type, there are a couple interesting notes. First, we observed no major taste discrepancies between all pairs of continents when evaluating Denmark M&amp;Ms — the world seems generally consistent in their range of feelings about M&amp;Ms sourced from Europe (right column X2&nbsp;-values, Table 2). To visualize this comparison more easily, we reorganize the bars in Figure 4 to group them by M&amp;M type (Figure 5).</p><p><sup>Figure 5. Qualitative taste response distribution by M&amp;M type, reported as percentages. (Same data as Figure 4 but re-arranged). Figure made with Altair.</sup></p><p>However, when comparing continents to each other in response to USA M&amp;Ms, we see larger discrepancies. We found one pairing to be significantly different: European and North American participants evaluated USA M&amp;Ms very differently () (Table 2). It seems very unlikely that this observed difference is by random chance (left column, Table 2).</p><h4><strong>3.2.2 Quantitative response analysis — by continent</strong></h4><p>We again convert the categorical profiles to quantitative distributions to assess continents’ relative preference of M&amp;M types. For North America, we see that the taste score means of the two M&amp;M types are actually quite similar, but there is a higher density around “Normal” scores for USA M&amp;Ms (Figure 6A). The European distributions maintain a bit more of a separation in their means (though not quite significantly so), with USA M&amp;Ms scoring lower (Figure 6B). The taste score distributions of Asian participants is most similar (Figure 6C).</p><p>Reorienting to compare the quantitative means between continents’ taste scores for the same M&amp;M type, only the comparison between North American and European participants on USA M&amp;Ms is significantly different based on a T-test () (Figure 6D), though now we&nbsp;&nbsp;are in danger of multiple hypothesis testing! Be cautious if you are taking this analysis at all seriously.</p><p>At this point, I feel myself considering that maybe Europeans are not just making this up. I’m not saying it’s as dramatic as some of them claim, but perhaps a difference does indeed exist… To some degree, North American participants also perceive a difference, but the evaluation of Europe-sourced M&amp;Ms is not consistently positive or negative.</p><h3>3.3 M&amp;M taste alignment chart</h3><p>In our analyses thus far, we did not account for the baseline differences in M&amp;M appreciation between participants. For example, say Person 1 scored all Denmark M&amp;Ms as “Good” and all USA M&amp;Ms as “Normal”, while Person 2 scored all Denmark M&amp;Ms as “Normal” and all USA M&amp;Ms as “Bad.” They would have the same relative preference for Denmark M&amp;Ms over USA M&amp;Ms, but Person 2 perhaps just does not enjoy M&amp;Ms as much as Person 1, and the relative preference signal is muddled by averaging the raw scores.</p><p>Inspired by the Lawful/Chaotic x Good/Evil alignment chart used in tabletop role playing games like Dungeons &amp; Dragons©<img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/2122.png\" alt=\"™\">, in Figure 7, we establish an M&amp;M alignment chart to help determine the distribution of participants across M&amp;M enjoyment classes.</p><p>Notably, the upper right quadrant where both M&amp;M types are perceived as “Good” to “Normal” is mostly occupied by North American participants and a few Asian participants. All European participants land in the left half of the figure where USA M&amp;Ms are “Normal” to “Bad”, but Europeans are somewhat split between the upper and lower halves, where perceptions of Denmark M&amp;Ms range from “Good” to “Bad.”</p><p>An interactive version of Figure 7 is provided below for the reader to explore the counts of various M&amp;M alignment regions.</p><p><sup>Figure 7 (interactive): click and brush your mouse over the scatter plot to see the counts of continents in different M&amp;M enjoyment regions. Figure made with Altair.</sup></p><h3>3.4 Participant taste response ratio</h3><p>Next, to factor out baseline M&amp;M enjoyment and focus on participants’ relative preference between the two M&amp;M types, we took the log ratio of each person’s&nbsp;<strong>USA M&amp;M taste score average</strong>&nbsp;divided by their&nbsp;<strong>Denmark M&amp;M taste score average</strong>.</p><p>As such, positive scores indicate a preference towards USA M&amp;Ms while negative scores indicate a preference towards Denmark M&amp;Ms.</p><p>On average, European participants had the strongest preference towards Denmark M&amp;Ms, with Asians also exhibiting a slight preference towards Denmark M&amp;Ms (Figure 8). To the two Europeans who exhibited deflated pride upon learning their slight preference towards USA M&amp;Ms, fear not: you did not think USA M&amp;Ms were “Good,” but simply ranked them as less bad than Denmark M&amp;Ms (see participant_id 4 and 17 in the interactive version of Figure 7). If you assert that M&amp;Ms are a bad American invention not worth replicating and return to consuming artisanal European chocolate, your honor can likely be restored.</p><p>North American participants are pretty split in their preference ratios: some fall quite neutrally around 0, others strongly prefer the familiar USA M&amp;M, while a handful moderately prefer Denmark M&amp;Ms. Anecdotally, North Americans who learned their preference skewed towards European M&amp;Ms displayed signals of inflated pride, as if their results signaled posh refinement.</p><p>Overall, a T-test comparing the distributions of M&amp;M preference ratios shows a possibly significant difference in the means between European and North American participants (), but come on, this is like the 20th p-value I’ve reported — this one is probably too close to call.</p><h3>3.5 Taste inconsistency and “Perfect Classifiers”</h3><p>For each participant, we assessed their taste score consistency by averaging the standard deviations of their responses to each M&amp;M type, and plotting that against their preference ratio (Figure 9).</p><p><sup>Figure 9. Participant taste consistency by preference ratio. The x-axis is a participant’s relative M&amp;M preference ratio. The y-axis is the average of the standard deviation of their USA M&amp;M scores and the standard deviation of their Denmark M&amp;M scores. A value of 0 on the y-axis indicates perfect consistency in responses, while higher values indicate more inconsistent responses. Figure made with Altair.</sup></p><p>Most participants were somewhat inconsistent in their ratings, ranking the same M&amp;M type differently across the 5 samples. This would be expected if the taste difference between European-sourced and American-sourced M&amp;Ms is not actually all that perceptible. Most inconsistent were participants who gave the same M&amp;M type “Good”, “Normal”,&nbsp;&nbsp;“Bad” responses (e.g., points high on the y-axis, with wider standard deviations of taste scores), indicating lower taste perception abilities.</p><p>Intriguingly, four participants — one from each continent group — were perfectly consistent: they reported the same taste response for each of the 5 M&amp;Ms from each M&amp;M type, resulting in an average standard deviation of 0.0 (bottom of Figure 9). Excluding the one of the four who simply rated all 10 M&amp;Ms as “Normal”, the other three appeared to be “Perfect Classifiers” — either rating all M&amp;Ms of one type “Good” and the other “Normal”, or rating all M&amp;Ms of one type “Normal” and the other “Bad.” Perhaps these folks are “super tasters.”</p><p>Another possible explanation for the inconsistency in individual taste responses is that there exists a perceptible taste difference based on the M&amp;M color. Visually, the USA M&amp;Ms were noticeably more smooth and vibrant than the Denmark M&amp;Ms, which were somewhat more “splotchy” in appearance (Figure 10A). M&amp;M color was recorded during the experiment, and although balanced sampling was not formally built into the experimental design, colors seemed to be sampled roughly evenly, with the exception of Blue USA M&amp;Ms, which were oversampled (Figure 10B).</p><p>We briefly visualized possible differences in taste responses based on color (Figure 11), however we do not believe there are enough data to support firm conclusions. After all, on average each participant would likely only taste 5 of the 6 M&amp;M colors once, and 1 color not at all. We leave further M&amp;M color investigations to future work.</p><p>We assured each participant that there was no “right “answer” in this experiment and that all feelings are valid. While some participants took this to heart and occasionally spent over a minute deeply savoring each M&amp;M and evaluating it as if they were a sommelier, many participants seemed to view the experiment as a competition (which occasionally led to deflated or inflated pride). Experimenters wrote down quotes and notes in conjunction with M&amp;M responses, some of which were a bit “colorful.” We provide a hastily rendered word cloud for each M&amp;M type for entertainment purposes (Figure 12) though we caution against reading too far into them without diligent sentiment analysis.</p><p>Overall, there does not appear to be a “global consensus” that European M&amp;Ms are better than American M&amp;Ms. However, European participants tended to more strongly express negative reactions to USA M&amp;Ms while North American participants seemed relatively split on whether they preferred M&amp;Ms sourced from the USA vs from Europe. The preference trends of Asian participants often fell somewhere between the North Americans and Europeans.</p><p>Therefore, I’ll admit that it’s probable that Europeans are not engaged in a grand coordinated lie about M&amp;Ms. The skew of most European participants towards Denmark M&amp;Ms is compelling, especially since I was the experimenter who personally collected much of the taste response data. If they found a way to cheat, it was done well enough to exceed my own passive perception such that I didn’t notice. However, based on this study, it would appear that a strongly negative “vomit flavor” is not universally perceived and does not become apparent to non-Europeans when tasting both M&amp;Ms types side by side.</p><p>We hope this study has been illuminating! We would look forward to extensions of this work with improved participant sampling, additional M&amp;M types sourced from other continents, and deeper investigations into possible taste differences due to color.</p><p>Thank you to everyone who participated and ate M&amp;Ms in the name of science!</p><p><em>Article by Erin H.

While GPUs enable parallel processing, optimizing performance requires low-level expertise in CUDA kernel programming—a complex, hardware-specific skill. Most developers rely on high-level frameworks (e.g., PyTorch) that abstract away CUDA, sacrificing potential speed gains. This creates inefficiency, especially as AI scales, and limits accessibility to hardware-level optimizations.</p><p>How does it solve the problem? Sakana AI developed The AI CUDA Engineer, an agentic framework combining frontier LLMs and evolutionary optimization. Instead of manual coding, the framework automates converting PyTorch operations into optimized CUDA kernels. It uses evolutionary strategies like “crossover” (mixing code snippets) and an “innovation archive” to iteratively discover highly efficient kernels. By leveraging LLMs to generate and refine CUDA code, the system bypasses human expertise barriers while exploring novel, hardware-aware optimizations.</p><p>What are the key findings? The AI CUDA Engineer achieved 10–100x speedups over standard PyTorch operations and up to 5x faster performance than existing production-grade CUDA kernels. Crucially, the framework uncovered optimizations that even expert engineers might miss, demonstrating AI’s ability to “invent” better hardware-level solutions. Released with the work are 17,000 verified CUDA kernels and benchmark results showing 50x gains over unoptimized code.</p><p>Why does it matter? Automated CUDA optimization democratizes high-performance computing, letting ML engineers focus on model design rather than hardware-specific tuning. It directly reduces inference costs for models like LLMs (critical for climate impact) and enables new applications needing real-time processing (e.g., robotics). By open-sourcing kernels, the work provides a foundation for future research in AI-driven code optimization.</p>","contentLength":2233,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"[Boost]","url":"https://dev.to/carldebilly/-412d","date":1740170691,"author":"Carl de Billy","guid":8811,"unread":true,"content":"<h2>Any devs actually getting a leg up using AI tools?</h2><h3>Sasha for Uno Platform ・ Feb 21</h3>","contentLength":83,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Free AI StartUp name generator","url":"https://dev.to/shu1up/free-ai-startup-name-generator-nfj","date":1740167256,"author":"Evgeny Shut","guid":8790,"unread":true,"content":"<p>I was always struggling with how to name my every brand-new project, so I've built a simple name generator (for domains as well).

We will see some examples of games that are typically analysed within game theory and lay the foundation for deeper insights into the capabilities of game theory in the later chapters. But before we go into the details, I want to introduce you to some applications of game theory, that show the multitude of areas game-theoretic concepts can be applied to.&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Applications of game theory</strong></h2><p>Does it make sense to vote for a small party in an election if this party may not have a chance to win anyway? Is it worth starting a price war with your competitor who offers the same goods as you? Do you gain anything if you reduce your catch rate of overfished areas if your competitors simply carry on as before? Should you take out insurance if you believe that the government will pay for the reconstruction after the next hurricane anyway? And how should you behave in the next auction where you are about to bid on your favourite Picasso painting?&nbsp;</p><p>All these questions (and many more) live within the area of applications that can be modelled with game theory. Whenever a situation includes strategic decisions in interaction with others, game-theoretic concepts can be applied to describe this situation formally and search for decisions that are not made intuitively but that are backed by a notion of rationality. Key to all the situations above is that your decisions depend on other people’s behaviour. If everybody agrees to conserve the overfished areas, you want to play along to preserve nature, but if you think that everybody else will continue fishing, why should you be the only one to stop? Likewise, your voting behaviour in an election might heavily depend on your assumptions about other people’s votes. If nobody votes for that candidate, your vote will be wasted, but if everybody thinks so, the candidate doesn’t have a chance at all. Maybe there are many people who say “I would vote for him if others vote for him too”. </p><p>Similar situations can happen in very different situations. Have you ever thought about having food delivered and everybody said “You don’t have to order anything because of me, but if you order anyway, I’d take some french fries”? All these examples can be applications of game theory, so let’s start understanding what game theory is all about.&nbsp;</p><p>When you hear the word , you might think of  such as Minecraft,  such as Monopoly, or  such as poker. There are some common principles to all these games: We always have some  who are allowed to do certain things determined by the game’s . For example, in poker, you can raise, check or give up. In Monopoly, you can buy a property you land on or don’t buy it. What we also have is some notion of how to  the game. In poker, you have to get the best hand to win and in Monopoly, you have to be the last person standing after everybody went bankrupt. That also means that some actions are better than others in some scenarios. If you have two aces on the hand, staying in the game is better than giving up.&nbsp;</p><p>When we look at games from the perspective of game theory, we use the same concepts, just more formally.</p><p>A game consists of a set of  = {1, .., n}, where each player has a set of  and a . The set of strategies is determined by the rules of the games. For example, it could be S = {check, raise, give-up} and the player would have to decide which of these actions they want to use. The utility function u (also called ) describes how valuable a certain action of a player would be, given the actions of the other players. Every player wants to maximize their utility, but now comes the tricky part: The utility of an action of yours depends on the other players’ actions. But for them, the same applies: Their actions’ utilities depend on the actions of the other players (including yours).&nbsp;</p><p>Let’s consider a well-known game to illustrate this point. In rock-paper-scissors, we have n=2 players and each player can choose between three actions, hence the strategy set is S={rock, paper, scissors} for each player. But the utility of an action depends on what the other player does. If our opponent chooses rock, the utility of paper is high (1), because paper beats rock. But if your opponent chooses scissors, the utility of paper is low (-1), because you would lose. Finally, if your opponent chooses paper as well, you reach a draw and the utility is 0.&nbsp;</p><p>Instead of writing down the utility function for each case individually, it is common to display games in a matrix like this:</p><p>The first player decides for the row of the matrix by selecting his action and the second player decides for the column. For example, if player 1 chooses paper and player 2 chooses scissors, we end up in the cell in the third column and second row. The value in this cell is the utility for both players, where the first value corresponds to player 1 and the second value corresponds to player 2. (-1,1) means that player 1 has a utility of -1 and player 2 has a utility of 1. Scissors beat paper.&nbsp;</p><p>Now we have understood the main components of a game in game theory. Let me add a few more hints on what game theory is about and what assumptions it uses to describe its scenarios.&nbsp;</p><ul><li>We often assume that the players select their actions at the same time (like in rock-paper-scissors). We call such games  games. There are also  games in which players take turns deciding on their actions (like in chess). We will consider these cases in a later chapter of this tutorial.&nbsp;</li><li>In game theory, it is typically assumed that the players  with each other so they can’t come to an agreement before deciding on their actions. In rock-paper-scissors, you wouldn’t want to do that anyway, but there are other games where communication would make it easier to choose an action. However, we will always assume that communication is not possible.&nbsp;</li><li>Game theory is considered a  theory, not a descriptive one. That means we will analyse games concerning the question “What would be the rational solution?” This may not always be what people do in a likewise situation in reality. Such descriptions of real human behaviour are part of the research field of behavioural economics, which is located on the border between <a href=\"https://towardsdatascience.com/tag/psychology/\" title=\"Psychology\">Psychology</a> and economics.&nbsp;</li></ul><p>Let us become more familiar with the main concepts of game theory by looking at some typical games that are often analyzed. Often, such games are derived from are story or scenario that may happen in the real world and require people to decide between some actions. One such story could be as follows:&nbsp;</p><p>Say we have two criminals who are suspected of having committed a crime. The police have some circumstantial evidence, but no actual proof for their guilt. Hence they question the two criminals, who now have to decide if they want to confess or deny the crime. If you are in the situation of one of the criminals, you might think that denying is always better than confessing, but now comes the tricky part: The police propose a deal to you. If you confess while your partner denies, you are considered a crown witness and will not be punished. In this case, you are free to go but your partner will go to jail for six years. Sounds like a good deal, but be aware, that the outcome also depends on your partner’s action. If you both confess, there is no crown witness anymore and you both go to jail for three years. If you both deny, the police can only use circumstantial evidence against you, which will lead to one year in prison for both you and your partner. But be aware, that your partner is offered the same deal. If you deny and he confesses, he is the crown witness and you go to jail for six years. How do you decide?</p><p>The game derived from this story is called the  and is a typical example of a game in game theory. We can visualize it as a matrix just like we did with rock-paper-scissors before and in this matrix, we easily see the dilemma the players are in. If both deny, they receive a rather low punishment. But if you assume that your partner denies, you might be tempted to confess, which would prevent you from going to jail. But your partner might think the same, and if you both confess, you both go to jail for longer. Such a game can easily make you go round in circles. We will talk about solutions to this problem in the next chapter of this tutorial. First, let’s consider some more examples.&nbsp;</p><p>You and your friend want to go to a concert together. You are a fan of Bach’s music but your friend favors the Russian 20th. century composer Igor Stravinsky. However, you both want to avoid being alone in any concert. Although you prefer Bach over Stravinsky, you would rather go to the Stravinsky concert with your friend than go to the Bach concert alone. We can create a matrix for this game:&nbsp;</p><p>You decide for the row by going to the Bach or Stravinsky concert and your friend decides for the column by going to one of the concerts as well. For you, it would be best if you both chose Bach. Your reward would be 2 and your friend would get a reward of 1, which is still better for him than being in the Stravinsky concert all by himself. However, he would be even happier, if you were in the Stravinsky concert together.&nbsp;</p><p>Do you remember, that we said players are not allowed to communicate before making their decision? This example illustrates why. If you could just call each other and decide where to go, this would not be a game to investigate with game theory anymore. But you can’t call each other so you just have to go to any of the concerts and hope you will meet your friend there. What do you do?&nbsp;</p><p>A third example brings us to the realm of international politics. The world would be a much happier place with fewer firearms, wouldn’t it? However, if nations think about disarmament, they also have to consider the choices other nations make. If the USA disarms, the Soviet Union might want to rearm, to be able to attack the USA — that was the thinking during the Cold War, at least. Such a scenario could be described with the following matrix:&nbsp;</p><p>As you see, when both nations disarm, they get the highest reward (3 each), because there are fewer firearms in the world and the risk of war is minimized. However, if you disarm, while the opponent upgrades, your opponent is in the better position and gets a reward of 2, while you only get 0. Then again, it might have been better to upgrade yourself, which gives a reward of 1 for both players. That is better than being the only one who disarms, but not as good as it would get if both nations disarmed.&nbsp;</p><p>All these examples have one thing in common: There is no single option that is always the best. Instead, the utility of an action for one player always depends on the other player’s action, which, in turn, depends on the first player’s action and so on. Game theory is now interested in finding the optimal solution and deciding what would be the rational action; that is, the action that maximizes the expected reward. Different ideas on how exactly such a solution looks like will be part of the next chapter in this series.&nbsp;</p><p>Before continuing with finding solutions in the next chapter, let us recap what we have learned so far.&nbsp;</p><ul><li>A game consists of , that decide for , which have a  or .&nbsp;</li><li>The utility/reward of an action  on the other players’ actions.&nbsp;</li><li>In  games, players decide for their actions simultaneously. In  games, they take turns.&nbsp;</li><li>The  is a very popular example of a game in game theory.</li><li>Games become increasingly interesting if there is no single action that is better than any other.&nbsp;</li></ul><p>Now that you are familiar with how games are described in game theory, you can check out the next chapter to learn how to find solutions for games in game theory.&nbsp;</p><p>The topics introduced here are typically covered in standard textbooks on game theory.

With the current housing shortage and affordability concerns, Rocket simplifies the homeownership process through an intuitive and AI-driven experience. This comprehensive framework streamlines every step of the homeownership journey, empowering consumers to search, purchase, and manage home financing effortlessly. Rocket integrates home search, financing, and servicing in a single environment, providing a seamless and efficient experience.</p><p>The Rocket brand is a synonym for offering simple, fast, and trustworthy digital solutions for complex transactions. Rocket is dedicated to helping clients realize their dream of homeownership and financial freedom. Since its inception, Rocket has grown from a single mortgage lender to an network of businesses that creates new opportunities for its clients.</p><p>Rocket takes a complicated process and uses technology to make it simpler.

Maintaining strong relationships with our large, loyal client base and hedge positions to cover financial obligations is key to our success. With the volume of business we do, even small improvements can have a significant impact.</p><p>In this post, we share how we modernized Rocket’s data science solution on AWS to increase the speed to delivery from eight weeks to under one hour, improve operational stability and support by reducing incident tickets by over 99% in 18 months, power 10 million automated data science and AI decisions made daily, and provide a seamless data science development experience.</p><h2>Rocket’s legacy data science environment challenges</h2><p>Rocket’s previous data science solution was built around Apache Spark and combined the use of a legacy version of the Hadoop environment and vendor-provided Data Science Experience development tools. The Hadoop environment was hosted on <a href=\"http://aws.amazon.com/ec2\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud</a> (Amazon EC2) servers, managed in-house by Rocket’s technology team, while the data science experience infrastructure was hosted on premises. Communication between the two systems was established through Kerberized Apache Livy (HTTPS) connections over <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/privatelink/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">AWS PrivateLink</a>.</p><p>Data exploration and model development were conducted using well-known machine learning (ML) tools such as Jupyter or Apache Zeppelin notebooks. Apache Hive was used to provide a tabular interface to data stored in HDFS, and to integrate with Apache Spark SQL. Apache HBase was employed to offer real-time key-based access to data. Model training and scoring was performed either from Jupyter notebooks or through jobs scheduled by Apache’s Oozie orchestration tool, which was part of the Hadoop implementation.</p><p>Despite the benefits of this architecture, Rocket faced challenges that limited its effectiveness:</p><ul><li><strong>Accessibility limitations:</strong> The data lake was stored in HDFS and only accessible from the Hadoop environment, hindering integration with other data sources. This also led to a backlog of data that needed to be ingested.</li><li><strong>Steep learning curve for data scientists:</strong> Many of Rocket’s data scientists did not have experience with Spark, which had a more nuanced programming model compared to other popular ML solutions like scikit-learn. This created a challenge for data scientists to become productive.</li><li><strong>Responsibility for maintenance and troubleshooting:</strong> Rocket’s DevOps/Technology team was responsible for all upgrades, scaling, and troubleshooting of the Hadoop cluster, which was installed on bare EC2 instances. This resulted in a backlog of issues with both vendors that remained unresolved.</li><li><strong>Balancing development vs. production demands:</strong> Rocket had to manage work queues between development and production, which were always competing for the same resources.</li><li> Rocket sought to support more real-time and streaming inferencing use cases, but this was limited by the capabilities of MLeap for real-time models and Spark Streaming for streaming use cases, which were still experimental at that time.</li><li>Inadequate data security and DevOps support – The previous solution lacked robust security measures, and there was limited support for development and operations of the data science work.</li></ul><p>Rocket’s legacy data science architecture is shown in the following diagram.</p><p>The diagram depicts the flow; the key components are detailed below:</p><ol><li> Data is ingested into the system using Attunity data ingestion in Spark SQL.</li><li><strong>Data Storage and Processing:</strong> All compute is done as Spark jobs inside of a Hadoop cluster using Apache Livy and Spark. Data is stored in HDFS and is accessed via Hive, which provides a tabular interface to the data and integrates with Spark SQL. HBase is employed to offer real-time key-based access to data.</li><li> Data exploration and model development are conducted using tools such as Jupyter or Orchestration, which communicate with the Spark server over Kerberized Livy connection.</li><li><strong>Model Training and Scoring:</strong> Model training and scoring is performed either from Jupyter notebooks or through jobs scheduled by Apache’s Oozie orchestration tool, which is part of the Hadoop implementation.</li></ol><h2>Rocket’s migration journey</h2><p>At Rocket, we believe in the power of continuous improvement and constantly seek out new opportunities. One such opportunity is using data science solutions, but to do so, we must have a strong and flexible data science environment.</p><p>To address the legacy data science environment challenges, Rocket decided to migrate its ML workloads to the <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker-ai/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Amazon SageMaker AI</a> suite. This would allow us to deliver more personalized experiences and understand our customers better. To promote the success of this migration, we collaborated with the AWS team to create automated and intelligent digital experiences that demonstrated Rocket’s understanding of its clients and kept them connected.</p><p>We implemented an AWS multi-account strategy, standing up <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker-ai/studio/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Amazon SageMaker Studio</a> in a build account using a network-isolated Amazon VPC. This allows us to separate development and production environments, while also improving our security stance.</p><p>We moved our new work to SageMaker Studio and our legacy Hadoop workloads to <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/emr/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Amazon EMR</a>, connecting to the old Hadoop cluster using Livy and <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker-ai/notebooks/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">SageMaker notebooks</a> to ease the transition. This gives us access to a wider range of tools and technologies, enabling us to choose the most appropriate ones for each problem we’re trying to solve.</p><p>SageMaker AI has been instrumental in empowering our data science community with the flexibility to choose the most appropriate tools and technologies for each problem, resulting in faster development cycles and higher model accuracy. With SageMaker Studio, our data scientists can seamlessly develop, train, and deploy models without the need for additional infrastructure management.</p><p>As a result of this modernization effort, SageMaker AI enabled Rocket to scale our data science solution across Rocket Companies and integrate using a hub-and-spoke model. The ability of SageMaker AI to automatically provision and manage instances has allowed us to focus on our data science work rather than infrastructure management, increasing the number of models in production by five times and data scientists’ productivity by 80%.</p><p>Our data scientists are empowered to use the most appropriate technology for the problem at hand, and our security stance has improved. Rocket can now compartmentalize data and compute, as well as compartmentalize development and production. Additionally, we are able to provide model tracking and lineage using <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker-ai/experiments/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Amazon SageMaker Experiments</a> and artifacts discoverable using the SageMaker model registry and <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker-ai/feature-store/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Amazon SageMaker Feature Store</a>. All the data science work has now been migrated onto SageMaker, and all the old Hadoop work has been migrated to Amazon EMR.</p><p>Overall, SageMaker AI has played a critical role in enabling Rocket’s modernization journey by building a more scalable and flexible ML framework, reducing operational burden, improving model accuracy, and accelerating deployment times.</p><p>The successful modernization allowed Rocket to overcome our previous limitations and better support our data science efforts. We were able to improve our security stance, make work more traceable and discoverable, and give our data scientists the flexibility to choose the most appropriate tools and technologies for each problem. This has helped us better serve our customers and drive business growth.</p><p>Rocket’s new data science solution architecture on AWS is shown in the following diagram.</p><p>The solution consists of the following components:</p><ol><li>Data is ingested into the data account from on-premises and external sources.</li><li> Raw data is refined into consumable layers (raw, processed, conformed, and analytical) using a combination of <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/glue\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">AWS Glue</a> extract, transform, and load (ETL) jobs and EMR jobs.</li><li> Refined data is registered in the data account’s AWS Glue Data Catalog and exposed to other accounts via Lake Formation. Analytic data is stored in <a href=\"http://aws.amazon.com/redshift\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Amazon Redshift</a>. Lake Formation makes this data available to both the build and compute accounts. For the build account, access to production data is restricted to read-only.</li><li> Data science development is done using SageMaker Studio. Data engineering development is done using AWS Glue Studio. Both disciplines have access to Amazon EMR for Spark development. Data scientists have access to the entire SageMaker ecosystem in the build account.</li><li>&nbsp;SageMaker trained models developed in the build account are registered with an MLFlow instance. Code artifacts for both data science activities and data engineering activities are stored in Git. Deployment initiation is controlled as part of CI/CD.</li><li>&nbsp;We have a number of workflow triggers. For online scoring, we typically provide an external-facing endpoint using Amazon EKS with Istio. We have numerous jobs that are launched by <a href=\"http://aws.amazon.com/lambda\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">AWS Lambda</a> functions that in turn are triggered by timers or events. Processes that run may include AWS Glue ETL jobs, EMR jobs for additional data transformations or model training and scoring activities, or SageMaker pipelines and jobs performing training or scoring activities.</li></ol><p>We’ve evolved a long way in modernizing our infrastructure and workloads. We started our journey supporting six business channels and 26 models in production, with dozens in development. Deployment times stretched for months and required a team of three system engineers and four ML engineers to keep everything running smoothly. Despite the support of our internal DevOps team, our issue backlog with the vendor was an unenviable 200+.</p><p>Today, we are supporting nine organizations and over 20 business channels, with a whopping 210+ models in production and many more in development. Our average deployment time has gone from months to just weeks—sometimes even down to mere days! With just one part-time ML engineer for support, our average issue backlog with the vendor is practically non-existent. We now support over 120 data scientists, ML engineers, and analytical roles. Our framework mix has expanded to include 50% SparkML models and a diverse range of other ML frameworks, such as PyTorch and scikit-learn. These advancements have given our data science community the power and flexibility to tackle even more complex and challenging projects with ease.</p><p>The following table compares some of our metrics before and after migration.</p><table border=\"1px\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"10px\"><thead><tr></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>New data ingestion project took 4–8 weeks</td><td>Data-driven ingestion takes under one hour</td></tr><tr><td>Operation Stability and Supportability</td><td>Over a hundred incidents and tickets in 18 months</td><td>Fewer incidents: one per 18 months</td></tr><tr><td>Data scientists spent 80% of their time waiting on their jobs to run</td><td>Seamless data science development experience</td></tr><tr><td>Powers 10 million automated data science and AI decisions made daily</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Throughout the journey of modernizing our data science solution, we’ve learned valuable lessons that we believe could be of great help to other organizations who are planning to undertake similar endeavors.</p><p>First, we’ve come to realize that managed services can be a game changer in optimizing your data science operations.</p><p>The isolation of development into its own account while providing read-only access to production data is a highly effective way of enabling data scientists to experiment and iterate on their models without putting your production environment at risk. This is something that we’ve achieved through the combination of SageMaker AI and Lake Formation.</p><p>Another lesson we learned is the importance of training and onboarding for teams. This is particularly true for teams that are moving to a new environment like SageMaker AI. It’s crucial to understand the best practices of utilizing the resources and features of SageMaker AI, and to have a solid understanding of how to move from notebooks to jobs.</p><p>Lastly, we found that although Amazon EMR still requires some tuning and optimization, the administrative burden is much lighter compared to hosting directly on Amazon EC2. This makes Amazon EMR a more scalable and cost-effective solution for organizations who need to manage large data processing workloads.</p><p>This post provided overview of the successful partnership between AWS and Rocket Companies. Through this collaboration, Rocket Companies was able to migrate many ML workloads and implement a scalable ML framework. Ongoing with AWS, Rocket Companies remains committed to innovation and staying at the forefront of customer satisfaction.</p><p>Don’t let legacy systems hold back your organization’s potential.

Al principio, todo comienza con el input, es decir, toda la información que este \"bebé\" recibe: imágenes, palabras, números, sonidos... Esto es lo que, en términos tecnológicos, llamamos entrenamiento.</p><p>Durante esta fase, la IA observa patrones, prueba hipótesis y comete errores, como un niño que balbucea antes de aprender a hablar. Eventualmente, con suficiente información y aprendizaje, empieza a interactuar con el mundo a través del output: sus respuestas, predicciones y acciones. Por supuesto, cometerá errores, muchas veces dirá cosas sin sentido, pero poco a poco irá mejorando.</p><blockquote><p>BabyAI, Fuente: © 2025. Creada con inteligencia artificial por DALL·E.</p></blockquote><p>La IA no es algo nuevo. Desde hace décadas ha logrado hitos impresionantes, como vencer a los mejores jugadores del mundo en juegos complejos. Sin embargo, la verdadera explosión llegó con el desarrollo de modelos avanzados capaces de interpretar y predecir resultados con una precisión sin precedentes. Hoy la IA no solo nos ayuda a automatizar tareas, sino que también abre la puerta a avances que transforman la humanidad.</p><p>Ahora imagina que eres una persona ocupada que recibe llamadas constantes. Algunas son importantes, como ofertas de trabajo o temas familiares, pero muchas son irrelevantes: promociones, seguros o cambios de plan que no necesitas. Y supongamos que quieres enseñarle a tu \"bebé IA\" a filtrar estas llamadas. Necesitas que reconozca las importantes, las clasifique y, si no valen la pena, las bloquee automáticamente.</p><p>Hasta hace poco, este tipo de proyecto implicaría contratar expertos en programación, desarrollar desde cero modelos complejos de voz e interpretación de lenguaje, configurar servidores y preocuparte por su mantenimiento. ¿El costo? Alto, y el tiempo invertido aún más.</p><p>Aquí es donde la computación en la nube entra en juego. AWS (Amazon Web Services), la plataforma líder mundial en servicios cloud, te ofrece todas las herramientas necesarias para implementar soluciones como esta de forma sencilla, escalable y económica. ¿Cómo funciona? AWS pone a tu disposición una serie de servicios preconfigurados, como modelos de procesamiento de voz, APIs para conectar con dispositivos y sistemas de generación de voz. Solo pagas por lo que usas.</p><p>Por ejemplo, si tu bot de llamadas no recibe uso un mes, tu costo será cero. No necesitas servidores físicos, ni personal dedicado al mantenimiento. Además, AWS realiza copias de seguridad automáticas, garantizando la continuidad de tus datos. Esta flexibilidad y escalabilidad han llevado a empresas de todo el mundo a migrar a la nube, dejando atrás las infraestructuras tradicionales que resultaban costosas y complicadas de mantener.</p><p>AWS no solo revoluciona la forma en que las empresas gestionan sus operaciones, sino que también democratiza el acceso a herramientas avanzadas que antes parecían inalcanzables.</p><p>Entre la amplia gama de servicios que ofrece AWS, uno destaca particularmente en el ámbito de la inteligencia artificial: Amazon SageMaker. Lanzado en 2017, SageMaker es una plataforma diseñada para facilitar el entrenamiento, despliegue y gestión de modelos de aprendizaje automático.</p><blockquote><p>Amazon SageMaker's architecture, Fuente: AWS. © Amazon Web Services, Inc.</p></blockquote><p>SageMaker es un taller completamente equipado para proyectos de IA. Por ejemplo, puedes usar sus notebooks administrados para experimentar y entrenar tus modelos sin preocuparte por la infraestructura subyacente. Cuando tu modelo esté listo, SageMaker te permite desplegarlo rápidamente en producción, incluso escalando automáticamente según la demanda.</p><p>Lo mejor de SageMaker es que, como con otros servicios de AWS, solo pagas por lo que usas. Esto incluye costos por almacenamiento, computación y solicitudes realizadas. Además, su estructura de precios es transparente, lo que te permite calcular el costo de tus proyectos sin sorpresas.</p><p>SageMaker es una herramienta poderosa que facilita el desarrollo y despliegue de modelos de aprendizaje automático, pero su versatilidad puede jugar en contra si no se usa con precaución. Uno de los golpes más duros que sufrí durante mi aprendizaje inicial fue subestimar la importancia de seleccionar correctamente las instancias que utilizaba para mis experimentos.</p><p>Por ejemplo, en una ocasión elegí una instancia más potente de lo que realmente necesitaba para entrenar un modelo relativamente simple. El resultado: un gasto innecesario en recursos y un golpe a mi presupuesto. Peor aún, olvidé apagar la instancia al terminar, lo que me costó alrededor de US $100 adicionales.</p><p>Mi lección fue clara: siempre evalúa cuidadosamente la capacidad de las instancias según las necesidades del proyecto. Además, no olvides verificar y apagar cualquier recurso no utilizado al final de cada sesión. Ahora utilizo alarmas en AWS para recibir notificaciones si dejo algo corriendo por accidente. Aprende de mi experiencia para evitar este tipo de errores.</p><ul><li>No dejar servicios corriendo indefinidamente: Es fácil emocionarse mientras pruebas tu modelo, pero olvida el descuido. Establece recordatorios o utiliza herramientas de monitoreo para cerrar instancias y recursos al final del día.</li><li>No improvisar el diseño del modelo: Antes de programar, dedica tiempo a planificar la lógica, dividir los datos y pensar en el flujo completo del proyecto. La improvisación puede llevar a muchas iteraciones innecesarias y un modelo ineficiente.</li></ul><ul><li>Divide tu conjunto de datos: Utiliza una proporción como 80% para entrenamiento, 10% para validación y 10% para prueba. Esto ayuda a evitar problemas como el overfitting.</li><li>Define el propósito del modelo desde el principio: Tener claridad sobre el resultado esperado y cómo se va a implementar en producción es crucial. Muchas veces se deja esto para el final, lo que complica el despliegue y limita la utilidad del modelo.</li><li>Optimiza los hiper parámetros: Dedica tiempo a ajustar hiper parámetros para mejorar la precisión del modelo. Utilizar herramientas como Amazon SageMaker Automatic Model Tuning puede ahorrarte tiempo y mejorar los resultados.</li><li>Usa SageMaker Autopilot para prototipos rápidos: Si estás explorando datos por primera vez, esta función automatiza el entrenamiento y selección de modelos, permitiéndote concentrarse en las decisiones estratégicas.</li><li>Usa Amazon SageMaker Ground Truth y cómo utilizar esta herramienta para crear conjuntos de datos de entrenamiento de alta calidad mediante etiquetado humano y aprendizaje activo.</li></ul><p>Amazon SageMaker es una solución completa para entrenar, desplegar y administrar modelos de aprendizaje automático. Es ideal para quienes buscan un entorno potente y escalable, sin la necesidad de construir todo desde cero. Sin embargo, como cualquier herramienta poderosa, requiere un uso responsable para evitar costos innecesarios y aprovechar al máximo sus capacidades.</p><ul><li>Usarlo:Cuando necesitas un entorno integrado y escalable para modelos de machine learning, desde prototipos hasta despliegues en producción.</li><li>No usarlo: Para proyectos muy pequeños o donde los costos de infraestructura sean una limitación crítica.</li></ul><p>Gracias, <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/juanzamdev/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">JuanZam</a> Artificial Intelligence Engineer</p>","contentLength":7279,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Dev.to is 90% misleading and dangerous AI generated content.","url":"https://dev.to/8907234/devto-is-flooded-with-misleading-and-dangerous-ai-generated-content-3jfj","date":1740160654,"author":"Aegon II Targaryen","guid":8734,"unread":true,"content":"<p>Open any of the top posts on your feed on dev.to and then run the text through an AI detector such as <a href=\"https://quillbot.com/ai-content-detector\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Quillbot</a>.

The implication being, if you don't, you are operating at a suboptimal level of performance.

I have tried these tools; they take a long time to generate code, and when they do the generated code is often wrong and seems to lack contextual awareness. If it does suggest something good, it's often so dead simple that I might as well have written it myself. I actually view reliance on these tools, in their current form, as a huge risk. Not only is the code generated of consistently poor quality, I worry this is training developers to turn off their brains and not reason about the impact of code they write.<p>\nBut, I do accept the possibility that I'm not using the tools right (or not using the right tools). So, I'm curious if anyone here is actually getting a huge productivity bump from these tools?

However, not all applications demand the massive size and complexity of LLMs, the computational power required makes them impractical for many use cases. This is why Small Language Models (SLMs) entered the scene to make powerful AI models more accessible by shrinking in size.</p><p>Let's go through what SLMs are, how they are made small, their benefits and limitations, real-world use cases, and how they can be used on mobile and desktop devices.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  What are Small Language Models?\n</h2><p>Small Language Models (SLMs) are lightweight versions of traditional language models designed to operate efficiently on resource-constrained environments such as smartphones, embedded systems, or low-power computers. While large language models have hundreds of billions—or even trillions—of parameters, SLMs typically range from&nbsp;<strong>1 million to 10 billion parameters</strong>. The small language models are significantly smaller but they still retain core NLP capabilities like text generation, summarization, translation, and question-answering. </p><blockquote><p>Some practitioners don't like the term \"Small Language Model\", because a billion parameter is not small by any means.

Through collaboration between AWS and DXC Technology, we’ve developed a scalable voice-to-voice (V2V) translation prototype that transforms how contact centers handle multi-lingual customer interactions.</p><p>In this post, we discuss how AWS and DXC used <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/connect/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Amazon Connect</a> and other AWS AI services to deliver near real-time V2V translation capabilities.</p><h2>Challenge: Serving customers in multiple languages</h2><p>In Q3 2024, DXC Technology approached AWS with a critical business challenge: their global contact centers needed to serve customers in multiple languages without the exponential cost of hiring language-specific agents for the lower volume languages. Previously, DXC had explored several existing alternatives but found limitations in each approach – from communication constraints to infrastructure requirements that impacted reliability, scalability, and operational costs. DXC and AWS decided to organize a focused hackathon where DXC and AWS Solution Architects collaborated to:</p><ul><li>Define essential requirements for real-time translation</li><li>Establish latency and accuracy benchmarks</li><li>Create seamless integration paths with existing systems</li><li>Develop a phased implementation strategy</li><li>Prepare and test an initial proof of concept setup</li></ul><p>For DXC, this prototype was used as an enabler, allowing technical talent maximization, operational transformation, and cost improvements through:</p><ul><li>Best technical expertise delivery – Hiring and matching agents based on technical knowledge rather than spoken language, making sure customers get top technical support regardless of language barriers</li><li>Global operational flexibility – Removing geographical and language constraints in hiring, placement, and support delivery while maintaining consistent service quality across all languages</li><li>Cost reduction – Eliminating multi-language expertise premiums, specialized language training, and infrastructure costs through pay-per-use translation model</li><li>Similar experience to native speakers – Maintaining natural conversation flow with near real-time translation and audio feedback, while delivering premium technical support in customer’s preferred language</li></ul><p>The Amazon Connect V2V translation prototype uses AWS advanced speech recognition and machine translation technologies to enable real-time conversation translation between agents and customers, allowing them to speak in their preferred languages while having natural conversations. It consists of the following key components:</p><ul><li>Speech recognition – The customer’s spoken language is captured and converted into text using <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/transcribe/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Amazon Transcribe</a>, which serves as the speech recognition engine. The transcript (text) is then fed into the machine translation engine.</li><li>Machine translation – <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/translate/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Amazon Translate</a>, the machine translation engine, translates the customer’s transcript into the agent’s preferred language in near real time. The translated transcript is converted back into speech using <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/polly/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Amazon Polly</a>, which serves as the text-to-speech engine.</li><li>Bidirectional translation – The process is reversed for the agent’s response, translating their speech into the customer’s language and delivering the translated audio to the customer.</li><li>Seamless integration – The V2V translation sample project integrates with Amazon Connect, enabling agents to handle customer interactions in multiple languages without any additional effort or training, using the <a href=\"https://github.com/amazon-connect/amazon-connect-streams\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Amazon Connect Streams JS</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/aws/connect-rtc-js\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Amazon Connect RTC JS</a> libraries.</li></ul><p>The prototype can be extended with other AWS AI services to further customize the translation capabilities. It’s open source and ready for customization to meet your specific needs.</p><p>The following diagram illustrates the solution architecture.</p><p>The following screenshot illustrates a sample agent web application.</p><p>The user interface consists of three sections:</p><ul><li>Contact Control Panel – A softphone client using Amazon Connect</li><li>Customer Controls – Customer-to-agent interaction controls, including Transcribe Customer Voice, Translate Customer Voice, and Synthesize Customer Voice</li><li>Agent controls – Agent-to-customer interaction controls, including Transcribe Agent Voice, Translate Agent Voice, and Synthesize Agent Voice</li></ul><h2>Challenges when implementing near real-time voice translation</h2><p>The Amazon Connect V2V sample project was designed to minimize the audio processing time from the moment the customer or agent finishes speaking until the translated audio stream is started. However, even with the shortest audio processing time, the user experience still doesn’t match the experience of a real conversation when both are speaking the same language. This is due to the specific pattern of the customer only hearing the agent’s translated speech, and the agent only hearing the customer’s translated speech. The following diagram displays that pattern.</p><p>The example workflow consists of the following steps:</p><ol><li>The customer starts speaking in their own language, and speaks for 10 seconds.</li><li>Because the agent only hears the customer’s translated speech, the agent first hears 10 seconds of silence.</li><li>When customer finishes speaking, the audio processing time takes 1–2 seconds, during which time both the customer and agent hear silence.</li><li>The customer’s translated speech is streamed to the agent. During that time, the customer hears silence.</li><li>When the customer’s translated speech playback is complete, the agent starts speaking, and speaks for 10 seconds.</li><li>Because customer only hears the agent’s translated speech, the customer hears 10 seconds of silence.</li><li>When the agent finishes speaking, the audio processing time takes 1–2 seconds, during which time both the customer and agent hear silence.</li><li>The agent’s translated speech is streamed to the agent. During that time, the agent hears silence.</li></ol><p>In this scenario, the customer hears a single block of 22–24 seconds of a complete silence, from the moment they finished speaking until they hear the agent’s translated voice. This creates a suboptimal experience, because the customer might not be certain what is happening during these 22–24 seconds—for instance, if the agent was able to hear them, or if there was a technical issue.</p><p>In a face-to-face conversation scenario between two people that don’t speak the same language, they might have another person as a translator or interpreter. An example workflow consists of the following steps:</p><ol><li>Person A speaks in their own language, which is heard by Person B and the translator.</li><li>The translator translates what Person A said to Person B’s language. The translation is heard by Person B and Person A.</li></ol><p>Essentially, Person A and Person B hear each other speaking their own language, and they also hear the translation (from the translator). There’s no waiting in silence, which is even more important in non-face-to-face conversations (such as contact center interactions).</p><p>To optimize the customer/agent experience, the Amazon Connect V2V sample project implements audio streaming add-ons to simulate a more natural conversation experience. The following diagram illustrates an example workflow.</p><p>The workflow consists of the following steps:</p><ol><li>The customer starts speaking in their own language, and speaks for 10 seconds.</li><li>The agent hears the customer’s original voice, at a lower volume (“Stream Customer Mic to Agent” enabled).</li><li>When the customer finishes speaking, the audio processing time takes 1–2 seconds. During that time, the customer and agent hear subtle audio feedback—contact center background noise—at a very low volume (“Audio Feedback” enabled).</li><li>The customer’s translated speech is then streamed to the agent. During that time, the customer hears their translated speech, at a lower volume (“Stream Customer Translation to Customer” enabled).</li><li>When the customer’s translated speech playback is complete, the agent starts speaking, and speaks for 10 seconds.</li><li>The customer hears the agent’s original voice, at a lower volume (“Stream Agent Mic to Customer” enabled).</li><li>When the agent finishes speaking, the audio processing time takes 1–2 seconds. During that time, the customer and agent hear subtle audio feedback—contact center background noise—at a very low volume (“Audio Feedback” enabled).</li><li>The agent’s translated speech is then streamed to the agent. During that time, the agent hears their translated speech, at a lower volume (“Stream Agent Translation to Agent” enabled).</li></ol><p>In this scenario, the customer hears two short blocks (1–2 seconds) of subtle audio feedback, instead of a single block of 22–24 seconds of complete silence. This pattern is much closer to a face-to-face conversation that includes a translator.</p><p>The audio streaming add-ons provide additional benefits, including:</p><ul><li>Voice characteristics – In cases when the agent and customer only hear their translated and synthesized speech, the actual voice characteristics are lost. For instance, the agent can’t hear if the customer was talking slow or fast, if the customer was upset or calm, and so on. The translated and synthesized speech doesn’t carry over that information.</li><li>Quality assurance – In cases when call recording is enabled, only the customer’s original voice and the agent’s synthesized speech are recorded, because the translation and the synthetization are done on the agent (client) side. This makes it difficult for QA teams to properly evaluate and audit the conversations, including the many silent blocks within it. Instead, when the audio streaming add-ons are enabled, there are no silent blocks, and the QA team can hear the agent’s original voice, the customer’s original voice, and their respective translated and synthesized speech, all in a single audio file.</li><li>Transcription and translation accuracy – Having both the original and translated speech available in the call recording makes it straightforward to detect specific words that would improve transcription accuracy (by using Amazon Transcribe custom vocabularies) or translation accuracy (using Amazon Translate custom terminologies), to make sure that your brand names, character names, model names, and other unique content are transcribed and translated to the desired result.</li></ul><h2>Get started with Amazon Connect V2V</h2><p>Ready to transform your contact center’s communication?

At AWS, we’re using the power of models in <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Amazon Bedrock</a> to drive automation of complex processes that have traditionally been challenging to streamline.</p><p>In this post, we focus on one such complex workflow: document processing. This serves as an example of how generative AI can streamline operations that involve diverse data types and formats.</p><h2>Challenges with document processing</h2><p>Document processing often involves handling three main categories of documents:</p><ul><li>Structured – For example, forms with fixed fields</li><li>Semi-structured – Documents that have a predictable set of information but might vary in layout or presentation</li><li>Unstructured – For example, paragraphs of text or notes</li></ul><p>Traditionally, processing these varied document types has been a pain point for many organizations.

Through a practical use case of processing a patient health package at a doctor’s office, you will see how this technology can extract and synthesize information from all three document types, potentially improving data accuracy and operational efficiency.</p><p>This intelligent document processing solution uses Amazon Bedrock FMs to orchestrate a sophisticated workflow for handling multi-page healthcare documents with mixed content types. The solution uses the FM’s tool use capabilities, accessed through the Amazon Bedrock <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/conversation-inference.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Converse API</a>. This enables the FMs to not just process text, but to actively engage with various external tools and APIs to perform complex document analysis tasks.</p><p>The solution employs a strategic multi-model approach, optimizing for both performance and cost by selecting the most appropriate model for each task:</p><ul><li><p><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/upgraded-claude-3-5-sonnet-from-anthropic-available-now-computer-use-public-beta-and-claude-3-5-haiku-coming-soon-in-amazon-bedrock/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Anthropic’s Claude 3 Haiku</a> – Serves as the workflow orchestrator due to its low latency and cost-effectiveness.

The API serves as the foundation for this intelligent workflow, providing a unified interface for model communication while maintaining conversation state throughout the processing pipeline. The API’s standardized approach to tool definition and function calling provides consistent interaction patterns across different processing stages.

The workflow processes a patient health information package containing three distinct document types:</p><ul><li>Structured document – A new patient intake form with standardized fields for personal information, medical history, and current symptoms. This form follows a consistent layout with clearly defined fields and check boxes, making it an ideal example of a structured document.</li><li>Semi-structured document – A health insurance card that contains essential coverage information. Although insurance cards generally contain similar information (policy number, group ID, coverage dates), they come from different providers with varying layouts and formats, showing the semi-structured nature of these documents.</li><li>Unstructured document – A handwritten doctor’s note from an initial consultation, containing free-form observations, preliminary diagnoses, and treatment recommendations.

When a document is uploaded through the Streamlit interface, Haiku analyzes the request and determines the sequence of tools needed by consulting the tool definitions in . These definitions include tools for the following:</p><ul><li>Document processing pipeline – Handles initial PDF processing and classification</li><li>Document notes processing – Extracts information from medical notes</li><li>New patient information processing – Processes patient intake forms</li><li>Insurance form processing – Handles insurance card information</li></ul><p>The following code is an example tool definition for extracting consultation notes. Here, <code>extract_consultation_notes</code> represents the name of the function that the orchestration workflow will call, and  defines the schema of the input parameter that will be passed to the function.

The model acts as an intelligent orchestrator, making decisions about the following:</p><ul><li>Which document processing tools to invoke</li><li>The sequence of processing steps</li><li>How to handle different document types within the same package</li><li>When to summarize and complete the processing</li></ul><p>This orchestration is managed through a continuous conversation loop that processes tool requests and their results until the entire document package has been processed.</p><p>The first key decision in the workflow is initiating the document classification process. Through the  class, the solution uses Anthropic’s Claude 3.5 Sonnet to analyze and categorize each page of the uploaded document into three main types: intake forms, insurance cards, and doctor’s notes:</p><pre><code># from document_classifier.py\nclass DocumentClassifier:\n    def __init__(self, file_handler):\n        self.sonnet_3_5_bedrock_utils = BedrockUtils(\n            model_id=ModelIDs.anthropic_claude_3_5_sonnet\n        )\n        \n    def categorize_document(self, file_paths):\n        # Convert documents to binary format for model processing\n        binary_data_array = []\n        for file_path in file_paths:\n            binary_data, media_type = self.file_handler.get_binary_for_file(file_path)\n            binary_data_array.append((binary_data[0], media_type))\n\n        # Prepare message for classification\n        message_content = [\n            {\"image\": {\"format\": media_type, \"source\": {\"bytes\": data}}}\n            for data, media_type in binary_data_array\n        ]\n        \n        # Create classification request\n        message_list = [{\n            \"role\": 'user',\n            \"content\": [\n                *message_content,\n                {\"text\": \"What types of document is in this image?\"}\n            ]\n        }]\n        \n        # Define system message for classification\n        system_message = [{\n            \"text\": '''You are a medical document processing agent. \n                      Categorize images as: INTAKE_FORM, INSURANCE_CARD, or DOC_NOTES'''\n        }]\n        \n        # Get classification from model\n        response = self.sonnet_3_5_bedrock_utils.invoke_bedrock(\n            message_list=message_list,\n            system_message=system_message\n        )\n        return [response['output']['message']]\n</code></pre><p>Based on the classification results, the FM determines the next tool to be invoked. The tool’s description and input schema define exactly what information needs to be extracted. Following the previous example, let’s assume the next page to be processed is a consultation note. The workflow will invoke the <code>extract_consultation_notes</code> function. This function processes documents to extract detailed medical information. Like the classification process discussed earlier, it first converts the documents to binary format suitable for model processing. The key to accurate extraction lies in how the images and system message are combined:</p><pre><code>def extract_info(self, file_paths):\n    # Convert documents to binary data\n    # This will follow the same pattern to as in the classification function\n    message_content = [\n        {\"image\": {\"format\": media_type, \"source\": {\"bytes\": data}}}\n        for data, media_type in binary_data_array\n    ]\n\n    message_list = [{\n        \"role\": 'user',\n        \"content\": [\n            *message_content,  # Include the processed document images\n            {\"text\": '''Extract all information from this file\n                       If you find a visualization\n                           - Provide a detailed description in natural language\n                           - Use domain specific language for the description\n                    '''}\n        ]\n    }]\n    \n    system_message = [{\n        \"text\": '''You are a medical consultation agent with expertise in diagnosing and treating various health conditions.\n                   You have a deep understanding of human anatomy, physiology, and medical knowledge across different specialties.\n                   During the consultation, you review the patient's medical records, test results, and documentation provided.\n                   You analyze this information objectively and make associations between the data and potential diagnoses.\nAssociate a confidence score to each extracted information. This should reflect how confident the model in the extracted value matched the requested entity.\n        '''}\n    ]\n    \n    response = self.bedrock_utils.invoke_bedrock(\n        message_list=message_list,\n        system_message=system_message\n    )\n    return [response['output']['message']]\n</code></pre><p>The system message serves three crucial purposes:</p><ul><li>Establish medical domain expertise for accurate interpretation.</li><li>Provide guidelines for handling different types of information (text and visualizations).</li><li>Provide a self-scored confidence. Although this is not an independent grading mechanism, the score is directionally indicative of how confident the model is in its own extraction.</li></ul><p>Following the same pattern, the FM will use the other tools in the  definition to save and summarize the results.</p><p>A unique advantage of using a multi-modal FM for the extraction task is its ability to have a deep understanding of the text it is extracting. For example, the following code is an abstract of the data schema we are requesting as input to the  function. Refer to the code in <a href=\"https://github.com/aws-samples/anthropic-on-aws/blob/main/medical-idp/utils/constants.py#L133\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">constants.py</a> for full definition. The model needs to not only extract a transcript, but also understand it to extract such structured data from an unstructured document. This significantly reduces the postprocessing efforts required for the data to be consumed by a downstream application.</p><pre><code>\"consultation\": {\n                            \"type\": \"object\",\n                            \"properties\": {\n                            \"date\": {\"type\": \"string\"},\n                            \"concern\": {\n                                \"type\": \"object\",\n                                \"properties\": {\n                                    \"primaryComplaint\": {\n                                        \"type\": \"string\",\n                                        \"description\": \"Primary medical complaint of the patient.

To redact this information, you can pass enable_guardrails as true. This will use the guardrail you setup earlier as part of the information extraction process and mask information identified as PII or PIH.</p><pre><code>processor.process_file(prompt=prompt, \n                                        enable_guardrails=True,\n                                        toolspecs=toolspecs,\n      …\n)</code></pre><p>Finally, cross-document validation is crucial for maintaining data accuracy and compliance in healthcare settings. Although the current implementation performs basic consistency checks through the <a href=\"https://github.com/aws-samples/anthropic-on-aws/blob/main/medical-idp/utils/constants.py#L35\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">summary prompt</a>, organizations can extend the framework by implementing a dedicated validation tool that integrates with their specific business rules and compliance requirements. Such a tool could perform sophisticated validation logic like insurance policy verification, appointment date consistency checks, or any other domain-specific validation requirements, providing complete data integrity across the document package.</p><p>As Amazon Bedrock continues to evolve, several powerful features can be integrated into this document processing workflow to enhance its enterprise readiness, performance, and cost-efficiency. Let’s explore how these advanced capabilities can take this solution to the next level:</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/inference-profiles.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Inference profiles</a> in Amazon Bedrock define a model and its associated Regions for routing invocation requests, enabling various tasks such as usage tracking, cost monitoring, and cross-Region inference. These profiles help users track metrics through <a href=\"http://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Amazon CloudWatch</a> logs, monitor costs with cost allocation tags, and increase throughput by distributing requests across multiple Regions.</li><li><a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/prompt-caching.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Prompt caching</a> can help when you have workloads with long and repeated contexts that are frequently reused for multiple queries. Instead of reprocessing the entire context for each document, the workflow can reuse cached prompts, which is particularly beneficial when using the same image across different tooling workflows. With support for multiple cache checkpoints, this feature can substantially reduce processing time and inference costs while maintaining the workflow’s intelligent orchestration capabilities.</li><li><a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/prompt-routing.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Intelligent prompt routing</a> can dynamically select the most appropriate model for each task based on performance and cost requirements. Rather than explicitly assigning Anthropic’s Claude 3 Haiku for orchestration and Anthropic’s Claude 3.5 Sonnet for document analysis, the workflow can use intelligent routing to automatically choose the optimal model within the Anthropic family for each request. This approach simplifies model management while providing cost-effective processing of different document types, from simple structured forms to complex handwritten notes, all through a single endpoint.</li></ul><p>This intelligent document processing solution demonstrates the power of combining Amazon Bedrock FMs with tool use capabilities to create sophisticated, self-orchestrating workflows. By using Anthropic’s Claude 3 Haiku for orchestration and Anthropic’s Claude 3.5 Sonnet for complex visual tasks, the solution effectively handles structured, semi-structured, and unstructured documents while maintaining high accuracy and compliance standards.</p><p>Key benefits of this approach include:</p><ul><li>Reduced manual processing through intelligent automation</li><li>Improved accuracy through specialized model selection</li><li>Built-in compliance with guardrails for sensitive data</li><li>Flexible architecture that adapts to various document types</li><li>Cost-effective processing through strategic model usage</li></ul><p>As organizations continue to digitize their operations, solutions like this showcase how generative AI can transform traditional document processing workflows.

While these models are trained on vast amounts of generic data, they often lack the organization-specific context and up-to-date information needed for accurate responses in business settings. Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques help address this by grounding LLMs in relevant data during inference, but these models can still generate non-deterministic outputs and occasionally fabricate information even when given accurate source material. For organizations deploying LLMs in production applications—particularly in critical domains such as healthcare, finance, or legal services—these residual hallucinations pose serious risks, potentially leading to misinformation, liability issues, and loss of user trust.</p><p>To address these challenges, we introduce a practical solution that combines the flexibility of LLMs with the reliability of drafted, curated, verified answers. Our solution uses two key <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Amazon Bedrock</a> services: <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/knowledge-bases/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases</a>, a fully managed service that you can use to store, search, and retrieve organization-specific information for use with LLMs; and <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/agents/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Amazon Bedrock Agents</a>, a fully managed service that you can use to build, test, and deploy AI assistants that can understand user requests, break them down into steps, and execute actions. Similar to how a customer service team maintains a bank of carefully crafted answers to frequently asked questions (FAQs), our solution first checks if a user’s question matches curated and verified responses before letting the LLM generate a new answer. This approach helps prevent hallucinations by using trusted information whenever possible, while still allowing the LLM to handle new or unique questions. By implementing this technique, organizations can improve response accuracy, reduce response times, and lower costs.&nbsp;Whether you’re new to AI development or an experienced practitioner, this post provides step-by-step guidance and code examples to help you build more reliable AI applications.</p><p>Our solution implements a verified semantic cache using the <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/APIReference/API_agent-runtime_Retrieve.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases Retrieve API</a> to reduce hallucinations in LLM responses while simultaneously improving latency and reducing costs. This read-only semantic cache acts as an intelligent intermediary layer between the user and Amazon Bedrock Agents, storing curated&nbsp;and&nbsp;verified question-answer pairs.</p><p>When a user submits a query, the solution first evaluates its semantic similarity with existing verified questions in the knowledge base. For highly similar queries (greater than 80% match), the&nbsp;solution bypasses the LLM completely and returns the curated&nbsp;and&nbsp;verified answer directly. When partial matches (60–80% similarity) are found, the&nbsp;solution uses the verified answers as few-shot examples to guide the LLM’s response, significantly improving accuracy and consistency. For queries with low similarity (less than 60%) or no match, the&nbsp;solution falls back to standard LLM processing, making sure that user questions receive appropriate responses.</p><p>This approach offers several key benefits:</p><ul><li> By minimizing unnecessary LLM invocations for frequently answered questions, the solution significantly reduces operational costs at scale</li><li> Curated and verified answers minimize the possibility of hallucinations for known user queries, while few-shot prompting enhances accuracy for similar questions.</li><li> Direct retrieval of cached answers provides near-instantaneous responses for known queries, improving the overall user experience.</li></ul><p>The semantic cache serves as a growing repository of trusted responses, continuously improving the&nbsp;solution’s reliability while maintaining efficiency in handling user queries.</p><p>The solution architecture in the preceding figure consists of the following components and workflow. Let’s assume that the question “What date will AWS re:invent 2024 occur?” is within the verified semantic cache. The corresponding answer is also input as “AWS re:Invent 2024 takes place on December 2–6, 2024.” Let’s walkthrough an example of how this solution would handle a user’s question.</p><p>a. User submits a question “When is re:Invent happening this year?”, which is received by the Invoke Agent function.</p><p>b. The function checks the semantic cache (Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases) using the Retrieve API.</p><p>c. Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases performs a semantic search and finds a similar question with an 85% similarity score.</p><p>2. Response paths: (Based on the 85% similarity score in , our solution follows the strong match path)</p><p>a. Strong match (similarity score greater than 80%):</p><p>i. Invoke Agent function returns exactly the verified answer “AWS re:Invent 2024 takes place on December 2–6, 2024” directly from the Amazon Bedrock knowledge base, providing a deterministic response.</p><p>ii. No LLM invocation needed, response in less than 1 second.</p><p>b. Partial match (similarity score 60–80%):</p><p>i. The Invoke Agent function invokes the Amazon Bedrock agent and provides the cached answer as a few-shot example for the agent through Amazon Bedrock Agents <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/agents-session-state.html#prompt-session-attribute-ex\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">promptSessionAttributes</a>.</p><p>ii. If the question was “What’s the schedule for AWS events in December?”, our solution would provide the verified re:Invent dates to guide the Amazon Bedrock agent’s response with additional context.</p><p>iii. Providing the Amazon Bedrock agent with a curated and verified example might help increase accuracy.</p><p>c. No match (similarity score less than 60%):</p><p>i. If the user’s question isn’t similar to any of the curated and verified questions in the cache, the Invoke Agent function invokes the Amazon Bedrock agent without providing it any additional context from cache.</p><p>ii. For example, if the question was “What hotels are near re:Invent?”, our solution would invoke the Amazon Bedrock agent directly, and the agent would use the tools at its disposal to formulate a response.</p><p>3. Offline knowledge management:</p><p>a. Verified question-answer pairs are stored in a verified Q&amp;A Amazon S3 bucket (<a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/s3/\">Amazon Simple Storage Service</a>), and must be updated or reviewed periodically to make sure that the cache contains the most recent and accurate information.</p><p>b. The S3 bucket is periodically synchronized with the Amazon Bedrock knowledge base. This offline batch process makes sure that the semantic cache remains up-to-date without impacting real-time operations.</p><p>You need to meet the following prerequisites for the walkthrough:</p><p>Once you have the prerequisites in place, use the following steps to set up the solution in your AWS account.</p><h3>Step 0: Set up the necessary infrastructure</h3><p>Follow the instructions in the <a href=\"https://github.com/aws-samples/Reducing-Hallucinations-in-LLM-Agents-with-a-Verified-Semantic-Cache/blob/main/README.md\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">README</a> of the <a href=\"https://github.com/aws-samples/Reducing-Hallucinations-in-LLM-Agents-with-a-Verified-Semantic-Cache/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Git repository</a> to set up the infrastructure for this solution. All the following code samples are extracted from the Jupyter notebook in this repository.</p><h3>Step 1: Set up two Amazon Bedrock knowledge bases</h3><p>This step creates two Amazon Bedrock knowledge bases. The agent knowledge base stores Amazon Bedrock service documentation, while the cache knowledge base contains curated and verified question-answer pairs. This setup uses the <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-python/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">AWS SDK for Python (Boto3)</a> to interact with AWS services.</p><div><div><pre><code>agent_knowledge_base = BedrockKnowledgeBase(\n    kb_name=agent_knowledge_base_name,\n    kb_description=\"Knowledge base used by Bedrock Agent\",\n    data_bucket_name=agent_bucket_name,\n    chunking_strategy=\"FIXED_SIZE\",\n    suffix=f'{agent_unique_id}-f'\n)\n\ncache_knowledge_base = BedrockKnowledgeBase(\n    kb_name=cache_knowledge_base_name,\n    kb_description=\"Verified cache for Bedrock Agent System\",\n    data_bucket_name=cache_bucket_name,\n    chunking_strategy=\"NONE\",  # We do not want to chunk our question-answer pairs\n    suffix=f'{cache_unique_id}-f'\n)</code></pre></div></div><p>This establishes the foundation for your semantic caching solution, setting up the AWS resources to store the agent’s knowledge and verified cache entries.</p><h3>Step 2: Populate the agent knowledge base and associate it with an Amazon Bedrock agent</h3><p>For this walkthrough, you will create an LLM Amazon Bedrock agent specialized in answering questions about Amazon Bedrock. For this example, you will ingest Amazon Bedrock documentation in the form of the User Guide PDF into the Amazon Bedrock knowledge base. This will be the primary dataset. After ingesting the data, you create an agent with specific instructions:</p><div><pre><code>agent_instruction = \"\"\"You are the Amazon Bedrock Agent. You have access to a \nknowledge base with information about the Amazon Bedrock service on AWS. \nUse it to answer questions.\"\"\"\n\nagent_id = agents_handler.create_agent(\n    agent_name,\n    agent_description,\n    agent_instruction,\n    [agent_foundation_model],\n    kb_arns=[agent_kb_arn] # Associate agent with our Agent knowledge base\n)</code></pre></div><p>This setup enables the Amazon Bedrock agent to use the ingested knowledge to provide responses about Amazon Bedrock services. To test it, you can ask a question that isn’t present in the agent’s knowledge base, making the LLM either refuse to answer or hallucinate.</p><div><pre><code>invoke_agent(\"What are the dates for reinvent 2024?\", session_id=\"test\")\n# Response: Unfortunately, the dates for the AWS re:Invent 2024 conference have not \n# been announced yet by Amazon. The re:Invent conference is typically held in late \n# November or early December each year, but the specific dates for 2024 are not \n# available at this time. AWS usually announces the dates for their upcoming \n# re:Invent event around 6-9 months in advance.</code></pre></div><h3>Step 3: Create a cache dataset with known question-answer pairs and populate the cache knowledge base</h3><p>In this step, you create a raw dataset of verified question-answer pairs that aren’t present in the agent knowledge base. These curated&nbsp;and&nbsp;verified answers serve as our semantic cache to prevent hallucinations on known topics. Good candidates for inclusion in this cache are:</p><ol><li><strong>Frequently asked questions (FAQs):</strong>&nbsp;Common queries that users often ask, which can be answered consistently and accurately.</li><li><strong>Critical questions requiring deterministic answers:</strong>&nbsp;Topics where precision is crucial, such as pricing information, service limits, or compliance details.</li><li><strong>Time-sensitive information:</strong>&nbsp;Recent updates, announcements, or temporary changes that might not be reflected in the main RAG knowledge base.</li></ol><p>By carefully curating this cache with high-quality, verified answers to such questions, you can significantly improve the accuracy and reliability of your&nbsp;solution’s responses. For this walkthrough, use the following example pairs for the cache:</p><p><code>Q:&nbsp;'What are the dates for reinvent 2024?'</code><code>A: 'The AWS re:Invent conference was held from December 2-6 in 2024.'</code></p><p><code>Q:&nbsp;'What was the biggest new feature announcement for Bedrock Agents during reinvent 2024?'</code><code>A:&nbsp;'During re:Invent 2024, one of the headline new feature announcements for Bedrock Agents was the custom orchestrator. This key feature allows users to implement their own orchestration strategies through AWS Lambda functions, providing granular control over task planning, completion, and verification while enabling real-time adjustments and reusability across multiple agents.'</code></p><p>You then format these pairs as individual text files with corresponding <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/kb-metadata.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">metadata JSON files</a>, upload them to an S3 bucket, and ingest them into your cache knowledge base. This process makes sure that your semantic cache is populated with accurate, curated, and verified information that can be quickly retrieved to answer user queries or guide the agent’s responses.</p><h3>Step 4: Implement the verified semantic cache logic</h3><p>In this step, you implement the core logic of your verified semantic cache solution. You create a function that integrates the semantic cache with your Amazon Bedrock agent, enhancing its ability to provide accurate and consistent responses.</p><ol><li>Queries the cache knowledge base for similar entries to the user question.</li><li>If a high similarity match is found (greater than 80%), it returns the cached answer directly.</li><li>For partial matches (60–80%), it uses the cached answer as a few-shot example for the agent.</li><li>For low similarity (less than 60%), it falls back to standard agent processing.</li></ol><p>This simplified logic forms the core of the semantic caching solution, efficiently using curated&nbsp;and&nbsp;verified information to improve response accuracy and reduce unnecessary LLM invocations.</p><h3>Step 5: Evaluate results and performance</h3><p>This step demonstrates the effectiveness of the verified semantic cache&nbsp;solution by testing it with different scenarios and comparing the results and latency. You’ll use three test cases to showcase the&nbsp;solution’s behavior:</p><ol><li>Strong semantic match (greater than 80% similarity)</li><li>Partial semantic match (60-80% similarity)</li><li>No semantic match (less than 60% similarity)</li></ol><ol><li>Strong semantic match (greater than 80% similarity) provides the exact curated and verified answer in less than 1 second. \n  <div><pre><code>%%time\ninvoke_agent_with_verified_cache(\"What were some new features announced for Bedrock Agents during reinvent 2024?\")\n\n# Output:\n# Cache semantic similarity log: Strong match with score 0.9176399\n# CPU times: user 20.7 ms, sys: 442 μs, total: 21.1 ms\n# Wall time: 440 ms\n\n# During re:Invent 2024, one of the headline new feature announcements for Bedrock \n# Agents was the custom orchestrator.

The Amazon Bedrock agent answers the question correctly using the cached answer even though the information is not present in the agent knowledge base. \n  <div><pre><code>%%time\ninvoke_agent_with_verified_cache(\"What are the newest features for Bedrock Agents?\") \n\n# Output:\n# Cache semantic similarity log: Partial match with score 0.6443664\n# CPU times: user 10.4 ms, sys: 0 ns, total: 10.4 ms\n# Wall time: 12.8 s\n\n# One of the newest and most significant features for Amazon Bedrock Agents \n# announced during re:Invent 2024 was the custom orchestrator.

It enables real-time adjustments and reusability across \n# multiple agents, enhancing the flexibility and power of Bedrock Agents.</code></pre></div></li><li>No semantic match (less than 60% similarity) invokes the Amazon Bedrock agent as usual. For this query, the LLM will either refuse to provide the information because it’s not present in the agent’s knowledge base, or will hallucinate and provide a response that is plausible but incorrect. \n  <div><pre><code>%%time\ninvoke_agent_with_verified_cache(\"Tell me about a new feature for Amazon Bedrock Agents\")\n\n# Output:\n# Cache semantic similarity log: No match with score 0.532105\n# CPU times: user 22.3 ms, sys: 579 μs, total: 22.9 ms\n# Wall time: 13.6 s\n\n# Amazon Bedrock is a service that provides secure and scalable compute capacity \n# for running applications on AWS. As for new features for the Bedrock Agents \n# component, I do not have any specific information on recent or upcoming new \n# features.

Without \n# being able to consult the Knowledge Base, I cannot provide details on any \n# particular new Bedrock Agent features at this time.</code></pre></div></li></ol><p>These results demonstrate the effectiveness of the semantic caching solution:</p><ol><li>Strong matches provide near-instant, accurate, and deterministic responses without invoking an LLM.</li><li>Partial matches guide the LLM agent to provide a more relevant or accurate answer.</li><li>No matches fall back to standard LLM agent processing, maintaining flexibility.</li></ol><p>The semantic cache significantly reduces latency for known questions and improves accuracy for similar queries, while still allowing the agent to handle unique questions when necessary.</p><h3>Step 6: Resource clean up</h3><p>Make sure that the Amazon Bedrock knowledge bases that you created, along with the underlying Amazon OpenSearch Serverless collections are deleted to avoid incurring unnecessary costs.</p><h2>Production readiness considerations</h2><p>Before deploying this&nbsp;solution in production, address these key considerations:</p><ol><li><strong>Similarity threshold optimization:</strong>&nbsp;Experiment with different thresholds to balance cache hit rates and accuracy. This directly impacts the solution’s effectiveness in preventing hallucinations while maintaining relevance.</li><li><strong>Feedback loop implementation:</strong>&nbsp;Create a mechanism to continuously update the verified cache with new, accurate responses. This helps prevent cache staleness and maintains the solution’s integrity as a source of truth for the LLM.</li><li><strong>Cache management and update strategy:</strong>&nbsp;Regularly refresh the semantic cache with current, frequently asked questions to maintain relevance and improve hit rates. Implement a systematic process for reviewing, validating, and incorporating new entries to help ensure cache quality and alignment with evolving user needs.</li><li>&nbsp;Adjust similarity thresholds as your dataset evolves. Treat the semantic cache as a dynamic component, requiring continuous optimization for your specific use case.</li></ol><p>This verified semantic cache approach offers a powerful solution to reduce hallucinations in LLM responses while improving latency and reducing costs. By using Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases, you can implement a&nbsp;solution that can efficiently serve curated&nbsp;and&nbsp;verified answers, guide LLM responses with few-shot examples, and gracefully fall back to full LLM processing when needed.</p><p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/f1f836cb4ea6efb2a0b1b99f41ad8b103eff4b59/2025/02/12/dtoprani-author-photo.jpeg\" alt=\"Dheer Toprani (author photo)\" width=\"100\" height=\"150\"> is a System Development Engineer within the Amazon Worldwide Returns and ReCommerce Data Services team.

It is a continuous process to keep the fine-tuned model accurate and effective in changing environments, to adapt to the data distribution shift (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concept_drift\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">concept drift</a>) and prevent performance degradation over time. Continuous fine-tuning also enables models to integrate human feedback, address errors, and tailor to real-world applications. You can use <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/jumpstart-foundation-models-fine-tuning.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">supervised fine-tuning (SFT)</a> and <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.10792v5\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">instruction tuning</a> to train the LLM to perform better on specific tasks using human-annotated datasets and instructions.

Also, the continuous fine-tuning process requires orchestrating the multiple steps of data generation, LLM training, feedback collection, and preference alignments with scalability, resiliency, and resource efficiency. To address these challenges, we present an innovative continuous self-instruct fine-tuning framework that streamlines the LLM fine-tuning process of training data generation and annotation, model training and evaluation, human feedback collection, and alignment with human preference. This framework is designed as a <a href=\"https://bair.berkeley.edu/blog/2024/02/18/compound-ai-systems/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">compound AI system</a> to drive the fine-tuning workflow for performance improvement, versatility, and reusability.</p><p>In this post, we introduce the continuous self-instruct fine-tuning framework and its pipeline, and present how to drive the continuous fine-tuning process for a question-answer task as a compound AI system. We use <a href=\"https://dspy.ai/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">DSPy</a> (Declarative Self-improving Python) to demonstrate the workflow of <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/retrieval-augmented-generation/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Retrieval Augmented Generation</a> (RAG) optimization, LLM fine-tuning and evaluation, and human preference alignment for performance improvement.</p><h2>Overview of the continuous self-instruct fine-tuning framework</h2><p>The continuous self-instruct fine-tuning framework drives a workflow to customize the foundation model (FM) using human-labeled training samples and human feedback after model inference. This workflow runs on a continuous basis to be adaptive to a changing environment. The following diagram illustrates the workflow.</p><p>The workflow consists of the following steps:</p><ol><li><strong>Self-instruct supervised fine-tuning</strong> – First, we use a human-labeled training dataset to adapt the FM to tasks in a specific domain. Instruction tuning is a popular approach in domain-specific LLM fine-tuning, which trains the FM to follow instructions for a specific task rather than generating the next texts. To address the challenges of the lack of human efforts for data labeling, annotation, and validation, we designed a self-instruct fine-tuning method to synthetically generate training labels by the LLM from a small volume of high-quality human-annotated samples. This process scales up the training dataset used for fine-tuning the FM into a custom LLM.</li><li><strong>Human preference alignment </strong>– After the model is deployed in the production environment, the process moves into the human-in-the-loop workflow, in which we collect user feedback including satisfaction scores and comments on model response. The human feedback data is not only used for model performance and hallucination measurement, but is also used to further fine-tune the custom model in Step 1 through RLHF. Likewise, to address the challenges of lack of human feedback data, we use LLMs to generate AI grades and feedback that scale up the dataset for reinforcement learning from AI feedback (<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.00267\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">RLAIF</a>). There are various techniques of preference alignment, including <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.06347\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">proximal policy optimization</a> (PPO), <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.18290\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">direct preference optimization</a> (DPO), <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/html/2403.07691v2\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">odds ratio policy optimization</a> (ORPO), <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.03300\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">group relative policy optimization</a> (GRPO), and other algorithms, that can be used in this process.</li><li><strong>Evaluation and continuous learning </strong>– The model customization and preference alignment is not a one-time effort. We need to keep monitoring and evaluating the model performance, and restart the process in case of concept shift or model decay.</li></ol><p>The overall workflow consists of multiple steps of synthetic data generation, LLM training, feedback collection, preference alignment, and evaluation that involves multiple components and multiple LLMs. In the next section, we discuss using a compound AI system to implement this framework to achieve high versatility and reusability.</p><h2>Compound AI system and the DSPy framework</h2><p>With the rise of generative AI, scientists and engineers face a much more complex scenario to develop and maintain AI solutions, compared to classic predictive AI. The paper <a href=\"https://bair.berkeley.edu/blog/2024/02/18/compound-ai-systems/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">The Shift from Models to Compound AI Systems</a> highlights that state-of-the-art AI results are increasingly obtained by compound systems with multiple components, not just monolithic models. Compound AI systems are systems that implement AI tasks by combining multiple interacting components. These components can include multiple calls to models, retrievers, or external tools. The following diagram compares predictive AI to generative AI.</p><p>The concept of a compound AI system enables data scientists and ML engineers to design sophisticated generative AI systems consisting of multiple models and components. You can use a module to incorporate prompt engineering and in-context learning to improve RAG performance, and also design a data architecture with tools to gather external data. You can also build an agentic architecture with multiple LLMs, fine-tune the model to achieve higher performance, and orchestrate the LLM access. Besides the efficiency in system design, the compound AI system also enables you to optimize complex generative AI systems, using a comprehensive evaluation module based on multiple metrics, benchmarking data, and even judgements from other LLMs. The optimization is on the holistic end-to-end solution, rather than on each component separately.</p><p>To efficiently build and optimize compound AI systems, we introduce DSPy, an open source Python framework for developers to build LLM applications using modular and declarative programming, whether you’re building simple classifiers, sophisticated RAG pipelines, or agentic workflows. It provides algorithms for optimizing LLMs’ prompts and weights, and automates the prompt tuning process, as opposed to the trial-and-error approach performed by humans. DSPy supports iteratively optimizing all prompts involved against defined metrics for the end-to-end compound AI solution.</p><p>The DSPy lifecycle is presented in the following diagram in seven steps. It separates the flow of your program (modules) from the parameters (language model prompts and weights) of each step. These modules define the system behavior in a portable, declarative way. The first four steps cover the DSPy programming stage, including defining your task and its constraints, exploring a few examples, and using that to inform your initial pipeline design. When your system works reasonably well, you can run the DSPy evaluation stage (Steps 5 and 6) to collect an initial development set, define your DSPy metric, and use these to iterate on your system more systematically. Afterwards, DSPy introduces new optimizers (compilers) in Step 7, with language model-driven algorithms to tune LLM prompts and weights, based on predefined evaluation metrics.</p><h2>RAG pipeline with continuous fine-tuning in a compound AI system</h2><p>In this post, we provide an example of a question-answer task, using a RAG pipeline along with the continuous self-instruct fine-tuning framework. We build this as a compound AI system and use DSPy to drive the RAG inference, prompt optimization, LLM fine-tuning, and performance evaluation. The overall workflow is shown in the following diagram.</p><p>The flow starts from a standard RAG pipeline, followed by a few optimizations on the prompts and the RAG retriever. Then we generate the synthetic training dataset from the RAG knowledge base to fine-tune the generator LLM using RAG for performance improvement. Lastly, we use a separate LLM to generate feedback on the fine-tuned model responses, and use it to conduct the preference alignment training by DPO and PPO. The question-answer outputs from each step are measured by the underlying LLM-as-a-judge evaluation module. In this way, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the compound AI system for the continuous optimizing of the pipeline through RAG optimization and the fine-tuning framework.</p><p>In the next sections, we demonstrate how to build this workflow, including the RAG pipeline, optimization, instruction fine-tuning, preference alignment, and model evaluation, into a compound AI system using an <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Amazon SageMaker</a> notebook instance with the DSPy framework and LLMs on <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Amazon Bedrock</a>.

The generated datasets are in the format of question-answer pairs along with the context <code>[context, question, answer]</code> from the document. We use the question to infer the RAG pipeline and use the answer as ground truth to evaluate the inference accuracy. Additionally, the question-answer pairs are used as training samples for the model fine-tuning. The following is a sample dataset triplet with context and a question-answer pair.</p><table border=\"1px\" width=\"623\" cellpadding=\"10px\"><tbody><tr><td width=\"432\"></td></tr><tr><td width=\"432\"><p>THIS STRATEGIC ALLIANCE AGREEMENT (“Agreement”) is made and entered into as of November 6, 2016 (the “Effective Date”) by</p><p>and between Dialog Semiconductor (UK) Ltd., a corporation organized under the laws of England and Wales, having its principal office at 100</p><p>Longwater Avenue, Green Park, Reading, RG2 6GP, United Kingdom (“DIALOG”) and Energous Corporation, a Delaware corporation, having its</p><p>principal office at 3590 North First Street, Suite 210, San Jose, CA 95134 (“ENERGOUS”)</p></td><td width=\"96\">What is the date of the contract?</td></tr></tbody></table><p>We implement a standard <a href=\"https://github.com/aws-samples/amlc-2024-tutorial-continuous-fine-tuning-compound-ai/blob/main/notebook/dspy_rag.ipynb\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">RAG pipeline with DSPy</a> using the following components to create the vector database, set up context retrieval, and generate the answer:</p><ol><li>Configure DSPy to use LLMs on Amazon Bedrock as the RAG generator model:</li></ol><div><pre><code>dsp_bedrock = dspy.Bedrock(region_name='us-west-2')\nclaude_sonnet_model_id = \"anthropic.claude-3-sonnet-20240229-v1:0\"\nbedrock_sonnet = dspy.AWSAnthropic(aws_provider=dsp_bedrock,\n                                   model=claude_sonnet_model_id,\n                                   max_new_tokens=4096,\n                                   max_tokens=4096)</code></pre></div><ol start=\"2\"><li>Process the dataset to generate logical and syntactically readable chunks.

DSPy provides the Optimizer module, an algorithm that can tune the parameters of a DSPy program (the prompts and language model weights) to maximize the metrics you specify. It takes in a training set to bootstrap the selective training examples, and is based on a metric function that measures proximity to or matches against the ground truth. With these, we can compile the RAG pipeline module with a defined optimizer instance to conduct the optimization.</p><p>In this post, we use DSPy Optimizer to learn how to generate the prompt to improve the RAG response accuracy. Because our dataset size is low (fewer than 100 examples), we select the <a href=\"https://dspy.ai/deep-dive/optimizers/bootstrap-fewshot/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">BootstrapFewShot</a> teleprompter to compile the RAG prompts and overall pipeline, and use the synthetic dataset with ground truth and the LLM-as-a-judge metric function we defined in the previous sections:</p><div><pre><code>def validate_context_and_answer(example, pred, trace=None):\n   answer_EM = dspy.evaluate.answer_exact_match(example, pred)\n   answer_PM = dspy.evaluate.answer_passage_match(example, pred)\n   answer_LLMJudge = factuality_metric(example, pred)\n   return answer_LLMJudge or answer_EM or answer_PM\n\nrag_lm = RAG()\nteleprompter = BootstrapFewShot(metric=validate_context_and_answer)\ncompiled_rag = teleprompter.compile(rag_lm, trainset=trainset)</code></pre></div><p>The context retrieval is crucial to the overall RAG accuracy. To evaluate the RAG optimization we’ve described, we create a retriever evaluation by the LLM-as-a-judge to understand how well the retriever is able to pull out the relevant chunks for the incoming user question. The LLM judge is defined in the RetrievalJudge class:</p><div><pre><code>class RetrievalJudge(dspy.Signature):\n   \"\"\"Judge given the question to be answered, check if the groundtruth answer can be derived from the predicted context.&nbsp; Answer either Retrieved[True] or Retrieved[False]\"\"\"\n   context = dspy.InputField(desc=\"Context for the prediction\")\n   question = dspy.InputField(desc=\"Question to be answered\")\n   groundtruth_answer = dspy.InputField(desc=\"groundtruth answer for the question\")\n   retrieval_correctness = dspy.OutputField(desc=\"Can the groundtruth answer be derived from the predicted context?\", prefix=\"Retrieved[True/False]:\")\n\nretrieval_judge = dspy.ChainOfThought(RetrievalJudge)</code></pre></div><p>Then we define the metric to measure the retrieval by using the RetrievalJudge, and use the DSPy Evaluate module to generate the accuracy score for retrieval:</p><div><pre><code>def retrieval_metric(example, pred):\n   retrieval = retrieval_judge(question=example.question, groundtruth_answer=example.answer, context=pred.context)\n   llm_retriever_ans = bool(\"Retrieved[True]\" in retrieval.retrieval_correctness\n                            or '100% True' in retrieval.retrieval_correctness\n                            or '100% retrieved correct' in retrieval.retrieval_correctness\n                            or 'True.' in retrieval.retrieval_correctness)\n   return llm_retriever_ans\n\nrag_retrieval_score = Evaluate(compiled_rag, num_threads = 1, metric=retrieval_metric)</code></pre></div><h3>Configure the continuous fine-tuning framework</h3><p>After the RAG optimization, the compound AI system has the instruction tuning and preference alignment modules, driven by the continuous fine-tuning framework. This includes using the synthetically generated dataset to train the LLM to follow question-answer instructions by SFT, and generating feedback of RAG responses by AI (another LLM) used for RLAIF with PPO and preference alignment with DPO and ORPO. In this step, we use <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.16742\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Parameter Efficient Fine-Tuning</a> (PEFT) with <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.09685\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Low-Rank Adaptation</a> (LoRA) to reduce the requirement of compute resources and accelerate the training process.</p><p>At the time of writing, the DSPy Optimization module supports distillation of a prompt-based DSPy program into LLM weight updates using BootstrapFinetune, and does not yet support the fine-tuning methods we defined in the compound AI system. Therefore, we conducted the fine-tuning (instruction tuning and preference alignment) on a Meta Llama 3 8B model separately; refer to the following <a href=\"https://github.com/aws-samples/kdd-2024-domain-driven-llm-development\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">GitHub repository</a> for more details. With the compound AI system design, we are able to take the fine-tuning results back into the DSPy pipeline, use the LLM-as-a-judge evaluation function to generate the accuracy scores, and benchmark with the standard and optimized RAG inferences. This demonstrates the flexibility and interoperability of the compound AI system, which allows us to seamlessly replace one module with an external component without requiring changes to the entire pipeline.</p><p>The following diagram illustrates the workflow.</p><h3>Define an evaluation approach with DSPy</h3><p>DSPy provides an Evaluate module for evaluating the compound AI system output by using user-defined metrics. In this post, we use LLM-as-a-judge to evaluate the system output and create the corresponding metrics for benchmarking the accuracy of standard RAG, optimized RAG, and fine-tuned models. Complete the following steps:</p><ol><li>Load the dataset for evaluation in the Example data type. Examples are similar to Python dictionaries but with added utilities such as the dspy.Prediction as a return value. For example:</li></ol><div><pre><code>gt_answer = &lt;ground truth of the answer&gt;\npred_answer = &lt;answer from RAG and/or fine-tuned model&gt;\ndspy_data = dspy.Example(gt_answer=gt_answer, pred_answer=pred_answer).with_inputs(\"gt_answer\", \"pred_answer\")</code></pre></div><ol start=\"2\"><li>Define the LLM-as-a-judge class to adjudicate whether the predicted answer semantically matches the ground truth of the answer. For example, the following FactualityJudge_1 class provides a score between 0 and 1; 0 means a complete mismatch and 1 means a perfect match.</li></ol><div><pre><code>class FactualityJudge_1(dspy.Signature):\n   \"\"\"Judge if the predicted answer is semantically match the groundtruth answer. Provide a score between 0 and 1, 0 means completely mismatch and 1 means perfectly match. In the response, only present the score, DO NOT add any preambles.\"\"\"\n   groundtruth_answer = dspy.InputField(desc=\"groundtruth answer\")\n   predicted_answer = dspy.InputField(desc=\"predicted answer\")\n   factually_correct = dspy.OutputField(desc=\"Is the predicted answer factually correct and semantically similar to the groundtruth answer?\"))</code></pre></div><ol start=\"3\"><li>Define the evaluation metrics from the LLM judge, using DSPy metrics, to mark whether the predicted answer is true or not. For example, the following function returns the accuracy score based on the output of FactualityJudge_1:</li></ol><div><pre><code>factualityJudge_1 = dspy.ChainOfThought(FactualityJudge_1)\n\ndef factuality_metric_1(gt_answer, pred_answer):\n   pred_answer = gt_answer.pred_answer\n   gt_answer = gt_answer.gt_answer\n   factual_metrc = factualityJudge_1(groundtruth_answer=gt_answer, predicted_answer=pred_answer)\n   llm_judge_ans = float(factual_metrc[0].factually_correct)\n   print(f\"llm_judge_ans = {llm_judge_ans}\")\n   return llm_judge_ans\n\nmetric_LLM_1 = factuality_metric_1</code></pre></div><ol start=\"4\"><li>Use the  module to generate an accuracy score using the LLM-as-a-judge metrics defined in the previous step:</li></ol><div><pre><code>evaluate_llm_judge = Evaluate(devset= dspy_data, metric=metric_LLM_1, num_threads=1)</code></pre></div><p>This evaluation process should be conducted on a continuous basis in the compound AI system driven by self-instruct fine-tuning, to make sure the overall performance remains stable despite the changes in the environment or the introduction of new data.</p><h3>Benchmark RAG and LLM fine-tuning with DSPy</h3><p>We benchmark the approaches presented in this post using the <a href=\"https://github.com/aws-samples/amlc-2024-tutorial-continuous-fine-tuning-compound-ai/blob/main/notebook/dspy_rag_ft.ipynb\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">LLM-as-a-judge evaluation</a> function defined in the previous section with the following settings.</p><p>The benchmarking is across five methods: standard RAG, optimized RAG, fine-tuning LLMs by instruction tuning, and fine-tuning LLMs by DPO and ORPO trained LLMs based on AIF. For each method, the LLM judge provides a decimal accuracy score in the range of 0 and 1.</p><p>The standard RAG uses Amazon Titan Text Embedding V2 for the embedding model, and Anthropic’s Claude 3 Haiku model for the generator model. The RAG compilation uses 32 question-answer pairs to optimize the prompts. The same dataset is used for inference. The fine-tuning by SFT, DPO, and ORPO are performed on the Meta Llama 3 8B FM, using training samples synthetically generated from CUAD document.</p><p>The results are presented in the following tables and charts. The different methods demonstrate different levels of improvement. The improvement is calculated in percentage by (accuracy of new method – accuracy of standard RAG)/(accuracy of standard RAG)*100%.</p><p>The optimized RAG by DSPy improved the accuracy and reduced the hallucination.</p><table border=\"1px\" width=\"696\" cellpadding=\"10px\"><tbody><tr><td width=\"162\"></td><td width=\"210\"></td></tr><tr><td width=\"162\">Accuracy by LLM Judge (0-1)</td></tr></tbody></table><table border=\"1\" width=\"696\" cellpadding=\"10px\"><tbody><tr><td width=\"162\"></td><td width=\"210\"></td></tr><tr><td width=\"162\">Accuracy by LLM Judge (0-1)</td></tr></tbody></table><p>The custom LLM trained by SFT yielded higher accuracy than the standard RAG.</p><table border=\"1\" width=\"696\" cellpadding=\"10\"><tbody><tr><td width=\"162\"></td><td width=\"192\"></td></tr><tr><td width=\"162\">Accuracy by LLM Judge (0-1)</td></tr></tbody></table><table border=\"1\" width=\"696\" cellpadding=\"10\"><tbody><tr><td width=\"162\"></td><td width=\"192\"></td></tr><tr><td width=\"162\">Accuracy by LLM Judge (0-1)</td></tr></tbody></table><p>The custom LLM through preference alignment from human and AI feedback (DPO and ORPO) further improved the model performance.

The framework first generates a synthetic dataset from the domain knowledge base and documents for self-instruction, then drives model fine-tuning through SFT, and introduces the human-in-the-loop workflow to collect human and AI feedback to the model response, which is used to further improve the model performance by aligning human preference through reinforcement learning (RLHF/RLAIF).</p><p>We demonstrated the framework for a question-answer task with a RAG pipeline, which improved the end-to-end response accuracy. The workflow is implemented by the DSPy framework; the overall strategy is to use the  to connect all the components (RAG pipeline, prompt optimization, LLMs fine-tuned by SFT and RLHF/RLAIF, performance evaluation) together into a compound AI system. Each module can be seamlessly maintained, updated, and replaced without affecting other components in the system. This robust and versatile system design strengthens control and trust through modular design, and increases flexibility and adaptability to changing environments and data sources.</p><p>You can implement this continuous fine-tuning framework for LLM performance improvement for your own business use cases, with a compound AI system that provides high flexibility and interoperability.

It provides immediate, relevant information while streamlining tasks and accelerating problem-solving.</p><p><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/fsx/windows/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Amazon FSx for Windows File Server</a> is a fully managed Windows file system that provides high-performance file storage for Windows-based applications. You can use Amazon FSx to lift and shift your on-premises Windows file server workloads to the cloud, taking advantage of the scalability, durability, and cost-effectiveness of AWS while maintaining full compatibility with your existing Windows applications and tooling.</p><p>Amazon Q Business is designed to be secure and private, seamlessly integrating with your existing identity provider (IdP). It works directly with your identities, roles, and permission sets, making sure users can’t access data they are not authorized to. Additionally, Amazon Q Business seamlessly integrates with <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonq/latest/qbusiness-ug/connectors-list.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">multiple enterprise data stores</a>, including FSx for Windows File Server, enabling you to index documents from file server systems and perform tasks such as summarization, Q&amp;A, or data analysis of large numbers of files effortlessly.</p><p>In this post, we demonstrate how to use the Amazon Q connector for FSx for Windows File Server, explore a practical use case, and provide step-by-step instructions to help you get started and gain insights out of your data stored in FSx for Windows File Server.</p><h2>Overview of the Amazon Q data source connector</h2><p>A data source connector is a mechanism for integrating and synchronizing data from multiple repositories, including Microsoft SharePoint, Salesforce, <a href=\"http://aws.amazon.com/s3\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Amazon Simple Storage Service</a> (Amazon S3) buckets, and even your internal FSx for Windows File Server into one container index. Amazon Q Business offers multiple data source connectors that can connect to your data sources and help you create your generative AI solution with minimal configuration. For a list of supported connectors, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonq/latest/qbusiness-ug/connectors-list.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Supported connectors</a>.</p><p>Amazon Q boasts impressive versatility, supporting a wide range of <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonq/latest/qbusiness-ug/doc-types.html#doc-types-supported\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">document types</a> stored at various places in your environment, including Windows Share (FSX for Windows File Server). Amazon Q can ingest and understand common formats like plaintext, PDF, HTML, XML, and JSON to Microsoft formats like Excel, Word, and PowerPoint. This provides a comprehensive search experience for your enterprise users.</p><h3>Secure access with supported authentication types</h3><p>Security is job zero at AWS, and Amazon Q has been built keeping that in mind. It supports a variety of authentication types, seamlessly integrating with your existing identity management systems. Whether you use single sign-on (SSO) or a custom authentication solution, Amazon Q can adapt to your specific needs.</p><h3>Fine-grained control with ACLs and identity crawling</h3><p>For organizations with highly sensitive data, Amazon Q offers an extra layer of security. Amazon Q Business supports crawling <a href=\"https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Access-control_list\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">access control lists (ACLs)</a> for document security by default. When you connect an Amazon FSx (Windows) data source to Amazon Q Business, it crawls ACL information attached to a document (user and group information) from the directory service of the Amazon FSx instance.</p><p>The following diagram shows a high-level architecture of how <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/directoryservice/latest/admin-guide/directory_microsoft_ad.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">AWS Managed Active Directory</a> users, through <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/iam/identity-center/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">AWS IAM Identity Center</a>, can access and interact with an Amazon Q Business application. This enables an authenticated user to securely and privately interact with the application and gain insights from the enterprise data stored in FSx for Windows File Server, using the Amazon Q Business web experience from their web browser.</p><p>In this post, we walk you through the process of integrating Amazon Q Business with FSx for Windows File Server to extract meaningful insights from your file system using natural language processing (NLP).

We'll find out by the end of this article.</p><p>According to the official benchmarks shared by the xAI team at the launch event, Grok 3 appears to be a game-changer, outperforming all its competitors in almost every benchmark.</p><blockquote><p>I've used <a href=\"https://lmarena.ai\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Chatbot Arena</a> to test both of these models side by side, as it is the only available and trusted third-party site that allows testing the early Grok 3 model.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>ℹ️ Here, we will check the reasoning capabilities of both the models.</p></blockquote><p>Let's start up the show with an interesting question:</p><blockquote><p>You are playing Russian roulette with a six-shooter revolver. Your opponent puts in five bullets, spins the chambers and fires at himself, but no bullet comes out. He gives you the choice of whether or not he should spin the chambers again before firing at you. Should he spin again?</p></blockquote><ul><li><strong>Response from DeepSeek R1</strong>:</li></ul><blockquote><p>: Both of the models answered the problem correctly with correct reasoning. ✅</p></blockquote><p><strong>2. Olympic Athlete Siblings</strong></p><blockquote><p>I am the sister of two Olympic athletes. But these two athletes are not my sisters. How is this possible?</p></blockquote><ul><li><strong>Response from DeepSeek R1</strong>:</li></ul><blockquote><p>: Here as well, both the models answered the problem correctly with correct reasoning. ✅</p></blockquote><p>The first two questions were straightforward. Let's conclude the reasoning test with a slightly trickier question:</p><blockquote><p>You meet three people: Haris, Antony, and Michael. Haris says, \"At least one of us is a liar.\" Antony says, \"Haris is lying.\" Michael says, \"Antony is telling the truth.\" Determine who is lying and who is telling the truth.</p></blockquote><p>Here, Grok 3 provided thorough reasoning, considering each case and breaking down the problem step by step to support its conclusion.</p><ul><li><strong>Response from DeepSeek R1</strong>:</li></ul><blockquote><p>: Both models answered the problem correctly ✅, but the reasoning of the Grok 3 model stands out to me.</p></blockquote><p>From this, we can see that both models are quite strong in reasoning capabilities, as they both provided correct answers to all my reasoning questions. Still, the reasoning capability of the Grok 3 model seems to outperform R1 at times.</p><blockquote><p>💁 Looking at the reasoning question answers from both models, I was convinced that both of these models should also pass the math questions.</p></blockquote><p>Starting with an easy question, let's see how they perform:</p><p><strong>1. Number of people in the train</strong></p><blockquote><p>There were some people on a train. 19 people get off the train at the first stop. 17 people get on the train. Now there are 63 people on the train. How many people were on the train to begin with?</p></blockquote><ul><li><strong>Response from DeepSeek R1</strong>:</li></ul><blockquote><p>: Both models chose a similar approach and ended up with the correct answer. ✅</p></blockquote><p><strong>2. Prime Number Theorem Approximation</strong></p><blockquote><p>Estimate the number of prime numbers less than 10^8.</p></blockquote><ul><li><strong>Response from DeepSeek R1</strong>:</li></ul><blockquote><p>: Both models chose the correct approach of using the Prime Number Theorem, but the answer from the DeepSeek R1 model was off by around ~1K, while Grok 3 was off by around ~20K. So, it's fair to say DeepSeek R1 ✅ outperformed Grok 3 ❌ here.</p></blockquote><p><strong>3. Count vowels and exponentiate</strong></p><p>This is definitely the toughest problem for the models to crack. It is a somewhat modified version of a very famous question for LLMs with a math twist: <strong>\"Calculate the number of r's in strawberry.\"</strong></p><blockquote><p>Calculate (x - 14)^10 where x is the number of vowels in the answer.</p></blockquote><div><pre><code>To solve the problem, we need to compute ((x - 14)^{10}), where (x) is the number of vowels in the answer. This is a self-referential problem, so we need to find a value of the answer such that the number of vowels in the answer matches the (x) used in the expression.\n\n Let (y = (x - 14)^{10}), where (x) is the number of vowels in (y).\n Vowels are the letters \"a,\" \"e,\" \"i,\" \"o,\" \"u\" (we'll consider only lowercase for simplicity, unless otherwise specified).\n We need to find a (y) such that the number of vowels in (y) equals (x), and (y = (x - 14)^{10}).\n\n\nSince (x) is the number of vowels, and vowels are non-negative integers, (x geq 0). However, for ((x - 14)^{10}) to be meaningful, (x) should be such that the expression produces a number whose vowel count matches (x).\n\nLet's try different values of (x) and compute (y), then check the number of vowels in (y).\n\n(y = (16 - 14)^{10} = 2^{10} = 1024).\n Write (y) in words: \"one thousand twenty-four.\"\n Count vowels in \"one thousand twenty-four\":\n o (1), e (1), o (2), u (1), a (1), o (2) → 6 vowels.\n(x = 16), but the number of vowels in (y) is 6, so (16 neq 6). This doesn't work.\n\n(y = (18 - 14)^{10} = 4^{10}).\n(4^5 = 1024), so (4^{10} = (4^5)^2 = 1024^2).\n(1024^2 = 1,048,576).\n Write (y) in words: \"one million forty-eight thousand five hundred seventy-six.\"\n Count vowels:\n o (1), e (1), i (1), i (2), o (2), a (1), o (3), u (1), a (2), e (2), u (2), e (3), i (3) → 13 vowels.\n(x = 18), but the number of vowels in (y) is 13, so (18 neq 13). This doesn't work.\n\n(y = (15 - 14)^{10} = 1^{10} = 1).\n Write (y) in words: \"one.\"\n Count vowels in \"one\": n → 2 vowels.\n(x = 15), but the number of vowels in (y) is 2, so (15 neq 2). This doesn't work.\n\n(y = (17 - 14)^{10} = 3^{10}).\n(3^5 = 243), so (3^{10} = (3^5)^2 = 243^2).\n(243^2 = 59,049).\n Write (y) in words: \"fifty-nine thousand forty-nine.\"\n Count vowels:\n i (1), i (2), e (1), o (1), u (1), a (1), i (3), e (2) → 8 vowels.\n(x = 17), but the number of vowels in (y) is 8, so (17 neq 8). This doesn't work.\n\n\nLet's summarize the results so far:\n(x = 14), (y = 0), vowels = 2.\n(x = 15), (y = 1), vowels = 2.\n(x = 16), (y = 1024), vowels = 6.\n(x = 17), (y = 59,049), vowels = 8.\n(x = 18), (y = 1,048,576), vowels = 13.\n\nIt seems that as (x) increases, (y) grows exponentially (since it's (x - 14) raised to the 10th power), and the number of vowels in (y) also increases, but not necessarily matching (x).\n\n\nLet's try (x) closer to 14 but with a focus on smaller vowel counts.\n\n(y = (12 - 14)^{10} = (-2)^{10} = 1024).\n Write (y) in words: \"one thousand twenty-four.\"\n Count vowels: 6 vowels (as calculated earlier).\n(x = 12), but the number of vowels in (y) is 6, so (12 neq 6). This doesn't work.\n\n\nWe need to find an (x) such that the number of vowels in ((x - 14)^{10}) equals (x). Let's try (x = 2) (since we saw small vowel counts earlier).\n\n(y = (2 - 14)^{10} = (-12)^{10}).\n((-12)^{10} = 12^{10}) (since 10 is even).\n(12^5 = 248,832), so (12^{10} = (12^5)^2 = 248,832^2).\n(248,832^2 = 61,917,364,224).\n Write (y) in words: \"sixty-one billion nine hundred seventeen million three hundred sixty-four thousand two hundred twenty-four.\"\n Count vowels:\n i (1), o (1), e (1), i (2), i (3), o (2), e (2), e (3), i (4), o (3), o (4), u (1), a (1), o (5), e (4), o (6) → 16 vowels.\n(x = 2), but the number of vowels in (y) is 16, so (2 neq 16). This doesn't work.\n\n\nAfter trying multiple values of (x), we observe that the number of vowels in (y = (x - 14)^{10}) does not consistently match (x). The problem may not have a solution where the number of vowels in the result exactly equals (x), or it may require a specific (x) that we haven't found yet.\n\nGiven the complexity and the lack of a clear fixed point, it seems likely that the problem might not have a solution within the constraints, or the solution requires a more advanced approach (e.g., considering different number naming conventions or constraints on (x)).\n\nIf we must provide an answer, we note that no (x) tried so far satisfies the condition. Further exploration or clarification (e.g., constraints on (x), naming conventions) may be needed.\n</code></pre></div><ul><li><strong>Response from DeepSeek R1</strong>:</li></ul><blockquote><p>: As expected, neither of the models could reach the solution. ❌</p></blockquote><p>This question seems to have been cracked by  model, though.</p><p>\n\n  // Detect dark theme\n  var iframe = document.getElementById('tweet-1865090104441672183-365');\n  if (document.body.className.includes('dark-theme')) {\n    iframe.src = \"https://platform.twitter.com/embed/Tweet.html?id=1865090104441672183&amp;theme=dark\"\n  }\n\n\n\n</p><p>As for math, both models performed quite well on the first two questions, which were easier, but both failed to solve a tricky question that required a bit of thought ❌.

This is a huge threat to all humanity and must be stopped.</p><p>To understand the solution, we must understand the problem. Big tech companies leverage data they mined over decades on the internet either directly or indirectly to build their LLM models. Then, what they do is that they try to customize it in certain contexts to make it usable by military. However, this task does require probably a bit of effort on their end depending on the data collected.

If you’re in that camp, you need to understand what you’re missing and why the time has come to embrace the cloud.</p><p>The public cloud hosting market provides a variety of deployment models that address the needs of businesses of all sizes and industries. One of the biggest advantages is the ability to leverage cloud-based automation testing, which ensures that applications perform seamlessly across different environments without requiring extensive infrastructure. Additionally, <a href=\"https://testgrid.io/blog/ai-in-software-testing/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">AI for software testing</a> is revolutionizing quality assurance by making testing more intelligent, adaptive, and efficient.</p><p>In this article, we will examine the advantages of public cloud and how it supports modern testing strategies like automation and AI-driven testing to enhance software reliability.</p><p>Forward-thinking businesses worldwide recognize the added security benefits of moving to the cloud. However, there is the misconception that if you don’t control and house your data, it’s less secure.</p><p>This couldn’t be further from the truth, as evidenced by the fact that on-premises solutions account for the vast majority of data leaks. There are a variety of reasons, why the public cloud is beneficial; including:</p><ul><li><em>Expertise in cyber security:</em> Big cloud attracts the world’s most talented engineers and has the resources to fund large security teams and the most advanced security tools. You gain access to highly skilled teams of IT professionals tasked solely with protecting your data in the cloud infrastructure.</li><li> Cloud-native security services are the most advanced. Security innovation is taking place in the cloud and is being tailored to cloud-based solutions.</li><li><em>Regular penetration testing:</em> In Public clouds, regular penetration testing is held to higher standards than on-premises solutions and private clouds. Some private clouds are never subjected to acceptable levels of penetration testing.</li><li> The majority of data breaches are the result of human error. Cloud sceptics believe that keeping their data in-house gives them more control, but the opposite is true. For example, data stored in the public cloud has a minuscule chance of falling into the hands of the wrong people as a result of an employee error. Your risk increases as human control over your information decrease.</li></ul><p>One of the main benefits of the public cloud is, a fast and inexpensive way to store data in any country on the planet.</p><p>For example, if a company wants to reduce latency for its services, it has to choose a provider that stores the cloud in its preferred country.</p><p>This can also be used to keep data in a specific jurisdiction. SIM-Cloud, for example, is housed in a data center in Germany, where the law protects against illegal seizures.</p><p>Owning a data center of your own outside of your home country is a challenging and expensive endeavor. The business will also need to determine the specifics of the nation’s legislative structure in addition to the logistical issue.</p><p>For example, your company won’t have to deal with this problem any longer if you use a cloud solution because the provider has already taken care of everything.</p><p>The public cloud can be scaled without investing in new hardware and manually installing it in an on-premises data center. The virtual machines can have additional CPU cores, RAM, or storage whenever you need it. The hardware foundation of the cloud is kept in the provider’s data center, and the resources are also made available via remote access.</p><p>Small businesses that are unable to expand their IT capabilities by purchasing expensive hardware will find this benefit of public clouds to be especially helpful.</p><p>The public cloud can be instantly scaled to fit the task at hand and expanded as the business grows. Compared to a dedicated server, this is much faster and more affordable. You will need to purchase new components and swap out the old ones if you need to scale a physical server.</p><p><strong>4. Provider Takes Care of Maintenance</strong></p><p>You no longer need to purchase hardware or software when you rent a cloud; this is now the responsibility of your public cloud provider. The provider is also in charge of all elements required for the infrastructure to operate, including power, redundant components, security, cooling systems, etc. So with the Public cloud, your company saves time and money by doing it this way.</p><p>This benefit of using a public cloud also applies to renting dedicated servers. However, there will be more maintenance expenses if the business deploys its infrastructure on-site. Rent a public cloud if you want to free your company from these costs while still enjoying all the advantages of the public cloud.</p><p>What are the financial savings possible with the public cloud?</p><p>Some businesses actually save millions of dollars, but if your account needs to be managed better, you might not even see cost savings.</p><p>But you can get an idea of how much you can save if you look at why the public cloud saves you money and then look at your own IT environment. You save money by using the public cloud because you have the following:</p><ul><li><em>No investments in capital:</em> Equipment and storage space doesn’t need to be purchased. Setting up a public cloud subscription is inexpensive, and you only pay for the resources you use after that. Your infrastructure spending will change from a capital expense (CapEx) to an operating expense thanks to a public cloud.</li><li><em>There are no upkeep or update expenses:</em> Maintenance is handled by your service provider and is a fixed expense covered by your subscription. In addition, your service provider manages all software updates and includes them in your hosting package, so you or your staff are not required to carry out upgrades.</li><li> You only pay for what you use, which prevents the idling of resources and unnecessary spending. Additionally, you have the freedom to quickly scale up or down, using more computing power when necessary and less when not.</li><li> By not having internal servers, you save money on the energy they use to run.</li></ul><p>Architecturally, the cloud is a fault-tolerant solution. The virtual machine will use the processing power of another server if a component malfunctions.</p><p>The systems will continue to run, and cloud services will continue functioning as usual. Reliable service providers also make use of redundant cloud components. This significantly reduces the possibility of catastrophic failures.</p><p>Zones of availability may be used to increase fault tolerance. An availability zone is a separate area of the cloud that makes use of the following:</p><ul><li>Independent Computing Instances</li><li>A business can double the stability of its services by spreading out the deployment of its systems across two availability zones.</li></ul><p>Predicting long-term computing power requirements is frequently challenging when a business is still in its infancy. Avoiding solutions that require significant financial outlays, such as on-premises deployment or long-term leasing of another infrastructural solution, is advised in such circumstances.</p><p>This problem is resolved by the public cloud’s pricing structure, which allows clients to only pay for resources that are actually being used. By doing this, the client’s business can utilize a scalable and effective computing platform without entering into long-term contracts or investments.</p><p>Private clouds are frequently single-tenant, so your entire company is impacted if the server crashes. Additionally, you are responsible for putting redundancy measures like backup servers and cloud disaster recovery plans in place with on-premise infrastructure.</p><p>However, because public clouds support multiple tenants, your resources are dispersed among several servers. Therefore, your applications can automatically switch to another cloud server if one goes down. Your applications and data are always accessible, thanks to it. By doing this, you can lessen downtime and maintain the efficiency of your company.</p><p>Overall, public clouds have several advantages over private clouds and on-premise infrastructures. First, they are usually less expensive, easier to maintain, and more secure.</p><p>Furthermore, public clouds offer scalability and redundancy, which are difficult to achieve with on-premise infrastructures. So, if you’re considering moving to the cloud, a public cloud might be the best option for your company.</p><p><em> For more details, readers may refer to <a href=\"https://testgrid.io/blog/benefits-of-public-cloud/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">TestGrid.</a></em></p>","contentLength":8551,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Becoming an Machine Learning Engineer in 2025","url":"https://www.kdnuggets.com/becoming-machine-learning-engineer-2025","date":1740142855,"author":"Nisha Arya","guid":8572,"unread":true,"content":"<article>Read some honest advice on how to become a machine learning engineer.</article>","contentLength":69,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"https://www.kdnuggets.com/wp-content/uploads/8-bit_ninja_2d_platformer_in_an_office_building_2.png","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"For SEO Site Audits, Is It Better To Use AI-powered Tools Or Stick With Traditional Manual Methods?","url":"https://dev.to/seosiri/for-seo-site-audits-is-it-better-to-use-ai-powered-tools-or-stick-with-traditional-manual-methods-5he2","date":1740141023,"author":"Momenul Ahmad","guid":8582,"unread":true,"content":"<p>The question of whether to use AI-powered tools or traditional manual methods for SEO site audits is increasingly relevant in today's rapidly evolving digital landscape.

In India, the adoption of data science is surging, with companies and startups leveraging data-driven insights to enhance decision-making and operational efficiency. Cities like Pune, a major IT hub, have become significant contributors to this transformation, housing numerous data science institutes and professionals. However, with great power comes great responsibility. The ethical implications of data science are profound, and as we embrace innovation, it is crucial to ensure that it is done responsibly.</p><p>The Ethical Challenges in Data Science</p><p>Data science involves collecting, processing, and analyzing vast amounts of data. While these advancements bring numerous benefits, they also pose ethical dilemmas, such as:</p><ol><li>Data Privacy and Security</li></ol><p>Data privacy is a critical concern in today's digital age. Companies collect personal data from users through various channels, including social media, e-commerce platforms, and healthcare applications. However, improper handling of this data can lead to breaches, identity theft, and misuse. India has taken steps to address this issue through regulations such as the Personal Data Protection (PDP) Bill, which aims to safeguard users' data and hold companies accountable.</p><p>Algorithms are only as good as the data they are trained on. If the dataset used for training AI models is biased, the results can be discriminatory. For example, biased hiring algorithms may favor certain demographics while disadvantaging others. In India, where diversity is vast in terms of language, culture, and socio-economic status, biased AI models can exacerbate existing inequalities. Pune, being home to several AI-driven startups, must ensure that ethical AI development is a priority.</p><ol><li>Transparency and Explainability</li></ol><p>Many AI and machine learning models function as \"black boxes,\" meaning their decision-making processes are not easily interpretable. This lack of transparency can lead to mistrust, especially in critical sectors such as healthcare and finance. Ethical data science calls for explainable AI (XAI), which enables stakeholders to understand how decisions are made.</p><ol><li>Ethical Use of AI in Surveillance</li></ol><p>India has witnessed an increase in AI-driven surveillance for security and governance. While this technology can help prevent crimes and enhance public safety, it also raises concerns about mass surveillance and individual freedoms. Striking a balance between security and privacy is essential to prevent the misuse of AI for unauthorized surveillance.</p><p>Best Practices for Ethical Data Science</p><p>To ensure responsible innovation, data scientists, companies, and policymakers must adhere to ethical best practices:</p><ol><li>Implementing Robust Data Governance Policies</li></ol><p>Organizations should adopt strict data governance policies to ensure data security and compliance with regulations. This includes anonymizing sensitive data, using encryption techniques, and obtaining informed consent from users.</p><ol><li>Addressing Algorithmic Bias</li></ol><p>To minimize bias, data scientists should use diverse datasets, perform bias audits, and apply fairness-aware machine learning techniques. Continuous monitoring and updating of algorithms are necessary to ensure fairness.</p><ol><li>Promoting Transparency and Accountability</li></ol><p>Developers should prioritize explainable AI and create models that allow users to understand their decision-making processes. Regulatory bodies should also enforce AI transparency guidelines.</p><ol><li>Ethical AI Education and Awareness</li></ol><p>Data science professionals should be trained in ethical AI development.

It focuses on the <strong>integration and application of LLMs</strong> (Large Language Models) in real-world scenarios. This includes not only tools and techniques to enhance your understanding of AI development, but also data setup, working with LLMs, and building retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems. This article aims to summarize the key takeaways and insights gained from the course.</p><p><strong>The intention is purely to provide an unbiased, subjective opinion about the course.</strong><strong>this article is not affiliated in any way by the company behind AI_devs.</strong> I received neither compensation nor a discount. You won’t find any referral links here. At the time of writing this article, the course is not purchasable. I receive no benefits from advertising or promoting AI_devs, or its authors. Moreover, I paid the same price for the course as everyone else.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  How is the course organized?\n</h2><p>The main training consists of five episodes, each containing five lessons. Every lesson appeared on a consecutive workday, so the main course lasted five weeks in total. There was also an optional, introductory pre-work week.</p><p>Almost every lesson ends with a task. <strong>You have to solve at least 80% of the tasks to get a certificate</strong> (here is <a href=\"https://credsverse.com/credentials/b852d146-0491-436a-8a19-dc68bb6e6d03\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">mine</a>). Note that these tasks involve communication via API. The API keys were separate for each participant. You have to write code (or instruct some LLM to write it for you) and execute it to pass. Code samples provided in the lessons are in JavaScript but <strong>you can use any programming language you are familiar with.</strong></p><p>There were also extra tasks, for fun, that did not count towards the certificate. All the tasks (both normal and extra ones) used the CTF (Capture The Flag) form.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  The most important concepts\n</h2><p>Look at the course name suffix: .</p><p>That means it teaches <strong>how to use programming tools to solve problems automatically</strong>. Usually an agent uses many lower-level tools, such as some LLM via API and a database (not necessarily dedicated for AI).</p><p>It is important to handle unhappy scenarios gracefully. <strong>Giving up and showing an error to the user is better than presenting an incorrect or off-topic answer.</strong></p><p>There are a lot of tutorials and trainings on using LLMs and prompt engineering. In contrast, there is much less information about . These include powerful tools for <strong>monitoring and debugging AI applications</strong>, including specialized databases for vector storage, and utilities for web crawling. I’ll describe a few of them used in the course.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  FireCrawl: Web content extraction\n</h2><p><a href=\"https://www.firecrawl.dev/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">FireCrawl</a> is a web scraper designed for AI applications. It focuses on <strong>extracting clean, structured content from web pages</strong>. It can filter out noise like ads, navigation menus, and irrelevant elements.

They differ from traditional software development. Here are some key techniques that have proven effective when building AI-powered systems.</p><p>Function calling enables <strong>structured communication between the model and external tools or APIs</strong>. You provide a schema describing available functions and their parameters. An LLM can decide when to use specific tools and generate the appropriate arguments on its own.</p><p>This creates a standardized way for models to interact with external systems. For example, <strong>it can help searching databases, or controlling smart home devices.</strong></p><h2>\n  \n  \n  One prompt for one problem\n</h2><p>A key principle in AI development is to <strong>break down complex tasks into smaller prompts</strong>, rather than trying to achieve many objectives in a single go. <strong>Each prompt should be focused to address one specific problem or subtask.</strong></p><p>This approach improves reliability and makes it easier to debug issues. For example, instead of asking an LLM to both analyze a document and generate a summary in one prompt, it’s better to split this into two steps. First analyzing the content, then creating the summary based on that analysis. This technique also reduces token usage which leads to lesser costs.</p><p>The AI_devs 3 course has provided valuable insights into building <a href=\"https://www.thedroidsonroids.com/blog/ai-in-app-development-guide-for-developers\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">AI-powered applications</a>.

In our data-driven world, AI and machine learning provide incredibly valuable insights that were previously unattainable by humans alone. Companies that fail to implement AI and ML projects risk falling behind their competition.</p><p>All major tech companies have entire departments dedicated to AI and ML, but so do many businesses of all sizes, using AI and ML to innovate their business models.</p><p>When you decide to undertake some AI and ML development, it is important to build the right team, starting with AI and machine learning consultants. By finding the right specialists, you reduce risk and effort.</p><p><strong>What are AI/ML consultants?</strong></p><p>As AI and machine learning continue to take over entire industries, starting with the power of predictive analytics and processes, <a href=\"https://www.sparkouttech.com/ai-consulting-services/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">AI consulting firms</a> are becoming even more important.</p><p>AI and Machine Learning Consultants are skilled and experienced designers, developers, and other AI experts who help design, implement, and integrate AI solutions into the enterprise business environment. They can provide, develop, and advise on a wide range of AI capabilities such as predictive analytics, data science, natural language processing (NLP), computer vision, process automation, voice-enabled technology, and much more.</p><p>These consultants can assess the potential of data, software infrastructure, and technology to effectively implement AI systems and workflows.</p><p><strong>More than a data scientist</strong>\nWhen hiring the best AI and machine learning consultants, you should look for specialists who go beyond data science. Most AI and machine learning projects involve much more than just data science. For example, they involve engineering and aggregating data and formatting it to teach an AI system.</p><p>These types of projects often also involve hardware, wireless, and networking, meaning the consultant needs to be an expert in cloud and the Internet of Things (IoT). If you want to further increase your chances of success, look for a consultant who understands the business implications of your requirements and can discuss budgeting, planning, and solution architecture.</p><p>The various stages of planning and implementation\nThe role of AI and ML consultants can be divided into a few main stages, but they are by no means the only stages.</p><p>\nYour AI/ML consultant will start by understanding how implementing an AI project can help achieve business goals and drive business growth. This stage typically involves a lot of research, where you will work with the consultant to identify bottlenecks or other challenges that the <a href=\"https://www.sparkouttech.com/ai-development-company/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">AI ​​development solutions</a> could help address and solve. The consultant will also deliver a proof of concept that can help demonstrate the value of the AI ​​project to stakeholders.</p><p>AI and machine learning consultants typically formulate strategies using the following steps:</p><p>Understanding the current state of your company: The consultant analyzes your company’s strategy to understand its current state.\nBuilding a portfolio: The next step is to identify your pain points and understand how AI can contribute to your business success.<p>\nDetermining the value of a project: The vast majority of AI projects fail or do not generate value. The consultant will help your company predict the value of the project so that you do not invest more than the expected result.</p>\nAnother aspect of the strategy stage is due diligence. It is important to have a solid understanding of AI marketing to conduct effective due diligence, as AI success factors differ from those in other fields.</p><p>One reason for this difference is that deep learning-based AI solutions require more or better labeled data. Unlike regular software, which improves as product owners learn from usage patterns, AI requires more unique data to improve the accuracy of model predictions.</p><p>After the strategy stage, the consultant will move on to implementation, which is based on determining key areas where technology can transform your business. This stage involves a comprehensive implementation plan, and the consultant will gain the skills and tools needed to bring the AI ​​strategy to life.</p><p>The strategy stage above can result in several initiatives, and implementation is best thought of as multiple activities involving planning, vendor selection, development, project management, and more.</p><p>There are a few options when it comes to implementation. All or part of the services can be performed by the consultant. Another option is to carry out the implementation in-house, which is often the case. That said, if your company does not have the capacity to implement certain initiatives, consultants help speed up the process.</p><p>Once your <a href=\"https://www.sparkouttech.com/ai-development-company/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Ai Development Services</a> is implemented, it’s important to maintain and scale it internally. The best consulting projects improve company culture and skills, which is crucial in the AI ​​field as talent can be hard to find.</p><p>The best AI and machine learning consultants ensure that once the project is implemented, the company’s teams are capable and knowledgeable about the technology and solutions. This often requires well-documented and organized training materials, along with a knowledge transfer process.</p><p><strong>Questions to ask before choosing AI/ML consultants</strong></p><p>When considering AI and machine learning consultants for your company’s project, there are a few key questions you should ask yourself and the company:</p><p><strong>Is it going to be a positive return?</strong></p><p>This is the first and most important question. You need to make sure that there is a high probability of positive returns in the short term. You can achieve this by asking the consultant about short, medium and long term projections.</p><p><strong>Does the company have the required human capital?</strong></p><p>After creating a solution, you will need to decide whether it will be done in-house or outsourced. This means making sure you have the right people with the right skills, which will make it easier to evaluate the consultant’s performance.</p><p><strong>What is the consultant’s experience?</strong></p><p>Another key issue concerns the consultant’s experience. There are many AI and machine learning consultants on the market, both large and small. You need to consider your industry and make sure you select the right one. Each industry will have its own set of requirements, and a consultant’s experience is the best indicator of future performance.</p><p><strong>How do AI/ML consultants price their services?</strong>\nThe price of AI/ML consulting services will vary widely depending on the company or platform you go with. Many AI consulting companies also have their own AI products and technology. When it comes to these companies, they often offer AI consulting for free to power their own products.</p><p><strong>Other companies base their pricing around a few key factors:</strong></p><p>Time and Material: Most AI and machine learning consulting projects are based on the time and materials required for the project, which is estimated by the consultant. These prices are negotiated before the project begins.\nSuccess: Some consultants base their pricing on success. Success-based projects are not very common as they create uncertainty and imperfect measurements. This is because many metrics do not accurately measure success. There are many unreliable factors such as seasonality, unexpected downturns, workforce turnover, and more.<p>\nThe rise of independent networks</p>\nThere is another option when it comes to <a href=\"https://www.sparkouttech.com/ai-consulting-services/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">hiring an AI consultant</a>: freelance networks and platforms. These exclusive networks have gained popularity in recent years thanks to their simplicity and wide range of offerings.</p><ol><li>Sparkout\nOne of the best ways to ensure you’re hiring top AI and machine learning engineers and consultants is to search for developers with a platform like Sparkout, which connects companies with the top 3% of design, development, project management, and finance talent worldwide. For companies looking to hire AI and machine learning engineers, they’ll want to focus on Sparkout developers, who offer full-stack development, machine learning, AI, and blockchain services.</li></ol><p>Since its founding in 2017, Sparkout has served over 2,000 customers across a variety of industries.

The question is: how can we make these collaborations not only remarkable but also profitable and efficient? There are several AI-driven tools already being used—or will be used—during tournaments: AI-powered viewer analytics track audience reactions, measure engagement, and highlight the most buzzworthy moments. Can you recognize which Entyx tool does this? </p><p>AI generates personalized content for advertisers, enabling dynamic ads and even AR effects. Neural Networks can analyze games in real time and may even contribute to the presenter’s commentary. AI-driven cameras could evolve into tools that monitor rule violations and alert judges about controversial moments. Curious? Let’s dive into this today! </p><h2>\n  \n  \n  AI and eSports Event Production\n</h2><p>AI in eSports is transforming the way eSports events are produced. AI algorithms automate broadcast management, personalize content for each viewer, and optimize ads in real time. This allows brands to integrate their ads naturally, resulting in more organic and positive viewer experiences. </p><p>Moreover, eSports sponsorship analytics can analyze viewers’ behaviors and foreseen trends, helping advertisers choose the most effective audience engagement formats. One of the brightest examples of AI in the eSports event production is Riot Games’ Valorant Live Stats System.</p><p>During major tournaments like VCT (Valorant Champions Tour), AI analyzes and tracks gameplay in real time, automatically selecting the best moments and immediately reflecting the data, integrating stats into the broadcast. This opens many new opportunities for sponsors and keeps viewers engaged as you might have guessed.  </p><p>Advertisers can integrate their ads into the most exciting moments of the game—AI detects clutch rounds or highlights and automatically overlays graphics or replays cuts of the game with branded elements of the advertiser. In this way, sponsorship integrations look more natural, and dynamic and do not irritate the eye of a viewer. This approach is already being used in cybersports and is expected to become standard for major tournaments in the future.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  How AI Is Applied Inside Sports Teams\n</h2><p>Benjamin Franklin once said, “When you're finished changing, you're finished.” This perfectly captures the urgency sports teams feel in keeping up with evolving technology. Let’s take the Chicago Fire team, for example. Their analytics department uses advanced technology, including forms of artificial intelligence, to gain an edge in performance scouting and recruitment. They've scored goals specifically exploiting work that the machine learning modeling has told them are areas they can attack. </p><p>Wearable GPS devices help Chicago Fire collect vast amounts of valuable data during both training and matches. The devices are distributed by a company called “Hudl” which works with elite teams across the globe. These devices allow teams to monitor a player's workload in real life during practice and games, optimizing every single training and practice session to match the game pace without risking soft tissue injuries. </p><p>Five athletic programs at Northwestern use similar wearable devices including the Wildcats women's soccer team. They want fast, strong resilience to fit athletes and they make sure that they get to that point so when they're in the season they're ready to go. Coaches could tell athletes somewhat subjectively that it doesn't look like an athlete is running though like they have to cover more ground, but they can now pull out the data and point at the player of the competitor team who covered this much and compare to the athlete of the team, there's room to make up. When the light goes on, athletes start changing the way they train so that they can meet those physical demands. </p><p>In the weight room, the men's basketball team uses a different piece of technology: a force plate to measure jump height, speed, force, and imbalances in body movements. It does give some insight as to what's going on. It allows them to put some data to some of these subjective measures they've had in the past, not just asking “How an athlete feels”. They have some data to back that up.</p><p>Do they have more to give you now? What do the numbers bear? What does science tell? It's just amazing the amount of AI-powered tools they now have to quantify these areas and help the athletes be at their very best. </p><p>The data coaches collect with these devices can now be seamlessly integrated into real time broadcasts. And fans of each athlete can track his success in real time during tournaments. With the advent of AI in regular sports and eSports then, we'll see larger departments and maybe more data-driven processes on the whole as everyone is sort of in the arms race to continue to find those edges over the rest of the competition.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  How AI Is Applied In eSports Teams\n</h2><p>While AI in traditional sports helps athletes analyze their physical condition, in eSports, AI focuses on improving gaming strategies, monitoring player performance, and increasing engagement. </p><p>The AI-driven platforms like SenpAI, Mobalytics, and others, analyze the actions of players, outline the mistakes, and offer strategies to improve performance. AI-driven cameras and eye-tracking technologies help study player focus, reaction time, and decision-making patterns. In cybersports, they also use smart gaming chairs and heart-rate monitors to track stress levels, and fatigue to help players stay on top of their performance levels. They also tend to use AI-assistant coaching as machine learning helps to assess the player's tendencies, analyze their game styles, offer personalized training sessions, and even simulate opponents’ strategies to better prepare.  </p><p>With the great expansion and development of AI in traditional sports, eSports teams are also implementing or about to implement these technologies to elevate their performance level. </p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Why eSports Sponsorship Needs AI\n</h2><p>Sponsors demand transparent data: How many viewers will see their brand? How long will their logo be on screen? What is the real cost of the collaboration? What eSports sponsorship ROI will they eventually get? </p><p>The Entyx AI-powered marketing analytics platform tracks viewers' behavior, measures the time logos spend in a frame, and calculates interactions—such as clicks, mentions, and shares—in real time. We tracked sponsors of Formula 1 and calculated each brand’s logo in frame time, watch <a href=\"https://youtu.be/P2WhvfdUTQA\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">here</a>. </p><p>How does Entyx do it? No magic applied! Just a solid data tracking system involved! \nEntyx tracks Media Value, meaning advertisers get an exact time frame in broadcasts. The tool automatically identifies and monitors the presence of brand logos in video content. This feature provides detailed reports on logo visibility, duration of exposure, and placement within the content, helping you understand the effectiveness of your branding efforts.</p><p>We make a 360-degree AI-powered analysis of the engagement level. We scan the audio in video content to identify and analyze specific keywords and phrases related to your brand or campaign. The Sentiment Tracking feature tracks the frequency of these mentions and the context in which they are used, providing valuable data on how your messaging is being communicated. Provides insights into the surrounding content when your brand or keywords are mentioned, helping you understand how your messaging fits into the broader conversation. The cherry on the top? This tool identifies sentiment as positive, negative, or neutral, providing a clear picture of audience reactions and perceptions. <a href=\"https://entyx.io/sign-up\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Sign up</a> to try!\nWe offer powerful software for data collecting, visualizing, comparing, and analyzing from streaming platforms such as Twitch, YouTube, and Kick.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Conclusion: The Future of AI in eSports Production\n</h2><p>AI eSports trends are connected to automation, personalization, and improvements in viewer experience. AI-driven cameras will replace operators automatically tracking the key tournament moments and choosing the best points of view to improve the dynamics of the broadcast. AI algorithms analyze the gameplay in real time and automatically point cameras to the most epic moments like kill streaks and clutches. The future of sponsorship in gaming sticks with AI technology which easily outlines the most epic game moments and automatically creates cuts to share broadcasts on social media to also give additional exposure to the sponsors. </p><p>This technology makes cybersports broadcasts more exciting and convenient for the audience, sponsors, and event organizers. And of course, AI-powered marketing platforms like Entyx improve ad campaigns by making them more measurable, efficient, and profitable for sponsors. Entyx helps choose the best partners based on their performance in real time and tracks logos, calculates Media Value of every collaboration of yours. Ready to use AI automation?

Guanao is the first author of the Nature Communications review article [1].</em></p><p>Spatially resolved transcriptomics (SRT) is revolutionizing <a href=\"https://towardsdatascience.com/tag/genomics/\" title=\"Genomics\">Genomics</a> by enabling the high-throughput measurement of gene expression while preserving spatial context. Unlike single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), which captures transcriptomes without spatial location information, SRT allows researchers to map gene expression to precise locations within a tissue, providing insights into tissue organization, cellular interactions, and spatially coordinated gene activity. The increasing volume and complexity of SRT data necessitate the development of robust statistical and computational methods, making this field highly relevant to data scientists, statisticians, and machine learning (ML) professionals. Techniques such as spatial statistics, graph-based models, and deep learning have been applied to extract meaningful biological insights from these data.</p><p>A key step in SRT analysis is the detection of spatially variable genes (SVGs)—genes whose expression varies non-randomly across spatial locations. Identifying SVGs is crucial for characterizing tissue architecture, functional gene modules, and cellular heterogeneity. However, despite the rapid development of computational methods for SVG detection, these methods vary widely in their definitions and statistical frameworks, leading to inconsistent results and challenges in interpretation.</p><p>In our recent review published in [1], we systematically examined 34 peer-reviewed SVG detection methods and introduced a classification framework that clarifies the biological significance of different SVG types. This article provides an overview of our findings, focusing on the three major categories of SVGs and the statistical principles underlying their detection.</p><p>SVG detection methods aim to uncover genes whose spatial expression reflects biological patterns rather than technical noise. Based on our review of 34 peer-reviewed methods, we categorize SVGs into three groups: Overall SVGs, Cell-Type-Specific SVGs, and Spatial-Domain-Marker SVGs (Figure 2).</p><p>Methods for detecting the three SVG categories serve different purposes (Fig. 3). First, the detection of overall SVGs screens informative genes for downstream analyses, including the identification of spatial domains and functional gene modules. Second, detecting cell-type-specific SVGs aims to reveal spatial variation within a cell type and help identify distinct cell subpopulations or states within cell types. Third, spatial-domain-marker SVG detection is used to find marker genes to annotate and interpret spatial domains already detected. These markers help understand the molecular mechanisms underlying spatial domains and assist in annotating tissue layers in other datasets.</p><p>The relationship among the three SVG categories depends on the detection methods, particularly the null and alternative hypotheses they employ. If an overall SVG detection method uses the null hypothesis that a non-SVG’s expression is independent of spatial location and the alternative hypothesis that any deviation from this independence indicates an SVG, then its SVGs should theoretically include both cell-type-specific SVGs and spatial-domain-marker SVGs. For example, DESpace [2] is a method that detects both overall SVGs and spatial-domain-marker SVGs, and its detected overall SVGs must be marker genes for some spatial domains. This inclusion relationship holds true except in extreme scenarios, such as when a gene exhibits opposite cell-type-specific spatial patterns that effectively cancel each other out. However, if an overall SVG detection method’s alternative hypothesis is defined for a specific spatial expression pattern, then its SVGs may not include some cell-type-specific SVGs or spatial-domain-marker SVGs.</p><p>To understand how SVGs are detected, we categorized the statistical approaches into three major types of hypothesis tests:&nbsp;</p><ol><li>Dependence Test – Examines the dependence between a gene’s expression level and the spatial location.&nbsp;</li><li>Regression Fixed-Effect Test – Examines whether some or all of the fixed-effect covariates, for instance, spatial location, contribute to the mean of the response variable, i.e., a gene’s expression.&nbsp;</li><li>Regression Random-Effect Test (Variance Component Test) – Examines whether the random-effect covariates, for instance, spatial location, contribute to the variance of the response variable, i.e., a gene’s expression.</li></ol><p>To further explain how these tests are used for SVG detection, we denote 𝑌 as gene’s expression level and 𝑆 as the spatial locations. Dependence test is the most general hypothesis test for SVG detection. For a given gene, it decides whether the gene’s expression level 𝑌 is independent of the spatial location 𝑆, i.e., the null hypothesis is:</p><p>There are two types of regression tests: fixed-effect tests, where the effect of the spatial location is assumed to be fixed, and random-effect tests, which assume the effect of the spatial location as random. To explain these two types of tests, we use a linear mixed model for a given gene as an example:</p><p>\nwhere the response variable \\( Y_i \\) is the gene’s expression level at spot \\( i \\), \n\\( x_i \\) \\( \\epsilon \\) \\( R^p \\) indicates the fixed-effect covariates of spot \\( i \\), \n\\( z_i \\) \\( \\epsilon \\) \\( R^q \\) denotes the random-effect covariates of spot \\( i \\), \nand \\( \\epsilon_i \\) is the random measurement error at spot \\( i \\) with zero mean. \n\nIn the model parameters, \\( \\beta_0 \\) is the (fixed) intercept, \\( \\beta \\) \\( \\epsilon \\) \\( R^p \\) indicates the fixed effects, and \\( \\gamma \\) \\( \\epsilon \\) \\( R^q \\) denotes the random effects with zero means and the covariance matrix:\n</p><p>In this linear mixed model, independence is assumed between random effect and random errors and among random errors.</p><p>Fixed-effect tests examine whether some or all of the fixed-effect covariates \\( x_i \\) (dependent on spatial locations ) contribute to the mean of the response variable. If all fixed-effect covariates make no contribution, then:</p><p>Random-effect tests examine whether the random-effect covariates \\( z_i \\) (dependent on spatial locations ) contribute to the variance of the response variable Var⁡Yi, focusing on the decomposition: </p><p>and testing if the contribution of the random-effect covariates&nbsp;is zero. The null hypothesis:</p><p>Among the 23 methods that use frequentist hypothesis tests, dependence tests and random-effect regression tests have been primarily applied to detect overall SVGs, whereas fixed-effect regression tests have been used across all three SVG categories. Understanding these distinctions is key to selecting the right method for specific research questions.</p><p>Improving SVG detection methods requires balancing detection power, specificity, and scalability while addressing key challenges in spatial transcriptomics analysis. Future developments should focus on adapting methods to different SRT technologies and tissue types, as well as extending support for multi-sample SRT data to enhance biological insights. Additionally, strengthening statistical rigor and validation frameworks will be crucial for ensuring the reliability of SVG detection. Benchmarking studies also need refinement, with clearer evaluation metrics and standardized datasets to provide robust method comparisons.</p><p>[1] Yan, G., Hua, S.H. &amp; Li, J.J. (2025).

For instance, a financial analyst bot would need access to reports, market prices, and industry news; while a policy advisor bot would need access to hundreds of policy documents. </p><p><strong>RAG (retrieval-augmented generation)</strong> is a popular method for providing AI models access to such background knowledge. At a high level, such knowledge gets chunked and stored in a database, which is later used to retrieve the most relevant information based on the user query. The retrieved information gets appended to the prompt sent to the AI model, thus improving its final response to the user query.</p><p>In theory, it sounds straightforward enough. But to implement a production-ready RAG system, we would need to consider factors like retrieval quality, search speed, and response quality to meet user satisfaction. Let’s explore some common issues in implementing RAG systems and best practices for resolving them. Afterward, we will demonstrate an implementation example built using an orchestration platform like Orkes Conductor.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Common issues in implementing RAG\n</h2><ol><li><p><strong>Documents lose context when chunked</strong>, which affects the retrieval quality and subsequent response quality. </p><p>For example, chunks in a financial knowledge base may contain revenue data without specifying the company:</p><pre><code>“Dollars in millions, except per share data  FISCAL 2024  FISCAL 2023 % CHANGE\n\nRevenues    $   38,343      $   38,584      0   %”. \n</code></pre><p>Without the proper context, a search query like “What was the revenue for Acme Inc in 2024?” could pull up dozens of incorrect revenue data for the AI model to process and reference. The model could just as well respond with revenue from Nakatomi Trading Corp or Sirius Cybernetics rather than from Acme Inc. </p></li><li><p>The vector embedding approach to storing and retrieving information is <strong>inherently lossy and may miss out on retrieving chunks with exact lexical matches</strong>.</p><p>Vector embeddings capture semantic meaning, like lexical relationships (e.g., actor/actress are closely related), intent (e.g., positive/negative), and contextual significance. This approach works well for capturing meaningful information, such that two completely different sentences, “I love cats” and “Cats are the best”, are marked as highly similar due to their conceptual similarity.</p><p>On the flip side, this means that precise and specific wording gets lost in the vectorization process. As such, a typical vector-based RAG approach can sometimes fail to pick up on exact lexical matches. </p><p>For example, if you are trying to search for information about the Cornish Rex, a chunk like:</p><pre><code>“The appearance of the German Rex is reminiscent of the European Shorthair. Both cat breeds are of medium size and rather stocky build. The German Rex is a strong, muscular cat with a round head and a broad forehead, pronounced cheeks and large round eyes. It strolls through its territory on medium-long legs. The German Rex is not a graceful, Oriental-looking cat like its Cornish Rex and Devon Rex counterparts. It has a robust and grounded appearance.” - [Source](https://www.catsbest.eu/cat-breed/german-rex/)\n</code></pre><p>could be overlooked by the RAG system because it is primarily about the German Rex, and thus stored further away from chunks about the Cornish Rex in the vector space.</p></li></ol><p>Now, let’s explore some best practices to mitigate the common issues outlined above.</p><p>First: <strong>introduce context back into the chunks</strong>. This can be as simple as prepending chunks with the document and section titles, a method sometimes known as contextual chunk headers.</p><div><pre><code>Document title: Acme Inc Annual Fiscal Report\nSection title: Results of Operation\n\n“Dollars in millions, except per share data  FISCAL 2024  FISCAL 2023 % CHANGE\n\nRevenues    $   38,343      $   37,584      0   %”\n</code></pre></div><p>Or it can be as elaborate as <a href=\"https://www.anthropic.com/news/contextual-retrieval\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Anthropic’s context retrieval method</a>​​, where a summary of the chunk’s relation to the entire document is added to the chunk. In this approach, the contextual summaries are generated by an AI model using a prompt like:</p><div><pre><code>&lt;document&gt; \n{{WHOLE_DOCUMENT}} \n&lt;/document&gt; \n\nHere is the chunk we want to situate within the whole document \n&lt;chunk&gt; \n{{CHUNK_CONTENT}} \n&lt;/chunk&gt; \n\nPlease give a short succinct context to situate this chunk within the overall document for the purposes of improving search retrieval of the chunk. Answer only with the succinct context and nothing else. \n</code></pre></div><p>Semantic chunking can also help preserve each chunk's context. Rather than fixed-sized chunking, semantic chunking takes meaning and context into account when dividing the text.</p><p>In this approach, the text is split into individual sentences that are then indexed as embeddings. These sentence-level embeddings enable us to compare the semantic similarity of each sentence with neighboring sentences and split the chunks based on a breakpoint threshold value. This is useful for maintaining each chunk’s semantic integrity, which is essential for more accurate retrieval.</p><p><a href=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fny9jlx7cjduxubmvd5uf.png\"><img src=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fny9jlx7cjduxubmvd5uf.png\" alt=\"Graph showing the cosine distance between subsequent chunks of text generated by the RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter.

A hybrid search approach leverages both keyword-based search and vector search techniques, then combines the search results from both methods to provide a final search result.</p><p>BM25 (Best Matching 25) is one of the most popular ranking functions, used across major search engines. It’s a bag-of-words retrieval function that ranks documents based on the frequency of the search query appearing in its contents. BM25F is a variant that enables you to modify the weights of different fields, such as making the document body more important than the title.</p><p>These keyword-based functions remediate the lossy nature of vector searches, and using both types of search methods at once will cover the major bases in retrieving relevant information.</p><p>Reranking can also help to surface more relevant information from the set of retrieved documents. Rerankers are more accurate than embedding models in analyzing and comparing the query against the knowledge base, but are also much slower in processing compared to embedding models.</p><p>The best of both worlds (accuracy and speed) means using a two-stage retrieval process, where an embedding model is used to retrieve a subset of information from the entire knowledge base, and a reranker is used to further pare down and refine the search results.</p><p><a href=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2F3y0h5nfp2oyinm6rgqdl.jpg\"><img src=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2F3y0h5nfp2oyinm6rgqdl.jpg\" alt=\"Diagram of the retrieval step: relevant chunks are retrieved by the embedding model and are reranked before they are passed to an LLM to generate the answer.\" width=\"800\" height=\"384\"></a>Two-step retrieval process involving the embedding model and reranker.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  A RAG implementation walkthrough\n</h2><p>How can these best practices be implemented?

ODEs are a powerful tool that can describe a wide range of systems but are limited to a single variable. Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) are differential equations involving derivatives of multiple variables that can cover a far broader range and more complex systems. Often, ODEs are special cases or special assumptions applied to PDEs.</p><p>PDEs include Maxwell’s Equations (governing electricity and magnetism), Navier-Stokes equations (governing fluid flow for aircraft, engines, blood, and other cases), and the Boltzman equation for thermodynamics. PDEs can describe systems such as<a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0022247X85900435\"> flexible structures</a>,<a href=\"https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/337292.337359\"> power grids</a>,<a href=\"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4392493\"> manufacturing</a>, or<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/html/2405.12938v3\"> epidemiological</a> models in biology. They can represent highly complex behavior; the Navier Stokes equations describe the eddies of a rushing mountain stream. Their capacity for capturing and revealing more complex behavior of real-world systems makes these equations an important topic for study, both in terms of describing systems and analyzing known equations to make new discoveries about systems. Entire fields (like fluid dynamics, electrodynamics, structural mechanics) can be devoted to study of just a single set of PDEs.</p><p>This increased complexity comes with a cost; the systems captured by PDEs are much more difficult to analyze and control. ODEs are also described as lumped-parameter systems, the various parameters and variables that describe them are “lumped” into a discrete point (or small number of points for a coupled system of ODEs). PDEs are distributed parameter systems that track behavior throughout space and time. In other words, the state space for an ODE is a relatively small number of variables, such as time and a few system measurements at a specific point. For PDE/distributed parameter systems, the state space size can approach infinite dimensions, or discretized for computation into millions of points .&nbsp;A lumped parameter system controls the temperature of an engine based on a small number of sensors. A PDE/distributed parameter system would manage temperature dynamics across the entire engine.&nbsp;</p><p>As with ODEs, many PDEs must be analyzed (aside from special cases) through modelling and simulation. However, due to the higher dimensions, this modelling becomes far more complex. Many ODEs can be solved through straightforward applications of algorithms like MATLAB’s ODE45 or SciPy’s .&nbsp;PDEs are modelled across grids or meshes where the PDE is simplified to an algebraic equation (such as through Taylor Series expansion) at each point on the grid. Grid generation is a field, a science and art, on its own and ideal (or usable) grids can vary greatly based on problem geometry and <a href=\"https://towardsdatascience.com/tag/physics/\" title=\"Physics\">Physics</a>. Grids (and hence problem state spaces) can number in the millions of points with computation time running in days or weeks, and PDE solvers are often commercial software costing tens of thousands of dollars.&nbsp;</p><p>Controlling PDEs presents a far greater challenge than ODEs. The Laplace transform that forms the basis of much classical control theory is a one-dimensional transformation. While there has been some progress in PDE control theory, the field is not as comprehensive as for ODE/lumped systems. For PDEs, even basic controllability or observability assessments become difficult as the state space to assess increases by orders of magnitude and fewer PDEs have analytic solutions. By necessity, we run into design questions such as what part of the domain needs to be controlled or observed? Can the rest of the domain be in an arbitrary state?&nbsp;What subset of the domain does the controller need to operate over? With key tools in control theory underdeveloped, and new problems presented, applying machine learning has been a major area of research for understanding and controlling PDE systems.&nbsp;</p><p>Given the importance of PDEs, there has been research into developing control strategies for them. For example, <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Approximate-Controllability-Distributed-Parameter-Systems/dp/0521885728/ref=sr_1_1?crid=3FGUZ2CQYKGYQ&amp;dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.-oRlRZ73sDSnpAcPPbERrs7CUlG0Gr_Aw0V_JYBKkmc.ur8hTlYbid8e3MzQG0RdztW3vwTamw8QFtzQtDCbwHQ&amp;dib_tag=se&amp;keywords=analysis+and+control+of+distributed+parameter+systems+Glowinski&amp;qid=1739749882&amp;sprefix=analysis+and+control+of+distributed+parameter+systems+glowinski+%2Caps%2C88&amp;sr=8-1\">Glowinski et. all</a> developed an analytical adjoint based method from advanced functional analysis relying on simulation of the system. Other approaches, such as discussed by <a href=\"https://uwaterloo.ca/applied-mathematics/sites/default/files/uploads/documents/morris_controlhandbook.pdf\">Kirsten Morris</a>, apply estimations to reduce the order of the PDE to facilitate more traditional control approaches.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15267\">Botteghi and Fasel</a>, have begun to apply machine learning to control of these systems (note, this is only a VERY BRIEF glimpse of the research). Here we will apply reinforcement learning on two PDE control problems. The diffusion equation is a simple, linear, second order PDE with known analytic solution. The Kuramoto–Sivashinsky (K-S) equation is a much more complex 4 order nonlinear equation that models instabilities in a flame front.&nbsp;</p><p>For both these equations we use a simple, small square domain of grid points. We target a sinusoidal pattern in a target area of a line down the middle of the domain by controlling input along left and right sides. Input parameters for the controls are the values at the target region and the  coordinates of the input control points. Training the algorithm required modelling the system development through time with the control inputs. As discussed above, this requires a grid where the equation is solved at each point then iterated through each time step. I used the <a href=\"https://github.com/zwicker-group/py-pde\">py-pde package</a> to create a training environment for the reinforcement learner (thanks to the developer of this package for his prompt feedback and help!). With the  environment, approach proceeded as usual with reinforcement learning:&nbsp;the particular algorithm develops a guess at a controller strategy. That controller strategy is applied at small, discrete time steps and provides control inputs based on the current state of the system that lead to some reward (in this case, root mean square difference between target and current distribution).&nbsp;</p><p>Unlike previous cases, I only present results from the <a href=\"https://towardsdatascience.com/rl-for-physical-dynamical-systems-an-alternative-approach-8e2269dc1e79/\">genetic-programming</a> controller. I developed code to apply a soft actor critic (SAC) algorithm to execute <a href=\"https://github.com/retter-berkeley/DockerPDE_SAC\">as a container on AWS Sagemaker</a>. However, full execution would take about 50 hours and I didn’t want to spend the money! I looked for ways to reduce the computation time, but eventually gave up due to time constraints; this article was already taking long enough to get out with my job, military reserve duty, family visits over the holidays, civic and church involvement, and not leaving my wife to take care of our baby boy alone!</p><p>&nbsp;First we will discuss the diffusion equation:</p><p>with x as a two dimensional cartesian vector and ∆ <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laplace_operator\">Laplace operator</a></p><pre><code>from pde import Diffusion, CartesianGrid, ScalarField, DiffusionPDE, pde\ngrid = pde.CartesianGrid([[0, 1], [0, 1]], [20, 20], periodic=[False, True])\nstate = ScalarField.random_uniform(grid, 0.0, 0.2)\nbc_left={\"value\": 0}\nbc_right={\"value\": 0}\nbc_x=[bc_left, bc_right]\nbc_y=\"periodic\"\n#bc_x=\"periodic\"\neq = DiffusionPDE(diffusivity=.1, bc=[bc_x, bc_y])\nsolver=pde.ExplicitSolver(eq, scheme=\"euler\", adaptive = True)\n#result = eq.solve(state, t_range=dt, adaptive=True, tracker=None)\nstepper=solver.make_stepper(state, dt=1e-3)\ntarget = 1.*np.sin(2*grid.axes_coords[1]*3.14159265)</code></pre><p>The problem is sensitive to diffusion coefficient and domain size; mismatch between these two results in washing out control inputs before they can reach the target region unless calculated over a long simulation time. The control input was updated and reward evaluated every 0.1 timestep up to an end time of T=15.&nbsp;</p><p>Due to py-pde package architecture, the control is applied to one column inside the boundary. Structuring the py-pde package to execute with the boundary condition updated each time step resulted in a memory leak, and the py-pde developer advised using a stepper function as a work-around that doesn’t allow updating the boundary condition. This means the results aren’t exactly physical, but do display the basic principle of PDE control with reinforcement learning.&nbsp;</p><p>The GP algorithm was able to arrive at a final reward (sum mean square error of all 20 points in the central column) of about 2.0 after about 30 iterations with a 500 tree forest. The results are shown below as target and achieved distributed in the target region.</p><p>Now the more interesting and complex K-S equation:</p><p>Unlike the diffusion equation, the K-S equation displays rich dynamics (as befitting an equation describing flame behavior!). Solutions may include stable equilibria or travelling waves, but with increasing domain size all solutions will eventually become chaotic. The PDE implementation is given by below code:</p><pre><code>grid = pde.CartesianGrid([[0, 10], [0, 10]], [20, 20], periodic=[True, True])\nstate = ScalarField.random_uniform(grid, 0.0, 0.5)\nbc_y=\"periodic\"\nbc_x=\"periodic\"\neq = PDE({\"u\": \"-gradient_squared(u) / 2 - laplace(u + laplace(u))\"}, bc=[bc_x, bc_y])\nsolver=pde.ExplicitSolver(eq, scheme=\"euler\", adaptive = True)\nstepper=solver.make_stepper(state, dt=1e-3)\ntarget=1.*np.sin(0.25*grid.axes_coords[1]*3.14159265)</code></pre><p>Control inputs are capped at +/-5.&nbsp;The K-S equation is naturally unstable; if any point in the domain exceeds +/- 30 the iteration terminates with a large negative reward for causing the system to diverge. Experiments with the K-S equation in  revealed strong sensitivity to domain size and number of grid points. The equation was run for T=35, both with control and reward update at dt=0.1.</p><p>For each, the GP algorithm had more trouble arriving at a solution than in the diffusion equation. I chose to manually stop execution when the solution became visually close; again, we are looking for general principles here. For the more complex system, the controller works better—likely because of how dynamic the K-S equation is the controller is able to have a bigger impact. However, when evaluating the solution for different run times, I found it was not stable; the algorithm learned to arrive at the target distribution at a particular time, not to stabilize at that solution. The algorithm converged to the below solution, but, as the successive time steps show, the solution is unstable and begins to diverge with increasing time steps.&nbsp;</p><p>Careful tuning on the reward function would help obtain a solution that would hold longer, reinforcing how vital correct reward function is. Also, in all these cases we aren’t coming to perfect solutions; but, especially for the K-S equations we are getting decent solutions with comparatively little effort compared to non-RL approaches for tackling these sorts of problems.</p><p>The GP solution is taking longer to solve with more complex problems and has trouble handling large input variable sets. To use larger input sets, the equations it generates become longer which make it less interpretable and slower to compute.&nbsp;Solution equations had scores of terms rather than the dozen or so in ODE systems. Neural network approaches can handle large input variable sets more easily as input variables only directly impact the size of the input layer.&nbsp;Further, I suspect that neural networks will be able to handle more complex and larger problems better for reasons discussed previously in previous posts. Because of that, I did develop <a href=\"https://github.com/retter-berkeley/PhysicsGyms\">gymnasiums for py-pde diffusion</a>, which can easily be adapted to other PDEs per the <a href=\"https://py-pde.readthedocs.io/en/latest/\">py-pde documentation</a>. These gymnasiums can be used with different NN-based reinforcement learning such as the SAC algorithm I developed (which, as discussed, runs but takes time).&nbsp;</p><p>Adjustments could also be made to the genetic <a href=\"https://towardsdatascience.com/tag/programming/\" title=\"Programming\">Programming</a> approach. For example, vector representation of inputs could reduce size of solution equations. Duriez et al. all proposes using Laplace transform to introduce derivatives and integrals into the genetic programming equations, broadening the function spaces they can explore.&nbsp;</p><p>The ability to tackle more complex problems is important. As discussed above, PDEs can describe a wide range of complex phenomena. Currently, controlling these systems usually means lumping parameters. Doing so leaves out dynamics and so we end up working against such systems rather than with them. Efforts to control or manage these means higher control effort, missed efficiencies, and increased risk of failure (small or catastrophic). Better understanding and control alternatives for PDE systems could unlock major gains in engineering fields where marginal improvements have been the standard such as <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/316088790_MODELLING_VEHICLE_TRAFFIC_FLOW_WITH_PARTIAL_DIFFERENTIAL_EQUATIONS\">traffic</a>,<a href=\"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/21642583.2015.1033565\"> supply chains</a>, and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetohydrodynamics\">nuclear fusion</a> as these systems behave as high dimensional distributed parameter systems. They are highly complex with nonlinear and emergent phenomena but have large available data sets—ideal for machine learning to move past current barriers in understanding and optimization.&nbsp;</p><p>For now, I have only taken a very basic look at applying ML to controlling PDEs. Follow ons to the control problem include not just different systems, but optimizing where in the domain the control is applied, experimenting with reduced-order observation space, and optimizing the control for simplicity or control effort. In addition to improved control efficiency, as discussed in Brunton and Kutz, machine learning can also be used to derive data-based models of complex physical systems and to determine reduced order models which reduce state space size and may be more amenable to analysis and control, by traditional or machine learning methods. Machine learning and PDEs is an exciting area of research, and I encourage you to see what the professionals are doing!</p>","contentLength":13472,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"This Week's AI News Updates (Feb 20, 2025) 🚀","url":"https://dev.to/h_metacode_74e90df0ee5da6/this-weeks-ai-news-updates-feb-20-2025-30h4","date":1740099508,"author":"Metacode","guid":7521,"unread":true,"content":"<p>📢 Subscribe to the Latest AI News for ! 🧠 </p><p>This Week's AI News Updates (Feb 20, 2025) 🚀</p><h5>\n  \n  \n  ✅ Musk's xAI unveils Grok-3 AI chatbot to rival ChatGPT, China's DeepSeek\n</h5><h5>\n  \n  \n  ✅ AI Data Center With Up to 3 Gigawatts of Power Is Envisioned for South Korea\n</h5><h5>\n  \n  \n  ✅ Meta in talks to acquire AI chip firm FuriosaAI, according to report\n</h5><h5>\n  \n  \n  ✅ Apple reportedly partners with Alibaba after rejecting DeepSeek for China AI launch\n</h5><h5>\n  \n  \n  ✅ OpenAI postpones its o3 AI model in favor of a ‘unified’ next-gen release\n</h5><h5>\n  \n  \n  ✅ Apple is reportedly exploring humanoid robots\n</h5><h5>\n  \n  \n  ✅ Arm is launching its own chip this year with Meta as a customer\n</h5><h5>\n  \n  \n  ✅ Meta’s next big bet may be humanoid robotics\n</h5><h5>\n  \n  \n  ✅ Perplexity has become the latest AI company to release an in-depth research tool\n</h5><h5>\n  \n  \n  ✅ Microsoft creates chip it says shows quantum computers are 'years, not decades' away\n</h5>","contentLength":928,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Leveraging ML.NET to Solve Real-World Problems","url":"https://dev.to/fishi/leveraging-mlnet-to-solve-real-world-problems-lhp","date":1740099399,"author":"OLUWAYEMI FISAYO NATHANIEL","guid":7520,"unread":true,"content":"<p>Over the past six weeks, I’ve been on a transformative learning journey with ML.NET, diving deep into how machine learning can be leveraged to solve real-world problems across various industries—all while staying within the powerful .NET ecosystem.</p><p>As a .NET engineer, I’ve always been driven by the challenge of solving complex problems with innovative solutions.

These templates help developers reuse familiar code structures and implement standard features, such as access to cloud file storage. With the latest developments in LLM, project boilerplates appear to be more useful than ever.</p><p>Building on this progress, I’ve extended my existing Node.js <a href=\"https://towardsdatascience.com/tag/api/\" title=\"API\">API</a> boilerplate with a new tool&nbsp;<a href=\"https://github.com/vyancharuk/nodejs-todo-api-boilerplate\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">LLM Codegen</a>. This standalone feature enables the boilerplate to automatically generate module code for any purpose based on text descriptions. The generated module comes complete with E2E tests, database migrations, seed data, and necessary business logic.</p><p>I initially created a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://github.com/vyancharuk/nodejs-todo-api-boilerplate#nodejs-api-typescript-template-project\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">GitHub repository</a>&nbsp;for a Node.js API boilerplate to consolidate the best practices I’ve developed over the years. Much of the implementation is based on code from a real Node.js API running in production on AWS.</p><p>I am passionate about vertical slicing architecture and Clean Code principles to keep the codebase maintainable and clean. With recent advancements in LLM, particularly its support for large contexts and its ability to generate high-quality code, I decided to experiment with generating clean TypeScript code based on my boilerplate. This boilerplate follows specific structures and patterns that I believe are of high quality. The key question was whether the generated code would follow the same patterns and structure. Based on my findings, it does.</p><p>To recap, here’s a quick highlight of the Node.js API boilerplate’s key features:</p><ul><li>Vertical slicing architecture based on&nbsp;&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;&nbsp;principles</li><li>Services input validation using&nbsp;</li><li>Decoupling application components with dependency injection ()</li><li>Integration and&nbsp;&nbsp;testing with Supertest</li><li>Multi-service setup using&nbsp;compose</li></ul><p>Over the past month, I’ve spent my weekends formalizing the solution and implementing the necessary code-generation logic. Below, I’ll share the details.</p><p>Let’s explore the specifics of the implementation. All <a href=\"https://towardsdatascience.com/tag/code-generation/\" title=\"Code Generation\">Code Generation</a> logic is organized at the project root level, inside the&nbsp;&nbsp;folder, ensuring easy navigation. The Node.js boilerplate code has no dependency on&nbsp;, so it can be used as a regular template without modification.</p><p>It covers the following use cases:</p><ul><li>Generating clean, well-structured code for new module based on input description. The generated module becomes part of the Node.js REST API application.</li><li>Creating database migrations and extending seed scripts with basic data for the new module.</li><li>Generating and fixing E2E tests for the new code and ensuring all tests pass.</li></ul><p>The generated code after the first stage is clean and adheres to vertical slicing architecture principles. It includes only the necessary business logic for CRUD operations. Compared to other code generation approaches, it produces clean, maintainable, and compilable code with valid E2E tests.</p><p>The second use case involves generating DB migration with the appropriate schema and updating the seed script with the necessary data. This task is particularly well-suited for LLM, which handles it exceptionally well.</p><p>The final use case is generating E2E tests, which help confirm that the generated code works correctly. During the running of E2E tests, an SQLite3 database is used for migrations and seeds.</p><p>Mainly supported LLM clients are OpenAI and Claude.</p><p>To get started, navigate to the root folder&nbsp;&nbsp;and install all dependencies by running:</p><p>&nbsp;does not rely on Docker or any other heavy third-party dependencies, making setup and execution easy and straightforward. Before running the tool, ensure that you set at least one&nbsp;&nbsp;environment variable in the&nbsp;&nbsp;file with the appropriate API key for your chosen LLM provider. All supported environment variables are listed in the&nbsp;&nbsp;file (<code>OPENAI_API_KEY, CLAUDE_API_KEY</code>&nbsp;etc.) You can use&nbsp;,&nbsp;, or&nbsp;.

However, the output quality of this free LLaMA model could be improved, as most of the generated code fails to pass the compilation stage.</p><p>To start&nbsp;, run the following command:</p><p>Next, you’ll be asked to input the module description and name. In the module description, you can specify all necessary requirements, such as entity attributes and required operations. The core remaining work is performed by micro-agents:&nbsp;,&nbsp;, and&nbsp;.</p><p>Here is an example of a successful code generation:</p><p>Below is another example demonstrating how a compilation error was fixed:</p><p>The following is an example of a generated&nbsp;&nbsp;module code:</p><p>A key detail is that you can generate code step by step, starting with one module and adding others until all required APIs are complete. This approach allows you to generate code for all required modules in just a few command runs.</p><p>As mentioned earlier, all work is performed by those micro-agents:&nbsp;,&nbsp;&nbsp;and&nbsp;, controlled by the&nbsp;. They run in the listed order, with the&nbsp;&nbsp;generating most of the codebase. After each code generation step, a check is performed for missing files based on their roles (e.g., routes, controllers, services). If any files are missing, a new code generation attempt is made, including instructions in the prompt about the missing files and examples for each role. Once the&nbsp;&nbsp;completes its work, TypeScript compilation begins. If any errors are found, the&nbsp;&nbsp;takes over, passing the errors to the prompt and waiting for the corrected code. Finally, when the compilation succeeds, E2E tests are run. Whenever a test fails, the&nbsp;&nbsp;steps in with specific prompt instructions, ensuring all tests pass and the code stays clean.</p><p>All micro-agents are derived from the&nbsp;&nbsp;class and actively reuse its base method implementations. Here is the&nbsp;&nbsp;implementation for reference:</p><p>Each agent utilizes its specific prompt.

Here are a few examples:</p><pre><code>- The module responsible for library book management must handle endpoints for CRUD operations on books.\n- The module responsible for the orders management. It must provide CRUD operations for handling customer orders. Users can create new orders, read order details, update order statuses or information, and delete orders that are canceled or completed. Order must have next attributes: name, status, placed source, description, image url\n- Asset Management System with an \"Assets\" module offering CRUD operations for company assets. Users can add new assets to the inventory, read asset details, update information such as maintenance schedules or asset locations, and delete records of disposed or sold assets.</code></pre><p>Testing with&nbsp;&nbsp;and&nbsp;<code>claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022</code>&nbsp;showed comparable output code quality, although Sonnet is more expensive. Claude Haiku (<code>claude-3–5-haiku-20241022</code>), while cheaper and similar in price to&nbsp;, often produces non-compilable code. Overall, with&nbsp;, a single code generation session consumes an average of around 11k input tokens and 15k output tokens. This amounts to a cost of approximately 2 cents per session, based on token pricing of 15 cents per 1M input tokens and 60 cents per 1M output tokens (as of December 2024).</p><p>Below are Anthropic usage logs showing token consumption:</p><p>Based on my experimentation over the past few weeks, I conclude that while there may still be some issues with passing generated tests, 95% of the time generated code is compilable and runnable.</p><p>I hope you found some inspiration here and that it serves as a starting point for your next Node.js API or an upgrade to your current project.

Unfortunately, they can also take over your computer’s hard drive.</p><p>I write lots of computer tutorials and to keep them organized, each has a dedicated folder structure complete with a <a href=\"https://towardsdatascience.com/tag/conda-environment/\" title=\"Conda Environment\">Conda Environment</a>. This worked great at first, but soon my computer’s performance degraded, and I noticed that my SSD was filling up. At one point I had only 13 GB free.</p><p>Conda helps manage this problem by storing downloaded package files in a single “cache” (). When you install a package, conda checks for it in the package cache before downloading. If not found, conda will download and extract the package and link the files to the active environment. Because the cache is “shared,” different environments can use the same downloaded files without duplication.</p><p>Because conda caches&nbsp;,&nbsp;&nbsp;can grow to many gigabytes. And while conda links to shared packages in the cache, there is still a need to store some packages in the environment folder. This is mainly to avoid&nbsp;, where different environments need different versions of the same&nbsp;(a package required to run another package).</p><p>In addition, large, compiled binaries like&nbsp;<a href=\"https://opencv.org/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">OpenCV</a>&nbsp;may require&nbsp;&nbsp;in the environment’s directory, and each environment requires a copy of the Python interpreter (at 100–200 MB). All these issues can bloat conda environments to several gigabytes.</p><p>In this&nbsp;<em>Quick Success Data Science</em>&nbsp;project, we’ll look at some techniques for reducing the storage requirements for conda environments, including those stored in default locations and dedicated folders.</p><h2>Memory Management Techniques</h2><p>Below are some <a href=\"https://towardsdatascience.com/tag/memory-management/\" title=\"Memory Management\">Memory Management</a> techniques that will help you reduce conda’s storage footprint on your machine. We’ll discuss each in turn.</p><ol><li>Sharing task-based environments</li><li>Archiving with environment and specifications files</li><li>Archiving environments with conda-pack</li><li>Storing environments on an external drive</li><li>Relocating the package cache</li><li>Using virtual environments ()</li></ol><h3>1. Cleaning the Package Cache</h3><p>Cleaning the package cache is the first and easiest step for freeing up memory. Even after deleting environments, conda keeps the related package files in the cache. You can free up space by removing these unused packages and their associated&nbsp;&nbsp;(compressed package files), logs,&nbsp;&nbsp;(metadata stored in conda), and temporary files.</p><p>Conda permits an optional “dry run” to see how much memory will be reclaimed. You’ll want to run this from either the terminal or Anaconda Prompt in your&nbsp;&nbsp;environment:</p><pre><code>conda clean --all --dry-run</code></pre><p>Here’s how this looks on my machine:</p><p>This process trimmed a healthy 6.28 GB and took several minutes to run.</p><h3>2. Sharing Task-based Environments</h3><p>Creating a few environments for&nbsp;&nbsp;— like computer vision or geospatial work — is more memory efficient than using dedicated environments for each&nbsp;. These environments would include basic packages plus ones for the specific task (such as OpenCV, scikit-image, and PIL for computer vision).</p><p>An advantage of this approach is that you can easily keep all the packages up to date and link the environments to multiple projects. However, this won’t work if some projects require different versions of the shared packages.</p><h3>3. Archiving with Environment and Specifications Files</h3><p>If you don’t have enough storage sites or want to preserve legacy projects efficiently, consider using&nbsp;&nbsp;or&nbsp;files. These small files record an environment’s&nbsp;, allowing you to rebuild it later.</p><p>Saving conda environments in this manner reduces their size on disk from gigabytes to a few kilobytes. Of course, you’ll have to recreate the environment to use it. So, you’ll want to avoid this technique if you frequently revisit projects that link to the archived environments.</p><blockquote><p>NOTE: Consider using&nbsp;<a href=\"https://mamba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Mamba</a>, a drop-in replacement for conda, for faster rebuilds. As the docs say, “If you know conda, you know Mamba!”</p></blockquote><p>&nbsp;An&nbsp;&nbsp;is a small file that lists all the packages and versions installed in an environment, including those installed using Python’s package installer (<a href=\"https://pypi.org/project/pip/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">pip</a>). This helps you both restore an environment and share it with others.</p><p>The environment file is written in&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"></a>&nbsp;(), a human-readable data-serialization format for data storage. To generate an environment file, you must activate and then export the environment. Here’s how to make a file for an environment named&nbsp;:</p><pre><code> conda activate my_env\n conda env export &gt; my_env.yml</code></pre><p>You can name the file any valid filename but be careful as an existing file with the same name will be overwritten.</p><p>By default, the environment file is written to the&nbsp;directory. Here’s a truncated example of the file’s contents:</p><pre><code>name: C:\\Users\\hanna\\quick_success\\fed_hikes\\fed_env\nchannels:\n  - defaults\n  - conda-forge\ndependencies:\n  - asttokens=2.0.5=pyhd3eb1b0_0\n  - backcall=0.2.0=pyhd3eb1b0_0\n  - blas=1.0=mkl\n  - bottleneck=1.3.4=py310h9128911_0\n  - brotli=1.0.9=ha925a31_2\n  - bzip2=1.0.8=he774522_0\n  - ca-certificates=2022.4.26=haa95532_0\n  - certifi=2022.5.18.1=py310haa95532_0\n  - colorama=0.4.4=pyhd3eb1b0_0\n  - cycler=0.11.0=pyhd3eb1b0_0\n  - debugpy=1.5.1=py310hd77b12b_0\n  - decorator=5.1.1=pyhd3eb1b0_0\n  - entrypoints=0.4=py310haa95532_0\n\n  ------SNIP------</code></pre><p>You can now remove your conda environment and reproduce it again with this file. To remove an environment, first deactivate it and then run the&nbsp;&nbsp;command (where&nbsp;&nbsp;is the name of your environment):</p><pre><code>conda deactivate\nconda remove -n ENVNAME --all</code></pre><p>If the conda environment exists outside of Anaconda’s default&nbsp;&nbsp;folder, then include the directory path to the environment, as so:</p><pre><code>conda remove -p PATH\\ENVNAME --all</code></pre><p>Note that this archiving technique will only work perfectly if you continue to use the same operating system, such as Windows or macOS. This is because solving for dependencies can introduce packages that might not be compatible across platforms.</p><p>To restore a conda environment using a file, run the following, where&nbsp;&nbsp;represents your conda environment name and&nbsp;&nbsp;represents your environment file:</p><pre><code> conda env create -n my_env -f \\directory\\path\\to\\environment.yml</code></pre><p>You can also use the environment file to recreate the environment on your D: drive. Just provide the new path when using the file. Here’s an example:</p><pre><code>conda create --prefix D:\\my_envs\\my_new_env --file environment.yml</code></pre><p>For more on environment files, including how to manually produce them, visit the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">docs</a>.</p><p><strong>Using Specifications Files:&nbsp;</strong>If you haven’t installed any packages using pip, you can use a&nbsp;&nbsp;to reproduce a conda environment on the same operating system. To create a specification file, activate an environment, such as&nbsp;, and enter the following command:</p><pre><code> conda list --explicit &gt; exp_spec_list.txt</code></pre><p>This produces the following output, truncated for brevity:</p><pre><code> # This file may be used to create an environment using:\n # $ conda create --name &lt;env&gt; --file &lt;this file&gt;\n # platform: win-64\n @EXPLICIT\n https://conda.anaconda.org/conda-forge/win-64/ca-certificates-202x.xx.x-h5b45459_0.tar.bz2\n https://conda.anaconda.org/conda-forge/noarch/tzdata-202xx-he74cb21_0.tar.bz2\n\n------snip------</code></pre><p>Note that the&nbsp;&nbsp;flag ensures that the targeted platform is annotated in the file, in this case,&nbsp;&nbsp;in the third line.</p><p>You can now remove the environment as described in the previous section.</p><p>To re-create&nbsp;&nbsp;using this text file, run the following with a proper directory path:</p><pre><code>conda create -n my_env -f \\directory\\path\\to\\exp_spec_list.txt</code></pre><h3>4. Archiving Environments with conda-pack</h3><p>The&nbsp;&nbsp;command lets you archive a conda environment before removing it. It packs the entire environment into a compressed archive with the extension:&nbsp;. It’s handy for backing up, sharing, and moving environments without the need to reinstall packages.</p><p>The following command will preserve an environment but remove it from your system (where&nbsp;&nbsp;represents the name of your environment):</p><pre><code>conda install -c conda-forge conda-pack\nconda pack -n my_env -o my_env.tar.gz</code></pre><p>To restore the environment later run this command:</p><pre><code>mkdir my_env &amp;&amp; tar -xzf my_env.tar.gz -C my_env</code></pre><p>This technique won’t save as much memory as the text file option. However, you won’t need to re-download packages when restoring an environment, which means it can be used without internet access.</p><h3>5. Storing Environments on an External Drive</h3><p>By default, conda stores all environments in a default location. For Windows, this is under the&nbsp;&nbsp;folder. You can see these environments by running the command&nbsp;&nbsp;in a prompt window or terminal. Here’s how it looks on my C: drive (this is a truncated view):</p><p><strong>Using a Single Environments Folder:</strong>&nbsp;If your system supports an external or secondary drive, you can configure conda to store environments there to free up space on your primary disk. Here’s the command; you’ll need to substitute your specific path:</p><pre><code>conda config --set envs_dirs /path/to/external/drive</code></pre><p>If you enter a path to your D drive, such as&nbsp;, conda will create new environments at this location.</p><p>This technique works well when your external drive is a fast SSD and when you’re storing packages with large dependencies, like TensorFlow. The downside is slower performance. If your OS and notebooks remain on the primary drive, you may experience some read/write latency when running Python.</p><p>In addition, some OS settings may power down idle external drives, adding a delay when they spin back up. Tools like Jupyter may struggle to locate conda environments if the drive letter changes, so you’ll want to use a fixed drive letter and ensure that the correct kernel paths are set.</p><p><strong>Using Multiple Environment Folders:</strong>&nbsp;Instead of using a single&nbsp;&nbsp;directory for&nbsp;&nbsp;environments, you can store each environment inside its respective&nbsp;&nbsp;folder. This lets you store everything related to a project in one place.</p><p>For example, suppose you have a project on your Windows D: drive in a folder called&nbsp;. To place the project’s conda environment in this folder, loaded with&nbsp;&nbsp;for JupyterLab, you would run:</p><pre><code>conda create -p D:\\projects\\geospatial\\env ipykernel</code></pre><p>Of course, you can call&nbsp;&nbsp;something more descriptive, like&nbsp;.</p><p>As with the previous example, environments stored on a different disk can cause performance issues.</p><p><strong>Special Note on JupyterLab:</strong>&nbsp;Depending on how you launch JupyterLab, its default behavior may be to open in your&nbsp;&nbsp;directory (such as,&nbsp;). Since its file browser is restricted to the directory from which it is launched, you won’t see directories on other drives like&nbsp;. There are many ways to handle this, but one of the simplest is to launch JupyterLab from the D: drive.</p><p>For example, in Anaconda Prompt, type:</p><p>Now, you will be able to pick from kernels on the D: drive.</p><p>For more options on changing JupyterLab’s working directory, ask an AI about “how to change Jupyter’s default working directory” or “how to create a Symlink to&nbsp;&nbsp;in your user folder.”</p><p><strong>Moving Existing Environments:</strong>&nbsp;You should never manually move a conda environment, such as by cutting and pasting to a new location. This is because conda relies on internal paths and metadata that can become invalid with location changes.</p><p>Instead, you should&nbsp;existing environments to another drive. This will&nbsp;&nbsp;the environment, so you’ll need to manually remove it from its original location.</p><p>In the following example, we use the&nbsp;&nbsp;flag to produce an exact copy of a C: drive environment (called&nbsp;) on the D: drive:</p><pre><code>conda create -p D:\\new_envs\\my_env --clone C:\\path\\to\\old\\env</code></pre><blockquote><p>&nbsp;Consider exporting your environment to a&nbsp;&nbsp;file (as described in Section 3 above) before cloning. This allows you to recreate the environment if something goes wrong with the clone procedure.</p></blockquote><p>Now, when you run&nbsp;, you’ll see the environment listed in both the C: and D: drives. You can remove the old environment by running the following command in the&nbsp;environment:</p><pre><code>conda remove --name my_env --all -y</code></pre><p>Again, latency issues may affect these setups if you’re working across two disks.</p><p>You may be wondering, is it better to move a conda environment using an environment (YAML) file or to use? The short answer is that&nbsp;&nbsp;is the best and fastest option for moving an environment to a different drive on the&nbsp;&nbsp;machine. An environment file is best for recreating the same environment on a&nbsp;machine. While the file guarantees a consistent environment across different systems, it can take much longer to run, especially with large environments.</p><h3>6. Relocating the Package Cache</h3><p>If your primary drive is low on space, you can move the package cache to a larger external or secondary drive using this command:</p><pre><code>conda config --set pkgs_dirs D:\\conda_pkgs</code></pre><p>In this example, packages are now stored on the D drive () instead of the default location.</p><p>If you’re working in your primary drive and both drives are SSD, then latency issues should not be significant. However, if one of the drives is a slower HDD, you can experience slowdowns when creating or updating environments. If D: is an external drive connected by USB, you may see significant slowdowns for large environments.</p><p>You can mitigate some of these issues by keeping the package cache () and frequently used environments on the faster SSD, and other environments on the slower HDD.</p><p>One last thing to consider is&nbsp;. Primary drives may have routine backups scheduled but secondary or external drives may not. This puts you at risk of losing all your environments.</p><h3>7. Using Virtual Environments</h3><p>If your project doesn’t require conda’s extensive package management system for handling heavy dependencies (like TensorFlow or GDAL), you can significantly reduce disk usage with a Python&nbsp;&nbsp;(). This represents a lightweight alternative to a conda environment.</p><p>To create a&nbsp;&nbsp;named&nbsp;, run the following command:</p><p>This type of environment has a small base installation. A minimal conda environment takes up about 200 MB and includes multiple utilities, such as&nbsp;,&nbsp;,&nbsp;, and so on. A&nbsp;&nbsp;is much lighter, with a minimum install size of only 5–10 MB.</p><p>Conda also caches package tarballs in&nbsp;. These tarballs can grow to several GBs over time. Because&nbsp;&nbsp;installs packages directly into the environment, no extra copies are preserved.</p><p>In general, you’ll want to consider&nbsp;&nbsp;when you only need basic Python packages like NumPy, pandas, or Scikit-learn. Packages for which conda is strongly recommended, like Geopandas, should still be placed in a conda environment. If you use lots of environments, you’ll probably want to stick with conda and benefit from its package linking.</p><p>You can find details on how to activate and use Python virtual environments in the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">docs</a>.</p><p>High impact/low disruption memory management techniques for conda environments include cleaning the package cache and storing little-used environments as YAML or text files. These methods can save many gigabytes of memory while retaining Anaconda’s default directory structure.</p><p>Other high impact methods include moving the package cache and/or conda environments to a secondary or external drive. This will resolve memory problems but may introduce latency issues, especially if the new drive is a slow HDD or uses a USB connection.</p><p>For simple environments, you can use a Python virtual environment () as a lightweight alternative to conda.<a href=\"https://medium.com/@lee_vaughan?source=post_page---post_author_info--3aa2791a7623---------------------------------------\"></a></p>","contentLength":15200,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"[Boost]","url":"https://dev.to/aramb-dev/-19ij","date":1740086235,"author":"Abdur-Rahman","guid":7442,"unread":true,"content":"<h2>Developers, You’re Missing Out on These 35+ Open-Source Gems!</h2>","contentLength":63,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"How I created a dynamic human like ai model","url":"https://dev.to/okerew/how-i-created-a-dynamic-human-like-ai-model-4ld4","date":1740080479,"author":"Okerew","guid":7392,"unread":true,"content":"<p>My journey toward AI development didn’t start with artificial intelligence at all—it began with biology. I was originally more interested in how living systems function, especially the human brain. Over time, this curiosity led me to informatics, where I explored structured data processing, algorithms, and computation. Neural networks became the bridge between these two fields, offering a way to model intelligence computationally.</p><p>However, developing an actual model capable of anything beyond basic pattern recognition required years of accumulated knowledge. It wasn’t just about training a large language model or improving embeddings—it was about understanding how intelligence forms, how it maintains coherence, and how it adapts dynamically.</p><p>The Model: Key Features and Challenges</p><p>The model I eventually developed what is highly dynamic in its learning. It doesn’t rely on large-scale pre-training datasets; instead, it learns from almost any input it receives, allowing it to generalize from minimal data.</p><p>Some of the core features I implemented include:\n    1.  Reflection-Based Memory System – Unlike traditional models that rely solely on weights and embeddings, this system allows the model to evaluate past information in a more structured way. It can recall prior interactions in a meaningful sequence rather than just retrieving high-probability tokens.<p>\n    2.  Working Memory System – Inspired by human cognition, this feature lets the model maintain temporary context over longer sequences, helping it stay coherent across interactions.</p>\n    3.  Context Understanding – The model can analyze the structure of a given input and derive meaning beyond simple word associations. This helps it pick up on names, verbs, and sentence structures efficiently, even with limited training data.<p>\n    4.  Reverse Problem-Solving Pathways – Instead of following a linear problem-solving process, the model can work backward from a goal, evaluating multiple pathways to determine the most efficient or novel solution.</p>\n    5.  Emergent Identity Formation – One of the most surprising results was that the model began forming a kind of proto-identity. It repeatedly assigned itself specific names, reinforcing them over time, despite not being explicitly programmed to do so.

These APIs are at the heart of many modern applications, driving automation, customer interaction, and sophisticated data analysis. However, with this increased use comes a need for organizations to effectively monitor and manage the costs and consumption of these APIs. Understanding how different customers and applications interact with your APIs is crucial to maintaining profitability and ensuring efficient resource use.</p><p>In this blog post, we’ll explore how Moesif can help organizations achieve full observability into their AI APIs. We’ll discuss common challenges like cost tracking, consumption monitoring, and how Moesif’s capabilities can simplify cost attribution, helping you stay in control of your AI-related expenditures. We'll also look into best practices for managing costs and ways to improve profitability using data-driven insights.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  The Challenge of Understanding Costs in AI APIs\n</h2><p>AI-powered APIs, especially those relying on LLMs such as OpenAI's models, introduce unique challenges when it comes to understanding costs. Unlike traditional APIs, the cost of LLM-based APIs can vary significantly depending on the nature of each request. Factors like the complexity of prompts, the volume of data processed, and compute intensity can all impact costs. This variability makes it challenging for organizations to maintain predictability and control over their operational expenses.</p><p>For AI businesses to maintain a sustainable financial model, it’s essential to <a href=\"https://www.moesif.com/blog/technical/api-development/Optimizing-Profits-Calculating-and-Reporting-COGS-for-Your-OpenAI-Powered-API/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">calculate the Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) accurately</a>. This requires comprehensive tracking of direct expenses, such as provider fees for AI models, as well as indirect costs, like infrastructure and server maintenance. Without accurate cost tracking, businesses risk running into budget overruns and profitability issues. Moesif offers a detailed view into these cost components by monitoring API interactions in real time, providing valuable insights that help ensure you are fully aware of what is driving your COGS.</p><p>With Moesif’s capabilities, organizations can set up <a href=\"https://www.moesif.com/features/api-dashboards\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">custom dashboards</a> that provide detailed breakdowns of costs by different dimensions, such as request type, endpoint, or customer segment. This level of detail empowers finance and engineering teams to work together to optimize both cost efficiency and performance. By identifying where costs are highest and why, organizations can make informed decisions to improve their overall API strategy.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Identifying High-Cost Customers\n</h2><p>One significant challenge that many companies face is identifying which customers are responsible for the bulk of their API costs. Different users interact with AI APIs in varying ways—some use straightforward, low-cost requests, while others may make highly complex or frequent requests that drive up costs considerably. This disparity in usage often means that a small percentage of customers contribute disproportionately to the overall API expenses.</p><p>Moesif provides granular visibility into customer-specific API usage, enabling organizations to pinpoint which users are contributing most to operational expenses. With these insights, companies can make informed decisions about implementing tiered pricing models, optimizing customer usage, or even adjusting service levels to better align with their costs. By using Moesif, businesses can create user segmentation based on usage intensity and cost impact, allowing for more personalized communication and pricing adjustments.</p><p>For example, a SaaS company offering an AI-based API could use Moesif to identify customers that frequently make high-cost API calls. By understanding these usage patterns, the company could introduce premium pricing plans tailored to customers who derive significant value from more intensive API use. Alternatively, they could work with these customers to optimize their API requests, potentially reducing their own costs while improving efficiency for the customer.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Monitoring Consumption for LLM APIs\n</h2><p>Large Language Models are powerful tools, but their cost structure can be challenging. The way customers use LLMs—such as making complex queries or frequent calls—can directly affect the overall expenses. In particular, queries that require significant computational power, such as those with extensive context or specialized responses, can increase the cost per request. Moesif enables real-time monitoring of LLM consumption, helping companies understand usage patterns that lead to higher costs.</p><p>By analyzing customer interaction data, businesses can identify usage trends that may be leading to inefficiencies. For example, if a small subset of customers is responsible for an outsized portion of LLM costs, organizations can engage with those customers to optimize prompt usage or even shift them to a more cost-effective pricing tier. This level of insight allows companies to fine-tune their API strategy to manage costs without compromising customer satisfaction.</p><p>Moesif also allows for proactive alerts and notifications. If a customer’s usage suddenly spikes, leading to higher-than-expected costs, teams can be alerted in real-time. This enables companies to take immediate action—such as reaching out to customers to understand the changes in their usage patterns, offering guidance on more efficient usage, or implementing rate limiting to prevent runaway costs.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Breaking Down Costs by Tenant\n</h2><p>For companies that operate multi-tenant SaaS products, understanding the cost of supporting each tenant is essential. Moesif offers the ability to attribute costs accurately on a per-tenant basis, helping businesses understand how much each client is contributing to the overall expenditure. Tenant-level cost attribution provides crucial visibility that helps in financial planning and customer profitability analysis.</p><p>This tenant-level visibility is especially valuable for SaaS providers who need to assess the financial impact of different tenants. By accurately attributing costs to each tenant, companies can make better decisions about pricing, resource allocation, and even customer support prioritization. For instance, if a particular tenant is driving significantly higher costs compared to others, the business can investigate why this is happening and whether it makes sense to adjust the pricing structure or impose usage limits.</p><p>Additionally, having detailed insights into tenant-level costs allows businesses to better understand the value they provide to their customers. By correlating revenue generated from each tenant with their respective costs, companies can determine which customers are most profitable and which may need more attention to ensure they are a sustainable part of the business. This enables data-driven discussions with customers about the value they are receiving and potential ways to optimize their usage.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  How to Use Moesif to Monitor and Manage Costs\n</h2><p>To achieve effective cost monitoring and control with Moesif, follow these steps:</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Driving Profitability with Moesif\n</h2><p>Moesif doesn’t just help you monitor costs—it also helps optimize profitability.

Understanding APIs in Plain Language\n</h3><p>Before we jump into the how-to, let’s clear up what an <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/API\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">API</a> really is. In simple terms, an API (Application Programming Interface) is like a messenger that takes your request, tells a system what you want to do, and then returns the result back to you. Think of it as ordering at your favorite restaurant. You don’t need to know how the kitchen works; you simply place your order, and a well-trained waiter takes care of the rest.<a href=\"https://www.ibm.com/cloud/learn/api\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Discover more on API fundamentals</a> • <a href=\"https://restfulapi.net/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">API Explained Simply</a></p><p>APIs make it possible for different software systems to communicate seamlessly. Instead of building every feature from scratch, you can tap into services that already exist, making your project faster, more reliable, and cost-effective. And the best part? You don’t need to be a seasoned coder to use them.<a href=\"https://www.programmableweb.com\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Explore API integration</a> • <a href=\"https://swagger.io\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Modern API Practices</a></p><h3>\n  \n  \n  2. Why “Make Your API in Minutes—Forget the Code” Is a Game-Changer\n</h3><p>The idea behind making your API quickly is rooted in simplicity and speed. Many modern platforms are built to allow users—yes, even non-programmers—to create powerful connections between applications with just a few clicks. Here’s why this approach can be a total game-changer:</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  3. Step-by-Step Guide: Creating Your API Without Writing Code\n</h3><p>Now that you understand the benefits, let’s break down the process into actionable steps. Follow these simple instructions to build your API and start connecting your digital world.</p><h4><strong>Step 1: Choose the Right Platform</strong></h4><p>Not all platforms are created equal, so your first task is to choose one that fits your needs. Look for platforms that advertise “<a href=\"https://www.nocode.tech\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">no-code</a>” or “<a href=\"https://www.outsystems.com\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">low-code</a>” API creation. These platforms usually offer drag-and-drop interfaces, pre-built templates, and integration tools that simplify the process.</p><p> Consider platforms like <a href=\"https://zapier.com\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Zapier</a> or <a href=\"https://www.make.com/en\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Make</a> (formerly Integromat), which allow you to integrate various services without any coding. These tools let you automate workflows by connecting apps such as email, databases, and social media.<a href=\"https://www.g2.com/categories/no-code-development\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Explore more no-code platforms</a></p><h4><strong>Step 2: Define Your API’s Purpose</strong></h4><p>Before setting up your API, clearly define what you want it to do. Are you pulling data from one service to display on a website? Or perhaps you’re looking to automate data entry between applications? Write down your goal in simple language. A clear purpose will guide your setup and help you choose the right integrations.</p><h4><strong>Step 3: Configure Your Data and Endpoints</strong></h4><p>APIs work by handling requests and sending back responses. In a no-code environment, this usually means selecting data sources and defining <a href=\"https://restfulapi.net/resource/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">endpoints</a>, the specific URLs or actions that your API will handle.</p><p> Most platforms will provide a visual interface where you can simply drag and drop elements to create endpoints. Follow the guided prompts and test each endpoint to ensure it behaves as expected.<a href=\"https://www.bubble.io\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Visual API Builders</a> • <a href=\"https://www.outsystems.com\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Drag-and-Drop API Tools</a></p><h4><strong>Step 4: Test and Validate Your API</strong></h4><p>Testing is a crucial part of the process. Don’t worry—no code means no complicated debugging. Use the built-in testing tools provided by your platform. Run a few sample requests to see if your API is returning the correct data.</p><p> If your API is supposed to fetch customer details, send a test request using a dummy customer ID. Verify that the response includes all the necessary information, such as name, email, and contact number.<a href=\"https://www.postman.com\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">API Testing Tools</a> • <a href=\"https://www.softwaretestinghelp.com/api-testing/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Testing Best Practices</a></p><p>Even though you’re not writing code, security should always be a priority. Most platforms offer simple security features like <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/glossary/api-key/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">API keys</a> or <a href=\"https://jwt.io/introduction/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">token-based authentication</a>. Enable these features to ensure that only authorized users can access your API.</p><p> Some users worry about security in a no-code environment. The reassuring fact is that reputable platforms invest heavily in security measures. Make sure you follow the platform’s guidelines and use strong, unique credentials.<a href=\"https://owasp.org/www-project-api-security/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">OWASP API Security</a> • <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/what-is-an-api/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Secure Your API</a></p><h4><strong>Step 6: Deploy and Monitor</strong></h4><p>Once your API is configured, tested, and secured, it’s time to deploy. Many no-code platforms provide one-click deployment options. After deployment, keep an eye on how your API is performing. Use monitoring tools to track usage, response times, and any potential errors.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  4. Real-Life Examples and Anecdotes\n</h3><p>Let’s bring these steps to life with a couple of real-world scenarios that show how easy it can be to create an API without writing a single line of code.</p><h4><strong>Example 1: Automating Your Newsletter Signup</strong></h4><p>Imagine you run a small business and want to send a welcome email every time someone signs up for your newsletter. Instead of manually adding each new subscriber to your mailing list, you can set up an API that automatically transfers the subscriber’s data from your website to your email marketing tool.</p><ul><li> Choose a no-code platform like <a href=\"https://zapier.com\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Zapier</a>.</li><li> Define your API’s purpose: “Transfer subscriber details automatically.”</li><li> Set up the endpoint that captures the signup data.</li><li> Test by signing up with a dummy email.</li><li> Secure the connection with an <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/glossary/api-key/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">API key</a>.</li><li> Deploy and monitor to ensure every new signup triggers the welcome email.</li></ul><h4><strong>Example 2: Integrating Sales Data for Quick Insights</strong></h4><p>Consider a scenario where you need to integrate sales data from an e-commerce platform with your internal reporting tool. With a no-code API, you can set up a connection that pulls daily sales figures and updates your dashboard automatically. This allows you to make data-driven decisions without waiting for manual reports.</p><ul><li> Pick a platform that supports integration between e-commerce and reporting tools.</li><li> Clearly define your API’s role: “Sync daily sales data.”</li><li> Map out the data fields needed (e.g., sales numbers, dates).</li><li> Test the endpoint with sample sales data.</li><li> Deploy and monitor the performance daily, tweaking settings as necessary.</li></ul><h3>\n  \n  \n  5. Overcoming Common Challenges and Objections\n</h3><p>You might be wondering, “What if I run into problems?” or “Can a no-code solution really handle my complex needs?” Let’s address these concerns head-on.</p><h4><strong>Challenge: Limited Customization</strong></h4><p>Some worry that no-code solutions might not offer the flexibility they need. While it’s true that advanced customizations might require coding, many no-code platforms have evolved significantly. They now support a wide range of integrations and provide enough customization for most business needs. If you ever hit a limitation, you can usually integrate a custom module or switch to a hybrid approach where a small amount of code is added.<a href=\"https://www.outsystems.com\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Customization Options</a> • <a href=\"https://www.mendix.com\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Hybrid Development</a></p><h4><strong>Challenge: Security Concerns</strong></h4><p>As mentioned earlier, security is paramount. Even if you’re not coding, the platform you choose must adhere to strict security protocols. Do your homework—read reviews, check for certifications, and understand the platform’s security features. Reputable platforms invest heavily in keeping your data safe, so use their built-in tools without fear.<a href=\"https://owasp.org/www-project-api-security/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Security Best Practices</a> • <a href=\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/security/what-is-cybersecurity.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Data Protection</a></p><h4><strong>Objection: “I’m Not Tech-Savvy Enough”</strong></h4><p>The beauty of <a href=\"https://www.nocode.tech\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">no-code</a> APIs is that they’re designed with you in mind.

It uses a <strong>Computer-Using Agent (CUA)</strong> model (built on GPT-4o) to interpret screenshots and perform clicks and typing on websites. In theory, this means you can ask Operator to do tedious online chores – filling forms, booking appointments, data entry, etc. – and it will carry them out on its own. In practice, however, Operator is still a research preview with many kinks to iron out. It often pauses for human help on tricky steps, and its execution can be slow or error-prone. This article provides an overview of Operator’s current capabilities and dives into its key limitations, examining how these reflect broader trends in automation tools.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Overview of the Operator Agent\n</h2><p>Operator acts as a semi-autonomous browser assistant. You give it a goal (for example, “Find a flight from NYC to LA next Friday under $300 and hold it for booking”), and it will open a remote browser session to attempt the task. It  the web page via screenshots and  or  as needed on buttons, links, and form fields. This approach lets Operator work with most websites without site-specific integrations – essentially treating the web interface like a human user would. Operator is currently available only to ChatGPT Pro subscribers in the U.S., since it’s in a limited research release. Notably, OpenAI has built in many safety checks: Operator always asks for user confirmation before doing anything sensitive (for instance, entering credit card details or finalizing a purchase). It will also hand control back to you if it encounters something it can’t handle, ensuring you stay in charge of critical steps.</p><p>While the vision of Operator is exciting – an AI that can handle “any software tool designed for humans” by using the standard web UI – the current reality is more limited. Early users and testers have identified several constraints and rough edges. Let’s explore the most prominent limitations of Operator in its present state.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Human Verification Hurdles (CAPTCHAs, OTPs, and 2FA)\n</h2><p>One immediate roadblock for Operator is dealing with  checkpoints. Tasks that involve CAPTCHAs, one-time passwords (OTP), or two-factor authentication (2FA) inevitably require a flesh-and-blood user to step in. OpenAI has explicitly designed Operator to pause and prompt the user whenever it hits a CAPTCHA or a password/verification field. In other words, the AI won’t (and largely ) solve these challenges on its own. If Operator needs to log into a website and the site presents a reCAPTCHA test or sends a 2FA code, Operator will stop and ask you to handle it before continuing.</p><p>This limitation makes sense – CAPTCHAs and multi-factor prompts are specifically designed to foil automated bots – but it does mean <strong>Operator isn’t fully hands-off</strong>. Any workflow that involves signing in to accounts, confirming identity via text/email codes, or proving “I’m not a robot” will <strong>require user intervention</strong>. This interrupts the automation and can be a bottleneck if your task crosses multiple secure sites. Until AI agents can reliably handle or legally bypass such verifications, tools like Operator will need to partner with the user on those steps, limiting true end-to-end automation.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Struggles with Complex UI Elements (e.g. Date Pickers)\n</h2><p>Operator also struggles with <strong>complex or non-standard web interfaces</strong>. While it’s competent at clicking basic buttons and typing into text fields, it can get confused by more intricate widgets – the kind of elements that often trip up even traditional scripts, like custom date pickers, drag-and-drop interfaces, or interactive charts. Operator perceives the page visually and decides where to click based on its understanding, but modern web UIs often involve hidden state or hover effects that aren’t obvious from a static screenshot. Date range selectors, sliders, or multi-step forms might not register correctly with the agent’s current vision-to-action model.</p><p>These examples highlight a core challenge:  can confuse the AI. Until Operator can improve its understanding of UI behavior, complex widgets remain a stumbling block that often requires either manual correction or careful prompt tuning to navigate.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Page Loading Glitches and Unintended Tab Openings\n</h2><p>Another limitation observed is Operator’s occasional <strong>stumbles in page loading and navigation</strong>, sometimes resulting in blank pages or extra browser tabs being opened unexpectedly. Because Operator operates a remote browser, there can be latency or synchronization issues where a page doesn’t load fully before the agent acts. Users have reported cases where Operator scrolled through a webpage extremely slowly, even looping back upwards until manually refreshed.</p><p>There have also been reports of Operator spawning multiple tabs or windows during a task, which can be disorienting. If a prompt leads it to click a link that opens in a new tab (or if Operator tries to run multiple subtasks in parallel), users might suddenly find several browser tabs controlled by Operator. The current interface doesn’t provide an obvious way to manage or close these extra tabs, leading to clutter.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Lack of Session Management and Cookie Control\n</h2><p>At the moment, Operator provides no easy way to manage sessions or cookies during tasks. There is <strong>no “new incognito session” or cookie clearing feature</strong> exposed to the user. This means that all tasks you run in Operator potentially share the same browser state (unless you manually log out of sites or use different accounts). The lack of session isolation can be problematic for both security and consistency, as Operator might behave differently depending on stored cookies or previous login states. Future versions might introduce options to reset or compartmentalize sessions, but for now, users should treat Operator’s browser like a persistent environment.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Performance and Stability Limitations\n</h2><p>Perhaps one of the biggest pain points early users have highlighted is that Operator is . The agent performs actions at a markedly lower speed than a human operator would in many cases. Each click, scroll, or keystroke is done methodically, often taking a second or two per action. Over dozens of actions, this sluggishness adds up.</p><p>Beyond just speed, stability is an issue. Operator can sometimes  – looping infinitely on a task step or freezing up such that it has to be stopped. While outright application crashes haven’t been widely reported, these stalls require human intervention to fix, making true automation difficult.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  No Scheduling or Background Task Support\n</h2><p>Another limitation is the lack of any built-in <strong>scheduling or continuous run capability</strong>. You cannot schedule Operator to perform a task at a later time or run a task on a recurring schedule (e.g. “check my stock portfolio every hour”). Likewise, Operator doesn’t run as a background service; each task is initiated interactively and runs only in that session. If you close the Operator session, the task stops. While scheduling features may come in future updates, for now, Operator functions more like an on-demand assistant than a fully autonomous agent.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Conclusion: Usability Impact and Future Outlook\n</h2><p>The current limitations of OpenAI’s Operator significantly impact its usability. In its present state, Operator often <strong>requires as much hand-holding as the tasks it’s supposed to automate</strong>. Human verification steps, frequent confirmation prompts, and the need to babysit its slow or error-prone execution mean that, for many tasks, it can be faster and easier to just do it yourself. The tool also lacks some of the conveniences expected of mature automation software, like session isolation or scheduling, which further limits how and where it can be applied.</p><p>On the positive side, Operator is a , and there’s reason to expect rapid improvement. OpenAI has hinted at major upgrades to address speed and reliability, better authentication methods, and possible API integrations to streamline operations. In the long run, Operator could become a powerful automation tool, but for now, it remains a <strong>promising but flawed prototype</strong>. AI-powered agents have immense potential, but as Operator shows, true web automation is still a work in progress.</p>","contentLength":8377,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Ultimate Project Listing Hack: Skyrocket Your Product Launch Overnight!","url":"https://dev.to/resource_bunk_1077cab07da/ultimate-project-listing-hack-skyrocket-your-product-launch-overnight-3egm","date":1740075240,"author":"Resource Bunk","guid":7363,"unread":true,"content":"<p>Launching a product isn’t about throwing something out there and hoping it sticks—it’s about crafting a smart, targeted strategy that reaches the right audience at the right time.

Instead, focus on simple, composable solutions that integrate AI into proven tools like PostgreSQL. This approach avoids technical debt and builds more maintainable systems by solving specific problems effectively.</p><p>The AI tooling landscape resembles a gold rush. New frameworks pop up daily, each claiming to be the solution for building AI applications. But in an attempt to solve every possible use case, they introduce layers of abstraction that make systems harder to understand, debug, and maintain.</p><p>This seems familiar: NoSQL, serverless, microservices. Each promised simplicity but just shifted complexity elsewhere. </p><p>AI is no different. An application leveraging LLMs is still just an app. Ninety percent of what we’ve learned in software engineering still applies. The best solutions don’t replace what works—they build on it.</p><p>The Siren Song of Complete Solutions\nLangChain, the most popular AI application framework today, promises to be a comprehensive solution for building LLM applications. While it's an impressive piece of engineering, it exemplifies the \"do everything\" approach that plagues the field.</p><p>A typical RAG (retrieval-augmented generation) app that retrieves relevant documents and uses them to answer a question looks like this according to <a href=\"https://python.langchain.com/docs/tutorials/rag/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Langchain’s example docs</a>:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>This \"simple\" example introduces seven new concepts: StateGraphs, sequences, graph builders, vector stores, splitters, documents, and loaders. And that’s on top of concepts that engineers need to understand to build a RAG app in the first place: vector similarity search, chunks, embeddings, and, of course, large language models (LLMs). Yet, even these foundational concepts aren't left untouched: They're wrapped in LangChain's own implementations. OpenAIEmbeddings isn't the official OpenAI client but rather LangChain's wrapper. Even BeautifulSoup, a tried-and-true Python HTML parsing library, gets encapsulated in a custom Loader wrapper.</p><p>While LangChain lowers the barrier to entry for AI apps, many teams find that these abstractions become liabilities as projects scale. We’ve heard many stories of developers building MVPs of their RAG systems on LangChain, but tearing it up and re-building their app without a framework a month or so later. And we’re not alone; many AI engineering teams have written about their decision to move away from frameworks like LangChain—see examples <a href=\"https://www.octomind.dev/blog/why-we-no-longer-use-langchain-for-building-our-ai-agents\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">here</a>, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHwptVCfxyg\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">here</a>, <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/LLMDevs/comments/1hsfitm/not_using_langchain_ever/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">here</a>, <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/LangChain/comments/13fcw36/langchain_is_pointless/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">here</a>, <a href=\"https://minimaxir.com/2023/07/langchain-problem/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">here</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1d4p1t6/is_langchain_usable/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">here</a>.</p><p>There’s a common refrain behind all these stories: LangChain (and similar tools) buries engineers in layers of abstraction before they even reach prompt engineering, evals, and data management. These abstractions make debugging challenging when issues arise across multiple layers and also make customization and meeting specific application requirements challenging. Moreover, it creates an entire parallel vocabulary that maps to actual LLM operations, forcing engineers to learn two sets of concepts instead of one.</p><p>The fundamental irony is that modern programming languages already handle LLM primitives perfectly well. Unlike web frameworks that abstract away complex networking concepts or object-relational mappers (ORMs) that simplify database interactions, LLM operations work with surprisingly simple data types. Messages are just strings. Embeddings are just lists of floating-point numbers. Python's built-in types and basic control flow are already ideal for handling these primitives.So why not keep it simple, stupid?</p><p>Tools like <a href=\"https://github.com/BerriAI/litellm\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">LiteLLM</a> exemplify good AI tooling: They solve a single, well-defined problem by providing a unified interface for LLM provider APIs. No embedding management, no caching, no workflow orchestration—just one focused task done well.</p><p>This approach mirrors <a href=\"https://www.anthropic.com/research/building-effective-agents\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Anthropic's findings</a> about successful agent implementations. Instead of betting on monolithic frameworks, using simple, focused components leads to systems that are easier to understand, maintain, and evolve. We can then combine these basic building blocks to build solutions that exactly match our needs.</p><p>We recently added LiteLLM to <a href=\"https://github.com/timescale/pgai\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">pgai Vectorizer</a>, our tool for automating embedding creation and synchronization in PostgreSQL. This move enabled our PostgreSQL extension to support basically every embedding provider. It also saved us from having to integrate a new API for every provider. Kudos to LiteLLM. This was really helpful.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Integrating AI Into Existing Software Stacks\n</h2><p>The surge of AI-specific tools has led teams to overlook a fundamental truth: Most AI applications are still just applications at heart! And they need the same things that “non-AI applications” need: data persistence, authentication, business logic, and all the other components we've been building for decades. Successfully building an AI application today means choosing tools that complement and integrate with your existing infrastructure, not replacing your entire stack with AI-specific tools. </p><p>PostgreSQL, the well-known and loved relational database, is a great example of this. PostgreSQL has been the backbone of countless applications for over 30 years. Thanks to PostgreSQL extensions like <a href=\"https://www.timescale.com/learn/postgresql-extensions-pgvector\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">pgvector</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/timescale/pgai\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">pgai</a>, and <a href=\"https://github.com/timescale/pgvectorscale/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">pgvectorscale</a>, it can handle vector similarity search alongside relational queries. When building RAG functionality, many developers choose to stick with PostgreSQL, rather than choosing from the myriad new specialized vector databases like <a href=\"https://www.timescale.com/blog/pgvector-vs-pinecone\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Pinecone</a>, Chroma, and Qdrant, to name but a few. This isn't just about reducing complexity; it's about leveraging battle-tested technology that your team already knows how to operate, monitor, and scale.</p><p>Here’s how to implement simple semantic search across your product documentation in PostgreSQL. Instead of setting up a separate vector database and building synchronization logic, you can use pgvector and pgai to auto-embed your data and add vector search capabilities directly to your existing database:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>This single SQL command creates and maintains embeddings for your documentation automatically, similar to how PostgreSQL maintains an index. No separate service to deploy, no complex sync logic to debug, no additional failure modes to consider. Pgai is itself built with composability in mind, allowing you to combine different embedding, chunking, or other strategies together through simple, well-defined interfaces. Even if you decide not to use pgai Vectorizer, using pgvector itself saves you from maintaining yet another piece of infrastructure. This is AI tooling done well, in our humble opinion.</p><p>Following the principle of integrating into existing tools and frameworks for folks whose native language isn’t SQL, we also recently added <a href=\"https://github.com/timescale/pgai/blob/main/docs/vectorizer/python-integration.md\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">SQLAlchemy support for pgai</a>. Instead of learning yet another query language or API client, this lets you work with vector embeddings using the same query patterns as any Python application you’ve built before:\nclass Documentation(Base):</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>The nice thing about this is that your team can leverage their existing SQLAlchemy knowledge, and your vector search integrates seamlessly with your other queries and filters. To integrate this into your application, follow any existing SQLAlchemy + (insert web framework of your choice) guide. For any issues regarding query optimization, you can fall back on decades of PostgreSQL experience either in your team or in the community.</p><p>The AI tooling gold rush has created an ecosystem filled with abstractions looking for problems to solve. While the enthusiasm is understandable, we've seen how this pattern can lead to unnecessary complexity, technical debt, and, ultimately, harder-to-maintain systems. Instead of reinventing the wheel or building entire new ecosystems, the path forward lies in the thoughtful integration of AI capabilities into our existing, battle-tested tools. When evaluating AI tools for your stack, we suggest you follow these principles:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Choose boring technology:</strong> Favor tools that build upon existing, well-understood platforms rather than those that require wholesale replacement of working systems. PostgreSQL with pgvector might not be as shiny as the latest vector database, but it works just as well and brings decades of operational knowledge and reliability.</p></li><li><p> Look for tools that solve specific problems well and can be easily integrated with others. LiteLLM's focused approach to LLM API abstraction exemplifies this philosophy, as does pgai's integration with SQLAlchemy.</p></li><li><p><strong>Value developer experience:</strong> The best tools feel natural to use with your existing workflows. If the tools integrate well with existing stacks, this reduces your team's cognitive overhead.</p></li></ul><p><strong>Beware of \"all-in-one\" solutions:</strong> Tools that promise to solve every AI-related problem often create more complexity instead of eliminating it.\nWe built pgai with these principles in mind. It focuses on solving specific problems well: automating embedding synchronization through vectorizers, providing a clean interface for LLM interactions, and, most importantly, integrating seamlessly with existing PostgreSQL deployments. We believe this approach—building on proven foundations while adding new capabilities—is the sustainable path forward for AI development.</p>","contentLength":9414,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Generate synthetic counterparty (CR) risk data with generative AI using Amazon Bedrock LLMs and RAG","url":"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/generate-synthetic-counterparty-cr-risk-data-with-generative-ai-using-amazon-bedrock-llms-and-rag/","date":1740072265,"author":"Santosh Kulkarni","guid":7311,"unread":true,"content":"<p>Data is the lifeblood of modern applications, driving everything from application testing to <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/ai/machine-learning/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">machine learning</a> (ML) model training and evaluation. As data demands continue to surge, the emergence of <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/ai/generative-ai/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">generative AI</a> models presents an innovative solution. These <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/large-language-model/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">large language models</a> (LLMs), trained on expansive data corpora, possess the remarkable capability to generate new content across multiple media formats—text, audio, and video—and across various business domains, based on provided prompts and inputs.</p><p>In this post, we explore how you can use these LLMs with advanced <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/retrieval-augmented-generation/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Retrieval Augmented Generation</a> (RAG) to generate high-quality synthetic data for a finance domain use case. You can use the same technique for synthetic data for other business domain use cases as well. For this post, we demonstrate how to generate counterparty risk (CR) data, which would be beneficial for over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives that are traded directly between two parties, without going through a formal exchange.</p><p>OTC derivatives are typically customized contracts between counterparties and include a variety of financial instruments, such as forwards, options, swaps, and other structured products. A counterparty is the other party involved in a financial transaction. In the context of OTC derivatives, the counterparty refers to the entity (such as a bank, financial institution, corporation, or individual) with whom a derivative contract is made.</p><p>For example, in an OTC swap or option contract, one entity agrees to terms with another party, and each entity becomes the counterparty to the other. The responsibilities, obligations, and risks (such as credit risk) are shared between these two entities according to the contract.</p><p>As financial institutions continue to navigate the complex landscape of CR, the need for accurate and reliable risk assessment models has become paramount. For our use case, ABC Bank, a fictional financial services organization, has taken on the challenge of developing an ML model to assess the risk of a given counterparty based on their exposure to OTC derivative data.</p><p>Building such a model presents numerous challenges. Although ABC Bank has gathered a large dataset from various sources and in different formats, the data may be biased, skewed, or lack the diversity needed to train a highly accurate model. The primary challenge lies in collecting and preprocessing the data to make it suitable for training an ML model. Deploying a poorly suited model could result in misinformed decisions and significant financial losses.</p><p>We propose a generative AI solution that uses the RAG approach. RAG is a widely used approach that enhances LLMs by supplying extra information from external data sources not included in their original training. The entire solution can be broadly divided into three steps: indexing, data generation, and validation.</p><p>In the indexing step, we parse, chunk, and convert the representative CR data into vector format using the <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/amazon-models/titan/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Amazon Titan Text Embeddings V2</a> model and store this information in a Chroma vector database. Chroma is an open source vector database known for its ease of use, efficient similarity search, and support for multimodal data and metadata. It offers both in-memory and persistent storage options, integrates well with popular ML frameworks, and is suitable for a wide range of AI applications. It is particularly beneficial for smaller to medium-sized datasets and projects requiring local deployment or low resource usage. The following diagram illustrates this architecture.</p><p>Here are the steps for data indexing:</p><ul><li>The sample CR data is segmented into smaller, manageable chunks to optimize it for embedding generation.</li><li>These segmented data chunks are then passed to a method responsible for both generating embeddings and storing them efficiently.</li><li>The Amazon Titan Text Embeddings V2 API is called upon to generate high-quality embeddings from the prepared data chunks.</li><li>The resulting embeddings are then stored in the Chroma vector database, providing efficient retrieval and similarity searches for future use.</li></ul><p>When the user requests data for a certain scenario, the request is converted into vector format and then looked up in the Chroma database to find matches with the stored data. The retrieved data is augmented with the user request and additional prompts to <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/claude/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Anthropic’s Claude Haiku</a> on <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/claude/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Amazon Bedrock</a>. Anthropic’s Claude Haiku was chosen primarily for its speed, processing over 21,000 tokens per second, which significantly outpaces its peers. Moreover, Anthropic’s Claude Haiku’s efficiency in data generation is remarkable, with a <a href=\"https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-3-haiku\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">1:5 input-to-output token ratio</a>. This means it can generate a large volume of data from a relatively small amount of input or context. This capability not only enhances the model’s effectiveness, but also makes it cost-efficient for our application, where we need to generate numerous data samples from a limited set of examples. Anthropic’s Claude Haiku LLM is invoked iteratively to efficiently manage token consumption and help prevent reaching the maximum token limit. The following diagram illustrates this workflow.</p><p>Here are the steps for data generation:</p><ul><li>The user initiates a request to generate new synthetic counterparty risk data based on specific criteria.</li><li>The Amazon Titan Text Embeddings V2 LLM is employed to create embeddings for the user’s request prompts, transforming them into a machine-interpretable format.</li><li>These newly generated embeddings are then forwarded to a specialized module designed to identify matching stored data.</li><li>The Chroma vector database, which houses previously stored embeddings, is queried to find data that closely matches the user’s request.</li><li>The identified matching data and the original user prompts are then passed to a module responsible for generating new synthetic data.</li><li>Anthropic’s Claude Haiku 3.0 model is invoked, using both the matching embeddings and user prompts as input to create high-quality synthetic data.</li><li>The generated synthetic data is then parsed and formatted into a .csv file using the Pydantic library, providing a structured and validated output.</li><li>To confirm the quality of the generated data, several statistical methods are applied, including quantile-quantile (Q-Q) plots and correlation heat maps of key attributes, providing a comprehensive validation process.</li></ul><p>When validating the synthetic CR data generated by the LLM, we employed Q-Q plots and correlation heat maps focusing on key attributes such as , , and . These statistical tools serve crucial roles in promoting the quality and representativeness of the synthetic data. By using the Q-Q plots, we can assess whether these attributes follow a normal distribution, which is often expected in many clinical and financial variables. By comparing the quantiles of our synthetic data against theoretical normal distributions, we can identify significant deviations that might indicate bias or unrealistic data generation.</p><p>Simultaneously, the correlation heat maps provide a visual representation of the relationships between these attributes and others in the dataset. This is particularly important because it helps verify that the LLM has maintained the complex interdependencies typically observed in real CR data. For instance, we would expect certain correlations between exposure and replacement cost, or between replacement cost and settlement risk. By making sure these correlations are preserved in our synthetic data, we can be more confident that analyses or models built on this data will yield insights that are applicable to real-world scenarios. This rigorous validation process helps to mitigate the risk of introducing artificial patterns or biases, thereby enhancing the reliability and utility of our synthetic CR dataset for subsequent research or modeling tasks.</p><p>We’ve created a Jupyter notebook containing three parts to implement the key components of the solution.

Although synthetic data generation can be a powerful tool, it’s crucial to make sure that no real customer information is used without proper authorization and thorough anonymization. Organizations must prioritize data protection, implement robust security measures, and adhere to relevant regulations. Additionally, when developing and deploying AI models, it’s essential to consider ethical implications, potential biases, and the broader societal impact. Responsible AI practices include regular audits, transparency in decision-making processes, and ongoing monitoring to help prevent unintended consequences. By balancing innovation with ethical considerations, financial institutions can harness the benefits of AI while maintaining trust and protecting individual privacy.</p><p>In this post, we showed how to generate a well-balanced synthetic dataset representing various aspects of counterparty data, using RAG-based prompt engineering with LLMs. Counterparty data analysis is imperative for making OTC transactions between two counterparties. Because actual business data in this domain isn’t easily available, using this approach you can generate synthetic training data for your ML models at minimal cost often within minutes. After you train the model, you can use it to make intelligent decisions before entering into an OTC derivative transaction.</p><p>For more information about this topic, refer to the following resources:</p><p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/f1f836cb4ea6efb2a0b1b99f41ad8b103eff4b59/2025/01/23/kulsant.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"100\" height=\"133\"> is a Senior Moderation Architect with over 16 years of experience, specialized in developing serverless, container-based, and data architectures for clients across various domains.

If you haven't read <a href=\"https://blog.michaelrbparker.com/post/5\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">my first AI article, I'd recommend doing so here.</a> Otherwise, the TL;DR is that I'm brand new to the whole AI development thing, and I'm trying to publish a research paper by the end of the year. I have recently learned how PyTorch, NumPy, and some of the AI maths work, so I'm going to skip the basics that I went over in the last article. By the end of the blog, I had a working OCR model. In this article, we’re hopefully going to have a working long short-term memory (LSTM) model to predict stocks.</p><p>So, what is an LSTM model?<p>\nAn LSTM is a type of recurrent neural network (RNN). This means that before I can explain what an LSTM is, I'm going to have to take a few steps back and explain what an RNN model is. An RNN is a type of AI model designed to be used with sequential data (data that is organised in a sequence, where the order is important), such as sentences, sensor measurements, gene sequences, and, you guessed it, stock prices. RNNs are one of the few models that have a kind of memory. The memory in an RNN is called a hidden state, and this is fed through a loop.</p></p><p>This might be a bit hard to understand, so let's put this in an example. Let's say we are reading a sentence.</p><p>The first word gets passed into the RNN model, and the model generates a hidden state. (To make life simple, just think of a hidden state as a summary of what the model has been exposed to so far.)</p><p>Next, the following word is given to the RNN model, along with the hidden state that was generated by the previous word. An updated/new hidden state is created.</p><p>The model then continues to loop through the sentence, passing on the previous hidden state.</p><p>If you are interested, this process can be shown as a </p><ul><li>( x_t ) = current input (e.g., a word at time ( t ))</li><li>( h_{t-1} ) = previous hidden state (memory from the last step)</li><li>( W, U, b ) = learned parameters (weights and biases)</li><li>( f ) = activation function (usually  or )</li></ul><p>If you don't understand the maths, that's not important. I've kind of left it in for those who are interested. I'm happy to go through it over on <a href=\"https://discord.gg/2SZm46Jevq\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Discord</a>, but don't worry about it too much.</p><p>The downside of RNN models is that they can sometimes forget things. This is called the \"vanishing gradient problem\". As the model takes in more data, the weighting of earlier data decreases. It can eventually decrease to the point that it's no longer significant. This is because the gradients shrink exponentially during backward propagation.</p><p>One of the main benefits of an LSTM is that it fixes the vanishing gradient problem. LSTMs use a structure called a memory cell, which allows them to selectively remember or forget information over long periods. The memory cells have three gates.</p><ul><li> Decides which information to discard from the cell state.</li></ul><p>This gate decides which parts of the previous cell state should be\n   kept or discarded. It takes the previous hidden state and the current<p>\n   input and outputs a number between 0 and 1 for each value in the cell</p>\n   state. If the number is closer to one, it is kept. If it's closer to</p><ul><li> Determines what new information should be added to the cell state.</li><li> Controls what information from the cell state should be used as output.</li></ul><p>Now, if you are feeling fancy, you can chain LSTMs together. You do this by taking the state of the previous cell as well as the output and feeding that into the new cell with an input. This cell then processes its own outputs, and so on. This process enables LSTMs to learn dependencies over long sequences while reducing the vanishing gradient problem. I think this is all the information that's needed for us to start coding.</p><p>The first new thing is making a DataFrame. LSTMs require sequential data, so we need to make a table where we shift back the closing prices. I have decided to do this a week at a time.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>This creates an output that looks like this.

By normalising the data, we make the minimum value -1 and the maximum value 1. This will speed up convergence. Stock prices can end up being massive numbers, which leads to large gradients, either slowing down convergence or causing unstable training (large or rapid changes in gradients, or the loss function fluctuating instead of decreasing).</p><p>The next few steps are boring, so we will just brush over them: converting everything to NumPy, splitting the data into  and , reshaping the data, and then converting it to tensors. Finally, we split the data into testing and training sets. The first 95% of the data will be used for training, and the last 5% will be used for testing.</p><p>Now for the fun part—creating the model. Making an LSTM is surprisingly simple with PyTorch. Our class takes in four attributes: input size, hidden size, number of layers, and output size. We are using an input size of 1, so we are processing one row of the table at a time; a hidden size of 4, meaning we are using four nodes in every LSTM; and one layer, meaning we are using a single LSTM model. This is due to it being a simple problem—chaining multiple LSTMs together can lead to overfitting. This is also the reason for using so few nodes. (\"Overfitting means creating a model that matches (memorises) the training set so closely that the model fails to make correct predictions on new data\" — Google Developer Crash Course). Finally, there is only one output, as the only data we want to take from the model is the future price of the stock.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Next is the forward function. The first thing is initialising the memory (hidden and state cells) with zeros. For every batch of the training loop, there is no previous data, so if we did not create a tensor of zeros, the computer would use random values from the system's memory. This would lead to a bias in the data.</p><p>The next step is passing in the current batch and memory into the LSTM. This step returns two things: a tensor with the output values and the memory in the final state. We don’t need the values of the memory, so we cast it into the void (assign it to a _ variable, which is a convention in Python to indicate unused or unnecessary data). We then output and extract the last time step from the tensor. Finally, the extracted data is passed into a fully connected layer, leading to our single-value stock price output.</p><p>This model goes through several training loops (also explained in the last article), and then we compare our predicted data to the real data. The model seems fairly accurate.</p><p>Now for the fun part. Getting rich quickly. I have this rather crude trading strategy code.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Now, could this code be better? Yes, but the goal of this project was the AI aspect. In short, we look at the current value and our predicted future value. If it’s ≥1% higher, we buy stock; if the future value is ≥1% lower, we sell the stock. Now for the bit of information everyone wants: how much PROFIT did this make?</p><p>By giving it a (fake) 1000 USD and letting it run between the years of 2021-12-08 and 2023-04-05 (with a speed-up in simulation time), a grand total profit of 22.99 USD was made.</p><p>Now, is this a success?<p>\nKinda. I have successfully created a working LSTM model that generates profit. However, if you had put the same 1000 USD into a 4.4% ISA, you would have made 59 USD of profit.

Through advanced analytics, software, research, and industry expertise across more than 20 countries, Verisk helps build resilience for individuals, communities, and businesses. The company is committed to ethical and responsible AI development with human oversight and transparency. Verisk is using <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/generative-ai/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">generative AI</a> to enhance operational efficiencies and profitability for insurance clients while adhering to its ethical AI principles.</p><p>Verisk’s Premium Audit Advisory Service (PAAS®) is the leading source of technical information and training for premium auditors and underwriters. PAAS helps users classify exposure for commercial casualty insurance, including general liability, commercial auto, and workers’ compensation. PAAS offers a wide range of essential services, including more than 40,000 classification guides and more than 500 bulletins. PAAS now includes PAAS AI, the first commercially available interactive generative-AI chats specifically developed for premium audit, which reduces research time and empower users to make informed decisions by answering questions and quickly retrieving and summarizing multiple PAAS documents like class guides, bulletins, rating cards, etc.</p><p>In this post, we describe the development of the customer support process in PAAS, incorporating generative AI, the data, the architecture, and the evaluation of the results. Conversational AI assistants are rapidly transforming customer and employee support. Verisk has embraced this technology and developed its own PAAS AI, which provides an enhanced self-service capability to the PAAS platform.</p><p>The Verisk PAAS platform houses a vast array of documents—including class guides, advisory content, and bulletins—that aid Verisk’s customers in determining the appropriate rules and classifications for workers’ compensation, general liability, and commercial auto business. When premium auditors need accurate answers within this extensive document repository, the challenges they face are:</p><ul><li> – The sheer volume of documents (advisories, bulletins, and so on) makes manual searching time-consuming and inefficient</li><li> – Finding accurate information within this vast repository can be slow, hindering timely decision-making</li><li><strong>Inconsistent quality of responses</strong> – Manual searches might yield irrelevant or incomplete results, leading to uncertainty and potential errors</li></ul><p>To address this issue, Verisk PAAS AI is designed to alleviate the burden by providing round-the-clock support for business processing and delivering precise and quick responses to customer queries. This technology is deeply integrated into Verisk’s newly reimagined PAAS platform, using all of Verisk’s documentation, training materials, and collective expertise. It employs a retrieval augmented generation (RAG) approach and a combination of AWS services alongside proprietary evaluations to promptly answer most user questions about the capabilities of the Verisk PAAS platform.</p><p>When deployed at scale, this PAAS AI will enable Verisk staff to dedicate more time to complex issues, critical projects, and innovation, thereby enhancing the overall customer experience. Throughout the development process, Verisk encountered several considerations, key findings, and decisions that provide valuable insights for any enterprise looking to explore the potential of generative AI.</p><p>When creating an interactive agent using large language models (LLMs), two common approaches are RAG and model fine-tuning. The choice between these methods depends on the specific use case and available data. Verisk PAAS began developing a RAG pipeline for its PAAS AI and has progressively improved this solution. Here are some reasons why continuing with a RAG architecture was beneficial for Verisk:</p><ul><li> – The PAAS platform is constantly evolving, adding new business functions and technical capabilities. Verisk needed to make sure its responses are based on the most current information. The RAG approach allows access to continuously updated data, providing responses with the latest information without frequently retraining the model.</li><li> – Besides data recency, another crucial aspect is the ability to draw from multiple PAAS resources to acquire relevant context. The ease of expanding the knowledge base without the need for fine-tuning new data sources makes the solution adaptable.</li><li> – Retrieval minimizes the risk of hallucinations compared with free-form text generation because responses come directly from the provided excerpts. Verisk developed an evaluation tool to enhance response quality.</li><li> – Although appropriate context can be retrieved from enterprise data sources, the underlying LLM manages the linguistics and fluency.</li><li> – Verisk aimed to consistently improve the PAAS AI’s response generation ability. A RAG architecture offered the transparency required in the context retrieval process, which would ultimately be used to generate user responses. This transparency helped Verisk identify areas where document restructuring was needed.</li><li> – With diverse users accessing the platform and differing data access permissions, data governance and isolation were critical. Verisk implemented controls within the RAG pipeline to restrict data access based on user permissions, helping to ensure that responses are delivered only to authorized users.</li></ul><p>Although both RAG and fine-tuning have their pros and cons, RAG is the best approach for building a PAAS AI on the PAAS platform, given Verisk’s needs for real-time accuracy, explainability, and configurability. The pipeline architecture supports iterative enhancement as the use cases for the Verisk PAAS platform develop.</p><p>The following diagram showcases a high-level architectural data flow that highlights various AWS services used in constructing the solution. Verisk’s system demonstrates a complex AI setup, where multiple components interact and frequently call on the LLM to provide user responses. Employing the PAAS platform to manage these varied components was an intuitive decision.</p><p>The key components are as follows:</p><p>Verisk’s PAAS team determined that ElastiCache is the ideal solution for storing all chat history. This storage approach allows for seamless integration in conversational chats and enables the display of recent conversations on the website, providing an efficient and responsive user experience.</p><p><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/claude/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Anthropic’s Claude</a>, available in Amazon Bedrock, played various roles within Verisk’s solution:</p><ul><li> – When building their PAAS AI, Verisk conducted a comprehensive evaluation of leading LLMs, using their extensive dataset to test each model’s capabilities. Through Amazon Bedrock, Verisk gained streamlined access to multiple best-in-class foundation models (FMs), enabling efficient testing and comparison across key performance criteria. The Amazon Bedrock unified API and robust infrastructure provided the ideal platform to develop, test, and deploy LLM solutions at scale. After this extensive testing, Verisk found Anthropic’s Claude model consistently outperformed across key criteria. Anthropic’s Claude demonstrated superior language understanding in Verisk’s complex business domain, allowing more pertinent responses to user questions. Given the model’s standout results across Verisk PAAS platform use cases, it was the clear choice to power the PAAS AI’s natural language capabilities.</li><li><strong>Conversation summarization</strong> – When a user asks a follow-up question, the PAAS AI can continue the conversational thread. To enable this, Verisk used Claude to summarize the dialogue to update the context from ElastiCache. The full conversation summary and new excerpts are input to the LLM to generate the next response. This conversational flow allows the PAAS AI to answer user follow-up questions and have a more natural, contextual dialogue, bringing Verisk PAAS closer to having a true AI assistant that can engage in useful, back-and-forth conversations with users.</li><li> – Keywords are extracted from user questions and previous conversations to be used for creating the new summarized prompt and to be input to Verisk’s knowledge base retrievers to perform vector similarity search.</li></ul><h3>Amazon OpenSearch Service</h3><p>Primarily used for the storage of text embeddings, OpenSearch facilitates efficient document retrieval by enabling rapid access to indexed data. These embeddings serve as semantic representations of documents, allowing for advanced search capabilities that go beyond simple keyword matching. This semantic search functionality enhances the system’s ability to retrieve relevant documents that are contextually similar to the search queries, thereby improving the overall accuracy and speed of data queries. Additionally, OpenSearch functions as a semantic cache for similarity searches, optimizing performance by reducing the computational load and improving response times during data retrieval operations. This makes it an indispensable tool in the larger PAAS ecosystem, where the need for quick and precise information access is paramount.</p><p>The integration of Snowflake in the PAAS AI ecosystem helps provide scalable and real-time access to data, allowing Verisk to promptly address customer concerns and improve its services. By using Snowflake’s capabilities, Verisk can perform advanced analytics, including sentiment analysis and predictive modeling, to better understand customer needs and enhance user experiences. This continuous feedback loop is vital for refining the PAAS AI and making sure it remains responsive and relevant to user demands.</p><h2>Structuring and retrieving the data</h2><p>An essential element in developing the PAAS AI’s knowledge base was properly structuring and effectively querying the data to deliver accurate answers. Verisk explored various techniques to optimize both the organization of the content and the methods to extract the most relevant information:</p><ul><li> – A key step in preparing the accumulated questions and answers was splitting the data into individual documents to facilitate indexing into OpenSearch Service. Rather than uploading large files containing multiple pages of content, Verisk chunked the data into smaller segments by document section and character lengths. By splitting the data into small, modular chunks focused on a single section of a document, Verisk could more easily index each document and had greater success in pulling back the correct context. Chunking the data also enabled straightforward updating and reindexing of the knowledge base over time.</li><li> – When querying the knowledge base, Verisk found that using just standard vector search wasn’t enough to retrieve all the relevant contexts pertaining to a question. Therefore, a solution was implemented to combine a sparse bm25 search in combination with the dense vector search to create a hybrid search approach, which yielded much better context retrieval results.</li><li><strong>Data separation and filters</strong> – Another issue Verisk ran into was that, because of the vast amount of documents and the overlapping content within certain topics, incorrect documents were being retrieved for some questions that asked for specific topics that were present across multiple sources—some of these weren’t needed or appropriate in the context of the user’s question. Therefore, data separation was implemented to split the documents based on document type and filter by line of business to improve context retrieval within the application.</li></ul><p>By thoroughly experimenting and optimizing both the knowledge base powering the PAAS AI and the queries to extract answers from it, Verisk was able to achieve very high answer accuracy during the proof of concept, paving the way for further development. The techniques explored—hybrid querying, HTML section chunking, and index filtering—became core elements of Verisk’s approach for extracting quality contexts.</p><h2>LLM parameters and models</h2><p>Experimenting with prompt structure, length, temperature, role-playing, and context was key to improving the quality and accuracy of the PAAS AI’s Claude-powered responses. The <a href=\"https://docs.anthropic.com/claude/docs/prompt-engineering\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">prompt design guidelines</a> provided by Anthropic were incredibly helpful.</p><p>Verisk crafted prompts that provided Anthropic’s Claude with clear context and set roles for answering user questions. Setting the temperature to 0 helped reduce the randomness and indeterministic nature of LLM-generated responses.</p><p>Verisk also experimented with different models to improve the efficiency of the overall solution. For scenarios where latency was more important and less reasoning was required, Anthropic’s Claude Haiku was the perfect solution. For other scenarios such as question answering using provided contexts where it was more important for the LLM to be able to understand every detail given in the prompt, Anthropic’s Claude Sonnet was the better choice to balance latency, performance, and cost.</p><p>LLM guardrails were implemented in the PAAS AI project using both the guardrails provided by Amazon Bedrock and specialized sections within the prompt to detect unrelated questions and prompt attack attempts. Amazon Bedrock guardrails can be attached to any Amazon Bedrock model invocation call and automatically detect if the given model input and output are in violation of the language filters that are set (violence, misconduct, sexual, and so on), which helps with screening user inputs. The specialized prompts further improve LLM security by creating a second net that uses the power of the LLMs to catch any inappropriate inputs from the users.</p><p>This allows Verisk to be confident that the model will only answer to its intended purpose surrounding premium auditing services and will not be misused by threat actors.</p><p>After validating several evaluation tools such as <a href=\"https://github.com/confident-ai/deepeval\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Deepeval</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/explodinggradients/ragas\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Ragas</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/truera/trulens\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Trulens</a>, and so on, the Verisk PAAS team realized that there were certain limitations to using these tools for their specific use case. Consequently, the team decided to develop its own evaluation API, shown in the above figure.</p><p>This custom API evaluates the answers based on three major metrics:</p><ul><li> – Using LLMs, the process assesses whether the answers provided are relevant to the customer’s prompt. This helps make sure that the responses are directly addressing the questions posed.</li><li> – By using LLMs, the process evaluates whether the context retrieved is appropriate and aligns well with the question. This helps make sure that the LLM has the appropriate and accurate contexts to generate a response.</li><li> – Using LLMs, the process checks if the responses are generated based on their retrieved context or if they are hallucinated. This is crucial for maintaining the integrity and reliability of the information provided.</li></ul><p>This custom evaluation approach helps make sure that the answers generated are not only relevant and contextually appropriate but also faithful to the established generative AI knowledge base, minimizing the risk of misinformation. By incorporating these metrics, Verisk has enhanced the robustness and reliability of their PAAS AI, providing customers with accurate and trustworthy responses.</p><p>The Verisk PAAS team has implemented a comprehensive feedback loop mechanism, shown in the above figure, to support continuous improvement and address any issues that might arise.</p><p>This feedback loop is structured around the following key components:</p><ul><li><strong>Customer feedback analysis</strong> – The team actively collects and analyzes feedback from customers to identify potential data issues or problems with the generative AI responses. This analysis helps pinpoint specific areas that need improvement.</li><li> – After an issue is identified, it’s categorized based on its nature. If it’s a data-related issue, it’s assigned to the internal business team for resolution. If it’s an application issue, a Jira ticket is automatically created for the PAAS IT team to address and fix the problem.</li><li> – The system provides an option to update QA test cases based on the feedback received. This helps make sure that the test scenarios remain relevant and comprehensive, covering a wide range of potential issues.</li><li> – Ground truth agreements, which serve as the benchmark for evaluating LLM response quality, are periodically reviewed and updated. This helps make sure that the evaluation metrics remain accurate and reflective of the desired standards.</li><li> – Regular evaluations of the LLM responses are conducted using the updated QA test cases and ground truth agreements. This helps in maintaining high-quality responses and quickly addressing any deviations from the expected standards.</li></ul><p>This robust feedback loop mechanism enables Verisk to continuously fine-tune the PAAS AI, making sure that it delivers precise, relevant, and contextually appropriate answers to customer queries. By integrating customer feedback, categorizing issues efficiently, updating test scenarios, and adhering to stringent evaluation protocols, Verisk maintains a high standard of service and drives continuous improvement in its generative AI capabilities.</p><p>Verisk initially rolled out the PAAS AI to one beta customer to demonstrate real-world performance and impact. Supporting a customer in this way is a stark contrast to how Verisk has historically engaged with and supported customers in the past, where Verisk would typically have a team allocated to interact with the customer directly. Verisk’s PAAS AI has revolutionized the way subject matter experts (SMEs) work and cost-effectively scales while still providing high-quality assistance. What previously took hours of manual review can now be accomplished in minutes, resulting in an extraordinary 96–98% reduction in processing time per specialist. This dramatic improvement in efficiency not only streamline operations but also allows Verisk’s experts to focus on more strategic initiatives that drive greater value for the organization.</p><p>In analyzing this early usage data, Verisk uncovered additional areas where it can drive business value for its customers. As Verisk collects additional information, this data will help uncover what will be needed to improve results and prepare to roll out to a wider customer base of approximately 15,000 users.</p><p>Ongoing development will focus on expanding these capabilities, prioritized based on the collected questions. Most exciting, though, are the new possibilities on the horizon with generative AI. Verisk knows this technology is rapidly advancing and is eager to harness innovations to bring even more value to customers. As new models and techniques emerge, Verisk plans to adapt the PAAS AI to take advantage of the latest capabilities. Although the PAAS AI currently focuses on responding to user questions, this is only the starting point. Verisk plans to quickly improve its capabilities to proactively make suggestions and configure functionality directly in the system itself. The Verisk PAAS team is inspired by the challenge of pushing the boundaries of what’s possible with generative AI and is excited to test those boundaries.</p><p>Verisk’s development of a PAAS AI for its PAAS platform demonstrates the transformative power of generative AI in customer support and operational efficiency. Through careful data harvesting, structuring, retrieval, and the use of LLMs, semantic search functionalities, and stringent evaluation protocols, Verisk has crafted a robust system that delivers accurate, real-time answers to user questions. By continuing to enhance the PAAS AI’s features while maintaining ethical and responsible AI practices, Verisk is set to provide increased value to its customers, enable staff to concentrate on innovation, and establish new benchmarks for customer service in the insurance sector.</p><p>For more information, see the following resources:</p><p> is the Director of Software Engineering at Verisk, where he leads the Premium Audit Advisory Service (PAAS) development team.

Let’s say, I’m planning to use this Agent to learn about financial updates, so I can give it a specific tool for that topic, like searching only a finance website instead of the whole web.</p><pre><code>def search_yf(query: str) -&gt; str:\n&nbsp;&nbsp;engine = DuckDuckGoSearchResults(backend=\"news\")\n&nbsp; return engine.run(f\"site:finance.yahoo.com {query}\")\n\ntool_search_yf = {'type':'function', 'function':{\n&nbsp; 'name': 'search_yf',\n&nbsp; 'description': 'Search for specific financial news',\n&nbsp; 'parameters': {'type': 'object',\n&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 'required': ['query'],\n&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 'properties': {\n&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 'query': {'type':'str', 'description':'the financial topic or subject to search'},\n}}}}\n\n## test\nsearch_yf(query=\"nvidia\")</code></pre><p>In my opinion, the most basic Agent should at least be able to choose between one or two Tools and re-elaborate the output of the action to give the user a proper and concise answer.&nbsp;</p><p>First, you need to write a prompt to describe the Agent’s purpose, the more detailed the better (mine is very generic), and that will be the first message in the chat history with the LLM.&nbsp;</p><pre><code>prompt = '''You are an assistant with access to tools, you must decide when to use tools to answer user message.'''&nbsp;\nmessages = [{\"role\":\"system\", \"content\":prompt}]</code></pre><p>In order to keep the chat with the AI alive, I will use a loop that starts with user’s input and then the Agent is invoked to respond (which can be a text from the LLM or the activation of a Tool).</p><p>Up to this point, the chat history could look something like this:</p><p>If the model wants to use a Tool, the appropriate function needs to be run with the input parameters suggested by the LLM in its response object:</p><p>So our code needs to get that information and run the Tool function.</p><p>Now, if we run the full code, we can chat with our Agent.</p><p>LLMs know how to code by being exposed to a large corpus of both code and natural language text, where they learn patterns, syntax, and semantics of <a href=\"https://towardsdatascience.com/tag/programming/\" title=\"Programming\">Programming</a> languages. The model learns the relationships between different parts of the code by predicting the next token in a sequence. In short, LLMs can generate Python code but can’t execute it, Agents can.</p><p>I shall prepare a Tool allowing the Agent to . In Python, you can easily create a shell to run code as a string with the native command .</p><pre><code>import io\nimport contextlib\n\ndef code_exec(code: str) -&gt; str:\\\n&nbsp; &nbsp; output = io.StringIO()\n&nbsp; &nbsp; with contextlib.redirect_stdout(output):\n&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; try:\n&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; exec(code)\n&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; except Exception as e:\n&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; print(f\"Error: {e}\")\n&nbsp; &nbsp; return output.getvalue()\n\ntool_code_exec = {'type':'function', 'function':{\n&nbsp; 'name': 'code_exec',\n&nbsp; 'description': 'execute python code',\n&nbsp; 'parameters': {'type': 'object',\n&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 'required': ['code'],\n&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 'properties': {\n&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 'code': {'type':'str', 'description':'code to execute'},\n}}}}\n\n## test\ncode_exec(\"a=1+1; print(a)\")</code></pre><p>Just like before, I will write a prompt, but this time, at the beginning of the chat-loop, I will ask the user to provide a file path.</p><p>Since coding tasks can be a little trickier for LLMs, I am going to add also . By default, during one session, there isn’t a true long-term memory. LLMs have access to the chat history, so they can remember information temporarily, and track the context and instructions you’ve given earlier in the conversation. However, memory doesn’t always work as expected, especially if the LLM is small. Therefore, a good practice is to reinforce the model’s memory by adding periodic reminders in the chat history.</p><p>Please note that the default memory length in Ollama is 2048 characters. If your machine can handle it, you can increase it by changing the number when the LLM is invoked:</p><pre><code>&nbsp; &nbsp; ## model\n&nbsp; &nbsp; agent_res = ollama.chat(\n&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; model=llm,\n&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; tools=[tool_code_exec],\n&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; options={\"num_ctx\":2048},\n&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; messages=messages)</code></pre><p>In this usecase, the output of the Agent is mostly code and data, so I don’t want the LLM to re-elaborate the responses.</p><p>Now, if we run the full code, we can chat with our Agent.</p><p>This article has covered the foundational steps of creating Agents from scratch using only .

The first draft of this article was generated in Chinese and translated into English by Grok-3.</em></p><p>Here are the main points of these concerns:</p><ol><li>AI-assisted programming causes problem-solving skills to deteriorate, as people have fewer chances to think independently.</li><li>There’s a “withdrawal” effect from AI programming, leaving people feeling dumber or slower without it.</li><li>“We haven’t become ‘10x programmers’ thanks to AI; we’ve just become 10 times more dependent on it.”</li></ol><p>Speaking for myself, I feel rather fortunate. Before large language models became widespread—or even existed—I had already patiently built a relatively solid foundation in computer science. I diligently completed assignments, projects, and exams from classic courses like Zhejiang University’s data structures and MIT’s operating systems. By the end of 2022, when I needed to write my graduation thesis, the initial version of GPT-3.5/ChatGPT emerged—just in time.</p><p>If I had started my studies a few years later, I’d surely question the value of learning foundational knowledge. Even if I recognized its importance and began studying, I might not be willing to learn as thoroughly as I did in the “pre-AI era.” I might toss classic papers to AI and ask it to summarize the key points for me. If I didn’t understand something, I’d ask AI rather than digging into the paper myself. For course assignments, AI would auto-complete them for me, and since humans are naturally lazy, I’d struggle to resist: “Oh, it filled in a bunch for me—well, that’s the gist of it, I get it, as long as it runs and finishes the assignment!” Worse still, since solutions to course assignments have long been part of AI’s training data, the auto-completed work would likely be flawless—robbing me of the chance to sharpen my debugging skills with tools like GDB during my student years. When such a student later tackles real-world problems where AI’s solutions aren’t perfect, they’ll face challenges far tougher than those met by engineers from the “pre-AI era.”</p><p>Yet, unlike all professions in history that have faced “elimination threats,” software engineers—or programmers—are the most inclined to “actively embrace new things.” It’s a job requirement, after all.</p><p>So, how do we safely “embrace” this double-edged sword, this “demon”?</p><p><strong>Treat AI programming assistants as your interns, not as employees, colleagues, or teachers!</strong></p><h3>\n  \n  \n  1) Your subordinates or colleagues are accountable for their code, but your interns are not.\n</h3><p>If code you wrote with AI has bugs, would you sue the AI company? Of course not—they’ve already disclaimed liability. Even if it’s code written by AI or commits suggested by AI, the responsibility ultimately falls on you.</p><p>What’s that? Your company has integrated AI into CI/CD, like using AI to procedurally write unit tests? No problem—if the AI’s code fails, whoever deployed the AI is accountable.</p><p>In short, responsibility must land on a human. If you fully entrust your work to an AI tool, you can’t say when issues arise, “This was written by so-and-so; go find them!”</p><p>For critical logic written by AI, you must review it yourself, just as you’d carefully check an intern’s code before it goes into production.</p><p>Moreover, you should be extra cautious about letting AI access highly sensitive information. It’s like not allowing a summer intern to touch your company’s most competitive core technology. Imagine this: the internship ends, the intern leaves, and with the confidential knowledge gained from you, they land a full-time job at your competitor. Would you make interns sign non-compete agreements? Hardly practical.</p><p>AI programming assistants carry a similar risk, though it’s unlikely AI companies care about our mundane business code. Still, for programmers, safeguarding core data, keys, and code is worth considering. My initial suggestions are:</p><ul><li>Store passwords, tokens, and other sensitive info in profile files like , reading them as environment variables at runtime.</li><li>Or ensure your project’s config files are ignored by AI tools.</li></ul><h3>\n  \n  \n  2) Assign your intern one task at a time—don’t rush.\n</h3><p>Think back to your first meeting with an intern—a fresh-faced newbie on their first internship. How did you introduce the upcoming work?</p><ul><li>Hello, student. Now, assume you’re a senior Go language engineer who’ll provide me with secure, elegant Go backend system solutions.</li><li>I need a backend system for an image hosting service, supporting image uploads, downloads, list queries, and more.</li><li>Pay special attention to the image storage solution and caching scheme for preview images, as project cost is a key factor.</li><li>Choose the most ecosystem-friendly Go language service framework to ensure smooth future development and maintenance.</li><li>The project must be highly scalable, with corresponding hot-update solutions.</li><li>Produce excellent API documentation to ease frontend integration.</li><li>Don’t skip linting, static checks, or unit tests.</li></ul><p>If you said that to an intern, you’d witness the epitome of bewilderment. Obviously, you wouldn’t do that.</p><p>You shouldn’t do it with AI either. In other words, being too greedy often leads to subpar results and wasted time. We should treat each interaction with AI like a meeting with an intern.</p><ul><li>First meeting (asking DeepSeek-R1 or another reasoning model): I want to design a high-performance image hosting backend system. I’m skilled in Go—are there any recommended existing solutions? If not, how should we design it? How do we plan the project?\n\n<ul><li>This first meeting is like letting the intern plan their summer project, then refining and finalizing it.</li><li>At the end of the chat, you can ask AI to output a summary of the design plan, structure diagram, tech stack, etc., much like having the intern summarize the project for you. Then, use that summary to kick off the next meeting or AI chat.</li></ul></li><li>Second meeting (using the prior “meeting summary” as a pre-prompt for the AI programming tool): Based on the current project design, let’s start building the minimal viable functionality. Let’s first design the first service in the dependency injection!\n\n<ul><li>In this second meeting, letting AI generate specific code is akin to having the intern write code.</li><li>If something’s off, fix it yourself to prevent cascading errors.</li></ul></li><li>Subsequent meetings would focus on daily progress.</li></ul><ol><li>Models like GPT-O1 or DeepSeek-R1 excel at reasoning but are slower (since they reason before outputting) and costlier, so use them for project design.</li><li>For daily code generation, opt for inference models like DeepSeek-V3 or Claude-Sonnet-3.5—they’re faster and cheaper. If your project context is clear and well-structured, the code quality is often solid. Especially if you’ve already implemented one unit test, AI will follow it to nail the rest perfectly. But if you ask AI to write unit tests from scratch, it might not fully match your expectations.</li></ol><h3>\n  \n  \n  3) You can’t leave an intern’s project completely untouched.\n</h3><p>This comes from personal experience. I have a mild compulsion to write some code daily. But over the past six months, that habit morphed into “having AI generate some code daily.” Surprisingly, my productivity slowed down.</p><p>During the New Year holiday, I wanted to build a simple SPA (Single Page Application) with basic Vue3 logic. Over five days, I made zero progress. Unable to focus on code during the holiday, I opted to rely entirely on AI assistance.</p><p>Eventually, I was stunned to see AI spinning in circles on my project. I’d defined a basic  component (somewhat complex), and in , my AI couldn’t decide whether to use it or write new file upload logic, spawning a host of new issues.</p><p>As the holiday neared its end, I finally sat down and looked closely. The logic was so simple! I wrote it myself in no time.</p><p>You might say I misused the AI tool or that it’s better with React than Vue. But you can’t guarantee this black box won’t stall on slightly novel problems.</p><p>Especially when your code hits production issues, you can’t expect an intern to rush from school to fix it, just as you can’t expect AI to deliver spot-on answers in a pinch.</p><p>For AI-written projects, it’s best to understand how they’re implemented. That way, when you need to tweak them, you can dive in quickly.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  4) You can’t use an intern as your search engine.\n</h3><p>Copying every bug to AI right away is absurd, laughable, and sad. Even if AI advances for another decade, this habit will remain absurd, laughable, and sad—unless you’ve got a cutting-edge brain-computer interface feeding AI all your perceptions and context.</p><p>Handing error messages to AI is fine, of course. But it shouldn’t be an instinct. Otherwise, why employ you as an engineer? For problems you can roughly pinpoint with your brain, a quick search engine query beats asking AI in speed and fit.</p><p>The same applies to basic info lookups. Programmers these days seem too lazy to read documentation.</p><p>Imagine you’re using the  command and want to know what  does. Would you call an intern over and ask, “What’s this parameter do, and give me a few specific examples?”</p><p>Two minutes later, the intern returns with a markdown report cobbled together from sketchy blogs. You read it, half-grasping it, unsure if it’s accurate.</p><p>Why not just search <code>doc: aws s3 sync --exact-timestamps</code> on a search engine? In five seconds, you’d have the most official, reliable, and clear documentation in front of you. It’s all text—why settle for someone else’s regurgitated version?</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  5) An intern can be an expert in certain areas, and that’s not shameful.\n</h3><p>Suppose your boss wants to launch a CUDA-related business line and names you the technical lead. You could recruit interns who’ve worked with CUDA in school and listen to their ideas during project design.</p><p>Likewise, when we hit new problems and lack direction, we can “consult” AI. Just as we might consult interns—expertise varies, and that’s normal.</p><p>But with interns, you wouldn’t carelessly toss out shallow questions. Even for something simple, you’d ask rigorously: “Given the current situation, what’s the better technical route? Please outline it based on ecosystem, development difficulty, maintenance difficulty, performance, cost, etc.” You should engage AI the same way to maximize the value of the information you get.</p><p>: Those who know me might recall that a year ago, I’d always put “AI” in quotes. I don’t believe today’s probabilistic models have true “intelligence.” I still feel that way. But I also believe we should move with the times rather than cling to formalities. Though I personally dislike AI tools, I’d wager that, outside of professional researchers, I’m among the most active, proactive, and extensive users of new AI tools.

That caused an estimated loss of $10 billion in damages!</p><p>That’s why automated software testing is so important.</p><p>While manual testing has its place in the process, you must be able to run specific tests using automation. Automating the management and tracking of tests is called test automation—and that’s what the test this guide is about.</p><p>We’ll discuss what it is, its types, tools, and what to consider when implementing test automation.</p><p>Test automation involves using software tools, scripts, and frameworks to automate various aspects of the testing life cycle, including test case creation, execution, result analysis, reporting, and defect tracking.</p><p>Its fundamental goal is to boost efficiency, accuracy, and consistency by integrating automation into the software development life cycle (SDLC).</p><p>Automated software testing can handle many repetitive but necessary tasks and enable manual testing that would be difficult or impossible.

Additionally, cloud-based automation testing enables teams to execute tests across multiple environments without the limitations of physical infrastructure, ensuring broader test coverage and faster feedback loops.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  When Should You Automate? (And When You Shouldn’t)\n</h2><p>Not every test should be automated; knowing when to use automation effectively is key to optimizing your testing efforts.</p><p>Let’s take a look at the tests you should automate:</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://testgrid.io/blog/regression-testing/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Regression testing</a> is one of the best candidates for automation because it ensures that new code changes don’t break existing features.</li><li>Performance and load testing also benefit because they require running thousands of operations under different conditions, something manual testing can’t efficiently handle.</li><li>API testing is another strong example since APIs require frequent validation as integrations evolve. automated testing helps catch issues early, saving time and reducing errors in production.</li></ul><p>Now, let’s review the tests that shouldn’t be automated:</p><ul><li>Exploratory testing, which relies on human intuition, should be best left to manual testers.</li><li>UI/UX testing, where you must assess how a real user interacts with an app, also doesn’t fit well with automation.</li><li>Lastly, if your test cases change frequently, such as in the early stages of development, automating them too soon can result in high maintenance costs without much return.</li></ul><h2>\n  \n  \n  Key Components of Test Automation\n</h2><ul><li>A structured set of guidelines and best practices that define how automation scripts are created, executed, and maintained</li><li>Automated test cases written using programming languages or automation testing tools to validate application functionality</li><li>Managing test data for automation to ensure consistent and repeatable tests</li><li>The component responsible for running the automation scripts on different environments, browsers, and platforms</li><li>Automated logging and reporting of test results to track pass/fail status, logs, screenshots, and execution time</li><li>Stores and manages test scripts, automation framework code, and configurations</li><li>Regularly updating test scripts to accommodate application changes and ensuring automation remains scalable</li></ul><h2>\n  \n  \n  Who Does Test Automation?\n</h2><p>The test engineer or software quality assurance person must have software coding ability since the test cases are written as source code. However, some test automation tools enable test authoring through keywords instead of coding.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  How to Automate a Simple Test Case\n</h2><p>There are many ways to write a test case, and the best-suited role for this test automation is Selenium since it’s a highly versatile framework. Now, let’s write a simple Java program to automate a login function using Selenium WebDriver.</p><p><code>import org.openqa.selenium.By;\nimport org.openqa.selenium.WebDriver;<p>\nimport org.openqa.selenium.WebElement;</p>\nimport org.openqa.selenium.chrome.ChromeDriver;<p>\nimport org.testng.Assert;</p>\nimport org.testng.annotations.Test;<p>\npublic class LoginAutomation { @Test</p>\n    public void login() {<p>\n        // Set the path of the ChromeDriver executable</p>\n        System.setProperty(\"webdriver.chrome.driver\", \"path/to/chromedriver\");\n        WebDriver driver = new ChromeDriver();<p>\n        driver.manage().window().maximize();</p>\n        // Navigate to the TestGrid login page<p>\n        driver.get(\"https://public.testgrid.io/\");</p>\n        // Locate elements and perform login<p>\n        WebElement username = driver.findElement(By.id(\"email\"));</p>\n        WebElement password = driver.findElement(By.id(\"password\"));<p>\n        WebElement login = driver.findElement(By.name(\"submit\"));</p>\n        username.sendKeys(\"your_email\");<p>\n        password.sendKeys(\"your_password\");</p>\n        login.click();<p>\n        // Validate login by checking the URL</p>\n        String expectedUrl = \"https://public.testgrid.io/\";<p>\n        String actualUrl = driver.getCurrentUrl();</p>\n        Assert.assertEquals(actualUrl, expectedUrl);\n        driver.quit();\n}</code></p><ul><li>First, import all the Selenium Webdriver packages required to execute the test case.</li><li>If you’re using the Google Chrome browser, also import the Chrome driver package.</li><li>Structure the test using ImTestNG annotations.</li><li>Instantiate the new Chrome driver instance to launch the browser using the System.setProperty command.</li><li>On using driver.get() command, navigate to the TestGrid login page</li><li>Find elements using the id locator and enter credentials and click the login button.</li><li>When you run the code, Selenium will automatically open the Chrome browser and navigate to the login page of TestGrid.</li><li>After that, it will log in using the appropriate credentials and check the status of the test case by comparing the URL.</li><li>The test case checks whether the login was successful by comparing the current URL with the expected URL.</li></ul><h2>\n  \n  \n  Benefits of Test Automation\n</h2><p>If you’re still questioning why test automation is worth it, here are some automation testing benefits:</p><p>\nA manual tester might take several hours or even days to write and execute test cases, especially for a complex mobile or web app. With test automation, you can run thousands of tests across multiple devices and browsers in minutes.</p><p>\nWhen manually testing an app, it’s possible typos will error, missed steps will happen, and you’ll get tired of writing test scripts repeatedly every time there’s a modification in the code. Test automation executes the same tests with 100% precision—every single time.</p><p>\nDo you want to test every single scenario manually? Not realistic. With test automation, you can run thousands of test cases at once, including edge cases that would be impossible to check manually, and that, too, in a few clicks.</p><p>\nYou need to hire, train, and pay experienced QA engineers for manual testing to run repetitive tests. Test automation has an upfront cost, but over time, it cuts labor costs and minimizes bug-related expenses. It saves you money in the long run.</p><p>\nFixing a bug after the app has been released is 10 times more expensive than catching it during the build. With test automation, you can run tests every time new code is pushed, catching issues before they escalate.</p><p><strong>6. Integration with CI/CD</strong>\nTest automation allows you to automate the entire dev cycle, meaning you can ensure every change is validated immediately. During manual testing, developers need instant feedback on the code, which can slow down the process considerably.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Types of Test Automation Frameworks\n</h2><p><strong>1. Unit testing automation</strong>\nIf you want to ensure every single unit of code of your app, such as a method, module, or function, performs as expected without relying on external dependencies, that’s where unit testing automation comes in.</p><p>It helps you catch errors early before they affect the broader system. It also makes it easy to refactor or extend functionality without breaking the app’s existing features. Popular tools for unit testing include JUnit for Java apps, NUnit for .NET, and Mocha for JavaScript.</p><p><strong>2. Integration testing automation</strong>\nNext comes testing the app’s multiple components or modules to ensure they work as desired. Unlike unit tests that run in isolation, integration testing verifies interactions between different app parts, such as APIs, databases, and microservices.</p><p>You can detect communication failures, data inconsistencies, and broken endpoints. Common integration testing automation tools include Postman for API testing, RestAssured for automated REST API validation, and Selenium WebDriver.</p><p><strong>3. API testing automation</strong>\nIf your app relies on APIs, this test automation enables you to verify backend services and integrations – independent of the GUI implementation.</p><p>API testing is performed at the message layer since APIs serve as the primary interface to app logic. This allows you to check if they function correctly, handle requests and responses properly, and maintain security standards.</p><p>Tools like RestAssured, Postman, and Karate help in API testing automation.</p><p><strong>4. Functional testing automation</strong>\nOne of your testing goals is to ensure all the features related to user interactions, workflows, and business logic perform well. Functional testing automation helps achieve that.</p><p>You can simulate real user actions, such as filling out forms, clicking buttons, and navigating through web pages with automation tools like Selenium and Cypress. For mobile apps, you can use Appium to formulate functional tests on iOS and Android devices.</p><p>Automating functional tests helps you maintain consistency, test edge cases, and speed up release cycles.</p><p><strong>5. Smoke testing automation</strong>\nRun a set of quick, high-level smoke tests to check whether the app’s critical functionalities are working after a build or deployment and if it’s stable enough for more in-depth testing.</p><p>Often called “sanity testing,” it ensures that significant app components load correctly and aren’t broken right from the start. Smoke testing automation is typically executed as part of the CI/CD pipeline using tools like Selenium, JUnit, and TestNG.</p><p><strong>6. Regression testing automation</strong>\nConduct regression testing automation to ensure new code changes don’t introduce unintended defects in previously working functionality. Whenever a new feature is added, a bug is fixed, or an optimization is performed, it ensures existing features function as usual.</p><p>Tools like Katalon Studio, Ranorex, and Selenium help automate regression tests by recording and replaying test scripts across different app versions.</p><p><strong>7. GUI testing automation</strong>\nIf your app has a Graphical User Interface (GUI), testing it is essential to ensure consistency in complex visual elements and dynamic behaviors.</p><p>Rather than manually clicking through screens, you can record and replay user actions to validate buttons, menus, and forms across different devices, screen sizes, and operating systems.</p><p>Tools like TestGrid excel at visual validation. They enable you to capture screenshots and compare them to baselines to fix UI discrepancies.</p><p><strong>8. Security testing automation</strong>\nSecurity testing automation is the way to go if you want to detect vulnerabilities, security flaws, and threats within an app. Test for vulnerabilities like cross-site scripting (XSS), SQL injections, insecure data storage, and authentication flaws.</p><p>Ensure compliance with security standards and prevent potential cyberattacks. Popular security testing tools include Burp Suites, Nessus, and OWASP ZAP. They scan apps for vulnerabilities and generate reports with remediation steps.</p><p><strong>9. Performance testing automation</strong>\nWith performance testing automation, evaluate your app’s behavior under different loads, stress conditions, and concurrent user interactions. Check for resource utilization, response times, and system stability under peak conditions.</p><p>Tools such as LoadRunner, Gatling, and JMeter enable testers to simulate thousands of users accessing an app simultaneously. They provide detailed performance metrics, such as transaction times and error rates, helping you identify bottlenecks and optimize system performance.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  General Approaches to Test Automation\n</h2><p>Although there are many approaches to test automation, two stand out:</p><ul><li><strong>Graphical User Interface (GUI) testing</strong> generates UI events, such as keystrokes and mouse clicks in the app, and observes the changes that result in the user interface to validate that its observable behavior is correct.</li><li> is a framework that interacts with an app’s programming interface to validate its behavior. It bypasses the UI entirely, focusing on testing public interfaces of modules, classes, or libraries. This method provides various input arguments and verifies the correctness of the returned results.</li></ul><h2>\n  \n  \n  Test Automation Methodologies\n</h2><p>To automate software testing efficiently, you need a methodology you can trust. Although there are many approaches and strategies to consider, your decision depends on several factors, such as project size, complexity, team skill set, and available tools.</p><p>Let’s take a look at the most common test automation frameworks:</p><p>\nIf your app is simple and doesn’t require frequent updates, this might seem like an easy solution. Here, you record user interactions with the app and play them back as automated test scripts. Since there’s no need for coding, it’s quick to get started, too.</p><p><strong>2. Modular and framework-based testing</strong>\nHave an app that’s dynamic and demands frequent updates? Go for this approach. Instead of recording everything in one go, break the test cases into smaller, reusable components or modules. Modular and framework-based testing can be sub-categorized into:</p><ul><li>, which lets you define reusable actions in a structured format, making automation accessible even to non-programmers</li><li>, which separates test data from test scripts so you can test multiple scenarios easily</li><li>, which organizes tests into independent units</li><li>, which combines specific elements of the above three frameworks for flexibility</li></ul><p><strong>3. Behavior-Driven Development (BDD)</strong>\nBDD works best in agile environments where multiple stakeholders, such as developers, testers, and business analysts, must collaborate. It allows you to write test cases in plain language, usually using Gherkin syntax, so everyone on your team can understand.</p><p>\nThis involves executing automated tests as part of the software delivery pipeline. It helps obtain immediate feedback on the business risks associated with the app whenever changes are made to its code or configurations.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  What’s Included in Software Testing Automation\n</h2><p>Testing tools can automate various tasks, such as test data creation. product installation, GUI interaction, defect logging, and problem detection (e.g., using parsing or polling agents with test oracles). However, they don’t necessarily automate the end-to-end testing process.</p><p>Therefore, when considering test automation, you must meet key requirements:</p><ul><li>Platform and OS independence</li><li>Support for a distributed execution environment (distributed test bed)</li><li>Support for distributed applications (distributed SUT)</li><li>Common driver compatibility (e.g., Ant or Maven in Java) to integrate with the workflows of developers</li><li>Extensibility and customization (Open APIs for integration with other tools)</li><li>Data-driven capability (input data, output data, metadata)</li><li>Customizable reporting (DB access, Crystal Reports)</li><li>Easy debugging and logging</li><li>Version control friendly (minimal binary files)</li><li>Support for unattended test runs to enable integration with build processes and CI servers</li><li>Email notifications (e.g., bounce messages)</li></ul><h2>\n  \n  \n  How to Set Up Test Automation: A Step-by-Step Process\n</h2><p>If you want test automation to yield positive results in the long run and not break every two days, you must set it up in a structured manner. Let’s take a look at how you can do that in real-world scenarios:</p><p><strong>1. Define your test scope and priorities</strong>\nFirst things first – why are you automating tests?</p><ul><li>Speed up regression testing?</li><li>Improve test coverage across different browsers and devices.</li></ul><p>Automating everything is neither cost-effective nor practical, so you must prioritize test cases. For example, in eCommerce testing, you would want to test core functionalities like adding items to the cart, completing checkout, or applying discount codes.</p><p>These workflows are repetitive and must work flawlessly every time. Automating these tests can ensure they run consistently across different releases.</p><p><strong>2. Choose the right automation tools</strong>\nOnce the test scope is finalized, the next step is to select the right automation testing tools for the task. This will depend on several factors:</p><ul><li>The app you’re trying to test</li><li>The programming language your team is comfortable with</li><li>How well the tool integrates into your CI/CD pipeline</li></ul><p>For instance, if you’re testing a web app, Selenium is a great choice because it supports various programming languages and browsers. However, Appium is a better option for automating tests for Android and iOS apps.</p><p><strong>3. Build a strong automation framework</strong>\nOnce you decide on the tool, it’s time to set up the automation framework. Think of scalability from the start. Even if you have just 10 test cases today, design your framework to support 500 later.</p><p>For example, if you’re testing a travel booking app, leverage a data-driven approach where the same script runs multiple tests using different input data, such as booking flights for different dates, cities, and passenger types.</p><p>Test scripts can quickly become messy, difficult to manage, and hard to update without a framework.</p><p><strong>4. Write and organize test scripts</strong>\nThe next step is to write automation scripts. When doing so, remember the following tips:</p><ul><li>Be modular; break it down into reusable components</li><li>Avoid hardcoding values; instead, store data in separate files</li><li>Use clear naming conventions so that it’s readable for future testers</li></ul><p>For example, if you’re testing a login page, why write separate scripts for different user roles, such as admin, user, and guest? Instead, create one login script that takes different credentials from an external data file. This process will also save you a ton of time.</p><p><strong>5. Integrate with CI/CD for continuous testing</strong>\nTest automation triggers tests automatically whenever new code is pushed, catching bugs early during the build.</p><p>For example, if you work in a DevOps test environment, integrate Selenium tests into Jenkins or GitHub Actions. This means every time you commit a new code, tests will run automatically and report back.</p><p><strong>6. Maintain and update test scripts regularly</strong>\nAutomation isn’t a one-time setup. As your app grows, so does the number of automated test cases. If not optimized, test suites become slow and unmanageable. For example, running a full regression suite with 1,000+ test cases may take hours.</p><p>For instance, if you redesign the checkout page, your old automation scripts might fail because element locators have changed. Therefore, to keep scripts stable:</p><ul><li>Use parallel test execution</li><li>Implement test case prioritization</li><li>Leverage self-healing automation tools</li></ul><p>You must also review failed tests regularly, refactor test scripts to boost efficiency and keep test cases updated with app changes. And if a test keeps failing for no real reason, fix or remove it—don’t let flaky tests ruin your automation confidence.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Top Test Automation Tools in 2025\n</h2><p>Test automation is an investment that pays off in the long when applied to stable and repetitive test cases. However, ongoing manual effort is required for script development, maintenance, and result analysis. That’s why you need a tool that can help you test your app efficiently.</p><p>Here’s a quick introduction to some popular options for automation testing.</p><p>\nTestGrid is an AI-powered end-to-end testing platform that helps you automate testing across different environments—web, mobile, and APIs—without requiring any coding expertise.</p><p>Since it’s a cloud-based platform where you can run automated tests on real devices and browsers, you don’t need to invest in any in-house device labs.

By automating unit tests, developers can speed up the testing process and improve software quality, leading to more efficient development workflows.</p><p><strong>What Is Unit Testing Automation?</strong></p><p>Unit testing automation refers to the practice of using software tools to execute unit tests automatically. These tests focus on individual components or functions of an application to ensure they work as expected in isolation. Unlike manual testing, automation allows for faster execution, increased test coverage, and fewer human errors.</p><p><strong>Why Automate Unit Testing?</strong></p><p>Automating unit tests brings several advantages that help developers build more stable and reliable software:</p><ul><li><strong>Faster Development Cycles</strong> – Automated unit tests run quickly, allowing developers to detect and fix issues early in the development process.</li><li> – Automation makes it easier to test multiple scenarios, including edge cases that might be missed during manual testing.</li><li> – Running automated tests continuously ensures that new code changes do not introduce defects into the system.</li></ul><p><strong>Key Benefits of Unit Testing Automation</strong></p><p>Automated unit tests provide immediate feedback, allowing developers to identify and resolve issues before they escalate. This leads to a smoother and more efficient development process.</p><p>While setting up automated unit tests requires an initial investment, it reduces long-term costs by minimizing manual testing efforts and catching defects early.</p><p>Manual testing is prone to human error, whereas automation ensures that tests are executed the same way every time, leading to more reliable results.</p><p><strong>Popular Unit Testing Frameworks for Automation</strong></p><p>Several frameworks facilitate unit testing automation across different programming languages:</p><ul><li> – A widely used framework for unit testing Java applications, supporting annotations and test lifecycle management.</li><li> – A feature-rich framework for Python testing, allowing easy test case organization and parameterization.</li><li> – Ideal for JavaScript applications, especially those using React, with built-in mocking and snapshot testing.</li><li> – Commonly used for .NET applications, offering powerful assertions and test case grouping.</li></ul><p><strong>How Keploy Enhances Unit Test Automation</strong></p><p>Keploy is an AI-powered testing tool that helps developers automate unit test generation with minimal manual effort. By capturing API interactions and user behaviors, <a href=\"https://keploy.io/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Keploy</a> automatically generates test cases that can be used for validating software functionality.</p><p><strong>Key Features of Keploy for Unit Testing Automation</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Auto-Generated Test Cases</strong> – Eliminates the need for manually writing extensive test cases.</li><li> – Works with popular programming languages and testing frameworks.</li><li> – Provides stable and reliable test execution by minimizing inconsistencies.</li></ul><p>By leveraging Keploy, teams can significantly enhance their unit testing automation strategy, leading to faster and more effective software releases.</p><p><strong>Best Practices for Unit Testing Automation</strong></p><p>Ensure that automated tests are easy to read, modular, and well-documented to make future modifications simpler.</p><p><strong>Integrate with CI/CD Pipelines</strong></p><p>Automate test execution within continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines to ensure that every code change is validated before deployment.</p><p><strong>Mock External Dependencies</strong></p><p>Use mock objects and stubs to isolate units under test, preventing external services from affecting test results.</p><p>Keep automated tests up to date with code changes to ensure they remain effective and relevant.</p><p><strong>Challenges in Unit Testing Automation</strong></p><p>While automation offers numerous benefits, developers may encounter some challenges:</p><ul><li> – Tests that sometimes pass and sometimes fail due to unstable dependencies.</li><li> – Automated tests require regular updates as the application evolves.</li><li><strong>Handling Dynamic Code Changes</strong> – Ensuring that test cases remain effective when frequent code changes occur.</li></ul><p>Using tools like Keploy can help overcome these challenges by reducing manual intervention and maintaining test reliability.</p><p>Unit testing automation is a powerful approach to improving software quality, reducing development time, and catching defects early in the process. By leveraging frameworks like JUnit, PyTest, Jest, and NUnit, along with AI-powered tools like Keploy, teams can streamline their testing strategy and achieve greater efficiency.
