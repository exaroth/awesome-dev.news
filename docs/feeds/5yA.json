There are a lot of things being said about it,</p><p>I get the impression that by entering the market at a time when research and development were progressing and methods were being established through companies like OpenAI, DeepSeek, and Qwen, they were able to save on the huge costs of trial and error and complete the project at a low cost.</p><p>OpenAI is eager to defend its market position with the release of the O3 Mini on Friday, a direct response to Chinese startup DeepSeek’s R1 model.</p><p>Finally couldn’t sit still and launched a new inference model series o3-mini. Not only is the inference model open to free users for the first time, but the cost is also reduced by 15 times compared to the previous o1 series.</p><p>Unlike the GPT-4O and GPT model families, the “O” family of AI models focuses on reasoning tasks. They are less creative but have embedded chains of thought reasoning, making them more capable of solving complex problems, tracing back wrong analyses, and building better-structured codes.</p><p>Not to mention, Alibaba released a new version of its Qwen 2.5 artificial intelligence model, Meanwhile, Qwen is also developing an ultra-large MoE model, Qwen2.5-Max, which is trained using pre-training data of over 20 trillion tokens and a carefully designed post-processing training method.</p><p>Compared to the previous generation model, the Qwen 2.5 model has significantly improved computing power, processing speed, and versatility, and is expected to be particularly useful for business and research purposes.</p><p>However, it is rumoured that  will outperform DeepSeek-R1. In this article, we will explore the true value and future potential of  through its features and mechanisms and compare them with competing models.</p><p>By the time you finish reading, you will be excited and hopeful about the future of AI, and you will want to pick up some “information” that will help you improve business efficiency and innovation. Please stay with us until the end.</p><ul><li><p>If you like this topic and you want to support me:</p></li><li><p>like my article; that will really help me out.👏</p></li><li><p>Follow me on my YouTube channel</p></li><li><p>Subscribe to me to get the latest article.</p></li></ul><p>o3-mini is OpenAI’s first small inference model that supports developer-required functions. It inherits the low-cost and low-latency advantages of o1-mini and supports functions such as function calls, streaming, and structured output.</p><p>Developers can choose the strength of inference according to their needs, balancing the depth of thinking and response speed, but it does not support visual tasks, and visual reasoning still requires the use of o1.</p><p>Outstanding reasoning ability: Compared to its predecessor, the o1-mini, it produces more accurate and clearer answers, providing stronger reasoning ability, and allowing for deeper understanding and logical thinking, which is essential in solving complex problems.</p><p>: Response time is 24% faster than the o1-mini, at an average of 7.7 seconds. You can use it without stress even in situations where real-time response is required.</p><p>: Excels in science, math, coding, and a variety of engineering specialities.</p><p><strong>Developer-oriented features</strong>: Equipped with long-awaited features, such as function calls, structured output, and developer messages, enhancing usability as an engineering tool.</p><p><strong>Flexible inference options</strong>: Three inference effort options are available: low, medium, and high. You can choose the best performance for your situation.</p><p>: It maintains the low cost and low latency of the o1-mini while providing more advanced features, making it cost-effective and accessible to a wide range of users.</p><p>By the way, what is the performance difference between this and the O1 Pro? Of course, this is just a matter of usage, so a strict comparison cannot be made.</p><p>But the O1 Pro is slow to begin with. No matter what code you’re working on, even if you give detailed instructions for each function, it usually takes about 3 minutes.</p><p>It requires a lot of writing code, so it’s not very practical on the O1 Pro.</p><p>That’s why the o3-mini is by far the easiest to use.</p><p>If there was a situation where the o3-mini-high would give an error, I thought I would try using the o1 pro, but so far I haven’t gotten any errors so I can’t compare them</p><p>Qwen 2.5 Max is a particularly high-performance version of the series and has attracted attention for demonstrating benchmark scores that surpass DeepSeek V3. Its main features are its inference speed and ability to handle a variety of tasks, as well as enhanced integration with external services and plugins.</p><p>Qwen 2.5 Max integrates not only language understanding but also image and video generation functions. This gives it the flexibility to handle not only text-based dialogue but also multimodal input</p><p>So, what exactly is the Qwen2.5-Max? Below are its main features.</p><p>Mixture-of-Expert (MoE) ArchitectureUnlike typical transformer-based language models, this architecture uses a combination of multiple “expert” sub-models, making it easier to optimize for specific tasks and improving processing efficiency and accuracy.</p><p>: Pre-training is performed on more than 20 trillion tokens, giving it the ability to understand and generate language across a wide range of domains. It has the advantage of being able to handle a wide range of fields because it greedily learns from all kinds of text data, including news articles, academic papers, and social media posts.</p><p>Advanced fine-tuning (SFT and RLHF)By combining SFT (supervised fine-tuning) and RLHF (reinforcement learning based on human feedback), we have created a mechanism to generate responses that users expect more accurately and naturally. This makes it possible to respond in a way that takes into account the user’s “preferences” and “intentions,” rather than simply reproducing training data.</p><p>: Access is possible via API using Alibaba Cloud’s Model Studio service. It also supports OpenAI-compatible APIs, so it is highly compatible with existing development environments and tools, and you can expect quick implementation and expansion.</p><p>I couldn’t hold myself to compare it with the domestic large model DeepSeek R1 that has swept the entire large model circle.</p><p>This time, we will verify the following items.</p><div><pre><code>\nwriting a p5.js script to simulate 100 colored balls bouncing inside a sphere.\nEach ball should leave a fading trail showing its most recent path. \nThe container sphere should rotate slowly. \nMake sure to implement proper collision detection to keep the ball \ninside the sphere.\n</code></pre></div><div><pre><code>let balls = [];\nlet numBalls = 100;\nlet sphereRadius = 300;\nlet rotationAngle = 0;\n\nfunction setup() {\n  createCanvas(800, 800, WEBGL);\n  for (let i = 0; i &lt; numBalls; i++) {\n    balls.push(new Ball());\n  }\n  noStroke();\n}\n\nfunction draw() {\n  background(0);\n  rotateX(rotationAngle);\n  rotateY(rotationAngle * 0.5);\n\n  // Draw the container sphere (transparent)\n  push();\n  fill(0, 0, 0, 0);\n  stroke(255);\n  sphere(sphereRadius);\n  pop();\n\n  // Update and display balls\n  for (let ball of balls) {\n    ball.update();\n    ball.display();\n  }\n\n  // Slowly rotate the sphere\n  rotationAngle += 0.005;\n}\n\nclass Ball {\n  constructor() {\n    this.pos = p5.Vector.random3D().mult(sphereRadius * 0.8);\n    this.vel = p5.Vector.random3D().mult(2);\n    this.color = color(random(255), random(255), random(255), 200);\n    this.trail = [];\n    this.trailLength = 20;\n  }\n\n  update() {\n    // Update position\n    this.pos.add(this.vel);\n\n    // Collision detection with the sphere\n    let distance = this.pos.mag();\n    if (distance &gt; sphereRadius) {\n      let normal = this.pos.copy().normalize();\n      this.vel = p5.Vector.reflect(this.vel, normal);\n      this.pos = normal.mult(sphereRadius * 0.99); // Slightly inside the sphere\n    }\n\n    // Add current position to the trail\n    this.trail.push(this.pos.copy());\n    if (this.trail.length &gt; this.trailLength) {\n      this.trail.shift();\n    }\n  }\n\n  display() {\n    // Draw the trail\n    for (let i = 0; i &lt; this.trail.length; i++) {\n      let alpha = map(i, 0, this.trail.length, 50, 255);\n      fill(this.color.levels[0], this.color.levels[1], this.color.levels[2], alpha);\n      noStroke();\n      push();\n      translate(this.trail[i].x, this.trail[i].y, this.trail[i].z);\n      sphere(5);\n      pop();\n    }\n\n    // Draw the ball\n    fill(this.color);\n    noStroke();\n    push();\n    translate(this.pos.x, this.pos.y, this.pos.z);\n    sphere(10);\n    pop();\n  }\n}\n</code></pre></div><div><pre><code>// Global parameters\nlet balls = [];\nconst numBalls = 100;\nlet containerRadius;\nconst ballRadius = 5;      // radius for each ball\nconst maxTrailLength = 30; // number of positions to store for the fading trail\n\nfunction setup() {\n  createCanvas(windowWidth, windowHeight, WEBGL);\n  // Set the container sphere radius relative to the canvas size.\n  containerRadius = min(width, height) * 0.4;\n\n  // Create the balls with random positions (inside the sphere) and random velocities.\n  for (let i = 0; i &lt; numBalls; i++) {\n    // Get a random point that is guaranteed to be inside the container\n    let pos = randomPointInSphere(containerRadius - ballRadius);\n    // Give a random 3D direction with a random speed between 1 and 3.\n    let vel = p5.Vector.random3D().mult(random(1, 3));\n    // Random color for the ball.\n    let col = color(random(255), random(255), random(255));\n    balls.push(new Ball(pos, vel, col));\n  }\n\n  // Optional: set a stroke weight for trails\n  strokeWeight(2);\n}\n\nfunction draw() {\n  // Draw a semi-transparent black background so that previous frames slowly fade.\n  // (Adjust the second parameter to change how quickly the trails fade.)\n  background(0, 20);\n\n  // Apply a slow rotation to the entire scene.\n  rotateY(frameCount * 0.005);\n  rotateX(frameCount * 0.003);\n\n  // Update and display each ball.\n  for (let ball of balls) {\n    ball.update();\n    ball.display();\n  }\n\n  // Draw the container sphere (as a semi-transparent wireframe)\n  noFill();\n  stroke(255, 50);\n  sphere(containerRadius);\n}\n\n// Returns a random point uniformly distributed within a sphere of given max radius.\nfunction randomPointInSphere(maxRadius) {\n  let v = p5.Vector.random3D();\n  // Multiply by a random number between 0 and maxRadius to get a point inside the sphere.\n  v.mult(random(0, maxRadius));\n  return v;\n}\n\n// Ball class definition\nclass Ball {\n  constructor(pos, vel, col) {\n    this.pos = pos;\n    this.vel = vel;\n    this.col = col;\n    this.trail = []; // to store previous positions\n  }\n\n  update() {\n    // Move the ball.\n    this.pos.add(this.vel);\n\n    // Collision detection: If the ball goes outside the container sphere,\n    // reflect its velocity.

At Microsoft, I have been deeply involved in big data, telemetry and observability, leading efforts to improve system reliability and operational efficiency. My expertise spans data engineering, AI, machine learning, and open telemetry, and I am passionate about leveraging emerging technologies to optimize workflows. Having witnessed firsthand the challenges of incident management and the strain it places on on-call engineers, I see AI as a game-changer in streamlining incident response. You can learn more about me <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/aarthian/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">here</a>.</p><p>In this blog, I’ll explore how agentic AI can reduce the on-call burden by automating critical steps in issue diagnosis and resolution. While I have implemented some of this at my current company, I'm sharing generic information on all the possibilities using Agentic AI, without sharing anything proprietary. </p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Incidents or Support tickets\n</h2><p>In today's fast-paced digital landscape, on-call engineers play a pivotal role in maintaining system reliability and swiftly addressing incidents. However, the traditional workflow—from customer support identifying an issue to engineers diagnosing and resolving it—often involves multiple back-and-forth communications, leading to delays and increased workloads. Enter AI: autonomous systems capable of making decisions and performing tasks without human intervention. By integrating AI into incident response processes, organizations can streamline operations, reduce on-call burdens, and enhance overall efficiency.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  The Traditional Incident Response Workflow\n</h2><p>Typically, when a field issue arises, the process follows these steps:</p><ol><li> A customer encounters a problem and contacts the support team.</li><li> Customer support collects details about the issue.</li><li> If unresolved, the issue escalates to an on-call engineer.</li><li> The engineer seeks critical information:\n\n<ul><li>When did the issue occur?</li><li>Are all necessary information available to query logs or debug further?</li></ul></li><li> Missing details require reverting to customer support, who then contact the customer again.</li><li> With complete information, the engineer analyzes logs to identify and rectify the root cause.</li></ol><p>This iterative process can cause significant delays, increased workloads, and frustration for both customers and support teams.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Introducing Agentic AI into Incident Response\n</h2><p>Agentic AI systems autonomously perform tasks, make decisions, and adapt to changing environments without human input. In the context of incident response, agentic AI can revolutionize the traditional workflow by:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Automated Issue Detection and Classification:</strong></p><ul><li> AI-driven tools continuously monitor systems, identifying anomalies before they escalate into significant issues. By analyzing patterns and deviations, these tools can detect potential problems early, reducing the frequency of critical incidents. </li><li> Upon detecting an issue, AI systems can classify its severity and potential impact, ensuring that critical problems receive immediate attention while filtering out false positives.</li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Enhanced Data Collection and Analysis:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Contextual Data Gathering:</strong> Agentic AI can automatically collect relevant data—such as timestamps, system logs, and user actions—at the moment an issue is detected, ensuring that on-call engineers have all necessary information upfront.</li><li> By analyzing aggregated data, AI can identify patterns and pinpoint the underlying causes of issues, providing engineers with actionable insights.</li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Automated Communication and Resolution:</strong></p><ul><li> AI-powered virtual assistants can engage with customers in real-time, gathering essential details about the issue through natural language processing, reducing the need for multiple back-and-forth communications.</li><li> For known issues, agentic AI can execute predefined solutions, resolving problems without human intervention and only escalating to on-call engineers when necessary. </li></ul></li></ol><h2>\n  \n  \n  Benefits of Agentic AI in Reducing On-Call Burden\n</h2><p>Integrating agentic AI into incident response workflows offers several advantages:</p><ul><li> Automated detection and data collection expedite the initial phases of incident management, allowing for quicker resolutions.</li><li> By handling routine tasks and minor issues autonomously, AI frees up engineers to focus on more complex problems, reducing burnout and improving job satisfaction.</li><li> AI systems can analyze vast amounts of data without fatigue, leading to more accurate diagnoses and reducing the likelihood of recurring issues.</li><li><strong>Enhanced Customer Satisfaction:</strong> Faster response times and proactive issue resolution lead to a better customer experience, fostering trust and loyalty.</li></ul><h2>\n  \n  \n  Implementing Agentic AI in Your Organization\n</h2><p>To effectively integrate agentic AI into your incident response processes, consider the following steps:</p><ol><li><strong>Assess Current Workflows:</strong> Identify repetitive tasks and common pain points in your existing incident response procedures that could benefit from automation.</li><li><strong>Select Appropriate AI Tools:</strong> Choose AI solutions that align with your organization's specific needs. For instance, platforms like Merlinn offer open-source AI assistants designed to handle system alerts and incidents autonomously. </li><li><strong>Integrate with Existing Systems:</strong> Ensure that the chosen AI tools can seamlessly interface with your current infrastructure, including monitoring systems, communication platforms, and databases.</li><li> Utilize historical incident data to train AI models, enabling them to recognize patterns and make informed decisions.</li><li> Continuously monitor the performance of AI systems, gathering feedback from on-call engineers and support staff to refine and improve AI-driven processes.</li></ol><h2>\n  \n  \n  Challenges and Considerations\n</h2><p>While agentic AI offers numerous benefits, it's essential to be mindful of potential challenges:</p><ul><li><strong>Data Privacy and Security:</strong> Automated systems must handle sensitive information responsibly, adhering to data protection regulations and ensuring that customer data remains secure.</li><li> Maintaining transparency in AI decision-making processes is crucial to build trust among employees and customers. Clear documentation and explainable AI models can aid in this effort.</li><li> AI systems require regular updates and training to adapt to evolving threats and system changes, necessitating ongoing investment in AI development and maintenance.</li></ul><h2>\n  \n  \n  Conclusion: Key Metrics to track - Building Sustainable Incident Management\n</h2><p>Streamlining customer incident response requires a holistic approach combining technical innovation, process optimization, and cultural evolution. By implementing the strategies outlined – from AI-powered triage systems organizations can achieve:</p><ul><li>63-75% Reduction in on-call engineer workload</li><li>55% Faster mean time to resolution (MTTR)</li><li>89% Improvement in engineer job satisfaction</li></ul><p>The path forward demands continuous investment in both technology and people.

It's a common debate that drives developers to extremes—either avoiding AI entirely or frantically signing up for every AI course available.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Why This Conversation Matters\n</h2><p>However, it's not a hypothetical or frivolous concern. Companies  making hiring decisions based on AI productivity. <a href=\"https://www.salesforceben.com/salesforce-will-hire-no-more-software-engineers-in-2025-says-marc-benioff/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Salesforce's CEO recently announced</a> plans to reduce hiring software and support engineers after seeing a 30% productivity boost from AI.</p><p>As a Developer Advocate in AI, my public response has always been to upskill and adapt to the changing economy. After all, you wouldn't want to be the person insisting on driving a horse and buggy while everyone else has moved on to cars.</p><p>I believe that AI  a helpful tool. I've used it to understand new technologies and quickly prototype ideas. </p><p>But internally, I've wrestled with a different question: Why do we keep framing AI primarily as a replacement for human beings?</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  How AI Marketing Shaped This Perception\n</h2><p>My spicy take is that our industry helped shape this narrative. We inadvertently leaned into a lazy marketing strategy prioritizing quick wins over sustainable adoption. It's easier to tell VCs and executives that your AI tool replaces developers than to demonstrate how it augments developer capabilities.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Anthropomorphism Is Not All Bad\n</h3><p>Anthropomorphism is the practice of assigning human traits to non-human entities. It isn't inherently problematic. In fact, it's a common practice in tech. Thoughtful anthropomorphism makes digital experiences more intuitive and helps users embrace new interfaces. For example: </p><ul><li>E-books mirror traditional reading experiences by simulating page-turning animations, even though there's no physical page to turn.</li><li>Electric cars (as <a href=\"https://bsky.app/profile/threepointone.bsky.social/post/3lbepxmdwek23\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Sunil Pai pointed out to me</a>) play pre-recorded engine sounds when they start, providing a familiar affordance for drivers.</li></ul><p>In these cases, users don't actually believe their e-book contains paper or that their electric car has a combustion engine. </p><p>But, AI presents a unique challenge. Its complexity and \"black box\" nature make it harder for users to grasp its true capabilities and limitations. To bridge this knowledge gap, companies lean heavily into human-like descriptions:</p><h4>\n  \n  \n  Devin is an \"AI Software Engineer.\"\n</h4><p>While these descriptions make AI feel more familiar, the drawback is that they can also mislead users to believe that AI can think, reason, and work independently like humans.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  The Problem with Marketing AI as a Human\n</h2><p>Anthropomorphic AI marketing is sometimes a form of self-sabotage because:</p><ul><li>When AI is marketed as an \"engineer\" or \"developer, \" decision-makers view it as a one-to-one substitute for human talent.</li><li>This is counterproductive because developers are some of the most valuable users of AI tools. They are the users who know how to use AI and contribute to the ecosystem effectively. According to the <a href=\"https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2024/ai#1-ai-tools-in-the-development-process\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">2024 Stack Overflow Developer Survey</a>, 76% of developers currently use or plan to incorporate AI into their workflows. However, our industry's marketing suggests that using AI and contributing to the ecosystem will eventually put AI in a place to take their jobs. So why would they want to further the movement?</li></ul><h3>\n  \n  \n  It Sets Unrealistic Expectations\n</h3><ul><li>If an AI tool is marketed as \"just like a human,\" users will expect it to perform at human levels.</li><li>AI is a non-sentient tool that processes historical data patterns, is prone to hallucinating, misses important context, and provides non-deterministic output.</li><li>When developers realize it's not as good as the marketing implied, the company and product risk losing credibility. Developers are notorious for valuing authenticity. Over-exaggeration or misrepresentation in marketing only drives developers away.</li></ul><p>One survey participant shared their reflections: \"I have a PhD in AI, worked to develop some of the algorithms used by generative AI. I deeply regret how naively I offered up my contributions.\"</p><p>Another participant stated, \"We should use generative AI to help people be faster at their jobs, not lose them.\"</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  It Misses the Real Value Proposition\n</h3><p>The real value of AI developer tools includes automating boring tasks, faster prototyping, and quicker debugging, which leaves more time for creative problem-solving.</p><p>And now, AI enthusiasts have dubbed 2025 as the Year of the Agent. In short, <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/ai-agents/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">AI agents</a> are tools that can autonomously take action on our behalf, like executing shell commands, creating calendar events, and building applications. But as we move from LLMs that suggestion code to us to more autonomous agents, anthropomorphic marketing is only increasing.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Framework for Effectively Marketing AI Agents to Developers\n</h2><p>Here's how to market AI developer tools in a way that both builds trust and differentiates your Agent in an oversaturated market:</p><p>If you work in Developer Relations, Sales, Marketing, or as an executive promoting an AI agent, you're probably representing a product you didn't build. This means you may not fully understand how the tool works, its true capabilities, or its limitations. Developers have a knack for spotting misrepresentation or inauthentic marketing.</p><p>You can mitigate this challenge by:</p><ul><li>Becoming customer zero \n\n<ul><li>Use the product extensively before it reaches the public</li></ul></li><li>Investing time in learning the following fundamentals:\n\n<ul><li>LLMs and their capabilities</li><li>Key differences between Copilots and Agents</li><li>Core AI Agent operations and your product's unique approach</li><li>Token handling and context management</li><li>Points requiring human intervention</li><li>Your product's agentic loop. For example, some agents use the following loop: \n\n<ul><li>Share requests and available tools with an LLM</li><li>Receive LLM's execution plan</li><li>Execute the plan and tool calls</li><li>Verify results with the LLM</li><li>Revise and re-execute if needed</li><li>Deliver final results to the user and wait for the user's request</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul><p>I used these two resources to help me understand AI agents:</p><p>It might be difficult to eliminate anthropomorphism entirely, especially since it is useful. My advice is to use it sparingly. Skip titles like \"AI Engineer\" or \"AI Teammate.\" Choose names that set clear expectations, like Copilot, Agent, or Assistant. GitHub's use of \"Copilot\" and \"AI Pair Programming Assistant\" exemplifies this balance because it suggests collaboration while keeping humans in control. </p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Augmentation &gt; Replacement\n</h3><p>Let's understand who developers are. They're not rockstar/ninja/10x developers. Those stereotypes are so 2014.  </p><p>Developers juggle multiple roles – they're parents, open source maintainers, bootcamp instructors, and more. AI agents shine brightest when they complement these diverse responsibilities, taking on parallel tasks while developers focus on high-impact work. Instead of marketing your tools as whole substitutes for developers, position them as tools part of a developer's toolkit.</p><p>If possible, go open source. If not, find ways to explain the architecture through whitepapers and conference talks. This approach will help your users understand that it's not magic so they can determine how to use the product and get the best performance from it. </p><p>Many times, when there's a lack of transparency, developers will theorize how they think it works and create their own narrative, which can backfire on your product. I remember this happened in the early days of GitHub Copilot. I would hop into Twitter Spaces, where people would share how they thought it worked, but they were wrong and spreading misinformation.</p><p>You can build trust with developers by putting them in control of their workflow. Here are some of my suggestions:</p><ul><li>Similar to how developers choose IDE settings, allow developers to choose their preferred LLM models and customize the Agent's behavior and verbosity.</li><li>Show what actions the Agent will take before executing them and provide detailed logs for debugging.</li><li>Provide APIs and hooks so the Agent fits into existing workflows. </li></ul><p><a href=\"http://block.github.io/goose\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">codename goose</a> is my favorite example of this, although I'm biased because it's an agent my company made. It's open source. Goose, as it's fondly called, lets developers choose their LLM model and extensions via <a href=\"https://www.anthropic.com/news/model-context-protocol\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Model Context Protocol</a>. Developers can also choose to interact with the Agent via the CLI or GUI.</p><p>Instead of making false promises, demonstrate your AI agent's value through concrete examples. Create short, engaging video demos, GIFs, or blog posts showing the Agent in action:</p><ul><li>Creating and running test suites</li><li>Converting code between languages</li><li>Transforming wireframes into interactive UIs</li><li>Generating API documentation from code comments</li><li>Automating environment setup</li></ul><p>Don't be afraid to demo live and make it fun so it can be memorable! When I worked at GitHub, I used to demo GitHub Copilot at conferences. I would prompt GitHub Copilot to post a tweet that said, \"I wrote this tweet with Copilot.\" It was a short and simple demo that was memorable for attendees and sparked curiosity from those who weren't there.</p><p>: Demoing generative AI tools live is scary because the output is non-deterministic. If your live demo fails, that's even better because you can use it as a teaching moment. Show how you work around issues and where human expertise adds value. This authenticity builds more trust than a perfectly polished demo ever could.</p><p>Documentation often determines whether developers adopt your tool. Strong documentation for your Agent could include:</p><ul><li>Accurate technical specifications of model training and limitations</li><li>Comprehensive feature guides</li><li>Clear explanations of data usage and privacy</li></ul><p>Build product credibility by fostering an ecosystem where developers can learn from each other, and you can learn from them. You can do this by:</p><ul><li>Using platforms like GitHub Discussions and Discord to create spaces for feedback and support</li><li>Encouraging knowledge sharing by letting developers exchange prompts, best practices, and integrations</li><li>Recognizing community contributions</li><li>Maintaining a transparent feedback loop to show that you value developer input</li></ul><p>A great example is <a href=\"https://cursor.directory\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Cursor.directory</a> - a platform by and for the community where developers share  prompts.</p><p>Our presentation of AI shapes how the world perceives and uses it. Let's move beyond the tired question of whether AI will replace developers and focus on how it can augment developer capabilities.</p><p>Share your thoughts below!</p>","contentLength":10518,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"The Magic of Embeddings: How AI Understands Language Like Humans","url":"https://dev.to/kumarprateek18/the-magic-of-embeddings-how-ai-understands-language-like-humans-741","date":1739761804,"author":"Prateek kumar","guid":881,"unread":true,"content":"<p>Ever wondered how AI chatbots generate relevant, intelligent responses in real-time? The secret lies in —the technology that enables AI to understand and process language, images, and data like humans. These powerful numerical representations allow AI to  meaningful content, forming the backbone of <strong>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)</strong>.</p><p>In this blog, we’ll explore what embeddings are, how they work, and why they are crucial for AI-driven applications like chatbots, search engines, and recommendation systems.</p><p>Embeddings are numerical representations of words, sentences, images, or documents in a high-dimensional space. They allow AI models to capture semantic relationships between different pieces of data. Instead of using plain text, AI converts these elements into vectors (arrays of numbers), enabling efficient comparison and retrieval.</p><h3><strong>Why Are Embeddings Important?</strong></h3><p>Traditional keyword-based search methods rely on exact word matches, which have major limitations:</p><ul><li>They fail to understand synonyms (e.g., \"car\" and \"automobile\" are considered different words).</li><li>They do not capture contextual meaning (e.g., \"bank\" as a financial institution vs. \"bank\" as a riverbank).</li><li>They struggle with large datasets, making searches inefficient.</li></ul><p>Embeddings solve these problems by representing words, phrases, and documents as vectors in a mathematical space, allowing AI systems to <strong>find similarities based on meaning rather than exact wording</strong>.</p><h2><strong>How Are Embeddings Used in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)?</strong></h2><p>One of the most powerful applications of embeddings is in <strong>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)</strong>. RAG combines <strong>retrieval (finding relevant data)</strong> with <strong>generation (creating responses using an LLM)</strong> to produce intelligent, context-aware answers.</p><ol><li> Documents are split into smaller chunks and transformed into embeddings.</li><li> When a user asks a question, the system converts the query into an embedding and finds the most relevant chunks.</li><li> The retrieved chunks are provided as context to an LLM (like GPT-4), which generates a response based on the retrieved knowledge.</li></ol><p>RAG ensures that AI models can access <strong>up-to-date, domain-specific knowledge</strong> while maintaining  in responses, making it ideal for chatbots, search engines, and enterprise AI applications.</p><h2><strong>How Are Embeddings Created?</strong></h2><p>Embeddings are generated using machine learning models trained on vast amounts of text or image data. Some popular models include:</p><ul><li> (for fast similarity search)</li></ul><h3><strong>Mathematical Representation</strong></h3><p>Each word or sentence is represented as a point in an N-dimensional space. The closer two vectors are in this space, the more similar they are in meaning. For example:</p><div><table><thead><tr></tr></thead><tbody></tbody></table></div><p>Here, \"king\" and \"queen\" have similar embeddings, while \"apple\" is farther apart, indicating that it belongs to a different concept.</p><h2><strong>How Are Embeddings Used in AI Applications?</strong></h2><h3><strong>1.

Similarity Search &amp; Information Retrieval</strong></h3><p>Instead of searching by keywords, AI can retrieve documents or images by . When a user queries a system, the system:</p><ol><li>Converts the query into an embedding.</li><li>Searches for similar embeddings in the vector database.</li><li>Returns the most relevant documents, even if they use different words.</li></ol><h3><strong>3. Recommendation Systems</strong></h3><p>Spotify, Netflix, and YouTube use embeddings to recommend content:</p><ul><li>If you watch sci-fi movies, the system retrieves other movies with similar embeddings.</li><li>Music streaming services recommend songs based on user-listened embeddings.</li></ul><h3><strong>4. Search Engine Optimization (SEO)</strong></h3><p>Google’s search algorithm heavily relies on embeddings to rank pages by  rather than exact keyword matches.</p><h2><strong>Mathematical Explanation of Similarity Search</strong></h2><p>To find similar embeddings, AI systems use , which measures the angle between two vectors.</p><h3><strong>Formula for Cosine Similarity:</strong></h3><p>cos(θ) = (A · B) / (||A|| * ||B||).</p><ul><li>(||A||) and (||B||) are the  of the vectors.</li></ul><p>If , the vectors are identical (perfect match).

It was supposed to be the holy grail, the key to unlocking truly knowledgeable and reliable AI.</p><p>Well, buckle up, because the ground is shifting. Faster than you can say \"context window,\"  has arrived, and it's throwing a serious wrench into the RAG machine. Dare I say, it might even be… </p><p>Okay, maybe \"killing\" is dramatic. But as a writer and AI enthusiast, I’m seeing a seismic shift. And if you’re building AI applications, you need to pay attention.</p><p><strong>First, a Quick RAG Refresher (For the Uninitiated):</strong></p><p>Imagine an LLM as a brilliant but slightly forgetful savant. It knows language inside and out, but its knowledge of the world is limited to what it was trained on. **RAG **is like giving that savant a constantly updated encyclopedia.</p><ul><li><p>: When you ask a question, RAG first searches a vast external knowledge base (think documents, databases, websites).</p></li><li><p>: It then injects the relevant information it finds into the prompt it sends to the LLM.</p></li><li><p>: The LLM, now armed with fresh, context-specific knowledge, generates a more informed and accurate answer.</p></li></ul><p><strong>RAG was brilliant in theory and often effective in practice. It allowed us to:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Overcome LLM knowledge cut-offs:</strong> Access information beyond the training data.</li><li><strong>Improve accuracy and reduce hallucinations:</strong> Ground answers in verifiable facts.</li><li><strong>Customize knowledge for specific domains:</strong> Tailor AI to niche industries and datasets.</li></ul><p><strong>So, what's the problem? Why is Gemini Flash 2.0 potentially turning RAG into yesterday's news?</strong></p><p><strong>Enter Gemini Flash 2.0: The Context King</strong></p><p>The core issue with RAG, despite its ingenuity, is its inherent complexity and overhead. It's like adding a complex plumbing system to your AI application. It works, but it’s… well, complex.</p><p>, on the other hand, takes a drastically different approach. Its game-changing feature? A MASSIVE context window.</p><p>We're talking about . Let that sink in. That's enough to feed entire books, research papers, and vast swathes of data directly into the model's prompt.</p><p>Suddenly, the need for external retrieval shrinks dramatically. Gemini Flash 2.0 can effectively become its own RAG system, internally digesting and processing huge amounts of information within a single prompt.</p><p>Here's why this is a potential  from a practical perspective:</p><ul><li><strong>Simplicity and Efficiency:</strong> Forget building complex retrieval pipelines, indexing knowledge bases, and managing data flow between systems. Gemini Flash 2.0 streamlines everything. You feed it the data, and it just… knows. This means faster development, simpler deployment, and less maintenance.</li><li> RAG solutions often require significant infrastructure to manage the knowledge base, retrieval mechanisms, and data processing. Gemini Flash 2.0, with its massive context window, potentially reduces this overhead significantly. You're paying for a powerful model, not a complex ecosystem around it.</li><li><strong>Speed and Real-time Access:</strong> RAG introduces latency. There's a delay for retrieval, processing, and augmentation before the LLM even generates the answer. Gemini Flash 2.0, with its internalized knowledge, can potentially provide faster, near real-time responses, as the relevant information is already within its processing scope.</li><li><strong>Reduced Complexity for Developers:</strong> Let's be honest, implementing and fine-tuning RAG can be a developer headache. Gemini Flash 2.0 promises to simplify AI development, allowing developers to focus on the core application logic rather than the intricate data plumbing.</li></ul><ul><li><strong>Customer Service Chatbots:</strong> Instead of RAG searching FAQs and knowledge articles, you could feed a vast, updated knowledge base directly into Gemini Flash 2.0's context window.

While the fundamental goal remains to survive and outlast the competition, what truly sets the best games apart is their depth and complexity. A strong Hunger Game Simulator must include a variety of elements that challenge players' survival instincts, strategic thinking, and adaptability.\nKey Aspects of a Great Hunger Game Simulator\nRealistic survival elements: Managing hunger, health, stamina, and other survival factors adds realism and urgency to the game.\nDiverse environments: Multiple arenas with varying environmental conditions encourage diverse strategies and replayability.\nCharacter progression and customization: Players should have the ability to upgrade and personalize their characters, making each playthrough unique.\nDynamic gameplay: Random events, environmental hazards, and interactions with AI or other players create an ever-changing experience.\nSurvivor's Edge embodies all these characteristics, offering an exciting and multifaceted Hunger Game Simulator experience that stands out from the crowd.</li><li>Key Features of Survivor's Edge: The Hunger Games Experience\n3.1 Character Customization\nOne of the highlights of Survivor's Edge: The Hunger Games Experience is its in-depth character customization system. Players are given the opportunity to create and shape their character from the ground up, selecting not just appearance but also traits and abilities. Whether you want to play as a stealthy and nimble character or a powerhouse who excels in combat, the game allows for a wide variety of styles.\nCustomization goes beyond just visual aesthetics—it directly impacts how the character performs in the arena. For example, players can choose their character’s strength, endurance, agility, and intelligence, which affects how they interact with the environment and deal with challenges. This personalization allows for a unique Hunger Game Simulator experience each time, as players can experiment with different builds and strategies.\n3.2 Immersive Arena Design\nThe design of the arena in Survivor's Edge is a critical aspect that sets the game apart. Rather than offering a single, static arena, the game features multiple dynamic environments, each with its own challenges and opportunities. The arenas are beautifully crafted and designed to evoke a sense of urgency and danger, with different zones providing varying degrees of cover, obstacles, and hazards.\nFor instance, some arenas might be lush forests filled with resources and hiding spots, while others could be desolate wastelands where survival is more about scrounging for what little you can find. The changing weather, day-night cycles, and natural disasters like fires or floods make each arena feel alive and unpredictable, forcing players to adapt on the fly.\nThis level of immersion enhances the Hunger Game Simulator experience, making the environment an active participant in the battle for survival.\n3.3 Dynamic Survival Mechanics\nSurvival isn’t just about outlasting your opponents in Survivor’s Edge—it’s about thriving in the harsh conditions of the arena. The game introduces dynamic survival mechanics that require players to think strategically about their actions. Players need to manage essential resources like food, water, and medical supplies to keep their character alive and at their peak performance.\nThe mechanics are realistic: players must search for resources, hunt animals, gather plants, or scavenge abandoned buildings to find what they need. The stress of keeping track of your hunger, hydration, and stamina adds an extra layer of difficulty to the game, making each decision critical. Do you risk your life searching for more supplies or do you take a chance and confront another player? These tough decisions are what keep players on the edge of their seats.\n3.4 Combat Systems and Strategies\nCombat in Survivor’s Edge is fast-paced, intense, and highly strategic. The game features a wide array of weapons and tools, from melee items like knives and axes to ranged weapons such as bows and firearms. However, it’s not just about brute force. The game emphasizes smart combat—using the environment to your advantage, ambushing opponents, and managing your stamina during fights.\nPlayers can also craft makeshift weapons from available resources, creating even more opportunities for tactical gameplay. The combat system rewards strategy over mindless aggression, encouraging players to plan their attacks carefully. You’ll need to decide whether to engage in direct combat or use stealth to avoid detection and stay hidden. Every encounter is a chance to outsmart your opponent and claim victory.\n3.5 Replayability and Endless Challenges\nOne of the main draws of Survivor’s Edge is its replayability. No two matches are the same, thanks to the procedurally generated arenas, random events, and diverse character builds. The Hunger Game Simulator aspect of the game means that every match offers new challenges, forcing players to constantly evolve their strategies.\nWhether you’re trying out a new character with a different set of skills or tackling a new arena, the game’s depth ensures that you’ll never run out of challenges. Additionally, the game’s difficulty scales as you progress, ensuring that each victory feels earned and every defeat is a lesson.</li><li>A Step-by-Step Guide to Playing Survivor's Edge: The Hunger Games Experience\n4.1 Step 1: Create Your Character\nThe first step in Survivor’s Edge is creating your character. Choose your appearance, set your skills, and decide on the type of survivor you want to be. Make sure to think about how your character’s skills will impact your strategy in the arena. Will you focus on stealth, combat, or survival skills? Your choices here will set the stage for your entire gameplay experience.\n4.2 Step 2: Select an Arena\nAfter creating your character, it’s time to choose your arena. Each arena offers different strategic advantages, so carefully consider your strengths and weaknesses. Some arenas may be more suited to players who prefer ranged combat, while others might benefit stealthy, resourceful survivors. Select an arena that aligns with your chosen playstyle.\n4.3 Step 3: Enter the Arena\nOnce you’re in the arena, the game begins. Your primary goal is to gather resources, avoid dangers, and stay alive. Use the environment to your advantage—whether that means finding shelter, setting traps, or ambushing enemies. Keep an eye on your hunger, thirst, and stamina levels while preparing for combat when necessary.\n4.4 Step 4: Survive and Fight\nAs the game progresses, you’ll face other players or AI-controlled enemies. Use your weapons, skills, and the environment to engage in combat strategically. Always be mindful of your surroundings and adjust your tactics based on the changing conditions of the arena.\n4.5 Step 5: Claim Victory\nThe ultimate goal is to be the last one standing. If you can outlast all opponents, whether through combat or sheer survival, you’ll emerge as the victor. Every match is an opportunity to refine your strategies and become better at surviving in the Hunger Game Simulator environment.</li><li>Mastering Survivor's Edge: Expert Strategies for Success\n5.1 Understand Your Environment\nTake the time to learn the layout of each arena. Some areas may offer better cover for stealth, while others provide high ground for ranged attacks. Understanding the environment gives you a tactical advantage, helping you anticipate hazards and opportunities.\n5.2 Manage Resources Wisely\nEfficiently managing your resources is key to survival. Don’t waste food or water unnecessarily, and keep an eye on your stamina. Running low on resources can lead to dangerous situations, so always plan ahead.\n5.3 Combat with Precision\nRather than charging headfirst into combat, take time to observe your enemies. Look for openings, use the environment to your advantage, and strike when you’re sure you have the upper hand. Avoid unnecessary risks that might leave you vulnerable.\n5.4 Adapt to Changing Conditions\nBe ready for anything.

The AI landscape is constantly evolving, with new models pushing the boundaries of what's possible. But one name has been making waves recently, i.e, . Unlike other AI tools, this powerhouse has rewritten the rulebook on efficiency, cost-effectiveness, and performance. If you haven't heard of it yet, here’s why it’s capturing global attention.</p><h3><strong>What Is DeepSeek and Why Is It Gaining Popularity?</strong></h3><p>In January 2025, DeepSeek, a Chinese AI company, emerged as a major player in the AI space. Developed by a Chinese AI lab, it rapidly climbed the app store rankings, even surpassing ChatGPT as the most popular free AI assistant in the US.\nBut what’s driving the hype? DeepSeek-R1 isn’t just another AI model—it’s an example of cutting-edge efficiency at a fraction of the usual cost. Unlike its competitors, which require massive investments,  was trained for just —a game-changing breakthrough in AI development.</p><h3><strong>Innovation Behind DeepSeek</strong></h3><p>DeepSeek’s strength lies in its  training method, which splits its AI into specialized sub-models. Instead of a single large neural network handling everything, each part of DeepSeek is optimized for specific tasks, making it both  and more .\nAnother key advantage is its , which adjusts processing power based on task complexity. This means DeepSeek can deliver high performance while using significantly fewer resources compared to other models.</p><p>Moreover, instead of relying on Nvidia’s high-end H100 chips, DeepSeek utilizes the more affordable , making AI training and deployment  cheaper than models like </p><h3><strong>DeepSeek-R1 helping open-source community</strong></h3><p>DeepSeek released its flagship model, DeepSeek-R1, under the . This model, developed with remarkable resource efficiency—using approximately 2,000 Nvidia H800 GPUs over 55 days demonstrated performance on par with leading AI models from established tech giants. DeepSeek has made significant strides in the artificial intelligence landscape by open-sourcing its advanced AI models. \nThe open-source release of DeepSeek-R1 has lowered barriers to AI development, fostering innovation and competition across the global AI community. The company has also released models like , designed to enhance code intelligence, and , aimed at advancing vision-language understanding. These models are available for public use and modification, promoting transparency and collaboration in AI research and application.</p><h3><strong>How DeepSeek Outperforms Other AI Models</strong></h3><p>Beyond its efficiency, DeepSeek is redefining AI reliability with its R1 Reasoning Model. Unlike traditional models, the probability of the R1 Reasoning Model giving appealing outputs is much higher as compared to other available models since this model is designed to validate its own reasoning supporting its output, improving accuracy in subjects like math, science, and fact-checking.\nThis makes DeepSeek particularly powerful for research, problem-solving, and advanced computations, offering a level of precision that many AI models like  from OpenAI,  from MetaAI, and  from Google, etc struggle to achieve.</p><h3><strong>Challenges and Limitations</strong></h3><p>Despite its impressive capabilities, DeepSeek isn’t without challenges. Its business model remains uncertain, as it offers services at a significantly lower cost than competitors, raising questions about long-term sustainability. If integrated into government or corporate infrastructure, DeepSeek AI could be exploited for surveillance by foreign adversaries, affecting nation's cybersecurity. Although being open-source, certain components of the model (e.g., training datasets and fine-tuned versions) might be controlled by external entities, leading to potential data leaks.\nAdditionally, being developed in China, DeepSeek follows strict content regulations. Topics such as <strong>Taiwan’s political status</strong> or the <strong>Tiananmen Square incident</strong> are restricted due to Chinese internet policies, which may affect its global adaptability.</p><h3><strong>What’s Next for DeepSeek and AI?</strong></h3><p>DeepSeek’s rise proves that bigger isn’t always better. With its cost-effective approach, rapid deployment, and self-reasoning abilities, it’s challenging industry giants and setting a new standard for AI development.\nWhether you’re a developer, researcher, or AI enthusiast, DeepSeek is worth watching.

While the hardware can be used in many ways, it’s marketed as a turnkey means of creating and querying an AI model. Last year, the MITRE Corporation, a federally funded military R&amp;D lab, acquired a $20 million SuperPod setup to train bespoke AI models for use by government agencies, touting the purchase as a “massive increase in computing power” for the United States.</p><p>How exactly the IRS will use its SuperPod is unclear. An agency spokesperson said the IRS had no information to share on the supercomputer purchase, including which presidential administration ordered it. A 2024 report by the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration identified 68 different AI-related projects underway at the IRS; the Nvidia cluster is not named among them, though many were redacted.</p><p>But some clues can be gleaned from the purchase materials. “The IRS requires a robust and scalable infrastructure that can handle complex machine learning (ML) workloads,” the document explains. “The Nvidia Super Pod is a critical component of this infrastructure, providing the necessary compute power, storage, and networking capabilities to support the development and deployment of large-scale ML models.”</p><p>The document notes that the SuperPod will be run by the IRS Research, Applied Analytics, and Statistics division, or RAAS, which leads a variety of data-centric initiatives at the agency. While no specific uses are cited, it states that this division’s Compliance Data Warehouse project, which is behind this SuperPod purchase, has previously used machine learning for automated fraud detection, identity theft prevention, and generally gaining a “deeper understanding of the mechanisms that drive taxpayer behavior.”</p><figure><blockquote><p>“The IRS has probably more proprietary data than most agencies that is totally untapped.”</p></blockquote></figure><p>It’s unclear from the document whether the SuperPod purchase had been planned under the Biden administration or if it represents a new initiative of the Trump administration.</p><p>Some funding from the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act&nbsp;was earmarked for upgrading IRS technology generally, said Travis Thompson, a tax attorney with Boutin Jones with an expertise in IRS AI strategy. But “the IRS has been going toward AI for quite some time prior to IRA funding,” Thompson explained. “They didn’t have enough money to properly enforce the tax code, they were looking for ways to do more with less.” A June 2024 Government Accountability Office report <a href=\"https://www.gao.gov/blog/artificial-intelligence-may-help-irs-close-tax-gap\">suggested</a> the IRS use artificial intelligence-based software to retrieve “hundreds of billions of dollars [that] are potentially missing from what should be collected in taxes each year.”</p><p>Thompson added that the agency is ripe for machine-learning training because of the mountain of personal and financial data it sits atop. “The IRS has probably more proprietary data than most agencies that is totally untapped. When you look at something like this Nvidia cluster and training machine learning algorithms going forward, it makes perfect sense, because they have the data there. AI needs data. It needs lots of it. And it needs it quickly. And the IRS has it.”</p><p>The purchase comes at a crossroads for U.S. governance of artificial intelligence tech. In Trump’s first term, the RAAS office was assigned “responsibility for monitoring and overseeing AI at the IRS” under Executive Order 13960, which he signed shortly before leaving office in 2020. This executive order put an emphasis on the “responsible,” “safe” implementation of AI by the United States — an approach that has fallen out of favor by American tech barons who now advocate for the breakneck development of these technologies unburdened by <a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2019/12/20/mit-ethical-ai-artificial-intelligence/\">consideration of ethics</a> or risk. One of Trump’s first moves following his inauguration was reversing a Biden administration executive order calling for greater AI safety guardrails in government use.</p><p>Many of the&nbsp;AI industry for whom “safe AI” is now anathema have become close allies of the new Trump White House, such as Elon Musk and venture capitalist Marc Andreessen. This wing of Silicon Valley has reportedly pushed the new administration to leverage artificial intelligence to help dismantle the administrative state via automation.</p><p>This week, the Wall Street Journal <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/politics/policy/doge-internal-revenue-service-9697cb99\">reported</a> Musk’s liquidators had arrived at the IRS, an agency long the target of disparagement and <a href=\"https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2024/aug/28/donald-trump/fact-check-trump-falsely-said-harris-voted-to-hire/\">distortion</a> by Trump and <a href=\"https://time.com/6204928/irs-87000-agents-factcheck-biden/\">Republican</a> allies. Days before, the New York Times <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/10/us/politics/irs-dhs-immigration.html\">reported</a>, “Representatives from the so-called Department of Government Efficiency have sought information about the tax collector’s information technology, with a goal of automating more work to replace the need for human staff members.”</p><p>The IRS has in recent years increasingly turned to AI for automated fraud detection and chatbot-based support services — including through <a href=\"https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/case-studies/fraud-detection-applications/\">collaboration</a> with Nvidia — but a new Nvidia supercomputer could also be a boon to those interested in shrinking the agency’s human headcount as much as possible. A February 8 report by the Washington Post <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2025/02/08/doge-musk-goals/\">quoted</a> an unnamed federal official who described Musk’s end goal as “replacing the human workforce with machines,” and that “Everything that can be machine-automated will be. And the technocrats will replace the bureaucrats.”</p><p>Musk underlings are reportedly contemplating <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/13/us/doge-ai-education-department-students.html\">replacing humans</a> at the Department of Education with a large language-based chatbot, as well.</p><p>Wired previously <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/elon-musk-lieutenant-gsa-ai-agency/\">reported</a> that Musk loyalist Thomas Shedd, placed in a directorship within the General Services Administration, has talked of an “AI-first” agenda for Trump’s second term; DOGE staffers have already reportedly<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2025/02/06/elon-musk-doge-ai-department-education/\"> turned to Microsoft’s Azure AI platform for advice</a> on slashing programs. While the Nvidia SuperPod couldn’t on its own replicate services like those provided by Microsoft, it is powerful enough to train AI models based on government data.</p><p>Thompson told The Intercept that efforts to slash the federal workforce and more aggressively deploy artificial intelligence systems fit hand-in-glove.</p><p>“I firmly believe that rooted behind the reduction in the human workforce that seems to be goal of current administration, there’s an overarching goal there to implement more technology-based systems in order to do the jobs,” he explained. “If you’re going to reduce your workforce, something has to pick up the slack. Something has to do the job.”</p>","contentLength":7194,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/1iqo4nj/the_irs_is_buying_an_ai_supercomputer_from_nvidia/"},{"title":"5 Websites to Help You Stand Out on Social Media","url":"https://dev.to/jsam/5-websites-to-help-you-stand-out-on-social-media-59i3","date":1739694445,"author":"jsam","guid":583,"unread":true,"content":"<p>In today's digital age, social media has become an integral part of our lives.

The term \"malware\" is derived from two words: \"mal,\" meaning malicious, and \"ware,\" meaning software, forming the word \"malware.\"</p><p>Typically, malware is created by illegal hackers, commonly known as black hat hackers. These programs are highly capable and can cause severe damage to both organizations and individuals. Once installed on a device, malware exploits it by accessing messages, call logs, browser history, and even bank balances or other sensitive information.</p><p>Once again, malware consists of illegal software used by black hat hackers and crackers. There are various types of malware, mainly viruses, spyware, trojans, ransomware, keyloggers, and worms. In this discussion, we will explore them in detail.</p><p>Here are some common types of malwares that can destroy your pc</p><p>\nViruses are malicious programs specifically designed to attach themselves to files or documents and execute when the infected file is opened. As a result, they can harm your system, slow down performance, and even steal sensitive information.</p><p>\nSpyware is a malicious piece of code created to collect information from a system and spy on it without the user's knowledge or consent. This includes passwords, social information, and even bank details. Spyware is commonly found in unauthorized third-party applications.</p><p>\nA Trojan is a malicious piece of code that appears to be legitimate software. However, once mistakenly installed by a user, it operates in the background and gains system access to perform malicious activities. Trojans are often embedded in third-party apps, games, documents, software patches, and even emails.</p><p>\nRansomware is one of the most powerful and dangerous types of malware. It encrypts a target’s data and demands a ransom payment in exchange for decryption. Once a system is infected, recovering the data without paying the ransom is nearly impossible (at least for now).</p><p>\nA keylogger is a malicious program specifically designed to capture a user's keystrokes in real-time. This means anything you type on your keyboard can be recorded, including personal details and sensitive social media credentials.</p><p>To protect yourself from malware, follow these preventive measures:</p><ol><li>Remember, nothing is 100% secure! Always stay cautious.\nChoose a robust antivirus program like Avast, Norton, AVG, or Kaspersky.</li><li>Regularly back up your data to avoid losing important files.</li><li>Avoid installing third-party software whenever possible.</li><li>Scan files before use with VirusTotal if you must use third-party software (not recommended).</li><li>Stay away from cracked software, as it is often infected with malware.</li><li>Never download unauthorized files from the internet, as they may contain hidden threats.</li><li>Use a secure and updated browser, such as Tor, Firefox, Edge, or Opera.</li><li>Keep your operating system updated to protect against vulnerabilities.</li><li>Stay informed and educate others about cyber threats to enhance digital security.</li></ol><p>In this discussion, we explored what malware is and how destructive it can be.

These models, and the companies behind them, exploit human artists, using their work without permission or payment to build commercial AI products that compete with them.”</p><p>Calling on Christie’s to cancel the auction, which starts on 20 February, it adds: “Your support of these models, and the people who use them, rewards and further incentivizes AI companies’ mass theft of human artists’ work.”</p><p>The use of copyrighted work to train AI models – the technology that underpins chatbots and image generation tools such as Stable Diffusion and Midjourney – has become a battleground between creatives and tech companies, with artists, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/jul/10/sarah-silverman-sues-openai-meta-copyright-infringement\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">authors</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2023/dec/27/new-york-times-openai-microsoft-lawsuit\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">publishers</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/article/2024/jun/25/record-labels-sue-ai-song-generator-apps-copyright-infringement-lawsuit\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">music labels</a> launching a series of lawsuits alleging breach of copyright.</p><p>The British composer Ed Newton-Rex, a key figure in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2024/oct/22/thom-yorke-and-julianne-moore-join-thousands-of-creatives-in-ai-warning\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">campaign by creative professionals</a> for protection of their work and a signatory to the letter, said at least nine of the works appearing in the auction appeared to have used models trained on artists’ work. However, other pieces in the auction do not appear to have used such models.</p><p>A spokesperson for Christie’s said that “in most cases” the AI used to create art in the auction had been trained on the artists’ “own inputs”.</p><p>“The artists represented in this sale all have strong, existing multidisciplinary art practices, some recognised in leading museum collections. The works in this auction are using artificial intelligence to enhance their bodies of work and in most cases AI is being employed in a controlled manner, with data trained on the artists’ own inputs,” said the spokesperson.</p><p>A British artist whose work features in the auction, Mat Dryhurst, said he cared about the issue of art and AI “deeply” and rejected the criticisms in the letter. A piece by Dryhurst and his wife, Holly Herndon – based on a work called xhairymutantx – is on sale at the auction with an estimated price of between $70,000 and $90,000.</p><p>“This is of interest to us and we have made a lot of art exploring and attempting to intervene in this process as is well within our rights.”</p><p>He added: “It is not illegal to use any model to create artwork. I resent that an important debate that should be focused on companies and state policy is being focused on artists grappling with the technology of our time.”</p><p>Anadol also rejected the criticism. In a post on X, he said the backlash was a consequence of “lazy critic practices and doomsday hysteria”.</p><p>Anadol told the Guardian the piece being auctioned, ISS Dreams, was created using AI technology that had been trained on publicly available datasets from NASA “that have been used widely by artists for many decades.”</p><p>He added that “the suggestion that this artwork was created using ‘AI models that are known to be on copyrighted work trained without a license’ is factually incorrect.”</p>","contentLength":3744,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/1iq97ti/mass_theft_thousands_of_artists_call_for_ai_art/"},{"title":"Lil guy is trying his best","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/1iq6dyy/lil_guy_is_trying_his_best/","date":1739640466,"author":"/u/MetaKnowing","guid":292,"unread":true,"content":"","contentLength":0,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"[D] Have any LLM papers predicted a token in the middle rather than the next token?","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1iq4f0r/d_have_any_llm_papers_predicted_a_token_in_the/","date":1739635189,"author":"/u/TheWittyScreenName","guid":516,"unread":true,"content":"<p>I’m working on a project (unrelated to NLP) where we use essentially the same architecture and training as GPT-3, but we’re more interested in finding a series of tokens to connect a starting and ending “word” than the next “word”.

Whatever they’ve got, basically. And put it all in one place to be analyzed by algorithms. The American multi-billionaire used the United States as an example, if not a goal.</p><p>\"I have to tell [the] AI model as much about my country as I can,\" Ellison said. \"We need to unify all the national data, put it into a database where it's easily consumable by the AI model, and then ask whatever question you like,\" he said. \"That's the missing link.\"</p><p>He believes the payoff will include better healthcare, thanks to treatments tailored to individuals, and the ability for governments to lift food production by better predicting crop yields.

I am fortunate enough to work and develop with these technologies every day as a machine learning engineer!</p><p>In this article, I will walk you through my journey to becoming a machine learning engineer, shedding some light and advice on how you can become one yourself!</p><p>In one of my previous articles, I extensively wrote about my journey from school to securing my first <a href=\"https://towardsdatascience.com/tag/data-science/\" title=\"Data Science\">Data Science</a> job. I recommend you <a href=\"https://medium.com/towards-data-science/how-i-became-a-data-scientist-no-cs-degree-no-bootcamp-82c321904986\">check out that article</a>, but I will summarise the key timeline here.</p><p>Pretty much everyone in my family studied some sort of STEM subject. My great-grandad was an engineer, both my grandparents studied physics, and my mum is a maths teacher.</p><p><em>So, my path was always paved for me.</em></p><p>I chose to study physics at university after watching The Big Bang Theory at age 12; it’s fair to say everyone was very proud!</p><p>At school, I wasn’t dumb by any means. I was actually relatively bright, but I didn’t fully apply myself. I got decent grades, but definitely not what I was fully capable of.</p><p>I was very arrogant and thought I would do well with zero work.</p><p>I applied to top universities like Oxford and Imperial College, but given my work ethic, I was delusional thinking I had a chance. On results day, I ended up in clearing as I missed my offers. This was probably one of the saddest days of my life.</p><p>Clearing in the UK is where universities offer places to students on certain courses where they have space. It’s mainly for students who don’t have a university offer.</p><p>I was lucky enough to be offered a chance to study physics at the University of Surrey, and I went on to earn a first-class master’s degree in physics!</p><p>There is genuinely no substitute for hard work. It is a cringy cliche, but it is true!</p><p>My original plan was to do a PhD and be a full-time researcher or professor, but during my degree, I did a research year, and I just felt a career in research was not for me. Everything moved so slowly, and it didn’t seem there was much opportunity in the space.</p><p>During this time, DeepMind released their<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXuK6gekU1Y&amp;t=1539s\"></a>documentary on YouTube, which popped up on my home feed.</p><p>From the video, I started to understand how AI worked and learn about neural networks, reinforcement learning, and deep learning. To be honest, to this day I am still not an expert in these areas.</p><p>Naturally, I dug deeper and found that a data scientist uses AI and machine learning algorithms to solve problems. I immediately wanted in and started applying for data science graduate roles.</p><p>I spent countless hours coding, taking courses, and working on projects. I applied to and eventually landed my first data science graduate scheme in September 2021.</p><p><em>You can hear more about my journey from a <a href=\"https://tobeadatascientist.substack.com/p/overcoming-rejection-lessons-from-egor-howell\">podcast</a>.</em></p><p>I started my career in an insurance company, where I built various supervised learning models, mainly using gradient boosted tree packages like CatBoost, XGBoost, and<a href=\"https://medium.com/towards-data-science/breaking-down-generalized-linear-models-d9212526e51d?sk=fda0298cebcb8e9e0c20cb6af8ed4f06\"> generalised linear models (GLMs)</a>.</p><p>I built models to predict:</p><ul><li> — Did someone fraudulently make a claim to profit.</li><li>— What’s the premium we should give someone.</li><li>— How many claims will someone have.</li><li> — What’s the average claim value someone will have.</li></ul><p>I made around six models spanning the regression and classification space. I learned so much here, especially in statistics, as I worked very closely with Actuaries, so my maths knowledge was excellent.</p><p>However, due to the company’s structure and setup, it was difficult for my models to advance past the PoC stage, so I felt I lacked the “tech” side of my toolkit and understanding of how companies use machine learning in production.</p><p>After a year, my previous employer reached out to me asking if I wanted to apply to a junior data scientist role that specialises in<a href=\"https://medium.com/@egorhowell/list/time-series-00bbfb9f5359\"> time series forecasting</a> and<a href=\"https://medium.com/@egorhowell/list/optimisation-algorithms-069bf9c6c8d5\"> optimisation</a> problems. I really liked the company, and after a few interviews, I was offered the job!</p><p>I worked at this company for about 2.5 years, where I became an expert in forecasting and combinatorial optimisation problems.</p><p>I developed many algorithms and deployed my models to production through AWS using software engineering best practices, such as unit testing, lower environment, shadow system, CI/CD pipelines, and much more.</p><p><em>Fair to say I learned a lot.&nbsp;</em></p><p>I worked very closely with software engineers, so I picked up a lot of engineering knowledge and continued self-studying machine learning and statistics on the side.</p><p>Over time, I realised the actual value of data science is using it to make live decisions. There is a good quote by<a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/posts/pau-labarta-bajo-4432074b_machinelearning-mlops-realworldml-activity-7195694289178214400-gZyw\"> Pau Labarta Bajo</a></p><p>ML models inside Jupyter notebooks have a business value of $0</p><p>There is no point in building a really complex and sophisticated model if it will not produce results. Seeking out that extra 0.1% accuracy by staking multiple models is often not worth it.</p><p>You are better off building something simple that you can deploy, and that will bring real financial benefit to the company.</p><p>With this in mind, I started thinking about the future of data science. In my head, there are two avenues:</p><ul><li> -&gt; You work primarily to gain insight into what the business should be doing and what it should be looking into to boost its performance.</li><li> -&gt; You ship solutions (models, decision algorithms, etc.) that bring business value.</li></ul><p>I feel the data scientist who analyses and builds PoC models will become extinct in the next few years because, as we said above, they don’t provide tangible value to a business.</p><p>That’s not to say they are entirely useless; you have to think of it from the business perspective of their return on investment. Ideally, the value you bring in should be more than your salary.</p><p>You want to say that you did “X that produced Y”, which the above two avenues allow you to do.</p><p>The engineering side was the most interesting and enjoyable for me. I genuinely enjoy coding and building stuff that benefits people, and that they can use, so naturally, that’s where I gravitated towards.</p><p>To move to the ML engineering side, I asked my line manager if I could deploy the algorithms and ML models I was building myself. I would get help from software engineers, but I would write all the production code, do my own system design, and set up the deployment process independently.</p><p><em>And that’s exactly what I did.</em></p><p>Coincidentally, my current employer contacted me around this time and asked if I wanted to apply for a machine learning engineer role that specialises in general ML and optimisation at their company!</p><p>Call it luck, but clearly, the universe was telling me something. After several interview rounds, I was offered the role, and I am now a fully fledged machine learning engineer!</p><p>Fortunately, a role kind of “fell to me,” but I created my own luck through up-skilling and documenting my learning. That is why I always tell people to show their work — you don’t know what may come from it.</p><p>I want to share the main bits of advice that helped me transition from a machine learning engineer to a data scientist.</p><ul><li> — A machine learning engineer is  an entry-level position in my opinion. You need to be well-versed in data science, machine learning, software engineering, etc. You don’t need to be an expert in all of them, but have good fundamentals across the board. That’s why I recommend having a couple of years of experience as either a software engineer or data scientist and self-study other areas.</li><li> — If you are from data science, you must learn to write good, well-tested production code. You must know things like typing, linting, unit tests, formatting, mocking and CI/CD. It’s not too difficult, but it just requires some practice. I recommend asking your current company to work with software engineers to gain this knowledge, it worked for me!</li><li> — Most companies nowadays deploy many of their architecture and systems on the cloud, and machine learning models are no exception. So, it’s best to get practice with these tools and understand how they enable models to go live. I learned most of this on the job, to be honest, but there are courses you can take.</li><li> — I am sure most of you know this already, but every tech professional should be proficient in the command line. You will use it extensively when deploying and writing production code. I have a basic guide you can checkout<a href=\"https://medium.com/towards-data-science/an-introduction-to-the-shell-676ee5b899df?sk=0c6e101165b4314b98ab39d11525366c\"> here</a>.</li><li><strong>Data Structures &amp; Algorithms </strong>— Understanding the fundamental algorithms in computer science are very useful for MLE roles. Mainly because you will likely be asked about it in interviews. It’s not too hard to learn compared to machine learning; it just takes time. Any course will do the trick.</li><li> — Again, most tech professionals should know Git, but as an MLE, it is essential. How to squash commits, do code reviews, and write outstanding pull requests are musts.</li><li> — Many MLE roles I saw required you to have some specialisation in a particular area. I specialise in time series forecasting, optimisation, and general ML based on my previous experience. This helps you stand out in the market, and most companies are looking for specialists nowadays.</li></ul><p>The main theme here is that I basically up-skilled my software engineering abilities. This makes sense as I already had all the math, stats, and machine learning knowledge from being a data scientist.</p><p>If I were a software engineer, the transition would likely be the reverse.

Instead of directly listing specific competencies to develop and the motivation behind mastering them, I will briefly outline the most important approaches, presenting them in chronological order as they have been developed and used over the past decades in machine learning.</p><p>The reason is that I believe it is crucial to study these algorithms from the very beginning. In machine learning, many new methods are built upon older approaches, which is especially true for <a href=\"https://towardsdatascience.com/tag/nlp/\" title=\"NLP\">NLP</a> and computer vision.</p><p>For example, jumping directly into the implementation details of modern&nbsp;large language models (LLMs)&nbsp;without any preliminary knowledge may make it very difficult for beginners to grasp the motivation and underlying ideas of specific mechanisms.</p><p><em>Given this, in the next two sections, I will highlight in&nbsp;</em><em>&nbsp;the key concepts that should be studied.</em></p><p><strong>Natural language processing (NLP)</strong>&nbsp;is a broad field that focuses on processing textual information. Machine learning algorithms cannot work directly with raw text, which is why text is usually preprocessed and converted into numerical vectors that are then fed into neural networks.</p><p>Before being converted into vectors, words undergo&nbsp;, which includes simple techniques such as&nbsp;,&nbsp;<strong>stemming, lemmatization, normalization</strong>, or removing&nbsp;. After preprocessing, the resulting text is encoded into&nbsp;. Tokens represent the smallest textual elements in a collection of documents. Generally, a token can be a part of a word, a sequence of symbols, or an individual symbol. Ultimately, tokens are converted into numerical vectors.</p><p>The&nbsp;&nbsp;method is the most basic way to encode tokens, focusing on counting the frequency of tokens in each document. However, in practice, this is usually not sufficient, as it is also necessary to account for token importance — a concept introduced in the&nbsp;&nbsp;and&nbsp;&nbsp;methods. While TF-IDF improves upon the naive counting approach of bag of words, researchers have developed a completely new approach called embeddings.</p><p>&nbsp;are numerical vectors whose components preserve the semantic meanings of words. Because of this, embeddings play a crucial role in NLP, enabling input data to be trained or used for model inference. Additionally, embeddings can be used to compare text similarity, allowing for the retrieval of the most relevant documents from a collection.</p><blockquote><p><em>Embeddings can also be used to encode other unstructured data, including images, audio, and videos.</em></p></blockquote><p>As a field, NLP has been evolving rapidly over the last 10–20 years to efficiently solve various text-related problems. Complex tasks like text translation and text generation were initially addressed using&nbsp;<strong>recurrent neural networks (RNNs)</strong>, which introduced the concept of memory, allowing neural networks to capture and retain key contextual information in long documents.</p><p>Although RNN performance gradually improved, it remained suboptimal for certain tasks. Moreover, RNNs are relatively slow, and their sequential prediction process does not allow for parallelization during training and inference, making them less efficient.</p><p>Additionally, the original Transformer architecture can be decomposed into two separate modules:&nbsp;&nbsp;and&nbsp;. Both of these form the foundation of the most state-of-the-art models used today to solve various NLP problems. Understanding their principles is valuable knowledge that will help learners advance further when studying or working with other&nbsp;<strong>large language models (LLMs)</strong>.</p><p>When it comes to LLMs, I strongly recommend studying the evolution of at least the first three GPT models, as they have had a significant impact on the AI world we know today. In particular, I would like to highlight the concepts of&nbsp;&nbsp;and&nbsp;, introduced in&nbsp;GPT-2, which enable LLMs to solve text generation tasks without explicitly receiving any training examples for them.</p><p>Another important technique developed in recent years is&nbsp;<strong>retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)</strong>.&nbsp;<em>The main limitation of LLMs is that they are only aware of the context used during their training.</em>&nbsp;As a result, they lack knowledge of any information beyond their training data.</p><p>The retriever converts the input prompt into an embedding, which is then used to query a vector database. The database returns the most relevant context based on the similarity to the embedding. This retrieved context is then combined with the original prompt and passed to a generative model. The model processes both the initial prompt and the additional context to generate a more informed and contextually accurate response.</p><blockquote><p><em>A good example of this limitation is the first version of the ChatGPT model, which was trained on data up to the year 2022 and had no knowledge of events that occurred from 2023 onward.</em></p></blockquote><p>To address this limitation, OpenAI researchers developed a RAG pipeline, which includes a constantly updated database containing new information from external sources. When ChatGPT is given a task that requires external knowledge, it queries the database to retrieve the most relevant context and integrates it into the final prompt sent to the machine learning model.</p><p>The goal of distillation is to create a smaller model that can imitate a larger one. In practice, this means that if a large model makes a prediction, the smaller model is expected to produce a similar result.</p><p>In the modern era, LLM development has led to models with millions or even billions of parameters. As a consequence, the overall size of these models may exceed the hardware limitations of standard computers or small portable devices, which come with many constraints.</p><p>Quantization is the process of reducing the memory required to store numerical values representing a model’s weights.</p><p>This is where optimization techniques become particularly useful, allowing LLMs to be compressed without significantly compromising their performance. The most commonly used techniques today include&nbsp;,, and&nbsp;.</p><p>Pruning refers to discarding the least important weights of a model.</p><p>Regardless of the area in which you wish to specialize, knowledge of&nbsp;&nbsp;is a must-have skill! Fine-tuning is a powerful concept that allows you to efficiently adapt a pre-trained model to a new task.</p><p>Fine-tuning is especially useful when working with very large models. For example, imagine you want to use BERT to perform semantic analysis on a specific dataset. While BERT is trained on general data, it might not fully understand the context of your dataset. At the same time, training BERT from scratch for your specific task would require a massive amount of resources.</p><p>Here is where fine-tuning comes in: it involves taking a pre-trained BERT (or another model) and freezing some of its layers (usually those at the beginning). As a result, BERT is retrained, but this time only on the new dataset provided. Since BERT updates only a subset of its weights and the new dataset is likely much smaller than the original one BERT was trained on, fine-tuning becomes a very efficient technique for adapting BERT’s rich knowledge to a specific domain.</p><blockquote><p><em>Fine-tuning is widely used not only in NLP but also across many other domains.</em></p></blockquote><p>As the name suggests,&nbsp;&nbsp;involves analyzing images and videos using machine learning. The most common tasks include image classification, object detection, image segmentation, and generation.</p><p>Most CV algorithms are based on neural networks, so it is essential to understand how they work in detail. In particular, CV uses a special type of network called&nbsp;<strong>convolutional neural networks (CNNs)</strong>. These are similar to fully connected networks, except that they typically begin with a set of specialized mathematical operations called&nbsp;.</p><blockquote><p><em>In simple terms, convolutions act as filters, enabling the model to extract the most important features from an image, which are then passed to fully connected layers for further analysis.</em></p></blockquote><p>The next step is to study the most popular CNN architectures for classification tasks, such as&nbsp;<strong>AlexNet, VGG, Inception, ImageNet</strong>, and&nbsp;.</p><p>Speaking of the object detection task, the&nbsp;&nbsp;algorithm is a clear winner. It is not necessary to study all of the dozens of versions of YOLO. In reality, going through the original paper of the first YOLO should be sufficient to understand how a relatively difficult problem like object detection is elegantly transformed into both classification and regression problems. This approach in YOLO also provides a nice intuition on how more complex CV tasks can be reformulated in simpler terms.</p><p>While there are many architectures for performing image segmentation, I would strongly recommend learning about&nbsp;, which introduces an encoder-decoder architecture.</p><p>Finally, image generation is probably one of the most challenging tasks in CV. Personally, I consider it an optional topic for learners, as it involves many advanced concepts. Nevertheless, gaining a high-level intuition of how&nbsp;<strong>generative adversial networks (GAN)</strong>&nbsp;function to generate images is a good way to broaden one’s horizons.</p><blockquote><p><em>In some problems, the training data might not be enough to build a performant model. In such cases, the data augmentation technique is commonly used. It involves the artificial generation of training data from already existing data (images). By feeding the model more diverse data, it becomes capable of learning and recognizing more patterns.</em></p></blockquote><p>It would be very hard to present in detail the <a href=\"https://towardsdatascience.com/tag/roadmaps/\" title=\"Roadmaps\">Roadmaps</a> for all existing machine learning domains in a single article. That is why, in this section, I would like to briefly list and explain some of the other most popular areas in data science worth exploring.</p><p>First of all,&nbsp;<strong>recommender systems (RecSys)</strong>&nbsp;have gained a lot of popularity in recent years. They are increasingly implemented in online shops, social networks, and streaming services. The key idea of most algorithms is to take a large initial matrix of all users and items and decompose it into a product of several matrices in a way that associates every user and every item with a high-dimensional embedding. This approach is very flexible, as it then allows different types of comparison operations on embeddings to find the most relevant items for a given user. Moreover, it is much more rapid to perform analysis on small matrices rather than the original, which usually tends to have huge dimensions.</p><p> often goes hand in hand with RecSys. When a RecSys has identified a set of the most relevant items for the user, ranking algorithms are used to sort them to determine the order in which they will be shown or proposed to the user. A good example of their usage is search engines, which filter query results from top to bottom on a web page.</p><p>Closely related to ranking, there is also a&nbsp;&nbsp;problem that aims to optimally map objects from two sets, A and B, in a way that, on average, every object pair&nbsp;is mapped “well” according to a matching criterion. A use case example might include distributing a group of students to different university disciplines, where the number of spots in each class is limited.</p><p>&nbsp;is an unsupervised machine learning task whose objective is to split a dataset into several regions (clusters), with each dataset object belonging to one of these clusters. The splitting criteria can vary depending on the task. Clustering is useful because it allows for grouping similar objects together. Moreover, further analysis can be applied to treat objects in each cluster separately.</p><p>The goal of clustering is to group dataset objects (on the left) into several categories (on the right) based on their similarity.</p><p>&nbsp;is another unsupervised problem, where the goal is to compress an input dataset. When the dimensionality of the dataset is large, it takes more time and resources for machine learning algorithms to analyze it. By identifying and removing noisy dataset features or those that do not provide much valuable information, the data analysis process becomes considerably easier.</p><p>&nbsp;is an area that focuses on designing algorithms and data structures (indexes) to optimize searches in a large database of embeddings (vector database). More precisely, given an input embedding and a vector database, the goal is to&nbsp;&nbsp;find the most similar embedding in the database relative to the input embedding.</p><p>The goal of similarity search is to approximately find the most similar embedding in a vector database relative to a query embedding.</p><p>The word “approximately” means that the search is not guaranteed to be 100% precise. Nevertheless, this is the main idea behind similarity search algorithms — sacrificing a bit of accuracy in exchange for significant gains in prediction speed or data compression.</p><p>&nbsp;involves studying the behavior of a target variable over time. This problem can be solved using classical tabular algorithms. However, the presence of time introduces new factors that cannot be captured by standard algorithms. For instance:</p><ul><li>the target variable can have an overall&nbsp;, where in the long term its values increase or decrease&nbsp;<em>(e.g., the average yearly temperature rising due to global warming)</em>.</li><li>the target variable can have a&nbsp;&nbsp;which makes its values change based on the currently given period&nbsp;<em>(e.g. temperature is lower in winter and higher in summer)</em>.</li></ul><p>Most of the time series models take both of these factors into account. In general, time series models are mainly used a lot in financial, stock or demographic analysis.</p><p>Another advanced area I would recommend exploring is&nbsp;, which fundamentally changes the algorithm design compared to classical machine learning.&nbsp;In simple terms, its goal is to train an agent in an environment to make optimal decisions based on a reward system (also known as the&nbsp;<em>“trial and error approach”</em>).&nbsp;By taking an action, the agent receives a reward, which helps it understand whether the chosen action had a positive or negative effect.&nbsp;After that, the agent slightly adjusts its strategy, and the entire cycle repeats.</p><p>Reinforcement learning is particularly popular in complex environments where classical algorithms are not capable of solving a problem.&nbsp;Given the complexity of reinforcement learning algorithms and the computational resources they require, this area is not yet fully mature, but it has high potential to gain even more popularity in the future.</p><p>Currently the most popular applications are:</p><ul><li>.&nbsp;Existing approaches can design optimal game strategies and outperform humans.&nbsp;The most well-known examples are chess and Go.</li><li>.&nbsp;Advanced algorithms can be incorporated into robots to help them move, carry objects or complete routine tasks at home.</li><li>.&nbsp;Reinforcement learning methods can be developed to automatically drive cars, control helicopters or drones.</li></ul><p>This article was a logical continuation of the previous part and expanded the skill set needed to become a data scientist. While most of the mentioned topics require time to master, they can add significant value to your portfolio. This is especially true for the NLP and CV domains, which are in high demand today.</p><blockquote><p>After reaching a high level of expertise in data science, it is still crucial to stay motivated and consistently push yourself to learn new topics and explore emerging algorithms.</p></blockquote><p>Data science is a constantly evolving field, and in the coming years, we might witness the development of new state-of-the-art approaches that we could not have imagined in the past.</p><p><em>All images are by the author unless noted otherwise.</em></p>","contentLength":17044,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Publish Interactive Data Visualizations for Free with Python and Marimo","url":"https://towardsdatascience.com/publish-interactive-data-visualizations-for-free-with-python-and-marimo/","date":1739548800,"author":"Sam Minot","guid":8,"unread":true,"content":"<p>Working in <a href=\"https://towardsdatascience.com/tag/data-science/\" title=\"Data Science\">Data Science</a>, it can be hard to share insights from complex datasets using only static figures. All the facets that describe the shape and meaning of interesting data are not always captured in a handful of pre-generated figures. While we have powerful technologies available for presenting interactive figures — where a viewer can rotate, filter, zoom, and generally explore complex data  —  they always come with tradeoffs.</p><p>Here I present my experience using a recently released Python library — <a href=\"https://marimo.io\">marimo</a> — which opens up exciting new opportunities for publishing interactive visualizations across the entire field of data science.</p><h2>Interactive Data Visualization</h2><p>The tradeoffs to consider when selecting an approach for presenting data visualizations can be broken into three categories:</p><ul><li> — what visualizations and interactivity am I able to present to the user?</li><li> — what are the resources needed for displaying this visualization to users (e.g. running servers, hosting websites)?</li><li> – how much of a new skillset / codebase do I need to learn upfront?</li></ul><p> is the foundation of portable interactivity. Every user has a web browser installed on their computer and there are many different frameworks available for displaying any degree of interactivity or visualization you might imagine (for example, this <a href=\"https://threejs.org/\">gallery of amazing things people have made with three.js</a>). Since the application is running on the user’s computer, no costly servers are needed. However, a significant drawback for the data science community is ease of use, as JS does not have many of the high-level (i.e. easy-to-use) libraries that data scientists use for data manipulation, plotting, and interactivity.</p><p> provides a useful point of comparison. Because of its <a href=\"https://flatironschool.com/blog/python-popularity-the-rise-of-a-global-programming-language/\">continually growing popularity</a>, some have called this the <a href=\"https://towardsdatascience.com/we-are-living-in-the-era-of-python-bc032d595f6a\">“Era of Python”</a>. For data scientists in particular, Python stands alongside R as one of the foundational languages for quickly and effectively wielding complex data. While Python may be easier to use than Javascript, there are fewer options for presenting interactive visualizations. Some popular projects providing interactivity and visualization have been <a href=\"https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/stable/\">Flask</a>, <a href=\"https://dash.plotly.com/\">Dash</a>, and <a href=\"https://streamlit.io/\">Streamlit</a> (also worth mentioning — <a href=\"https://docs.bokeh.org/en/latest/docs/gallery.html\">bokeh</a>, <a href=\"https://holoviews.org/\">HoloViews</a>, <a href=\"https://altair-viz.github.io/altair-tutorial/README.html\">altair</a>, and <a href=\"https://plotly.com/python/\">plotly</a>). The biggest tradeoff for using Python has been the cost for publishing – delivering the tool to users. In the same way that <a href=\"https://www.shinyapps.io/\">shinyapps</a> require a running computer to serve up the visualization, these Python-based frameworks have exclusively been server-based. This is by no means prohibitive for authors with a budget to spend, but it does limit the number of users who can take advantage of a particular project.</p><p><a href=\"https://pyodide.org/en/stable/\"></a> is an intriguing middle ground — Python code running directly in the web browser using <a href=\"https://webassembly.org/\">WebAssembly</a> (WASM). There are resource limitations (only 1 thread and 2GB memory) that make this impractical for doing the heavy lifting of data science. , this can be more than sufficient for building visualizations and updating based on user input. Because it runs in the browser, no servers are required for hosting. Tools that use Pyodide as a foundation are interesting to explore because they give data scientists an opportunity to write Python code which runs directly on users’ computers without their having to install or run anything outside of the web browser.</p><p>As an aside, <a href=\"https://towardsdatascience.com/python-based-data-viz-with-no-installation-required-aaf2358c881\">I’ve been interested previously in</a> one project that has tried this approach: <a href=\"https://github.com/whitphx/stlite\">stlite</a>, <a href=\"https://edit.share.stlite.net/\">an in-browser implementation of Streamlit</a> that lets you deploy these flexible and powerful apps to a broad range of users. However, a core limitation is that Streamlit itself is distinct from stlite (the port of Streamlit to WASM), which means that not all features are supported and that advancement of the project is dependent on two separate groups working along compatible lines.</p><ul><li>The interface resembles a Jupyter , which will be familiar to users.</li><li>Execution of cells is , so that updating one cell will rerun all cells which depend on its output.</li><li> can be captured with a flexible set of UI components.</li><li>Notebooks can be quickly converted into , hiding the code and showing only the input/output elements.</li><li>Apps can be run locally or converted into using WASM/Pyodide.</li></ul><p>marimo balances the tradeoffs of technology in a way that is well suited to the skill set of the typical data scientists:</p><ul><li> — user input and visual display features are rather extensive, <a href=\"https://docs.marimo.io/guides/working_with_data/plotting/#reactive-plots\">supporting user input</a> via Altair and Plotly plots.</li><li> — deploying as static webpages is basically free — no servers required</li><li> — for users familiar with Python notebooks, marimo will feel very familiar and be easy to pick up.</li></ul><h2>Publishing Marimo Apps on the Web</h2><p>As a simple example of the type of display that can be useful in data science, consisting of explanatory text interspersed with interactive displays, I have created a barebones <a href=\"https://github.com/FredHutch/marimo-publication\">GitHub repository</a>. Try it out yourself <a href=\"https://fredhutch.github.io/marimo-publication/\">here</a>.</p><p>Using just a little bit of code, users can:</p><ul><li>Generate visualizations with flexible interactivity</li><li>Write narrative text describing their findings</li><li>Publish to the web for free (i.e. using GitHub Pages)</li></ul><h2>Public App / Private Data</h2><p>This new technology offers an exciting new opportunity for collaboration — publish the app publicly to the world, but users can only see specific datasets that they have permission to access.</p><p>Rather than building a dedicated data backend for every app, user data can be stored in a generic backend which can be securely authenticated and accessed using a Python client library — all contained within the user’s web browser. For example, the user is given an OAuth login link that will authenticate them with the backend and allow the app to temporarily access input data.</p><p>As a proof of concept, I built a simple visualization app which connects to <a href=\"https://cirro.bio\">the Cirro data platform</a>, which is used at my institution to manage scientific data. Full disclosure: I was part of the team that built this platform before it spun out as an independent company. In this manner users can:</p><ul><li>Load the public visualization app — hosted on GitHub Pages</li><li>Connect securely to their private data store</li><li>Load the appropriate dataset for display</li><li>Share a link which will direct authorized collaborators to the same data</li></ul><p>As a data scientist, this approach of publishing free and open-source visualization apps which can be used to interact with private datasets is extremely exciting. Building and publishing a new app can take hours and days instead of weeks and years, letting researchers quickly share their insights with collaborators and then publish them to the wider world.</p>","contentLength":6594,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"5 Tips for Building a Data Science Portfolio","url":"https://www.kdnuggets.com/5-tips-building-data-science-portfolio","date":1739545225,"author":"Nate Rosidi","guid":252,"unread":true,"content":"<article>Not every data science portfolio is worth showcasing.
