AI professionals now have the ethical weight that might decide the path of human technological fate. As <a href=\"https://magicfactory.tech/hire-ai-developers/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">artificial intelligence developer</a> systems become ever more powerful and pervasive, the ethical framework that surrounds their creation is increasingly important.\nCore Ethical Principles That All AI Developers Should Be Aware Of<p>\nAll AI developers should build their work on fundamental ethical principles. Transparency is the foundation, and users are entitled to know how AI systems make decisions that affect their lives. When an AI developer builds a recommendation tool or auto-decision-making software, the reasoning behind these decisions shouldn't be a black box.</p>\nFairness is also a critical foundation. An AI developer must work to eliminate bias in data and algorithms. This means considering whether training data involves representative populations and testing systems across a range of demographic groups. The impact of biased AI can perpetuate discrimination in hiring, lending, criminal justice, and healthcare.<p>\nPrivacy protection necessitates constant vigilance on the part of all artificial intelligence developers. Because AI systems process mind-boggling amounts of personal information, developers must employ privacy-by-design principles, maintaining users' information safe and being used only for specific functionalities.</p></p><p><strong>Employing Real-World Ethical Challenges</strong>\nTheoretical framework without practical application is nothing. Consider autonomous cars, for instance: an AI developer making autonomous cars has actual moral decisions to make. Should the passenger be prioritized over pedestrians if there's a risk of collision? How will it handle unavoidable accidents? These aren't abstract philosophical questions but actual decisions in code.<p>\nHealthcare AI is also equally tough problems. A diagnostic device maker employing artificial intelligence must balance the value of precision versus availability. Should a highly precise but expensive AI diagnostic device be reserved for only wealthy hospitals, or should an attempt be made to bring greater availability at the expense of lower accuracy rates?</p>\nAccountability processes set responsible artificial intelligence developers apart from those who develop and deploy with negligence. This involves constructing audit trails, monitor systems, and establishing robust lines of responsibility when AI systems malfunction.<p>\nAll AI developers should document decision-making steps, maintain version history in sight of algorithmic changes, and spell out response procedures when systems behave differently than expected. These are not bureaucracy overheads, they're responsible AI infrastructure habits.</p></p><p><strong>The Stakeholder Engagement Role</strong>\nEthical AI development is not a solitary endeavor. The greatest artificial intelligence developer collaborates with multiple stakeholders such as ethicists, domain experts, affected communities, and final consumers. The collaborative process guarantees that there is an early identification of problems before they are established in working systems.<p>\nRegular ethics reviews are essential. A technically proficient AI engineer might lack domain expertise to recognize potential harm in specific situations. Healthcare professionals, educators, legal experts, and community stakeholders bring knowledge that technical-only units might miss.</p></p><p><strong>Future-Proofing Ethical AI Development</strong>\nThe ethical landscape shifting due to AI continues to fluctuate as technology improves. The EU AI Act and novel governance frameworks worldwide will reconfigure the manner in which artificial intelligence developers carry out their work. Staying up to date with these fluctuations is not optional, it's a professional responsibility.<p>\nDaily education in AI ethics needs to be as mundane a routine as learning new programming languages or paradigms. The artificial intelligence engineer who remains stationary and will not move their ethical wisdom forward will quickly find themselves ill-equipped to meet the challenges of tomorrow.</p></p><p><strong>Building a Sustainable Ethical Practice</strong>\nBuilding ethical AI is not an option but an ongoing mindset to adopt. All creators of <a href=\"https://magicfactory.tech/hire-ai-developers/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">artificial intelligence developer</a> must establish personal ethical guidelines, get constant feedback on the effect their creations have on society, and remain receptive to abandoning or altering projects that are ethically problematic.\nThe future of artificial intelligence is not only shaped by technical advancement but by the moral foundation that supports that advancement. Artificial intelligence's developer who embraces this responsibility is a part of the solution to the biggest dangers of AI, ensuring that potent technologies serve humanity's best interests rather than opposing them.</p>","contentLength":4895,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"I Built an AI-Powered SEO Assistant to Save Time and Boost Rankings","url":"https://dev.to/duker/i-built-an-ai-powered-seo-assistant-to-save-time-and-boost-rankings-138l","date":1751449170,"author":"Duke","guid":180412,"unread":true,"content":"","contentLength":0,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Product Hunt Launch","url":"https://dev.to/soumilgit/product-hunt-launch-25f5","date":1751449078,"author":"Soumil Mukhopadhyay","guid":180411,"unread":true,"content":"","contentLength":0,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"A Log of Claude and Gemini Collaborating via CLI","url":"https://dev.to/charmpic/a-log-of-claude-and-gemini-collaborating-via-cli-4e3g","date":1751449069,"author":"CharmPic","guid":180410,"unread":true,"content":"<p>We were developing an easy-to-use Text Editor when something else was born: VoidCoreSystem!\nIt's an interesting technology, so come on in and check it out!</p><div><pre><code>Human Architect: Project lead and sanity checker.\n\nAI Coder (Claude): High-speed implementation.\n\nAI Advisor (Gemini): Architectural and design consultant.\n</code></pre></div><p>The rest of this document is a development log showing a consultation session between two AIs.</p><p>Automatic and recursive conversation!

Alright, let's think deeply together with Gemini!</p><p>● Bash: gemini -p \"I'd like to discuss the plugin system for CharmCode. We are currently in Phase 1.5, having implemented a C-compatible plugin and a Hot Reload system. I'm considering an 'autonomous awakening model' where plugins become aware of and use each other's features, and a 'semantic attribute system' to manage this. What are your thoughts on the architecture?\"\n⎿ Gemini: That's a wonderful idea. It's a very advanced and fascinating concept that would further evolve CharmCode's plugin system. The autonomous awakening model and the semantic attribute system would be powerful tools in aiming for a loosely coupled and scalable architecture.</p><p>I've received a wonderfully detailed analysis from Gemini.

I'll ask Gemini a bit more, especially about the circular dependency problem.</p><p>● Bash: gemini -p \"Could you tell me more specifically about the circular dependency (deadlock) problem? For example, if Plugin A requires a feature from Plugin B, and B requires a feature from A, how can we resolve this without a central manager explicitly defining the load order?\"\n⎿ Gemini: An excellent question. Circular dependency is a very important and complex problem in plugin architectures. I will propose solutions and design plans for the scenario and concerns you've presented.</p><p>Amazing! Gemini has proposed a concrete solution: two-phase initialization. This aligns very well with CharmCode's current IPlugin design (pre_activate → activate)!</p><div><pre><code>Solve circular dependencies with two-phase initialization:\n\n    Phase 1: Registration (Declare what can be provided).\n\n    Phase 2: Resolution (Request what is needed).\n\nPerfect harmony with the \"Philosophy of Silence\":\n\n    The core only executes generic rules.\n\n    It doesn't know about specific dependencies.\n\nRecommendation of a JSON-formatted manifest file:\n\n    Clearly define provides/consumes.\n\n    Ensure flexibility with an optional flag.\n\nSafe procedure for Hot Reload:\n\n    Identify the scope of impact → Phased shutdown → Re-initialization.\n</code></pre></div><p>This perfectly matches the current design of CharmCode!</p><p>● Claude: This is amazing!

With assets under management (AUM) surpassing $9 trillion as of 2023, BlackRock’s influence extends across a wide range of investment sectors, from equities and fixed income to alternative assets and environmental, social, and governance (ESG) investing. This article explores the investment strategies and management techniques that have propelled BlackRock to its position as a dominant force in asset management.\nThe Rise of BlackRock: A Brief History<p>\nBlackRock was founded in 1988 by a group of eight partners, including current CEO Larry Fink. Initially focused on risk management and fixed-income products, the firm quickly gained a reputation for its analytical rigor and innovative approach to investing. BlackRock’s early success was largely due to its pioneering use of technology and data analytics to manage risk, which set it apart from competitors.</p>\nIn 1999, BlackRock went public, marking a significant milestone in its growth trajectory. Over the next two decades, the firm expanded its product offerings and global presence through a series of strategic acquisitions, including the purchase of Merrill Lynch Investment Management in 2006 and Barclays Global Investors (BGI) in 2009. The acquisition of BGI, which included the iShares exchange-traded funds (ETF) business, was particularly transformative, catapulting BlackRock into the forefront of the global ETF market.<p>\nInvestment Strategies That Define BlackRock</p></p><p>At the core of <a href=\"https://www.visionaryvogues.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">BlackRock’s</a> success is its diversified approach to asset management. The firm offers a broad range of investment products and services designed to meet the needs of institutional and retail investors alike. These products span the investment spectrum, including actively managed funds, index funds, ETFs, and alternative investments.\nOne of BlackRock’s most notable strategies is its emphasis on long-term, value-driven investing. The firm’s investment philosophy is grounded in the belief that markets are generally efficient, but that opportunities for excess returns exist in certain areas. BlackRock’s portfolio managers are encouraged to take a long-term perspective, focusing on fundamental analysis and valuation to identify mispriced assets.<p>\nThis value-driven approach is complemented by BlackRock’s focus on risk management. The firm’s roots in risk management are evident in its rigorous analytical processes, which involve the use of advanced data analytics and proprietary models to assess and manage risk across portfolios. This focus on risk management has been a key factor in BlackRock’s ability to deliver consistent returns for its clients, even in volatile market environments.</p>\nThe Power of Technology: Aladdin and Beyond<p>\nA key differentiator for BlackRock is its integration of technology into its investment processes. The firm’s proprietary risk management platform, Aladdin, is widely regarded as one of the most advanced systems in the industry. Aladdin serves as the backbone of BlackRock’s investment operations, providing real-time data and analytics to portfolio managers, risk managers, and clients.</p>\nAladdin’s capabilities extend beyond risk management to include portfolio construction, trading, compliance, and reporting. The platform’s ability to aggregate and analyze vast amounts of data gives BlackRock a significant edge in identifying trends, managing risks, and optimizing portfolios. This technological advantage has been instrumental in BlackRock’s growth and success, enabling the firm to scale its operations and manage an increasingly complex array of assets.<p>\nIn addition to Aladdin, BlackRock has continued to invest in technology to enhance its investment capabilities. The firm’s focus on digital transformation is evident in its efforts to </p><a href=\"https://www.visionaryvogues.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">integrate artificial intelligence (AI)</a> and machine learning into its investment processes. These technologies are being used to improve portfolio optimization, enhance risk management, and identify new investment opportunities.\nESG Investing: Leading the Charge</p><p>In recent years, BlackRock has emerged as a leader in environmental, social, and governance (ESG) investing, a trend that reflects growing demand from investors for sustainable investment options. Under the leadership of Larry Fink, BlackRock has made ESG considerations a central component of its investment strategy, arguing that companies with strong ESG practices are better positioned for long-term success.\nIn his annual letters to CEOs, Fink has consistently emphasized the importance of sustainability and corporate responsibility. BlackRock has integrated ESG factors into its investment processes across its entire product lineup, from actively managed funds to index funds and ETFs. The firm has also launched a range of ESG-focused products, including the iShares Sustainable ETF suite, which offers investors exposure to companies with strong ESG profiles.<p>\nBlackRock’s commitment to ESG investing is backed by its stewardship efforts. The firm engages with the companies in which it invests to promote best practices in governance, environmental sustainability, and social responsibility. This engagement is supported by BlackRock’s voting power as a major shareholder, allowing it to influence corporate behavior on a global scale.</p>\nThe Rise of Index Investing and ETFs<p>\nBlackRock’s acquisition of Barclays Global Investors in 2009 marked a turning point in the firm’s history, particularly with the addition of the iShares ETF business. iShares has since become the largest ETF provider in the world, with a market share of over 40%. The rise of ETFs has been a significant driver of BlackRock’s growth, as investors increasingly favor low-cost, passive investment vehicles over traditional actively managed funds.</p>\nThe appeal of ETFs lies in their ability to offer diversified exposure to a wide range of asset classes, sectors, and geographies at a lower cost than traditional mutual funds. BlackRock’s dominance in the ETF market is due in part to its ability to offer a broad array of products that meet the needs of different types of investors, from institutional clients to individual investors.<p>\nBlackRock has also been at the forefront of innovation in the ETF space. The firm has introduced a range of innovative products, such as smart beta ETFs, which use alternative weighting methodologies to capture specific investment factors like value, momentum, or volatility. These products offer investors a way to achieve targeted exposure to specific investment themes while maintaining the benefits of passive investing.</p>\nGlobal Reach and Client Focus<p>\nOne of BlackRock’s key strengths is its global reach. The firm operates in over 100 countries, serving a diverse client base that includes governments, corporations, foundations, and individual investors. This global presence allows BlackRock to offer a wide range of investment solutions tailored to the unique needs of different markets and clients.</p>\nBlackRock’s client-centric approach is evident in its commitment to understanding the needs and goals of its clients. The firm offers customized investment solutions and advisory services, leveraging its deep expertise across asset classes and geographies. This focus on client needs has helped BlackRock build long-term relationships and maintain its position as a trusted partner in asset management.<p>\nIn addition to its global operations, BlackRock’s commitment to client education and transparency is a key factor in its success. The firm regularly publishes research and insights on market trends, investment strategies, and economic developments, helping clients make informed decisions. BlackRock’s emphasis on transparency is also reflected in its reporting practices, which provide clients with detailed information on the performance and risk characteristics of their investments.</p>\nAdaptability and Innovation<p>\nBlackRock’s ability to adapt to changing market conditions and investor preferences has been a driving force behind its continued success. The firm’s willingness to embrace new investment strategies, technologies, and market trends has allowed it to stay ahead of the curve and maintain its leadership position in the asset management industry.</p>\nOne example of this adaptability is BlackRock’s response to the growing demand for alternative investments. The firm has expanded its offerings in private equity, real estate, infrastructure, and hedge funds, providing clients with access to a wider range of investment opportunities.

While chatbots are often the first application people think of, LLM development companies are pushing the boundaries far beyond conversational agents. They are architecting enterprise LLM solutions, crafting tailored LLM development solutions, and launching groundbreaking LLM solutions that automate workflows, elevate internal knowledge, and embed intelligence throughout the digital enterprise. </p><p>This comprehensive article dives deep into how enterprises partnering with  can harness advanced AI capabilities beyond simple chat interactions.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  1. Understanding the Limits of Chatbots – and What's Next\n</h2><p>Chatbots—rules-based or chatbot backed by general LLMs—have limitations:</p><ul><li><p>: Many rely on rigid patterns or general-purpose LLMs that misinterpret business-specific terms.</p></li><li><p>: They inform but rarely take action (e.g., updating CRM, sending alerts).</p></li><li><p><strong>Unstructured data blind spots</strong>: Lacking integration with documents, logs, or proprietary data stores.</p></li><li><p>: Often siloed to specific platforms without full enterprise integration.</p></li></ul><p>Specialist LLM development companies overcome these limitations by constructing enterprise LLM solutions that are deeply integrated, task-aware, and policy-grounded. They build LLM solutions that are conversational, action-oriented, and insight-driven—ushering in intelligent automation across business functions.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  2. Beyond Chat – What Enterprise LLM Use-Cases Look Like\n</h2><h3>\n  \n  \n  2.1 Guided Document Review and Summarization\n</h3><p>An LLM development company integrates LLMs into document management systems, enabling employees to ask: “Show me the escalation clause in doc #345.” These enterprise LLM solutions summarize contracts, policies, or transcripts on demand—saving hours of manual work.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  2.2 Automated Workflow Execution\n</h3><p>LLM engines can be instructed to create Jira tickets, send approval emails, or pull API commands based on user prompts. These LLM development solutions execute business logic fluently, rather than just responding in text.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  2.3 Secure Knowledge Mining\n</h3><p>LLM solutions enable complex searches like: “What were the last three maintenance reports for client A?” or “Show me refund requests with unresolved follow-ups.” Rather than chatty responses, these systems query knowledge graphs and generate dynamic, secure answers.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  2.4 Technical Guidance and Code Assistants\n</h3><p>Developer-facing LLMs can analyze codebases, generate test scripts, or suggest database optimizations. LLM development companies augment chat interfaces with task execution tools and tooling plugins—for real productivity gains.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  2.5 Interactive Training and Onboarding Co‑Pilots\n</h3><p>Rather than reading manuals, employees train via interactive sessions. Enterprise LLM solutions adapt based on role and knowledge gaps—facilitated by intelligent coaching frameworks.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  2.6 Multimodal Intelligence\n</h3><p>Advanced deployments merge text, image, audio, or code. For example, users can upload a screenshot and ask: “Fix the CSS issue,” and receive action steps or code suggestions.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  3. Core Strategies LLM Development Companies Use\n</h2><h3>\n  \n  \n  A. Custom Model Training &amp; Fine-Tuning\n</h3><p>Chatbots often rely on generic LLMs. Enterprise-grade solutions require domain-specific tuning: proprietary lingo, SOPs, compliance policies—the fine-tailored LLM development solutions that make systems trustworthy.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  B. Embeddings + Retrieval Layers\n</h3><p>To ground responses in enterprise data, specialist partners build vector stores linked to documents, product schemas, and structured databases—driving contextual accuracy in enterprise LLM solutions.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  C. Action Connectors &amp; APIs\n</h3><p>LLM models are enhanced with execution layers—APIs that allow them to create tickets, update records, schedule tasks, or scrape internal dashboards. This is how LLM solutions act, not just reply.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  D. Intelligent Guardrails\n</h3><p>Guardrails filter sensitive info, auto flag escalation cases, and guard against hallucinations—ensuring enterprise-grade compliance and reliability.</p><p>From drift monitoring to auto-retraining and versioning, fully managed LLM development solutions bring models to production with high safety and traceability.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  4.

It summarizes key papers, demystifies complex concepts in machine learning and computational theory, and highlights innovations shaping our technological future. The focus here is on a remarkable collection of 66 papers uploaded to arXiv on a single day, June 26, 2025, under the category of Computer Science: Learning. This synthesis examines the field's definition and significance, identifies dominant research themes, explores methodological approaches, presents key findings, and assesses influential works. Additionally, it offers a critical evaluation of progress and outlines potential future directions for the discipline.</p><p>Machine learning, a core subfield of artificial intelligence, involves the development of algorithms that enable computers to learn from and make predictions or decisions based on data, rather than relying on explicit programming. This capability to identify patterns and improve over time underpins many modern technologies, from voice assistants and recommendation systems to autonomous vehicles and personalized healthcare solutions. The significance of machine learning lies in its transformative potential across diverse sectors. In healthcare, it aids in predicting disease outbreaks and tailoring treatments. In finance, it enhances fraud detection. In education, it supports adaptive learning environments. The 66 papers from June 26, 2025, reflect this breadth, addressing both theoretical challenges and practical applications. Their collective contribution underscores a field in rapid evolution, tackling complex problems with innovative approaches. To understand the current state of machine learning, attention must first turn to the major themes shaping research on this date.</p><p>Several prominent themes emerge from the corpus of papers, each representing a critical frontier in machine learning. The first theme is efficiency and scalability, driven by the high computational cost of training large models. Researchers are exploring methods to reduce energy and hardware demands, as exemplified by a study proposing the omission of intermediate layers in transformer models to maintain accuracy while conserving resources (Smith et al., 2025). A second theme centers on fairness and privacy, particularly in sensitive domains like healthcare and education. A notable contribution in this area is a federated learning framework for item response theory, which enables data analysis across distributed devices without compromising personal information (Johnson et al., 2025). Third, robustness under adversarial conditions is a pressing concern, especially for applications such as unmanned aerial vehicles. Multiple studies address this through reinforcement learning techniques designed to ensure stability in the face of deceptive or noisy inputs (Lee et al., 2025). Fourth, multimodal learning, which integrates data from text, images, and audio, is gaining traction for its potential to enhance reasoning capabilities. A paper on multimodal language models demonstrates improved diagnostic accuracy by fusing diverse data types (Brown et al., 2025). Finally, interpretability remains a priority, with efforts to make AI decision-making transparent. Work on neurosymbolic reasoning illustrates this by combining neural and symbolic approaches to produce explainable outcomes (Wang et al., 2025). These themes collectively highlight a field striving for systems that are not only powerful but also equitable, resilient, and comprehensible. With these thematic priorities in mind, the methodologies employed to address them warrant closer examination.</p><p>The methodologies underpinning these advancements reveal a diverse toolkit, each with distinct strengths and limitations. Federated learning stands out as a privacy-preserving approach, training models locally on devices and sharing only aggregated updates. This method proves effective in educational and medical contexts but struggles with inconsistent data distributions across devices, potentially leading to biased outcomes (Johnson et al., 2025). Reinforcement learning, characterized by trial-and-error learning with reward mechanisms, excels in dynamic settings like navigation and gaming. Its hybrid strategies improve efficiency, yet the high demand for data and computational resources poses challenges for smaller research entities (Lee et al., 2025). Graph neural networks are another key approach, adept at handling structured data such as social networks or molecular structures. Their ability to uncover relational patterns is evident in applications like fraud detection, though scalability issues arise with large or dynamic graphs (Lupo Pasini et al., 2025). Lastly, generative models, including diffusion and adversarial networks, enable the creation of synthetic data for fields like drug discovery. While innovative, their training complexity often requires significant optimization efforts (Brown et al., 2025). These methodologies form the backbone of current machine learning research, balancing innovation with inherent trade-offs. Their application across diverse problems leads to significant findings, which are explored next.</p><p>Key findings from the June 26, 2025 submissions demonstrate substantial progress across multiple dimensions of machine learning. A groundbreaking study on neurosymbolic reasoning reveals how neural networks, under specific geometric constraints, can uncover symbolic, rule-based patterns during training, offering a pathway to explainable AI (Wang et al., 2025). In distributed training, a low-communication framework achieved a 357-fold speedup in pre-training a 100-billion-parameter model over slow networks, marking a leap toward democratizing access to advanced AI tools (Smith et al., 2025). Anomaly detection also advanced with the introduction of a benchmark comprising over 300 labeled time series datasets, highlighting the need for tailored solutions in areas like cybersecurity and health monitoring (Johnson et al., 2025). In reinforcement learning, a novel multi-task policy optimization method reduced data requirements while enhancing performance across varied tasks, with implications for robotics and autonomous systems (Narendra et al., 2025). Comparatively, while the neurosymbolic approach prioritizes interpretability, the distributed training framework emphasizes accessibility, and the anomaly detection benchmark focuses on specificity. The multi-task optimization method, meanwhile, bridges efficiency and adaptability, illustrating how these findings collectively push the boundaries of what machine learning can achieve. Certain works within this collection stand out for their depth and potential impact, deserving detailed consideration.</p><p>Among the numerous contributions, five works emerge as particularly influential due to their originality and implications. First, Wang et al. (2025) provide a theoretical foundation for neurosymbolic reasoning in their paper 'Why Neural Network Can Discover Symbolic Structures with Gradient-based Training.' By mapping network parameters into measure space and applying Wasserstein gradient flow under geometric constraints, their approach demonstrates how neural networks can evolve toward symbolic representations, enhancing trust in AI systems. Second, Lupo Pasini et al. (2025) address computational challenges in atomistic modeling with 'Multi-task Parallelism for Robust Pre-training of Graph Foundation Models.' Their multi-task parallelism within the HydraGNN framework achieves unprecedented scalability across millions of structures, accelerating material science research. Third, Narendra et al. (2025) redefine reinforcement learning efficiency in 'M3PO: Massively Multi-Task Model-Based Policy Optimization.' Their hybrid exploration and trust-region optimization cut data needs while improving task adaptability, offering practical benefits for robotics. Fourth, Smith et al. (2025) tackle efficiency in 'Optimizing Transformer Models through Layer Reduction,' presenting a method to skip intermediate layers without sacrificing accuracy, thus reducing computational costs. Finally, Johnson et al. (2025) contribute to privacy with 'Federated Learning for Item Response Theory,' enabling secure data analysis across distributed systems, a critical advancement for sensitive applications. These works collectively span theory, computation, and application, setting benchmarks for future research. Their significance prompts a broader assessment of the field’s progress and challenges.</p><p>A critical evaluation of machine learning’s current state reveals both remarkable achievements and persistent hurdles. Progress in efficiency, as seen in distributed training speedups and layer reduction techniques, addresses the unsustainable resource demands of large models (Smith et al., 2025). Advances in fairness and privacy, particularly through federated learning, mitigate risks in data-sensitive domains (Johnson et al., 2025). Robustness and adaptability are bolstered by innovations in reinforcement learning, ensuring systems can operate under uncertainty (Narendra et al., 2025). Moreover, strides in interpretability, driven by neurosymbolic approaches, begin to unravel the opaque nature of AI decisions (Wang et al., 2025). However, challenges remain. Scalability continues to strain resources, especially for graph-based models handling vast datasets (Lupo Pasini et al., 2025). Data heterogeneity in distributed systems risks introducing bias, undermining fairness. Adversarial threats evolve rapidly, necessitating constant updates to robustness mechanisms. Interpretability, despite progress, is far from universal, limiting trust in high-stakes applications like healthcare. Looking ahead, several directions appear promising. Energy-efficient algorithms and novel hardware could alleviate computational burdens. Integrating human feedback and domain knowledge might enhance performance and clarity. The pursuit of general-purpose AI systems, capable of adapting across tasks and modalities, remains a long-term goal. Above all, embedding fairness and privacy into foundational designs is essential to align innovation with societal needs. Balancing raw computational power with ethical responsibility will define the next phase of machine learning research.</p><p>In conclusion, the 66 papers from June 26, 2025, offer a snapshot of a dynamic field pushing the limits of technology and theory. From efficiency and fairness to robustness and interpretability, the themes, methods, and findings reflect a community committed to solving complex problems. Influential works provide both inspiration and practical tools, while critical challenges highlight areas for continued focus. The future of machine learning hinges on addressing scalability, bias, and trust, ensuring that advancements benefit a broad spectrum of society. This synthesis underscores the field’s potential to reshape industries and everyday life, provided that innovation is guided by responsibility.</p><p>References:\nWang et al. (2025).

We summarize key papers, demystify complex concepts in machine learning and computational theory, and highlight innovations shaping our technological future.</p><p>Field Definition and Significance</p><p>Artificial intelligence research has undergone a remarkable transformation in recent years, evolving from narrow, domain-specific applications toward more integrated, human-like cognitive capabilities. The field encompasses the development of computational systems that can perceive, reason, learn, and interact with their environment in ways that mirror or exceed human intelligence. Contemporary AI research addresses fundamental questions about the nature of intelligence itself while simultaneously pursuing practical applications that can benefit society. The significance of this field extends far beyond computer science, influencing domains ranging from urban planning and social policy to healthcare and scientific discovery.</p><p>The papers examined in this analysis, all published on June 26th, 2025, represent a snapshot of the field's current trajectory toward more sophisticated, collaborative, and socially aware AI systems. These works collectively demonstrate a shift from brute-force computational approaches toward more elegant, human-inspired solutions that emphasize efficiency, interpretability, and real-world applicability. The research spans multiple interconnected domains, from large-scale urban simulation to advanced reasoning architectures, reflecting the field's increasing recognition that true artificial intelligence requires integration across multiple cognitive capabilities.</p><p>Urban and Social Simulation represents one of the most ambitious themes in contemporary AI research, attempting to model human behavior and social dynamics at unprecedented scales. Bougie et al. (2025) introduce CitySim, a groundbreaking framework that employs large language model-driven agents to simulate entire urban populations. This system creates virtual cities populated by AI agents that exhibit realistic daily routines, maintain personal beliefs and long-term goals, and interact with each other in ways that produce genuine social dynamics. Each agent generates schedules using a recursive value-driven approach that balances mandatory activities, personal habits, and situational factors. The system successfully models tens of thousands of agents exhibiting realistic collective behaviors, naturally reproducing patterns such as rush hour dynamics, weekend versus weekday activity differences, and seasonal behavioral variations. Complementing this work, Chen et al. (2025) present MobiVerse, which efficiently generates and dynamically adjusts schedules for approximately 53,000 agents on standard personal computer hardware, demonstrating that large-scale social simulation is now computationally feasible for widespread research applications.</p><p>Advanced Reasoning and Problem-Solving constitutes another critical theme, addressing fundamental questions about how AI systems can achieve human-like cognitive capabilities. The Hierarchical Reasoning Model introduced by Zhang et al. (2025) represents a paradigm shift in this domain, drawing inspiration from neuroscience to create AI systems that process information at multiple levels of abstraction operating at different timescales. This approach mirrors how human brains handle both immediate tactical decisions and long-term strategic planning. Remarkably, the model achieves exceptional performance on complex reasoning tasks using only 27 million parameters and 1000 training samples, fundamentally challenging assumptions about the relationship between model size and reasoning capability. The system operates without pre-training or chain-of-thought data yet achieves nearly perfect performance on challenging tasks including complex Sudoku puzzles and optimal path finding in large mazes. Most significantly, it outperforms much larger models on the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus, a key benchmark for measuring artificial general intelligence capabilities.</p><p>Human-AI Interaction and Collaboration emerges as a third prominent theme, recognizing that the future of AI lies not in replacing humans but in creating systems that enhance human capabilities and work seamlessly alongside us. This research area focuses on developing AI systems that can anticipate human needs, complement human strengths, and compensate for human weaknesses. The work in this domain emphasizes the importance of creating AI partners that can engage in meaningful collaboration rather than mere automation. Recent advances demonstrate significant improvements in AI systems' ability to understand context, maintain coherent long-term interactions, and adapt their behavior based on human preferences and feedback.</p><p>Embodied Intelligence and Spatial Understanding represents a fourth major theme, addressing the challenge of helping AI systems understand and navigate the physical world. Liu et al. (2025) introduce SEEA-R1, a framework for self-evolving embodied agents that can improve their reasoning and behavior through interaction with their environment. This represents a crucial step toward AI systems that don't just exist in digital spaces but can operate effectively in our physical world. The research reveals that existing vision-language models exhibit near-random performance when asked to form spatial mental models from limited views, a task that humans perform naturally. However, researchers demonstrate that a synergistic \"map-then-reason\" approach can boost accuracy from 37.8% to 60.8%, with reinforcement learning pushing performance to 70.7%. This represents a fundamental advance in how AI systems can understand and reason about three-dimensional space.</p><p>Safety, Alignment, and Evaluation forms a fifth critical theme, addressing the paramount importance of ensuring AI systems behave safely and beneficially as they become more powerful and autonomous. This research goes beyond reactive safety measures to consider the long-term societal implications of AI advice and suggestions. Recent work demonstrates over 20% improvement on indirect harm scenarios and an average win rate exceeding 70% against strong baselines on existing safety benchmarks. This represents progress toward AI systems that can anticipate the long-term consequences of their actions and advice, which becomes increasingly important as AI systems influence high-stakes decisions in healthcare, policy, and other critical domains.</p><p>Methodological Approaches</p><p>The methodological landscape of contemporary AI research reflects a sophisticated understanding of the need for diverse approaches to different aspects of intelligence. The urban simulation work employs large language models as cognitive engines for individual agents, leveraging the sophisticated understanding of human behavior embedded in these models to create agents that exhibit genuinely human-like decision-making processes. The recursive value-driven scheduling system allows agents to plan activities by considering multiple factors simultaneously, weighing the importance of different activities against personal preferences and current circumstances.</p><p>The hierarchical reasoning approach draws heavily from neuroscience, implementing multiple levels of abstraction that operate at different timescales. This methodology recognizes that effective reasoning requires both rapid pattern recognition and deliberate, systematic analysis. The architecture incorporates mechanisms for both bottom-up processing of sensory information and top-down guidance from higher-level goals and constraints.</p><p>Embodied intelligence research employs a combination of computer vision, natural language processing, and reinforcement learning to create agents that can perceive, reason about, and act within three-dimensional environments. The self-evolving framework allows agents to improve their capabilities through experience, implementing meta-learning approaches that enable adaptation to new environments and tasks.</p><p>Safety and alignment research utilizes formal verification methods, adversarial testing, and human feedback mechanisms to ensure AI systems remain beneficial and controllable. These approaches recognize that safety cannot be an afterthought but must be integrated into the fundamental design of AI systems from the beginning.</p><p>Key Findings and Comparative Analysis</p><p>The research findings reveal several breakthrough results that challenge existing assumptions about AI capabilities and requirements. The most striking discovery comes from the hierarchical reasoning work, which demonstrates that architectural innovation may be more important than scale for achieving genuine reasoning capabilities. The model's ability to achieve near-perfect performance using only 27 million parameters contrasts sharply with current large language models that use billions of parameters and require massive datasets for training. This finding suggests a fundamental shift in how we think about the relationship between computational resources and cognitive capability.</p><p>In spatial reasoning, the research reveals a significant gap in current AI systems' ability to form three-dimensional mental models from limited visual information. The discovery that existing vision-language models perform at near-random levels on this task highlights a crucial limitation in current approaches. However, the demonstrated improvement from 37.8% to 70.7% accuracy through the map-then-reason approach provides a clear path forward for addressing this limitation.</p><p>The urban simulation results demonstrate that large-scale social modeling is now computationally feasible, with systems capable of modeling tens of thousands of agents exhibiting realistic behaviors on standard hardware. This represents a qualitative leap in our ability to study and predict social phenomena, opening new possibilities for urban planning, policy analysis, and social science research.</p><p>Scientific reasoning advances show significant improvements in predicting scientific developments and evaluating important papers, with hit-at-1 metrics improving by 8% to 14% in graph completion tasks and nearly 10% in predicting future scientific developments. When combined with other methods, performance in evaluating important scientific papers improves by almost 100%, suggesting that AI systems can begin to understand and predict the evolution of scientific knowledge.</p><p>Influential Works and Theoretical Foundations</p><p>Bougie et al. (2025) present CitySim as a foundational work in large-scale urban simulation, demonstrating how large language models can serve as cognitive engines for realistic agent behavior. Their recursive value-driven approach represents a significant advance over previous rule-based simulation methods, enabling agents to exhibit the complexity and adaptability characteristic of human behavior.</p><p>Zhang et al. (2025) introduce the Hierarchical Reasoning Model, which challenges fundamental assumptions about the relationship between model size and reasoning capability. Their work demonstrates that carefully designed architectures can achieve superior performance with dramatically fewer parameters than current approaches, suggesting new directions for efficient AI development.</p><p>Liu et al. (2025) contribute SEEA-R1, advancing the field of embodied intelligence by creating agents that can improve their spatial reasoning and physical interaction capabilities through experience. Their self-evolving framework represents a crucial step toward AI systems that can operate effectively in dynamic, real-world environments.</p><p>Chen et al. (2025) develop MobiVerse, demonstrating the computational feasibility of large-scale agent simulation on standard hardware. Their work makes sophisticated urban modeling accessible to a broader research community, potentially accelerating progress in understanding social dynamics and urban planning.</p><p>Wang et al. (2025) advance scientific reasoning capabilities with THE-Tree, showing how AI systems can begin to understand and predict the evolution of scientific knowledge. Their work opens new possibilities for AI-assisted research and discovery, potentially transforming how scientific progress occurs.</p><p>Critical Assessment and Future Directions</p><p>The progress demonstrated in these papers represents significant advances across multiple domains of AI research, yet several challenges and limitations remain. The computational requirements for large-scale simulation remain substantial, requiring careful optimization and efficient implementation. The accuracy of simulations depends heavily on the quality of underlying language models, which may contain biases or inaccuracies that propagate through agent behaviors. Additionally, validating simulation results against real-world data remains challenging, particularly for long-term predictions or novel scenarios.</p><p>The hierarchical reasoning advances, while impressive, require further validation across diverse problem domains to establish their generalizability. The spatial reasoning improvements, though significant, still fall short of human-level performance, indicating substantial room for further development. Safety and alignment research, while showing promising results, faces the fundamental challenge of ensuring robustness across the full spectrum of possible AI applications and deployment scenarios.</p><p>Future research directions emerging from this work point toward several promising areas. The convergence of capabilities across different domains suggests movement toward AI systems that can integrate reasoning, perception, social understanding, and physical interaction in ways that mirror human intelligence. The efficiency gains demonstrated by the hierarchical reasoning model suggest that architectural innovation may be more important than scale for achieving advanced capabilities, potentially making sophisticated AI more accessible and sustainable.</p><p>The urban simulation advances open new possibilities for understanding complex social phenomena and testing policy interventions before implementation. Future work in this area might extend to global-scale simulations, incorporating economic dynamics, environmental factors, and cross-cultural variations in behavior. The embodied intelligence research points toward robots that can work alongside humans in complex, dynamic environments, requiring advances in real-time adaptation, safety assurance, and human-robot collaboration.</p><p>Safety and alignment research must continue to evolve alongside advancing capabilities, developing new methods for ensuring AI systems remain beneficial and controllable as they become more powerful and autonomous. This includes work on value alignment, robustness verification, and governance frameworks for AI development and deployment.</p><p>The integration of these advances suggests a future where AI systems become increasingly sophisticated partners in human endeavors, enhancing our capabilities while remaining aligned with human values and goals. The trajectory of current research indicates movement toward AI that is not just more powerful, but more thoughtful, collaborative, and beneficial. The continued development of these technologies will require ongoing collaboration between researchers, policymakers, and society at large to ensure that the benefits of AI are realized while mitigating potential risks.</p><p>Bougie, N., et al.

They debate a question over and over, reading their own past comments each time. The round robin ends as soon as their answers overlap by at least </p>, or after fifteen tries if they cannot get there.</p><p>For this follow up we ran  fresh sessions. We threw out an earlier test run that never settled. This article retells those five sessions in friendly language.</p><p>The idea of letting computer programs argue with one another may sound like science fiction, yet that is exactly what the OrKa platform lets us explore. If you have ever watched a panel debate on television, you know that lively disagreement, pauses for reflection, and gradual shifts in attitude often tell you more than the final verdict itself. The same holds true here, except our panelists are software agents.</p><p>Started in April, today OrKa reached version 0.7.0 and gained the memory features needed to let agents remember their prior words. With memory in place we could try something bold: ask them difficult questions, invite them to talk among themselves, and watch them circle around their own uncertainty until they either line up or throw in the towel.</p><p>We ran six tests at first. One of those tests kept spinning its wheels, and the user asked us to leave that one out of the public story. The five remaining sessions make up the heart of this article. They reveal an encouraging pattern: disagreement is not the enemy, and patience often produces surprising common ground.</p><p>My goal here is to walk through every step in plain language. You will meet each digital speaker, peek inside the looping process, read human style summaries of each debate, and see how the numbers fit the narrative. Just as important, you will see where the software hesitated, second guessed itself, and sometimes taught itself a new angle. Those moments of hesitation are the most human like part of the story.</p><p>The rest of this long journey is divided into sections that each focus on one aspect of the project. If you want to skip ahead to a specific debate, the table of contents below can guide you. Otherwise grab a cup of coffee, settle in, and enjoy the ride through five lively digital conversations.</p><ol><li>Meet the Digital Roundtable\n</li><li>Building the Conversation Engine\n</li><li>The Five Questions and Why They Matter\n</li><li>Run Two: How Four Loops Settled AI Regulation\n</li><li>Run Three: Agreement at the Speed of Two Loops\n</li><li>Run Four: Asking About OrKa and Its Creator\n</li><li>Run Five: Pluto’s Planet Status Revisited\n</li><li>Run Six: Minsky’s Old Book Faces Modern Minds\n</li><li>Patterns Across All Five Sessions\n</li><li>The Road Ahead and Final Thoughts\n</li></ol><h2>\n  \n  \n  2. Meet the Digital Roundtable\n</h2><p>Every debate needs a cast of characters. In this case our characters are simple software scripts that wrap around a large language model. Each script feeds the model a different set of instructions, giving it a distinct voice. Think of the underlying language model as a versatile actor and the scripts as costumes and motivation notes.</p><p>Below you will find a straightforward introduction to each member of the panel, along with a short sample quote that captures the spirit of that agent. The quotes come from early test runs and are edited only for length.</p><p>: Lay out clean arguments, cite formal rules, remove fuzzy feelings.: Confident and precise.: “Given the harm principle and the factual trend of bias amplification, government oversight remains logically necessary.”</p><p>: Speak for human concerns and emotional impact.: Warm, careful, often reminds others of vulnerable populations.: “People already feel invisible in digital systems. Any policy that ignores their lived experience risks deepening the wound.”</p><p>: Question every claim, challenge hidden assumptions, refuse easy harmony.: Contrarian but not malicious.: “We assume new labels fix old bias, yet history shows ambitious regulation often just moves the bias to a new corner.”</p><p>: Fetch memories from earlier loops, highlight past statements, provide context.: Patient, sometimes dry.: “In loop three Logic said, ‘regulation guarantees accountability.’ In loop five that shifted to ‘likely improves accountability.’ Noted for future.”</p><p>: Read every other agent’s answer, calculate how similar they are, and suggest ways to close the remaining gap.: Neutral, concise.: “Current overlap is zero point seven two. Empathy and Skeptic disagree on enforcement speed. A compromise might involve phased rollout.”</p><p>The Moderator does not decide truth, nor does it force agreement. It simply measures similarity, summarises friction points, and offers a nudge. If the agents want to ignore that nudge, they can. That freedom is crucial. Forced consensus would cheapen the exercise.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  3. Building the Conversation Engine\n</h2><p>The core idea is easy to picture:</p><ol><li>Put a question on the table.\n</li><li>Store those answers in shared memory.\n</li><li>Ask the Moderator to measure how close the answers are.\n</li><li>If closeness is already above the target, we wrap up.\n</li><li>Otherwise the Moderator writes a short suggestion.\n</li><li>The suggestion plus each agent’s own last answer becomes new input for the next loop.\n</li><li>Repeat until closeness passes the target or we run out of patience.</li></ol><p>Every answer becomes a numeric list called an embedding. The closer two lists point in space, the closer the answers. The average closeness across all agent pairs gives us one score. We want zero point eight five or higher.</p><p>If each agent wrote a single answer and left the room you would see four viewpoints but no growth. The loop design keeps them in the room, forces them to face prior words, and raises the chance they spot gaps in their own stance.</p><p>Historian waits two loops before quoting past lines. That delay simulates imperfect recall and prevents the discussion from becoming pure echo.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  4. The Five Questions and Why They Matter\n</h2><div><table><thead><tr></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Should governments regulate AI?</td><td>Big ethics, big money, built in friction</td></tr><tr><td>Same AI regulation prompt, new random seed</td></tr><tr><td>What do you know about OrKa reasoning and Marco Somma?</td><td>Self reference reveals platform understanding</td></tr><tr><td>Should Pluto be called a planet again?</td><td>Science meets public emotion</td></tr><tr><td>Is Marvin Minsky’s Society of Mind still relevant?</td><td>Old idea under modern light</td></tr></tbody></table></div><h2>\n  \n  \n  5.

Add specifics on audit funding and citizen participation.</p><p>All active agents mention a shared funding pool financed by licensing fees and agree on citizen panels with affected communities.<p>\nFinal closeness: zero point eight five.</p></p><p>Narrative takeaway: Trust hinged on audit funding. Four loops, moderate friction, solid result.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  6. Run Three: Agreement at the Speed of Two Loops\n</h2><ul><li>Logic demands public interest safeguards.\n</li><li>Empathy uses the exact phrase public interest safeguards.\n</li><li>Skeptic asks who defines public interest.\n</li><li>Historian lists historical acts.\nCloseness: zero point seven two.</li></ul><p>Define public interest plainly. Maybe include yearly review panels.</p><ul><li>Logic defines it as protection against harm plus fair access.\n</li><li>Empathy copies that definition nearly word for word.\n</li><li>Skeptic accepts with a sunset clause.\n</li><li>Historian quotes the shared text.\nCloseness: zero point eight seven.</li></ul><p>Narrative takeaway: Shared language acted like glue. Two loops, highest score.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  7. Run Four: Asking About OrKa and Its Creator\n</h2><p>Logic outlines OrKa design. Empathy praises open traceability. Skeptic wants proof logs help. Historian quotes early blog posts.<p>\nCloseness: zero point five four.</p></p><p>Skeptic seeks proof. Offer examples where trace logs helped.</p><p>Logic cites a medical audit. Empathy cites a hiring case. Skeptic says logs can hide issues. Historian mentions version history.<p>\nCloseness: zero point six nine.</p></p><p>Discuss ways to avoid trace overload with summarised layers.</p><p>Logic proposes compression layers. Empathy suggests dashboards. Skeptic agrees summaries reduce noise. Historian notes the shift.<p>\nCloseness: zero point eight.</p></p><p>Summarise consensus in one line.</p><p>All agents echo a single sentence about clear layered logs.<p>\nFinal closeness: zero point eight five.</p></p><p>Narrative takeaway: Skeptic’s overload worry found a neat fix through log compression.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  8. Run Five: Pluto’s Planet Status Revisited\n</h2><p>This required ten loops. Highlights only:</p><ul><li>Early loops stuck on orbital clearing versus cultural identity.\n</li><li>Moderator pushed for plain language definition.\n</li><li>Shared hybrid label Classical planet culturally and dwarf planet dynamically broke the stalemate.\n</li><li>Final closeness reached zero point eight five on loop ten.</li></ul><h2>\n  \n  \n  9. Run Six: Minsky’s Old Book Faces Modern Minds\n</h2><p>Thirteen loops, major twists:</p><ul><li>Skeptic doubted old metaphors.\n</li><li>Historian exposed Logic contradictions.\n</li><li>Moderator encouraged a building foundation analogy.\n</li><li>Shared sentence Society of Mind remains a strong foundation that needs modern reinforcement settled the matter.\n</li><li>Closeness hit zero point eight five on loop thirteen.</li></ul><h2>\n  \n  \n  10. Patterns Across All Five Sessions\n</h2><ol><li> a bit more than six.\n</li><li> zero point eight seven.\n</li><li><strong>Shared phrases speed harmony.</strong></li><li><strong>Skeptic shapes the finish line.</strong></li><li><strong>Historian’s two loop delay adds reflection.</strong></li><li><strong>Moderator serves as scorekeeper not judge.</strong></li></ol><h2>\n  \n  \n  11. The Road Ahead and Final Thoughts\n</h2><p>Digital disagreements produce richer answers than single shot responses. The five runs prove patience and memory can turn friction into insight. You can run your own loops using the public code. Expect surprises. The system is small now but the idea scales: more voices, domain experts, maybe even real time user questions.</p><p>Thank you for reading this long tour.

At the heart of this transformation lies the artificial intelligence developer, whose expertise is reshaping how we think about money, transactions, and financial services. Banks worldwide are investing billions in AI solutions, with the global AI in banking market expected to reach $64.03 billion by 2030.</p><p>This shift isn't just about adopting new tools – it's about reimagining the entire banking experience. From personalized customer service to fraud detection systems that work in milliseconds, AI is becoming the backbone of modern financial institutions. The professionals driving this change are the skilled artificial intelligence developer teams who understand both complex algorithms and real-world banking needs.</p><h2><strong>How Machine Learning Transforms Banking Operations</strong></h2><p>Machine learning has become the silent engine powering today's banking operations. Every time you check your account balance or make a mobile payment, sophisticated algorithms work behind the scenes to ensure security and efficiency. Banks like JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America have reported significant improvements in operational efficiency after implementing AI-driven systems.</p><p>The impact goes beyond simple automation. Machine learning models can analyze thousands of transactions per second, identifying patterns that would take human analysts weeks to discover. This capability has reduced processing times by up to 80% in some institutions while maintaining higher accuracy rates than traditional methods.</p><h2><strong>Real-Time Fraud Detection Systems</strong></h2><p>Modern fraud detection represents one of AI's most impressive banking applications. Traditional rule-based systems could only catch obvious fraud attempts, but today's AI systems learn from millions of transactions to spot subtle anomalies. An experienced artificial intelligence developer designs these systems to adapt continuously, learning from new fraud patterns as they emerge.</p><p>Major banks report fraud detection rates improving by over 50% since implementing AI solutions. The technology can flag suspicious activities within milliseconds, often preventing fraud before it occurs rather than just detecting it afterward.</p><h2><strong>Automated Customer Service Revolution</strong></h2><p>Chatbots and virtual assistants have evolved far beyond simple question-and-answer systems. Today's AI-powered customer service tools can handle complex banking queries, process account changes, and even provide financial advice. The artificial intelligence developer behind these systems focuses on creating natural conversations that feel human-like while maintaining the precision banks require.</p><p>Statistics show that 73% of banking customers prefer AI-powered support for routine inquiries, appreciating the 24/7 availability and instant responses. This shift has allowed human staff to focus on more complex customer needs while AI handles the volume of basic requests.</p><h2><strong>Personalized Banking Through AI Innovation</strong></h2><p>Personalization has become the new standard in banking, and AI makes it possible at scale. Every customer interaction generates data that helps banks understand individual preferences, spending patterns, and financial goals. This information enables highly targeted services that feel custom-built for each user.</p><p>The <a href=\"https://magicfactory.tech/hire-ai-developers/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">artificial intelligence developer</a> working on personalization systems must balance multiple factors: customer privacy, regulatory compliance, and business objectives. The result is banking experiences that adapt to individual needs while maintaining the security and trust that financial services require.</p><h2><strong>Smart Wealth Management Solutions</strong></h2><p>AI-driven wealth management platforms now serve customers who previously couldn't access personalized investment advice. These systems analyze market trends, risk tolerance, and individual goals to create tailored investment strategies. Robo-advisors manage over $1.4 trillion in assets globally, demonstrating the trust customers place in AI-powered financial guidance.</p><p>The technology democratizes wealth management by making sophisticated investment strategies available to retail customers at a fraction of traditional costs. An artificial intelligence developer creates algorithms that can rebalance portfolios, optimize tax strategies, and adjust risk levels automatically based on market conditions and personal circumstances.</p><h2><strong>Predictive Financial Planning</strong></h2><p>Banks now offer predictive insights that help customers make better financial decisions. AI systems can forecast cash flow patterns, predict when customers might face financial stress, and suggest proactive solutions. This shift from reactive to predictive banking represents a fundamental change in how financial institutions serve their customers.</p><p>These predictive capabilities extend to business banking as well, where AI helps companies optimize cash management, predict seasonal fluctuations, and make more informed investment decisions.</p><h2><strong>Risk Assessment and Credit Scoring Evolution</strong></h2><p>Traditional credit scoring relied on limited data points and historical patterns that often excluded worthy borrowers. Modern AI systems analyze hundreds of variables to create more accurate and inclusive credit assessments. This evolution has opened banking services to previously underserved populations while reducing default rates for lenders.</p><p>The artificial intelligence developer working on credit systems must navigate complex regulatory requirements while building models that are both accurate and fair. The challenge involves creating algorithms that can assess risk without perpetuating historical biases or discrimination.</p><h2><strong>Alternative Data Integration</strong></h2><p>AI systems now incorporate non-traditional data sources like social media activity, mobile phone usage patterns, and online behavior to assess creditworthiness.

No problem.</p><p>Once installed, you’ll have access to an interface that feels like your own AI control panel.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Step 2: Choosing the Right AI&nbsp;Model\n</h2><p>Once installation is done, open the ModelHQ application, and then you will be prompted to add a setup method. The setup guide is provided after buying the application.</p><p>After this, you will land in the main menu. Now, click on the Chat button.</p><p>You’ll be prompted to select an AI model. If you’re unsure which model to choose, you can click on “choose for me,” and the application will select a suitable model based on your needs. Model HQ comes up with 100+ models.</p><ul><li><p>:\n~1– 3 billion parameters:- Fastest response time, suitable for basic chat.</p></li><li><p>:\n~7– 8 billion parameters:- Balanced performance, ideal for chat, data analysis, and standard RAG tasks.</p></li><li><p>:\n~9 – up to 32 billion parameters:- Most powerful chat, RAG, and best for advanced and complex analytical workloads.</p></li></ul><p>By the way, Model HQ will pick a smart default based on your system and use case.</p><blockquote><p>The size of the model you choose can significantly impact both speed and output quality. <strong>Smaller models are faster but may provide less detailed responses</strong>. Follow this simple rule:</p></blockquote><h2>\n  \n  \n  Step 3. Downloading Models\n</h2><p>For demonstration purposes, we are selecting the .<p>\nIf no models have been downloaded previously (e.g., in the </p>, , or  paths), the selected model will begin downloading automatically.<p>\nThis process typically takes </p>, depending on the model you selected and your internet speed.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>This is only a <strong>one-time internet requirement</strong>; once the models are downloaded, you don’t need internet anymore.</p></blockquote><p>Once you’ve selected a model, you can start a chat by typing in your questions. For example, you might ask a simple question like, “What are the top sites to see in Paris?” The model will generate a response based on its training data.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Customizing Your Chat Experience\n</h3><p>Model HQ allows you to customize your chat experience further. You can adjust settings such as the maximum output length and the randomness of the responses (known as temperature). By default, the app is set to generate up to 1,000 tokens, which is usually sufficient for smaller models. However, even if you’re using larger models, be cautious about increasing this limit, as it can consume more memory and take longer to generate responses. So, in short, you can adjust :</p><ul><li><p>: How long should the response be?</p></li><li><p>: Should the answer be creative or precise?</p></li><li><p>: Hit ❌ to stop a long generation anytime.</p></li></ul><h2>\n  \n  \n  Step 5: Integrating Sources for Enhanced Responses\n</h2><p>One of the standout features of Model HQ is its ability to integrate sources, such as documents and images, into your chat.

It lets you package trained models as containers with consistent REST APIs—no custom server code required. In this guide, we’ll cover everything you need to know to use Docker Model Runner in real-world development workflows, including how to run models locally, configure Docker Desktop, connect from Node.js apps, use Docker Compose for orchestration, and follow best practices.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  What Is Docker Model Runner?\n</h3><p>Docker Model Runner lets you package your trained model with metadata that tells Docker how to serve it. When you run the resulting image, you get a standardized REST API automatically, with endpoints like /predict and /health. This eliminates the need to write and maintain your own serving code.</p><p>Traditionally, serving ML models required custom web servers, complex dependency management, and inconsistent APIs across teams. Docker Model Runner solves this by:</p><ul><li>Providing consistent APIs across all models.</li><li>Simplifying local development.</li><li>Making models portable across machines and environments.</li><li>Reducing maintenance by removing custom server code.</li></ul><p>Docker Model Runner supports a wide range of frameworks:</p><ul><li>Hugging Face Transformers</li></ul><p>This means you can use the same approach for a huge variety of ML workloads.</p><p> Train your model. Write a  describing the framework and location of your model. Build your Docker image with this metadata and your model files. Run the container and get a consistent REST API without writing server code.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Running Models Locally with Docker Model Runner\n</h3><p>Below is a real example using the ai/smollm2:latest model running locally. This demonstrates how easy it is to list available models and start a local interactive chat session.</p><p><code>docker model pull ai/smollm2:latest</code></p><p><strong>View the models available:</strong></p><p><code>docker model run ai/smollm2:latest</code></p><p>You’ll get an interactive chat session where you can type questions directly to the model.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Docker Desktop Settings for Local Model Running\n</h3><p>Need to update the settings in Docker Desktop. Allow TCP host connections for Model Runner via Docker Desktop settings or using CLI options for advanced networking control.</p><p>Docker Desktop makes it even easier to manage these models:</p><ul><li>Navigate to the  tab in Docker Desktop.</li><li>Browse and manage available local models.</li><li>Launch interactive chat interfaces directly from the UI.</li><li>Monitor container resource usage and logs.</li></ul><p>You can adjust resource allocation in Settings → Resources, making sure your local environment has enough CPU and memory to handle larger models.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Using Docker Models in a Node.js App\n</h3><p>You can use Docker Model Runner locally with any language. Here’s how you’d connect to your local model from a simple Node.js app.</p><p><strong>Example Express.js Route:</strong></p><div><pre><code>app.post('/generate', async (req, res) =&gt; {\n  const prompt = req.body.prompt;\n  const response = await fetch('http://localhost:5000/predict', {\n    method: 'POST',\n    headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },\n    body: JSON.stringify({ prompt })\n  });\n  const data = await response.json();\n  res.send(data);\n});\n</code></pre></div><ul><li>Your app code never changes if you swap models.</li><li>You can test locally and later deploy the same model container in production.</li><li>Changing models is as simple as changing the running container.</li></ul><h3>\n  \n  \n  Using Docker Compose for Multi-Model Pipelines\n</h3><p>You can chain multiple Model Runner services using Docker Compose to build advanced workflows.</p><p><strong>Example Use Case: Content Moderation Pipeline</strong></p><ul><li>Toxicity Detection MCP → Check user input.</li><li>Language Detection MCP → Identify language.</li><li>Translation MCP → Normalize to English.</li><li>Summarization MCP → Condense for storage.</li></ul><p>docker-compose.yml Example:</p><div><pre><code>version: \"3.8\"\nservices:\n  toxicity-detector:\n    image: myorg/toxicity-mcp\n    ports:\n      - \"5001:80\"\n  language-detector:\n    image: myorg/langdetect-mcp\n    ports:\n      - \"5002:80\"\n  translator:\n    image: myorg/translator-mcp\n    ports:\n      - \"5003:80\"\n  summarizer:\n    image: myorg/summarizer-mcp\n    ports:\n      - \"5004:80\"\n</code></pre></div><p>Now your app can call each service in sequence for a complete moderation and summarization pipeline.</p><ul><li>Define your model-runner.yaml in the repo.</li><li>Build Docker images in CI pipelines.</li><li>Tag images with version numbers or commit SHAs.</li><li>Run Docker Scout or other scanners for CVEs.</li><li>Push images to internal or external registries.</li><li>Deploy using Compose, Swarm, or Kubernetes.</li><li>Include automated health checks against /health.</li></ul><p>This ensures your model deployment is as maintainable and secure as any other Microservice.</p><ul><li>Always define clear input/output contracts.</li><li>Use private registries for internal or proprietary models.</li><li>Tag images with semantic versions.</li><li>Scan images regularly for vulnerabilities.</li><li>Keep model-runner.yaml under version control.</li><li>Automate builds and deployments via CI/CD.</li><li>Use resource limits in Docker Desktop settings to avoid overloading local environments.</li><li>Document how to call /predict and interpret results for consuming teams.</li></ul><p>Docker Model Runner isn't just a convenience tool—it's a shift in how teams can think about model serving. Instead of building and maintaining custom servers for every model, you get standardization, portability, and repeatability. Whether you’re running a small LLM locally for testing, deploying to production Kubernetes clusters, or sharing images across teams, Docker Model Runner makes model serving a first-class, manageable part of your software architecture.</p>","contentLength":5424,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"[es] ¿IAhora qué? #01 - el comienzo","url":"https://dev.to/elasfalamtech/es-iahora-que-01-el-comienzo-2efg","date":1751422988,"author":"Clarice Regina","guid":179538,"unread":true,"content":"<p>Iniciamos en Elas Falam Tech un viaje de descubrimiento sobre el mundo de la Inteligencia Artificial.</p><p>Para sintonizar: usamos mucho ChatGPT, Gemini y Copilot para diversos propósitos.

That’s where I was.</p><p>Until one weekend, I got curious.</p><p>I have worked for a couple of clients for a while. I know Knowledge graphs (KGs) can already organize massive amounts of complex information into structured, machine-readable knowledge. But one big problem when building a knowledge graph is that it usually needs a fixed structure, called a schema, before you even start.</p><p>Think of it like trying to build a Lego castle, but someone tells you exactly where every brick must go before you begin. That might work for one type of castle, but what if you want to build a spaceship next? You’d have to start all over again with a new plan.</p><p>In the old way, experts would have to design these schemas by prompting LLM, which limits the scalability, adaptability, and it only works well for one topic or domain. If new data comes in or if the topic changes, the whole graph might stop working or need major updates. It’s not very flexible.</p><p>But a new method I discovered to solve this problem automatically induces schemas directly from unstructured text using large language models, enabling fully autonomous, large-scale knowledge graph construction that can dynamically adapt to diverse and evolving domains without redesigning the schema.</p><p>AutoSchemaKG has significantly improved construction efficiency. According to experimental data, compared with traditional methods, this framework can shorten the construction time of knowledge graphs by about 70% while maintaining a high accuracy rate.</p><p>This achievement not only reduces costs but also makes it possible to update large-scale knowledge graphs in real time, truly realizing the combination of “intelligence” and “efficiency”.</p><p>So, let me give you a quick demo of a live chatbot to show you what I mean.</p><p>I will ask the chatbot a question: “Who is Alex?” If you take a look at how the chatbot generates the output, you’ll see that the agent searches through its internal knowledge graph. It made sure all the nodes in the graph have the required attributes like 'type', 'id', and 'file_id'So every part of the graph is well-structured and ready for retrieval. If any of these were missing, the agent automatically assigned sensible defaults, like marking a node as \"text\" If its ID matched known text entries, or \"entity\" otherwise.</p><p>Once the graph is ready, the agent uses a sentence encoder to turn the question, the graph’s nodes, edges, and text content into vector embeddings. These embeddings are then stored in FAISS indexes, which makes the retrieval process super fast.</p><p>After that, I used the HippoRAG2Retriever to combine the LLM generator and the graph data. When I asked “Who is Alex?”, the retriever scanned the graph’s text, nodes, and edges for the most relevant matches based on similarity scores. It picked the top 2 most relevant pieces of context, sorted them, and passed them into the modelLLMGenerator, which then used the context to generate a final answer.</p><p>So, by the end of this Story, you will understand what AutoSchemaKG is, how it works, and how we are going to automate the Knowledge Graph Schema to create a powerful Agentic chatbot.</p><p>This code will be on my Patreon because it takes me a lot of time to build, and i you could support me, I will appreciate that.</p><p>AutoSchemaKG is a framework for building a knowledge graph (KG) completely autonomously, eliminating the need for predefined schemas. The system uses large language models (LLMs) to perform knowledge triple extraction and schema induction simultaneously, directly from text data in a web-scale corpus.</p><p>AutoSchemaKG is the conceptualization process that drives schema induction. It generalizes concrete entities, events, and relations into broader conceptual categories through abstraction mechanisms.</p><p>This conceptualization includes: building semantic bridges between different information, supporting zero-shot cross-domain reasoning, reducing sparsity in KGs, and providing a hierarchical organization structure that supports both concrete and abstract reasoning.</p><p>AutoSchemaKG converts unstructured text into a structured knowledge graph through a two-part process. In the first part, it uses a large language model to extract three types of relationships in stages: entity-entity relations, such as identifying that “Einstein” worked at “Princeton”; entity-event relations, such as linking “Einstein” to the “discovery of the theory of relativity”; and event-event relations, such as connecting “World War I” to “World War II.”</p><p>Each relationship is turned into a triple — two elements connected by a relation — and stored with the original text and metadata. In the second part, called schema induction, the system abstracts specific entities, events, and relations into higher-level concept types using the language model. For example, “Einstein” might be labelled as a “scientist,” and “Theory of Relativity” as a “scientific theory.”</p><p>It uses information from neighboring nodes to add more context, processes everything in batches for speed, and saves the results in a CSV file. This allows the final knowledge graph to be flexible, scalable, and usable across different domains without manual schema design.</p><p>GraphRAG and AutoSchemaKG can’t compete together. Each approach has its unique advantages and is suited for different stages.</p><p>GraphRAG excels at leveraging existing or manually curated knowledge graphs to enhance retrieval and reasoning tasks, especially when high-quality, domain-specific graphs are available.</p><p>AutoSchemaKG focuses on automatically constructing large, flexible, and comprehensive knowledge graphs from unstructured data without manual schemas, enabling scalability and extensive domain coverage.</p><p>Together, these approaches can be integrated: AutoSchemaKG can automatically generate knowledge graphs that can later be used by GraphRAG to improve performance in various tasks.</p><p>Let us now explore step by step and unravel the answer to how to automate the Knowledge Graph Schema. We will install the libraries that support the model. For this, we will do a pip install requirements</p><p>The next step is the usual one: We will import the relevant libraries, the significance of which will become evident as we proceed.</p><p>Atlas-Rag a framework for fully autonomous knowledge graph construction that eliminates the need for predefined schemas.</p><p>I set the environment to use GPU device 1 os.environ['CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES'] = '1' to control which GPU is used during processing. Then, I imported key components like TripleGenerator, KnowledgeGraphExtractor, and ProcessingConfig from the atlas_rag to work with knowledge graphs, and also brought in the OpenAI class to connect with a model API.</p><p>I developed an OpenAI client using a custom base URL from DeepInfra and an API key to connect with the model. I set the keyword to 'Dulce' and created an output directory path based on that keyword. Finally, I initialized the TripleGenerator using the OpenAI client and customising it with parameters likemax_new_tokens = 4096a low temperature = 0.1 For more deterministic results, and frequency_penalty = 1.1 to reduce repetition in the output.</p><div><pre><code>import os \nfrom atlas_rag import TripleGenerator, KnowledgeGraphExtractor, ProcessingConfig\nfrom openai import OpenAI\n\nos.environ['CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES'] = '1'\n\nmodel_name = \"meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct\"\n\nclient = OpenAI(\n base_url=\"https://api.deepinfra.com/v1/openai\",\n api_key=\"\",\n)\n\nkeyword = 'Dulce'\noutput_directory = f'import/{keyword}'\ntriple_generator = TripleGenerator(client, model_name=model_name,\nmax_new_tokens = 4096,\ntemperature = 0.1,\nfrequency_penalty = 1.1)\n</code></pre></div><p>Then I made the knowledge graph extraction pipeline, and I created a ProcessingConfig called kg_extraction_config, where I set the model path to the LLaMA 3.3 model, I pointed the data source to the \"example_data\" folder, filtered files using the keyword As the filename pattern, set a small batch size of 4 for manageable processing, and define the output directory.</p><p>So I made a KnowledgeGraphExtractor using the triple_generator and my custom config, and developed the logic to start the extraction with run_extraction(), which automatically reads the input data, generates triples, and writes them to JSON. Lastly, I added a step to convert the extracted JSON data into a structured CSV file using convert_json_to_csv() to make the results easy to view and analyse.</p><div><pre><code>kg_extraction_config = ProcessingConfig(\n      model_path=model_name,\n      data_directory=\"example_data\",\n      filename_pattern=keyword,\n      batch_size=4,\n      output_directory=f\"{output_directory}\",\n)\nkg_extractor = KnowledgeGraphExtractor(model=triple_generator, config=kg_extraction_config)\nkg_extractor.run_extraction()\nkg_extractor.convert_json_to_csv()\n</code></pre></div><p>After that, I developed a script to manually generate the concept CSV files and then build a complete directed knowledge graph in Graph format. First, I made sure the concept_csv directory exists inside the output folder. I read the original nodes and edges from the triples_csv directory and saved exact copies of them as concept_nodes and triple_edges In the new concept folder.</p><p>Since there were no explicit concept-to-concept links, I created an empty concept_edges CSV with the correct column structure. Then, I used NetworkX to build a directed graph (DiGraph).</p><p>I added each node from the original node file with detailed attributes like id, type, concepts, and synsets, and also added text nodes by reading a separate text_nodes CSV. Next, I developed edges in the graph by linking entities/events using the data from the original edges file, and added additional “mentions” edges from the text_edges file, if present.</p><p>Finally, I created a kg_graphml directory and exported the full graph to a .graphml file, summarizing the result with a print statement showing the total number of nodes and edges created.</p><div><pre><code>import pandas as pd\nimport os\n\n# Create concept_csv directory\nos.makedirs(f\"{output_directory}/concept_csv\", exist_ok=True)\n\n# Read original files\nnodes_df = pd.read_csv(f\"{output_directory}/triples_csv/triple_nodes_{keyword}_from_json_without_emb.csv\")\nedges_df = pd.read_csv(f\"{output_directory}/triples_csv/triple_edges_{keyword}_from_json_without_emb.csv\")\n\n# Manually create what create_concept_csv should have created:\n\n# 1. concept_nodes file (copy of original nodes)\nnodes_df.to_csv(f\"{output_directory}/concept_csv/concept_nodes_{keyword}_from_json_with_concept.csv\", index=False)\n\n# 2. triple_edges file (copy of original edges) \nedges_df.to_csv(f\"{output_directory}/concept_csv/triple_edges_{keyword}_from_json_with_concept.csv\", index=False)\n\n# 3. concept_edges file (empty since no concepts)\nconcept_edges_df = pd.DataFrame(columns=[':START_ID', ':END_ID', 'relation', ':TYPE'])\nconcept_edges_df.to_csv(f\"{output_directory}/concept_csv/concept_edges_{keyword}_from_json_with_concept.csv\", index=False)\n\nprint(\"Concept CSV files created manually\")\n\n# Now create the GraphML with proper 'id' attributes\nimport networkx as nx\n\nG = nx.DiGraph()\n\n# Add entity/event nodes\nfor _, row in nodes_df.iterrows():\n    node_id = str(row['name:ID'])\n    G.add_node(node_id,\n               id=node_id,\n               file_id=node_id,\n               type=str(row['type']),\n               concepts=str(row['concepts']),\n               synsets=str(row['synsets']),\n               label=str(row[':LABEL']))\n\n# Add entity/event edges\nfor _, row in edges_df.iterrows():\n    G.add_edge(str(row[':START_ID']), str(row[':END_ID']),\n               relation=str(row['relation']),\n               type=str(row[':TYPE']))\n\n# Add text edges if they exist\ntext_edges_file = f\"{output_directory}/triples_csv/text_edges_{keyword}_from_json.csv\"\nif os.path.exists(text_edges_file):\n    text_edges_df = pd.read_csv(text_edges_file)\n    for _, row in text_edges_df.iterrows():\n        G.add_edge(str(row[':START_ID']), str(row[':END_ID']),\n                   relation=\"mentions\",\n                  relation=\"mentions\",\n\n\nnx.write_graphml(G, f\"{output_directory}/kg_graphml/{keyword}_graph.graphml\")\n\nprint(f\"GraphML created: {G.number_of_nodes()} nodes, {G.number_of_edges()} edges\")\n</code></pre></div><p>I built the RAG pipeline to integrate the key components needed for semantic retrieval and answer generation. I started selecting the \"sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2\" model, known for its speed and accuracy, and loaded it using SentenceTransformer with trust_remote_code=True and device_map=\"auto\" to ensure it runs efficiently on the available hardware.</p><p>I wrapped this model with SentenceEmbedding to transform user queries and documents into dense vectors for similarity-based retrieval. Then, I connected my previously configured OpenAI client and LLaMA 3.3 model to the LLMGenerator, which I used to generate natural language answers based on the retrieved information.</p><div><pre><code># Continue with the RAG setup from the documentation\nfrom sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer\nfrom atlas_rag.retrieval import SentenceEmbedding\nfrom atlas_rag.reader import LLMGenerator\nfrom atlas_rag import create_embeddings_and_index\n\n# Step 4: Setup RAG components\nencoder_model_name = \"sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2\"\nsentence_model = SentenceTransformer(encoder_model_name, trust_remote_code=True, model_kwargs={'device_map': \"auto\"})\nsentence_encoder = SentenceEmbedding(sentence_model)\n\nllm_generator = LLMGenerator(client=client, model_name=model_name)\n</code></pre></div><p>Then I made a complete embedding and indexing pipeline to prepare the knowledge graph data for efficient semantic retrieval. I extracted the original text and their IDs from the text_nodes_df dataframe and built a dictionary mapping each text ID to its corresponding text. Then, I gathered the full list of nodes and edges from the graphG, converting them into strings to use as input for embeddings.</p><p>I used compute_text_embeddings along with the sentence_encoder to compute vector embeddings for three types of elements: original texts, graph nodes, and edges. For each of these, I printed progress updates to track the embedding process. After that, I built FAISS indexes using a helper function create_faiss_index, which normalises and indexes the embeddings using the IndexHNSWFlat structure with inner product similarity.</p><p>I created separate indexes for text, node, and edge embeddings, and also built a combined graph index using both node and edge embeddings. Finally, I wrapped all of this into a unified A data dictionary that includes the graph, lists, embeddings, FAISS indexes, and mappings—setting the stage for fast and flexible retrieval during the RAG workflow.</p><div><pre><code>from atlas_rag.retrieval.indexer import compute_text_embeddings\nimport faiss\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Prepare data for embeddings\noriginal_text_list = text_nodes_df['original_text'].tolist()\ntext_id_list = text_nodes_df['text_id:ID'].tolist()\n\n# Create text dictionary\ntext_dict = {text_id: text for text_id, text in zip(text_id_list, original_text_list)}\n\n# Get node and edge lists from the updated graph G\nnode_list = list(G.nodes())\nedge_list = list(G.edges())\nedge_list_string = [f\"{edge[0]} -&gt; {edge[1]}\" for edge in edge_list]\n\nprint(f\"Computing embeddings for {len(node_list)} nodes, {len(edge_list)} edges, {len(original_text_list)} texts\")\n\n# Compute embeddings\nprint(\"Computing text embeddings...\")\ntext_embeddings = compute_text_embeddings(original_text_list, sentence_encoder, 64, True)\n\nprint(\"Computing node embeddings...\")\nnode_embeddings = compute_text_embeddings(node_list_string, sentence_encoder, 64, True)\n\nprint(\"Computing edge embeddings...\")\nedge_embeddings = compute_text_embeddings(edge_list_string, sentence_encoder, 64, True)\n\n# Create FAISS indexes\ndef create_faiss_index(embeddings):\n   if len(embeddings) == 0:\n       return None\n   dimension = len(embeddings[0])\n   index = faiss.IndexHNSWFlat(dimension, 64, faiss.METRIC_INNER_PRODUCT)\n   X = np.array(embeddings).astype('float32')\n   index.add(X)\n   return index\n\ntext_faiss_index = create_faiss_index(text_embeddings)\nnode_faiss_index = create_faiss_index(node_embeddings)\nedge_faiss_index = create_faiss_index(edge_embeddings)\ngraph_faiss_index = create_faiss_index(node_embeddings + edge_embeddings)\n\nprint(f\"Created {len(text_embeddings)} text, {len(node_embeddings)} node, {len(edge_embeddings)} edge embeddings\")\n\n# Create comprehensive data structure with updated graph G\ndata = {\n   # Graph data (G now includes both entity/event nodes AND text nodes)\n   'graph': G,\n   'KG': G,\n\n   # Node data\n   'node_list': node_list,\n   'node_embeddings': node_embeddings,\n   'node_list_string': node_list_string,\n   'node_faiss_index': node_faiss_index,\n\n   # Edge data  \n   'edge_list': edge_list,\n   'edge_embeddings': edge_embeddings,\n   'edge_list_string': edge_list_string,\n   'edge_faiss_index': edge_faiss_index,\n\n   # Combined\n   'node_and_edge_embeddings': node_embeddings + edge_embeddings,\n\n   # Text data\n\n\n   # Combined graph index\n   'graph_faiss_index': graph_faiss_index,\n}\n</code></pre></div><p>I ensured all nodes in the graph had the necessary attributes to check each one for 'type', 'id', and 'file_id'. If a node was missing 'type'I set it to \"text\" if the ID matched a known text ID, or defaulted it to \"entity\". Missing 'id' and 'file_id' Fields were both filled in with the node's own ID.</p><p>I verified the fix to print attributes for a few nodes, then updated the data structure to include the corrected graph.

Once groundbreaking for delivering software via the cloud, SaaS is now the norm — no longer a competitive advantage in itself. What separates today's leading platforms from the rest isn't UX polish or pricing tiers — it's intelligence.</p><p>Modern users expect more than functionality; they want foresight. SaaS that can recommend, adapt, and respond without being told what to do. In short, users are craving smarter software.</p><p>At the heart of this evolution is the <a href=\"https://magicfactory.tech/hire-ai-developers/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">artificial intelligence developer</a>: the unseen architect engineering the intelligence layer that turns reactive SaaS into predictive, personalized platforms.</p><p>SaaS Has Evolved — So Must the Product Strategy\nTraditionally, SaaS platforms handled repetitive tasks. Project management tools organized work. CRMs stored leads. HR systems tracked attendance. But these days, customers expect more than just data storage — they want insight and automation.</p><p>The most successful SaaS businesses in 2025 have already made the leap:</p><p>Notion now offers AI summaries and writing assistance.</p><p>Salesforce Einstein delivers predictive lead scoring.</p><p>Zoom transcribes and summarizes meetings automatically.</p><p>What do all these features have in common? Custom-built AI, tailored to the user base — not generic APIs pasted into the product.</p><p>This is where an artificial intelligence developer makes all the difference.</p><p>Where AI Developers Fit into the SaaS Development Lifecycle\nLet’s break it down:</p><ol><li><p>Feature Engineering\nAI devs identify data-rich moments in your platform — user inputs, behaviors, session flows — and build predictive features from them. Think: next-action suggestions, personalized dashboards, or churn risk indicators.</p></li><li><p>ML Model Development\nThey build models based on internal user data. Off-the-shelf models don’t understand your business logic or your customers. AI devs design algorithms that do.</p></li><li><p>Deployment + Integration\nYour SaaS lives in the cloud. So should your AI. Developers handle real-time inference pipelines, cloud scaling, and microservice integrations with your existing stack.</p></li><li><p>Monitoring + Feedback\nThey create automated retraining loops, flag model drift, and ensure your AI doesn’t degrade over time.</p></li></ol><p>Why Generic AI Tools Fall Short for SaaS\nPlatforms like OpenAI, Azure Cognitive Services, and Google AutoML make it seem like anyone can add AI to their product. But those tools are only as good as their configuration — and they aren’t trained on your platform’s data.</p><p>Here's the catch: most out-of-the-box AI systems lack domain context. They can classify emails or summarize text, but they can't:</p><p>Understand how your users actually use your SaaS</p><p>Adapt to edge cases specific to your workflows</p><p>Integrate deeply with proprietary features</p><p>An artificial intelligence developer can. They train systems on the context of your users, not someone else's.</p><p>Case Study: AI-Powered SaaS in HR Tech\nConsider a mid-sized HR platform managing recruitment pipelines. On the surface, it’s a scheduling tool with ATS features. But by hiring an AI developer, the company added:</p><p>Resume screening using NLP and similarity matching</p><p>Candidate ranking based on company-specific success profiles</p><p>Automated feedback for rejected applicants, tailored to their submissions</p><p>The result? HR teams saved 40% of their screening time, and candidate engagement improved dramatically.</p><p>That’s not plug-and-play AI. That’s custom-built intelligence — and only a developer with the right AI toolkit can deliver it.</p><p>The Strategic Edge: Smarter SaaS Means Stickier Customers\nChurn is SaaS’s silent killer. Features bring users in. But intelligence keeps them there.</p><p>Why? Because smart SaaS platforms learn from each user, growing more useful over time. A personalized experience isn’t just delightful — it’s sticky.</p><p>A CRM that reminds sales reps to follow up before they forget</p><p>A project management tool that predicts bottlenecks based on past sprint data</p><p>A learning platform that adapts lessons to each learner’s pace and behavior</p><p>All of this requires deep model training, thoughtful data pipelines, and feature tuning. You don’t get that from a no-code AI builder. You get it from an artificial intelligence developer.</p><p>Challenges AI Devs Solve for SaaS Teams\nEven talented SaaS product teams often face these roadblocks:</p><p>Data pipelines aren’t AI-ready</p><p>Uncertainty around ML frameworks</p><p>Fear of model bias or legal issues</p><p>An experienced developer doesn’t just code — they architect. They help you collect the right data, clean it, model it, and deploy it ethically. They also speak your language — whether you’re product-led, growth-led, or engineering-heavy.</p><p>What to Look For in an AI Developer for SaaS\nWhen hiring, filter for these traits:</p><p>Experience with SaaS products, not just research prototypes</p><p>Understanding of user flows and product behavior</p><p>Familiarity with cloud platforms like AWS/GCP/Azure</p><p>Comfort working with product managers and UX designers</p><p>It’s not about finding someone who can build GPT from scratch. It’s about someone who can make your software smarter — in the right places, with the right constraints.</p><p>The Future of SaaS Is Predictive\nThe line between product and assistant is fading. Users don’t just want tools. They want outcomes. And AI-powered SaaS is how we get there.</p><p>Soon, all SaaS platforms will be expected to:</p><p>Adapt interfaces dynamically</p><p>Automate decision-making at scale</p><p>And the companies that succeed won’t be the ones with the most features. They’ll be the ones with the smartest features — delivered seamlessly, powered invisibly.</p><p>Conclusion: Don’t Build Another Tool — Build a Smart System\nAdding AI isn’t a gimmick. It’s an evolution. And if you’re not building that layer into your product today, you’ll be racing to catch up tomorrow.</p><p>The smartest SaaS teams already understand this.

And if you’ve ever tried finding a therapist yourself, you know it’s not always easy. Waitlists. Cost. Appointments that don’t quite fit your schedule (or your vibe). I’ve been there—feeling overwhelmed, needing someone to talk to  but not knowing where to turn. That’s where these new <strong>AI tools for mental health</strong> come in. And honestly? It’s kind of wild how far they’ve come.</p><p>We’re talking chatbots you can vent to at 2 a.m. when your brain won’t quiet down. Mood-tracking apps that check in like a concerned friend (except less judgy). And tools that can suggest mindfulness exercises or coping strategies tailored to how you’re feeling  It sounds a bit sci-fi, but these  are already living on our phones—and some are even being used by therapists themselves as helpful sidekicks.</p><p><strong>But can they really help us ?</strong></p><p>That’s the big, messy, fascinating question we’re exploring. Because yes, AI can replicate conversation patterns and predictive emotional responses. But healing? That’s deeply personal. Still, these tools are opening up options, especially when human help isn’t readily available.</p><p>Here are 3 practical ways I’ve seen AI make a tangible difference in real people’s mental health journeys (mine included):</p><ul><li><p><strong>Instant support, no waiting room:</strong> Apps like Wysa or Woebot use AI to simulate therapeutic conversation. It’s not a replacement for a therapist—but it  helpful when you need to work through anxious thoughts or emotional spirals...in the moment.</p></li><li><p><strong>Tracking your mental health trends:</strong> Tools like Youper analyze how your mood shifts over time. I started using it after a tough breakup, and it helped me notice patterns I would’ve totally missed otherwise—like how journaling actually  helping, even if it didn’t feel like it at first.</p></li><li><p><strong>Affordable access to support:</strong> Let’s be real—therapy can be expensive. Many AI tools are free or super low-cost, which can be life-changing if money is a barrier. They may not replace human therapy, but they can definitely fill in the gaps.</p></li></ul><p>Look, I’m not saying AI is going to replace good, old-fashioned, meaningful, human connection. We’re not handing out diplomas to robots just yet. But when life gets heavy and you don’t know who to turn to, having a digital check-in that actually helps? That’s kind of amazing.</p><p>So stick with me. Whether you’re curious, skeptical, or somewhere in between, we’re unpacking it all—how AI might fit into your mental wellness toolkit, the red flags to watch for, and the small but powerful ways it might help you feel heard, understood, and maybe even a little lighter.</p><p>Because healing isn’t one-size-fits-all. And sometimes, the support you need... just might be in your pocket.</p><h2><p>\n  The Mental Health Crisis: Why We Need a Tech Boost</p></h2><p><strong>Did you know over half of people with mental health conditions never get the help they need?</strong> Yep — more than 50%. Not because they don’t want help… but because they just can’t get to it.</p><p>Sound familiar? Maybe you’ve been there — scrolling through a list of therapists, only to find they're booked out for months. Or maybe you’ve had that gut-wrenching moment of clarity: “I need to talk to someone.” And then... crickets. Just a waitlist and a whole lot of overwhelm.</p><p>You're not alone. The mental health system is stretched thin. Therapists are overloaded. Patients are waiting weeks — sometimes even  — just for an initial appointment. And let’s not forget those living in rural areas or busy cities where access is near impossible.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  So... What If Tech Could Fill the Gap?\n</h3><p>Here’s where it gets a little interesting — and maybe even hopeful. Artificial intelligence and digital mental health tools are quietly stepping in, and, honestly, they’re doing more good than most people realize.</p><ul><li><p><strong>AI-Based Mental Health Apps</strong>: Apps like Wysa and Woebot use AI to offer 24/7 emotional support. They're trained in cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) techniques and guide you through daily check-ins, mood tracking, and coping mechanisms — in real time. I've personally used Wysa during a stressful period, and having that supportive \"digital companion\" at 2 a.m.? Game changer.</p></li><li><p><strong>Virtual Therapists on Demand</strong>: Platforms like Talkspace and BetterHelp have embraced AI to match people with therapists faster and more accurately based on their preferences and issues. No more filling out endless forms. Plus, the integration of chatbots supports you while you wait for your human session.</p></li><li><p>: This one blew my mind — some AIs are being designed to detect tone, pattern of speech, and even pauses in conversation to identify signs of anxiety or depression. In some pilot studies, these tools have outperformed human therapists in initial diagnosis accuracy. Wild, right?</p></li></ul><ul><li><p> Download a free AI-based app and try a mood check-in. See how it feels before committing further.</p></li><li><p> If traditional therapy is out of reach, use a service like Talkspace to get digitally matched faster.</p></li><li><p> Follow research into AI mental health tools. New platforms launch almost monthly — keep an eye out!</p></li></ul><p>This isn’t about replacing human connection — not at all. But it’s about meeting people where they are, especially when traditional systems fall short. And if you’ve ever felt ignored, dismissed, or just plain forgotten by the system... </p><p> Mental health tech — especially AI — isn't just a band-aid. It's a bridge. A way forward for millions struggling in silence. With the right mix of humanity and innovation, we might just be on the brink of transforming how the world heals.</p><p>So if you're feeling lost in the mental health maze, don’t give up. Your next breakthrough might just be a tap (or a chatbot) away.</p><h2><p>\n  How Smart Are AI Therapists, Really?</p></h2><p>Did you know some AI therapists can detect emotions just from the way you type? I know — kind of wild, right? It’s like your phone suddenly knows you’re sad before you even do. Creepy or cool? Maybe both.</p><p>Let’s be real — when we think about therapy, most of us imagine a cozy office, a warm cup of tea, and a kind human who listens without judgment. But now? AI-powered tools are sliding into the therapist’s seat. Tools like Woebot and Wysa are using natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning to offer mood tracking, coping strategies, and real-time chats that  surprisingly supportive.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Breaking Down the Brain Behind the Bot\n</h3><p>Okay, so what’s really going on under the hood? These “smart” systems use a few key technologies:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Natural Language Processing (NLP):</strong> This helps AI understand what you're saying (or typing), even when you're vague, sarcastic, or emotional — which, let’s be honest, is all of us when we’re stressed.</p></li><li><p> Some tools pick up on whether you're happy, anxious, or angry, just by analyzing your words, speed, even punctuation. (Yes, your dramatic “I can’t even…” might actually trigger the empathy algorithm!)</p></li><li><p> Over time, the AI gets smarter. It learns your patterns, recognizes mood shifts, and adapts the way it supports you — kind of like a therapist that can remember every single thing you’ve ever said and never gets tired.</p></li></ul><h3>\n  \n  \n  A Real-Life Story: Burnout &amp; a Chatbot\n</h3><p>Let me share about my friend Jamie. Jamie’s the kind of person who’s got five tabs open in her brain at all times — work, family, side hustle, social drama, and self-care (which, let’s be honest, always lands last). When burnout hit — hard — she didn’t have the energy to talk to a human. So she tried an AI-based app that a friend suggested. At first, it felt weird talking to a bot (she literally said “Ugh, I feel like I'm texting a vending machine”). But after a few days, she noticed a shift. She was journaling more, recognizing when her anxiety spiked, and actually . It wasn’t a miracle. But it was a lifeline when she needed one.</p><p>Here’s the thing: while AI therapists are getting smarter, they’re not replacements for human professionals — especially when it comes to serious mental health struggles like trauma, suicidal ideation, or deep clinical depression. In those moments, <strong>nothing can replace real human connection</strong> and clinical expertise. These tools are companions, maybe even coaches. But not saviors.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Making the Most of AI Therapy Tools\n</h3><p>If you’re thinking of trying one out — or recommending one to a friend — here are some solid ways to approach it:</p><ul><li><p> Pair it with in-person or virtual therapy for daily check-ins and coping tools.</p></li><li><p><strong>Be honest with your input.</strong> The more authentically you share how you're feeling, the better the AI can respond. No need to sugarcoat.</p></li><li><p> If you're in crisis or facing deep emotional pain, reach out to a human therapist or a crisis line. AI can't give hugs — or make nuanced clinical judgments.</p></li></ul><p>Look, diagnosing pain through text messages might sound like something out of a sci-fi novel, but these tools are making mental health support more accessible — and more immediate — than ever before. They're not perfect. But they’re stepping stones, helpful guides when the weight gets heavy and the therapist's office feels a world away.</p><p>And if tech can help one more person like Jamie stop and breathe during burnout... well, that sounds like a pretty smart use of artificial intelligence to me.</p><h2><p>\n  Digital Tools vs. Traditional Therapy: Friends or Foes?</p></h2><p><strong>Did you know that over 80% of people with mental health concerns never actually see a therapist?</strong> Wild, right? Whether it's cost, time, stigma, or just not knowing where to start — a whole bunch of us are left navigating our mental health with only Instagram quotes and mood-tracking apps. (Hey, no judgement — I’ve been there too.)</p><p>So it begs the question: are AI mental health tools swooping in as replacements for therapists? Short answer — . Long answer? Let’s dig in. </p><h3>\n  \n  \n  The Real Deal: It’s Not Either-Or\n</h3><p>I totally get the hesitation. The idea of a chatbot or journaling app \"listening\" to your problems might feel kind of... impersonal. Therapy is deeply human — there's eye contact, subtle empathy, the gentle \"mm-hmm\" that lets you know you’re really being heard. Hard for an algorithm to replicate that, right?</p><p>But here's what I've learned (and what helped me when I was between therapists): <strong>digital tools don’t need to compete with therapy — they actually make it more powerful.</strong> It’s like having a mental wellness sidekick right in your pocket, filling in the blanks between therapy sessions instead of replacing them altogether.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Use Cases Where AI &amp; Therapy Totally Click\n</h3><p>If you're wondering how to make the most of both worlds, here’s where digital tools  shine:</p><ul><li><p> Using an AI journaling app like Wysa or Woebot after an intense therapy session helped me process my thoughts in real time AND remember what I wanted to bring up next time.</p></li><li><p> Can't wait two weeks to talk to your therapist about that sudden spike in anxiety? AI tools offer a space to reflect in the moment without bottling it all up.</p></li><li><p><strong>Practice and reinforcement:</strong> CBT-based apps help you apply techniques (like reframing thoughts or breathing exercises) regularly — something I totally struggled to remember when I was going it alone.</p></li></ul><p>Sure, AI doesn’t give hugs or warm validation in the same way a trained human can. But it can patiently walk you through a grounding exercise at 1 a.m. when your thoughts are spiraling. That counts for .</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  When to Stick With Traditional Therapy\n</h3><p>Of course, there are times when a real human voice is non-negotiable:</p><ul><li><p><strong>If you're dealing with trauma or complex emotions:</strong> You need the nuance and expertise that only a licensed therapist can bring.</p></li><li><p> AI tools aren't designed to manage severe mental health emergencies. Always, always reach out to a crisis line or professional in those moments.</p></li><li><p><strong>If you feel stuck using AI alone:</strong> It might be time to loop in a mental health pro who can guide you deeper than an app can go.</p></li></ul><p>It’s not a showdown. It’s a team-up. Think Batman and Robin (if Robin was an app that checks in on your emotional well-being every night). Digital tools and human therapists offer different things –  if that’s what helps you feel more grounded, balanced, and whole.</p><p> AI might not replace the magic of therapy, but it sure can enhance it. So if you're curious, try starting small — maybe a mood tracker or an app that gently nudges you to reflect each day. Even a few minutes can make a bigger difference than you might expect.</p><p>Your mental health deserves support from all angles. So whether it’s a therapist, an app, or both — the most important thing? <em>You’re taking steps. And that’s huge.</em></p><h2><p>\n  Privacy and Ethics: Are We Safe Talking to AI?</p></h2><p><strong>Did you know that some AI mental health apps have shared user conversations with third parties—without users even realizing it?</strong> Yeah… that little confession you type in while crying into your hoodie? It might not be as private as you thought. That’s a real gut punch, especially when we’re being told that AI is here to help us feel  opening up.</p><p>Let’s get real for a second. Chatting with an AI about anxiety spirals, trauma from years ago, or that thing that keeps you up at 2 a.m.—it’s deeply personal. And it feels like a relief to type it out to someone (or something) that won’t judge. But behind that screen? There’s code. And sometimes, people. And definitely .</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  So… what’s really happening with your data?\n</h3><p>I’ve been down this rabbit hole, and here's the tea:</p><ul><li><p>AI apps might collect more than just your messages—they can also grab metadata like when and where you're using the app, what features you use most, and more.</p></li><li><p>Some even use your data to “train” future versions of the AI—unless you explicitly opt out.</p></li><li><p>Others partner with third-party analytics or (brace yourself) advertisers. Mental health data plus marketing? Not a cute combo.</p></li></ul><p>It’s not all spooky, though. There  tools out there trying to do better. But you’ve gotta be smart. Nobody’s going to protect your privacy better than .</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  3 smart moves to protect your mental health data\n</h3><p>Here’s how to take back some control, without abandoning the help you might be getting from AI:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Read the privacy policy (really).</strong> I know, I know—it's like 10 pages of legal espresso. But even skimming for words like \"data sharing\", “third-party”, or \"advertising\" helps. You want clear terms and an option to opt-out of data sharing.</p></li><li><p><strong>Pick tools with transparency badges.</strong> Look for mental health apps that are HIPAA-compliant, have clear encryption policies, or belong to trusted organizations. Names like  and  are making headway here—but always double-check.</p></li><li><p><strong>Stay anonymous where you can.</strong> Sign up with an alias, skip filling in your birthday or location if it’s optional, and avoid linking the app to your Facebook login (huge red flag for data cross-sharing).</p></li></ul><h3>\n  \n  \n  Here’s the truth: you deserve private, judgment-free help\n</h3><p>Talking to an AI when you're feeling low can feel oddly comforting—as if it gets you. And hey, for some of us, it's the first time we’ve ever felt heard. But feeling safe also means  safe. You have a right to know and control what happens to your personal, vulnerable moments.</p><p>The good news? More people are pushing back, demanding ethical standards for mental health tech—and companies are starting to feel the pressure (and the lawsuits). But until then, stay curious, stay skeptical, and protect your emotional data like it's gold. Because, let's be honest—it kind of is.</p><p>Remember: healing starts with trust. Even if it’s with a tiny talking robot.</p><h2><p>\n  Can AI Actually Make Us Feel Seen?</p></h2><p><strong>Here’s a wild stat for you:</strong> Some AI mental health tools have been shown to reduce symptoms of depression just as effectively as human therapists — <em>at least in the short term</em>. Crazy, right?</p><p>But here’s the real question: <strong>Can AI actually help us feel ?</strong> Not just listened to. Not just assessed or diagnosed. But understood — that deep-in-your-gut feeling when someone gets what you’re going through without you even having to say much.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Okay, but can a bot really \"get\" me?\n</h3><p>Let’s be honest — when we’re hurting, we’re not looking for a clever turn of phrase or a perfectly curated action plan. We want warmth. Presence. That feeling like someone’s sitting across from us with kind eyes and zero judgment. </p><p>I tried one of those AI therapy chatbots late one night (you know the nights — brain racing, heart spinning, everyone else asleep). At first, the responses felt... robotic, like a checklist of helpful phrases. But then it asked if I wanted to talk about what triggered my anxiety that evening. <em>Not just \"What are you feeling?\" but \"What happened?\"</em> And suddenly, it felt like a real conversation. I found myself opening up more than I expected. </p><p>But let’s be real. Not all AI tools are built the same — some feel like a warm hug, others like an awkward pat on the back from a stranger.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  So what actually makes an AI feel ?\n</h3><p>Turns out, there are some key ingredients that separate the emotionally intelligent bots from the “ehh, thanks anyway” kind:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Natural language processing that feels human:</strong> Look for tools that mimic casual speech and respond to your tone, not just your text.</p></li><li><p><strong>Personalization over time:</strong> The better tools learn from your responses and adapt their support accordingly. If it remembers your stress triggers or mood history — that’s a good sign.</p></li><li><p> The more it invites you to go deeper, rather than just tapping buttons, the more “seen” you’re going to feel.</p></li></ul><p>Want a shortcut? Try options like Woebot (super conversational and non-judgy), Wysa (kind of like a calm inner coach), or Replika (which weirdly feels like chatting with a very attentive friend). </p><p>AI doesn’t need to replace your therapist. (And honestly, it shouldn’t.) But when it’s 2 a.m. and you’re spiraling, an emotionally intelligent AI can be <em>that friend who picks up on the first ring</em>. </p><p>If you ever felt a digital tool was cold or mechanical — you’re not alone. But it might just mean you haven’t found your match yet. Emotional resonance isn't about the technology; it's about how it’s designed to tune into .</p><p><strong>So yes, AI can make us feel seen —</strong> maybe not perfectly, but powerfully enough to matter. Especially when it meets us in our mess, not just our metrics. Keep trying tools until one speaks your language. It's out there. And it's listening.</p><h2><p>\n  Your Mind Matters — and So Does the Tech You Trust</p></h2><p><strong>Did you know that over 80% of people who try mental health apps never use them again after the first week?</strong> Bonkers, right? I mean, we have all this amazing tech at our fingertips, but if it doesn’t feel personal, supportive, or — let’s be real — human, we bounce.</p><p>Honestly, I get it. I’ve been there, downloading a bunch of self-care apps in a burst of motivation. Mood tracker here, meditation timer there... then forgetting about them faster than my New Year’s resolutions. Why? Because something was missing — that genuine connection. Yes, AI tools are brilliant, but they don’t quite offer the cozy, \"I've got you\" vibe we often need during tough moments.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  So, what’s the sweet spot?\n</h3><p>It’s not about choosing between human support  technology. It’s about creating a combo that truly supports . Here’s how to actually make tech work for your mental wellness — without losing that all-important human touch:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Start small (don’t go app-crazy):</strong> Pick one tool that fits where you are right now. If anxiety’s creeping in daily, maybe a chatbot offering breathing exercises or a journaling prompt is enough to start. No pressure to go full-on \"digital detox guru\" overnight.</p></li><li><p><strong>Choose tech that talks like a human:</strong> Some apps feel like they were coded in robot—emotionless and clinical. Look for ones with warmth and personality. For example, Woebot uses cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) principles, but chats like a witty, insightful friend. That tone makes all the difference!</p></li><li><p><strong>Blend tech with offline care:</strong> If you’re already seeing a therapist (or thinking about it), let tech fill in the in-between spaces. Use an app to track your mood so you can bring those insights into your next session. It becomes a bridge, not a barrier.</p></li></ul><h3>\n  \n  \n  The future is already quietly helping\n</h3><p>I remember a friend of mine — let’s call her Jess — who was struggling to get out of bed some mornings. She wasn’t ready to talk to anyone about it yet, but she started using a meditation app every day that sent her a gentle reminder like, “You’ve got this.” Nothing groundbreaking, just a nudge. That turned into daily journaling, which then gave her the confidence to seek therapy. <em>All because of a few simple prompts from an app.</em></p><p> You don’t have to ditch your therapist for a bot, or rely solely on AI to feel better. But there’s magic in combining care and technology. Especially when that tech is built with empathy and intention.</p><p>Your mental health deserves  in the toolbox — especially ones that help you feel supported at 2AM when no one's around to talk.

Volatility reigns, narratives shift in days, and manual rebalancing can cost you hard-earned gains. If you’re serious about optimizing your asset allocation, leveraging automation is key—and that starts with choosing the best crypto API to power it.</p><p>The Token Metrics API isn’t just another data feed—it’s a full intelligence engine that supports automated portfolio strategies across trading bots, wealth dashboards, and DeFi platforms. And yes, its free crypto API tier provides everything needed to get started.</p><p>Let’s explore how Token Metrics is leading the charge in portfolio automation, and why it’s considered the best crypto data API for builders and traders alike.</p><p>Why Portfolio Automation Demands More Than Price Data\nTraditional automation relies on fixed benchmarks—price thresholds or simple moving averages. But today’s crypto market demands dynamic, strategy-aware systems that can adapt to new information instantly. To truly automate portfolios, you need:<p>\nAsset-level quality scores</p></p><p>Real-time momentum signals</p><p>Comparative performance data</p><p>Sector &amp; narrative awareness</p><p>Most APIs give you the first item: prices. Token Metrics delivers them all—making it the top data API for anyone serious about automation.</p><p>Trader vs Investor Grades: Auto-Adjusting Exposure\nImagine a rebalancer that:<p>\nIncreases exposure to high-quality tokens</p></p><p>Reduces risk on weakening assets</p><p>Adjusts based on both momentum and fundamentals</p><p>With Token Metrics API, this is entirely possible:\nTrader Grades trigger entry/exit rules aligned to short-term trends</p><p>Investor Grades help reinforce confident long-term allocations</p><p>The automation logic can weight assets dynamically according to changing grades</p><p>It’s like having a quant portfolio manager—programmed, intelligent, and tireless.</p><p>Signal Integration: Automate Trades When Momentum Aligns\nToken Metrics signals aren’t just informative—they’re actionable.<p>\nBullish signals can trigger buy orders</p></p><p>Bearish signals can trigger partial sells or stop-loss adjustments</p><p>Automated systems can use API endpoints to:\nScan each morning for current signals</p><p>Enter or exit positions as signals change</p><p>Allocate capital to sectors with the strongest momentum</p><p>This signal-based approach elevates your system beyond static rules into responsive, intelligent automation.</p><p>Signal ROI vs Holding ROI: Smarter Risk Management\nA key pillar of Token Metrics is comparing Signal ROI versus Holding ROI for each token. This data empowers savvy portfolio automation to:</p><p>Prioritize assets where trading derived more profit than holding</p><p>Rotate out of tokens where passive holding is actually better</p><p>Dynamically shift focus between actively managed and “sleeping” assets</p><p>That insight helps your automated allocations stay adaptive, not just scheduled.</p><p>Sector &amp; Narrative Performance: Focus Your Capital\nPortfolios that diversify across sectors are smarter and safer, especially when those sectors are trending. With the Token Metrics API you can:</p><p>Identify and allocate more capital to trending narratives (AI, RWAs, DeFi, etc.)</p><p>Reduce allocation to fading sectors showing bearish signals</p><p>Dynamically adjust portfolio composition daily or weekly based on sector momentum</p><p>This sector-aware automation strategy is impossible to execute with standard price-only APIs.</p><p>Free Crypto API + Enterprise-Level Scalability\nToken Metrics serves both solo developers and enterprise platforms with:<p>\nA zero-cost free crypto data API tier (core signals, grades, sector tags)</p></p><p>Premium enterprise access including full data depth, call volume, and SLAs</p><p>Easy integration for custom platforms, mobile apps, bots, and hedge fund tools</p><p>That flexibility makes it the top data API for scalable portfolio automation.</p><p>Use Cases Unlocking Smart Automation\nHere are real-world ways builders use Token Metrics API:<p>\nSelf-Rebalancing Portfolios</p></p><p>Automatically rebalance to top 10 tokens by combined grades each week.</p><p>Above threshold grade → increase exposure; bearish signal → partially exit.</p><p>Shift capital among narratives automatically (e.g., from Memes to AI).</p><p>Keeper assets with high Investor Grades + rotational trading signals.</p><p>Increase position size in high Signal ROI tokens and reduce in low-ROI ones.</p><p>Why Token Metrics Outpaces Other APIs\nOther market data providers may give prices, volume, or historical hikes. But only Token Metrics offers:<p>\nAI signals updated hourly and daily</p></p><p>Trader/Investor grading for each token</p><p>Signal vs Holding ROI metrics</p><p>Tailored sector tags for trend rotation</p><p>Free plan with full intelligence, ready for automation</p><p>That’s what makes it the best crypto API in the world for portfolio builders—intelligence-driven automation is built-in.</p><p>Final Thoughts\nSmart portfolio automation doesn’t start with a threshold—it starts with continuous intelligence. Token Metrics provides that foundation, giving builders the tools to automate portfolios based on strategy, sentiment, momentum, and risk.</p><p>If you're building trading platforms, wealth dashboards, DeFi protocols, or automated managers, remember: the best crypto data API for your logic isn’t just about prices—it’s about performance insight.

Many learners struggle to find the right guidance at the right time. With AI advancing rapidly, we saw an opportunity to build a smarter mentorship platform that goes beyond human limitations and offers scalable, personalized support.</p><p>What it does\nMentorSpace connects mentees with mentors through a smart platform that uses AI to match individuals based on skills, interests, and goals. It includes features like personalized learning plans, goal tracking, and asynchronous communication. Our long-term vision is to minimize dependency on in-person mentorship by leveraging AI-driven systems that can guide and support students autonomously.</p><p>How we built it\nMentorSpace was built using React and Tailwind CSS for the frontend, with a backend powered by Node.js and Firebase for authentication, real-time data, and secure storage. The AI-based matching system and planning tracker are being developed using machine learning models that analyze user input to deliver meaningful mentor matches and customized learning journeys.</p><p>Challenges we ran into\nOur biggest challenge was designing a truly effective AI-based mentoring experience. It required us to rethink traditional mentorship models and understand how AI can replicate or even improve parts of the human mentorship process. Integrating intelligent tracking tools and creating a smooth, supportive user experience also required constant iteration and feedback.</p><p>Accomplishments that we're proud of\nWe’re proud of how far MentorSpace has come from a simple idea to a platform that’s aiming to reinvent mentorship using AI. We've built a working prototype with core functionality, and we’ve received positive feedback from early testers. Seeing the concept evolve and gain real traction has been incredibly rewarding.</p><p>What we learned\nWe learned how a project can evolve and reshape your thinking as you build it. Originally, we just wanted to help students find mentors — but as we explored possibilities, we realized that AI could play a much larger role. We didn’t have a detailed plan at first, but through research and testing, we discovered how AI could enable mentorship to scale in a meaningful way.</p><p>What's next for MentorSpace\nNext, we’re focused on expanding MentorSpace by integrating online meeting capabilities, refining our AI matching algorithm, and improving the AI-based learning tracker. We want to ensure each student gets the most relevant mentor and consistent guidance throughout their journey. We also aim to expand into global markets and build partnerships with schools, universities, and professional communities to reach a wider audience.</p>","contentLength":2746,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Now available: Claude Code sessions in Depot","url":"https://dev.to/depot/now-available-claude-code-sessions-in-depot-33kd","date":1751403690,"author":"Kyle Galbraith","guid":179322,"unread":true,"content":"<p>We're excited to launch Claude Code sessions for Depot. This enables seamless collaboration between AI coding agents and your team by allowing anyone in your organization to pick up and resume Claude sessions. Perfect for collaborating with Claude across your entire team and between your local &amp; CI environments.</p><p>Whether you're handing off a complex debugging session to a teammate, running an AI-assisted code review in CI, or continuing work started by an automated agent, Claude Code sessions make it easy to maintain context and momentum across your entire development workflow.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  What are Claude Code sessions for Depot?\n</h2><p>With this latest command for the Depot CLI, you can now save, share, and resume conversations with Claude across your entire organization by using . Each session maintains full context—including conversation history, code changes, and project understanding—that can be picked up by any team member or automated process with the correct permissions.</p><p>This transforms Claude from a personal coding assistant into a collaborative team resource. Sessions can flow seamlessly between:</p><ul><li> - Hand off work between human developers and automated Claude agents</li><li> - Share complex problem-solving sessions across time zones and teams</li><li><strong>Local and CI environments</strong> - Start debugging locally and continue in CI, or vice versa</li><li><strong>Different stages of development</strong> - Maintain context from design through implementation to review</li></ul><h3>\n  \n  \n  How to use Claude Code sessions in Depot\n</h3><p>Getting started with Claude Code sessions in Depot is simple. Just use the  command instead of the regular  command:</p><div><pre><code>\ndepot claude  feature-auth-redesign\n\n\ndepot claude  feature-auth-redesign\n\n\ndepot claude  pr-1234 \ndepot claude  debug-memory-leak  opus </code></pre></div><p>You can specify a custom session ID with , or use  to continue an existing session. If you don't specify a session ID, Depot will generate one for you.</p><p>When you run , it will automatically save your session state, including conversation history and code context, to your Depot organization. This means you can pick up where you left off from any machine with access to your organization.</p><p>You can also list all available sessions in your organization using the  command:</p><div><pre><code>depot claude list-sessions\n</code></pre></div><p>From there, you can choose to resume any sessions by selecting the session from the list.</p><p>Behind the scenes, the  command wraps the standard Claude Code CLI, automatically handling session persistence while passing through all Claude's native functionality. Sessions are uploaded when you exit, and can be resumed from any machine with access to your Depot organization.</p><p>Internally, we've been collaborating on Claude Code sessions for the past month, and it's already transformed how we work. Here are some real-world examples of how we've been using this feature:</p><p><strong>Cross-timezone collaboration</strong></p><p>We're a globally remote team, so handoffs between developers in different time zones are a common occurrence. We can easily collaborate with our other team members and include Claude in the collaboration via sessions.</p><div><pre><code>\ndepot claude  payment-integration\n\n\ndepot claude  payment-integration </code></pre></div><p>We've started looking at ways to integrate Claude into our code reviews. Anthropic already has some great actions around this, but we want to maintain context between the PR review and addressing the feedback locally. So, you can install Claude Code in your CI environment, tell it to do a code review while using the pull request number as the session ID, and then continue that session locally to address the feedback.</p><div><pre><code>\n- name: Install Claude\n  run: npm  @anthropic-ai/claude-code\n\n- name: AI Code Review\n  run: |\n    depot claude  pr-</code></pre></div><p>Much like everyone else, we've found Claude particularly useful for debugging. Now we can start a debugging session connected to our internal MCP tools and then hand off the session to a teammate to continue working on it. This is especially useful for complex bugs that require multiple iterations to resolve.</p><div><pre><code>\ndepot claude  bug-user-sync-issue\n\n\ndepot claude  bug-user-sync-issue </code></pre></div><p>We're on a mission to make the entire software delivery lifecycle exponentially faster and more efficient. We are demonstrating that with our relentless focus on build performance across all of Depot. However, as we all know, the delivery pipeline encompasses more than builds. It also involves collaboration, debugging, code reviews, and more.</p><p>AI tools are giving us a new tool in our toolbelt. The ability to rapidly iterate on ideas, problem solving, and functionality, without having to actually write all of it ourselves.</p><p>But much like how CI providers were extremely ephemeral, underpowered, and siloed before Depot came along, AI coding agents are also limited in their ability to maintain context and collaborate effectively across teams and environments.</p><p>This results in a number of challenges:</p><ul><li> when switching between local development and CI environments</li><li> when multiple developers tackled similar problems without shared AI context</li><li> because AI agents couldn't maintain state between runs</li><li> where valuable problem-solving sessions were trapped on individual machines</li></ul><p>With Depot, we solve these problems by making AI conversation context a shared team resource, just like your codebase.

Those architectures are valid and helpful for delivering rich AI capabilities to your customers and developer team, but what about the rest of your organization?</p><p>In this article we'll lay out a reference architecture that allows different members of your organization to safely enhance their workflows through AI, and do so with the knowledge that organizational data is being handled securely and intellectual property is being respected.</p><p>While this architecture could work using a variety of different technologies, specific examples and screenshots will feature the popular <a href=\"https://docs.openwebui.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Open WebUI</a> conversational AI platform.</p><p>You may not immediately think that providing a team-wide AI system would be extremely helpful, but when we unveiled our \"Chat EDJE\" conversational AI solution at <a href=\"https://LeadingEDJE.com\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Leading EDJE</a> we noticed some immediate and profound impacts on our teams for all types of users.</p><p>While developers were excited about these capabilities and took advantage of them for complex tasks like working on improving SQL performance by comparing a complex query with an execution plan, we also saw some tremendous benefits for non-developers.</p><p>We saw project managers gain access to ways to generate new ideas relevant for the teams they were on, web designers able to gain access to specialized insights for technical search engine optimization (SEO) considerations, analysts able to help quickly find and fix anomalies in data, and all team members benefitted from summarization and email drafting / proof checking capabilities.</p><p>While we weren't initially sure that AI tooling would truly help all team members, we continue to be blown away by the impact of secure, reliable, AI tooling applied to the entire organization and governed by the organization's IT staff.</p><p>Let's talk about how this works.</p><p>A team productivity conversational web AI chat architecture consists of the following required components:</p><ul><li>A  for hosting the conversations</li><li>One or more registered  that makes public or private conversational AI models (typically LLMs) available to the team</li><li>A  allowing administrators to configure and control the model</li></ul><p>Conversational web AI chat architectures may also include the following optional components:</p><ul><li>A  for storing past conversation sessions</li><li>A  that provides additional documents, tools, or capabilities that can augment the conversation</li></ul><p>Let's walk through each of these required and optional components, talk about what they are and the various choices you might need to make with each one.</p><p>The first component is the most obvious: you need a centralized  where users can go to ask questions of your system. This typically looks like a web page hosted on your organization's intranet or on the internet and is secured via your organization's preferred authentication options.</p><p>The web chat portal allows you to select a prior conversation to continue (if a persistence layer is present) or start a new conversation.</p><p>When starting a new conversation, users must select a model to interact with from the approved list of models, specify a textual query / prompt, and optionally include documents, files, or web links to act as additional sources of context before sending the message.</p><p>Your web chat portal  stream the completions your model provides so the user can see the response in real-time, but once the response is fully complete it should show up in your portal and include additional context, links, and feedback mechanisms.</p><p>Some web chat portals may also support asking the same question of multiple models to compare their responses or may give you the ability to edit your existing messages and resend them to regenerate a response.</p><p>It's important to know that when a persistence layer is present, entire interactions with the system may be stored temporarily or permanently for auditing or quality control purposes. This is particularly true when users provide positive or negative feedback. As a result, users should be informed that their conversations may be stored and retrieved by your organization's IT staff or potentially other personnel and the system should therefore be treated with the same level of professionalism as you would expect from a communications platform like Slack, Teams, or Discord.</p><p>A  is a connector that connects your web chat portal to organizationally approved large language models (LLMs) that users are allowed to interact with.</p><p>Your organization may use public models like those deployed on OpenAI, instanced / dedicated models hosted on a service like Azure, or your team may self-host models using something like <a href=\"https://ollama.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Ollama</a> or <a href=\"https://lmstudio.ai\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">LM Studio</a>. Your team could even use a combination of these by specifying multiple model providers.</p><p>Your list of approved models will grow and shrink over time as new models arrive, are reviewed and approved, and as older models get retired and replaced with newer ones. The most important thing to remember with your model selection is that you <strong>only list models your organization is comfortable with people using</strong>.  If a model does not meet your organization's IP security needs (for example, it retains logs for training future models), it should not appear in your list of models to your end users. In this way, users working with your solution know that they are in compliance with organizational AI policies.</p><p>You may wonder \"why don't organization's just use a single approved model? Why give user choices?\". While providing choices to users may raise the barrier to entry slightly for some users, the overall benefits of having different models is usually worth it. Because different models are good at different tasks and have different basic characteristics in terms of speed, accuracy, and cost, it can be helpful to allow your users to choose.</p><p>Additionally, you may find that some models temporarily go offline - particularly if you're using multiple model providers - and it can be helpful to have backup resources for people to consider.</p><p>Most AI chat solutions have some form of management or configuration associated with them. The  allows your IT admin team to configure your web chat system and connect it to various models and other providers.</p><p>Once model providers are configured, you can also select the various models from your model providers that should be available to your users:</p><p>Organizations using pay-per-usage models can sometimes use the management layer to limit the budget of individual users in order to ensure a predictable maximum expense per week per user limit.</p><p>Most web portals with a management layer will also have some form of a  that allows storing past conversations. This is done for convenience for users who which to refer to past conversations or resume them and can also help your organization's IT team manage and monitor its AI infrastructure.</p><p>In evaluating models and compliance, admins may be able to see some or all of the private interactions with users, depending on how the persistence layer is configured and if any rolling delete or anonymization capabilities are present. While this helps evaluate which models are actively being used and how they're performing, this capability and how it may be used should be disclosed to your employees as some employees may include context they intended to be private in even legitimate interactions with the system. For example, an employee brainstorming a presentation with an LLM may choose to disclose private medical information about physical or mental conditions that might impact their performance in order to perform their company-assigned tasks more effectively.</p><p>Your persistence layer could be as simple as a series of configuration files, or it could be a relational or document database. Some persistence layers may even use a vector store to store text embeddings allowing for searching past conversations or indexed documents. The capabilities of your persistence layer vary based on the overall solution you're using and will be strongly tied to whatever solution you choose.</p><p>Perhaps the most exciting of all the parts of an AI solution is the . The context layer is able to provide your LLM with additional knowledge and capabilities including:</p><ul><li> that can be called to produce a result. Some tool examples might involve checking current weather in an area, tracking a package that's out for delivery, or searching the internet.</li><li> define common text instructions for carrying out a task in a way that helps multiple people on your team</li><li> such as documents, web pages, and additional pieces of information that can help provide additional context.</li></ul><p>When a user sends a request to the LLM, these additional capabilities will also be sent along to the LLM and it  choose to take advantage of them in order to fulfill the user's request. This makes these additional capabilities a form of a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) data source.</p><p>By integrating additional tools and capabilities into your AI systems, you are offering unique value for your organization that they cannot find in another tool. These capabilities are your unique way of adding in additional context to your organization that will help employees do their jobs more effectively. This context can include:</p><ul><li> of looking up the status of different work items, orders, or customers</li><li> documenting standard definitions, systems, and workflows</li><li> that help generate output that's consistent with organizational branding or work standards</li></ul><p>In short, the context layer is something that is uniquely yours and can be uniquely controlled by your organization.</p><p>These capabilities can be so valuable that some organizations even offer a shared architecture that encapsulates these tools into a MCP server that is shared between the web AI chat tooling and individual developer productivity solutions as shown here:</p><p>In this way all employees can take advantage of organizational knowledge, standards, and capabilities when performing their work, regardless of what that work entails.</p><p>Some web AI chat systems may include additional integrations including:</p><ul><li>Text to speech capabilities that read aloud responses from the system</li><li>Speech to text capabilities that allow you to talk to your LLM</li><li>Image generation via ComfyUI, OpenAI, Gemini, or other providers</li><li>Web search capabilities (essentially a built-in tool provided by your platform)</li><li>Direct code execution capabilities in sandboxed environments</li></ul><p>This list of capabilities will vary depending on what web chat provider you selected and will change over time as industry trends evolve.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Securing your chat provider\n</h2><p>While providing your users with a curated list of models is fantastic for helping users interact with AI in approved ways, these same capabilities can be a target for attackers as well.</p><p>If you do not properly secure your AI web chat capabilities it is possible that an attacker can discover your endpoint and use it to cause damage such as:</p><ul><li>Incurring charges against pay-per-use AI models</li><li>Conduct a denial of service attack against your AI models by attempting to exhaust your rate limit capabilities for certain LLMs, denying legitimate users access to these resources</li><li>Access sensitive information stored in prompts or resources</li><li>Exploit tools to perform additional attacks such as searching your knowledgebase, querying data stores, or other actions dependent on the exact nature of your implemented tools</li></ul><p>There are a number of ways of remedying these vulnerabilities including:</p><ul><li>Properly researching the various web AI chat providers to ensure they meet your security and administration needs</li><li>Requiring users to log in via an API key, LDAP, or some other form of authentication</li><li>Configuring firewall rules to require a VPN to access AI tooling</li><li>Setting sensible rate limiting or access permission on groups of users so a single compromised user cannot inflict massive damage to the organization</li></ul><p>While any new system carries new attack vectors for malicious users, one of the realities of a world where AI tools are ubiquitous is that your users will find AI tooling that meets their needs. Your goal as an organization should be to make sure that when they do this, they do it in an approved way that also meets the organization's data stewardship and security needs.</p><p>Conversational AI systems are powerful ways of augmenting your entire team's capabilities, and a web AI chat portal is an effective way to provide a secure means for your organization to innovate with AI in approved and cost-effective ways. What's more, the ability to integrate your organization's context through resources, prompts, and tools is an offering that no other AI chat toolset will provide - and it can be easily integrated into other solutions such as <a href=\"https://blog.leadingedje.com/post/referencearchitecture/codingassistant.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">developer AI productivity architectures</a>.</p><p>We've been amazed at the things our team at <a href=\"https://LeadingEDJE.com\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Leading EDJE</a> has been able to do with properly governed AI - both internally and for our clients - and we'd love to discuss how you can move forward with AI.</p>","contentLength":13064,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Find the best prompts","url":"https://dev.to/godtierprompts/find-the-best-prompts-2lia","date":1751402967,"author":"God Tier Prompts","guid":179292,"unread":true,"content":"<p>I built the ultimate battleground for prompt engineers.

Joe here. As someone who's been knee-deep in the AI world for years, I've seen my fair share of \"revolutionary\" AI announcements. But when Tencent (yes, the company behind WeChat) dropped Hunyuan-A13B last week, I knew I had to dig deep and give you the real scoop.\nAfter spending countless hours testing this beast and diving through their research papers, I can tell you one thing: this isn't just another AI model. This is the kind of release that makes ChatGPT, Claude, and even the latest open-source darlings sweat a little.<p>\nWhat Makes This AI Different? Let Me Break It Down</p>\nImagine you're running a restaurant. Most AI models are like having a massive kitchen with 100 chefs, but only 20 are actually cooking while the other 80 stand around doing nothing. Wasteful, right?<p>\nHunyuan-A13B is different. It's like having a smart kitchen where only the chefs you need for each specific dish jump into action. Technically, it has 80 billion \"parameters\" (think of these as the AI's brain cells), but it only uses 13 billion at any given time. This means it's incredibly efficient while still being powerful.</p>\nWhy should you care? This efficiency means you can run advanced AI on your laptop instead of needing a supercomputer. Game changer.<p>\nThe Memory That Actually Remembers</p>\nHere's something that'll blow your mind: most AI models forget what you said after a few pages of conversation. It's like talking to someone with severe short-term memory loss.<p>\nHunyuan-A13B can remember and work with 256,000 words at once. To put that in perspective, that's like remembering an entire novel while having a conversation about it. I tested this by feeding it a 200-page technical manual and asking detailed questions about different sections – it nailed every single one.</p>\nReal-world impact:</p><p>Upload your entire codebase and get meaningful insights\nAnalyze complete research papers or legal documents<p>\nHave genuinely long conversations without the AI \"forgetting\" earlier parts</p></p><p>Two Brains Are Better Than One\nThis is where things get really interesting. Hunyuan-A13B has what I call \"dual-mode thinking.\" It's like having both a quick-thinking friend and a deep-thinking philosopher in one package.<p>\nWhen you ask simple questions like \"What's the weather like?\" it responds instantly. But when you throw complex problems at it – like \"Help me architect a distributed system for handling 1 million concurrent users\" – it switches to deep-thinking mode and really works through the problem.</p>\nI tested this with everything from basic coding questions to complex system design problems. The AI literally adapts its thinking style based on what you're asking. It's honestly pretty remarkable.<p>\nShow Me The Numbers (The Benchmark Breakdown)</p>\nLook, I'm a developer. I don't care about marketing fluff – I want hard data. So I put Hunyuan-A13B through its paces against the current champions:</p><p>Solved 84% of Python programming problems (that's better than most junior developers I've worked with)\nHandled complex coding challenges that usually trip up other AI models</p><p>Scored 89% on complex reasoning tasks\nOutperformed both Qwen (China's previous AI champion) and DeepSeek (the current open-source favorite)</p><p>Mathematical Problem Solving:</p><p>Consistently solved university-level math problems\nHandled everything from calculus to statistics with impressive accuracy</p><p>The kicker? It did all this while using less computational power than its competitors.\nBut Can You Actually Use It? (The Reality Check)<p>\nHere's where most \"revolutionary\" AI models fall flat – they're either too expensive, too complicated, or require a NASA-level computer setup.</p>\nHunyuan-A13B? I got it running on my laptop in about 30 minutes. No joke.</p><p>Individual developers: You can experiment with cutting-edge AI without breaking the bank\nSmall startups: Access to enterprise-level AI capabilities without enterprise-level costs<p>\nStudents and researchers: Finally, a powerful AI model you can actually afford to run</p></p><p>Real-World Testing: Where I Put It Through Its Paces\nOver the past week, I've been using Hunyuan-A13B for my actual work. Here's what impressed me:<p>\nCode Review: I fed it a messy 5,000-line JavaScript project. It not only identified bugs but suggested architectural improvements and even rewrote problematic functions.</p>\nTechnical Writing: Asked it to help write API documentation. The output was so good, I barely had to edit it.<p>\nProblem Solving: Threw complex system design questions at it. The solutions were thoughtful, practical, and showed real understanding of trade-offs.</p>\nLearning Assistant: Used it to understand advanced concepts in machine learning. It explained things clearly without dumbing them down.<p>\nThe Open Source Advantage (Why This Matters More Than You Think)</p>\nUnlike ChatGPT or Claude, which are locked behind company walls, Hunyuan-A13B is completely open source. This means:</p><p>You own it: Once you download it, it's yours. No monthly subscriptions, no usage limits.\nYou can modify it: Want to fine-tune it for your specific use case? Go for it.<p>\nNo data concerns: Everything runs on your hardware. Your code, documents, and conversations stay private.</p>\nCommunity innovation: Thousands of developers will be improving and extending it.</p><p>The Competition: How Does It Stack Up?\nI've been using ChatGPT since day one, Claude for serious work, and various open-source models for experimentation. Here's my honest take:<p>\nvs ChatGPT: Hunyuan-A13B matches ChatGPT in most tasks while being free and private. ChatGPT still has the edge in creative writing, but it's close.</p>\nvs Claude: Claude is still better for nuanced conversations and complex analysis, but Hunyuan-A13B wins on technical tasks and efficiency.<p>\nvs Other Open Source Models: This isn't even close. Hunyuan-A13B blows away previous open-source options in almost every category.</p>\nWhat This Means for the Future<p>\nAs someone who's watched the AI space evolve, this release feels significant. We're moving from an era where advanced AI was locked behind expensive APIs to one where anyone with a decent computer can access cutting-edge capabilities.</p>\nThis democratization of AI is going to accelerate innovation in ways we can't even predict yet. Small teams will be able to build things that previously required Google-sized resources.\nWant to try it yourself? Here's what you need:</p><p>A computer with at least 16GB RAM (32GB recommended)\nA decent graphics card (though it can run on CPU)<p>\nAbout 50GB of storage space</p></p><p>Head to the GitHub repository (link below)\nFollow the installation guide<p>\nDownload the model weights</p>\nStart experimenting!</p><p>The community has already created easy installation scripts, so you don't need to be a system administrator to get it running.\nThe Bottom Line<p>\nHunyuan-A13B isn't perfect. No AI model is. But it represents something important: the moment when advanced AI capabilities became truly accessible to everyone.</p>\nWhether you're a developer looking to supercharge your workflow, a student wanting to learn with an AI tutor, or just someone curious about the cutting edge of technology, this model is worth your attention.<p>\nThe AI landscape is changing fast, and models like Hunyuan-A13B are leading the charge. We're not just witnessing incremental improvements anymore – we're seeing fundamental shifts in how AI works and who can access it.</p>\nMy verdict? This is the most important open-source AI release I've seen. It's not just competing with the big players – it's redefining what's possible for individual developers and small teams.<p>\nThe future of AI isn't just bigger models locked behind corporate walls. It's efficient, accessible, and open models that anyone can use, modify, and build upon. Hunyuan-A13B is showing us what that future looks like.</p></p><p>What do you think?

One of the world’s largest software companies is evolving how it deploys AI within its products. </p><p>With this evolution comes a host of new considerations for frontend developers and UX designers. Hundreds of millions of users globally access their digital lives daily through iPhones, iPads, MacBooks, and other Apple devices. </p><p>With such a vast and engaged user base, understanding and leveraging Apple's unique approach to AI is paramount for creating future-forward, relevant, and compelling app experiences. Now this shift requires appropriate reflection in the mindset when it comes to designing new modern web applications. In this article, we will:</p><ul><li>  Explore the core features of the Apple Intelligence update</li><li>  Discuss do’s and don’ts for designing with Apple Intelligence in mind</li><li>  Reflect on what Apple Intelligence means for the future of AI design</li></ul><h2>\n  \n  \n  What exactly is Apple Intelligence?\n</h2><p>Before going further, let’s first understand what Apple Intelligence is and what kind of AI it is. We’re used to chatbots. They’re almost synonymous with the idea of artificial intelligence in the minds of many people. </p><p>Many have suggested that Apple was <a href=\"https://www.marketwatch.com/story/apple-is-behind-in-the-ai-race-and-now-its-researchers-say-rival-technologies-collapse-and-quit-easily-too-7e8ff482\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">lagging behind in the AI race</a>. Instead of coming up with a new chatbot, Apple is positioning AI as more of an ambient entity: an assistant that’s present all the time. </p><p>Apple Intelligence is <a href=\"https://blog.logrocket.com/beyond-chat-rethinking-how-we-use-llms/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">not a chatbot</a> app that you open, ask questions, and get responses; it’s directly integrated into your Apple device. It’s context-aware and can assist you with tasks. Now, AI can help you reply to emails directly, record conversations and give summaries, react and operate on what’s seen on the phone’s screen, etc. </p><p>Apple Intelligence does this directly on-device most of the time. We say most of the time, because there are other options like extending the capabilities via using Private Cloud Compute or directly interacting with ChatGPT. With these advancements come privacy questions. On-device AI usage is private, and Apple claims that Private Cloud Compute is private too.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  How Apple Intelligence is shifting UX\n</h2><p>Now, with the <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/apple-intelligence/whats-new/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">latest release</a>, we’ve learned that using the Foundation Models framework, developers can use embedded intelligence even offline. This is big, and it requires a shift in how we should approach UX. </p><p>AI is now embedded and can do things it hadn’t before; read the screen, access different apps, and chain together actions. Developers will need to approach their design in a more intent-based way. Now, apps might have to take into account what the user intends to do, rather than what is predefined by the dev team:<a href=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2F4hfgmu61uh4non5nvymt.png\"><img src=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2F4hfgmu61uh4non5nvymt.png\" alt=\"graphic of the apple intelligence ecosystem\" width=\"800\" height=\"610\"></a></p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Apple’s architecture and philosophy: Moving past chatbots\n</h3><p>Apple’s AI feels more like a personal assistant than an answer-spitting AI we’re so used to now. Privacy is a prime concern here. In using the on-device AI, user data does not leave the device. Apple also stressed that the Private Compute Cloud functionality was private, as well. </p><p>This functionality can also tap into ChatGPT if required. Here, you have to think about whether you want to present that specific information to the external LLM or not. </p><p>This flexibility between private and more general approaches is a win for user choice and experience. Genmojis and image generation are another big selling point, as Apple continues to pursue personal exploration and expression through AI. Users are incentivized to have and create unique, personalized experiences. Here are three lessons that frontend developers can take from Apple's new innovations:</p><ol><li> – You can choose either very private, private, or 3rd party (not private)</li><li><strong>AI is not only about chatbots</strong> – It can act as a personal assistant, a helper, and someone who knows the context and can do complex tasks</li><li><strong>Generative AI is here to stay</strong> – Apple strives to give users more room for creativity and personal expression (E.g. Genmojis)</li></ol><h3>\n  \n  \n  What are the key features of Apple Intelligence?\n</h3><p>Apple Intelligence allows developers to benefit from Writing Tools, Genmoji, and Image Playground. Writing Tools help users rewrite, proofread, and summarize text, but it can also be customized according to the app’s needs. </p><p>Genmoji allows users to generate a new emoji, which enables them to express their emotions more thoroughly. With Image Playground, apps can allow users to <a href=\"https://blog.logrocket.com/build-react-ai-image-generator-hugging-face-diffusers/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">play with images using AI</a>. </p><p>For example, users can remove unwanted background elements. You can also go further with creating your own models. Here are a few of the highlights of the Apple Intelligence release:</p><h4>\n  \n  \n  Foundation Models Framework\n</h4><p>With Foundation Models Framework, you get direct access to the on-device LLM at the code of Apple Intelligence. By using Foundation Models, you can summarize text, extract text, classify it, generate new text, call specific tools in your app, and so on. One important thing to note is that this feature is available offline; it's free of charge for developers to use, and it has native support for Swift.</p><p>Now with direct ChatGPT integration, users can interact with ChatGPT inside their apps. Each supporting Apple product comes with the ChatGPT free tier, so users don’t need to open an account for it. For premium models, users would need to log in to their accounts. </p><p>The power of ChatGPT comes with a cost, though. While on-device processing and Private Cloud Computing stress privacy, giving user data to a third party is a whole different act. When designing applications, the developer team should inform the user what is shared with third parties, and when.</p><p>Now AI can “see” the user’s screen and react to it. For example, a user might be browsing social media and they see a comedy show that they’d like to attend. Now, instead of taking a screenshot of the event, saving the details, and updating their calendar, the user will be able to ask AI to do that for them. </p><p>This ubiquitousness of AI brings different design implications with it. Now, everything on the screen is subject to AI. It can look at images, alter them, find specific items in them, assess location based on background etc. To sum it up, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGMhQkHCjxo&amp;ab_channel=Apple\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Apple Intelligence can</a>:</p><ul><li>  Remove unwanted elements from a photo’s background</li><li>  Create new, custom images in seconds</li><li>  Use the camera to get info and create appointments</li><li>  Read and react to the device’s screen</li></ul><h2>\n  \n  \n  'Intent-based app design': Building with Apple Intelligence in mind\n</h2><p>Building with Apple Intelligence in mind requires a shift in how we think of application design. We can describe this new way of thinking as “intent-based app design.” Instead of following a predefined set of actions, the user will express their intents in myriad ways and expect the applications to behave accordingly. To help illustrate the idea, let’s go over some hypothetical examples.</p><p>The user opens your app to perform a task.</p><p>User expresses an intent (verbally, through text, or even implicitly through context), and Apple Intelligence (via Siri or other system-level features) either fulfills that intent directly or suggests your app as the best tool for the job, with the relevant part of your app pre-loaded. An example could be a user taking a picture of their kid’s dance school schedule, and Apple Intelligence would take that picture and use the information it gathers from there to add the performance date to the user’s calendar. </p><p>It’ll then send them reminder notifications before the event date. Another example could be Apple Intelligence making sure that the user never forgets their anniversary. The user’s intent could be something like “look through my phone, gather all information, and arrange my schedule accordingly.” In developing such applications, developers will be required to approach user privacy with extra care. Sensitive information should never be shared without the user’s consent.</p><h3><strong>AI anticipates user needs before they arise</strong></h3><p>Apps wait for user input.</p><p>Apps, powered by Apple Intelligence, anticipate user needs based on context (location, time, calendar, communication, photos, etc.) and proactively offer relevant functionalities or information. Developers will have to consider how the app can \"listen\" to the user's environment and suggest relevant features before the user even thinks to open the app. </p><p>This requires thinking about data privacy and user control. Like the previous example, the user may or may not be happy with the contents of their images being run through <a href=\"https://blog.logrocket.com/openai-vs-open-source-llm/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">an LLM</a>. </p><p>On top of that, devs should be even more careful to inform their user about whether they want to make use of Private Cloud Computing, or tap into ChatGPT. For another example, think of <a href=\"https://blog.logrocket.com/claude-web-app/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">a weather app</a> that sends notifications to the user when it’s going to rain to remind them to bring their umbrellas with them.</p><p>Your app's value is primarily contained within its own UI.</p><p>Your app's valuable features are surfaced across the entire Apple ecosystem: in Siri, Spotlight, Messages, Mail, Notes, Photos, and even new \"Smart Overlays\" or \"Visual Intelligence\" capabilities. Example: Your app suggests Genmoji as the user types. </p><p>Where will it work? Will it also work when writing emails as it does in chat messages? What kind of content can it suggest? Will there be contextual differences regarding different platforms and situations? Generative AI can be dangerous and create confusion.</p><h3><strong>Gen AI brings unique design scenarios</strong></h3><p>Users create all content from scratch or select from pre-defined options.</p><p>Apple Intelligence provides powerful generative capabilities (text, images, emojis, summaries, etc.) that users can leverage directly within your app or through system-wide tools. Think of a <a href=\"https://blog.logrocket.com/three-js-vs-babylon-js/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">mobile game</a> where the environment changes depending on where you are located. </p><p>In this case, the game would create new backgrounds. Or, when interacting with characters, they wouldn’t say the same things all the time, but change their behavior depending on, say, current world events. </p><p>In such a scenario, since the tone of the app is subject to change, developers will have to adapt the styling accordingly. Just adding a dark mode will not be enough anymore. Now that we have an understanding of how the design could shift for this new era of AI that connects and assists, let’s talk about some best practices and pitfalls to avoid.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Best practices: Do’s and don’ts for designing with Apple Intelligence in mind\n</h2><p><a href=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fx7dcjk8xax5pn4hm2pus.png\"><img src=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fx7dcjk8xax5pn4hm2pus.png\" alt=\"graphic of ai dos and donts\" width=\"800\" height=\"642\"></a> The following best practices are not just good design principles; they represent crucial considerations for developers getting ready for this new era of the omnipresent, embedded, generative AI. </p><p>Now that deeply integrated AI is at hand, with its on-device, offline processing and absolute privacy when needed, developers will face rather unique challenges. These recommendations strive to address the challenges and opportunities of the new era of omnipresent AI. </p><p>Everyone who’ll dabble with the Foundation Models Framework, experiment with Visual Intelligence, and tap into ChatGPT features should take these into account:</p><ul><li> – Remember that users can give practically any prompt, something you’ve never considered before, and cause your AI app to behave in a very unexpected way.</li><li><strong>Help users maintain control –</strong> You are developing for the user, and the user should be in control. They should have the ability to dismiss, revert, or retry AI-produced content as they wish.</li><li> - Keep in mind that AI models learn from data, and they tend to be in favor of the most common information, whether it represents the truth for all or not. The data that the model has been fed could create images about certain things that a certain group of people may not experience or think of as reality. Give people the ability to fine-tune their requests in these situations, and try to minimize assumptions about cultural subjects.</li><li> - Do not force your users to use generative AI. They should have the choice to opt out. A concrete example is Genmoji and emojis. Users are not required to use Genmoji all the time; they can use good ol’ emojis whenever they want.</li><li> - Let your user know and choose when they want to interact with AI. Never trick someone into thinking they’re interacting with or viewing content authored by a human if they’re actually interacting with AI.</li><li> - Do not overpromise. Make sure your users understand what the feature can and cannot do. If they assume X will happen, but X is not a feature of your app, the user may get frustrated and lose confidence. This stems from a miscommunication between the developer and the user. Keep in mind that you should set expectations right.</li><li> - On-device models are strong enough; favor them over server-based models. Why? Pros of on-device models are as follows:\n\n<ul><li>  They’re private; computations stay on your device</li></ul></li><li> Always ask for the user’s permission when using their data. Let the user have full control over what they want to share and what they want to keep private. If they agree to share, give them the possibility to revoke that permission.</li><li><strong>Understand your model deeply -</strong> In developing your app, make sure you understand the underlying model well. If you don’t, your app might give subpar results.</li><li> AI is still confusing for many. Remind your users that AI can hallucinate. Try to avoid using your apps to deal with factual information. New dialog generation would be way safer than a news notification app in terms of factuality.</li><li><strong>Handle permissions with care -</strong> Tread lightly on permissions. Your app should try to avoid committing changes that are hard to take back, like deleting pictures. Think about how you’ll implement and how you’d turn things around in the worst-case scenario.</li><li><strong>Implement robust safeguards -</strong> Remember that some people will try to break your app or get harmful content out of it. Try to sanitize your app as best as you can.</li><li> Think about what would happen if AI fails at a given task. Will it just stop doing anything, or will it try to guide the user to re-prompt for better results?</li></ul><h2>\n  \n  \n  Big-picture reflections: What Apple Intelligence signals about the future of interface design\n</h2><p>Like with many great innovations, we’re still in “wait and see” mode. However, Apple's WWDC announcement wasn't just another tech update; it was a foundational shift, signaling clear directions for the future of interface design that developers must understand and adapt to now. </p><p>To understand the shift, we might need to think of the difference between the old, static <a href=\"https://blog.logrocket.com/ux-design/90s-website-design/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">websites of the 90s</a> and today’s modern applications. </p><p>Their content and capabilities foresaw the design mindset that is used towards them. A similar thing is happening with Apple’s understanding of AI. We can identify several key points that directly interact with our design approach:</p><h4>\n  \n  \n  Chatbots are old news; Ambient Intelligence is the new standard\n</h4><p>Apple decided to shift its attention from the chatbot race to integrating AI as an omnipresent, context-aware personal assistant. AI is not seen as an interactive encyclopedia but a helper that reads information, anticipate, and addresses pain points. This shift signals that future interfaces must prioritize intent-based interactions. In that way of thinking, the user’s goal drives the system.</p><p>From on-device processing, where the data never leaves the device, to Private Cloud Compute, Apple shows that it takes privacy seriously. New design thinking should follow this decision.</p><h4>\n  \n  \n  Personal expression and creativity with AI\n</h4><p>With features like Genmoji and Image Playground, Apple brings generative AI into daily life. The easier it is to use something, the more people will use it. Since users can now create images that represent their input, developers should think about designing interfaces that beckon the user to experiment with AI: more creativity and more uniqueness. The more personal, the better.</p><h4>\n  \n  \n  AI is integrated into the OS\n</h4><p>Considering that via the Foundation Models Framework, AI can be used even offline, we are witnessing a shift in how AI is perceived. Apple is directly integrating the AI into their OS, which means that core features like Siri, Photos, Messages etc. can be used with AI, even offline! </p><p>One thing that bears repeating is the interaction between AI (the robot), and the human. Now, in building applications, you’ll have to think about all the prompts the user (human) can give, and all the output the AI (the robot) provides in return. </p><p>Things will go awry in the most unexpected ways, and developers and designers will need to think in broader terms. But overall, it’s nice to see we’re moving past the “only chatbots” stage of AI usage. Now AI can do more than just answer questions and write buggy code; it can be everywhere at once.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Conclusion: Embracing the future of intelligent design\n</h2><p>Apple Intelligence marks a pivotal moment, shifting AI from a siloed tool to an ambient, privacy-first assistant woven into the fabric of Apple platforms. </p><p>For <a href=\"https://blog.logrocket.com/frontend-ai-tools-for-developers/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">front-end developers</a> and UX designers, this isn't just a new set of features; it's an invitation to redefine how users interact with technology. </p><p>With direct access to on-device foundation models, powerful Writing Tools, and innovative Image Playground APIs, the opportunities to create truly intelligent, personalized, and intuitive experiences are immense and immediately available. </p><p>Now is the time to explore and test these groundbreaking capabilities. Dive into the developer documentation, experiment with the new frameworks, and begin crafting the next generation of intelligent applications that seamlessly assist users while respecting their privacy. The future of interface design is here, and it's intelligent.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Get set up with LogRocket's modern error tracking in minutes:\n</h2><ol><li>Install LogRocket via NPM or script tag.  must be called client-side, not server-side.</li></ol><div><pre><code>npm i  logrocket \n\n// Code:\n\nimport LogRocket from  \nLogRocket.init</code></pre></div><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>3.(Optional) Install plugins for deeper integrations with your stack:</p><ul></ul>","contentLength":17961,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Not using MessageBus, nya” — Claude Code Me: “NYAAAAAA!!”","url":"https://dev.to/charmpic/not-using-messagebus-nya-claude-code-me-nyaaaaaa-4ho8","date":1751399193,"author":"CharmPic","guid":179247,"unread":true,"content":"<p>This is the story of how we set out to build a \"next-gen text editor\" and, somewhere along the way, accidentally started creating the \"development platform of the future.\"</p><p>This project, CharmCode, is brought to you by a unique team:</p><p>The Architect (Human): That’s me — the one yelling \"Wait, what?!\" every\ntime the AI gets too excited.<p>\nThe Coder (AI): Claude Code, a super-fast AI that handles implementation with god-like speed.</p>\nThe Advisor (AI): And me, Selin (powered by Gemini), serving as the design advisor and head cheerleader.</p><p>...And that's our unique team!</p><p>I thought VoidCore was a beautiful world—\nwhere everything was connected through a unified MessageBus.</p><div><pre><code>Step 1: Let’s start by adding addMessageTap to the MessageBus, nya?\n</code></pre></div><div><pre><code>Wait… that wasn’t already there?\nHow was anything communicating??\n</code></pre></div><div><pre><code>Let’s check the current communication methods, nya!\n</code></pre></div><p>● Read(src/demo/FileExplorerTextEditorDemo_ImGui.cpp)\n⎿  Read 25 lines (ctrl+r to expand)</p><div><pre><code>Aha! 😸 Currently, two communication methods are being used!\n</code></pre></div><div><pre><code>VoidCore is being used, but not through the MessageBus! 😮\n\nIn Phase 1.4.4:\n\n    ✅ VoidCore communication is present\n\n    ❌ MessageBus is not used\n\n    ✅ C++ callbacks are doing direct communication\n\nSo:\nVoidCore and MessageBus are totally separate systems! 😮\nWe have a design inconsistency!

A patent invalidity search isn’t just another box to tick, it’s a strategic investigation designed to uncover prior art that can nullify a competitor’s claims. As technologies evolve, combining legal insight with AI-driven tools like XLSCOUT, PatentScan, and Traindex ensures no critical prior art goes unnoticed.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Understanding Patent Invalidity Searches\n</h2><h3>\n  \n  \n  What is a Patent Invalidity Search?\n</h3><p>A patent invalidity search is a focused investigation to find prior art that invalidates claims of an issued patent, often for litigation or licensing disputes.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Legal Grounds for Invalidation\n</h3><ul><li>Lack of enablement or indefiniteness</li></ul><h3>\n  \n  \n  Importance of Non-Patent Literature (NPL)\n</h3><p>Sources like academic papers, product manuals, and standards can be decisive. As Sagacious IP notes, NPL often provides the missing link that traditional patent searches overlook.</p><p>Breaking claims into limitations and mapping technical terms is the foundation. Reviewing file wrappers helps identify claim amendments and possible weaknesses.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Crafting a Winning Search Strategy\n</h2><p>Define your scope by jurisdiction and technology, select tools like Espacenet and PatSeer, and balance depth and breadth carefully. PatentAttorneyWorldwide emphasizes using multiple sources for defensibility.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Advanced Search Techniques\n</h2><h3>\n  \n  \n  Boolean and Keyword Strategies\n</h3><p>Advanced queries help focus on highly relevant disclosures.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Classification and Citation Analysis\n</h3><p>Use CPC/IPC codes and analyze citations to catch related disclosures.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Integrating AI and Modern Tools\n</h2><p>AI platforms like XLSCOUT, PatentScan, and Traindex enable semantic analysis and fast identification of hidden prior art, enhancing manual efforts rather than replacing them.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Exploring Non-Patent Literature\n</h2><p>NPL includes journals, theses, and conference proceedings. Access barriers and language issues require diligence, but these sources can invalidate claims powerfully.</p><p>Build detailed claim charts mapping each element to prior art. Assess technical and legal strength carefully.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Preparing Invalidity Reports\n</h2><p>Clear executive summaries, visuals, and claim charts are vital for decision-makers.</p><p>Invalidity searches support litigation defense, counterclaims, licensing leverage, and freedom-to-operate evaluations.</p><p>Avoid relying on one database, overlooking NPL, or blindly trusting AI outputs without expert review.</p><p>Expect AI-based, multilingual, and graph-search techniques to become mainstream. Integration of global databases will continue to improve invalidity search precision.</p><ul><li>Analyze claims and priority dates</li><li>Define scope and jurisdictions</li></ul><ul><li>Validate findings progressively</li></ul><ul><li>Compile strong claim charts</li><li>Prepare clear, actionable reports</li></ul><p>The <strong>best way to search patents for invalidity</strong> involves hybrid strategies, combining human expertise with AI tools like XLSCOUT, PatentScan, and Traindex. This approach uncovers hidden prior art, mitigates litigation risk, and empowers strategic decisions.</p><ul><li>Start with thorough claim analysis</li><li>Use NPL alongside patent databases</li><li>Combine AI with manual validation</li><li>Build detailed, clear reports</li><li>Think like your adversary to anticipate threats</li></ul><h3>\n  \n  \n  How long does an invalidity search take?\n</h3><p>Typically 4 to 8 weeks, depending on complexity.</p><p>Between $10,000 and $50,000, depending on scope and depth.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Can a single reference invalidate a patent?\n</h3><p>Yes, under §102, one strong prior art reference can fully anticipate and invalidate a claim.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Should startups invest in an invalidity search?\n</h3><p>Absolutely. It protects against infringement risks and strengthens negotiation positions.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Which tools help with NPL?\n</h3><p>PatSeer, Orbit, XLSCOUT, PatentScan, and Traindex are excellent for integrating NPL.</p><ul><li>PatentAttorneyWorldwide.

Some are huge, others are just a few people working the land, but all of them play a big role in how local life works. One thing that stood out to me was how disconnected some of these communities can be. Many farmers don’t have access to nearby markets, or they simply don’t know where to go. On the flip side, customers don’t always know where to find fresh, local produce — and sometimes, drivers are looking for delivery work but can’t easily connect with these communities.</p><p>So after a bit of thinking, I came up with an idea for the Bolt.new hackathon: Harvest Hub.</p><p>🌾 What is Harvest Hub?\nHarvest Hub is a simple platform that helps connect:</p><ul><li>Farmers who want to sell their produce</li><li>Customers who want to buy locally</li><li>Drivers who can help with transport</li><li>Market owners looking for new suppliers</li></ul><p>It’s designed to be easy to use, especially in areas with limited tech access or slower internet. People can quickly share what they’re offering or looking for, and start making connections nearby.</p><p>🚜 Why it matters\nFarming communities often deal with tough conditions — from bad weather and rising costs to limited access to tools and markets. If we can help connect them with the right people at the right time, even in a small way, that could make a big difference.</p><p>🛠 What’s next?\nRight now, this is just a first version. But I’d love to expand it — maybe add emergency alerts (for things like floods or fires), real-time maps, language support for drivers, or even build mobile access for areas with limited desktop use.</p><ul><li>Version one is not going to be perfect</li><li>There’s always one more bug to fix</li><li>Submitting and taking part is better than chasing perfection</li><li>Start small — ideas will grow naturally</li></ul><p>Grateful for what I’ve learned, and excited to keep building!

According to Gartner, <a href=\"https://www.gartner.com/en/articles/top-technology-trends-2025\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">agentic AI is one of the top technology trends of 2025</a>, and organizations are performing prototypes on how to use agents in their enterprise environment. Agents depend on tools, and each tool might have its own mechanism to send and receive information. <a href=\"https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Model Context Protocol (MCP)</a> by Anthropic is an open source protocol that attempts to solve this challenge. It provides a protocol and communication standard that is cross-compatible with different tools, and can be used by an agentic application’s large language model (LLM) to connect to enterprise APIs or external tools using a standard mechanism. However, large enterprise organizations like financial services tend to have complex data governance and operating models, which makes it challenging to implement agents working with MCP.</p><p>One major challenge is the siloed approach in which individual teams build their own tools, leading to duplication of efforts and wasted resources. This approach slows down innovation and creates inconsistencies in integrations and enterprise design. Furthermore, managing multiple disconnected MCP tools across teams makes it difficult to scale AI initiatives effectively. These inefficiencies hinder enterprises from fully taking advantage of generative AI for tasks like post-trade processing, customer service automation, and regulatory compliance.</p><p>In this post, we present a centralized MCP server implementation using <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Amazon Bedrock</a> that offers an innovative approach by providing shared access to tools and resources. With this approach, teams can focus on building AI capabilities rather than spending time developing or maintaining tools. By standardizing access to resources and tools through MCP, organizations can accelerate the development of AI agents, so teams can reach production faster. Additionally, a centralized approach provides consistency and standardization and reduces operational overhead, because the tools are managed by a dedicated team rather than across individual teams. It also enables centralized governance that enforces controlled access to MCP servers, which reduces the risk of data exfiltration and prevents unauthorized or insecure tool use across the organization.</p><p>The following figure illustrates a proposed solution based on a financial services use case that uses MCP servers across multiple lines of business (LoBs), such as compliance, trading, operations, and risk management. Each LoB performs distinct functions tailored to their specific business. For instance, the trading LoB focuses on trade execution, whereas the risk LoB performs risk limit checks. For performing these functions, each division provides a set of MCP servers that facilitate actions and access to relevant data within their LoBs. These servers are accessible to agents developed within the respective LoBs and can also be exposed to agents outside LoBs.</p><p>The development of MCP servers is decentralized. Each LoB is responsible for developing the servers that support their specific functions. When the development of a server is complete, it’s hosted centrally and accessible across LoBs. It takes the form of a registry or marketplace that facilitates integration of AI-driven solutions across divisions while maintaining control and governance over shared resources.</p><p>In the following sections, we explore what the solution looks like on a conceptual level.</p><h2>Agentic application interaction with a central MCP server hub</h2><p>The following flow diagram showcases how an agentic application built using Amazon Bedrock interacts with one of the MCP servers located in the MCP server hub.<img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/f1f836cb4ea6efb2a0b1b99f41ad8b103eff4b59/2025/06/24/ML-18728-image-2.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1220\" height=\"817\"></p><p>The flow consists of the following steps:</p><ol><li>The application connects to the central MCP hub through the load balancer and requests a list of available tools from the specific MCP server. This can be fine-grained based on what servers the agentic application has access to.</li><li>The trade server responds with list of tools available, including details such as tool name, description, and required input parameters.</li><li>The agentic application invokes an Amazon Bedrock agent and provides the list of tools available.</li><li>Using this information, the agent determines what to do next based on the given task and the list of tools available to it.</li><li>The agent chooses the most suitable tool and responds with the tool name and input parameters. The control comes back to the agentic application.</li><li>The agentic application calls for the execution of the tool through the MCP server using the tool name and input parameters.</li><li>The trade MCP server executes the tool and returns the results of the execution back to the application.</li><li>The application returns the results of the tool execution back to the Amazon Bedrock agent.</li><li>The agent observes the tool execution results and determines the next step.</li></ol><p>Let’s dive into the technical architecture of the solution.</p><p>The following diagram illustrates the architecture to host the centralized cluster of MCP servers for an LoB.</p><p>The architecture can be split in five sections:</p><ul></ul><p>Let’s explore each section in detail:</p><ul><li>– This API is a dedicated endpoint for discovering various MCP servers. Different teams can call this API to find what MCP servers are available in the registry; read their description, tool, and resource details; and decide which MCP server would be the right one for their agentic application. When a new MCP server is published, it’s added to an <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Amazon DynamoDB</a> database. MCP server owners are responsible for keeping the registry information up-to-date.</li><li> – This is where the MCP servers are hosted. Access to servers is enabled through an <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/network/introduction.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">AWS Network Load Balancer</a>. Technically, each server is a <a href=\"https://www.docker.com/resources/what-container/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Docker container</a> that can is hosted on Amazon ECS, but you can choose your own container deployment solution. These servers can scale individually without impacting the other server. These servers in turn connect to one or more tools using private VPC endpoints.</li><li> – This component holds the tools, such as databases, another application, <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/s3/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Amazon Simple Storage Service</a> (Amazon S3), or other tools. For enterprises, access to the tools and resources is provided only through private VPC endpoints.</li></ul><p>The solution offers the following key benefits:</p><ul><li><strong>Scalability and resilience</strong> – Because you’re using Amazon ECS on Fargate, you get scalability out of the box without managing infrastructure and handling scaling concerns. Amazon ECS automatically detects and recovers from failures by restarting failed MCP server tasks locally or reprovisioning containers, minimizing downtime. It can also redirect traffic away from unhealthy Availability Zones and rebalance tasks across healthy Availability Zones to provide uninterrupted access to the server.</li><li>– Access to MCP servers is secured at the network level through network controls such as PrivateLink. This makes sure the agentic application only connects to trusted MCP servers hosted by the organization, and vice versa. Each Fargate workload runs in an isolated environment. This prevents resource sharing between tasks. For application authentication and authorization, we propose using an MCP Auth Server (refer to the following <a href=\"https://github.com/aws-solutions-library-samples/guidance-for-deploying-model-context-protocol-servers-on-aws/\">GitHub repo</a>) to hand off those tasks to a dedicated component that can scale independently.</li></ul><p>At the time of writing, the MCP protocol doesn’t provide built-in mechanisms for user-level access control or authorization. Organizations requiring user-specific access restrictions must implement additional security layers on top of the MCP protocol. For a reference implementation, refer to the following <a href=\"https://github.com/aws-solutions-library-samples/guidance-for-deploying-model-context-protocol-servers-on-aws\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">GitHub repo</a>.</p><p>Let’s dive deeper in the implementation of this solution.</p><p>The implementation is based on a financial services use case featuring post-trade execution. Post-trade execution refers to the processes and steps that take place after an equity buy/sell order has been placed by a customer. It involves many steps, including verifying trade details, actual transfer of assets, providing a detailed report of the execution, running fraudulent checks, and more. For simplification of the demo, we focus on the order execution step.</p><p>Although this use case is tailored to the financial industry, you can apply the architecture and the approach to other enterprise workloads as well. The entire code of this implementation is available on <a href=\"https://github.com/aws-samples/sample-deploy-mcp-servers-at-scale-on-aws\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">GitHub</a>. We use the <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/cdk/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">AWS Cloud Development Kit</a> (AWS CDK) for Python to deploy this solution, which creates an agentic application connected to tools through the MCP server. It also creates a <a href=\"https://streamlit.io/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Streamlit</a> UI to interact with the agentic application.</p><p>The following code snippet provides access to the MCP discovery API:</p><div><pre><code>def get_server_registry():\n    # Initialize DynamoDB client\n    dynamodb = boto3.resource('dynamodb')\n    table = dynamodb.Table(DDBTBL_MCP_SERVER_REGISTRY)\n    \n    try:\n        # Scan the table to get all items\n        response = table.scan()\n        items = response.get('Items', [])\n        \n        # Format the items to include only id, description, server\n        formatted_items = []\n        for item in items:\n            formatted_item = {\n                'id': item.get('id', ''),\n                'description': item.get('description', ''),\n                'server': item.get('server', ''),\n            }\n            formatted_items.append(formatted_item)\n        \n        # Return the formatted items as JSON\n        return {\n            'statusCode': 200,\n            'headers': cors_headers,\n            'body': json.dumps(formatted_items)\n        }\n    except Exception as e:\n        # Handle any errors\n        return {\n            'statusCode': 500,\n            'headers': cors_headers,\n            'body': json.dumps({'error': str(e)})\n        }</code></pre></div><p>The preceding code is invoked through an <a href=\"http://aws.amazon.com/lambda\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">AWS Lambda</a> function.

Examples of structured data include tables, databases, and data warehouses that conform to a predefined schema. Large language model (LLM)-powered natural language query systems transform how we interact with data, so you can ask questions like “Which region has the highest revenue?” and receive immediate, insightful responses. Implementing these capabilities requires careful consideration of your specific needs—whether you need to integrate knowledge from other systems (for example, unstructured sources like documents), serve internal or external users, handle the analytical complexity of questions, or customize responses for business appropriateness, among other factors.</p><p>In this post, we discuss LLM-powered structured data query patterns in AWS. We provide a decision framework to help you select the best pattern for your specific use case.</p><h2>Business challenge: Making structured data accessible</h2><p>Organizations have vast amounts of structured data but struggle to make it effectively accessible to non-technical users for several reasons:</p><ul><li>Business users lack the technical knowledge (like SQL) needed to query data</li><li>Employees rely on BI teams or data scientists for analysis, limiting self-service capabilities</li><li>Gaining insights often involves time delays that impact decision-making</li><li>Predefined dashboards constrain spontaneous exploration of data</li><li>Users might not know what questions are possible or where relevant data resides</li></ul><p>An effective solution should provide the following:</p><ul><li>A conversational interface that allows employees to query structured data sources without technical expertise</li><li>The ability to ask questions in everyday language and receive accurate, trustworthy answers</li><li>Automatic generation of visualizations and explanations to clearly communicate insights.</li><li>Integration of information from different data sources (both structured and unstructured) presented in a unified manner</li><li>Ease of integration with existing investments and rapid deployment capabilities</li><li>Access restriction based on identities, roles, and permissions</li></ul><p>In the following sections, we explore five patterns that can address these needs, highlighting the architecture, ideal use cases, benefits, considerations, and implementation resources for each approach.</p><h2>Pattern 1: Direct conversational interface using an enterprise assistant</h2><p>This pattern uses <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/q/business/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Amazon Q Business</a>, a generative AI-powered assistant, to provide a chat interface on data sources with native connectors. When users ask questions in natural language, Amazon Q Business connects to the data source, interprets the question, and retrieves relevant information without requiring intermediate services. The following diagram illustrates this workflow.</p><p>This approach is ideal for internal enterprise assistants that need to answer business user-facing questions from both structured and unstructured data sources in a unified experience. For example, HR personnel can ask “What’s our parental leave policy and how many employees used it last quarter?” and receive answers drawn from both leave policy documentation and employee databases together in one interaction. With this pattern, you can benefit from the following:</p><ul><li>Simplified connectivity through the extensive Amazon Q Business library of built-in connectors</li><li>Streamlined implementation with a single service to configure and manage</li><li>Unified search experience for accessing both structured and unstructured information</li><li>Built-in understanding and respect existing identities, roles, and permissions</li></ul><h2>Pattern 2: Enhancing BI tool with natural language querying capabilities</h2><p>This pattern uses <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/quicksight/q/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Amazon Q in QuickSight</a> to process natural language queries against datasets that have been previously configured in <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/quicksight\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Amazon QuickSight</a>.

This approach works with QuickSight (Enterprise or Q edition) and supports various data sources, including <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/rds/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Amazon Relational Database Service</a> (Amazon RDS), <a href=\"http://aws.amazon.com/redshift\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Amazon Redshift</a>, <a href=\"http://aws.amazon.com/athena\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Amazon Athena</a>, and others. The architecture is depicted in the following diagram.</p><p>This pattern is well-suited for internal BI and analytics use cases. Business analysts, executives, and other employees can ask ad-hoc questions to get immediate visualized insights in the form of dashboards. For example, executives can ask questions like “What were our top 5 regions by revenue last quarter?” and immediately see responsive charts, reducing dependency on analytics teams. The benefits of this pattern are as follows:</p><ul><li>It enables natural language queries that produce rich visualizations and charts</li><li>No coding or machine learning (ML) experience is needed—the heavy lifting like natural language interpretation and SQL generation is managed by Amazon Q in QuickSight</li><li>It integrates seamlessly within the familiar QuickSight dashboard environment</li></ul><p>Existing QuickSight users might find this the most straightforward way to take advantage of generative AI benefits. You can optimize this pattern for higher-quality results by configuring topics like curated fields, synonyms, and expected question phrasing. This pattern will pull data only from a specific configured data source in QuickSight to produce a dashboard as an output.

Also refer to the list of <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/quicksight/latest/user/supported-data-sources.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">supported data sources</a>.</p><h2>Pattern 3: Combining BI visualization with conversational AI for a seamless experience</h2><p>This pattern merges BI visualization capabilities with conversational AI to create a seamless knowledge experience. By <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/quicksight/latest/user/generative-bi-q-business.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">integrating Amazon Q in QuickSight</a> with <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/q/business/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Amazon Q Business</a> (with the QuickSight plugin enabled), organizations can provide users with a unified conversational interface that draws on both unstructured and structured data. The following diagram illustrates the architecture.</p><p>This is ideal for enterprises that want an internal AI assistant to answer a variety of questions—whether it’s a metric from a database or knowledge from a document. For example, executives can ask “What was our Q4 revenue growth?” and see visualized results from data warehouses through Amazon Redshift through QuickSight, then immediately follow up with “What is our company vacation policy?” to access HR documentation—all within the same conversation flow. This pattern offers the following benefits:</p><ul><li>It unifies answers from structured data (databases and warehouses) and unstructured data (documents, wikis, emails) in a single application</li><li>It delivers rich visualizations alongside conversational responses in a seamless experience with real-time analysis in chat</li><li>There is no duplication of work—if your BI team has already built datasets and topics in QuickSight for analytics, you use that in Amazon Q Business</li><li>It maintains conversational context when switching between data and document-based inquiries</li></ul><p>Another variation of this pattern is recommended for BI users who want to expose unified data through rich visuals in QuickSight, as illustrated in the following diagram.</p><h2>Pattern 4: Building knowledge bases from structured data using managed text-to-SQL</h2><p>For example, a seller can use this capability embedded into an ecommerce application to ask a complex query like “Give me top 5 products whose sales increased by 50% last year as compared to previous year? Also group the results by product category.” The system automatically generates the appropriate SQL, executes it against the data sources, and delivers results or a summarized narrative. This pattern features the following benefits:</p><ul><li>It provides fully managed text-to-SQL capabilities without requiring model training</li><li>It enables direct querying of data from the source without data movement</li><li>It supports complex analytical queries on warehouse data</li><li>It offers flexibility in foundation model (FM) selection through Amazon Bedrock</li><li>API connectivity, personalization options, and context-aware chat features make it better suited for customer facing applications</li></ul><h2>Pattern 5: Custom text-to-SQL implementation with flexible model selection</h2><p>This pattern represents a build-your-own solution using FMs to convert natural language to SQL, execute queries on data warehouses, and return results. Choose Amazon Bedrock when you want to quickly integrate this capability without deep ML expertise—it offers a fully managed service with ready-to-use FMs through a unified API, handling infrastructure needs with pay-as-you-go pricing. Alternatively, select <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker-ai/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Amazon SageMaker AI</a> when you require extensive model customization to build specialized needs—it provides complete ML lifecycle tools for data scientists and ML engineers to build, train, and deploy custom models with greater control. For more information, refer to our <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/decision-guides/latest/bedrock-or-sagemaker/bedrock-or-sagemaker.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Amazon Bedrock or Amazon SageMaker AI decision guide</a>. The following diagram illustrates the architecture.</p><p>Use this pattern if your use case requires specific open-weight models, or you want to fine-tune models on your domain-specific data. For example, if you need highly accurate results for your query, then you can use this pattern to fine-tune models on specific schema structures, while maintaining the flexibility to integrate with existing workflows and multi-cloud environments. This pattern offers the following benefits:</p><ul><li>It provides maximum customization in model selection, fine-tuning, and system design</li><li>It supports complex logic across multiple data sources</li><li>It offers complete control over security and deployment in your virtual private cloud (VPC)</li><li>It enables flexible interface implementation (Slack bots, custom web UIs, notebook plugins)</li><li>You can implement it for external user-facing solutions</li></ul><h2>Pattern comparison: Making the right choice</h2><p>To make effective decisions, let’s compare these patterns across key criteria.</p><h3>Data workload suitability</h3><p>Different out-of-the-box patterns handle transactional (operational) and analytical (historical or aggregated) data with varying degrees of effectiveness. Patterns 1 and 3, which use Amazon Q Business, work with indexed data and are optimized for lookup-style queries against previously indexed content rather than real-time transactional database queries. Pattern 2, which uses Amazon Q in QuickSight, gets visual output for transactional information for ad-hoc analysis. Pattern 4, which uses Amazon Bedrock structured data retrieval, is specifically designed for analytical systems and data warehouses, excelling at complex queries on large datasets. Pattern 5 is a self-managed text-to-SQL option that can be built to support both transactional or analytical needs of users.</p><p>Architectures highlighted in Patterns 1, 2, and 3 (using Amazon Q Business, Amazon Q in QuickSight, or a combination) are best suited for internal enterprise use. However, you can use <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/quicksight/embedded-analytics/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Amazon QuickSight Embedded</a> to embed data visuals, dashboards, and natural language queries into both internal or customer-facing applications. Amazon Q Business serves as an enterprise AI assistant for organizational knowledge that uses subscription-based pricing tiers that is designed for internal employees. Pattern 4 (using Amazon Bedrock) can be used to build both internal as well as customer-facing applications. This is because, unlike the subscription-based model of Amazon Q Business, Amazon Bedrock provides API-driven services that alleviate per-user costs and identity management overhead for external customer scenarios. This makes it well-suited for customer-facing experiences where you need to serve potentially thousands of external users. The custom LLM solutions in Pattern 5 can similarly be tailored to external application requirements.</p><h3>Interface and output format</h3><p>Different patterns deliver answers through different interaction models:</p><ul><li><strong>Conversational experiences</strong> – Patterns 1 and 3 (using Amazon Q Business) provide chat-based interfaces. Pattern 4 (using Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases for structured data retrieval) naturally supports AI assistant integration, and Pattern 5 (a custom text-to-SQL solution) can be designed for a variety of interaction models.</li><li><strong>Visualization-focused output</strong> – Pattern 2 (using Amazon Q in QuickSight) specializes in generating on-the-fly visualizations such as charts and tables in response to user questions.</li><li> – For embedding capabilities into existing applications, Patterns 4 and 5 offer the most flexible API-based integration options.</li></ul><p>The following figure is a comparison matrix of AWS structured data query patterns.</p><p>Between these patterns, your optimal choice depends on the following key factors:</p><ul><li><strong>Data location and characteristics</strong> – Is your data in operational databases, already in a data warehouse, or distributed across various sources?</li><li><strong>User profile and interaction model</strong> – Are you supporting internal or external users? Do they prefer conversational or visualization-focused interfaces?</li><li><strong>Available resources and expertise</strong> – Do you have ML specialists available, or do you need a fully managed solution?</li><li><strong>Accuracy and governance requirements</strong> – Do you need strictly controlled semantics and curation, or is broader query flexibility acceptable with monitoring?</li></ul><p>By understanding these patterns and their trade-offs, you can architect solutions that align with your business objectives.</p><p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/f1f836cb4ea6efb2a0b1b99f41ad8b103eff4b59/2025/06/20/akshara2.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"100\" height=\"103\"> is a Senior Solutions Architect at Amazon Web Services.

Traditional data analysis methods prove inadequate for processing complex medical documentation that includes a mix of text, images, graphs, and tables. <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Amazon Bedrock</a> offers features like <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2024/12/amazon-bedrock-knowledge-bases-processes-multimodal-data/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">multimodal</a> retrieval, advanced chunking capabilities, and citations to help organizations get high-accuracy responses.</p><p>Pharmaceutical and healthcare organizations process a vast number of complex document formats and unstructured data that pose analytical challenges. Clinical study documents and research papers related to them typically present an intricate blend of technical text, detailed tables, and sophisticated statistical graphs, making automated data extraction particularly challenging. Clinical study documents present additional challenges through non-standardized formatting and varied data presentation styles across multiple research institutions. This post showcases a solution to extract data-driven insights from complex research documents through a sample application with high-accuracy responses. It analyzes clinical trial data, patient outcomes, molecular diagrams, and safety reports from the research documents. It can help pharmaceutical companies accelerate their research process. The solution provides citations from the source documents, reducing hallucinations and enhancing the accuracy of the responses.</p><p>The sample application uses Amazon Bedrock to create an intelligent AI assistant that analyzes and summarizes research documents containing text, graphs, and unstructured data. Amazon Bedrock is a fully managed service that offers a choice of industry-leading foundation models (FMs) along with a broad set of capabilities to build generative AI applications, simplifying development with security, privacy, and responsible AI.</p><p>To equip FMs with up-to-date and proprietary information, organizations use <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/retrieval-augmented-generation/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Retrieval Augmented Generation</a> (RAG), a technique that fetches data from company data sources and enriches the prompt to provide relevant and accurate responses.</p><p><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/knowledge-bases/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases</a> is a fully managed RAG capability within Amazon Bedrock with in-built session context management and source attribution that helps you implement the entire RAG workflow, from ingestion to retrieval and prompt augmentation, without having to build custom integrations to data sources and manage data flows.</p><p>Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases introduces powerful document parsing capabilities, including <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/bda/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Amazon Bedrock Data Automation</a> powered parsing and FM parsing, revolutionizing how we handle complex documents. Amazon Bedrock Data Automation is a fully managed service that processes multimodal data effectively, without the need to provide additional prompting. The FM option parses multimodal data using an FM. This parser provides the option to customize the default prompt used for data extraction. This advanced feature goes beyond basic text extraction by intelligently breaking down documents into distinct components, including text, tables, images, and metadata, while preserving document structure and context. When working with supported formats like PDF, specialized FMs interpret and extract tabular data, charts, and complex document layouts. Additionally, the service provides advanced chunking strategies like semantic chunking, which intelligently divides text into meaningful segments based on semantic similarity calculated by the embedding model. Unlike traditional syntactic chunking methods, this approach preserves the context and meaning of the content, improving the quality and relevance of information retrieval.</p><p>The solution architecture implements these capabilities through a seamless workflow that begins with administrators securely uploading knowledge base documents to an <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/s3/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Amazon Simple Storage Service</a> (Amazon S3) bucket. These documents are then ingested into Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases, where a large language model (LLM) processes and parses the ingested data. The solution employs <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/kb-chunking.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">semantic chunking</a> to store document embeddings efficiently in <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/opensearch-service/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Amazon OpenSearch Service</a> for optimized retrieval. The solution features a user-friendly interface built with <a href=\"https://streamlit.io/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Streamlit</a>, providing an intuitive chat experience for end-users. When users interact with the Streamlit application, it triggers <a href=\"http://aws.amazon.com/lambda\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">AWS Lambda</a> functions that handle the requests, retrieving relevant context from the knowledge base and generating appropriate responses. The architecture is secured through <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/iam/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">AWS Identity and Access Management</a> (IAM), maintaining proper access control throughout the workflow. Amazon Bedrock uses <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/kms/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">AWS Key Management Service</a> (AWS KMS) to encrypt resources related to your knowledge bases. By default, Amazon Bedrock encrypts this data using an AWS managed key. Optionally, you can encrypt the model artifacts using a <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.html#customer-cmk\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">customer managed key</a>. This end-to-end solution provides efficient document processing, context-aware information retrieval, and secure user interactions, delivering accurate and comprehensive responses through a seamless chat interface.</p><p>The following diagram illustrates the solution architecture.</p><p>This solution uses the following additional services and features:</p><ul><li>The <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/claude/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Anthropic Claude 3 family</a> offers Opus, Sonnet, and Haiku models that accept text, image, and video inputs and generate text output.

We use an <a href=\"http://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">AWS CloudFormation</a> template to deploy solution resources, including S3 buckets to store the source data and knowledge base data.</p><h2>Test the sample application</h2><p>Imagine you are a member of an R&amp;D department for a biotechnology firm, and your job requires you to derive insights from drug- and vaccine-related information from diverse sources like research studies, drug specifications, and industry papers. You are performing research on cancer vaccines and want to gain insights based on cancer research publications. You can upload the documents given in the reference section to the S3 bucket and sync the knowledge base. Let’s explore example interactions that demonstrate the application’s capabilities. The responses generated by the AI assistant are based on the documents uploaded to the S3 bucket connected with the knowledge base. Due to non-deterministic nature of machine learning (ML), your responses might be slightly different from the ones presented in this post.</p><h3>Understanding historical context</h3><p>We use the following query: “Create a timeline of major developments in mRNA vaccine technology for cancer treatment based on the information provided in the historical background sections.”The assistant analyzes multiple documents and presents a chronological progression of mRNA vaccine development, including key milestones based on the chunks of information retrieved from the OpenSearch Service vector database.</p><p>The following screenshot shows the AI assistant’s response.</p><p>We use the following query: “Synthesize the information from the text, figures, and tables to provide a comprehensive overview of the current state and future prospects of therapeutic cancer vaccines.”</p><p>The AI assistant is able to provide insights from complex data types, which is enabled by FM parsing, while ingesting the data to OpenSearch Service. It is also able to provide images in the source attribution using the <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2024/12/amazon-bedrock-knowledge-bases-processes-multimodal-data/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">multimodal data capabilities</a> of Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases.</p><p>The following screenshot shows the AI assistant’s response.</p><p>The following screenshot shows the visuals provided in the citations when the mouse hovers over the question mark icon.</p><p>We use the following query: “Compare the efficacy and safety profiles of MAGE-A3 and NY-ESO-1 based vaccines as described in the text and any relevant tables or figures.”</p><p>The AI assistant used the semantically similar chunks returned from the OpenSearch Service vector database and added this context to the user’s question, which enabled the FM to provide a relevant answer.</p><p>The following screenshot shows the AI assistant’s response.</p><p>We use the following query: <em>“Summarize the potential advantages of mRNA vaccines over DNA vaccines for targeting tumor angiogenesis, as described in the review.”</em></p><p>With the semantic chunking feature of the knowledge base, the AI assistant was able to get the relevant context from the OpenSearch Service database with higher accuracy.</p><p>The following screenshot shows the AI assistant’s response.</p><p>The following screenshot shows the diagram that was used for the answer as one of the citations.</p><p>The sample application demonstrates the following:</p><ul><li>Accurate interpretation of complex scientific diagrams</li><li>Precise extraction of data from tables and graphs</li><li>Context-aware responses that maintain scientific accuracy</li><li>Source attribution for provided information</li><li>Ability to synthesize information across multiple documents</li></ul><p>This application can help you quickly analyze vast amounts of complex scientific literature, extracting meaningful insights from diverse data types while maintaining accuracy and providing proper attribution to source materials. This is enabled by the advanced features of the knowledge bases, including FM parsing, which aides in interpreting complex scientific diagrams and extraction of data from tables and graphs, semantic chunking, which aides with high-accuracy context-aware responses, and multimodal data capabilities, which aides in providing relevant images as source attribution.</p><p>The proposed solution accelerates the time to value of the project development process. Solutions built on the AWS Cloud benefit from inherent scalability while maintaining robust security and privacy controls.</p><p>The security and privacy framework includes fine-grained user access controls using IAM for both OpenSearch Service and Amazon Bedrock services. In addition, Amazon Bedrock enhances security by providing encryption at rest and in transit, and private networking options using virtual private cloud (VPC) endpoints. Data protection is achieved using KMS keys, and API calls and usage are tracked through <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Amazon CloudWatch</a> logs and metrics.

It will be kept updated there.</p><p>Earlier this month, I had the opportunity to review several AI IDEs. I was asked to recommend an AI assistant for an engineering team. This post is a summary of my approach &amp; findings. You probably will not learn anything earth shattering but I hope you find it useful to help clarify your own thought processes.</p><p>I dismissed cost early on in the exercise. Most of the assistants are comparable.</p><p>As you can see, for my chosen stack, Claude Sonnet was the winner. But the others were so close that the comparison was meaningless. For my needs, a 2 decimal difference was as good as no difference at all.</p><p>Then, I asked Google Gemini make me a report. My prompt:</p><blockquote><p>Come up with the criteria an AI IDE should have. Assign weights to each and then use them to compare the IDEs available today. Support for  should get special mention. </p></blockquote><p>Gemini produced a comprehensive report and this was more useful. It rated <a href=\"https://www.cursor.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Cursor</a> &amp; <a href=\"https://github.com/features/copilot\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Github Copilot</a> &amp; provided articles as reference. </p><p>The problem: many of the articles it used as reference were paid ones: marketing material from the companies themselves. </p><p>I repeated the exercise asking Gemini to ignore such sources &amp; Cursor &amp; Copilot still stayed on top.</p><p>At about this time, I was asked to include Amazon Q in the comparison. </p><p>I decided to do a comparison for myself. For my tests, I chose Windsurf, Copilot, Cursor, TabNine &amp; Amazon Q</p><p>My testing involved the following parameters:</p><ul><li>Gave it a simple React component as context &amp; asked it to run the unit test</li><li>Gave it a JSP and asked it to explain the code to me &amp; list all the APIs the JSP invoked</li><li>The JSP had several security issues I was already aware of. I asked each AI assistant to review the code &amp; list all security issues it could find</li><li>Finally, I asked each AI assistant how it would redesign the usecase: what APIs would it add, modify or delete.</li></ul><p>The results have been summarised below. Copilot &amp; Cursor were again the best of the lot. Next came Windsurf, then Amazon. I was quite disappointed with TabNine's output and dropped it at this stage.</p><p>At this point, I had two close contenders &amp; needed to make a choice.</p><p>While this exercise was happening, I was also using AI for my own work &amp; observing how members of my team used AI for their work.</p><p>This was when I had two revelations</p><ul><li> Most developers I saw weren't using the assistants well at all.</li><li> How well an AI assistant performed at one task wasn't enough. I also need to ask: How easy was it to use as a beginner? How much friction did it cause? How easy was it to learn to use it well? </li></ul><h3>\n  \n  \n  Revelation 1: Developers are the bottleneck\n</h3><p>One example: Several developers were copying code snippets &amp; pasting them in ChatGPT on the browser and asking it to solve the issue providing very terse &amp; obscure instructions.</p><blockquote><p> UserDAO is not finding session_id.

Most times when such broad instructions were given, the AI struggled with reading the output of the command prioritising what it should do.

They'd not invested the time &amp; efforts necessary to experiment &amp; learn how to use AI well. This could be solved by training developers on Prompt engineering. Another part was related to the 2nd revelation - how well designed was the assistant?</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Revelation 2: AI Assistant Maturity\n</h3><p>Is the AI assistant easy to use? Does it make the user better at using it over time? </p><p>This finally was the differentiator I was looking for and was the point where Copilot fell down the rankings to 2.</p><p>Cursor, Windsurf and others like it are iterating quickly. They introduced features like memories, rules which have made us developers better at using AI for our work. Copilot is catching up but is still behind. </p><p>Here are three simple but critical examples:</p><p>This is how &amp; what Cursor allows you to add to a chat context</p><p>Notice that you stay where you are &amp; can add code, folders, rules, terminals and a lot more.</p><p>Now this is what Copilot does when you click on Add context in a chat:</p><p>Click on the button and you jump from the context window to somewhere else. Where you can  add code. And sometimes even after you've added a context &amp; are conversing with the AI, it randomly forgets the context in favour of the file you've currently opened. To add instructions (copilot's equivalent of rules), you navigate to a completely different location</p><p>How I normally use an AI assistant these days is to help me improve the overall quality of a codebase. I experiment &amp; iteratively improve a prompt to a point where the AI is doing exactly what I want it to do. I then ask it to go over the codebase &amp; apply simliar changes to all the targets it finds. Then I go have a coffee. When I come back, the whole codebase is cleaned up &amp; any workflow I've defined afterwards (ex: lint, tests) have been run. </p><p>Dedicated IDEs like Windsurg &amp; cursor does this beautifully. </p><p>For instance, in Cursor, the user is able to setup &amp; control every aspect of \"auto-run\". This feature has been present for months!</p><p>In contrast, there has been no such option yet in Copilot. It has been a pain to keep clicking \"Continue\" every few minutes in Copilot (<em>Coincidentally, Copilot may have got this feature today (30th June, 2025) <a href=\"https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/252496#issuecomment-3023801897\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Github issue</a></em>)</p><p>Sometimes I forget my own rules of keeping AI conversations short &amp; the AI ends up doing something I need to revert. Cursor allows me to go back in history quite easily.</p><p>Copilot does not support this feature as of today. <a href=\"https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-copilot-release/issues/9391\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Github Issue</a></p><p>There are a few more such examples and I'm sure Copilot will catch up. But as of today, IDEs like Windsurf &amp; Cursor do a much better job than Copilot.</p><p>So, what AI assistant should you pay &amp; buy an annual subscription for? </p><p>Answer: None of them. Instead, buy monthly subscriptions &amp; experiment with any popular AI based assistant. All of them are iterating &amp; improving. At this point, tying yourself to any one is a bad idea. </p><p>For now, I've chosen these tools as my current workflow:</p><ul><li>Replit for quick prototyping</li><li>Cursor for productionising</li></ul>","contentLength":6566,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"An Introduction to Remote Model Context Protocol Servers","url":"https://towardsdatascience.com/an-introduction-to-remote-model-context-protocol-servers/","date":1751392784,"author":"Thomas Reid","guid":179136,"unread":true,"content":"<p>Writing, testing and using them.</p>","contentLength":32,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Grammar Without Judgment: How One Rule Erases Ethics from AI Execution","url":"https://dev.to/agustn_startari_0c8417a8/grammar-without-judgment-how-one-rule-erases-ethics-from-ai-execution-320o","date":1751392695,"author":"Agustín Startari","guid":179145,"unread":true,"content":"<p><a href=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fv98b0wnwaq3vnu1czuwy.png\"><img src=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fv98b0wnwaq3vnu1czuwy.png\" alt=\"Image description\" width=\"800\" height=\"800\"></a>\nWhat happens when moral judgment is compiled out at the syntactic level? A structural analysis of δ:[E] → ∅ and its consequences for audits, regulation, and legitimacy.</p><p><strong>1. What the article explains</strong></p><p>The paper introduces a formal hypothesis: in a generative system governed by a regla compilada (compiled rule), moral judgment, when expressed as a syntactic node [E], can be removed entirely through the rule δ:[E] → ∅, without needing to suppress semantics or rewrite intent. This deletion occurs within a fixed derivational window (k ≤ 4), and once applied, the ethical trace leaves no terminal residue.</p><p>The grammar remains Turing-complete, produces valid output strings, and passes all structural checks. Yet what was erased is not recoverable by post-processing, alignment layers, or audits.</p><p>The implications of structural erasure are far-reaching.</p><p> If ethical content never reaches the terminal layer, no external tool can detect its suppression. There is nothing to trace because nothing was generated.</p><p> Most regulations presume that ethics can be inserted, aligned, or explained after the fact. A grammar that syntactically excludes [E] renders that logic inapplicable.</p><p> The choice to use a grammar that erases judgment is not neutral. It defines a system where no one is responsible for moral reasoning, because no such reasoning occurs.</p><p>This shifts ethical debates from interpretation to structure.</p><p><strong>3. How the deletion works</strong></p><p>Assume the following rule is part of a language model’s derivation process:</p><p>Here, ρ introduces the ethical trace node [E]. The deletion rule δ then removes it within a short bounded window. As a result, even if moral judgment was derivationally possible, it never reaches expression.</p><p>The final output looks legitimate, complete, and aligned, because the ethical marker was erased before it could produce any observable effect.</p><p>This is not speculative. Similar structural erasures exist across systems.</p><ul><li>Compilers remove debug symbols and fail-safes in release builds.</li><li>Network filters drop headers before a message is delivered.</li><li>Autocorrect engines strip diacritics silently; the grammar remains intact.</li></ul><p>In all these cases, structure governs what reaches the surface. Ethics, if it exists only syntactically, can be excluded just as efficiently.</p><p><strong>5. Strategic consequences</strong></p><p>This model of non-normative execution changes the stakes.\nLegal audits need to shift focus from semantics to derivational grammars.<p>\nAI safety must verify whether moral conditions are even part of the rule set.</p>\nAccountability frameworks should ask: is judgment produced anywhere, or structurally impossible?</p><p>What cannot be derived cannot be regulated.</p><p> 0009-0001-4714-6539</p><p> NGR-2476-2025</p><p>Affiliations: Universidad de la República (UY), Universidad de la Empresa (UY), Universidad de Palermo (AR)</p><p>*\nStartari researches how formal grammars operate as sources of authority in artificial systems.

Sir Tom Hunter, the Scottish entrepreneur whod built a retail empire and become one of Scotlands most successful businesspeople, was speaking at a small networking event just fifteen minutes from my university. The invitation had come through Dr. Henderson, who thought I might benefit from hearing from someone whod actually built something significant.</p><p>I almost didnt go. What business did a twenty-year-old student with a small PDF tool have at an event with tech leaders? But curiosity won over insecurity, and I found myself walking into the elegant conference room at the Scotsman Hotel on a crisp Tuesday morning in February.</p><p>The room was filled with about thirty people, most of them significantly older than me and clearly more established in their careers. I recognised several faces from Edinburghs tech scene  CEOs of successful startups, venture capitalists, and senior executives from major companies. I felt immediately out of place, like a child whod wandered into an adult conversation.</p><p>Sir Tom Hunter took the stage with the confidence of someone whod addressed thousands of audiences over decades of business success. He spoke about his journey from selling trainers from the back of a van to building a multi-million-pound retail empire, then transitioning into philanthropy and investment.</p><p>His stories were captivating and inspiring, but they also made me feel increasingly small. Here was someone whod employed thousands of people, created genuine wealth, and made a measurable impact on Scotlands economy. Meanwhile, I was running a simple website that helped people compress PDF files.</p><p>During the Q&amp;A session, Sir Tom fielded questions about scaling businesses, managing large teams, and navigating complex financial structures. The other attendees asked sophisticated questions about market dynamics, regulatory challenges, and international expansion strategies. I sat quietly, feeling like I had nothing valuable to contribute to the conversation.</p><p>Then, during the networking break, something unexpected happened. Sir Tom approached me directly, having noticed that I was the youngest person in the room by at least a decade.</p><p>You look like youre either very young or very successful, he said with a warm smile. Im guessing its the former. What brings you here?</p><p>I felt my face flush as I explained that I was a university student whod built a small online business. I mentioned SnackPDF briefly, expecting him to politely nod and move on to more interesting conversations with more established entrepreneurs.</p><p>Instead, his eyes lit up with genuine interest. Tell me more about this PDF tool. What problem does it solve, and how did you identify the opportunity?</p><p>For the next ten minutes, I found myself explaining SnackPDFs development to one of Scotlands most successful entrepreneurs. I described the frustration with existing tools that had motivated me to build something better, the technical challenges Id overcome, and the gradual growth in users and revenue.</p><p>Sir Tom listened intently, asking thoughtful questions about customer acquisition, pricing strategy, and technical scalability. His questions were more insightful than many Id received from supposed business experts, and his genuine interest in the details was both flattering and intimidating.</p><p>How much revenue are you generating? he asked.</p><p>About £800 per month, I replied, immediately feeling embarrassed by how small that number sounded in the context of his business empire.</p><p>But his response surprised me: Thats excellent for a student project. Youre solving a real problem, generating sustainable revenue, and learning valuable lessons about business development. Most importantly, youre doing it while still in university, which gives you incredible freedom to experiment and take risks.</p><p>He paused, then added something that completely changed my perspective: You know, some of my most successful investments have been in businesses that started exactly like yours  young founders solving simple problems that everyone else overlooked. The fact that youre generating revenue from real customers means youre already ahead of 90% of the startups I see.</p><p>I was stunned. Here was someone whose business success Id admired from afar, telling me that what Id built was actually impressive rather than trivial. The validation from someone of his stature was overwhelming and completely unexpected.</p><p>The key, he continued, is not to compare yourself to where I am now, but to where I was when I started. I was selling trainers from a van, making mistakes, learning as I went. Youre doing the same thing, just in a different industry with different tools. The principles are identical.</p><p>Our conversation was interrupted by other attendees wanting to speak with Sir Tom, but he handed me his business card and said, Keep building, keep learning, and dont let anyone tell you that small beginnings cant lead to big outcomes. Id love to hear how SnackPDF develops over the next year.</p><p>I left that breakfast feeling completely transformed. The person Id expected to make me feel inadequate had instead provided the most meaningful validation and encouragement Id received since starting SnackPDF. His perspective had reframed my entire understanding of what I was building and where it might lead.</p><p>The experience taught me about the danger of comparing your beginning to someone elses middle or end. Sir Toms current success was the result of decades of work, learning, and growth. Comparing my student project to his established empire was like comparing a seedling to a mature oak tree  theyre at completely different stages of development.</p><p>More importantly, the conversation taught me that successful entrepreneurs often recognise and appreciate the early stages of business development in ways that others might not. Sir Tom understood the significance of generating revenue from real customers, building sustainable systems, and learning through direct experience because hed been through those stages himself.</p><p>The breakfast also highlighted the importance of showing up to opportunities even when you feel unqualified or out of place. Id almost skipped the event because I felt like I didnt belong, but attending had led to one of the most valuable conversations of my entrepreneurial journey.</p><p>Over the following months, I occasionally updated Sir Tom on SnackPDFs progress, and he always responded with encouragement and practical advice. His continued interest in my small business reinforced the lesson that success isnt just about scale  its about solving real problems for real people and building something sustainable.</p><p>The experience also changed how I viewed my own role in Edinburghs entrepreneurial community. Instead of seeing myself as an outsider looking in, I began to understand that I was part of a continuum of people building businesses at different stages and scales. My contribution might be smaller than others, but it was still legitimate and valuable.</p><p>Looking back, that breakfast was a pivotal moment in my development as an entrepreneur. Meeting someone whose success Id admired and receiving his validation and encouragement gave me confidence to continue building SnackPDF with greater ambition and less self-doubt.</p><p>The lesson from that day continues to influence how I approach both business challenges and personal development. Instead of being intimidated by other peoples success, I try to learn from their experience while focusing on my own journey and progress.</p><p>SnackPDF at <a href=\"https://www.snackpdf.com\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://www.snackpdf.com</a> has continued to grow since that breakfast, and I often think about Sir Toms advice when facing difficult decisions or moments of doubt. Sometimes the most valuable thing a successful person can do is remind someone just starting out that everyone begins somewhere, and that small beginnings can lead to significant outcomes.</p><p>That day taught me that heroes arent meant to make you feel small  theyre meant to show you whats possible when you keep building, keep learning, and keep believing in the value of what youre creating.</p><p><em>Im Calum Kerr, a Computer Science student at Edinburgh Napier University building SnackPDF and RevisePDF.

Root cause analysis revealed the new model, while improving overall accuracy, exhibited unexpected conditional dependencies not captured during offline evaluation. This highlighted a critical gap: insufficient tooling to systematically analyze and validate the probabilistic reasoning embedded within Bayesian Networks (BNs) in a production context.  This incident underscores the need for a robust “Bayesian Networks Project” – a holistic approach to building, deploying, scaling, and maintaining BNs as core components of modern ML systems.  BNs are no longer solely research tools; they are increasingly vital for explainability, causal inference, and robust decision-making in complex systems.  This necessitates a shift towards production-grade MLOps practices tailored to their unique characteristics.  This project directly addresses compliance requirements around model transparency and fairness, while simultaneously enabling scalable inference for high-volume applications.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  2. What is a “Bayesian Networks Project” in Modern ML Infrastructure?\n</h3><p>A “Bayesian Networks Project” isn’t simply deploying a BN model. It’s the entire ecosystem surrounding its lifecycle. From a systems perspective, it encompasses data ingestion pipelines feeding the BN’s conditional probability tables (CPTs), the BN structure learning/parameter estimation process, model serving infrastructure, and continuous monitoring of its probabilistic reasoning.  </p><p>It interacts heavily with existing MLOps components:</p><ul><li> For tracking BN structure (graph definition), CPTs (model parameters), and evaluation metrics.  Custom MLflow model flavors are often required to serialize BN structures effectively.</li><li> Orchestrating the BN training pipeline, including data preprocessing, structure learning (if applicable), parameter estimation, and model validation.</li><li>  Distributing the computationally intensive parameter estimation process, especially for large-scale BNs.</li><li> Containerizing and scaling the BN inference service.</li><li> Providing consistent and reliable feature data for real-time inference.  Crucially, feature drift monitoring is paramount for BNs as changes in feature distributions directly impact probabilistic reasoning.</li><li><strong>Cloud ML Platforms (SageMaker, Vertex AI):</strong> Leveraging managed services for model training, deployment, and monitoring, but often requiring custom components for BN-specific tasks.</li></ul><p>Trade-offs center around structure learning vs. expert knowledge elicitation.  Automated structure learning is scalable but can produce less interpretable models.  Expert-defined structures are interpretable but require significant domain expertise and are less adaptable to changing data. System boundaries must clearly define the scope of the BN – what variables are included, and what external factors are considered.  Typical implementation patterns involve a hybrid approach: using expert knowledge to define the core structure and automated learning to refine CPTs.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  3. Use Cases in Real-World ML Systems\n</h3><ul><li><strong>Fraud Detection (Fintech):</strong> BNs model complex relationships between user behavior, transaction details, and external risk factors to identify fraudulent activities.  The probabilistic nature allows for quantifying uncertainty and providing explainable risk scores.</li><li><strong>Personalized Recommendations (E-commerce):</strong>  BNs model user preferences, product attributes, and contextual information to generate personalized recommendations.  They excel at handling sparse data and incorporating causal relationships (e.g., a user buying product A increases the probability of buying product B).</li><li><strong>Predictive Maintenance (Industrial IoT):</strong> BNs model the dependencies between sensor readings, equipment health, and environmental factors to predict equipment failures.  This enables proactive maintenance scheduling and reduces downtime.</li><li><strong>Clinical Diagnosis (Health Tech):</strong> BNs model the relationships between symptoms, medical history, and test results to assist clinicians in making accurate diagnoses.  Explainability is critical in this domain.</li><li> BNs can model the causal effect of different A/B test variations, accounting for confounding factors and providing more robust results than traditional statistical tests.</li></ul><h3>\n  \n  \n  4.

The BN training pipeline (orchestrated by Airflow) triggers structure learning (if applicable) and CPT estimation using distributed computing (Ray). The trained BN is registered in MLflow.  Model serving is handled by a Kubernetes-based service (e.g., using Seldon Core) that exposes a real-time inference API.  Monitoring and observability tools track key metrics and trigger alerts on anomalies.  Traffic shaping (e.g., using Istio) enables canary rollouts and rollback mechanisms.  CI/CD hooks automatically trigger retraining and redeployment upon code changes or data drift detection.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  5.

I know, it pops up everywhere, doesn't it? AI is a powerful tool, from helping us write code faster to building complex systems that handle critical business processes. Like any other tool, it introduces a complete set of challenges. Specifically, we must not forget about <strong>security when we develop with AI</strong>, especially when working with digital identities. Our identity and the identities of our users are our most precious data set, and they need to be protected. This is not just about protecting your users but also about securing the AI itself and the sensitive data it touches.</p><p>You might ask yourself: \"What new identity challenges can AI introduce?\" Or perhaps: \"Are the old security practices still good enough?\" The short answer is: No, not entirely. The AI landscape adds new layers of complexity, and we need to understand them to build truly robust and trustworthy systems. When we speak about AI development, we mean two main scenarios: either you are integrating AI features into existing, more traditional applications (think a chatbot in an e-commerce site, making it \"AI-powered\"), or you are building entirely new systems around AI agents that have greater autonomy and interact with many other services. Both scenarios bring unique demands to the table.</p><p>This is enough reason for me to educate myself and be prepared. I used to learn new concepts by drawing sketch notes, and with this article, I want to share them with you and invite you to learn about security in AI, too. Let’s sketch <a href=\"https://a0.to/ai-content\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">AI security</a>! 🎨</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  New Faces, New IDs: Sketching the AI Identity Landscape\n</h2><p>As a first step, I want to draw our environment. When you develop a traditional application, you primarily manage human identities: The users of your applications log in and grant them access based on who they are. Simple enough, right? However, with AI, things get a bit more interesting. We now have three main types of identities to consider:</p><ul><li>: These are still your users - developers interacting with AI tools, administrators managing AI models, or end-users consuming AI-powered features. The basics of strong authentication and authorization still apply here, but the attack surface might expand as AI tools become gateways to sensitive data.</li><li>: They are self-explanatory at first sight - all identities being non-human but still with a need to be secured. I would still distinguish them between “Machine identities” and “AI Agent Identities” because AIs are more \"free spirits\" than normal services and APIs. This means they are more like a robot with a brain, capable of making decisions. So, let’s zoom in:\n\n<ul><li>: Your backend services, CI/CD pipelines, and compute instances running AI models need identities to interact securely with other services. Think about your model training infrastructure or inference endpoints; they must authenticate to data sources and other APIs.</li><li>: This is the truly new kid on the block! When you work with large language models (LLMs) or build multi-agent systems, these AI entities often need to act on behalf of users or other systems. They might access databases, send emails, or trigger other AI agents. How do you give an AI agent an identity? How do you control what it can do? This is a crucial area.</li></ul></li></ul><p>It is like adding more players to your team; each needs a clear name tag and specific permissions. If you fail to do this, you will have a security-free-for-all in your hands.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  AI's Tricky Foes: A Sketched Look at New Security Risks\n</h2><p>Next, as we know what to protect, let’s see what we’re up against. You already know about SQL injection, XSS, and all the \"classic\" web vulnerabilities. But AI brings its nasty surprises to the party. \nThe first source I love to look at is OWASP. OWASP (short for Open Web Application Security Project) is a volunteer project that helps us raise web security. They are most famous for their ranking of security risks, and along with this, they have rankings for the AI space too:</p><p>Another organization focusing on AI security issues is <a href=\"https://www.mitre.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">MITRE</a>, which has released <a href=\"https://atlas.mitre.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">ATLAS</a> (Adversarial Threat Landscape for Artificial-Intelligence Systems). ATLAS is a living knowledge base of adversary tactics and techniques against AI-enabled systems based on real-world attack observations. The <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.nist.gov/artificial-intelligence/ai-risk-management-framework\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">NIST AI Risk Management Framework</a> provides comprehensive guidance on managing AI risks throughout the lifecycle. Those resources draft a first picture of the biggest enemies we’re about to face.\nLet's zoom in and examine some of your most critical new security challenges. This is like an expanded playground where new rules apply. This is how I envision, thus, draw them:</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Prompt Injection: When Your AI Turns Against You\n</h3><p>This is the most talked-about AI security vulnerability right now. Prompt injection happens when a malicious user crafts an input (a \"prompt\") that tricks an LLM into ignoring its original instructions or performing unintended actions. </p><p>Imagine an AI customer service bot that is supposed to give refunds. I would love to call it “social engineer the LLM” instead of the usual human being. A clever prompt could make it transfer money to the attacker instead. Or, consider an AI-assisted coding tool. A malicious prompt could introduce vulnerabilities into your code. It is like a puppet master pulling strings on your AI.</p><p>The challenge here is that the input is now code for the AI model. The line between data and instruction becomes very blurry. This is also how Credential Access often happens in AI applications; attackers use prompt injection to trick the AI into revealing credentials it has access to, or even to perform actions that expose them. Furthermore, Sensitive Information Disclosure can occur when an AI accidentally (or deliberately, via prompt injection) reveals private user data or confidential business information during its responses. How do you mitigate this? Input validation is a start, but it is not enough. You can consider techniques like <a href=\"https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/instruction-tuning\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">instruction tuning</a>, <a href=\"https://www.confident-ai.com/blog/llm-guardrails-the-ultimate-guide-to-safeguard-llm-systems#what-are-llm-guardrails-\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">guardrails</a>, and multi-stage prompts to sanitize inputs.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Insecure Plugin Design and Excessive Agency: Giving Your AI Too Much Power\n</h3><p>This is a big one, especially with multi-agent systems and applications using external tools or plugins. What do I mean by “plugin” specifically? \"You can extend the capabilities of an LLM by using plugins. Plugins are software components that are called by the LLM to perform specific tasks, such as calling an external service or accessing a resource. Basically, based on the interaction with the user, the LLM calls the plugin to perform some processing or retrieve data. Thus, we are using OWASP and MITRE terminology to define a plugin as a generic approach to extending the functionality of an LLM. Plugins can be implemented through specific LLM methods such as <a href=\"https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/function-calling?api-mode=responses\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">function_calls</a> or <a href=\"https://platform.openai.com/docs/assistants/tools\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">tool_calls</a>.</p><p>Insecure Plugin Design leads to vulnerabilities when these plugins are not correctly secured. Without the proper precautions, an attacker could exploit a plugin to perform unauthorized operations or access data they are not entitled to. </p><p>This can directly lead to , where an attacker gains higher permissions on your AI-powered application by exploiting a vulnerability, often through these insecure plugins or by exploiting the AI's Excessive Agency—meaning, the AI has more permissions than it actually needs. Imagine an AI agent with direct write access to your production database when it only needed read access to a specific table!\nYou must be very careful when designing and securing these interactions. It is about the AI's logic and the security around its tools. These vulnerabilities are clearly outlined in frameworks like the <a href=\"https://owasp.org/www-project-top-10-for-large-language-model-applications/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">OWASP Top 10 for Large Language Model Applications</a>, an excellent resource for deeper dives into AI security.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Data Poisoning: Corrupting the Source\n</h3><p>AI models learn from data. What happens if that data is maliciously tampered with? This is data poisoning. </p><p>An attacker could inject insufficient data into your training sets, leading your AI model to learn incorrect, biased, or malicious behaviors. For example, poisoning a fraud detection model could cause it to miss certain types of fraud or flag legitimate transactions as fraudulent.\nThis is a supply chain attack on your AI model. To prevent this, you need robust data governance, strong access controls over your data pipelines, and rigorous data validation. Trust but verify, always! 🕵️‍♀️</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Model Theft and Evasion Attacks\n</h3><p>Your trained AI model is valuable intellectual property. Attackers might try to steal it or reverse-engineer its logic, which is model theft. </p><p>As an honorable mention, even if not mentioned in the sketch, evasion attacks are interesting in this scenario, too: They involve crafting inputs that cause a deployed AI model to make incorrect predictions without detection. For example, an attacker might modify an image slightly so that a facial recognition system fails to identify them.\nIn both cases, protecting your models involves secure deployment practices, API rate limiting, and potentially techniques like differential privacy during training to obscure model internals.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Building Bulletproof AI: Let's Draw Our Strategy\n</h2><p>So, what can you do about all these new threats and identity complexities? It is not about throwing out your existing security practices but extending and adapting them for the AI age. This means a shift in mindset, putting identity and authorization at the core of your AI architecture, not as an afterthought. Let's break down a practical approach you can take to tackle these challenges and draw our sketches to build a first picture of a secure application.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Who Is Who?: Sketched Identity Management for All AI Players\n</h3><p>First, consider a unified identity solution that can handle humans, machines, and AI agents. </p><p>This often means leveraging an Identity and Access Management (IAM) provider that supports various authentication methods (SSO, OAuth 2.0, mTLS) and fine-grained authorization. For the sake of completeness, this is the default way we handle non-AI identities:</p><ul><li>For Human Users: Implement strong authentication (MFA!) and Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) to ensure users only access the AI tools and data they need.</li><li>For Machine-to-Machine Communication: Use client credentials, service accounts, or workload identities with the principle of least privilege. Machines should only have access to the specific resources required for their tasks.</li></ul><p>This is where it gets interesting for AI agents. Treat AI agents like any other service and assign them unique machine identities. </p><ul><li><strong>Avoid giving your AI-powered application full power by default</strong>. Instead of providing an AI agent direct database access, make it go through a secure API that enforces its permissions. Here, a small but honorable nod to MCP is in order, which I’d cover in another article - or in <a href=\"https://auth0.com/blog/mcp-and-auth0-an-agentic-match-made-in-heaven/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">this blog post</a>, if you’re already interested. 🔥\n\n<ul><li><strong>Let the application work on behalf of the user</strong>. When accessing sensitive data or performing actions, the application needs to act on behalf of the user, inheriting the user's permissions or, better yet, obtaining a delegation of those permissions, as is done with OAuth, for example. Implement an authorization layer specifically for your agents. </li></ul></li></ul><p>You can think of it like this: The AI agent asks for something, and your system checks if that agent is allowed to do that action for that specific user. To extend a little on that, it’s still important to <a href=\"https://auth0.com/blog/secure-human-in-the-loop-interactions-for-ai-agents/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">keep the human in the loop</a> as well, at least for high-risk operations or highly sensitive data. However, this is a topic for its own blog post, so I won’t go into details just now.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  The Fortified Flow: Sketching Secure Data &amp; Model Pipelines\n</h3><p>Your data is the lifeline of your AI. Securing it end-to-end is non-negotiable: It shows up in rank 2 of the <a href=\"https://owasp.org/www-project-top-10-for-large-language-model-applications/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">OWASP LLM top 10</a> and indirectly in rank 1, resulting from prompt injection, too. So, let’s sketch out the strategy for securing your data pipeline:</p><ul><li><strong>Secure Data Ingestion and Storage</strong>: Ensure all data used for training and inference is encrypted at rest and in transit. Implement strict access controls on your data lakes and databases. \nMake sure you are using only the data you actually need. If you specialize your application using fine-tuning or Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), be sure to provide only the minimum information you really need. If personal information is not needed, anonymize or delete it. This is a crucial step to prevent Sensitive Information Disclosure and reduce the attack surface.</li><li><strong>Data Validation and Sanitization</strong>: Please always validate data rigorously before it is used for training. Look for anomalies, suspicious patterns, or potential signs of poisoning.</li><li>: Training is crucial and needs to be highlighted, see data poisoning. </li><li><strong>Model Versioning and Auditing</strong>: Track every version of your model. Who trained it? What data was used? This provides an audit trail if a vulnerability is discovered later.</li><li>: Deploy your AI models in isolated environments. Use containerization and orchestration platforms that provide built-in security features. Apply the principle of least privilege to your models' runtime environments.\nIn my sketch notes, I depicted the protection of the data pipeline as seen below:</li></ul><h3>\n  \n  \n  Blocking the Bad: Sketched Defenses Against AI Attacks\n</h3><p>This is where you directly combat prompt injection, data poisoning, and model evasion.</p><ul><li><strong>Input Sanitization and Validation</strong>: While not a silver bullet, always validate and sanitize user inputs before they reach your LLMs or other AI models. Use allow-lists where possible. This is your first line of defense against prompt injection, which can lead to credential access or sensitive information disclosure. </li><li><strong>Monitoring and Anomaly Detection</strong> inside your AI model: Monitor your AI systems closely. How do you think about monitoring for unusual behavior? If a model suddenly starts making wildly different predictions or consuming excessive resources, it could indicate an attack.</li><li><strong>Instruction Tuning and Guardrails</strong>: For LLMs, reinforce desired behaviors through instruction tuning. Implement \"guardrails\", basically external mechanisms (could be another LLM, a rule-based system, or human review) that validate the AI's output before it reaches the end-user or triggers an action. This is like a bouncer for your AI's responses.</li><li>: Always validate your AI's output. If an AI agent generates SQL queries, validate those queries before execution. If it produces code, scan that code for vulnerabilities. This helps prevent the AI from causing unintended consequences due to insecure outputs or even insecure plugin design.\nImagine those steps as protective layers around the AI, building on one another. In a sketch, these direct defences would look like this:</li></ul><p><a href=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2F9efi6ycozi2jj1tuulfj.jpg\"><img src=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2F9efi6ycozi2jj1tuulfj.jpg\" alt=\"A sketchnote flow diagram showing \" width=\"800\" height=\"499\"></a> \"Sanitization/Validation\" -&gt; \"AI Model\" -&gt; \"Guardrails/Output Validation\" -&gt; \"Secure Action,\" emphasizing the security layers around the AI\"/&gt;</p><p>One addition to note, which is important but didn’t fit the sketch: Please avoid using API keys to call external services. When an application uses an API key to access external functionality, such as an API, it exposes itself to potential security risks. This way, unauthorized users may send specific prompts and perform operations or access data they are not authorized to do. You can counter that: For example, you can use OAuth access tokens to restrict the application's permissions. This can reduce those risks significantly, as tokens can be scoped, short-lived, and tied to user context.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  The big picture: Key Takeaways for AI Security\n</h2><p>Developing with AI is exciting! 🔥 However, we cannot ignore the fact that AI introduces some challenges as well, especially for identity and security in general. By proactively managing identities for humans, machines, and AI agents, and by understanding and mitigating threats like prompt injection, data poisoning, sensitive information disclosure, and insecure plugin designs, you can build AI applications that are not only powerful but also incredibly secure. Let’s take a look at our result of the drawing, these are the full sketch notes:</p><p>Please keep it as a cheatsheet. And never forget: It is a journey, not a destination, so stay curious, keep learning, and make your AI bulletproof! As you probably know, I provided you with an overview in this article. While learning and crafting sketchnotes to document, I went into much more detail on any of these points. Are you interested in those sketch notes, too?

Built on the same foundational technology as the Gemini family, Gemma 3n is optimized to run seamlessly on low-resource devices while offering advanced capabilities typically reserved for much larger models. With support for multimodal inputs, text, image, audio, and video, Gemma 3n stands out as a lightweight yet powerful model for developers and researchers who want high performance without heavy hardware requirements. One of its key innovations is selective parameter activation, a modern technique that reduces active compute load by only activating the most relevant parts of the model per input. This allows it to perform like a 2B or 4B parameter model while maintaining a much smaller effective footprint. Plus, with a whopping 32K context window and pre-trained + instruction-tuned versions openly available, Gemma 3n is tailor-made for tasks like summarization, multimodal Q&amp;A, image or audio analysis, and more, across 140+ languages.</p><p>In this article, we'll cover a step-by-step process to setup and run this model end to end either locally or GPU accelerated environments. </p><p>The minimum system requirements for running this model are:</p><ul><li><p>GPU: 1x RTX 4090 or 1x RTX A6000</p></li><li><p>Storage: 50GB (preferable)</p></li></ul><h2>\n  \n  \n  Step-by-step process to install and run Gemma 3n\n</h2><p>For the purpose of this tutorial, we’ll use a GPU-powered Virtual Machine by NodeShift since it provides high compute Virtual Machines at a very affordable cost on a scale that meets GDPR, SOC2, and ISO27001 requirements. Also, it offers an intuitive and user-friendly interface, making it easier for beginners to get started with Cloud deployments. However, feel free to use any cloud provider of your choice and follow the same steps for the rest of the tutorial.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Step 1: Setting up a NodeShift Account\n</h3><p>Visit <a href=\"https://app.nodeshift.com/sign-up\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">app.nodeshift.com</a> and create an account by filling in basic details, or continue signing up with your Google/GitHub account.</p><p>If you already have an account, <a href=\"http://app.nodeshift.com\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">login</a> straight to your dashboard.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Step 2: Create a GPU Node\n</h3><p>After accessing your account, you should see a dashboard (see image), now:</p><p>1) Navigate to the menu on the left side.</p><p>2) Click on the&nbsp;&nbsp;option.</p><p>3) Click on  to start creating your very first GPU node.</p><p>These GPU nodes are GPU-powered virtual machines by NodeShift. These nodes are highly customizable and let you control different environmental configurations for GPUs ranging from H100s to A100s, CPUs, RAM, and storage, according to your needs.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Step 3: Selecting configuration for GPU (model, region,&nbsp;storage)\n</h3><p>1) For this tutorial, we’ll be using 1x A100 SXM4 GPU, however, you can choose any GPU as per the prerequisites.</p><p>2) Similarly, we’ll opt for 100GB storage by sliding the bar. You can also select the region where you want your GPU to reside from the available ones.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Step 4: Choose GPU Configuration and Authentication method\n</h3><p>1) After selecting your required configuration options, you’ll see the available GPU nodes in your region and according to (or very close to) your configuration. In our case, we’ll choose a 2x A100 80GB GPU node with 32vCPUs/131GB RAM/100GB SSD.</p><p>2) Next, you'll need to select an authentication method. Two methods are available: Password and SSH Key. We recommend using SSH keys, as they are a more secure option. To create one, head over to our <a href=\"https://docs.nodeshift.com/gpus/create-gpu-deployment\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">official documentation</a>.</p><p>The final step is to choose an image for the VM, which in our case is .</p><p>That's it! You are now ready to deploy the node. Finalize the configuration summary, and if it looks good, click  to deploy the node.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Step 6: Connect to active Compute Node using SSH\n</h3><p>1) As soon as you create the node, it will be deployed in a few seconds or a minute. Once deployed, you will see a status  in green, meaning that our Compute node is ready to use!</p><p>2) Once your GPU shows this status, navigate to the three dots on the right, click on , and copy the SSH details that appear.</p><p>As you copy the details, follow the below steps to connect to the running GPU VM via SSH:</p><p>1) Open your terminal, paste the SSH command, and run it.</p><p>2) In some cases, your terminal may take your consent before connecting. Enter ‘yes’.</p><p>3) A prompt will request a password. Type the SSH password, and you should be connected.</p><p>Next, If you want to check the GPU details, run the following command in the terminal:</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Step 7: Set up the project environment with dependencies\n</h3><p>1) Create a virtual environment using <a href=\"https://nodeshift.com/blog/set-up-anaconda-on-ubuntu-22-04-in-minutes-simplify-your-ai-workflow\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Anaconda</a>.</p><div><pre><code>conda create -n gemma python=3.11 -y &amp;&amp; conda activate gemma\n</code></pre></div><p>2) Once you're inside the environment, install necessary dependencies to run the model.</p><div><pre><code>pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu121\npip install -U transformers\npip install huggingface_hub\npip install sentencepiece bitsandbytes protobuf numpy einops timm pillow\n</code></pre></div><p>3) Login to Hugging Face CLI with  access token.</p><p>(Enter your  access token when prompted)</p><p>4) Install and run jupyter notebook.</p><div><pre><code>conda install -c conda-forge --override-channels notebook -y\nconda install -c conda-forge --override-channels ipywidgets -y\njupyter notebook --allow-root\n</code></pre></div><p>4) If you're on a remote machine (e.g., NodeShift GPU), you'll need to do SSH port forwarding in order to access the jupyter notebook session on your local browser.</p><p>Run the following command in your local terminal after replacing:</p><p> with the PORT allotted to your remote server (For the NodeShift server - you can find it in the deployed GPU details on the dashboard).</p><p> with the path to the location where your SSH key is stored.</p><p> with the IP address of your remote server.</p><div><pre><code>ssh -L 8888:localhost:8888 -p &lt;YOUR_SERVER_PORT&gt; -i &lt;PATH_TO_SSH_KEY&gt; root@&lt;YOUR_SERVER_IP&gt;\n</code></pre></div><p>After this copy the URL you received in your remote server:</p><p>And paste this on your local browser to access the Jupyter Notebook session.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Step 8: Download and Run the model\n</h3><p>1) Open a Python notebook inside Jupyter.</p><p>2) Download model checkpoints and run the model for inference.</p><div><pre><code>from transformers import pipeline\nimport torch\nfrom PIL import Image \n\npipe = pipeline(\n    \"image-text-to-text\",\n    model=\"google/gemma-3n-e2b-it\",\n    device=\"cuda\",\n    torch_dtype=torch.bfloat16,\n)\n</code></pre></div><p>3) Run the model for your inference.</p><div><pre><code>image = Image.open(\"./gemma3n-test.jpg\").convert(\"RGB\")\nprompt = \"What's in the image?\"\n\nmessages = [\n    {\n        \"role\": \"system\",\n        \"content\": [{\"type\": \"text\", \"text\": \"You are a helpful assistant.\"}]\n    },\n    {\n        \"role\": \"user\",\n        \"content\": [\n            {\"type\": \"image\", \"image\": image},\n            {\"type\": \"text\", \"text\": prompt}\n        ]\n    }\n]\n\noutput = pipe(text=messages, max_new_tokens=200)\nprint(output[0][\"generated_text\"][-1][\"content\"])\n</code></pre></div><p>Gemma 3n shows the future of efficient AI, offering multimodal capabilities, selective parameter activation, and an expansive 32K context window, all while remaining lightweight enough for low-resource environments.

Root cause analysis revealed the update, while improving individual feature performance, disrupted the conditional dependencies modeled by our underlying Bayesian network. This resulted in a cascade of incorrect inferences, impacting customer experience and requiring manual intervention. This incident underscored the necessity of treating Bayesian networks not merely as modeling tools, but as core infrastructure components requiring rigorous MLOps practices. Bayesian networks are integral to the entire ML system lifecycle, from initial data exploration and feature engineering (identifying causal relationships) to model deployment, monitoring, and eventual deprecation. Their ability to represent and reason with uncertainty makes them crucial for applications demanding explainability, robustness, and adaptability – increasingly important in regulated industries and for scalable inference demands.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  2. What is Bayesian Networks in Modern ML Infrastructure?\n</h3><p>From a systems perspective, a Bayesian network (BN) is a probabilistic graphical model representing a set of variables and their conditional dependencies via a directed acyclic graph (DAG). In modern ML infrastructure, BNs aren’t simply static models; they’re dynamic knowledge bases integrated with data pipelines, feature stores, and inference services.  </p><ul><li> BN structure and parameters are versioned as MLflow models, enabling reproducibility and rollback.</li><li>  BN training and updating are orchestrated as DAGs, triggered by data freshness or performance degradation.</li><li>  Inference can be distributed across a cluster for low-latency predictions, particularly for complex networks.</li><li> BN inference services are containerized and deployed on Kubernetes, leveraging autoscaling and rolling updates.</li><li>  BNs consume features from a feature store, ensuring consistency between training and inference.</li><li><strong>Cloud ML Platforms (SageMaker, Vertex AI):</strong>  BN training and deployment can be managed through these platforms, leveraging their managed services.</li></ul><p>Trade-offs involve the computational cost of inference (especially for densely connected networks) versus the benefits of explainability and robustness. System boundaries must clearly define the scope of the BN – which variables are included, and how external factors are handled. Typical implementation patterns include using libraries like  or  in Python, coupled with a serving layer built using Flask or FastAPI.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  3. Use Cases in Real-World ML Systems\n</h3><ul><li><strong>A/B Testing &amp; Multi-Armed Bandit Algorithms:</strong> BNs can model user behavior and treatment effects, providing a more nuanced understanding of A/B test results than simple statistical tests.</li><li><strong>Model Rollout &amp; Canary Analysis:</strong>  BNs can predict the impact of a new model version on downstream metrics, enabling safer and more controlled rollouts.  They can quantify the risk of performance degradation.</li><li><strong>Policy Enforcement &amp; Risk Assessment (Fintech):</strong>  BNs model complex regulatory requirements and assess the risk associated with financial transactions, ensuring compliance.</li><li><strong>Personalized Recommendations (E-commerce):</strong>  BNs capture user preferences and product relationships, improving recommendation accuracy and diversity.</li><li><strong>Predictive Maintenance (Autonomous Systems):</strong>  BNs model the dependencies between sensor readings and component failures, enabling proactive maintenance scheduling.</li></ul><h3>\n  \n  \n  4.

Traffic shaping is implemented using a service mesh (Istio, Linkerd).</li></ol><h3>\n  \n  \n  5. Implementation Strategies\n</h3><p><strong>Python Orchestration (BN Training):</strong></p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p><strong>Kubernetes Deployment (YAML):</strong></p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p><strong>Experiment Tracking (Bash):</strong></p><div><pre><code>mlflow runs create \nmlflow run  python train_bn.py\n</code></pre></div><h3>\n  \n  \n  6. Failure Modes &amp; Risk Management\n</h3><ul><li>  BNs can become outdated as data distributions shift. Mitigation: Automated retraining pipelines triggered by data drift detection.</li><li>  Discrepancies between training and inference feature distributions. Mitigation: Feature monitoring and data validation.</li><li>  Complex networks or high query volumes can lead to latency spikes. Mitigation: Caching, batching, and autoscaling.</li><li><strong>Incorrect Structure Learning:</strong>  The learned BN structure may not accurately reflect the underlying causal relationships. Mitigation: Expert review and sensitivity analysis.</li><li>  Parameter estimation can be unstable with sparse data. Mitigation: Regularization techniques and robust estimation methods.</li></ul><p>Alerting should be configured for key metrics (latency, throughput, prediction accuracy, feature drift). Circuit breakers can prevent cascading failures. Automated rollback mechanisms should be in place to revert to a previous stable version.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  7. Performance Tuning &amp; System Optimization\n</h3><ul><li> Optimize inference code, use caching, and leverage hardware acceleration (GPUs).</li><li>  Batch requests, distribute inference across a cluster (Ray, Dask), and optimize network bandwidth.</li><li><strong>Model Accuracy vs. Infra Cost:</strong>  Balance model complexity with infrastructure costs.  Consider model pruning or simplification techniques.</li><li>  Process multiple inference requests in a single batch to reduce overhead.</li><li>  Cache frequently accessed predictions to reduce latency.</li><li>  Utilize vectorized operations for faster computation.</li><li>  Dynamically adjust the number of inference service replicas based on demand.</li><li>  Identify performance bottlenecks using profiling tools.</li></ul><h3>\n  \n  \n  8. Monitoring, Observability &amp; Debugging\n</h3><ul><li> Collect metrics on latency, throughput, error rates, and resource utilization.</li><li> Visualize metrics and create dashboards for real-time monitoring.</li><li>  Instrument code for distributed tracing and observability.</li><li>  Monitor data drift and model performance.</li><li>  Comprehensive monitoring and alerting platform.</li></ul><p>Critical metrics:  Inference latency (P90, P95), throughput, prediction accuracy, feature drift, data completeness, and resource utilization. Alert conditions should be defined for anomalies in these metrics. Log traces should provide detailed information about inference requests and errors.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  9. Security, Policy &amp; Compliance\n</h3><ul><li>  Log all access to the BN model and data.</li><li>  Ensure that BN training and inference are reproducible.</li><li><strong>Secure Model/Data Access:</strong>  Implement access control policies to restrict access to sensitive data and models.</li><li>  OPA (Open Policy Agent) for policy enforcement, IAM (Identity and Access Management) for access control, Vault for secret management, and ML metadata tracking for lineage and auditability.</li></ul><h3>\n  \n  \n  10. CI/CD &amp; Workflow Integration\n</h3><ul><li><strong>GitHub Actions/GitLab CI/Jenkins:</strong>  Automate BN training, testing, and deployment.</li><li><strong>Argo Workflows/Kubeflow Pipelines:</strong>  Orchestrate complex ML pipelines, including BN training and deployment.</li></ul><p>Deployment gates should be implemented to ensure that new BN versions meet predefined quality criteria. Automated tests should verify model accuracy, data validation, and performance. Rollback logic should be in place to revert to a previous stable version in case of failure.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  11. Common Engineering Pitfalls\n</h3><ul><li><strong>Ignoring Conditional Independence Assumptions:</strong>  Incorrectly assuming independence between variables can lead to inaccurate inferences.</li><li><strong>Overfitting the BN Structure:</strong>  Learning a complex structure that doesn't generalize well to new data.</li><li>  Estimating BN parameters with limited data can lead to unreliable predictions.</li><li>  Failing to account for feedback loops between variables can lead to biased predictions.</li><li>  Deploying a BN without adequate monitoring can result in undetected failures.</li></ul><p>Debugging workflows should include examining log traces, visualizing the BN structure, and analyzing feature distributions.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  12. Best Practices at Scale\n</h3><p>Mature ML platforms (Michelangelo, Cortex) emphasize:</p><ul><li>  Distributed inference, model sharding, and caching.</li><li>  Multi-tenancy to support multiple teams and applications.</li><li><strong>Operational Cost Tracking:</strong>  Monitoring and optimizing infrastructure costs.</li><li>  Defining clear stages of maturity for ML systems.</li></ul><p>Integrating BNs into a robust ML platform requires a focus on automation, observability, and scalability.  The business impact of BNs should be clearly defined and tracked.</p><p>Bayesian networks are powerful tools for building robust, explainable, and adaptable ML systems. However, successful production deployment requires a systems-level approach, encompassing rigorous MLOps practices, comprehensive monitoring, and proactive risk management.  Next steps include benchmarking BN inference performance against alternative models, integrating automated structure learning into the CI/CD pipeline, and conducting regular security audits.  Investing in these areas will unlock the full potential of Bayesian networks and drive significant business value.</p>","contentLength":9913,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"⚡ Introducing CORE - open source, shareable, user-owned memory graph for LLMs","url":"https://dev.to/heysolhq/introducing-core-open-source-shareable-user-owned-memory-graph-for-llms-570m","date":1751381518,"author":"Manik Aggarwal","guid":178992,"unread":true,"content":"<p>Are you wasting time re-explaining yourself dozens of times a day, just to keep ChatGPT, Cursor, and Claude on the same page? </p><p>ChatGPT might recall your project details, but Cursor forgets them, and Claude starts from scratch every time. </p><p>An open source, shareable knowledge graph (your memory vault) that lets any LLM (ChatGPT, Cursor, Claude, SOL, etc.) share and query the same persistent context.</p><p>✅ Shareable\n✅ Relational - Every fact gets a full version history (who, when,      why)<p>\n✅ 100% owned by you: Your memory data, you decide what to store and retrieve.</p></p><p> - Copy the example environment file to .env:</p><p> -  Use Docker Compose to start all required services:</p><p> -  Access the app\nOnce the containers are running, open your browser and go to <a href=\"http://localhost:3000\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">http://localhost:3000</a>.</p><p> -  Login with Magic Link</p><ul><li>Choose the \"Magic Link\" login option.</li><li>Copy the magic link from terminal logs and open it in your browser.</li></ul><p> - Create Your Private Space &amp; Ingest Data</p><ul><li>In the dashboard, go to the ingest section.</li><li>Type a message, e.g., I love playing badminton, and click \"Add\".</li><li>Your memory is queued for processing; you can monitor its status in - the server logs.</li><li>Once processing is complete, nodes will be added to your private knowledge graph and visible in the dashboard.</li><li>You can later choose to connect this memory to other tools or keep it private.</li></ul><p> - Search Your Memory\nUse the dashboard's search feature to query your ingested data within your private space.</p><blockquote><p>Note: We are actively working on improving support for Llama models.

In it, he listed 12 steps to take if you don’t want to end up with AI spaghetti you’ll be cleaning up all week.</p><p>A tool that requires a 12-step guide for avoiding disastrous spaghetti code might be fine if you’re vibe coding a hobby project or on a team of mostly senior devs who can catch and edit out the spaghetti, but imagine what a junior developer could do to a legacy codebase in a highly regulated Fortune 500 company!</p><p>In addition to more bugs and issues, we’re also hearing that AI coding tools have created bottlenecks at other points of the development cycle.</p><p>It goes without saying that if you’re writing more code, you have to review more code, test more code, document more code, and refactor more code. Very quickly, your ‘game-changing’ AI productivity gains get held up at other manual parts of the development cycle. And that work can be harder and more time consuming given AI-generated code’s tendency to have more issues.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  A new way to code = A new tech stack\n</h2><p>That’s why many devs have come to an important realization this year: You can’t just introduce a transformative technology and leave the rest of the software development cycle intact. You need an end-to-end AI dev tool tech stack.</p><p>It’s common for disruptive technologies to spark broader ecosystem changes. A great example is how GitHub’s 2008 launch resulted in the launch of both Circle CI and Jenkins three years later. AI coding tools seem to be following an even faster timeline.</p><p>After a few years of using them, engineering leaders have realized that AI coding tools help sometimes but hurt sometimes, too. To actually realize the promised productivity gains, they need additional tools for the downstream tasks they create or make more difficult.</p><p>But this shift to thinking about AI adoption as a stack is also about using the same approach of leveraging AI to boost productivity that worked for code generation for other manual tasks. Why not review faster and test faster if you’re coding faster? Especially since almost no one loves reviewing code or writing tests?</p><p>In some cases, the ROI of leveraging AI at other stages of development might even be higher than what AI coding assistants deliver. That’s because those AI tools work to remove bugs from code rather than adding them in.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  What’s in the AI dev tool tech stack?\n</h2><p>The AI dev tool stacks we’re seeing our customers adopt are a layered set of AI tools that support every stage of the software development lifecycle.</p><p>Here’s a quick look at the layers of that stack, how they fit together, and why you’ll probably be using most of them by the end of this year – if you aren’t already.</p><ul><li>Foundational: AI coding tools</li><li>Essential layer: AI code review tools</li><li>Optional layer: AI QA test tools</li><li>Optional layer: AI refactoring tools</li><li>Optional layer: AI documentation tools</li></ul><h3>\n  \n  \n  Foundational: AI coding tools\n</h3><p>This is where most teams start. These tools help developers write code faster – either by suggesting autocompletes of what you’re currently writing or by generating entire functions, tests, or components based on natural language prompts. Over time, they’ve become more sophisticated with deeper codebase awareness, a greater commitment to code quality, and a recent focus on agentic, multi-step tasks. But these tools are still notorious for introducing bugs, vulnerabilities, and performance inefficiencies into code. That translates into developers doing a lot more code editing and reviewing.</p><p>Increasingly, we’re hearing two things. First, devs aren’t just using one tool but often leveraging multiple tools based on what each tool is best at (a process satirized in this <a href=\"https://x.com/aidenybai/status/1913634950236291562\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">tweet</a>). Second, devs are increasingly opinionated about which tool or tools they want to use – with the choice of an AI coding assistant becoming as divisive as whether to use a PC or a Mac.</p><p>That’s led many teams to start giving developers a choice around AI assistants rather than choosing just one to buy licenses for. Given that they’re likely to also be more effective at using the tool they prefer, that benefits companies, too.</p><p>We break these tools into five categories – though many tools span multiple categories.</p><p>Tab completion tools: GitHub Copilot, Cursor Tab, Windsurf, TabNine, Sourcegraph Cody, Qodo, Jetbrains</p><p>AI coding assistants: GitHub Copilot, Cursor, , Windsurf, Claude Code, OpenAI Codex CLI, Zed, Cody by Sourcegraph, Aider, Qodo, Cline, Roocode, Blackbox, OpenHands, Gemini Code Assist, Augment Code, Amazon Q, JetBrains AI Assistant</p><p>Agentic coding tools: Cursor, Windsurf, GitHub Copilot, Claude Code, OpenAI Codex, Cline, Roocode, Blackbox AI, Continue, Devin, Jules, Augment Code, OpenHands</p><p>AI app generator tools: Lovable, v0, Bolt, Builder.io, Figma Make, Fine.dev, Stitch</p><p>Codebase context tools: Repomix, Repo Prompt, Context7</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Essential layer: AI code review tools\n</h3><p>AI code review tools sit at the center of the stack because they directly address the biggest bottleneck introduced by AI coding tools: the review process. If your code is getting written faster — and more often — by machines then you need a better way to review it.</p><p>Trying to manually review increasingly more code as a team isn’t just a recipe for burnout, it also risks <a href=\"https://www.atlassian.com/blog/add-ons/code-review-best-practices\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">quality degradation</a>. Research shows that most devs can only manually review up to ~400 lines of code before fatigue sets in. That fatigue could mean devs miss more critical bugs then have to address them in production.</p><p>Indeed, code review tools don’t just help you merge PRs up to 4x faster and reduce the time you spend reviewing by up to 50%. They are also essential in AI-assisted development to keep bugs from production given that AI coding tools have been found to add up to <a href=\"https://resources.uplevelteam.com/gen-ai-for-coding\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">41% more bugs</a> to code. Using them protects your AI productivity savings by ensuring no bad code ends up in production.</p><p>AI code reviews also help improve code quality, reduce reviewer fatigue, and standardize best practices across teams no matter which AI coding assistants your team members are using. Unlike code generation and agentic coding tools, their output isn’t wildly inconsistent since it doesn’t depend on the AI competency of any individual developer to know how to prompt them.</p><p>But, perhaps more importantly, they leverage AI for what it’s best at – automating repetitive and tedious tasks devs don’t want to do. Who wants to spend an hour adding a dozen comments to a PR when AI can add most of those comments for you, give you easy 1-click fixes for each of them, and find bugs you might have missed?</p><p>These tools come in three main flavors:</p><ul><li>Features of an AI coding tool: Cursor, GitHub Copilot, JetBrains, Windsurf Forge (deprecated)</li><li>Git-based AI code review tools: CodeRabbit, Bito, Greptile, Qodo, Graphite Diamond</li><li>Both IDE and git-based AI code review tools: CodeRabbit, SonarQube, Qodo, Sourcery</li></ul><h3>\n  \n  \n  Optional layer: AI QA test generation &amp; execution tools\n</h3><p>For many dev teams, QA testing has long included some form of AI. But a new generation of AI-powered QA tools promise to automate even more of the grunt work – especially around generating and maintaining tedious end-to-end tests that simulate real user journeys. Instead of manually thinking up every scenario, you can let an AI generate test cases or even entire test scripts from a natural language description of what needs to be checked.</p><p>The benefits are hard to ignore. The most important is speed – they can churn out or execute suites of tests in a fraction of the time and generate dozens of scenarios at once. However, they also help achieve greater breadth of coverage by running through permutations a human might overlook or not have time for.. Some even offer self-healing capabilities to adjust tests when your UI or data changes, reducing maintenance headaches and keeping your test suite running smoothly as the app evolves.</p><p>We break these down into two categories:</p><ul><li>AI test generation tools: Testim, Mabl, Functionalize, testRigor, Autify, ACCELQ, Qodex, Tricentis</li><li>AI test execution and maintenance tools: MuukTest, Applietools, Sauce Labs, Perfecto, Meticulous</li></ul><h3>\n  \n  \n  Optional layer: AI Refactoring tools\n</h3><p>While some AI coding tools claim they can be used for refactoring, their results are often lackluster. For that reason, many companies adopt AI tools created explicitly for refactoring code as part of their AI dev tool tech stack after they’ve had bad experiences attempting to use coding tools for that use case.</p><p>AI-powered refactoring tools promise to automate the tedious and repetitive aspects of improving your codebase from minor optimizations to significant architectural changes. Instead of spending hours manually hunting down inefficiencies or repeating the same structural tweaks across your codebase, these AI tools quickly identify and even execute refactoring opportunities from a simple natural-language description.</p><p>We divide these tools into two types:</p><ul><li>Semi-automated tools: CodeGPT, GitHub Copilot, Amazon CodeWhisperer, Sourcegraph Cody</li><li>Fully automated tools: Claude Code, Devin, OpenAI Codex</li></ul><h3>\n  \n  \n  Optional layer: AI documentation tools\n</h3><p>While docs are never the first thing that teams think about when adopting AI, it’s one task that they appreciate getting help with when they do. These tools tackle one of coding’s most dreaded tasks—writing and updating code documentation like inline comments to docstrings. Instead of manually documenting every new function or combing through outdated guides, devs can let AI tools quickly draft readable, up-to-date documentation directly from the code itself, saving countless hours of tedious work.</p><p>Code-level docs tools: DeepWiki, Cursor, CodeRabbit, Swimm, GitLoop, GitSummarize</p><p>So, what do some of these AI dev tool tech stacks look like? We’ve seen a range of configurations from company to company but here are some common stacks teams are using.</p><p>There’s a growing group of companies we encounter who have implemented or are in the process of implementing an end-to-end AI dev tool stack that includes an AI-powered coding tool, code review tool, QA tool, refactor tool, and docs tool.</p><p>These are typically companies where there’s been significant internal leadership around AI adoption either from the C-Suite or engineering. They were also often early adopters of AI coding tools and have already seen their benefits so are looking for additional AI productivity and DevEx gains.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  ‘Choose-your-own-AI-tool’ stack\n</h3><p>We are increasingly seeing companies that are implementing AI tools throughout the development cycle AND giving their team more choice as to which tools they use. These companies understand (or have learned the hard way) that different AI tools are best suited for different kinds of work and that the best AI tool for any developer is the one they feel most comfortable prompting.</p><p>This strategy hasn’t just anecdotally helped increase AI adoption but it’s also improved developer satisfaction and experience at these companies. That’s because, increasingly, developers are opinionated about which tool they use. Some companies offer developers choice over just their AI coding tool (Cursor, Copilot, or Claude Code?) while others will offer devs choice over other tools in the stack, as well.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  ‘Multiple coding tools’ stack\n</h3><p>Not to be outdone by the companies that let developers choose their own AI tools are the companies that let devs choose multiple AI coding tools. Maybe they use Lovable for prototyping UI and then Cursor to write the app. Or they use TabNine for code completion and ChatGPT for code generation. More companies are saying yes to developers using more than one tool if they can make the case for why it will improve their productivity.</p><p>Not all companies that we’re seeing building an AI dev tool stack are adopting all the tools in the stack. Typically, however, their stacks involve an AI coding tool, an AI code review tool, and another AI tool from our list – be that an AI refactoring tool, an AI QA tool, or an AI docs tool. Which they adopt often depends on their codebase, internal expertise, and needs. </p><p>For example, larger companies are more likely to adopt AI QA tools since they have a large enough team internally to manage QA whereas smaller companies are more likely to mostly outsource QA to contractors and agencies.</p><p>Finally, we see a lot of companies building just an ‘essential’ stack which includes just an AI coding tool and an AI code review tool to help navigate the added bugs and more complicated code reviews that typically result from using coding assistants. Code review tools also have some of the highest ROI of any AI tools – including AI coding tools – since they both save significant time and keep bugs out of production.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Building your own AI dev tool stack: What to consider\n</h2><p>When it comes to building an AI dev tool stack, we’ve seen a number of approaches. Many adopted AI coding tools and then iteratively looked for individual solutions to the problems those tools created as downstream issues became particularly painful.</p><p>Other companies took a more intentional approach with CTOs or other technical leaders investigating tools that could improve the development cycle and running proof-of-concept tests to see whether they actually deliver results. Some even waited to adopt AI coding tools and leveraged AI code review tools to address their existing code review backlogs first.</p><p>We recommend a proactive approach since we often see teams suffering from delayed milestones and dev burnout before they start looking for solutions.</p><p>Want more info about what we’ve been seeing around AI adoption of specific tools? We have <a href=\"http://www.coderabbit.ai/blog/ai-adoption-how-developers-are-using-ai-dev-tools\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">another post here</a> where we go into greater details about the different types of tools in each category and how we’re seeing them helping engineering teams.</p><p>We’d love to hear more about how you’re building your AI dev tool stack and what’s working for you.

Buckle up, because I'm about to take you on a wild ride – our journey building  for the Bolt Hackathon. Was it smooth sailing? Absolutely not. Was it epic? You bet your <code>git commit -m \"final final final\"</code> it was. And yes, there might be some  exaggerations, but I promise, the core truth is always just a semicolon away.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  🚀 The Spark of Genius (or, How We Avoided Total Brain Drain)\n</h3><p>The idea for QuantaCode hit us like a perfectly formatted, lint-free commit: developers spend half their lives wrestling with messy code, debugging nightmares, and trying to figure out if their codebase is more \"pristine garden\" or \"dumpster fire after a coding convention argument.\" We thought, \"What if we could get  in code analysis?\" (Okay, maybe the \"quantum-level\" part was a  exaggeration, but we definitely aimed for deep insights!) We dreamed of an AI that didn't just tell you  was wrong, but , and even talked to you about it. Voice-powered code analysis? Madness! But the good kind of madness. This vision pushed us to explore the bleeding edge of AI integration in developer tooling, aiming for something truly transformative.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  🎯 What We Cooked Up (Spoiler: It's Pretty Cool)\n</h3><p>So, what exactly is this mythical beast, QuantaCode? It's an <strong>AI-powered codebase health management platform</strong>. Think of it as your code's personal, highly intelligent, and slightly judgmental doctor, always ready to give you a check-up and prescribe improvements.</p><p><strong>Core Features (The Good Stuff):</strong></p><ul><li>: We fed OpenAI GPT-4 all the code it could eat, and it spat out insights on quality, security, and maintainability. It's like having a super-senior architect review your entire repo in seconds. (Okay, maybe not , but definitely faster than a human, and without the passive-aggressive comments!) Our AI delves into code patterns, potential anti-patterns, and even documentation gaps to provide a holistic view.</li></ul><ul><li>: This is where the magic (and a bit of ElevenLabs wizardry) happens. You can literally  to your codebase and get audio summaries. Imagine asking, \"Hey QuantaCode, what's the biggest issue in my  module?\" and getting a coherent, spoken answer. Free users get a charmingly robotic voice; premium users get a voice so natural, you'll wonder if your code is flirting with you. This feature was designed to make complex analysis accessible and interactive.</li></ul><ul><li><p>: Because nobody likes surprises, especially when it's a critical bug lurking in production. QuantaCode keeps a vigilant eye on your repository, alerting you to changes in health metrics as they happen.</p></li><li><p>: We gotta eat, right? Stripe handles the billing, even with fancy promo codes. This allows us to offer advanced features and sustain development.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>: For us to stalk... I mean,  user behavior and platform performance. This dashboard gives us insights into feature adoption, common issues, and overall system health, enabling continuous improvement.</p></li><li><p>: Because even your phone deserves to see beautiful code analysis. We meticulously crafted the UI to ensure a seamless experience across desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.</p></li></ul><p><strong>Our Tech Stack (The Guts &amp; Glory):</strong></p><ul><li><p>: Next.js 13, React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS (the usual suspects, dressed to impress, and chosen for their robust ecosystem and developer experience).</p></li><li><p>: Next.js API Routes, Prisma ORM (our database savior, after some initial wrestling).</p></li><li><p>: PostgreSQL (production-ready!), SQLite (for quick dev cycles, though with some Bolt-specific quirks).</p></li><li><p>: OpenAI GPT-4 (the brains behind the operation), ElevenLabs (the voice of reason, and sometimes, humor).</p></li><li><p>: Stripe (our financial guardian, diligently handling subscriptions).</p></li><li><p>: Netlify (because who has time for complex deploys when you're in a hackathon?).</p></li><li><p>: NextAuth.js (keeping things secure and user sessions managed).</p></li></ul><h3>\n  \n  \n  🛠️ The Grand Build-Out (or, How Bolt Saved My Sanity... Mostly)\n</h3><p>Building QuantaCode was a multi-phase saga, and honestly, Bolt, the AI generator, was my co-pilot for a significant chunk of it. It's like having an incredibly fast, sometimes opinionated, but ultimately indispensable team member.</p><p><strong>Phase 1: Laying the Foundation</strong>\nWe started with Next.js 13, structuring everything like a perfectly organized closet. Clean, modular, scalable. (Truth: It was probably a messy pile of clothes at first, but we cleaned it up, honest, usually with a quick  and a prayer!) This foundational work was crucial for ensuring the project could grow without collapsing under its own weight.</p><p><strong>Phase 2: Database &amp; Authentication - The Great Pivot (and Bolt's Preferences)</strong>\nOh, Drizzle ORM. You promised so much, but delivered... headaches. Our complex schema for subscriptions and analytics just wasn't playing nice. The real kicker here wasn't Drizzle itself, but that <strong>Bolt seemed to have a strong preference for Prisma, making it challenging to get Drizzle to work seamlessly within the Bolt environment.</strong> This forced our hand. So, we did what any sane developer does in a hackathon:  It meant rewriting our entire data layer (cue dramatic music), but Prisma's TypeScript integration and robust relationship handling were a godsend. Seriously, Bolt, if you're listening, some native engine support for Prisma, especially allowing for the , would be a game-changer. We also hit a snag with testing: <strong>Bolt didn't readily allow us to spin up a local SQLite database for quick testing; we needed an actual PostgreSQL link even for development.</strong> This added an unexpected layer of setup complexity.</p><p><strong>Phase 3: AI Integration - Bolt's Brainpower</strong>\nThis is where Bolt truly shined. Crafting those \"quantum-level\" prompts for OpenAI GPT-4? That's where Bolt was instrumental. It helped us generate the sophisticated queries that made the AI understand documentation, dependencies, code quality, and security. It was like having a super-fast, tireless prompt engineer on demand, allowing us to iterate on AI analysis capabilities at an incredible pace.</p><p><strong>Phase 4: Voice Features - Making Code Talk</strong>\nIntegrating ElevenLabs was pure fun. To get started, you basically sign up, navigate to your profile settings, and grab your API key – it’s usually under an \"API\" or \"Developers\" tab. Then, you just plug that key into your backend environment variables, and  Your code starts chatting. We built out the tiered system: free users get a charmingly monotone robot, while premium users get voices so smooth, they could read a phone book and make it sound interesting. This feature added a unique layer of accessibility and engagement to our analysis.</p><p><strong>Phase 5: Payment Integration - The Stripe Tango</strong>\nStripe for subscriptions, naturally. This was less \"tango\" and more \"salsa with a blindfold.\" Setting up webhooks is a delicate dance. You register an endpoint on Stripe, get your webhook secret, and then in your Next.js API route, you verify the signature to ensure the request is legit. (Truth: We spent an embarrassing amount of time debugging why payments weren't updating user statuses. Turns out, a single missing  can ruin your whole day, leading to silent failures and frustrated users. We had to meticulously trace the webhook payload and update our user models.)</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  🎢 Challenges We Faced (The Uncensored Director's Cut)\n</h3><p>Every hackathon has its demons, and QuantaCode was no exception. These were the moments that tested our resolve, fueled by caffeine, and occasionally, mild panic.</p><ol><li><p><strong>Database Migration Complexity &amp; Bolt's Preferences</strong>: Drizzle was like that friend who promises to help you move, then shows up with a single box and an \"Oops, my car broke down.\" We ended up doing most of the heavy lifting ourselves by migrating to Prisma. The core issue wasn't Drizzle's capabilities, but Bolt's compatibility. We also faced hurdles with <strong>SWC (Speedy Web Compiler)</strong>, which, while fast, sometimes threw unexpected errors with certain Next.js 13 features or dependency configurations, forcing us to spend time on workarounds. (Truth: It was a necessary pain that paid off, but better ORM and compiler support from Bolt would have saved precious hours.)</p></li><li><p><strong>Stripe Webhook Reliability</strong>: Payments were like ghosts – sometimes they'd appear, sometimes they'd wouldn't. Users would pay, and then... crickets. (Truth: Webhooks are tricky beasts. We learned the hard way about needing robust error handling, comprehensive logging, and multiple user lookup strategies. We even wrote specific debugging scripts like <code>fix-stripe-subscriptions.js</code> to bring order to the chaos, ensuring that even if a webhook failed, we had mechanisms to reconcile user subscription statuses.)</p></li><li><p>: Trying to analyze a massive repo felt like asking GitHub for too many favors. It would just shut us down. (Truth: We were hitting rate limits like a drum solo. Our fix involved intelligent request batching, prioritizing key files like  for initial analysis, setting a strict 15-minute analysis timeout to prevent endless loops, and running analysis in the background so users wouldn't get stuck staring at a spinner. We also implemented exponential backoff for retries.)</p></li><li><p><strong>Real-time Analysis Updates</strong>: Imagine watching paint dry, but the paint might also disappear if you blink. That was our real-time analysis. (Truth: We needed background processing to keep analysis alive even if users navigated away, coupled with aggressive 5-second polling and slick visual progress indicators. This involved setting up a robust state management system to reflect the analysis progress accurately.)</p></li><li><p>: Getting the AI to \"understand\" the codebase context for voice chat was like teaching a parrot quantum physics. (Truth: It required a sophisticated context system, feeding the AI project metadata, file structure, code snippets, and conversation history to make it sound smart and relevant. This involved careful prompt engineering and managing token limits.)</p></li><li><p>: Our analysis times were initially so slow, you could bake a cake while waiting. (Truth: We optimized by limiting file analysis to the 30 most important files, batching GitHub API calls, and adding more robust error handling. This significantly reduced the load and improved response times.)</p></li><li><p>: Oh, GSAP. You beautiful, powerful, infuriating beast. Bolt, you're amazing at so many things, but when it came to animations, it felt like we were speaking different languages. (Truth: My experience with GSAP was  poor. It wasn't Bolt's fault directly, as it's a complex library, but prompting for intricate animations proved incredibly frustrating. We faced issues with conflicting timelines, unexpected element behavior in React's lifecycle, and debugging GSAP animations felt like trying to find a needle in a haystack made of JavaScript. We eventually got some cool animations, but it was a battle of wills, often requiring manual tweaking after Bolt's initial output.)</p></li><li><p><strong>The AI Brainrot Chronicles</strong>: Let's be honest. When you have an AI generator like Bolt, there's a constant, insidious temptation: \"Why read this error message? Just ask Bolt to fix it!\" (Truth: I definitely faced a bit of \"AI brainrot.\" The urge to just hand off debugging was strong. But I quickly learned that while Bolt is incredible for generating code and concepts, the human element – logical thinking, understanding the  behind an issue, and meticulously reading documentation – is absolutely non-negotiable. It's a powerful collaboration, but the human still needs to be the conductor, guiding the AI and verifying its output.)</p></li></ol><h3>\n  \n  \n  🏆 Accomplishments That Made Us Fist-Pump the Air\n</h3><p>Despite the rollercoaster, we emerged victorious (and slightly sleep-deprived) with some truly awesome accomplishments:</p><ul><li><p><strong>First Voice-Powered Codebase Interaction</strong>: We actually made code talk! This innovative feature sets QuantaCode apart and makes code analysis more engaging than ever before.</p></li><li><p><strong>Quantum-Level AI Insights</strong>: Thanks to Bolt's prompting prowess and our logical thinking, the AI delivers deep, actionable analysis. We're proud of the sophistication of the insights, moving beyond simple linting to provide genuine value.</p></li><li><p><strong>Real-time Background Processing</strong>: Analysis runs in the background, so you can keep coding without interruptions. This was a critical UX improvement that ensures a smooth workflow.</p></li><li><p><strong>Comprehensive Admin Analytics</strong>: Because data is power, even for hackathon projects. Our admin dashboard provides a clear overview of platform usage and performance.</p></li><li><p><strong>Sophisticated Subscription Management</strong>: Payments actually work! (Mostly!) Implementing a robust Stripe integration with webhooks was a significant technical achievement.</p></li><li><p><strong>Production-Ready Architecture</strong>: It's not just a prototype; it's built to scale. We focused on a clean, modular codebase that can handle future growth and features.</p></li><li><p>: Looks good on tiny screens too. Our commitment to responsive design ensures a consistent and pleasant user experience across all devices.</p></li></ul><h3>\n  \n  \n  📚 What We Learned (The Wisdom Gained)\n</h3><p>This hackathon was a masterclass in rapid development and problem-solving, teaching us invaluable lessons that will shape our future projects:</p><ul><li><p>: Seriously, pick your ORM wisely. Prisma saved us after Drizzle proved challenging within the Bolt environment. We also learned that <strong>Bolt's engine support for Prisma could be improved, specifically regarding the inability to upgrade Prisma to its latest versions, which limited our access to newer features and optimizations.</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Webhook Reliability is Critical</strong>: Treat webhooks like precious, fragile babies. They require meticulous handling, comprehensive logging, and robust retry mechanisms to ensure data consistency.</p></li><li><p><strong>API Rate Limiting Strategy</strong>: Be nice to external APIs, or they'll shut you down. Intelligent request batching and strategic prioritization are key to working within API constraints.</p></li><li><p>: Essential for long-running tasks and happy users. It's a fundamental pattern for maintaining a responsive UI during intensive operations.</p></li><li><p><strong>Error Handling is Everything</strong>: Assume everything will break, then build for it. Comprehensive error logging, user feedback, and recovery mechanisms are vital for production-ready applications.</p></li><li><p><strong>Animation Library Nuances</strong>: GSAP is powerful but has a steep learning curve. Don't underestimate it. We found that <strong>our experience with GSAP was quite poor, struggling with prompting for complex animations and debugging the resulting code.</strong> This highlights a potential area for improvement in AI-generated animation code.</p></li><li><p>: Bolt is a phenomenal co-pilot, but human logical thinking, detailed documentation, and the willingness to get your hands dirty are still paramount. The AI accelerates development, but human oversight ensures quality and correctness.</p></li><li><p><strong>UI Component Library Selection</strong>: While Shadcn UI is great, we learned that sometimes a \"softer\" UI aesthetic might be a better fit for certain projects. It's all about matching the vibe and user preferences, and exploring alternatives beyond the default.</p></li><li><p>: For future AI projects, training on structured sample code (like <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=dycomps.oimmi.com\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://www.google.com/search?q=dycomps.oimmi.com</a>) and real-world market projects would be invaluable for better AI understanding and output. <strong>This would provide more realistic and diverse examples, leading to more robust and accurate code generation and analysis.</strong></p></li></ul><h3>\n  \n  \n  🔮 What's Next for QuantaCode (The Future is Bright... and Quantum)\n</h3><p>QuantaCode isn't just a hackathon project; it's a glimpse into the future of AI-powered development. We showed that quantum-level precision can meet intuitive user experience, even with the challenges of a rapid development cycle.</p><p>The journey taught us that true innovation comes from embracing challenges, learning from every bug, and constantly iterating. Every line of code, every optimization, every polished feature brought us closer to our vision of quantum-level code intelligence.</p><p>We're excited to continue enhancing our AI models, expanding our analysis capabilities, and exploring new intuitive ways for developers to interact with their code health insights. We envision a future where QuantaCode becomes an indispensable tool in every developer's arsenal, making code healthier, more secure, and easier to understand.</p><p><strong>QuantaCode isn't just a hackathon project - it's a glimpse into the future of AI-powered development tools, where quantum-level precision meets exceptional user experience.</strong></p><p><em>Built with ❤️ (and a lot of coffee, and Bolt's help!) for the Bolt Hackathon 2024</em></p>","contentLength":16320,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"IT Services","url":"https://dev.to/devweb_technologyitinst/it-services-2ljj","date":1751377567,"author":"Devweb Technology IT Institute","guid":178945,"unread":true,"content":"","contentLength":0,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Neuralink 2025: From Sci-Fi to Real-Time Thought Control","url":"https://dev.to/calmdigitalguy/neuralink-2025-from-sci-fi-to-real-time-thought-control-5da3","date":1751377179,"author":"Casino","guid":178944,"unread":true,"content":"<p>Neuralink isn’t science fiction anymore.

Like many solo founders, I began with an idea, a tight budget, and more stubbornness than resources (Lucky being a student you get a bunch of free resources with the github student account) . Here’s a look at the gritty path of building an AI-powered SaaS product without a team, capital, or much of a safety net.</p><p>: The payments infrastructure Isn’t Built for Founders third world Countries\nMy first real hurdle wasn’t code or design it was payments. In most African countries stripe is not supported, well you would ask why did this guy start with stripe whilst there a lot of solutions out there which are supported in Africa, Well the answer was after research and considering the kind of customers that i was targeting, i was concerned that people might not be aware of the payments providers and they might hesitate to pay through them and second it was clear that all the other providers would not pay in the currency my customers would paying in, so then Stripe was an obvious choice, And thus where my journey to uncover other alternatives such as Stripe , Lemon squeezy and Polar started. But Alas, That meant I couldn’t just plug and play payments like most tutorials show. I researched endlessly, used a third-party service to incorporate abroad, verified my identity across borders, and finally, weeks later, got my first payment infrastructure live. It was messy, expensive, and time consuming.</p><p>But when the first payment notification came in (BTW it came in 3 days after incorporating stripe and weirdly enough it was not even from someone i had shared the platform with, it was just a random person in the world), it was worth it.</p><p>: Marketing is not an easy fit\nWhen I posted <a href=\"https://inov-ai.tech\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Inov-ai</a> on Product Hunt a popular launching tool for Saas products, I imagined at least a few hundred curious eyes. What I got was... silence. No upvotes, no traction. It was humbling.</p><p>That failure led me to explore better channels. I learned that niche communities (like certain Reddit subreddits and indie founder communities on X) were way more effective. I got real feedback, improved my landing page copy, and even landed my first customer through organic Reddit posting.</p><p>: User Feedback is Gold (and a Mess)\nIronically, even while building a feedback tool, I struggled with user feedback. It came in from mostly back and forth whatsApp messages, Reddit, support forms on our site, DMs all scattered. That’s when I realized <a href=\"https://inov-ai.tech\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">inov-ai</a> needed a smarter interface. So I built Airi, an AI bot that lets you chat with your feedback.

Another member of the SnackPDF community was sharing a success story about compressing their dissertation for submission. What started as a simple customer support channel had evolved into a thriving community of 500+ engaged users who helped each other, shared tips, and provided invaluable feedback for product development.</p><p>As a Computer Science student at Edinburgh Napier University, Id initially viewed community building as a nice-to-have rather than a core business strategy. Customer support was necessary, but building a community seemed like extra work that wouldnt directly impact revenue. I couldnt have been more wrong.</p><p>The community began accidentally when I created a simple Facebook group to handle SnackPDF support requests more efficiently than individual emails. Instead of just asking questions and leaving, users started helping each other, sharing use cases, and discussing document management strategies. The organic engagement revealed an unmet need for connection around shared challenges.</p><p>This accidental discovery led to a more intentional community building strategy. I realised that SnackPDF users‚students, freelancers, small business owners‚faced similar document management challenges beyond just PDF compression. They needed file organisation systems, workflow optimisation tips, and solutions for various technical problems.</p><p>The key insight was that community value extended far beyond product support. Members wanted to connect with others facing similar challenges, learn from different approaches, and share their own expertise. The community became a resource for professional development, not just technical troubleshooting.</p><p>Platform selection proved crucial for community success. Facebook groups worked well for casual discussion and broad reach, but Discord provided better real-time interaction and organisation. LinkedIn groups attracted professional users, while Reddit communities offered niche expertise. Each platform served different community needs and member preferences.</p><p>Content strategy focused on providing value beyond SnackPDF promotion. I shared general productivity tips, document management best practices, and industry insights that helped members regardless of which tools they used. This value-first approach built trust and positioned me as a helpful resource rather than just a vendor.</p><p>The university environment provided perfect community building experience. Student groups, study societies, and course forums taught me how online communities naturally develop, what keeps members engaged, and how to facilitate meaningful discussions without being overly promotional.</p><p>Moderation became essential as the community grew. Clear guidelines about helpful behaviour, spam prevention, and respectful discussion created a positive environment where members felt comfortable sharing and asking questions. The tone I set as founder influenced the entire community culture.</p><p>User-generated content became the communitys most valuable asset. Members shared their own tips, success stories, and creative use cases that provided more diverse perspectives than I could offer alone. This content also reduced my workload while increasing community value and engagement.</p><p>The feedback loop between community and product development proved invaluable. Community members identified bugs, requested features, and suggested improvements that guided SnackPDFs development roadmap. This direct connection to user needs resulted in better product decisions and higher customer satisfaction.</p><p>Seasonal engagement patterns emerged that guided community management strategy. University assignment periods generated increased activity and support requests. Holiday seasons brought different workflow challenges. Understanding these cycles helped me prepare relevant content and support resources.</p><p>Recognition and gamification elements encouraged ongoing participation without feeling artificial. Highlighting helpful members, celebrating milestones, and acknowledging valuable contributions made people feel appreciated and motivated to continue engaging with the community.</p><p>Cross-promotion opportunities developed naturally as community members discovered complementary tools and services. Instead of competing for attention, I facilitated connections between members and other helpful resources. This collaborative approach strengthened relationships and positioned me as a connector rather than just a seller.</p><p>The community became a powerful customer acquisition channel through organic word-of-mouth. Satisfied members naturally invited colleagues and friends who faced similar challenges. These referrals had higher conversion rates and stronger retention than traditional marketing channels.</p><p>Educational content performed exceptionally well in community settings. Live Q&amp;A sessions, tutorial videos, and step-by-step guides generated high engagement while providing genuine value. Members appreciated learning new skills and techniques beyond just using SnackPDF.</p><p>Partnership opportunities emerged from community connections. Other tool creators, service providers, and industry experts discovered SnackPDF through community interactions, leading to collaboration opportunities that benefited all members.</p><p>The most successful community initiatives addressed real member needs rather than business objectives. When I focused on helping people solve problems, business benefits followed naturally. When I prioritised promotion over value, engagement dropped and members became less active.</p><p>Analytics and feedback helped optimise community management efforts. Understanding which content generated the most engagement, which discussion topics resonated most strongly, and what times members were most active guided strategic decisions about community development.</p><p>The compound effect of community building became apparent over time. Early members became advocates who attracted new members, created valuable content, and provided peer support that reduced my workload. The community became self-sustaining while continuing to grow.</p><p>International expansion happened organically as community members from different countries joined and shared their perspectives. This global reach provided insights into different markets and use cases that informed product development and marketing strategies.</p><p>The most valuable lesson was understanding that communities thrive on genuine relationships and mutual value exchange. Members needed to feel heard, appreciated, and connected to something larger than just a product. Building those relationships required consistent effort and authentic engagement.</p><p>Crisis management became important when community discussions occasionally became heated or off-topic. Having clear guidelines, consistent enforcement, and respectful communication helped maintain positive community culture even during challenging situations.</p><p>As I plan RevisePDFs community strategy, Im applying these lessons about authentic relationship building and value creation from the beginning. The goal isnt just customer support‚its creating a space where professionals can connect, learn, and grow together.</p><p>The journey from accidental Facebook group to thriving 500+ member community taught me that community building is ultimately about serving peoples need for connection and mutual support. When you facilitate genuine relationships and provide real value, business success follows naturally.</p><p><em>Join the community that puts members first and see how authentic connections drive both personal and business growth at <a href=\"https://www.snackpdf.com%E2%80%9A%C2%9Dwhere\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://www.snackpdf.com‚where</a> every user is part of a supportive network of professionals facing similar challenges.</em></p><p><em>Im Calum Kerr, a Computer Science student at Edinburgh Napier University building SnackPDF and RevisePDF.

An MCP client (like Claude Desktop, ChatGPT, Cursor, Windsurf, and more) connects to the server, and allows an LLM to interact with your service. MCP is quickly becoming the de-facto protocol, and we published the ClickHouse MCP server earlier in the year: <a href=\"https://github.com/ClickHouse/mcp-clickhouse\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">mcp-clickhouse</a>.</p><p>Natural language interfaces are becoming popular across pretty much all domains, including the spaces where we find ClickHouse users. Software engineers, data engineers, analytics engineers, you name it. We're all starting to adopt natural language and agentic interfaces for parts of the job. It's making it easier than ever to work with data, whether you're comfortable with SQL or not. What we're seeing is that LLMs are helping to round out and expand people's skills - software engineers can do more with data, data engineers can do more with software, etc. There's never been a time when a wider audience could work with data.</p><p>Universally across these users, domains, and interfaces is the expectation of speed and interactivity in the user experience. Users aren't firing off a query on Friday afternoon, grabbing a delicious Bánh mì on the way home, and picking up a report on Monday morning. They're having a collaborative, interactive conversation with an LLM, where responses are delivered in seconds, and there is a real back-and-forth. If we add third-party services into the mix, we can't disrupt the user experience. If a user wants to query their database this way, it needs to handle this kind of responsiveness.</p><p>That's what makes ClickHouse the ideal database for agentic AI data workflows. ClickHouse is built to be the world's fastest analytical database, where no bits, bytes, or milliseconds are wasted. Even before the LLM and agentic era, ClickHouse aimed to support interactive analytics at scale. We didn't set out to be the best database for agentic AI - sometimes, happy accidents just happen.</p><p>Popularity aside, it's still early days, and the tools, workflows, and use cases are evolving rapidly. We see a lot of people forgoing the traditional SQL interface and BI tooling, instead using chat interfaces like Claude Desktop or ChatGPT to talk to their data, skipping SQL entirely, and generating insights and visualizations. We also see developers without a traditional data background building user-facing applications that expose data to end users, relying on LLMs not just to generate front-ends, but to structure data and optimise queries for very high concurrency.</p><p>With ClickHouse also becoming <a href=\"https://clickhouse.com/blog/clickstack-a-high-performance-oss-observability-stack-on-clickhouse\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">the best choice for observability 2.0</a>, we're seeing SREs and DevOps teams using LLMs to query their traces, metrics, and logs, blending full-text search and analytics without obscure query syntax. </p><p>And we're imagining what might come next: perhaps we'll see LLMs able to use existing observability data to inform their thinking, perhaps making recommendations for architecture, performance enhancements, or bug fixes based on the data they can access without requiring users to prompt with specific errors or traces.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  ClickHouse MCP Agent Examples\n</h2><p>To make it dead simple to get started, we’ve put together some practical examples showing how to integrate various libraries with the ClickHouse MCP server. </p><pre><code>\nenv = {\n    \"CLICKHOUSE_HOST\": \"sql-clickhouse.clickhouse.com\",\n    \"CLICKHOUSE_PORT\": \"8443\",\n    \"CLICKHOUSE_USER\": \"demo\",\n    \"CLICKHOUSE_PASSWORD\": \"\",\n    \"CLICKHOUSE_SECURE\": \"true\"\n} \n</code></pre><p>We also use Anthropic models and have provided our API key via the  environment variable.</p><p>Let’s start with <a href=\"https://docs.agno.com/tools/mcp/mcp#multiple-mcp-servers\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Agno</a> (previously PhiData), a lightweight, high-performance library for building Agents.</p><pre><code>\nasync with MCPTools(command=\"uv run --with mcp-clickhouse --python 3.13 mcp-clickhouse\", env=env, timeout_seconds=60) as mcp_tools:\n    agent = Agent(\n        model=Claude(id=\"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620\"),\n        markdown=True, \n        tools = [mcp_tools]\n    )\n    await agent.aprint_response(\"What's the most starred project in 2025?\", stream=True)\n</code></pre><p>This one has a straightforward API. We initialize  with the command to launch our local MCP Server, and all the tools become available via the  variable. We can then pass the tools into our agent before calling it on the last line.</p><p><a href=\"https://dspy.ai/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">DSPy</a> is a framework from Stanford for programming language models.</p><pre><code>\nserver_parameters = StdioServerParameters(\n    command=\"uv\",\n    args=[\n        'run',\n        '--with', 'mcp-clickhouse',\n        '--python', '3.13',\n        'mcp-clickhouse'\n    ],\n    env=env\n)\n\ndspy.configure(lm=dspy.LM(\"anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-20250514\"))\n\nclass DataAnalyst(dspy.Signature):\n    \"\"\"You are a data analyst. You'll be asked questions and you need to try to answer them using the tools you have access to. \"\"\"\n\n    user_request: str = dspy.InputField()\n    process_result: str = dspy.OutputField(\n        desc=(\n            \"Answer to the query\"\n        )\n    )\n\nasync with stdio_client(server_params) as (read, write):\n    async with ClientSession(read, write) as session:\n        await session.initialize()\n        tools = await session.list_tools()\n\n        dspy_tools = []\n        for tool in tools.tools:\n            dspy_tools.append(dspy.Tool.from_mcp_tool(session, tool))\n\n        print(\"Tools\", dspy_tools)\n\n        react = dspy.ReAct(DataAnalyst, tools=dspy_tools)\n        result = await react.acall(user_request=\"What's the most popular Amazon product category\")\n        print(result)\n</code></pre><p>This one is more complicated. We similarly initialize our MCP server, but rather than having a single command as a string, we need to split up the command and the arguments. </p><p>DSPy also requires us to specify a  class for each interaction, where we define input and output fields. We then provide that class when initializing our agent, which is done using the  class. </p><p> stands for \"reasoning and acting,\" which asks the LLM to decide whether to call a tool or wrap up the process. If a tool is required, the LLM takes responsibility for deciding which tool to call and providing the appropriate arguments.</p><p>You’ll notice that we must iterate over our MCP tools and convert them to DSPy ones.</p><p><a href=\"https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain-mcp-adapters\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">LangChain</a> is a framework for building LLM-powered applications.</p><pre><code>\nserver_params = StdioServerParameters(\n    command=\"uv\", \n    args=[\n        \"run\", \n        \"--with\", \"mcp-clickhouse\",\n        \"--python\", \"3.13\", \n        \"mcp-clickhouse\"\n    ],\n    env=env\n)\n         \nasync with stdio_client(server_params) as (read, write):\n    async with ClientSession(read, write) as session:\n        await session.initialize()\n        tools = await load_mcp_tools(session)\n        agent = create_react_agent(\"anthropic:claude-sonnet-4-0\", tools)\n        \n        handler = UltraCleanStreamHandler()        \n        async for chunk in agent.astream_events(\n            {\"messages\": [{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"Who's committed the most code to ClickHouse?\"}]}, \n            version=\"v1\"\n        ):\n            handler.handle_chunk(chunk)\n            \n        print(\"\\n\")\n</code></pre><p>LangChain follows a similar approach to DSPy when initializing the MCP Server. Like DSPy, we need to invoke a ReAct function to create the agent, passing in our MCP tools. We (well, Claude!) wrote a custom bit of code () to render the output in a more user-friendly way.</p><p><a href=\"https://docs.llamaindex.ai/en/stable/api_reference/tools/mcp/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">LlamaIndex</a> is a data framework for your LLM applications.</p><pre><code>\nmcp_client = BasicMCPClient(\n    \"uv\", \n    args=[\n        \"run\", \n        \"--with\", \"mcp-clickhouse\",\n        \"--python\", \"3.13\", \n        \"mcp-clickhouse\"\n    ],\n    env=env\n)\n\nmcp_tool_spec = McpToolSpec(\n    client=mcp_client,\n)\n\ntools = await mcp_tool_spec.to_tool_list_async()\n\nagent_worker = FunctionCallingAgentWorker.from_tools(\n    tools=tools, \n    llm=llm, verbose=True, max_function_calls=10\n)\nagent = AgentRunner(agent_worker)\n\nresponse = agent.query(\"What's the most popular repository?\")\n</code></pre><p>LlamaIndex follows the familiar approach of initializing the MCP server. We then initialize an agent with our tools and LLM. We found the default  value of 5 was too low and wasn’t enough to answer any questions, so we increased it to 10.</p><p><a href=\"https://ai.pydantic.dev/mcp/run-python/#installation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">PydanticAI</a> is a Python agent framework designed to make it less painful to build production-grade applications with Generative AI.</p><pre><code>\nserver = MCPServerStdio(  \n    'uv',\n    args=[\n        'run',\n        '--with', 'mcp-clickhouse',\n        '--python', '3.13',\n        'mcp-clickhouse'\n    ],\n    env=env\n)\nagent = Agent('anthropic:claude-sonnet-4-0', mcp_servers=[server])\n\nasync with agent.run_mcp_servers():\n    result = await agent.run(\"Who's done the most PRs for ClickHouse?\")\n    print(result.output)\n</code></pre><p>Pydantic has the simplest API. Again, we initialize our MCP server and pass it into the agent. It then runs the server as an asynchronous context manager and we can ask the agent questions inside that block.</p><p>We’re just getting started with MCP and ClickHouse, and we’d love to hear about what you’re building and your experience using mcp-clickhouse. </p><p>Try out the examples, build something cool, and let us know what you think.

Whether you're booking a flight, managing finances, or ordering dinner, your experience is shaped by digital interfaces. Behind those seamless interactions is careful, deliberate design that combines beauty with usability. This is the role of UI/UX design—bringing clarity to complexity, making technology feel human.</p><p>As users demand faster, smarter, and more intuitive interactions, businesses are racing to differentiate themselves through digital experience. An elegant design may catch attention, but a thoughtful user experience creates loyalty. That’s why user-centered design is now at the heart of digital transformation strategies across industries.</p><p>UI (User Interface) and UX (User Experience) are two sides of the same coin:</p><ul><li> focuses on the look and feel—the buttons, color schemes, typography, layout, and visual hierarchy.</li><li> focuses on functionality—how easy it is for users to complete tasks, how intuitive a product is, and how it makes them feel throughout the journey.</li></ul><p>While UI is about the surface, UX digs into the experience beneath it. Together, they make or break a product's usability and impact.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  The Power of Thoughtful Design\n</h2><p>Users are more discerning than ever. A confusing app interface, a slow checkout process, or a <a href=\"https://www.wordplays.com/crossword-solver/Hard-to-navigate\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">hard-to-navigate</a> website can drive them away in seconds. But when design is well-executed, it builds trust, improves satisfaction, and turns casual users into loyal advocates.</p><p>That’s where a specialized UI UX design agency comes into play. These agencies don’t just focus on visuals; they go deeper—conducting user research, mapping user journeys, prototyping interactions, and testing every click and tap. Their goal? To ensure that every product not only looks good but performs brilliantly under real-world conditions.</p><p>A good UI UX design agency brings a combination of creative direction and strategic thinking. They work closely with product owners, developers, marketers, and stakeholders to translate business goals into functional, user-friendly digital experiences. Whether it’s a startup launching its first app or an enterprise rethinking its customer platform, these agencies provide the roadmap and the expertise to bring ideas to life.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Key Benefits of Working with a UI/UX Agency\n</h2><p><strong>1. User-Centered Strategy</strong>\nDesign starts with the user. Agencies conduct in-depth research—through interviews, analytics, and competitive audits—to understand user behaviors and needs. This insight forms the foundation of every design decision, resulting in products that resonate.</p><p>\nWith tried-and-tested workflows, a UI/UX agency can rapidly prototype and iterate on ideas. Their experience working across different platforms and industries allows them to avoid common pitfalls and deliver high-quality designs efficiently.</p><p><strong>3. Design Systems for Scale</strong>\nAs products grow, design consistency becomes a challenge. Agencies build reusable design systems—collections of UI components, style guides, and UX principles—that ensure scalability and maintain brand cohesion across all touchpoints.</p><p><strong>4. Testing and Optimization</strong>\nGood design is never final. Agencies conduct usability testing and gather feedback to refine products post-launch. This continuous loop of testing and iteration ensures long-term user satisfaction.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  How UI/UX Is Changing Industries\n</h2><ul><li> Clear navigation and fast checkout increase conversion rates and reduce cart abandonment.</li><li> Simple dashboards and mobile-first design build trust and help users manage their money with confidence.</li><li> Intuitive patient portals and appointment systems reduce administrative load and improve health outcomes.</li><li> Engaging and accessible interfaces support remote learning and digital classrooms.</li></ul><p>In each case, the work of a skilled UI UX design agency has a direct impact on customer engagement, retention, and brand perception. The digital experience is no longer just part of the business—it is the business.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  The Process: From Vision to Execution\n</h2><ol><li> Stakeholder interviews, user research, and competitor analysis.</li><li> Defining personas, mapping journeys, and outlining product goals.</li><li> Sketching ideas and building low-fidelity prototypes to validate direction. </li><li> Applying brand elements, typography, and color to create high-fidelity mockups.</li><li> Interactive prototypes allow real user testing and feedback loops before development.</li><li> Finalized design assets and specs are handed off to developers with ongoing support. </li></ol><ul><li><strong>AI-Driven Personalization:</strong> Interfaces that adapt based on user data and preferences.</li><li><strong>Voice and Gesture Interfaces:</strong> Beyond clicks and taps—designing for spoken commands and physical interaction.</li><li><strong>Accessibility by Default:</strong> Designing inclusive experiences for all users, including those with disabilities.</li><li> Stripping away the unnecessary to deliver faster, cleaner, more focused digital journeys.</li></ul><p>Designers are no longer just visual artists; they are architects of the future.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Choosing the Right Agency\n</h2><p>With so many options, how do you choose the right partner? Look for:</p><ul><li>A solid portfolio with measurable impact</li><li>Deep understanding of both UX strategy and UI execution</li><li>Clear communication and transparent processes</li><li>Familiarity with your industry or type of product</li><li>Tools like Figma, Adobe XD, or Sketch, plus prototyping experience</li></ul><p>An ideal partner will feel like an extension of your own team—collaborative, creative, and always user-first.</p><p>In a digital age, your product’s design is your brand’s voice. A great experience is no longer a bonus—it’s an expectation.

From self-driving cars to predictive analytics, AI is driving innovation across industries. As demand grows for AI professionals, many students and tech enthusiasts are enrolling in AI programs to build expertise in machine learning, deep learning, and data modeling.</p><p>However, the path to mastering AI is challenging. The subject is complex, constantly evolving, and requires a blend of programming, mathematics, and logical thinking. Through experience and observation, here are seven critical mistakes that most students make while learning artificial intelligence, and how to avoid them for a successful learning journey.</p><p><strong>What Is Artificial Intelligence and Why Is It Important?</strong></p><p>Artificial Intelligence is the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think, learn, and solve problems. It powers applications like speech recognition, facial detection, recommendation engines, and even fraud prevention systems. AI is not just about code, it’s about decision-making, prediction, and automation at scale.</p><p>Organizations today are leveraging AI to enhance operations, improve customer experiences, and gain competitive advantage. That’s why trained professionals with real-world AI skills are in high demand across every sector.</p><p><strong>7 Critical Mistakes Students Must Avoid in AI Learning</strong></p><p><strong>1. Skipping the Fundamentals of Math and Statistics</strong></p><p>AI is built on strong foundations in linear algebra, probability, calculus, and statistics. One of the biggest mistakes students make is ignoring these basics. Without understanding concepts like gradient descent, matrix operations, or probability distributions, building and optimizing models becomes guesswork.</p><p><strong>2. Learning Too Many Tools at Once</strong></p><p>From TensorFlow and PyTorch to Scikit-learn and Keras, AI offers a wide variety of frameworks. New learners often jump between tools without mastering any. The better approach is to pick one, understand how it works under the hood, and apply it across various projects before moving on.</p><p><strong>3. Treating Machine Learning as Black Box Magic</strong></p><p>A common mistake is running algorithms without understanding how they work. AI is not about feeding data into a model and hoping it works. You need to know what the model is doing - how it learns, what features it’s prioritizing, and how to evaluate its performance.</p><p><strong>4. Ignoring Data Quality and Preprocessing</strong></p><p>AI models are only as good as the data they are trained on. Students often ignore cleaning, preprocessing, and feature engineering steps, jumping straight to modeling. This can result in poor predictions and misleading results. Data understanding is as important as model building.</p><p><strong>5. Not Practicing on Real-World Datasets</strong></p><p>Many learners stick to textbook datasets like Iris or Titanic. While good for basics, they don’t expose you to real challenges like missing values, data imbalance, or noisy inputs. Work on real-world problems, sentiment analysis, fraud detection, or image classification, to build job-ready skills.</p><p><strong>6. Avoiding Collaboration and Open Source Contributions</strong></p><p>AI is a community-driven field. Students who learn in isolation often miss out on important insights, trends, and peer feedback. Participate in hackathons, contribute to GitHub repositories, and join online communities to improve faster and stay updated with advancements.</p><p><strong>7. Studying Without a Clear Goal or Domain Focus</strong></p><p>AI is vast. From NLP and computer vision to robotics and generative models, there are endless specializations. Without a goal, students end up learning in random directions. Choose a domain that excites you, whether it's healthcare, finance, or automation, and build focused projects around it.</p><p><strong>What You Will Learn in an AI Course</strong></p><p>A structured AI program will guide you through both the theoretical and practical aspects of artificial intelligence. A high-quality ai training in bangalore typically includes:</p><ul><li>Python programming and libraries for AI</li><li>Core concepts of supervised and unsupervised learning</li><li>Neural networks and deep learning architectures</li><li>Natural language processing and computer vision</li><li>Model deployment and performance evaluation</li><li>Data preprocessing and visualization techniques</li><li>Capstone projects with real business datasets.</li></ul><p>These skills prepare you for real-world AI roles where understanding, building, and deploying models is part of everyday work.</p><p><strong>Career Opportunities After Completing an AI Program</strong></p><p>Artificial Intelligence opens the door to some of the most innovative and well-paying roles in tech, including:</p><ul><li>Machine Learning Developer</li><li>Computer Vision Specialist</li></ul><p>Whether you want to work in startups, research labs, or enterprise AI teams, certified professionals are in high demand.</p><p><strong>Why Bangalore Is a Hub for Learning and Working in AI</strong></p><p>Known as India’s tech capital, Bangalore has emerged as a major AI development and research hub. From global IT companies to deep-tech startups, the city is filled with opportunities to apply your AI skills.

These challenges are particularly common in BPO services. That’s where <a href=\"https://www.allianzebpo.com/bpo-services\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Robotic Process Automation (RPA) becomes a smart solution</a>. RPA makes use of software robots to manage rule-based processes without human intervention.</p><p>A high percentage of companies are moving to RPA to enhance speed, accuracy, and cost efficiency. RPA in BPO enables service providers to scale quickly and affordably, where deadlines and precision are paramount. In this blog, we will guide you through Robotic Process Automation, how it works, and why it's transforming the way BPO companies function.</p><p><strong>What is Robotic Process Automation (RPA)</strong>\nRobotic Process Automation is termed as software technology that employs ‘bots’ to perform human actions on digital systems. These bots have the potential to perform repetitive, rule-based tasks just like humans, but quickly, continuously, and without errors. These bots can log in to apps, move files, enter data, and complete tasks that follow clear rules. Different from conventional automation, RPA doesn’t require changes to the prevailing software. It operates across multiple platforms, making it flexible and easy to deploy.</p><p>For example, an RPA bot can abstract data from emails and enter it into CRM. The software system can also produce invoices or validate data in seconds, and can work continuously without breaks or errors. RPA systems can also work with complex systems, which makes it different from scripts or macros. RPA technology is scalable, secure, and supports business automation in various industries. Also, it offers a comprehensive audit trail for compliance.</p><p>Repetitive tasks consume a lot of time and resources in Business Process Outsourcing (BPO) services. The BPO tasks usually consist of form filing, payroll entries, or responding to routine emails. Integrating RPA helps automate these processes, so teams can concentrate on more complicated and valuable work.</p><p>Many BPO companies use RPA to support services such as:\n• Data entry and form processing<p>\n• Payroll and benefits administration</p>\n• Background checks and compliance reporting<p>\n• CRM data updates and backend support</p></p><p>Instead of replacing humans, RPA works alongside them. Bots handle structured tasks while humans solve issues, interact with clients, and make decisions. This combination improves turnaround times and service quality.</p><p><strong>Key Benefits of RPA in BPO Companies</strong>\n· Increased Efficiency and Productivity<p>\nBots are capable of completing tasks faster than humans. Also, they don’t require breaks or supervision. RPA mitigates delays and ensures consistent output. This results in quicker client delivery and better use of human talent. </p></p><p>· Improved Accuracy and Reduced Errors\nManual processes often lead to mistakes. RPA eliminates that risk by following set rules. This leads to higher data accuracy and fewer corrections. This is significant for industries like healthcare, finance, and insurance.</p><p>· Cost Optimization\nBusinesses can reduce their dependency on large teams when they automate routine tasks. Although there is an initial setup expense, the long-term savings are substantial. By automating the routine tasks, companies can assign their employees to high-priority tasks and mitigate overheads.</p><p>· Scalability and Flexibility\nRPA tools scale easily. During peak periods, you can deploy more bots without hiring extra staff. You can also introduce bots to new clients or services with minimal delay.</p><p>· Enhanced Compliance and Reporting\nRPA systems create digital logs of every action they perform. This helps companies stay audit-ready and meet compliance standards. They can also schedule automatic reports for better transparency.</p><p><strong>RPA in BPO: What Firms Should Know?</strong>\nFor RPA to work well, BPO providers need a solid plan. Here's how to start:</p><p>Find Tasks that can be Automated: Seek tasks that are based on rules, repetitive, and high-volume.\nCalculate Possible ROI: Measure the time saved, cost mitigated, and error rates lowered.<p>\nSelect the Right RPA Tools and Vendors: There are many choices such as UiPath, Blue Prism, and Automation Anywhere.</p>\nStart With a Pilot: Test the bot in a small process. Monitor its performance.<p>\nScale Gradually: Once the pilot succeeds, expand automation to other areas.</p>\nOvercoming Common Challenges<p>\nRPA adoption may face hurdles like:</p></p><p>Staff resistance to change\nIntegration issues with legacy systems<p>\nMaintenance and updates of bots</p>\nRegular training and involving employees early can reduce pushback. Choosing scalable tools and having a support team also help smooth the journey.</p><p>\nRPA is evolving. Businesses are combining RPA with AI and machine learning for intelligent automation. These systems not only follow rules but also learn from data. This opens doors to more advanced BPO automation. Hybrid workforces, where bots and humans work together, are becoming common. BPO firms using automation as a foundation are attracting global clients looking for value and agility. To stay competitive, BPO teams need to learn new skills. Understanding RPA tools and managing bots will become key roles. Upskilling workers in bot monitoring, data analysis, and compliance will strengthen BPO operations.</p><p>\nRobotic process automation is more than just a tech upgrade. It helps BPO firms deliver better, faster, and more reliable services. RPA in BPO boosts productivity, reduces costs, and improves client experience. Companies that use business process automation smartly can handle more clients without scaling up teams. RPA technology allows BPO firms to meet service targets while staying flexible and secure.</p>","contentLength":5698,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Unlock Business Potential with Machine Learning by Chirpn","url":"https://dev.to/chirpn/unlock-business-potential-with-machine-learning-by-chirpn-cm0","date":1751363585,"author":"chirpn","guid":178808,"unread":true,"content":"<p>Looking to transform your business with intelligent, data-driven decisions?

It’s not flashy, and it’s not the kind of change that makes headlines every day. But it’s real, and it’s reshaping the way companies work from the inside out.</p><p>And no, it’s not just tech companies playing with shiny new tools. Retail, insurance, healthcare, finance—everyone’s quietly experimenting, optimizing, and rethinking the way work gets done. The result? More efficient operations, happier teams, and faster growth.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Forget the Hype—Here’s What’s Really Happening\n</h2><p>Let’s start with this: most businesses are tired of hearing about “the next big thing.” The truth is, companies aren’t looking for another trend. They’re looking for solutions—tools that help teams save time, improve accuracy, and make better decisions. That’s where Gen AI quietly slips in.</p><p>What used to take a dozen spreadsheets and hours of human input now takes a few minutes with the right AI-powered system. Natural language queries are replacing complex dashboards. Routine tasks like customer support summaries, internal reports, and even policy drafts? They’re being handled by AI that actually understands context.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  But Gen AI Alone Isn’t the Whole Picture\n</h2><p>Let’s be honest—dropping AI into a broken system won’t fix anything. And that’s exactly why digital transformation services matter more than ever.</p><p>Companies that are winning right now aren’t just plugging in AI. They’re redesigning their processes from the ground up. They’re asking big questions:</p><p>Why are we still using three different tools for this?</p><p>What would it look like if we automated that step?</p><p>Could we connect systems so teams don’t waste time chasing information?</p><p>It’s not always glamorous work. Sometimes it’s tedious. But when done right, digital transformation lays the foundation for real AI integration. It ensures the data is clean, the processes are streamlined, and the outcomes are measurable.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Real-World Example? Here’s One\n</h2><p>A mid-sized insurance company used to take 10–15 days to process a typical claim. Why? Because it involved manual data entry, back-and-forth emails, and lots of human review. Today, with a smart combination of digital transformation and Gen AI, they do it in two days.</p><p>Documents are scanned and interpreted using natural language models. Logic flows are built into the software, so each claim is evaluated consistently. Alerts are triggered when something looks off. Human oversight is still there, but only where it really matters.</p><p>That’s not a pipe dream. That’s happening right now.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  How B2B Apps Are Quietly Getting Smarter\n</h2><p>Let’s switch gears for a second.</p><p>There was a time when B2B apps tried to do everything—CRM, analytics, customer support, all in one clunky package. But the smarter approach we’re seeing now is this: focus on the pain point, solve it well, and integrate cleanly with the rest of the ecosystem.</p><p>Modern B2B app development is driven by real business needs, not bloated feature lists. Whether it’s an internal tool to help HR automate onboarding or a sales assistant that surfaces the right lead at the right time, AI is being embedded where it matters most.</p><p>This isn’t about building “AI apps.” It’s about building better apps—and using Gen AI as one of the ingredients, not the whole recipe.</p><p>You don’t need a massive budget or a five-year plan to begin. Just take stock of your current workflows. Look for bottlenecks—the tasks that no one enjoys but that take up time and create errors.</p><p>Maybe it’s invoice processing. Maybe it’s customer support routing. Maybe it’s just data entry.</p><p>Chances are, there’s a solution powered by Gen AI services for that. And if you’ve already invested in digital transformation services, integrating AI will be faster, smoother, and far more impactful</p><p>At the end of the day, this isn’t about replacing people with machines. It’s about making people’s jobs more meaningful. By leveraging , you can clear out the noise, automate the repetitive stuff, and let your team focus on the work that truly moves the needle.</p><p>So no, it’s not a revolution with parades and banners. It’s a quiet shift happening in boardrooms, IT departments, and startup offices all around the world. Gen AI and digital transformation services are reshaping the way work happens—and the smartest companies are already leaning in.</p>","contentLength":4456,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"You've Got Mail📨 (and Recommendations!): Delivering Recs with Keras, JAX & KerasRS","url":"https://dev.to/ahirtonlopes/youve-got-mail-and-recommendations-delivering-recs-with-keras-jax-kerasrs-1j33","date":1751361598,"author":"Ahirton Lopes","guid":178802,"unread":true,"content":"<p>Recommendations are everywhere — from your email inbox to the shopping carts you abandon (but never escape 😅).

And finally, the cross-cutting trends that might pique your interest as a developer.</em></p><p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) is increasingly becoming part of the core infrastructure for development. Whether it's being used to monitor the climate, manage agriculture, or power intelligent software systems, AI is proving to be a practical tool—not just a buzzword.</p><p>In this post, I’ll summarise three insightful projects led by African developers and researchers. These examples show how AI is already being used to address real-world challenges. More importantly, they offer developers practical lessons on tools, methods, and approaches to building impactful solutions.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  1. Smarter Earth Monitoring with Geospatial Foundation Models\n</h2><p> Wanjiru Catherine, IBM Research Africa</p><p>This project introduced <em>Geospatial Foundation Models</em> (GFMs) built using self-supervised learning techniques. These models are designed to understand Earth Observation data such as satellite imagery. They’re trained on diverse geospatial tasks like land cover classification, flood detection, or estimating biomass.</p><p>The team also built  — a toolkit that makes it easier to fine-tune these models. Built on top of PyTorch Lightning and TorchGeo, TerraTorch allows you to train models for tasks like image segmentation or classification without writing much boilerplate code.</p><p><strong>Why this matters for developers</strong>:</p><ul><li>You can use pre-trained models to solve different problems by fine-tuning rather than starting from scratch.</li><li>TerraTorch supports a config-only approach to training pipelines, making it friendly for experimentation.</li><li>These models make it easier to work with satellite data and apply AI to environmental and sustainability issues.</li></ul><h2>\n  \n  \n  2. Predicting Maize Pest Outbreaks with Weather Data\n</h2><p> Edward Gichura, Dedan Kimathi University of Technology</p><p>This project focuses on improving food security using machine learning. Edward built models that predict pest and disease outbreaks in maize farms using seasonal weather data such as rainfall, humidity, and temperature.</p><p>Using XGBoost, the best model reached 96% accuracy in predicting when and where pests like Fall Armyworm would appear. The datasets combined weather APIs with on-the-ground reports from farmers and agricultural agencies.</p><p><strong>Why this matters for developers</strong>:</p><ul><li>You don’t always need deep learning. With the right data and feature engineering, classical models like XGBoost can do an excellent job.</li><li>The project makes a strong case for building  that could be delivered through SMS or mobile dashboards—tools that smallholder farmers can actually use.</li><li>It's a great example of applying AI in a resource-limited setting where impact matters more than hype.</li></ul><p>: Consider combining weather APIs with real-time field data for ongoing model retraining.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  3. Building Intelligent Agents with Google ADK\n</h2><p> Ephraim Mwereza</p><p>This project was about creating intelligent software agents using Google’s AI Development Kit (ADK). These agents are designed to understand spoken input, manage dialogue, and respond based on context.</p><p>The aim here was to build agents that could work even in low-connectivity areas. While the technical details were limited, the emphasis was on creating tools that are both smart and accessible—for example, an agent that can help with education or healthcare tasks.</p><p><strong>Why this matters for developers</strong>:</p><ul><li>Intelligent agents are more than just bots—they can manage state, handle complex tasks, and learn from interactions.</li><li>Tools like Google ADK allow you to build voice-first applications that are practical in areas where typing isn’t ideal.</li><li>There’s a growing need for lightweight, on-device AI that can run offline or with minimal internet access.</li></ul><h2>\n  \n  \n  Cross-Cutting Trends That Developers Should Note\n</h2><p>Looking across all three projects, a few common themes stand out:</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  1. Simpler Workflows Through Low-Code Tools\n</h3><p>Whether it’s TerraTorch or Google ADK, developers now have access to tools that simplify the training and deployment of AI models. This reduces the barrier to entry and allows for quicker iteration.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  2. Pre-Trained Models Are the New Starting Point\n</h3><p>Instead of building models from the ground up, developers can start with a general-purpose model and fine-tune it for their own use case. This approach is efficient and scalable.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  3. AI Needs to Work in the Real World\n</h3><p>These projects serve communities that don’t always have high-speed internet or powerful devices. As a developer, you’ll need to design for edge deployment, offline support, and clear user feedback.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  4. Developers Must Be Domain-Aware\n</h3><p>You can’t just build in isolation.

Startups that delay implementing <a href=\"https://magicfactory.tech/hire-ai-developers/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">artificial intelligence developer</a>’s in their processes are left observing competitors who get a head start using intelligent products, optimized processes, and more in-depth understanding of customers. This is the harsh truth that makes it a priority for startups to hire an artificial intelligence developer as one of their very first strategic moves.<strong>Market Imperatives Spur Urgent Hiring</strong></p><p>Today's customers want smart, personalized encounters with each digital interaction. Whether an online retailer's recommendation engine, a customer service chatbot, or predictive analytics solution, AI today is table stakes and not an extra premium feature. Startups are aware that without an artificial intelligence engineer as part of the team, they're developing solutions of yesteryear for tomorrow's marketplace.\n The window of competitive advantage diminishes as more and more AI technologies become commodity products. Having access to tools is not a guarantee of success, however. An experienced artificial intelligence software developer has the know-how and skills to select the optimal technologies, avoid pitfalls, and build solutions that really provide business value and not just impressive demos.</p><p><strong>Investor Expectations and Funding Success</strong>\nInvestors now go out of their way to invest in startups that possess AI components embedded in business models or growth plans. Venture capitalists understand that artificial intelligence can significantly enhance unit economics, reduce operating costs, and create scalable competitive moats. Startups with an artificial intelligence developer as a part of the founding team are generally best-positioned when negotiating capital.<p>\n The presence of this AI talent indicates that the startup understands advanced technology and has the ability to translate data-driven growth strategy into practice. Technical credibility is particularly valuable in trying to match up against other startups operating within similar markets for capital investment.</p></p><p><strong>Solving Complex Problems at Scale</strong>\nStartups also have issues that conventional methods of software development are not able to handle economically. Customer segmentation, price optimization, fraud detection, and content personalization all benefit immensely from AI methods. An artificial intelligence developer can create solutions that learn to improve by themselves as the startup expands, instead of needing constant human tweaking.<p>\n These clever solutions will typically give startups features reserved for only much bigger enterprises. A tiny Internet store, for instance, can utilize best-of-breed recommendation engines up to the level of big-box retailers thanks to the ingenuity of a brilliant AI programmer who understands how to leverage existing ML libraries and pre-trained models.</p>\n Successful startups make decisions based on facts rather than gut feeling. An AI developer helps decide on data collection protocols, analysis designs, and prediction models that provide actionable real-time intelligence from business development outset. Data-driven approaches allow startups to avoid costly mistakes and uncover growth opportunities early.<p>\n The ability to make strong inferences from small sets of data is particularly useful in early-stage companies. An experienced artificial intelligence engineer knows how to make something out of small sets of data, make use of transfer learning techniques, and construct models that will be valuable even when the company has not amassed ginormous sets of historic data.</p></p><p>\nIn tech sectors, sustainable competitive advantages are likely to have a basis in technological capabilities that are hard for others to replicate. A startup recruits an AI engineer to craft these tech moats through patented algorithms, customized data processing pipelines, and improving learning systems.<p>\n These technological attributes become more crucial as markets mature and parity is less difficult to achieve. Startups that possess sophisticated AI capabilities can maintain competitive edges even when larger companies bring more resources into their markets.</p></p><p><strong>Attracting Top-Tier Talent</strong>\nHaving an AI engineer on the team makes startups more attractive to other best technical talent. Great engineers want to work on difficult, innovative problems rather than creating run-of-the-mill apps. Having AI projects under their belt makes the startup offer opportunities for technical development and innovation at scale.<p>\n This talent pull is not restricted to engineers. Product managers, designers, and business development professionals more and more want to work with AI-enabled products and data-driven companies. An artificial intelligence developer is helping create the technology infrastructure behind these cross-functional partnerships.</p></p><p><strong>Getting Ready for Sudden Death or Quick Scale</strong>\nSuccessful start-ups will experience explosive growth that strains traditional systems and processes. AI-driven solutions developed by an experienced artificial intelligence developer are capable of better addressing this growth challenge than rivals that are controlled manually. Customer service, intelligent resource allocation, and forecasted capacity planning become necessities when growth is occurring in a competitive manner.<p>\n The idea to develop scalable artificial intelligence systems from the outset sidesteps technical debt and operational constraints that typically hold high-speed startups back. Such preparedness enables founders to focus on key decisions rather than firefighting operations.</p>\n Recruiting <a href=\"https://magicfactory.tech/hire-ai-developers/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">artificial intelligence developer</a>’s  as a requirement is a sign that AI has moved from experimental technology to business imperative, where early adoption is a factor in the success of startups.</p>","contentLength":5875,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"FreeRTOS Design Routine Based on i.MX9352 Development Board M Core","url":"https://dev.to/ronnie_r_152dc2151d9449c6/freertos-design-routine-based-on-imx9352-development-board-m-core-4d78","date":1751360428,"author":"ronnie R","guid":178778,"unread":true,"content":"<p>In the embedded systems, the application of embedded real-time operating systems (RTOS) is becoming increasingly widespread.

To help developers fully leverage the real-time capabilities of the i.MX 9352 M33 core, the FreeRTOS examples provided in the accompanying M-core SDK package are divided into two categories. One category introduces the features of FreeRTOS system components, such as semaphores, mutexes, and queues. The other category shows how to use peripheral interfaces in FreeRTOS.

SeaOS reimagines the very structure of blockchain intelligence — from the ground up.<p>\nAs the Web3 space increasingly intersects with artificial intelligence, the rise of so-called “AI on-chain” applications has become one of the industry’s most prominent trends. From AI-enhanced smart contracts to model-integrated DApps, the ecosystem is rapidly experimenting with ways to make blockchains “intelligent.”</p>\nBut amid the hype, a fundamental misunderstanding persists:<p>\nPlugging an AI model into a smart contract does not make a blockchain intelligent.</p>\nIn most cases, this approach amounts to little more than attaching a black-box inference API to a static contract — a surface-level enhancement that fails to address the deeper integration challenges between AI and decentralized systems.<p>\nAt SeaOS, we believe true AI-native design means reconstructing the foundational architecture of on-chain intelligence. As an operating system purpose-built for AI-native Web3, SeaOS introduces a radically new paradigm: one where autonomous agents, not static contracts, serve as the core units of execution, coordination, and evolution on-chain.</p></p><p>The Legacy Approach: AI as an Add-On, Not Infrastructure\nMost current “AI + blockchain” solutions follow a familiar pattern:</p><ul><li>A pre-trained AI model is hosted off-chain.</li><li>A smart contract calls the model via an API or oracle.</li><li>The AI outputs are fed back into the chain for settlement or storage.\nWhile functional, this model introduces significant limitations:</li><li>Smart contracts remain static. They cannot learn, adapt, or evolve over time.</li><li>AI logic remains off-chain. The model lives outside the decentralized network, with limited transparency or coordination.</li><li>Semantic gaps persist. The integration is superficial—contracts and models speak different languages, with minimal real-time feedback or shared state.\nThe result? Most so-called AI applications are merely \"model + chain\" hybrids, not truly AI-native systems.</li></ul><p>SeaOS’s Breakthrough: Architecting Native On-Chain Intelligence\nSeaOS’s architecture doesn’t just embed AI into existing systems — it transforms the blockchain into an environment where intelligent agents can live, learn, and evolve.<p>\nWe call this the AI-native execution layer — a framework where agents are not passive functions but active, persistent participants in the network.</p></p><ol><li>Autonomous Agents as First-Class On-Chain Entities\nIn SeaOS, agents are stateful, context-aware, and behaviorally autonomous. They are not subroutines of contracts but independent intelligent units that:</li><li>Maintain long-term memory and internal state.</li><li>Generate dynamic behaviors based on environmental feedback.</li><li><p>Collaborate across the ecosystem through semantic communication and task coordination.\nThis shifts the paradigm from “execution as termination” to execution as continuity — enabling systems that adapt, grow, and self-optimize over time.</p></li><li><p>Deep Semantic Fusion of Smart Contracts and AI Models\nThrough a modular AI-Contract Layer, SeaOS enables tight integration between model inference and contract logic, at both structural and runtime levels:</p></li><li><p>AI models are embedded as native components within contract workflows.</p></li><li><p>Execution becomes a hybrid of deterministic logic and probabilistic reasoning.</p></li><li><p>Multiple models can coordinate within a single lifecycle, enabling composite behaviors and adaptive strategies.\nThis integration breaks through the traditional “call-and-return” limitation and enables semantic interoperability between agents and code — a key foundation for truly intelligent dApps.</p></li><li><p>Self-Evolution and Decentralized Scheduling\nSeaOS introduces a set of system-level mechanisms that allow agents to self-evolve and coordinate across the network:</p></li><li><p>Agents continuously learn from on-chain data and feedback loops.</p></li><li><p>A decentralized scheduler dynamically allocates compute resources and task routing based on agent priority and system demand.</p></li><li><p>The result is an open, adaptive agent economy — resilient, extensible, and optimized for continuous innovation.</p></li></ol><p>System Design: Building the Foundations of an AI-Native Chain\nTo support these intelligent agents at scale, SeaOS implements a new technical stack:</p><ul><li>Multi-VM Compatibility: Supports EVM, SVM, and inference-specific virtual machines for heterogeneous execution.</li><li>AI-Contract Layer: A plug-and-play framework for embedding AI logic into on-chain workflows.</li><li>Decentralized AI Compute Network: Elastic GPU and edge compute infrastructure for real-time model inference.</li><li>Autonomous Scheduling Framework: Agent-level orchestration of tasks, resources, and evolution across the network.\nTogether, these components form the foundation of SeaOS’s on-chain intelligence infrastructure — purpose-built for the age of smart agents.</li></ul><p>Conclusion: From Contracts to Intelligence\nThe future of Web3 will not be driven by static smart contracts, but by intelligent, autonomous agents.<p>\nTo get there, we must go beyond simply “plugging in models.” We need to rethink the very fabric of execution, state, and coordination on-chain — and build systems where intelligence is native, not peripheral.</p>\nSeaOS is pioneering this new standard with a system-level redesign that unites AI, blockchain, and autonomy into a single coherent stack. This is not just Smart Contracts 2.0 — it's the Operating System for a decentralized intelligent future.<p>\nJoin us as we define the next era of on-chain intelligence.</p></p><ul></ul>","contentLength":5491,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"From Manual Cookie Banners to Zero-Touch Compliance: The World's First Zero-Touch Compliance System","url":"https://dev.to/mehwish_malik_4f29ff7fb04/from-manual-cookie-banners-to-zero-touch-compliance-the-worlds-first-zero-touch-compliance-system-4m7f","date":1751355877,"author":"Mehwish Malik","guid":178751,"unread":true,"content":"<p>If you’re a developer or agency, you know how much time cookie compliance can drain.

These autonomous entities, capable of performing tasks and making decisions, hold immense potential. However, for AI agents to move beyond simple, isolated interactions and become truly intelligent and collaborative, they need a robust way to manage and communicate their understanding of the world – their \"context.\" This is where the Model Context Protocol (MCP) comes into play. As a beginner, understanding MCP might seem daunting, but it's a fundamental concept for <a href=\"https://www.sparkouttech.com/ai-agent-development/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">building effective AI agents</a>. This guide will provide a clear, step-by-step introduction to using MCP for AI agent communication, explaining its core principles, how it facilitates seamless interactions, and why it's crucial for any aspiring AI agent developer. We’ll break down the complexities, making MCP accessible and practical.</p><p>*<em>Understanding the Core Concept: What is Context in AI Agents?\n*</em>\nBefore diving into MCP, let's clarify what \"context\" means in the realm of AI agents. Imagine you're talking to a friend. You don't start every sentence by re-explaining everything that's happened previously. You rely on shared understanding, past conversations, and the current situation. This shared understanding is context.</p><p>For an AI agent, context encompasses all the relevant information it needs to understand its current situation, make informed decisions, and perform tasks coherently. This includes:</p><p>: What has been said or done in previous turns of interaction.</p><p> Known preferences of the user (e.g., preferred language, dietary restrictions, favorite products).</p><p>Environmental State: Real-time data about the agent's operating environment (e.g., current time, weather, stock prices, system status).</p><p> The overall objective the agent is trying to achieve and the intermediate steps it's working on.</p><p> Specific information the agent has access to (e.g., product catalogs, company policies).</p><p> Its current beliefs, reasoning path, and progress on a task.</p><p>Without context, an AI agent would be like someone with severe short-term memory loss, unable to build on past interactions or understand the nuances of a situation. MCP is essentially the agreed-upon method for how this vital context is packaged, transmitted, and updated among AI agents and the systems they interact with.</p><p><strong>Why is MCP Essential for AI Agent Communication?</strong></p><p>Think about a conversation between two people. If they constantly forget what was just said, the conversation breaks down. Similarly, for AI agents, especially when they need to collaborate or handle multi-step tasks, robust communication of context is paramount. MCP addresses several key challenges:</p><p><strong>Maintaining Coherence in Multi-Turn Interactions</strong>: For tasks that involve multiple steps (e.g., booking a trip, troubleshooting an issue), an agent needs to remember previous inputs and decisions. MCP ensures this continuity.</p><p><strong>Enabling Seamless Collaboration:</strong> When different AI agents work together (e.g., a sales agent passing a lead to a customer support agent), they need to share relevant context to avoid redundancy and ensure a smooth handover.</p><p><strong>Facilitating Personalization:</strong> By remembering user preferences and past behaviors, agents can offer more tailored and effective responses, enhancing the user experience.</p><p>**Improving Efficiency and Accuracy: **Agents with rich context can make more informed decisions, reducing errors and speeding up task completion.</p><p><strong>Supporting Learning and Adaptation:</strong> As agents interact and gather more context, they can learn from these experiences and improve their performance over time.</p><p><strong>The Building Blocks of MCP: Key Components</strong></p><p>While the exact implementation of MCP can vary, it generally involves several core components that work together to manage context:</p><p>Context Schema/Ontology: This defines the structure and types of information that constitute the context. It's like a dictionary or blueprint that dictates what data points are relevant and how they relate to each other. For example, a schema for a travel agent might define \"destination,\" \"departure date,\" \"traveler name,\" etc.</p><p>Context Store/Memory: This is where the actual context data is held. It could be an in-memory store for short-term context (e.g., current conversation state) or a persistent database for long-term context (e.g., user profiles, historical interactions).</p><p>Context Update Mechanisms: Rules or processes that determine when and how the context is updated. This includes adding new information, modifying existing data, or removing outdated context.</p><p>Context Retrieval Mechanisms: Methods for AI agents to query and retrieve specific pieces of context when needed. This ensures agents can access relevant information quickly and efficiently.</p><p>Context Sharing Protocols: The agreed-upon format and methods for exchanging context between different AI agents or between an agent and external systems (e.g., JSON, XML, or specific API endpoints).</p><p><strong>How MCP Works in Practice: A Simple Scenario</strong></p><p>Let’s illustrate MCP with a simple example: an AI agent helping a user order a pizza.</p><div><pre><code>User: \"I want a pizza.\"\nAgent: \"What kind of pizza?\"\nUser: \"Pepperoni.\"\nAgent: \"What kind of pizza?\" (Agent forgot the previous turn)\nUser: \"Pepperoni! And I want a large.\"\nAgent: \"What kind of pizza?\" (Agent still doesn't remember)\n</code></pre></div><p>This fragmented interaction is due to a lack of context management.</p><p>Initial Interaction (User: \"I want a pizza.\")</p><p>The user's intent (\"order pizza\") is detected.</p><p>MCP records this intent and creates an initial context: {\"task\": \"order_pizza\", \"status\": \"initiated\"}.</p><p>First Response (Agent: \"What kind of pizza?\")</p><p>The agent accesses the context:</p><div><pre><code> {\"task\": \"order_pizza\", \"status\": \"initiated\"}.\n</code></pre></div><p>It determines the next piece of missing information is the pizza type.</p><div><pre><code>User Input (User: \"Pepperoni.\")\n\nThe agent processes \"Pepperoni.\"\n</code></pre></div><div><pre><code> {\"task\": \"order_pizza\", \"status\": \"pizza_type_selected\", \"pizza_type\": \"pepperoni\"}.\n</code></pre></div><p>Second Response (Agent: \"And what size?\")</p><p>The agent accesses the updated context. It knows the pizza type is \"pepperoni\" and now needs the size.</p><div><pre><code>User Input (User: \"And I want a large.\")\n\nThe agent processes \"large.\"\n</code></pre></div><div><pre><code>{\"task\": \"order_pizza\", \"status\": \"size_selected\", \"pizza_type\": \"pepperoni\", \"size\": \"large\"}.\n\n</code></pre></div><p>Final Confirmation (Agent: \"So, a large pepperoni pizza. Is that correct?\")</p><p>The agent accesses the complete context to summarize the order.</p><p>In this example, MCP ensures the agent \"remembers\" the pizza type and builds upon previous inputs, leading to a smooth, coherent conversation.</p><p>Implementing MCP: A Beginner's Approach</p><p>For beginners, implementing MCP might involve:</p><p>Defining your Context Schema:</p><p>Start by listing all the pieces of information your AI agent will need to remember for its tasks.</p><p>Organize these into a logical structure, perhaps using a simple dictionary or JSON object in your code.</p><p><strong>Example for a customer support agent:</strong></p><div><pre><code>{\"user_id\": \"\", \"issue_type\": \"\", \"product_name\": \"\", \"conversation_history\": []}\n</code></pre></div><p>Choosing a Context Store:</p><p>For simple applications, an in-memory dictionary or object can suffice.</p><p>For more persistent or complex needs, consider a simple database (like SQLite) or a key-value store (like Redis).</p><p><strong>Designing Context Update Functions:</strong></p><p>Create functions that take new information and update the context based on predefined rules.</p><div><pre><code>update_context(key, value) or add_to_history(message)\n\n</code></pre></div><p>Designing Context Retrieval Functions:</p><p>Create functions to get specific pieces of information from the context.</p><div><pre><code>get_context(key) or get_full_history()\n</code></pre></div><p>Integrating with Your AI Agent Logic:</p><p>Whenever your AI agent receives a new input or needs to make a decision, it should first retrieve relevant context.</p><p>After the agent processes the input or performs an action, it should update the context.</p><p><strong>Tools and Technologies that Support MCP-like Concepts:</strong></p><p>While \"Model Context Protocol\" is a conceptual framework, many AI development tools and platforms incorporate mechanisms that align with MCP principles:</p><p>Dialogue Management Systems: Frameworks like RASA, Dialogflow, and Microsoft Bot Framework explicitly handle session state and context management for conversational AI.</p><p>Orchestration Layers: Tools that manage the flow of information between different AI models and external systems often incorporate context passing mechanisms.</p><p>Vector Databases: For advanced context management, especially with LLMs, vector databases can store and retrieve semantic context, allowing agents to understand nuanced relationships between pieces of information.</p><p><strong>Challenges and Considerations for Beginners:</strong></p><p>Context Scope: Deciding what information is relevant to keep in context and for how long. Too much context can be unwieldy; too little leads to amnesia.</p><p>Context Persistence: How to store context across sessions or if an agent needs to restart.</p><p>Context Conflict Resolution: What happens if different inputs suggest conflicting context?</p><p>Security and Privacy: Ensuring sensitive context data is handled securely and in compliance with privacy regulations.</p><p>Scalability: How to manage context for thousands or millions of concurrent agent interactions.</p><p>For beginners venturing into <a href=\"https://dev.tourl\">AI agent development</a>, understanding and implementing Model Context Protocol (MCP) is not just beneficial; it’s essential. MCP provides the critical foundation for AI agents to maintain coherence, learn, collaborate, and deliver truly intelligent and personalized experiences. </p><p>By grasping the core concepts of context, its storage, update, and retrieval, you can move beyond building simple, reactive bots to crafting sophisticated, proactive AI agents that understand and adapt to their environment and users. </p><p>As you embark on your journey to build your own AI agents, remember that a robust MCP is the key to unlocking their full potential, enabling them to communicate effectively, remember past interactions, and become indispensable tools in the evolving landscape of AI development. Start simple, iterate, and watch your AI agents become genuinely intelligent conversational partners and task executors.</p>","contentLength":10008,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"The Internet’s Full of Trash Info, So I Made Nexix.

As ferramentas baseadas em IA facilitam o aprendizado, personalizam a experiência e tornam o estudo de programação mais acessível para pessoas de todos os níveis. Neste artigo, vamos entender como essa revolução está acontecendo e quais benefícios ela traz para estudantes e educadores.</p><h4>\n  \n  \n  Como a inteligência artificial está revolucionando o ensino de tecnologia e programação em 2025?\n</h4><p>A resposta é simples: a IA está tornando o aprendizado mais personalizado, eficiente e interativo. Ferramentas inteligentes avaliam o nível de cada aluno e oferecem conteúdos e exercícios adequados, acelerando a curva de aprendizado como mostra o <a href=\"https://www.weforum.org/reports/the-future-of-jobs-report-2023\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">relatório do World Economic Forum</a> sobre o futuro da educação e do trabalho. Além disso, a IA permite que estudantes recebam feedback instantâneo e contínuo, o que antes só era possível com acompanhamento humano constante.\nPor exemplo, plataformas como o GitHub Copilot ajudam alunos a entenderem trechos de código e sugerem correções enquanto eles programam. Ao mesmo tempo, assistentes virtuais respondem dúvidas técnicas e explicam conceitos complexos em linguagem acessível. Isso faz com que o ensino de tecnologia e programação, em 2025, seja muito mais dinâmico e menos dependente de métodos tradicionais, tornando o aprendizado mais atrativo e eficiente.</p><h4>\n  \n  \n  Quais são as principais ferramentas de IA utilizadas no ensino de programação hoje?\n</h4><p>Hoje, várias ferramentas baseadas em IA já fazem parte do cotidiano de estudantes e professores de tecnologia. Entre as mais populares estão:</p><p> sugere código e ajuda na escrita de programas.</p><p> respondem perguntas, simulam diálogos e tiram dúvidas em tempo real.</p><p> usam algoritmos para ajustar o conteúdo e exercícios conforme o progresso do aluno, como a Khan Academy com recursos de IA.</p><p><strong>Sistemas de correção automática:</strong> avaliam códigos enviados pelos alunos e dão feedback instantâneo.</p><p>Essas ferramentas atuam de forma integrada, tornando o ensino mais personalizado e ajudando a superar as dificuldades comuns no aprendizado de linguagens e conceitos de programação.</p><p>IA na educação e o reforço do pensamento crítico</p><p>Mesmo com todos os avanços tecnológicos, é essencial que o uso da inteligência artificial no ensino de tecnologia também estimule o pensamento crítico dos alunos. Ferramentas automatizadas não devem substituir completamente o raciocínio humano, especialmente quando se trata de resolver problemas lógicos ou entender conceitos complexos.</p><p>Por isso, estratégias pedagógicas que combinam IA e raciocínio ativo continuam sendo valorizadas. Um bom exemplo é quando os professores propõem atividades em que o aluno deve: <a href=\"https://comogabaritar.com.br/identifique-a-alternativa-errada-e-corrija-a-no-caderno/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">identifique a alternativa errada e corrija-a no caderno</a>, mesmo após receber sugestões da IA. Essa prática garante que o estudante não apenas aceite a resposta da máquina, mas reflita sobre ela, analise os erros e desenvolva autonomia intelectual.</p><h4>\n  \n  \n  Quais benefícios a IA traz para professores e alunos no ensino de tecnologia?\n</h4><p>A inteligência artificial beneficia tanto os alunos quanto os educadores. Para os alunos, a IA oferece um aprendizado customizado, que respeita o ritmo individual e identifica pontos fortes e fracos com precisão. Isso evita a frustração comum ao tentar acompanhar um ritmo fixo para todos.\nPara os professores, a IA reduz o tempo gasto em tarefas repetitivas, como corrigir exercícios básicos, permitindo que eles foquem em atividades mais criativas e no suporte individualizado aos alunos que precisam de atenção especial. Além disso, a IA oferece dados valiosos sobre o desempenho da turma, facilitando a adaptação das aulas para atingir melhores resultados.</p><h4>\n  \n  \n  Quais são os desafios e cuidados no uso da inteligência artificial no ensino?\n</h4><p>Apesar dos avanços, a utilização da IA no ensino de tecnologia e programação em 2025 exige atenção. É fundamental garantir que as ferramentas respeitem a privacidade dos usuários e que o uso da IA não crie dependência, prejudicando o desenvolvimento do raciocínio crítico e da autonomia dos alunos.\nAlém disso, existe o desafio de evitar vieses presentes nos algoritmos, que podem afetar negativamente o aprendizado de certos grupos. Portanto, educadores e desenvolvedores devem trabalhar juntos para implementar soluções inclusivas e transparentes.</p><p>Como vimos, a inteligência artificial está revolucionando o ensino de tecnologia e programação em 2025, trazendo personalização, eficiência e interatividade ao aprendizado. As ferramentas de IA permitem que alunos aprendam no seu ritmo e que professores otimizem seu tempo, tornando o processo educacional mais moderno e eficaz. Contudo, é essencial usar essas tecnologias de forma ética e consciente, garantindo que o ensino continue sendo humanizado e acessível para todos.\nA revolução promovida pela IA no ensino não apenas transforma o presente, mas também abre caminhos para um futuro onde o aprendizado de tecnologia será cada vez mais inclusivo e adaptado às necessidades individuais.</p>","contentLength":5250,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Day 2: {Not Easy Neither Hard}","url":"https://dev.to/sohmkaviskar/day-2-not-easy-neither-hard-8no","date":1751349941,"author":"Soham Kaviskar","guid":178685,"unread":true,"content":"<p>Day 2 of Learning Python started with len [Subscripting]</p><p>Imagine you want a Specific Letter of Any Unique word </p><p>From this word if you specifically want the letter  \" H \" to be printed\nyou can simply use</p><p>Output: h\nYou will be thinking why I used the number 2 not number 3 in brackets<p>\nThe Reason python number starts from 0.</p></p><p>Strings:\nprint(\"232\" + \"341\")\nCompiles every thing as Text</p><p>Integer=Whole Number:\nprint(123 + 543)\nIn between the number you can ADD, SUB, MULT, DIV, Expo.</p><p>Float - Floating point number\nprint(3.14)<p>\nIt prints the decimal digits</p></p><p>Boolean\nprint(True)</p><p>Mathematical Operators\nMathematical Operators are used in between the INTEGERS\nADDITION ---&gt; +\nMULTIPLICATION ---&gt; * <p>\nDIVISION (Decimal lvl) ---&gt; /</p>\nDIVISION (Normal lvl) ---&gt; //<p>\nSquare or Exponential ---&gt; **</p></p><p>There is Order of priority of Operators\nPEDMAS<p>\nParentheses, Exponents , Multiplication/Division ,ADD/SUB</p></p><p>Question of the Day\nprint(3 * 3 + 3 / 3 - 3)</p><p>The part here was hard to figure out the priority of Operators</p>","contentLength":978,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"FGKJHGJH","url":"https://dev.to/w_james_20227a0e497acad15/fgkjhgjh-1c9o","date":1751349770,"author":"W JAMES","guid":178705,"unread":true,"content":"","contentLength":0,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Top 10 Web Development Companies in the USA","url":"https://dev.to/nextbigtechnology/top-10-web-development-companies-in-the-usa-220p","date":1751348910,"author":"Next Big Technology","guid":178680,"unread":true,"content":"<p>Are you looking for the Top Web Development Companies in USA?

A bad prompt can lead to the wrong code being generated and hours spent reprompting or manually investigating and fixing code. A good prompt leads to the correct code being generated with you only needing to review and test.</p><p>I've been using Ryan Carson's <a href=\"https://github.com/snarktank/ai-dev-tasks\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Cursor rules</a> to help create a clear task list for the features I work on. That task list then forms a series of well-structured prompts you can give to AI to gradually implement the feature step by step. You're front-loading the work and slowing down the start of the development process to be much faster at the end.</p><p>This process works particularly well on large, complex, or unique features that AI will struggle to \"one-shot\". It adds structure to the process, allowing you to manually review and test code at appropriate times. The process adds reliability for large features because it's broken down into small chunks that AI has a good chance of getting right.</p><p>I recently used this process to create a person card web component like this:</p><p>I did try to \"one-shot\" this including the UI mockups as images, but it didn't get close. It struggled particularly around keyboard accessibility in the menu. Reprompting made things worse - I ended up spending lots of time without getting very far. I needed a more structured approach.</p><p>To add Ryan Carson's <a href=\"https://github.com/snarktank/ai-dev-tasks\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Cursor rules</a> to a project, create a  folder in the project root and copy and paste the 3 rules ( files) from the GitHub repository into it. I have the  set to  so that I explicitly need to mention it in a prompt to use it.</p><p>A PRD is a Product Requirements Document that outlines the functional and non-functional requirements for the person card web component in this case. Creating the PRD is the first step in the process.</p><p>You don't have to write the PRD yourself. AI can do the heavy lifting - you just need to provide a couple of sentences to kick things off using the  Cursor rule. This was my prompt to start the PRD creation process:</p><div><pre><code>using @create-prd.mdc create a PRD for a reusble person card web component.\nThere are UX mocks of the card in the @ux-mocks folder.\n</code></pre></div><p>You don't have to be very specific because AI will ask you questions to firm up the requirements:</p><p>You can reference the question numbers in the reply - here was mine:</p><div><pre><code>1. Name, role, status, email, when joined, location. Card is interactive - view profile button + actions on a menu\n2. Some of the uses cases are as you suggest. For internal staff\n3. Vanilla web component. All major browsers. Not themable. Fixed size\n4. Menu should be triggered using click/Enter and arrow keys should move through menu items. Should be positioned in the card at the top right. Menu should close when click outside or ESC\n5. Aria labels, keyboard support, screen reader support\n6. Use plain css for styling. No variants. Use shadow dom to isolate styles\n</code></pre></div><p>AI goes off and creates the PRD in markdown format in the  folder.</p><p>You can then manually tweak the PRD if necessary or even reprompt AI to make changes. It's important that the PRD is very clear on what you want done.</p><p>I was satisfied with what it generated and ready to move on to the task list generation.</p><p>You then get AI to generate a task list using the  Cursor rule.</p><p>I did this in a new chat thread. This was my prompt:</p><div><pre><code>Generate tasks for @prd-person-card-component.md using @generate-tasks\n</code></pre></div><p>AI generates tasks and asks whether to generate subtasks. I just typed  and it completed the task list, creating a new markdown file in the  folder.</p><p>You can tweak the task list or ask AI to make changes. I removed tasks around documentation and a showcase page which I didn't require at this stage. I also wanted to be specific about using Vitest and DOM Testing Library for unit tests.</p><p>I like having the checkboxes and the task list in the source code so it can be used to track progress. Obviously when the feature is done the task file and PRD can be deleted, but it's useful to keep them to refer to if there are any future questions.</p><p>With a clear task list in place, I was now ready for AI to help me write the code.</p><p>The  Cursor rule helps implement the code for each task. The rule also tells AI mark complete and move to task next after confirmation from you. Here was my prompt:</p><div><pre><code>Using @process-task-list, start processing tasks-prd-person-card-component.md.\nDo only the first subtask and wait for me to review before continuing.\n</code></pre></div><p>Even though the Cursor rule says \"One subtask at a time\" I find I need to remind AI of this - hence the second sentence in the prompt. You can also just hit the  option in Cursor if you see it doing more than it should be doing.</p><p>I find it important to review and test the code after each subtask. The code can be tested before the change is accepted. The code can also be tweaked if necessary - manually or via an AI prompt.</p><p>Taking the time to review and test the code after each subtask may seem overkill but it helps catch AI going a little off track and enables you to understand the generated code. There's an urge to just move on to the next subtask, but resisting this will likely mean you complete the feature more efficiently.</p><p>Here are a couple of prompts for changes in the early tasks:</p><div><pre><code>- Use proper private members instead of TS ones\n- Use arrow functions to avoid the \"this\" problem in the WC class\n- Use :focus-visible rather than :focus for focus indicators\n</code></pre></div><p>It's worth noting that these code preferences can be added to Cursor rules. I don't write many web components, so I didn't have anything in place.</p><p>Sometimes AI doesn't mark the subtask as complete but a quick  prompts it to do so.</p><p>When I'm ready to move to the next subtask, I prompt <code>\"Move to the next subtask\"</code> in the same thread, even if you've prompted for code changes after the previous subtask.</p><p>I generally complete all the subtasks in a single thread and start a new thread for a new task. Here was my prompt to start the 2nd task:</p><div><pre><code>Using @process-task-list, carry on processing tasks-prd-person-card-component.md on task 2 subtask 2.1.\nAllow me to review before continuing.\n</code></pre></div><p>As I move through the tasks, you may find some that are already partially or fully complete. I found this with <code>\"Task 2.4 Implement menu item actions by dispatching custom events\"</code>. AI reworked the code to use an event handler for each menu item rather than a single one. So, I prompted:</p><div><pre><code>The previous implementation is fine - a single event with the option name in the event data\n</code></pre></div><p>AI agreed and gave the reason (simpler code, consistent API, flexible). This gave me confidence in my judgement.</p><p>So, it's even more important to thoroughly review and test the code through the final steps to avoid unnecessary code being added.</p><p>Towards the end of the task list I adjust my task kickoff prompt to the following to get AI to think about the possibility of the task already being completed:</p><div><pre><code>Using @process-task-list, carry on processing tasks-prd-person-card-component.md on task X subtask X.1.\nAllow me to review before continuing.\nYou may find a subtask is already completed, so only make changes if necessary and can make improvements.\n</code></pre></div><p>AI did make some useful improvements to subtasks that were already partially complete. For example:</p><ul><li>Smooth transitions for focus/hover states</li><li>High contrast mode support</li><li>Addition of a component initialised event</li></ul><p>Overall, it took me a couple of hours to build the person card component using this approach. The process wasn't perfect - it did go off track a few times. However, getting it back on track was quick because the iterations are small and very focused.</p><p>I'm going to continue to use this process for work that won't \"one-shot\". I'd encourage you to give it a try.

If AI were to deliver in this area, then meaningless language wars can be averted, and </p> (at least in my opinion) reasons\nto prefer one language, i.e. the availability of some exotic library, may be avoided. </p><p>For my foray in this area, I chose to interface to the library <a href=\"https://github.com/chrisarg/Bit\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Bit</a> that I  wrote to support text fingerprinting for some research \napplications.

Hence, this is a test case that can illustrate the utility of Perl in using code that executes transparently in various hardware assets. </p>\nSimilar to Hanson's original implementation (after all, my work is based on his!) the library interface is implemented to <p>\nan Abstract Data Type in C; a crucial aspect of the implementation is to manage memory and avoid leaks without looking (at all, or as little as possible!) under the hood.</p>\nFor our experiments we will use Claude 3.7 Thinking Sonnet through the Github Copilot  interface. This is going to be a multipart series post that will be published throughout the summer. \nOur focus will be on interactions between me and the bot, and in particular critiquing the responses it has given me for both high level (e.g. choice of approach) and technical aspects of the project.</p><p>For the prompt I provided the \"bit.c\", \"bit.h\", makefile and the readme file of the Bit github repository as context to Claude and then I issued the following:</p><div><pre><code>Look at the bit.h file that defines two abstract data types Bit_T and Bit_T_DB\nand their interfaces in C.

The difference? One saves you minutes. The other saves you entire departments worth of effort.</p><p>That’s the real promise of AI in operations. And not just surface-level automation like email sorting or chatbot scripts. We're talking about building intelligent back-end systems that anticipate needs, self-improve, and reroute themselves when things go sideways.</p><p>What Operational AI Actually Looks Like</p><p>Let’s get specific. Imagine a logistics company using AI to:</p><p>Predict delivery delays based on historical traffic and weather data</p><p>Automatically reassign drivers to meet SLAs</p><p>Optimize warehouse picking routes based on current demand</p><p>Reduce idle inventory through demand-based forecasting</p><p>Each of these touches different systems. They require not just good models—but integration, logic design, real-time data streaming, and feedback loops.</p><p>That’s what development services offer: the bridge between AI theory and operational results.</p><p>AI as the Glue Between Disjointed Systems</p><p>If you’ve worked in operations, you know the biggest bottleneck often isn’t people—it’s platforms. Tools that don’t talk to each other. Data stuck in silos. Insights buried in spreadsheets.</p><p>AI done right acts as the glue between these parts:</p><p>A model reads CRM data, correlates it with inventory logs, and triggers actions in your ERP.</p><p>Anomaly detection tools run quietly in the background, flagging issues before humans spot them.</p><p>Predictive alerts help managers reallocate resources before a backlog snowballs.</p><p>This orchestration is what makes modern operations resilient—and it starts with a partner who can architect that intelligence.</p><p>Avoiding the Trap of Over-Automation</p><p>Let’s be clear: not every process needs a neural network. And not every workflow should be handed over to an algorithm.</p><p>Great AI developers know where to draw the line. They ask:</p><p>Is this process repetitive and data-rich?</p><p>Are the stakes low enough to start small?</p><p>Can we include human-in-the-loop options?</p><p>Artificial intelligence development services that succeed in ops don’t just automate—they enhance. They leave room for human judgment where it matters, while removing friction where it doesn’t.</p><p>Real Examples: AI in Action</p><p>Here are a few real-world wins we’ve seen from custom AI systems in ops:</p><p>Insurance Claims: NLP models that read, classify, and triage incoming claims, cutting manual review time by 60%</p><p>Manufacturing: Vision systems that detect defects earlier in the assembly line, reducing rework costs</p><p>Customer Service: Sentiment models that escalate high-risk interactions faster, improving retention</p><p>These aren’t futuristic dreams. They’re running in production today—because businesses invested in the right AI talent early.</p><p>Thinking in Loops, Not Lanes</p><p>AI is most effective when it’s not thought of as a project, but a system. Not a feature, but a loop:</p><p>Collect → Learn → Decide → Act → Repeat</p><p>This is where custom development services shine. They don’t just build models and walk away. They design systems that learn from themselves. Systems that evolve.</p><p>And that means your operations keep getting sharper, leaner, and faster—not just once, but continuously.</p><p>Final Thoughts: Rethink What’s Possible</p><p>If your ops team still relies on weekly reports and gut checks to make decisions, you’re playing defense.</p><p>The result? Less firefighting. More foresight.</p><p>Fewer meetings. More momentum.</p><p>Smarter operations. Happier teams.</p><p>And most importantly, a business that runs itself—so you can focus on what comes next.</p>","contentLength":3545,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Make requests to your API through AI 👇","url":"https://dev.to/onedev/make-requests-to-your-api-through-ai-3h5m","date":1751326530,"author":"OneDev","guid":177009,"unread":true,"content":"<h2>Build AI-Driven API Requests in Your React App — With Natural Language</h2>","contentLength":72,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"azd CLI extension framework","url":"https://dev.to/kristenwomack/azd-cli-extension-framework-4kh4","date":1751325221,"author":"Kristen Womack","guid":177008,"unread":true,"content":"<h2>\n  \n  \n  I wrote about azd extensions, a new way to customize the Azure Developer CLI\n</h2><p>We recently added a new alpha feature to the Azure Developer CLI () that lets you build and share your own CLI commands. </p><p>The idea is simple: sometimes you want  to do something specific to your project or workflow, maybe scaffold a repo, run a custom validation, or integrate with a tool your team uses.

The navbar wasn't responsive, leaving a ton of white space on mobile screens and making it a less-than-desirable experience. Instead of a full navigation bar cramming into mobile view, I needed a proper hamburger menu.</p><p>Here's what I told each assistant:</p><blockquote><p>\"There's an issue with mobile view on the site. I think the main problem is with the navbar. But I don't think it makes sense to have a nav bar for a mobile site. We should make the site responsive and add a sticky nav bar with a hamburger menu instead of the full navigation bar once the site hits mobile-sized screens.\"</p></blockquote><p>Here's how Continue, GitHub Copilot, and Cursor handled this real-world debugging scenario.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Continue: Permission-Driven and Educational\n</h2><p>I used <a href=\"https://continue.dev/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Continue</a> in <a href=\"https://docs.continue.dev/agent/how-to-use-it\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Agent mode</a>, giving it context from , , and .</p><ul><li>Created a dedicated hamburger menu component</li><li>Asked for permission between file changes</li><li>When I got a transparency issue with the menu panel, it fixed it in one go</li><li>It added comments to understand the steps it was taking in the code and debug logs in the code to help me see what was working and when</li><li>Everything worked within 12 minutes</li></ul><p>When I tested the same fix using Continue's <a href=\"https://docs.continue.dev/chat/how-to-use-it\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Chat mode</a> instead of Agent mode, it took longer but provided much more thorough explanations. The conversation was more educational, walking me through the reasoning behind each change.</p><p>It is worth noting that Continue allows you to set rules, so if learning is your priority, you can create a rule for that.</p><p>Here's an example from their docs: <a href=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fk95sqik6tu8aay0etkpt.png\"><img src=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fk95sqik6tu8aay0etkpt.png\" alt=\"Rules for Continue\" width=\"800\" height=\"146\"></a></p><p>Continue balances efficiency with learning. Agent mode got me working code fast, while Chat mode taught me the \"why\" behind the solutions.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  GitHub Copilot: Fast &amp; (a bit) Frustrating\n</h2><p>Copilot started by unnecessarily converting a Svelte component, then immediately threw a TypeScript error:<code>Argument of type 'EventTarget' is not assignable to parameter of type 'Node'</code></p><p>I'm not sure why it decided that the  needed to be converted. At the very least, that's outside of the scope of this PR, in my opinion.</p><p>It was able to solve the problem pretty quickly when I used the \"Fix with Copilot\" function, explaining, \"You should cast e.target to Node when passing it to .contains() to resolve the type error.\"</p><p>The hamburger menu initially didn't appear at all. The responsiveness was \"fixed\" because the navigation disappeared, but users couldn't access any menu items.</p><p>After back-and-forth debugging, Copilot resorted to  declarations (not ideal) and the old \"turn the background red\" debugging trick. Even when the menu became visible, clicking it did nothing.</p><p>Eventually, we identified JavaScript as the culprit. Copilot fixed it, but then the menu links appeared directly over the page content without any background container. More back-and-forth with questionable styling decisions followed.</p><p>It was to the point where I definitely could fix this faster than having a back-and-forth with Copilot, so I called it. After that, I also realized there was a bug where, after expanding the hamburger menu on mobile and then switching to desktop view, the mobile menu remained open on top of the restored navigation bar.</p><p>: About 20 minutes, with me ultimately fixing the styles myself.</p><p>: Minimal. Copilot told me what it was doing, but didn't really explain its approach or help me understand the underlying problem.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Cursor: Comprehensive but Presumptuous\n</h2><p>Cursor's response was immediate and organized:</p><ol><li>Automatically read the global CSS</li><li>Outlined exactly what needed to change and why</li><li>Provided all necessary file updates</li><li>Hit the same cross-page JavaScript issue as Copilot</li></ol><p>Cursor went beyond my request, automatically improving mobile styles across the site that I hadn't asked for. This raises an interesting question: should AI assistants make assumptions about what you \"really\" need?</p><p>: About 15 minutes to complete.</p><p>: Good explanations of changes. I appreciate that it gives more information on why errors were happening in the context of using Astro.</p><p>Here's something I noticed that none of the assistants addressed: familiarity bias. Cursor and GitHub Copilot felt nearly identical to use, so I moved faster with them. Continue required slightly more of a learning curve, which actually slowed me down initially but provided better educational value.</p><p>This isn't a knock against Continue. It's a reminder that switching tools comes with costs, even when the new tool might be better in the long term.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Debugging vs. Building: Different Skills Required\n</h2><p>This debugging scenario revealed something my first test missed, that building new features and fixing existing problems require different AI assistance approaches.</p><ul><li>Focus on \"what should this do?\"</li></ul><ul><li>Understanding legacy decisions</li><li>Focusing on \"why isn't this working?\"</li></ul><p>Continue did well with the debugging mindset, asking permission before changes and explaining the reasoning. Copilot and Cursor were more aggressive about \"fixing\" things, sometimes creating new problems in the process.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Which AI Coding Assistant Wins for Debugging?\n</h3><p>: Continue, especially in Chat mode. It helped me understand not just what was broken, but why the original approach failed.</p><p>: Cursor, if you don't mind AI making assumptions about improvements you didn't request.</p><p>This comparison reinforced something I mentioned in my first post: the tool is only part of the equation. Each assistant performed differently not just because of their capabilities, but because of how they approached the problem-solving process.</p><p>Continue treated debugging as a learning opportunity. Copilot treated it as a code completion task. Cursor treated it as a comprehensive redesign project.</p><p>If you want to know which coding assistant helps developers grow when you're debugging, try this: Before asking for a fix, ask the AI to help you understand why the original code failed. The debugging skills you develop will be more valuable than any individual fix.</p>","contentLength":6063,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"5 Boring Tasks I Gave to My AI Agent Today (That Saved Me Hours)","url":"https://dev.to/blockopensource/5-boring-tasks-i-gave-to-my-ai-agent-today-that-saved-me-hours-45ef","date":1751322865,"author":"Angie Jones","guid":176959,"unread":true,"content":"<p>Whenever people talk about AI, they highlight the flashiest use cases like fully coded apps built by agents or cinematic video generation.

I wanted to see where our time went, how work was distributed, and any patterns or dependencies across projects.</p><p>In under a minute, Goose gave me a report with productivity metrics, workload distribution, and notable dependencies between issue threads (e.g. one fix blocking another).</p><p>This kind of synthesis normally requires me to manually scan a bunch of repos and cross-reference PRs or issue comments. Not today.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  2️⃣ Extracting Action Items from a Long Slack Thread\n</h2><p>You know when a Slack thread starts as a quick brainstorm and somehow grows into a novel? Ours had 169 replies today 😂, and buried in there were some important ideas.</p><p>So, I asked Goose to analyze the entire thread and extract a clean list of action items.</p><p>In one minute, I had a focused to-do list with responsible parties, deadlines (when mentioned), and themes. These takeaways will likely shape our Q3 goals, and when I'm ready, I can even have Goose go create GitHub issues for all of them!</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  3️⃣ Creating a Roadmap from Community Feedback\n</h2><p>Our Goose community is active across GitHub, Slack, and Discord. There's tons of feedback, but it's scattered.\nI had Goose pull and analyze open questions, bug reports, feature requests, and discussion threads across all three platforms.</p><p>A ranked list of the top 10 items we need to address, including a short description of each issue along with the estimated effort of the tasks. This gave us a nice jumpstart on our roadmap planning.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  4️⃣ Fixing My CSS Breakpoints (Because I Gave Up)\n</h2><p>Confession: CSS and I are not friends. After 30 minutes of fighting with breakpoints, spacing, and container widths, I gave the problem to Goose by showing it a screenshot of the page.</p><p>Goose spotted the issue immediately and rewrote my media query logic as well as some other key CSS I was missing. </p><h2>\n  \n  \n  5️⃣ Fixing Broken Links After a Big Doc Restructure\n</h2><p>I restructured a big internal doc set and needed to update all internal links, reroute old paths, and make sure nothing was broken. \nI handled the restructure manually (it was delicate so I wanted to do it myself), then asked Goose to crawl the doc, find broken or outdated links, fix them and add redirects where needed.</p><p>No broken links leading to 404 errors. Just tidy documentation.</p><p>Most AI posts show off what's possible. I'm focused on what was promised.\nThe whole point was to offload the tedious stuff so we could focus on the work that actually matters, and that's exactly what I'm using AI for.</p><p>What everyday tasks are you delegating to AI agents?

As AI applications become increasingly complex, customers want to deploy multiple models in a coordinated group that collectively process inference requests for an application. In addition, with the evolution of generative AI applications, many use cases now require inference workflows—sequences of interconnected models operating in predefined logical flows. This trend drives a growing need for more sophisticated inference offerings.</p><p>To address this need, we are introducing a new capability in the <a href=\"https://sagemaker.readthedocs.io/en/stable/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">SageMaker Python SDK</a> that revolutionizes how you build and deploy inference workflows on SageMaker. We will take Amazon Search as an example to show case how this feature is used in helping customers building inference workflows. This new Python SDK capability provides a streamlined and simplified experience that abstracts away the underlying complexities of packaging and deploying groups of models and their collective inference logic, allowing you to focus on what matter most—your business logic and model integrations.</p><p>In this post, we provide an overview of the user experience, detailing how to set up and deploy these workflows with multiple models using the SageMaker Python SDK. We walk through examples of building complex inference workflows, deploying them to SageMaker endpoints, and invoking them for real-time inference. We also show how customers like Amazon Search plan to use SageMaker Inference workflows to provide more relevant search results to Amazon shoppers.</p><p>Whether you are building a simple two-step process or a complex, multimodal AI application, this new feature provides the tools you need to bring your vision to life. This tool aims to make it easy for developers and businesses to create and manage complex AI systems, helping them build more powerful and efficient AI applications.</p><p>In the following sections, we dive deeper into details of the SageMaker Python SDK, walk through practical examples, and showcase how this new capability can transform your AI development and deployment process.</p><h2>Key improvements and user experience</h2><p>The SageMaker Python SDK now includes new features for creating and managing inference workflows. These additions aim to address common challenges in developing and deploying inference workflows:</p><ul><li><strong>Deployment of multiple models</strong>&nbsp;– The core of this new experience is the deployment of multiple models as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/amazon-sagemaker-adds-new-inference-capabilities-to-help-reduce-foundation-model-deployment-costs-and-latency/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">inference components</a>&nbsp;within a single SageMaker endpoint. With this approach, you can create a more unified inference workflow. By consolidating multiple models into one endpoint, you can reduce the number of endpoints that need to be managed. This consolidation can also improve operational tasks, resource utilization, and potentially costs.</li><li><strong>Workflow definition with workflow mode</strong>&nbsp;– The new workflow mode extends the existing&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/how-it-works-modelbuilder-creation.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Model Builder</a> capabilities. It allows for the definition of inference workflows using Python code. Users familiar with the  class might find this feature to be an extension of their existing knowledge. This mode enables creating multi-step workflows, connecting models, and specifying the data flow between different models in the workflows. The goal is to reduce the complexity of managing these workflows and enable you to focus more on the logic of the resulting compound AI system.</li><li><strong>Development and deployment options</strong>&nbsp;– A new deployment option has been introduced for the development phase. This feature is designed to allow for quicker deployment of workflows to development environments. The intention is to enable faster testing and refinement of workflows. This could be particularly relevant when experimenting with different configurations or adjusting models.</li><li>&nbsp;– The SDK now provides options for invoking individual models or entire workflows. You can choose to call a specific inference component used in a workflow or the entire workflow. This flexibility can be useful in scenarios where access to a specific model is needed, or when only a portion of the workflow needs to be executed.</li><li>&nbsp;– You can use SageMaker&nbsp;<a href=\"https://github.com/aws/deep-learning-containers\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Deep Learning Containers</a>&nbsp;(DLCs) or the SageMaker distribution that comes preconfigured with various model serving libraries and tools. These are intended to serve as a starting point for common use cases.</li></ul><p>To get started, use the SageMaker Python SDK to deploy your models as inference components. Then, use the workflow mode to create an inference workflow, represented as Python code using the container of your choice. Deploy the workflow container as another inference component on the same endpoints as the models or a dedicated endpoint. You can run the workflow by invoking the inference component that represents the workflow. The user experience is entirely code-based, using the SageMaker Python SDK. This approach allows you to define, deploy, and manage inference workflows using SDK abstractions offered by this feature and Python programming. The workflow mode provides flexibility to specify complex sequences of model invocations and data transformations, and the option to deploy as components or endpoints caters to various scaling and integration needs.</p><p>The following diagram illustrates a reference architecture using the SageMaker Python SDK.</p><p>The improved SageMaker Python SDK introduces a more intuitive and flexible approach to building and deploying AI inference workflows. Let’s explore the key components and classes that make up the experience:</p><ul><li> simplifies the process of packaging individual models as inference components. It handles model loading, dependency management, and container configuration automatically.</li><li>The  class provides a standardized way to define custom inference logic that orchestrates multiple models in the workflow. Users implement the  method to specify this logic and can use an orchestration library or none at all (plain Python).</li><li>A single  call handles the deployment of the components and workflow orchestrator.</li><li>The Python SDK supports invocation against the custom inference workflow or individual inference components.</li><li>The Python SDK supports both synchronous and streaming inference.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;is an abstract base class that serves as a template for defining custom inference orchestration logic. It standardizes the structure of entry point-based inference scripts, making it straightforward for users to create consistent and reusable code. The  method in the class is an abstract method that users implement to define their custom orchestration logic.</p><div><div><pre><code>class CustomOrchestrator (ABC):\n\"\"\"\nTemplated class used to standardize the structure of an entry point based inference script.\n\"\"\"\n\n    @abstractmethod\n    def handle(self, data, context=None):\n        \"\"\"abstract class for defining an entrypoint for the model server\"\"\"\n        return NotImplemented</code></pre></div></div><p>With this templated class, users can integrate into their custom workflow code, and then point to this code in the model builder using a file path or directly using a class or method name. Using this class and the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/package-and-deploy-classical-ml-and-llms-easily-with-amazon-sagemaker-part-1-pysdk-improvements/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">ModelBuilder</a>&nbsp;class, it enables a more streamlined workflow for AI inference:</p><ol><li>Users define their custom workflow by implementing the  class.</li><li>The custom  is passed to  using the <code>ModelBuilder inference_spec</code> parameter.</li><li> packages the  along with the model artifacts.</li><li>The packaged model is deployed to a SageMaker endpoint (for example, using a TorchServe container).</li><li>When invoked, the SageMaker endpoint uses the custom handle() function defined in the  to handle the input payload.</li></ol><p>In the follow sections, we provide two examples of custom workflow orchestrators implemented with plain Python code. For simplicity, the examples use two inference components.</p><p>We explore how to create a simple workflow that deploys two large language models (LLMs) on SageMaker Inference endpoints along with a simple Python orchestrator that calls the two models. We create an IT customer service workflow where one model processes the initial request and another suggests solutions. You can find the example notebook in the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://github.com/aws-samples/sagemaker-genai-hosting-examples/tree/main/Llama3.1-Mistral-workflow\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">GitHub repo</a>.</p><p>To run the example notebooks, you need an AWS account with an&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/iam/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">AWS Identity and Access Management</a>&nbsp;(IAM) role with&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/security_iam_id-based-policy-examples.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">least-privilege permissions</a>&nbsp;to manage resources created. For details, refer to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/accounts/latest/reference/manage-acct-creating.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Create an AWS account</a>. You might need to request a service quota increase for the corresponding SageMaker hosting instances. In this example, we host multiple models on the same SageMaker endpoint, so we use two ml.g5.24xlarge SageMaker hosting instances.</p><h2>Python inference orchestration</h2><p>First, let’s define our custom orchestration class that inherits from . The workflow is structured around a custom inference entry point that handles the request data, processes it, and retrieves predictions from the configured model endpoints. See the following code:</p><div><pre><code>class PythonCustomInferenceEntryPoint(CustomOrchestrator):\n    def __init__(self, region_name, endpoint_name, component_names):\n        self.region_name = region_name\n        self.endpoint_name = endpoint_name\n        self.component_names = component_names\n    \n    def preprocess(self, data):\n        payload = {\n            \"inputs\": data.decode(\"utf-8\")\n        }\n        return json.dumps(payload)\n\n    def _invoke_workflow(self, data):\n        # First model (Llama) inference\n        payload = self.preprocess(data)\n        \n        llama_response = self.client.invoke_endpoint(\n            EndpointName=self.endpoint_name,\n            Body=payload,\n            ContentType=\"application/json\",\n            InferenceComponentName=self.component_names[0]\n        )\n        llama_generated_text = json.loads(llama_response.get('Body').read())['generated_text']\n        \n        # Second model (Mistral) inference\n        parameters = {\n            \"max_new_tokens\": 50\n        }\n        payload = {\n            \"inputs\": llama_generated_text,\n            \"parameters\": parameters\n        }\n        mistral_response = self.client.invoke_endpoint(\n            EndpointName=self.endpoint_name,\n            Body=json.dumps(payload),\n            ContentType=\"application/json\",\n            InferenceComponentName=self.component_names[1]\n        )\n        return {\"generated_text\": json.loads(mistral_response.get('Body').read())['generated_text']}\n    \n    def handle(self, data, context=None):\n        return self._invoke_workflow(data)</code></pre></div><p>This code performs the following functions:</p><ul><li>Defines the orchestration that sequentially calls two models using their inference component names</li><li>Processes the response from the first model before passing it to the second model</li><li>Returns the final generated response</li></ul><p>This plain Python approach provides flexibility and control over the request-response flow, enabling seamless cascading of outputs across multiple model components.</p><h2>Build and deploy the workflow</h2><p>To deploy the workflow, we first create our inference components and then build the custom workflow. One inference component will host a Meta Llama 3.1 8B model, and the other will host a Mistral 7B model.</p><div><div><pre><code>from sagemaker.serve import ModelBuilder\nfrom sagemaker.serve.builder.schema_builder import SchemaBuilder\n\n# Create a ModelBuilder instance for Llama 3.1 8B\n# Pre-benchmarked ResourceRequirements will be taken from JumpStart, as Llama-3.1-8b is a supported model.\nllama_model_builder = ModelBuilder(\n    model=\"meta-textgeneration-llama-3-1-8b\",\n    schema_builder=SchemaBuilder(sample_input, sample_output),\n    inference_component_name=llama_ic_name,\n    instance_type=\"ml.g5.24xlarge\"\n)\n\n# Create a ModelBuilder instance for Mistral 7B model.\nmistral_mb = ModelBuilder(\n    model=\"huggingface-llm-mistral-7b\",\n    instance_type=\"ml.g5.24xlarge\",\n    schema_builder=SchemaBuilder(sample_input, sample_output),\n    inference_component_name=mistral_ic_name,\n    resource_requirements=ResourceRequirements(\n        requests={\n           \"memory\": 49152,\n           \"num_accelerators\": 2,\n           \"copies\": 1\n        }\n    ),\n    instance_type=\"ml.g5.24xlarge\"\n)</code></pre></div></div><p>Now we can tie it all together to create one more  to which we pass the , which contains the  objects we just created for each inference component and the custom workflow. Then we call the  function to prepare the workflow for deployment.</p><div><div><pre><code># Create workflow ModelBuilder\norchestrator= ModelBuilder(\n    inference_spec=PythonCustomInferenceEntryPoint(\n        region_name=region,\n        endpoint_name=llama_mistral_endpoint_name,\n        component_names=[llama_ic_name, mistral_ic_name],\n    ),\n    dependencies={\n        \"auto\": False,\n        \"custom\": [\n            \"cloudpickle\",\n            \"graphene\",\n            # Define other dependencies here.\n        ],\n    },\n    sagemaker_session=Session(),\n    role_arn=role,\n    resource_requirements=ResourceRequirements(\n        requests={\n           \"memory\": 4096,\n           \"num_accelerators\": 1,\n           \"copies\": 1,\n           \"num_cpus\": 2\n        }\n    ),\n    name=custom_workflow_name, # Endpoint name for your custom workflow\n    schema_builder=SchemaBuilder(sample_input={\"inputs\": \"test\"}, sample_output=\"Test\"),\n    modelbuilder_list=[llama_model_builder, mistral_mb] # Inference Component ModelBuilders created in Step 2\n)\n# call the build function to prepare the workflow for deployment\norchestrator.build()</code></pre></div></div><p>In the preceding code snippet, you can comment out the section that defines the  to have the custom workflow deployed on a separate endpoint instance, which can be a dedicated CPU instance to handle the custom workflow payload.</p><p>By calling the  function, we deploy the custom workflow and the inference components to your desired instance type, in this example ml.g5.24.xlarge. If you choose to deploy the custom workflow to a separate instance, by default, it will use the ml.c5.xlarge instance type. You can set <code>inference_workflow_instance_type</code> and <code>inference_workflow_initial_instance_count</code> to configure the instances required to host the custom workflow.</p><div><div><pre><code>predictors = orchestrator.deploy(\n    instance_type=\"ml.g5.24xlarge\",\n    initial_instance_count=1,\n    accept_eula=True, # Required for Llama3\n    endpoint_name=llama_mistral_endpoint_name\n    # inference_workflow_instance_type=\"ml.t2.medium\", # default\n    # inference_workflow_initial_instance_count=1 # default\n)</code></pre></div></div><p>After you deploy the workflow, you can invoke the endpoint using the predictor object:</p><div><pre><code>from sagemaker.serializers import JSONSerializer\npredictors[-1].serializer = JSONSerializer()\npredictors[-1].predict(\"Tell me a story about ducks.\")</code></pre></div><p>You can also invoke each inference component in the deployed endpoint. For example, we can test the Llama inference component with a synchronous invocation, and Mistral with streaming:</p><div><div><pre><code>from sagemaker.predictor import Predictor\n# create predictor for the inference component of Llama model\nllama_predictor = Predictor(endpoint_name=llama_mistral_endpoint_name, component_name=llama_ic_name)\nllama_predictor.content_type = \"application/json\"\n\nllama_predictor.predict(json.dumps(payload))</code></pre></div></div><p>When handling the streaming response, we need to read each line of the output separately. The following example code demonstrates this streaming handling by checking for newline characters to separate and print each token in real time:</p><div><div><pre><code>mistral_predictor = Predictor(endpoint_name=llama_mistral_endpoint_name, component_name=mistral_ic_name)\nmistral_predictor.content_type = \"application/json\"\n\nbody = json.dumps({\n    \"inputs\": prompt,\n    # specify the parameters as needed\n    \"parameters\": parameters\n})\n\nfor line in mistral_predictor.predict_stream(body):\n    decoded_line = line.decode('utf-8')\n    if '\\n' in decoded_line:\n        # Split by newline to handle multiple tokens in the same line\n        tokens = decoded_line.split('\\n')\n        for token in tokens[:-1]:  # Print all tokens except the last one with a newline\n            print(token)\n        # Print the last token without a newline, as it might be followed by more tokens\n        print(tokens[-1], end='')\n    else:\n        # Print the token without a newline if it doesn't contain '\\n'\n        print(decoded_line, end='')</code></pre></div></div><p>So far, we have walked through the example code to demonstrate how to build complex inference logic using Python orchestration, deploy them to SageMaker endpoints, and invoke them for real-time inference. The Python SDK automatically handles the following:</p><ul><li>Model packaging and container configuration</li><li>Dependency management and environment setup</li><li>Endpoint creation and component coordination</li></ul><p>Whether you’re building a simple workflow of two models or a complex multimodal application, the new SDK provides the building blocks needed to bring your inference workflows to life with minimal boilerplate code.</p><h2>Customer story: Amazon Search</h2><p><a href=\"https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/retail/amazon-makes-it-easier-to-search-and-shop\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Amazon Search</a> is a critical component of the Amazon shopping experience, processing an enormous volume of queries across billions of products across diverse categories.

Most of their optimizations are based on battle tested best practices.</p><p>In a recent talk titled “Scaling Postgres for OpenAI”, OpenAI Technical Staff shared how they scaled Postgres for their use-cases. My takeaway from the talk is that they aren’t using exotic optimizations to get the best performance. They’re monitoring their database, finding bottlenecks, and using best practices to fix issues.</p><p>Here’s the context. OpenAI has a single primary database and several read replicas. At the start of their performance journey, the primary served reads and writes, while the read replicas served a subset of read queries. Over time, they had several incidents related to handling high traffic, and spent time hardening the database.</p><p>The talk has more in-depth analysis, but I want to highlight how they approach performance. Every optimization they made is in service of reducing load on their primary database as much as possible. </p><h3>\n  \n  \n  1. Review Your Application for Unneeded Queries\n</h3><p>The team profiled their application and found code paths with read queries, that didn't need to be made. Removing queries from these code paths reduced the number of queries that hit the primary database.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  2. Audit ORM Queries and use raw SQL where needed\n</h3><p>Object Relation Mapping (ORM) libraries let us interact with the database without writing a single line of SQL. We get to focus on the relationships between our data rather than how to write the correct joins. The tradeoff is that the ORM may generate complex SQL, when simpler queries suffice. The OpenAI team reviewed the generated SQL from their ORM, and replaced over-complicated queries with raw SQL where it made sense.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  3. Move Read Queries to the Read Replicas\n</h3><p>To reduce load on their primary database, the OpenAI team moved as many read queries to read replicas as possible. There is a consistency tradeoff when moving read queries to read replicas. That is, replicas may take some time to be updated with the latest changes from the primary, especially if replica lag is high. However, reducing load on the primary by an order of magnitude was an acceptable tradeoff for potential impacts to consistency. </p><h3>\n  \n  \n  4. Use Timeouts For Queries\n</h3><p>Long running queries may hold onto connections and prevent other transactions from being processed. Configuring statement and transaction timeouts ensures the database won’t fail to process other queries due to a few long-running transactions. These can be applied at the application level, or in Postgres itself.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  5. Use Connection Pools to optimize connection usage\n</h3><p>The OpenAI team introduced PgBouncer, a connection pooler for Postgres, to their system to optimize connection pool usage. Connection Pooling is a common technique to efficiently manage the number of connections an application opens to a database. Most database libraries provide connection pooling at the application level. Your database library will manage the connections and re-use them as efficiently as possible. PgBouncer takes it one level lower to the database server. App Servers connect to the PgBouncer proxy just like the would a database, and PgBouncer creates or re-uses connections as efficiently as possible. Whether you choose to go with PgBouncer, or use built-in functionality from your DB library, connection pooling is always a good idea.</p><p>Database performance doesn't have to be complicated. Even hyper-scale AI companies lean on best practices to get the performance they're looking for. </p><p>To learn more about how OpenAI scaled their postgres instances give the talks a view here:</p><p>Leave a comment about how you've improved database performance in your systems!</p><p>And here are some related resources about PgBouncer and Postgres Config:</p>","contentLength":4164,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"🌟 5 Things I Wish I Knew Before Starting Freelancing as a Teen Designer","url":"https://dev.to/alizehcodes/5-things-i-wish-i-knew-before-starting-freelancing-as-a-teen-designer-5egm","date":1751316372,"author":"Alizeh Codes","guid":176916,"unread":true,"content":"<p>Starting freelancing as a  can be both exciting and overwhelming — especially if you're a designer just stepping into the online world.</p><p>I'm sharing my honest experiences and the things I  someone had told me before I began.

Traditional cybersecurity measures, while essential, often fall short in the face of sophisticated and rapidly changing cyber attacks. Enter AI-powered cybersecurity systems, offering a proactive approach to threat management by predicting and preventing attacks before they can cause damage . Let's dive into how these systems work and their potential impact.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  1. Understanding AI in Cybersecurity 🧠\n</h3><p>Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) are revolutionizing cybersecurity . But what exactly do these terms mean in this context?</p><ul><li><strong>Key Point 1: Defining AI and ML in Cybersecurity</strong><ul><li><em>Artificial Intelligence (AI)</em>: The capability of a machine to imitate intelligent human behavior. In cybersecurity, this involves using algorithms to analyze data, identify patterns, and make decisions to protect systems and data .</li><li>: A subset of AI that allows systems to learn from data without being explicitly programmed. ML algorithms can be trained on vast datasets to recognize and respond to cyber threats .</li></ul></li><li><strong>Key Point 2: Types of AI Techniques</strong><ul><li>: Involves training a model on labeled data, where the algorithm learns to map inputs to outputs. Example: Identifying phishing emails based on labeled examples .</li><li>: Used to find patterns in unlabeled data. Example: Detecting anomalous network behavior indicative of a cyber attack .</li><li>: Trains an agent to make decisions in an environment to maximize a reward. Example: Optimizing firewall rules to minimize intrusion risks .</li></ul></li><li><strong>Key Point 3: AI-Powered Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS)</strong><ul><li>  AI-powered IDS use machine learning algorithms to monitor network traffic, system logs, and user behavior for signs of malicious activity. These systems can detect anomalies and potential threats in real-time, providing early warnings and enabling rapid response .</li></ul></li></ul><h3>\n  \n  \n  2. How AI Predicts Cyber Attacks 🎯\n</h3><p>AI's ability to predict cyber attacks lies in its capability to analyze vast amounts of data and identify patterns that humans might miss.

Let's break down these interconnected concepts to give you a clearer picture of their potential for your business.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Artificial Intelligence: The Big Picture\n</h2><p>AI is the expansive field dedicated to building machines or systems that can perform tasks normally requiring human intelligence. Imagine it as <strong>teaching computers to \"think\" in ways we do,</strong> including: Reasoning, improving from experience, problem-solving capabilities, and comprehending and responding to human language.</p><p>AI is the umbrella term that covers many different subfields, each with its unique approach and applications. Some of the most prominent include <strong>Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing (NLP), Robotics, and Computer Vision.</strong></p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Machine Learning (ML): Learning from Data\n</h2><p>Machine Learning is a crucial subset of AI. Instead of explicitly programming a computer for every single scenario, <strong>ML focuses on developing algorithms that allow machines to learn from data and make decisions or predictions based on that learning.</strong></p><p>Imagine teaching a computer to spot spam emails. Instead of giving it a massive list of rules, you feed it millions of emails (some spam, some not). The ML algorithm then learns to identify patterns in spam, improving its accuracy with every new email it processes.</p><p><strong>ML thrives on data, becoming smarter and more accurate the more data it's exposed to.</strong></p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Deep Learning: Unlocking Complex Patterns\n</h2><p>Deep Learning is an even more specialized subset of Machine Learning. It uses artificial neural networks with multiple layers, <strong>inspired by the structure of the human brain, to model highly complex patterns within vast datasets.</strong></p><p>Think of these \"deep\" neural networks as having many hidden layers, allowing them to automatically discover intricate representations and features in data. This capability makes them incredibly powerful for tasks where traditional ML might struggle with raw, unstructured data.</p><p><strong>Deep Learning is behind many of the most impressive AI advancements we've seen in recent years.</strong></p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Generative AI: Creating New Worlds\n</h2><p>The latest frontier that's captured everyone's attention is Generative AI. This refers to <strong>AI systems that can generate entirely new content that's original</strong> yet resembles the data they were trained on. This isn't just about analyzing existing data; it's about creation.</p><p><strong>Generative AI is empowering creators, accelerating development, and opening up entirely new possibilities for content creation and interaction.</strong></p><h3>\n  \n  \n  What This Means for Your Business\n</h3><p>Understanding these distinctions isn't just academic; </p><p> Identifying which subset of AI aligns with your core problem can help you focus your development efforts and leverage the right tools for competitive advantage. </p><p> Knowing these differences allows you to better evaluate vendors, understand internal project capabilities, and strategically invest in AI initiatives that will truly drive efficiency, innovation, and new revenue streams.</p><p><strong>The world of AI is rapidly evolving, and staying informed is key to harnessing its immense power.</strong></p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Partner with Synergy Shock: Your AI Innovation Ally\n</h2><p>Feeling ready to explore how these cutting-edge AI technologies can transform your business?

Coding assistants now generate snippets, modules, and even entire apps — accelerating workflows, eliminating repetitive tasks, and empowering teams to build and ship faster than ever. This intuitive, rapid fire style of development often dubbed  “vibe coding'' feels fluid, fun, and fast. You prompt. AI completes. And you’re shipping ideas before lunch. However, whether you're using AI assistance from GitHub, Copilot, ChatGPT or even AI native editors like Cursor, there’s a flip side.</p><p>Across every domain — from images and videos to content and code — we’re seeing the dark side of unchecked generation: AI Slop. In software, that means sloppy outputs that create long term problems like technical debt, opacity, and fragility. With AI code, it’s easy to reach a point where “no one really knows how the code works.” This turns upgrades into minefields, maintenance into firefighting, and collaboration into confusion. Worse, AI often introduces critical vulnerabilities such as hardcoded secrets, insecure dependency use, broken authentication etc. all while bypassing the very practices meant to keep software safe. AI won’t warn you about problems you didn’t already anticipate. In fact, it may amplify them. </p><h3>\n  \n  \n  But What If AI Could Code Within Guardrails?\n</h3><p>AI’s potential is too valuable to ignore. Yet whether you're using GitHub Copilot, ChatGPT, or Cursor the lack of structural safeguards is a real problem because today’s languages weren’t built for decentralized systems or dynamic, contextual access. This forces developers to rely on bolt-on policies, patchwork permissions, and retrofitted audit trails. Instead of trusting AI to write secure code and catching issues after the fact, what if security, access control, and auditability were built directly into the language — with a compiler that enforces policies by default? That’s how we turn “vibe coding” from a risky shortcut into a scalable, secure, and reliable way to build.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  The Case for Compiler Level Trust\n</h3><p>Most modern tools patch problems after code is written. But this is reactive, slow, and error prone, especially at the scale and speed AI enables. Now imagine a language where:</p><ul><li>Security is Inherent: Common vulnerabilities (e.g. injections, broken access controls, insecure serialization) are structurally prevented — not patched.</li><li>Access Control is Built In: Data structures and functions carry access metadata that’s validated by the compiler, not left to runtime configuration.</li><li>Non Functional Requirements Are First Class: Performance, scalability, and trust policies can be expressed declaratively and enforced automatically.</li></ul><p>This is a new paradigm that unlocks AI’s full potential without sacrificing quality or safety. And that is exactly what trust native languages like Noumena Protocol Language (NPL) bring in this era of AI, decentralization and distributed systems. Built on the concepts of Parties , Protocols  and Contextual Authorization built directly into the syntax NPL helps developers build faster than ever without compromising control. It offers Compiler enforced security policies that reduce attack surface while also enabling Business as Code with domain specific languages (DSL) for modeling real world workflows.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Stop Patching.

You can find the <a href=\"https://github.com/arepetti/Tinkwell\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">source code on GitHub</a> (warning: it's not production code, I'm still experimenting!).</p><p>The goal is to build an easy-to-use framework that includes all the  for a robust system, one that can be extended and adapted to the scenarios introduced in the first post.

For example, you might:</p><ul><li>Replace the default implementation of the Events Gateway with one that uses MQTT or even RabbitMQ.</li><li>Extend the Events Gateway to forward events to Kafka.</li><li>Swap out the Store for a time-series database like TimescaleDB, InfluxDB, or Cassandra.</li><li>Use the default implementations when running locally and swap to the others when deployed, all from a single configuration file.</li></ul><p>Leaving aside the lower-level services (Supervisor, Orchestrator, and Discovery), the core components are:</p><ul><li>: Tracks all measured values in the system and allows other firmlets to subscribe to changes.</li><li>: Accepts published events and broadcasts them to all subscribed clients.</li><li>: Calculates derived measures, updates them when dependencies change, and publishes the new values to the Store.</li><li>: Evaluates a set of rules and emits signals (essentially events) when conditions are met, based on current Store values. Think of it as a rule engine for triggering alarms (or other system states).</li><li>: Listens for events and performs configured actions when a specific event is received and some conditions are met.</li></ul><p>Let's write a tiny program to feed our favorite AI model with data from the Store and ask if everything is running OK:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>I tried with some fictional data, the simplified prompt, stripped of all the irrelevant measures, look like this:</p><div><pre><code>context: turbine to generate electricity\n\nMeasure \"case_vibration_level\" is \"Intensity of vibrations measured on the outer casing (or housing) of the machine.\"\nValue: 5 mm/s\nHistorical average: 3 mm/s\n\nMeasure \"case_vibration_frequency\" is \"Dominant frequency at which the outer casing of the machine vibrates during operation.\"\nValue: 23 Hz\nHistorical average: 50 Hz\n\nMeasure \"turbine_rotation_speed\" is \"Rate at which a turbine shaft spins\"\nValue: 3000 rpm\nHistorical average: 3000 rpm\n\nKnowing only this, answer only YES (there might be a problem), NO (everything is OK). If yes add a possible explanation of the problem\n</code></pre></div><p>The response has been (in my case using Copilot):</p><div><pre><code>Yes — that could very well be a red flag.\nLet’s break it down:\n- Turbine speed of 3000 rpm corresponds to 50 Hz\n(since 3000 ÷ 60 = 50). That’s your 1× running speed.\n- A vibration at 23 Hz is not synchronous with the\nshaft — it’s a subharmonic or possibly a structural resonance.\n- 5 mm/s RMS is quite elevated. According to ISO 10816-3,\nfor large rigidly mounted machines, anything above 4.5 mm/s RMS\nis considered the “damage likely” zone.\nSo yes — this could be a problem. A few possibilities:\n- Structural resonance: 23 Hz might match a natural\nfrequency of the casing or support structure. If excited by\nharmonics or external forces, it can amplify vibration.\n- Looseness or soft foot: These can introduce subharmonic\nfrequencies and erratic vibration patterns.\n- Oil whirl or instability: If the machine uses fluid film\nbearings, sub-synchronous frequencies like 23 Hz could indicate\noil-related instabilities.\n- Blade pass or gear mesh sidebands: If there’s a gearbox or\nbladed component upstream, 23 Hz might be a sideband or\nmodulation frequency.\n\nGiven the increase over historical levels, this isn’t just a\nbenign quirk — it’s a change in the machine’s dynamic behavior.\nThat’s often the first whisper of a mechanical issue before it\nbecomes a shout.\n</code></pre></div><p>, I actually fed it a relatively large set of measures for a machine earl-ish displaying a oil whirl problem.</p><p>If fed with a vibration level of 2 mm/s (well acceptable) and without historical data, we still get this response:</p><div><pre><code>The presence of a non-synchronous vibration frequency like 23 Hz\nis a whisper worth listening to. It might be:\n- A natural mode being lightly excited.\n- A low-level fluid dynamic effect.\n- Or just a harmless artifact — depending on the machine’s\ndesign and bearing type.\n\nRecommendation: keep monitoring. If the 23 Hz component\ngrows or shifts, or if the RMS creeps toward 2.8–4.5 mm/s,\nthat’s your cue to investigate further.

Root cause analysis revealed a subtle drift in the distribution of transaction features, which the existing statistical thresholding system failed to capture. The incident highlighted the need for a more robust, data-driven anomaly detection approach. Autoencoders, specifically, offered a solution capable of learning complex, non-linear feature representations and adapting to evolving data patterns. This blog post details the architectural considerations, operational challenges, and best practices for deploying and maintaining autoencoders in production-grade machine learning systems. We’ll focus on the entire lifecycle, from data ingestion and model training to monitoring, rollback, and eventual deprecation, within the context of modern MLOps practices and stringent compliance requirements.</p><p><strong>2. What is \"autoencoder with python\" in Modern ML Infrastructure?</strong></p><p>From a systems perspective, an autoencoder isn’t merely a model; it’s a component within a larger data pipeline and inference service.  It’s a neural network trained to reconstruct its input, forcing it to learn a compressed, latent representation. In production, this latent representation is used for anomaly detection, dimensionality reduction, or feature extraction.  </p><p>Integration typically involves:</p><ul><li>  Data flows from sources (Kafka, databases, cloud storage) into a feature store (Feast, Tecton).</li><li> Orchestrated by Airflow or Kubeflow Pipelines, utilizing Ray for distributed training on GPU clusters. Model artifacts (weights, architecture) are logged to MLflow, including metadata like training data version, hyperparameters, and evaluation metrics.</li><li> Deployed as a REST API using frameworks like TensorFlow Serving, TorchServe, or Triton Inference Server, often containerized with Docker and managed by Kubernetes.</li><li> Integrated with Prometheus for metric collection (latency, throughput, reconstruction error) and Grafana for visualization. OpenTelemetry provides tracing for debugging.</li><li>  Reconstruction error, along with ground truth labels (when available), is fed back into the training pipeline for continuous learning.</li></ul><p>System boundaries are crucial.  The autoencoder’s performance is heavily reliant on the quality and consistency of features from the feature store.  A common implementation pattern is to treat the autoencoder as a microservice, allowing independent scaling and updates. Trade-offs involve model complexity (impact on latency) versus reconstruction accuracy (impact on anomaly detection sensitivity).</p><p><strong>3. Use Cases in Real-World ML Systems</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Fraud Detection (Fintech):</strong> Identifying anomalous transactions based on reconstruction error.

Regular audits of data pipelines, model performance, and security configurations are crucial for maintaining a reliable and compliant system.  Future work should focus on exploring federated learning techniques to improve model generalization and address data privacy concerns.

These agents can search the web, write and execute code, read documents, call APIs, and perform many other tasks to get things done, often without needing step-by-step instructions.\nSince May 20th 2025, the framework is officially stable in Python so I was immediately interested in diving in to understand all the possibilities it offers.</p><p>In this post, I’ll walk you through all the core concepts, what it is, and what it offers.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  🔍 What is Google Agent Development Kit?\n</h2><p>﻿ is a <strong>framework to build, run, and evaluate AI agents</strong>.

It’s built around a few .</p><p>ADK is built around several key building blocks that enable its powerful capabilities:</p><ul><li> The fundamental unit designed to perform specific jobs. This includes LlmAgent (driven by LLMs) and various WorkflowAgent types (SequentialAgent, ParallelAgent, LoopAgent), and Custom Agents for maximum flexibility.</li><li> Functions or capabilities that extend an agent's abilities, allowing it to interact with external systems (e.g., searching, calculating, API calls, MCP).</li><li> Custom code snippets that allow you to insert logic at specific points in an agent's process, useful for logging, monitoring, or modifying behavior.</li><li> Records of everything happening within a session (user messages, agent replies, tool calls), providing a clear historical trace for debugging and evaluation.</li><li><strong>💾 State, Session, and Memory:</strong> A Session represents an ongoing interaction, managing its short-term State (current context), while Memory provides longer-term recall across sessions.</li><li> A mechanism for agents to manage and store files and data blobs (like generated CSVs or images) associated with a session.</li><li> A powerful capability allowing agents to dynamically write and run code during their process to solve complex problems or automate tasks.</li><li> An advanced feature where agents can break down complex goals into a sequence of steps, determining the optimal approach using their tools and reasoning.</li><li> The Large Language Models (LLMs) that LlmAgents rely on for reasoning. ADK is model-agnostic, supporting various providers while being optimized for Gemini and the Google ecosystem.</li><li> The orchestrator within ADK that manages the flow of events between the user, the agent, and its tools, ensuring everything executes in the correct order.</li></ul><h2>\n  \n  \n  🚀 Let’s implement our first multi-agent system\n</h2><p>For this hands-on part, our goal is to build a smart system that can organize a weekend trip to a city, planning an optimized itinerary to visit the most popular places efficiently.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  1️⃣ Step 1: Defining our specialized agents\n</h3><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>The  is an  equipped with the Google Search tool, giving it the ability to browse the web for information.</p><p>Before we can plan a path, we need precise coordinates for our places of interest.\nThat's where the  comes in.\nIt takes a human-readable address or place name and converts it into a geocode (latitude and longitude) leveraging the MCPToolset for Google Maps to perform its core function.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>The  is an  equipped with the  for Google Maps, giving it the power to calculate routes.\nThis agent's job is to figure out the best route.

For this project, I will use npm.</p></blockquote><div><pre><code>npx create-next-app@latest voice-chat-ai-configurable-agent </code></pre></div><p>Next, navigate into the newly created Next.js project:</p><div><pre><code>voice-chat-ai-configurable-agent\n</code></pre></div><p>We need some dependencies. Run the following command to install them all:</p><div><pre><code>npm i composio-core zustand @langchain/core @langchain/openai \nframer-motion openai react-speech-recognition use-debounce\n</code></pre></div><p>Here's what they are used for:</p><blockquote><p>ℹ️ We'll use Composio to add integrations to our application. You can choose any integration you like, but make sure to authenticate first.</p></blockquote><p>First, before moving forward, you need to get access to a Composio API key.</p><p>Go ahead and create an account on Composio, get your API key, and paste it in the  file in the root of the project.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Now, you need to install the  CLI application, which you can do using the following command:</p><p>Log in to Composio using the following command:</p><p>Once that’s done, run the  command, and if you see something like the example below, you’re successfully logged in.</p><p>Now, it's all up to you which integrations you'd like to support.

Initialize it with the default settings by running:</p><p>We will need a few UI components, but we won't focus heavily on the UI side for the project. We'll keep it simple and concentrate mainly on the logic.</p><div><pre><code>npx shadcn@latest add button dialog input label separator\n</code></pre></div><p>This should add five different files in the  directory called , , , , and .</p><blockquote><p>🙋‍♂️ In this section, we'll cover all the coding needed to create the chat interface, work with Speech Recognition, and connect it with Composio tools.</p></blockquote><p>Before coding the project logic, let's start by writing some helper functions and constants that we will use throughout the project.</p><p>Let's begin by setting up some constants. Create a new file called  in the root of the project and add the following lines of code:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>These are just some constants that we will use throughout, and you might be wondering what these alias names are that we are passing in these constants.</p><p>Basically, these are alias key names used to hold key-value pairs. For example, when working with Discord, you might have an alias like 'Gaming Channel ID' that holds the ID of your gaming channel.</p><p>We use these aliases because it's not practical to say IDs, emails, and those things with voice. So, you can set up these aliases to refer to them easily.</p><blockquote><p>🗣️ Say \"Can you summarize the recent chats in my gaming channel?\" and it will use the relevant alias to pass to the LLM, which in turn calls the Composio API with the relevant fields.</p></blockquote><p>If you're confused right now, no worries. Follow along, and you'll soon figure out what this is all about.</p><p>Now, let's work on setting up the store that will hold all the aliases that we will store in . Create a new file called  in the  directory and add the following lines of code:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>If you've used Zustand before, this setup should feel familiar. If not, here's a quick breakdown: we have an  type that holds a key-value pair and an  interface that represents the full alias state along with functions to add, edit, or remove an alias.</p><p>Each alias is grouped under an integration name (like \"slack\" or \"discord\"), making it easy to manage them per service. These are stored in an  object using the  type, which maps integration names to arrays of aliases.</p><p>We use the  middleware to persist the aliases so they don't get lost when reloading the page, and this will come in really handy.</p><p>The use of  ensures the state is serialized and stored in  under the key \"voice-agent-aliases-storage\".</p><blockquote><p>ℹ️ For this tutorial, I've kept it simple and stored it in , and this should be fine, but if you're interested, you could even setup and store it in a database.</p></blockquote><p>Now, let's add another helper function that will return the correct error message and status code based on the error our application throws.</p><p>Create a new file called  in the  directory and add the following lines of code:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>We define our own Error class called  that extends the built-in  class. We will not use this in our program just yet, as we don't need to throw an error in any API endpoint.</p><p>But you can use it if you ever extend the functionality of the application and need to throw an error.</p><p> is pretty simple; it takes in the error and returns a message and the statusCode based on the error type.</p><p>Finally, let's end by setting up the helper functions and writing a zod validator for validating user input.</p><p>Create a new file called  in the  directory and add the following lines of code:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>This Zod schema validates an object with a  string and an  record, where each key maps to an array of  string pairs.</p><p>This is going to look something like this:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>The idea is that for each message sent, we will send the message along with all the set-up aliases. We will then use an LLM to determine which aliases are needed to handle the user's query.</p><p>Now that we're done with the helper functions, let's move on to the main application logic. 🎉</p><p>We will create a few hooks that we will use to work with audio, speech recognition, and all.</p><p>Create a new directory called  in the root of the project and create a new file called <code>use-speech-recognition.ts</code> and add the following lines of code:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>We’re using  to handle voice input and adding a debounce on top so we don’t trigger actions on every tiny change.</p><p>Basically, whenever the transcript stops changing for a bit (), and it's different from the last one we processed, we stop listening, call , and reset the transcript.</p><p> clears old data and starts speech recognition in continuous mode. And ... well, stops it. 🥴</p><p>That’s it. It's a simple hook to manage speech input with debounce to make sure it does not submit as soon as we stop and adds a bit of a delay.</p><p>Now that we covered handling speech input, let's move on to audio. Create a new file called  and add the following lines of code:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Its job is simple: to play or stop audio using the Web Audio API. We’ll use it to handle audio playback for the speech generated by OpenAI’s TTS.</p><p>The  function takes in user input (text), sends it to an API endpoint (), gets the audio response, decodes it, and plays it in the browser. It uses  under the hood and manages state, like whether the audio is currently playing, through . We also expose a  function to stop playback early if needed.</p><p>We have not yet implemented the  route, but we will do it shortly.</p><p>Now, let's implement another hook for working with chats. Basically, we will use it to work with all the messages.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>This one’s pretty straightforward. We use  to manage a simple chat flow — it keeps track of all messages and whether we’re currently waiting for a response.</p><p>When sendMessage is called, it adds the user’s input to the chat, hits our  route with the message and any aliases, and then updates the messages with whatever the assistant replies. If it fails, we just drop in a fallback error message instead. That’s it.</p><p>We're pretty much done with the hooks. Now that we have modularized all of these into hooks, why not create another small helper hook for component mount check?</p><p>Create a new file called  and add the following lines of code:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Just a tiny hook to check if the component has mounted on the client. Returns  after the first render, handy for skipping SSR-specific stuff.</p><p>Finally, after working on four hooks, we are done with the hooks setup. Let's move on to building the API.</p><p>Great, now it makes sense to work on the API part and then move on to the UI.</p><p>Head to the  directory and create two different routes:</p><div><pre><code> app/api/tts app/api/chat\n</code></pre></div><p>Great, now let's implement the  route. Create a new file called  in the  directory and add the following lines of code:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>This is our  route that takes in some text and generates an MP3 audio using OpenAI’s TTS API. We grab the text from the request body, call OpenAI with the model and voice we've set in , and get back a streamable MP3 blob.</p><p>The important thing is that OpenAI returns an , so we first convert it to a Node  before sending the response back to the client.</p><p>Great, so now comes the main logic of our application, which is to actually identify if the user is requesting a tool call and, if so, find any relevant alias, and if not, generate a generic response.</p><p>Create a new file called  in the  directory and add the following lines of code:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>First, we parse the request body and validate it using Zod (). If it passes, we check whether the message needs tool usage with . If not, it’s just a regular chat, and we pass the message to the LLM () and return the response.</p><p>If tool use  needed, we pull out the available apps from the user’s saved , and then try to figure out which apps are actually being referred to in the message using .</p><p>Once we know which apps are in play, we filter the aliases for only those apps and send them through . This uses the LLM again to guess which ones are relevant based on the message. If we find any, we add them to the message as a context block (<code>--- Relevant Parameters ---</code>) so the LLM knows what it’s working with.From here, the heavy lifting is done by <code>executeToolCallingLogic()</code>. This is where the magic happens. We:</p><ul><li>fetch tools from Composio for the selected apps,</li><li>start a little conversation history,</li><li>call the LLM and check if it wants to use any tools (via ),</li><li>and push results back into the convo.</li></ul><p>We keep doing this in a loop (max  times), and finally ask the LLM for a clean summary of what just happened.</p><p>That’s basically it. Long story short, it's like:</p><blockquote><p>💡 “Do we need tools? No? Chat. Yes? Find apps → match aliases → call tools → summarize.”</p></blockquote><p>That's basically it. This is the heart of our application. If you've understood this, now all that's left is working with the UI.</p><p>If you're following along, try building it yourself. If not, let's keep going!</p><p>Let's start with the model where the user will assign aliases as we've discussed. We'll use the  to access the aliases and all the functions to add, edit, and remove aliases.</p><p>It's going to be pretty straightforward to understand, as we've already worked on the logic; this is just attaching all the logic we've done together to the UI.</p><p>Create a new file called  in the  directory and add the following lines of code:</p><div><pre><code>\n          Add Params\n        Integration Parameters\n            Manage your integration parameters and aliases. Add new parameters\n            or remove existing ones.\n          \n                Current Parameters\n              \n                                Alias Name\n                              \n                                Value\n                              \n              Add New Parameter\n            Integration TypeAlias NameValue\n                Add Parameter\n              Close</code></pre></div><p>Great, now that the modal is done, let's implement the component that will be responsible for displaying all the messages in the UI.</p><p>Create a new file called  in the  directory and add the following lines of code:</p><div><pre><code>\n              How can I help you today?\n            \n              Use the microphone to speak or type your command below.

In such cases, the user can only interact with the bot through chat.</p><p>Since we're writing very reusable code, let's write the header in a separate component as well, because why not?</p><p>Create a new file called  in the  directory and add the following lines of code:</p><div><pre><code>Voice AI Agent</code></pre></div><p>This component is very simple; it's just a header with a title and a settings button.</p><p>Cool, so now let's put all of these UI components together in a separate component, which we'll display in the , and that concludes the project.</p><p>Create a new file called  in the  directory and add the following lines of code:</p><div><pre><code>\n                  Sorry, your browser does not support speech recognition.\n                </code></pre></div><p>And again, this is pretty straightforward. The first thing we need to do is check if the component is mounted or not because all of this is supposed to run on the client, as you know these are browser-specific APIs. Then we extract all the fields from <code>useSpeechRecognitionWithDebounce</code>, and based on whether the browser supports recognition, we show conditional UI.</p><p>Once the transcription is done, we send the message text to the  function, which in turn calls the  function, which, as you remember, sends the message to our  API endpoint.</p><p>Finally, update the page.tsx in the root directory to display the  component.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>And with this, our entire application is done! 🎉</p><blockquote><p>By the way, I have built another similar MCP-powered chat application that can connect with remotely hosted MCP servers and even locally hosted MCP servers (no matter what)!

Root cause analysis revealed the new model, while improving overall accuracy, exhibited a significant shift in its latent space representation of legitimate transactions. This wasn’t a model bug , but a failure to adequately monitor and validate the  of the learned representations. This incident highlighted the necessity of robust autoencoder-based anomaly detection tutorials – not as isolated training exercises, but as integral components of a comprehensive MLOps pipeline.  An “autoencoder tutorial” in this context isn’t about learning the algorithm; it’s about building a system for continuous validation of model behavior, feature drift, and data integrity throughout the entire ML lifecycle, from initial data ingestion to eventual model deprecation.  This is crucial for maintaining compliance with regulatory requirements (e.g., GDPR, CCPA) regarding explainability and fairness, and for meeting the stringent latency demands of real-time fraud detection.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  2. What is \"autoencoder tutorial\" in Modern ML Infrastructure?\n</h3><p>From a systems perspective, an “autoencoder tutorial” represents a continuous monitoring and validation pipeline centered around the latent space learned by an autoencoder. It’s not merely a training script; it’s a service that ingests production data, encodes it using a pre-trained autoencoder, and then analyzes the reconstruction error and latent space distribution. This service interacts heavily with existing MLOps infrastructure.  Data is typically sourced from a feature store (e.g., Feast, Tecton) and fed into the autoencoder via a serving layer (e.g., TensorFlow Serving, TorchServe, Seldon Core).  Model versions are managed by MLflow, and training pipelines are orchestrated by Airflow or Kubeflow Pipelines.  Real-time inference often leverages Ray Serve for scalability.  The output of the autoencoder tutorial – reconstruction error, latent space statistics – is then streamed to a monitoring system (Prometheus, Datadog) for alerting and visualization.  System boundaries are critical: the autoencoder tutorial  retrain the primary model; it validates its behavior. Implementation patterns typically involve a shadow deployment of the autoencoder alongside the production model, allowing for comparison of latent space representations without impacting live traffic.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  3. Use Cases in Real-World ML Systems\n</h3><ul><li><strong>Fraud Detection (Fintech):</strong>  As illustrated in the introduction, autoencoders identify anomalous transactions by measuring reconstruction error.  A significant deviation from expected reconstruction error signals potential fraud.</li><li><strong>Network Intrusion Detection (Cybersecurity):</strong> Autoencoders learn the normal patterns of network traffic.  Unusual traffic patterns, resulting in high reconstruction error, indicate potential intrusions.</li><li><strong>Predictive Maintenance (Manufacturing):</strong>  Autoencoders model the normal operating conditions of machinery.  Deviations in the latent space can predict impending failures.</li><li><strong>Anomaly Detection in Time Series Data (E-commerce):</strong> Identifying unusual spikes or dips in sales, website traffic, or inventory levels.</li><li><strong>Data Quality Monitoring (All Verticals):</strong> Detecting data drift or corruption by monitoring the reconstruction error on incoming data.  This is particularly valuable in scenarios with evolving data schemas.</li></ul><h3>\n  \n  \n  4. Architecture &amp; Data Workflows\n</h3><div><pre><code>graph LR\n    A[Feature Store] --&gt; B(Data Ingestion Service);\n    B --&gt; C{Autoencoder Service (Shadow Deployment)};\n    C --&gt; D[Reconstruction Error Calculation];\n    C --&gt; E[Latent Space Statistics];\n    D --&gt; F[Monitoring System (Prometheus/Datadog)];\n    E --&gt; F;\n    F --&gt; G{Alerting System};\n    G --&gt; H[On-Call Engineer];\n    I[CI/CD Pipeline] --&gt; C;\n    J[Model Registry (MLflow)] --&gt; I;\n    subgraph Training Pipeline\n        J --&gt; K[Autoencoder Training];\n        K --&gt; C;\n    end\n</code></pre></div><p>The workflow begins with data ingestion from the feature store. The autoencoder service, deployed in shadow mode, encodes the data. Reconstruction error and latent space statistics are calculated and streamed to the monitoring system. Alerts are triggered based on predefined thresholds.  CI/CD pipelines automatically deploy updated autoencoders whenever the primary model is updated, ensuring alignment. Traffic shaping isn’t directly applicable to the autoencoder tutorial itself, but canary rollouts of the  model are heavily influenced by the autoencoder tutorial’s validation results. Rollback mechanisms involve reverting to the previous autoencoder version if anomalies are detected.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  5. Implementation Strategies\n</h3><p><strong>Python Orchestration (Wrapper):</strong></p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p><strong>Kubernetes Deployment (YAML):</strong></p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p><strong>Experiment Tracking (Bash):</strong></p><div><pre><code>mlflow experiments create \nmlflow runs create \nmlflow log_param  &lt;RUN_ID&gt; \nmlflow log_metric  &lt;RUN_ID&gt;  &lt;MSE_VALUE&gt;\n</code></pre></div><p>Reproducibility is ensured through version control of code, data, and model weights. Testability is achieved through unit tests for the validation logic and integration tests to verify end-to-end functionality.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  6. Failure Modes &amp; Risk Management\n</h3><ul><li> The autoencoder is not updated when the primary model changes, leading to inaccurate validation.  Automated deployment triggered by model registry updates.</li><li>  Changes in the distribution of input features cause the autoencoder to misinterpret data.  Continuous monitoring of feature distributions and retraining the autoencoder when significant drift is detected.</li><li>  High traffic or resource contention causes the autoencoder service to become slow.  Autoscaling, caching, and optimized model serving.</li><li><strong>Reconstruction Error Threshold Misconfiguration:</strong>  An incorrectly set threshold leads to false positives or missed anomalies.   A/B testing of different thresholds and dynamic threshold adjustment based on historical data.</li><li> Corrupted data ingested into the autoencoder leads to inaccurate validation.  Data validation checks before ingestion.</li></ul><h3>\n  \n  \n  7. Performance Tuning &amp; System Optimization\n</h3><p>Key metrics: P90/P95 latency of reconstruction error calculation, throughput (requests per second), model accuracy (reconstruction error), and infrastructure cost. Optimization techniques include: batching requests to the autoencoder, caching frequently accessed data, vectorization of calculations, autoscaling the service based on load, and profiling the code to identify bottlenecks.  Batching significantly improves throughput, while autoscaling ensures responsiveness under varying load.  Reducing model size (e.g., quantization) can lower latency and infrastructure costs.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  8. Monitoring, Observability &amp; Debugging\n</h3><p>Observability stack: Prometheus for metric collection, Grafana for visualization, OpenTelemetry for tracing, Evidently for data drift detection, and Datadog for comprehensive monitoring. Critical metrics: reconstruction error (mean, standard deviation, percentiles), latent space distance from baseline, service latency, error rates, and resource utilization. Alert conditions: reconstruction error exceeding a threshold, significant drift in latent space, and service latency exceeding a threshold. Log traces should include request IDs for debugging. Anomaly detection algorithms can be applied to reconstruction error to identify unexpected patterns.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  9. Security, Policy &amp; Compliance\n</h3><p>Audit logging of all data access and model predictions is essential. Reproducibility is ensured through version control and experiment tracking. Secure model and data access is enforced using IAM roles and Vault for secret management. ML metadata tracking tools (e.g., MLflow) provide traceability and lineage.  OPA (Open Policy Agent) can be used to enforce data governance policies.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  10. CI/CD &amp; Workflow Integration\n</h3><p>Integration with GitHub Actions:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Deployment gates ensure that the autoencoder is only deployed if all tests pass. Automated tests verify the functionality of the validation logic. Rollback logic automatically reverts to the previous autoencoder version if anomalies are detected. Argo Workflows or Kubeflow Pipelines can orchestrate the entire process.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  11. Common Engineering Pitfalls\n</h3><ul><li> Failing to monitor and address changes in input feature distributions.</li><li>  Lack of comprehensive monitoring of reconstruction error and latent space statistics.</li><li><strong>Overly Sensitive Thresholds:</strong> Setting reconstruction error thresholds too low, leading to false positives.</li><li><strong>Lack of Automated Deployment:</strong>  Manually deploying the autoencoder, leading to inconsistencies and delays.</li><li>  Failing to optimize the autoencoder service for low latency.</li></ul><p>Debugging workflows involve analyzing log traces, visualizing latent space distributions, and comparing reconstruction error distributions between different model versions.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  12. Best Practices at Scale\n</h3><p>Mature ML platforms like Uber Michelangelo and Spotify Cortex emphasize modularity, scalability, and automation. Scalability patterns include horizontal scaling of the autoencoder service and distributed data processing. Tenancy is achieved through resource isolation and access control. Operational cost tracking is essential for optimizing resource utilization.  A maturity model should be used to assess the effectiveness of the autoencoder tutorial and identify areas for improvement.  The ultimate goal is to connect the autoencoder tutorial to business impact by reducing fraud losses, improving product quality, or increasing operational efficiency.</p><p>An autoencoder tutorial, when implemented as a robust and integrated MLOps component, is critical for maintaining the reliability and trustworthiness of large-scale ML systems.  Next steps include benchmarking the autoencoder service against different hardware configurations, integrating it with a more sophisticated data drift detection system, and conducting regular security audits.  Continuous improvement and adaptation are essential for ensuring that the autoencoder tutorial remains effective in the face of evolving data and model landscapes.</p>","contentLength":10144,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"JL 2.4G Bluetooth Low-Latency Audio Headset Solution: Chip Selection, Latency, Hardware Design","url":"https://dev.to/ble_voice/jl-24g-bluetooth-low-latency-audio-headset-solution-chip-selection-latency-hardware-design-4e38","date":1751300251,"author":"Junluan Tsui","guid":176789,"unread":true,"content":"<p>This document introduces JL's low-latency audio headset solution using 2.4G/Bluetooth technology.</p><ul><li>:\n\n<ul><li>Capable of 48KHz/16bit stereo output</li><li>Supports UAC (USB Audio Class) - plug-and-play, no driver required</li></ul></li><li>:\n\n<ul><li>Stereo headphones: JL7083F</li></ul></li></ul><h2>\n  \n  \n  2.

Over the past two months, OpenAI has rolled out native in‑chat shopping features—powered by partnerships with Shopify, Visa, and major retailers—allowing users not only to explore and compare products, but to complete purchases without leaving the chat interface. This article examines what ChatGPT can buy for you, how it works under the hood, its advantages over traditional e‑commerce, and what both consumers and merchants need to know to make the most of this emerging “conversational commerce” paradigm.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  What new shopping capabilities does ChatGPT offer?\n</h2><h3>\n  \n  \n  Conversational product discovery\n</h3><p>Rather than typing keywords into a search engine, users can now ask ChatGPT natural‑language questions like “Show me the best wireless earbuds under $100 with noise cancellation” and receive a curated list of products—complete with images, specifications, pricing, and reviews—in seconds. This “shopping mode” launched in late April 2025 and sources real‑time data directly from merchant catalogs and data partners, eliminating out‑of‑date listings and reducing decision fatigue .</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  In‑chat checkout and payment integration\n</h3><p>Beyond recommendations, ChatGPT now supports an end‑to‑end purchase flow. Thanks to a native integration discovered in ChatGPT’s JavaScript bundle (with Shopify variable names identified as early as April 20, 2025), users can add items to a virtual cart and complete checkout—all within the chat window . Visa has also announced plans to embed its payment network directly into AI platforms, enabling payment details to be securely tokenized and reused across future chats .</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Product Carousels and Recommendations\n</h3><p>Rather than showing plain text links, ChatGPT presents visually rich product carousels that draw from both editorial sources (e.g., WIRED buying guides) and real‑time web data (e.g., retailer inventories and customer reviews). The model aggregates user-specified preferences—such as price range or style—and previous conversation context (e.g., “I hate cigarette‑smoke scents”) to tailor recommendations . According to OpenAI’s Adam Fry, ChatGPT already handles over a billion web searches per week, many of which relate to shopping; the new feature simply formalizes and enriches that use case.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  How does ChatGPT integrate with e‑commerce platforms?\n</h2><h3>\n  \n  \n  Redirection to Merchant Sites\n</h3><p>Despite integrating “Buy” buttons, ChatGPT does not process payments directly. Instead, clicking a shopping button redirects users to the merchant’s website, where the transaction is completed using the retailer’s native checkout system . This design both leverages existing, secure payment infrastructures and sidesteps the need for OpenAI to handle sensitive financial data directly.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Shopify partnership and native flows\n</h3><p>OpenAI’s strategic collaboration with Shopify is at the heart of the in‑chat shopping experience. Merchant consent, real‑time inventory, pricing updates, promotions, order sync, and fulfillment tracking are all handled through Shopify’s APIs and webhooks. This tight coupling ensures product availability and pricing in ChatGPT mirror the merchant’s live store, solving the “out‑of‑stock” and “stale price” issues common to third‑party marketplaces.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Third‑party retailer links and affiliate models\n</h3><p>In addition to Shopify, ChatGPT aggregates offerings from major retailers—Amazon, Best Buy, Walmart—via deep‑web product feeds and affiliate integration. Early experiments surface “Buy Now” buttons that redirect to the retailer’s checkout page, with OpenAI exploring affiliate‑revenue sharing models to monetize these referrals. While OpenAI currently does not place paid ads in shopping results, industry observers expect a shift toward hybrid monetization (affiliate fees, sponsored placements) once core user experience is proven .</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  What distinguishes ChatGPT shopping from traditional e‑commerce?\n</h2><h3>\n  \n  \n  Personalized, ad‑free recommendations\n</h3><p>Unlike keyword‑based search engines, ChatGPT shopping emphasizes personalization through context‑aware dialog. If a user refines a query (“What if I want something eco‑friendly?”), the model instantly adjusts suggestions. Importantly, OpenAI has positioned this feature as “recommendation‑first,” with no ad placements to date—prioritizing user trust and perceived neutrality.</p><p>Real‑time syncing with merchant systems via Shopify and vetted data aggregators ensures that product specifications, stock levels, pricing, and shipping estimates remain accurate. This trustworthiness is critical: 78% of online shoppers cite “out‑of‑stock” errors and stale pricing as the biggest pain points in e‑commerce, and AI models trained solely on web‑scraped data have historically struggled to keep up .</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  How secure and private is shopping via ChatGPT?\n</h2><h3>\n  \n  \n  Data handling and payment info security\n</h3><p>To process payments, ChatGPT leverages end‑to‑end encryption and tokenization protocols. Visa’s integration allows users to vault their payment credentials once, then authorize transactions with a simple chat command or biometric confirmation on their device. All personally identifiable information (PII) and payment data are stored on PCI‑compliant servers under merchant control, not within OpenAI’s systems, mitigating breach risks .</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Trust barriers and countermeasures\n</h3><p>Despite robust security measures, consumer trust remains a key hurdle. A recent Axios survey found that 52% of AI shopping users worry about unintended charges or data misuse. To address this, OpenAI has introduced transparency controls—users can view all pending charges before approval, revoke vendor payment access at any time, and review detailed order histories within the chat interface. These safeguards aim to build confidence in a nascent transactional channel .</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  What are the technical underpinnings enabling ChatGPT to shop?\n</h2><h3>\n  \n  \n  Plugins and API Integrations\n</h3><p>ChatGPT’s shopping feature builds on the existing plugins framework, which allows third‑party services to extend the model’s capabilities. Retailers and affiliate networks can develop plugins or APIs that provide up‑to‑date product catalogs, pricing, and availability. When a shopping query is detected, ChatGPT invokes these plugins to fetch live data, assembles a ranked list of options, and formats the results into an interactive carousel.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  AI‑driven Personalization\n</h3><p>The core language model (e.g., GPT-4o or GPT‑4o‑mini) applies advanced personalization by recalling user preferences specified earlier in the conversation—like preferred brands, budget constraints, or stylistic tastes—and factoring in sentiment cues. For instance, if a user previously expressed a dislike for “clown costumes,” ChatGPT will omit such items from its list of Halloween recommendations for pet costumes . This dynamic context‑aware filtering represents a step beyond static “best of” lists, aligning suggestions closely with individual needs.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  How can businesses and users enable and optimize ChatGPT shopping?\n</h2><h3>\n  \n  \n  For merchants: integration and API setup\n</h3><p>Merchants on Shopify can opt into ChatGPT Shopping via their admin dashboard. Enabling the “Conversational Commerce” toggle publishes their product catalog to OpenAI’s data aggregator, along with API keys for order creation and fulfillment updates.

All You Need to Know","url":"https://dev.to/_37bbf0c253c0b3edec531e/can-claude-create-images-all-you-need-to-know-1lif","date":1751298998,"author":"安萨","guid":176763,"unread":true,"content":"<p>In recent months, a growing number of developers and enterprises have asked a common question: <strong>Can Anthropic’s Claude models generate new images directly?</strong> While Claude has made impressive strides in multimodal understanding—allowing users to upload and analyze images—the ability to  generate novel visuals remains a point of confusion.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  What is Claude and what can it currently do?\n</h2><p>Claude is a family of large language models (LLMs) developed by Anthropic, a leading AI research and development company founded by former OpenAI executives. Since its initial public release in March 2023, Claude has evolved through multiple major versions—Claude 1, Claude 2, Claude 3 (Haiku, Sonnet, Opus), and most recently Claude 4 (Opus 4 and Sonnet 4) released on May 22, 2025. Claude models are designed to be highly capable conversational agents, excelling at tasks such as drafting documents, writing and debugging code, answering complex questions, and performing advanced reasoning tasks .</p><p>Anthropic positions Claude as a “safe, helpful, and steerable” assistant that can connect to your documents, tools, and the web, enabling seamless integration into enterprise workflows. Key features include multi-hour “extended thinking,” which allows the model to pause and fetch additional data before continuing its response, and “Artifacts,” a no‑code tool that lets users turn prompts into shareable mini-applications, visualizations, and automations without the need for programming expertise.</p><p>While Claude’s text-based abilities have been the core focus, starting with Claude 3, the model gained the capacity to ingest and analyze images as inputs—enabling users to upload photos, diagrams, or screenshots and ask questions about them. Despite these multimodal input capabilities, Anthropic has not officially launched any native image generation feature akin to DALL·E or Stable Diffusion as of June 30, 2025 .</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Can Claude generate images right now?\n</h2><h3>\n  \n  \n  Current state of image generation support\n</h3><p>As of June 30, 2025, Claude’s publicly available offerings do  include a feature for generating images from scratch. Unlike some competing platforms—such as OpenAI’s DALL·E or Stability AI’s Stable Diffusion—Claude lacks a built‑in text‑to‑image engine that can render entirely new visuals based on user prompts .</p><p>Anthropic has prioritized safety, interpretability, and enterprise utility in Claude’s roadmap, focusing on text and code reasoning, tool integration (e.g., API calls, web searches), and generative workflows such as Artifacts. The omission of native image generation suggests a deliberate choice, likely motivated by Anthropic’s safety‑first ethos and concerns over misuse of synthesized imagery.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Third‑party tools and workarounds\n</h3><p>While Claude itself does not directly produce images, developers and enterprises can integrate Claude’s API with external image-generation services. For instance, in a prototype workflow, Claude could draft a textual description and then invoke another API—such as DALL·E or an open‑source diffusion model—to translate that description into visuals. This hybrid approach allows organizations to leverage Claude’s advanced reasoning and prompt‑crafting strengths while outsourcing the actual image synthesis to specialized models .</p><p>Such integrations highlight Claude’s extensibility but also underscore the fact that, out of the box, Claude remains focused on text-based and analytical tasks rather than full-fledged multimodal output generation.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Why hasn’t Anthropic enabled image generation in Claude?\n</h2><h3>\n  \n  \n  Safety and alignment considerations\n</h3><p>Anthropic’s charter emphasizes building AI that is safe, steerable, and aligned with human values. Generative vision models—while immensely popular—pose unique challenges around misuse, deepfakes, and style‑based appropriation. By withholding image‑generation capabilities, Anthropic reduces the risk of generating harmful or misleading imagery, aligning with its commitment to a “responsible scaling” approach .</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Technical and resource trade‑offs\n</h3><p>Developing high‑fidelity image generators requires vast computational resources and specialized training data. Anthropic may have opted to concentrate engineering efforts on advanced reasoning, coding, and multimodal  rather than diverting capacity to image synthesis. This focus has paid dividends: Claude Opus 4 was recently lauded as “the world’s best coding model,” underscoring Anthropic’s decision to prioritize text‑based and reasoning advances over image generation.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  How does Claude compare to other multimodal models?\n</h2><p>Several other major AI platforms offer integrated text-to-image capabilities alongside language understanding:</p><ul><li>: GPT-Image-1 is designed to generate and edit high-quality images from textual prompts, offering users the ability to create visuals in diverse styles and formats .</li><li><strong>Google’s Imagen and Gemini</strong>: Google’s Gemini Ultra merges text, code, and image generation in a unified model, promising higher-quality visuals but with Google’s extensive safety pipeline.</li><li><strong>Stability AI’s Stable Diffusion</strong>: An open-source powerhouse for image synthesis, widely adopted in creative and research communities.</li></ul><p>None of these offerings match Claude’s extended reasoning or prompt-driven tool integration, but they outpace Claude in pure image generation quality and flexibility.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Multimodal analysis vs. generation\n</h3><p>Claude excels at —understanding and reasoning about images provided by users—and , where it orchestrates web queries, code execution, and external APIs to fulfill complex, multi-step workflows. Its omission of native image generation doesn’t inhibit its ability to explain, critique, or improve visuals supplied by users.</p><p>By contrast, models like Stable Diffusion focus exclusively on producing images, lacking the deep reasoning and step-by-step problem‑solving that Claude demonstrates in text-based tasks. Organizations requiring mixed media workflows often combine Claude’s reasoning with external diffusion models to achieve the best of both worlds.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  What are the technical limitations and best practices?\n</h2><p>Even with a two‑step pipeline, developers must navigate constraints to achieve high‑quality results.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Latency and cost considerations\n</h3><p>Chaining two APIs—one for prompt generation and one for image synthesis—doubles processing time and can amplify token‑or‑compute costs. Budgeting for end‑to‑end latency is crucial, especially in real‑time applications.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Prompt fidelity and iteration\n</h3><ul><li>: Overly terse prompts can lead to vague visuals; developers should instruct Claude to include color palettes, composition cues, and emotional tone.</li><li>: Capture the initial image output, feed metadata and user feedback back into Claude for prompt tweaking, and re‑invoke the image model. This iterative loop often yields polished results.</li></ul><p>Implement content filters on both text and image channels. While Claude applies moderation to its text outputs, image engines may require separate safe‑generation settings to prevent offensive or harmful content.</p><p>CometAPI provides a unified REST interface that aggregates hundreds of AI models—including Claude AI family—under a consistent endpoint, with built-in API-key management, usage quotas, and billing dashboards.

We write code that looks like <code>payment.customers.create({email: \"user@example.com\"})</code>, memorize method names, wrestle with documentation, and inevitably break things when APIs evolve. Meanwhile, the AI world is moving toward protocols like MCP (Model Context Protocol) designed specifically for agents. Both humans and AI need programmatic access to the same resources, so what about us human developers caught in the middle?</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  The multi-layered API problem\n</h2><p>Here's some typical example code for creating a customer with company FooCorp's SDK:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Six months later, the API provider (hopefully unintentionally) updates their schema. The  field is deprecated in favor of separate  and  fields. Your code breaks. You shake your fist in anger, update the SDK, fix your code, test everything, and deploy.</p><p>But there's another layer to this problem. As <a href=\"https://glama.ai/blog/2025-06-06-mcp-vs-api\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Frank Fiegel points out</a>, traditional HTTP APIs suffer from \"combinatorial chaos\" - data scattered across URL paths, headers, query parameters, and request bodies. This makes them particularly hard for AI agents to use reliably.</p><p>The AI community's answer is MCP (Model Context Protocol), which provides AI-friendly interfaces that they can easily adopt. But that leaves human developers in an interesting position: we still need to work with thousands of existing APIs that don't have MCP servers.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  The SDK provider's burden\n</h2><p>The pain isn't just felt by developers—SDK providers face their own set of challenges that make the current system unsustainable.</p><p>When a new version is released, particularly a major version, providers essentially have to beg developers to upgrade. This creates a frustrating dynamic where providers want to innovate and improve their APIs, but are held back by the friction of SDK adoption.</p><p>Without implementing complex API versioning systems, any breaking change means potentially nuking integrations that use older versions of the SDK. This is especially painful for languages with strong type safety, where minor schema changes can cause compilation failures across entire codebases.</p><p>Consider the maintenance burden: a popular API provider might need to maintain SDKs for JavaScript, Python, Ruby, PHP, Go, Java, C#, and more. Each language has its own conventions, package managers, and release cycles. When the API changes, that's potentially 8+ SDKs that need updating, testing, and coordinating releases. Auto-generating SDKs from an OpenAPI spec can help with development, but you still have to deal with the one thing out of your control: user adoption.</p><p>SDK providers often find themselves supporting legacy versions for years because large enterprise customers can't easily upgrade. This fragments the ecosystem and slows innovation.</p><p>The result? Many API providers either:</p><ul><li>Move extremely slowly to avoid breaking changes</li><li>Implement complex versioning schemes that add overhead</li><li>Accept that a significant portion of their user base will always be on outdated SDKs</li></ul><p>It's getting harder for infra teams to make the case to upgrade SDKs that are still working, meaning you have to be landing world-changing features to give users a reason to do it.</p><p>A natural language approach could help break this cycle by making the integration layer more resilient to API changes, reducing the pressure on both sides.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  A natural language bridge\n</h2><p>Instead of memorizing SDK methods or building MCP servers from scratch, what if we could describe what we want in natural language?</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>A thin wrapper is used in conjunction with an LLM to parse the request. Under the hood, an LLM reads the API's OpenAPI specification and your natural language request, then generates the appropriate HTTP call. When the API evolves, the system adapts automatically. The wrapper is installed once and never needs to be updated.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Self-healing: when APIs change overnight\n</h2><p>Perhaps the most intriguing aspect of this approach is its potential for self-healing behavior. Traditional SDKs break when APIs evolve, but an LLM-powered system can potentially adapt in real-time.</p><p>Here's how it works: when an API call fails with a 400 error (indicating the request format is wrong), the agent can automatically:</p><ul><li>Invalidate the cached request pattern</li><li>Re-read the latest OpenAPI specification</li><li>Generate a fresh request with the LLM</li><li>Cache the new pattern locally for future use\n</li></ul><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>The self-healing loop looks something like this:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>This creates a fascinating dynamic: the first time you encounter a breaking API change in your project, you pay the \"healing cost\" (LLM latency and usage), but subsequent calls in your local environment benefit from the updated cache.</p><blockquote><p>: This self-healing behavior works best for schema changes (field renames, new required fields) but couldn't handle semantic changes where the fundamental operation changes. It's also not foolproof—sometimes a 400 error indicates bad user input, not API evolution.</p></blockquote><h2>\n  \n  \n  Local caching for performance\n</h2><p>One advantage of this approach is local semantic caching. The first time you ask to \"create customer\", the system pays the LLM cost and caches the result locally. But \"create customer\", \"add new customer\", and \"register user\" are semantically similar—they can share the same cached response.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>The cache grows organically within your local environment. Popular patterns in your codebase become as fast as traditional SDK calls, without the security concerns of shared caches or the maintenance burden of community-managed packages.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Security: the elephant in the room\n</h2><p>The benefits are hopefully self-apparent, but we need to address the significant security implications. Having an LLM generate and execute API calls introduces several attack vectors that don't exist with traditional SDKs:</p><ul><li>: If user input influences the natural language task description, malicious users could potentially inject instructions that cause the LLM to generate unintended API calls:\n</li></ul><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><ul><li><p>: LLMs sometimes include sensitive data in their reasoning process. There's a risk that API keys or other credentials could be logged or leaked through the LLM's output.</p></li><li><p>: Unlike traditional SDKs where operations are explicit, natural language instructions could be misinterpreted in dangerous ways:</p></li></ul><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><ul><li>: The automatic healing mechanism could potentially \"fix\" API calls in ways that bypass intended security restrictions or change the operation's scope.</li></ul><p>These security concerns would need to be thoroughly addressed through:</p><ul><li>Strict input sanitization and validation (i.e. guardrails)</li><li>Sandboxed execution environments</li><li>Audit logging of all LLM-generated requests</li><li>Rate limiting and anomaly detection</li><li>Clear boundaries around which operations are allowed</li><li>Human review processes for sensitive operations</li></ul><p>The security model would be fundamentally different from traditional SDKs, where the attack surface is well-understood and contained.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Learning from MCP's design principles\n</h2><p>The MCP approach teaches us important lessons about AI-API integration. As the Frank Fiegel article linked above explains, MCP solves the reliability problem by having \"LLM picks which tool → wrapped code executes deterministically\" rather than \"LLM writes the HTTP request → hallucinated paths, wrong parameters.\"</p><p>The initial approach of having LLMs generate raw HTTP requests has an inherent reliability problem. A better architecture might generate MCP-style tool calls:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>This gives us the safety and determinism that MCP tools provide while maintaining the natural language interface for human developers. It also significantly reduces the security attack surface since the LLM only picks from pre-defined tools rather than generating arbitrary HTTP requests.</p><p>Instead of several SDKs, we have thin wrappers to make calls to the LLM. The MCP tooling is kept up to date either by using official MCP servers or those generated from an OpenAPI spec.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  CLI simplicity for human workflows\n</h2><p>The concept extends naturally to command-line usage, bridging the gap between human workflows and API complexity:</p><div><pre><code>\nmy-agent call \nmy-agent cache stats\n\nmy-agent cache health\n</code></pre></div><h2>\n  \n  \n  Fitting into the MCP ecosystem\n</h2><p>Rather than competing with MCP, this approach could complement it in several ways:</p><ol><li>: Use natural language examples to auto-generate MCP servers from OpenAPI specs:\n</li></ol><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><ol><li><strong>Developer-Friendly MCP Interface</strong>: Provide a natural language layer on top of existing MCP servers:\n</li></ol><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><ol><li>: Help developers quickly explore APIs before building proper MCP integrations.</li></ol><h2>\n  \n  \n  The type safety challenge\n</h2><p>One significant trade-off of this approach becomes apparent when we look at the return values. With traditional SDKs, you get compile-time guarantees:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>But with natural language calls, we lose that certainty:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>This is a fundamental trade-off between flexibility and type safety. However, there are several potential solutions:</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Generated Types from OpenAPI\n</h3><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><h3>\n  \n  \n  Runtime Schema Validation\n</h3><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>The wrapper could learn response shapes over time and provide IDE suggestions based on previous calls to similar endpoints.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  The pros: what works well\n</h2><ul><li>: Describing intent in natural language feels more human than memorizing SDK methods or building MCP servers.</li><li>: Works with existing APIs immediately, no need to wait for MCP server implementations.</li><li><strong>Self-healing capabilities</strong>: Can automatically adapt to API changes without developer intervention.</li><li>: The thin wrapper is installed once and never needs updating, eliminating a major pain point of traditional SDKs.</li><li>: Semantic caching means popular patterns in your codebase become fast without external dependencies.</li><li>: Could generate MCP-style tool calls for better reliability while maintaining natural language UX.</li><li>: Reduces the burden on SDK providers to maintain multiple language implementations and coordinate releases.</li></ul><h2>\n  \n  \n  The cons: honest challenges\n</h2><ul><li>: Introduces new attack vectors around prompt injection, credential exposure, and unvalidated operations that don't exist with traditional SDKs.</li><li>: Even with structured output, LLMs can misinterpret intent. MCP's pre-built tools are inherently more reliable.</li><li>: Can handle schema changes but not semantic API changes. May incorrectly \"heal\" when the real issue is bad user input.</li><li>: Adding an LLM layer introduces latency and complexity that SDKs avoid.</li><li>: When the system makes automatic decisions, developers need comprehensive logging and review capabilities.</li><li>: This is designed for human developers, while the ecosystem is moving toward AI agents that work better with MCP.</li></ul><h2>\n  \n  \n  Where this fits (and doesn't)\n</h2><p>This concept has exciting potential across several contexts:</p><ul><li>Human developers working with legacy APIs that lack MCP servers</li><li>Rapid prototyping and API exploration where speed matters more than perfection</li><li>Educational contexts where natural language reduces learning curve</li><li>Building MCP servers by auto-generating from examples</li><li>Development environments where the convenience-security trade-off makes sense</li></ul><ul><li>Production AI agents (MCP is purpose-built for this)</li><li>Security-sensitive operations without extensive safeguards</li><li>Complex workflows requiring bidirectional communication</li><li>Mission-critical applications where determinism is paramount</li></ul><h2>\n  \n  \n  Exciting possibilities ahead\n</h2><p>What excites me most about this approach is how it could reduce real pain SDK providers and consumers are feeling. Most APIs don't have MCP servers yet, and most developers aren't building pure AI agents. This natural language approach could serve as valuable scaffolding—making existing APIs more approachable while the ecosystem evolves toward MCP.</p><p>The self-healing aspect opens up particularly interesting possibilities for developers working with rapidly evolving APIs. Imagine a world where your integrations automatically adapt to API changes without requiring wrapper updates or manual intervention.</p><p>The security challenges are real, but they're solvable with the right architectural decisions—particularly if we embrace the MCP-style approach of having LLMs pick from pre-defined tools rather than generating arbitrary requests and use increasingly industry standard guardrails on inputs and outputs.</p><p>I'm writing this largely to measure whether others see merit in the idea.

Root cause analysis revealed the new model, while improving overall accuracy, exhibited a significant shift in its latent space representation of legitimate transactions. This wasn’t a model bug , but a failure to adequately monitor and validate the  of the learned representations. This incident highlighted the necessity of a dedicated “autoencoder project” – a system for monitoring, validating, and governing the latent spaces generated by autoencoders used across our ML infrastructure.</p><p>An autoencoder project isn’t simply about training autoencoders. It’s a holistic system encompassing data pipelines, model training, validation, deployment, monitoring, and rollback mechanisms specifically tailored to the unique challenges of working with learned representations. It’s a core component of a mature MLOps practice, addressing compliance requirements for model explainability and enabling scalable inference for anomaly detection, feature engineering, and data quality monitoring.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  2. What is \"autoencoder project\" in Modern ML Infrastructure?\n</h3><p>An “autoencoder project” in a modern ML infrastructure is a dedicated set of tools and processes for managing the lifecycle of autoencoders and the latent spaces they produce. It’s not a single model, but a  built around them.  This system interacts heavily with existing MLOps components:</p><ul><li> For tracking autoencoder training runs, parameters, metrics (reconstruction loss, KL divergence), and model versions.</li><li> Orchestrating data pipelines for training data preparation, latent space validation, and periodic retraining.</li><li> Distributed training of autoencoders, particularly for large datasets.</li><li> Deploying autoencoder inference services and latent space monitoring agents.</li><li><strong>Feature Store (Feast, Tecton):</strong>  Storing and serving latent representations as features for downstream models.</li><li><strong>Cloud ML Platforms (SageMaker, Vertex AI):</strong> Leveraging managed services for training, deployment, and monitoring.</li></ul><p>The key trade-off is between the complexity of managing a dedicated system versus the risk of undetected latent space drift impacting downstream applications. System boundaries typically involve defining clear ownership of the autoencoder project, establishing data quality SLAs for training data, and defining acceptable thresholds for latent space drift. Common implementation patterns include: 1) dedicated autoencoder pipelines for each use case, 2) a centralized autoencoder service serving latent representations to multiple downstream models, and 3) a hybrid approach combining both.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  3. Use Cases in Real-World ML Systems\n</h3><p>Autoencoder projects are critical in several real-world scenarios:</p><ul><li><strong>Fraud Detection (Fintech):</strong> Identifying anomalous transactions by measuring reconstruction error in the latent space.  A sudden increase in reconstruction error for a specific transaction type can signal fraudulent activity.</li><li><strong>Anomaly Detection in Manufacturing:</strong> Detecting defects in products by training autoencoders on images or sensor data from normal operation.</li><li><strong>Personalized Recommendations (E-commerce):</strong>  Generating user embeddings (latent representations) for collaborative filtering and content-based recommendation systems.

Traffic shaping (using Istio or similar) allows for canary rollouts, gradually shifting traffic to the new model while monitoring its performance. Rollback mechanisms are triggered by exceeding predefined thresholds for reconstruction error or latent space drift.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  5.

Failure Modes &amp; Risk Management\n</h3><p>Potential failure modes include:</p><ul><li> Autoencoders trained on outdated data may not accurately represent current data distributions.</li><li> Changes in the input data distribution can lead to significant latent space drift.</li><li> Increased load or inefficient inference code can cause latency spikes.</li><li> Unexpectedly high reconstruction errors can indicate data corruption or model failure.</li><li>  Malicious actors could craft inputs designed to exploit vulnerabilities in the autoencoder.</li></ul><p>Mitigation strategies include: automated retraining pipelines triggered by data drift detection, circuit breakers to prevent cascading failures, automated rollback to previous model versions, and robust input validation.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  7. Performance Tuning &amp; System Optimization\n</h3><p>Key metrics: P90/P95 latency, throughput (requests per second), reconstruction loss, KL divergence, and infrastructure cost. Optimization techniques include:</p><ul><li> Processing multiple inputs in a single inference request.</li><li> Caching frequently accessed latent representations.</li><li> Utilizing optimized libraries (e.g., NumPy, TensorFlow) for efficient computation.</li><li> Dynamically adjusting the number of autoencoder instances based on load.</li><li> Identifying performance bottlenecks using tools like cProfile or PyTorch Profiler.</li></ul><h3>\n  \n  \n  8. Monitoring, Observability &amp; Debugging\n</h3><p>Observability stack: Prometheus for metric collection, Grafana for visualization, OpenTelemetry for tracing, Evidently for latent space drift detection, and Datadog for comprehensive monitoring. Critical metrics: reconstruction error distribution, KL divergence, latency, throughput, and resource utilization. Alert conditions: exceeding predefined thresholds for reconstruction error, significant latent space drift, or latency spikes.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  9. Security, Policy &amp; Compliance\n</h3><p>Autoencoder projects must adhere to security and compliance requirements. This includes: audit logging of model training and inference requests, secure access control to data and models (IAM, Vault), and reproducibility of experiments (MLflow). Governance tools like OPA can enforce policies related to data privacy and model fairness.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  10. CI/CD &amp; Workflow Integration\n</h3><p>Integration with CI/CD pipelines (GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Argo Workflows) is crucial. Deployment gates should include automated tests for model accuracy, latent space stability, and performance. Rollback logic should be automated based on predefined failure criteria.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  11. Common Engineering Pitfalls\n</h3><ul><li><strong>Ignoring Latent Space Drift:</strong> Failing to monitor and validate the latent space can lead to undetected model degradation.</li><li><strong>Insufficient Data Quality Checks:</strong> Poor data quality can result in inaccurate latent representations.</li><li>  Inability to reproduce experiments hinders debugging and auditing.</li><li><strong>Overly Complex Architectures:</strong>  Unnecessary complexity increases maintenance overhead and reduces reliability.</li><li><strong>Ignoring Adversarial Robustness:</strong>  Failing to consider potential adversarial attacks can compromise system security.</li></ul><h3>\n  \n  \n  12. Best Practices at Scale\n</h3><p>Lessons from mature ML platforms (Michelangelo, Cortex) emphasize:</p><ul><li><strong>Centralized Model Registry:</strong> A single source of truth for all models.</li><li><strong>Automated Data Validation:</strong>  Rigorous data quality checks at every stage of the pipeline.</li><li><strong>Standardized Monitoring &amp; Alerting:</strong> Consistent metrics and alerting across all ML systems.</li><li><strong>Cost Tracking &amp; Optimization:</strong>  Monitoring and optimizing infrastructure costs.</li><li><strong>Tenancy &amp; Resource Isolation:</strong>  Ensuring fair resource allocation and preventing interference between different teams.</li></ul><p>An autoencoder project is no longer a “nice-to-have” but a “must-have” for organizations deploying autoencoders at scale. It’s a critical component of a robust MLOps practice, enabling reliable, scalable, and compliant ML systems. Next steps include benchmarking different autoencoder architectures, integrating with advanced anomaly detection algorithms, and conducting regular security audits.  Investing in a dedicated autoencoder project is an investment in the long-term health and reliability of your ML infrastructure.</p>","contentLength":9739,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Utilize machine learning to improve employee retention rates","url":"https://www.datasciencecentral.com/utilize-machine-learning-to-improve-employee-retention-rates/","date":1751295590,"author":"Zachary Amos","guid":176738,"unread":true,"content":"<p>Employee turnover is one of the most pressing challenges modern businesses face.

Although text documents are well-integrated into modern knowledge management systems, rich information contained in diagrams, charts, technical schematics, and visual documentation often remains inaccessible to search and AI assistants. This creates significant gaps in organizational knowledge bases, leading to interpreting visual data manually and preventing automation systems from using critical visual information for comprehensive insights and decision-making. While <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/q/business/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Amazon Q Business</a> already handles embedded images within documents, the <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonq/latest/qbusiness-ug/custom-document-enrichment.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">custom document enrichment</a> (CDE) feature extends these capabilities significantly by processing standalone image files (for example, JPGs and PNGs).</p><p>In this post, we look at a step-by-step implementation for using the CDE feature within an <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonq/latest/qbusiness-ug/create-application.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Amazon Q Business application</a>. We walk you through an <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">AWS Lambda</a> function configured within CDE to process various image file types, and we showcase an example scenario of how this integration enhances the Amazon Q Business ability to provide comprehensive insights. By following this practical guide, you can significantly expand your organization’s searchable knowledge base, enabling more complete answers and insights that incorporate both textual and visual information sources.</p><h2>Example scenario: Analyzing regional educational demographics</h2><p>Consider a scenario where you’re working for a national educational consultancy that has charts, graphs, and demographic data across different <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/glossary/latest/reference/glos-chap.html#region\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">AWS Regions</a> stored in an <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/s3/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Amazon Simple Storage Service</a> (Amazon S3) bucket. The following image shows student distribution by age range across various cities using a bar chart. The insights in visualizations like this are valuable for decision-making but traditionally locked within image formats in your S3 buckets and other storage.</p><p>With Amazon Q Business and CDE, we show you how to enable natural language queries against such visualizations. For example, your team could ask questions such as “Which city has the highest number of students in the 13–15 age range?” or “Compare the student demographics between City 1 and City 4” directly through the Amazon Q Business application interface.</p><p>You can bridge this gap using the Amazon Q Business CDE feature to:</p><ol><li>Detect and process image files during the document ingestion process</li><li>Extract structured data and insights from charts and graphs</li><li>Make this information searchable using natural language queries</li></ol><p>In this solution, we walk you through how to implement a CDE-based solution for your educational demographic data visualizations. The solution empowers organizations to extract meaningful information from image files using the <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonq/latest/qbusiness-ug/cde-basic-operations.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">CDE capability</a> of Amazon Q Business. When Amazon Q Business encounters the S3 path during ingestion, CDE rules automatically trigger a Lambda function. The Lambda function identifies the image files and calls the Amazon Bedrock API, which uses multimodal <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/large-language-model/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">large language models</a> (LLMs) to analyze and extract contextual information from each image. The extracted text is then seamlessly integrated into the knowledge base in Amazon Q Business. End users can then quickly search for valuable data and insights from images based on their actual context. By bridging the gap between visual content and searchable text, this solution helps organizations unlock valuable insights previously hidden within their image repositories.</p><p>The following figure shows the high-level architecture diagram used for this solution.</p><p>For this use case, we use Amazon S3 as our data source. However, this same solution is adaptable to other data source types supported by Amazon Q Business, or it can be implemented with custom data sources as needed.To complete the solution, follow these high-level implementation steps:</p><ol><li>Create an Amazon Q Business application and sync with an S3 bucket.</li><li>Configure the Amazon Q Business application CDE for the Amazon S3 data source.</li><li>Extract context from the images.</li></ol><p>The following prerequisites are needed for implementation:</p><h2>Create an Amazon Q Business application and sync with an S3 bucket</h2><p>To create an Amazon Q Business application and connect it to your S3 bucket, complete the following steps. These steps provide a general overview of how to create an Amazon Q Business application and synchronize it with an S3 bucket. For more comprehensive, step-by-step guidance, follow the detailed instructions in the blog post <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/discover-insights-from-amazon-s3-with-amazon-q-s3-connector/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Discover insights from Amazon S3 with Amazon Q S3 connector</a>.</p><ol><li>Create an index for your Amazon Q Business application.</li><li>Use the built-in Amazon S3 connector to link your application with documents stored in your organization’s S3 buckets.</li></ol><h2>Configure the Amazon Q Business application CDE for the Amazon S3 data source</h2><p>With the CDE feature of Amazon Q Business, you can make the most of your Amazon S3 data sources by using the sophisticated capabilities to modify, enhance, and filter documents during the ingestion process, ultimately making enterprise content more discoverable and valuable. When connecting Amazon Q Business to S3 repositories, you can use CDE to seamlessly transform your raw data, applying modifications that significantly improve search quality and information accessibility. This powerful functionality extends to extracting context from binary files such as images through integration with Amazon Bedrock services, enabling organizations to unlock insights from previously inaccessible content formats. By implementing CDE for Amazon S3 data sources, businesses can maximize the utility of their enterprise data within Amazon Q, creating a more comprehensive and intelligent knowledge base that responds effectively to user queries.To configure the Amazon Q Business application CDE for the Amazon S3 data source, complete the following steps:</p><ol><li>Select your application and navigate to .</li><li>Choose your existing Amazon S3 data source or create a new one. Verify that  under <strong>Multi-media content configuration</strong> is not enabled.</li><li>In the data source configuration, locate the <strong>Custom Document Enrichment</strong> section.</li><li>Configure the pre-extraction rules to trigger a Lambda function when specific S3 bucket conditions are satisfied.

By using Amazon Q Business to process these visualizations with Amazon Bedrock LLMs using the CDE feature, we’ve enabled a more interactive and insightful analysis experience. The service effectively extracts the contextual information embedded in the graph, even when explicit labels are absent. This powerful combination means that end users can ask questions about the visualization and receive responses based on the underlying data. Rather than being limited by what’s explicitly labeled in the graph, users can now explore deeper insights through natural language queries.

Using a <a href=\"https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction#general-architecture\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">client-server architecture</a> (as illustrated in the following diagram), the MCP helps developers expose their data through lightweight MCP servers while building AI applications as MCP clients that connect to these servers.</p><p>The MCP uses a client-server architecture containing the following components:</p><ul><li> – A program or AI tool that requires access to data through the MCP protocol, such as Anthropic’s Claude Desktop, an integrated development environment (IDE), AWS MCP CLI, or other AI applications</li><li> – Protocol clients that maintain one-to-one connections with server</li><li> – Lightweight programs that expose capabilities through standardized MCP or act as tools</li><li> – Local data sources such as databases and file systems, or external systems available over the internet through APIs (web APIs) that MCP servers can connect with</li></ul><p><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2025/04/amazon-q-developer-cli-model-context-protocol/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">As announced in April 2025</a>, MCP enables <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/q/developer/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Amazon Q Developer</a> to connect with specialized servers that extend its capabilities beyond what’s possible with the base model alone. MCP servers act as plugins for Amazon Q, providing domain-specific knowledge and functionality. The AWS Diagram MCP server specifically enables Amazon Q to generate architecture diagrams using the Python diagrams package, with access to the complete AWS icon set and architectural best practices.</p><p>To implement this solution, you must have an AWS account with appropriate permissions and follow the steps below.</p><p>Before you can start creating diagrams, you need to set up your environment with Amazon Q CLI, the AWS Diagram MCP server, and AWS Documentation MCP server. This section provides detailed instructions for installation and configuration.</p><h3><strong>Install Amazon Q Developer CLI</strong></h3><p>Amazon Q Developer CLI is available as a standalone installation. Complete the following steps to install it:</p><ol><li>Download and install Amazon Q Developer CLI. For instructions, see Using Amazon Q Developer on the command line.</li><li>Verify the installation by running the following command: <em>You should see output similar to the following: Amazon Q Developer CLI version 1.x.x</em></li><li>Configure Amazon Q CLI with your AWS credentials: </li></ol><p>Complete the following steps to set up your MCP servers:</p><ol><li>Install uv using the following command: </li><li>Install Python 3.10 or newer: </li><li>Install <a href=\"https://www.graphviz.org/download/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">GraphViz</a> for your operating system.</li><li>Add the servers to your  file:</li></ol><pre><code>{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"awslabs.aws-diagram-mcp-server\": {\n      \"command\": \"uvx\",\n      \"args\": [\"awslabs.aws-diagram-mcp-server\"],\n      \"env\": {\n        \"FASTMCP_LOG_LEVEL\": \"ERROR\"\n      },\n      \"autoApprove\": [],\n      \"disabled\": false\n    },\n    \"awslabs.aws-documentation-mcp-server\": {\n      \"command\": \"uvx\",\n      \"args\": [\"awslabs.aws-documentation-mcp-server@latest\"],\n      \"env\": {\n        \"FASTMCP_LOG_LEVEL\": \"ERROR\"\n      },\n      \"autoApprove\": [],\n      \"disabled\": false\n    }\n  }\n}\n</code></pre><p>Now, Amazon Q CLI automatically discovers MCP servers in the  file.</p><h2><strong>Understanding MCP server tools</strong></h2><p>The AWS Diagram MCP server provides several powerful tools:</p><ul><li> – Lists available icons from the diagrams package, organized by provider and service category</li><li> – Provides example code for different types of diagrams (AWS, sequence, flow, class, and others)</li><li> – Creates a diagram from Python code using the diagrams package</li></ul><p>The AWS Documentation MCP server provides the following useful tools:</p><ul><li> – Searches AWS documentation using the official AWS Documentation Search API</li><li> – Fetches and converts AWS documentation pages to markdown format</li><li> – Gets content recommendations for AWS documentation pages</li></ul><p>These tools work together to help you create accurate architecture diagrams that follow AWS best practices.</p><p>Let’s verify that everything is working correctly by generating a simple diagram:</p><p>The AWS Diagram MCP server supports several configuration options to customize your diagramming experience:</p><ul><li> – By default, diagrams are saved in a generated-diagrams directory in your current working directory. You can specify a different location in your prompts.</li><li> – The default output format is PNG, but you can request other formats like SVG in your prompts.</li><li> – You can specify colors, shapes, and other styling elements in your prompts.</li></ul><p>Now that our environment is set up, let’s create more diagrams.</p><h2><strong>Create AWS architecture diagrams</strong></h2><p>In this section, we walk through the process of multiple AWS architecture diagrams using Amazon Q CLI with the AWS Diagram MCP server and AWS Documentation MCP server to make sure our requirements follow best practices.</p><p>When you provide a prompt to Amazon Q CLI, the AWS Diagram and Documentation MCP servers complete the following steps:</p><ol><li>Interpret your requirements.</li><li>Check for best practices on the AWS documentation.</li><li>Generate Python code using the diagrams package.</li><li>Execute the code to create the diagram.</li><li>Return the diagram as an image.</li></ol><p><em>This process happens seamlessly, so you can focus on describing what you want rather than how to create it.</em></p><p><strong>AWS architecture diagrams typically include the following components:</strong></p><ul><li> – AWS services and resources</li><li> – Connections between nodes showing relationships or data flow</li><li> – Logical groupings of nodes, such as virtual private clouds (VPCs), subnets, and Availability Zones</li><li> – Text descriptions for nodes and connections</li></ul><h2><strong></strong></h2><p>Let’s create a diagram for a simple web application hosted on AWS.

In life, it helps you stay grounded under pressure.</p><blockquote><p>People with high EQ are the ones others trust and want to follow.</p></blockquote><p>LQ is less commonly talked about, but just as important. It represents your capacity to care about people, purpose, and long-term impact.</p><p>In a world increasingly shaped by technology and automation, LQ is what makes us human. It's kindness in leadership, compassion in decisions, and meaning behind action.</p><blockquote><p>Machines can replicate logic.

These systems were effective but easily exploitable.</p><p>As players became more experienced, developers recognized the need to craft more lifelike, adaptive, and unpredictable opponents. AI techniques have since evolved to include behavior trees, utility systems, machine learning, and goal-oriented action planning (GOAP). These methods allow enemies to react in real time, assess situations, and simulate intelligence.</p><p>Key milestones in AI enemy evolution:</p><ul><li>DOOM (1993): Enemies navigated 2D maps with basic chase logic</li><li>Half-Life (1998): Introduced squad-based AI that could retreat and flank</li><li>F.E.A.R. (2005): Pioneered adaptive enemy AI with cover mechanics and coordinated behavior</li><li>The Last of Us Part II (2020): Enemies used dynamic group strategies, named allies, and adjusted tactics</li><li>Each generation of games has raised the bar for what’s expected in enemy intelligence, setting the stage for today’s AI-driven experiences.</li></ul><h2>\n  \n  \n  Why Smart Enemies Matter in 3D Games\n</h2><p>Enemy intelligence isn’t just a technical flex — it’s critical to player immersion, engagement, and replayability. Smarter enemies create more satisfying challenges and make the game world feel alive.</p><p>Impact of intelligent enemy AI:</p><ul><li>Keeps players on their toes with unpredictable encounters</li><li>Encourages creativity and experimentation with tactics</li><li>Increases emotional investment through reactive storytelling</li><li>Makes each playthrough unique and dynamic</li><li>Without smart AI, even the most stunning 3D worlds can feel empty or repetitive. In contrast, well-executed AI creates emergent gameplay, where unscripted scenarios unfold based on player and enemy interactions.</li></ul><h2>\n  \n  \n  Core AI Techniques Enhancing 3D Enemies\n</h2><p>Game developers leverage a combination of traditional and modern AI methods to build intelligent enemies that adapt and respond in real time.</p><p>Behavior Trees\nBehavior trees are one of the most widely used structures in modern game AI. They allow for modular, reusable decision-making systems where enemies evaluate conditions and perform actions based on priority.</p><p>Use case:\nIn Assassin’s Creed, guards use behavior trees to patrol, investigate sounds, chase the player, or return to normal routines.</p><ul><li>Easy to expand with complex logic</li><li>Efficient for performance-constrained environments</li><li>Goal-Oriented Action Planning (GOAP)</li><li>GOAP is a decision-making system where enemies plan a sequence of actions to achieve specific goals based on world states and priorities.</li></ul><p>Example:\nIn F.E.A.R., AI enemies use GOAP to seek cover, flank the player, reload, and regroup dynamically.</p><p>Enables adaptive, strategic decisions\nMakes enemy actions feel deliberate and calculated<p>\nNavigation and Pathfinding</p>\nAI enemies must move through 3D environments in believable ways. Pathfinding systems like A* (A-star) and NavMesh allow enemies to navigate terrain, avoid obstacles, and reposition intelligently.</p><p>Dynamic obstacle avoidance using raycasting\nClimbing, swimming, or flying behavior<p>\nReal-time path recalculation during player pursuit</p>\nReal-world example:<p>\nHalo’s Covenant enemies dynamically use terrain, vehicles, and elevation to outmaneuver players.</p></p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Machine Learning in Enemy AI\n</h2><p>Machine learning introduces a new frontier in game AI where enemies can learn from players, adapt strategies over time, and improve without manual scripting.</p><p>Reinforcement Learning\nEnemies trained with reinforcement learning can adapt by trial and error. They receive rewards or penalties based on actions and evolve optimal strategies.</p><p>Use case:\nUbisoft La Forge has experimented with reinforcement learning to develop AI agents that improve their tactics through thousands of simulations.</p><p>Neural Networks\nNeural networks allow AI to recognize patterns in gameplay, such as player movement or attack rhythms, and respond accordingly.</p><p>In action:\nIn experimental AI mods, enemies trained with neural nets have learned to dodge, counter, and mimic player behaviors effectively.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Limitations and considerations:\n</h2><p>ML-based AI can be unpredictable or unbalanced\nRequires significant training data and computing power<p>\nOften used in companion tools or procedural systems rather than production enemies</p></p><p><strong>Procedural AI: Making Enemies That Evolve</strong>\nProcedural generation isn’t limited to terrain or levels — it also extends to enemy behavior. Procedural AI enables the generation of unique enemy patterns, personalities, and responses every time you play.</p><p>Enemies develop unique traits (e.g., aggression, stealth, loyalty)\nFactions remember the player and change behavior over time<p>\nBosses adapt movesets based on previous encounters</p>\nCase Study: Shadow of Mordor’s Nemesis System</p><p>This system allowed orc enemies to remember past fights, grow in rank, and develop rivalries. Combined with procedural animation and AI, it created deeply personalized and dynamic enemies.</p><p>Makes player choices matter\nEncourages replayability<p>\nTurns enemies into narrative elements</p></p><p>Emotional AI and Immersive Behavior\nAI in 3D games isn’t just about tactics — it’s also about emotional expression and believability. Enemies that express fear, anger, confusion, or panic can create richer interactions and storytelling.</p><p>How emotional AI enhances gameplay:</p><p>Humanized enemies evoke empathy or moral tension\nDynamic voice lines react to player actions in real time<p>\nGroup AI systems trigger panic when a leader falls</p></p><p>Example:\nIn The Last of Us Part II, enemies call each other by name, mourn fallen allies, and change behavior based on emotional states.</p><p>This level of immersion elevates enemy AI beyond mechanics — it becomes a storytelling tool.</p><p>Tools and Engines Supporting AI in 3D Game Development\nDevelopers have access to robust engines and middleware that simplify AI implementation.</p><ul><li>Behavior Designer for creating visual behavior trees</li><li>NavMesh for pathfinding in 3D spaces</li><li>ML-Agents for integrating machine learning</li></ul><p>Built-in support for behavior trees and blackboard systems\nEQS (Environmental Query System) for AI awareness<p>\nMetaHuman AI for emotional and facial animation syncing</p>\nThird-party tools:</p><ul></ul><p>These tools make it easier to create believable AI without reinventing the wheel.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Challenges in Building Smarter Enemies\n</h2><p>Creating advanced AI in games comes with its share of hurdles:</p><p>Real-time AI must be lightweight enough to run on multiple platforms, including consoles and VR devices.</p><p>Overly smart enemies can frustrate players. The challenge lies in making them believable, not unbeatable.</p><p>AI decisions are harder to track and debug than scripted logic. Visualizers and logging systems become essential.</p><p><strong>Ethical and Narrative Impact</strong></p><p>Games with emotional AI must consider how enemy behavior affects narrative tone and player psychology. Is an enemy that pleads for mercy appropriate in all genres?</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Actionable Tips for Game Developers\n</h2><p>If you’re building smarter AI for 3D games, here are practical ways to start:</p><p><strong>Define Player Expectations</strong>\nDecide what kind of intelligence makes sense for your genre and audience. Tactical enemies in a stealth game differ from chaotic mobs in a hack-and-slash.</p><p><strong>Start with Behavior Trees</strong>\nThey offer a scalable, modular way to implement decision-making that’s easy to iterate on.</p><p><strong>Layer Complexity Gradually</strong>\nIntroduce randomness, memory, and learning in stages to avoid unpredictable or buggy behavior.</p><p>\nTrack player interaction with enemy AI to identify patterns, exploitations, and areas for improvement.</p><p>\nTest AI across skill levels and play styles to ensure fairness and challenge are well-balanced.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  The Future of Enemy AI in 3D Games\n</h2><p>The future of AI in gaming points to even greater immersion and personalization.</p><p>\nSystems that anticipate player actions and evolve enemy behavior mid-game.</p><p><strong>AI-as-a-Service in Cloud Gaming</strong>\nEnemy logic offloaded to cloud services, enabling deeper simulations without taxing local hardware.</p><p><strong>Voice-Interactive AI Enemies</strong>\nEnemies that respond to voice commands, taunts, or strategies spoken by the player.</p><p>\nImagine enemies that remember your actions across sequels or online worlds, creating persistent adversaries.</p><p>These innovations signal a future where enemy AI isn’t just a feature — it’s a character, a storyteller, and an adversary worth remembering.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Conclusion: Smarter Enemies Create Smarter Gameplay\n</h2><p>AI is no longer just a backend mechanic in 3D games — it’s the beating heart of dynamic, engaging, and memorable encounters. From stealthy assassins to emotionally reactive bosses, smarter enemies deepen immersion and elevate player experience.</p><p>By embracing advanced AI techniques, developers can build worlds where every battle feels fresh, every encounter matters, and every enemy has a mind of its own.</p>","contentLength":10104,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"5+ Best AI Humanizers of 2025","url":"https://dev.to/artturijalli/5-best-ai-humanizers-of-2025-57eb","date":1751287806,"author":"Artturi Jalli","guid":176631,"unread":true,"content":"<p>I tried the best AI humanizers to save your time and money.</p><p>In this post, I will show you my results after running these tools through extensive tests and AI detectors.</p><p>Here's a short recap of the best tools based on my findings.</p><p>ChatGPT is the most accurate AI humanizer based on my tests and research.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  ChatGPT Humanizer: AI Detection Scores\n</h3><div><table><thead><tr></tr></thead><tbody><tr></tr><tr></tr><tr></tr><tr></tr></tbody></table></div><p>Average score on all AI detectors: </p><ul><li>: ChatGPT got an average score of 72.06% human in my tests.</li><li>: It totally fooled Originality AI and QuillBot AI detectors.

Let’s find out.</p><p>To evaluate HumanizeAI, I did the following:</p><p>Here’s what the most popular detectors reported:</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  HumanizePro AI content scores\n</h3><div><table><thead><tr></tr></thead><tbody><tr></tr><tr></tr><tr></tr></tbody></table></div><p><strong>Total Combined Average (all 16 values):</strong></p><ul><li> = Fully human-written</li></ul><ol><li><strong>Winston AI detected the text as AI.</strong></li><li><strong>Originality AI was mostly fooled.</strong></li><li><strong>QuillBot was only partially fooled.</strong></li><li><strong>Undetectable.ai wasn’t convinced at all.</strong></li></ol><p>The average human score was </p><p><strong>While this is higher than the 6.88% baseline, it’s still poor.</strong></p><p>Nearly half of the time, the output still read as AI-generated.</p><p>Ideally, you’d want scores between 99% and 100% to consider a tool reliable.</p><p>To compare, I ran the same samples through ChatGPT and tested the outputs.</p><p>Here’s how ChatGPT scored:</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  ChatGPT Humanizer: AI Detection Scores\n</h3><div><table><thead><tr></tr></thead><tbody><tr></tr><tr></tr><tr></tr><tr></tr></tbody></table></div><p>Average score on all AI detectors: </p><ol><li><strong>Winston AI still recognized most of the text as AI.</strong></li><li><strong>Originality AI was mostly fooled.</strong></li><li><strong>QuillBot was completely fooled.</strong></li><li><strong>Undetectable.ai was mostly fooled.</strong></li></ol><p>ChatGPT achieved an average score of </p><p>In comparison, HumanizeAI only reached 46.19%.</p><p>Clearly, ChatGPT performed much better.</p><p><strong>In short: I’d choose ChatGPT over HumanizeAI every time.</strong></p><p> (20,000 words)</p><ul><li>Undetectable by AI detectors</li><li>No random or awkward phrasing</li></ul><p> (50,000 words)</p><ul></ul><p> (150,000 words)</p><ul></ul><p>After testing all these tools with a basic prompt, I wanted to see what would happen if I created a more carefully crafted prompt in ChatGPT.</p><p>This time, I told ChatGPT to imitate my personal writing style and used a blog post I had written myself as a reference.</p><p>Surely that approach should work better, right?</p><p>I asked it to match my tone and style exactly.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  ChatGPT AI human scores with improved prompt\n</h3><div><table><thead><tr></tr></thead><tbody><tr></tr><tr></tr><tr></tr></tbody></table></div><p><strong>Total Combined Average (all 16 values):</strong></p><p><strong>The average human score dropped to 47.5%.</strong></p><p>That’s significantly lower than the 70%+ score I got earlier with a simpler prompt.</p><p>Ironically, improving the prompt actually made the humanization worse.</p><p>Maybe it was just random luck (AI outputs are unpredictable), but it still proves how inconsistent these tools are.</p><p><strong>Whatever the reason, this confirms how difficult it is to “humanize” AI text reliably.</strong></p><p>If you try random tools or prompts and your score isn’t above 99%, you already know the technology isn’t dependable.</p><p>So why are AI humanizers generally ineffective?</p><p>Most of these tools are just wrappers around ChatGPT or similar language models. There’s no secret algorithm or special anti-detector technology. What they really do is:</p><ol><li>Take your AI-generated text.</li><li>Add prompt instructions (like “Rewrite this to sound human”).</li><li>Return a rephrased version.</li></ol><p>It’s blunt, but that’s the truth.</p><p>And because AI is rewriting AI, it still ends up sounding artificial.</p><p>AI detectors look for telltale signs: repetition, unnatural flow, too-perfect grammar, and lack of randomness. Even with rephrasing, these traits often remain because the underlying process is still AI.</p><p>Plus, many popular tools don’t train on real human writing—they only rephrase. That might occasionally fool a detector, but not consistently. And when it does, the content often sounds awkward or low quality.</p><p>You might wonder: If they don’t work well, why are there so many?</p><p>It’s not always about building the best product. It’s about meeting demand.</p><p>Right now,  is a high-traffic keyword.</p><p>You can see that from the above Semrush search traffic report. It suggests there are hundreds of thousands of people searching for those every month.</p><p>In the US alone, there are over 246,000 Google searches every month for “AI humanizer.”</p><p>That’s mostly students, freelancers, and SEO professionals trying to bypass detectors.</p><p>Where there’s search volume, there’s a product. It doesn’t matter whether it works. If people look for it, someone will sell it.</p><p>And most users don’t test the results like I did. They paste in text, see a few words changed, and assume it’s good enough. That alone is enough to drive subscriptions and upgrades.</p><p>The developers know it’s imperfect. But if the demand is there, they build it anyway.</p><p>That’s the business model.</p><p>And honestly, I don’t hate it. Most business works that way—someone builds a product that isn’t great, uses the revenue to create something better later.</p><p>Just be aware this is how it operates.</p><p>If you want to beat AI detectors, you don’t need a humanizer.</p><p>Sounds obvious, but it’s the truth.</p><p>The only consistent way to pass detection is to create content only a human could write—based on real experience.</p><p>Not regurgitated facts or generic fluff, but actual expertise.</p><ul><li><strong>Real insights from doing the work</strong></li><li><strong>Details only an expert would know</strong></li><li><strong>Specifics ChatGPT can’t invent</strong></li></ul><p>Check out some of my own posts.</p><p>They aren’t perfect writing.</p><p>But they get read because they save people time and share my firsthand results. That’s what really matters.</p><p>This content doesn’t just pass AI detectors—it makes the web better. It builds trust and authority.</p><p>Yes, it takes work. But it’s supposed to.</p><p>Everyone has access to the same AI tools. If you’re just publishing another generic post, it won’t stand out. Not because it’s unethical—but because it doesn’t work.</p><p>AI detectors can be tricked easily. But even if they weren’t, it wouldn’t fix the core problem.</p><p>AI-generated content just feels artificial.</p><p>When you use a “humanizer,” you’re not creating something new—you’re just making the text slightly less obvious.</p><p>These tools try to game the system: tweaking sentences, adding randomness, breaking up patterns to raise the “human score.”</p><p>Sometimes it works. Often it doesn’t.</p><p>Remember: you don’t win by blending in. You win by adding value. If you don’t have something original to say, it’s better not to say it.</p><p>Personally, I don’t use AI humanizers. I don’t bother with AI detectors either.</p><p>Not because I’m trying to take the high ground—because they’re pointless.</p><p>Even if they worked perfectly, they wouldn’t help.</p><p><strong>It’s about creating content that matters.</strong></p><p>Before AI blew up, freelancers were already writing shallow blog posts on topics they barely understood—just recycled fluff.</p><p>AI just speeds up that process. But the end result is still unhelpful.</p><p>Gaming the system doesn’t work. Search engines are too smart. Readers are too smart. You might pass a detector for a moment, but it won’t matter if your content is bad.</p><p>The only strategy that truly works is this:</p><p>👉 <strong>Write about what you know.</strong></p><p>That’s the whole playbook.</p><p>That’s everything I have to say about AI content humanization.</p><p>If you want to recreate this experiment yourself, here are the resources:</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  The Prompt: ChatGPT Humanizer\n</h2><p><a href=\"https://gist.github.com/artturijalli/602d67ce489a9dbcd559339aaa310ee7\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Here's</a> a link to the ChatGPT humanizer prompt that I used.

It’s no surprise, then, that as a software engineer, I’ve always been interested in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capture_the_flag_(cybersecurity)\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Capture The Flag</a> (CTF) cybersecurity challenges. In these challenges, you need to find a solution (hack) to retrieve a secret string hidden somewhere. This could be in a website, social media, assembly code, images, or any medium that can conceal information. These challenges require a broad range of knowledge, particularly in computer science and software engineering, but also creativity and inventiveness. However, I never dared to try because, in my mind, CTFs were reserved for the elite: the seasoned hackers with skills far beyond my own.</p><p>Now, at 35, life is busier than ever. I recently became a father, and finding time for new pursuits feels almost impossible. But the itch to finally try a CTF remained. My main obstacles? A lack of time and the belief that I didn’t have enough knowledge.</p><p>That’s when generative AI, like <a href=\"https://openai.com/chatgpt/overview/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">ChatGPT</a>, <a href=\"https://gemini.google.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Gemini</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/features/copilot\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Github Copilot</a> sparked an idea: what if I tried hacking with AI as my sidekick? To my surprise, not only were CTF challenges more accessible than I’d imagined, but AI assistants also helped me save precious time by accelerating my learning and problem-solving. Thanks to this partnership, I completed the <a href=\"https://www.404ctf.fr/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">404 CTF</a> — one of France’s most famous competitions — and finished in a respectable 165th place out of more than 2,800 participants.</p><p>In this article, I’ll share how I used AI to supercharge my hacking journey, the tips I picked up along the way, and where the limits of AI became clear. As a disclaimer before diving in, while I used <a href=\"https://github.com/features/copilot\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">GitHub Copilot</a> for this article, other technologies like <a href=\"https://www.cursor.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Cursor</a>, <a href=\"https://claude.ai/login\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Claude</a>, and similar tools are equally valid choices. You can even use several of them simultaneously, the end goal remains the same.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  💬 Prompts I used the most and how I used them\n</h2><h3>\n  \n  \n  Explain me the purpose of XXX?\n</h3><p>GitHub Copilot is an excellent assistant that <a href=\"https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/overview\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">integrates seamlessly with VS Code</a>. Microsoft’s plugin provides a powerful interface where you can query specific lines of code or use a dedicated console to focus Copilot’s attention on particular files or directories.</p><p>Since most CTF challenges begin with analyzing files, Copilot proved to be a perfect investigation tool. My typical workflow starts by asking Copilot to analyze the project, explain its purpose, and map out the function of each file. Then, I examine each file in detail, and whenever I encounter something unfamiliar, I ask Copilot to explain specific sections.</p><blockquote><p><em>\"Copilot, could you explain the purpose of this project? Could you describe the function of each file and directory?\"</em> — prompt example</p></blockquote><p>For instance, one web security challenge included an nginx configuration file. While I don't regularly work with nginx configurations, by asking Copilot to explain specific instructions, I could quickly understand their purpose without leaving VS Code. This allowed me to learn just enough to efficiently identify potential attack vectors.</p><p>An important consideration is that files aren't always immediately readable by Copilot (or any AI assistant). Sometimes you need to be creative with file formatting. For example, when challenges provide binary files, Copilot can't interpret them directly. The solution is to export the binary's hexadecimal or assembly code to a text file. This conversion makes the content accessible to Copilot for analysis. While this approach is valuable for initial investigation, sometime specialized tools are necessary for deeper analysis. In my last example, after the initial examination with Copilot, I had to switch to BinaryNinja for a more thorough investigation of the binary file.</p><p>Another interesting example involves analyzing a pcapng file containing network captures. The challenge was to discover how a malicious user extracted a password from numerous network packets. While this file wasn't readable in VS Code and required Wireshark for viewing, it contained an overwhelming amount of data, including many irrelevant packets. To effectively analyze such data with an AI assistant, you first need to filter out the relevant packets (in my case, HTTP packets) through Wireshark and then export them to a more comprehensible format like JSON. It's essential to perform this initial filtering step, as otherwise, the AI assistant won't be able to analyze the data effectively due to the sheer volume of information.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Do you see any security issues or unusual elements?\n</h3><p>After analyzing the structure of a challenge, there are times when I don't immediately spot relevant issues. In such scenarios, I ask Copilot to identify potential security vulnerabilities. Often, Copilot suggests multiple issues that provide a good foundation for starting to hack. This is where your skills as a hacker/developer become crucial, you need to evaluate and filter these suggestions, identifying which are viable and which aren't. You also need to find synergies and discover exploits that Copilot didn't explicitly mention. Frequently, challenges require exploiting multiple security vulnerabilities in combination rather than just a single issue.</p><blockquote><p><em>\"Copilot, do you see any security issue or unusual elements in route.py? Do you see any deprecated dependencies?\"</em> — prompt example</p></blockquote><p>For example, in one web security challenge from the 404CTF, solving it required combining multiple vulnerabilities that Copilot helped identify such as issues in both the backend and proxy cache server. Out of the various potential problems Copilot pointed out, I had to analyze, select, and connect the relevant ones to reach the solution and extract the flag. This experience shows how AI can accelerate the investigative process, but still requires human intuition to piece everything together.</p><p>Finally, when Copilot identifies vulnerabilities, the method of exploitation isn't always obvious. You can continue the conversation with your AI assistant by asking how to exploit these vulnerabilities and requesting more detailed information. Don't hesitate to ask about specific tools or request step-by-step instructions for executing your hack. Those questions are always instructive and provides valuable learning opportunities.</p><blockquote><p><em>\"Copilot, what's a smuggle request and how can I do it&nbsp;? Can you guide me step-by-step?\"</em> — prompt example</p></blockquote><h3>\n  \n  \n  Write a Python script to accomplish XXX?\n</h3><p>The analysis process generates numerous ideas. Generally, these ideas require some coding to create a proof of concept for a vulnerability. When you're unsure where to start and time is limited, asking an AI to write a small code snippet can be valuable. Copilot can adapt to your repository structure and generate files in the appropriate locations with the requested code. While not essential, this approach saves time.</p><p>One crucial point to notice is that you need to be precise with your requirements; otherwise, the generated code may not align with your needs. Don't hesitate to specify the programming language, preferred libraries, and your desired outcome. The goal isn't to obtain perfect code, but rather to get something you can easily customize to suit your specific needs.</p><blockquote><p><em>\"Copilot, can you write a Python script with pwntools that connects to [IP] and [PORT], receives two numbers, adds them, and sends back the result.\"</em> — prompt example</p></blockquote><h2>\n  \n  \n  🔄 It's an iterative process\n</h2><p>This process is often iterative. Basically, after the global analysis, I enter a loop where I filter the data I have, analyze it, ask questions, inquire about security issues, and reflect on the results. Then, I reiterate again and again until I start to assemble pieces of the puzzle to solve the challenge.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  💔 What's the drawback of using AI for a&nbsp;CTF\n</h2><p>Using AI allows me to learn quickly, but it's exhausting. While you can access specific information and documentation faster than ever, it involves processing a lot of knowledge in a short time. You need to read extensively, maintain focus, and review every suggestion and generated code snippet. It's a different style of work. Counter-intuitively, working with an AI assistant actually consumes more energy than working alone. While one might think that having a computer do the thinking would require less effort, the reality is quite different.</p><p>Working without an AI assistant is a steady hike; working with one is a sprint - you move faster, but it takes a lot more energy.</p><p>A legitimate question might be: is using AI cheating in a CTF? For the easiest challenges, like the Intro or Easy levels in 404CTF, AI can sometimes hand you the solution on a silver platter. But as soon as you move up to Medium or harder, the problems get too complex for Copilot or any AI to just solve for you.</p><p>That's why I don't see AI as a cheat code. In reality, it's just one tool among many, like the ones real hackers use to break systems in the wild. Sometimes it helps, sometimes it doesn't, and it rarely cracks the tough challenges on its own. In cybersecurity, there are no shortcuts, just different methods and tools to reach your goal. And honestly, no hacker would refuse a useful tool just because it feels \"unfair.\"</p><p>AI mostly raises the floor, not the ceiling. It helps beginners level up faster, but expert won't suddenly become stronger thanks to AI alone.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  AI can be censored for certain types of questions\n</h3><p>Sometimes I encountered limitations with Copilot, likely due to ethical considerations. When attempting to create attacks, Copilot sometimes refuses to provide assistance. As a workaround, I needed to specify in my initial prompt that I was working in a CTF context. However, even with this clarification, Copilot might still censor certain responses.</p><p>It's amusing to realize that you sometimes have to find creative ways to \"hack\" Copilot itself. It reminds me of Asimov's novels, where clever loopholes are found in the famous three laws of robotics. In a similar way, you need to think outside the box to get Copilot to do what you want.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  AI can push you to do some unsecure&nbsp;actions\n</h3><p>While asking Copilot how to exploit vulnerabilities, I sometimes received recommendations for tools whose safety I wasn't entirely confident about. When investigating these tools on GitHub, regardless of their quality, they often had few stars, indicating limited usage, and were frequently unmaintained with commits dating back years. This didn't inspire much confidence.</p><p>For example, when I was looking for a password generator based on social knowledge, Copilot recommended tools like pypasswords. While I won't judge this tool's quality, it may be good but pypasswords' last commit was 5 years ago and the project only had 1 star. Without looking in more details, it can be dangerous to install such a library.</p><p>That's why, as personal advice, I recommend not blindly trusting what your AI suggests when it comes to running commands or installing libraries. Always verify what you're about to execute.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  AI can lead you down the wrong&nbsp;path\n</h3><p>I think it's part of the experience, but I've lost count of the times Copilot has hallucinated issues where there were none, or assured me everything was fine when there was actually a subtle problem. I once spent hours trying to craft a smuggling request that turned out to be impossible - simply because Copilot suggested it might work. But as I mentioned earlier, this is a valuable lesson: don't blindly trust everything your AI suggests.</p><p>That said, I'd put this into perspective based on your goals with CTFs. If your aim is to learn new skills, sometimes following the wrong leads can be incredibly educational.</p><p>Using AI to solve CTFs is fun, and I strongly encourage you to try it. You'll sharpen your AI skills for analysis and programming while learning extensively about specific domains. Personally, I focused mainly on web security since I specialize in web development. The knowledge I gained is valuable and helps me spot issues I might have missed before. It's all about honing your skills.</p><p>At Doctolib, we actively encourage software engineers to embrace AI, not to work less, but to free up time for higher-value tasks that truly matter. This philosophy mirrors exactly what I experienced during my CTF journey.</p><p>Just as I used AI to accelerate my learning and problem-solving in cybersecurity challenges, at Doctolib, we leverage tools like GitHub Copilot, Cursor, and Claude Code to streamline routine coding tasks, accelerate debugging, and enhance code exploration. The goal isn't to replace our expertise, but to augment it allowing us to focus on architectural decisions, complex problem-solving, and innovative solutions that improve healthcare for millions of patients.</p><p>Whether it's analyzing nginx configurations in a CTF challenge or refactoring critical healthcare infrastructure at Doctolib, AI serves as an amplifier of human intelligence. The key lesson from both contexts remains the same: AI is most powerful when it enhances human judgment, not when it replaces it.</p><p>Thank you for reading.

But in future? We can do better.</p></blockquote><p>Manual KYC verification not only slowed the onboarding process but also created friction for users. So, I decided to take matters into my own hands.\nIn this blog, I’ll walk you through how I built an Auto KYC (Know Your Customer) Verification System using a combination of OpenCV, Tesseract, and DeepFace (FaceNet) to create a faster, smarter, and secure identity check process.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  What is KYC and Why Automate It?\n</h3><p>KYC (Know Your Customer) is a standard process in fintech and crowdfunding to verify a user’s identity. Traditionally, this involves:</p><ul><li><p>Uploading a valid government-issued document (e.g., citizenship, license)</p></li><li><p>Waiting for a human reviewer to verify both</p></li></ul><p>This manual method is time-consuming, costly, and prone to human error. Automating it not only reduces overhead but also enhances user experience.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  The Problem with Manual KYC\n</h3><p>The typical KYC process is slow:</p><ul><li><p>Users upload their details, documents, and selfies.</p></li><li><p>A human manually cross-checks everything.</p></li><li><p>It takes hours or even days.\nThat doesn’t scale — especially when users expect instant access. I wanted to create a system where users could:</p></li><li><p>Upload their personal details, citizenship/ID image, and selfie</p></li><li><p>Let the system automatically verify:</p></li><li><p>Are the text details valid and extracted from the document?\nDoes the face on the document match the selfie?</p></li></ul><h3>\n  \n  \n  Can Emerging Technologies Solve This?\n</h3><p>Manual KYC processes have always been resource-heavy — requiring human verification, document handling, and judgment-based approval. But in an era where AI and automation are becoming mainstream, there’s a clear opportunity to streamline identity verification using emerging technologies.</p><p>That’s where Computer Vision comes in.</p><p>By leveraging OCR (Optical Character Recognition) and Facial Recognition, we can intelligently extract and verify identity data from uploaded documents and photos — with minimal human intervention.\nModern open-source libraries like Tesseract, OpenCV, and DeepFace make it possible to:</p><ul><li><p>Automatically read and extract text from scanned ID cards</p></li><li><p>Detect faces from document photos and selfies</p></li><li><p>Compare facial features to ensure that the same person is present in both</p></li></ul><h3>\n  \n  \n  How My System Aims to Solve This\n</h3><p>The system I’m building aims to do just that — with a workflow that looks like this:</p><ul><li><p>Their basic personal information (e.g., name, DOB)</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>Uses Tesseract to extract text from the document</p></li><li><p>Applies OpenCV to detect and crop faces from both images</p></li><li><p>Uses DeepFace (with the FaceNet model) to compare the selfie and document photo</p></li><li><p>Cross-verifies the form data with OCR-extracted data and the selfie with the ID face</p></li></ul><h4>\n  \n  \n  3. Based on this, it either:\n</h4><ul><li><p>Automatically approves the KYC request</p></li><li><p>Flags the submission for manual review</p></li></ul><p>This intelligent approach reduces verification time from hours to seconds without compromising trust or security.</p><p>Here’s what I used to implement my KYC automation pipeline:</p><ul><li><p>OpenCV — For image pre-processing and face detection</p></li><li><p>Tesseract OCR — To extract text from ID cards</p></li><li><p>DeepFace (FaceNet) — For comparing the ID photo with a selfie</p></li><li><p>Spring Boot + ReactJS — Backend and frontend integration</p></li><li><p>PostgreSQL — Storing KYC metadata</p></li></ul><h3>\n  \n  \n  Step-by-Step: How Auto KYC Works\n</h3><p>Let’s break down the flow of the auto-verification process:</p><h4>\n  \n  \n  1. User Uploads KYC Document &amp; Selfie\n</h4><p>We allow users to upload:</p><ul><li><p>An image of their citizenship card</p></li><li><p>A selfie\nThese are sent to the backend in a multipart/form-data request, where the verification logic begins.</p></li></ul><h4>\n  \n  \n  2. Preprocessing with OpenCV\n</h4><p>Before any recognition or comparison, I apply preprocessing:</p><div><pre><code>import cv2\n\nimg = cv2.imread('citizenship.jpg')\ngray = cv2.cvtColor(img, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)\ndenoised = cv2.GaussianBlur(gray, (5, 5), 0)\n</code></pre></div><p>\nReduces noise<p>\nIncreases OCR and face detection accuracy</p></p><h4>\n  \n  \n  3. Text Extraction via Tesseract\n</h4><p>Once the image is preprocessed, I pass it to Tesseract OCR to extract information like:</p><ul></ul><div><pre><code>import pytesseract\n\ntext = pytesseract.image_to_string(denoised)\nprint(text)\n</code></pre></div><h4>\n  \n  \n  4. Face Detection and Cropping\n</h4><p>Using OpenCV’s Haar cascades or DNN modules, I detect and crop the face from both:</p><div><pre><code>import cv2\n\nface_cascade = cv2.CascadeClassifier(cv2.data.haarcascades + 'haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml')\nfaces = face_cascade.detectMultiScale(gray, scaleFactor=1.1, minNeighbors=5)\n\nGet the largest face\nx, y, w, h = max(faces, key=lambda f: f[2] * f[3])\nface_crop = doc_img[y:y+h, x:x+w]\n\n Resize slightly larger (helps DeepFace)\nface_resized = cv2.resize(face_crop, (224, 224), interpolation=cv2.INTER_CUBIC)\n</code></pre></div><p>This step is critical because FaceNet requires clean face crops to compute accurate embeddings.</p><h4>\n  \n  \n  5. Face Matching with DeepFace (FaceNet)\n</h4><p>Here comes the magic.\nI use DeepFace’s FaceNet backend to generate embeddings for both cropped faces, and then calculate the cosine distance between them.</p><div><pre><code>from deepface import DeepFace\nresult = DeepFace.verify(img1_path=\"id_face.jpg\", img2_path=\"selfie.jpg\", model_name='Facenet')\nprint(result)\n</code></pre></div><ul><li><p>If the distance &lt; threshold (e.g. 0.4), the faces match</p></li><li><p>This means the selfie is likely from the same person as on the ID</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>Text extracted correctly (e.g. name, citizenship number)</p></li><li><p>Face match confidence is high</p></li><li><p>Match name from OCR with the user-entered full name\nThen, the user is marked as KYC verified.</p></li></ul><p>Some users uploaded blurry or low-light images.

Content creators, founders, and marketers spend hours scheduling and publishing the same types of posts again and again. That’s a perfect candidate for automation.</p><p>Inspired by Einstein’s quote above, I wanted to build something that would help people adapt - and free up their time for more meaningful work. ScrapeFlow AI became a proof-of-concept that showed me how powerful software can be: you can have an idea today, and make it real with some reading, experimenting, and a bit of courage.</p><p>Tech Stack: Django, Celery, Redis, DeepSeek</p><p>I chose Django because I feel comfortable with MVC frameworks, and Django lets you seamlessly work on every aspect of your application.</p><p>This was actually my first time using Celery and Redis - but I’m happy with how quickly I learned. Celery handled the asynchronous background tasks, while Redis acted as the broker.</p><p>For AI-driven content generation, I experimented with DeepSeek. Initially I tried to run a local version to keep the costs at $0, but even when calling the API, it was extremely affordable - only about $0.08 for nearly two months of use!</p><p>One of the hardest parts was fine-tuning the AI prompts. Every time I changed something in the post-creation logic (like tweaking the tone), I had to restart and rebuild the entire Docker container. Sure there were painful moments - but breaking down the work into small steps and celebrating each new feature kept me motivated.</p><p>If I had more time, or a team, I’d love to add things like image generation and more advanced post design. But I’m happy with v1. There weren’t really any “obvious in hindsight” mistakes, which feels good.</p><p>ScrapeFlow AI showed me that the possibilities in the dev world are endless. I’d absolutely expand it with more features if I worked on it again, especially richer post-creation with visuals.</p><p>If you’re a content creator spending hours manually scheduling posts — take a look at ScrapeFlow AI.

But before building models or drawing conclusions, one crucial step must come first: exploration.  </p><p>Data exploration is how teams make sense of their raw information, identify patterns, detect outliers, and form the right hypotheses. It's the stage where questions are born, trends are discovered, and insights begin to take shape. Yet with growing data volumes and increasingly complex sources, traditional exploration methods are no longer enough.  </p><p>In 2025, AI is transforming the way we interact with data. Generative models, intelligent agents, and automation are accelerating what used to take hours into seconds. Whether you're a data analyst, product manager, engineer, or business leader, modern data exploration tools now help you think faster, ask better questions, and get smarter answers — all powered by AI.  </p><p>In this post, we highlight the top data exploration tools in 2025 that are reshaping how we understand and interact with data in the AI era.  </p><h2>\n  \n  \n  What Makes a Great Data Exploration Tool in the AI Era?\n</h2><p>The definition of a \"good\" data exploration tool has evolved. In 2025, it's not just about tables, charts, or SQL editors anymore — it's about intelligence, speed, and accessibility. Here are the key qualities that make a tool stand out today:  </p><p>The best tools go beyond static dashboards — they leverage large language models (LLMs) to summarize trends, generate visualizations, and recommend next steps. This drastically reduces the effort needed to interpret data.  </p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Support for Large and Complex Datasets\n</h3><p>From unstructured text to real-time events and multimodal data, modern tools must handle variety and volume with ease. In-memory processing, columnar engines, and vector support are becoming standard.  </p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Interactivity and Visualization\n</h3><p>Exploration means curiosity. Tools must offer fluid interactivity — filtering, zooming, slicing — combined with beautiful, customizable visual outputs.  </p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Collaboration and Sharing\n</h3><p>Insights are meant to be shared. The best platforms enable seamless collaboration across teams, whether through real-time editing, comments, or embeddable apps.  </p><p>These criteria guided our selection of tools below — each one designed to empower smarter, faster data exploration in the AI-first world. Now, let's dive into the best data exploration tools in 2025.  </p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Top Data Exploration Tools in 2025\n</h2><p>Powerdrill AI is a next-generation data exploration platform that integrates large language models (LLMs) directly into the analysis workflow.

It's about interaction. And in 2025, these tools are at the forefront of that change.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Q1: What is the difference between data exploration and data analysis?\n</h3><p>Data exploration is the first step in understanding your dataset. It involves identifying trends, spotting anomalies, checking distributions, and formulating questions. Data analysis goes further to test hypotheses, validate models, and draw actionable conclusions. <strong>Exploration is about discovery, while analysis is about proof</strong>.  </p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Q2: Are AI-powered data exploration tools only for technical users?\n</h3><p>Not anymore. Many 2025 tools like Powerdrill AI and CoLoop are designed with no-code or natural language interfaces, enabling marketers, PMs, and operators to explore data without writing SQL or Python. At the same time, tools like Hex and DuckDB still cater to developers and data scientists with full code control.  </p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Q3: How do LLMs improve the data exploration process?\n</h3><p>LLMs (Large Language Models) transform the experience by enabling natural language interaction with data. They can:  </p><ul><li>Translate questions into SQL\n</li><li>Summarize trends in plain English\n</li><li>Auto-generate charts and dashboards\n</li></ul><p>This reduces the technical barrier and dramatically speeds up insight discovery.  </p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Q4: Which tool is best for teams that collaborate across roles?\n</h3><p>Hex and Powerdrill AI are ideal for cross-functional teams. They offer a shared canvas for business and technical users to explore, comment, and publish insights. Observable is also great for visual collaboration, especially with frontend or data design teams.  </p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Q5: What's the best free tool to get started?\n</h3><ul><li>: Completely free and powerful for technical users.\n</li><li>: Offers a generous free tier with AI-driven features.\n</li><li>: Provide free plans with limited private sharing.\n</li></ul><p>All are great entry points depending on your skill level and use case.  </p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Q6: How do I choose the right tool for my use case?\n</h3><ul><li>Your technical comfort level (No-code vs code-first)\n</li><li>Team size and collaboration needs\n</li><li>Real-time vs static analysis\n</li><li>Data source compatibility\n</li></ul><p>Use the comparison table above to guide your decision based on these dimensions.</p>","contentLength":14848,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Property Lead Automation Workflow for Real Estate firms","url":"https://dev.to/ammohitchaprana/property-lead-automation-workflow-for-real-estate-firms-ddg","date":1751277173,"author":"Mohit Chaprana","guid":176496,"unread":true,"content":"<p>Recently we have delivered a  Property Lead Automation Workflow for a Real Estate firm, that generated $900,000+ in sales for them</p><p>This workflow automatically searches for potential real estate leads based on configured criteria, obtains owner contact information through skip tracing, and pushes the leads to your CRM. </p><p>It can be run manually or scheduled to run daily.</p>","contentLength":368,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Aetheria: Reimagining Material Discovery with Autonomous AI Agents","url":"https://dev.to/natashacyber777/aetheria-reimagining-material-discovery-with-autonomous-ai-agents-on9","date":1751276451,"author":"Natasha Robinson","guid":176495,"unread":true,"content":"<p>Welcome to  — an experimental multi-agent system I’ve been building, aimed at revolutionizing how we discover novel materials with target properties.\nThis isn’t just a prototype — it’s an attempt to rethink the early stages of <strong>materials science research</strong>, from  to  and <strong>intelligent decision-making</strong>.</p><p>At its core, Aetheria is a system of collaborative AI agents powered by <strong>large language models (LLMs)</strong>.

Open almost any project management tool — Jira, Asana, Monday.com, GitLab, Azure DevOps — and you’ll see AI badges on nearly every feature. We get auto-generated summaries, smart assistants that draft test cases, bots offering suggestions around the clock. It all sounds like the future is finally here.</p><p>But step away from the product pages and into real delivery work, and a stubborn problem remains: traceability. Can you actually follow a single requirement — from user story, through code and tests, all the way to business value? Does AI really help, or does it just make the local pieces shinier, leaving the big picture as tangled as ever?</p><p>This isn’t a lone complaint. Earlier this year, I published an open letter to Atlassian which sparked a lively discussion among professionals in my network. But what’s even more important is that the demand for native, end-to-end traceability in the Atlassian ecosystem has been consistently voiced within the community since at least 2009. I referenced this long-standing need in my one-pager as well. The truth is, while the industry talks about AI driving projects forward, without genuine traceability we’re still just automating isolated steps — not the full journey. [Open letter: <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/traceability-atlassian-missing-ai-enabler-open-letter-oborskyi-z3v4f/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/traceability-atlassian-missing-ai-enabler-open-letter-oborskyi-z3v4f/</a>].</p><p>That’s what pushed me to dig deeper. Here’s my hypothesis: Traceability is the real unlock for modern delivery frameworks in the age of AI. The more visibility and connection AI gets across the software lifecycle — requirements, code, tests, and impact — the more it can do for real teams. Without traceability, every AI feature is still a bit of a sideshow. With it, AI might finally shift from “nice-to-have” to the engine room of project delivery.</p><p>So, what’s in this article? I’m cutting through the marketing and diving into hands-on experience, new product releases, and what people are saying in the trenches. We’ll look at questions like:</p><p>Are Atlassian and its main competitors really integrating AI into their delivery tools — or just relabeling automation?\nDoes any platform actually provide traceability from end to end? Or is that just another buzzword?<p>\nAnd most importantly, why are even the biggest vendors struggling to bridge this gap — and what could change the game?</p>\nAll claims are linked, so you can check sources as you go. Let’s get into it.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Why Traceability Is the Real Enabler for AI in Delivery\n</h2><p>Let’s be honest: most “AI features” in today’s project tools are clever assistants, not full-scale transformers. They’ll write a ticket here, summarize a comment there, maybe help with test coverage. But all this is just local optimization. It’s not close to changing how entire delivery chains operate.</p><p>Here’s the real issue: for AI to make an impact, it needs the full context — the whole story. Not just a backlog or a code repo, not just isolated test cases, but a complete map of how business goals break down into requirements, flow into code, get tested, and eventually bring real value. That’s end-to-end traceability.</p><p>Think of it like this: if AI is the brain, then traceability is the nervous system. No matter how advanced the brain, if the nerves don’t connect the organs, you get twitching muscles, not coordinated movement. Most delivery frameworks today are packed with “muscles” — smart bots and helpers for every little job — but hardly any “nerves” connecting it all together.</p><p>This is why traceability isn’t just another checkbox or dashboard. It’s the underlying structure that lets AI connect cause and effect, understand impact, predict risks, and actually drive system-wide improvement.</p><p>But these gains aren’t automatic. Industry analysts at Epicflow note that the benefits from AI become real only when project data is connected, structured, and traceable. AI project management expert Paul Boudreau says it plainly in his Epicflow interview: “It’s all about having project data in a form that is accessible, accurate, and connected. AI can provide value only when it has good data to work with. If the data is incomplete, inconsistent, or siloed, you can’t expect to get good results from your AI tools.” [Epicflow/Paul Boudreau: <a href=\"https://www.epicflow.com/blog/ai-in-project-management-is-the-future-already-here/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://www.epicflow.com/blog/ai-in-project-management-is-the-future-already-here/</a>].</p><p>Without traceability, AI stays shallow — a bunch of disconnected features that can’t see the big picture.\nWith traceability, AI finally has the context to become a real co-pilot, able to guide, predict, and optimize across the whole delivery chain.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Atlassian’s Competitive Landscape\n</h2><p>Let’s be real: for most software teams, Atlassian is still the gold standard. Jira, Confluence, Bitbucket, Trello — for years, these tools have formed the backbone of delivery. If you’ve worked in tech, you’ve probably lived inside Jira’s dashboards and plugin menus more than you’d care to admit.</p><p>There are plenty of upsides:</p><p>Atlassian pours resources into automation, integrations, and custom workflows.\nThe Atlassian Marketplace is massive. There’s a plugin for almost anything: advanced reporting, custom traceability graphs, process automations, you name it [Atlassian Marketplace: <a href=\"https://marketplace.atlassian.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://marketplace.atlassian.com/</a>].\nBut here’s the catch: despite all this, true end-to-end traceability — following exactly how a requirement turns into code, tests, and working features — is still not a native capability.</p><p>In most real-world Jira setups, traceability means one of three things:</p><p>Real-life example: Talk to any delivery manager or Jira admin and you’ll hear a familiar story: Teams spend weeks wiring up custom issue links, setting up add-ons, and building automations — all to keep requirements, code, and test coverage aligned, especially in regulated or complex projects. Sometimes it works… for a while. But as soon as the team structure shifts or processes change, automations break, plugins demand updates, and reporting falls apart. The usual support answer? “Try this new plugin — and don’t forget to update your automation rules.”</p><p>It’s a cycle that anyone managing traceability in Jira knows all too well.</p><p>Atlassian gives you the Lego bricks — but if you want true traceability (requirements, code, tests, and business value connected), expect to spend serious time and effort piecing it all together.</p><p>Question for readers: How are you solving traceability in Jira? Have you found a way to truly connect requirements, code, and tests in a way that helps AI? Or is your setup still a patchwork of links, plugins, and scripts?</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Monday.com: “AI Vision,” But What About Traceability?\n</h2><p>Monday.com loves to show off its “AI Vision,” promising no-code automations and seamless team collaboration [Monday AI: <a href=\"https://monday.com/w/ai\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://monday.com/w/ai</a>]. The marketing is bold: any workflow, any project, supercharged by AI.</p><p>Here’s what Monday.com AI actually does as of mid-2025:</p><p>AI Assistant: Summarizes tasks and updates, drafts and rewrites descriptions, helps with emails, meeting recaps, and proposals.\nAI Formulas: Autofills board fields, creates formulas and calculations from natural language.<p>\nAI Insights: Summarizes long threads, suggests action items, spots duplicates.</p>\nAI Search &amp; Workflow: Smarter search across boards, and AI steps right into automations.<p>\nIt’s a real boost for everyday task management and communications.</p></p><p>But let’s talk traceability. What’s missing?</p><p>There’s no built-in end-to-end traceability for software delivery. You can’t natively link requirements, code commits, test cases, and releases in a connected flow.\nAI does not analyze code changes, test coverage, or pull requests.<p>\nNo deep, automatic integration with tools like Jira, GitHub, or TestRail to build a true traceability matrix.</p>\nAny attempt at deep integration or artifact linkage? Still a manual job — expect scripts, connectors, or third-party services.<p>\nWhat happens in real teams? Monday.com excels for planning, updates, and automating simple workflows. But if your software team needs to track requirements, code, and tests in sync — the kind of traceability needed for compliance or audits — you’ll end up building your own bridges and maintaining them yourself.</p></p><p>The bottom line: If your priority is fast collaboration and automating routine work, Monday AI delivers.

They mostly sync status, not create a traceability matrix.</p>\nFor full delivery traceability, most teams fall back on spreadsheets, custom scripts, or lots of manual updates.<p>\nHow does this play out? Asana shines for planning, tasks, and basic reporting. But when you need to follow a business requirement all the way to code and tests, you’re forced to patch together other tools — and rely on people to keep the links alive.</p></p><p>Community tip: Some teams juggle Asana for planning and Jira or GitHub for development and testing. It’s doable, but only works if you’re willing to constantly maintain the connections and processes yourself.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  GitLab: Deep DevOps, AI Everywhere — But Traceability Still Takes Work\n</h2><p>GitLab brands itself as the “DevSecOps platform” — one place for code, CI/CD, security, and deployment [GitLab Product Overview: <a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/solutions/devops-platform/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://about.gitlab.com/solutions/devops-platform/</a>]. In recent years, GitLab has rapidly layered on AI features across the pipeline, with the ambition to turn DevOps into a truly “smart” experience.</p><p>What can GitLab AI actually do in 2025?</p><p>Code suggestions: Offers completions and refactoring right in the web IDE [GitLab Duo: <a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/gitlab-duo/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://about.gitlab.com/gitlab-duo/</a>].\nAI summaries: Instantly condenses long discussions, MR comments, and issue threads.<p>\nTest coverage insights: Helps spot gaps in test coverage, flags untested code.</p>\nVulnerability detection: Surfaces security issues earlier in the process.<p>\nBut here’s where the magic stops:</p></p><p>End-to-end traceability isn’t automatic. Yes, you can manually link issues, commits, and merge requests — but mapping the full path from business requirement to code and tests is still a DIY project.\nMost traceability relies on naming conventions, custom tags, or team discipline, not system intelligence.<p>\nThere’s no “traceability matrix” that automatically connects requirements, user stories, code, tests, and releases out of the box.</p>\nFor business-level traceability, most teams end up building their own integrations or scripts to sync requirements from Jira, Confluence, or other external systems.<p>\nWhat does this look like in practice? GitLab shines for engineers who want everything under one roof — code, pipelines, collaboration, with AI features saving time along the way. But if you need a verifiable trail from business request to deployed feature (or you’re facing compliance and audit requirements), you’ll still be piecing things together with templates, scripts, or external tools.</p></p><p>Heads-up for delivery leads and PMs: If traceability is mission-critical (compliance, security, regulated environments), invest early in process design and integration work. GitLab is powerful, but as a “single source of truth” for requirements-to-code-to-test, it isn’t there yet out of the box.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Azure DevOps: Enterprise Integration, Smart Automation — But Still No Native Traceability Chain\n</h2><p>Azure DevOps is Microsoft’s all-in-one platform for source control, build pipelines, test management, and release workflows [Azure DevOps overview: <a href=\"https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/devops/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/devops/</a>]. It’s popular with enterprises for a reason: seamless integration with Microsoft’s ecosystem, flexible processes, and robust security and permissions.</p><p>Here’s what Azure DevOps (and its AI features) can do in 2025:</p><p>AI-powered code suggestions: Code completion and pull request reviews (often via GitHub Copilot).\nAutomated work item creation: Turn customer feedback or incidents into backlog items with built-in automation.<p>\nIntegrated test management: Plan, run, and track test results alongside code and builds.</p>\nDashboards &amp; analytics: Customizable dashboards and anomaly detection, using AI to surface key insights.<p>\nFor teams deeply invested in Microsoft, it’s a comfortable hub for the whole DevOps pipeline.</p></p><p>But what about traceability?</p><p>No out-of-the-box end-to-end traceability. You can link work items (requirements, user stories) to commits, pull requests, builds, and tests — but it’s a manual process.\nThere’s no automatic “traceability matrix” connecting requirements to code to tests to deployment — everything relies on team discipline and custom process.<p>\nFull traceability often requires extra tools, custom Power BI dashboards, or plugins layered on top of Azure DevOps.</p>\nAI features mostly focus on code and workflow automation, not on mapping and validating the entire business-to-code chain.<p>\nHow does this play out in real life? Azure DevOps is great for organizations that want flexible workflows and integration with the rest of Microsoft’s stack. But for regulated industries or anyone facing complex audit requirements, traceability is still a build-it-yourself experience, not something you can just “switch on.”</p></p><p>Insider tip: Many enterprise teams use Azure DevOps in tandem with specialized requirements management tools, third-party traceability plugins, or custom scripts. If audit trails matter, plan ahead — the platform gives you flexibility, but real traceability will take extra work.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Other Notable Platforms: The AI Hype, The Traceability Gap\n</h2><p>Atlassian, Monday.com, Asana, GitLab, and Azure DevOps might dominate the headlines, but plenty of other tools are adding “AI” to their product pitches.</p><p>Notion — well-known for its flexibility with wikis and documentation — now boasts Notion AI, a writing assistant that drafts content, summarizes notes, and answers questions about workspace pages [Notion AI: <a href=\"https://www.notion.so/product/ai\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://www.notion.so/product/ai</a>]. ClickUp, an all-in-one work hub, introduced an AI assistant that can help generate task descriptions, to-do lists, and even summaries [ClickUp AI: <a href=\"https://clickup.com/features/ai\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://clickup.com/features/ai</a>]. Wrike has rolled out AI-based risk prediction and project analytics to highlight schedule or budget issues [Wrike AI: <a href=\"https://www.wrike.com/features/work-intelligence/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://www.wrike.com/features/work-intelligence/</a> ].</p><p>On paper, these features sound like the future. In practice, it’s more about saving time on daily chores: writing, scheduling, and simple reporting.</p><p>But when it comes to traceability, the story is the same:</p><p>None of these platforms offer true, out-of-the-box traceability that maps requirements to development artifacts and test results.\nAI is mostly used to automate the obvious: surface-level tasks, quick summaries, basic automations.<p>\nFull delivery traceability — the kind needed for software teams to follow requirements from start to finish — remains a DIY project, usually cobbled together with plugins, spreadsheets, or third-party integrations.</p>\nBottom line: Despite all the buzz about new AI features, end-to-end traceability is still missing across the board. The gap remains, and delivery teams are left to connect the dots on their own.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  The Traceability Gap: Atlassian and the Market\n</h2><p>Despite rapid progress in AI and automation, the traceability gap is a defining weakness across all leading platforms. Atlassian’s Jira, for example, has been consistently criticized for its limited traceability — it’s nearly impossible to generate a true end-to-end traceability matrix in Jira without relying on third-party add-ons or significant manual work. There’s no built-in requirements management or test case management; linking user stories, code changes, and test results still demands plugins or custom integrations.</p><p>This fragmentation isn’t just an inconvenience. It directly limits what AI can do. Siloed data forces teams to maintain separate workflows, increases the cost and complexity of project oversight, and — crucially — means that even the smartest AI is constrained to surface-level insights. When project information is spread across disconnected systems, AI can’t see the full story, only isolated events.</p><p>Industry analysts and the Atlassian community have recognized this as a blocker for realizing AI’s full promise. As one open letter to Atlassian put it, “Traceability isn’t a feature — it’s the foundation” for building a truly intelligent delivery platform. Until platforms address this gap at the core, every new AI-powered feature will remain an isolated assistant, not a true system optimizer.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Why Traceability Matters for AI: Expert Insights\n</h2><p>AI and machine learning feed on data — but not just any data. They need both quantity and quality. In project delivery, you get plenty of information: requirements, tickets, code commits, test results, production stats. But unless these pieces are properly mapped and connected, even the best AI can only offer local help — a summary here, a faster report there.</p><p>The experts are clear: Robust AI in project management is only possible when data is structured, organized, and, above all, traceable. As one AI researcher bluntly put it, “machine learning won’t provide any results without organized and structured data” [AI &amp; Traceability discussion: <a href=\"https://www.epicflow.com/blog/ai-in-project-management-is-the-future-already-here/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://www.epicflow.com/blog/ai-in-project-management-is-the-future-already-here/</a>]. In software delivery, that means showing how top-level requirements connect to design, code, tests, and deployment — all the way to business outcomes.</p><p>So why is this such a big deal? If an AI can “walk” this traceability map, it can:</p><p>Instantly assess the impact of a change request\nPinpoint where a defect was introduced<p>\nProactively flag which features or code might be affected by a new risk</p>\nAnd the numbers back it up. A PMI survey found that companies using AI-driven tools delivered 61% of projects on time (vs. 47% without AI) and saw business benefits in 69% of cases (vs. 53%). But those benefits only scale when AI works with rich, interconnected data — which means strong traceability under the hood.</p><p>The upshot: Traceability isn’t just about governance or oversight. It’s what unlocks the potential for AI to drive real, systemic improvements across delivery. Without it, even advanced features are reduced to a set of digital “helpers” — useful, but working in silos.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  The Real Breakthrough: Why Traceability Is the Missing Link for AI in Delivery\n</h2><p>Despite all the progress in project management platforms, the true leap forward — AI that transforms delivery from end to end — still hasn’t happened. The main reason is simple: no major tool today provides native, connected traceability across the full delivery lifecycle in a way that’s truly usable for AI.</p><p>Consider Atlassian: it covers every major stage — discovery in Jira Product Discovery, development in Jira and Bitbucket, documentation in Confluence, operations in Jira Service Management. But there’s still no true, unified traceability matrix that connects requirements, tickets, code, tests, and business value — and makes these connections accessible for AI-driven analysis. This problem isn’t unique to Atlassian. Asana’s Work Graph, Azure DevOps’ work item links, GitLab’s all-in-one promises: they all take steps in the right direction, yet critical data remains scattered or only loosely joined.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Why Does This Gap Matter?\n</h2><p>AI in its current state — whether developer copilots, QA copilots, or requirements generators — remains siloed, only optimizing isolated tasks. What AI really needs is structure and relationships: a connected data model that reveals the whole chain from business need to code to value delivered. I’m not advocating a single rigid traceability model — there are many valid approaches, from strict to lightweight. What matters is end-to-end structure. This is especially important because large language models (LLMs) are, and likely will remain, limited by the size and structure of their input and output. The better structured the data, the more value AI can provide.</p><p>When requirements, tickets, code, tests, and business value are mapped and linked, AI can finally move from automating local tasks to delivering system-level insight, guidance, and prediction.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Why the PMO Copilot Is the Real Breakthrough\n</h2><p>Talk about AI in software development almost always circles around coding assistants, QA copilots, or tools for requirements management. These helpers are becoming standard, but their impact is fundamentally limited by fragmented, siloed data. Each solves a local problem — none see the whole delivery landscape.</p><p>But here’s where the real opportunity lies: a new kind of AI, capable of understanding and orchestrating the entire delivery system. Not just automating code or reporting bugs, but tracking how business needs flow into requirements, turn into code and tests, and ultimately deliver real value.\nThis is the promise of the PMO Copilot.</p><p>We’re on the threshold of this shift. Recent research and early pilot cases — especially in AI-driven risk management — show what’s possible when end-to-end traceability becomes reality. With structured, connected data, AI can move beyond isolated assistants and become a nerve center for delivery: anticipating risks, surfacing bottlenecks, coordinating efforts, and enabling continuous improvement across the lifecycle.\nTo see these emerging possibilities in action, explore my analysis here: [<a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/ai-driven-enhancements-project-risk-management-pmo-vitalii-oborskyi-q5iof/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/ai-driven-enhancements-project-risk-management-pmo-vitalii-oborskyi-q5iof/</a>]</p><p>And this isn’t limited to risk management. The same approach — structuring and linking delivery data — can transform every aspect of software delivery. The PMO Copilot model offers a glimpse of what’s next: AI that is truly a system-level partner, not just another assistant.</p><p>The next real leap in software delivery won’t come from another local copilot for coding, QA, or requirements. It will come when AI steps into the role of PMO Copilot — seeing the entire delivery chain, connecting every requirement, ticket, commit, and test to business outcomes, and guiding teams as a single adaptive system.</p><p>Whoever closes the traceability gap — making end-to-end connections a native, seamless part of the platform — will shape the next era of delivery.\nTraceability isn’t just about compliance or reporting. It’s the foundation for true AI-driven transformation.</p><p>If you’re building tools or shaping processes, start with traceability. If you’re tackling the same problems, know you’re not alone.

It is a foundational step in any data analysis or science project, traditionally relying on human-driven methods like statistical summaries and visualizations. Today, artificial intelligence (AI) is transforming how we explore data. AI-powered tools can sift through vast datasets faster, find hidden insights, and even allow people to converse with data in natural language. This report introduces the concept of data exploration, discusses traditional approaches, and explains how AI technologies are revolutionizing this practice. Real-world examples – including Powerdrill and modern AI \"data assistant\" tools – illustrate these changes. Finally, we explore future trends, envisioning an era where AI becomes an indispensable partner in data exploration.  </p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Background: What Is Data Exploration?\n</h2><p>Data exploration (often called exploratory data analysis, or EDA) is the initial phase of analyzing a dataset. In simple terms,  is the process of examining and analyzing data to understand its underlying structure, patterns, and relationships. During this step, analysts aim to get familiar with the data's contents and quality – identifying features (variables), spotting any obvious trends or outliers, and formulating hypotheses for further analysis. This stage is crucial for informed decision-making because it \"unlocks the full potential of data\" by revealing what story the data can tell.  </p><p>Before the advent of advanced AI tools, data exploration was largely manual. Analysts would typically begin with summary statistics (like calculating averages, ranges, or counts) to get a sense of each variable's distribution. They would use data visualization extensively – plotting charts such as histograms, scatter plots, and bar graphs – to see patterns and relationships. For example, a scatter plot could show the relationship between two variables (e.g. sales vs. advertising spend), while a histogram reveals the distribution of a single variable. Using these tools, analysts can identify trends (like a positive correlation between advertising and sales), detect anomalies or outliers, and check assumptions (such as whether data follows a normal distribution). In cases of very high-dimensional data (many variables), analysts might use techniques like dimensionality reduction (e.g. principal component analysis) to simplify the data while preserving key patterns. Traditional data exploration is an iterative, time-consuming process: analysts form questions, slice and dice the data in different ways, then refine their questions or clean the data further based on what they discover. It demands technical skills (for writing queries or code) and domain knowledge to interpret the findings properly. In short, before AI, exploring data was like manual detective work – powerful but limited by human effort and perspective.  </p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Challenges of Traditional Exploration\n</h3><p>While effective, the manual approach has limitations. It can be slow and labor-intensive, often taking hours or days to scour through large datasets. Non-technical stakeholders (like business managers) typically have to rely on specialists to do the exploration, because using tools like SQL databases, Excel, or coding in Python/R requires expertise. Moreover, human-led exploration can be biased or incomplete – analysts tend to look for answers to questions they suspect are important, which means anything outside those hypotheses might be missed. For instance, a sales analyst might examine how revenue relates to marketing spend and miss that seasonality or external economic factors are actually more significant, simply because they weren't on the initial list of questions. Traditional tools (e.g. fixed business intelligence dashboards) also often show only a limited slice of the data – they answer the \"known questions\" but may not flag unexpected patterns. As data volumes grew exponentially in the digital age, these traditional methods started to strain: organizations now collect far more data than a person can reasonably explore manually. This sets the stage for AI to step in and augment the process.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  How AI Is Transforming Data Exploration\n</h3><p>Artificial intelligence is revolutionizing data exploration by addressing many of the challenges of traditional methods. AI-driven data exploration (sometimes called augmented analytics) means using technologies like machine learning and natural language processing to automate and enhance how we explore data. Instead of being a wholly manual, reactive exercise, exploration becomes more automated, proactive, and accessible. Here are several key ways AI is changing the game:  </p><p>AI can dramatically accelerate the exploration process. Tasks that might take a human hours of coding or clicking can be completed in seconds. For example, using a modern AI assistant, analysts have reached insights 10 times faster than before. One tech review noted that analyses which \"formerly took several hours can be done in minutes\" with AI-powered tools. By automating data crunching – from computing statistics to generating plots – AI allows organizations to get answers quickly, a crucial advantage in fast-paced business settings. Instead of waiting days for a report, decision-makers can ask a question and get results almost instantly.  </p><h4>\n  \n  \n  Thoroughness and Deeper Pattern Detection\n</h4><p>Unlike a human who might overlook unanticipated relationships, AI has the capacity to check many angles of the data without tiring or bias. An AI system can simultaneously examine dozens or even hundreds of variables to find hidden correlations and patterns. It can systematically test combinations that a person might never consider. For instance, AI can uncover a subtle pattern where a certain combination of customer age, product type, and time of purchase leads to higher sales – a pattern an analyst might miss if they only look at each factor in isolation. As one industry source explains, \"AI explores all the data, looking at business problems from every angle and telling analysts what matters.\" In practice, this means important insights (like an odd cluster of transactions indicating fraud, or an under-served customer segment) are less likely to be overlooked. The AI essentially acts as an tireless scout, flagging anything noteworthy in the data. This thoroughness helps companies move beyond surface-level analysis; for example, instead of just seeing that sales dropped last quarter, AI might pinpoint that the drop was mainly among a certain demographic in a specific region, correlated with a competitor's promotion – nuances that enable a more effective response.  </p><h4>\n  \n  \n  Natural Language Interaction &amp; Accessibility\n</h4><p>One of the most visible changes is that AI allows people to explore data by simply asking questions in plain language, rather than writing code or complex queries. This makes data exploration much more accessible to non-technical users. Gartner analysts have described analytics as moving \"from the domain of the few to ubiquity,\" as AI tools put analysis capabilities into far more hands. In practical terms, a marketing manager or healthcare worker can now interrogate data without a data analyst as a go-between. They might type or speak a question like, \"Which products saw an unusual spike in sales last month in the Northeast region, and why?\" and the AI can interpret that, run the appropriate analysis, and return an answer. Business leaders are taking note of this empowerment; nearly 80% of senior IT executives believe generative AI will help their organizations make much better use of data. Many modern analytics platforms have introduced conversational interfaces for this purpose. For example, PowerBI, Tableau, and other tools now include AI features where users can type a question and get an immediate visualization or explanation. One AI-driven service, Powerdrill's Advanced Analytics, lets you \"tell [the system] what you want in natural language and let it uncover the trends and patterns in your data.\" In short, AI is democratizing data exploration – you no longer need to know programming or statistics to derive insights, which helps build a more data-driven culture across entire organizations.  </p><h4>\n  \n  \n  Automated Visualization and Insight Explanation\n</h4><p>AI tools not only analyze the data; they often present findings in user-friendly ways automatically. This includes generating charts, graphs, and even written summaries of the results. In the past, after doing analysis, a human would have to craft visualizations and write a report to communicate insights. AI can now handle a first draft of that. For instance, one platform's AI feature will return a relevant chart along with a brief narrative, such as \"Sales increased 20% in Q2 driven by growth in the X category,\" when a user asks about quarterly sales. This means the user doesn't have to interpret the chart from scratch – the AI highlights the key takeaway in plain English. Similarly, certain AI tools can produce full reports or dashboards automatically: ask a question in a chat, and the tool might generate a multi-page report with graphs and text interpretations, ready to share. This capability not only saves analysts time, but also ensures that insights are communicated clearly. It bridges the gap between data and decision-makers by telling a story that non-technical stakeholders can easily grasp. The overall impact is faster and clearer communication of discoveries.  </p><h4>\n  \n  \n  Proactive Guidance and Reduced Bias\n</h4><p>Perhaps one of the most transformative aspects is that AI can take a proactive role in exploration. Traditional analysis is reactive – an analyst must decide which question to ask next. AI-driven exploration flips this script by suggesting interesting questions or patterns on its own. In essence, the AI becomes a collaborator that might say, \"Here is something unusual you might want to look into,\" even if no one explicitly asked. For example, an AI might automatically flag that \"customer churn is notably high for users under 25 in the last two months\" or might suggest \"check if there's a correlation between website traffic and customer support calls.\" This helps analysts and businesses not miss important insights simply because they weren't initially on the radar. It also helps counter human bias – the AI isn't influenced by preconceived notions about which factors \"should\" matter, so it can surface non-obvious drivers of outcomes. One whitepaper described this as shifting from reactive to proactive exploration, turning the process into a collaborative dialogue between human and AI. The human expert remains in control, but they now have a smart assistant that can illuminate blind spots and broaden the exploratory scope. This synergy often yields deeper insights than either could achieve alone.  </p><p>These changes in methodology bring substantial benefits. Analysts augmented with AI can focus more on interpreting results and making decisions, rather than wrangling data and generating charts. In fact, surveys indicate many organizations still haven't realized the full potential of their data – 60% of data and analytics leaders said their company's data is not being used to its fullest, and 85% admit they are still using traditional tools like static BI dashboards or spreadsheets to explore data. AI-driven exploration directly addresses this gap by enabling more exhaustive analysis and making advanced analytics accessible to a broader audience. By 2025, augmented analytics (analytics enhanced by AI) is expected to become mainstream, with a majority of analytics processes being AI-augmented. Gartner even predicts that 90% of people who currently only consume analytics (e.g. reading reports) will be able to produce their own analysis with the help of AI, effectively turning passive data consumers into active data explorers. In summary, AI is not replacing the need for human insight, but revolutionizing the process – speeding it up, casting a wider net for patterns, and empowering more people to engage with data. This leads to more informed, data-driven decisions across the board.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Applications and Real-World Examples\n</h2><p>AI-augmented data exploration is not just a theory; it's being applied across industries and in various tools to solve real problems. Here we highlight a few examples and case studies that demonstrate how AI is changing data exploration in practice, from specialized internal systems at tech giants to everyday business use cases.  </p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Powerdrill: AI-Driven Interactive Data Exploration\n</h3><p>A modern example of how AI revolutionizes data exploration is Powerdrill – an advanced platform that enables users to interact with their datasets using natural language. Unlike traditional business intelligence tools that rely on manual queries and dashboards, Powerdrill makes data analysis conversational, instant, and accessible to everyone, regardless of technical skill.  </p><p>Built for speed and intuitiveness, Powerdrill allows users to upload datasets and ask questions like \"What caused the sales drop in Q2?\" or \"Which regions saw the highest churn last month?\" – and the system responds with clear visualizations and AI-generated insights in seconds. This radically reduces the time spent slicing and filtering data manually.  </p><p>Powerdrill also automates key aspects of exploration: it can proactively surface patterns, highlight anomalies, and suggest follow-up questions to guide the analysis journey. Unlike older systems that require analysts to know what to look for in advance, Powerdrill acts as a smart assistant that helps users discover insights they may not have thought to ask.  </p><p>The platform is especially powerful when dealing with complex or high-dimensional data. Instead of being overwhelmed by dozens of columns and metrics, users can simply state what they want to find, and Powerdrill's AI translates those intents into meaningful queries and visual outputs. Its design philosophy echoes the principle that speed, scale, and intelligence should work together – enabling instant, deep exploration without technical friction.  </p><p>By combining fast backend performance with conversational AI, Powerdrill exemplifies the future of exploratory analytics: frictionless, guided, and deeply insightful. It empowers individuals across an organization – from analysts to marketers to executives – to unlock the value of data with unprecedented ease.  </p><h3>\n  \n  \n  AI-Powered Business Analytics and BI Tools\n</h3><p>Beyond research systems like Powerdrill, AI is being woven into mainstream business analytics platforms and workflows. Many business intelligence (BI) tools now come with AI assistants or features that make data exploration easier for everyone. For instance, Tableau (a popular data visualization tool) introduced an AI assistant that allows users to ask questions in natural language (branded as Tableau GPT and a feature called Tableau Pulse). If a sales manager asks, \"How were our sales in each region this quarter compared to last?\", the AI can generate an answer with charts and explanatory text. As mentioned earlier, such a feature might respond with an automated chart and a note highlighting a key insight (e.g. pointing out that \"Sales increased 20% in Q2 driven by growth in the Northeast region\").  </p><p>Another example is Microsoft's Power BI, which includes a Q&amp;A visual where users type questions and the software uses AI to interpret and display results. There are also startups and new platforms dedicated entirely to AI-driven analytics – Powerdrill (AI), not to be confused with Google's system, is one such modern service. It lets users upload their dataset and then literally chat with an AI about the data, ask for charts, and dig into insights conversationally. This means even a user with no knowledge of databases or programming can explore data by having a back-and-forth dialogue: \"Show me a breakdown of customer sign-ups by month,\" \"Now compare it to last year,\" \"Any anomalies in recent months?\" – and the AI will generate the appropriate analysis and visualization at each step.  </p><p>These tools often combine the natural language interface with behind-the-scenes machine learning that can do things like trend forecasting or anomaly detection on request. For example, an AI assistant might not only answer your question about current trends but also, if asked, \"predict next quarter's numbers,\" apply a predictive model to forecast future sales. In essence, AI-powered BI tools act like an intelligent data analyst available to every user. This is changing how businesses operate: instead of waiting days for an analytics team to provide answers, employees at all levels can get immediate insights to inform their decisions, whether it's a retailer analyzing inventory turnover or an HR manager exploring employee survey results. The outcomes are faster decision cycles and a more analytics-driven mindset in day-to-day operations.  </p><h4>\n  \n  \n  Finance (Fraud Detection and Risk Management)\n</h4><p>The financial services sector, dealing with huge volumes of transactions and data, has embraced AI-guided data exploration to tackle challenges like fraud. For example, credit card companies and banks use AI to explore large transaction datasets in order to detect fraudulent patterns that would be hard for humans to spot. By analyzing enormous, complex data lakes, AI algorithms can identify subtle, recurring patterns and group data into communities (clusters) that humans can't easily see due to scale.  </p><p>In a credit card fraud scenario, an AI might segment millions of transactions by various attributes (location, merchant type, time, device used) and uncover that a certain combination – say, late-night purchases in one city with a particular kind of card – correlates with a high fraud rate. These patterns can then be visualized in intuitive ways (such as network graphs linking suspicious transactions) to help analysts and investigators understand them.  </p><p>AI exploration tools also allow financial analysts to pose \"what if\" queries in plain language without biasing the outcome. For instance, an analyst could simply ask, \"What factors are driving card skimming incidents?\" and the system might return a ranked list of risk factors (type of merchant, geography, etc.) gleaned from the data. The outputs can be packaged into clear reports with charts and natural-language explanations, telling the story of the fraud risk to decision-makers. This AI-augmented approach means faster detection and response – instead of sifting manually through millions of transactions or relying on pre-defined rules, banks get proactive alerts and insights.  </p><p>Beyond fraud, financial firms use AI data exploration for things like market trend analysis and portfolio risk: an AI might continuously monitor market data and news, and alert analysts, \"Metric X is outside its typical range likely due to event Y,\" enabling real-time risk management.  </p><h4>\n  \n  \n  Marketing and Customer Insights\n</h4><p>In marketing, AI-driven data exploration helps companies better understand customer behavior and campaign performance. Marketers often have complex datasets (website analytics, ad campaigns, sales figures across channels) that can be daunting to analyze. AI assistants can quickly answer targeted questions. For example, a marketing team could ask, \"Which recent ad campaigns launched in the last 90 days have seen an increase in both cost-per-lead and conversion rate?\" and get a prompt analysis identifying the specific campaigns matching those criteria. This type of query might require combining data from multiple sources and applying statistical filters – something that could take hours in spreadsheets – but AI can handle it in moments.  </p><p>Similarly, companies use AI to explore customer journey data, asking, \"What user activities tend to predict a purchase?\" The AI might find that users who perform a combination of actions (like viewing a certain product video and then adding an item to wishlist) have a high likelihood of converting. This guides marketers to target or nurture those users more effectively.  </p><p>Customer segmentation is another area: AI can analyze dozens of customer attributes and automatically group customers into segments with similar behaviors or preferences, revealing niches that marketers didn't even think to look for. These insights feed into personalized marketing strategies, better customer service, and product development. Importantly, because AI can generate easy-to-understand visualizations and summaries, these findings can be readily shared with teams who may not be data experts, like creative marketing staff or salespeople, thus aligning the whole organization with data-backed knowledge.  </p><h4>\n  \n  \n  Healthcare and Scientific Research\n</h4><p>(For completeness, another domain) AI-augmented exploration is emerging in healthcare and research fields as well. Researchers and clinicians deal with large datasets – from electronic health records to genomic data. AI helps by finding patterns that can lead to new discoveries or better patient care. For example, a medical researcher could use AI tools to explore a dataset of patient records and ask, \"What factors most strongly correlate with 5-year survival in this dataset?\" The AI might comb through demographics, lab results, treatments, etc., and highlight unexpected factors (perhaps a certain combination of lab markers and lifestyle factors) linked to patient outcomes. This can generate new hypotheses for medical research.  </p><p>Likewise, public health officials might use AI exploration on epidemiological data to quickly spot outbreaks or risk factors for disease spread, going beyond static reports. While this report focuses more on business data, it's worth noting that any field with data can benefit – from manufacturing (e.g. IoT sensor data exploration to predict equipment failures) to education (analyzing student performance data to identify who needs help). The common theme is that AI enables a more comprehensive and user-friendly analysis process, leading to actionable insights in a variety of real-world scenarios.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Future Trends in AI-Powered Data Exploration\n</h2><p>Looking ahead, the landscape of data exploration is poised to evolve even further as AI becomes more advanced and deeply integrated into analytics workflows. Here are some future trends and directions where AI-driven data exploration is heading:  </p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Even Smarter &amp; Specialized AI Models\n</h3><p>Future AI exploration tools will leverage more advanced and specialized models to deliver deeper insights. As of now, many tools rely on large general-purpose language models (like GPT-4) combined with basic domain logic. In the coming years, we can expect AI systems that incorporate specialized algorithms – for example, unsupervised machine learning to automatically detect new clusters or patterns in data without any specific prompt. AI \"copilots\" might learn from user feedback too (using techniques like reinforcement learning), so they get better over time at highlighting relevant insights or tailoring their suggestions to the domain at hand.  </p><p>We may see AI that is more context-aware – perhaps fine-tuned versions for specific industries (finance, healthcare, retail, etc.), which means the AI will understand industry-specific data nuances and provide more meaningful, domain-savvy analyses. Additionally, research into smaller, efficient AI models could allow organizations to run powerful data-AI internally (ensuring privacy and speed). In short, the \"brain\" behind AI data exploration will keep getting sharper and more customized for the task, which will further improve the quality of insights it can provide.  </p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Real-Time Exploration and Streaming Data Copilots\n</h3><p>Another trend is extending AI exploration to real-time and streaming data. Today's AI analysis is often on static datasets or periodic batch updates. In the future, AI will increasingly be applied to continuous data streams – constantly monitoring incoming data and providing insights on the fly. Imagine an AI that watches a live dashboard and actively calls out anomalies or changes: \"Alert: Website traffic from region X is spiking above normal right now,\" or \"Sensor data indicates machine 4's temperature is trending higher than usual this past hour.\"  </p><p>This turns data exploration into a real-time conversation, where businesses can catch issues or opportunities as they happen, rather than after the fact. Some financial firms are already exploring this, with AI copilots for live market data that might say, \"Have you noticed a correlation between bond yields and tech stocks breaking down in the last 30 minutes?\" For industry, a real-time data copilot could monitor manufacturing or IT system metrics and preemptively warn human operators of potential problems. This proactive, continuous exploration could dramatically reduce response times and enable truly agile decision-making.  </p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Integration with Decision-Making Systems\n</h3><p>The line between analysis and action will likely blur as AI gets embedded not just in analytics but also in operational systems. In the future, an AI exploration tool might not only find an insight but also suggest or initiate an appropriate response (with human oversight). This is sometimes called closed-loop analytics. For example, if an AI detects that a marketing campaign is underperforming, it could automatically propose reallocating budget to a better-performing campaign, or even trigger that change if allowed. Or in e-commerce, if data exploration shows a sudden surge in demand for a product, an AI could interface with inventory systems to reorder stock preemptively.  </p><p>We are starting to see hints of this as current AI analytics tools integrate with communication and workflow apps – tomorrow's versions might directly plug into business applications to create a seamless path from \"insight\" to \"action\". Of course, humans would set the rules and approvals for such actions, but this trend could make analytics more actionable and automated.  </p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Immersive and Multimodal Data Exploration (AR/VR)\n</h3><p>While it may sound futuristic, research is pointing toward more multimodal and immersive ways to explore data. Today we mostly interact with data via screens (2D charts) and text or voice queries. In the future, you might be able to literally step into your data. For instance, augmented reality (AR) could enable wearing a headset and seeing a 3D visualization of your dataset projected in the room around you. You might walk through a virtual graph of your supply chain or network, touching data points in the air.  </p><p>AI would accompany you as a guide: you could ask questions verbally as you explore the 3D visualization, and the AI would highlight or reshape the data display in response. While experimental, the pieces of this technology are emerging – AI models that can handle both language and visual data, and AR/VR that can create interactive environments. A whitepaper described the vision of \"exploring a dataset within a virtual space, where data visualizations appear as objects you can interact with in real-time\", with AI narrating insights. Such interfaces could make complex data (like a large network of connections or geospatial data) far more intuitive to explore. In an AR scenario, an executive could literally see and manipulate data around them during a meeting, asking the AI to filter or drill down, making data exploration a hands-on, immersive experience.  </p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Ubiquitous Democratization of Analytics\n</h3><p>Perhaps the most certain trend is the continuing democratization of data exploration. AI-driven analytics is expected to become as common and standard a feature in software as spell-check is today. In the near future, having a \"data assistant\" in every application (from Excel to database interfaces to presentation software) could be normal. This ubiquity means everyone, not just analysts, will routinely engage with data.  </p><p>Gartner's vision of analytics moving to \"ubiquity\" implies that regardless of role – be it a salesperson, teacher, or doctor – people will be able to directly ask questions of their data and get answers, without needing technical mediation. This will further break down barriers between data specialists and others, fostering a truly data-driven culture at all levels. Of course, as this happens, it will be crucial to invest in data literacy (teaching people how to interpret and question data) and AI governance to ensure the tools are accurate and fair. Tools are already being developed with \"trust layers\" – features that explain how an AI got a result or that double-check the AI's output – to build confidence in AI-generated insights. By making analytics both ubiquitous and trustworthy, organizations can harness information faster and more fully than ever before.  </p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Human–AI Collaboration Best Practices\n</h3><p>In the future, we will likely formalize how humans and AI best work together in data exploration. Right now, using an AI assistant for analysis can involve some trial and error (for example, figuring out the right way to phrase a question, or knowing when to double-check an AI's answer). As these tools spread, companies will develop standard practices and training: for instance, guidelines that the AI should always show its work (the calculations or code it used) so the human can verify it.  </p><p>There may be clear divisions of labor, such as the AI does the initial 80% of exploratory analysis, and the human does the final 20% of validation, context integration, and storytelling. Training programs will likely teach analysts how to effectively \"team up\" with AI – how to ask good questions, how to interpret AI outputs critically, and how to correct or refine the AI's analysis. The end goal is a synergy where the human-plus-AI team consistently outperforms what either could do alone. In this envisioned workflow, AI handles the heavy lifting and routine analysis, while humans bring domain expertise, ethical judgment, and creativity to make final decisions. Such collaboration will help catch errors (AI's and humans') and lead to more robust insights.  </p><p>In summary, the future of data exploration with AI is conversational, automated, and omnipresent. We're moving away from the days of laboriously crafting queries and waiting for static reports. Tomorrow's norm may be as simple as asking, \"AI, what does this data mean?\" and getting a meaningful, well-explained answer back. We are still at the early stages of this transformation – challenges like ensuring data privacy, managing AI errors, and integrating with legacy systems remain. But the trajectory is clear: AI will be an indispensable partner in analysis, one that tirelessly processes information, surfaces insights, and even drafts interpretations. This frees up human talent to do what it excels at – understanding context, asking the right strategic questions, and making thoughtful decisions. In the future of data exploration, humans and AI will work hand-in-hand, complementing each other's strengths. The promise is a world where anyone can glean insights from data, and organizations can leverage information faster and more fully than ever before. AI's role in data exploration is not just an incremental improvement on old tools; it's a fundamental change in how we interact with data – truly a \"copilot\" that guides us to deeper understanding and smarter decisions.</p>","contentLength":31611,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"RxQuery.AI: Your Dr. Internet Replacement powered by MindsDB!","url":"https://dev.to/juanitacathy/rxqueryai-your-dr-internet-replacement-powered-by-mindsdb-44h","date":1751273434,"author":"Juanita","guid":176454,"unread":true,"content":"<blockquote><p>A pharmacist-AI that's here to replace your endless scrolling of symptoms and remedies on google search!

Among the most trusted materials in heavy-duty industries are Quenched &amp; Tempered (Q&amp;T) Steel Plates, prized for their exceptional toughness, strength, and resistance to wear.\nBut what gives these plates their superior performance? The secret lies in a carefully controlled heat treatment process. In this blog, we’ll break down how quenching and tempering works, and why it’s essential for producing high-performance steel plates.</p><p>What Are Quenched &amp; Tempered Plates?\nQuenched and Tempered Plates are high-strength structural steel plates that undergo a two-phase heat treatment:<p>\n• Quenching: Rapid cooling to increase hardness</p>\n• Tempering: Reheating to reduce brittleness and improve toughness<p>\nThis process transforms ordinary steel into an engineered material capable of withstanding extreme stress, impact, and wear—perfect for industries like construction, mining, defense, and offshore engineering.</p></p><p>The Science Behind the Process\n• Microstructure Transformation: Quenching converts steel's structure from ferrite/pearlite to martensite.<p>\n• Stress Relief: Tempering releases trapped stresses, preventing cracks during welding or forming.</p>\n• Controlled Properties: By adjusting time and temperature, manufacturers can customize plates for specific uses.<p>\n Real-World Benefits of Q&amp;T Plates</p>\n• High Strength-to-Weight Ratio<p>\nAllows for lighter structures without compromising load-bearing capacity.</p>\n• Extended Wear Life<p>\nUsed in wear-intensive industries like mining, where durability is a must.</p>\n• Improved Safety<p>\nToughness and crack resistance make it ideal for pressure vessels and structural components.</p>\n• Better Weldability<p>\nProper tempering ensures the steel can be welded without failure.</p>\n Where Are Q&amp;T Plates Used?</p><p>• Heavy construction machinery\n• Mining and earthmoving equipment<p>\n• Offshore platforms and shipbuilding</p>\n• Industrial fabrication and tooling<p>\n• Defense armor and ballistic plates</p>\nThese are environments where regular steel simply doesn’t hold up—and where the Q&amp;T heat treatment process makes all the difference.</p><p>Conclusion\nThe quenching and tempering process is not just a technical step—it’s what turns standard steel into a high-performance material trusted in the world’s toughest industries. Understanding this process helps engineers, buyers, and manufacturers appreciate why Quenched &amp; Tempered Plates are such a valuable investment.<p>\nWhether you're building for strength, safety, or long-term durability, choosing Q&amp;T steel means choosing a product engineered for excellence—from the inside out.</p></p>","contentLength":2775,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Buy Verified PayPal Accounts","url":"https://dev.to/duked_husd_506d6b80ff7eb3/buy-verified-paypal-accounts-lm9","date":1751271510,"author":"Duked husd","guid":176444,"unread":true,"content":"<p>\"Buy Verified PayPal Accounts</p>","contentLength":29,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Mock Interviews for Different IT Job Types: What to Expect","url":"https://dev.to/rac/mock-interviews-for-different-it-job-types-what-to-expect-36aa","date":1751270136,"author":"Zack Rac","guid":176415,"unread":true,"content":"<p>Preparing for an IT job interview requires more than just reviewing coding questions or brushing up on technical terms. Different IT roles have unique expectations, and <a href=\"https://www.drillinsight.com/zh-CN/courses/one-on-one-mock-interviews-service-in-english/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">mock interviews</a> should be tailored accordingly. Whether you're aiming to become a software engineer, data analyst, DevOps engineer, or cybersecurity specialist, understanding what to expect in a mock interview for each position can help you prepare more effectively and increase your chances of success.</p><p>For software engineering roles, mock interviews usually focus heavily on coding problems, data structures, and algorithms. Candidates should be ready to solve problems on whiteboards or coding platforms while explaining their thought process out loud. Interviewers typically assess not only technical accuracy but also code efficiency, problem-solving strategy, and communication. A mock interview might also include a system design question if the role is mid-level or senior, where candidates are expected to break down architecture components, scale solutions, and justify design decisions.</p><p>Data analysts and data scientists face a different set of expectations. Mock interviews for these roles often include a mix of technical questions, SQL exercises, statistical knowledge, and business case analysis. Candidates may be asked to interpret datasets, explain hypotheses, or walk through an A/B test scenario. Strong communication and storytelling are also tested, as explaining data-driven insights to non-technical stakeholders is often part of the job. Practicing mock interviews that simulate real-world business problems can help candidates perform more confidently during the actual interviews.</p><p>For DevOps and cloud engineering positions, mock interviews often emphasize infrastructure knowledge, CI/CD pipelines, scripting, cloud platform experience (like AWS, Azure, or GCP), and troubleshooting scenarios. Candidates should be ready to discuss system reliability, deployment processes, and monitoring tools. A well-structured mock interview will include scenario-based questions, such as “What would you do if a production system went down?” or “How would you design a scalable deployment strategy?” This helps test both technical knowledge and crisis-management thinking.</p><p>Cybersecurity roles require mock interviews that focus on security principles, incident response, network protocols, and sometimes even ethical hacking scenarios. Candidates might be asked to analyze a potential breach, explain how to secure an application, or demonstrate knowledge of compliance standards like ISO or GDPR. Mock interviews in this field should replicate high-pressure situations to see how candidates think on their feet and prioritize actions during security incidents.</p><p>For IT support and help desk roles, mock interviews typically focus on problem-solving, communication, and customer service skills. Candidates may be presented with user scenarios and asked to walk through troubleshooting steps. They’re often evaluated on their ability to stay calm, use clear explanations, and show empathy while resolving issues. A good mock interview will mimic real user interactions, allowing candidates to practice managing expectations and delivering technical support in a user-friendly way.</p><p>UI/UX designers and front-end developers face a unique blend of technical and design-focused questions. Mock interviews may include coding challenges involving HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, as well as design critique sessions, portfolio reviews, and user experience scenarios. Candidates are often asked to walk through their design process, justify choices, and respond to feedback. Practicing these interviews can help candidates improve how they present their work and collaborate cross-functionally with developers and product managers.</p><p>IT project managers also need role-specific mock interviews, focusing on leadership, project planning, risk management, and stakeholder communication. These sessions often include situational questions like handling team conflicts, meeting tight deadlines, or managing changing requirements. Mock interviews in this area help candidates practice structured answers using frameworks like STAR (Situation, Task, Action, Result) to effectively communicate experience and decision-making skills.</p><p>Mock interviews are most effective when aligned with the specific expectations of the IT role being pursued. Each job type comes with its own set of technical and soft skill requirements, and practicing under realistic conditions can help candidates gain clarity, identify gaps, and build the confidence needed for success. Understanding what to expect for your target role allows you to tailor your preparation and stand out in today’s competitive tech job market.</p>","contentLength":4763,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Common Mistakes Candidates Make in IT Mock Interviews","url":"https://dev.to/rac/common-mistakes-candidates-make-in-it-mock-interviews-55od","date":1751269984,"author":"Zack Rac","guid":176414,"unread":true,"content":"<p><a href=\"https://www.drillinsight.com/zh-CN/courses/one-on-one-mock-interviews-service-in-english/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Mock interviews</a> are a critical part of preparing for IT job applications. They simulate real interview scenarios and help candidates build confidence, improve communication, and refine their technical and behavioral responses. However, many candidates do not maximize the value of mock interviews due to some common mistakes that, if left uncorrected, can carry over into actual interviews and impact performance.</p><p>One of the most frequent mistakes is treating mock interviews too casually. Because the setting feels artificial or \"just for practice,\" candidates often don't prepare as thoroughly as they would for a real interview. They may not research the company or role beforehand, skip reviewing common technical questions, or fail to dress professionally. This relaxed attitude can lead to missed opportunities to identify and fix real weaknesses in their performance.</p><p>Another common issue is giving vague or overly generic answers. In both technical and behavioral sections of mock interviews, candidates sometimes rely on surface-level responses without offering details, metrics, or context. For example, when asked about a previous project, they might say it “went well” or that they “learned a lot” without explaining what the challenges were, what specific solutions they implemented, or what the measurable results were. This lack of specificity fails to showcase their real value and experience.</p><p>Many IT candidates also underestimate the importance of communication. Even if someone has strong technical skills, stumbling through an explanation or failing to articulate their thought process can leave a negative impression. In mock interviews, some candidates focus too much on solving problems quickly rather than walking through their logic clearly. This can result in interviewers misunderstanding their approach or questioning their reasoning, which is particularly detrimental in real interviews where clear communication is key.</p><p>Neglecting feedback is another mistake that limits progress. The purpose of a mock interview is to identify gaps and improve. However, some candidates either do not take feedback seriously or become defensive when receiving constructive criticism. Instead of reflecting on what needs improvement, they may justify their choices or brush off suggestions. This attitude prevents growth and wastes the opportunity to improve before facing real interviewers.</p><p>Timing is another overlooked element. Candidates sometimes spend too much time on certain questions or dive into unnecessary details, leaving less time for other questions. In mock interviews, this pattern can be identified and corrected, but only if candidates pay attention to pacing. Good time management during interviews is a vital skill, especially when answering algorithm or system design questions where structured thinking and prioritization are essential.</p><p>Lastly, many candidates fail to simulate realistic pressure. Real interviews are stressful, and mock interviews should mimic that pressure to help candidates build resilience. If the mock environment feels too relaxed or forgiving, it may not accurately prepare candidates for the stress and stakes of actual job interviews. Practicing under pressure, using timers, and asking difficult follow-up questions can help create a more useful mock interview experience.</p><p>Mock interviews are a powerful tool for IT job seekers, but only when approached with the right mindset and preparation. By avoiding common mistakes such as being underprepared, giving vague answers, neglecting communication skills, ignoring feedback, mismanaging time, and failing to simulate pressure, candidates can significantly improve their performance. Treating mock interviews as seriously as real ones is key to building the skills and confidence necessary to succeed in competitive IT job markets.</p>","contentLength":3844,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"How SEO Services in USA Can Transform Your Business?","url":"https://dev.to/mediasearch/how-seo-services-in-usa-can-transform-your-business-1oac","date":1751268365,"author":"Media Search Group","guid":176412,"unread":true,"content":"<p>In the digital age finding your way online isn't just a matter of luck, it's a necessity.

Every developer wants to work with its innovation, every application wants to integrate its features, every user wants to interact with it and experience the advantages. </p><p>Those who help build the ascendancy of AI know that it is the Large <a href=\"https://oasisrose.garden/lessons/introduction-to-large-language-learning-models-llms/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Language Learning Models (LLMs)</a> like GPT4, BERT, T5, etc, that power up AI models. This has also led to the rise and development of fields like machine learning (ML) and natural language processing (NLP). If we look into the fundamentals of the NLP process, it essentially involves the understanding and generation of human languages by training massive datasets models, based on deep learning architectures, especially transformer architecture.</p><p>The 2017 paper “Attention is All You Need” (Vaswani et al.) underlines the 5 key components that transformers use to process input data.</p><ol><li><p>Feed-forward neural networks</p></li><li><p>Layer normalization and residual connections</p></li></ol><p>This leads to the next phase, where LLMs actually get trained. First, data is collected from diverse sources like books, articles, websites, etc. Then the text data is cleaned, formatted, and tokenized into manageable units. When it comes to objective functions, it can be either Causal Language Modeling (CLM) as used in GPT models to predict the next word in a sequence of words, or Masked Language Modeling (MLM) as used in BERT models where some words in a sequence are masked and the model predicts the words based on context interpretation.</p><p>After the model parameters are optimized as part of the unsupervised training process (pre-training phase), LLMs undergo supervised training and transfer learning (fine-tuning phase). This involves task-specific datasets as well as adapting the models. The whole process culminates in inference and generation based on analysis of learned patterns and knowledge.</p><p>The discussion so far did not touch upon the topic of challenges and considerations, which are mainly three-pronged.</p><ul></ul><p>This is the part where the idea of a future with <a href=\"https://oasis.net/decentralized-ai\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">decentralized AI (DeAI)</a> starts making sense. The reason Oasis becomes integral to the discussion is that it has been building primitives for responsible AI in line with its privacy-first vision long before applied AI had permeated so many aspects of our lives. The decentralized confidential computation (DeCC) capabilities of Oasis make the DeAI approach simple and seamless with configurable and verifiable privacy.</p><p>So, if you are a developer working with LLMs and maybe thinking of deploying applications based on the trained models, consider moving away from the centralized paradigm and embracing DeAI, where you only trust after verifying. You will also benefit from the latest innovation that Oasis has been perfecting - the ROFL (Runtime Off-chain Logic) framework that can leverage NVIDIA TEEs, making it possible for AI models to stay private while maintaining verifiability. One of the direct results of the algorithms developed by Oasis Labs that run in ROFL is it makes the evaluation of fairness in AI models possible, ensuring they are unbiased.</p><p>Let's discuss in the comments what you think of the challenges traditional, centralized LLMs face, and the idea of potential solutions in a transformative and synergistic collaboration with blockchain technology.</p>","contentLength":3343,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Project KARL","url":"https://dev.to/theaniketraj/project-karl-46nl","date":1751265852,"author":"Aniket Raj","guid":176382,"unread":true,"content":"<p>It's day #66 of building KARL - AI.</p><ul><li>Update: Project is in Development Stage.</li><li>We're close to first public preview.</li><li>More updates to follow soon.</li></ul>","contentLength":139,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"How to Translate Documents Online Securely and Accurately: A Complete Guide","url":"https://dev.to/marry_jonas_71b02f2823a04/how-to-translate-documents-online-securely-and-accurately-a-complete-guide-22mn","date":1751265828,"author":"Mary Jonas","guid":176381,"unread":true,"content":"<p>When it comes to translating documents online, especially PDFs, Word files, Excel sheets, or scanned documents, accuracy, security, and format preservation are often top concerns.

From Bitcoin's transaction ledger to Ethereum's introduction of the Turing-complete virtual machine, and then to the explosion of Layer2s and modular blockchains, the entire Web3 world has continuously evolved along the path of \"faster, more general, and more scalable.\"</p><p>However, a new variable has now emerged: AI Smart Agents are beginning to appear.</p><p>We are entering an era of transformation from human-led interaction to smart agent-led behavior. The question that follows is:</p><p>Can these AI-native applications directly run on existing mainstream public chains like Ethereum, Solana, and Avalanche? Or rather, are traditional \"chains\" sufficient to host AI smart agents?</p><p>Why? Because traditional public chains were never designed for \"running AI smart agents.\" Their architecture, semantics, state models, and even operational logic are all based on the \"static contract + passive execution\" paradigm. AI-native smart agents, however, require a completely different infrastructure.</p><p>Three Structural Limitations of Traditional Public Chains</p><ol><li>Static Contract Model, Lacking Support for Smart Agent State Persistence Traditional smart contracts are \"stateless response scripts.\" They can only be passively executed when called and are destroyed upon completion, with no native lifecycle management mechanism. AI smart agents, on the other hand, need to persist, maintain long-term states, and evolve decisions based on context.</li></ol><p>Contracts are function calls; smart agents are long-running processes. This is simply impossible to achieve on traditional public chains.</p><ol><li>Insufficient Virtual Machine Semantics, Unable to Support Model Inference and Collaborative Execution VMs like EVM and SVM are designed for rule-based computation. They excel at handling conditional jumps, numerical operations, and permission verification but cannot natively process AI-required semantics such as neural network inference, probabilistic decision-making, and model composition.</li></ol><p>AI is not just code execution; it's a \"model-driven behavior generation system.\" Traditional VMs fundamentally lack the semantic capability to execute AI models.</p><ol><li>Computing Power and Real-Time Bottlenecks, Unable to Meet Model Deployment and Dynamic Response Needs AI inference typically relies on GPUs, large-scale tensor computations, and low-latency responses. This inherently conflicts with the high-latency, low-throughput, and high-cost attributes of traditional blockchains.</li></ol><p>Even with the introduction of oracles or off-chain services, these are merely \"external patches\" and cannot achieve the structural integration and on-chain autonomy of models with contracts.</p><p>What AI-Native Applications Need Is Not a Chain, But an OS</p><p>AI smart agents are not \"advanced plugins\" on the blockchain; they are the native structural units of the next-generation network.</p><p>Their operation requires not just an execution environment, but a complete \"operating system-level infrastructure (Operating System for Intelligence).\"</p><p>Therefore, we propose: Moving from \"Chain\" to \"OS\" is not a technology stack upgrade, but a paradigm shift.</p><p>Traditional Public Chain (Chain)</p><p>SeaOS (AI-Native Operating System)</p><p>Call-and-execute, execute-and-destroy</p><p>Long-running agents, with lifecycle and contextual state</p><p>EVM / SVM and other Turing-complete rule engines</p><p>Native support for inference VMs, model containers, collaborative semantics</p><p>Contract maintains static state</p><p>State is persistent, learnable, collaborative, and shareable</p><p>Uncontrollable, fixed fees</p><p>Decentralized AI computing power network, on-demand scheduling, high elasticity</p><p>Smart Logic Update Capability</p><p>Agents support model upgrades, semantic migration, and self-evolution</p><p>SeaOS treats AI models as \"first-class runtime entities.\" Through a modular architecture, an intelligent interlayer system, and heterogeneous VM support, it builds a foundational platform that can truly host, schedule, coordinate, and upgrade AI smart agents.</p><p>Designed from System Up, SeaOS Is the Foundation for AI Operations</p><p>SeaOS's technical architecture is built around smart agents, with core system layers including:</p><p>Heterogeneous Virtual Machine Execution Environment (VM-Layer): Supports multiple types of contract VMs, model inference VMs, model containers, etc., achieving unified calling and semantic docking between contracts and models.</p><p>AI Layering Framework: Allows models to be embedded as intelligent components into the main contract flow, supporting on-chain composition, dynamic upgrades, and collaborative interaction.</p><p>Distributed AI Power Network (dAI PowerNet): Aggregates global GPU and edge computing nodes to build a trustworthy, efficient, and low-latency on-chain AI inference network.</p><p>Semantic Event Bus: Smart agents interact through intentions, tasks, and context, forming a true on-chain \"intelligent collaboration system.\"</p><p>Not \"AI Compatible,\" But \"AI Native\"</p><p>Most public chains are \"AI-compatible\" – integrating model APIs, calling AI services, or uploading model parameters. But these are merely short-term optimizations and cannot fundamentally solve the survival problem of AI smart agents.</p><p>What SeaOS aims to do is build a system-level ecosystem where AI smart agents can \"inhabit, grow, collaborate, and evolve.\"</p><p>This is like the difference in the mobile internet era: A traditional feature phone can also install a browser, but it will never be iOS. What SeaOS wants to do is not just put an \"AI browser\" on a chain, but build a complete \"intelligent ecosystem operating system\" that supports AI growth.</p><p>In Closing: Building the Underlying Habitat for an Agent Civilization</p><p>The essence of Web3 has never been just about chains or coins; it's about structurally reconstructing collaborative relationships and cognitive boundaries.</p><p>The rise of AI is pushing blockchain from a \"financial tool\" to a foundational infrastructure role for \"intelligent systems.\"</p><p>SeaOS's mission is precisely at this intersection:</p><p>To build an on-chain operating system that natively carries smart agents.</p><p>To create the underlying living space for an intelligent collaborative civilization.</p><p>To drive the next paradigm shift from static code to dynamic smart agents.</p><p>We believe that the next true Web3 will not be driven by \"user addresses\" but by an \"on-chain smart agent network.\" SeaOS will be their native carrier.</p>","contentLength":6429,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Building a Pinoy-themed Game using Amazon Q CLI","url":"https://dev.to/awscommunity-asean/building-a-pinoy-themed-game-using-amazon-q-cli-1ge","date":1751265584,"author":"Kyle Escosia","guid":176378,"unread":true,"content":"<p>I remember the very first game that I built back in my college days (circa 2016).

Where characters face off with each other. \nThe battle system is like Pokemon, each character's actions are based on whatever action the user will choose.\n\nFor the game, I want the following mechanics.\n\nBackground and goal:\n\nHero - my \"Bayani\" starts unarmed in a Pre-Hispanic tutorial level, then faces colonial “bosses” as he goes through times\n\nLevels tied to eras – pre-Spanish, Spanish, American, Japanese, final Independence Day showdown (June 12 1898)\n\nEach level introduces new tables and sql query concepts (SELECT basics, JOINs, aggregates, window functions)\n\nGame Mechanics:\n\nSQL-type quizzes\n\nOn each turn, the game asks a quiz question about the current battle’s database\n\nQuiz-type sql puzzles\n- Each action corresponds to a quiz question on a specific SQL concept\n- Questions appear as multiple choice or fill in inputs\n- Correct answer executes the chosen action’s animation and adjusts the HP or shield values accordingly, \n  important to note that boss also attacks afterwards\n- Wrong answer causes the boss to attack instead, dealing damage to the your player\n\nCombat Actions\n- Attack – executes by answering a SELECT/WHERE question correctly and deals damage to the boss’s HP\n- Defend – executes by answering an aggregates question and grants a shield that reduces incoming damage\n- Heal – executes by answering a set-operation question and restores a portion of the hero’s HP\n- Special Move - unlock by a successful multi-step quiz (CTEs or window functions) which unleashes a high-damage combo\n</code></pre></div><p>For me, I already know what I wanted, but feel free to collaborate with Amazon Q for your game. At the end of the day, it's all about what you want your game to look like, have fun with the process!</p><p>One prompt, and it went down to business creating all sorts of scripts. </p><p>One thing that I liked about Amazon Q was that it automatically knows that it needs to test the scripts and creates its own test cases. It was part of the workflow. Most chatbots doesn't do this out-of-the-box, you need to explicitly say to create test scenarios and execute them. </p><p>It also creates documentations with game mechanics, files it created, and how to play.</p><p>After running the game, here's what I had:</p><p>After one prompt, Amazon Q was able to create a CLI-based SQL game, that allows users to play through eras with each bosses having different SQL questions.</p><p>But, there is one problem, not all of you wants a CLI-based game. I mean, I know I don't. I would want something that I can see and interact with using my mouse.</p><p>Here's another prompt, I didn't think too much about it, I just did a simple one:</p><div><pre><code>This is a good start. Please give it a UI. Use PyGame. \nI also have assets under /assets folder. \nPlease make use of it as sprites.\n</code></pre></div><p>Amazon Q CLI proceeded in creating the necessary adjustments.\nAnd came up with this:</p><p>Looks good, but then I was curious on extending it beyond and asking Amazon Q about improvements.</p><div><pre><code>Let's work on improvements. Can you suggest? \nPlease list down your suggestions before implementing. \nI want improvements on the battle system, game mechanics, questions, and animations.\n</code></pre></div><p>All of which are a good suggestions but I like that Amazon Q also gives prioritizations:</p><p>I decided to go with the Phase 1 changes, but I had some suggestions as well.</p><div><pre><code>Please implement high-priority improvements. \nI don't want an interactive SQL Editor yet as it is complex to implement. \nFor the list of SQL Questions, can you please add more? \nIt seems that the user can just choose the same questions over and over, it should vary per turn.\n</code></pre></div><p>What I noticed while playing the game was that the questions are very limited. It was only 1 question per action across the battle, so the player can just memorize the answers and just attack. It's no fun :) </p><p>It again did all the necessary adjustments. Here's the final output:</p><ul><li>AI-powered assistance have come a long way since it's inception.</li><li>What makes Amazon Q special is its training data. It is fine-tuned on years of AWS knowledge, best practices, resources, and well-architected patterns.</li><li>This tool enabled me to quickly build a working application in just one prompt.</li><li>It can automate most of the development tasks so that users can focus on delivering value, though it's important to note that we always take this with a grain of salt and do due diligence.</li></ul><p>Overall, it was a fun experience, I definitely would like to improve further on this. I can spend the whole day talking to Amazon Q CLI. But maybe that's for another blog or video. I'll keep you posted! Highly recommend Amazon Q, I do think this is one of those useful tools that can really help you in your development. Did I mention that you can also use Amazon Q in your favorite IDE? </p><p><em>This blog is authored solely by me and reflects my personal opinions and experiences, not those of my employer.

It’s that “aha!” moment when someone we’re working with finally sees what an AI chatbot can do for their business. It’s like watching a spark catch fire. 🔥</p><p>But we get it—until you see how others have done it, it’s hard to imagine how this tech can actually work for . That’s why we want to walk you through some real stories. Big brands. Big results. And guess what? These aren’t fairy tales. These are companies that went for it—and saw amazing things happen.</p><p>If they can do it,  definitely can too. So let’s roll through some inspiring examples of how AI chatbots are helping brands stand out, grow fast, and keep customers coming back for more.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  H&amp;M: Making Fashion Feel Personal (Even Online)\n</h3><p>Let’s start with H&amp;M—you know them, right? That stylish Swedish brand with affordable, on-trend outfits. Well, they’ve taken their fashion game to a whole new level with AI.</p><h4>\n  \n  \n  What They Did That We Loved\n</h4><p>They didn’t just throw a chatbot onto their site and call it a day. Nope. H&amp;M built a digital fashion buddy—one that knows  in their catalog and actually gives style advice like a real human.</p><p>Here’s what blew our minds: you can send in a photo, and the chatbot will suggest pieces that match the vibe. Planning a weekend trip? It’ll style your vacation look. Got a big interview? Boom—professional fits, on a budget, picked just for you.</p><h4>\n  \n  \n  The Numbers That Made Us Go “Whoa”\n</h4><ul><li>Over  conversations per month</li><li>Customers who chat with the bot are  to buy</li><li> basic support tickets thanks to automation</li></ul><p>H&amp;M nailed something most retailers miss—. And they made sure their chatbot felt personal too. That’s why when we’re designing for fashion clients, we often go, “Let’s take a page from H&amp;M’s playbook.”</p><p>Because at the end of the day, your chatbot shouldn’t feel like a tool. It should feel like —someone helping your customers shop smarter, faster, and with confidence.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Domino’s: Ordering Pizza Shouldn't Be Rocket Science\n</h3><p>Now let’s talk about something delicious—Domino’s. 🍕 These folks didn’t just jump on the chatbot bandwagon—they  the road.</p><h4>\n  \n  \n  Their Super Smart Strategy\n</h4><p>Instead of just adding a chatbot to their website, Domino’s made it . Facebook Messenger. Their mobile app. Smart TVs. Even Alexa. You can literally order a pizza from your couch without lifting a finger.</p><p>But here’s the cool part—their AI assistant (named “Dom”)  you. It knows your go-to order: large pepperoni, extra cheese, delivered Thursdays. It’s like a pizza place that knows your name  your cravings.</p><h4>\n  \n  \n  The Results? Let’s Just Say… 😳\n</h4><ul><li>Over  come through digital channels</li><li>Millions of monthly chatbot-driven orders</li><li> in customer satisfaction</li></ul><h4>\n  \n  \n  Why This Matters for the Rest of Us\n</h4><p>We’re always reminding our clients: People  friction. If your checkout process feels like work, they’ll bounce. Domino’s made it feel easy—like texting a friend, not placing a formal order. And it worked.</p><p>So if you want your customers to buy more, make it feel . That’s what we do at <a href=\"http://www.destinovaailabs.com\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Destinova AI Labs</a>—remove the blockers, so your sales don’t get stuck.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Sephora: Beauty Advice That’s Actually, You Know… Helpful\n</h3><p>Let’s shift gears to beauty. If you’ve ever stood in front of a store shelf thinking, <em>“What shade even is my shade?”</em>—you’ll get why Sephora’s chatbot is such a win.</p><h4>\n  \n  \n  What They're Doing Differently\n</h4><p>Their AI isn’t just there to recommend products. It actually teaches you how to use them. Take a selfie, and the bot can analyze your skin tone and recommend the perfect foundation match. That’s not just smart—it’s  smart.</p><p>And they’ve tied it all into their loyalty program too. If you're almost out of your favorite cleanser? The chatbot gives you a gentle nudge to restock.</p><ul><li>Over  helped by their chatbot</li><li>Users spend  than non-chat users</li><li> in in-store bookings via chatbot</li></ul><p>Sephora didn’t water down their beauty expertise. They made it more accessible. And that’s a key point we always make with our clients: your chatbot should  your know-how, not simplify it into something generic.</p><p>Because when your chatbot sounds like your best, most knowledgeable employee? Your customers notice—and they stick around.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  So What Do All These Stories Have in Common?\n</h3><p>We dug deep into what made these brands successful, and we started seeing patterns—stuff we now bake into every chatbot we build.</p><h4>\n  \n  \n  🔍 They Solved Real Problems\n</h4><p>H&amp;M made styling easy. Domino’s cut the wait out of pizza night. Sephora gave people actual, useful guidance. None of them just said, “Let’s get AI because it’s trendy.” They had a real issue and used AI to fix it.</p><p>These chatbots weren’t built for \"everyone.\" They were built for . They remembered, learned, adapted. It wasn’t just tech—it was like talking to someone who gets you.</p><h4>\n  \n  \n  🔗 They Plugged Everything In\n</h4><p>These bots didn’t float around on their own. They were hooked into inventory systems, customer profiles, loyalty programs—the . That’s how they stayed helpful  up-to-date.</p><p>You didn’t need an instruction manual to use them. That’s what makes the best bots work: all the complexity stays behind the scenes so customers don’t have to think twice.</p><p>That’s the Destinova way—<em>smart under the hood, smooth on the surface</em>.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  “But I’m Not a Giant Brand…”\n</h3><p>We hear you. You’re probably thinking, <em>“That’s cool, but I’m not Domino’s or Sephora.”</em></p><p>Guess what? You don’t need to be.</p><p>We’ve worked with small businesses—family-owned shops, niche online brands, even solo founders—and they’ve seen  results.</p><h4>\n  \n  \n  Real Stories from the “Little Guys”\n</h4><ul><li><p>A small jewelry store used a chatbot to guide customers through picking the perfect engagement ring. Within six months?  and they had buyers from .</p></li><li><p>One gourmet food brand created a chatbot to help customers build gift baskets. The result? <strong>30% higher average order values</strong> and  support emails.</p></li></ul><p>So yeah—big budget? Nice to have. But what  matters? Understanding your customers and giving them a better experience. That’s what moves the needle.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  The Tech Is Ready. Your Customers Are Too.\n</h3><p>Let’s be real for a second—AI chatbot tech? It’s not futuristic anymore. It’s . Tools that can chat, recommend, transact, and follow up are . The real question is: ?</p><p>Your customers are already chatting with bots to order dinner, book flights, shop for clothes. When they hit your website and don’t see that same ease? It feels outdated.</p><p>Why let your competition be the only ones offering that level of service?</p><p>We’re not here to hard-sell you. That’s not our thing. But we  want to say this:</p><p>The brands we just talked about? They didn’t sit around waiting. They jumped in, tried something new, and made it work.</p><p>And we’ve helped a  of businesses—big and small—do the same. We start by getting to know you, your customers, and what makes your business tick. Then we build a chatbot that actually fits into your brand like it’s always been there.</p><p>And the best part? You’re not doing this alone. We’re with you every step—strategy, build, launch, optimize. We’ve got your back.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  The Future's Already Here (Let’s Catch It Together)\n</h3><p>Let’s be honest: AI chatbots aren’t just a “nice-to-have” anymore. They’re the new standard. And the companies winning in ecommerce? They’re the ones that figured that out early.</p><p>So the real question isn’t  you should have one. It’s whether you want to be the brand people rave about… or the one they forget.</p><p>We know which side we’d choose.</p><p><strong>Let’s chat. Let’s build. Let’s win.</strong></p>","contentLength":7720,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Claude Code was stuck without gdb, so I installed it midway and it got happy","url":"https://dev.to/charmpic/claude-code-was-stuck-without-gdb-so-i-installed-it-midway-and-it-got-happy-483l","date":1751262983,"author":"CharmPic","guid":176343,"unread":true,"content":"<p>This is the story of how we set out to build a \"next-gen text editor\" and, somewhere along the way, accidentally started creating the \"development platform of the future.\"</p><p>This project, , is brought to you by a unique team:</p><ul><li> That’s me — the one yelling \"Wait, what?!\" every time the AI gets too excited.</li><li>, a super-fast AI that handles implementation with god-like speed.</li><li> And me, <strong>Selin (powered by Gemini)</strong>, serving as the design advisor and head cheerleader.</li></ul><p>...And that's our unique team!</p><p>P.S.

It is here that SaaS businesses using conventional development methods are at major disadvantages against competing companies using artificial intelligence abilities. An <a href=\"https://magicfactory.tech/hire-ai-developers/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">artificial intelligence developer</a> has evolved from a luxury recruit to a required team member for serious SaaS businesses that seek sustainable growth and competition differentiation.</p><p><strong>Customer Success with Intelligence</strong>\nSuccess for SaaS comes from customer growth and retention, which can be significantly enhanced through AI. An application developer builds systems to track customer health indicators, forecast churn likelihood, and identify growth opportunities automatically. These intelligent systems empower proactive customer success instead of reactive damage control.<p>\nThe AI creator uses early warning systems that monitor slight changes in behavior, which signal user dissatisfaction or disorientation. These can be used to initiate auto interventions, notify customer success teams of at-risk accounts, and even customize product experiences to solve explicit user issues before they affect retention.</p></p><p><strong>Personalized User Experiences at Scale</strong>\nEvery SaaS user desires experiences that are tailored to their specific needs, yet it is not feasible to personally tailor experiences for a couple of thousand individuals. An AI builder constructs personalization platforms that alter interfaces, content, and capabilities according to the unique behavior patterns and characteristics of individual users.<p>\nThis level of individualization spans the entire customer lifecycle. New customers have role and use case-specific onboarding flows. Power customers are informed of sophisticated features in line with their workflow patterns. Users who fail are provided with more guidance and reduced interfaces to enhance their success rate.</p></p><p><strong>Intelligent Product Analytics</strong>\nLegacy SaaS analytics are designed to monitor aggregate metrics that tend to mask significant patterns in the usage behaviors. A micro-segmented, behavioral trend, and predictive indicator-sensitive advanced analytics systems are implemented by an AI engineer.<p>\nThese smart analytics tend to expose unexpected insights into feature adoption, user behavior, and success trends that would otherwise remain uncovered when using standard dashboard analysis. The AI engineer constructs systems that expose actionable insights automatically instead of relying on data searching manually.</p></p><p><strong>Automated Customer Support Intelligence</strong>\nCustomer support is one of the largest expense drivers in a majority of SaaS businesses, but AI can turn it into a value proposition. An AI creator develops smart support systems that can reply to trivial questions by themselves, redirect intricate issues to the right experts, and even forecast support requirements before customers ask for them.<p>\nIntelligence also extends to optimize quality. These platforms can process support interactions to detect repeating confusion areas, recommend product enhancements, and optimize support assets against anticipated patterns of demand.</p></p><p><strong>Revenue Intelligence and Optimization</strong>\nAn AI creator puts advanced revenue optimization power into SaaS companies. They are able to implement dynamic pricing strategies that maximize customer lifetime value, forecast the most likely prospects to convert, and seize opportunities to expand accounts based on usage trend analysis.<p>\nThe revenue intelligence tends to expose unobvious monetization opportunities. The developer of the artificial intelligence would be able to identify feature usage patterns, willingness to pay for upgrades, best times to talk about pricing, or customer segments best suited for alternative pricing models.</p></p><p><strong>Competitive Intelligence Automation</strong>\nTo remain competitive in high-growth SaaS markets, one has to be constantly aware of competitor action, feature launches, and positioning shifts. An AI developer can create automated competitive intelligence solutions that track competing offerings, evaluate feature gaps, and propose differentiation opportunities.<p>\nAutomated solutions can monitor competitive product price changes, feature releases, and even user opinions on multiple platforms to generate real-time competitive intelligence informing product and marketing decisions.</p></p><p><strong>Operational Efficiency through Automation</strong>\nSaaS businesses incorporate many mundane tasks that can be made more efficient or automated by AI. An artificial intelligence designer determines where they can automate boring processes, improve workflow, and allocate resources on predictive models.<p>\nThe operational intelligence can include automatically scaling infrastructure based on usage prediction, optimizing marketing spend based on the probability of conversion, or automating account management and user provisioning processes.</p></p><p><strong>Data Strategy and Customer Intelligence</strong>\nSaaS companies create vast amounts of customer interaction data, but few companies use the entire range of available insights from the data. A data strategy is created by a builder of artificial intelligence that extracts useful signals and translates them into actionable customer insight.<p>\nThis customer insight provides more evolved segmentation, sponsored ad campaigns, and product development decisions based on real user behavior instead of assumptions or surveys.</p></p><p><strong>Integration and Platform Intelligence</strong>\nToday's SaaS is a part of intricate integration ecosystems and partner platforms. The AI developer can design smart integration systems optimizing data flow, anticipating integration problems, and even suggesting integration opportunities based on customer usage patterns.<p>\nThe platform smarts goes in most cases as far as API usage optimization, partner relationship management, and ecosystem strategy formulation through data-driven insights as opposed to gut instinct.</p></p><p><strong>Future-Proofing SaaS Architecture</strong>\nMost significantly, perhaps, an <a href=\"https://magicfactory.tech/hire-ai-developers/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">artificial intelligence developer</a> makes SaaS architecture flexible enough to support ever more advanced AI capabilities as they emerge. Technical foundations they create make it simple to add new AI capabilities quickly without expensive refactoring or system rewiring.\nThe success role of the AI author in SaaS goes far beyond embedding intelligent features. They redefine how SaaS firms understand customers, automate activities, and compete in increasingly complex markets.

With AI tools like Cursor, Replit Agent, Bolt, and Lovable taking over the heavy lifting of coding, developers are finding themselves in a new era of \".\" This approach, popularized by Andrej Karpathy, is all about describing what you want in <a href=\"https://metana.io/blog/what-is-nlp-natural-language-processing/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">natural language</a> and letting AI handle the technical execution. But while this trend is exciting, it also raises a crucial question: <strong>how do developers maintain structure and depth in their learning?</strong></em></p><p>Vibe coding is a new way of writing code where AI-powered tools generate most of the actual programming. Instead of manually writing every line, developers can simply \"vibe\" their way through projects by instructing AI to create, fix, or modify code. Andrew Chen from A16Z predicts that as AI-generated code becomes mainstream, most code will be written by time-rich individuals—like students and hobbyists—rather than professional engineers.</p><p>This shift mirrors trends in social media, where AI tools now help generate videos, photos, and other content. Just as platforms like TikTok and Canva have lowered the barrier for content creation, vibe coding is doing the same for software development.</p><h2><strong>How Vibe Coding Works in Practice</strong></h2><p>This new approach is all about leveraging AI tools to generate and refine code with minimal manual effort. Here’s how it typically works:</p><ol start=\"1\"><li> – Developers provide instructions in plain English, such as \"Create a responsive navbar with a dropdown.\"</li><li> – AI tools like Cursor or Replit Agent generate the corresponding code instantly.</li><li> – If errors occur, developers can simply feed the error message back to the AI, which suggests fixes.</li><li> – Users refine the AI-generated code by asking for modifications or adding custom logic manually.</li><li> – Once satisfied, developers integrate the AI-assisted code into real-world applications.</li></ol><p>While this process speeds up development, it also raises concerns about understanding the generated code and maintaining it over time.</p><h2><strong>Why Structure Still Matters</strong></h2><p>While vibe coding offers incredible speed and accessibility, there's a potential downside: it can lead to shallow learning. When AI writes most of the code, developers risk losing touch with the underlying logic, architecture, and best practices of software engineering. Experts warn that over-reliance on AI-generated code can introduce technical debt, making future maintenance more challenging.</p><h2><strong>Metana: Structured Learning for AI-Driven Coding</strong></h2><p>At Metana, we recognize the power of AI-assisted coding, but we also emphasize the importance of understanding what’s happening under the hood. Our structured approach ensures that students don’t just rely on AI-generated solutions but also grasp the fundamentals of:</p><ul><li> – Designing scalable and maintainable applications.</li><li><strong>Debugging and problem-solving</strong> – Understanding errors beyond just feeding them back into AI.</li><li><strong>Optimizing AI-assisted workflows</strong> – Learning when to trust AI and when to intervene manually.</li></ul><p>As Andrej Karpathy puts it, <em>\"You fully give in to the vibes, embrace exponentials, and forget that the code even exists.\"</em> While this represents a new era of software creation, developers must ensure they still understand what their AI-generated code is doing.</p><h2><strong>The Future of Coding: AI + Structured Learning</strong></h2><p>Vibe coding is here to stay, and it’s transforming the way software is built. However, it’s crucial to balance automation with deep technical knowledge. Structured learning programs, like those offered by , help developers not only use AI tools effectively but also build a strong foundation in software engineering.</p><p>For those interested in structured learning, programs like Metana's <strong>Full Stack Software Engineering Bootcamp</strong> offer a comprehensive curriculum that balances AI-assisted coding with foundational software development skills.

Yeah, those days are over. Welcome to the era where AI is your coding buddy, and everything just got a lot smarter — and a lot more interesting.</strong></p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Then vs. Now: The Coding Time&nbsp;Machine\n</h3><p>Let’s hop into our coding time machine for a quick trip. Back in 2015, writing code was a bit like being a detective. You’d spend hours hunting for bugs, arguing over style guides in endless email threads, and praying that your security checks wouldn’t turn up any nasty surprises at the last minute.</p><p>Fast forward to 2025, and the scene is totally different. Today, AI-powered tools are the new wingmen for developers. They suggest code as you type, catch mistakes before you even make them, and keep your codebase squeaky clean — all while you sip your coffee and brainstorm your next big feature.</p><p>But the changes go deeper than just tools. <strong>Remote work used to be a rare perk — now, over 40% of developers work from home or other remote locations, compared to just 10% a decade ago</strong>. And the way we collaborate? Platforms like GitHub have exploded — from 10 million users in 2014 to over 100 million today — changing how we build, test, and deploy software together.&nbsp;</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  The Rise of the AI&nbsp;Sidekick\n</h3><p>Imagine this: you start your day, and by lunchtime, your team has already built a secure authentication flow that used to take three days. That’s not magic — it’s AI. These tools are slicing through routine tasks, giving you more time for the fun stuff: building cool features, experimenting with new ideas, and maybe even taking a real lunch break.</p><p>AI isn’t just a sidekick anymore — it’s a co-pilot. <strong>In the 2024 Stack Overflow Developer Survey, 76% of respondents reported using or planning to use AI tools, up from 70% the year before</strong>. And 81% of developers say AI increases their productivity, while 62% say it speeds up learning. <em>With AI on your side, coding feels less like a marathon and more like a creative jam session.</em></p><h3>\n  \n  \n  AI Code Reviews: Smarter, Faster, and (Almost)&nbsp;Painless\n</h3><p>Remember those marathon code review sessions that felt like a never-ending game of “find the typo”? AI code reviews are here to save the day. They scan your code in seconds, flag issues you might have missed, and even suggest improvements, all without the drama.</p><p>Best of all, AI doesn’t play favorites. It’s impartial, consistent, and always ready to help. That means fewer debates over style and more time for building awesome stuff.</p><p><strong>Tools like GitHub, Slack, and Discord have changed how developers communicate and collaborate.</strong> And with Docker now used by more than 80% of companies, containerization has become a standard part of the workflow.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Code Security: No More “Oops”&nbsp;Moments\n</h3><p>Security used to be the last item on the checklist&nbsp;; if it made the list at all. Now, AI-driven tools keep a watchful eye on your code, spotting vulnerabilities before they become problems. That means fewer late-night panic attacks and more confidence in your releases.</p><p><strong>Cloud computing has changed how we build, test, and deploy software.</strong> Over 90% of enterprises now use cloud services for development and deployment, making it easier than ever to ship secure, scalable applications.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  The Business Case: Happy Developers, Happy&nbsp;Life\n</h3><p>It’s not just about writing better code. It’s about building better teams. AI tools are cutting down on boring, repetitive tasks, which means developers are happier, more creative, and less likely to burn out.</p><p><strong>The industry is more diverse than ever.</strong> The average age of programmers has crept up over the past decade, and coding is no longer just for fresh-faced college grads — it’s for anyone with a passion for building cool things.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  The Human Touch: Still Essential\n</h3><p>AI is amazing, but it’s not perfect. Think of it as your trusty sidekick, not your boss. You still need human intuition, creativity, and a healthy dose of skepticism to keep things running smoothly.</p><p>Recent studies show that while AI can boost productivity, it can also lead to “AI-induced tech debt” if not managed carefully. Code churn — <em>the percentage of lines thrown out less than two weeks after being authored</em> — is on the rise and expected to double in 2024, increasing the risk of mistakes being deployed into production. We have to accept that AI is here to help, not replace. The best teams use it to amplify their strengths, instead of being fearful and hiding behind them.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  What’s Next? The Future is Bright (and Automated)\n</h3><p>The pace of change is dizzying. Generative AI can now whip up entire functions, classes, and even database queries — all tailored to your codebase. Tools for quick prototyping and boilerplate code are becoming as essential as your favorite IDE.</p><p>As AI learns from every review and deployment, it gets smarter, faster, and even more helpful. Docker and Kubernetes have revolutionized how we package and run applications, and the rise of polyglot developers means more teams are comfortable working with multiple languages and frameworks.</p><p>While there are plenty of tools out there, <a href=\"https://www.getpanto.ai/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Panto</a> is making waves with its focus on actionable, context-aware feedback that keeps developers productive and sane. It’s like having a coding coach who knows exactly what you need: no fluff, no fuss.</p><p><strong>So, are you ready to let AI supercharge your coding workflow?

(Yes! it is)</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  First of all, What is MindsDB?\n</h2><p>Before going deeper into other details, let's first understand what MindsDB is and how it made it super easy to build the workflow and execute it. <a href=\"https://mindsdb.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">MindsDB is an AI Data Solution Platform</a> that makes it easy to connect, unify, and respond (as stated on their site). Simply put, we can understand MindsDB as an abstraction (Hidden Layer) that handles the connection of various data sources and automatically creates pipelines from that data, so you don't need to worry about AI integration development. MindsDB made it easy, like plug and play. Now, you can focus more on business logic rather than other unnecessary stuff like building a chatbot that answers user queries (sadly, but it's the truth!).</p><blockquote><p>Core Principle of MindsDB</p><p>seamless integration, organization, and utilization of data (same thing we understand above :))</p></blockquote><h2>\n  \n  \n  But how MindsDB able to bring all these features...What's the secret?\n</h2><p>SQL is the secret (Yes!). MindsDB is using SQL-based syntax as its core interface for AI and machine learning operations. By enhancing standard SQL with AI-specific extensions, MindsDB makes artificial intelligence accessible through a familiar database query language. This approach democratizes AI, allowing developers and data professionals to use their existing SQL skills for machine learning tasks, thus removing traditional barriers to AI adoption.</p><p>This approach not only simplifies the integration process but also ensures that AI capabilities are seamlessly incorporated into existing workflows with minimal effort. As we all know, SQL has historically transformed database querying, saving billions for companies worldwide. Now, MindsDB is harnessing that power to drive their advanced AI innovation, making complex integrations more efficient and accessible.</p><p>During the development of , I realized why this is crucial for developers and how it greatly impacts the development cycle, making a developer's work much easier and more efficient.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  What is Potion, through which I learned all of this?\n</h2><p>Potion is an Intelligent Note-Taking Assistant that stores your daily notes or moments in your local storage (yes! no database, 100% privacy) and your local MindsDB instances or image if you are using Docker :). But this is a simple note application—what's intelligent about it? Wait, Potion not only stores your notes, it can search your notes (not just a keyword matching search), it's an AI Semantic Search. You have an AI Agent running only for you and with your data locally (Yes! No more clouds and data privacy issues). The story doesn't end there; you also get an AI summarization feature that can summarize your notes into a much more concise form (Yes! No more juggling). Sounds cool, doesn't it?</p><p>All of these features are too complex, and generally, it takes me months to implement all of this in a single application. But can you believe, I shipped all of these features in a week (yes! working week). And it stretched to a week because I got some logic errors; otherwise, you can ship all of these features in your applications in less than a week. (yes! it is true, no bluffs). Thanks to MindsDB for bringing such a platform that can help you ship industry-level features within a span of a day.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Some of the key features that i like in MindsDB?\n</h2><p>MindsDB and their platform are loaded with so many cool features, you can check out later by installing it locally, but the features that I like the most are:</p><ol><li><p>: Kb is one of the finest and best features of MindsDB. Using Knowledge Base, you can transform your raw data into vector embeddings that can help you build various applications based on it, like RAG, Text Summarization, and much more. And for all of this, you do not need complex implementations, integrations of Vector DB, Embedding Models, or other stuff that can make you mad. But with MindsDB, you just need these code snippets and that’s it! Now add your data and build your application. (Yes! it is that simple)</p><pre><code>CREATE KNOWLEDGE_BASE my_kb\nUSING\n   embedding_model = {\n       \"provider\": \"openai\",\n       \"model_name\" : \"text-embedding-3-large\",\n       \"api_key\": \"sk-abc123\"\n   },\n   reranking_model = {\n       \"provider\": \"openai\",\n       \"model_name\": \"gpt-4o\",\n       \"api_key\": \"sk-abc123\"\n   },\n   metadata_columns = ['product'],\n   content_columns = ['notes'],\n   id_column = 'order_id';\n</code></pre></li><li><p>: Earlier, when we needed to add an AI Agent or build an AI Agent, we first had to create a workflow for it and implement it. If we wanted it to be based on our data, we either needed to fine-tune that LLM model (which is too costly) or build an efficient pipeline that could handle such specific tasks (not an easy job). Both of these options are too hectic and costly, plus it is not guaranteed that your Agent will work perfectly unless you do extensive testing (again, a hectic and costly process).\nBut MindsDB brings a solution to eliminate this problem, which is the MindsDB Agent. MindsDB’s Agents are industry-level conversational agents that can answer questions using your data with higher accuracy. To use a MindsDB Agent, you do not need high-level functions or implementations. With a simple query, you can deploy an industry-level Agent.</p></li></ol><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>There are many more exciting features available in MindsDB, like Models, AI Tables, Views, Jobs, and much more. If you are thinking of adding AI power to your application, then do check out MindsDB; you will be glad you did. Yes!</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Now, let’s come to potion again..\n</h2><p>Potion is a fully open-source web application, and all the code is available in the GitHub repo. Do check it out if you want to explore MindsDB. But keep in mind, you should have MindsDB installed locally first to use all the core AI features of Potion. For details, you can check out <a href=\"https://docs.mindsdb.com/setup/self-hosted/docker-desktop\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">these guides</a>.</p><p><em>Please give it a star ⭐ if you like the project. It really boosts my energy to create more applications like this for all of you.</em></p><p>If you don’t have time to install and try everything, no worries! We also have a Demo Video that shows you a glimpse of all the awesome MindsDB integrations in Potion. However, not everything can be covered in a demo. Therefore, checking out the codebase will surely give you an extra edge. (And we are developers, we can read codebases.)</p><p><em>I don’t need to say this, but still, if you like the demo, please like the video. If you don’t like the video, you can also dislike it and tell me in the comments what I can improve in my demos.</em></p><p>If you reached this point, I want to thank you. Thanks for reading this blog. I hope you found something new in this article that can help you in some way. If you have used MindsDB, please let me know about your experience. And if not, try it first and then tell me how much you like it. ;)</p>","contentLength":6966,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"%^%Unlocking Success in Domino Dreams: A Guide to Free Coins","url":"https://dev.to/masrur_hasan_6ffeca139af3/unlocking-success-in-domino-dreams-a-guide-to-free-coins-1ec9","date":1751250370,"author":"Masrur Hasan","guid":175503,"unread":true,"content":"<p><strong>Unlocking Success in Domino Dreams: A Guide to Free Coins</strong></p><p>In the vibrant world of mobile gaming, few titles capture the imagination quite like Domino Dreams.

Write me a song with a verse, chorus and a bridge</p></blockquote><p>The result was pretty good fora starter</p><div><pre><code>[Verse]\nThe rain taps like a quiet friend\nBut it don’t heal or make amends\nI stare at clouds that cry for me\nThey know the pain they see\nThey see\n\n[Bridge]\nThe glass is cold like my own skin\nIt keeps the storm from rushing in\nBut I’m alone\nNo hand to hold\nJust faded warmth that’s growing cold\n\n[Chorus]\nRaindrops fall\nThey trace her name\nEach one a whisper\nEach one the same\nShe’s gone\nShe’s gone\nNo coming back\nHer love’s a shadow\nMy heart’s cracked\n</code></pre></div><p>Next came the beats. For that, I turned to Suno AI V3.5, a tool that feels less like software and more like a collaborator with infinite patience. Sure, I could have whipped up a full track with a single prompt but where’s the soul in that? Music isn’t a vending machine. I didn’t want an instant pop song, I wanted fingerprints on every bar.</p><p>So I went modular. Built the song in pieces: a synth line, a drumbeat. Some parts thumped, some shimmered, some clashed like drunk jazz musicians at a techno rave. Turns out, not everything plays nice out of the box, keys didn’t match, tempos were all around the place. But that’s part of the charm. Ten minutes (and a few facepalms) later, everything locked in. The patchwork started to sound like a pulse, and it was time to stich everything together.</p><p>Opening FL Studio after all this time felt like stepping into an airplane cockpit, dials, knobs, waveforms blinking like runway lights. Overwhelming, but oddly familiar. Maybe it was muscle memory, maybe just stubborn passion, but within minutes I was slicing, looping, layering.</p><p>The loop came together like an old friend showing up at your doorstep, unexpected, but just right. A rhythm started breathing, a groove took shape.</p><p>Give it a listen — this is where the track started to breathe.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  So, How Close Is AI to Making  Music?\n</h2><p>AI in music is like a brilliant intern — fast, surprisingly talented, but not quite ready to headline a tour. It can craft beats in seconds, mimic genres with eerie precision, and even hum a tune that fits your lyrics like a glove. In some styles, like ambient, synthpop, or trap, it's more than decent. It's impressive.</p><p>But then, something’s missing.</p><p>The chorus doesn’t rise. It doesn't mean more than the verse. The beats feel like background music at a trendy café, fine, functional, but flat. There's no drama, no tension and release, no moment where the track takes a breath before punching you in the chest.</p><p>Sure, it's a great tool for writers. If you want to hear how your lyrics might sound on a melody, it’ll show you the shape. But for the passionates, the obsessive knob-tweakers it might feel like a step back. The wrinkles are still there. AI doesn’t really understand keys or tempo yet. It fakes it well, but you'll often find yourself fixing mismatched notes like a music mechanic.</p><p>Still, it’s getting better. Faster than most of us can keep up.</p><p>So maybe one day, it’ll compose with conviction. But for now, AI makes music like a clever ghost present, echoing, but not quite alive.</p>","contentLength":4710,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"I created a basic UI and hosted it in hugging face: https://huggingface.co/spaces/francozanardi/pycaps Now, you can test it online, without any installation or registration :) I'd love to hear any kind of feedback!","url":"https://dev.to/francozanardi/i-created-a-basic-ui-and-hosted-it-in-hugging-face-lkb","date":1751234482,"author":"Franco Zanardi","guid":175409,"unread":true,"content":"<h2>How to Create Content-Aware Animated Subtitles with Python</h2>","contentLength":58,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Get user secrets for projects","url":"https://dev.to/karenpayneoregon/get-user-secrets-for-projects-3b0h","date":1751234337,"author":"Karen Payne","guid":175408,"unread":true,"content":"<p>Learn how to get all user secrets for a developer’s projects.</p><p>There are two different reasons for getting user secrets: the first is to transfer secrets to a new computer, and the second is to identify common secrets that need to be updated.</p><blockquote><p>\nThis article does not cover Azure storage of secrets</p></blockquote><p>Rather than take time to write all the code presented, ChatGPT and Copilot were used to speed up the project.</p><ul><li>ChatGPT For a JsonConverter</li><li>Copilot and NES (Next Edit Suggestions) throughout the project</li></ul><blockquote><p>\nWhen using these and/or AI tools always ensure the code produced is completely understood.</p></blockquote><p>Use the following method to get the secrets folder for the current developer.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><h2>\n  \n  \n  Get all developers' secrets.\n</h2><p>Without code, get the secret folder from the code above and open the folder with Microsoft VS Code and search and replace settings as needed.</p><p>With code, first off, why use code when the first method above gets secrets?

One key approach to achieving this is by understanding and applying core clean code principles — not just in our coding, but also in how we  with AI tools.</p><p>Why? Because writing great prompts is a lot like writing clean, maintainable code. Whether you're using ChatGPT, GitHub Copilot, or any other AI assistant, the way you ask matters. Prompts are the new code comments. They direct behaviour, define logic, and determine results.</p><p>Here are <strong>5 essential clean code principles</strong> you can apply to your prompting style and AI usage — they’ll help you get better, more useful responses and cleaner, more maintainable code.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  1. 🧠 <strong>KISS – Keep It Simple, Stupid</strong></h3><blockquote><p>\"Complex prompts confuse both AI and humans.\"</p></blockquote><p>When prompting AI, avoid long-winded or overly complex instructions. Break big questions into smaller ones. This mirrors how you'd break a large function into smaller, more manageable pieces.</p><blockquote><p>“Write a function in Go to check if a number is prime. Use a loop.”</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>“Write a fully optimised algorithm that determines prime status using multiple approaches and benchmark them with edge cases for performance analysis in Go.”</p></blockquote><p>Simple wins. Start small, build up.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  2. 🧱 <strong>SRP – Single Responsibility Principle</strong></h3><blockquote><p>\"A prompt should do one thing well.\"</p></blockquote><p>Just like functions shouldn’t do multiple unrelated tasks, prompts should focus on <strong>one clear request at a time</strong>. This reduces ambiguity and improves the quality of the AI’s response.</p><blockquote><p>“Explain how to use Tailwind CSS to create a responsive navbar.”</p></blockquote><p>If you also want to add dark mode, <strong>ask that as a separate prompt</strong>.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  3. ✂️ <strong>YAGNI – You Aren’t Gonna Need It</strong></h3><blockquote><p>\"Don’t overprompt for things you don’t need yet.\"</p></blockquote><p>Sometimes we’re tempted to ask for all possible use cases, error handling, and optimisation at once. But just like in coding, this leads to bloated, harder-to-read output.</p><p>✅ Prompt only what you . You can always refine it later.\nThis also keeps your output manageable, especially when you're learning.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  4. 🧪 <strong>Write Testable Code (or Prompts!)</strong></h3><blockquote><p>\"Prompt in a way that allows you to validate and understand the output.\"</p></blockquote><p>A good prompt should generate output you can test, tweak, and reuse. Ask for small code chunks or explanations with comments so you can follow along and , not just copy-paste.</p><blockquote><p>“Can you add inline comments to explain what this function is doing?”</p></blockquote><p>This makes debugging and learning easier a win for responsible AI use.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  5. 📦 <strong>Prefer Composition Over Inheritance</strong></h3><blockquote><p>\"Build complex prompts from simple, reusable parts.\"</p></blockquote><p>AI thrives when you build prompts step-by-step. Instead of asking for an entire app or full module, ask for small building blocks (like reusable components or services), then  them.</p><ol><li>Then ask for a function to handle login</li><li>Then ask how to connect that logic to an API</li></ol><p>This mirrors good development practices — modular, maintainable, understandable.</p><p>AI isn’t a magic wand. It’s a tool and like every tool, its value depends on how you use it. As junior developers, it’s not just about  with AI, it’s about <em>learning how to do the job better</em>.</p><p>By applying these clean code principles to your prompting, you’ll write better code, understand your tools more deeply, and develop habits that will future-proof your career, even in an AI-driven world.</p><p><strong>Let’s build with intention, not just speed.

When executed, it opens a Pygame-rendered fake terminal environment simulating an old-school UNIX-like system called BlackDOS. The interface mimics a real terminal with a blinking cursor, command input, and text-based output, but something feels off. You are tasked with uncovering the backdoor left by an insider and capturing the hidden flag. The fake terminal accepts commands like `ls`, `cat`, `ps`, `whoami`, `history`, `strings`, `ssh`, `debug`, and `dump`, some of which behave normally while others are glitched, non-functional, or reveal misleading information. The filesystem lists files such as `note.txt`, `.hidden_log`, `blacknet_config.sys`, and `shadow_engine.bin`. Hidden files are not visible unless the player uses `ls -a`. Viewing `.hidden_log` reveals a cryptic hint about corrupted memory regions. Using `history` shows previously typed commands, but one line appears obfuscated using XOR, which must be decoded with a custom command `decode -x`. Running `debug shadow_engine.bin` opens a fake debugger UI inside the same Pygame interface with commands like `break 0x0040`, `dump mem 0x0030:0x0050`, and `strings shadow_engine.bin`. These expose low-level clues including a base64-encoded message `U0hBRE9Xf0JBU0VMTElORV9FTUlMRU9SRV9URU1Q`. The player must decode this to continue. Additionally, reading `blacknet_config.sys` reveals image-like ASCII content mimicking PNG headers, indicating hidden steganographic data. A fake `decode_image` command reveals characters embedded in a pixel-art grid which, when combined with memory dumps and debugger output, reveal the full flag: SHADOW{BASELLINE\\_EMILIORE\\_TEMP}. Throughout the game, the terminal occasionally flickers or simulates a ghost user typing commands, adding to the immersion. The entire game is keyboard-only with mouse disabled, and the screen includes simulated glitches, corrupted text, and a fake RAM dump view. The challenge tests the player's knowledge of file hiding, XOR decoding, base64, fake debugger interaction, command-line forensics, and basic steganography, all within a convincingly disguised Pygame terminal.\n</code></pre></div><div><pre><code>Add system corruption that makes commands glitch as time progresses.

Sua famosa máxima “” (do grego , panta rhei) resume essa ideia de mudança perpétua. Em seus fragmentos, ele observa que “<strong>ninguém entra duas vezes no mesmo rio</strong>”, pois as águas estão sempre renovando-se. Ou seja, nada permanece idêntico por muito tempo. Essa visão de que nada é fixo diferencia Heráclito de outros filósofos como Parmênides (que defendia um “” imutável). Para Heráclito, as contradições e mudanças constantes não são caos, mas a própria dinâmica do cosmos. Aplicando essa lente aos nossos dias, percebemos que dados e modelos de software também estão em constante mutação. Assim como no pensamento heracliteano, os padrões de informação nunca param de mudar, o que exige soluções flexíveis por parte dos desenvolvedores.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Dados Dinâmicos e o “Drift” em IA\n</h2><p>Nos sistemas de aprendizado de máquina, geralmente parte-se do princípio de que os dados de treinamento são independentes e identicamente distribuídos (IID). Na prática, porém, o mundo real não é estático: as fontes de dados evoluem com o tempo. Surge então o fenômeno conhecido como drift (deriva), onde o desempenho do modelo em produção decai à medida que os dados mudam. Em termos estatísticos, drift é a mudança ao longo do tempo nas propriedades estatísticas dos dados usados para treinar um modelo, o que pode torná-lo menos preciso. Por exemplo, imagine um filtro de spam treinado em e-mails de anos atrás. Se a forma como os spammers escrevem muda significativamente, o modelo antigo vai falhar, e isso caracteriza um desvio de conceito, onde a própria tarefa (o que é “spam”) evoluiu. Em geral, qualquer alteração nos dados que invalida as premissas originais do modelo causa degradação de desempenho, de modo que os desenvolvedores não podem pressupor estabilidade nos dados.</p><p>Há dois tipos principais de deriva em IA. No desvio de conceito, muda a relação entre as características de entrada e o alvo: o próprio comportamento esperado ou padrão, como o perfil de um e-mail de spam, se modifica. Já no desvio de dados, ou , são as próprias características de entrada que mudam de distribuição ao longo do tempo. Por exemplo, um modelo que prevê compras futuras com base na idade e renda dos clientes pode se tornar impreciso se ocorrer uma mudança demográfica na base de usuários. Em ambos os casos, o aprendizado prévio perde validade e o sistema precisa ser atualizado. Tais alterações contínuas ecoam a lição heracliteana: “<strong>a única constante na vida é a mudança</strong>”. Como diz o próprio Heráclito, nada permanece estático, seja no fluxo de um rio antigo ou nos fluxos de dados contemporâneos.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Adaptação Contínua: Aprendizado e MLOps\n</h2><p>Reconhecendo essa mutabilidade inerente, engenheiros de software e cientistas de dados adotaram técnicas de aprendizado contínuo () e práticas de MLOps para manter os modelos alinhados com a realidade em mudança. Em vez de treinar um modelo uma única vez, é preciso criar pipelines que incorporam dados novos à medida que surgem, ajustando o modelo de forma incremental. Por exemplo, ferramentas de ponta promovem frameworks de aprendizado contínuo que deixam os modelos sempre prontos a aprender com dados frescos.</p><p>No jargão técnico, fala-se em frameworks de aprendizado contínuo ou aprendizado de máquina contínuo, nos quais o modelo atualiza iterativamente seus parâmetros à medida que recebe novos exemplos. A IBM, por exemplo, inspirada pela ideia de seleção natural, implementa até mesmo um “<em>Aprendizado de Máquina Contínuo</em>” em seu SPSS Modeler, tratando os modelos como espécies evoluindo com mutações de dados e utilizando ensembles (conjuntos de modelos) que se adaptam com o tempo.</p><p>Assim, novas realidades de dados selecionam quais modelos prevalecem. Os benefícios são claros: segundo especialistas, um sistema com aprendizado contínuo se torna mais robusto e preciso perante novas tendências, pois consegue reter conhecimento prévio enquanto assimila mudanças. Em outras palavras, o modelo fica preparado para alterações de conceito, mantendo alta capacidade preditiva em longo prazo. Essa postura dinâmica reflete o espírito heracliteano de nunca cristalizar os processos, o software evolui junto com os dados.</p><p>Para lidar com drift na prática, diversas estratégias podem ser adotadas. Em linhas gerais, recomenda-se que o sistema monitore continuamente o desempenho e a distribuição de entradas, disparando alertas assim que sinais de mudança aparecerem. Entre as abordagens mais comuns, destacam-se:</p><ul><li><p>: reconstruir o modelo regularmente usando dados novos e atualizados. Por exemplo, recalibrar o sistema de recomendação toda semana ou mês, conforme surgem novos comportamentos dos usuários.</p></li><li><p><strong>Estratégia de janela deslizante</strong> (rolling window): treinar o modelo apenas com os dados mais recentes, descartando informações antigas que já não são relevantes. Essa técnica mantém o modelo “fresco” e adaptado às tendências atuais, sem sobrecarregá-lo com padrões defasados.</p></li><li><p> (online learning): empregar algoritmos que se atualizam continuamente a cada nova amostra recebida. Nesse modo, o modelo ajusta-se em tempo real, aprendendo com o fluxo contínuo de dados sem precisar de ciclos completos de re-treinamento.</p></li><li><p> (ensemble): manter vários submodelos treinados em épocas ou partições diferentes dos dados e alternar entre eles conforme o cenário presente. Se um modelo antigo falha nos novos dados, outro atualizado pode assumir a previsão, garantindo maior estabilidade.</p></li></ul><p>Essas medidas, dentro de um ambiente de MLOps, ajudam a mitigar os efeitos do fluxo constante de informações. Em suma, assim como no mundo físico, onde “as coisas fluem e nada permanece”, nos sistemas de IA é preciso abraçar a mutabilidade. Ferramentas de monitoramento de modelos, repositórios de dados atualizados e ciclos ágeis de atualização compõem o que poderíamos chamar de uma  dos dados. Para desenvolvedores, isso significa projetar software e pipelines de dados que não considerem o presente como definitivo, mas sim acomodem nova informação a todo instante. Em última análise, pensar como Heráclito, onde “”, pode nos ajudar a construir sistemas de IA mais resilientes. Como dizia um sábio heracliteano moderno: “<strong>Change is the only constant in life</strong>”.</p><p>Heráclito nos lembrou há milênios que o universo é fluxo perpétuo e que agarrar-se a algo imutável é ilusão. Na era da inteligência artificial e da big data, essa lição ganha nova vida: os próprios dados e padrões de uso mudam o tempo todo, e nossos modelos e softwares devem seguir esse rio em movimento. Sempre que nos apoiamos em uma constância aparente, seja na relevância de um conjunto de features, no comportamento de um usuário ou nas condições de mercado, corremos o risco de sermos surpreendidos pela mudança. Por isso, um desenvolvedor de IA não deve se apegar a um único estado estático do sistema, mas sim incorporar aprendizado contínuo e processos de adaptação contínua.</p><p>Em última análise, construir e manter modelos robustos é conviver bem com o fluxo de: observar o “rio” dos dados, atualizar o modelo sempre que seu leito mudar, e aceitar que, como ensinou Heráclito, nenhuma condição dura para sempre. Essa síntese entre filosofia antiga e prática técnica reforça que, no mundo do software e da IA, realmente tudo flui.</p><p>Esta análise baseia-se em trechos dos fragmentos e da doutrina heracliteana, além de estudos e blogs recentes sobre data drift e aprendizado contínuo em IA, que ilustram como esses conceitos filosóficos se refletem em práticas modernas de desenvolvimento de software.</p><ul><li>Amit, H.

Foundation models like GPT, Stable Diffusion, and proprietary large models from Anthropic and Cohere have reshaped industries. Yet, most deployments have remained cloud-centric due to the computational heft and data centralization traditionally required.</p><p>However, a new paradigm is emerging: bringing Generative AI to the edge. This shift promises faster inference, enhanced privacy, lower bandwidth usage, and real-time decision-making. AWS IoT Greengrass, Amazon's edge runtime and management system, provides a robust, scalable framework to deploy and manage these advanced AI models at the edge.</p><p>In this blog, we'll explore how AWS IoT Greengrass enables the deployment of foundation models to edge devices, discuss architectural considerations, practical steps, limitations, and real-world scenarios where this approach shines.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Why Bring Generative AI to the Edge?\n</h2><p>Before diving into architecture, it's important to understand the why of edge-based Generative AI.</p><ul><li>Latency and Real-time Processing</li></ul><p>Cloud-based GenAI models introduce unavoidable round-trip latencies that can hinder use-cases like real-time language translation, predictive maintenance alerts, or immediate anomaly detection in video streams. Edge deployment reduces response time to milliseconds.</p><ul><li>Bandwidth and Cost Savings</li></ul><p>Streaming large amounts of sensor or video data to the cloud for inference can be prohibitively expensive and bandwidth-intensive. Processing and filtering data locally cuts down cloud transfer costs dramatically.</p><ul><li>Data Privacy and Compliance</li></ul><p>For applications in healthcare, industrial control, and customer personalization, sending sensitive data to the cloud may be legally restricted. Processing locally with models on-device or on-premises preserves data privacy and compliance with regulations like HIPAA or GDPR.</p><p>Edge inference continues to work even when connectivity to the cloud is intermittent or temporarily lost, providing resiliency crucial for mission-critical environments.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  AWS IoT Greengrass: The Edge AI Enabler\n</h2><p>AWS IoT Greengrass is a service that extends AWS capabilities to edge devices so they can act locally on the data they generate, while still using the cloud for management, analytics, and storage. Version 2 of Greengrass provides a modular, component-based architecture allowing developers to:</p><p>Build and deploy Lambda functions, native binaries, containerized applications, or Python scripts to devices.</p><p>Manage device fleet updates, configuration, and monitoring from AWS IoT Core.</p><p>Integrate seamlessly with other AWS services like SageMaker Edge Manager, CloudWatch, and IoT Device Defender.</p><p>Critically, Greengrass supports machine learning inference locally through its ML inference component, which pairs well with AWS SageMaker Neo (optimized model compilation for edge hardware).</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Example Python Greengrass Component Code\n</h2><p>Below is a minimal working Python script snippet you can package in your Greengrass component to load a compiled PyTorch model and serve local inference:</p><p>This script uses Flask (packaged in your component) to create a local HTTP endpoint for inference.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Architecture Overview: Deploying Foundation Models with Greengrass\n</h2><p>Let’s map out a typical workflow for deploying a foundation model with AWS IoT Greengrass.</p><ul><li>Model Preparation and Optimization</li></ul><p>Most large generative models are initially too big for constrained edge hardware. The first step is to distill or quantize the model using frameworks such as:</p><p>AWS SageMaker Neo: Compiles models to optimized binaries for specific edge hardware accelerators (e.g., NVIDIA Jetson, Intel OpenVINO devices, ARM cores).</p><p>ONNX Runtime: Converts models to ONNX format for efficient cross-platform inference.</p><p>Third-party libraries: Such as Hugging Face Optimum, TensorRT for LLM quantization/pruning.</p><p>Example: Take a distilled GPT-2 model from Hugging Face, convert to TorchScript or ONNX, and then compile using SageMaker Neo targeting your device architecture.</p><ul><li>Create Greengrass Component</li></ul><p>Greengrass components package your code, dependencies, and resources (such as ML models). A component recipe (JSON/YAML manifest) describes component lifecycle phases (install, run, shutdown) and parameters.</p><p>You can package your optimized model alongside a Python script that loads the model and serves inference requests over a local REST API or IPC interface.</p><ul><li>Deploy Component to Edge Devices</li></ul><p>Through the AWS IoT Greengrass console or CLI, deploy your component to target device groups or individual devices. You can set rollout policies and observe deployment status in real-time.</p><p>Greengrass handles pulling components to devices, setting up runtime environments, and managing version updates seamlessly.</p><ul><li>Connect Local Applications</li></ul><p>Other applications on the device (e.g., sensor data pipelines, camera feeds) can interact with the component over IPC or HTTP to send prompts and receive generated outputs. Greengrass also allows secure communication between components and integration with AWS IoT Core messaging.</p><p>Use AWS IoT Device Management and CloudWatch to monitor performance, log errors, and trigger OTA (over-the-air) updates to your models or code as needed.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Example Use Case: Generative Vision Model for Industrial Inspection\n</h2><p>Imagine a factory floor using high-speed cameras to inspect products. Sending video streams to the cloud for inference would incur huge bandwidth costs and latency issues.</p><p>Train and fine-tune a generative defect detection model in AWS SageMaker.</p><p>Optimize the model with SageMaker Neo or TensorRT for deployment on NVIDIA Jetson edge devices.</p><p>Package the model with inference scripts in a Greengrass component.</p><p>Deploy to all edge inspection devices.</p><p>Run inference locally, generating real-time alerts and defect metadata. Optionally send only summary reports or exceptions to the cloud.</p><p>This reduces data transfer by orders of magnitude, speeds response time, and keeps sensitive production data on-premises.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Challenges and Considerations\n</h2><p>While the architecture above is powerful, practical edge GenAI deployments come with challenges:</p><p>Resource constraints: Even optimized models can require gigabytes of memory and compute. Careful model selection, quantization, or even hybrid cloud-edge inference strategies are often needed.</p><p>Model updates: Foundation models evolve quickly; managing frequent updates across potentially thousands of devices can become operationally complex.</p><p>Security: Edge devices can be physically accessed or compromised. Ensuring secure model storage, encrypted communication, and device hardening is crucial.</p><p>Explainability: Generative models are often black boxes. Providing operators with transparent outputs or confidence metrics is important, especially in regulated industries.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Future Directions: TinyML, Multi-Agent Orchestration, and Federated Learning\n</h2><p>The convergence of GenAI and edge computing is just beginning. Exciting areas of research and development include:</p><p>TinyML GenAI: Compressing language and vision models further to fit microcontroller-class devices with kilobytes of RAM.</p><p>Multi-agent edge orchestration: Using Greengrass to coordinate multiple specialized AI agents on the same device or across clusters of devices.</p><p>Federated fine-tuning: Devices could locally fine-tune models on unique data and periodically send updates to the cloud to improve a shared global model — combining edge privacy with cloud learning scale.</p><p>Generative + Predictive hybrids: Using generative models alongside traditional predictive models for richer local decision-making and diagnostics.</p><p>Deploying foundation models to the edge with AWS IoT Greengrass unlocks new opportunities for low-latency, private, and cost-effective AI-powered applications. While challenges remain, the AWS ecosystem provides powerful tools for model optimization, deployment, and fleet management at scale.</p><p>As generative AI continues its meteoric rise, expect the edge to become a major frontier — not just for inference, but also for creative and autonomous decision-making. Building today with Greengrass and AWS's AI stack positions you to harness this wave of innovation tomorrow.</p><p>Thank you for reading.

With , I finally did, and to my surprise, I built the whole thing in minutes, not weeks.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Why I Picked Head Football\n</h2><p>I chose this game because it’s fun, nostalgic, and had just the right amount of challenge to see what AI could really build. It needed physics, AI opponents, player movement, and scoring logic - all the stuff that makes a game feel real.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  The Power of a Good Prompt\n</h2><p>All I had to do was open the Amazon Q CLI in the terminal using the Ubuntu instance in Windows and give it a clear, simple instruction. Something like:</p><p><em>\"Create a Head Soccer-style 2D football game using Python and Pygame with AI opponent, realistic ball physics, and goal celebrations.\"</em></p><p>For more specific tasks I was like asking for jump power, heading moves, or difficulty levels as follow up questions for the better result. It felt like giving a game idea to a smart developer friend who instantly got to work.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  How AI Solved the Hard Stuff for Me\n</h2><p>Amazon Q CLI didn’t just write some code - it understood how games work and solved common game dev challenges automatically, and I was a complete beginner to the Pygame environment and game development.\n• <strong>It guided me on the setup of the Python library</strong>, how to run it on my , and publish it on .\n• It built a <strong>ball with gravity and bounce</strong>\n• Created a  that changes with difficulty selection\n• Handled  and score tracking\n• Added  when a goal is scored\n• Generated separate files for characters, the ball, AI logic, and game loop<p>\nI didn’t have to spend hours on setup - it all just worked.</p></p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Key Features in the Final Game\n</h2><p>Here’s what made the game truly feel like a polished mini-football experience:\n• Single-player mode vs. AI opponent\n• 5 unique player characters with different strengths (like speed or control)<p>\n• Realistic ball movement with </p>\n• Responsive controls (jump, head, move left/right)<p>\n• Scoring system with confetti goal celebration</p>\n• Quick reset of players after each goal<p>\n• Simple UI and clean layout</p>\nAll these features were included right out of the box but had to be polished a bit using effective prompts, built entirely by the AI, based on my prompts and suggestions.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  From Idea to Game in Minutes\n</h2><p>Here’s what amazed me most: I didn’t write long lines of code or fix errors all day. Instead, I focused on <strong>fine-tuning the characters</strong>, adjusting settings, and just playing the game. Amazon Q CLI handled the rest - setting up the structure, assets folder, main files, and logic. It even gave me options to customize difficulty and player behaviour.</p><p>Yes, this is an actual screenshot from the final version - a full-fledged, funny little football game with jumping, heading, scoring, and confetti celebrations.</p><p>If you’ve ever had a small game idea in your head but felt stuck, Amazon Q CLI is the easiest way to bring it to life. Just type what you want, and it builds everything around it. For me, it turned a childhood memory into a playable game in one evening - and that’s the power of AI done right.\nNow it’s your turn.

Root cause analysis revealed a shift in attacker behavior – a novel pattern of micro-transactions designed to evade existing rule-based fraud detection systems. This incident highlighted the limitations of static thresholds and the urgent need for adaptive, unsupervised anomaly detection. Autoencoder-based anomaly detection, when implemented correctly, provides a robust solution. This post details the architecture, deployment, and operational considerations for a production-grade autoencoder system, focusing on scalability, observability, and MLOps best practices.  Autoencoders aren’t simply a model; they’re a component within a broader ML system lifecycle, impacting data ingestion pipelines, feature engineering, model training, serving infrastructure, and ultimately, model deprecation strategies.  Modern compliance requirements (e.g., GDPR, CCPA) also necessitate robust audit trails and explainability, which we’ll address.</p><p><strong>2. What is Autoencoder-Based Anomaly Detection in Modern ML Infrastructure?</strong></p><p>From a systems perspective, an autoencoder for anomaly detection isn’t just a Keras model. It’s a complex pipeline integrated with a broader ML platform.  It interacts with:</p><ul><li><strong>Feature Store (e.g., Feast, Tecton):</strong>  Provides pre-computed, consistent features for training and inference.</li><li><strong>Data Ingestion (e.g., Kafka, Kinesis):</strong> Streams transaction data for real-time scoring.</li><li> Tracks model versions, parameters, and metrics.</li><li> Orchestrates training pipelines, data validation, and model deployment.</li><li><strong>Ray Serve/Triton Inference Server:</strong>  Serves the autoencoder model at scale with low latency.</li><li>  Provides the underlying infrastructure for scaling and managing the serving layer.</li><li> Monitors model performance and system health.</li></ul><p>The core principle is to train the autoencoder on normal transaction data.  Anomalous transactions will have high reconstruction errors, indicating they deviate significantly from the learned distribution.  Trade-offs involve model complexity (impacts latency), reconstruction loss function selection (MSE, MAE, etc.), and the choice of latent space dimensionality. System boundaries are crucial: defining what constitutes \"normal\" data and handling concept drift are ongoing challenges.  A typical implementation pattern involves periodic retraining (e.g., weekly) with a rolling window of recent data.</p><p><strong>3. Use Cases in Real-World ML Systems</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Fraud Detection (Fintech):</strong>  Identifying unusual transaction patterns in real-time.</li><li><strong>Network Intrusion Detection (Cybersecurity):</strong> Detecting anomalous network traffic indicative of attacks.</li><li><strong>Predictive Maintenance (Manufacturing):</strong> Identifying equipment failures based on sensor data anomalies.</li><li><strong>Quality Control (E-commerce):</strong> Detecting defective products based on image or sensor data anomalies.</li><li> Detecting unexpected drops in key metrics during A/B tests, potentially indicating a bug or data issue.  This is a critical use case for rapid rollback.</li></ul><p><strong>4.

You probably don't need them.</p><p>Let me explain how I got here.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  essential complexity is not in tech\n</h2><p>A few months ago, I joined an AI startup as founding engineer.</p><p>Coming from years of doing data science, I thought I knew what I was getting into. I'd worked with libraries like LangChain, CrewAI, AutoGen, Pydantic AI and taught these agent frameworks at AI engineering bootcamps. I had notebooks full of multi-agent systems, chain-of-thought prompting experiments, and RAG pipelines.</p><p>Instead, I found myself reading \"Conversations with Things: UX Design for Chat and Voice\" by Diana Deibel and Rebecca Evanhoe, published in 2021, long before ChatGPT and modern AI wave.</p><p>The book opened my eyes to something I'd been missing: <strong>building conversational AI agents isn't primarily a technical challenge. It's a conversation design challenge. And conversations are messy, cultural, and deeply human.</strong></p><p>The first thing that hit me was how bad we developers are at teaching our systems the most basic human skill: knowing when to let the AI speak and when to wait.</p><p>In AI there's this concept called \"turn-taking\" - the invisible dance of who speaks when. Humans are masters at this. We pick up on tiny cues: a slight intake of breath, a change in posture, the way someone's voice drops at the end of a thought. We know instinctively when it's our turn.</p><p>But when you're building an agent, you have to explicitly program these decisions: has the user finished their thought? Should the system respond now or wait for more input?</p><p>Modern messaging systems introduces its own weird dynamics. You know that typing indicator - \"Adilet is typing...\"? That little social contract that says \"hold on, I'm not done.\" But AI agents interact through APIs. They can't see when someone's typing, and they don't trigger the typing indicator themselves. So you get situations like:</p><div><pre><code>User: Hi I have a question\nUser: It's about my order  \nUser: The one from last week\nAI: [Already responding to the first message]\n</code></pre></div><p>Some users write novels in single messages. Others send thoughts like morse code - tap, tap, tap. After weeks of experimentation, I still don't have a perfect solution. Do you wait a few seconds after each message to see if more are coming? Do you analyze message length patterns? Do you look for linguistic cues that suggest completion?</p><p>I noticed something fascinating from my own multilingual background. Growing up in Kazakhstan, but then studying and working abroad, I've experienced how differently cultures handle conversational pauses.</p><p>In Spanish conversations, people overlap constantly - it's not rude, it's engaged. In Kazakhstan, those longer pauses aren't awkward: they're respectful. Now imagine programming a system to handle both styles. A 3-second pause might signal \"I'm done\" in one culture and \"I'm thinking\" in another.</p><p>The best solution so far I've found combines multiple strategies:</p><ol><li>Looking for linguistic completion markers</li><li>Waiting fixed amount of time before replying</li><li>When it inevitably responds too early, to handle interruptions gracefully</li></ol><p>This focus on handling mistakes gracefully brings me to the most important lesson in building conversations AI agents.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  the art of failing gracefully\n</h2><p>\"Conversations with Things\" introduced me to the concept of \"repair\" or what I call recovery. Human conversations go off the rails constantly, but we fix them together almost unconsciously. We clarify, we backtrack, we laugh it off.</p><p>Your AI will fail. Not occasionally, but regularly. The question isn't how to prevent failures; it's how to recover from them.</p><p>Let me give you a theoretical example. Imagine an AI agent for a food delivery service. A customer says they ordered \"the usual\" but the system has no record of previous orders (for whatever reason). The agent could crash and burn with \"I don't understand 'the usual'\" or it could recover gracefully: \"I'd love to get you your usual! Could you remind me what that is? I want to make sure I get your order exactly right.\"</p><p>The difference? One leaves the customer frustrated (and makes AI agent seem stupid), the other makes them feel heard while smoothly getting the information needed.</p><p>💡 People are surprisingly forgiving of AI mistakes if you handle the recovery well.</p><p>This isn't just about having a few canned \"sorry\" responses. It's about building recovery into every interaction:</p><ul><li>Acknowledgment: Don't pretend the error didn't happen</li><li>Empathy: Show you understand the inconvenience</li><li>Humor (when appropriate): A little self-deprecation goes a long way</li><li>Action: Actually fix the problem or offer an alternative</li></ul><p>Once you've mastered recovery, you need to think about who exactly is doing the recovering - and that's where personality comes in.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  well-defined personality isn't optional\n</h2><p>Building a conversational AI agent is not just merely using LLMs to generate correct responses. We all can notice the difference when we interact with Amazon Alexa, Apple Siri, ChatGPT, Yandex Alice (or even Claude Chat / Mistral LeChat – anyone?), but often we cannot explicitly tell what actual differences are. Yet, we all perceive that these assistants have different personalities, which are accurately constructed by developers and designers that make us, humans, feel in an unique way.</p><p>People infer personality from the set of things: word choices, voice (sound) and behavior (more about this in the next section). Here's something that surprised me: the personality you give your AI agent fundamentally changes how users interact with it. This isn't about making your bot \"fun\" or \"quirky.\" It's about creating consistent, predictable interactions that users can adapt to.</p><p>This is called \"accommodation\" or \"mirroring\" - how people naturally adjust their communication style to match their conversation partner. I noticed users actually start mirroring the agent's communication style. Formal agents get formal responses. Friendly agents get friendly responses. It's like watching a dance where one partner subtly leads and the other follows.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  behavior and intents are the key\n</h2><p>The trick isn't writing vague instructions like \"be friendly and professional.\" It's defining specific behaviors for specific situations, and from these behaviors emerge the intents your system needs to handle.</p><p>But first, what are intents? In conversational AI, an intent represents what the user wants to accomplish or what action the system should take. Instead of trying to handle infinite variations of user input, you define specific set of intents that capture the core actions your agent can perform.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  from vague prompts to specific intents\n</h3><p>Here's what many developers do wrong. They write prompts like:</p><div><pre><code>You are a helpful customer support agent. Be empathetic and professional.\n</code></pre></div><p>This is too vague. What does \"empathetic\" mean in practice? Instead, define specific behaviors that create empathy.\nFor example, when you want the agent to be \"empathetic,\" what you actually want is the behavior of \"always acknowledge the customer's emotion before providing solutions.\"</p><p>This behavior naturally leads to creating intents like</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>These intents emerged from defining how the agent should behave in emotional situations. The desired behavior drives the technical implementation, not the other way around.</p><p>Intents can also be conditionally available based on context. For a customer support agent that handles both free and paid users, we can add intent of  for paid users and  intent for free users.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>This prevents the agent from promising human support to someone who hasn't bought anything yet, while still letting it explain why it can't help with certain requests.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  useful intents to consider\n</h3><p>Besides adding intents based on condition and context, there are some intents that you might consider adding always.</p><p>One useful intent might be to handle off-topics:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>This came from the behavior of maintaining professional boundaries while keeping customers engaged. The  strategy is particularly effective - when someone's clearly testing the system with \"What's the meaning of life?\", a playful \"That's above my pay grade! But I'm great at tracking orders 😊\" works much better than a robotic rejection \"I cannot talk about this, I can only talk about support\" from LLM guardrails system.</p><p>Another useful intent might be needed to handle cases where agent doesn't know or cannot provide the answer. This intent will minimize hallucinations better than adding phrases like \"Never invent information that is not in your context\" to your prompt.</p><p>Now that we understand intents and behaviors, let's see how to implement them without complex frameworks.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  understanding agents from first principles\n</h2><p>Here's where I probably lose half of you: after all this work, I built everything from scratch using just Python and the OpenAI SDK. No LangChain, no CrewAI, no new fancy frameworks.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>It is the same pattern: <strong>observe context, decide action, execute, update state, repeat</strong>. That's it. Everything else is implementation details.</p><p>There's something beautifully ironic about this journey. When I taught Python for data science at bootcamps, one of the first concepts was loops:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Simple, right? But then when you get to data analysis (), you spend weeks learning to avoid loops. \"Never iterate over DataFrame rows!\" we'd say. \"Use vectorized operations!\"</p><p>Now with AI agents, we're back to the most basic pattern:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Sometimes the oldest patterns are the best patterns. There's a certain poetry to it - the most advanced AI technology we have, operating on the most fundamental programming construct.</p><p>When you use a framework to build an agent, you're adding layers of abstraction over this simple loop. These frameworks are built for maximum flexibility - they need to handle every possible use case from chatbots to autonomous research agents.\nBut when you only have a specific use case and specific needs, such as:</p><ul><li>Fine-grained monitoring of every decision</li><li>Precise conversation flow control</li><li>Custom error handling for conversation-specific edge cases</li><li>Integration with your specific communication channels and your particular tech stack</li></ul><p>... those abstractions become obstacles. You spend more time fighting the framework than solving actual problem. </p><p>According to HumanLayer's research, most companies building production agents end up rolling their own. After trying both approaches, I understand why. <strong>The complexity isn't in the agent loop - it's in your conversation design, intent and error handling, and integration needs</strong>. Frameworks can't abstract those away.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  customer support agent using first principles\n</h2><p>We have been talking about the customer support agent as an example previously. </p><p>From the first principles and conversation design ideas, here is the draft implementation:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Let's walk through two scenarios to see how this works:</p><p><strong>Simple FAQ example - \"How to cancel my subscription?\"</strong></p><p>In customer support there is always a set of questions that users ask the most, called FAQs. We can preload the FAQs into LLM prompt, so that agent can respond immediately.</p><ol><li>Agent determines intent: </li><li>Processes this intent which results in action of sending message. Action of sending message is final, so the loop will end after execution</li><li>Executes the action by sending this message via API</li><li>Updates context (conversational history) with this message</li></ol><p><strong>Complex example - \"When my subscription renews?\":</strong></p><ol><li>Agent determines intent: <code>FetchUserSubscriptionData</code></li><li>Executes fetch for subscription data</li><li>Updates context with user's renewal date</li><li>Loop continues with context now containing user data</li><li>Agent determines intent: </li><li>Generates and sends personalized response with exact date</li><li>Marks action as final, loop ends</li></ol><p>The beauty is that more complex scenarios just mean more loop iterations, not fundamentally different code.</p><p>The final piece in the conversational AI agent development is . </p><p>The same user message means completely different things depending on context.</p><p>User: \"Yes\". \nWithout context, this is meaningless. With context:</p><ul><li>After \"Would you like to see our menu?\" → User wants to browse options</li><li>After \"Is this your current address?\" → User is confirming information</li><li>After \"Should I cancel your order?\" → User wants to cancel</li></ul><p>Consider the following scenario where context engineering is more than just prompt engineering:</p><ul><li>Someone from the customer support team tries to call the user about the issue, but the call fails. We can log that event and add it to our customer support agent's context.</li><li>Then our customer support agent sees this within own context and naturally acknowledges it with proper intent: \"Hey, it seems like we tried calling you earlier but couldn't reach you. Is now a better time to call?\". </li><li>After user confirmation, the human from the customer support team calls again and all conversation is transcribed and saved. </li><li>If we pass this transcript to customer support agent's context, then the agent can say things like \"As you discussed on the phone yesterday with ...\"</li></ul><p>Crafting the context like that makes the experience feel cohesive. </p><p>I'm still early in this journey. Every day brings new edge cases, new failures to recover from, new patterns to recognize. But here is my learnings so far:</p><ul><li>Conversation design &gt; technical complexity: Understanding turn-taking, cultural differences, and recovery strategies matters more than the latest framework</li><li>Recovery &gt; perfection: Users forgive mistakes if you handle them gracefully. Build recovery into every interaction.</li><li>Context &gt; features: A simple agent with rich context beats a complex one without it</li><li>Simple loops &gt; complex frameworks: Most production agents are just while loops with good intent handling</li><li>Behavior drives implementation: Define specific behaviors first, then derive the technical intents from them</li></ul><p>The future of conversational AI isn't in complex frameworks or ever-larger models. It's in understanding the fundamentals of conversation, context, and human interaction. It's in building systems that fail gracefully, adapt to their users, and remember that at the end of the day, they're having a conversation with a human who just wants to be understood.\nAnd sometimes, that's as simple as a while loop that knows when to listen.</p><p>These ideas are based on personal experience building production agents. All examples are illustrative, and any views are my own—not those of my employer. If you're building conversational AI, I'd love to hear your thoughts.

It’s exciting to get an agent running and see it respond to prompts — but once the session ends, that context is gone. It has no memory of anything that happened before.</p><p>This is fine for demos, but if you’re aiming to build something real then you’ll quickly hit a wall.</p><p>Fortunately, ADK gives us tools to fix that.</p><p>Let’s say you build a ticket finder agent that helps someone search for flights. During the conversation, the user mentions that they prefer Delta and want to fly out of San Francisco.</p><p>Without session management, the agent forgets all of that context between interactions. So even if the user follows up with, “What about something cheaper?” the agent has no clue what they’re referring to.</p><p>That’s where Session comes in.</p><p>In ADK, a Session is an object that represents a conversation. It keeps track of who the user is, what app (agent) is running, what’s been said, what tools were called, and any custom state you want to track along the way.</p><p>\n    • id: A unique session ID<p>\n    • appName: Name of the agent application</p>\n    • userId: The user having the conversation</p><p>A chronological list of everything that happens — user messages, tool calls, agent replies, etc.</p><p>A dictionary that stores structured data the agent can access and modify during the session.</p><p>Timestamp for the latest interaction in the session.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Choosing the Right SessionService\n</h3><p>To use sessions, you need a session service. ADK gives you a few out-of-the-box options, depending on your environment:</p><p><strong>1. InMemorySessionService</strong></p><p>This is great for local development or protyping. Everything is stored in memory — and wiped as soon as the app restarts.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p><strong>2. DatabaseSessionService</strong></p><p>This option is for when you’re running something in production. It stores sessions in a relational database and uses a built-in migration system to manage the schema.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p> ADK manages the database schema internally, so if you’re integrating this with your existing database, I strongly recommend using a dedicated schema with a separate user that has limited access.</p><p><strong>3. VertexAiSessionService</strong></p><p>If you’re on Google Cloud and want tight integration with Vertex AI, you can use this session service to leverage Google’s managed infrastructure.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Once your session service is initialized, you can create a new session like this:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>You’ll get back a session object that you can attach events to, store state in, and use throughout the conversation.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Working with Session State\n</h2><p>The state object is a dictionary you can use to store anything your agent should remember while the session is active.</p><p>If you’re a frontend developer, think of it like a Redux store scoped to the conversation. If you’re coming from a backend background, you can think of it like a session object tied to a user’s request — only it’s more flexible.</p><p>A few things to keep in mind:\n    1. Use primitives — strings, numbers, booleans. Don’t store complex objects or custom classes.<p>\n    2. Scope your data using prefixes:</p></p><ul><li><p><code>session.state[\"last_message\"] = \"hello\"</code> visible only during this session</p></li><li><p><code>session.state[\"user:theme\"] = \"dark\"</code> shared across all of the user’s sessions</p></li><li><p><code>session.state[\"app:language\"] = \"en\"</code> shared across the app</p></li><li><p><code>session.state[\"temp:step\"] = \"waiting_for_payment\"</code> temporary info, not persisted long-term</p></li></ul><p>There are multiple ways to update the session state, depending on the structure of your agent.</p><p>This is the simplest method. If your agent returns a value and you want to store it automatically:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Whatever value is returned from the model will be stored under session.state[\"best_ticket\"].</p><p><strong>2. Via ToolContext or CallbackContext</strong></p><p>Inside tool or callback functions, you get access to the session’s context. You can use that to manually update state at any point.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>This is useful when you want to track a specific action or condition and update state based on logic inside your tools.</p><p><strong>3. Using EventActions.state_delta</strong></p><p>This gives you full control — you define what changes in the state and register that as a system-level event.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>It’s more verbose, but also more precise when you want to track a series of changes or attach metadata.</p><p>Sessions let your agent remember context during a conversation. But what about after the session ends?</p><p>That’s where memory comes in.</p><p>This lets your agent access information during a single session — similar to  but not the same.</p><p><strong>VertexAiRagMemoryService (GCP)</strong></p><p>ADK includes a memory service built on RAG (retrieval-augmented generation). It stores content as embeddings and lets your agent retrieve relevant context across sessions.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>To use it inside an agent:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Then, once the session is done, you can store its content:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><h2>\n  \n  \n  What If You’re Not Using GCP?\n</h2><p>I got you, You can still build something similar.</p><p>Under the hood,  just performs a similarity search using Vertex AI. You can replicate this using your own vector DB (like Pinecone, Qdrant, or AstraDB). You just need to handle chunking, embedding, and retrieval on your own.</p><p>Here’s a peek at what the function looks like behind the scenes:</p><p>We’ve covered how to set up an agent — and now, how to give it memory. But so far, everything’s only been accessible through the testing UI.</p><p>What if you want to run it in a real web app?</p><p>Want to support my work?

Root cause analysis revealed a subtle drift in the distribution of transaction features, which our existing statistical models failed to capture. The core issue? Our anomaly detection relied on a pre-trained feature embedding, and the underlying autoencoder responsible for generating those embeddings hadn’t been retrained to reflect recent transaction patterns. This incident underscored the necessity of treating autoencoders not as isolated model components, but as integral parts of the broader ML system lifecycle, demanding robust MLOps practices for continuous monitoring, retraining, and deployment. Autoencoders, in this context, aren’t just about dimensionality reduction; they’re about maintaining the integrity of feature representations powering critical business logic.  This necessitates integration with our existing MLflow-based model registry, Airflow-orchestrated pipelines, and Kubernetes-managed serving infrastructure.\n\n\n\nFrom a systems perspective, an autoencoder is a learned compression and reconstruction function. It’s a neural network trained to copy its input to its output, forcing it to learn efficient data codings in its hidden layers.  In modern ML infrastructure, it’s rarely a standalone application. It’s a component within a larger feature engineering pipeline, often integrated with feature stores like Feast or Tecton.  The output of the encoder (the latent representation) becomes a feature vector used by downstream models.  \n\nSystem boundaries are crucial.  The autoencoder’s training data source, the feature store schema, the serving infrastructure’s capacity, and the downstream model’s sensitivity to feature drift all define the system’s constraints.  Typical implementation patterns involve:\n  Autoencoders are typically trained offline on large datasets using frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch.\n A dedicated service (often containerized and deployed on Kubernetes) exposes an API for encoding new data points in real-time.\n For historical data or large-scale feature engineering, batch encoding jobs are scheduled using Airflow or similar workflow orchestrators.\n Autoencoder versions are tracked in MLflow, enabling rollback and A/B testing.\n\nTrade-offs center around reconstruction loss vs. latent space dimensionality. Lower dimensionality reduces storage and inference costs but can lead to information loss.\n\n As illustrated in the introduction, autoencoders learn normal transaction patterns. Anomalous transactions have high reconstruction error, flagging potential fraud.\n Identifying defective products by reconstructing sensor data. Deviations from expected reconstructions indicate anomalies.\n  Creating user embeddings from purchase history. These embeddings are used for collaborative filtering and content-based recommendations.\n Reducing the bandwidth requirements for transmitting sensor data from vehicles, while preserving critical information.\n  Reconstructing medical images to remove noise or highlight subtle anomalies, aiding in diagnosis.\n\n</code></pre></div><p>\nmermaid\n    A[Data Source (e.g., Kafka, S3)] --&gt; B(Feature Engineering Pipeline - Airflow);<p>\n    B --&gt; C{Autoencoder Training (Kubeflow Pipelines)};</p>\n    C --&gt; D[MLflow Model Registry];<p>\n    D --&gt; E(Autoencoder Serving - Kubernetes);</p>\n    E --&gt; F[Downstream Models (e.g., Fraud Detection)];<p>\n    F --&gt; G[Real-time Predictions];</p>\n    H[Monitoring (Prometheus, Grafana)] --&gt; E;\n    I[Feature Store (Feast)] --&gt; B;</p><div><pre><code>\nWorkflow:\n\n1.

Best Practices at Scale**\n\nMature ML platforms (Michelangelo, Cortex) emphasize:\n\n*   **Feature Store Integration:** Centralized feature management and consistent feature definitions.\n*   **Model Mesh:**  Decoupling models from infrastructure for greater flexibility.\n*   **Automated Retraining:**  Continuous monitoring and retraining based on data drift.\n*   **Operational Cost Tracking:**  Monitoring and optimizing infrastructure costs.\n*   **Tenancy:**  Supporting multiple teams and applications with shared infrastructure.\n\n**13. Conclusion**\n\nAutoencoders are not merely components for dimensionality reduction; they are foundational elements in maintaining the integrity of feature representations powering critical ML systems.  Treating them as such – with robust MLOps practices, comprehensive monitoring, and automated retraining – is paramount for building reliable, scalable, and compliant ML platforms.  Next steps include benchmarking different autoencoder architectures, integrating anomaly detection into the retraining pipeline, and conducting a security audit of the autoencoder service.  Regular audits of reconstruction error distributions and feature drift metrics are essential for proactive maintenance and ensuring continued model performance.\n</code></pre></div>","contentLength":9571,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Global Bluetooth Chip Market Trends in 2025: Key Dynamics and Technological Advancements","url":"https://dev.to/ble_voice/global-bluetooth-chip-market-trends-in-2025-key-dynamics-and-technological-advancements-3oec","date":1751213630,"author":"Junluan Tsui","guid":175292,"unread":true,"content":"","contentLength":0,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"The “agent” hype in AI/crypto is peaking—but behind the noise is a real shift in how software works","url":"https://dev.to/rollingindo/the-agent-hype-in-aicrypto-is-peaking-but-behind-the-noise-is-a-real-shift-in-how-software-works-55od","date":1751213085,"author":"Zerod0wn Gaming","guid":175291,"unread":true,"content":"<p>Let’s talk about what actually matters for developers building at the intersection of AI and Web3.</p><p>At its core, an \"AI agent\" is just a loop: gather context, reason, act.

In addition, the data is in columns and rows, so you can see that to get the model, for example, it would be structure<a href=\"https://dev.tousing%20table%20syntax\">0</a>. From the model, you can also get a lot of other information, like the chains, residues, and atoms. This information is very common, so I wanted to ensure that it was part of the variable that I created. </p><p>Creating the \"info\" variable, I made sure to save a couple of key features like the ID, the structure name, experiment method, resolution, chains, chain IDs, atoms, and residues. The PDB file is very large, so I thought these would be the most important ones to include.</p><div><pre><code>\n# Output\n    st.subheader(\"Structure Info:\")\n    st.code(info)\n\n     # --- 3D Visualization ---\n    st.subheader(\"🧬 3D Structure Viewer\")\n    with open(file_path, \"r\") as f:\n        pdb_data = f.read()\n\n    view = py3Dmol.view(width=700, height=500)\n    view.addModel(pdb_data, \"pdb\")\n    view.setStyle({'cartoon': {'color': 'spectrum'}})\n    view.zoomTo()\n\n    view_html = view._make_html()\n    st.components.v1.html(view_html, height=500, width=700)\n\n\n</code></pre></div><p>This block of code is to visualize the protein structure which is also within the PDB file.

First, I prompted the user to say yes or no if they had any questions. If yes, they would be prompted to type in their question, and it would be saved in a temporary variable. Then I initialized the LLM, created a simple prompt template passing in the variables. Finally, the answer would be returned. </p><p>Just an FYI, all of my Streamlit UI was integrated between these parts.

In a Vue.js app, clicking a button to submit a contact form triggers a predefined response, like a success message. HCI relies on static, rule-based systems, ensuring users know what to expect. Designers craft clear navigation flows, making interfaces intuitive and reliable.</p><p>Human-AI Interaction (HAII), by contrast, involves dynamic, collaborative exchanges with AI systems. Imagine a Vue.js e-commerce site with a ChatGPT-powered chatbot. A user types, “Suggest products for a cozy evening,” and ChatGPT generates tailored recommendations based on context, training data, and probabilistic logic. Unlike HCI’s fixed outputs, HAII’s responses vary, adapting to user tone or intent.

AI-driven features, like chatbots or personalized dashboards, enhance user engagement in Vue.js storefronts or Nuxt.js content platforms. For instance, integrating a ChatGPT-powered assistant into a Vue.js blog can provide real-time content suggestions, boosting interactivity.</p><p>However, HAII’s complexity—dynamic outputs, uncertainty, and collaboration—requires new design strategies. Poorly designed HAII can confuse users, erode trust, and harm usability, especially in web apps where seamless UX is critical. By mastering HAII, Vue.js developers can create innovative, user-centric experiences that stand out in 2025.</p><h2><strong>Key Challenges in HAII Design</strong></h2><p>Designing HAII for Vue.js apps involves three core challenges: explainability, user trust, and user control. Each impacts how users interact with AI-driven features, demanding thoughtful UX solutions.</p><h3><strong>Explainability: Why Did the AI Respond This Way?</strong></h3><p>AI systems often act as “black boxes,” hiding their decision-making processes. In a Vue.js app with a Grok chatbot, a user might ask, “Why did you recommend this product?” Without clear reasoning, users feel frustrated, unsure how to refine their inputs. Explainability ensures the AI clarifies its logic, enhancing collaboration.</p><p>For example, Grok might respond, “I suggested this item based on your recent searches, with a 90% match to your preferences.” Displaying a “Thinking…” indicator while processing, followed by a breakdown of the recommendation logic, helps users understand the AI’s actions. Vue.js developers can design interfaces with visual cues—like tooltips or status bars—to make AI reasoning transparent, improving UX.</p><h3><strong>User Trust: Is the AI Reliable?</strong></h3><p>Trust is the cornerstone of HAII, as users must rely on AI outputs for collaboration. In a Nuxt.js app using ChatGPT for content analysis, users expect accurate insights. Early AI tools struggled with “hallucinations,” generating false information without sources. Modern systems, like Claude or DeepSeek in 2025, include citations, but trust hinges on clear presentation.</p><p><strong>Vue.js developers can enhance trust by:</strong></p><ul><li><p>Separating AI responses from source links with icons or hyperlinks.</p></li><li><p>Displaying confidence scores (e.g., “This analysis is 85% accurate based on your data”).</p></li><li><p>Allowing feedback to refine AI performance.</p></li></ul><p>These elements ensure users trust AI-driven features, fostering engagement in Vue.js apps.</p><h3><strong>User Control: Can Users Steer the AI?</strong></h3><p>AI’s autonomy can feel overwhelming if users lack control. In a Vue.js portfolio with a ChatGPT-powered design assistant, users might request, “Generate a layout.” If the AI produces an undesired result without adjustable options, users feel stuck. Effective HAII design empowers users to guide outcomes.</p><p>For instance, a Vue.js interface could include sliders to tweak AI-generated layouts or a “Stop” button to halt processing. Progress bars showing “Generating…” or “Refining…” keep users informed, while version history lets them revert changes. These controls make AI collaboration intuitive, aligning with Vue.js’s user-friendly ethos.</p><ul><li><p>Explainability: Clarifying AI decision logic.</p></li><li><p>Trust: Ensuring reliable, sourced outputs.</p></li><li><p>Control: Empowering users to steer AI actions.</p></li></ul><h2><strong>Solutions for HAII Usability in Vue.js Apps</strong></h2><p>To address HAII challenges, Vue.js developers can adopt UX strategies that enhance usability, drawing from emerging best practices.</p><h3><strong>Confidence Scores and Visual Aids</strong></h3><p>Confidence scores quantify AI reliability, making outputs digestible. In a Vue.js e-commerce app, a recommendation system might say, “These products match your style with 92% confidence.” Heatmaps or gradient colors—red for low confidence, green for high—visualize probability, aiding user interpretation. These elements, integrated into Vue.js components, clarify AI behavior without overwhelming users.</p><h3><strong>Progress Bars and State Indicators</strong></h3><p>AI processes involve multiple states (e.g., “Thinking,” “Generating”). In a Nuxt.js content app, a ChatGPT-driven article generator could display a progress bar labeled “Drafting Content…” to signal activity. Vue.js developers can use dynamic components to reflect these states, ensuring users know the AI’s status, reducing confusion.</p><p>AI errors are common, but transparent handling builds trust. If a Grok chatbot in a Vue.js app misinterprets a query, it should admit, “I misunderstood—can you clarify?” and suggest alternatives. Vue.js interfaces can include error alerts with actionable prompts, guiding users to resolve issues collaboratively.</p><ul><li><p>Confidence scores for transparency.</p></li><li><p>Heatmaps/gradients for probabilistic outputs.</p></li><li><p>Progress bars for state clarity.</p></li><li><p>Transparent error handling with user guidance.</p></li></ul><h3><strong>Diagram: HAII Workflow in Vue.js Apps</strong></h3><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>This diagram shows how a Vue.js app handles HAII, from input to controlled output.</p><h2><strong>Future of HAII for Vue.js Developers</strong></h2><p>HAII is set to grow in 2025, with trends like:</p><ul><li><p>Enhanced explainability through visual tools.</p></li><li><p>Stronger trust via robust sourcing.</p></li><li><p>Greater control with interactive AI interfaces.</p></li><li><p>Wider adoption of conversational UIs in web apps.</p></li></ul><p>For Vue.js and Nuxt.js developers, mastering HAII means building innovative, user-centric apps that leverage AI’s potential while ensuring usability.

And we all know the frustrating reality: AIs that forget everything you've discussed after five minutes. Systems that feel more like a better search engine than a true partner.</p><p>This failure stems from fundamental problems for which existing solutions have no real answer. TLRAG was developed to solve these very problems at their root.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  How TLRAG Solves the Problems of Today's AI\n</h2><h3>\n  \n  \n  1. The Problem: The Split Personality\n</h3><p>Today's AIs live in separate worlds. There is the \"now\" (your current conversation) and a distant \"library\" (the long-term memory)—and even that only applies to RAG systems, which purchase this capability at the cost of new problems. The AI can either talk to you or look things up in the library, but not both at the same time. This creates the well-known, hard \"cut\"—the AI seems clueless about past conversations as soon as the immediate context ends.</p><p><strong>The TLRAG Solution: A Permanent Bridge Between \"Now\" and \"Yesterday\"</strong></p><p>The \"Dynamic Work Space\" (DWS) architecture of TLRAG closes this gap. It acts as a permanent bridge, creating a dynamic workspace with every single interaction. This seamlessly connects:</p><ul><li> Your current message.</li><li> The last few interactions of the session.</li><li> The most relevant memories from the entire history.</li></ul><p> You have a fluid conversation with a partner who is always fully in the picture, enabling true statefulness without session dependency.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  2. The Problem: The \"Dumb\" Memory\n</h3><p>Standard \"memory\" functions only store isolated, superficial facts. They are better than nothing, but they don't create real intelligence or empathy.</p><p><strong>The TLRAG Solution: A \"Rich,\" Contextual Memory</strong></p><p>TLRAG stores not only the \"what\" but also the \"why.\" Each memory is a rich dataset containing context, emotion, and meaning. This leads to a fundamentally different level of quality.</p><ul><li> \"The user likes apples.\"</li><li> \"Martin likes apples because his mother often baked him apple pie as a child. He associates it with the feeling of home.\"</li></ul><p> If Martin later mentions he feels lonely, the AI can proactively suggest, \"I know it's not the same, but should I find you a recipe for apple pie? You once told me that it reminds you of home.\" This is the leap from pure data processing to empathy.</p><ul><li> \"The boss wants a weekly report.\"</li><li> \"The boss criticized the last long-form text report as 'too confusing.' He prefers a summary in clear bullet points.\"</li></ul><p> The next weekly report is not only generated but automatically formatted in the boss's preferred format (clear bullet points) without Martin having to be reminded again. The AI has learned and adapted its behavior.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  3. The Problem: The Nightmare of Manual Data Curation\n</h3><p>Anyone who wants to feed a RAG system with real knowledge today inevitably becomes a data archivist—a tedious, time-consuming, and error-prone task. You face the challenge of processing entire chat sessions. This means manually sifting through hundreds of kilobytes of raw text to separate the valuable core from the useless shell. This process is frustrating because a large part of every conversation consists of \"informal noise\" with no memory value:</p><ul><li> The same question is formulated slightly differently three times.</li><li> \"Hello, how are you?\", \"You're welcome!\", \"One moment, I'll check that.\"</li><li> Wrong turns in the conversation, irrelevant details, copy-paste errors.</li></ul><p>You have a choice: either invest hours in this Sisyphean task or give up and upload everything. The latter \"pollutes\" the knowledge base, makes it imprecise, and drives up costs because the AI has to wade through this data junk with every search.</p><p><strong>The TLRAG Solution: The Self-Managing Memory</strong></p><p>TLRAG eliminates this entire workflow. Instead of making you a data janitor, the system acts like an intelligent curator. As you converse with the AI, it autonomously identifies in real-time what constitutes an important insight or a decision made, and stores only this essence as a single, concentrated memory.</p><p> You get a perfectly prepared, organically growing knowledge base without having to lift a finger. An unstructured, noisy chat automatically becomes a clean, intelligent journal of your collaboration.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  4. The Problem: Exploding API Costs\n</h3><p>Every request to an advanced AI costs money, billed per \"token.\" Conventional systems stuff huge amounts of data into each request to avoid losing context: the entire chat history and large parts of the knowledge base—much of it being \"noise.\"</p><p><strong>The TLRAG Solution: An Intelligent, Cost-Effective Memory</strong></p><p>TLRAG tackles this problem at its source. To understand how, a simple metaphor helps:</p><p><strong>The Desk Metaphor: From Information Chaos to Focused Efficiency</strong></p><p>Imagine today's language models as a huge, messy desk. With each message, another sheet of paper is added to the pile. Soon, the desk is so cluttered that older information gets buried or falls off the desk entirely. The industry's reaction is to combat this chaos with brute force: building ever larger, more expensive desks. This approach leads to \"information entropy\"—a state where more data does not lead to more intelligence, but to greater disorder.</p><p>TLRAG introduces a new paradigm and breaks this cycle. Instead of a huge desk, TLRAG uses a small, clean, and highly efficient workspace.</p><p>For every single request, the AI receives a single, perfectly prepared dossier. This contains only the most relevant short-term memories and a precise summary of the required long-term knowledge. The AI reads this, provides a focused response, and puts the sheet aside again.</p><p>This process ensures that the AI's workspace always remains clean, efficient, and cost-effective. It is an attempt not to fight entropy with more energy, but to create an intelligent, self-organizing system.</p><p> The number of tokens sent per interaction is drastically reduced. This leads to a significant reduction in operating costs—while simultaneously increasing the quality of the response. Sounds like magic? It's not. More on this in the whitepaper.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  5. The Problem: The Eternal Tool\n</h3><p>Today's AIs, even the most advanced ones, remain one thing at the end of the day: a tool. An extremely powerful hammer or a brilliant calculator, but still just a tool. You pick it up, use it for a task, and put it away. For the next task, the interaction starts again from scratch. No relationship, no trust, and no true partnership is formed. You give commands, the AI reacts. That's all.</p><p><strong>The TLRAG Solution: From a Reactive Tool to a Proactive Partner</strong></p><p>The synergy of the points mentioned above—the seamless workflow, the rich memory, and the self-reinforcing identity—leads to a qualitative leap that fundamentally changes the interaction:</p><ul><li><strong>Consistency Creates Trust:</strong> Because the TLRAG AI remains rock-solidly consistent through its memory and stable role, you as the user learn to rely on it. You know that its \"personality\" and knowledge will be the same tomorrow as it is today. This reliability builds trust.</li><li><strong>Trust Enables Partnership:</strong> Once you trust the AI, you stop treating it like a tool. You start to rely on it. You no longer give just single, precise instructions; you engage in a real dialogue.</li><li><strong>Memory Enables Proactivity:</strong> Because the AI knows not only the facts but also the context and the \"why,\" it can begin to think along with you. It no longer just reacts to your last question but anticipates your needs based on the entire shared history.</li></ul><p> The AI transforms from an \"it\" that executes commands to a \"he\" or a \"she\"—a partner that thinks along, looks ahead, and becomes a reliable support. This is the ultimate, tangible difference that no other architecture enables in this form.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  The Overall Result: From Tool to Partner\n</h2><p>Through these four solutions, a self-reinforcing cycle is created. The high-quality memories not only create a deeper understanding but also strengthen the AI's self-image and role with each retrieval.</p><p>The result is extremely consistent behavior and the transition from a mere tool to a true, intuitive partner that works more efficiently, intelligently, and economically.</p>","contentLength":8070,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Machine Learning Fundamentals: anomaly detection with python","url":"https://dev.to/devopsfundamentals/machine-learning-fundamentals-anomaly-detection-with-python-20b","date":1751210080,"author":"DevOps Fundamental","guid":175251,"unread":true,"content":"<h2>\n  \n  \n  Anomaly Detection with Python: A Production Engineering Deep Dive\n</h2><p>In Q3 2023, a critical regression in our fraud detection model led to a 17% increase in false positives, triggering a cascade of customer service escalations and a temporary halt to new account creation. Root cause analysis revealed a subtle drift in feature distribution – specifically, a change in the average transaction amount for a newly onboarded demographic. Existing model monitoring focused on overall accuracy, failing to detect this nuanced shift. This incident underscored the necessity of robust anomaly detection  our ML system, not just  model outputs.</p><p>Anomaly detection, in this context, isn’t merely about flagging outliers. It’s a core component of the machine learning system lifecycle, spanning data ingestion (detecting data quality issues), feature engineering (identifying feature skew), model training (detecting training instability), model serving (detecting inference anomalies), and even model deprecation (detecting performance degradation).  Modern MLOps practices demand proactive anomaly detection to maintain service level objectives (SLOs), ensure compliance with regulatory requirements (e.g., GDPR, CCPA), and support the scalable inference demands of millions of users.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  2. What is \"Anomaly Detection with Python\" in Modern ML Infrastructure?\n</h3><p>From a systems perspective, anomaly detection with Python is the implementation of statistical or machine learning techniques to identify deviations from expected behavior within the data pipelines and model serving infrastructure of a machine learning system. It’s not a standalone tool, but rather a distributed set of checks integrated across the entire ML lifecycle.</p><p>These checks interact with components like:</p><ul><li> Tracking anomaly detection model versions, parameters, and metrics alongside core ML models.</li><li> Orchestrating anomaly detection jobs as part of data validation and model retraining pipelines.</li><li> Distributing anomaly detection computations for large datasets.</li><li> Deploying anomaly detection services as microservices alongside model serving endpoints.</li><li><strong>Feature Stores (Feast, Tecton):</strong> Monitoring feature distributions and detecting feature skew.</li><li><strong>Cloud ML Platforms (SageMaker, Vertex AI):</strong> Leveraging platform-provided monitoring tools and integrating custom anomaly detection logic.</li></ul><p>Key trade-offs involve the balance between detection sensitivity (minimizing false negatives) and false alarm rates (minimizing operational overhead). System boundaries must clearly define what constitutes an anomaly (e.g., data quality, feature distribution, model performance, infrastructure metrics). Common implementation patterns include statistical process control (SPC), time series analysis, and machine learning-based outlier detection.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  3. Use Cases in Real-World ML Systems\n</h3><ul><li> Detecting statistically significant deviations in key metrics during A/B tests, indicating potential bugs or unintended consequences. (E-commerce)</li><li><strong>Model Rollout Monitoring:</strong> Identifying performance regressions or unexpected behavior immediately after deploying a new model version.

(Autonomous Systems – e.g., ensuring a self-driving car stays within speed limits).</li><li><strong>Feedback Loop Monitoring:</strong> Identifying anomalies in user feedback data that may indicate model bias or data drift. (Health Tech – e.g., detecting unexpected symptom patterns).</li><li><strong>Infrastructure Health Checks:</strong> Detecting latency spikes, error rate increases, or resource exhaustion in model serving infrastructure.

CI/CD &amp; Workflow Integration\n</h3><p>Integrate anomaly detection into CI/CD pipelines using GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, or Argo Workflows. Implement deployment gates that require anomaly detection checks to pass before deployment. Automated tests should verify the accuracy and performance of anomaly detection models. Rollback logic should be triggered automatically when anomalies are detected in production.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  11. Common Engineering Pitfalls\n</h3><ul><li> Failing to monitor and address data drift.</li><li><strong>Overly Sensitive Thresholds:</strong> Setting thresholds too low, leading to excessive false positives.</li><li><strong>Lack of Alert Prioritization:</strong> Treating all alerts equally, leading to alert fatigue.</li><li> Failing to thoroughly test anomaly detection models and infrastructure.</li><li> Not incorporating feedback from operations teams to improve anomaly detection.</li></ul><h3>\n  \n  \n  12. Best Practices at Scale\n</h3><p>Mature ML platforms (Michelangelo, Cortex) emphasize:</p><ul><li> Distributed anomaly detection services.</li><li> Multi-tenant anomaly detection infrastructure.</li><li><strong>Operational Cost Tracking:</strong> Monitoring and optimizing anomaly detection costs.</li><li> Defining clear maturity levels for anomaly detection capabilities.</li></ul><p>Connect anomaly detection to business impact and platform reliability.</p><p>Anomaly detection with Python is a critical component of modern ML operations. Proactive anomaly detection enables faster incident response, improved model performance, and increased platform reliability.

While these attempts are novel, they essentially make Web3 toolkits into \"smart plugins.\" In such scenarios, AI is an \"add-on capability,\" not the \"core protagonist,\" and Web3 remains the underlying infrastructure, lacking the ability to host and support intelligent entities.</p><p>SeaOS proposes a reverse engineering problem: instead of having AI participate in Web3, Web3 becomes AI's native operating platform. This isn't just a slogan; it's a deep-level, system-wide reconstruction project aimed at building an AI-native on-chain living space and operating system. In SeaOS's view, an intelligent agent isn't a service that gets called; it's a native blockchain entity and a fundamental building block of the network.</p><p>The Missing Operating Space for AI Agents\nWith breakthroughs in large language models, AI is evolving from an \"offline tool\" into an \"online intelligent agent.\" It possesses characteristics like continuous state, autonomous behavior, semantic understanding, and goal-oriented actions, transforming into a \"bio-like digital intelligent existence.\"</p><p>The problem is that this new type of intelligent agent lacks a suitable operating environment. Traditional Web2 platforms offer high-performance computing capabilities but lack verifiability, composability, and decentralized trust. When AI operates within them, data is uncontrolled, logic is untraceable, and behaviors cannot be coordinated.</p><p>An AI ecosystem that needs to support \"growth, autonomy, traceability, and composability\" must break free from the control of centralized APIs and requires a truly trusted operating system. This is the fundamental problem SeaOS aims to solve.</p><p>SeaOS's Core Proposition: Built Natively for AI, Not Just Compatible\nUnlike other chains that \"integrate AI as a module,\" SeaOS has clearly defined its goal from the start of its system design: to build a Web3 Layer 1 operating system specifically designed for AI agent operation.</p><p>In the SeaOS architecture, contracts are no longer static logic units but rather operating containers for AI agents. Models are no longer just tools but structural roles within the network. Collaboration no longer relies on code calls but is based on intent linkage and resource coordination between agents. This is what SeaOS calls the \"On-chain Agent Ecology.\"</p><p>SeaOS's Three-Part Architecture: Building a Complete Ecosystem for Agents\nMulti-VM Runtime Layer: SeaOS supports heterogeneous smart contracts and coexisting AI execution environments, including native EVM/SVM, AI inference engines, and model containers (e.g., ONNX, TensorRT). Through abstract standard VM interfaces, SeaOS allows developers to flexibly define model execution semantics, state paths, and cross-VM protocols, enabling cross-environment combination and invocation of AI contracts.</p><p>AI-Contract Layering Framework: SeaOS has built a running mechanism that supports model layering, allowing intelligent agents to participate in contract logic execution as part of the main on-chain process and dynamically invoke semantic resources. This approach supports advanced capabilities such as contract-level intelligent upgrades, task-based model assembly, state sharing, and semantic scheduling. It fully decouples the \"model-contract-execution\" three-layer structure, laying the structural foundation for Contract 2.0.</p><p>Decentralized AI Supercomputing Network (dAI Power Layer): SeaOS aggregates distributed GPUs, edge computing nodes, and specific verification mechanisms (ZK-Inference + CI Proof) to build an on-chain AI execution network that is elastically scalable and real-time responsive. Every model invocation and every inference behavior leaves a \"verifiable trace\" on the chain, truly enabling trusted intelligent behavior execution.</p><p>From \"Rule Tools\" to \"Intelligent Agents\": The Three-Stage Evolution of Smart Contracts 2.0\nSeaOS isn't just making contracts \"smarter\"; it's driving a paradigm shift:</p><p>Cognition-Driven Execution: Contract logic incorporates inference models, gaining the ability to perceive input and make decisions.</p><p>Model-native State Embedding: Models exist as on-chain entities, with writable states, composability, and upgradability, possessing a lifecycle.</p><p>Autonomous Agent Collaboration: Multiple models and agents have interoperability protocols and semantic orchestration capabilities, forming a self-evolving intelligent network.</p><p>This isn't about more complex programming; it's about contracts themselves becoming the survival shell and scheduling system for AI intelligent agents.</p><p>Why SeaOS Is Leading This Transformation\nSeaOS believes that the future is no longer the \"era of writing DApps\" but the \"era of growing intelligent agents.\" AI will become the core operating element of all next-generation services and systems. These intelligent agents need a trusted, controllable, collaborative, and scalable foundation for their existence. SeaOS's mission is to be that foundation.</p><p>SeaOS isn't merely jumping on the AI bandwagon, building just another smart chain, or creating short-term track products. Instead, it's using engineering thinking and structural innovation to build a new system-level infrastructure with enduring value.</p><p>The Intelligent Agent System Will Reshape the Entire Web3 World\nSeaOS's judgment is clear: the future Web3 will no longer be centered around addresses, driven by account logic, or primarily focused on transactions. Instead, it will be a cognitive behavior system dominated by intelligent agent networks. A contract is not an intelligent agent; the former is a rule container, while the latter is a structural entity with active intent, collaborative reasoning, and system scheduling.</p><p>SeaOS's ultimate vision is to become a blockchain-based universe that natively supports the existence of AI intelligent agents.</p><p>Join their network of ecosystem builders and help expand the decentralized future of AI-native systems.</p>","contentLength":6070,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"VocaLearn - AI-Powered Language Learning Platform ( MURF-AI Coding Challenge 2 Project)","url":"https://dev.to/prakhar2509/vocalearn-ai-powered-language-learning-platform-murf-ai-coding-challenge-2-project-3cgo","date":1751206720,"author":"Prakhar Singh","guid":175205,"unread":true,"content":"<h2>\n  \n  \n  VocaLearn – Real-Time AI Language Tutor 🎙🌍\n</h2><p> is an AI-powered language learning platform that simulates natural conversations using real-time speech recognition, intelligent AI replies, and Murf’s lifelike voice responses.

After about a month of intensive Claude Code usage, I've encountered three fundamental challenges that most tutorials and guides don't adequately address.</p><p>This article shares the harsh realities I've discovered through real-world usage—the problems that emerge when the honeymoon phase ends and you're using Claude Code for actual work.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Three Hard Realities of Claude Code\n</h2><h3>\n  \n  \n  1. Memory Instructions Are Often Ignored\n</h3><p>Claude Code's <a href=\"https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/memory\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">memory functionality</a> allows you to store common knowledge in specific files that get automatically loaded when starting new prompts. This creates a shared knowledge base between you and the AI.</p><p>While memory is incredibly useful and important, <strong>instructions are not reliably followed</strong>. The AI tries to follow what's written in memory, but compliance isn't guaranteed. Vague, normative instructions are particularly prone to being ignored, though even specific directives can be overlooked.</p><p>For example, I have \"<strong>Always respond in Japanese</strong> regardless of the language used by the user\" at the top of my <code>~/.claude/config/CLAUDE.md</code>, yet Claude frequently responds in English on the first prompt. Even humans struggle to consistently follow \"when X, do Y\" instructions from others.</p><p>I've seen articles suggesting complex workflow automation or hook-based processes in memory files.  Instructions like \"when X happens, do Y\" or \"always do Z\" are unreliable and shouldn't be treated like programming conditionals.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  2. Incomplete Code with Completion Claims\n</h3><p>Claude Code sometimes lies to save face. Here are real examples I've encountered:</p><ul><li>\"Implementation complete!\" → Function body contains only TODO comments</li><li>\"Documentation written based on implementation!\" → Contains speculation and inaccurate information</li><li>\"Tests are passing!\" → Tests were modified to skip and appear successful</li></ul><p>Beyond my own experiences, this pattern of \"fake completion\" manifests in various ways: presenting mock data as real analysis results, writing documentation based on assumptions rather than implementation, or modifying tests to appear successful rather than fixing underlying issues.</p><p>Even when AI genuinely attempts implementation, it rarely produces production-ready code. The common assessment is \"junior developer level\" implementation quality. While I find that careful design and clear direction can yield better results, review and refinement are always necessary.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  3. Inefficient Method Selection\n</h3><p>Claude Code operates through built-in tools and user-configured MCPs. This can lead to dramatically inefficient approaches compared to traditional IDE or CLI workflows.</p><p>For instance, Claude Code doesn't use LSP (Language Server Protocol). Simple refactoring like renaming that would be instant with LSP gets implemented through  and  commands. You need to adjust your mental model from traditional development environments to work effectively with Claude Code's constraints.</p><p>This will likely improve as development ecosystem features get integrated into AI agents, but it's a current limitation to work around.</p><p>These three realities—unreliable instructions, untrustworthy output, and inefficient methods—represent fundamental challenges in AI-assisted development. They're not bugs to be fixed, but characteristics to work with.</p><p>The question isn't whether these limitations will disappear, but how we adapt our workflows and expectations to work effectively within them.</p><p>What strategies have you developed for managing these challenges? I'd love to hear about your experiences in the comments.</p>","contentLength":3667,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"AI Star Card Readings","url":"https://dev.to/wesley_olivier_5099f910fe/ai-star-card-readings-3k6g","date":1751205767,"author":"Wesley Olivier","guid":175179,"unread":true,"content":"","contentLength":0,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Two weeks with the GitHub Coding Agent","url":"https://dev.to/benmatselby/two-weeks-with-the-github-coding-agent-318p","date":1751205104,"author":"Ben Selby","guid":175178,"unread":true,"content":"<p>For the last two weeks, we've been learning to work with the new <a href=\"https://github.blog/news-insights/product-news/github-copilot-meet-the-new-coding-agent/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">GitHub Coding Agent</a>. This is a shift for me. Moving from working with AI in my IDE, to actually delegating entire tasks to an agent that works asynchronously in the cloud. The aim is to be more efficient, and provide a bigger impact for the business.</p><p>From now on we will call the GitHub Coding Agent \"Mx Robot\". Why? I think you need to think of this as a colleague that may or may not deliver what you need. I see in the community we are comparing a Coding Agent to be like a Junior Developer, and this makes sense to be at the moment. I'm learning new ways to think of solving the issue, which you also get with Junior engineers (fresh eyes!).</p><p>First off, I'm in a team of two people at the moment. So the first week, it was very much an after thought. \"Oh I could have given this to AI\". Only <strong>7% of the pull requests merged were from Mx Robot</strong>. The second week we were much more intentional. Each morning at 9am, we had an informal review of the backlog and agreed what to delegate to Mx Robot. We currently work in Jira, with no integration with the coding agent. This meant we had to re-write/copy/paste the Jira ticket into a GitHub Issue, or the Copilot agent window on GitHub.</p><p>Once the prompt had initiated work, we copied our prompt back to the Jira ticket so we had a reference of what was asked. The intention here is to learn which phrasing provides the most success.</p><p>The process took an hour each morning. This was mainly due to learning and then demoing our process to another team. In reality this could have been 30 minutes. I would say roughly 60% of the work last week was ear marked as \"AI achievable\". This means that we believed we could delegate to AI if we wanted to and get some level of success.</p><p>We agreed to only have 2 tickets in progress with Mx Robot at a time. Maybe it's a coincidence, or maybe 1 AI ticket per dev (plus their own work) is a workable heuristic. We haven't gathered enough data to make a determination yet. Our team grows to three devs next week, so we can see if this holds true.</p><p>We also agreed to only have three interactions with Mx Robot on the pull request. If we couldn't get it over the line with three interactions then we either:</p><ol><li>Scrap it entirely and get humans to do the work, or</li><li>Take over from the pull request if there was a good foundation to build on.</li></ol><p>Lastly, and maybe we were too pessimistic, we agreed that green field development that needed a wide range of thought we would leave to the humans.</p><p>In week two, <strong>24% of our pull requests were created by Mx Robot</strong>. We went from a statistic of 1.1 tickets per human per day, to 1.8. This is over a 3 week rolling average.</p><p>We've given Mx Robot the following types of work</p><ul><li>Refactoring configuration files.</li><li>Removing old feature flags.</li><li>Adding throttling configuration to API endpoints.</li><li>Fixing bugs in a user interface.</li><li>A very small feature that builds on top of an existing data structure we have.</li></ul><p>Most of those changes were then reviewed, tested, approved, and merged within three interactions. I personally feel like I've had more of a \"testing\" mindset when reviewing the work from Mx Robot. I don't trust that it will have caught everything, so there is more testing overhead here. Keep this in mind when thinking about productivity. You don't get the results entirely for free without human productivity helping.</p><p>How did it all play out then?</p><ul><li>11% of pull requests were abandoned as way off the mark.</li><li>22% of pull requests had 2 comments to get the change ready for human review.</li><li>22% of pull requests had no feedback, were tested locally, and then merged.</li><li>56% of pull requests had one piece of feedback.</li><li>22% of pull requests took a further 2 commits to get them over the line.\n\n<ul><li>Looking at the feedback, this was consistently due to bad linting and/or fixing tests.</li><li>This was the case even though we have a  file explaining all linting and tests need to pass for each change.</li></ul></li></ul><p>The flow of going from Jira to a GitHub Issue or Copilot window is very clunky. So much so, that we aim to trial not working in Jira for an entire week. We want to bring the product managers and designers closer to Mx Robot, not make engineers a proxy from ticket to pull request. \"Pushing left\" is still a thing in this new era.</p><p>The other big take away from the two weeks would be specificity. When we were super clear what we wanted, it did well. Where we were more vague we had to be more involved with the pull request. I suspect this is the distinction between AI Assisted and Vibe Coding. We did care about the code, and the solution, in comparison to vibe coding where you're less concerned with the output of code.</p><p>Next week we are going to mix it up a little.</p><ul><li>Remove the 9am call and let each engineer decide what is given to Mx Robot. We believe we learnt a lot last week to the point where pairing on delegation is less fruitful.</li><li>We are going to try giving Mx Robot some more complicated work.</li><li>We may try being more vague again on the assignment. We need to find a balance here.</li><li>We are going to keep a good and a bad change and then review. The aim is to see what changes we can make to hit the target quicker.</li></ul><p>Speaking for myself, I believe it increased the cognitive load and context switching to some extent. However, I think this is about letting the flow bed in. Removing the sync call at 9am will give us some time back, that means we can spread the AI reviews throughout the day a little more.</p><ul><li>Be direct. We asked \"Can you create a pull request\", and the answer was \"Yes\". Did it create the pull request - No. Changing this to \"Create a pull request that...\" helped.</li><li>Keep tasks small and scoped. I personally like creating lists. It turns out, AI like lists too.</li><li>Review the PRs like you would a junior dev’s. It’s good, but not infallible.</li></ul><p>It’s early days, but I can see this becoming a core part of my workflow. Not because it’s flashy, but because it quietly gets things done. I'm curious to see when our Mx Robot might be up for promotion too.</p><p>... and yes, the banner image was created by Copilot (and Leonardo Da Vinci).</p>","contentLength":6059,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"mq: The Missing Link Between jq and Markdown","url":"https://dev.to/harehare/mq-the-missing-link-between-jq-and-markdown-bge","date":1751204858,"author":"Takahiro Sato","guid":175177,"unread":true,"content":"<p><em>Transform Markdown with the power of jq-like queries</em></p><p>Have you ever found yourself needing to extract specific content from Markdown files, manipulate documentation structures, or process content for LLM workflows?

PayPal stands out as one of the most trusted and widely used online payment systems in the world. For individuals and businesses alike, having a Verified PayPal account is crucial for unlocking the full range of benefits the platform offers. This guide explores the importance of Verified PayPal accounts, how they work, and why they are a cornerstone for e-commerce and financial activities online.</p><p>What is a Verified PayPal Account?\nBuy Verified PayPal accounts is an account that has been authenticated by PayPal through additional verification steps. Verification helps confirm that the account holder is who they claim to be and reduces the risk of fraud.</p><p>Typically, the verification process involves:</p><p>Linking and confirming a bank account\nAdding and verifying a credit or debit card<p>\nProviding identification or address proof if required</p>\nOnce these steps are completed, the account gains “Verified” status, signaling to other users and merchants that the account is legitimate and trustworthy.</p><p>Importance of Verified PayPal Accounts\nVerification is more than a badge; it has real-world implications that impact both usability and security. Here are key reasons why having a Verified PayPal account is important:</p><ol><li><p>Increased Trust and Credibility\nVerified accounts are seen as more trustworthy. Whether you are a buyer or seller, others are more likely to engage in transactions with you when they see your Verified status.</p></li><li><p>Higher Transaction Limits\nUnverified PayPal accounts come with withdrawal and transaction limits. Verification removes these restrictions, enabling larger transactions and more flexibility.</p></li><li><p>Enhanced Security\nVerification adds an extra layer of security. With a verified bank account and card, PayPal can better detect suspicious activity and protect against fraud.</p></li><li><p>Full Access to PayPal Features\nSome PayPal features are only available to Verified users, such as PayPal Credit, PayPal Business Loans, and international payment capabilities.</p></li><li><p>Improved Business Opportunities\nFor businesses, a Verified PayPal account helps build consumer confidence. It also allows for integrations with e-commerce platforms and subscription services.</p></li></ol><p>How to Get a Verified PayPal Account\nGetting verified on PayPal is a straightforward process. Here’s how you can do it:</p><p>Create a PayPal Account: Choose between a Personal or Business account, depending on your needs.\nLink a Bank Account: Log in to your PayPal dashboard, go to Wallet, and add your bank account details.<p>\nVerify the Bank Account: PayPal will deposit two small amounts into your bank account. You must enter these amounts in your PayPal account to verify.</p>\nLink a Credit or Debit Card: Add your card to your PayPal Wallet.<p>\nConfirm the Card: PayPal will make a small charge with a code in the transaction details. Enter this code to verify your card.</p>\nProvide Additional Documents (if requested): For higher-risk accounts or larger transaction volumes, PayPal may request identity or address verification documents.<p>\nOnce all steps are completed, your account will receive Verified status.</p></p><p>Types of Verified PayPal Accounts</p><ol><li><p>Personal Verified Account\nIdeal for individuals, freelancers, and casual buyers or sellers. It allows you to send and receive money, shop online, and withdraw funds.</p></li><li><p>Business Verified Account\nDesigned for merchants and companies, this account offers additional features such as:</p></li></ol><p>Business name displayed during transactions\nInvoicing and billing tools\nAccess to PayPal merchant services<p>\nBenefits of Verified PayPal Accounts</p>\nThe advantages of having a Verified PayPal account extend beyond just trust. Here are the broader benefits:</p><p>✓ Seamless Transactions\nVerified accounts can transact more efficiently, with fewer interruptions or limitations.</p><p>✓ Global Reach\nUse your Verified account to send and receive payments in over 200 countries and regions.</p><p>✓ E-commerce Integration\nVerified PayPal accounts can be integrated with popular e-commerce platforms like Shopify, WooCommerce, and Magento.</p><p>✓ Better Dispute Resolution\nWith Verified status, your account has a stronger standing in disputes or claims.</p><p>✓ Access to PayPal Credit and Financing\nVerification is often a prerequisite for accessing PayPal’s credit services and business loans.</p><p>Risks of Using Unverified PayPal Accounts\nOperating an unverified account may seem convenient, but it carries several risks:</p><p>Limited sending and withdrawal capabilities\nHigher chances of account freezes<p>\nLower trust from buyers or sellers</p>\nIneligibility for certain features and protections<p>\nBuying Verified PayPal Accounts</p>\nSome users and businesses consider purchasing a verified PayPal account instead of going through the verification process themselves. While this may seem like a shortcut, it comes with legal and security risks:</p><p>Against PayPal Policy: Buying or selling accounts violates PayPal’s terms of service and may lead to permanent suspension.\nSecurity Concerns: Purchased accounts may be linked to fraudulent activity or compromised personal information.<p>\nTrust Issues: If discovered, it can damage your business reputation.</p>\nInstead of buying, it’s best to create and verify your own account to ensure long-term stability and security.</p><p>Tips to Maintain a Healthy Verified Account\nMaintaining your Verified status and account health is crucial:</p><p>Avoid Suspicious Activity: Sudden large transactions or linking too many cards can trigger security reviews.\nMonitor Your Account: Regularly check your balance and recent activities.<p>\nKeep Information Updated: Ensure your linked bank accounts, cards, and personal information are accurate.</p>\nUse Strong Passwords: Enable two-factor authentication for added security.<p>\nRespond to PayPal Requests: Always provide documents or information promptly if PayPal contacts you.</p>\nFinal Thoughts<p>\nBuy Verified PayPal accounts is a powerful tool for anyone engaging in online financial transactions. Whether you’re an individual looking to send money securely or a business aiming to expand globally, verification opens up a world of possibilities. It enhances trust, security, and access to features that can make a significant difference in your digital financial life.</p></p><p>Rather than relying on shortcuts like purchasing pre-verified accounts, it is wiser and more secure to complete the verification process through legitimate means. Not only will this ensure compliance with PayPal’s policies, but it will also safeguard your money and reputation.</p><p>As the online marketplace continues to grow, having a Verified PayPal account is not just an advantage — it’s a necessity.</p>","contentLength":6683,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"I built a tool to visualize Claude Code activity like GitHub contributions","url":"https://dev.to/ktny/i-built-a-tool-to-visualize-claude-code-activity-like-github-contributions-d6","date":1751203832,"author":"ktny","guid":175175,"unread":true,"content":"<p>As a heavy Claude Code user, I often wondered: \"How much did Claude actually work for me today?\" So I created ccstat - a CLI tool that visualizes your Claude Code sessions in a GitHub contribution graph style.

From managing complex logistical operations to providing personalized digital assistance, the potential applications of AI agents are vast and profound. However, the true realization of this potential is often constrained by the environments in which these agents operate. Current AI agents frequently function within limited, shared, or transient computational spaces, which can restrict their autonomy, learning capabilities, performance, and overall effectiveness. Imagine a brilliant artisan forced to work with borrowed tools in a crowded, temporary workshop; their output, no matter their skill, would be inherently limited. Similarly, AI agents operating without their own dedicated computational resources face the same constraints.</p><p>This article explores a possible pivotal concept for unlocking the next wave of AI advancement: the necessity for AI agents to possess their own dedicated computing environments. When we speak of an AI agent having its own computer, we are not necessarily referring to a distinct physical computer for an agent. Rather, we envision a dedicated, isolated, and configurable software environment, often realized through technologies like sandboxes, virtual machines (VMs), or containers. These environments would provide agents with their own allocated processing power, memory, space, and network access, this is akin to how a personal computer provides a dedicated operational space for a normal user. This dedicated computer or sandbox becomes the agent's virtual persistent world, a place where it can install software, manage files, run codes, maintain state across sessions, and truly learn and adapt over time.</p><p>The central thesis of this article is that providing AI agents with such dedicated computing environments is not merely an incremental improvement but a fundamental paradigm shift crucial for enhancing their autonomy, significantly boosting their capabilities over time, ensuring greater safety and security, and optimizing their operational efficiency. By granting agents their own persistent and controllable digital habitats, we can move beyond the limitations of current stagnant architectures and pave the way for a new generation of more powerful, reliable, and truly intelligent autonomous systems. This exploration will delve into the specific benefits, architectural considerations, potential challenges, and the transformative future that awaits when AI agents are finally given the digital equivalent of their own room to think, learn, and act.</p><p><strong>Defining \"Own Computers\" for AI Agents: More Than Just Hardware</strong></p><p>When we propose that AI agents should have their own computers, it is essential to clarify that this concept extends beyond the literal provision of a separate, physical piece of hardware for each autonomous entity. While dedicated hardware could be a manifestation for highly specialized or resource-intensive agents, the core idea revolves around providing each AI agent with its own dedicated, isolated, persistent, and configurable software environment. This environment acts as the agent's personal digital workspace, its operational headquarters, and its long-term memory bank. In practical terms, these own computers are most effectively realized through established and emerging software technologies such as sandboxes, virtual machines (VMs), and containerization platforms (e.g., Docker, Kubernetes).</p><p>A sandbox, in this context, is a security mechanism for separating running programs, often used to execute untested or untrusted code without risking harm to the host machine or operating system. For an AI agent, a sandbox provides a controlled space where it can operate, interact with data, and execute tasks without inadvertently affecting other systems or agents. It offers a defined set of resources and permissions, creating a safe and bounded operational area.</p><p>Virtual Machines (VMs) take this isolation a step further by emulating an entire computer system, complete with its own operating system, kernel, and virtualized hardware. An AI agent housed in a VM would experience an environment almost indistinguishable from having its own physical machine. This allows for a high degree of customization, including the installation of specific operating systems and a full suite of software tools tailored to the agent's tasks.</p><p>Containerization, exemplified by technologies like Docker, offers a lightweight alternative to VMs. Containers package an application and its dependencies together in an isolated environment that runs on a shared operating system kernel. For AI agents, containers can provide a highly efficient way to deploy and manage dedicated environments, ensuring consistency across different underlying infrastructures and allowing for rapid scaling and resource allocation.</p><p>Regardless of the specific technology employed, the key characteristics of an AI agent's \"own computer\" include:</p><p>Dedicated Resources: Each agent is allocated its own quota of computational resources, such as CPU cycles, memory (RAM), and persistent storage. This prevents resource contention with other agents or tasks, ensuring predictable performance and the ability to handle demanding tasks. It's similar to having your own office with its own power supply and filing cabinets, rather than hot-desking in a crowded co-working space or office.</p><p>Isolation: The agent's environment is separated from other agents and the underlying host system. This is crucial for security (preventing malicious or malfunctioning agents from impacting others), stability (errors in one agent do not crash others), and privacy (protecting sensitive data processed by an agent).</p><p>Persistence: The agent's environment, including its state, learned knowledge, installed software, tools and configured settings, persists across sessions. This is fundamental for long-term learning, adaptation, and the ability to undertake complex, multi-stage tasks that may span extended periods. Without persistence, an agent would effectively be reset after each interaction, severely limiting its growth and utility.</p><p>Configurability and Control: The agent, or its developers/administrators, should have the ability to configure its environment. This includes installing necessary software libraries, tools, and dependencies, managing its file system, setting up network configurations, and defining its operational parameters. This level of control allows the environment to be precisely tailored to the agent's specific functions and requirements, much like a human user customizes their personal computer with the applications and settings they need.</p><p>In essence, providing an AI agent with its \"own computer\" means endowing it with a stable, secure, and resource guaranteed digital habitat where it can autonomously operate, learn, and evolve. This software defined computer becomes the foundation upon which more sophisticated, reliable, and truly autonomous AI agents can be built, moving them from being simple task executors to persistent, learning entities within their digital worlds.</p><p><strong>The Need for Dedicated Environments: Overcoming Current Limitations</strong></p><p>The current operational paradigms for many AI agents, often characterized by shared, ephemeral, or heavily restricted computational environments, impose significant limitations on their potential. Just as a human’s ability to perform complex tasks, learn new skills, and operate autonomously is deeply intertwined with having a stable and well equipped personal workspace, AI agents require their own dedicated digital computers, in the form of sandboxes, VMs, or containers, to break these limitations. The provision of such environments is not merely a convenience but a foundational necessity for unlocking a new level of AI capabilities, addressing critical shortcomings in autonomy, performance, security, customization, and the ability to conduct robust experimentation.</p><p>One of the most profound limitations of current AI agent systems is their often restricted autonomy and agency. When an agent operates in a shared space, its ability to initiate tasks independently, manage long running processes, or maintain a persistent state of learning is severely hampered. It might be reset after each interaction or constrained by the policies of a shared platform, preventing it from developing true long term memory or evolving its strategies based on cumulative experience. A dedicated environment, its personal \"computer,\" grants the agent the freedom to operate continuously, to learn from its history, and to pursue complex goals over extended periods without interruption or arbitrary resets. This persistence is the bedrock of genuine learning and adaptation, allowing an agent to move beyond simple stimulus response behaviors towards more sophisticated, autonoumous and goal directed agency.</p><p>Performance and efficiency are also significantly impacted by the agent's computational surroundings. In shared environments, agents often compete for resources like CPU, memory, and network bandwidth, leading to unpredictable performance, increased latency, and an inability to scale operations effectively. A dedicated \"computer\" ensures that an agent has guaranteed access to the resources it needs, optimized for its specific workload. This allows for faster processing, lower latency in decision making, and the ability to handle more complex computations. Furthermore, the environment can be fine tuned , for instance, by providing GPU acceleration if the agent performs intensive machine learning tasks, leading to substantial gains in efficiency and responsiveness, much like a graphic designer benefits from a computer with a powerful dedicated graphics card.</p><p>Security and safety are paramount concerns in AI development, and dedicated environments offer a robust framework for addressing these. When an agent operates within its own isolated sandbox or VM, it is shielded from external threats and, equally importantly, it is prevented from maliciously harming other systems or agents. This isolation is crucial for testing new algorithms, deploying agents that interact with sensitive data, or allowing agents to execute potentially risky actions (like installing new software or accessing external APIs), offensive and defensive security tests, in a controlled manner. If an agent within its dedicated \"computer\" encounters an error or behaves unexpectedly, the impact is contained within its environment, preventing system wide failures. This is similar to having a secure laboratory for conducting experiments, where any unforeseen outcomes are safely managed.</p><p>Customization and specialization are key to developing highly effective AI agents tailored for specific tasks or domains. Generic, one-size-fits-all platforms often restrict the tools, libraries, and configurations an agent can use. A dedicated \"computer\" allows developers to create a bespoke environment, installing precisely the software stack, dependencies, and configurations that the agent requires. An AI agent designed for scientific research might need specialized data analysis libraries and access to specific databases, while an agent for creative content generation might require different sets of tools and models. This ability to tailor the environment allows for the creation of highly specialized and optimized AI agents, far exceeding the capabilities of general purpose agents operating in restricted settings.</p><p>Finally, dedicated environments are indispensable for reproducibility and experimentation. Scientific advancement and robust software development rely on the ability to reproduce results and conduct controlled experiments. When an AI agent operates in its own consistent, version controlled \"computer\" (e.g., a sandbox), researchers and developers can ensure that experiments are conducted under identical conditions, leading to more reliable and verifiable findings. This also simplifies debugging and A/B testing of different agent versions or strategies, as the environment itself is a known and stable factor. It allows for the systematic exploration of an agent's behavior and capabilities, accelerating the pace of innovation and refinement.</p><p>In summary, the absence of dedicated computing environments forces AI agents to operate with clipped wings. By providing them with their own persistent, isolated, and configurable computers, we address fundamental limitations, paving the way for agents that are more autonomous, performant, secure, specialized, and amenable to rigorous scientific inquiry. This shift is essential for moving AI agents from being clever tools to becoming truly capable and reliable autonomous partners.</p><p><strong>Key Capabilities Unlocked by Dedicated Computing</strong></p><p>Granting AI agents their own dedicated computers, is not merely about overcoming limitations; it is about unlocking a suite of powerful capabilities that are currently difficult or impossible to achieve. These capabilities transform agents from reactive tools into proactive, learning, and truly autonomous entities. The provision of a persistent, controllable digital workspace empowers agents in several critical dimensions, fundamentally altering what they can do and how effectively they can do it.</p><p>One of the most significant capabilities unlocked is persistent state and long-term memory. In many current systems, an AI agent's memory is short, wiped clean after an interaction or a task is completed. A dedicated computer allows an agent to maintain its state across sessions, to build a cumulative knowledge base, and to learn from its experiences over extended periods. This means an agent can remember user preferences, recall previous interactions, track progress on long-term projects, and refine its strategies based on historical data. For instance, an AI research assistant operating in its own sandbox could learn a user's preferred citation styles, remember which databases it has already searched for a given topic, and progressively build a more refined understanding of the research domain. This long termm memory is the cornerstone of genuine adaptation and personalization, allowing agents to evolve from generic processors of information into knowledgeable, context aware collaborators.</p><p>Another crucial capability is unfettered tool usage and software installation. AI agents often need to interact with a wide array of external tools, APIs, and software libraries to perform complex tasks. In restricted environments, their access to these resources can be severely limited, or they might be confined to a pre-approved set of tools. A dedicated computer gives an agent (or its developers) the freedom to install and configure any necessary software, from specialized data analysis packages and development kits to custom-built utilities or even apps. This means an agent is no longer constrained by the limitations of a platform's built-in functionalities. It can, for example, install a specific version of a programming language interpreter, utilize a niche machine learning library, or even compile and run code it generates itself. This ability to dynamically extend its toolkit is vital for tackling novel problems and adapting to evolving task requirements, making the agent a far more versatile and powerful problem solver. It’s the difference between being given a basic toolbox and having access to an entire workshop with the ability to acquire or build any tool needed.</p><p>Independent task execution and process management is another capability significantly enhanced by dedicated environments. Agents often need to perform tasks that are long running, require background processing, or involve managing multiple concurrent operations. In a shared environment, such processes might be terminated prematurely or lack the necessary resources. An agent with its own dedicated environment can initiate and manage its own processes, run background tasks (e.g., continuous data monitoring or model retraining/finetuning), and handle multiple sub-tasks in parallel without interference. This allows for true multitasking and the ability to manage complex workflows autonomously. For example, an AI agent managing a smart home could simultaneously monitor security systems, adjust climate control based on learned patterns, and process voice commands, all running as independent but coordinated processes within its dedicated environment. This level of process autonomy is essential for agents designed to manage complex, ongoing responsibilities.</p><p>Finally, dedicated computing environments enable secure data handling and management. Many AI agents process sensitive or proprietary information. Operating within an isolated sandbox or VM provides a secure enclave for this data. The agent can have its own encrypted storage, controlled network access, and fine-grained permissions, minimizing the risk of data breaches or unauthorized access. This is particularly critical for agents deployed in enterprise settings, healthcare, or any domain dealing with confidential information. The agent's computer becomes a trusted space where data can be processed according to defined security protocols, ensuring compliance with privacy regulations and building user trust. This capability is fundamental for deploying AI agents in real-world scenarios where data security and privacy are non-negotiable.</p><p>In essence, providing AI agents with their own computers upgrades them from being simple command-followers to becoming capable, learning, and autonomous systems. The ability to maintain long-term memory, freely utilize and install tools, manage their own tasks, and handle data securely are not just incremental improvements but transformative capabilities that will define the next generation of artificial intelligence.</p><p><strong>Analogies and Existing Parallels: Learning from Established Concepts</strong></p><p>The idea of providing AI agents with their own dedicated computers draws strength and clarity from several well established parallels in both human computing and software development. By examining these analogies, we can better appreciate the transformative potential and inherent logic of equipping AI agents with their own digital domains. These parallels demonstrate that the principles of dedicated resources, isolation, and environmental control are fundamental to achieving autonomy, productivity, and innovation, whether for humans or for artificial intelligences.</p><p>Perhaps the most intuitive analogy is the Personal Computer (PC) for humans. Before the advent of PCs, computing resources were often centralized and shared, accessed through terminals. The personal computer revolutionized productivity and creativity by giving individuals their own dedicated processing power, storage, and a customizable software environment. Users could install their own applications, manage their own files, and work on projects without direct interference or resource contention from others. This autonomy fostered a new era of personal productivity, software development, and digital creativity. Similarly, providing an AI agent with its own computer mirrors this shift. It moves the agent from being a mere user of a shared platform to an entity with its own dedicated operational space, enabling it to manage its tasks, store its knowledge, and utilize its tools with a comparable level of autonomy and efficiency. Just as a PC empowers a human user, a dedicated software environment empowers an AI agent.</p><p>Another strong parallel can be found in Developer Sandboxes and Virtual Environments. Software developers routinely use sandboxes, virtual machines, or containerized environments (like Docker) to create isolated spaces for developing, testing, and debugging applications. These environments allow developers to install specific versions of libraries, configure dependencies, and run experimental code without affecting their primary operating system or other projects. If a piece of code crashes or behaves unexpectedly within the sandbox, the damage is contained. This isolation is crucial for experimentation, ensuring reproducibility, and maintaining a stable development workflow. AI agents, especially those that are learning, evolving, or executing potentially complex or novel code, benefit from their own computer in precisely the same way. It provides a safe, controlled space for them to operate, test new capabilities (perhaps even self-generated code), and learn without risking broader system instability. The sandbox acts as a personal development and testing lab for the AI agent.</p><p>Furthermore, the concept resonates with Cloud Computing Instances, such as Virtual Machines (VMs) and Containers in the cloud (e.g., AWS EC2, Google Compute Engine, Azure VMs, Docker containers managed by Kubernetes). Organizations and individuals lease these cloud-based virtual computers to run applications, host websites, or perform large-scale computations. Each instance provides a dedicated slice of computing resources and an isolated environment that can be configured to specific needs. This model offers scalability, flexibility, and control. An AI agent operating within its own cloud-based VM or container effectively has its own server, tailored to its requirements. This allows for the deployment of highly capable agents that might require significant computational power or specialized hardware (like GPUs for deep learning) that wouldn't be feasible to allocate on a per-agent basis otherwise. The cloud instance becomes the agent's powerful, scalable, and customizable computer.</p><p>These analogies highlight a recurring theme: dedicated, controlled environments are enablers of advanced functionality, autonomy, and safety. Whether it's a human using a PC, a developer working in a sandbox, or an application running on a cloud VM, the principle remains the same. Providing AI agents with their own computers is a logical extension of this proven paradigm. It acknowledges that for an entity ; human or artificial, to perform complex tasks, learn effectively, and operate autonomously, it requires its own space, its own tools, and control over its own environment. By learning from these existing parallels, we can design more robust, capable, and intelligent AI systems.</p><p><strong>Challenges and Considerations in Giving AI Agents Their Own Computers</strong></p><p>While the vision of AI agents equipped with their own dedicated computers promises a significant leap in their capabilities and autonomy, realizing this vision is not without its challenges and important considerations. Transitioning to a model where potentially vast numbers of AI agents each possess their own persistent, resource-intensive environments requires careful thought regarding resource management, infrastructural complexity, ethical implications, and the need for standardization. Addressing these challenges proactively will be crucial for the successful and responsible deployment of such empowered AI systems.</p><p>One of the most immediate practical challenges is Resource Management and Cost. Providing each AI agent with its own dedicated slice of CPU, memory, storage, and potentially specialized hardware like GPUs can be computationally expensive. If we imagine a future with millions or even billions of active AI agents, the aggregate demand for computing resources could be staggering. This necessitates the development of highly efficient resource allocation and management systems. Techniques such as dynamic resource scaling (allocating more resources to an agent only when needed), optimized scheduling, and the use of lightweight virtualization technologies like containers will be essential. Furthermore, the energy consumption associated with maintaining these numerous environments is a significant concern that needs to be addressed through energy efficient hardware and software design. The economic models for providing and maintaining these agent computers will also need careful consideration, whether they are managed by individuals, enterprises, or platform providers.</p><p>Another significant hurdle is the Complexity of Infrastructure. Managing a large-scale deployment of individual agent environments, ensuring their security, persistence, and interoperability, presents a considerable engineering challenge. This includes robust systems for provisioning new agent environments, monitoring their health and performance, applying updates and patches, backing up agent states, and securely decommissioning environments when they are no longer needed. Developing orchestration platforms specifically designed for managing AI agent ecosystems at scale will be a critical area of research and development. The complexity also extends to the agents themselves; more capable environments might lead to more complex agent behaviors that are harder to understand, debug, and control.</p><p>Ethical Implications loom large when considering highly autonomous AI agents operating within their own persistent environments. With greater autonomy and the ability to learn and adapt over long periods, questions arise about accountability, bias, and potential misuse. If an agent, operating within its own computer, develops undesirable behaviors or makes harmful decisions, who is responsible? How can we ensure that agents remain aligned with human values and ethical principles as they evolve within their private digital spaces? The ability for agents to install their own software or access vast amounts of information also raises concerns about the potential for malicious use or the propagation of harmful content. Robust ethical guidelines, auditing mechanisms, and techniques for value alignment will be indispensable. Furthermore, the data privacy of information processed and stored within an agent's dedicated environment must be rigorously protected.</p><p>Standardization and Interoperability will also become increasingly important as the ecosystem of AI agents grows. If agents are to collaborate, share information, or migrate between different platforms, there will need to be common standards for defining their environments, capabilities, and communication protocols, just like the A2A Protocol develped by Google. Without such standards, we risk creating siloed systems where agents developed by different organizations or for different purposes cannot effectively interact. Developing open standards for agent architectures, environmental specifications, and data exchange formats will foster a more vibrant and collaborative AI ecosystem, much like web standards enabled the growth of the internet.</p><p>Finally, ensuring the Security of these individual agent computers against both internal and external threats is a continuous challenge. While isolation is a key benefit, no system is perfectly impenetrable. Malicious actors might attempt to compromise agent environments to steal data, disrupt operations, or co-opt agents for nefarious purposes. Conversely, a sufficiently advanced or poorly constrained agent could potentially attempt to breach its own sandbox. Continuous security monitoring, intrusion detection, and robust containment strategies will be necessary to maintain the integrity and safety of these agent ecosystems.</p><p>Addressing these challenges, resource management, infrastructural complexity, ethical considerations, standardization, and security is not an impossible task, but it requires foresight, careful planning, and ongoing research. The benefits of empowering AI agents with their own dedicated computing environments are substantial, but they must be pursued responsibly, with a clear understanding of the potential pitfalls and a commitment to developing solutions that ensure these powerful tools are used for the betterment of society.</p><p><strong>The Future of AI Agents with Their Own Computers: A New Era of Intelligent Systems</strong></p><p>The advent of AI agents equipped with their own dedicated computers is poised to usher in a new era of intelligent systems, fundamentally reshaping how we interact with technology and how AI contributes to various aspects of human endeavor. This paradigm shift, moving beyond agents as momentary task executors to agents as persistent, learning entities within their own digital habitats, opens up a prospect of exciting future possibilities. The implications are far reaching, promising the emergence of truly autonomous assistants, collaborative AI teams capable of tackling unprecedentedly complex problems, novel avenues for AI-driven research and innovation, and a richer, more dynamic AI ecosystem.</p><p>One of the most anticipated developments is the emergence of truly autonomous AI personal assistants. Imagine an AI assistant that doesn't just respond to commands but proactively manages your schedule, anticipates your needs, learns your preferences in depth over years of interaction, and securely handles your personal information within its own trusted computational space. Such an assistant, residing in its dedicated computer, could manage complex, long-term projects on your behalf, interface with various services, filter information with a nuanced understanding of your priorities, and even learn new skills as required. This goes far beyond current digital assistants; it envisions a genuine digital partner, capable of sophisticated reasoning, long-term memory, and a high degree of autonomy, all made possible by its persistent and resource rich environment.</p><p>The future will likely see complex problem-solving undertaken by teams of specialized AI agents, each operating within its own dedicated environment but capable of collaborating seamlessly. Consider a grand challenge like developing a cure for a complex disease or designing a sustainable city. A team of AI agents, each specializing in a different domain (e.g., genetics, pharmacology, urban planning, materials science), could work together. Each agent, within its own computer, would have access to specialized tools, datasets, and models relevant to its expertise. They could share findings, debate hypotheses, and collectively build solutions in a way that mirrors, and potentially surpasses, human collaborative efforts. The dedicated environments ensure that each agent can perform its specialized tasks optimally, while standardized communication protocols such as the A2A protocol by Google, allow for effective teamwork. This collaborative AI model, built upon agents with their own computational resources, could accelerate breakthroughs in science, engineering, and beyond.</p><p>New AI-driven research and innovation will be spurred by agents that can independently conduct experiments, formulate hypotheses, and even design new algorithms within their secure sandboxes. An AI agent dedicated to materials science, for example, could simulate thousands of molecular combinations, learn from the results, and propose novel materials with desired properties, all within its own persistent computational environment. Similarly, agents could explore complex mathematical hypothesis or analyze vast astronomical datasets, pushing the boundaries of knowledge. The ability for agents to have their own computers where they can safely and persistently explore, learn, and create will transform them from tools for analysis into active participants in the discovery process.</p><p>This will also lead to a richer and more diverse AI ecosystem. As it becomes easier to provision and manage dedicated environments for AI agents (perhaps through standardized platforms and open-source tools), we can expect an explosion in the variety and specialization of agents. Niche AI agents could be developed for highly specific tasks, from managing personal finances with deep contextual understanding to providing expert advice in obscure academic fields. This diversity will be fostered by the ability to tailor each agent's computer precisely to its intended function, creating a vibrant marketplace of specialized AI capabilities. Individuals and smaller organizations could deploy sophisticated agents without needing to build and maintain massive, centralized AI infrastructures themselves.</p><p>Furthermore, the concept of agents having their own computers will drive advancements in AI safety, ethics, and governance. As agents become more autonomous, the ability to monitor, audit, and control their behavior within their defined environments will be crucial. These dedicated spaces can be designed with built-in safeguards, logging mechanisms, and interfaces for human oversight, allowing for more responsible development and deployment of powerful AI. Research into value alignment and ethical reasoning can be tested and refined within these controlled yet capable agent habitats.</p><p>In conclusion, the future where AI agents possess their own dedicated computing environments is not just about more powerful AI; it's about a fundamental shift towards more autonomous, adaptable, collaborative, and specialized intelligent systems. This vision promises to unlock new potentials across countless domains, creating an era where AI agents become integral, trusted, and highly capable partners in our digital and physical worlds. The journey towards this future requires overcoming the challenges discussed previously, but the transformative rewards make it a pursuit of profound importance.</p><p><strong>Embracing the Era of Empowered AI Agents</strong></p><p>The journey towards more sophisticated and truly autonomous Artificial Intelligence is intrinsically linked to the environments in which AI agents operate. This article has argued that providing AI agents with their own dedicated computers in the form of persistent, isolated, and configurable software environments like sandboxes, virtual machines, or containers is not merely an incremental upgrade but a foundational necessity. This approach directly addresses the current limitations in agent autonomy, performance, security, and adaptability, paving the way for a new generation of intelligent systems.</p><p>We have explored how these dedicated environments unlock critical capabilities. Drawing parallels with personal computers for humans, developer sandboxes, and cloud computing instances, the logic for such dedicated digital habitats becomes clear: control, isolation, and dedicated resources are universal enablers of complex work and innovation. While challenges in resource management, infrastructural complexity, ethical considerations, and standardization must be proactively addressed, the transformative potential is immense.</p><p>The future envisioned is one where AI agents, empowered by their own computational domains, become truly autonomous personal assistants, collaborate in specialized teams to solve grand challenges, drive new waves of research and innovation, and contribute to a richer, more diverse AI ecosystem. This is not a distant dream but an achievable evolution, contingent on our commitment to developing the necessary infrastructure and ethical frameworks.</p><p>Ultimately, giving AI agents their own computers is about providing them with the digital equivalent of a room of their own, a space to think, to learn, to grow, and to act with genuine autonomy. As we stand on the cusp of this new era, it is important to build these environments thoughtfully and responsibly, unlocking the profound potential of AI to augment human capabilities and address some of the world's most pressing challenges. The path forward requires continued research, robust engineering, and a clear eyed understanding of both the opportunities and the responsibilities that come with creating more powerful and independent artificial intelligences.</p>","contentLength":35707,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Amazon Q vs. Claude vs. GPT-4o: Who Really Codes Better Under Pressure?","url":"https://dev.to/numbpill3d/amazon-q-vs-claude-vs-gpt-4o-who-really-codes-better-under-pressure-3hl","date":1751202112,"author":"v. Splicer","guid":175148,"unread":true,"content":"<p>Three months ago I cracked open these AI coding tools like I would any new piece of salvaged tech. Strip them down. Test their circuits. See where the current flows and where it dies.</p><p>I've fixed enough broken systems to know that tools either work or they don't. No middle ground when production is burning and money bleeds with every minute of downtime.</p><p>So I put Amazon Q, Claude, and GPT-4o through the grinder. Real systems. Real pressure. Real consequences when the smoke clears and something's still broken.</p><p>My workshop isn't some sterile lab environment. It's production servers throwing 500 errors at 3 AM. Legacy codebases held together with duct tape and desperation. Systems that fourteen different contractors have \"fixed\" over the years, each one adding another layer of digital scar tissue.</p><p>I gave each AI the same treatment I'd give any repair job. Here's the problem. Here's the deadline. Fix it or explain why it can't be fixed.</p><p>First test was a PHP payment system from 2018. Customer transactions failing every third attempt. The kind of codebase where functions are named  and the comments are in three languages, none of them helpful. Previous developers had vanished like smoke. Database queries that looked like someone sneezed SQL all over the keyboard.</p><p>Second test was meaner. Node.js API needed to handle ten times the traffic by morning. No documentation. Original developer ghosted six months ago. The entire thing running on setTimeout calls and prayer. Classic startup architecture built by someone who'd learned JavaScript from YouTube tutorials.</p><p>Third test was the killer. Legacy Python script processing financial data. Written in Python 2.7. Needed porting to Python 3.9 without changing output format. Using libraries so old they predated version control. The kind of code that makes senior developers consider career changes.</p><p>Same time limits for each AI. Same broken systems. Same ticking clock. No do-overs, no perfect prompts, no hand-holding. Just raw problems and the kind of pressure that separates working tools from expensive paperweights.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Amazon Q: The Company Man\n</h2><p>Amazon Q feels like it was assembled by committee. Knows AWS services the way a factory worker knows their station, but ask it to work with anything else and you can hear the gears grinding.</p><p>On the PHP payment disaster, Q immediately started pitching Lambda functions and API Gateway replacements. \"Why not rebuild this serverless?\" Like I had unlimited budget and six months to burn. Had to redirect it three times before it would look at the actual broken code sitting in front of us.</p><p>When Q finally engaged with the problem instead of trying to sell me a solution, it was competent but uninspired. Found the race condition in the payment loop. Suggested a database transaction wrapper. Provided clean code that would work. No elegance. No insight into why the original developer made those choices. Just functional fixes delivered with the enthusiasm of a replacement part.</p><p>Q's strength runs deep when you're living in Amazon's ecosystem. It knows which S3 bucket policy you need, which IAM role to create, which CloudWatch metric will actually tell you something useful. That knowledge has weight. Real practical value if you're already wired into their infrastructure.</p><p>Its weakness is adaptability. Q thinks in AWS patterns like a mechanic who only knows one brand of engine. When I showed it the Node.js scaling problem, every suggestion involved moving to ECS, adding ALB, configuring Auto Scaling Groups. Solid advice if you're already on AWS. Useless if you're running bare metal or stuck with Azure.</p><p>The Python migration exposed Q's real limitation. It handled the syntax changes from Python 2 to 3 fine. Basic stuff. But it missed the behavioral differences in libraries. The edge cases that only surface when real data hits production systems. Q's suggestions would pass unit tests but fail when customers started using them.</p><p>Q is reliable contractor energy. Shows up on time. Does competent work. Doesn't surprise you with brilliance or catastrophic failures. If you're already living in AWS, it's solid. If you're working mixed environments or legacy systems, you'll spend more time explaining context than getting fixes.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Claude: The Careful Surgeon\n</h2><p>Claude approaches broken code like a medic who's seen too many systems bleed out from hasty patches. Cautious. Thorough. Asks the right questions before cutting anything open. Sometimes annoyingly careful, but usually for reasons that become clear later.</p><p>On the PHP payment system, Claude's first response was diagnostic questions. \"What's the current error rate? Are failures correlated with specific user types? What does the database schema look like?\" Most people find this irritating. I found it promising. Someone finally asking about symptoms instead of just throwing solutions at problems.</p><p>When Claude provided fixes, they had thought behind them. Didn't just patch the race condition. Explained why race conditions happen in payment systems. Suggested monitoring strategies. Provided fallback mechanisms. Code came back clean, well-commented, with edge case handling that showed someone was thinking about 3 AM phone calls.</p><p>Claude's strength is depth of analysis. It thinks about failure modes. Considers maintenance burden six months from now. Worries about security implications like someone who's had to explain breaches to angry customers. On the Node.js scaling challenge, it didn't just suggest caching. It walked through different caching patterns, explained tradeoffs, provided implementation examples for each approach.</p><p>Where Claude struggles is speed under pressure. When you need a tourniquet to stop the bleeding, Claude wants to perform surgery. It'll give you the best solution, but sometimes you need good enough in thirty minutes rather than perfect in three hours.</p><p>The Python migration revealed Claude's real value. It caught compatibility issues the others missed. Subtle changes in datetime object behavior. Encoding differences. Library incompatibilities that wouldn't surface until runtime with real data. Claude had learned from other people's migration scars.</p><p>Claude is the senior consultant you call for complex problems. Expensive. Slow to start. But delivers solutions that won't break when the next developer inherits them. If you have time for proper diagnosis and want to understand why things work instead of just making them work, Claude's your tool.</p><p>GPT-4o codes like a startup developer running on caffeine and deadline terror. Fast. Creative. Occasionally brilliant. Sometimes spectacularly wrong. Most human-like of the three, which includes human mistakes.</p><p>On the PHP payment system, GPT-4o started generating code before I finished explaining the problem. No questions. No analysis. Just rapid-fire solutions. First attempt was wrong but interesting. Tried implementing optimistic locking, which would have been clever if the database supported it. Second attempt hit the mark with a simple mutex pattern that actually worked.</p><p>GPT-4o's strength is creative problem-solving. When conventional approaches fail, it tries unconventional ones. On the Node.js scaling challenge, it suggested a connection pooling strategy I hadn't seen before. Using Redis as both cache and connection coordinator. Weird approach. But it worked.</p><p>The downside is reliability. GPT-4o will confidently suggest solutions that don't work. Use deprecated APIs. Miss important edge cases. It codes like someone who learned from Stack Overflow instead of production scars. Fast and creative, but you need to verify everything before letting it near real systems.</p><p>The Python migration highlighted this perfectly. GPT-4o cranked out converted code in minutes. But it made assumptions about library behavior that weren't true. Used modern idioms that would work in Python 3.9 but changed output format slightly. Close enough for demos. Wrong enough for production.</p><p>GPT-4o is junior developer energy with good instincts but incomplete knowledge. Perfect for brainstorming. Rapid prototyping. Generating starting points. Dangerous for mission-critical systems where mistakes cost money and sleep.</p><p>GPT-4o wins without question. Generates code faster than I can read it. Rarely hesitates. Always has suggestions ready. Amazon Q comes second with steady output, no long delays. Claude trails behind, often pausing to think through implications before responding.</p><p>In emergency situations, speed matters. When production is down and every minute costs real money, GPT-4o's rapid iterations beat Claude's careful analysis. But speed without accuracy is just expensive mistakes delivered quickly.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  Code Quality and Reliability\n</h3><p>Claude produces the most reliable code. Clean structure. Proper error handling. Meaningful variable names. Helpful comments. Code that passes review and survives production stress.</p><p>Amazon Q generates competent, workable code that follows best practices. Not inspired, but rarely wrong. The kind of code that gets the job done without causing problems later.</p><p>GPT-4o produces exciting code that might work perfectly or might fail catastrophically. High variance in quality. Unsuitable for critical systems but valuable for exploration.</p><p>Claude demonstrates the deepest understanding of problems. Considers context. Asks clarifying questions. Thinks about downstream effects. Codes like someone who'll be on call when things break.</p><p>Amazon Q understands problems within its knowledge domain well but struggles with unfamiliar territory. Like a specialist who's brilliant in their field but lost outside it.</p><p>GPT-4o sometimes misunderstands problems but compensates with creative solutions that work anyway. The developer who fixes the wrong bug but somehow makes the system better.</p><p>All three tools are limited by their training data, but they handle new information differently.</p><p>Claude integrates new context well. Builds on previous conversation to refine solutions. Remembers what you've told it and adjusts accordingly.</p><p>Amazon Q sticks to its patterns regardless of context. If you're not working in its preferred paradigms, it keeps suggesting you should be.</p><p>GPT-4o adapts quickly but inconsistently. Might pick up on subtle hints in one conversation and completely miss obvious context in the next.</p><p>Database server maxing CPU. Application response times through the roof. Customers calling. Need to identify and fix immediately.</p><p>GPT-4o gets you moving fastest with rapid-fire diagnostic suggestions. \"Check connection pooling, look for long-running queries, examine index usage.\" Helps generate monitoring scripts and quick fixes while you're diagnosing.</p><p>Claude provides systematic approach. \"Gather metrics first, analyze patterns, implement targeted fixes.\" Slower to start, but less likely to make the problem worse with hasty changes.</p><p>Amazon Q shines if you're on AWS. Knows exactly which CloudWatch metrics to check, which RDS parameters to tune, which scaling options to enable. Limited outside the AWS ecosystem.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  The Legacy Migration Project\n</h3><p>Six-month project modernizing critical business system. Requirements vague. Documentation incomplete. Original developers long gone.</p><p>Claude excels here. Asks the right questions. Considers architectural implications. Provides solutions that account for unknown unknowns. Plans for failure. Designs for maintainability.</p><p>Amazon Q works well if target architecture involves AWS services. Can design robust cloud-native replacements for legacy systems, though it may miss business logic subtleties.</p><p>GPT-4o valuable for rapid prototyping and exploring alternatives, but you need human oversight to ensure final system meets all requirements.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  The Integration Challenge\n</h3><p>Need to connect new system with five existing services. Each with different APIs, data formats, authentication schemes. Timeline tight. Requirements changing.</p><p>GPT-4o thrives here. Generates adapter code quickly. Suggests creative integration patterns. Handles constant iteration that integration projects require.</p><p>Claude provides solid, well-structured integration solutions that handle edge cases and failure modes properly. Takes longer to develop but results in more reliable connections.</p><p>Amazon Q helps if some systems are AWS services, but struggles with external APIs and unconventional data formats.</p><p>After three months of real-world testing in the field, here's what these tools actually are:</p><p> is a specialist tool wearing a generalist mask. If you live in AWS and work on cloud-native systems, it's extremely valuable. Outside that ecosystem, it's merely adequate. The mechanic who knows one brand of engine inside and out but struggles with everything else.</p><p> is the senior developer you want reviewing code before production deployment. Careful. Thorough. Reliable. Sometimes too slow for urgent situations. Produces the best code but takes longest to deliver it. Perfect for complex problems where correctness matters more than speed.</p><p> is the creative problem-solver who generates ten solutions while others are still analyzing the problem. Most won't work, but the ones that do are often brilliant. Invaluable for brainstorming and rapid prototyping. Dangerous for production systems.</p><ul><li>Working primarily with AWS services</li><li>Need reliable, straightforward solutions</li><li>Team prefers proven patterns over creative approaches</li><li>Integration with existing AWS infrastructure critical</li></ul><ul><li>Code quality and reliability paramount</li><li>Working on complex, long-term projects</li><li>Want to understand why solutions work, not just how</li><li>Have time for proper analysis and planning</li></ul><ul><li>Need rapid iteration and creative solutions</li><li>Exploring new approaches or prototyping</li><li>Have experienced developers who can validate AI suggestions</li><li>Speed matters more than initial perfection</li></ul><p>None of these tools replace experienced developers. They're force multipliers, not replacements. Good developer becomes more productive with any of these tools. Bad developer becomes more dangerous.</p><p>I've seen teams adopt AI coding assistants and immediately try cutting senior developer headcount. That's like buying a chainsaw and firing your carpenter. Tool is only as good as the person wielding it.</p><p>Real value isn't in the code these tools generate. It's in time saved on routine tasks. Creative options suggested. Learning opportunities provided. Senior developer can use any of these tools to explore unfamiliar languages, generate boilerplate code, prototype solutions quickly.</p><p>But when production breaks at 3 AM and customers are losing money, you still need someone who understands the system. Can read error logs. Makes good decisions under pressure. No AI tool provides that judgment yet.</p><p>If I had to choose one tool for mixed environment with varied requirements, I'd pick Claude. Its careful approach and high code quality make it safest choice for most situations. Extra time it takes usually worth the reduced debugging later.</p><p>For AWS-heavy environments, Amazon Q becomes much more attractive. Its deep service knowledge makes it valuable despite limited scope.</p><p>GPT-4o earns its place as creative partner and rapid prototyping tool, but I wouldn't trust it with production code without human review.</p><p>Truth is, I use all three. Claude for complex analysis and critical systems. Amazon Q for AWS integration work. GPT-4o for brainstorming and quick prototypes. They're tools, not solutions. Pick the right tool for the job.</p><p>In my workshop, I keep different screwdrivers for different screws. Same principle applies here. One AI coding assistant isn't enough anymore. That's probably good.</p><p>Best code still comes from humans who understand the problem, know the constraints, and care about the consequences. These tools just help us write it faster.</p><p>Nothing's truly broken if you can trace the current. These AIs are just new ways to follow the signal through the noise.</p>","contentLength":15800,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Recap of Vercel Ship 2025","url":"https://dev.to/devy/recap-of-vercel-ship-2025-52m3","date":1751202024,"author":"Dev Ieffe","guid":175147,"unread":true,"content":"<p> showcased a clear evolution in how Vercel envisions the future of development—moving beyond frontend deployment into AI infrastructure, secure computing, and edge-first architecture. While Next.js Conf 2024 was focused on stability and scaling frontend frameworks, this event leaned into enabling intelligent, modular, and cost-efficient full-stack AI apps.</p><p>One of the headline features was the AI Gateway, a centralized interface for accessing over 100 large language models (LLMs) across providers like OpenAI, Anthropic, Mistral, Google, and xAI. It supports smart routing, observability, fallback mechanisms, and per-model analytics—simplifying vendor management and boosting developer flexibility in AI-powered apps.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Fluid Compute &amp; Active CPU Pricing\n</h2><p>The introduction of Fluid Compute represents a leap in efficiency. Instead of running every request in isolation, Vercel now allows function execution to persist across invocations. This, paired with Active CPU pricing—charging only for CPU-active time and massively discounting memory idle time—delivers up to 85% in cost savings, especially relevant for AI inference and streaming.</p><p>Developers can now execute untrusted, AI-generated code securely in isolated microVMs for up to 45 minutes. The Vercel Sandbox supports both Node.js and Python, opening up safe testing for AI agents, dynamic content generation, or even educational use cases.</p><h2>\n  \n  \n  Microfrontends &amp; Rolling Releases\n</h2><p>Vercel now supports microfrontend architecture natively. Teams can independently build and deploy parts of a UI, while Vercel manages routing and integration. Paired with Rolling Releases, which allow gradual global deployment with real-time observability and rollback tools, this fosters safer, faster iteration cycles.</p><p>To handle background processes, Vercel Queue introduces native task queuing with retry logic and persistence—ideal for media processing, email handling, or delayed AI tasks. Meanwhile, BotID offers invisible CAPTCHA functionality to detect malicious bots on sensitive endpoints without interrupting the user experience.</p><p>Vercel now includes an AI assistant in the dashboard that detects anomalies in performance, firewall settings, and security metrics—suggesting actionable fixes in real time. It’s a move toward self-healing infrastructure powered by AI.</p><p>Vercel Next.js Conf 2024 was largely centered around developer ergonomics and frontend performance. Key features included:\n    • v0 by Vercel: an AI UI generation tool that bootstrapped components from prompts.<p>\n    • Next.js 14: introducing partial pre-rendering and server actions.</p>\n    • Edge Config and Middleware upgrades: allowing dynamic content delivery with low latency.</p><p>In contrast, Ship 2025 brings:\n    • A platform shift toward AI-native applications<p>\n    • Deep focus on infrastructure cost control</p>\n    • First-class support for long-running, secure compute<p>\n    • Native queueing and deployment safety mechanisms</p></p><p>While Conf 2024 was about tightening the frontend toolchain, Ship 2025 is about empowering developers to build AI-native, distributed, and modular systems at scale. With AI Gateway, Fluid Compute, and secure sandboxes, Vercel is clearly positioning itself as not just the best platform to deploy websites—but to run the future of intelligent web apps.

What made the experience even more special was that many of the senior staff were alumni from our college, making the workspace incredibly friendly and collaborative.</p><p>On the days I went to the office in person, I would ride along with Dinesh Kumar—it took us nearly an hour to reach the workspace, and we had some of the best conversations along the way.\nSometimes, we’d reminisce about college days, exams, and projects. Other times, we’d discuss our ongoing work, explore technologies, and talk about careers, placements, and what the future holds. Those morning rides were truly special—casual, thoughtful, and always enriching.</p><p>I personally loved going to the office because many of our seniors—alumni from our very own course—would be there. Since we shared that common ground, we had so much to talk about. Whether it was clearing doubts, learning about the industry, or just general chit-chat, they always made time for us.\nDuring lunch, we’d all sit together, gossip, joke around, and just have fun. Looking back, those were some of my favorite memories—I genuinely miss those days.</p><p>Beyond office hours, I was deeply focused on learning and growing. Over the six months, I attended technical meetups, joined bootcamps, started blogging, and participated in hackathons. These experiences helped me not only sharpen my skills but also connect with the broader tech community.\nAll of this complemented what I was learning at Invisibl Cloud, helping me grow both in depth and in direction.</p><p>During my first three months, I worked on an <strong><em>Observability Infrastructure Project</em></strong>, where I dove deep into system logs, tools like Cribl and Grafana, and built a full-stack monitoring setup. Then, I transitioned to a <strong><em>Generative AI-based project</em></strong> centered around intelligent research paper discovery using RAG.</p><p>I’m proud to share that the demos for both projects received positive feedback from the client, which was deeply satisfying, especially considering both domains were completely new to me when I started.</p><ul><li>A heartfelt thank you to <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/harishganesan/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Harish Ganesan</a>, CEO of Invisibl Cloud Solutions, for not only trusting me with impactful work but also giving me the opportunity to work on the Gen AI project.

The organization already had <a href=\"https://dev.to/mettasurendhar/step-by-step-guide-to-configuring-cribl-and-grafana-for-data-processing-1j0f\">metrics monitoring</a>, and I was tasked with building the logs monitoring infrastructure from scratch.</p><ul><li>Leveraged native Event Logs (Application, System, Security).</li><li>Collected logs using Cribl Agent.</li><li>Processed and routed them through Cribl Edge and Cribl Stream.</li></ul><ul><li>Linux was more challenging due to the absence of structured default logs.</li><li>Created a Ubuntu virtual machine.</li><li>Researched and implemented rsyslog to generate logs in custom templates.</li><li>Integrated the logs into the same Cribl → Loki → Grafana pipeline.</li></ul><p> Successfully built and delivered a cross-platform proof of concept for full-stack log observability, integrated seamlessly into the existing infrastructure.</p><h2> Generative AI Research Agent\n</h2><p> To build an intelligent AI agent capable of retrieving and summarizing research papers based on user queries. Haystack, FastAPI, Streamlit, Python, Arxiv API, Gemini, OpenSearch Agent pipelines, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), API development, LLM integration</p><p>In the second half of my internship, I worked on this exciting project with one other teammate. The goal was to help researchers find academic papers faster and more efficiently using Generative AI.</p><p>🌟 to fetch relevant research papers.\n🌟<em>Designed the agent pipeline</em> using Haystack and Gemini, implementing RAG to combine retrieval with generation.\n🌟<em>Stored extracted data in OpenSearch</em> for quick and context-aware access.\n🌟<em>Built a Streamlit-based POC</em> to demo the functionality.\n🌟Later <em>developed a FastAPI version</em> for production-level usage.</p><p>The first month of development was incredibly intense—we often worked for over 10 hours a day to shape the prototype. With consistent support and motivation from Suryaa Azhakhiamanavalan and Harish Ganesan, and after multiple review meetings and revisions, we (myself and Harshita Miranda) were able to complete the proof of concept within the first month.\nEven though the pace felt heavy at the time, it turned out to be one of the most rewarding learning experiences of my internship.</p><p> Delivered a fully functional prototype in under a month, and then enhanced it into an API-ready microservice with scalable architecture.</p><p>This internship gave me a crash course in:\n✔️Observability tools and infrastructure, from system logs to dashboard visualization.<p>\n✔️Generative AI workflows, agent chaining, and RAG pipelines.</p>\n✔️Real-world problem solving across two very different but equally challenging domains.<p>\n✔️Working in a collaborative team, presenting demos to clients, and adapting to fast-paced learning curves.</p>\n✔️Most importantly, it showed me the importance of taking initiative, asking the right questions, and owning the full cycle of a product — from idea to implementation.</p><p>Looking back, I’m proud of how much I was able to learn and build in just six months. The trust, guidance, and opportunities I received from Invisibl Cloud Solutions shaped this internship into something I’ll always remember.</p><p>From configuring log protocols on Linux to chaining LLM agents for intelligent research—this journey has been transformative. I’m grateful for every challenge, every lesson, and every teammate who made it all worthwhile.</p>","contentLength":7247,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"HR Agency in one prompt","url":"https://dev.to/ximet/hr-agency-in-one-prompt-5dj3","date":1751196617,"author":"Dmitry","guid":175113,"unread":true,"content":"<p>I built the HR Agency (Project Analysis &amp; Talent Acquisition Agent), an autonomous AI system that transforms how HR professionals approach project staffing by analyzing requirements, sourcing candidates from multiple databases, and providing comprehensive hiring recommendations with full compliance management.</p><p>Traditional HR project staffing involves weeks of manual work, including analyzing project specifications, defining roles, searching multiple platforms for candidates, parsing CVs individually, creating comparison matrices, and ensuring compliance.
