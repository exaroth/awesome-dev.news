If you are using C++, please follow the <a href=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/main/src/README.md\">C++ Installation Instructions</a> to install protoc along with the C++ runtime.</p><p>For non-C++ users, the simplest way to install the protocol compiler is to download a pre-built binary from our <a href=\"https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/releases\">GitHub release page</a>.</p><p>In the downloads section of each release, you can find pre-built binaries in zip packages: <code>protoc-$VERSION-$PLATFORM.zip</code>. It contains the protoc binary as well as a set of standard  files distributed along with protobuf.</p><p>If you are looking for an old version that is not available in the release page, check out the <a href=\"https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/com/google/protobuf/protoc/\">Maven repository</a>.</p><p>These pre-built binaries are only provided for released versions. If you want to use the github main version at HEAD, or you need to modify protobuf code, or you are using C++, it's recommended to build your own protoc binary from source.</p><h2>Protobuf Runtime Installation</h2><p>Protobuf supports several different programming languages. For each programming language, you can find instructions in the corresponding source directory about how to install protobuf runtime for that specific language:</p><p>If you want to learn from code examples, take a look at the examples in the <a href=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/main/examples\">examples</a> directory.</p><p>To be alerted to upcoming changes in Protocol Buffers and connect with protobuf developers and users, <a href=\"https://groups.google.com/g/protobuf\">join the Google Group</a>.</p>","contentLength":3333,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"lobehub/lobehub","url":"https://github.com/lobehub/lobehub","date":1769655493,"author":"","guid":425676,"unread":true,"content":"<p>The ultimate space for work and life — to find, build, and collaborate with agent teammates that grow with you.

They lack context, live in isolation, and require manual hand-offs between different windows and models. While some maintain memory, it is often global, shallow, and impersonal. In this mode, users are forced to toggle between fragmented conversations, making it difficult to form structured productivity.</p><p><strong>LobeHub changes everything.</strong></p><p>LobeHub is a work-and-lifestyle space to find, build, and collaborate with agent teammates that grow with you. In LobeHub, we treat <strong>Agents as the unit of work</strong>, providing an infrastructure where humans and agents co-evolve.</p><h3>Create: Agents as the Unit of Work</h3><p>Building a personalized AI team starts with the . You can describe what you need once, and the agent setup starts right away, applying auto-configurations so you can use it instantly.</p><ul><li>: Seamlessly access any model and any modality—all under your control.</li><li>: Connect your agents to the skills you use every day with a library of over 10,000 tools and MCP-compatible plugins.</li></ul><h3>Collaborate: Scale New Forms of Collaboration Networks</h3><p>LobeHub introduces , allowing you to work with agents like real teammates.

If you believe you have found a security issue in Vault, <em>please responsibly disclose</em> by contacting us at <a href=\"mailto:security@hashicorp.com\">security@hashicorp.com</a>.</p><img width=\"300\" alt=\"Vault Logo\" src=\"https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/raw/f22d202cde2018f9455dec755118a9b84586e082/Vault_PrimaryLogo_Black.png\"><p>Vault is a tool for securely accessing secrets. A secret is anything that you want to tightly control access to, such as API keys, passwords, certificates, and more. Vault provides a unified interface to any secret, while providing tight access control and recording a detailed audit log.</p><p>A modern system requires access to a multitude of secrets: database credentials, API keys for external services, credentials for service-oriented architecture communication, etc. Understanding who is accessing what secrets is already very difficult and platform-specific. Adding on key rolling, secure storage, and detailed audit logs is almost impossible without a custom solution. This is where Vault steps in.</p><p>The key features of Vault are:</p><ul><li><p>: Vault can store arbitrary key/value pairs. Vault encrypts data before writing it to persistent storage, so gaining access to the raw storage isn't enough to access your secrets. Vault can write to disk, <a href=\"https://www.consul.io\">Consul</a>, and more.</p></li><li><p>: Vault can generate secrets on-demand for some systems, such as AWS or SQL databases. For example, when an application needs to access an S3 bucket, it asks Vault for credentials, and Vault will generate an AWS keypair with valid permissions on demand. After creating these dynamic secrets, Vault will also automatically revoke them after the lease is up.</p></li><li><p>: Vault can encrypt and decrypt data without storing it. This allows security teams to define encryption parameters and developers to store encrypted data in a location such as a SQL database without having to design their own encryption methods.</p></li><li><p>: Vault associates a  with each secret. At the end of the lease, Vault automatically revokes the secret. Clients are able to renew leases via built-in renew APIs.</p></li><li><p>: Vault has built-in support for secret revocation. Vault can revoke not only single secrets, but a tree of secrets, for example, all secrets read by a specific user, or all secrets of a particular type. Revocation assists in key rolling as well as locking down systems in the case of an intrusion.</p></li></ul><h2>Documentation, Getting Started, and Certification Exams</h2><p>If you're new to Vault and want to get started with security automation, please check out our <a href=\"https://learn.hashicorp.com/collections/vault/getting-started\">Getting Started guides</a> on HashiCorp's learning platform.

Visit the <a href=\"https://www.hashicorp.com/certification/#hashicorp-certified-vault-associate\">certification page</a> for information about exams and find <a href=\"https://learn.hashicorp.com/collections/vault/certification\">study materials</a> on HashiCorp's learning platform.</p><p>If you wish to work on Vault itself or any of its built-in systems, you'll first need <a href=\"https://www.golang.org\">Go</a> installed on your machine.</p><p>For local dev first make sure Go is properly installed, including setting up a <a href=\"https://golang.org/doc/code.html#GOPATH\">GOPATH</a>, then setting the <a href=\"https://pkg.go.dev/cmd/go#hdr-Environment_variables\">GOBIN</a> variable to . Ensure that  is in your path as some distributions bundle the old version of build tools.</p><p>Next, clone this repository. Vault uses <a href=\"https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/Modules\">Go Modules</a>, so it is recommended that you clone the repository  of the GOPATH. You can then download any required build tools by bootstrapping your environment:</p><p>To compile a development version of Vault, run  or . This will put the Vault binary in the  and  folders:</p><pre><code>$ make dev\n...\n$ bin/vault\n...\n</code></pre><p>To compile a development version of Vault with the UI, run . This will put the Vault binary in the  and  folders:</p><pre><code>$ make static-dist dev-ui\n...\n$ bin/vault\n...\n</code></pre><p>To run tests, type . Note: this requires Docker to be installed. If this exits with exit status 0, then everything is working!</p><p>If you're developing a specific package, you can run tests for just that package by specifying the  variable. For example below, only  package tests will be run.</p><pre><code>$ make test TEST=./vault\n...\n</code></pre><p>If you encounter an error like <code>could not read Username for 'https://github.com'</code> you may need to adjust your git config like so:</p><pre><code>$ git config --global --add url.\"git@github.com:\".insteadOf \"https://github.com/\"\n</code></pre><p>This repository publishes two libraries that may be imported by other projects: <code>github.com/hashicorp/vault/api</code> and <code>github.com/hashicorp/vault/sdk</code>.</p><p>Note that this repository also contains Vault (the product), and as with most Go projects, Vault uses Go modules to manage its dependencies. The mechanism to do that is the <a href=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hashicorp/vault/main/go.mod\">go.mod</a> file. As it happens, the presence of that file also makes it theoretically possible to import Vault as a dependency into other projects. Some other projects have made a practice of doing so in order to take advantage of testing tooling that was developed for testing Vault itself. This is not, and has never been, a supported way to use the Vault project. We aren't likely to fix bugs relating to failure to import <code>github.com/hashicorp/vault</code> into your project.</p><p>See also the section \"Docker-based tests\" below.</p><p>Vault has comprehensive <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acceptance_testing\">acceptance tests</a> covering most of the features of the secret and auth methods.</p><p>If you're working on a feature of a secret or auth method and want to verify it is functioning (and also hasn't broken anything else), we recommend running the acceptance tests.</p><p> The acceptance tests create/destroy/modify , which may incur real costs in some cases. In the presence of a bug, it is technically possible that broken backends could leave dangling data behind. Therefore, please run the acceptance tests at your own risk. At the very least, we recommend running them in their own private account for whatever backend you're testing.</p><p>To run the acceptance tests, invoke :</p><pre><code>$ make testacc TEST=./builtin/logical/consul\n...\n</code></pre><p>The  variable is required, and you should specify the folder where the backend is. The  variable is recommended to filter down to a specific resource to test, since testing all of them at once can sometimes take a very long time.</p><p>Acceptance tests typically require other environment variables to be set for things such as access keys. The test itself should error early and tell you what to set, so it is not documented here.</p><p>We have created an experimental new testing mechanism inspired by NewTestCluster. An example of how to use it:</p><pre><code>import (\n  \"testing\"\n  \"github.com/hashicorp/vault/sdk/helper/testcluster/docker\"\n)\n\nfunc Test_Something_With_Docker(t *testing.T) {\n  opts := &amp;docker.DockerClusterOptions{\n    ImageRepo: \"hashicorp/vault\", // or \"hashicorp/vault-enterprise\"\n    ImageTag:    \"latest\",\n  }\n  cluster := docker.NewTestDockerCluster(t, opts)\n  defer cluster.Cleanup()\n  \n  client := cluster.Nodes()[0].APIClient()\n  _, err := client.Logical().Read(\"sys/storage/raft/configuration\")\n  if err != nil {\n    t.Fatal(err)\n  }\n}\n</code></pre><pre><code>import (\n  \"testing\"\n  \"github.com/hashicorp/vault/sdk/helper/testcluster/docker\"\n)\n\nfunc Test_Something_With_Docker(t *testing.T) {\n  opts := &amp;docker.DockerClusterOptions{\n    ImageRepo: \"hashicorp/vault-enterprise\",\n    ImageTag:  \"latest\",\n\tVaultLicense: licenseString, // not a path, the actual license bytes\n  }\n  cluster := docker.NewTestDockerCluster(t, opts)\n  defer cluster.Cleanup()\n}\n</code></pre><p>Here is a more realistic example of how we use it in practice. DefaultOptions uses : as the repo and tag, but it also looks at the environment variable VAULT_BINARY. If populated, it will copy the local file referenced by VAULT_BINARY into the container. This is useful when testing local changes.</p><p>Instead of setting the VaultLicense option, you can set the VAULT_LICENSE_CI environment variable, which is better than committing a license to version control.</p><p>Optionally you can set COMMIT_SHA, which will be appended to the image name we build as a debugging convenience.</p><pre><code>func Test_Custom_Build_With_Docker(t *testing.T) {\n  opts := docker.DefaultOptions(t)\n  cluster := docker.NewTestDockerCluster(t, opts)\n  defer cluster.Cleanup()\n}\n</code></pre><p>There are a variety of helpers in the <code>github.com/hashicorp/vault/sdk/helper/testcluster</code> package, e.g. these tests below will create a pair of 3-node clusters and link them using PR or DR replication respectively, and fail if the replication state doesn't become healthy before the passed context expires.</p><p>Again, as written, these depend on having a Vault Enterprise binary locally and the env var VAULT_BINARY set to point to it, as well as having VAULT_LICENSE_CI set.</p><pre><code>func TestStandardPerfReplication_Docker(t *testing.T) {\n  opts := docker.DefaultOptions(t)\n  r, err := docker.NewReplicationSetDocker(t, opts)\n  if err != nil {\n      t.Fatal(err)\n  }\n  defer r.Cleanup()\n\n  ctx, cancel := context.WithTimeout(context.Background(), time.Minute)\n  defer cancel()\n  err = r.StandardPerfReplication(ctx)\n  if err != nil {\n    t.Fatal(err)\n  }\n}\n\nfunc TestStandardDRReplication_Docker(t *testing.T) {\n  opts := docker.DefaultOptions(t)\n  r, err := docker.NewReplicationSetDocker(t, opts)\n  if err != nil {\n    t.Fatal(err)\n  }\n  defer r.Cleanup()\n\n  ctx, cancel := context.WithTimeout(context.Background(), time.Minute)\n  defer cancel()\n  err = r.StandardDRReplication(ctx)\n  if err != nil {\n    t.Fatal(err)\n  }\n}\n</code></pre><p>Finally, here's an example of running an existing OSS docker test with a custom binary:</p><pre><code>$ GOOS=linux make dev\n$ VAULT_BINARY=$(pwd)/bin/vault go test -run 'TestRaft_Configuration_Docker' ./vault/external_tests/raft/raft_binary\nok      github.com/hashicorp/vault/vault/external_tests/raft/raft_binary        20.960s\n</code></pre>","contentLength":9534,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"badlogic/pi-mono","url":"https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono","date":1769568343,"author":"","guid":424111,"unread":true,"content":"<p>AI agent toolkit: coding agent CLI, unified LLM API, TUI &amp; web UI libraries, Slack bot, vLLM pods</p><p>Tools for building AI agents and managing LLM deployments.</p><pre><code>npm install          # Install all dependencies\nnpm run build        # Build all packages\nnpm run check        # Lint, format, and type check\n./test.sh            # Run tests (skips LLM-dependent tests without API keys)\n./pi-test.sh         # Run pi from sources (must be run from repo root)\n</code></pre><blockquote><p> requires  to be run first.

In this challenge, you will learn everything you need to be a python programmer and the whole concept of programming. In the end of the challenge you will get a  programming challenge certificate.</p><p>Python is a high-level programming language for general-purpose programming. It is an open source, interpreted, object-oriented programming language. Python was created by a Dutch programmer, Guido van Rossum. The name of the Python programming language was derived from a British sketch comedy series, <em>Monty Python's Flying Circus</em>. The first version was released on February 20, 1991. This 30 days of Python challenge will help you learn the latest version of Python, Python 3 step by step. The topics are broken down into 30 days, where each day contains several topics with easy-to-understand explanations, real-world examples, and many hands on exercises and projects.</p><p>This challenge is designed for beginners and professionals who want to learn python programming language. It may take 30 to 100 days to complete the challenge. People who actively participate in the telegram group have a high probability of completing the challenge.</p><p>This challenge is easy to read, written in conversational English, engaging, motivating and at the same time, it is very demanding.

You can leave your testimonial on this <a href=\"https://www.asabeneh.com/testimonials\">link</a></p><p>It is a programming language which is very close to human language and because of that, it is easy to learn and use. Python is used by various industries and companies (including Google). It has been used to develop web applications, desktop applications, system administration, and machine learning libraries. Python is a highly embraced language in the data science and machine learning community. I hope this is enough to convince you to start learning Python. Python is eating the world and you are killing it before it eats you.</p><p>To run a python script you need to install python. Let's <a href=\"https://www.python.org/\">download</a> python. If your are a windows user, click the button encircled in red.</p><p>If you are a macOS user, click the button encircled in red.</p><p>To check if python is installed write the following command on your device terminal.</p><p>As you can see from the terminal, I am using  version at the moment. Your version of Python might be different from mine by but it should be 3.6 or above. If you manage to see the python version, well done. Python has been installed on your machine. Continue to the next section.</p><p>Python is an interpreted scripting language, so it does not need to be compiled. It means it executes the code line by line. Python comes with a <em>Python Shell (Python Interactive Shell)</em>. It is used to execute a single python command and get the result.</p><p>Python Shell waits for the Python code from the user. When you enter the code, it interprets the code and shows the result in the next line. Open your terminal or command prompt(cmd) and write:</p><p>The Python interactive shell is opened and it is waiting for you to write Python code(Python script). You will write your Python script next to this symbol &gt;&gt;&gt; and then click Enter. Let us write our very first script on the Python scripting shell.</p><p>Well done, you wrote your first Python script on Python interactive shell. How do we close the Python interactive shell ? To close the shell, next to this symbol &gt;&gt;&gt; write  command and press Enter.</p><p>Now, you know how to open the Python interactive shell and how to exit from it.</p><p>Python will give you results if you write scripts that Python understands, if not it returns errors. Let's make a deliberate mistake and see what Python will return.</p><p>As you can see from the returned error, Python is so clever that it knows the mistake we made and which was <em>Syntax Error: invalid syntax</em>. Using x as multiplication in Python is a syntax error because (x) is not a valid syntax in Python. Instead of () we use asterisk (*) for multiplication. The returned error clearly shows what to fix.</p><p>The process of identifying and removing errors from a program is called . Let us debug it by putting * in place of .</p><p>Our bug was fixed, the code ran and we got a result we were expecting. As a programmer you will see such kind of errors on daily basis. It is good to know how to debug. To be good at debugging you should understand what kind of errors you are facing. Some of the Python errors you may encounter are , , , , , , , , ,  etc. We will see more about different Python  in later sections.</p><p>Let us practice more how to use Python interactive shell. Go to your terminal or command prompt and write the word .</p><p>The Python interactive shell is opened. Let us do some basic mathematical operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, modulus, exponentiation).</p><p>Let us do some maths first before we write any Python code:</p><ul></ul><p>In python, we have the following additional operations:</p><ul><li>3 % 2 = 1 =&gt; which means finding the remainder</li><li>3 // 2 = 1 =&gt; which means removing the remainder</li></ul><p>Let us change the above mathematical expressions to Python code. The Python shell has been opened and let us write a comment at the very beginning of the shell.</p><p>A  is a part of the code which is not executed by python. So we can leave some text in our code to make our code more readable. Python does not run the comment part. A comment in python starts with hash(#) symbol. This is how you write a comment in python</p><pre><code> # comment starts with hash\n # this is a python comment, because it starts with a (#) symbol\n</code></pre><p>Before we move on to the next section, let us practice more on the Python interactive shell. Close the opened shell by writing  on the shell and open it again and let us practice how to write text on the Python shell.</p><h3>Installing Visual Studio Code</h3><p>The Python interactive shell is good to try and test small script codes but it will not be for a big project. In real work environment, developers use different code editors to write codes. In this 30 days of Python programming challenge, we will use Visual Studio Code. Visual Studio Code is a very popular open source text editor. I am a fan of vscode and I would recommend to <a href=\"https://code.visualstudio.com/\">download</a> visual studio code, but if you are in favor of other editors, feel free to follow with what you have.</p><p>If you installed visual studio code, let us see how to use it. If you prefer a video, you can follow this Visual Studio Code for Python <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bn7Cx4z-vSo\">Video tutorial</a></p><h4>How to use visual studio code</h4><p>Open the visual studio code by double clicking the visual studio icon. When you open it you will get this kind of interface. Try to interact with the labeled icons.</p><p>Create a folder named 30DaysOfPython on your desktop. Then open it using visual studio code.</p><p>After opening it, you will see shortcuts for creating files and folders inside of 30DaysOfPython project's directory. As you can see below, I have created the very first file, . You can do the same.</p><p>After a long day of coding, you want to close your code editor, right? This is how you will close the opened project.</p><p>Congratulations, you have finished setting up the development environment. Let us start coding.</p><p>A Python script can be written in Python interactive shell or in the code editor. A Python file has an extension .py.</p><p>An indentation is a white space in a text. Indentation in many languages is used to increase code readability; however, Python uses indentation to create blocks of code. In other programming languages, curly brackets are used to create code blocks instead of indentation. One of the common bugs when writing Python code is incorrect indentation.</p><p>Comments play a crucial role in enhancing code readability and allowing developers to leave notes within their code. In Python, any text preceded by a hash (#) symbol is considered a comment and is not executed when the code runs.</p><p><strong>Example: Single Line Comment</strong></p><pre><code>    # This is the first comment\n    # This is the second comment\n    # Python is eating the world\n</code></pre><p><strong>Example: Multiline Comment</strong></p><p>Triple quote can be used for multiline comment if it is not assigned to a variable</p><pre><code>\"\"\"This is multiline comment\nmultiline comment takes multiple lines.\npython is eating the world\n\"\"\"\n</code></pre><p>In Python there are several types of data types. Let us get started with the most common ones. Different data types will be covered in detail in other sections. For the time being, let us just go through the different data types and get familiar with them. You do not have to have a clear understanding now.</p><ul><li>Integer: Integer(negative, zero and positive) numbers Example: ... -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3 ...</li><li>Float: Decimal number Example ... -3.5, -2.25, -1.0, 0.0, 1.1, 2.2, 3.5 ...</li><li>Complex Example 1 + j, 2 + 4j</li></ul><p>A collection of one or more characters under a single or double quote. If a string is more than one sentence then we use a triple quote.</p><pre><code>'Asabeneh'\n'Finland'\n'Python'\n'I love teaching'\n'I hope you are enjoying the first day of 30DaysOfPython Challenge'\n</code></pre><p>A boolean data type is either a True or False value. T and F should be always uppercase.</p><pre><code>    True  #  Is the light on? If it is on, then the value is True\n    False # Is the light on? If it is off, then the value is False\n</code></pre><p>Python list is an ordered collection which allows to store different data type items. A list is similar to an array in JavaScript.</p><pre><code>[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]  # all are the same data types - a list of numbers\n['Banana', 'Orange', 'Mango', 'Avocado'] # all the same data types - a list of strings (fruits)\n['Finland','Estonia', 'Sweden','Norway'] # all the same data types - a list of strings (countries)\n['Banana', 10, False, 9.81] # different data types in the list - string, integer, boolean and float\n</code></pre><p>A Python dictionary object is an unordered collection of data in a key value pair format.</p><pre><code>{\n'first_name':'Asabeneh',\n'last_name':'Yetayeh',\n'country':'Finland',\n'age':250,\n'is_married':True,\n'skills':['JS', 'React', 'Node', 'Python']\n}\n</code></pre><p>A tuple is an ordered collection of different data types like list but tuples can not be modified once they are created. They are immutable.</p><pre><code>('Asabeneh', 'Pawel', 'Brook', 'Abraham', 'Lidiya') # Names\n</code></pre><pre><code>('Earth', 'Jupiter', 'Neptune', 'Mars', 'Venus', 'Saturn', 'Uranus', 'Mercury') # planets\n</code></pre><p>A set is a collection of data types similar to list and tuple. Unlike list and tuple, set is not an ordered collection of items. Like in Mathematics, set in Python stores only unique items.</p><p>In later sections, we will go in detail about each and every Python data type.</p><pre><code>{2, 4, 3, 5}\n{3.14, 9.81, 2.7} # order is not important in set\n</code></pre><p>To check the data type of certain data/variable we use the  function. In the following terminal you will see different python data types:</p><p>First open your project folder, 30DaysOfPython. If you don't have this folder, create a folder name called 30DaysOfPython. Inside this folder, create a file called helloworld.py. Now, let's do what we did on python interactive shell using visual studio code.</p><p>The Python interactive shell was printing without using  but on visual studio code to see our result we should use a built in function . The  built-in function takes one or more arguments as follows <em>print('arument1', 'argument2', 'argument3')</em>. See the examples below.</p><p>The file name is </p><pre><code># Day 1 - 30DaysOfPython Challenge\n\nprint(2 + 3)             # addition(+)\nprint(3 - 1)             # subtraction(-)\nprint(2 * 3)             # multiplication(*)\nprint(3 / 2)             # division(/)\nprint(3 ** 2)            # exponential(**)\nprint(3 % 2)             # modulus(%)\nprint(3 // 2)            # Floor division operator(//)\n\n# Checking data types\nprint(type(10))          # Int\nprint(type(3.14))        # Float\nprint(type(1 + 3j))      # Complex number\nprint(type('Asabeneh'))  # String\nprint(type([1, 2, 3]))   # List\nprint(type({'name':'Asabeneh'})) # Dictionary\nprint(type({9.8, 3.14, 2.7}))    # Set\nprint(type((9.8, 3.14, 2.7)))    # Tuple\n</code></pre><p>To run the python file check the image below. You can run the python file either by running the green button on Visual Studio Code or by typing  in the terminal .</p><p>🌕 You are amazing.

To speak mathematically, the goal of the speedrun is *to obtain a probability model of language which assigns a probability of at least <code>math.exp(-3.28 * 10485760)</code> to the first 10,485,760 tokens of the FineWeb valset. Hence, e.g., we allow evaluation at any sequence length, so long as we still have a valid probability model of language.</p><h3>Timing change after record 21</h3><p>After the 21st record, we made two changes to the timing. First, there used to be an initial \"grace period\" of 10 untimed steps to allow kernel warmup. We replaced this with an explicit kernel-warmup section which is untimed and uses dummy data. This results in an extra runtime of 850ms from the 10 extra timed steps. Second, we banned the use of <code>torch._inductor.config.coordinate_descent_tuning</code>. This saves ~25min of untimed pre-run compilation, but results in an extra runtime of ~3s.</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://x.com/alexjc/status/1881410039639863622\">@alexjc's 01/20/2025 2.77-minute TokenMonster-based record</a>. This record is technically outside the rules of the speedrun, since we specified that the train/val tokens must be kept fixed. However, it's very interesting, and worth including. The run is not more data-efficient; rather, the speedup comes from the improved tokenizer allowing the vocabulary size to be reduced (nearly halved!) while preserving the same bytes-per-token, which saves lots of parameters and FLOPs in the head and embeddings.</li></ul><h2>Speedrun track 2: GPT-2 Medium</h2><p>The target loss for this track is lowered from 3.28 to 2.92, as per Andrej Karpathy's 350M-parameter llm.c baseline. This baseline generates a model with performance similar to the original GPT-2 Medium, whereas the first track's baseline generates a model on par with GPT-2 Small. All other rules remain the same.</p><blockquote><p>Note: <code>torch._inductor.config.coordinate_descent_tuning</code> is turned on after the record 6 (*).</p></blockquote><h3>Q: What is the point of NanoGPT speedrunning?</h3><p>A: The officially stated goal of NanoGPT speedrunning is as follows: . But for something a little more verbose involving an argument for good benchmarking, here's some kind of manifesto, adorned with a blessing from the master. <a href=\"https://x.com/karpathy/status/1846790537262571739\">https://x.com/karpathy/status/1846790537262571739</a></p><h3>Q: What makes \"NanoGPT speedrunning\" not just another idiosyncratic benchmark?</h3><p>A: Because it is a  benchmark. In particular, if you attain a new speed record (using whatever method you want), there is an open invitation for you to post that record (on arXiv or X) and thereby vacuum up all the clout for yourself. I will even help you do it by reposting you as much as I can.</p><h3>Q: NanoGPT speedrunning is cool and all, but meh it probably won't scale and is just overfitting to val loss</h3><p>A: This is hard to refute, since \"at scale\" is an infinite category (what if the methods stop working only for &gt;100T models?), making it impossible to fully prove. Also, I would agree that some of the methods used in the speedrun are unlikely to scale, particularly those which <em>impose additional structure</em> on the network, such as logit softcapping. But if the reader cares about 1.5B models, they might be convinced by this result:</p><p><em>Straightforwardly scaling up the speedrun (10/18/24 version) to 1.5B parameters yields a model with GPT-2 (1.5B)-level HellaSwag performance 2.5x more cheaply than <a href=\"https://github.com/karpathy/llm.c/discussions/677\">@karpathy's baseline</a> ($233 instead of $576):</em></p><p>Muon is defined as follows:</p><p>Where NewtonSchulz5 is the following Newton-Schulz iteration [2, 3], which approximately replaces  with  where .</p><pre><code>@torch.compile\ndef zeroth_power_via_newtonschulz5(G, steps=5, eps=1e-7):\n    assert len(G.shape) == 2\n    a, b, c = (3.4445, -4.7750,  2.0315)\n    X = G.bfloat16() / (G.norm() + eps)\n    if G.size(0) &gt; G.size(1):\n        X = X.T \n    for _ in range(steps):\n        A = X @ X.T\n        B = b * A + c * A @ A\n        X = a * X + B @ X\n    if G.size(0) &gt; G.size(1):\n        X = X.T \n    return X.to(G.dtype)\n</code></pre><p>For this training scenario, Muon has the following favorable properties:</p><ul><li>Lower memory usage than Adam</li><li>~1.5x better sample-efficiency</li></ul><p>Many of the choices made to generate this optimizer were obtained experimentally by our pursuit of <a href=\"https://github.com/KellerJordan/cifar10-airbench\">CIFAR-10 speedrunning</a>. In particular, we experimentally obtained the following practices:</p><ul><li>Using Nesterov momentum inside the update, with orthogonalization applied after momentum.</li><li>Using a specifically quintic Newton-Schulz iteration as the method of orthogonalization.</li><li>Using non-convergent coefficients for the quintic polynomial in order to maximize slope at zero, and thereby minimize the number of necessary Newton-Schulz iterations. It turns out that the variance doesn't actually matter that much, so we end up with a quintic that rapidly converges to the range 0.68, 1.13 upon repeated application, rather than converging more slowly to 1.</li><li>Running the Newton-Schulz iteration in bfloat16 (whereas Shampoo implementations often depend on inverse-pth-roots run in fp32 or fp64).</li></ul><p>Our use of a Newton-Schulz iteration for orthogonalization traces to <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20325\">Bernstein &amp; Newhouse (2024)</a>, who suggested it as a way to compute Shampoo [5, 6] preconditioners, and theoretically explored Shampoo without preconditioner accumulation. In particular, Jeremy Bernstein @jxbz sent us the draft, which caused us to experiment with various Newton-Schulz iterations as the orthogonalization method for this optimizer. If we had used SVD instead of a Newton-Schulz iteration, this optimizer would have been too slow to be useful. Bernstein &amp; Newhouse also pointed out that Shampoo without preconditioner accumulation is equivalent to steepest descent in the spectral norm, and therefore Shampoo can be thought of as a way to smooth out spectral steepest descent. The proposed optimizer can be thought of as a second way of smoothing spectral steepest descent, with a different set of memory and runtime tradeoffs compared to Shampoo.</p><ul><li>To run experiments on fewer GPUs, simply modify  to have a different .

Potential for Deepfakes and Disinformation: High-quality synthetic speech can be misused to create convincing fake audio content for impersonation, fraud, or spreading disinformation. Users must ensure transcripts are reliable, check content accuracy, and avoid using generated content in misleading ways.
