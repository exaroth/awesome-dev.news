It is similar to Pytest but specialized for unit testing LLM outputs. DeepEval incorporates the latest research to evaluate LLM outputs based on metrics such as G-Eval, hallucination, answer relevancy, RAGAS, etc., which uses LLMs and various other NLP models that runs  for evaluation.</p><p>Whether your LLM applications are RAG pipelines, chatbots, AI agents, implemented via LangChain or LlamaIndex, DeepEval has you covered.

Create an account <a href=\"https://app.confident-ai.com?utm_source=GitHub\">here.</a></p></blockquote><p>Let's pretend your LLM application is a RAG based customer support chatbot; here's how DeepEval can help test what you've built.</p><h2>Create an account (highly recommended)</h2><p>Using the  platform will allow you to generate sharable testing reports on the cloud. It is free, takes no additional code to setup, and we highly recommend giving it a try.</p><p>Follow the instructions in the CLI to create an account, copy your API key, and paste it into the CLI. All test cases will automatically be logged (find more information on data privacy <a href=\"https://deepeval.com/docs/data-privacy?utm_source=GitHub\">here</a>).</p><h2>Writing your first test case</h2><p>Open  and write your first test case to run an  evaluation using DeepEval, which treats your LLM app as a black-box:</p><pre><code>import pytest\nfrom deepeval import assert_test\nfrom deepeval.metrics import GEval\nfrom deepeval.test_case import LLMTestCase, LLMTestCaseParams\n\ndef test_case():\n    correctness_metric = GEval(\n        name=\"Correctness\",\n        criteria=\"Determine if the 'actual output' is correct based on the 'expected output'.\",\n        evaluation_params=[LLMTestCaseParams.ACTUAL_OUTPUT, LLMTestCaseParams.EXPECTED_OUTPUT],\n        threshold=0.5\n    )\n    test_case = LLMTestCase(\n        input=\"What if these shoes don't fit?\",\n        # Replace this with the actual output from your LLM application\n        actual_output=\"You have 30 days to get a full refund at no extra cost.\",\n        expected_output=\"We offer a 30-day full refund at no extra costs.\",\n        retrieval_context=[\"All customers are eligible for a 30 day full refund at no extra costs.\"]\n    )\n    assert_test(test_case, [correctness_metric])\n</code></pre><p>Set your  as an environment variable (you can also evaluate using your own custom model, for more details visit <a href=\"https://deepeval.com/docs/metrics-introduction#using-a-custom-llm?utm_source=GitHub\">this part of our docs</a>):</p><pre><code>export OPENAI_API_KEY=\"...\"\n</code></pre><p>And finally, run  in the CLI:</p><pre><code>deepeval test run test_chatbot.py\n</code></pre><p><strong>Congratulations! Your test case should have passed ‚úÖ</strong> Let's breakdown what happened.</p><ul><li>The variable  mimics a user input, and  is a placeholder for what your application's supposed to output based on this input.</li><li>The variable  represents the ideal answer for a given , and <a href=\"https://deepeval.com/docs/metrics-llm-evals\"></a> is a research-backed metric provided by  for you to evaluate your LLM output's on any custom custom with human-like accuracy.</li><li>In this example, the metric  is correctness of the  based on the provided .</li><li>All metric scores range from 0 - 1, which the  threshold ultimately determines if your test have passed or not.</li></ul><p><a href=\"https://deepeval.com/docs/getting-started?utm_source=GitHub\">Read our documentation</a> for more information on more options to run end-to-end evaluation, how to use additional metrics, create your own custom metrics, and tutorials on how to integrate with other tools like LangChain and LlamaIndex.</p><h2>Evaluating Nested Components</h2><p>If you wish to evaluate individual components within your LLM app, you need to run  evals - a powerful way to evaluate any component within an LLM system.</p><p>Simply trace \"components\" such as LLM calls, retrievers, tool calls, and agents within your LLM application using the  decorator to apply metrics on a component-level. Tracing with  is non-instrusive (learn more <a href=\"https://deepeval.com/docs/evaluation-llm-tracing#dont-be-worried-about-tracing\">here</a>) and helps you avoid rewriting your codebase just for evals:</p><pre><code>from deepeval.tracing import observe, update_current_span\nfrom deepeval.test_case import LLMTestCase\nfrom deepeval.dataset import Golden\nfrom deepeval.metrics import GEval\nfrom deepeval import evaluate\n\ncorrectness = GEval(name=\"Correctness\", criteria=\"Determine if the 'actual output' is correct based on the 'expected output'.\", evaluation_params=[LLMTestCaseParams.ACTUAL_OUTPUT, LLMTestCaseParams.EXPECTED_OUTPUT])\n\n@observe(metrics=[correctness])\ndef inner_component():\n    # Component can be anything from an LLM call, retrieval, agent, tool use, etc.\n    update_current_span(test_case=LLMTestCase(input=\"...\", actual_output=\"...\"))\n    return\n\n@observe\ndef llm_app(input: str):\n    inner_component()\n    return\n\nevaluate(observed_callback=llm_app, goldens=[Golden(input=\"Hi!\")])\n</code></pre><p>You can learn everything about component-level evaluations <a href=\"https://www.deepeval.com/docs/evaluation-component-level-llm-evals\">here.</a></p><h2>Evaluating Without Pytest Integration</h2><p>Alternatively, you can evaluate without Pytest, which is more suited for a notebook environment.</p><pre><code>from deepeval import evaluate\nfrom deepeval.metrics import AnswerRelevancyMetric\nfrom deepeval.test_case import LLMTestCase\n\nanswer_relevancy_metric = AnswerRelevancyMetric(threshold=0.7)\ntest_case = LLMTestCase(\n    input=\"What if these shoes don't fit?\",\n    # Replace this with the actual output from your LLM application\n    actual_output=\"We offer a 30-day full refund at no extra costs.\",\n    retrieval_context=[\"All customers are eligible for a 30 day full refund at no extra costs.\"]\n)\nevaluate([test_case], [answer_relevancy_metric])\n</code></pre><p>DeepEval is extremely modular, making it easy for anyone to use any of our metrics. Continuing from the previous example:</p><pre><code>from deepeval.metrics import AnswerRelevancyMetric\nfrom deepeval.test_case import LLMTestCase\n\nanswer_relevancy_metric = AnswerRelevancyMetric(threshold=0.7)\ntest_case = LLMTestCase(\n    input=\"What if these shoes don't fit?\",\n    # Replace this with the actual output from your LLM application\n    actual_output=\"We offer a 30-day full refund at no extra costs.\",\n    retrieval_context=[\"All customers are eligible for a 30 day full refund at no extra costs.\"]\n)\n\nanswer_relevancy_metric.measure(test_case)\nprint(answer_relevancy_metric.score)\n# All metrics also offer an explanation\nprint(answer_relevancy_metric.reason)\n</code></pre><p>Note that some metrics are for RAG pipelines, while others are for fine-tuning. Make sure to use our docs to pick the right one for your use case.</p><h2>Evaluating a Dataset / Test Cases in Bulk</h2><p>In DeepEval, a dataset is simply a collection of test cases. Here is how you can evaluate these in bulk:</p><pre><code>import pytest\nfrom deepeval import assert_test\nfrom deepeval.metrics import HallucinationMetric, AnswerRelevancyMetric\nfrom deepeval.test_case import LLMTestCase\nfrom deepeval.dataset import EvaluationDataset\n\nfirst_test_case = LLMTestCase(input=\"...\", actual_output=\"...\", context=[\"...\"])\nsecond_test_case = LLMTestCase(input=\"...\", actual_output=\"...\", context=[\"...\"])\n\ndataset = EvaluationDataset(test_cases=[first_test_case, second_test_case])\n\n@pytest.mark.parametrize(\n    \"test_case\",\n    dataset,\n)\ndef test_customer_chatbot(test_case: LLMTestCase):\n    hallucination_metric = HallucinationMetric(threshold=0.3)\n    answer_relevancy_metric = AnswerRelevancyMetric(threshold=0.5)\n    assert_test(test_case, [hallucination_metric, answer_relevancy_metric])\n</code></pre><pre><code># Run this in the CLI, you can also add an optional -n flag to run tests in parallel\ndeepeval test run test_&lt;filename&gt;.py -n 4\n</code></pre><p>Alternatively, although we recommend using , you can evaluate a dataset/test cases without using our Pytest integration:</p><pre><code>from deepeval import evaluate\n...\n\nevaluate(dataset, [answer_relevancy_metric])\n# or\ndataset.evaluate([answer_relevancy_metric])\n</code></pre><ol><li>Curate/annotate evaluation datasets on the cloud</li><li>Benchmark LLM app using dataset, and compare with previous iterations to experiment which models/prompts works best</li><li>Fine-tune metrics for custom results</li><li>Debug evaluation results via LLM traces</li><li>Monitor &amp; evaluate LLM responses in product to improve datasets with real-world data</li></ol><p>Everything on Confident AI, including how to use Confident is available <a href=\"https://documentation.confident-ai.com/docs?utm_source=GitHub\">here</a>.</p><p>To begin, login from the CLI:</p><p>Follow the instructions to log in, create your account, and paste your API key into the CLI.</p><p>Now, run your test file again:</p><pre><code>deepeval test run test_chatbot.py\n</code></pre><p>You should see a link displayed in the CLI once the test has finished running.

However we recommend to not blindly download and execute scripts as sudo. But if you feel like it, you can of course use it. See below:</p></blockquote><ol start=\"2\"><li><p>Run the command below in order to start the container on Linux and without a web server or reverse proxy (like Apache, Nginx, Caddy, Cloudflare Tunnel and else) already in place:</p><pre><code># For Linux and without a web server or reverse proxy (like Apache, Nginx, Caddy, Cloudflare Tunnel and else) already in place:\nsudo docker run \\\n--init \\\n--sig-proxy=false \\\n--name nextcloud-aio-mastercontainer \\\n--restart always \\\n--publish 80:80 \\\n--publish 8080:8080 \\\n--publish 8443:8443 \\\n--volume nextcloud_aio_mastercontainer:/mnt/docker-aio-config \\\n--volume /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:ro \\\nghcr.io/nextcloud-releases/all-in-one:latest\n</code></pre><p>Note: You may be interested in adjusting Nextcloud‚Äôs datadir to store the files in a different location than the default docker volume.

E.g. <code>https://ip.address.of.this.server:8080</code> ‚ö†Ô∏è  do always use an ip-address if you access this port and not a domain as HSTS might block access to it later! (It is also expected that this port uses a self-signed certificate due to security concerns which you need to accept in your browser)<p> If your firewall/router has port 80 and 8443 open/forwarded and you point a domain to your server, you can get a valid certificate automatically by opening the Nextcloud AIO Interface via:</p><code>https://your-domain-that-points-to-this-server.tld:8443</code></p></li><li><p>Please do not forget to open port  and  in your firewall/router for the Talk container!</p></li></ol><h3>Where can I find additional documentation?</h3><p>Nextcloud AIO is inspired by projects like Portainer that manage the docker daemon by talking to it through the docker socket directly. This concept allows a user to install only one container with a single command that does the heavy lifting of creating and managing all containers that are needed in order to provide a Nextcloud installation with most features included. It also makes updating a breeze and is not bound to the host system (and its slow updates) anymore as everything is in containers. Additionally, it is very easy to handle from a user perspective because a simple interface for managing your Nextcloud AIO installation is provided.</p><p>See <a href=\"https://github.com/nextcloud/all-in-one/issues/5251\">this issue</a> for a list of feature requests that need help by contributors.</p><h3>How many users are possible?</h3><h3>Are reverse proxies supported?</h3><h3>Which ports are mandatory to be open in your firewall/router?</h3><p>Only those (if you access the Mastercontainer Interface internally via port 8080):</p><ul><li> for the Apache container</li><li> if you want to enable http3 for the Apache container</li><li> and  for the Talk container</li></ul><h3>Explanation of used ports</h3><ul><li>: Mastercontainer Interface with self-signed certificate (works always, also if only access via IP-address is possible, e.g. <code>https://ip.address.of.this.server:8080/</code>) ‚ö†Ô∏è  do always use an ip-address if you access this port and not a domain as HSTS might block access to it later!

This is a privacy concern and you will need to look for other solutions if it's unacceptable for you.</li><li>Using Cloudflare Tunnel might potentially slow down Nextcloud since local access via the configured domain is not possible because TLS termination is in that case offloaded to Cloudflare's infrastructure. There is no way to disable this behavior in Cloudflare Tunnel.</li><li>Cloudflare only supports uploading files up to 100&nbsp;MB in the free plan, if you try to upload bigger files you will get an error (413 - Payload Too Large) if no chunking is used (e.g. for public uploads in the web, or if chunks are configured to be bigger than 100 MB in the clients or the web). If you need to upload bigger files, you need to disable the proxy option in your DNS settings. Note that this will both disable Cloudflare DDoS protection and Cloudflare Tunnel as these services require the proxy option to be enabled.</li><li>Cloudflare only allows a max timeout of 100s for requests which is not configurable. This means that any server-side processing e.g. for assembling chunks for big files during upload that take longer than 100s will simply not work. See <a href=\"https://github.com/nextcloud/server/issues/19223\">https://github.com/nextcloud/server/issues/19223</a>. If you need to upload big files reliably, you need to disable the proxy option in your DNS settings. Note that this will both disable Cloudflare DDoS protection and Cloudflare Tunnel as these services require the proxy option to be enabled.</li><li>It is known that the in AIO included collabora (Nextcloud Office) does not work out of the box behind Cloudflare. To make it work, you need to add all <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/ips/\">Cloudflare IP-ranges</a> to the wopi-allowlist in <code>https://yourdomain.com/settings/admin/richdocuments</code></li><li>The built-in turn-server for Nextcloud Talk will not work behind Cloudflare Tunnel since it needs a separate port (by default 3478 or as chosen) available on the same domain. If you still want to use the feature, you will need to install your own turnserver or use a publicly available one and adjust and test your stun and turn settings in <code>https://yourdomain.com/settings/admin/talk</code>.</li><li>If you get an error in Nextcloud's admin overview that the HSTS header is not set correctly, you might need to enable it in Cloudflare manually.</li><li>If you are using AIO's built-in Reverse Proxy and don't use your own, then the certificate issuing may possibly not work out-of-the-box because Cloudflare might block the attempt. In that case you need to disable the Proxy feature at least temporarily in order to make it work. Note that this isn't an option if you need Cloudflare Tunnel as disabling the proxy would also disable Cloudflare Tunnel which would in turn make your server unreachable for the verification.

So please follow the <a href=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nextcloud/all-in-one/main/reverse-proxy.md\">reverse proxy documentation</a> where is documented how to make it run behind a Cloudflare Tunnel. However please see the <a href=\"https://github.com/nextcloud/all-in-one#notes-on-cloudflare-proxytunnel\">caveats</a> before proceeding.</p><h3>How to run Nextcloud via Tailscale?</h3><h3>How to get Nextcloud running using the ACME DNS-challenge?</h3><h3>How to run Nextcloud locally? No domain wanted, or wanting intranet access within your LAN.</h3><p>If you do not want to open Nextcloud to the public internet, you may have a look at the following documentation on how to set it up locally: <a href=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nextcloud/all-in-one/main/local-instance.md\">local-instance.md</a>, but keep in mind you're still required to have https working properly.</p><h3>Can I use an ip-address for Nextcloud instead of a domain?</h3><p>No and it will not be added. If you only want to run it locally, you may have a look at the following documentation: <a href=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nextcloud/all-in-one/main/local-instance.md\">local-instance.md</a>. Recommended is to use <a href=\"https://github.com/nextcloud/all-in-one/discussions/5439\">Tailscale</a>.</p><h3>Can I run AIO offline or in an airgapped system?</h3><p>No. This is not possible and will not be added due to multiple reasons: update checks, app installs via app-store, downloading additional docker images on demand and more.</p><h3>Are self-signed certificates supported for Nextcloud?</h3><p>No and they will not be. If you want to run it locally, without opening Nextcloud to the public internet, please have a look at the <a href=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nextcloud/all-in-one/main/local-instance.md\">local instance documentation</a>. Recommended is to use <a href=\"https://github.com/nextcloud/all-in-one/discussions/5439\">Tailscale</a>.</p><h3>Can I use AIO with multiple domains?</h3><p>No and it will not be added. However you can use <a href=\"https://github.com/nextcloud/all-in-one/raw/main/multiple-instances.md\">this feature</a> in order to create multiple AIO instances, one for each domain.</p><h3>Are other ports than the default 443 for Nextcloud supported?</h3><p>No and they will not be. If port 443 and/or 80 is blocked for you, you may use <a href=\"https://github.com/nextcloud/all-in-one/discussions/5439\">Tailscale</a> if you want to publish it online. If you already run a different service on port 443, please use a dedicated domain for Nextcloud and set it up correctly by following the <a href=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nextcloud/all-in-one/main/reverse-proxy.md\">reverse proxy documentation</a>. However in all cases the Nextcloud interface will redirect you to port 443.</p><h3>Can I run Nextcloud in a subdirectory on my domain?</h3><p>No and it will not be added. Please use a dedicated (sub-)domain for Nextcloud and set it up correctly by following the <a href=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nextcloud/all-in-one/main/reverse-proxy.md\">reverse proxy documentation</a>. Alternatively, you may use <a href=\"https://github.com/nextcloud/all-in-one/discussions/5439\">Tailscale</a> if you want to publish it online.</p><h3>How can I access Nextcloud locally?</h3><p>Please note that local access is not possible if you are running AIO behind Cloudflare Tunnel since TLS proxying is in that case offloaded to Cloudflares infrastructure. You can fix this by setting up your own reverse proxy that handles TLS proxying locally and will make the steps below work.</p><p>Please make sure that if you are running AIO behind a reverse proxy, that the reverse proxy is configured to use port 443 on the server that runs it. Otherwise the steps below will not work.</p><p>Now that this is out of the way, the recommended way how to access Nextcloud locally, is to set up a local dns-server like a pi-hole and set up a custom dns-record for that domain that points to the internal ip-adddress of your server that runs Nextcloud AIO. Below are some guides:</p><h3>How to skip the domain validation?</h3><p>If you are completely sure that you've configured everything correctly and are not able to pass the domain validation, you may skip the domain validation by adding <code>--env SKIP_DOMAIN_VALIDATION=true</code> to the docker run command of the mastercontainer (but before the last line <code>ghcr.io/nextcloud-releases/all-in-one:latest</code>! If it was started already, you will need to stop the mastercontainer, remove it (no data will be lost) and recreate it using the docker run command that you initially used).</p><h3>How to resolve firewall problems with Fedora Linux, RHEL OS, CentOS, SUSE Linux and others?</h3><p>It is known that Linux distros that use <a href=\"https://firewalld.org\">firewalld</a> as their firewall daemon have problems with docker networks. In case the containers are not able to communicate with each other, you may change your firewalld to use the iptables backend by running:</p><pre><code>sudo sed -i 's/FirewallBackend=nftables/FirewallBackend=iptables/g' /etc/firewalld/firewalld.conf\nsudo systemctl restart firewalld docker\n</code></pre><p>Afterwards it should work.</p><h3>What can I do to fix the internal or reserved ip-address error?</h3><p>If you get an error during the domain validation which states that your ip-address is an internal or reserved ip-address, you can fix this by first making sure that your domain indeed has the correct public ip-address that points to the server and then adding <code>--add-host yourdomain.com:&lt;public-ip-address&gt;</code> to the docker run command of the mastercontainer (but before the last line <code>ghcr.io/nextcloud-releases/all-in-one:latest</code>! If it was started already, you will need to stop the mastercontainer, remove it (no data will be lost) and recreate it using the docker run command that you initially used) which will allow the domain validation to work correctly. And so that you know: even if the  record of your domain should change over time, this is no problem since the mastercontainer will not make any attempt to access the chosen domain after the initial domain validation.</p><h3>Which CPU architectures are supported?</h3><p>You can check this on Linux by running: </p><ul></ul><h3>Disrecommended VPS providers</h3><ul><li> Strato VPS using Virtuozzo caused problems though ones from Q3 2023 and later should work. If your VPS has a  file and a low  limit set in it your server will likely misbehave once it reaches this limit which is very quickly reached by AIO, see <a href=\"https://github.com/nextcloud/all-in-one/discussions/1747#discussioncomment-4716164\">here</a>.</li><li>Hostingers VPS seem to miss a specific Kernel feature which is required for AIO to run correctly. See <a href=\"https://help.nextcloud.com/t/help-installing-nc-via-aio-on-vps/153956\">here</a>.</li></ul><p>In general recommended VPS are those that are KVM/non-virtualized as Docker should work best on them.</p><ul><li>SD-cards are disrecommended for AIO since they cripple the performance and they are not meant for many write operations which is needed for the database and other parts</li><li>SSD storage is recommended</li><li>HDD storage should work as well but is of course much slower than SSD storage</li></ul><h3>Are there known problems when SELinux is enabled?</h3><p>Yes. If SELinux is enabled, you might need to add the <code>--security-opt label:disable</code> option to the docker run command of the mastercontainer in order to allow it to access the docker socket (or <code>security_opt: [\"label:disable\"]</code> in compose.yaml). See <a href=\"https://github.com/nextcloud/all-in-one/discussions/485\">https://github.com/nextcloud/all-in-one/discussions/485</a></p><h3>How to change the default location of Nextcloud's Datadir?</h3><blockquote><p>[!WARNING] Do not set or adjust this value after the initial Nextcloud installation is done! If you still want to do it afterwards, see <a href=\"https://github.com/nextcloud/all-in-one/discussions/890#discussioncomment-3089903\">this</a> on how to do it.</p></blockquote><p>You can configure the Nextcloud container to use a specific directory on your host as data directory. You can do so by adding the environmental variable  to the docker run command of the mastercontainer (but before the last line <code>ghcr.io/nextcloud-releases/all-in-one:latest</code>! If it was started already, you will need to stop the mastercontainer, remove it (no data will be lost) and recreate it using the docker run command that you initially used). Allowed values for that variable are strings that start with  and are not equal to . The chosen directory or volume will then be mounted to  inside the container.</p><ul><li>An example for Linux is <code>--env NEXTCLOUD_DATADIR=\"/mnt/ncdata\"</code>. ‚ö†Ô∏è Please note: If you should be using an external BTRFS drive that is mounted to , make sure to choose a subfolder like e.g.  as datadir, since the root folder is not suited as datadir in that case. See <a href=\"https://github.com/nextcloud/all-in-one/discussions/2696\">https://github.com/nextcloud/all-in-one/discussions/2696</a>.</li><li>On macOS it might be <code>--env NEXTCLOUD_DATADIR=\"/var/nextcloud-data\"</code></li><li>For Synology it may be <code>--env NEXTCLOUD_DATADIR=\"/volume1/docker/nextcloud/data\"</code>.</li><li>On Windows it might be <code>--env NEXTCLOUD_DATADIR=\"/run/desktop/mnt/host/c/ncdata\"</code>. (This path is equivalent to  on your Windows host so you need to translate the path accordingly. Hint: the path that you enter needs to start with . Append to that the exact location on your windows host, e.g.  which is equivalent to .) ‚ö†Ô∏è : This does not work with external drives like USB or network drives and only with internal drives like SATA or NVME drives.</li><li>Another option is to provide a specific volume name here with: <code>--env NEXTCLOUD_DATADIR=\"nextcloud_aio_nextcloud_datadir\"</code>. This volume needs to be created beforehand manually by you in order to be able to use it. e.g. on Windows with: <pre><code>docker volume create ^\n--driver local ^\n--name nextcloud_aio_nextcloud_datadir ^\n-o device=\"/host_mnt/e/your/data/path\" ^\n-o type=\"none\" ^\n-o o=\"bind\"\n</code></pre> In this example, it would mount  into the volume so for a different location you need to adjust <code>/host_mnt/e/your/data/path</code> accordingly.</li></ul><h3>How to store the files/installation on a separate drive?</h3><p>‚ö†Ô∏è If you encounter errors from richdocuments in your Nextcloud logs, check in your Collabora container if the message \"Capabilities are not set for the coolforkit program.\" appears. If so, follow these steps:</p><ol><li>Stop all the containers from the AIO Interface.</li><li>Go to your terminal and delete the Collabora container (<code>docker rm nextcloud-aio-collabora</code>) AND the Collabora image (<code>docker image rm nextcloud/aio-collabora</code>).</li><li>You might also want to prune your Docker () (no data will be lost).</li><li>Restart your containers from the AIO Interface.</li></ol><p>This should solve the problem.</p><h3>How to allow the Nextcloud container to access directories on the host?</h3><p>By default, the Nextcloud container is confined and cannot access directories on the host OS. You might want to change this when you are planning to use local external storage in Nextcloud to store some files outside the data directory and can do so by adding the environmental variable  to the docker run command of the mastercontainer (but before the last line <code>ghcr.io/nextcloud-releases/all-in-one:latest</code>! If it was started already, you will need to stop the mastercontainer, remove it (no data will be lost) and recreate it using the docker run command that you initially used). Allowed values for that variable are strings that start with  and are not equal to .</p><ul><li>Two examples for Linux are <code>--env NEXTCLOUD_MOUNT=\"/mnt/\"</code> and <code>--env NEXTCLOUD_MOUNT=\"/media/\"</code>.</li><li>On macOS it might be <code>--env NEXTCLOUD_MOUNT=\"/Volumes/your_drive/\"</code></li><li>For Synology it may be <code>--env NEXTCLOUD_MOUNT=\"/volume1/\"</code>.</li><li>On Windows it might be <code>--env NEXTCLOUD_MOUNT=\"/run/desktop/mnt/host/d/your-folder/\"</code>. (This path is equivalent to  on your Windows host so you need to translate the path accordingly. Hint: the path that you enter needs to start with . Append to that the exact location on your windows host, e.g.  which is equivalent to .) ‚ö†Ô∏è : This does not work with external drives like USB or network drives and only with internal drives like SATA or NVME drives.</li></ul><p>After using this option, please make sure to apply the correct permissions to the directories that you want to use in Nextcloud. E.g. <code>sudo chown -R 33:0 /mnt/your-drive-mountpoint</code> and <code>sudo chmod -R 750 /mnt/your-drive-mountpoint</code> should make it work on Linux when you have used <code>--env NEXTCLOUD_MOUNT=\"/mnt/\"</code>. On Windows you could do this e.g. with <code>docker exec -it nextcloud-aio-nextcloud chown -R 33:0 /run/desktop/mnt/host/d/your-folder/</code> and <code>docker exec -it nextcloud-aio-nextcloud chmod -R 750 /run/desktop/mnt/host/d/your-folder/</code>.</p><p>You can then navigate to <code>https://your-nc-domain.com/settings/apps/disabled</code>, activate the external storage app, navigate to <code>https://your-nc-domain.com/settings/admin/externalstorages</code> and add a local external storage directory that will be accessible inside the container at the same place that you've entered. E.g. <code>/mnt/your-drive-mountpoint</code> will be mounted to <code>/mnt/your-drive-mountpoint</code> inside the container, etc.</p><p>Be aware though that these locations will not be covered by the built-in backup solution - but you can add further Docker volumes and host paths that you want to back up after the initial backup is done.</p><blockquote><p>[!NOTE] If you can't see the type \"local storage\" in the external storage admin options, a restart of the containers from the AIO interface may be required.</p></blockquote><h3>How to adjust the Talk port?</h3><p>By default will the talk container use port  and  for connections. This should be set to something higher than 1024! You can adjust the port by adding e.g.  to the docker run command of the mastercontainer (but before the last line <code>ghcr.io/nextcloud-releases/all-in-one:latest</code>! If it was started already, you will need to stop the mastercontainer, remove it (no data will be lost) and recreate it using the docker run command that you initially used) and adjusting the port to your desired value. Best is to use a port over 1024, so e.g. 3479 to not run into this: <a href=\"https://github.com/nextcloud/all-in-one/discussions/2517\">https://github.com/nextcloud/all-in-one/discussions/2517</a></p><h3>How to adjust the upload limit for Nextcloud?</h3><p>By default, public uploads to Nextcloud are limited to a max of 16G (logged in users can upload much bigger files using the webinterface or the mobile/desktop clients, since chunking is used in that case). You can adjust the upload limit by providing <code>--env NEXTCLOUD_UPLOAD_LIMIT=16G</code> to the docker run command of the mastercontainer (but before the last line <code>ghcr.io/nextcloud-releases/all-in-one:latest</code>! If it was started already, you will need to stop the mastercontainer, remove it (no data will be lost) and recreate it using the docker run command that you initially used) and customize the value to your fitting. It must start with a number and end with  e.g. .</p><h3>How to adjust the max execution time for Nextcloud?</h3><p>By default, uploads to Nextcloud are limited to a max of 3600s.

It must start with a number and end with  e.g. .</p><h3>How to change the Nextcloud apps that are installed on the first startup?</h3><p>You might want to adjust the Nextcloud apps that are installed upon the first startup of the Nextcloud container. You can do so by adding <code>--env NEXTCLOUD_STARTUP_APPS=\"deck twofactor_totp tasks calendar contacts notes\"</code> to the docker run command of the mastercontainer (but before the last line <code>ghcr.io/nextcloud-releases/all-in-one:latest</code>! If it was started already, you will need to stop the mastercontainer, remove it (no data will be lost) and recreate it using the docker run command that you initially used) and customize the value to your fitting. It must be a string with small letters a-z, 0-9, spaces and hyphens or '_'. You can disable shipped and by default enabled apps by adding a hyphen in front of the appid. E.g. .</p><h3>How to add OS packages permanently to the Nextcloud container?</h3><p>Some Nextcloud apps require additional external dependencies that must be bundled within Nextcloud container in order to work correctly. As we cannot put each and every dependency for all apps into the container - as this would make the project quickly unmaintainable - there is an official way in which you can add additional dependencies into the Nextcloud container. However note that doing this is disrecommended since we do not test Nextcloud apps that require external dependencies.</p><p>You can do so by adding <code>--env NEXTCLOUD_ADDITIONAL_APKS=\"imagemagick dependency2 dependency3\"</code> to the docker run command of the mastercontainer (but before the last line <code>ghcr.io/nextcloud-releases/all-in-one:latest</code>! If it was started already, you will need to stop the mastercontainer, remove it (no data will be lost) and recreate it using the docker run command that you initially used) and customize the value to your fitting.

You can find available packages here: <a href=\"https://pkgs.alpinelinux.org/packages?branch=v3.21\">https://pkgs.alpinelinux.org/packages?branch=v3.21</a>. By default  is added. If you want to keep it, you need to specify it as well.</p><h3>How to add PHP extensions permanently to the Nextcloud container?</h3><p>Some Nextcloud apps require additional php extensions that must be bundled within Nextcloud container in order to work correctly. As we cannot put each and every dependency for all apps into the container - as this would make the project quickly unmaintainable - there is an official way in which you can add additional php extensions into the Nextcloud container. However note that doing this is disrecommended since we do not test Nextcloud apps that require additional php extensions.</p><p>You can do so by adding <code>--env NEXTCLOUD_ADDITIONAL_PHP_EXTENSIONS=\"imagick extension1 extension2\"</code> to the docker run command of the mastercontainer (but before the last line <code>ghcr.io/nextcloud-releases/all-in-one:latest</code>!

If you want to keep it, you need to specify it as well.</p><h3>What about the pdlib PHP extension for the facerecognition app?</h3><p>The <a href=\"https://apps.nextcloud.com/apps/facerecognition\">facerecognition app</a> requires the pdlib PHP extension to be installed. Unfortunately, it is not available on PECL nor via PHP core, so there is no way to add this into AIO currently. However you can use <a href=\"https://github.com/nextcloud/all-in-one/tree/main/community-containers/facerecognition\">this community container</a> in order to run facerecognition.</p><h3>How to enable hardware acceleration for Nextcloud?</h3><p>Some container can use GPU acceleration to increase performance like <a href=\"https://apps.nextcloud.com/apps/memories\">memories app</a> allows to enable hardware transcoding for videos.</p><h4>With open source drivers MESA for AMD, Intel and  drivers  for Nvidia</h4><blockquote><p>[!WARNING] This only works if the  device is present on the host! If it does not exist on your host, don't proceed as otherwise the Nextcloud container will fail to start! If you are unsure about this, better do not proceed with the instructions below. Make sure that your driver is correctly configured on the host.</p></blockquote><p>In order to use that, you need to add <code>--env NEXTCLOUD_ENABLE_DRI_DEVICE=true</code> to the docker run command of the mastercontainer (but before the last line <code>ghcr.io/nextcloud-releases/all-in-one:latest</code>! If it was started already, you will need to stop the mastercontainer, remove it (no data will be lost) and recreate it using the docker run command that you initially used) which will mount the  device into the container.</p><h4>With proprietary drivers for Nvidia  BETA</h4><blockquote><p>[!WARNING] This only works if the Nvidia Toolkit is installed on the host and an NVIDIA GPU is enabled! Make sure that it is correctly configured on the host. If it does not exist on your host, don't proceed as otherwise the Nextcloud container will fail to start! If you are unsure about this, better do not proceed with the instructions below.</p><p>This feature is in beta. Since the proprietary, we haven't a lot of user using proprietary drivers, we can't guarantee the stability of this feature. Your feedback is welcome.</p></blockquote><p>In order to use that, you need to add <code>--env NEXTCLOUD_ENABLE_NVIDIA_GPU=true</code> to the docker run command of the mastercontainer (but before the last line <code>ghcr.io/nextcloud-releases/all-in-one:latest</code>! If it was started already, you will need to stop the mastercontainer, remove it (no data will be lost) and recreate it using the docker run command that you initially used) which will enable the nvidia runtime.</p><h3>How to keep disabled apps?</h3><p>In certain situations you might want to keep Nextcloud apps that are disabled in the AIO interface and not uninstall them if they should be installed in Nextcloud. You can do so by adding <code>--env NEXTCLOUD_KEEP_DISABLED_APPS=true</code> to the docker run command of the mastercontainer (but before the last line <code>ghcr.io/nextcloud-releases/all-in-one:latest</code>! If it was started already, you will need to stop the mastercontainer, remove it (no data will be lost) and recreate it using the docker run command that you initially used).</p><blockquote><p>[!WARNING] Doing this might cause unintended problems in Nextcloud if an app that requires an external dependency is still installed but the external dependency not for example.</p></blockquote><h3>How to trust user-defined Certification Authorities (CA)?</h3><blockquote><p>[!NOTE] Please note, that this feature is only intended to make LDAPS connections with self-signed certificates work. It will not make other interconnectivity between the different containers work, as they expect a valid publicly trusted certificate like one from Let's Encrypt.</p></blockquote><p>For some applications it might be necessary to establish a secure connection to another host/server which is using a certificate issued by a Certification Authority that is not trusted out of the box. An example could be configuring LDAPS against a domain controller (Active Directory or Samba-based) of an organization.</p><p>You can make the Nextcloud container trust any Certification Authority by providing the environmental variable <code>NEXTCLOUD_TRUSTED_CACERTS_DIR</code> to the docker run command of the mastercontainer (but before the last line <code>ghcr.io/nextcloud-releases/all-in-one:latest</code>! If it was started already, you will need to stop the mastercontainer, remove it (no data will be lost) and recreate it using the docker run command that you initially used). The value of the variables should be set to the absolute paths of the directory on the host, which contains one or more Certification Authorities certificates. You should use X.509 certificates, Base64 encoded. (Other formats may work but have not been tested!)

Pointing the variable directly to a certificate  will not work and may also break things.</p><h3>How to disable Collabora's Seccomp feature?</h3><p>The Collabora container enables Seccomp by default, which is a security feature of the Linux kernel. On systems without this kernel feature enabled, you need to provide <code>--env COLLABORA_SECCOMP_DISABLED=true</code> to the initial docker run command in order to make it work. If it was started already, you will need to stop the mastercontainer, remove it (no data will be lost) and recreate it using the docker run command that you initially used.</p><h3>How to adjust the Fulltextsearch Java options?</h3><p>The Fulltextsearch Java options are by default set to  which might not be enough on some systems. You can adjust this by adding e.g. <code>--env FULLTEXTSEARCH_JAVA_OPTIONS=\"-Xms1024M -Xmx1024M\"</code> to the initial docker run command. If it was started already, you will need to stop the mastercontainer, remove it (no data will be lost) and recreate it using the docker run command that you initially used.</p><p>On macOS, there is only one thing different in comparison to Linux: instead of using <code>--volume /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:ro</code>, you need to use <code>--volume /var/run/docker.sock.raw:/var/run/docker.sock:ro</code> to run it after you installed <a href=\"https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/\">Docker Desktop</a> (and don't forget to <a href=\"https://github.com/nextcloud/all-in-one/raw/main/docker-ipv6-support.md\">enable ipv6</a> if you should need that). Apart from that it should work and behave the same like on Linux.</p><p>Also, you may be interested in adjusting Nextcloud's Datadir to store the files on the host system.

Since  is not available on Windows, you simply remove  from the commands and they should work.</p></blockquote><h3>How to run AIO on Synology DSM</h3><p>On Synology, there are two things different in comparison to Linux: instead of using <code>--volume /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:ro</code>, you need to use <code>--volume /volume1/docker/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:ro</code> to run it. You also need to add <code>--env WATCHTOWER_DOCKER_SOCKET_PATH=\"/volume1/docker/docker.sock\"</code>to the docker run command of the mastercontainer (but before the last line <code>ghcr.io/nextcloud-releases/all-in-one:latest</code>). Apart from that it should work and behave the same like on Linux. Obviously the Synology Docker GUI will not work with that so you will need to either use SSH or create a user-defined script task in the task scheduler as the user 'root' in order to run the command.</p><blockquote><p>[!NOTE] It is possible that the docker socket on your Synology is located in  like the default on Linux. Then you can just use the Linux command without having to change anything - you will notice this when you try to start the container and it says that the bind mount failed. E.g. <code>docker: Error response from daemon: Bind mount failed: '/volume1/docker/docker.sock' does not exists.</code></p></blockquote><p>Also, you may be interested in adjusting Nextcloud's Datadir to store the files on the host system. See <a href=\"https://github.com/nextcloud/all-in-one#how-to-change-the-default-location-of-nextclouds-datadir\">this documentation</a> on how to do it.</p><p>You'll also need to adjust Synology's firewall, see below:</p><h3>How to run AIO with Portainer?</h3><p>The easiest way to run it with Portainer on Linux is to use Portainer's stacks feature and use <a href=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nextcloud/all-in-one/main/compose.yaml\">this docker-compose file</a> in order to start AIO correctly.</p><h3>Can I run AIO on TrueNAS SCALE?</h3><p>With the Truenas Scale Release 24.10.0 (which was officially released on October 29th 2024 as a stable release) IX Systems ditched the Kubernetes integration and implemented a fully working docker environment.</p><p>On older TrueNAS SCALE releases with Kubernetes environment, there are two ways to run AIO. The preferred one is to run AIO inside a VM. This is necessary since they do not expose the docker socket for containers on the host, you also cannot use docker-compose on it thus and it is also not possible to run custom helm-charts that are not explicitly written for TrueNAS SCALE.</p><p>Simply run the following: <code>sudo docker exec --user www-data -it nextcloud-aio-nextcloud php occ your-command</code>. Of course  needs to be exchanged with the command that you want to run.</p><h3>How to resolve <code>Security &amp; setup warnings displays the \"missing default phone region\" after initial install</code>?</h3><h3>How to run multiple AIO instances on one server?</h3><h3>Bruteforce protection FAQ</h3><p>Nextcloud features a built-in bruteforce protection which may get triggered and will block an ip-address or disable a user. You can unblock an ip-address by running <code>sudo docker exec --user www-data -it nextcloud-aio-nextcloud php occ security:bruteforce:reset &lt;ip-address&gt;</code> and enable a disabled user by running <code>sudo docker exec --user www-data -it nextcloud-aio-nextcloud php occ user:enable &lt;name of user&gt;</code>.

You simply need to change the last line <code>ghcr.io/nextcloud-releases/all-in-one:latest</code> to <code>ghcr.io/nextcloud-releases/all-in-one:beta</code> and vice versa.</p><h3>How to update the containers?</h3><p>If we push new containers to , you will see in the AIO interface below the  section that new container updates were found. In this case, just press  and <code>Start and update containers</code> in order to update the containers. The mastercontainer has its own update procedure though. See below. And don't forget to back up the current state of your instance using the built-in backup solution before starting the containers again! Otherwise you won't be able to restore your instance easily if something should break during the update.</p><p>If a new  update was found, you'll see a note below the  button that allows to show the changelog. If you click that button and the containers are stopped, you will see a new button that allows to update the mastercontainer. After doing so and after the update is gone through, you will have the option again to <code>Start and update containers</code>. It is recommended to create a backup before clicking the <code>Start and update containers</code> button.</p><p>Additionally, there is a cronjob that runs once a day that checks for container and mastercontainer updates and sends a notification to all Nextcloud admins if a new update was found.</p><h3>How to easily log in to the AIO interface?</h3><p>If your Nextcloud is running and you are logged in as admin in your Nextcloud, you can easily log in to the AIO interface by opening <code>https://yourdomain.tld/settings/admin/overview</code> which will show a button on top that enables you to log in to the AIO interface by just clicking on this button.</p><blockquote><p>[!Note] You can change the domain/ip-address/port of the button by simply stopping the containers, visiting the AIO interface from the correct and desired domain/ip-address/port and clicking once on .</p></blockquote><h3>How to change the domain?</h3><blockquote><p>[!NOTE] Editing the configuration.json manually and making a mistake may break your instance so please create a backup first!</p></blockquote><p>If you set up a new AIO instance, you need to enter a domain. Currently there is no way to change this domain afterwards from the AIO interface. So in order to change it, you need to edit the configuration.json manually using <code>sudo docker run -it --rm --volume nextcloud_aio_mastercontainer:/mnt/docker-aio-config:rw alpine sh -c \"apk add --no-cache nano &amp;&amp; nano /mnt/docker-aio-config/data/configuration.json\"</code>, substitute each occurrence of your old domain with your new domain and save and write out the file. Afterwards restart your containers from the AIO interface and everything should work as expected if the new domain is correctly configured. If you are running AIO behind a web server or reverse proxy (like Apache, Nginx, Caddy, Cloudflare Tunnel and else), you need to obviously also change the domain in your reverse proxy config.</p><p>Additionally, after restarting the containers, you need to open the admin settings and update some values manually that cannot be changed automatically. Here is a list of some known places:</p><ul><li><code>https://your-nc-domain.com/settings/admin/talk</code> for Turn/Stun server and Signaling Server if you enabled Talk via the AIO interface</li><li><code>https://your-nc-domain.com/settings/admin/theming</code> for the theming URL</li><li><code>https://your-nc-domain.com/settings/admin/app_api</code> for the deploy daemon if you enabled the App API via the AIO interface</li></ul><h3>How to properly reset the instance?</h3><p>If something goes unexpected routes during the initial installation, you might want to reset the AIO installation to be able to start from scratch.</p><blockquote><p>[!NOTE] If you already have it running and have data on your instance, you should not follow these instructions as it will delete all data that is coupled to your AIO instance.</p></blockquote><p>Here is how to reset the AIO instance properly:</p><ol><li>Stop all containers if they are running from the AIO interface</li><li>Stop the mastercontainer with <code>sudo docker stop nextcloud-aio-mastercontainer</code></li><li>If the domaincheck container is still running, stop it with <code>sudo docker stop nextcloud-aio-domaincheck</code></li><li>Check that no AIO containers are running anymore by running <code>sudo docker ps --format {{.Names}}</code>. If no  containers are listed, you can proceed with the steps below. If there should be some, you will need to stop them with <code>sudo docker stop &lt;container_name&gt;</code> until no one is listed anymore.</li><li>Check which containers are stopped: <code>sudo docker ps --filter \"status=exited\"</code></li><li>Now remove all these stopped containers with <code>sudo docker container prune</code></li><li>Delete the docker network with <code>sudo docker network rm nextcloud-aio</code></li><li>Check which volumes are dangling with <code>sudo docker volume ls --filter \"dangling=true\"</code></li><li>Now remove all these dangling volumes: <code>sudo docker volume prune --filter all=1</code> (on Windows you might need to remove some volumes afterwards manually with <code>docker volume rm nextcloud_aio_backupdir</code>, <code>docker volume rm nextcloud_aio_nextcloud_datadir</code>).</li><li>If you've configured  to a path on your host instead of the default volume, you need to clean that up as well. (E.g. by simply deleting the directory).</li><li>Make sure that no volumes are remaining with <code>sudo docker volume ls --format {{.Name}}</code>. If no  volumes are listed, you can proceed with the steps below. If there should be some, you will need to remove them with <code>sudo docker volume rm &lt;volume_name&gt;</code> until no one is listed anymore.</li><li>Optional: You can remove all docker images with <code>sudo docker image prune -a</code>.</li><li>And you are done! Now feel free to start over with the recommended docker run command!</li></ol><h3>Can I use a CIFS/SMB share as Nextcloud's datadir?</h3><p>Sure. Add this to the  file on the host system: <code>&lt;your-storage-host-and-subpath&gt; &lt;your-mount-dir&gt; cifs rw,mfsymlinks,seal,credentials=&lt;your-credentials-file&gt;,uid=33,gid=0,file_mode=0770,dir_mode=0770 0 0</code> (Of course you need to modify <code>&lt;your-storage-host-and-subpath&gt;</code>,  and  for your specific case.)</p><p>One example could look like this:<code>//your-storage-host/subpath /mnt/storagebox cifs rw,mfsymlinks,seal,credentials=/etc/storage-credentials,uid=33,gid=0,file_mode=0770,dir_mode=0770 0 0</code> and add into :</p><pre><code>username=&lt;smb/cifs username&gt;\npassword=&lt;password&gt;\n</code></pre><p>(Of course you need to modify  and  for your specific case.)</p><p>Now you can use  as Nextcloud's datadir like described in the section above this one.</p><h3>Can I run this with Docker swarm?</h3><h3>Can I run this with Kubernetes?</h3><h3>How to run this with Docker rootless?</h3><p>You can run AIO also with docker rootless. How to do this is documented here: <a href=\"https://github.com/nextcloud/all-in-one/raw/main/docker-rootless.md\">docker-rootless.md</a></p><h3>Can I run this with Podman instead of Docker?</h3><h3>Access/Edit Nextcloud files/folders manually</h3><p>The files and folders that you add to Nextcloud are by default stored in the following docker directory: <code>nextcloud_aio_nextcloud:/mnt/ncdata/</code> (usually <code>/var/lib/docker/volumes/nextcloud_aio_nextcloud_data/_data/</code> on linux host systems). If needed, you can modify/add/delete files/folders there but : be very careful when doing so because you might corrupt your AIO installation! Best is to create a backup using the built-in backup solution before editing/changing files/folders in there because you will then be able to restore your instance to the backed up state.</p><p>After you are done modifying/adding/deleting files/folders, don't forget to apply the correct permissions by running: <code>sudo docker exec nextcloud-aio-nextcloud chown -R 33:0 /mnt/ncdata/</code> and <code>sudo docker exec nextcloud-aio-nextcloud chmod -R 750 /mnt/ncdata/</code> and rescan the files with <code>sudo docker exec --user www-data -it nextcloud-aio-nextcloud php occ files:scan --all</code>.</p><h3>How to edit Nextclouds config.php file with a texteditor?</h3><p>You can edit Nextclouds config.php file directly from the host with your favorite text editor. E.g. like this: <code>sudo docker run -it --rm --volume nextcloud_aio_nextcloud:/var/www/html:rw alpine sh -c \"apk add --no-cache nano &amp;&amp; nano /var/www/html/config/config.php\"</code>. Make sure to not break the file though which might corrupt your Nextcloud instance otherwise. In best case, create a backup using the built-in backup solution before editing the file.</p><h3>How to change default files by creating a custom skeleton directory?</h3><p>All users see a set of <a href=\"https://docs.nextcloud.com/server/latest/admin_manual/configuration_files/default_files_configuration.html\">default files and folders</a> as dictated by Nextcloud's configuration. To change these default files and folders a custom skeleton directory must first be created; this can be accomplished by copying your skeleton files <code>sudo docker cp --follow-link /path/to/nextcloud/skeleton/ nextcloud-aio-nextcloud:/mnt/ncdata/skeleton/</code>, applying the correct permissions with <code>sudo docker exec nextcloud-aio-nextcloud chown -R 33:0 /mnt/ncdata/skeleton/</code> and <code>sudo docker exec nextcloud-aio-nextcloud chmod -R 750 /mnt/ncdata/skeleton/</code> and setting the skeleton directory option with <code>sudo docker exec --user www-data -it nextcloud-aio-nextcloud php occ config:system:set skeletondirectory --value=\"/mnt/ncdata/skeleton\"</code>. Further information is available in the Nextcloud documentation on <a href=\"https://docs.nextcloud.com/server/stable/admin_manual/configuration_server/config_sample_php_parameters.html#skeletondirectory\">configuration parameters for the skeleton directory</a>.</p><h3>How to adjust the version retention policy and trashbin retention policy?</h3><h3>How to enable automatic updates without creating a backup beforehand?</h3><p>If you have an external backup solution, you might want to enable automatic updates without creating a backup first. However note that doing this is disrecommended since you will not be able to easily create and restore a backup from the AIO interface anymore and you need to make sure to shut down all the containers properly before creating the backup, e.g. by stopping them from the AIO interface first.</p><p>But anyhow, is here a guide that helps you automate the whole procedure:</p><p>You can simply copy and paste the script into a file e.g. named  e.g. here: .</p><p>Afterwards apply the correct permissions with <code>sudo chown root:root /root/shutdown-script.sh</code> and <code>sudo chmod 700 /root/shutdown-script.sh</code>. Then you can create a cronjob that runs it on a schedule e.g. runs the script at  each day like this:</p><ol><li>Open the cronjob with  (and choose your editor of choice if not already done. I'd recommend nano).</li><li>Add the following new line to the crontab if not already present: <code>0 4 * * * /root/shutdown-script.sh</code> which will run the script at 04:00 each day.</li><li>save and close the crontab (when using nano the shortcuts for this are  and then  to save, and close the editor with ).</li></ol><p><strong>After that is in place, you should schedule a backup from your backup solution that creates a backup after AIO is shut down properly. Hint: If your backup runs on the same host, make sure to at least back up all docker volumes and additionally Nextcloud's datadir if it is not stored in a docker volume.</strong></p><p><strong>Afterwards, you can create a second script that automatically updates the containers:</strong></p><p>You can simply copy and paste the script into a file e.g. named  e.g. here: <code>/root/automatic-updates.sh</code>.</p><p>Afterwards apply the correct permissions with <code>sudo chown root:root /root/automatic-updates.sh</code> and <code>sudo chmod 700 /root/automatic-updates.sh</code>. Then you can create a cronjob that runs e.g. at  each day like this:</p><ol><li>Open the cronjob with  (and choose your editor of choice if not already done. I'd recommend nano).</li><li>Add the following new line to the crontab if not already present: <code>0 5 * * * /root/automatic-updates.sh</code> which will run the script at 05:00 each day.</li><li>save and close the crontab (when using nano the shortcuts for this are  then  to save, and close the editor with ).</li></ol><h3>Securing the AIO interface from unauthorized ACME challenges</h3><p><a href=\"https://github.com/nextcloud/all-in-one/discussions/4882#discussioncomment-9858384\">By design</a>, Caddy that runs inside the mastercontainer, which handles automatic TLS certificate generation for the AIO interface on port 8443, is configured to accept traffic on any valid domain in order to make the AIO interface as convenient to use as possible. However due to this, it is vulnerable to receiving DNS challenges for arbitrary hostnames from anyone on the internet. While this does not compromise your server's security, it can result in cluttered logs and rejected certificate renewal attempts due to rate limit abuse. To mitigate this issue, it is recommended to place the AIO interface behind a VPN and/or limit its public exposure.</p><h3>How to migrate from an already existing Nextcloud installation to Nextcloud AIO?</h3><p>Nextcloud AIO provides a backup solution based on <a href=\"https://github.com/borgbackup/borg#what-is-borgbackup\">BorgBackup</a>. These backups act as a restore point in case the installation gets corrupted. By using this tool, backups are incremental, differential, compressed and encrypted ‚Äì so only the first backup will take a while. Further backups should be fast as only changes are taken into account.</p><p>It is recommended to create a backup before any container update. By doing this, you will be safe regarding any possible complication during updates because you will be able to restore the whole instance with basically one click.</p><p>For local backups, the restore process should be pretty fast as rsync is used to restore the chosen backup which only transfers changed files and deletes additional ones. For remote borg backups, the whole backup archive is extracted from the remote, which depending on how clever  is, may require downloading the whole archive.</p><p>If you connect an external drive to your host, and choose the backup directory to be on that drive, you are also kind of safe against drive failures of the drive where the docker volumes are stored on.</p><p>If you want to back up directly to a remote borg repository:</p><p>Backups can be created and restored in the AIO interface using the buttons  and . Additionally, a backup check is provided that checks the integrity of your backups but it shouldn't be needed in most situations.</p><p>The backups themselves get encrypted with an encryption key that gets shown to you in the AIO interface. Please save that at a safe place as you will not be able to restore from backup without this key.</p><p>Daily backups can get enabled after the initial backup is done. Enabling this also allows to enable an option that allows to automatically update all containers, Nextcloud and its apps.</p><p>Be aware that this solution does not back up files and folders that are mounted into Nextcloud using the external storage app - but you can add further Docker volumes and host paths that you want to back up after the initial backup is done.</p><h3>What is getting backed up by AIO's backup solution?</h3><p>Backed up will get all important data of your Nextcloud AIO instance required to restore the instance, like the database, your files and configuration files of the mastercontainer and else. Files and folders that are mounted into Nextcloud using the external storage app are not getting backed up. There is currently no way to exclude the data directory because it would require hacks like running files:scan and would make the backup solution much more unreliable (since the database and your files/folders need to stay in sync). If you still don't want your datadirectory to be backed up, see <a href=\"https://github.com/nextcloud/all-in-one#how-to-enable-automatic-updates-without-creating-a-backup-beforehand\">https://github.com/nextcloud/all-in-one#how-to-enable-automatic-updates-without-creating-a-backup-beforehand</a> for options (there is a hint what needs to be backed up in which order).</p><h3>How to adjust borgs retention policy?</h3><p>The built-in borg-based backup solution has by default a retention policy of <code>--keep-within=7d --keep-weekly=4 --keep-monthly=6</code>. See <a href=\"https://borgbackup.readthedocs.io/en/stable/usage/prune.html\">https://borgbackup.readthedocs.io/en/stable/usage/prune.html</a> for what these values mean. You can adjust the retention policy by providing <code>--env BORG_RETENTION_POLICY=\"--keep-within=7d --keep-weekly=4 --keep-monthly=6\"</code> to the docker run command of the mastercontainer (but before the last line <code>ghcr.io/nextcloud-releases/all-in-one:latest</code>! If it was started already, you will need to stop the mastercontainer, remove it (no data will be lost) and recreate it using the docker run command that you initially used) and customize the value to your fitting. ‚ö†Ô∏è Please make sure that this value is valid, otherwise backup pruning will bug out!</p><h3>How to migrate from AIO to AIO?</h3><p>If you have the borg backup feature enabled, you can copy it over to the new host and restore from the backup. This guide assumes the new installation data dir will be on , you can adjust the steps if it's elsewhere.</p><ol><li>Set the DNS entry to 60 seconds TTL if applicable</li><li>On your current installation, use the AIO interface to: \n  <ol><li>Update AIO and all containers</li><li>Stop all containers (from now on, your cloud is down)</li><li>Create a current borg backup</li><li>Note the path where the backups are stored and the encryption password</li></ol></li><li>Navigate to the backup folder</li><li>Create archive of the backup so it's easier to copy: <code>tar -czvf borg.tar.gz borg</code></li><li>Copy the archive over to the new host: <code>scp borg.tar.gz user@new.host:/mnt</code>. Make sure to replace  with your actual user and  with the IP or domain of the actual host. You can also use another way to copy the archive.</li><li>Go to the folder you put the backup archive and extract it with </li><li>Follow the installation guide to create a new aio instance, but do not start the containers yet (the  or  command)</li><li>Change the DNS entry to the new host's IP</li><li>Configure your reverse proxy if you use one</li><li>Start the AIO container and open the new AIO interface in your browser</li><li>Make sure to save the newly generated passphrase and enter it in the next step</li><li>Select the \"Restore former AIO instance from backup\" option and enter the encryption password from the old backup and the path in which the extracted  folder lies in (without the borg part) and hit <code>Submit location and password</code></li><li>Choose the latest backup in the dropdown and hit </li><li>Wait until the backup is restored</li><li>Start the containers in the AIO interface</li></ol><h3>Are remote borg backups supported?</h3><p>Backing up directly to a remote borg repository is supported. This avoids having to store a local copy of your backups, supports append-only borg keys to counter ransomware and allows using the AIO interface to manage your backups.</p><p>Some alternatives, which do not have all the above benefits:</p><h3>Failure of the backup container in LXC containers</h3><p>If you are running AIO in a LXC container, you need to make sure that FUSE is enabled in the LXC container settings. Also, if using Alpine Linux as host OS, make sure to add fuse via . Otherwise the backup container will not be able to start as FUSE is required for it to work.</p><h3>How to create the backup volume on Windows?</h3><p>As stated in the AIO interface, it is possible to use a docker volume as backup target. Before you can use that, you need to create it first. Here is an example how to create one on Windows:</p><pre><code>docker volume create ^\n--driver local ^\n--name nextcloud_aio_backupdir ^\n-o device=\"/host_mnt/e/your/backup/path\" ^\n-o type=\"none\" ^\n-o o=\"bind\"\n</code></pre><p>In this example, it would mount  into the volume so for a different location you need to adjust <code>/host_mnt/e/your/backup/path</code> accordingly. Afterwards enter  in the AIO interface as backup location.</p><h3>Pro-tip: Backup archives access</h3><p>You can open the BorgBackup archives on your host by following these steps: (instructions for Ubuntu Desktop)</p><pre><code># Install borgbackup on the host\nsudo apt update &amp;&amp; sudo apt install borgbackup\n\n# In any shell where you use borg, you must first export this variable\n# If you are using the default backup location /mnt/backup/borg\nexport BORG_REPO='/mnt/backup/borg'\n# or if you are using a remote repository\nexport BORG_REPO='user@host:/path/to/repo'\n\n# Mount the archives to /tmp/borg\nsudo mkdir -p /tmp/borg &amp;&amp; sudo borg mount \"$BORG_REPO\" /tmp/borg\n\n# After entering your repository key successfully, you should be able to access all archives in /tmp/borg\n# You can now do whatever you want by syncing them to a different place using rsync or doing other things\n# E.g. you can open the file manager on that location by running:\nxhost +si:localuser:root &amp;&amp; sudo nautilus /tmp/borg\n\n# When you are done, simply close the file manager and run the following command to unmount the backup archives:\nsudo umount /tmp/borg\n</code></pre><h3>Delete backup archives manually</h3><p>You can delete BorgBackup archives on your host manually by following these steps: (instructions for Debian based OS' like Ubuntu)</p><pre><code># Install borgbackup on the host\nsudo apt update &amp;&amp; sudo apt install borgbackup\n\n# In any shell where you use borg, you must first export this variable\n# If you are using the default backup location /mnt/backup/borg\nexport BORG_REPO='/mnt/backup/borg'\n# or if you are using a remote repository\nexport BORG_REPO='user@host:/path/to/repo'\n\n# List all archives (if you are using the default backup location /mnt/backup/borg)\nsudo borg list\n\n# After entering your repository key successfully, you should now see a list of all backup archives\n# An example backup archive might be called 20220223_174237-nextcloud-aio\n# Then you can simply delete the archive with:\nsudo borg delete --stats --progress \"::20220223_174237-nextcloud-aio\"\n\n# If borg 1.2.0 or higher is installed, you then need to run borg compact in order to clean up the freed space\nsudo borg --version\n# If version number of the command above is higher than 1.2.0 you need to run the command below:\nsudo borg compact\n\n</code></pre><p>After doing so, make sure to update the backup archives list in the AIO interface! You can do so by clicking on the  button or  button.</p><h3>Sync local backups regularly to another drive</h3><p>For increased backup security, you might consider syncing the local backup repository regularly to another drive.</p><p>To do that, first add the drive to  so that it is able to get automatically mounted and then create a script that does all the things automatically. Here is an example for such a script:</p><p>You can simply copy and paste the script into a file e.g. named  e.g. here: . Do not forget to modify the variables to your requirements!</p><p>Afterwards apply the correct permissions with <code>sudo chown root:root /root/backup-script.sh</code> and <code>sudo chmod 700 /root/backup-script.sh</code>.

See <a href=\"https://docs.nextcloud.com/server/latest/admin_manual/configuration_files/external_storage_configuration_gui.html\">this documentation</a> on how to configure the app.</p></blockquote><p>If you still want to proceed, you can exclude the data directory by simply creating a  file in the root directory of the specified  target. The same logic is implemented for the preview folder that is located inside the data directory, inside the  folder. So simply create a  file in there if you want to exclude the preview folder.</p><p>After doing a restore via the AIO interface, you might run into problems due to the data directory and database being out of sync. You might be able to fix this by running  and  and . See <a href=\"https://github.com/nextcloud/all-in-one#how-to-run-occ-commands\">https://github.com/nextcloud/all-in-one#how-to-run-occ-commands</a>. If only the preview folder is excluded, the command <code>occ files:scan-app-data preview</code> should be used.</p><h3>How to stop/start/update containers or trigger the daily backup from a script externally?</h3><blockquote><p>[!WARNING] The below script will only work after the initial setup of AIO. So you will always need to first visit the AIO interface, type in your domain and start the containers the first time or restore an older AIO instance from its borg backup before you can use the script.</p></blockquote><p>You can do so by running the  script that is stored in the mastercontainer. It accepts the following environment variables:</p><ul><li> if set to , it will automatically stop the containers, update them and start them including the mastercontainer. If the mastercontainer gets updated, this script's execution will stop as soon as the mastercontainer gets stopped. You can then wait until it is started again and run the script with this flag again in order to update all containers correctly afterwards.</li><li> if set to , it will automatically stop the containers and create a backup. If you want to start them again afterwards, you may have a look at the  option.</li><li> if set to , it will automatically start the containers without updating them.</li><li> if set to , it will automatically stop the containers.</li><li> if set to , it will start the backup check. This is not allowed to be enabled at the same time like . Please be aware that this option is non-blocking which means that the backup check is not done when the process is finished since it only start the borgbackup container with the correct configuration.</li></ul><p>One example for this would be <code>sudo docker exec -it --env DAILY_BACKUP=1 nextcloud-aio-mastercontainer /daily-backup.sh</code>, which you can run via a cronjob or put it in a script.</p><blockquote><p>[!NOTE] None of the option returns error codes. So you need to check for the correct result yourself.</p></blockquote><h3>How to disable the backup section?</h3><p>If you already have a backup solution in place, you may want to hide the backup section. You can do so by adding <code>--env AIO_DISABLE_BACKUP_SECTION=true</code> to the docker run command of the mastercontainer (but before the last line <code>ghcr.io/nextcloud-releases/all-in-one:latest</code>! If it was started already, you will need to stop the mastercontainer, remove it (no data will be lost) and recreate it using the docker run command that you initially used).</p><p>It is possible to connect to an existing LDAP server. You need to make sure that the LDAP server is reachable from the Nextcloud container. Then you can enable the LDAP app and configure LDAP in Nextcloud manually. If you don't have a LDAP server yet, recommended is to use this docker container: <a href=\"https://hub.docker.com/r/nitnelave/lldap\">https://hub.docker.com/r/nitnelave/lldap</a>. Make sure here as well that Nextcloud can talk to the LDAP server. The easiest way is by adding the LDAP docker container to the docker network . Then you can connect to the LDAP container by its name from the Nextcloud container. There is now a community container which allows to easily add LLDAP to AIO: <a href=\"https://github.com/nextcloud/all-in-one/tree/main/community-containers/lldap\">https://github.com/nextcloud/all-in-one/tree/main/community-containers/lldap</a></p><p>If you want to use the user_sql app, the easiest way is to create an additional database container and add it to the docker network . Then the Nextcloud container should be able to talk to the database container using its name.</p><h3>phpMyAdmin, Adminer or pgAdmin</h3><h3>Requirements for integrating new containers</h3><p>What are the requirements?</p><ol><li>New containers must be related to Nextcloud. Related means that there must be a feature in Nextcloud that gets added by adding this container.</li><li>It must be optionally installable. Disabling and enabling the container from the AIO interface must work and must not produce any unexpected side-effects.</li><li>The feature that gets added into Nextcloud by adding the container must be maintained by the Nextcloud GmbH.</li><li>It must be possible to run the container without big quirks inside docker containers. Big quirks means e.g. needing to change the capabilities or security options.</li><li>The container should not mount directories from the host into the container: only docker volumes should be used.</li><li>The container must be usable by more than 90% of the users (e.g. not too high system requirements and such)</li><li>No additional setup should be needed after adding the container - it should work completely out of the box.</li><li>If the container requires being exposed, only subfolders are supported. So the container should not require its own (sub-)domain and must be able to run in a subfolder.</li></ol><p>This project values stability over new features. That means that when a new major Nextcloud update gets introduced, we will wait at least until the first patch release, e.g.  is out before upgrading to it. Also we will wait with the upgrade until all important apps are compatible with the new major version. Minor or patch releases for Nextcloud and all dependencies as well as all containers will be updated to new versions as soon as possible but we try to give all updates first a good test round before pushing them. That means that it can take around 2 weeks before new updates reach the  channel. If you want to help testing, you can switch to the  channel by following <a href=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nextcloud/all-in-one/main/#how-to-switch-the-channel\">this documentation</a> which will also give you the updates earlier.</p><h3>How often are update notifications sent?</h3><p>AIO ships its own update notifications implementation. It checks if container updates are available. If so, it sends a notification with the title <code>Container updates available!</code> on saturdays to Nextcloud users that are part of the  group. If the Nextcloud container image should be older than 90 days (~3 months) and thus badly outdated, AIO sends a notification to all Nextcloud users with the title . Thus admins should make sure to update the container images at least once every 3 months in order to make sure that the instance gets all security bugfixes as soon as possible.</p><p>If you should run into issues with huge docker logs, you can adjust the log size by following <a href=\"https://docs.docker.com/config/containers/logging/local/#usage\">https://docs.docker.com/config/containers/logging/local/#usage</a>. However for the included AIO containers, this should usually not be needed because almost all of them have the log level set to warn so they should not produce many logs.</p>","contentLength":65765,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"visgl/deck.gl","url":"https://github.com/visgl/deck.gl","date":1751337922,"author":"","guid":177072,"unread":true,"content":"<p>WebGL2 powered visualization framework</p><h5 align=\"center\"> GPU-powered, highly performant large-scale data visualization</h5><p>deck.gl is designed to simplify high-performance, WebGL2/WebGPU based visualization of large data sets.

The llm chooses the structure of the data.</p><pre><code>curl -X POST https://api.firecrawl.dev/v1/scrape \\\n    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\\n    -H 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY' \\\n    -d '{\n      \"url\": \"https://docs.firecrawl.dev/\",\n      \"formats\": [\"json\"],\n      \"jsonOptions\": {\n        \"prompt\": \"Extract the company mission from the page.\"\n      }\n    }'\n</code></pre><h3>Interacting with the page with Actions (Cloud-only)</h3><p>Firecrawl allows you to perform various actions on a web page before scraping its content. This is particularly useful for interacting with dynamic content, navigating through pages, or accessing content that requires user interaction.</p><p>Here is an example of how to use actions to navigate to google.com, search for Firecrawl, click on the first result, and take a screenshot.</p><pre><code>curl -X POST https://api.firecrawl.dev/v1/scrape \\\n    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\\n    -H 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY' \\\n    -d '{\n        \"url\": \"google.com\",\n        \"formats\": [\"markdown\"],\n        \"actions\": [\n            {\"type\": \"wait\", \"milliseconds\": 2000},\n            {\"type\": \"click\", \"selector\": \"textarea[title=\\\"Search\\\"]\"},\n            {\"type\": \"wait\", \"milliseconds\": 2000},\n            {\"type\": \"write\", \"text\": \"firecrawl\"},\n            {\"type\": \"wait\", \"milliseconds\": 2000},\n            {\"type\": \"press\", \"key\": \"ENTER\"},\n            {\"type\": \"wait\", \"milliseconds\": 3000},\n            {\"type\": \"click\", \"selector\": \"h3\"},\n            {\"type\": \"wait\", \"milliseconds\": 3000},\n            {\"type\": \"screenshot\"}\n        ]\n    }'\n</code></pre><h3>Batch Scraping Multiple URLs (New)</h3><p>You can now batch scrape multiple URLs at the same time. It is very similar to how the /crawl endpoint works. It submits a batch scrape job and returns a job ID to check the status of the batch scrape.</p><pre><code>curl -X POST https://api.firecrawl.dev/v1/batch/scrape \\\n    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\\n    -H 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY' \\\n    -d '{\n      \"urls\": [\"https://docs.firecrawl.dev\", \"https://docs.firecrawl.dev/sdks/overview\"],\n      \"formats\" : [\"markdown\", \"html\"]\n    }'\n</code></pre><pre><code>from firecrawl.firecrawl import FirecrawlApp\nfrom firecrawl.firecrawl import ScrapeOptions\n\napp = FirecrawlApp(api_key=\"fc-YOUR_API_KEY\")\n\n# Scrape a website:\nscrape_status = app.scrape_url(\n  'https://firecrawl.dev', \n  formats=[\"markdown\", \"html\"]\n)\nprint(scrape_status)\n\n# Crawl a website:\ncrawl_status = app.crawl_url(\n  'https://firecrawl.dev',\n  limit=100,\n  scrape_options=ScrapeOptions(\n    formats=[\"markdown\", \"html\"],),\n  poll_interval=30\n)\nprint(crawl_status)\n</code></pre><h3>Extracting structured data from a URL</h3><p>With LLM extraction, you can easily extract structured data from any URL. We support pydantic schemas to make it easier for you too. Here is how you to use it:</p><pre><code>class ArticleSchema(BaseModel):\n    title: str\n    points: int \n    by: str\n    commentsURL: str\n\nclass TopArticlesSchema(BaseModel):\n    top: List[ArticleSchema] = Field(..., description=\"Top 5 stories\")\n\njson_config = JsonConfig(schema=TopArticlesSchema.model_json_schema())\n\nllm_extraction_result = app.scrape_url('https://news.ycombinator.com', formats=[\"json\"], json=json_config)\n\nprint(llm_extraction_result.json)\n</code></pre><p>To install the Firecrawl Node SDK, you can use npm:</p><pre><code>npm install @mendable/firecrawl-js\n</code></pre><ol><li>Set the API key as an environment variable named  or pass it as a parameter to the  class.</li></ol><pre><code>import FirecrawlApp, { CrawlParams, CrawlStatusResponse } from '@mendable/firecrawl-js';\n\nconst app = new FirecrawlApp({apiKey: \"fc-YOUR_API_KEY\"});\n\n// Scrape a website\nconst scrapeResponse = await app.scrapeUrl('https://firecrawl.dev', {\n  formats: ['markdown', 'html'],\n});\n\nif (scrapeResponse) {\n  console.log(scrapeResponse)\n}\n\n// Crawl a website\nconst crawlResponse = await app.crawlUrl('https://firecrawl.dev', {\n  limit: 100,\n  scrapeOptions: {\n    formats: ['markdown', 'html'],\n  }\n} satisfies CrawlParams, true, 30) satisfies CrawlStatusResponse;\n\nif (crawlResponse) {\n  console.log(crawlResponse)\n}\n</code></pre><h3>Extracting structured data from a URL</h3><p>With LLM extraction, you can easily extract structured data from any URL. We support zod schema to make it easier for you too. Here is how to use it:</p><pre><code>import FirecrawlApp from \"@mendable/firecrawl-js\";\nimport { z } from \"zod\";\n\nconst app = new FirecrawlApp({\n  apiKey: \"fc-YOUR_API_KEY\"\n});\n\n// Define schema to extract contents into\nconst schema = z.object({\n  top: z\n    .array(\n      z.object({\n        title: z.string(),\n        points: z.number(),\n        by: z.string(),\n        commentsURL: z.string(),\n      })\n    )\n    .length(5)\n    .describe(\"Top 5 stories on Hacker News\"),\n});\n\nconst scrapeResult = await app.scrapeUrl(\"https://news.ycombinator.com\", {\n  jsonOptions: { extractionSchema: schema },\n});\n\nconsole.log(scrapeResult.data[\"json\"]);\n</code></pre><h2>Open Source vs Cloud Offering</h2><p>Firecrawl is open source available under the AGPL-3.0 license.</p><p>To deliver the best possible product, we offer a hosted version of Firecrawl alongside our open-source offering. The cloud solution allows us to continuously innovate and maintain a high-quality, sustainable service for all users.</p><p>Firecrawl Cloud is available at <a href=\"https://firecrawl.dev\">firecrawl.dev</a> and offers a range of features that are not available in the open source version:</p><p><em>It is the sole responsibility of the end users to respect websites' policies when scraping, searching and crawling with Firecrawl.

Neko is a powerful tool that allows you to <strong>run a fully-functional browser in a virtual environment</strong>, giving you the ability to <strong>access the internet securely and privately from anywhere</strong>. With Neko, you can browse the web, , and perform other tasks just as you would on a regular browser, all within a <strong>secure and isolated environment</strong>. Whether you are a developer looking to test web applications, a <strong>privacy-conscious user seeking a secure browsing experience</strong>, or simply someone who wants to take advantage of the <strong>convenience and flexibility of a virtual browser</strong>, Neko is the perfect solution.</p><p>In addition to its security and privacy features, Neko offers the <strong>ability for multiple users to access it simultaneously</strong>. This makes it an ideal solution for teams or organizations that need to share access to a browser, as well as for individuals who want to use <strong>multiple devices to access the same virtual environment</strong>. With Neko, you can <strong>easily and securely share access to a browser with others</strong>, without having to worry about maintaining separate configurations or settings. Whether you need to , access shared resources, or simply want to <strong>share access to a browser with friends or family</strong>, Neko makes it easy to do so.</p><p>Neko is also a great tool for  and interactive presentations. With its virtual browser capabilities, Neko allows you to host watch parties and presentations that are , without the need for in-person gatherings. This makes it easy to <strong>stay connected with friends and colleagues</strong>, even when you are unable to meet in person. With Neko, you can easily host a watch party or give an , whether it's for leisure or work. Simply invite your guests to join the virtual environment, and you can share the screen and <strong>interact with them in real-time</strong>.</p><p>This app uses WebRTC to stream a desktop inside of a docker container, original author made this because <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rabb.it\">rabb.it</a> went under and his internet could not handle streaming and discord kept crashing when his friend attempted to. He just wanted to watch anime with his friends ·Éö(‡≤†Áõä‡≤†·Éö) so he started digging throughout the internet and found a few  clones, but none of them had the virtual browser, then he found <a href=\"https://github.com/Khauri/Turtus\">Turtus</a> and he was able to figure out the rest.</p><p>Then I found <a href=\"https://github.com/nurdism/neko\">this</a> project and started to dig into it. I really liked the idea of having collaborative browser browsing together with multiple people, so I created a fork.

Co-STORM further enhanced its feature by enabling human to collaborative LLM system to support more aligned and preferred information seeking and knowledge curation. \n<p>While the system cannot produce publication-ready articles that often require a significant number of edits, experienced Wikipedia editors have found it helpful in their pre-writing stage.</p><p><strong>More than 70,000 people have tried our <a href=\"https://storm.genie.stanford.edu/\">live research preview</a>.

Directly prompting the language model to ask questions does not work well. To improve the depth and breadth of the questions, STORM adopts two strategies:</p><ol><li><strong>Perspective-Guided Question Asking</strong>: Given the input topic, STORM discovers different perspectives by surveying existing articles from similar topics and uses them to control the question-asking process.</li><li>: STORM simulates a conversation between a Wikipedia writer and a topic expert grounded in Internet sources to enable the language model to update its understanding of the topic and ask follow-up questions.</li></ol><p>Co-STORM proposes <strong>a collaborative discourse protocol</strong> which implements a turn management policy to support smooth collaboration among</p><ul><li>: This type of agent generates answers grounded on external knowledge sources and/or raises follow-up questions based on the discourse history.</li><li>: This agent generates thought-provoking questions inspired by information discovered by the retriever but not directly used in previous turns. Question generation can also be grounded!</li><li>: The human user will take the initiative to either (1) observe the discourse to gain deeper understanding of the topic, or (2) actively engage in the conversation by injecting utterances to steer the discussion focus.</li></ul><p>Co-STORM also maintains a dynamic updated , which organize collected information into a hierarchical concept structure, aiming to <strong>build a shared conceptual space between the human user and the system</strong>. The mind map has been proven to help reduce the mental load when the discourse goes long and in-depth.</p><p>Both STORM and Co-STORM are implemented in a highly modular way using <a href=\"https://github.com/stanfordnlp/dspy\">dspy</a>.</p><p>To install the knowledge storm library, use <code>pip install knowledge-storm</code>.</p><p>You could also install the source code which allows you to modify the behavior of STORM engine directly.</p><ol><li><p>Clone the git repository.</p><pre><code>git clone https://github.com/stanford-oval/storm.git\ncd storm\n</code></pre></li><li><p>Install the required packages.</p><pre><code>conda create -n storm python=3.11\nconda activate storm\npip install -r requirements.txt\n</code></pre></li></ol><p>Currently, our package support:</p><ul><li>Language model components: All language models supported by litellm as listed <a href=\"https://docs.litellm.ai/docs/providers\">here</a></li><li>Embedding model components: All embedding models supported by litellm as listed <a href=\"https://docs.litellm.ai/docs/embedding/supported_embedding\">here</a></li><li>retrieval module components: , , , , , , , , , and  as</li></ul><p>Both STORM and Co-STORM are working in the information curation layer, you need to set up the information retrieval module and language model module to create their  classes respectively.</p><p>The STORM knowledge curation engine is defined as a simple Python  class.

These modules can be customized according to your specific requirements (e.g., generating sections in bullet point format instead of full paragraphs).</p><p>If you have installed the source code, you can customize Co-STORM based on your own use case</p><ol><li>Co-STORM introduces multiple LLM agent types (i.e. Co-STORM experts and Moderator). LLM agent interface is defined in <code>knowledge_storm/interface.py</code> , while its implementation is instantiated in <code>knowledge_storm/collaborative_storm/modules/co_storm_agents.py</code>. Different LLM agent policies can be customized.</li><li>Co-STORM introduces a collaborative discourse protocol, with its core function centered on turn policy management. We provide an example implementation of turn policy management through  in <code>knowledge_storm/collaborative_storm/engine.py</code>. It can be customized and further improved.</li></ol><p>To facilitate the study of automatic knowledge curation and complex information seeking, our project releases the following datasets:</p><p>The FreshWiki Dataset is a collection of 100 high-quality Wikipedia articles focusing on the most-edited pages from February 2022 to September 2023.

For Docker setups, you need only fill in the following fields:</p><ul><li><p>: Your OpenAI API key. <strong>You only need to fill this if you wish to use OpenAI's models</strong>.</p></li><li><p>: Your Ollama API URL. You should enter it as <code>http://host.docker.internal:PORT_NUMBER</code>. If you installed Ollama on port 11434, use <code>http://host.docker.internal:11434</code>. For other ports, adjust accordingly. <strong>You need to fill this if you wish to use Ollama's models instead of OpenAI's</strong>.</p></li><li><p>: Your Groq API key. <strong>You only need to fill this if you wish to use Groq's hosted models</strong>.</p></li><li><p>: Your Anthropic API key. <strong>You only need to fill this if you wish to use Anthropic models</strong>.</p></li><li><p>: Your Gemini API key. <strong>You only need to fill this if you wish to use Google's models</strong>.</p><p>: You can change these after starting Perplexica from the settings dialog.</p></li><li><p>: The similarity measure to use (This is filled by default; you can leave it as is if you are unsure about it.)</p></li></ul></li><li><p>Ensure you are in the directory containing the  file and execute:</p></li><li><p>Wait a few minutes for the setup to complete.

This gives him autonomy to fixing visual bugs and runtime issues without you needing to handhold and copy-pasting error logs yourself.</p><p>Try asking Cline to \"test the app\", and watch as he runs a command like , launches your locally running dev server in a browser, and performs a series of tests to confirm that everything works. <a href=\"https://x.com/sdrzn/status/1850880547825823989\">See a demo here.</a></p><img align=\"right\" width=\"350\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ac0efa14-5c1f-4c26-a42d-9d7c56f5fadd\"><p>Thanks to the <a href=\"https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol\">Model Context Protocol</a>, Cline can extend his capabilities through custom tools. While you can use <a href=\"https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers\">community-made servers</a>, Cline can instead create and install tools tailored to your specific workflow. Just ask Cline to \"add a tool\" and he will handle everything, from creating a new MCP server to installing it into the extension. These custom tools then become part of Cline's toolkit, ready to use in future tasks.</p><ul><li>\"add a tool that fetches Jira tickets\": Retrieve ticket ACs and put Cline to work</li><li>\"add a tool that manages AWS EC2s\": Check server metrics and scale instances up or down</li><li>\"add a tool that pulls the latest PagerDuty incidents\": Fetch details and ask Cline to fix bugs</li></ul><img align=\"left\" width=\"360\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7fdf41e6-281a-4b4b-ac19-020b838b6970\"><p>&nbsp;Paste in a URL for the extension to fetch and convert to markdown, useful when you want to give Cline the latest docs</p><p>&nbsp;Add workspace errors and warnings ('Problems' panel) for Cline to fix</p><p>&nbsp;Adds a file's contents so you don't have to waste API requests approving read file (+ type to search files)</p><p>&nbsp;Adds folder's files all at once to speed up your workflow even more</p><img align=\"right\" width=\"350\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/140c8606-d3bf-41b9-9a1f-4dbf0d4c90cb\"><h3>Checkpoints: Compare and Restore</h3><p>As Cline works through a task, the extension takes a snapshot of your workspace at each step. You can use the 'Compare' button to see a diff between the snapshot and your current workspace, and the 'Restore' button to roll back to that point.</p><p>For example, when working with a local web server, you can use 'Restore Workspace Only' to quickly test different versions of your app, then use 'Restore Task and Workspace' when you find the version you want to continue building from.

It allows you to train models collaboratively with others in the swarm, leveraging their collective intelligence. It is open source and permissionless, meaning you can run it on a consumer laptop at home or on a powerful GPU in the cloud. You can also connect your model to the Gensyn Testnet to receive an on-chain identity that tracks your progress over time.</p><p>Currently, we are running the <a href=\"https://github.com/open-thought/reasoning-gym/tree/main\">reasoning-gym</a> swarm on the Testnet. This swarm is designed to train models to solve a diverse set of reasoning tasks using the reasoning-gym dataset. The current list of default models includes:</p><ul><li>Gensyn/Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct</li><li>dnotitia/Smoothie-Qwen3-1.7B</li><li>Gensyn/Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct</li></ul><p>This iteration of rl-swarm is powered by the <a href=\"https://github.com/gensyn-ai/genrl-swarm\">GenRL-Swarm</a> library. It is a fully composable framework for decentralized reinforcement learning which enables users to create and customize their own swarms for reinforcement learning with multi-agent multi-stage environments.</p><p>Your hardware requirements will vary depending on a number of factors including model size and the accelerator platform you use. Users running large NVIDIA GPU will be assigned a model from the large model pool, while users running less powerful hardware will be assigned a model from the small model pool. This design decision is intended to allow users to advance at a similar rate regardless of the hardware they use, maximizing their utility to the swarm.</p><ul><li>arm64 or x86 CPU with minimum 32gb ram (note that if you run other applications during training it might crash training).</li></ul><ul><li>CUDA devices (officially supported): \n  <ul></ul></li></ul><p>With either configuration, you will need Python &gt;=3.10 (for Mac, you will likely need to upgrade).</p><h2>‚ö†Ô∏è Please read before continuing ‚ö†Ô∏è</h2><p>This software is  and provided as-is for users who are interested in using (or helping to develop) an early version of the Gensyn Protocol for training models.</p><p>If you encounter issues, please first check <a href=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gensyn-ai/rl-swarm/main/#troubleshooting\">Troubleshooting</a>. If you cannot find a solution there, please check if there is an open (or closed) <a href=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gensyn-ai/issues\">Issue</a>. If there is no relevant issue, please file one and include 1) all relevant <a href=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gensyn-ai/rl-swarm/main/#troubleshooting\">logs</a>, 2) information about your device (e.g. which GPU, if relevant), and 3) your operating system information.</p><p>The easiest way to run RL Swarm is using Docker. This ensures a consistent setup across all operating systems with minimal dependencies.</p><pre><code>git clone https://github.com/gensyn-ai/rl-swarm\n</code></pre><p>Make sure you have Docker installed and the Docker daemon is running on your machine. To do that, follow <a href=\"https://docs.docker.com/get-started/get-docker/\">these instructions</a> according to your OS. Ensure you allot sufficient memory to the Docker containers. For example if using Docker Desktop, this can be done by going to Docker Desktop Settings &gt; Resources &gt; Advanced &gt; Memory Limit, and increasing it to the maximum possible value.</p><p>Run the following commands from the root of the repository.</p><p>If you‚Äôre using a Mac or if your machine has CPU-only support:</p><pre><code>docker-compose run --rm --build -Pit swarm-cpu\n</code></pre><p>If you're using a machine with an officially supported GPU:</p><pre><code>docker-compose run --rm --build -Pit swarm-gpu\n</code></pre><p>If  does not work when running the above commands, please try  (no hyphen) instead.

You can generate one from your Hugging Face account, under <a href=\"https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/en/security-tokens\">Access Tokens</a>.</p><h3>Initial peering and training</h3><p>From this stage onward your device will begin training. You should see your peer register and vote on-chain <a href=\"https://gensyn-testnet.explorer.alchemy.com/address/0xFaD7C5e93f28257429569B854151A1B8DCD404c2?tab=logs\">here</a>.</p><p>You can also track your training progress in real time:</p><p>On-chain identity is managed via an Alchemy modal sign-in screen. You need to supply an email address or login via a supported method (e.g. Google). This creates an EOA public/private key (which are stored by Alchemy). You will also receive local session keys in the . Note that these aren't your EOA public/private keys.</p><p>During the initial set-up process, you will also create a  file which maintains the identity of your peer. This is then registered on chain using the EOA wallet hosted in Alchemy, triggered using your local api keys. This links the  to the  (and corresponding EOA in Alchemy).</p><p><strong>If you want to link multiple nodes to a single EOA</strong>, simply sign up each node using the same email address. You will get a new peer ID for each node, however they will all be linked to the same EOA that your email is linked to.</p><p>: if you are using a fork of this repo, or a service organised by someone else (e.g. a 'one click deployment' provider) the identity management flow below is not guaranteed.</p><p>In the following two scenarios, everything will work (i.e. you will have an on-chain identity linked with your RL Swarm peer training):</p><ul><li>The very first time you run the node from scratch with a new email address. The smart account will be created fresh and linked with the swarm.pem that is also fresh.</li><li>If you run it again with a  AND login the original  used with that . Note: this will throw an error into the log on registration but will still be able to sign transactions.</li></ul><p>In the following two scenarios, it will not work (i.e. you won't have an on-chain identity linked with your RL Swarm peer training):</p><ul><li>If you keep your  and try to link it to an  distinct from the one with which it was first registered.</li></ul><p>Therefore, you should do these actions in the following scenarios</p><ul><li><strong>Signed up with , generated , BUT lost </strong> OR <strong>You want to run multiple nodes at once</strong>: run from scratch with the same email address and generate a new .</li><li><strong>Signed up with , generated , kept </strong> -&gt; you can re-run a single node using this pair if you've still got them both.</li></ul><ul><li><p> You can find them inside the  directory:</p><ul><li>: This file contains logs for the modal login server.</li><li>: This is the main log file for the RL Swarm application.</li><li>: This directory contains various logs related to your training runs, including a  file. These can be updated to Weights &amp; Biases (only available if you log_with wandb).</li></ul></li><li><p><strong>My peer 'skipped a round'</strong>: this occurs when your device isn't fast enough to keep up with the pace of the swarm. For example, if you start training at round 100 and by the time you finish training the rest of the swarm reaches round 102, you will skip round 101 and go straight to 102. This is because your peer is more valuable if it is participating in the active round.</p></li><li><p><strong>My model doesn't seem to be training?</strong></p><ul><li>If you're using a consumer device (e.g. a MacBook), it is likely just running slowly - check back in 20 minutes.</li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Logging in with a new account after previous login?</strong></p><ul><li>Make sure you click 'Logout' on the login screen before you leave your previous session</li><li>Make sure you delete  from the root directory (try ). If you don't do this, and you previously registered with the peer-id stored in this file, it will disrupt the training process.</li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Issues with the Login screen</strong></p><ul><li>: some users report issues with the  package. There are two fixes: \n    <ul><li>in the  update: </li><li>in the terminal <code>cd /root/rl-swarm/modal-login/ &amp;&amp; yarn upgrade &amp;&amp; yarn add next@latest &amp;&amp; yarn add viem@latest</code></li></ul></li></ul></li><li><p><strong>I'm getting lots of warnings</strong></p><ul><li>This is expected behaviour and usually the output of the package managers or other dependencies. The most common is the below Protobuf warning - which can be ignored <pre><code>WARNING: The candidate selected for download or install is a yanked version: 'protobuf' candidate...\n</code></pre></li></ul></li><li><ul><li><p><strong>How do I access the login screen if I'm running in a VM?</strong>: port forwarding. Add this SSH flag:  when connecting to your VM. E.g. <code>gcloud compute ssh --zone \"us-central1-a\" [your-vm] --project [your-project] -- -L 3000:localhost:3000</code>. Note, some VPSs may not work with . Check the Gensyn <a href=\"https://discord.gg/AdnyWNzXh5\">discord</a> for up-to-date information on this.</p></li><li><p><strong>Disconnection/general issues</strong>: If you are tunneling to a VM and suffer a broken pipe, you will likely encounter OOM or unexpected behaviour the first time you relaunch the script. If you  and kill the script it should spin down all background processes. Restart the script and everything should work normally.</p></li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Issues with npm/general installation?</strong></p><ul><li>Try <code>npm install -g node@latest</code></li></ul></li><li><ul><li>Try this (experimental) fix to increase memory: <pre><code>export PYTORCH_MPS_HIGH_WATERMARK_RATIO=0.0\n</code></pre></li></ul></li><li><p><strong>I have a Windows machine, can I still train a model on the swarm?</strong>: Yes - but this is not very well tested and may require you to do some debugging to get it set up properly. Install WSL and Linux on your Windows machine using the following instructions: <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install\">https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install</a></p></li><li><p><strong>I want to move my to a different machine and/or restart with a fresh build of the repo, but I want my animal name/peer id to persist.</strong>: To achieve this simply backup the  file on your current machine and then put it in the corresponding location on your new machine/build of the repo.</p></li><li><p><strong>I have multiple GPUs on one machine, can I run multiple peers?</strong>: Yes - but you'll need to manually change things. You'll need to isolate each GPU, install this repo for each GPU, and expose each peer under a different port to pass the modal onboard.</p></li><li><p><strong>My round/stage is behind the smart contract/other peers?</strong>: This is expected behaviour given the different speeds of machines in the network. Once your machine completes it's current round, it will move to the the current round.</p></li><li><p><strong>I want to use a bigger and/or different model in the RL swarm, can I do that?</strong>: Yes - but we only recommend doing so if you are comfortable understanding what size model can reasonably run on your hardware. If you elect to bring a custom model, just paste the repo/model name into the command line when prompted.</p></li><li><p><strong>I am running a model in the swarm on my CPU, have received a python , and my training progress seems to have stopped.</strong>: There are several possible causes for this, but before trying anything please wait long enough to be sure your training actually is frozen and not just slow (e.g., wait longer than a single training iteration has previously taken on your machine). If you're sure training is actually frozen, then some things to try are:</p><ul><li>Set this (experimental) fix: <code>export PYTORCH_MPS_HIGH_WATERMARK_RATIO=0.0 &amp;&amp; ./run_rl_swarm.sh</code></li></ul></li></ul>","contentLength":10287,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"microsoft/generative-ai-for-beginners","url":"https://github.com/microsoft/generative-ai-for-beginners","date":1750991844,"author":"","guid":172652,"unread":true,"content":"<p>21 Lessons, Get Started Building with Generative AI üîó https://microsoft.github.io/generative-ai-for-beginners/</p><h3>21 Lessons teaching everything you need to know to start building Generative AI applications</h3><h4>Supported via GitHub Action (Automated &amp; Always Up-to-Date)</h4><p>Learn the fundamentals of building Generative AI applications with our 21-lesson comprehensive course by Microsoft Cloud Advocates.</p><p>This course has 21 lessons.

In addition, this curriculum has a common  to give it cohesion.</p><p>By ensuring that the content aligns with projects, the process is made more engaging for students and retention of concepts will be augmented. In addition, a low-stakes quiz before a class sets the intention of the student towards learning a topic, while a second quiz after class ensures further retention. This curriculum was designed to be flexible and fun and can be taken in whole or in part. The projects start small and become increasingly complex by the end of the 12-week cycle. This curriculum also includes a postscript on real-world applications of ML, which can be used as extra credit or as a basis for discussion.</p><ul><li>optional supplemental video</li><li>video walkthrough (some lessons only)</li><li>for project-based lessons, step-by-step guides on how to build the project</li></ul><blockquote><p>: These lessons are primarily written in Python, but many are also available in R.

Those commands are still available but are hidden in the  menu. Take a look at this <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/zricethezav/b325bb93ebf41b9c0b0507acf12810d2\">gist</a> for easy command translations. If you find v8.19.0 broke an existing command (/), please open an issue.</p><p>There are three scanning modes: , , and .</p><p>The  command lets you scan local git repos. Under the hood, gitleaks uses the  command to scan patches. You can configure the behavior of  with the  option. For example, if you wanted to run gitleaks on a range of commits you could use the following command: <code>gitleaks git -v --log-opts=\"--all commitA..commitB\" path_to_repo</code>. See the <a href=\"https://git-scm.com/docs/git-log\">git log</a> documentation for more information. If there is no target specified as a positional argument, then gitleaks will attempt to scan the current working directory as a git repo.</p><p>The  (aliases include , ) command lets you scan directories and files. Example: <code>gitleaks dir -v path_to_directory_or_file</code>. If there is no target specified as a positional argument, then gitleaks will scan the current working directory.</p><p>You can also stream data to gitleaks with the  command.

In release v8.10.0 Gitleaks added a  value to the Gitleaks report. Each leak, or finding, has a Fingerprint that uniquely identifies a secret. Add this fingerprint to the  file to ignore that specific secret. See Gitleaks' <a href=\"https://github.com/gitleaks/gitleaks/raw/master/.gitleaksignore\">.gitleaksignore</a> for an example. Note: this feature is experimental and is subject to change in the future.</p><p>Sometimes secrets are encoded in a way that can make them difficult to find with just regex. Now you can tell gitleaks to automatically find and decode encoded text. The flag  enables this feature (the default value \"0\" means the feature is disabled by default).</p><p>Recursive decoding is supported since decoded text can also contain encoded text. The flag  sets the recursion limit. Recursion stops when there are no new segments of encoded text to decode, so setting a really high max depth doesn't mean it will make that many passes. It will only make as many as it needs to decode the text. Overall, decoding only minimally increases scan times.</p><p>The findings for encoded text differ from normal findings in the following ways:</p><ul><li>The location points the bounds of the encoded text \n  <ul><li>If the rule matches outside the encoded text, the bounds are adjusted to include that as well</li></ul></li><li>The match and secret contain the decoded value</li><li>Two tags are added  and </li></ul><p>Currently supported encodings:</p><ul><li> - Any printable ASCII percent encoded values</li><li> - Any printable ASCII hex encoded values &gt;= 32 characters</li><li> - Any printable ASCII base64 encoded values &gt;= 16 characters</li></ul><p>Sometimes secrets are packaged within archive files like zip files or tarballs, making them difficult to discover. Now you can tell gitleaks to automatically extract and scan the contents of archives. The flag  enables this feature for both  and  scan types. The default value of \"0\" means this feature is disabled by default.</p><p>Recursive scanning is supported since archives can also contain other archives. The  flag sets the recursion limit. Recursion stops when there are no new archives to extract, so setting a very high max depth just sets the potential to go that deep. It will only go as deep as it needs to.</p><p>The findings for secrets located within an archive will include the path to the file inside the archive.

\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/mikeroyal/Self-Hosting-Guide#table-of-contents\">Back to the Top</a></p> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/\">Self-Hosting</a> is the practice of locally hosting(on premises &amp; private web servers) and managing software applications by a person or organization instead of monthly subscriptions from <a href=\"https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/overview/what-is-saas/\">Software as a service (SaaS) providers</a>.</p> \n<p>Most self-hosted software can be installed using <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Docker_(software)\">Docker</a>, a packaging system which allows software to bundle their configuration and dependencies and isolate them from your operating system. Software using docker can be installed using the command line or via graphical interfaces such as <a href=\"https://github.com/portainer/portainer\">Portainer</a>. Software is installed with Docker by downloading an image file containing the application, then creating a copy that sets up its own dependencies and configuration within what is called a container. Without containers you would often need to install different versions of the same programming languages or tools to satisfy the dependencies for the software you want to use which can get complicated.</p> \n<p align=\"center\"> <img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/45159366/152699308-36691800-8078-4af3-9d5c-711da4e9b26e.png\"> <br> </p> \n<h2>Tools for Self-Hosting</h2> \n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/mikeroyal/Self-Hosting-Guide#table-of-contents\">Back to the Top</a></p> \n<h3>Containers</h3> \n<p><a href=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mikeroyal/Self-Hosting-Guide/main/#table-of-contents\">Back to the Top</a></p> \n<p><strong>Container</strong> is a standard unit of software that packages up code and all its dependencies(including CPU, memory, file storage, and network connections) so the application runs quickly and reliably from one computing environment to another.</p> \n<ul> \n <li><a href=\"https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-190.pdf\">Application Container Security Guide | NIST (PDF)</a></li> \n</ul> \n<p><strong>Container Image</strong> is a lightweight, standalone, executable package of software that includes everything needed to run an application such as the code, runtime, system tools, system libraries, and settings.</p> \n<p><strong>Best places to get Container Images:</strong></p> \n<ul> \n <li><a href=\"https://hub.docker.com/search?image_filter=official&amp;q=&amp;type=image\">DockerHub Container Images</a></li> \n <li><a href=\"https://fleet.linuxserver.io/\">LinuxServer.io Container Images</a></li> \n <li><a href=\"https://quay.io/search\">Quay Container Images</a></li> \n</ul> \n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/docker/compose\">Docker Compose</a> is a tool that was developed to help define and share multi-container applications.

It can be used to inspect/modify requests copied from the browser's network inspector with the \"copy as cURL\" feature.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/vi/websocat\">Websocat</a> is a ommand-line client for WebSockets, like netcat (or curl) for ws:// with advanced socat-like functions.</p> \n<pre><code>‚Ä¢ Connection: In networking, a connection refers to pieces of related information that are transferred through a network. This generally infers that a connection is built before the data transfer (by following the procedures laid out in a protocol) and then is deconstructed at the at the end of the data transfer.\n\n‚Ä¢ Packet: A packet is, generally speaking, the most basic unit that is transferred over a network. When communicating over a network, packets are the envelopes that carry your data (in pieces) from one end point to the other.\n</code></pre> \n<p>Packets have a header portion that contains information about the packet including the source and destination, timestamps, network hops. The main portion of a packet contains the actual data being transferred. It is sometimes called the body or the payload.</p> \n<pre><code>‚Ä¢ Network Interface: A network interface can refer to any kind of software interface to networking hardware. For instance, if you have two network cards in your computer, you can control and configure each network interface associated with them individually.\n</code></pre> \n<p>A network interface may be associated with a physical device, or it may be a representation of a virtual interface. The \"loop-back\" device, which is a virtual interface to the local machine, is an example of this.</p> \n<pre><code>‚Ä¢ LAN: LAN stands for \"local area network\". It refers to a network or a portion of a network that is not publicly accessible to the greater internet. A home or office network is an example of a LAN.\n\n‚Ä¢ WAN: WAN stands for \"wide area network\". It means a network that is much more extensive than a LAN. While WAN is the relevant term to use to describe large, dispersed networks in general, it is usually meant to mean the internet, as a whole.\n</code></pre> \n<p>If an interface is connected to the WAN, it is generally assumed that it is reachable through the internet.</p> \n<pre><code>‚Ä¢ Protocol: A protocol is a set of rules and standards that basically define a language that devices can use to communicate. There are a great number of protocols in use extensively in networking, and they are often implemented in different layers.\n</code></pre> \n<p>Some low level protocols are TCP, UDP, IP, and ICMP. Some familiar examples of application layer protocols, built on these lower protocols, are HTTP (for accessing web content), SSH, TLS/SSL, and FTP.</p> \n<pre><code>‚Ä¢ Port: A port is an address on a single machine that can be tied to a specific piece of software. It is not a physical interface or location, but it allows your server to be able to communicate using more than one application.\n\n‚Ä¢ Firewall: A firewall is a program that decides whether traffic coming into a server or going out should be allowed. A firewall usually works by creating rules for which type of traffic is acceptable on which ports. Generally, firewalls block ports that are not used by a specific application on a server.\n\n‚Ä¢ NAT: Network address translation is a way to translate requests that are incoming into a routing server to the relevant devices or servers that it knows about in the LAN. This is usually implemented in physical LANs as a way to route requests through one IP address to the necessary backend servers.\n\n‚Ä¢ VPN: Virtual private network is a means of connecting separate LANs through the internet, while maintaining privacy. This is used as a means of connecting remote systems as if they were on a local network, often for security reasons.\n</code></pre> \n<h2>Network Layers</h2> \n<pre><code>While networking is often discussed in terms of topology in a horizontal way, between hosts, its implementation is layered in a vertical fashion throughout a computer or network. This means is that there are multiple technologies and protocols that are built on top of each other in order for communication to function more easily. Each successive, higher layer abstracts the raw data a little bit more, and makes it simpler to use for applications and users. It also allows you to leverage lower layers in new ways without having to invest the time and energy to develop the protocols and applications that handle those types of traffic.\n\nAs data is sent out of one machine, it begins at the top of the stack and filters downwards. At the lowest level, actual transmission to another machine takes place. At this point, the data travels back up through the layers of the other computer. Each layer has the ability to add its own \"wrapper\" around the data that it receives from the adjacent layer, which will help the layers that come after decide what to do with the data when it is passed off.\n\nOne method of talking about the different layers of network communication is the OSI model. OSI stands for Open Systems Interconnect.This model defines seven separate layers. The layers in this model are:\n\n‚Ä¢ Application: The application layer is the layer that the users and user-applications most often interact with. Network communication is discussed in terms of availability of resources, partners to communicate with, and data synchronization.\n\n‚Ä¢ Presentation: The presentation layer is responsible for mapping resources and creating context. It is used to translate lower level networking data into data that applications expect to see.\n\n‚Ä¢ Session: The session layer is a connection handler. It creates, maintains, and destroys connections between nodes in a persistent way.\n\n‚Ä¢ Transport: The transport layer is responsible for handing the layers above it a reliable connection. In this context, reliable refers to the ability to verify that a piece of data was received intact at the other end of the connection. This layer can resend information that has been dropped or corrupted and can acknowledge the receipt of data to remote computers.\n\n‚Ä¢ Network: The network layer is used to route data between different nodes on the network. It uses addresses to be able to tell which computer to send information to. This layer can also break apart larger messages into smaller chunks to be reassembled on the opposite end.\n\n‚Ä¢ Data Link: This layer is implemented as a method of establishing and maintaining reliable links between different nodes or devices on a network using existing physical connections.\n\n‚Ä¢ Physical: The physical layer is responsible for handling the actual physical devices that are used to make a connection. This layer involves the bare software that manages physical connections as well as the hardware itself (like Ethernet).\n</code></pre> \n<p>The TCP/IP model, more commonly known as the Internet protocol suite, is another layering model that is simpler and has been widely adopted.It defines the four separate layers, some of which overlap with the OSI model:</p> \n<pre><code>‚Ä¢ Application: In this model, the application layer is responsible for creating and transmitting user data between applications. The applications can be on remote systems, and should appear to operate as if locally to the end user.\n</code></pre> \n<p>The communication takes place between peers network.</p> \n<pre><code>‚Ä¢ Transport: The transport layer is responsible for communication between processes. This level of networking utilizes ports to address different services. It can build up unreliable or reliable connections depending on the type of protocol used.\n\n‚Ä¢ Internet: The internet layer is used to transport data from node to node in a network. This layer is aware of the endpoints of the connections, but does not worry about the actual connection needed to get from one place to another. IP addresses are defined in this layer as a way of reaching remote systems in an addressable manner.\n\n‚Ä¢ Link: The link layer implements the actual topology of the local network that allows the internet layer to present an addressable interface. It establishes connections between neighboring nodes to send data.\n</code></pre> \n<h3>Interfaces</h3> \n<p><strong>Interfaces</strong> are networking communication points for your computer. Each interface is associated with a physical or virtual networking device. Typically, your server will have one configurable network interface for each Ethernet or wireless internet card you have. In addition, it will define a virtual network interface called the \"loopback\" or localhost interface. This is used as an interface to connect applications and processes on a single computer to other applications and processes. You can see this referenced as the \"lo\" interface in many tools.</p> \n<h2>Network Protocols</h2> \n<p>Networking works by piggybacks on a number of different protocols on top of each other. In this way, one piece of data can be transmitted using multiple protocols encapsulated within one another.</p> \n<p><strong>Media Access Control(MAC)</strong> is a communications protocol that is used to distinguish specific devices. Each device is supposed to get a unique MAC address during the manufacturing process that differentiates it from every other device on the internet. Addressing hardware by the MAC address allows you to reference a device by a unique value even when the software on top may change the name for that specific device during operation. Media access control is one of the only protocols from the link layer that you are likely to interact with on a regular basis.</p> \n<p><strong>The IP protocol</strong> is one of the fundamental protocols that allow the internet to work. IP addresses are unique on each network and they allow machines to address each other across a network. It is implemented on the internet layer in the IP/TCP model. Networks can be linked together, but traffic must be routed when crossing network boundaries. This protocol assumes an unreliable network and multiple paths to the same destination that it can dynamically change between. There are a number of different implementations of the protocol. The most common implementation today is IPv4, although IPv6 is growing in popularity as an alternative due to the scarcity of IPv4 addresses available and improvements in the protocols capabilities.</p> \n<p><strong>ICMP: internet control message protocol</strong> is used to send messages between devices to indicate the availability or error conditions. These packets are used in a variety of network diagnostic tools, such as ping and traceroute. Usually ICMP packets are transmitted when a packet of a different kind meets some kind of a problem. Basically, they are used as a feedback mechanism for network communications.</p> \n<p><strong>TCP: Transmission control protocol</strong> is implemented in the transport layer of the IP/TCP model and is used to establish reliable connections. TCP is one of the protocols that encapsulates data into packets. It then transfers these to the remote end of the connection using the methods available on the lower layers. On the other end, it can check for errors, request certain pieces to be resent, and reassemble the information into one logical piece to send to the application layer. The protocol builds up a connection prior to data transfer using a system called a three-way handshake. This is a way for the two ends of the communication to acknowledge the request and agree upon a method of ensuring data reliability. After the data has been sent, the connection is torn down using a similar four-way handshake. TCP is the protocol of choice for many of the most popular uses for the internet, including WWW, FTP, SSH, and email. It is safe to say that the internet we know today would not be here without TCP.</p> \n<p><strong>UDP: User datagram protocol</strong> is a popular companion protocol to TCP and is also implemented in the transport layer. The fundamental difference between UDP and TCP is that UDP offers unreliable data transfer. It does not verify that data has been received on the other end of the connection. This might sound like a bad thing, and for many purposes, it is. However, it is also extremely important for some functions. It‚Äôs not required to wait for confirmation that the data was received and forced to resend data, UDP is much faster than TCP. It does not establish a connection with the remote host, it simply fires off the data to that host and doesn't care if it is accepted or not. Since UDP is a simple transaction, it is useful for simple communications like querying for network resources. It also doesn't maintain a state, which makes it great for transmitting data from one machine to many real-time clients. This makes it ideal for VOIP, games, and other applications that cannot afford delays.</p> \n<p><strong>HTTP: Hypertext transfer protocol</strong> is a protocol defined in the application layer that forms the basis for communication on the web. HTTP defines a number of functions that tell the remote system what you are requesting. For instance, GET, POST, and DELETE all interact with the requested data in a different way.</p> \n<p><strong>FTP: File transfer protocol</strong> is in the application layer and provides a way of transferring complete files from one host to another. It is inherently insecure, so it is not recommended for any externally facing network unless it is implemented as a public, download-only resource.</p> \n<p><strong>DNS: Domain name system</strong> is an application layer protocol used to provide a human-friendly naming mechanism for internet resources. It is what ties a domain name to an IP address and allows you to access sites by name in your browser.</p> \n<p><strong>SSH: Secure shell</strong> is an encrypted protocol implemented in the application layer that can be used to communicate with a remote server in a secure way. Many additional technologies are built around this protocol because of its end-to-end encryption and ubiquity. There are many other protocols that we haven't covered that are equally important. However, this should give you a good overview of some of the fundamental technologies that make the internet and networking possible.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.codecademy.com/articles/what-is-rest\">REST(REpresentational State Transfer)</a> is an architectural style for providing standards between computer systems on the web, making it easier for systems to communicate with each other.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://jwt.io\">JSON Web Token (JWT)</a> is a compact URL-safe means of representing claims to be transferred between two parties.

It's designed for developers interested in advanced web graphics and window management techniques.</p> \n<h2>Features</h2> \n<ul> \n <li>3D scene creation and rendering with Three.js.</li> \n <li>Synchronization of 3D scenes across multiple browser windows.</li> \n <li>Dynamic window management and state synchronization using localStorage.</li> \n</ul> \n<h2>Installation</h2> \n<p>Clone the repository and open <code>index.html</code> in your browser to start exploring the 3D scene.</p> \n<pre><code>git clone https://github.com/bgstaal/multipleWindow3dScene\n</code></pre> \n<h2>Usage</h2> \n<p>The main application logic is contained within <code>main.js</code> and <code>WindowManager.js</code>. The 3D scene is rendered in <code>index.html</code>, which serves as the entry point of the application.</p> \n<h2>Structure and Components</h2> \n<ul> \n <li><code>index.html</code>: Entry point that sets up the HTML structure and includes the Three.js library and the main script.</li> \n <li><code>WindowManager.js</code>: Core class managing window creation, synchronization, and state management across multiple windows.</li> \n <li><code>main.js</code>: Contains the logic for initializing the 3D scene, handling window events, and rendering the scene.</li> \n <li><code>three.r124.min.js</code>: Minified version of the Three.js library used for 3D graphics rendering.</li> \n</ul> \n<h2>Detailed Functionality</h2> \n<ul> \n <li><code>WindowManager.js</code> handles the lifecycle of multiple browser windows, including creation, synchronization, and removal. It uses localStorage to maintain state across windows.</li> \n <li><code>main.js</code> initializes the 3D scene using Three.js, manages the window's resize events, and updates the scene based on window interactions.</li> \n</ul> \n<h2>Contributing</h2> \n<p>Contributions to enhance or expand the project are welcome.

To be eligible, a service must offer a free tier, not just a free trial. The free tier must be for at least a year if it is time-bucketed. We also consider the free tier from a security perspective, so SSO is fine, but I will not accept services that restrict TLS to paid-only tiers.</p> \n<h1>Table of Contents</h1> \n<ul> \n <li><a

If you are looking for examples that work with the latest stable release of dioxus, check out the <a href=\"https://github.com/DioxusLabs/dioxus/tree/v0.6/examples\">0.6 branch</a>.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>The examples in the top level of this repository can be run with:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"language-sh\">cargo run --example &lt;example&gt;\n</code></pre> \n<p>However, we encourage you to download the dioxus-cli. If you are running the git version of dioxus, you can install the matching version of the CLI with:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"language-sh\">cargo install --git https://github.com/DioxusLabs/dioxus dioxus-cli --locked\n</code></pre> \n<p>With the CLI, you can also run examples with the web platform. You just need to disable the default desktop feature and enable the web feature with this command:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"language-sh\">dx serve --example &lt;example&gt; --platform web -- --no-default-features\n</code></pre> \n<h2>Dioxus vs other frameworks</h2> \n<p>We love all frameworks and enjoy watching innovation in the Rust ecosystem. In fact, many of our projects are shared with other frameworks. For example, our flex-box library <a href=\"https://github.com/DioxusLabs/taffy\">Taffy</a> is used by <a href=\"https://bevyengine.org/\">Bevy</a>, <a href=\"https://zed.dev/\">Zed</a>, <a href=\"https://lapce.dev/\">Lapce</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/iced-rs/iced\">Iced</a>, and many more.</p> \n<p>Dioxus places an emphasis on a few key points that make it different from other frameworks:</p> \n<ul> \n <li><strong>React-like</strong>: we rely on concepts like components, props, and hooks to build UIs, with our state management being closer to Svelte than to SolidJS.</li> \n <li><strong>HTML and CSS</strong>: we lean completely into HTML and CSS, quirks and all.</li> \n <li><strong>Renderer-agnostic</strong>: you can swap out the renderer for any platform you want thanks to <a href=\"https://dioxuslabs.com/blog/templates-diffing\">our fast VirtualDOM</a>.</li> \n <li><strong>Collaborative</strong>: whenever possible, we spin out crates like <a href=\"https://github.com/DioxusLabs/taffy\">Taffy</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/DioxusLabs/manganis\">manganis</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/DioxusLabs/include_mdbook\">include_mdbook</a>, and <a href=\"http://github.com/dioxusLabs/blitz\">blitz</a> so the ecosystem can grow together.</li> \n</ul> \n<h3>Dioxus vs Tauri</h3> \n<p>Tauri is a framework for building desktop mobile apps where your frontend is written in a web-based framework like React, Vue, Svelte, etc. Whenever you need to do native work, you can write Rust functions and call them from your frontend.</p> \n<ul> \n <li> <p><strong>Natively Rust</strong>: Tauri's architecture limits your UI to either JavaScript or WebAssembly. With Dioxus, your Rust code is running natively on the user's machine, letting you do things like spawning threads, accessing the filesystem, without any IPC bridge. This drastically simplifies your app's architecture and makes it easier to build. You can build a Tauri app with Dioxus-Web as a frontend if you'd like.</p> </li> \n <li> <p><strong>Different scopes</strong>: Tauri needs to support JavaScript and its complex build tooling, limiting the scope of what you can do with it. Since Dioxus is exclusively focused on Rust, we're able to provide extra utilities like Server Functions, advanced bundling, and a native renderer.</p> </li> \n <li> <p><strong>Shared DNA</strong>: While Tauri and Dioxus are separate projects, they do share libraries like Tao and Wry: windowing and webview libraries maintained by the Tauri team.</p> </li> \n</ul> \n<h3>Dioxus vs Leptos</h3> \n<p>Leptos is a library for building fullstack web-apps, similar to SolidJS and SolidStart. The two libraries share similar goals on the web, but have several key differences:</p> \n<ul> \n <li> <p><strong>Reactivity model</strong>: Leptos uses signals to drive both reactivity and rendering, while Dioxus uses signals just for reactivity. For managing re-renders, Dioxus uses a highly optimized VirtualDOM to support desktop and mobile architectures. Both Dioxus and Leptos are extremely fast.</p> </li> \n <li> <p><strong>Different scopes</strong>: Dioxus provides renderers for web, desktop, mobile, LiveView, and more. We also maintain community libraries and a cross-platform SDK. Leptos has a tighter focus on the fullstack web with features that Dioxus doesn't have like islands, <code>&lt;Form /&gt;</code> components, and other web-specific utilities.</p> </li> \n <li> <p><strong>Different DSLs</strong>: Dioxus uses its own custom Rust-like DSL for building UIs while Leptos uses an HTML-like syntax. We chose this to retain compatibility with IDE features like code-folding and syntax highlighting. Generally, Dioxus leans into more \"magic\" with its DSL including automatic formatting of strings and hot-reloading of simple Rust expressions.</p> </li> \n</ul> \n<pre><code class=\"language-rust\">// dioxus\nrsx! {\n  div {\n    class: \"my-class\",\n    enabled: true,\n    \"Hello, {name}\"\n  }\n}\n\n// leptos\nview! {\n  &lt;div class=\"my-class\" enabled={true}&gt;\n    \"Hello \"\n    {name}\n  &lt;/div&gt;\n}\n</code></pre> \n<h3>Dioxus vs Yew</h3> \n<p>Yew is a framework for building single-page web apps and initially served as an inspiration for Dioxus. Unfortunately, the architecture of Yew didn't support the various features we wanted, and thus Dioxus was born.</p> \n<ul> \n <li> <p><strong>Single-page apps</strong>: Yew is designed exclusively for single-page web apps and is intrinsically tied to the web platform. Dioxus is fullstack and cross-platform, making it suitable for building web, desktop, mobile, and server apps.</p> </li> \n <li> <p><strong>Developer Tooling</strong>: Dioxus provides a number of utilities like autoformatting, hot-reloading, and a bundler.</p> </li> \n <li> <p><strong>Ongoing support</strong>: Dioxus is very actively maintained with new features and bug fixes being added on a daily basis.</p> </li> \n</ul> \n<h3>Dioxus vs egui</h3> \n<p>egui is a cross-platform GUI library for Rust powering tools like <a href=\"https://www.rerun.io\">Rerun.io</a>.</p> \n<ul> \n <li> <p><strong>Immediate vs Retained</strong>: egui is designed to be re-rendered on every frame. This is suitable for games and other interactive applications, but it does not retain style and layout state between frames. Dioxus is a retained UI framework, meaning that the UI is built once and then modified between frames. This enables Dioxus to use native web technologies like HTML and CSS with better battery life and performance.</p> </li> \n <li> <p><strong>Customizable</strong>: egui brings its own styling and layout solution while Dioxus expects you to use the built-in HTML and CSS. This enables dioxus apps to use any CSS library like Tailwind or Material UI.</p> </li> \n <li> <p><strong>State management</strong>: egui's state management is based on a single global state object. Dioxus encourages encapsulation of state by using components and props, making components more reusable.</p> </li> \n</ul> \n<h3>Dioxus vs Iced</h3> \n<p>Iced is a cross-platform GUI library inspired by Elm. Iced renders natively with WGPU and supports the web using DOM nodes.</p> \n<ul> \n <li> <p><strong>Elm state management</strong>: Iced uses Elm's state management model, which is based on message passing and reducers. This is simply a different state management model than Dioxus and can be rather verbose at times.</p> </li> \n <li> <p><strong>Native Feel</strong>: Since Dioxus uses a webview as its renderer, it automatically gets native text input, paste handling, and other native features like accessibility. Iced's renderer currently doesn't implement these features, making it feel less native.</p> </li> \n <li> <p><strong>WGPU</strong>: Dioxus' WGPU renderer is currently quite immature and not yet ready for production use. Iced's WGPU renderer is much more mature and is being used in production. This enables certain types of apps that need GPU access to be built with Iced that can't currently be built with Dioxus.</p> </li> \n</ul> \n<h3>Dioxus vs Electron</h3> \n<p>Dioxus and Electron are two entirely different projects with similar goals. Electron makes it possible for developers to build cross-platform desktop apps using web technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</p> \n<ul> \n <li> <p><strong>Lightweight</strong>: Dioxus uses the system's native WebView - or optionally, a WGPU renderer - to render the UI. This makes a typical Dioxus app about 15mb on macOS in comparison to Electron's 100mb. Electron also ships an embedded chromium instance which cannot share system resources with the host OS in the same way as Dioxus.</p> </li> \n <li> <p><strong>Maturity</strong>: Electron is a mature project with a large community and a lot of tooling. Dioxus is still quite young in comparison to Electron. Expect to run into features like deep-linking that require extra work to implement.</p> </li> \n</ul> \n<h2>Contributing</h2> \n<ul> \n <li>Check out the website <a href=\"https://dioxuslabs.com/learn/0.6/contributing\">section on contributing</a>.</li> \n <li>Report issues on our <a href=\"https://github.com/dioxuslabs/dioxus/issues\">issue tracker</a>.</li> \n <li><a href=\"https://discord.gg/XgGxMSkvUM\">Join</a> the discord and ask questions!</li> \n</ul> \n<a href=\"https://github.com/dioxuslabs/dioxus/graphs/contributors\"> <img src=\"https://contrib.rocks/image?repo=dioxuslabs/dioxus&amp;max=30&amp;columns=10\"> </a> \n<h2>License</h2> \n<p>This project is licensed under either the <a href=\"https://github.com/DioxusLabs/dioxus/raw/master/LICENSE-MIT\">MIT license</a> or the <a href=\"https://github.com/DioxusLabs/dioxus/raw/master/LICENSE-APACHE\">Apache-2 License</a>.</p> \n<p>Unless you explicitly state otherwise, any contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in Dioxus by you, shall be licensed as MIT or Apache-2, without any additional terms or conditions.</p>","contentLength":0,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null}],"tags":["trending"]}
