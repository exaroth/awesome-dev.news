Kroger, the country's largest supermarket chain, had already been using digital price tags in its stores. \n\nKroger told lawmakers that it doesn't use facial recognition to help it set prices, a stance the company reiterated to the Tech Brief on Thursday. Still, the uproar helped to spark a push by consumer advocates who warn that the threat of invasive, personalized pricing schemes is real.

That trade-off has made LFP batteries the go-to choice for standard-range EVs in China, helping to make electric cars more affordable and limit pollution. Now, American companies are starting to build their own LFP batteries to catch up to their Chinese rivals... But there are plenty of barriers for U.S. companies that want to adopt a technology dominated by Chinese firms. Tariffs and tax credit restrictions have made it too expensive for most American automakers to import LFP batteries from China, and national security concerns have made it hard for American companies to partner with Chinese battery makers to build factories in the United States... \n\n\nAlthough American scientists invented LFP batteries in 1997, U.S. automakers didn't invest in the technology. Instead, they bet on NMC batteries because they have longer range, a big concern for American EV buyers. \"Everyone in the West thought LFP was a nonstarter five or six years ago,\" said Adrian Yao, who founded STEER, a technology research group within Stanford University. \"We really did have a myopic focus on\" range, he added. That left the door open for Chinese companies to perfect LFP batteries, which have a few advantages. Instead of pricey nickel and cobalt, they use iron, which makes them 20 percent cheaper than NMC batteries, according to the International Energy Agency. While NMC batteries can be recharged up to about 1,000 times before they go kaput — which is enough to put 200,000 miles on most EVs — LFP batteries can last two or three times as long, according to Moura. Plus, LFP batteries' chemistry makes them less likely to catch fire and easier to extinguish. An NMC battery, on the other hand, is so flammable that \"you could put it underwater or in space, and it'll keep burning because the oxygen it needs to keep the flame going is embedded within itself,\" Moura said. \n\nThat safety advantage is key, because Chinese firms figured out they could pack LFP cells closer together inside a battery pack without risking a fire. That meant they could cram more energy into LFP batteries and nearly catch up to the range of NMC batteries. Last year, the Chinese battery giant CATL made the first LFP battery with more than 600 miles of range. Since LFP batteries are made from common materials and last longer, they also have a smaller environmental footprint than NMC batteries. \nFord used LFP batteries in its Mach-E sedan (2023) and F-150 Lightning pickup trucks (2024), according to the article, \"while Rivian began using them in the basic trims of its R1S SUV and R1T pickup truck this year... American LFP factories are slated to open this year in St. Louis and next year in Arizona.\"\nAnd an environmental engineering professor at the University of California at Berkeley predicts LFP battery factories in the U.S. will \"grow quite rapidly over the next five to 10 years.\"","contentLength":3321,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"This Week In Techdirt History: February 16th – 22nd","url":"https://www.techdirt.com/2025/02/22/this-week-in-techdirt-history-february-16th-22nd/","date":1740260700,"author":"Leigh Beadon","guid":9322,"unread":true,"content":"","contentLength":0,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"US AI Safety Institute could face big cuts","url":"https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/22/us-ai-safety-institute-could-face-big-cuts/","date":1740259356,"author":"Anthony Ha","guid":9316,"unread":true,"content":"<p>The National Institute of Standards and Technology could fire as many as 500 staffers, according to multiple reports — cuts that further threaten a fledgling AI safety organization.

That has generally been a problem for the 19 states that have passed broad laws to protect personal information, said Matt Schwartz, a policy analyst for Consumer Reports. He said there has been only 15 or so public enforcement actions by regulators overseeing all those laws. Partly because companies aren't held accountable, they're empowered to ignore the privacy standards. \"Noncompliance is fairly widespread,\" Schwartz said. \"It's a major problem.\" \n\n That's why California is unusual with a data broker law that seems to have teeth. To make sure state residents can order all data brokers operating in the state to delete their personal records [with a single request], California is now requiring brokers to register with the state or face a fine of $200 a day. The state's privacy watchdog said Thursday that it filed litigation to force one data broker, National Public Data, to pay $46,000 for failing to comply with that initial phase of the data broker law. NPD declined to comment through an attorney... This first lawsuit for noncompliance, Schwartz said, shows that California is serious about making companies live up to their privacy obligations... \"If they can successfully build it and show it works, it will create a blueprint for other states interested in this idea,\" he said. \nLast summer NPD \"spilled hundreds of millions of Americans' Social Security Numbers, addresses, and phone numbers online,\" according to the blog Krebs on Security, adding that another NPD data broker sharing access to the same consumer records \"inadvertently published the passwords to its back-end database in a file that was freely available from its homepage...\" \nCalifornia's attempt to regulate the industry inspired the nonprofit Consumer Reports to create an app called Permission Slip that reveals what data companies collect and, for people in U.S. states, will \"work with you to file a request, telling companies to stop selling your personal information.\" \n\nOther data-protecting options suggested by The Washington Post:\n Use Firefox, Brave or DuckDuckGo, \"which can automatically tell websites not to sell or share your data. Those demands from the web browsers are legally binding or will be soon in at least nine states.\"\nUse Privacy Badger, an EFF browser extension which the EFF says \"automatically tells websites not to sell or share your data including where it's required by state law.\"","contentLength":2695,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"ArcaOS (OS/2 Warp OEM) 5.1.1 Has Been Released","url":"https://tech.slashdot.org/story/25/02/22/0748224/arcaos-os2-warp-oem-511-has-been-released?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&utm_medium=feed","date":1740249240,"author":"EditorDavid","guid":9261,"unread":true,"content":"\"IBM stopped supporting OS/2 at the end of 2006,\" write the makers of ArcaOS, an OEM distribution of OS/2's discontinued Warp operating system. \n\nAnd now long-time Slashdot reader martiniturbide tells us that ArcaOS 5.1.1 has been released, and that many of it's components have been updated too.

Wilson cede creative oversight of their family's storied James Bond franchise to Amazon MGM Studios, sources tell us. Amazon originally overpaid on its purchase of MGM in a deal orchestrated by then-MGM board chair Kevin Ulrich. Though valued between $3.5 billion-$4 billion, the legendary motion picture studio was absorbed by the streamer for $8.5 billion, the hefty sum propped up by the potential access of the 007 franchise. However, Amazon couldn't fully freely develop Bond with Broccoli and Wilson in the mix. Hence, it took another $1 billion to ensure that they could fully steer and exploit the Ian Fleming IP. \nThe article suggests Broccoli's long hold-out came from \"Amazon's desire to expand the James Bond franchise into its own universe akin to Marvel or Star Wars.\"\nIn the past, filmmakers including Quentin Tarantino and Christopher Nolan have expressed an interest in putting their stamp on Bond; both however, required complete creative control, which wasn't possible under the reign of Broccoli and Wilson. Now, with the producers on the side, Amazon can move forward to attract a top-tier director. \n\nAlso available to come to life in the new deal finally are a slew of Bond villains and women in their own series or features. The last time an attempt was made to spin off the Bond franchise was in 2003 with a stand-alone movie about the spy's girlfriend Jinx, played by Halle Berry in Die Another Day. Bond scribes Neal Purvis and Rob Wade were attached to pen that, with Stephen Frears circling, but Broccoli and Wilson put the kibosh to the idea due to creative differences. \nIn a related note, the article adds that Amazon \"is looking to have an international theatrical distribution arm fully operational by some time in 2026.\" \n\nJeff Bezos asked his followers on X.com who should play James Bond in the next movie, reports IGN, \"and the answer was loud and clear.\" On X.com the \"clear fan favorite\" was DC Extended Universe actor Henry Cavill. (Besides playing Superman, Cavill also appeared in the 2024 film spy action-comedy Argyle, and fought Tom Cruise's character in 2018's Mission Impossible: Fallout — and played Geralt of Rivia in the Netflix series The Witcher.)","contentLength":2304,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"The HackerNoon Newsletter: The Secret Hidden Power of Questions (2/22/2025)","url":"https://hackernoon.com/2-22-2025-newsletter?source=rss","date":1740240304,"author":"Noonification","guid":9260,"unread":true,"content":"<p>🪐 What’s happening in tech today, February 22, 2025?</p><p>By <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/u/scottdclary\">@scottdclary</a> [ 8 Min read ] Most people are running on default questions they never chose to install. <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/the-secret-hidden-power-of-questions\">Read More.</a></p><p>By <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/u/textmodels\">@textmodels</a> [ 4 Min read ] A smarter way to allocate computing resources in AI transformers is making them faster and more efficient. <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/google-researchers-develop-new-ai-tech-that-doesnt-waste-brainpower-on-useless-words\">Read More.</a></p><p>By <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/u/luminousmen\">@luminousmen</a> [ 3 Min read ] Discover different archetypes of data engineers and how their collaboration drives data-driven success. <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/the-two-types-of-data-engineers-you-meet-at-work\">Read More.</a></p><p>🧑‍💻 What happened in your world this week?</p><p>We hope you enjoy this worth of free reading material.

On February 22, the company unveiled this new platform, touting speeds ten times faster than ChatGPT and positioning OCEAN as a truly transformative solution in both B2C and B2B markets. From blazing response times to a broad feature set that includes voice interaction and a commitment to decentralization, OCEAN represents a major leap forward in how users worldwide can engage with AI.</p><p>\\\nOCEAN’s speed and real-time response capabilities are central to its unique value. Ahmad Shadid, Founder of O and IO, explains that one of the reasons for such swift performance is the adoption of Cerebras’s cutting-edge hardware.</p><p>\\\n\"<em>The Cerebras CS-3 chip, known as the Wafer Scale Engine (WSE-3), has 900,000 AI-optimized cores and four trillion transistors on a single chip. Traditional GPU-based systems often require complex orchestration and distributed programming to handle large models, but the Cerebras approach offers simplicity and scalability.</em>\" – claims Shadid.</p><p>\\\nCerebras can scale from one billion to 24 trillion parameters without requiring code changes, freeing users from the delays commonly associated with AI assistants. With 21 PB/s of memory bandwidth, Cerebras-based processing provides low-latency, high-efficiency performance that far surpasses traditional GPU systems.</p><p>\\\nWhile speed and performance are crucial, OCEAN brings more than just high-octane AI. Shadid refers to OCEAN as “the world’s fastest AI search engine,” emphasizing that beyond raw computational power, the platform delivers a sleek, intuitive user experience. This includes a voice interaction system that will allow users to speak their prompts directly to “Miss O,” who can respond in audio format. This conversational style, along with advanced AI agent capabilities slated for future versions, puts OCEAN on a path that goes beyond just answering text-based queries.</p><p>\\\nFrom a product standpoint, OCEAN adopts a dual approach, serving both individual consumers and enterprises. For users who simply want a next-level AI-powered search engine, the app offers quick responses, privacy-focused features, and a decentralized framework to ensure data security. For business clients, OCEAN plans to roll out an API service powered by the very same Cerebras infrastructure that underpins its consumer operations.</p><p>\\\nThe O community has gained exclusive access to the closed testnet of the OCEAN Assistant, and initial tests  it may run up to 20 times faster than popular AI services like ChatGPT and DeepSeek. X is already flooded with dozens of comparison videos demonstrating the remarkable speed difference, prompting widespread excitement and curiosity about the assistant’s capabilities.</p><p>\\\nIn the next five years, O.XYZ envisions OCEAN becoming a fully integrated platform with advanced routing intelligence. The proprietary “O Routing Intelligence” (ORI), developed by O.RESEARCH, will dynamically route subtasks to the most suitable model, whether it is an open-source option or a specialized AI for more complex requirements. ORI will help optimize costs without compromising speed or accuracy. This first-of-its-kind technology lays the groundwork for building a massive AI library featuring hundreds of thousands of models. Over time, this expansion is expected to bring OCEAN closer to artificial general intelligence (AGI), while still emphasizing security and user data ownership. With ORI, the team presents a unified intelligence technology similar to the one that OpenAI  this February. ORI will select from over 100,000 open-source models, routing tasks to the best one in real time. ORI will be integrated into OCEAN in spring 2025.</p><p>\\\nORI will be the central hub for AI innovation, seamlessly integrating multiple AI models into a unified intelligence. Through its integration with OCEAN, users will effortlessly harness the power of diverse AI models in one place.</p><p> aims to reshape artificial intelligence by developing systems independent of corporate control.

Clary","guid":9258,"unread":true,"content":"<p>We all think we're good at asking questions.</p><p>\\\nIn reality, most of us are terrible at it.</p><p>\\\nNot because we lack curiosity or intelligence, but because we've been trained to focus on answers. School rewards students who memorize facts, not those who challenge assumptions. Work promotes people who execute known solutions, not those who explore unknown possibilities.</p><p>\\\nYet, look at anyone who has achieved extraordinary results in any field. <strong>The difference between good and great isn't in having more answers—it's in asking better questions.</strong></p><p>\\\nWhen Elon Musk questioned why rockets cost so much, he didn't start by studying aerospace engineering. He started by breaking down the raw material costs of rockets and asking why each component was so expensive. This fundamental questioning led to SpaceX revolutionizing the space industry.</p><p>\\\nThe same pattern shows up everywhere. Jeff Bezos asked why people couldn't buy any book they wanted instantly. Steve Jobs asked why computers couldn't be beautiful and intuitive. They didn't begin with solutions. They began with questions that challenged basic assumptions.</p><p>\\\nBut here's what nobody tells you about questions.</p><p>\\\n<em>They're not just tools for learning—they're tools for transformation.</em></p><p>\\\nThe right question can instantly shift your perspective. It can take a problem that seemed impossible and make the solution obvious. It can turn confusion into clarity. Overwhelm into focus. Stagnation into momentum.</p><p>\\\n<strong>The quality of your life is directly proportional to the quality of questions you regularly ask yourself.</strong></p><p>\\\nThink about that for a second.</p><p>\\\nWhat questions do you ask yourself when you wake up? When you face a challenge? When you're stuck? When you're deciding what to do with your time?</p><p>\\\nMost people unconsciously ask questions that keep them trapped. Questions like \"Why is this happening to me?\" or \"What if I fail?\" or \"What will others think?\"</p><p>\\\nThese questions program your brain to look for evidence of problems, failures, and judgments. They create a self-fulfilling prophecy of mediocrity.</p><p>\\\nThe path to extraordinary results starts with extraordinary questions.</p><p>Your mind is running on questions whether you realize it or not.</p><p>\\\nThink of questions as lines of code in your mental software. Some questions create bugs in your thinking. Others unlock new capabilities you didn't know you had.</p><p>\\\n<strong>Most people are running on default questions they never chose to install.</strong></p><p>\\\nThese are the mental programs you inherited from parents, teachers, and society. They might have served a purpose once, but now, they're outdated. Running in the background. Draining your mental energy and limiting your potential.</p><p>\\\nWant to spot the questions running your life? Look at your results.</p><p>\\\nIf you're constantly stressed about money, you might be running questions like \"How can I avoid going broke?\" Instead of \"How can I create more value?\"</p><p>\\\nIf your relationships are unfulfilling, you might be asking \"Why don't people understand me?\" Instead of \"How can I understand others more deeply?\"</p><p>\\\n<em>Questions shape reality by directing your focus.</em></p><p>\\\nWhen you ask better questions, you literally upgrade your mental operating system. Your brain starts noticing opportunities it was blind to before. Solutions appear that were invisible when you were asking surface-level questions.</p><p>\\\nThis isn't just theory. It's how breakthroughs happen.</p><p>\\\nBreaking through plateaus in any area comes down to asking questions nobody else is asking. Questions that challenge core assumptions. Questions that reframe the entire problem.</p><p>\\\n<strong>The gap between 1x and 1000x performance isn't in having more answers. It's in having better questions.</strong></p><p>Let's talk about returns.</p><p>\\\nMost people play small because they ask small questions. They stay stuck at 1x thinking because their questions never challenge their fundamental assumptions about what's possible.</p><p>\\\nThe jump from 1x to 10x starts with questions that break limiting patterns.</p><p>\\\nInstead of asking \"How can I get more clients?\" you ask \"Why do clients need what I'm selling in the first place?\" This simple shift can reveal entire markets you were missing.</p><p>\\\n<em>The 10x to 100x leap happens when your questions reframe the entire game.</em></p><p>\\\nThis is where you stop asking \"How can I be the best player?\" and start asking \"How can I change the rules?\" These questions break you out of competition and into creation.</p><p>\\\n<strong>But the real magic happens in the jump from 100x to 1000x.</strong></p><p>\\\nThis is where Lady Luck enters the picture. But luck isn't random - it's attracted to certain types of questions.</p><p>\\\nQuestions that combine fields nobody has combined before. Questions that challenge assumptions are so basic that nobody sees them as assumptions. Questions that make people uncomfortable because they threaten the status quo.</p><p>\\\nWarren Buffett didn't just ask \"What stocks should I buy?\" He asked, \"What businesses are so fundamental to society that they'll be valuable for the next 50 years?\" This question led him to invest in Coca-Cola, American Express, and other companies that have generated astronomical returns.</p><p>\\\nWhen everyone else is asking \"How can I compete?\" you need to be asking \"What game should I be playing instead?\"</p><p>\\\n<em>The right question doesn't just solve problems - it eliminates them entirely.</em></p><p>Most people think asking better questions is about being smarter.</p><p>\\\nIt's about being more precise.</p><p>\\\n<strong>Vague questions create vague results.</strong> When you ask \"How can I be more successful?\" your brain has nothing concrete to work with. It's like trying to build a house without blueprints.</p><p>\\\nBut ask \"What specific skills would make me irreplaceable in my industry?\" and your mind immediately starts generating actionable insights.</p><p>\\\nThis is the art of question architecture.</p><p>\\\nStart with \"what\" instead of \"why.\" \"Why\" questions often lead to rationalizations and excuses. \"What\" questions lead to observations and actions.</p><p>\\\n\"Why am I stuck?\" becomes \"What small step would create momentum?\" \"Why don't I have enough time?\" becomes \"What am I currently spending time on that doesn't serve my goals?\"</p><p>\\\n<em>The more specific your question, the more useful the answer.</em></p><p>\\\nYour internal dialogue is just a series of questions and answers. Most people let this run on autopilot. But when you consciously architect your questions, you transform your mental landscape.</p><p>\\\nThink of questions as doorways. A poorly designed doorway leads to a closet. A well-designed doorway opens into a universe of possibilities.</p><p>\\\n<strong>The goal isn't to find the one perfect question. It's to develop a framework for generating better questions.</strong></p><p>\\\nThis is how you turn confusion into clarity. Overwhelm into action. Stagnation into progress.</p><p>\\\nMaster learners don't just ask better questions. They have a system for generating them.</p><p>\\\nFirst, they recognize that timing matters. <strong>There's a massive difference between asking questions to understand and asking questions to act.</strong></p><p>\\\nUnderstanding questions open up possibilities. Action questions narrow them down.</p><p>\\\nWhen you're exploring a new field, you want broad questions that challenge basic assumptions. \"What if everything I know about this is wrong?\" This creates space for genuine insight.</p><p>\\\nBut when it's time to execute, you need focused questions that drive specific outcomes. \"What's the smallest step I can take right now that makes all other steps easier?\"</p><p>\\\n<em>The key is knowing which mode you're in.</em></p><p>\\\nMost people get stuck because they ask action questions during exploration mode, or exploration questions during action mode. They try to optimize before they understand. Or they keep exploring when they should be executing.</p><p>\\\nMaster learners also build a question database. They collect powerful questions like others collect answers.</p><p>\\\n\"What would this look like if it were easy?\" \"What am I not seeing?\" \"What would I do if I knew I couldn't fail?\"</p><p>\\\nThese aren't just motivational quotes. They're mental tools that break you out of limited thinking patterns.</p><p>\\\n<strong>But the real power comes from creating your own questions.</strong></p><p>\\\nQuestions that address your specific blindspots. Questions that challenge your deepest assumptions. Questions that force you to think in new ways.</p><p>Here's what most people miss about questions.</p><p>\\\nThey're not just tools for solving problems. They're tools for living.</p><p>\\\n<strong>Questions determine how you experience reality itself.</strong></p><p>\\\nWhen you ask \"What's wrong with my life?\" you'll find endless problems. When you ask \"What's working in my life?\" you'll find endless opportunities. Both questions reveal truth, but they reveal different truths.</p><p>\\\nThis isn't positive thinking. It's about understanding how your mind constructs reality.</p><p>\\\nEvery answer closes doors. It settles something. Finalizes it. Puts it in a box. But . They create possibilities that didn't exist before.</p><p>\\\nSmart people often fall into the trap of being \"answer-oriented.\" They pride themselves on knowing things. On being right. On having it figured out.</p><p>\\\nBut wisdom comes from maintaining a state of question.</p><p>\\\nThink about it. The most profound experiences in life don't come from finding answers. They come from encountering better questions.</p><p>\\\nQuestions that make you reevaluate everything. Questions that expand your sense of what's possible. Questions that connect you to something larger than yourself.</p><p>\\\n<strong>The goal isn't to eliminate uncertainty. It's to get better at dancing with it.</strong></p><p>\\\nLife becomes more interesting when you stop demanding answers and start embracing questions. When you stop trying to be certain and start getting curious.</p><p>You're probably wondering what to do with all this.</p><p>\\\nTake the questions you ask yourself every day and upgrade them. Don't try to force massive changes. Just make them slightly better.</p><p>\\\n<strong>Small shifts in your questions create massive shifts in your life.</strong></p><p>\\\nInstead of asking \"What do I have to do today?\" ask \"What's the most important thing I could accomplish today?\"</p><p>\\\nPay attention to warning signs of poor questions. When you feel stuck, stressed, or overwhelmed, pause and notice what questions are</p><p>running through your mind.</p><p>\\\nAre they empowering or limiting? Are they specific or vague? Are they opening new possibilities or closing them off?</p><p>\\\n<em>The beauty of questions is that you can change them instantly.</em></p><p>\\\nYour brain is like a search engine. It will find answers to whatever questions you feed it.

I’m speaking, of course, about hot Jupiters, a class of planets that takes the concept of “inhospitable” to dazzling and creative new levels, and which had an epic news week.</p><p>Then, what did scientists find in cores taken from deep-sea trenches? The answer might surprise you. Next, mice administer “first aid.” Last, fish can see you for who you really are (though yummy treats will certainly not be refused).&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Hot Jupiters Are So Hot Right Now (and at All Other Times)</strong></p><p>Hot Jupiters are the low-hanging fruit of exoplanet discoveries. As the name implies, they are Jupiter-sized worlds that orbit extremely close to their stars, a proximity that makes them—you guessed it—hot.&nbsp;</p><p>Given that they are both giant in scale and have short years lasting only hours or days, hot Jupiters are the easiest exoplanets to spot, which is why our catalog of distant worlds is packed with them. In fact, a study came out <a href=\"https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/full_html/2025/02/aa51693-24/aa51693-24.html?ref=404media.co\"></a> that identified seven new ones.</p><p>But while it’s not all that novel to discover these worlds (which is kind of amazing in itself), scientists have now peered deep into the atmosphere of the hot Jupiter WASP-121, nicknamed Tylos, which is about 850 light years from Earth. It’s the first time several distinct atmospheric layers and processes have been observed on an exoplanet.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>“Ultra-hot Jupiters, an extreme class of planets not found in our solar system, provide a unique window into atmospheric processes,” said researchers led by Julia Seidel of the European Southern Observatory (ESO). “Here we show a dramatic shift in atmospheric circulation in an ultra-hot Jupiter” including “the first vertical characterization of a high-altitude, super-rotational atmospheric jet stream.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Tylos is slightly bigger than Jupiter, but it is so close to its star that its year lasts only 30 hours. As a consequence, it is tidally locked, meaning that one side is always facing the star, and the other always faces away. The star-lit side is about 2,300°C (4,200°F) which is, as advertised, quite hot. Using the ESO’s Very Large Telescope, the researchers spotted the aforementioned equatorial jet stream and saw flows of hot gas moving from the hot day side to the cooler night side—which is still pretty hot at around 700°C (1,340°F).&nbsp;</p><p>The weather report on Tylos is permanently fatal with a chance of titanium rain, according to a third <a href=\"https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/full_html/2025/02/aa52405-24/aa52405-24.html?ref=404media.co\"><u>study that came out this week</u></a> (that’s a hot Jupiter hat-trick). Taken together, the research represents a new emerging era of exoplanet observations in which astronomers can peek under the hood of these distant atmospheres and start to get a real vertical cross-section of otherworldly skies.&nbsp;</p><p>Down the line, this will lead to better characterizations of the atmospheres of potentially habitable exoplanets, which could contain detectable signs of alien life. But for now, on this late winter weekend, let's be satisfied with warming ourselves&nbsp; into certain oblivion in the bellies of hot Jupiters.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>From the Hadal to the Grave&nbsp;</strong></p><p>To cool off, we shall now dive straight into the deepest parts of the ocean, the hadal zone, where strange things are inherently afoot. Scientists took sediment cores from seafloors at depths of over 4.6 miles in the Japan Trench which is, in my opinion, asking for trouble. But in this case, the results revealed an activity that you might not expect to find in one of the most inhospitable places on Earth—farming.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>I should just say, the “farmers” are probably invertebrates, like sea cucumbers or bivalves, that cultivate microbes that help break down organic matter for them. Still, a basic form of “agrichnial” farming is preserved in trace fossils, like burrows, the team found in the cores.&nbsp;</p><p>“The hadal zone, &gt;6 km deep, remains one of the least understood ecosystems on Earth,” said researchers led by Jussi Hovikoski of the Geological Survey of Finland. The cores open a rare window into this otherworldly region and reveal “slender spiral, lobate and deeply penetrating straight and ramifying burrow systems…interpreted to include burrows of microbe farming and chemosymbiotic invertebrates.”&nbsp;</p><p>The study also gets points for its title, “Bioturbation in the hadal zone,” which sounds like an early aughts prog rock album. \\m/&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Somebody Call an EMT! (Emergency Mouse Technician)</strong></p><p>Humans produce a lot of selfish psychos, if you hadn’t noticed, but one nice thing about our species is we generally share a prosocial instinct to help people during a medical crisis. As it turns out, we’re not alone in this behavior, according to a new study that monitored the reactions of mice to ailing, unconscious, or dead conspecifics.&nbsp;</p><p>“Anecdotal observations across several species in the wild, including nonhuman primates, dolphins, and elephants have reported intriguing behaviors of animals toward unresponsive conspecifics that have collapsed because of sickness, injury, or death,” said researchers led by&nbsp; Wenjian Sun of the University of Southern California. “These animals…display various behavioral responses, including touching, grooming, nudging, and sometimes even more intense physical actions, such as striking, toward the collapsed peers. Some of these actions toward incapacitated conspecifics are reminiscent of human emergency responses, especially those involving sensory stimulation.”</p><p>To bring these anecdotal reports in an experimental setting, the team videotaped mice responding to cagemates that had been anesthetized into unconsciousness, as well as their reactions&nbsp; to dead mice. The r mice interacted with unconscious cage-mates&nbsp; about ten times as much as with an active partner, and may have even performed basic versions of first aid.</p><p>“Our results suggest that the actions of mouth/ tongue biting and tongue pulling may have rescue-like effects, reminiscent of human first aid efforts in reviving unconscious individuals with physical stimulation and airway maintenance,” the researchers said.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>“The consequences of the behaviors, such as improved airway opening or clearance and expedited recovery, are clearly beneficial to the recipient,” they added, though they also cautioned that “it is challenging to determine the motivational needs behind these distinctive ‘reviving-like’ behaviors.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Familiarity played a strong role in the experiment's outcome; mice heaped much more attention on dead or unconscious cage-mates that they knew well compared to strangers. At the risk of anthropomorphizing, it’s kind of sad to think about these mice being confronted with their passed-out or dead friends, but the silver lining is an empirical validation of widespread prosocial behaviors.&nbsp;</p><p>I’m also going to assume it means that the Disney franchise , starring mice humanitarians, is a documentary.</p><p><strong>The Adventures of Left Hump and Friends</strong></p><p>The next time you go for an ocean swim, why not introduce yourself to some neighboring fish? They might learn to recognize you as an individual and start following you around, especially if you give them something nice to eat. That’s the conclusion of a new study that found fish can tell individual divers apart based on visual cues—and that they rapidly learn which divers are generous with treats (in this case: shrimp).</p><p>Researchers Maëlan Tomasek and Katinka Soller conducted several dives at the STARESO research station in Corsica, France. Soller was the designated shrimp dispenser, and the wild fish “volunteers” rapidly learned to distinguish her visually from Tomasek, the shrimp miser.</p><p>“Two species voluntarily took part in our experiments: saddled sea bream and black sea bream ,” said the researchers. “Of specific individuals, the saddled bream (Bernie) was first identified at dive 5 of the training, four black bream at dives 12 (Left Hump), 15 (Kasi), 19 (Alfi), 21 (Julius) and the last black bream (Geraldine) on the first session of experiment 1. Note that this marks the moment from which we were able to reliably identify them (i.e. identify with absolute certainty at each apparition from one dive to the next) but that they most likely appeared several days prior to this.”</p><p>First of all, fantastic names. I’m already shipping Julius and Geraldine as a celebrity fish couple called Juladine. Left Hump will officiate the wedding. But setting aside the fish fanfic, the team demonstrated that the fish learned to visually tell the researchers apart, leading to a clear preference for following Soller.&nbsp;</p><p>“The fact that wild bream can discriminate between divers adds scientific evidence to the numerous accounts suggesting differentiated relationships between fish and specific humans,” the team said. “Our study thus encourages a reappraisal of the methodological avenues to study cognitive abilities of wild fish under natural conditions.”&nbsp;</p><p>“It also demonstrates a potential difficulty when conducting such experiments that could be disturbed by fish following specific experimenters,” the researchers said, concluding with an implied wink: “Researchers might not always want to be followed all around by fish, but if they do, they will not be disappointed.”</p><p>Thanks for reading!

Mixture-of-Depths-and-Experts (MoDE)</li></ul><p>Mixture-of-Depths transformers empirically demonstrate that one can improve on isoFLOP-optimal baseline performance with models that use fewer FLOPs per forward pass. This means that—for a given training FLOP budget—we can train models that are both faster and better performing than their baseline counterparts. Previously, to train models that are both faster and as- or better-performing than isoFLOP-optimal models, one would have to use surplus compute to overtrain smaller models (notably, this overtraining technique is still possible with MoD transformers, and speed gains should compound).</p><p>\\\nWhile MoD transformers require fewer FLOPs per forward pass, one cannot forego FLOPs indiscriminately. Rather, it is crucial to use learned routing decisions—much like in Mixture-of-Experts transformers—to determine whether a token should participate in self-attention and the subsequent MLP (requiring FLOPs), or not (saving FLOPs).We can then use any saved FLOPs by, for example, making the model bigger or training it for longer. Our results show that indeed FLOPs may be inefficiently used in vanilla transformer models, and that there may be more efficient ways for them to be expended.</p><p>\\\nLearned routing mechanisms are sometimes non-causal; that is, information about the future is used to determine a given token’s routing decision. This is generally true for top-k routing mechanisms, which are useful because they forego the need for auxiliary balancing losses. However, top-k routing mechanisms present difficulties in post-training autoregressive sampling, where it is impossible to use information about future token identities to determine routing decisions. In this work we show that one can successfully use a top-k routing scheme during training, but not require it during later autoregressive sampling. Eiher a simple auxiliary classifier, or auxiliary loss on the router, is sufficient to learn the top-𝑘 routing decisions such that it can mimic the top-𝑘 decisions during autoregressive</p><p>\\\nsampling, with minimal to no performance degradation.</p><p>\\\nIntuitively, a token might learn to route around blocks because the prediction being made at that step is easier, and hence, does not require as much compute. However, this strategy is undoubtedly not all that the network learns. If a token does not participate in self-attention at a certain block, then later tokens will also not be able to attend to it. Thus, whether tokens decide to route or not impacts both the current step’s prediction and future predictions via causal self-attention, and how the network balances these effects is guided by their influence on the overall language modeling objective.</p><p>\\\nThis insight opens the door to MoD variants that decouple the routing for queries, keys and values. For example, perhaps a token would prefer to be among the queries, but not the keys, for a given self-attention computation. One can imagine extending this idea even further into the domain of \"long-term memory\": perhaps there are tokens that would be extremely valuable as keys, regardless of whether it is useful for them to also be among the queries at the step of their occurrence. Learned routing could be a powerful mechanism for deciding which tokens these might be, perhaps funnelling them into a long-term memory buffer that is available during future self-attention. One advantage of such an approach to long-term memory is that tokens decide once, at the moment of \"memory encoding\", whether they should be retrieved in the future. This is more computationally efficient than performing a full content-based lookup across an entire memory buffer for each step in the future, and could be one step towards drastically increasing the context-length available for making a prediction.</p><p>\\\nUnlike MoE transformers that route between effectively the same computation (usually MLPs), MoD transformers demonstrate the value of routing among different types of computations. In this work the types were either the conventional transformer block, or a null computation (functionally equivalent to multiplying by zero). However, one can imagine extending this idea further by routing between even more types of computation. For example, perhaps some tokens are routed to \"memory lookup\" functions, and others are routed to \"tool use\" functions. In general, the routing machinery we deployed provides a knob for adjusting the types of computations available to the network and their relative cost (in total FLOPs); if one wants to introduce an expensive computation, then this can be offset by setting its capacity to some small amount, and hence, by routing only a small number of tokens to it.</p><p>\\\nAltogether, MoD transformers are another tool one can use to tune a model’s compute per forward pass (and hence inference time). The machinery used to implement MoD is also generic, and opens the doors to many extensions and integration with other techniques, such as MoE.</p><p>J. Ainslie, T. Lei, M. de Jong, S. Ontañón, S.

In general, we found that MoD transformers drag the baseline isoFLOP curve \"down and to the right\". That is, the optimal MoD transformer achieves a lower loss than the optimal baseline, and also has more parameters. A fortunate consequence of this effect is that there exist smaller MoD models that, while they are not themselves isoFLOP optimal for their hyperparameter setting, are nevertheless as- or better-performing than the optimal baseline model while being faster to step. For example, a 220M parameter MoD (figure 3 model #3) variant slightly outperforms the isoFLOP optimal baseline (also 220M, figure 3 model #1), but is upwards of 60% faster to step during training. Crucially, when run on equivalent hardware these two model variants take take approximately the same amount of wall-clock time to train (figure 3).</p><p>\\\nWe tested routing every block or every other block, using capacities from 12.5% to 95% of the total sequence. While routing every other block was crucial for strong performance, we found that aggressive capacity reduction was best (gradual improvements were observed when reducing the capacity down to 12.5% of the total sequence, corresponding to 87.5% of tokens routing around blocks, with performance degrading beyond this point). So, it seems the network is robust to significant capacity reductions as long as there is frequent opportunity for full capacity self-attention and MLP computations.</p><p>\\\nLearned routing is crucial, as MoD transformers that use stochastic routing (implemented using a top-𝑘 operation on router weights sampled from a Gaussian distribution) perform drastically worse than both the baseline and normal MoD transformer (figure 3).</p><p>\\\nDepicted in figure 4 is an isoFLOP analysis for 6e18, 2e19, and 1e20 total FLOPs. The trend that FLOP-optimal MoD transformers have more parameters than the baseline continues for these larger FLOP budgets. Notably, there exist MoD variants that are appreciably faster to step than the isoFLOP-optimal baseline (measured as steps per second when training on equivalent hardware) while also achieving a lower loss (in figure 4 we depict normalized FLOPs per forward pass rather than wall-clock step time per se, but from our experiments the two are tightly correlated. A similar plot can be produced showing relative wall-clock step times and the same basic trend is present).</p><p>\\\nStep-wise speed gains come from two sources. First, the FLOP-per-parameter ratio in MoD transformers is less than in the baselines because some proportion of tokens are routed around blocks. So, for a given model size, a transformer requires fewer FLOPs per forward pass. Second, since isoFLOP-optimal MoD transformers are both bigger and achieve a lower loss than the isoFLOP-optimal baseline, there exist smaller MoD variants that perform as well or better than the isoFLOP-optimal baseline, and these variants are faster to step because they are smaller. Altogether, then, there exist MoD transformers that perform as well as isoFLOP-optimal baselines and are faster to step, both because they use fewer FLOPs per parameter and because they use fewer parameters.</p><p>\\\n\\\nFigure 4 also reveals another important finding: the optimal MoD transformer is that which uses as many FLOPs per forward pass as the isoFLOP optimal baseline. This finding allows one to directly predict which sized MoD transformer will perform optimally for a given isoFLOP training budget: one just needs to tune the model size for a given MoD configuration (i.e., capacity and routing frequency) to produce a model that uses as many FLOPs per forward pass as the isoFLOP-optimal baseline, and they will have the optimally performing MoD variant for that configuration. Empirically, we find that it is better to add depth than to add width when adding FLOPs to the model.</p><p>\\\nNevertheless, while the FLOPs per forward pass determines which model will be the isoFLOP optimal, it does not predict whether the optimal loss will improve upon the baseline (see figure 3. Namely, the optimal capacity appears to be empirically determinable. We found that it is best to use 12.5% capacity blocks, every other block.</p><p>\\\nWe noticed that MoD transformers had memory savings relative to equivalently sized baseline models at larger sizes, with some variants requiring fewer total devices (i.e., a smaller TPU topology). We did not study this extensively, but we anticipate that as one scales to larger models, these savings could be an important consideration when choosing model variants to train, and could have significant positive effects in regards to the KV cache size during autoregressive sampling.</p><p>\\\nFigure 5 shows the routing decisions for an MoD transformer trained with interleaved routing blocks. Despite aggressive routing around the blocks, transformers are able to achieve performance improvements relative to baselines. We observe patterns that might warrant further study; namely, some tokens appear to engage each block along the transformer’s depth, while others decide to route around blocks whenever possible. Preliminary analyses suggest that the tokens that engage with blocks more frequently are correlated with output predictions that have higher entropy, which possibly corresponds to predictions that are more difficult to make.</p><h2>4.2. Auto-regressive Evaluation</h2><p>We evaluated MoD variants during auto-regressive sampling (see figure 6). Each model was tested on exactly the same held-out data comprising 256000 sequences (500M tokens). When switching from the top-𝑘 routing method to the predictor-based routing method we observed little performance degradation. As in the training setting, there exist MoD variants that are better performing than the isoFLOP-optimal baseline, while requiring fewer FLOPs per forward pass. These results suggest that the compute savings offered by MoD transformers should translate beyond the training setting.</p><h3>4.3. Mixture-of-Depths-and-Experts (MoDE)</h3><p>The MoD technique can be naturally integrated with MoE models (together comprising MoDE models) in addition to vanilla transformers. In figure 7 we present results showing that the performance improvments offered by MoD compound with those of MoE. We tried two variants: in staged MoDE, which routes tokens around or towards blocks prior to the self-attention step, and integrated MoDE, which implements MoD routing by integrating “no-op” experts among the conventional MLP experts. The former is advantageous because it allows for tokens to skip the self-attention step, while the latter is advantageous because it simplifies the routing machinery. We noticed that implementing MoDE in the integrated manner was distinctly better than simply reducing the capacity of experts in conventional MoE models, and relying on token dropping to implement residual routing. We believe this is because with the integrated MoDE machinery, tokens explicitly learn to choose the residual path around the experts, as opposed to preferring an expert but being dropped when implemented as a capacity reduction.</p>","contentLength":7900,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Niri 25.02 & Labwc 0.8.3 Wayland Compositors Released","url":"https://www.phoronix.com/news/Niri-25.02-Labwc-0.8.3","date":1740224499,"author":"Michael Larabel","guid":9083,"unread":true,"content":"<article>The Niri and Labwc Wayland compositor projects are both out with new releases this weekend to further their efforts...</article>","contentLength":118,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"This Clever AI Hack Could Cut Processing Costs in Half","url":"https://hackernoon.com/this-clever-ai-hack-could-cut-processing-costs-in-half?source=rss","date":1740223803,"author":"Writings, Papers and Blogs on Text Models","guid":9255,"unread":true,"content":"<p>(1) David Raposo, Google DeepMind and with equal contribution;</p><p>(2) Sam Ritter, Google DeepMind;</p><p>(3) Blake Richards, Google DeepMind and McGill University &amp; Mila;</p><p>(4) Timothy Lillicrap, Google DeepMind;</p><p>(5) Peter Conway Humphreys, Google DeepMind;</p><p>(6) Adam Santoro, Google DeepMind and with equal contribution.</p><p>:::tip\n<strong><em>Editor's note: this is part 3 of 5 of a study detailing a way to make transformer-based language models more efficient by dynamically allocating computational resources.

Mixture-of-Depths-and-Experts (MoDE)</li></ul><p>Our high-level strategy is as follows:</p><p>\\\n• Set a static compute budget that is less than that of an equivalent vanilla transformer by limiting the number of tokens in a sequence that can participate in a block’s computations (i.e., selfattention and subsequent MLP). For example, while a vanilla transformer might permit all the tokens in a sequence to participate in self-attention, we might limit the number to 50% of the tokens in a sequence. See section 3.1.</p><p>\\\n• Use a per-block router to emit a scalar weight for each token, which expresses the router’s preference for that token to participate in a block’s computations or to route around it. See section 3.2.</p><p>\\\n• Identify the top-𝑘 scalar weights (per sequence, per block) to select those tokens that will participate in a block’s computations. Since precisely 𝑘 tokens will participate in the block’s computations, the computation graph and tensor sizes remain static throughout training; it is merely the tokens’ participation that is dynamic and context-sensitive, as determined by the router. See section 3.3.</p><p>\\\nWe then discuss some complications when sampling post-training in section 3.5.</p><p>To enforce a total compute budget per forward pass we leverage the notion of , which defines the total number of tokens that comprise the input to a given computation (e.g., the tokens participating in self-attention, a given expert in MoE transformers, etc). For example, the self-attention and MLP in each vanilla transformer block have a capacity of 𝑇—the total number of tokens across the sequence and batch. MoE transformers, on the other hand, use a capacity less than 𝑇 per expert MLP so as to more evenly divide the total compute across each expert. But, since they use multiple experts per block, their total capacity is approximately equal to that of a vanilla transformer.</p><p>\\\nGenerally, it is the token capacity that determines the total FLOPs for transformers that use conditional computation, rather than the outcomes of any routing decisions. This is because staticgraph implementations account for the worst-case scenarios decisions; e.g., a computation’s inputs will be padded to its capacity amount even if relatively few tokens actually end up routing to it, and/or tokens will be dropped from the computation if the capacity is exceeded.</p><p>\\\nWe can achieve our goal of using a smaller compute budget per forward pass compared to a vanilla transformer by lowering the capacity of the computations. However, using a smaller compute budget haphazardly will result in a performance degradation. We hypothesize that certain tokens might not require as much processing as others, and these tokens can be identified through learning. Therefore, if the network learns to choose the right tokens to fill up its capacities, then it may preserve its performance. In the following we describe routing schemes that can be used for this purpose.</p><p>We consider the setting whereby we route tokens to one of two computational paths: (1) self-attention and MLP blocks, and (2) a residual connection. The latter is computationally cheap, and results in a block output that is entirely determined by the value of its input. The former path is computationally expensive.</p><p>\\\n\\\n\\\nIntuitively, the total FLOPs per forward pass decreases (and the time to complete a forward pass decreases) in proportion to how aggressively we shrink the blocks’ capacities. However, downstream performance will also be affected by how aggressively we shrink the blocks capacities, and by the routing algorithm we implement.</p><p>\\\nAt one extreme, if we leave each block’s capacity at 𝑇 and route every token to (rather than around) each block, then we recover a vanilla transformer. At the other extreme, if we set each block’s capacity to 0 and route all tokens around each block, then we’re left with a very fast model that doesn’t engage with the vast majority of the transformer’s parameters, and undoubtedly has poor downstream performance. We hypothesize that somewhere between these two extremes is an optimal model that is faster than a vanilla Transformer and performs as well, if not better, all while being faster to step.</p><p>Naively, one can leverage stochasticity to route tokens, akin to layer or block “dropout”. We present this routing scheme as a control, and will show that it significantly under-performs relative to vanilla transformers.</p><p>\\\nWe hypothesize that learned routing is preferable. Intuitively, the network should be able to learn which tokens require more or less processing than others. If we are correct that Transformers often expend more compute than they need to make their predictions, then it is an empirical question as to how aggressively we can shrink each block’s capacity, and hence, how many tokens we can afford to route around each block.</p><p>\\\nThere are two learned routing schemes we consider (see figure 2): token-choice and expert-choice. In token-choice routing, a router produces per-token probability distributions across computational paths (e.g., across expert identities in MoE Transformers). Tokens are then shuttled to the path they prefer—i.e., that with the highest probability—and auxiliary losses ensure that all tokens don’t converge to the same path. Token-choice routing can have load balancing problems since there isn’t a guarantee that tokens divide themselves appropriately between the possible paths. “Expert choice routing” flips this recipe on its head: rather than having tokens choose the path they prefer, each path instead chooses the top-𝑘 tokens based on the tokens’ preferences. This ensures a perfect load balance since 𝑘 tokens are guaranteed to be shuttled to each path. However, it could result in over- or under-processing of some tokens, since some tokens may be among the top-𝑘 for multiple paths, or for none of them.</p><p>\\\nWe decided to leverage expert-choice routing for a few reasons. First, it obviates the need for an auxiliary balancing loss. Second, since the top-𝑘 operation depends on the magnitude of the router weights, this routing scheme allows for relative routing weights to help determine which tokens most need the block’s computations; routers can try to ensure that the most critical tokens are among the top-𝑘 by setting their weight appropriately, which is not possible with token-choice routing schemes. For our specific use-case, wherein one computational path is essentially a null operation, it might be critical that important tokens are routed away from the null operation. Third, because we only route through two paths, a single top-𝑘 operation can efficiently split the tokens into two mutually exclusive sets, one for each computational path, preventing the over- or under-processing problem mentioned above.</p><h2>3.4. Routing implementation</h2><p>As a reminder of the high-level intuition, each token is processed by a router to produce a scalar weight, and the top-𝑘 weights are then used to choose the token identities that will route through a transformer’s block, which comprises self-attention and the subsequent MLP.</p><p>\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\nNotably, we multiply the output of the function 𝑓 by the router weights. This puts the router weights along the “gradient path”, thus subjecting them to the forces of gradient descent through the course of the language modeling task (We experimented with versions where the router weights are also included along the computational path for those tokens that bypass the block’s computations, but it seems to be sufficient—and implementationally simpler—to only include the router weights along the computational path for those tokens that do not bypass the block’s computations).</p><p>While expert-choice routing has a number of advantages, it has one distinct problem: the top-𝑘 operation is non-causal. This means that whether a given token’s routing weight is among the top-𝑘 for the sequence depends on the values of the routing weights for tokens that come after it, which we don’t have access to when autoregressively sampling.</p><p>\\\nWe tested two methods to work around this problem. The first introduces a simple auxiliary loss that empirically affects the primary language modeling objective by approximately 0.2 − 0.3%, but allows us to sample from the model autoregressively. We use a binary cross-entropy loss wherein the router’s outputs provide the logits, and the top-𝑘 selections of these logits provide the targets (i.e. 1 if a token was among the top-𝑘, and 0 if not). Intuitively, this loss centers the sigmoid of the router’s outputs around 0.5; those tokens that are selected among the top-k are pressured to produce router outputs above 0.5, and those not among the top-k will be pressured to produce router outputs below 0.5. The second method introduces a small auxiliary MLP predictor (akin to a second router) that receives the same inputs as the router (with a stop gradient), but whose output is a prediction whether that token will be among the top-𝑘 or not in the sequence. This method does not affect the language modeling objective, and empirically does not significantly impact the step speed.</p><p>\\\nEquipped with these new methods, we can sample autoregressively by choosing to route tokens to or around a block based on the router’s output, which does not depend on any information from future tokens. We provide empirical evidence that this is a relatively easy auxiliary task that quickly achieves 99% accuracy.</p><p>All models use the same basic hyperparameter configurations (e.g. cosine schedules equal to 1× the training steps, 128 batch size, 2048 sequence length) except for changes to the number of layers, heads, and embedding size to produce differently sized models during isoFLOP analyses.</p>","contentLength":10529,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"KDE Plasma 6.4 Preps Improvement To Help KWin Reduce Frame Drops","url":"https://www.phoronix.com/news/Plasma-6.4-Less-KWin-Frame-Drop","date":1740223703,"author":"Michael Larabel","guid":9082,"unread":true,"content":"<article>In addition to this week's release of Plasma 6.3.1, KDE developers have been busy preparing more bug fixes for what will become Plasma 6.3.2 next month.

This has spurred tremendous interest in making transformer architectures more efficient (Gupta and Agrawal, 2021; Tay et al., 2020). One of the promising approaches is conditional computation, whereby learned mechanisms determine when and how to expend computation. This terminology was introduced by Bengio (2013), and the concept was explored further over the next several years (Bengio et al., 2016, 2013; Cho and Bengio, 2014; Graves, 2016; Jernite et al., 2017; Wang et al., 2017).</p><p>\\\nA wide variety of recent work has developed conditional computation methods for transformers. Some of this work focuses on \"early exiting\", that is, learning to decide when to end computation on a given token, allowing the token to skip any remaining transformer layers after the exit decision is made (Elbayad et al., 2019; Liu et al., 2021; Schuster et al., 2022). In MoD, unlike in early-exit methods, a token can skip middle layers, then be updated via self-attention with tokens that that have gone through all the middle layers. We speculate that this might be a useful property.</p><p>\\\nOther work has developed methods for iterating transformer layers with shared weights for an adaptive number of steps (Dehghani et al., 2018; Simoulin and Crabbé, 2021). Bolya et al. (2023) developed a method for choosing tokens to merge when running inference on a trained vision transformer which notably requires no learning. Lei et al. (2023) make use of conditional computation in a fine tuning setting by building on adapter approaches (He et al., 2021) to learn to skip blocks of frozen pre-trained weights in favor of running only a small fine-tuned adapter.</p><p>\\\nCoLT5 (Ainslie et al., 2023) uses conditional routing to select whether a given token will pass through a heavy or light pathway for each feedforward layer. Further, they use the same routing mechanism to select whether a token will attend to all other tokens or to a select few, as in Guo et al. (2022). Like MoD, CoLT5 uses soft top-k for making routing decisions. However, CoLT5 focuses on a encoder-decoder setting, and thus does need to contend with the problem of efficient sequential decoding given the non-causal nature of the top-k operation. In contrast, our current work with</p><p>\\\nMoD focuses on the decoder-only setting, and so we propose a predictive router to enable efficient inference for conditional computation in transformers.</p><p>\\\nOne successful formulation of conditional computation is the the \"mixture-of-experts\" layer (MoE) as introduced by Shazeer et al. (2017). Developed initially in the context of LSTMs, later work showed compelling empirical results for MoE with transformers (Fedus et al., 2022; Lepikhin et al., 2020; Zoph et al., 2022). Unlike other conditional computation approaches that try to conserve or expend additional compute, MoE transformers use conditional logic to route tokens to one of many expert MLPs while keeping total compute expenditure constant. Our mixture-of-depths method can be thought of as using the routing logic from MoE transformers, but rather than having multiple experts, MoD deploys a single expert which can be dynamically skipped.</p>","contentLength":4090,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Google Researchers Develop New AI Tech That Doesn't Waste Brainpower on Useless Words","url":"https://hackernoon.com/google-researchers-develop-new-ai-tech-that-doesnt-waste-brainpower-on-useless-words?source=rss","date":1740222006,"author":"Writings, Papers and Blogs on Text Models","guid":9110,"unread":true,"content":"<p>(1) David Raposo, Google DeepMind and with equal contribution;</p><p>(2) Sam Ritter, Google DeepMind;</p><p>(3) Blake Richards, Google DeepMind and McGill University &amp; Mila;</p><p>(4) Timothy Lillicrap, Google DeepMind;</p><p>(5) Peter Conway Humphreys, Google DeepMind;</p><p>(6) Adam Santoro, Google DeepMind and with equal contribution.</p><p>:::tip\n<strong><em>Editor's note: this is part 1 of 5 of a study detailing a way to make transformer-based language models more efficient by dynamically allocating computational resources.

In this work we demonstrate that transformers can instead learn to dynamically allocate FLOPs (or compute) to specific positions in a sequence, optimising the allocation along the sequence for different layers across the model depth. Our method enforces a total compute budget by capping the number of tokens (𝑘) that can participate in the self-attention and MLP computations at a given layer. The tokens to be processed are determined by the network using a top-𝑘 routing mechanism. Since 𝑘 is defined a priori, this simple procedure uses a static computation graph with known tensor sizes, unlike other conditional computation techniques. Nevertheless, since the identities of the 𝑘 tokens are fluid, this method can expend FLOPs non-uniformly across the time and model depth dimensions. Thus, compute expenditure is entirely predictable in sum total, but dynamic and context-sensitive at the token-level. Not only do models trained in this way learn to dynamically allocate compute, they do so efficiently. These models match baseline performance for equivalent FLOPS and wall-clock times to train, but require a fraction of the FLOPs per forward pass, and can be upwards of 50% faster to step during post-training sampling.</strong></p><p>Not all problems require the same amount of time or effort to solve. Analogously, in language modeling not all tokens and sequences require the same time or effort to accurately make a prediction. And yet, transformer models expend the same amount of compute per token in a forward pass. Ideally, transformers would use smaller total compute budgets by not spending compute unnecessarily.</p><p>\\\nConditional computation is a technique that tries to reduce total compute by expending it only when needed (Bengio et al., 2016; Bengio, 2013; Bengio et al., 2013). Various algorithms offer solutions to when and how much compute should be used (Ainslie et al., 2023; Bapna et al., 2020; Fedus et al., 2022). However, general formulations of this challenging problem may not work well with existing hardware constraints since they tend to introduce dynamic computation graphs (Dehghani et al., 2018; Graves, 2016). The most promising conditional computation methods may instead be those that are harmonious with our current hardware stack, which prioritizes static computation graphs, and known tensor sizes that are selected to maximize hardware utilization.</p><p>\\\nHere we consider the problem of language modeling using a static compute budget that can be made less than that used by a vanilla transformer. The network must learn how to dynamically allocate the available compute by making decisions per-token, in each layer, about where to spend compute from the available budget. In our implementation total compute is user defined and unchanging prior to training, rather than being a function of the network’s on-the-fly decisions. Thus, hardware efficiency gains—such as reduced memory footprint, or reduced FLOPs per forward pass—can be anticipated and exploited ahead of time. As we will show, these gains can be had without sacrificing overall performance.</p><p>\\\nWe leverage an approach akin to Mixture of Experts (MoE) transformers, in which dynamic token-level routing decisions are made across the network depth. Departing from MoE, we choose to either apply a computation to a token (as would be the case for a standard transformer), or pass it through a residual connection (remaining unchanged and saving compute). Also in contrast to MoE, we apply this routing to both forward MLPs and multi-head attention. Since this therefore also impacts the keys and queries we process, the routing makes decisions not only about which tokens to update, but also which tokens are made available to attend to. We refer to this strategy as Mixture-of-Depths (MoD) to emphasize how individual tokens pass through different numbers of layers, or blocks, through the depth of the transformer (see figure 1).</p><p>\\\nThe MoD technique also allows one to trade-off performance with speed. On the one hand, one can train an MoD transformer that improves upon vanilla transformers by as much as 1.5% on the final log probability training objective for equivalent training FLOPs (isoFLOP), and while taking an equivalent amount of wall-clock time to train. On the other hand, one can train an MoD transformer that achieves training loss parity with an isoFLOP optimal vanilla transformer, but which uses a fraction of the FLOPs (upwards of 50%) per forward pass, and hence is faster to step. Together, these results imply that MoD transformers learn to route intelligently (i.e., skipping computations that are unnecessary) since they can achieve equal or better log probabilities per sequence despite a smaller FLOP footprint per forward pass.</p>","contentLength":5586,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"NASA Rover Discovers Liquid Water 'Ripples' Carved Into Mars Rock","url":"https://science.slashdot.org/story/25/02/22/013239/nasa-rover-discovers-liquid-water-ripples-carved-into-mars-rock?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&utm_medium=feed","date":1740218400,"author":"BeauHD","guid":9058,"unread":true,"content":"Scientists have discovered evidence of ancient, shallow lakes on Mars that once had liquid water exposed to the atmosphere, challenging previous theories that all Martian water was covered in ice. Live Science reports: The patterns, which were photographed by NASA's Curiosity rover, are known as wave ripples -- minute ridge-like structures that form along the shores of lakebeds. This means that exposed liquid water must have flowed across Mars' surface at some point in its history. The ripples were present in two separate lakebeds in Gale Crater, which Curiosity has been exploring since Aug. 2012. \"The shape of the ripples could only have been formed under water that was open to the atmosphere and acted upon by wind,\" study first author Claire Mondro, a sedimentologist at CalTech, said in a statement.\n \nThe researchers also analyzed the height and spacing of the ripple waves to determine the size of the lake that formed them. The structures are approximately 0.2 inches (6 millimeters) tall and about 1.6 to 2 inches (4 to 5 centimeters) apart, indicating they were left by small waves. Based on these dimensions, the researchers believe the Martian lake must have been less than 2 meters (6.5 feet) deep. Both dry lakebeds appear to have formed around 3.7 billion years ago, indicating that Mars had an atmosphere dense and warm enough to support liquid water for longer than previously thought -- which could have intriguing implications. \"Extending the length of time that liquid water was present extends the possibilities for microbial habitability later into Mars's history,\" Mondro said. In other words: living organisms may have had a longer window in which they could have evolved on the Red Planet.

Martin, a former talk radio host and “Stop the Steal” supporter with no prosecutorial experience, is transforming what should be an independent office into what appears to be a personal intimidation squad.</p><p>After years of baselessly crying “lawfare” over legitimate investigations into January 6th and other matters, MAGA Republicans are now demonstrating what actual politically motivated investigations look like. This is after Trump-fluffing media like the National Review declared upon Trump’s election victory that it would lead to “<a href=\"https://www.nationalreview.com/2024/11/let-trumps-resounding-victory-be-the-end-of-lawfare/\">the end of lawfare</a>.”</p><p>Not surprisingly, we’re seeing the reverse. There are too many examples to cover right now, as the whole of the MAGA movement in government, including at both the FTC and FCC, appear to be engaging in frivolous lawfare to attack and harass those who are insufficiently sycophantic towards Trump and Elon Musk. And Ed Martin seems to be leading the pack.</p><p>For what it’s worth, Martin has no background as a prosecutor. He was one of those rightwing talk radio hosts for many years as well as an occasional (unsuccessful) candidate for political office. He was one of the foolish “stop the steal” supporters who has <a href=\"https://x.com/EagleEdMartin/status/1346907779492143106\">admitted to being at the Capitol</a> on January 6th in 2021, and claimed that what happened there was “nothing out of hand.” As a lawyer, he represented some of the January 6th defendants, raising some ethical eyebrows as one of his first moves as US Attorney was to move to dismiss a case against a defendant he himself represented. This has already resulted <a href=\"https://the65project.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Martin-Edward-MO-Public.pdf\">in a bar complaint</a>.</p><p>But Martin’s most concerning actions involve his apparent eagerness to serve as a personal attack dog for the administration. Soon after criticism of Musk’s DOGE initiative began mounting, Martin sent a particularly stupid letter to Musk and Steve Davis (one of Musk’s inner circle hatchet men), saying that he would “chase… to the end of the Earth to hold… accountable” anyone who “acted simply unethically” in regards to the government smashing that DOGE was doing.</p><p>If you can’t see the image, the text reads:</p><blockquote><p><em>Thank you for the referral of individuals and networks who appear to be stealing government property and/or threatening government employees. After your referral, as is my practice, I will begin an inquiry.</em></p><p><em>Please let me reiterate again: if people are discovered to have broken the law or even acted simply unethically, we will investigate them and</em><strong><em>we will chase them to the end of the Earth to hold them accountable</em></strong><em>. We will not rest or cease in this. No one should abuse American taxpayer dollars nor American taxpayer workers.</em></p><p><em>I am proud that we have been able to assist local law-enforcement in protecting the DOGE workers and others over the past week or so. A safe DC is a priority for President Trump and all of us.</em></p><p><em>Please keep in touch and continue to refer matters to me as soon as possible.</em></p></blockquote><p>Setting aside Martin’s peculiar spelling choices, his letter represents a fundamental misunderstanding (or deliberate misuse) of the DOJ’s role and constitutional limitations. The DOJ is not supposed to be the personal Gestapo of anyone in the executive branch, though Martin clearly feels otherwise. Indeed, he claimed that part of the job of his office is to <a href=\"https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/trump-dc-prosecutor-ed-martin-protect-doge-1235272841/\">“protect DOGE” and “federal workers,”</a> which seems like an odd thing to say as it is DOGE and Musk who are going around threatening and firing federal workers:</p><blockquote><p><em>In an email obtained by Rolling Stone, former “Stop the Steal” organizer turned interim U.S. Attorney Ed Martin claimed that members of Elon Musk’s so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) were receiving “despicable” threats.</em></p><p><em>“We are the D.C. U.S. Attorney’s office; we are the guardians of federal workers. You and I must do whatever possible to ensure that government work is safe for all involved,” Martin wrote Wednesday, as his boss dubiously and unceremoniously fires tens of thousands of federal workers en masse, with little oversight, accountability, or rationale.</em></p></blockquote><p>But Martin’s most dangerous overreach is his attempt to criminalize what he calls “simply unethical” behavior — a standard that exists nowhere in federal law and would violate basic First Amendment principles. While there are narrow exceptions for “true threats,” decades of Supreme Court precedent has carefully limited the government’s ability to punish speech.</p><p>As just one example, in the <a href=\"https://cdn.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/opinions/2011/07/19/09-50529.pdf\">US v. Bagdasarian</a>, the courts determined that truly horrendous speech from someone who said that President Obama should be shot (in much more graphic and problematic language) was not a true threat. To be a “true threat” speech <a href=\"https://www.law.georgetown.edu/icap/wp-content/uploads/sites/32/2024/08/True-Threats-Guidance-3.pdf\">has to show</a> an actual “intent to commit an act of unlawful violence.”</p><p>Yet Martin seems determined to ignore these well-established constitutional boundaries. Instead, he’s ramped up these politically motivated intimidation tactics, with what he’s calling “Project Whirlwind.” This is a silly name for what appears to be a plan to <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2025/02/19/trump-justice-operation-whirlwind-democrats/\">open frivolous investigations into Democrats</a> who criticize Trump or Musk, falsely claiming they are “threats.”</p><p>This is simple intimidation lawfare tactics of a political goon, given too much power. He kicked off this campaign <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2025/02/19/ed-martin-dc-letters-schumer-garcia/\">with letters</a> to Senator Chuck Schumer and Rep. Robert Garcia, claiming to be “letter of inquiry after request” which is not an actual thing.</p><p>The absurdity of Martin’s campaign is perfectly illustrated by his letter to Rep. Garcia. Garcia’s supposed “threat” consisted of calling Musk a “dick” on CNN and using an obvious metaphor about bringing “weapons to this bar fight” while discussing Congress’s role in protecting democracy. Any first-year law student could tell you this is constitutionally protected speech, yet Martin treated it as grounds for a federal investigation.</p><p>No one in their right mind would think that’s a threat, true or not. But Martin uses it to threaten Garcia with an investigation:</p><blockquote><p><em>As United States Attorney for the District of Columbia. I receive requests for information and clarification. I take these requests seriously and act on them with letters like this one you are receiving.</em></p><p><em>At this time, I respectfully request that you clarify your comments from February 12, 2025. During a live interview with CNN, when asked how Democrats can stop Elon Musk, you spoke clearly: “What the American public wants is for us to bring actual weapons to this bar fight. This is an actual fight for democracy.”</em></p><p><em>This sounds to some like a threat to Mr. Musk – an appointed representative of President Donald Trump who you call a “dick” and government staff who work for him. Their concerns have led to this inquiry.</em></p><p><em>We take threats against public officials very seriously. I look forward to your cooperation with my letter of inquiry after request. Thank you in advance for your assistance. Please respond by February 24, 2025. Should you have further questions regarding this matter, please do not hesitate to call my office or schedule a time to meet in person.</em></p></blockquote><p>If the Garcia investigation seems like overreach, Martin’s pursuit of Chuck Schumer ventures into the realm of the absurd. Martin is attempting to investigate five-year-old comments Schumer made during a rally at the Supreme Court in support of Roe v. Wade (before the Court overturned it) — comments that have already been publicly debated and for which Schumer previously apologized. <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/supreme-court/rare-rebuke-chief-justice-roberts-slams-schumer-threatening-comments-n1150036\">Schumer’s comments</a> were pretty mild, to be honest, and clearly did not rise to the level of true threats:</p><blockquote><p><em>“I want to tell you, Gorsuch, I want to tell you, Kavanaugh, you have</em><em>, and you will pay the price,” Schumer said.</em></p></blockquote><p>Martin’s choice of “Project Whirlwind” as a name — clearly meant to mock Schumer’s five-year-old “whirlwind” comment — reveals both the pettiness and political motivation behind these investigations. Martin sent a series of letters to Schumer demanding he explain himself, saying “no one is above the law.” Even while Schumer’s office did respond to Martin saying (accurately) that his comments were “not a threat to physically harm any person,” Martin still sent another letter nearly a week later falsely claiming that Schumer never responded. Hilariously, Martin says:</p><blockquote><p><em>You have failed to respond which is a personal disappointment and professionally unacceptable.</em></p></blockquote><p>Martin’s performative outrage over a “personal disappointment” would be comical if it weren’t so dangerous. His willingness to investigate five-year-old comments that resulted in exactly zero acts of violence demonstrates this isn’t about public safety — it’s about intimidation.</p><p>The real “professionally unacceptable” behavior here is Martin’s transformation of the DC US Attorney’s office into a political weapon aimed at critics of the administration. Indeed, not that they care, but Martin’s actions quite clearly violate the Trump Executive Order “<a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/restoring-freedom-of-speech-and-ending-federal-censorship/\">ending federal censorship</a>” which declares that no federal government employee should engage in “any conduct that would unconstitutionally abridge the free speech of any American citizen.”</p><p>There may be a silver lining to Martin’s amateurish, heavy-handed approach. As former Justice Department prosecutor Brendan Ballou <a href=\"https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2025/02/ed-martin-musk-trump-revenge-prosecutions-fail.html\">points out</a>, Martin’s obvious political motivations and incompetence might be his undoing.</p><blockquote><p><em>Because of Martin’s inexperience, he will need to persuade someone in his office to carry out his projects. Thus far, he seems to have done a terrible job of ingratiating himself to others: Most recently, the office’s top</em><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/18/us/politics/denise-cheung-federal-prosecutor-quits.html\"><em>criminal prosecutor resigned</em></a><em>rather than follow his allegedly improper orders. One former prosecutor in the office said, “He’s a fantastically bad manager—a tone deaf bully who inspires ridicule rather than trust.” Perhaps as a result, Martin’s officewide emails are often leaked,</em><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/08/us/ed-martin-us-attorneys-office-trump.html\"><em>including a message complaining about leaks</em></a></p><p><em>And this is where public discontent can play a role. The more unpopular Martin’s unethical or illegal schemes can be made, the less likely it is that he will find lawyers willing to implement them. The more unpopular his plans, the less likely he will be to receive the permanent position: If the Senate does not confirm Martin within 120 days of his interim appointment, the D.C. court may choose a replacement until the body acts.</em></p><p><em>The public should continue to speak out—in articles, in protests, and in tweets. Former leaders of the U.S. attorney’s office should talk too. They may be reluctant to criticize Martin’s most egregious actions, for fear of seeming to politicize the work of the office. But that work is already being politicized, and former senior prosecutors can speak to returning the office to the best of what it was and can be again.</em></p></blockquote><p>The MAGA movement’s hypocrisy is so blatant and so obvious that they don’t seem to care much if anyone realizes they’re absolutely and gleefully doing the very kinds of things they falsely accused the Biden administration of doing.</p><p>But for people who live in reality, it is important not to look away from what they’re doing and to call out the truth.</p>","contentLength":11331,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"A Brief Review of the Lie Group and the Geometries of SPD Manifolds","url":"https://hackernoon.com/a-brief-review-of-the-lie-group-and-the-geometries-of-spd-manifolds?source=rss","date":1740195294,"author":"Batching","guid":9108,"unread":true,"content":"<p>3.

Revisiting Normalization</p><p>Manifold-valued measurements exist in numerous applications within computer vision and machine learning. Recent studies have extended Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) to manifolds, and concomitantly, normalization techniques have also been adapted to several manifolds, referred to as Riemannian normalization. Nonetheless, most of the existing Riemannian normalization methods have been derived in an ad hoc manner and only apply to specific manifolds. This paper establishes a unified framework for Riemannian Batch Normalization (RBN) techniques on Lie groups. </p><p>\\\nOur framework offers the theoretical guarantee of controlling both the Riemannian mean and variance. Empirically, we focus on Symmetric Positive Definite (SPD) manifolds, which possess three distinct types of Lie group structures. Using the deformation concept, we generalize the existing Lie groups on SPD manifolds into three families of parameterized Lie groups. Specific normalization layers induced by these Lie groups are then proposed for SPD neural networks. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through three sets of experiments: radar recognition, human action recognition, and electroencephalography (EEG) classification. The code is available at https://github.com/GitZH-Chen/LieBN.git.</p><p>Over the past decade or so, Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have achieved remarkable progress across various scientific fields (Hochreiter &amp; Schmidhuber, 1997; Krizhevsky et al., 2012; He et al., 2016; Vaswani et al., 2017). Conventionally, DNNs have been developed with the underlying assumption of the Euclidean geometry inherent to input data. Nonetheless, there exists a plethora of applications wherein the latent spaces are defined by non-Euclidean structures such as manifolds (Bronstein et al., 2017). </p><p>\\\nTo address this issue, researchers have attempted to extend various types of DNNs to manifolds based on the theories of Riemannian geometry (Huang &amp; Van Gool, 2017; Huang et al., 2017; 2018; Ganea et al., 2018; Chakraborty et al., 2018; Brooks et al., 2019a;e;c;d; Brooks, 2020; Brooks et al., 2020; Chen et al., 2020; Chakraborty et al., 2020; Chakraborty, 2020; Chen et al., 2021; Wang et al., 2022b;a; Nguyen, 2022a;b; Nguyen &amp; Yang, 2023; Chen et al., 2023c;e;b; Wang et al., 2024).</p><p>\\\nMotivated by the great success of normalization techniques within DNNs (Ioffe &amp; Szegedy, 2015; Ba et al., 2016; Ulyanov et al., 2016; Wu &amp; He, 2018; Chen et al., 2023a), researchers have sought to devise normalization layers tailored for manifold-valued data. Brooks et al. (2019b) introduced Riemannian Batch Normalization (RBN) specifically designed for SPD manifolds, with the ability to regulate the Riemannian mean. This approach was further refined in Kobler et al. (2022b) to extend the control over the Riemannian variance. However, the above methods are constrained within the affine-invariant metric (AIM) on SPD manifolds, limiting their applicability and generality. </p><p>\\\nOn the other hand, Chakraborty (2020) proposed two distinct Riemannian normalization frameworks, one tailored for Riemannian homogeneous spaces and the other catering to matrix Lie groups. Nonetheless, the normalization designed for Riemannian homogeneous spaces cannot regulate mean nor variance, while the normalization approach for matrix Lie groups is confined to a specific type of distance (Chakraborty, 2020, Sec. 3.2). A principled Riemannian normalization framework capable of controlling both Riemannian mean and variance remains unexplored.</p><p>\\\nGiven that Batch Normalization (BN) (Ioffe &amp; Szegedy, 2015) serves as the foundational prototype for various types of normalization, our paper only concentrates on RBN currently and can be readily extended to other normalization techniques. As several manifold-valued measurements form Lie groups, including SPD manifolds, Special Orthogonal (SO) groups, and Special Euclidean (SE) groups, we further direct our attention towards Lie groups. We propose a general framework for RBN over Lie groups, referred to as LieBN, and validate our approach in normalizing both the Riemannian mean and variance. </p><p>\\\nOn the empirical side, we focus on SPD manifolds, where three distinct types of Lie groups have been recognized in the literature. We generalize these existing Lie groups into parameterized forms through the deformation concept. Then, we showcase our LieBN framework on SPD manifolds under these Lie groups and propose specific normalization layers. Extensive experiments conducted on widely-used SPD benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework. We highlight that our work is entirely theoretically different from Brooks et al. (2019b); Kobler et al. (2022a); Lou et al. (2020), and more general than Chakraborty (2020). The previous RBN methods are either designed for a specific manifold or metric (Brooks et al., 2019b; Kobler et al., 2022a; Chakraborty, 2020), or fail to control mean and variance (Lou et al., 2020), while our LieBN guarantees the normalization of mean and variance on general Lie groups. </p><p>\\\nIn summary, our main contributions are as follows: (a) a general Lie group batch normalization framework with controllable first- and second-order statistical moments, and (b) the specific construction of our LieBN layers on SPD manifolds based on three deformed Lie groups and their application on SPD neural networks.

These models are particularly intriguing due to the stringent constraints of direct detection experiments. In chapters 2 and 4, we explore models where the pseudo-scalar properties serve as both a mediator and a dark matter candidate, allowing them to evade the direct detection bounds. Additionally, in chapter 3, we delve into a two-component dark matter model and its relevant phenomenological features. Here, we provide a concise overview of each of these chapters.</p><p>\\\nChapter 2 focuses on an ALP portal fermion dark matter model. This model is minimal, consisting of three right-handed neutrinos (RHNs) and one pseudo-scalar mediator known as ALP. The two RHNs mix with the three active neutrinos, generating neutrino masses through Type I seesaw mechanism (detailed in Appendix-C). The stability of the third RHN is ensured by a Z2 symmetry, making it a viable dark matter candidate. We then proceed to analyze the constraints imposed by neutrino mixing and ALP couplings to Standard Model (SM) particles. By incorporating these experimental bounds, we investigate the parameter space that allows for fermion dark matter, taking into account relic density, direct detection, and indirect detection constraints. Remarkably, the model exhibits a significant parameter space that satisfies the relic density constraint, and it also possesses detectable signatures for indirect searches such as Fermi-LAT or HESS.</p><p>\\\nIn chapter 3, we explore a model of dark matter consisting of a scalar and fermion as components. This model is based on a generic U(1)𝑋 extension of the Standard Model (SM). To ensure the consistency of the model, we introduce three right-handed neutrinos, which necessitate the presence of the U(1)𝑋 gauge symmetry. Additionally, we incorporate two new complex scalars into the model. These scalars are singlets under the SM but carry charges under the U(1)𝑋 gauge symmetry. One of the scalars breaks the U(1)𝑋 gauge symmetry, while the other scalar is responsible for the scalar dark matter (DM).</p><p>\\\nIn this model, we also include two Z2 symmetries. One of these symmetries applies to the right-handed neutrinos, while the other symmetry applies to the new scalar. As a result, both the scalars and fermions can potentially act as DM candidates. Furthermore, the two remaining right-handed neutrinos mix with the three active neutrinos, leading to the generation of neutrino masses through a Type I seesaw mechanism</p><p>\\\nFinally, we explore a few more U(1) models that allow for parameter space accommodating the two-component DM. This model offers a rich phenomenology and provides opportunities for testing and collaboration with colleagues. \\n </p><p>We have previously discussed the WIMP DM models within the framework of the ALP portal and U(1)𝑋 extension. These models have been thoroughly analyzed, taking into account various theoretical and experimental constraints. The model we have discussed addresses certain issues associated with WIMP models, particularly the lack of direct detection of WIMP DM. Additionally, our models incorporate neutrino physics, including oscillation and mass mechanisms. These bottom-up models offer a fascinating range of phenomenology that can be explored through collider-based experiments. </p><p>\\\nHowever, it is worth noting that the standard DM mass in these WIMP DM models is limited to the range of a few GeV to TeV, which restricts the scope of our explored DM scenarios. There are other intriguing mass ranges for DM, such as ultralight dark matter, sub-GeV DM, and primordial black holes, among others. I intend to investigate these scenarios in future research. Furthermore, apart from considering different DM candidates, exploring the production mechanisms of DM is also an intriguing avenue for further exploration and study. \\n </p><p>(1) Shivam Gola, The Institute of Mathematical Sciences, Chennai.</p>","contentLength":4015,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Scientists Question Microsoft's Quantum Computing Claims","url":"https://science.slashdot.org/story/25/02/22/0232239/scientists-question-microsofts-quantum-computing-claims?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&utm_medium=feed","date":1740191580,"author":"msmash","guid":8935,"unread":true,"content":"Microsoft's announcement of a breakthrough in quantum computing faces skepticism from physicists, who say evidence supporting the company's claims remains insufficient. \n\nThe tech giant reported creating Majorana particles - a development it says could revolutionize quantum computing - but the accompanying peer-reviewed paper in Nature does not conclusively demonstrate this achievement, according to multiple quantum physics experts who reviewed the research. \n\nMicrosoft's corporate vice president for quantum hardware, Chetan Nayak, acknowledged the Nature paper wasn't meant to prove the particles' existence, though he claimed measurements suggested \"95% likelihood\" of topological activity.

Two proposed changes are particularly concerning.</p><p>First, amicus briefs would be “disfavored” if they address issues “already mentioned” by the parties. This language is extremely broad and may significantly reduce the amount and types of amicus briefs that are filed in the circuit courts. As we said in our comments:</p><blockquote><p>We often file amicus briefs that expand upon issues only briefly addressed by the parties, either because of lack of space given other issues that party counsel must also address on appeal, or a lack of deep expertise by party counsel on a specific issue that EFF specializes in. We see this often in criminal appeals when we file in support of the defendant. We also file briefs that address issues mentioned by the parties but additionally explain how the relevant technology works or how the outcome of the case will impact certain other constituencies.</p></blockquote><p>We then shared examples of EFF amicus briefs that may have been disfavored if the “already mentioned” standard had been in effect, even though our briefs provided help to the courts. Just two examples are:</p><ul><li>In , we filed an <a href=\"https://www.eff.org/document/eff-amicus-brief-us-v-cano\">amicus brief</a> that addressed the core issue of the case—whether the border search exception to the Fourth Amendment’s warrant requirement applies to cell phones. We provided a detailed explanation of the privacy interests in digital devices, and a thorough Fourth Amendment analysis regarding why a warrant should be required to search digital devices at the border. The <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=11641349571575767123&amp;q\">Ninth Circuit</a> extensively engaged with our brief to vacate the defendant’s conviction.</li><li>In<em> NetChoice, LLC v. Attorney General of Florida</em>, a First Amendment case about social media content moderation (later considered by the <a href=\"https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2024/07/platforms-have-first-amendment-right-curate-speech-weve-long-argued-supreme-1\">Supreme Court</a>), we filed an <a href=\"https://www.eff.org/document/eff-amicus-brief-netchoice-v-florida\">amicus brief</a> that elaborated on points only briefly made by the parties about the prevalence of specialized social media services reflecting a wide variety of subject matter focuses and political viewpoints. Several of the examples we provided were used by the <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=9979979251585010846&amp;q\">11th Circuit</a> in its opinion.</li></ul><p>Second, the proposed rules would require an amicus organization (or person) to file a motion with the court and get formal approval before filing an amicus brief. This would replace the current rule, which also allows an amicus brief to be filed if both parties in the case consent (which is commonly what happens).</p><p>As we stated in our comments: “Eliminating the consent provision will dramatically increase motion practice for circuit courts, putting administrative burdens on the courts as well as amicus brief filers.” We also argued that this proposed change “is not in the interests of justice.” We wrote:</p><blockquote><p>Having to write and file a separate motion may disincentivize certain parties from filing amicus briefs, especially people or organizations with limited resources … The circuits should … facilitate the participation by diverse organizations at all stages of the appellate process—where appeals often do not just deal with discrete disputes between parties, but instead deal with matters of constitutional and statutory interpretation that will impact the rights of Americans for years to come.</p></blockquote><p>Amicus briefs are a crucial part of EFF’s work in defending your digital rights, and our briefs provide valuable arguments and expertise that help the courts make informed decisions. That’s why we are calling on the Judicial Conference to reject these changes and preserve our ability to file amicus briefs in the federal appellate courts that make a difference.</p><p>Your support is essential in ensuring that we can continue to fight for your digital rights—in and out of court.</p>","contentLength":4576,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"https://www.eff.org/files/banner_library/eff30-banner-blue.jpg","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Asus Continues Fragrant Device Trend With an Aromatic Mouse","url":"https://hardware.slashdot.org/story/25/02/22/002225/asus-continues-fragrant-device-trend-with-an-aromatic-mouse?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&utm_medium=feed","date":1740185400,"author":"BeauHD","guid":8896,"unread":true,"content":"Asus has introduced the Fragrance Mouse, a hybrid wireless mouse that features a removable container for fragrance oils.

One of the biggest reasons is a lack of expertise, which surprisingly isn't just about numbers. The industry now suffers from a lack of professionals who can implement AI tasks effectively.</strong></p><p>\\\nAs an AI practitioner, you're expected to understand machine learning, AI algorithms, and data analysis. You should also be able to design and implement AI solutions in real-world situations. However, attempting to do all this fast may spur a series of mistakes that reduce your expertise. Read on as I break down the 10 most common mistakes I've seen new AI practitioners make and how you can avoid them.</p><ol><li><strong>Not Familiarizing Yourself with Foundational AI Topics</strong></li></ol><p>From the first time you chose to practice in AI, you've been bound to encounter several learning roadmaps. I wrote on one of those frameworks, and without a doubt, they're there to guide you on what to learn and how.</p><p>\\\nThe problem is most AI learners attempt to jump hoops. For instance, many people underplay the importance of basic mathematics and statistics and jump straight to data structures or Python. No, it's not okay as long as you know Python. Understanding these core topics will help you interpret data and make effective decisions when the time comes.</p><ol start=\"2\"><li><strong>Staying Stuck on Data Preparation</strong></li></ol><p>Someone called this the \"\" It's a trap because, most of the time, over-preparation doesn't necessarily translate to perfection. You could spend hours preparing, cleaning, and organizing data before analysis; at the end of the day, you lose sight of what matters.</p><p>\\\nI know you're told to spend 50-80% of your time on data wrangling. While that's valid, knowing when you've done enough is equally important. The time you spend on discovery, cleaning, structuring, enriching, and validating will depend on the quality and quantity of the raw data. However, this should not exceed 70% of the time allocated to that assignment.</p><ol start=\"3\"><li><strong>Underestimating the Importance of Data Cleaning</strong></li></ol><p>Data cleansing is a part of the data wrangling process. And yes, I mentioned not staying stuck on data wrangling. But here's the deal. Spend half the total time allocated to data wrangling on cleansing. As it's impossible to strip your skin of all the microorganisms on it, you'll still have a negligible percentage of inaccuracy after cleaning your data.</p><p>\\\nHowever, if this amount is significant, it might lead to a ton of inaccurate insights that will cost you and the organization time, effort, and money. You wouldn't be inclined to use ChatGPT if every time you ask it, 'Who are you?', it says 'DeepSeek .' As a new AI practitioner, you might want to rush the process for the joy of a new AI system. But don't. Always take your time to identify and handle any issues in the dataset.</p><ol start=\"4\"><li><strong>Using Fancy Algorithms Without Understanding Them</strong></li></ol><p>One of Rob Pike's 5 programming rules is that fancy algorithms are buggier than simple ones and are much more complicated to implement. This is also true when dealing with AI algorithms. As a beginning AI practitioner, you may be tempted to learn complex algorithms like GANs. They may make you seem cool, but not understanding them well enough is a recipe for disaster. You don't want to be caught using reinforcement learning for basic image classification.</p><p>\\\nWhen starting, focus on the simple algorithms that can save you tons of hours debugging. You can slowly transition into adopting the fancy ones by practicing them on less sophisticated datasets. They'll help you ease into them and pave the way for the expert you're becoming.</p><ol start=\"5\"><li>Having Too Many Tools in Your Toolbox</li></ol><p>As a professional, you probably have several tools you rely on for your workflow. You wouldn't also be an engineer if you weren't tempted to try every 'great' tool that drops in the market. But whether it's data cleansing, analysis, or machine learning, it's best to master one or two tools for each part of your workflow&nbsp;for now.</p><p>\\\nFor example, you could choose between TensorFlow, PyTorch, or Scikit-learn for machine learning, but not all. SpaCy, Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK), and Hugging Face Transformers are all viable options for natural language processing, but don't be tempted to roll with them all.</p><ol start=\"6\"><li><strong>Focusing Too Much Or Too Little on Maths</strong></li></ol><p>Mathematics is as essential as any other core subject in AI learning. Concepts like algebra, probability, calculus, and statistics set the ground for future more complex theorems. As an AI practitioner, it's also crucial that you have a good understanding of maths so that you don't just know what works but how it works as well.</p><p>\\\nOf course, computers do the math for us through programming and high-level frameworks. But it will deprive you of becoming an expert who understands the nitty-gritty of what's going on behind the code. At the same time, you do not need to know everything in mathematics to train your first neural network.</p><ol start=\"7\"><li><strong>Ignoring Model Validation</strong></li></ol><p>Model validation and evaluation is another important aspect of creating working AI solutions. If your machine learning model does not perform well on the holdout set, how can you trust it to make accurate predictions on your new dataset?</p><p>\\\nYou must always evaluate your models and measure key indicators like accuracy, recall, precision, mean squared error (MSE), F1-score, etc. Don't just split the data into two folds. Use multiple folds to train on some and assess it on others.</p><ol start=\"8\"><li><strong>Ignoring communication skills</strong></li></ol><p>If you work for a small organization, you might be the only AI practitioner in the room most of the time. You may have to deal with only the CTO knowing what you mean by 'I employed adversarial training to augment the robustness of their convolutional neural network (CNN) against norm-bounded perturbations.'</p><p>\\\nThe truth is that even the CTO might need to digest that twice. Make explaining yourself in layman's terms second nature. Your jargon won't help the marketing team understand what's delaying the process and won't help the situation.</p><ol start=\"9\"><li><strong>Focusing on More Theory without Hands-on Practice</strong></li></ol><p>Learning is good, but you don't want to be caught in the 'ever learning, never practicing' curse. As you learn about frameworks like Keras, Numpy, or Tensorflow, ensure you practice them.</p><p>\\\nAs you dive into machine learning or deep learning algorithms, practice them. You also want to teach other people what you've learned. If you don't have mentees, write blogs about them. That's how you go from beginner to expert.</p><p>The world has advanced significantly. In my opinion, part of that advancement is not needing to spend four years behind the walls of a college and thousands of dollars on tuition.</p><p>\\\nIf you already have a degree in a related field, that will make the ride easier. But if you don't, invest in online courses and certifications. Employers no longer want to see fancy degrees on your CV. They want evidence of practical experience and recognized certifications like the AWS Certified AI Practitioner.</p><p>As a beginning AI practitioner, you may feel pressured to jump hoops to match everyone else's pace. But doing that will cost you knowledge and opportunities. Avoid these 10 mistakes, and you're well on becoming a professional AI practitioner.</p>","contentLength":7132,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Wine 10.2 Upgrades VKD3D, Supports Setting Thread Priorities","url":"https://www.phoronix.com/news/Wine-10.2-Released","date":1740183959,"author":"Michael Larabel","guid":8900,"unread":true,"content":"<article>Following last month's release of Wine 10.0 one month ago, Wine 10.2 is now available as the newest bi-weekly development release that will culminate with the Wine 11.0 stable release in early 2026...</article>","contentLength":200,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"OpenAI Bans Chinese Accounts Using ChatGPT To Edit Code For Social Media Surveillance","url":"https://tech.slashdot.org/story/25/02/21/2356205/openai-bans-chinese-accounts-using-chatgpt-to-edit-code-for-social-media-surveillance?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&utm_medium=feed","date":1740183000,"author":"BeauHD","guid":8875,"unread":true,"content":"OpenAI has banned a group of Chinese accounts using ChatGPT to develop an AI-powered social media surveillance tool.

The name of their non-violent civil resistance group, STOP AI, makes its mission clear. The organization wants to ban something that, by most accounts, doesn't yet exist -- artificial general intelligence, or AGI, defined by OpenAI as \"highly autonomous systems that outperform humans at most economically valuable work.\"\n \nSTOP AI outlines a broader set of goals on its website. For example, \"We want governments to force AI companies to shut down everything related to the creation of general-purpose AI models, destroy any existing general-purpose AI model, and permanently ban their development.\" In answer to the question \"Does STOP AI want to ban all AI?\", the group's answer is, \"Not necessarily, just whatever is necessary to keep humanity alive.\" The group, which has held protests outside OpenAI's office and plans another outside the company's San Francisco HQ on February 22, has bold goal: rally support from 3.5 percent of the U.S. population, or 11 million people. That's the so-called \"tipping point\" needed for societal change, based on research by political scientist Erica Chenoweth.\n \n\"The implications of artificial general intelligence are so immense and dangerous that we just don't want that to come about ever,\" said Finn van der Velde, an AI safety advocate and activist with a technical background in computer science and AI specifically. \"So what that will practically mean is that we will probably need an international treaty where the governments across the board agree that we don't build AGI. And so that means disbanding companies like OpenAI that specifically have the goal to build AGI.\" It also means regulating compute power so that no one will be able to train an AGI model.","contentLength":1934,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Associated Press Sues Trump Officials After Ban Over ‘Gulf Of Mexico/America’ Nonsense","url":"https://www.techdirt.com/2025/02/21/associated-press-sues-trump-officials-after-ban-over-gulf-of-mexico-america-nonsense/","date":1740180280,"author":"Dark Helmet","guid":8878,"unread":true,"content":"<p>The Trump administration’s dumbest saga so far just got a bit more serious, thankfully. For the past couple of weeks, we have been talking about how, after Donald Trump ordered the government to change the name of the continental shelf extending from American land be renamed from the all-encompassing “Gulf of Mexico,” as the whole body of water has been named for centuries, to the “Gulf of America,” the administration <a href=\"https://www.techdirt.com/2025/02/13/the-real-gulf-of-america-is-between-the-news-outlets-that-cover-this-administration/\">began banning</a> the AP from some press activities over the AP’s refusal to make that change in its influential AP Stylebook. To be more specific, the Stylebook refers to the body of water by its traditional (actual) name, while also acknowledging the new name that Trump has given it. After that initial ban, the administration actually expanded the ban on what the AP could attend while also stating that the ban is “indefinite.”</p><p>In my post on the topic, I mentioned that a well-functioning press pool would at this point band together and fight back on behalf of the AP. After all, an attack on one member of the press is, in fact, an attack on all of them in the long run. Initially, this did not happen. In fact, some of the more idiotic members of the press tried to argue that any attempt to fight back would be giving Trump <a href=\"https://www.techdirt.com/2025/02/18/white-house-access-press-shrinks-like-feckless-daisies-after-ap-kicked-out-of-briefing-room-for-rejecting-gulf-of-america-name-change/\">what he wants</a>. As opposed to, I guess, simply letting him trample on the rights of the press and speech rights. Somehow  would  be giving him what he wants, though I can’t explain how that would be.</p><p>Fortunately, the rest of the press eventually got around to doing something in the form of signing onto a protest letter. Oh, and <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/ap-lawsuit-trump-administration-officials-0352075501b779b8b187667f3427e0e8\">the AP has now sued the administration</a> for a violation of both its First and Fifth Amendment rights. The suit is embedded below for all to read, but let’s acknowledge first that the press pool, including far-right outlets, finally partook in some collective action, tepid though it may be.</p><blockquote><p><em>This week, about 40 news organizations signed onto a letter organized by the White House Correspondents Association, urging the White House to reverse its policy against the AP.</em></p></blockquote><p>Reporting indicates that signatories to that letter included both Fox News and Newsmax. When is pushing back on Trump over an attack on the press, that should really mean something.</p><p>But now, onto the lawsuit. As mentioned, it claims that the administration’s actions violate both the AP’s due process rights, as well as its speech rights.</p><blockquote><p><em>The ban violates the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. As the D.C. Circuit has made clear, journalists’ “first amendment interest” in access to the White House “undoubtedly qualifies as liberty which may not be denied without due process of law under the fifth amendment.” Sherrill v. Knight, 569 F.2d 124, 130-31 (D.C. Cir. 1977). Defendants gave the AP no prior or written notice of, and no formal opportunity to challenge, their arbitrary determination that the AP would indefinitely lose access to the Oval Office, Air Force One, and other limited areas as a member of the press pool – as well as access to larger locations open to a wider group of journalists and reporters with White House press credentials – unless the AP adopted the Administration’s preferred language in its reporting.</em></p><p><em>The ban also violates the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. The D.C. Circuit has made clear that denying journalists access to White House press events “based upon the content of the journalist’s speech” is “prohibited under the first amendment.” Sherrill, 569 F.2d at 129. Having opened the White House and certain areas to the press, the First Amendment “requires that this access not be denied arbitrarily or for less than compelling reasons.” Ateba v. Jean-Pierre, 706 F. Supp. 3d 63, 75-76 (D.D.C. 2023) (quoting Sherrill, 569 F.2d at 129) (emphasis in original), appeal argued, No. 24-5004 (D.C. Cir. Oct. 15, 2024). Defendants have not provided, nor could they provide, any compelling reason for their arbitrary denial of the AP’s access. Rather, Defendants’ actions are impermissibly based on their dislike of the content of the AP’s expression and what they perceive as the AP’s viewpoint reflected in the content of its expression. The White House ban of the AP also constitutes impermissible retaliation, as it was instituted to punish the AP for its constitutionally protected speech in ways that would chill the speech of a reasonable person of ordinary firmness.</em></p></blockquote><p>Remember all of those claims about how Trump learned lessons from his first term and would be more effective, learned, and efficient at governing this go around? Well, it appears that won’t always be the case. Trump did this in his first term, banning CNN’s Jim Acosta from the press pool because Trump didn’t like his questions. CNN sued, just like the AP has, and eventually Acosta was allowed back in. That will almost certainly be how this thing goes, too, unless Trump takes this all the way to a suspiciously compliant Supreme Court. Even then, this might be a bridge to far for those gods in black robes.</p><p>And there should be no question that this is all due to Trump’s pettiness. The administration may attempt to obfuscate that in its legal response, but the Dear Leader has been quite clear as to what is driving all of this in very public comments.</p><blockquote><p><em>In stopping the AP from attending press events at the White House and Mar-a-Lago, or flying on Air Force One in the agency’s customary spot, the Trump team directly cited the AP’s decision not to fully follow the president’s renaming.</em></p><p><em>“We’re going to keep them out until such time as they agree that it’s the Gulf of America,”&nbsp;<a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/trump-ap-white-house-press-corps-pool-91535a6384d681fee1cd7e384ea6c627\">Trump said Tuesday.</a></em></p></blockquote><p>Describing this suit as an “open and shut” case of a First Amendment violation at a minimum probably doesn’t do it justice. This is more of an attempted assault of the First Amendment and it will be quite telling to see how the courts respond.</p><p>Anything less than a temporary restraining order to reinstate the AP’s access, followed by a swift finding for the AP, would be the courts stomping all over our First, and I would argue most important, Amendment.</p>","contentLength":6144,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Court filings show Meta staffers discussed using copyrighted content for AI training","url":"https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/21/court-filings-show-meta-staffers-discussed-using-copyrighted-content-for-ai-training/","date":1740179738,"author":"Kyle Wiggers","guid":8867,"unread":true,"content":"<p>For years, Meta employees have internally discussed using copyrighted works obtained through legally questionable means to train the company’s AI models, according to court documents unsealed on Thursday.

Some pretended to be on phone calls. Others claimed they hadn’t heard the comments. A few muttered hopes about “negotiating strategy.” This would be comedic if it weren’t so catastrophically dangerous.</p><p>Let’s cut through the bullshit: This isn’t just policy disagreement or political maneuvering. It’s the complete collapse of the post-war security architecture that has prevented great power war for three generations. And our political class is responding with all the urgency of someone scheduling a dental cleaning.</p><p>The reason for their silence? Fear of mean tweets—many generated by bot networks. Fear of being primaried. Fear of the digital mob that Elon Musk can direct with a few keystrokes—a mob increasingly composed of artificial accounts and coordinated influence operations. These aren’t just personal failures of courage—they represent something far more dangerous: the complete surrender of democratic institutions to manufactured technological intimidation.</p><p>Let’s be clear about the historical magnitude of this choice: They’re trading their eyewitness testimony of war crimes for social media comfort. They’re choosing X followers—most of whom are probably bots tied to various influence operations, both foreign and domestic—over the international order that has prevented nuclear war for three generations.</p><p>The supreme irony is that the pressure they’re surrendering to isn’t even real. These senators are abandoning witnessed truth about war crimes in response to artificially generated outrage. They’re choosing bot approval over bomb evidence. The digital mob they fear is largely synthetic—but the consequences of their cowardice will be catastrophically real.</p><p>Consider the grotesque math these senators are doing: They’re weighing firsthand evidence of war crimes against the threat of hostile posts on X. They’re balancing their direct knowledge of Russian aggression against the risk of Musk funding a primary challenger. And they’re choosing digital self-preservation over defense of basic reality.</p><p>This isn’t just cowardice—it’s a revelation of how thoroughly our democratic institutions have been captured by technological intimidation. When United States senators cannot state truths they’ve witnessed with their own eyes because they fear a billionaire’s social media platform, we’re not just watching individual moral failure—we’re seeing the complete collapse of institutional independence.</p><p>Two plus two equals four. Russia invaded Ukraine. Mass graves don’t tweet.</p><p>The sheer audacity of this surrender is breathtaking. Senator Lindsey Graham, who has&nbsp;<a href=\"https://responsiblestatecraft.org/nato-trump-ukraine/\">positioned</a>&nbsp;himself as one of Ukraine’s strongest allies and has personally seen the evidence of Russian atrocities, responds to Trump’s pro-Putin statement by suggesting Trump is Ukraine’s “best hope.” This isn’t just lying—it’s actively participating in the destruction of&nbsp;.</p><p>Two plus two equals four. These senators know what they’ve seen. They know who invaded whom. They’ve walked among the mass graves, seen the bombed hospitals, counted the dead. Yet they’ve decided that appeasing digital mobs—swollen by bots and algorithmic rage—matters more than defending democracy itself.</p><p>When future generations ask how we allowed democratic institutions to be dismantled by social media mobs, these profiles in cowardice will stand as perfect examples. They saw the truth with their own eyes—and chose to stay silent for fear of mean tweets.</p><p>Consider the sheer audacity of the gaslighting: The same senators who hailed Zelensky as a modern Churchill in 2022 now can’t muster even tepid defense of basic reality. They’re not just abandoning an ally—they’re actively participating in the dismantling of the international system that has kept nuclear powers from direct conflict.</p><p>Two plus two equals four. Russia invaded Ukraine. This isn’t complicated. Yet we watch senators who know better—who have visited mass graves in Ukraine, who have met Zelensky personally—engage in elaborate rhetorical contortions to avoid stating simple truth. When Senator Kevin Cramer suggests Trump’s embrace of Putin might be “negotiating strategy,” he’s not just being cowardly—he’s actively helping normalize the destruction of democratic alliances.</p><p>The most revealing response came from those who simply pretended not to hear the question, marching past reporters with phones pressed to their ears. This isn’t just evasion—it’s a perfect metaphor for how institutional actors respond to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.notesfromthecircus.com/p/the-final-despotism\">existential</a>&nbsp;threats: by pretending they don’t exist.</p><p>But here’s what makes this moment particularly dangerous: These aren’t just individual acts of cowardice. They represent the systematic failure of democratic institutions to defend themselves. When senators who have seen the evidence of Russian atrocities firsthand cannot even maintain basic moral clarity about aggression and self-defense, they’re not just failing Ukraine—they’re participating in the destruction of the very framework that prevents great power war.</p><p>The&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.notesfromthecircus.com/p/the-comfort-of-sleepwalkers\">comfortable blindness</a>&nbsp;that precedes catastrophe is on full display. Our political class continues to treat the dismantling of global security architecture as if it were normal political development rather than an existential threat to international stability. They maintain institutional proprieties while the foundations of peace crumble.</p><p>History will not be kind to these profiles in cowardice. When future generations ask how we allowed the system that prevented World War III to be dismantled, these senators’ elaborate evasions will stand as perfect examples of institutional failure in the face of obvious catastrophe.</p><p>What we are witnessing isn’t mere cowardice—though the spectacle of United States senators cowering before artificial X accounts certainly qualifies. No, this is something Hannah Arendt would recognize immediately: the banality of (digital) evil. The quiet, procedural way that moral atrocity becomes acceptable, not through dramatic villainy, but through the simple choice to value one’s social media standing over witnessed truth.</p><p>These are men and women who have stood in mass graves. Who have walked through bombed hospitals. Who have seen firsthand the evidence of Putin’s barbarism. And now, faced with the simple task of stating these obvious truths, they perform their own small acts of evil—not with grand malice, but with the bureaucratic efficiency of checking their X metrics.</p><p>Like Arendt’s subjects, they would protest that they are simply being “practical,” that they are “working within the system.” But their practicality consists of trading their eyewitness testimony of war crimes for bot approval. Their system is the methodical destruction of truth itself.</p><p>When future generations ask how we allowed the post-war order to collapse, how we permitted the system that prevented World War III to be dismantled, these profiles in cowardice will stand as perfect examples.

If you are a bystander, stand at a safe distance from the scene that you are recording.</li><li>You may take photos or record video and/or audio.</li><li>Law enforcement cannot order you to move&nbsp;&nbsp;you are recording, but they may order you to move for public safety reasons&nbsp;<em>even if you are recording</em>.</li><li>Law enforcement may not search your cell phone or other device&nbsp;<a href=\"https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/573/373/#tab-opinion-1970971\">without a warrant based on probable cause from a judge</a>, even if you are under arrest. Thus, you may refuse a request from an officer to review or delete what you recorded. You also may refuse to unlock your phone or provide your passcode.</li><li>Despite reasonably exercising your First Amendment rights, law enforcement officers may illegally retaliate against you in a number of ways including with arrest, destruction of your device, and bodily harm. They may also try to retaliate by harming the person being arrested. We urge you to remain alert and mindful about this possibility.</li><li>Consider the sensitive nature of recording in the context of an ICE arrest. The person being arrested or their loved ones may be concerned about exposing their immigration status, so think about obtaining consent or blurring out faces in any version you publish to focus on ICE’s conduct (while still retaining the original video).</li></ul><h3><strong>Your First Amendment Right to Record Law Enforcement Officers Exercising Their Official Duties in Public</strong></h3><p>Federal appellate courts typically frame the right to record law enforcement as&nbsp;<em>the right to record officers exercising their official duties in public</em>. This right extends to private places, too, where the recorder has a legal right to be, such as in&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2022/07/victory-another-court-protects-right-record-police\">their own home</a>. However, if the law enforcement officer is off-duty or is in a private space that you don’t have a right to be in, your right to record the officer may be limited.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Special Considerations for Recording Audio</strong></h3><p>The right to record law enforcement unequivocally includes the right to&nbsp;<em>take pictures and record video</em>. There is an added legal wrinkle when&nbsp;—whether with or without video. Some law enforcement officers have argued that recording audio without their consent violates wiretap laws. Courts have generally rejected this argument. The&nbsp;<a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=4027403108062769854\">Seventh Circuit</a>, for example, held that the Illinois wiretap statute violated the First Amendment as applied to audio recording on-duty police.</p><p>There are&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.rcfp.org/resources/first-amendment-handbook/#surreptitious-recording\">two kinds</a>&nbsp;of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.rcfp.org/wp-content/uploads/imported/RECORDING.pdf\">wiretaps laws</a>: those that require “all parties” to a conversation to consent to audio recording (12 states), and those that only require “one party” to consent (38 states, the District of Columbia, and the<a href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/2511\">&nbsp;federal statute</a>). Thus, if you’re in a&nbsp;&nbsp;state, and you’re involved in an incident with law enforcement (that is, you’re a party to the conversation) and you want to record audio of that interaction, you are the one party consenting to the recording and you don’t also need the law enforcement officer’s consent. If you’re in an&nbsp;, and your cell phone or recording device is in plain view, your open audio recording puts the officer on notice and thus their consent might be implied.</p><p>Additionally, wiretap laws in both all-party consent states and one-party consent states typically only prohibit audio recording of&nbsp;—that is, when the parties to the conversation have a reasonable expectation of privacy.&nbsp;<em>Law enforcement officers exercising their official duties, particularly in public, do not have a reasonable expectation of privacy.&nbsp;</em>Neither do civilians in public places who speak to law enforcement in a manner audible to passersby. Thus, if you’re a bystander, you may legally audio record an officer’s interaction with another person, regardless of whether you’re in a state with an all-party or one-party consent wiretap statute. However, you should take into consideration that ICE arrests may expose the immigration status of the person being arrested or their loved ones. As&nbsp;<a href=\"https://lab.witness.org/how-could-states-wiretapping-laws-affect-your-right-tofilm-law-enforcement/\">WITNESS</a>&nbsp;puts it: “[I]t’s important to keep in mind the privacy and dignity of the person being targeted by law enforcement. They may not want to be recorded or have the video shared publicly. When possible, make eye contact or communicate with the person being detained to let them know that you are there to observe and document the cops’ behavior. Always respect their wishes if they ask you to stop filming.” You may also want to consider blurring faces to focus on ICE’s conduct if you publish the video online (while still retaining the original version)</p><p>Moreover, whether you may&nbsp;&nbsp;record law enforcement (whether with photos, video or audio) is important to understand, given that officers may retaliate against individuals who&nbsp;&nbsp;record them. At least&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2021/04/first-circuit-upholds-first-amendment-right-secretly-audio-record-police\">one federal appellate court</a>, the First Circuit, has affirmed the First Amendment right to secretly audio record law enforcement performing their official duties in public. On the other hand, the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=12123452274167901501\">Ninth Circuit</a>&nbsp;recently upheld Oregon’s law that generally bans secret recordings of in-person conversations without all participants’ consent, and only allows recordings of conversations where police officers are participants if “[t]he recording is made openly and in plain view of the participants in the conversation.” Unless you are within the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.ca1.uscourts.gov/about-court\">jurisdiction</a>&nbsp;of the First Circuit (Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Puerto Rico and Rhode Island), it’s probably best to have your recording device in plain view of police officers.</p><h3><strong>Do Not Interfere With Law Enforcement</strong></h3><p>While the weight of legal authority provides that individuals have a First Amendment right to record law enforcement, courts have also stated one important caveat: you may not interfere with officers doing their jobs.</p><p>The&nbsp;<a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=4027403108062769854\">Seventh Circuit</a>, for example, said, “Nothing we have said here immunizes behavior that obstructs or interferes with effective law enforcement or the protection of public safety.” The court further stated, “While an officer surely cannot issue a ‘move on’ order to a person&nbsp;&nbsp;he is recording, the police may order bystanders to disperse for reasons related to public safety and order and other legitimate law enforcement needs.”</p><p>Just because you have the right, however, does not mean law enforcement will always acknowledge and uphold your right in that moment.

While the job title may be the same, as I’ve seen over the years, data engineers often fall into two distinct archetypes: the \"businessy\" data engineer and the \"techy\" data engineer as I like to call them. In this blog post, we will explore these two archetypes, their characteristics, and their contributions to the world of data engineering.</p><h2>The Businessy Data Engineer</h2><p>\\\nThese folks are all about solving business problems. They are passionate about tracking metrics, Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), and building interactive dashboards. Often, they have extensive SQL experience and possess coding skills in versatile languages like Python, ideal for data manipulation and analysis.</p><p>\\\n: Their primary focus on translating business needs into data solutions. They build data pipelines to collect, transform, and load data, enabling meaningful insights for decision-makers. These professionals are often referred to as Business Intelligence (BI) Engineers.</p><p>\\\n: A typical day may involve gathering requirements from stakeholders, designing dashboards, scripting in Python or SQL for data extraction and transformation, and collaborating with business teams to ensure data-driven decision-making.</p><p>\\\nOn the other hand, techy data engineers are drawn to solving scale problems. They thrive on exploring and implementing new technologies, and often prefer coding in languages like Scala or Java. They are responsible for building scalable data pipelines that can handle massive volumes of data.</p><p>\\\n: Techy data engineers focus on building and maintaining robust data infrastructure. They ensure that data pipelines are scalable, reliable, and capable of handling large datasets. They are proficient in tools like Apache Spark, Apache Flink and Apache Airflow, which are vital for processing vast amounts of data and know intricacies of cloud tools.</p><p>\\\n: A typical day for a techy data engineer might involve optimizing data pipelines, troubleshooting performance issues, experimenting with new data storage and processing technologies, and collaborating with data scientists to deploy machine learning models.</p><p>While these two archetypes of data engineers have distinct roles and responsibilities, there is immense potential when they work together. The businessy data engineer's ability to understand and translate business requirements complements the techy data engineer's expertise in building scalable solutions. The businessy folks understand what the suits want, and the techy folks build the data powerhouse to support those needs. Collaboration between these two types of data engineers can lead to the creation of powerful data-driven solutions. Teamwork makes the dream work, right?</p><p>\\\nNow, here's the thing: most data engineering training focuses on the techy side of things, leaving a gap for the businessy data engineer. We need content that showcases their role, assists individuals in identifying suitable job postings, and guides them on their learning journey.</p><p>\\\n<em>Which type do you identify with?</em></p>","contentLength":3154,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Fintech founder Charlie Javice’s criminal trial has begun","url":"https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/21/fintech-founder-charlie-javices-criminal-trial-has-begun/","date":1740164275,"author":"Mary Ann Azevedo","guid":8747,"unread":true,"content":"<p>The criminal trial against fintech startup founder Charlie Javice began on Friday, with lawyers laying out their opening arguments, Reuters reported.&nbsp; Lawyers reiterated their original claims and defenses from the lawsuit filed by JPMorgan Chase against Javice in December of 2022.

But no, they’ve decided that what we really need right now is to demolish the legal framework that makes online discourse possible.</p><p>(Forgive the lack of a profile image on that screenshot — at the time I made the screenshot literally every profile image on ExTwitter is just a gray circle, because things are operating greeeeeaaaat over there while the boss is away destroying the country).</p><p>Senator Dick Durbin, ranking member of the Judiciary Committee, has emerged with what can only be described as a masterclass in missing the point. In a <a href=\"https://www.durbin.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/durbin-delivers-opening-statement-during-senate-judiciary-committee-hearing-on-stopping-the-exploitation-of-children-online\">press release</a> that reads like it was written in an alternate universe where the biggest threat to democracy is… … website comment sections, Durbin announced his excitement about taking away Section 230.</p><blockquote><p><em>This week, Durbin will join U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham (R-SC), Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI), Josh Hawley (R-MO), Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), and Marsha Blackburn (R-TN) to introduce a bill that would sunset Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act in two years.&nbsp; Section 230—and the legal immunity it provides to Big Tech—has been on the books since 1996—long before social media became a part of our daily lives. To the extent this protection was ever needed, its usefulness has long since passed.</em></p></blockquote><p>Let’s unpack this for a moment. At a time when an unelected billionaire is effectively running the government via his own social media platform, Democrats have decided to partner with… … the very Republicans who’ve been helping enable this takeover, to eliminate the law that makes alternative social media platforms possible in the first place. </p><p>The thing is, this isn’t just regular old political malpractice — this is advanced political malpractice. We’ve <a href=\"https://www.techdirt.com/2021/01/11/dear-section-230-critics-when-senators-hawley-cruz-are-your-biggest-allies-time-to-rethink/\">known for years</a> that these same Republican senators have been quite open about their plans to <a href=\"https://www.techdirt.com/2023/09/06/marsha-blackburn-makes-it-clear-kosa-is-designed-to-silence-trans-people/\">use Section 230’s removal as a weapon against speech they don’t like</a>. It’s right there in their public statements! This isn’t some clever political chess move — it’s handing matches to an arsonist who has loudly declared his intention to burn your house down, while insisting it’s necessary to improve fire safety.</p><p>But Durbin’s fundamental mischaracterization of Section 230 as mere “legal immunity for big tech” betrays either willful ignorance or calculated misdirection. Section 230 is, at its core, a shield for  – your speech, my speech, everyone’s speech. <a href=\"https://www.techdirt.com/2019/04/17/stop-saying-that-section-230-was-gift-to-internet-companies/\">It protects individuals and small websites</a> far more than it protects Silicon Valley giants. It’s what keeps you safe when you forward an email or share a post. It’s what enables sites for people to review doctors or mechanics or employers. It’s what makes it possible for Wikipedia to exist. It’s what enables the very digital discourse we need to maintain democracy.</p><p>The dumbest part: removing Section 230 would actually <em>entrench Big Tech’s power</em>, not diminish it. The giants would survive just fine — most cases against them would still fail on First Amendment grounds. But defending speech under the First Amendment is <a href=\"https://www.techdirt.com/2019/04/18/new-paper-why-section-230-is-better-than-first-amendment/\">far more complex and expensive</a> than Section 230’s straightforward protections. Meta, Google, and their ilk have armies of lawyers to handle this. Everyone else? Not so much.</p><p>This explains why Mark Zuckerberg has been <a href=\"https://www.techdirt.com/2020/02/18/mark-zuckerberg-suggests-getting-rid-section-230-maybe-people-should-stop-pretending-gift-to-facebook/\">practically begging Congress to eliminate Section 230</a>. It’s not because he suddenly developed a burning passion for content moderation reform. It’s because he’s looked at the math and realized: “Hey, we can afford buildings full of lawyers. Our competitors can’t.” When Zuckerberg advocates for eliminating Section 230, he’s not confessing his sins — he’s pitching his business plan.</p><p>Without Section 230 “Big Tech” would be fine. First of all, in nearly all cases that are filed against websites would still lose, because almost all of these decisions are <a href=\"https://www.techdirt.com/2020/11/02/your-problem-is-not-with-section-230-1st-amendment/\">protected by the First Amendment</a>. But — and this is the important part — having to defend it under the First Amendment is <a href=\"https://www.techdirt.com/2019/04/18/new-paper-why-section-230-is-better-than-first-amendment/\">way more expensive</a>. And takes way longer. Which means that smaller defendants, especially, will likely cave in to threats.</p><p>The end result? <a href=\"https://www.techdirt.com/2024/05/28/wanna-make-big-tech-monopolies-even-worse-kill-section-230/\">Big Tech gets bigger</a>, smaller platforms disappear, and the “monopolies” that Durbin claims to be fighting become actual monopolies — now with congressional approval! It’s like trying to punish Standard Oil by making it illegal for anyone except Standard Oil to sell kerosene.</p><p>Durbin’s claim that Section 230’s “usefulness has long since passed” isn’t just wrong — it’s dangerous. The law is more vital now than ever, as <a href=\"https://www.techdirt.com/2024/05/21/five-section-230-cases-that-made-online-communities-better/\">demonstrated by countless cases</a> where it’s protected essential online discourse. At a moment when we desperately need more venues for protected speech and democratic dialogue, Durbin is proposing to demolish the very framework that makes such dialogue possible.</p><p>The consequences would be predictable and devastating: a cascade of frivolous lawsuits designed to silence critics and suppress inconvenient truths. Without Section 230’s efficient dismissal process, even completely baseless legal threats become effective censorship tools. Think about it: if you’re running a small community forum and someone threatens to sue you because they don’t like a user’s post about their business, what are you going to do? Spend hundreds of thousands of dollars defending your First Amendment rights, or just take down the post? This isn’t theoretical — it’s basic economics.</p><p>The end result is that it becomes that much easier to suppress dissent.</p><p>The timing of this crusade against Section 230 is particularly revealing. While democracy itself is under assault, while an unelected billionaire consolidates unprecedented power over government systems, Durbin has chosen to champion a proposal that would:</p><ol><li>Make Big Tech even more powerful</li><li>Hand MAGA forces a powerful weapon for silencing opposition through legal harassment</li><li>Cripple the digital infrastructure needed for organizing democratic resistance</li></ol><p>This isn’t just Durbin being out of touch — though at 80 years old, that’s certainly part of it. This is a catastrophic misreading of both technology and democracy that would be almost comical if it weren’t so dangerous. Here we have a Democratic leader eagerly collaborating with the very senators actively undermining democracy, on legislation that would further enable their authoritarian aims, while apparently convinced he’s doing something about “Big Tech.” </p><p>The Democrats desperately need new leadership, and not just because Durbin doesn’t understand how the internet works.

Trevor Lee</a> is not going to like this headline. Too bad. It’s accurate, even if he’d like to pretend it isn’t.</p><p>Trevor Lee is again pushing a bill that would ban government agencies from displaying pride flags, but would allow Nazi and Confederate flags to be displayed in classrooms, so long as they are part of the so-called educational experience.</p><p>This bill originally only targeted schools, but the first amending of the bill expanded its coverage to all government entities, state and local. <a href=\"https://www.sltrib.com/news/politics/2025/02/13/nazi-flags-can-fly-utah-school-not/\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"https://www.sltrib.com/news/politics/2025/02/13/nazi-flags-can-fly-utah-school-not/\">Here’s the Salt Lake Tribune’s original reporting</a> that managed to anger Rep. Lee so much he demanded a retraction: </p><blockquote><p><em>The bill,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://le.utah.gov/Session/2025/bills/introduced/CP%20HB0077%20To%20HB0077S01.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"></a>, originally applied only to schools. But an update to the bill released ahead of Thursday’s House Education Committee hearing expands the ban to all government buildings or property. The updated bill was favorably recommended by the committee, with the committee’s two Democrats — Reps. Sahara Hayes and Carol Moss — casting the only “nays.” It will now be heard on the full House floor.</em></p><p><em>Approved flags for display in government buildings and schools would include the Utah state and U.S. flags, military flags, flags for other countries, flags for Native American tribes and official flags for colleges and universities. The bill also allows for the flying of a “historic version of a flag … that is temporarily displayed for educational purposes,” which Lee, R-Layton, said would include the Confederate and Nazi flags.</em></p></blockquote><p>Shortly after this was published, the bill was amended to make it exactly as bad as Trevor Lee’s defense of his original bill in its un-amended form. While this was happening, Rep. Lee was going after the Salt Lake City Tribune, claiming it was spreading lies by publishing direct quotes of things he said while trying to push his bill forward. </p><blockquote><p><em>“There are instances where in classrooms, you have curriculum that is needed to use flags such as World War II, Civil War,” he said. “You may have a Nazi flag. You may have a Confederate flag, and so you are allowed to display those flags for the purpose of those lesson plans if it’s part of the curriculum, and that is okay.”</em></p></blockquote><p>And here’s what he said after the Tribune posted its report with a headline that said (completely truthfully) that the bill would ban displays of the pride flag in schools but allow the display of Nazi and Confederate flags.</p><blockquote><p><em>In an interview that night, Lee denied that he ever said there would be instances where a teacher could “display” a Nazi flag, and expressed displeasure that The Tribune would publish his testimony about displaying Nazi and Confederate flags in classrooms.</em></p><p><em>“There is a difference between displaying flags in curriculum when you’re teaching on them,” he said. “You don’t censor history here. That’s not what we’re doing.” When asked to further explain his remarks, Lee hung up the phone.</em></p></blockquote><p>Well, a pride flag is also a historical flag, but there appears to be no exception specifically written into the law to allow its use “in curriculum.” And when Lee’s extended explanation was [checks notes] hanging up the phone, it’s completely fair to categorize the bill as a ban on pride flags, while allowing exceptions for symbols of hate, provided any teacher with the temerity to insist the only way to teach history is to display these symbols of hate in their classrooms, rather than just rely on depictions contained in textbooks or presentations.</p><p>Hanging up on Tribune reporters wasn’t enough for Rep. Lee. He insisted on having the last, insipidly incoherent, word. </p><blockquote><p><em>Asked Friday morning about the amended bill, Lee commented only on the headline of the previous story on his bill. “Redact your ridiculous headline,” he wrote in a text message, before adding that The Tribune should “apologize for sowing divide and spreading hate to the general public.”</em></p></blockquote><p>Sowing divide and spreading hate is pretty much Rep. Lee’s day job. The representative prefers the reporting of another Utah News source, <a href=\"https://x.com/VoteTrevorLee/status/1890254568858198104\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"https://x.com/VoteTrevorLee/status/1890254568858198104\">touting its article</a> on the preferred platform for sowing divide and spreading hate: xTwitter.</p><blockquote><p><em>A ban on MAGA and Pride flags? GOP lawmakers say yes for cities, counties and classrooms</em></p></blockquote><p>While it’s true the bill would (perhaps accidentally) forbid displaying the MAGA flag, there was literally no one mentioning their opposition to government workers displaying MAGA flags. That might be because no government employee has. It also might be that several have done this but no “concerned citizen” has bothered to complain about it during comment periods. </p><p>In fact, the only incident described in public testimony about the law is something that probably never happened, at least not in the way it’s described here.</p><blockquote><p><em>Two years ago, Lehi resident Aaron Bullen’s 10-year-old son came home upset from elementary school because a rainbow flag had been placed in his computer lab, he told the committee.</em></p><p><em>The rainbow, or pride, flag, which represents LGBTQ acceptance, was taken down after a complaint was made to the principal, but it temporarily allowed the school to promote a symbol that was offensive to his son, Bullen said.</em></p><p><em>“This message conflicts with my family’s religious beliefs. It tells my son that his faith, his parents and his values are wrong,” Bullen said. “That is not neutrality; that is religious discrimination at a public institution.”</em></p></blockquote><p>Aaron Bullen is a ridiculous person and is telling a ridiculous story. I cannot imagine a ten-year-old coming home distraught because they saw a flag in a classroom. I can certainly imagine them  it and their parents getting all shitty about it because of their own ingrained bigotry. And a flag does not “conflict” with “religious beliefs,” no matter what’s on it. You still get to keep your religious beliefs. No flag can take that away from you. And calling it “religious discrimination” is especially stupid and inadvertently hilarious because, as far as I can tell, sexual orientation is not a religion. </p><p>For all of Rep. Lee’s claims that this is about preventing the display of “divisive” flags (which may include MAGA flags), the real point of this bill is exactly how it’s described in the Tribune article that turned Lee into a corncob. He has <a href=\"https://x.com/VoteTrevorLee/status/1875288639670022483\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"https://x.com/VoteTrevorLee/status/1875288639670022483\">admitted as much on ExTwitter</a>:</p><p>If you can’t see the embed, it says:</p><blockquote><p><em>My bill specifies which flags can be displayed in classrooms. It would ban Pride flags from schools. Parents could sue the school district if it’s violated.</em></p></blockquote><p>His private ExTwitter account (which was public until journalists started digging into his hateful posts during his election run) is even worse than his official one. <a href=\"https://archive.ph/ikig9\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"https://archive.ph/ikig9\">A long article detailing his social media activity</a> shows Rep. Lee spent years using anti-LGBTQ+ slurs, insulting the looks of female politicians and judges he didn’t agree with, spreading 2020 election conspiracies, and engaging with others as an avid supporter of a Latter Day Saints splinter group that advocates against the perceived “wokeness” of the religion’s current leadership.</p><p>So, when Lee says (before acting like yelling and hanging up on people is some form of rebuttal) he will outlaw pride flags but provide exceptions for Nazi and Confederate flags, it’s best to take him at his word. And if he doesn’t like the headlines it generates, maybe he should do something to stop generating them… like dropping the bill or just not being the sort of asshole who prefers Nazi flags to rainbows.</p>","contentLength":7460,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"EFF at RightsCon 2025","url":"https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2025/02/eff-rightscon-2025","date":1740159097,"author":"Paige Collings","guid":8718,"unread":true,"content":"<p><a href=\"https://www.rightscon.org/\"></a></p><ul></ul><h3><strong>Day 0 (Monday 24 February)</strong></h3><h4><strong>Mutual Support: Amplifying the Voices of Digital Rights Defenders in Taiwan and East Asia</strong></h4><p><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdkVBkvqzWzf0dTtnXpAnipWUxCH0vsDqwtr8s55WbvnnIXCw/viewform\"></a></p><h4>Platform accountability in crisis?

Specifically, people who work on HHS websites are spending days scanning those sites and any documents they share in search of a list terms like “gay,” “sexuality,” “non-binary,” “inclusion,” “queer,” and “gender,” potentially so they could be later removed to comply with Trump’s executive orders attacking diversity, equity, and inclusion in the federal government.</p><p>“The most obvious issue to me about this list is that it’s being done in the name of ‘efficiency and saving money.’ It is not efficient to take engineers off their work to scan old content for any keywords this new administration hates. The bigotry is astounding,” the source who is familiar with the work and who asked to be anonymous because they were not permitted to speak to the press, told me. “If they were being true to the concept, sure, they could say that moving forward, we will no longer support creation of new data about these topics. But to go backward decades, scrubbing for stuff they hate, that’s not a savings of time and money, that’s a huge expenditure. It's hypocritical on top of it all.”</p><div><div><b><strong>Do you know anything else about DOGE and how Trump's executive orders are impacting HHS or other agencies? I would love to hear from you. Using a non-work device, you can message me securely on Signal at ‪emanuel.404‬. Otherwise, send me an email at emanuel@404media.co.</strong></b></div></div><p>The source said that part of what makes the work so time consuming is that the current HHS administration doesn’t just want to know about every page on its sites that include these terms, but also pages that link out to .PDF files that include those terms. For example, last week we reported that the Trump administration <a href=\"https://www.404media.co/trump-admin-adds-note-rejecting-gender-ideology-on-sites-court-ordered-them-to-restore/\"><u>added a note rejecting “gender ideology”</u></a> on a <a href=\"https://www.samhsa.gov/data/report/lgb-adolescent-behavioral-health-2023?ref=404media.co\"><u>Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration’s website</u></a> page that shared a .PDF of a study about substance abuse among gay, lesbian, bisexual, or other nonheterosexual adolescents. According to the source, HHS administrators want that page added to a spreadsheet of pages and documents that include the terms it's looking for because of the content of the study.&nbsp;</p><p>Since HHS websites share thousands of .PDFs, the source said, “very expensive” engineers spent multiple days scanning the files for the list of terms instead of doing their regular tasks.&nbsp;</p><p>Other terms on the list include “they/them” pronouns, “pregnant ‘people,’” “Biden,” and “intersex,” according to a copy of the list seen by 404 Media.</p><p>The fact that the government is wasting resources finding every instance of a term it finds objectionable directly contradicts Trump’s and Musk’s stated goal of “government efficiency.” Finding these terms in thousands of studies and papers and potentially removing them is not saving any taxpayer dollars, but just purging government sites with a perspective it disagrees with. Other agencies have also scrambled to find similar terms. <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/2025/02/05/doge-noaa-dei-information-search?ref=404media.co\"> reported</a> that DOGE representatives at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration are searching for “DEI content” and <a href=\"https://www.statnews.com/2025/02/13/trump-dei-ban-banned-words-list-scrambles-research-nih-veterans-affairs/?ref=404media.co\"></a> has reported that a number of federal health agencies are searching grants for “taboo words” like “trans” and “diversity.”&nbsp;</p><p>“The spitefulness is such a waste of time and money. It's infuriating,” the source said. “Sure, they might argue not to do anything inclusive or helpful in the future, but to burn so much time and money trying to scrub out any content he [Trump] hates from past decades is ...

We proposed the first nearly-linear time coreset algorithm for k-median and k-means. Moreover, the algorithm can be parameterized to achieve an asymptotically optimal coreset size. Subsequently, we conducted a thorough experimental analysis comparing this algorithm with fast sampling heuristics. In doing so, we find that although the Fast-Coreset algorithm achieves the best compression guarantees among its competitors, naive uniform sampling is already a sufficient compression for downstream clustering tasks in well-behaved datasets. Furthermore, we find that intermediate heuristics interpolating between uniform sampling and coresets play an important role in balancing efficiency and accuracy.</p><p>\\\nAlthough this closes the door on the highly-studied problem of optimally small and fast coresets for k-median and k-means, open questions of wider scope still remain. For example, when does sensitivity sampling guarantee accurate compression with optimal space in linear time and can these conditions be formalized? Furthermore, sensitivity sampling is incompatible with paradigms such as fair-clustering [8, 15, 21, 43, 56] and it is unclear whether one can expect that a linear-time method can optimally compress a dataset while adhering to the fairness constraints.</p><p>Andrew Draganov and Chris Schwiegelshohn are partially supported by the Independent Research Fund Denmark (DFF) under a Sapere Aude Research Leader grant No 1051-00106B.

In a bustling Osaka station, commuters may soon encounter real-time 3D digital guides as part of a new urban initiative. <a href=\"https://www.mawari.net\">Mawari</a> has partnered with Nankai Electric Railway Co., Ltd., Meta Osaka Co., Ltd., and e-stadium Co., Ltd. to launch Digital Entertainment City Namba, a project that will integrate AI-driven 3D avatars, extended reality (XR), and decentralized physical infrastructure (DePIN) across the city. The initiative will deploy AI agents capable of providing tourist guidance and customer service in public spaces using real-time 3D streaming and edge computing devices installed throughout Nankai’s network.</p><p>\\\nThe project aims to transform traditional transit spaces into interactive digital hubs. By combining AI, XR, and DePIN, the new ecosystem seeks to support multilingual assistance for tourists and create flexible employment opportunities for remote workers and others. Mawari, with experience from over 50 XR projects globally, will use its patented technology to manage the high-quality streaming of digital content while reducing bandwidth requirements.</p><p>\\\nLocal stakeholders emphasize that the project is expected to enhance urban engagement and improve the overall experience of public spaces. Nankai Electric Railway, one of Japan’s long-established transportation providers, is positioning the initiative as a way to modernize its stations and surrounding areas. Meta Osaka and e-stadium contribute their expertise in regional development and digital strategy to help shape the project’s implementation.</p><p>The Digital Entertainment City Namba project marks a notable experiment in blending digital and physical urban experiences at a city-wide scale. While the initiative may improve user engagement and support local economies through innovative digital services, it also invites careful scrutiny regarding infrastructure resilience and digital accessibility for all citizens. Observers will be keen to see how this integrated approach performs as a model for future urban development.</p><p>\\\nMawari, serving as the principal client in this collaboration, underscores its commitment to pushing the boundaries of spatial computing. Building on a legacy of over 50 XR projects worldwide, Mawari leverages its cutting-edge edge compute solutions and real-time 3D streaming to forge an urban landscape that blends digital innovation with everyday life. The company’s strategic investment in decentralized infrastructure aims to not only enhance public interaction through lifelike AI avatars but also set a replicable model for smart city initiatives globally. This venture reaffirms Mawari’s vision of making immersive digital experiences accessible, efficient, and transformative for communities across Osaka.</p><p>\\\nDon’t forget to like and share the story! </p><p>:::tip\n<strong>Vested Interest Disclosure:</strong>&nbsp;This author is an independent contributor publishing via our&nbsp;.

It was the ultimate victory in a generational war on accountability by consolidated corporate power and rich assholes. </p><p>Falsely framed as some sort of “<a href=\"https://www.davispolk.com/insights/client-update/supreme-court-rebalances-administrative-state\">noble rebalancing of constitutional authority</a>” by bad faith lobbyists and think tankers, the goal wasn’t “balanced regulation” or “reining in out of control regulators,” it was the <strong>dismantling of nearly all meaningful corporate oversight</strong>. So even before Trump won the election, labor rights, consumer protection, environmental law, and public safety were already in  serious trouble. </p><p>Now Trump has come out with an Executive Order that attempts to finish the job. The misleadingly named “<a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/02/ensuring-accountability-for-all-agencies/\">Ensuring Accountability For All Agencies</a>” effectively tries to declare that no U.S. regulatory agency can do much of anything without the explicit approval of a mad king. </p><p>An accompanying “<a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/fact-sheets/2025/02/fact-sheet-president-donald-j-trump-reins-in-independent-agencies-to-restore-a-government-that-answers-to-the-american-people/\">fact sheet</a>” proclaims that “so called” agencies like the FCC and FTC will not be able to take any actions that contradict the will of the President:</p><blockquote><p><em>“No employee of the executive branch acting in their official capacity may advance an interpretation of the law as the position of the United States that contravenes the President or the Attorney General’s opinion on a matter of law, including but not limited to the issuance of regulations, guidance, and positions advanced in litigation, unless authorized to do so by the President or in writing by the Attorney General.”</em></p></blockquote><p>The EO requires that all U.S. regulatory agencies must “submit for review all proposed and final significant regulatory actions to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA) within the Executive Office of the President before publication in the Federal Register.” It also declares the President will “adjust so-called independent agencies’ apportionments to ensure tax dollars are spent wisely.”</p><p>It basically ensures that even if our captured regulators  somehow come up with a coherent proposal that challenges corporate power (already a rarity thanks to the corrupt, <a href=\"https://www.citizen.org/news/a-whopping-75-of-ftc-officials-have-revolving-door-conflicts-with-tech-corporations-and-other-industries/\">revolving door nature</a> of most agencies), the President has the exclusive right to kill it, regardless of whether or not it’s within the confines of Congressional approval, or broadly, democratically popular. </p><p>The axing of Chevron had  made it so regulators can’t do much of anything without the explicit approval of Congress. Proponents wanted you to ignore that Congress and our court system are too corrupt to function, ensuring that pretty much  that challenges corporate or billionaire power will be declared  and . </p><p>These efforts willsteadily have disastrous downstream impacts that  kill people at scale across countless sectors. But most of the media <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/trump-order-agency-independent-regulator-b3f13291374d91491a13f164b402f51b\">coverage</a> I <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/18/us/trump-executive-order-sec-ftc-fcc.html?unlocked_article_code=1.yU4.SahY.d3NAsIRDBwP1&amp;smid=url-share\">read about it</a> has a bizarre, clinical detachment that puts the reader to sleep by the fourth paragraph, and fails to convey any sense of the dire stakes at play. </p><p>Despite what big companies and billionaires might tell you, U.S. regulators have already been on the ropes for years. They’re generally understaffed, under-funded, stocked with only the kind of dull careerists that can survive the corrupt congressional nomination process (see: <a href=\"https://www.techdirt.com/2023/03/07/telecom-monopolies-win-again-gigi-sohn-forced-to-withdraw-from-fcc-nomination/\">what happened to Gigi Sohn</a>), and boxed in by industry lobbying, a very broken Congress, and a steady parade of shitty court rulings. </p><p>I’ve covered the FCC for decades. The agency rarely actually tries to seriously protect consumers. And when it does try (<a href=\"https://www.techdirt.com/2024/11/21/net-neutrality-is-dead-as-a-doornail-under-trump-2-0/\">net neutrality</a>, <a href=\"https://www.techdirt.com/2017/03/28/consumer-broadband-privacy-protections-are-dead/\">privacy</a>), those efforts routinely never last long in the face of corruption. Real consumer protection almost uniformly fails. Still, somehow in Republican and Libertarian circles a narrative has long been entrenched that agencies like the FCC have been “running amok.” </p><p>That narrative persists because of its value in selling a lie: what most of these billionaires and companies want isn’t reasonable regulation, or sensible, well crafted oversight: it’s . Freedom to rip off consumers, to pollute, to violate labor law, and to generally misbehave in the quest for improved quarterly earnings with zero accountability. Freedom to “innovate” and acquire and consume and expand with <em>zero concern about the downstream impact of bad choices</em>.</p><p>As I saw these efforts unfolding last year I got increasingly vocal about it, but was often met by an arched eyebrow by cocksure policy tut-scolds, drunk on normalization bias, confident that the . Well, the system is not holding. We’re entering the golden age of fraud and corruption.</p><p>As with everything Trump, this is extremely legally dodgy and will indisputably see a court challenge. But collectively between this, DOGE, and the Supreme Court’s locked-in majority, it’s hard to believe U.S. regulators will coherently function with any sort of independence from corporate power and petulant billionaires for a very, very long time. </p><p>Even under the best case scenario where the electorate tires of the coming cascading system failures and puts an end to our dipshit kakistocracy, reversing the damage in a system now specifically designed to prevent progressive reform will be a very steep uphill climb. </p><p>That’s not to say we <em>can’t survive and build better things</em>. The destruction of coherent federal governance shifts most battles to the local and state level. The country can still function as a loose assortment of fractured nation states each with their varying degrees of labor protection, consumer rights, and environmental protection. Which state you live in suddenly matters more than ever. </p><p>But for now, any dream of unified, federal coherence or corporate oversight has been murdered by a loose collection of sociopaths and self-serving Dunning Kruger hustlebros, keen on stripping and selling the American experiment for scrap off the back loading dock. </p>","contentLength":6049,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Ubuntu 25.04 Working On More Improvements For Snapdragon X1 Elite Laptop Support","url":"https://www.phoronix.com/news/Ubuntu-25.04-More-X1E","date":1740144600,"author":"Michael Larabel","guid":8601,"unread":true,"content":"<article>We are nearing one year since the first Qualcomm Snapdragon X1 Elite laptops shipped with Windows 11 ARM.
