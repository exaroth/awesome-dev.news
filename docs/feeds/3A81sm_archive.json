A study reconstructed wild weather events through the eyes of record-keepers during this fraught period, opening a tantalizing window into climate extremes unleashed by a vengeful God (according to contemporary reports).</p><p>Then: making love the medaka way (get those anal fins ready). Next, the chillest insect in Antarctica (also: the only one). Finally, these turtles will dance for food, and yes, it’s very cute.</p><h3><strong>The Haunting Weather Reports of 16th Century Transylvania</strong></h3><p>Rejoice, for this week has delivered one of the best varieties of study: Science via historical documents. Sure, ice cores and geological strata are great for reconstructing past climates, but nobody can bitch about the weather better than a good old-fashioned red-blooded member of team .&nbsp;</p><p>To that end, researchers searched for mentions of weird weather across a trove of diaries, monastery records, travel notes, and other documents from 16th century Transylvania, during a “pivotal moment in climate history” when a centuries-long cooling event called the Little Ice Age intensified, according to researchers led by Ovidiu Răzvan Gaceu of the University of Oradea.&nbsp;</p><p>These types of studies are packed with colorful human testimonies that can corroborate natural records. More importantly, though, they are just fun to read, especially during such an evocative time and place, freshly haunted by the vampiric spirit of Vlad the Impaler. Some highlights:</p><p>In August 1526, heavy rainfall caused freak floods in Braşov that “washed the walls of the fortress, demolished the main gate, and the fish also got caught in the big church,” according to the Annals of Brașov. Fish in the church! The ultimate baptism.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;In autumn 1553, people in the city of Cluj reported unusual weather events including “October strawberries.” For real, October is for pumpkins, get out of here with the strawbs. Turned out it was a bad omen—there was a plague the following winter. Keep that in mind if you see any late autumn strawberries: Kill on sight.</p><p>Naturally, a lot of these accounts are heartbreaking. Locusts “sometimes covered the whole sky and destroyed grain crops” and caused terrible famines. A storm-related fire “killed 14 people and made 60 poor.” On September 29, 1582, “there was such a big storm, as it was said that it had never been seen before in the city of Cluj, which uprooted the trees and raised the roofs of the houses, people believed that it is sent by divinity to punish the crimes committed by them.”&nbsp;</p><p>I mean, I’m not saying these people weren’t doing crimes. It’s 16th century Transylvania. Do what you gotta do. But that's not why there is extreme weather. You’re just in the Little Ice Age.&nbsp;</p><p>The study ultimately identified “multiple pieces of evidence associated with extreme weather events, including 40 unusually warm summers and several years of excess precipitation or drought.” Taken together with natural archives, the documents paint a picture of troubled times, exacerbated by an unstable climate and possible emergent vampires. Relatable!&nbsp;</p><p>Valentine’s Day is over, but the romantic mood is still in the air—or in the water, if you’re a medaka (flawless segue). Scientists have discovered that wild medaka, also known as Japanese rice fish, are fans of late-night booty calls, which is a behavior that has not been observed in captivity.</p><p>“Although medaka and other model organisms are invaluable in laboratories, their ecology in the wild remains largely unknown,” said researchers led by Yuki Kondo of Osaka Metropolitan University. “This study showed that medaka in the wild initiate spawning during late nocturnal hours and exhibit vigorous courtship behavior at midnight.”</p><p>Kondo and her colleagues recorded this vigorous courtship by placing GoPros into streams over the course of several summer nights in Gifu, Japan. The tapes revealed that medaka like to spawn in the dark, possibly to avoid predators during copulation. The results “provide the first empirical evidence that medaka mating begins significantly earlier than previously reported in the laboratory.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>For anyone who feels clueless about courtship, may I offer a page from the Medaka Sutra:&nbsp;</p><p>“The spawning behavior of medaka follows a sequence of events: the male chases the female (following), the male swims rapidly around the female (quick circle), the male wraps his dorsal and anal fins around the female (wrapping), the female releases eggs, the male releases sperm (egg and sperm release), and the male leaves the female (leaving),” according to Kondo’s team.</p><p>The only true love language is, indeed, spoken with anal fins.</p><p>Major bonus points also go to Osaka Metropolitan University’s press team for <a href=\"https://www.eurekalert.org/multimedia/1058890?ref=404media.co\"><u>throwing together this version</u></a> of Edward Hopper’s famous “Nighthawks” painting with medaka getting drinks at a bar that is also named Medaka. It is genuinely one of the most inspired public relations efforts I have ever seen, and I’m going to get a print of it to hang on my wall.</p><h3><strong>The Insect at the Edge of Earth</strong></h3><p>, or the Antarctic midge, is the only insect that lives year-round on its namesake continent. Do you know how weird you have to be to be the  insect somewhere? But this midge doesn’t care. It just lives out its bug life, which lasts two years, in an otherwise bugless wasteland.&nbsp;</p><p>Humans definitely care about the midge, though—how could we not? What is it doing there? How is it not dead? What can it teach us about cryopreservation? These questions are addressed in a new study that resolved mysteries about the animal’s interesting life cycle.</p><p>“Freeze tolerance and cryoprotective dehydration are cold tolerance strategies used by various invertebrate species in polar regions and indeed,  utilises both for overwintering,” said researchers led by Mizuki Yoshida of the Ohio State University, who completed the project while at Osaka Metropolitan University (OMU killing it this week).&nbsp;</p><p>“Larvae that are frozen in ice and cryoprotectively dehydrated readily survived 32 days of simulated overwintering,” the team said. “Unlike many insects restricted to highly specific microhabitats,  larvae inhabit a remarkably diverse range of substrates that differ in vegetation, substrate type, slope, drainage, and thermal and hydric conditions.”</p><p>I love the phrasing of “readily survived” as if the midges were eager to show off their cryoprotective superpowers. After this 32-day period they emerged with “That all you got?” energy. By studying the bugs in these simulated conditions, the researchers confirmed that they rely on multiple overwintering strategies, including a state of arrested development called “obligate diapause.”&nbsp;</p><p>“Diapause has long been assumed to be uncommon in Antarctic species, but the present study reveals that  utilises diapause for seasonal adaptation, as in many temperate species,” Yoshida and her colleagues said.&nbsp;</p><p>In addition to being the only endemic Antarctic insect, this midge has the smallest genome of any known insect while also being the largest fully terrestrial animal on the continent, even though it’s only a few millimeters long. In other words, it is the biggest animal in Antarctica that doesn’t fly or swim. Okay, Antarctic midge. You just keep doing you.</p><p>Last, turtles do a little victory dance when they find food. Yes, it is cute. Yes, there is a video.</p><p>The footage (along with <a href=\"https://youtu.be/IcI6yHr6JXo?si=DAGsav7HY4S3uhKn&amp;ref=404media.co\"></a>) is part of a study that tested if turtles could distinguish the magnetic signatures of two geographical areas. When the turtles were exposed to signatures associated with an area they associated with food, they danced in anticipation of a meal, demonstrating that they could tell the signals apart—and party accordingly.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>“Hallmarks of the behaviour include some or all of the following: tilting the body vertically, holding the head near or above water, opening the mouth, rapid alternating movement of the front flippers, and, occasionally, even spinning in place, hence the name ‘turtle dance,’” said researchers led by Kayla Goforth of Texas A&amp;M University. “Turtles exhibited significantly higher levels of turtle dance behaviour when experiencing the field in which they had been fed.”</p><p>With that, let’s all tilt vertically, spin in place, and shell-abrate the long weekend.&nbsp;</p><p>Thanks for reading!

From the report: With Elon Musk's so-called Department of Government Efficiency installing itself at the IRS amid a broader push to replace federal bureaucracy with machine-learning software, the tax agency's computing center in Martinsburg, West Virginia, will soon be home to a state-of-the-art Nvidia SuperPod AI computing cluster. According to the previously unreported February 5 acquisition document, the setup will combine 31 separate Nvidia servers, each containing eight of the company's flagship Blackwell processors designed to train and operate artificial intelligence models that power tools like ChatGPT. The hardware has not yet been purchased and installed, nor is a price listed, but SuperPod systems reportedly start at $7 million. The setup described in the contract materials notes that it will include a substantial memory upgrade from Nvidia.\n \nThough small compared to the massive AI-training data centers deployed by companies like OpenAI and Meta, the SuperPod is still a powerful and expensive setup using the most advanced technology offered by Nvidia, whose chips have facilitated the global machine-learning spree. While the hardware can be used in many ways, it's marketed as a turnkey means of creating and querying an AI model. Last year, the MITRE Corporation, a federally funded military R&amp;D lab, acquired a $20 million SuperPod setup to train bespoke AI models for use by government agencies, touting the purchase as a \"massive increase in computing power\" for the United States.\n \nHow exactly the IRS will use its SuperPod is unclear. An agency spokesperson said the IRS had no information to share on the supercomputer purchase, including which presidential administration ordered it. A 2024 report by the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration identified 68 different AI-related projects underway at the IRS; the Nvidia cluster is not named among them, though many were redacted. But some clues can be gleaned from the purchase materials. \"The IRS requires a robust and scalable infrastructure that can handle complex machine learning (ML) workloads,\" the document explains. \"The Nvidia Super Pod is a critical component of this infrastructure, providing the necessary compute power, storage, and networking capabilities to support the development and deployment of large-scale ML models.\"\n \nThe document notes that the SuperPod will be run by the IRS Research, Applied Analytics, and Statistics division, or RAAS, which leads a variety of data-centric initiatives at the agency. While no specific uses are cited, it states that this division's Compliance Data Warehouse project, which is behind this SuperPod purchase, has previously used machine learning for automated fraud detection, identity theft prevention, and generally gaining a \"deeper understanding of the mechanisms that drive taxpayer behavior.\"","contentLength":3057,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Karol Herbst Steps Down As Nouveau Maintainer Due To Linux Kernel's Toxic Environment","url":"https://www.phoronix.com/news/Karol-Herbst-Nouveau-No","date":1739619627,"author":"Michael Larabel","guid":711,"unread":true,"content":"<article>Karol Herbst has been a Nouveau driver developer for over a decade working on this open-source, reverse-engineered NVIDIA Linux graphics driver.

The Guardian reports: The authors used a two-part approach, first looking into the frequency with which over 3,000 people in China ate from plastic takeout containers, and whether they had heart disease. They then exposed rats to plastic chemicals in water that was boiled and poured in carryout containers to extract chemicals. \"The data revealed that high-frequency exposure to plastics is significantly associated with an increased risk of congestive heart failure,\" the authors wrote. [...] They put boiling water in the containers for one, five or 15 minutes because plastic chemicals leach at much higher rates when hot contents are placed in containers -- the study cited previous research that found as many as 4.2m microplastic particles per sq cm can leach from plastic containers that are microwaved.\n \nThe authors then gave rats the water contaminated with leachate to drink for several months, then analyzed the gut biome and metabolites in the feces. It found notable changes. \"It indicated that ingestion of these leachates altered the intestinal microenvironment, affected gut microbiota composition, and modified gut microbiota metabolites, particularly those linked to inflammation and oxidative stress,\" the authors wrote. They then checked the rats' heart muscle tissue and found it had been damaged. The study did not find a statistical difference in the changes and damage among rats that were exposed to water that had been in contact with plastic for one minute versus five or fifteen. The study has been published in the journal Ecotoxicology and Environmental Safety.","contentLength":1816,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"The TechBeat: Futures of Ethereum II - Censorship Resistance (2/15/2025)","url":"https://hackernoon.com/2-15-2025-techbeat?source=rss","date":1739603464,"author":"Techbeat","guid":242,"unread":true,"content":"<p>By <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/u/rootstock_io\">@rootstock_io</a> [ 3 Min read ] \n Rootstock merges Bitcoin’s security with Ethereum’s flexibility, enabling AI-driven blockchain apps for trustless governance, security, and fraud detection. <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/ai-meets-bitcoin-how-rootstock-powers-the-future-of-trustless-ai\">Read More.</a></p><p>By <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/u/boxhero\">@boxhero</a> [ 13 Min read ] \n Discover how AI-powered sentiment analysis tools deliver accurate insights from customer reviews and feedback to help improve your business strategy. <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/sentiment-analysis-and-ai-everything-you-need-to-know-in-2025\">Read More.</a></p><p>By <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/u/lumoz\">@lumoz</a> [ 3 Min read ] \n On February 13, Lumoz announced the official launch of Lumoz Chain and released the migration guide and reward plan for Verifier nodes.  <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/lumoz-flips-the-switch-on-its-ai-powered-blockchain\">Read More.</a></p><p>By <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/u/stellar\">@stellar</a> [ 5 Min read ] \n Regulatory shifts in 2025 will shape crypto wallets.

Ars Technica reports: The researchers started out by using the standard tools they developed to handle protein design, including an AI tool named RFDiffusion, which uses a random seed to generate a variety of protein backgrounds. In this case, the researchers asked RFDiffusion to match the average positions of the amino acids in a family of ester-breaking enzymes. The results were fed to another neural network, which chose the amino acids such that they'd form a pocket that would hold an ester that breaks down into a fluorescent molecule so they could follow the enzyme's activity using its glow.\n \nOf the 129 proteins designed by this software, only two of them resulted in any fluorescence. So the team decided they needed yet another AI. Called PLACER, the software was trained by taking all the known structures of proteins latched on to small molecules and randomizing some of their structure, forcing the AI to learn how to shift things back into a functional state (making it a generative AI). The hope was that PLACER would be trained to capture some of the structural details that allow enzymes to adopt more than one specific configuration over the course of the reaction they were catalyzing. And it worked. Repeating the same process with an added PLACER screening step boosted the number of enzymes with catalytic activity by over three-fold.\n \nUnfortunately, all of these enzymes stalled after a single reaction. It turns out they were much better at cleaving the ester, but they left one part of it chemically bonded to the enzyme. In other words, the enzymes acted like part of the reaction, not a catalyst. So the researchers started using PLACER to screen for structures that could adopt a key intermediate state of the reaction. This produced a much higher rate of reactive enzymes (18 percent of them cleaved the ester bond), and two -- named \"super\" and \"win\" -- could actually cycle through multiple rounds of reactions. The team had finally made an enzyme.\n \nBy adding additional rounds alternating between structure suggestions using RFDiffusion and screening using PLACER, the team saw the frequency of functional enzymes increase and eventually designed one that had an activity similar to some produced by actual living things. They also showed they could use the same process to design an esterase capable of digesting the bonds in PET, a common plastic. The research has been published in the journal Science.","contentLength":2629,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Reading Documentation Shouldn't Be a Chore","url":"https://hackernoon.com/reading-documentation-shouldnt-be-a-chore?source=rss","date":1739602109,"author":"Rami James","guid":241,"unread":true,"content":"<p>As a developer, documentation is both your greatest ally and your worst nemesis.

It provides the definitive guide to how software works, saving you countless hours of pointless, frustrating trial and error. Bad documentation is a nightmare. It's like trying to navigate a maze blindfolded, with no map and no sense of direction, guided by a liar.</p><p>\\\nIf you have access to the code you are working against, that's great and you should use it. Poke around and see what you're supposed to do by reading the code. But, in many cases (and almost all of the time with proprietary software), you're going to have to rely on the documentation to get you through. However, documentation can vary wildly in quality. Some is meticulously crafted, while others can be uninformative, outdated, or even misleading. This inconsistency is one of the reasons why reading documentation can be challenging.</p><p>Some docs are just a dumping ground for information, with no clear structure or organization. This can make it difficult to find what you're looking for, and you end up spending more time searching than actually learning. A well-structured set of documentation will have a clear table of contents, with sections and subsections that guide you through the material in a logical order. This makes it easier to navigate and find the information you need.In general, I'll also recommend some Getting Started section which points different types of users to the information which is most critical to them.</p><p>Information overload is another common hurdle. Docs can cover a vast range of features and functionalities, making it difficult to find the specific information you need. For example, a large framework might have hundreds of classes and methods, and trying to find the one you need can feel like searching for a needle in a haystack.</p><p>Unclear technical jargon can also be a barrier, as documentation is inherently technical, and sometimes the terminology can be confusing, especially for newcomers. This often stems from the assumption that the reader has a certain level of prior knowledge as it is largely written by the team who has developed the software and has an intimate knowledge of its innner workings.</p><p>Outdated information can be a major problem. Software evolves rapidly, and documentation can sometimes lag behind, leading to frustration and wasted time. A library might have deprecated a certain function, but the documentation might still describe it as the primary way to perform a task. The teams who produce software should be including accurate documentation creation and upkeep in their backlog as part of their process. Unfortunately, in the haste to get features shipped to market, corners are often cut. I've spent the better part of the last decade advocating for better processes that lead to better docs at a number of companies, and the biggest challenge here has been explaining to stakeholders where the value is.</p><h3>How to read documentation effectively</h3><p>Over the years, I've developed a structured approach to how I tackle reading new documentation. I've found that this approach helps me quickly get up to speed with new tools and technologies, and I hope it can help you too.</p><p>\\\nBy and large this method has three parts: understanding the structure of the documentation itself, understanding the way that the system I'm learning works, and lastly engaging with the material in the docs. First I get the lay of the land, and then I try to focus in on the details.</p><h4>Understand the structure of the documentation</h4><p>Docs are written by people, and every sysyem is going to be different. That means that every set of docs is going to be different. Some docs are organized by feature, others by use case, and still others by API endpoint. Understanding the structure of the documentation is key to finding the information you need quickly. Start by scanning the table of contents to get an overview of the topics covered. This will help you get a sense of the scope of the documentation and where to find specific information. You'll want to quickly click through the docs and get a sense of how things work, how they are organized, and where you can find reference materials if there are any.</p><p>\\\nI find that this initial run through also trickles some information about the system and its components into my brain. It's not comprehensive at all, but it's a good start.</p><p>Every piece of software is a system, and understanding how that system works is key to understanding how to use it. This is where the documentation can be a huge help. Good documentation will provide you with a high-level overview of the system, explaining how the different components fit together and how they interact. This can help you understand the context in which a particular feature or function is used, and how it relates to the rest of the system. This is where you start to get a sense of how the system is supposed to work, and how you can use it to solve your problems.</p><p>\\\nA lot of the problems that you'll encounter when building software will be because you fundamentally don't understand how what you're building with actually works. This is where the documentation can be a huge help. It can provide you with the context you need to understand how the system is supposed to work, and how you can use it to solve your problems. Use that to your advantage and you'll be able to build better software, faster.</p><p>This is often the most tedious and boring part. You have to actually take a few hours and read through the entire docs. For smaller libraries or APIs, this isn't going to be a big deal and you'll be able to fit most of it into your head. For larger systems, this is going to be a multi-day process. You'll want to take notes, ask questions, and engage with the material in a way that helps you understand it. This is where you start to get a sense of how the system is supposed to work, and how you can use it to solve your problems. If it doesn't all fit into your head now, that's ok. You'll remember more than you think you will, and when you're actually doing development it will be an order of magnitude faster to find an answer if you've already seen it once.</p><p>I've actually found that modern AIs are absolutely awesome for this step. You can use them as you would a more experienced developer and ask them questions about the system, the functionality, and the docs themselves. You can't trust everything that they say, but you can't really trust what another developer always tells you. I've found that being able to have a discussion with an AI about a library or API really helps me understand how stuff works at a deeper level.</p><h3>Strategies for effectively reading docs</h3><p>Despite these challenges, mastering the art of reading documentation is doable. Here are some strategies to keep in mind while you are digging around in docs, looking for an answer.</p><p>If you don't know where you're going, you may never get there. Before you dive into a set of docs, you may want to set a clear objective for yourself. Are you trying to understand a specific function, integrate a new library, or troubleshoot an error? Having a clear objective will help you focus your search.</p><p>\\\nFor example, if you're trying to fix a bug where a specific function isn't returning the expected value, and your code matches what the docs say that you're supposed to do, your goal is to understand the function's place in the wider system. The problem is going to be a few levels up and the docs are likely going to be the key to understanding how the software works at a higher level.</p><p>\\\nDon't immediately jump into the nitty-gritty details. Begin with the introductory sections, tutorials, or quick start guides to get a high-level understanding of the system. Your assumptions will often be wrong, and it is good to base your work on a foundation of truth. Think of it like reading the abstract of a research paper before diving into the full text. These introductory materials often provide a roadmap to the rest of the documentation.</p><h4>Use the structure of the docs to your advantage</h4><p>Use the table of contents and search function (these are your best friends) to quickly locate the sections you need. Don't be afraid to experiment with different search terms. Scan through the entire table of contents. Poke around and get a really good feel for how the documentation is structured. Sometimes you will find that your answers are hidden adjacent to where you thought that they would be.</p><p>Real-world examples are invaluable, and the best docs are going to include them. They demonstrate how to use the code in practice and can often clarify confusing concepts. Pay close attention to the context in which the examples are used. A code snippet demonstrating how to use a particular function is much more helpful if it's accompanied by an explanation of what the function does and why it's being used in that specific scenario.</p><h4>Pay attention to the details</h4><p>When looking at function or method definitions, carefully examine the data types of the parameters and return values. This will help you understand how to use them correctly. Sometimes, crucial information is hidden in footnotes, warnings, or less prominent sections. Make sure you scan the entire page, not just the headlines. A seemingly minor note might contain a critical piece of information that can save you a lot of trouble. Documentation often contains links to related topics or other parts of the documentation. Don't hesitate to follow these links to gain a deeper understanding. These links can often lead you to more detailed explanations, examples, or even the source code itself.</p><p>This is one of the biggest reasons why I believe that open-source can be such a boon for companies who want to build an ecosystem of developers around their software. Sometimes, the best way to understand how something works is to look at the source code itself. Don't be afraid to dive in, especially if the documentation is unclear. Reading the source code can give you a much clearer picture of what's happening under the hood. Try out the code examples and modify them to see how they behave. This is a great way to solidify your understanding and discover edge cases. Experimenting with the code is like conducting your own little science experiment. You can change the inputs, observe the outputs, and gain a deeper understanding of how the code works. If you're still stuck, don't hesitate to reach out to the community for help. Forums, mailing lists, and online communities are valuable resources for getting your questions answered. The developer community is generally very helpful, and there are often people who have encountered the same problems you're facing.</p><p>Reading documentation shouldn't be a passive activity. Engage with the material by taking notes, jotting down key points, examples, and any questions you have. Annotating the documentation (if possible), highlighting important sections and adding your own comments can also be helpful. Creating your own examples, writing small programs that use the features you're learning about, is a great way to reinforce your understanding. It's like practicing a musical instrument – the more you do it, the better you get.</p><p>Reading documentation is a skill that improves with practice. By adopting these strategies and actively engaging with the material, you can transform documentation from a source of frustration into a powerful tool for learning and development. So, embrace the documentation, and unlock the full potential of the software you're working with!</p>","contentLength":12550,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"How to Expose (And Fix) Hidden Bottlenecks in Adobe Experience Manager","url":"https://hackernoon.com/how-to-expose-and-fix-hidden-bottlenecks-in-adobe-experience-manager?source=rss","date":1739601941,"author":"Giuseppe Baglio","guid":240,"unread":true,"content":"<h2><em>Learn how to read thread dumps and take control of your application’s runtime behaviour.</em></h2><p>\\\nWhen your Adobe Experience Manager (or in general any JAVA application) instance shows signs of sluggishness, it’s time to roll up your sleeves and dive into the world of thread dumps. IBM Thread Analyzer (TDA) is here to help you untangle the web of threads and pinpoint performance bottlenecks. In this guide, we’ll walk you through how to use IBM TDA to diagnose performance issues in AEM like a pro.</p><p>Before you can start analyzing thread dumps, you’ll need to download and install <a href=\"https://www.ibm.com/support/pages/ibm-thread-and-monitor-dump-analyzer-java-tmda\">IBM Thread Analyzer</a>. Head over to the official IBM website or your organization’s repository to grab the latest version. Once downloaded, follow the installation instructions for your operating system. It’s quick, easy, and sets the stage for some serious troubleshooting.</p><p>Thread dumps are snapshots of all the threads running in your AEM instance at a specific moment. To capture them:</p><ol><li>Use tools like , , or AEM’s built-in functionality to generate thread dumps. There is a well-documented page on <a href=\"http://erience-cloud-kcs/kbarticles/ka-17452\">Adobe Docs</a>.</li><li>Save the thread dump files to your local machine.</li></ol><p>\\\nPro Tip: Capture multiple thread dumps at intervals (e.g., every 10 seconds) to get a clearer picture of long-running issues.</p><p>Launch IBM TDA and open the thread dump files you’ve captured. Simply drag and drop the files into the application or use the “Open” option to load them. Once loaded, you’ll see a list of thread dumps on the left-hand panel.</p><p>To analyze a specific thread dump:</p><ol><li><p>Select the file from the listing.</p></li><li><p>Click the Thread Detail button at the top</p></li></ol><p>\\\nThis will display a detailed view of all the threads in that dump. Now, let’s sort the threads by Stack Depth, ensuring the longest stacks appear at the top. Why? Threads with deeper stacks often indicate more complex operations, which are usually where performance issues hide.</p><p>Focus on threads with a stack depth of 10 lines or longer. These threads are typically the ones consuming the most resources. Take notes on any threads that stand out — whether due to their names, states, or stack traces.</p><p>Next, sort the threads by their State. Scroll down to the Runnable threads. These are the threads that were actively using CPU time when the dump was taken. Keep an eye out for application-specific threads, such as:</p><ul><li><p>Background job threads: Handling tasks like indexing or replication.</p></li><li><p>Request threads: Named like <code>127.0.0.1 [timestamp] GET /path HTTP/1.1</code>.</p></li></ul><p>For each request thread, extract the timestamp from its name (e.g., ). This Unix epoch timestamp tells you when the user’s browser made the request. Convert it to a human-readable date/time using a tool like <a href=\"https://www.epochconverter.com/\">https://www.epochconverter.com/</a>. Compare this with the thread dump’s timestamp to calculate how long the request has been active.</p><p>If the difference is unusually large (e.g., several seconds or minutes), it could indicate a bottleneck in your application.</p><p>\\\nPro Tip: Keep an eye out for patterns. Are certain types of requests consistently taking longer? For example, requests involving complex queries or resource-heavy operations might be worth optimizing. Additionally, if you notice that specific URLs or endpoints are frequently associated with long-running threads, consider profiling those areas of your codebase.</p><p>Thread analysis requires a nuanced approach that goes beyond simple waiting states. While the IBM Thread Analyzer (TDA) interface provides valuable insights into thread relationships, understanding the full context of thread behavior helps create a more complete picture of your application’s performance characteristics.</p><h2>Understanding Thread States</h2><p>When examining threads in TDA, you’ll encounter several important states:</p><p>: These threads are either currently executing or ready to execute when CPU time becomes available. A Runnable state doesn’t necessarily indicate a problem — it’s the natural state for actively working threads.</p><p>: These threads have temporarily paused execution while waiting for a condition to be met. The waiting state can occur for many legitimate reasons, including:</p><ul><li>Resource availability (database connections, file handles)</li><li>Task completion in other threads</li></ul><p>\\\n: These threads are specifically waiting to acquire a monitor or lock. While similar to waiting, blocked states specifically indicate synchronization-related pauses.</p><h2>Analyzing Thread Relationships</h2><p>When you identify a thread of interest, examine its relationships with other threads using this systematic approach:</p><ol><li>Direct Lock Relationships:</li></ol><ul><li>Examine the Waiting Threads panel for immediate dependencies</li><li>Review the stack traces of waiting threads to understand why they’re blocked</li><li>Note the duration of the wait states if available</li></ul><p>\\\n2. Resource Usage Patterns:</p><ul><li>Look for patterns in resource acquisition and release</li><li>Identify potential resource bottlenecks</li><li>Consider alternative resource management strategies</li></ul><p>\\\n3. Architectural Implications:</p><ul><li>Evaluate if the observed behaviour aligns with the system’s design</li><li>Consider if the current threading model is appropriate</li><li>Assess the impact on scalability</li></ul><h2>Understanding Lock Types and Visibility</h2><p>Thread dumps may not show all types of contention. Modern Java applications use various synchronization mechanisms:</p><ol><li>Intrinsic Locks (synchronized keyword):</li></ol><ul><li>Show clear owner-waiter relationships</li><li>Stack traces indicate synchronization points</li></ul><p>\\\n2. Explicit Locks (java.util.concurrent):</p><ul><li>May require additional tooling to visualize</li></ul><p>\\\n3. Non-blocking Mechanisms (Don’t appear as traditional locks but can impact performance):</p><ul></ul><p>When you identify genuine contention issues, consider these approaches:</p><ul><li>Implement finer-grained locking</li><li>Consider non-blocking alternatives</li></ul><ul><li>Implement backoff strategies</li><li>Consider caching solutions</li></ul><p>\\\n3. Architectural Changes</p><ul><li>Evaluate asynchronous processing</li><li>Consider parallel execution paths</li><li>Implement queue-based approaches</li></ul><p>\\\nRemember that thread analysis is an iterative process. Patterns that emerge in one thread dump might not represent consistent behaviour. Always validate your findings across multiple dumps and different time periods before making significant changes to your application.</p><p>Comparing thread dumps across time reveals important performance patterns in your AEM instance. Start by establishing a baseline during normal operation, including peak usage periods and maintenance windows. This baseline provides context for identifying abnormal thread behaviour.</p><p>To determine if a thread is persistent across time:</p><ol><li>Select multiple thread dumps from different points in time.</li><li>Click the Compare Threads button in IBM TDA.</li><li>Look for threads that remain in the Runnable state across all dumps, especially those with consistently long stack traces.</li></ol><p>\\\nUse IBM TDA’s Compare Threads feature to analyze dumps from different time points. Focus on threads that persist across multiple dumps, examining their states, stack depths, and resource usage. Remember that thread persistence alone doesn’t automatically indicate a problem — background services naturally run continuously, while request threads should complete within expected timeframes.</p><p>\\\nWhen analyzing persistent Runnable threads, correlate their behaviour with system metrics like CPU usage, memory consumption, and response times. Consider the thread’s purpose: background services, request processing, or maintenance tasks each have different expected patterns. For request threads, compare their duration against defined service level agreements and business requirements.</p><p>\\\nGot a suspicious thread pattern? Don’t jump to conclusions just yet! Try to recreate the issue in your test environment first — it’s like having a dress rehearsal before the main show. Take a good look at your code, double-check those config settings, and consider what else might be stirring up trouble in your environment. Keep track of what you find with real performance numbers and test results — you’ll thank yourself later.</p><p>\\\nOnce you’re sure you’ve caught a real performance culprit (backed by solid evidence, of course), it’s time to fix it.</p><p>If analyzing threads doesn’t yield actionable insights, switch to the Monitor Detail view:</p><ol><li><p>Go back to the thread listing.</p></li><li><p>Select a thread dump and click the Monitor Detail button.</p></li><li><p>IBM TDA will display a tree view of monitor-owning threads and their waiting threads.</p></li></ol><p>\\\nThis view helps you identify threads that are holding monitors and causing contention. Understanding thread monitors is like viewing the nervous system of your application. These synchronization mechanisms control how threads access shared resources, preventing potential conflicts and ensuring smooth operation.</p><p>\\\nMonitor interactions can reveal critical performance insights. Some threads will be actively processing requests, while others wait for resource acquisition or participate in coordinated activities. Not all waiting or idle threads indicate a problem — they’re often part of the application’s natural resource management strategy.</p><p>\\\nHowever, not all threads are equally important:</p><ul><li>Ignore idle thread pool threads: These threads typically have ≤10 stack lines and are part of thread pools like the servlet engine. They’re usually harmless unless they dominate the thread pool.</li><li>Focus on application-specific monitors: Look for monitors tied to your application’s business logic, such as database connections, caching mechanisms, or custom synchronization blocks.</li></ul><p>\\\nRemember that thread and monitor analysis is both an art and a science. Each application has unique characteristics, so approach performance optimization with curiosity and a holistic perspective. The goal is not to eliminate all waiting threads but to understand and optimize their interactions.</p><p>\\\nAdvanced Tip: If you notice certain monitors are frequently contended, consider refactoring your code to reduce lock granularity. For example:</p><ul><li>Replace coarse-grained locks with fine-grained ones.</li><li>Use non-blocking algorithms or concurrent data structures where possible.</li><li>Optimize database queries to reduce the time threads spend waiting for locks.</li></ul><p>In some thread dumps, you might notice the  appearing frequently. This service handles tasks like Garbage Collection, memory management, and resource cleanup. While the Collector Service might seem like a mysterious background process, understanding its behaviour is key to maintaining optimal system performance — think of it like a diligent janitor in a large office building.</p><p>\\\nWhen you notice frequent Collector Service activity, don’t immediately assume disaster. It’s normal for the Collector Service to show up occasionally, but excessive activity could indicate underlying issues:</p><ul><li>Memory leaks: Objects that are not being garbage collected can cause frequent GC cycles.</li><li>High object churn: Rapid creation and destruction of objects can overwhelm the garbage collector.</li><li>Improper JVM settings: Misconfigured heap sizes or GC algorithms can lead to inefficiencies.</li></ul><p>\\\nHere are some considerations to optimize resource usage:</p><ul><li>Tuning your JVM settings (e.g., increasing heap size, switching to G1GC).</li><li>Reviewing your application’s memory allocation patterns to reduce unnecessary object creation.</li></ul><p>\\\nGarbage Collection is not a problem to be solved, but a dynamic system to be understood and optimized. Each application has unique characteristics, and there’s no universal solution.</p><p>Thread dump analysis is a developer’s superpower — transforming you from a code writer to a performance detective. IBM Thread Analyzer (TDA) is your key to understanding complex system behaviours, revealing hidden bottlenecks that impact your Java/AEM instance’s performance.</p><p>\\\nLike learning an instrument, your skill improves with practice. Each thread dump becomes clearer, revealing intricate patterns of system interactions. The more you analyze, the more intuitive performance optimization becomes.</p><p>\\\nRemember, practice makes perfect — the more you analyze thread dumps, the sharper your diagnostic skills will become. 📊💪</p><p>\\\n🛠 ️Happy troubleshooting!

A staggering number and a logical reason behind it – and it’s the main one, according to CB Insights. It’s not about a lack of funding, bad hires, or tough competition. The real question is whether people actually need what you’re about to offer them.</p><p>\\\nPlus, having a great product isn’t enough. To win, you need to understand the competitive landscape, your audience, and how to get your brand in front of the right people. Drawing from my experience launching Yango Play in MENA — where we developed an AI-powered Entertainment SuperApp that quickly became one of the region’s leading streaming platforms — I want to share the key steps we took to make it the success it is now.</p><p><strong>Selecting the right market</strong> is a balance between <strong>competition and profitability.</strong> Some regions offer low competition but limited revenue potential, while others may be more lucrative but very, very saturated. Sub-Saharan Africa, for example, has a large population and low competition, making it an appealing early-stage entry option. But, lower consumer spending restricts growth. MENA, on the other hand, has a smaller population but significantly higher consumer purchasing power, making it an attractive place for expansion.</p><p>\\\n is just as critical as market selection. Entering too early may mean slow adoption while entering too late risks facing intense competition.</p><blockquote><p>If competition is low, it provides an advantage and accelerates market growth. The key is to enter before the market experiences a surge in adoption.</p></blockquote><p>\\\nIn the CIS region, the subscription economy remained relatively flat at 1–2 million subscribers for several years before suddenly accelerating to 100% annual growth. The same pattern emerged in MENA, indicating that the region was nearing a similar tipping point, making it the optimal time to enter.</p><p>\\\nMarket data is here to reinforce this statement. MENA’s total population is around 500 million, with 13.5 million already subscribed to video streaming services. Just for reference, penetration of subscription services in CIS region stands at 15-20%, with slight differences between countries. Even without complex economic modeling, these figures indicated a major opportunity for subscription-based services in MENA. So, an ideal market for expansion. In this case, the potential formed the perfect ground for selecting the market and strategy – the choice was easy.</p><p>\\\nStill, the region was already highly competitive, with more than 50 video streaming platforms and many global and local music services. We had strong competitors in each category, so for us entering the market required more than just identifying demand.</p><h3><strong>Product and Content Differentiation</strong></h3><p>Creating a strong differentiator was key, and competing head-on with zero brand awareness would have been very much an uphill battle.</p><p>\\\nTake YANGO’s case study on product differentiation. We simultaneously implemented two strategies — with **differentiation through the product and content. \\n </p><ol><li><p>An Entertainment SuperApp — <strong>a single subscription combining music, movies, and games.</strong> At the time, there wasn’t anything similar, so we gladly took the opportunity for this strategic entry point. Users typically juggle multiple subscriptions: one for music, another for video, and yet another for gaming. We built everything into one app under a single subscription. This way, we got on the growing global trend toward bundled entertainment services and also filled a gap in our target market. Win-win.</p></li><li><p>Netflix has long become the go-to platform for global content. We took a different route and built an ecosystem tailored to local tastes. Our SuperApp has regional music, Arabic-language films, and localized gaming options, making it much more relevant to MENA audiences. This became a critical differentiator, making our product not just another streaming service but a culturally attuned entertainment hub.</p></li></ol><p>\\\nConclusion: <em>To successfully differentiate a product, the best strategy is to identify weaknesses or unmet needs in competing products — and fill those gaps.</em></p><p>\\\nIn crowded markets, pricing is as crucial as the product. It’s not the features that make or break the product – it’s about making your product the most logical choice.</p><p>\\\nSo, we introduced a long trial period and a bundled pricing model, allowing users to get music and movies for the price of one. Instead of discounting, we maximized perceived value, making the subscription an easy, rational decision.</p><p>\\\nExpanding into a new market meant building a local team and adapting to language and cultural nuances. With deep market research, perfect timing, and a product tailored to real consumer needs, the SuperApp secured a strong foothold in a high-growth market. How did we tackle these challenges? That’s a story for another article.</p><h3><strong>Audience Differentiation: Defining the Target User</strong></h3><blockquote><p><em>Users have mental “boxes” where they sort every new product they see. Food delivery? That goes into one box. A streaming service? Another box. But if your product doesn’t fit neatly into a box, it triggers confusion — people don’t know what to do with it. And when something feels unfamiliar, the default reaction is to ignore it.</em></p></blockquote><p>\\\nThat’s why crystal-clear positioning isn’t optional — it’s survival. If users can’t instantly grasp who your product is for and why they need it, you’re fighting an uphill battle. But just fitting into a category isn’t enough. You have to own it. When people think about entertainment subscriptions, they should immediately think of your brand.</p><p>\\\nHow do you make that happen? Precision. <strong>Messaging needs to be sharp, clear, and unmistakable.</strong> Instead of vague positioning, spell it out: “This is a service for modern Arabic-speaking users.” That clarity eliminates confusion and makes it easier for potential subscribers to see how the product fits into their everyday world.</p><p>\\\nBrand anchoring is everything— <strong>the simpler and more memorable the positioning, the stronger the audience connection.</strong> If users struggle to define what the product is or who it’s for, they’ll tune it out. That’s a death sentence for any brand. The fix? Build an instant mental link. The moment someone thinks “entertainment subscription,” your SuperApp should be the first thing they recall.</p><p>For startups that can’t outspend competitors, traditional marketing funnels — awareness → consideration → purchase — might not be the best play. Instead, skip the awareness stage and go straight for user acquisition.</p><p>\\\nHere’s the logic: if someone downloads your app, they already know it exists. There’s no need to waste resources on brand awareness before conversion. Yes, this approach raises the cost per acquisition (CPA) since users are coming in cold, but the trade-off is greater control over spending and a more direct path to growth.</p><p>\\\n<strong>The real power lies in performance-driven marketing, which focuses on conversions rather than broad exposure.</strong> Even brands with large media budgets rely on performance marketing as the most efficient way to drive actual user engagement. For lean startups, this strategy isn’t just viable — it’s essential.</p><p><strong>A product launch is a one-time shot</strong> at grabbing audience attention —  over a long, drawn-out campaign. The smartest play? Go loud.</p><p>\\\n<em>The launch moment is your biggest marketing asset — a rare window where PR and buzz can be built just around your existence. Instead of slow, passive brand-building, focus on making a splash that gets people talking.</em></p><p>\\\nOnce the initial hype kicks in, then comes the next phase — brick by brick, reinforcing brand awareness and earning user trust. We also saw this proven in the case of Kinopoisk (video streaming platform). We focused our marketing around major premieres such as <em>Zack Snyder's Justice League</em>, , and big exclusive original premieres.</p><h3><strong>Shifting from Traditional Advertising to Alternative Channels</strong></h3><p>From experience, <em>buying direct media ads is often far less effective than leveraging influencers, word of mouth, and strong PR.</em></p><p>\\\nSpending time on finding the right influencer, crafting a viral PR angle, or developing creative content that resonates delivers higher ROI than just pouring money into paid ads. <strong>In a budget-constrained environment, the smarter play is a two-step approach:</strong></p><ul><li><p>Performance marketing first — drive installs and conversions while simultaneously learning how users interact with the product.</p></li><li><p>Organic &amp; influencer-driven marketing second — building credibility and momentum through earned media, viral content, and strategic partnerships.</p></li></ul><p>With influencers, you’re hitting two targets at once. First, their audience gets exposed to your service, boosting brand awareness. But the real power of influencer marketing is in its high conversion rates — it doesn’t just build visibility; it drives action. It works like performance marketing in many ways. Even better? The creative content influencers produce often performs exceptionally well in paid performance campaigns, making it a valuable asset beyond the initial collaboration. So, really, you’re getting even more value out of every campaign.</p><p>\\\nThis keeps acquisition costs under control and ensures real engagement and long-term user retention.</p><p>\\\nOne of the most successful cases of leveraging PR instead of direct advertising is Netflix. When expanding into new regions, the company rarely invests in traditional media ads. Instead, it focuses on localized content, influencer collaborations, and large-scale PR campaigns. This approach has allowed Netflix to dominate new markets without massive ad spending, making the brand recognizable through organic user discussions and viral interest.</p><p>\\\nThere are plenty of examples of viral brands and services — take Dubai Chocolate or Clubhouse, for instance.

They could make medical services easier to provide while giving people better results, but only if everyone understands the bigger picture. Artificial intelligence (AI) is a critical tool that may become part of your health care services in the near future. Check out how physicians are using AI in medical imaging and diagnostics to learn why it could revolutionize the industry.</p><h2><strong>What Is Medical Imaging Technology?</strong></h2><p>Medical imaging technology is any tool that  to monitor normal and abnormal cases. The term includes various services that assist health care providers in making diagnoses. While they’ve existed long before automation, artificial intelligence in medical imaging is becoming more widespread through software updates.</p><h2><strong>Different Types of Imaging Techniques</strong></h2><p>You’ll better understand why AI could be an essential scientific tool if you know which imaging techniques people undergo. Learn more about each form of technology to understand AI’s advantages and challenges more easily.</p><p>X-ray machines are penetrative imaging tools that look at targeted areas inside the body before sending the results to imaging technology. The machine sends ionizing radiation into a patient to gather pictures for diagnosis. X-rays are especially useful for bone inquiries because the radiation passes through them and makes them bright white.</p><h3><strong>Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)</strong></h3><p>If you need an MRI, a doctor might inject a contrast agent into your bloodstream  before you sit in the machine. Radiowaves, a magnet and a computer processor look inside the selected part of your body to reveal everything from tissues to joints.</p><p>Ultrasound imaging  to see what’s in your body. The machinery bounces soundwaves off of your organs and tissues instead. This isn’t a penetrative imaging technique, even though tools like transvaginal wands do work inside the vaginal canal.</p><p>Doctors needing more complex imaging may order CT scans. They combine an X-ray with a computer to  before it bounces back on a plate behind the patient. The machinery scans in a circle, making it more useful for 3D images of internal damage or tumors.</p><h2><strong>How Each Technique Benefits From AI</strong></h2><p>If health care experts have used imaging techniques since before AI existed, why would they benefit from it? There are a few key ways AI in medical imaging and diagnostics could improve each technique for providers and patients.</p><h3><strong>Algorithms Can Process Images Faster</strong></h3><p>When doctors order penetrative imaging, they wait for specialized hospital staff to conduct the process and return the pictures. The physician needs time to sit and analyze the image, which may not happen immediately if they have a busy schedule. Given that the U.S. will have a health care worker shortage , the high work demand on doctors is a long-term challenge.</p><p>\\\nYou don’t need to worry about not getting medical imaging results back quickly if your local hospital uses machine-learning algorithms to process patient results. AI can review results , providing recommendations for doctors when they have time to check the scans. A health care provider will still review your results, but they could get back to you faster with computerized assistance.</p><h3>AI May Catch Small Details Better</h3><p>Artificial intelligence in medical imaging can do much more than summarize scans. The algorithms can also delineate structures in the human body. Advanced programs , tumors, and blood vessels and catch abnormalities in imaging results.</p><p>\\\nDoctors might accidentally overlook similar developments if they’re too small to see with the human eye. Instead of going back for additional imaging in a few weeks or months, you could get earlier and more precise results with AI-supported medical imaging techniques.</p><p>\\\nRemember — your doctor will still have the final say over your diagnosis. AI provides additional insights, but you’ll always need to talk with your health care provider before moving forward with treatments.</p><h3>Predictive Analytics May Provide Personalized Treatment Suggestions</h3><p>Personalized treatment plans start with diagnostic tools like medical imaging before combining your results with your health history. AI may assist with that process in more hospitals over time. Advanced algorithms can  while checking your scan results. Afterward, your doctor will review its recommended treatment options and use that data to start conversations with you.</p><p>\\\nTogether, you’ll decide the next best steps. AI won’t determine how you get medical care. Machine learning programs are an evergrowing tool that could make those conversations more straightforward by supplying potentially more accurate data.</p><p>Some surgeries require medical imagery techniques for real-time data. Machine learning  in specialties like cardiothoracic, ophthalmology and general surgery. When health care professionals use it in real time, the algorithms can review images guiding surgeons through a procedure and assist in augmented visualization. Decision support may also be helpful for instant recommendations based on the patient’s collective medical history, like the likelihood of complications.</p><h2>Does AI Medical Imaging Guarantee Increased Efficiency?</h2><p>There’s no guarantee that AI medical imaging will increase the efficiency of real-time surgical decisions, diagnoses or treatment plans. Algorithms are only as good as their programming. Your doctor will always need to consider the data provided by any machine learning program before using their comprehensive medical knowledge and understanding of your needs to give an informed opinion.</p><h2>Potential Challenges Hospitals May Face</h2><p>As more hospitals start using AI programs to read results like medical scans, it’s important to understand the barriers that may prevent implementation. Keep those factors in mind if you’re hoping to see AI-assisted medical services where you live.</p><h3>Data Storage and Protection</h3><p>Everything processed and produced by artificial intelligence in medical imaging consists of sensitive data. Hospitals need robust storage capabilities to utilize AI-assisted medical imaging and keep patient information safe. Experts estimate data breaches  in 2024 and may get worse in years to come.</p><p>\\\nHospital administrative teams may need to partner with information technology experts internally or externally to set up data storage methods with extra protection. The process may delay AI implementation, depending on where each facility’s current cybersecurity measures stand.</p><h3>Accurate Interpretability</h3><p>Medical imaging technology with AI programs is relatively new. Hospital staff will likely need some form of training before they can use it with patients. Human error could cause less accurate interpretability as medical providers get used to reading and considering AI results while making recommendations.</p><h3>Integrating AI With Current Workflow Systems</h3><p>Adding a software system to a new service is much less complicated than integrating it into something people are already doing. Hospitals are serving patients around the clock, so adding AI to their medical imaging processes without compromising patient care or service speed is challenging.</p><p>\\\nResearchers also point out that health care systems  due to things like mismatching software programs or outdated technology. Analyzing, collecting and storing imaging data may require other updates before it can happen smoothly. Communicating AI information across departments or between hospitals may create additional struggles for health care providers.</p><h2>Anticipate More AI in Medical Imaging and Diagnostics</h2><p>Health care professionals are interested in artificial intelligence in medical imaging because it could help them work faster, provide personalized results and give more accurate treatment plans. It can also require complex integration planning before patients benefit from it. Staying up to date on those factors will keep you in the know with the ever-changing health care industry.</p>","contentLength":7965,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Ikey Doherty's Serpent OS Rebranding As AerynOS","url":"https://www.phoronix.com/news/Serpent-OS-To-AerynOS","date":1739595600,"author":"Michael Larabel","guid":709,"unread":true,"content":"<article>The nearly three year old Serpent OS Linux distribution started by Ikey Doherty of Solus fame is going to re-brand as AerynOS...</article>","contentLength":128,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"The Phenomenology of Dark Matter Explained","url":"https://hackernoon.com/the-phenomenology-of-dark-matter-explained?source=rss","date":1739591096,"author":"Phenomenology Technology","guid":236,"unread":true,"content":"<h2>3.4 Phenomenology of dark matter</h2><p>\\\n• The relic density coming from Planck satellite data [49]</p><p>\\\nThe total relic abundance of DM in our model is given by the sum of the scalar (𝜒) and fermion (𝑁3) relic abundances:</p><p>\\\nOnly for solutions falling exactly within the band given in Eq.

So far it doesn’t seem like anyone has tried to personally sue them for damages, but several lawsuits are taking what might be a predicate step to establish the lawlessness of their claimed power, upon which liability claims would later be based. In addition to the AFGE litigation against OPM we already <a href=\"https://www.techdirt.com/2025/02/13/at-last-doge-and-musk-are-finally-named-in-a-lawsuit-albeit-officially/\">wrote about</a>, which also names OPM itself for it wrongfully giving DOGE access to its systems, and the <a href=\"https://www.techdirt.com/2025/02/10/court-blocks-doges-treasury-access-adding-credence-to-cfaa-questions/\">states’ lawsuit against the Treasury department</a> for giving DOGE access to theirs, now we have (at this writing at least) two more lawsuits. But while those lawsuits were directed at specific agencies and the wrongfulness of Musk and DOGE’s misuse of power at these agencies, these new lawsuits come gunning for Musk and DOGE and their illegal seizure of power generally.</p><p>They both base this argument on the Appointments Clause of the Constitution, but we’ll use the states’ <a href=\"https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/69638651/2/state-of-new-mexico-v-musk/\">complaint</a> to illustrate how. As it sets forth:</p><blockquote><p><em>The Founders of this country fought for independence from the British monarchy due in no small part to the King’s despotic power to create an unlimited number of governmental offices and to fill those offices with the King’s supporters. In fact, this practice so severely undermined the Founders’ freedoms that it is a listed grievance in the Declaration of Independence. Informed by that history, the Framers of the Constitution crafted the Appointments Clause to protect against such tyranny in our system of government. The Appointments Clause was designed to buttress the separation of powers in two ways: first by requiring that Congress create an office before the President can fill it, and second by requiring that the Senate confirm a nominee to an office created by law. These limitations on the President’s power make executive appointments accountable to Congress and make the Senate’s confirmation decisions accountable to the people. See United States v. Arthrex, 594 U.S. 1, 12 (2021). In this way, the Appointments Clause serves a vital role in curbing Executive abuses of power.</em></p></blockquote><p>Yet here we have Musk wielding a shocking amount of power, the complaint continues:</p><blockquote><p><em>Mr. Musk’s seemingly limitless and unchecked power to strip the government of its workforce and eliminate entire departments with the stroke of a pen or click of a mouse would have been shocking to those who won this country’s independence. There is no office of the United States, other than the President, with the full power of the Executive Branch, and the sweeping authority now vested in a single unelected and unconfirmed individual is antithetical to the nation’s entire constitutional structure.</em></p></blockquote><p>We have an Appointments Clause for this very reason, the complaint reminds, “because it prevents one branch from “aggrandizing its power” or “dispensing it too freely . . . to inappropriate members of the Executive Branch.” It explains that there are three types of personnel that can work for the Executive Branch, “Principle Officers,” “Inferior Officers,” and employees. The last category doesn’t require Senate confirmation, but it also isn’t endowed with the sort of executive power that Musk has been claiming. The other categories are, which is why they require nominations by the President and Senate approval, unless Congress has already passed a law foregoing that process. But Congress can only do that for inferior officers, it has not done so here, and in any case Musk is acting more like a Principle Officer anyway.</p><p>Furthermore, even for Principle Officers the President simply can’t make up a job with such power and appoint someone to it. And <em>even Justice Thomas agrees</em>! The complaint cites what he wrote less than a year ago in :</p><blockquote><p><em>Importantly, the Appointments Clause only grants the President the power to nominate officers to offices that Congress has already “established by Law.” U.S. Const. art. II, § 2, cl. 2. “If Congress has not reached a consensus that a particular office should exist, the Executive lacks the power to unilaterally create and then fill that office.” Trump v. United States, 603 U.S. 593, 650 (2024) (Thomas, J., concurring). “By keeping the ability to create offices out of the President’s hands, the Founders ensured that no President could unilaterally create an army of officer positions to then fill with his supporters. Instead, our Constitution leaves it in the hands of the people’s elected representatives to determine whether new executive offices should exist.” Id. at 646 (Thomas, J., concurring).</em></p></blockquote><p>Yet here we are, with Trump having done exactly what Justice Thomas said he could not, for the very reasons Justice Thomas himself said he could not.</p><p>The complaint then takes 30 pages to document Musk and DOGE’s unlawful rampage through executive branch agencies, in what is surely only scratching the surface of the full depth of how he has abused his unlawful power, and still continues to abuse it.</p><p>And so the lawsuit asks for this power to be enjoined so that Musk and DOGE are forced to stop their destruction. In fact, it’s also now asked for a temporary restraining order to get Musk and DOGE to stop what they are doing immediately:</p><blockquote><p><em>[T]he States ask the court to issue a temporary restraining order that immediately and temporarily, until such time as the Court may hear a motion for preliminary injunction, orders Mr. Musk to identify all ways in which any data obtained through unlawful agency access was used, including whether it was used to train any algorithmic models or create or obtain derivative data, orders Mr. Musk to destroy any copies or any derivative data from such unauthorized access in his or DOGE’s possession, custody, or control, and bars Mr. Musk and personnel associated with DOGE from:(a) ordering any change in the disbursement of public funds by agencies;<p>(b) extending offers on behalf of the United States that would bind the government to an</p>appropriation that has not been authorized by law;<p>(c) cancelling government contracts;</p>(d) disposing of government property;<p>(e) ordering the rescission or amendment of regulations;</p>(f) making personnel decisions for agency employees;<p>(g) taking steps to dismantle agencies created by law or otherwise asserting control over</p>such agencies, including, e.g., placing employees on administrative leave;<p>(h) accessing sensitive and confidential agency data, using agency data for other than its</p>authorized purpose;<p>(i) altering agency data systems without authorization by law and without taking all</p>appropriate protections against cybersecurity risks;<p>(j) engaging in any other conduct that violates the Appointments Clause or exceeds</p>statutory authority.</em></p></blockquote><p>But beyond that the complaint also asks for declaratory relief such that a court finally speaks to the unlawful nature of Musk’s power (as well as that of its DOGE agency, which, as the complaint explains, is also malformed if it is to claim the sort of supervisory power that it has, which is a power that can only be endowed by Congress):</p><blockquote><p><em>DOGE has purported to exercise authority of its own, and not merely to have acted as an adviser to the President. “Administrative agencies are creatures of statute. They accordingly possess only the authority that Congress has provided.” Nat’l Fed’n of Indep. Bus. v. Dep’t of Lab., Occupational Safety &amp; Health Admin., 595 U.S. 109, 117 (2022) (per curiam). Congress has not provided any authority to DOGE. The Constitution does not provide any authority to DOGE. The temporary organization statute, 5 U.S.C. § 3161, [that Trump claimed in his Executive Order was empowering DOGE] does not provide DOGE with the authority it has purported to exercise. That statute provides that a “temporary organization” is defined as an organization “established by law or Executive order for a specific period not in excess of three years for the purpose of performing a specific study or other project.” 5 U.S.C. § 3161(a)(1) (emphasis added). There is no plausible definition of “project” that would include DOGE’s attempt to remake the entire Executive Branch, as described above, or to destroy agencies, fire personnel, halt funding, or dispose of government property.</em></p></blockquote><p>In asking for declaratory relief a few things are accomplished. For one thing, it gives those whom Musk and DOGE are bossing around the ability to say no. In fact, if gives them the obligation to say no, because what they are being asked to do would be an unlawful order and thus unlawful for them to do. (Of course, the injunction/TRO would also restrict Musk and DOGE from even making such demands.)</p><p>But it also inches us forward to the real prize here: holding everyone involved with DOGE personally liable for the harm they have caused. By establishing that what they have done has been unlawful it provides the predicate basis for potentially all sorts of forms of liability, including the <a href=\"https://www.techdirt.com/2025/02/04/when-its-not-just-a-coup-but-a-cfaa-violation-too/\">CFAA</a>, which the USAID workers suit also provides more evidence of liability for, including in its allegations that . See page 6-7 of the <a href=\"https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/69636722/4/does-1-26-v-musk/\">complaint</a>:*</p><blockquote><p><em>J. Doe 2 understands that the DOGE personnel had administrative privileges into all the USAID systems and tools and that DOGE personnel took information out of the agency and sent it elsewhere. DOGE’s actions have caused J. Doe 2 emotional injury, as J. Doe 2 is aware of the extent of confidential information that has been breached and the privacy laws broken.</em></p></blockquote><p>And the declaratory judgment would help overcome another legal issue: whether anyone associated with DOGE would be entitled to any sort of governmental immunity for the harm they’ve caused. This will be an issue to analyze further, because we have, and would normally want to have, some immunity shielding government officials from liability for doing their jobs, if we are going to leave them sufficiently free to do their jobs. But here no one in DOGE actually had a job that would have entitled them to do what they have done. Which is what these 14 states are asking a court to finally and declaratively say.</p>","contentLength":10237,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Brake Pad Dust Can Be More Toxic Than Exhaust Emissions, Study Says","url":"https://tech.slashdot.org/story/25/02/15/0016236/brake-pad-dust-can-be-more-toxic-than-exhaust-emissions-study-says?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&utm_medium=feed","date":1739590200,"author":"BeauHD","guid":401,"unread":true,"content":"Bruce66423 shares a report from The Guardian: Microscopic particles emitted from brake pads can be more toxic than those emitted in diesel vehicle exhaust, a study has found. This research shows that even with a move to electric vehicles, pollution from cars may not be able to be eradicated. The researchers found that a higher concentration of copper in some commonly used brake pads was associated with increased harmful effects on sensitive cells from people's lungs, as a result of particles being breathed in.\n \nExposure to pollution generated by cars, vans and lorries has been previously been linked to an increased risk of lung and heart disease. While past attention has mainly concentrated on exhaust emissions, particles are also released into the air from tyre, road and brake pad wear. These emissions are largely unregulated by legislation and the study found that these âoenon-exhaustâ pollution sources are now responsible for the majority of vehicle particulate matter emissions in the UK and parts of Europe, with brake dust the main contributor among them.\n \n[...] The scientists examined the effects on lung health of particulate matter from four different types of brake pad with differing chemical compositions; low metallic, semi-metallic, non-asbestos organic and hybrid-ceramic. Results showed that of the four types of brake pads, non-asbestos organic pads were the most potent at inducing inflammation and other markers of toxicity, and were found to be more toxic to human lung cells than diesel exhaust particles. Ceramic pads were the second most toxic. Dr. Ian Mudway, senior lecturer at the school of public health at Imperial College London, cautioned that while the research on brake pad emissions appears sound, it is premature to conclude they are worse than diesel exhaust due to \"uncontrolled variables\" like brake disc types and particle composition.\n \nSlashdot reader Bruce66423 also notes it \"doesn't discuss the significance of regenerative breaking, which is a feature of at least some electric cars [that reduces brake pad wear by using the electric motor to slow down the vehicle and recover energy].\"\n \nThe research has been published in the journal Particle and Fibre Technology.","contentLength":2229,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Theoretical and Experimental Constraints: Discussing Different Constraints on the Model Parameters","url":"https://hackernoon.com/theoretical-and-experimental-constraints-discussing-different-constraints-on-the-model-parameters?source=rss","date":1739588801,"author":"Phenomenology Technology","guid":235,"unread":true,"content":"<h2>3.3 Theoretical and experimental constraints</h2><p>We discuss different constraints on the model parameters such as𝑈(1)𝑋 gauge coupling and scalar mixing angle.

Several simple extensions of the SM that can account for the DM have already been studied [136–143]. In these models, the SM particle content is extended by additional fields, and a discrete symmetry is usually introduced to guarantee the stability of the DM particle in cosmological scale. In recent years, a class of models has been proposed to incorporate the neutrino mass generation and the existence of DM in a unified framework. Motivated by this, people have studied well-motivated BSM framework based on the gauged 𝑈(1)𝑋 model [144–146]. The most intriguing aspect of this model is that including three generations of right-handed neutrinos, as in the type-I seesaw process for creating light neutrino masses, is no longer an option, but emerges as the simplest solution to eliminate the gauge and mixed gauge-gravity anomalies [147]. The scalar DM can be inherently stable in such models due to its 𝑈(1)𝑋 charge, but the fermionic DM cannot be realized in the simplest 𝑈(1)𝑋 model. Additional discrete symmetries can be introduced, which can stabilize one of the right-handed neutrinos to play the role of DM, while the other two neutrinos participate in the type I seesaw process to generate the required light neutrino masses and flavor mixing. Also, there are many models proposed in the literature, where neutrino mass generation is intimately connected with DM [148–153]. In these types of models, DM is a mediator of neutrino mass generation.</p><p>\\\nA single-particle DM model may not be sufficient to account for the relic density of DM observed in the universe. Many such models face strong constraints from direct detection experiments and other observations. Therefore, it is reasonable to consider multi-particle DM scenarios, where two or more particles contribute to the DM abundance. [24,62,126]. Multi-component DM refers to a situation in which two or more particles contribute to the measured DM density. This has been already studied in many BSM scenarios [31, 56, 57, 154–166]. The multi-component DM model has also some benefits over the single dark matter scenario. For instance, it can avoid some stringent constraints arising from various experiments that probe the properties and interactions of dark matter and other particles. A multi-component DM model can also accommodate different observational features of dark matter, such as its distribution and abundance in the universe.</p><p>(1) Shivam Gola, The Institute of Mathematical Sciences, Chennai.</p>","contentLength":2933,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"AI and the Future of Work: Transforming Industries","url":"https://hackernoon.com/ai-and-the-future-of-work-transforming-industries?source=rss","date":1739585602,"author":"Ombir Sharma","guid":232,"unread":true,"content":"<p>AI or artificial intelligence is the capability and ability of a machine to imitate human intelligence.

AI alleviates repetitive tasks and allows employees to focus on creative problem-solving.</p><p>The new approach AI takes centers around<a href=\"https://www.intelligenceinsights.net/artificial-intelligence/autogpt-the-future-of-autonomous-ai-assistants/\"></a>, just like the Industrial Revolution. While focusing on increasing productivity, ChatGPT and AutoGPT have the potential to perform tasks such as data entry, scheduling, and even more complex problem-solving, increasing overall demand for customer service representatives and support agents. In every age, these shifts in productivity have led to increased job opportunities, just like the multiple industries that formed alongside the technology integrations.</p><h3>Facilitation of Employment</h3><p>The introduction of ChatGPT can aid everyday business operations, serving as virtual assistants that communicate primarily with customers. By streamlining business functions for flexible resource allocation, productivity is sure to increase. Efficient use of ChatGPT makes it incredibly simple for businesses to automate their customer inquiries, increasing profit margins.</p><p>ChatGPT encourages an environmentally friendly approach by seamlessly optimizing supply chains with effective waste reduction strategies. AI, without a doubt, would optimize ChatGPT-provided decision-making to improve overall energy consumption and ensure economic goals are catered towards too.</p><p>In the absence of people, ChatGPT opens doors to new interactions that drastically improve service and business operations through automation. Communication via virtual assistants and chatbots allows for effortless collaboration and automated customer interactions on a new level.</p><p>\\\nIn every way possible, AI improves business decision-making by offering adequate utility and data for correct allocation. Business AI helps set prices, predict market movement, and analyze how much risk varies. Keeping track of tools like ChatGPT can aid project-based decisions by providing up-to-date information.</p><h3>Elimination of Junior and Mid-level Staff Positions</h3><p>As a result of automation, junior and mid-level roles, particularly in data entry and administrative duties and tasks, are being skinned out. More companies seem to be using AI, which, in turn, is leading to an increased need for highly specialized and senior positions that require a supervisor to think strategically.</p><p>Across different industries, AI is changing the future of work. From performing simple services to making complex decisions, AI has a broad range of applications, and as time goes by, the list only seems to grow.</p><h2>The Use Of AI In Business</h2><p>Artificial intelligence is being adopted in all sectors to boost productivity, accuracy, and satisfaction of customers. It is used in recruitment HR, in<a href=\"https://www.thenexthint.com/a-new-era-in-customer-service-with-automation/\"></a> through chatbots, and in marketing through brand campaigns. Work processes are now being automated with AI, thereby, minimizing the costs of running the business.</p><h3>Impact Of AI On Business Operations</h3><p>Software developments with regard to Artificial intelligence utilizing machine learning and automation present the future of the workplace, resulting in increased productivity. Businesses will continuously adopt AI to better their decisions, improve work processes, and promote creativity. Because of this, more skills in AI will be needed which will translate to new positions being created.</p><p>In the field of finance, AI handles fraud detection, automates trading, and enhances risk assessments. Robo-advisors make investment suggestions based on a client’s unique profile, and AI chatbots provide further engagement with customers.</p><p>AI assists in diagnosing diseases and personalizes treatments for patients in healthcare. With the help of <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/the-future-of-robotics-development-with-eva-li-of-vincross-dd8d85256d4e\">AI-led robots</a>, humans can make fewer mistakes while performing surgeries, which helps enhance patient care.</p><p>In the automotive sector, AI enables self-driving cars, predictive maintenance, and smart traffic control. AI technologies also help improve vehicle safety and fuel efficiency.</p><p><a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-the-us-government-plans-to-ensure-the-safety-and-security-of-ai-technology\">Cybersecurity</a> is enhanced by AI technologies that assess new threats, detect anomalies, and provide assistance during the occurrence of cyber-attacks. Data security is also improved and business risks are suppressed by AI technologies.</p><p>In the e-commerce sector, AI improves customer experiences, automates supply chains, and increases the level of service. Recommendation systems based on users' behavior increase the total sales and satisfaction level of customers.</p><p>We see the growth of AI in hospitality in chatbots, smart booking systems, and customer experience applications. AI analytics also help with effective guest price settings and greater guest satisfaction.</p><p>AI greatly assists in providing relevant lists of jobs that best suit a candidate's skills. AI technology helps to read a CV, understand the candidate's level of skills, and determine his success.</p><h2>Are My Working Opportunities On The Line Due To AI?</h2><p>Filling positions for repetitive work is indeed scalable with AI which is why it poses a threat for employment. In reality, AI also creates new possibilities by taking up low-productivity tasks. It is expected that new jobs that require creative thinking, emotions, and strategy-based decision-making will still exist. To ensure that they remain employed, workers must learn new skills and adjust to the new reality.</p><p>AI is enabling the future of work by performing tasks that require time and effort, growing productivity, and changing the existing categorization of industries. Some roles may be lost, but there are always new positions that have to be filled. Being able to utilize AI together with other novel technologies is crucial to be successful for business professionals in the new world.</p>","contentLength":7063,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"'Please Stop Inviting AI Notetakers To Meetings'","url":"https://slashdot.org/story/25/02/15/006253/please-stop-inviting-ai-notetakers-to-meetings?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&utm_medium=feed","date":1739584920,"author":"BeauHD","guid":400,"unread":true,"content":"Most virtual meeting platforms these days include AI-powered notetaking tools or bots that join meetings as guests, transcribe discussions, and/or summarize key points. \"The tech companies behind them might frame it as a step forward in efficiency, but the technology raises troubling questions around etiquette and privacy and risks undercutting the very communication it's meant to improve (paywalled; alternative source),\" writes Chris Stokel-Walker in a Weekend Essay for Bloomberg. From the article: [...] The push to document every workplace interaction and utterance is not new. Having a paper trail has long been seen as a useful thing, and a record of decisions and action points is arguably what makes a meeting meaningful. The difference now is the inclusion of new technology that lacks the nuance and depth of understanding inherent to human interaction in a meeting room. In some ways, the prior generation of communication tools, such as instant messaging service Slack, created its own set of problems. Messaging that previously passed in private via email became much more transparent, creating a minefield where one wrong word or badly chosen emoji can explode into a dispute between colleagues. There is a similar risk with notetaking tools. Each utterance documented and analyzed by AI includes the potential for missteps and misunderstandings.\n \nAnyone thinking of bringing an AI notetaker to a meeting must consider how other attendees will respond, says Andrew Brodsky, assistant professor of management at the McCombs School of Business, part of the University of Texas at Austin. Colleagues might think you want to better focus on what is said without missing out on a definitive record of the discussion. Or they might think, \"You can't be bothered to take notes yourself or remember what was being talked about,\" he says. For the companies that sell these AI interlopers, the upside is clear. They recognize we're easily nudged into different behaviors and can quickly become reliant on tools that we survived without for years. [...] There's another benefit for tech companies getting us hooked on AI notetakers: Training data for AI systems is increasingly hard to come by. Research group Epoch AI forecasts there will be a drought of usable text possibly by next year. And with publishers unleashing lawsuits against AI companies for hoovering up their content, the tech firms are on the hunt for other sources of data. Notes from millions of meetings around the world could be an ideal option.\n \nFor those of us who are the source of such data, however, the situation is more nuanced. The key question is whether AI notetakers make office meetings more useless than so many already are. There's an argument that meetings are an important excuse for workers to come together and talk as human beings. All that small talk is where good ideas often germinate -- that's ostensibly why so many companies are demanding staff return to the office. But if workers trade in-person engagement for AI readbacks, and colleagues curb their words and ideas for fear of being exposed by bots, what's left? If the humans step back, all that remains is a series of data points and more AI slop polluting our lives.","contentLength":3228,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Uber sues DoorDash, alleging anti-competitive tactics","url":"https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/14/uber-sues-doordash-alleging-anti-competitive-tactics/","date":1739583337,"author":"Kirsten Korosec, Maxwell Zeff","guid":85,"unread":true,"content":"<p>Ride-share giant Uber filed a lawsuit Friday against DoorDash, accusing the delivery outfit of stifling competition by intimidating restaurant owners into exclusive deals.

Gizmodo reports: The researchers tapped 319 knowledge workers -- a person whose job involves handling data or information -- and asked them to self-report details of how they use generative AI tools in the workplace. The participants were asked to report tasks that they were asked to do, how they used AI tools to complete them, how confident they were in the AI's ability to do the task, their ability to evaluate that output, and how confident they were in their own ability to complete the same task without any AI assistance.\n \nOver the course of the study, a pattern revealed itself: the more confident the worker was in the AI's capability to complete the task, the more often they could feel themselves letting their hands off the wheel. The participants reported a \"perceived enaction of critical thinking\" when they felt like they could rely on the AI tool, presenting the potential for over-reliance on the technology without examination. This was especially true for lower-stakes tasks, the study found, as people tended to be less critical. While it's very human to have your eyes glaze over for a simple task, the researchers warned that this could portend to concerns about \"long-term reliance and diminished independent problem-solving.\"\n \nBy contrast, when the workers had less confidence in the ability of AI to complete the assigned task, the more they found themselves engaging in their critical thinking skills. In turn, they typically reported more confidence in their ability to evaluate what the AI produced and improve upon it on their own. Another noteworthy finding of the study: users who had access to generative AI tools tended to produce \"a less diverse set of outcomes for the same task\" compared to those without.","contentLength":1915,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"AI’s Hallucinations Are Over","url":"https://hackernoon.com/ais-hallucinations-are-over?source=rss","date":1739579978,"author":"Oleksandr Zabashnyi","guid":231,"unread":true,"content":"<p>First of all, let me describe the problem. I am a software developer, and I don't use AI to write code just because of hallucinations. For creating pictures or writing texts they are not so critical, but for the task of writing code, they are overkill. I have identified two subproblems. Firstly, it is difficult to identify the errors made by AI. It is quite easy for a designer as he counts the fingers in the pictures and that's it; the picture is accepted as the result. </p><p>\\\nHowever, I have to deal with the code and seek the mistakes in it. I hate to do it. Secondly, it is the irreproducibility of the result. For example, I tried to write unit tests: the first generated unit test is successful, but the second one is not, even for the same method. This makes working with it impossible.</p><p>\\\nNow, about the solution. Our hypothesis was as follows: what if we could assign the corresponding result data to a certain set of input information? And do that at least sometimes during the task-solving process. Would that reduce the number of hallucinations? Oh yes! After thorough research, we have come to the conclusion that the presence of a critical mass of such ‘rigidly fixed’ nodes almost completely removed hallucinations from the output. All that remained was to find the criteria for identifying these correspondences between input and output information and to modify the math apparatus to enable the use of this approach. We called this method the \"preset landscape.\"</p><p>\\\nCertainly, our approach has several limitations. First of all, the subject area should imply the existence of only one correct answer for a given set of output data. Fortunately, software development is exactly such an area. The second limitation is that at the stage of landscape formation, the participation of an expert in the subject field is required. In other words, it is impossible to apply the math apparatus to the areas where a human cannot articulate the rules. These limitations greatly narrow the scope of application of our approach. However, its usage in such areas as software development, law, healthcare, and engineering tasks is more than enough.</p><p>\\\nTo demonstrate the capabilities of the math apparatus, we have developed <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1mRhGzEeyhcT4EUZj4a4wAZ8TNYSvByRW/view?usp=sharing\">a plugin</a> for IntelliJ Idea (JetBrains). You can install it and make sure that there are no hallucinations. Here, you can find <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1mRhGzEeyhcT4EUZj4a4wAZ8TNYSvByRW/view?usp=sharing\">the instructions</a>.</p><p>\\\nWhile we were working on the plugin, AI services came into vogue, which provides API and you can use them in your own solutions. Therefore, we are planning to make such a platform for software development tasks. We will most likely start with Java.

Built with a decentralized infrastructure that prioritizes privacy, PIN AI aims to challenge big tech's dominance over user data by ensuring that personal AI serves individuals -- not corporate interests. Founded by AI and blockchain experts from Columbia, MIT and Stanford, PIN AI is led by Davide Crapis, Ben Wu and Bill Sun, who bring deep experience in AI research, large-scale data infrastructure and blockchain security. [...]\n \nPIN AI introduces an alternative to centralized AI models that collect and monetize user data. Unlike cloud-based AI controlled by large tech firms, PIN AI's personal AI runs locally on user devices, allowing for secure, customized AI experiences without third-party surveillance. At the heart of PIN AI is a user-controlled data bank, which enables individuals to store and manage their personal information while allowing developers access to anonymized, multi-category insights -- ranging from shopping habits to investment strategies. This approach ensures that AI-powered services can benefit from high-quality contextual data without compromising user privacy.\n[...]\nThe new mobile app launched in the U.S. and multiple regions also includes key features such as: - The \"God model\" (guardian of data): Helps users track how well their AI understands them, ensuring it aligns with their preferences. - Ask PIN AI: A personalized AI assistant capable of handling tasks like financial planning, travel coordination and product recommendations. - Open-source integrations: Users can connect apps like Gmail, social media platforms and financial services to their personal AI, training it to better serve them without exposing data to third parties. - \"With our app, you have a personal AI that is your model,\" Crapis added. \"You own the weights, and it's completely private, with privacy-preserving fine-tuning.\" Davide Crapis, co-founder of PIN AI, told VentureBeat that the app currently supports several open-source AI models, including small versions of DeepSeek and Meta's Llama. \"With our app, you have a personal AI that is your model,\" Crapis added. \"You own the weights, and it's completely private, with privacy-preserving fine-tuning.\"\n \nYou can sign up for early access to the PIN AI app here.","contentLength":2669,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Ctrl-Alt-Speech: Backdoors And Backsteps","url":"https://www.techdirt.com/2025/02/14/ctrl-alt-speech-backdoors-and-backsteps/","date":1739577663,"author":"Mike Masnick","guid":672,"unread":true,"content":"<p>In this week’s round-up of the latest news in online speech, content moderation and internet regulation, Mike and Ben are joined by a group of students from the Media Law and Policy class at the American University School of Communication.

Single-class testing is akin to testing each nut and bolt separately. Imagine testing of such components brought no issue to light. Still, it would be very risky to mass manufacture the car without having built a prototype and sent it to a test drive.</p></blockquote><p>\\\nHowever, technology has evolved since that time.</p><p>I use the word \"technology\" very generally, but I have <a href=\"https://testcontainers.com/\">Testcontainers</a> in mind:</p><blockquote><p><em>Unit tests with real dependencies</em></p><p>\\\n  Testcontainers is an open source library for providing throwaway, lightweight instances of databases, message brokers, web browsers, or just about anything that can run in a Docker container.</p></blockquote><p>\\\nIn effect, Testcontainers replaces  with \"real\" dependencies-containerized. It's a real game-changer: instead of painfully writing mocking code to stub dependencies just set them up regularly.</p><p>\\\nFor example, without Testcontainers, you'd need to provide mocks for your  in tests; with it, you only need to start a database container, and off you go.</p><p>\\\nAt the time, the cost of having a local Docker daemon in your testing environment offset many benefits. It's not the case anymore, as Docker daemons are available (nearly) everywhere.</p><p>\\\nMy definition of Integration Testing has changed a bit:</p><blockquote><p>Integration Testing is testing that requires significant setup.</p></blockquote><p>\\\nThe definition is vague on purpose, as significance has a different meaning depending on the organization, the team, and the individual. Note that Google defines two categories of tests: fast and slow. Their definition is equally vague, meant to adapt to different contexts.</p><p>In any case, the golden rule still applies: the closer you are to the final environment, the more risks you cover, and the more valuable your tests are. </p><p>\\\nIf our target production environment is Kubernetes, we will reap the most benefits from running the app on Kubernetes and testing it as a black box. It doesn't mean that white box testing in a more distant environment is not beneficial; it means that the more significant the gap between the testing environment and the target environment, the fewer issues we will uncover.</p><p>\\\nFor the purposes of this blog post, we will use GitHub as the base testing environment for unit testing and a full-fledged Kubernetes cluster for integration testing. There is no absolute truth regarding what is the best practice™, as contexts vary widely across organizations and even across teams within the same organization. It's up to every engineer to decide within their specific context the ROI of setting up such an environment because the closer you are to production, the more complex and, thus, expensive it will be.</p><h2>Use-case: Application With Database</h2><p>Let's jump into how to test an app that uses a database to store its data. I don't want anything fancy, just solid, standard engineering practices. I'll be using a CRUD(Create Read Update Delete) JVM-based app, but most of the following can easily apply to other stacks as well. The following blog posts will involve less language-specific content.</p><ul><li>Kotlin, because I love the language</li><li>Spring Boot: it's the most widespread framework for JVM-based applications</li><li>Maven-there's nothing else</li><li>Project Reactor and coroutines, because it makes things more interesting</li><li>PostgreSQL-at the moment, it's a very popular database, and it's well-supported by Spring</li></ul><p>\\\nIf you don't know Flyway, it allows you to track database schemas and data in a code repository and manage changes, known as migrations, between versions. Each migration has a unique version, , v1.0, v1.1, v2.1.2, etc. Flyway tries to apply migration in order. If it has already applied a migration, it skips it. Flyway stores its data in a dedicated table to track the applied migrations.</p><p>\\\nThis approach is a must-have; <a href=\"https://www.liquibase.com/\">Liquibase</a> is an alternative that follows the same principles.</p><p>\\\nSpring Boot fully integrates Flyway and Liquibase. When the app starts, the framework will kickstart them. If a pod is killed and restarted, Flyway will first check the migrations table to apply only the one that didn't run previously.</p><p>\\\nI don't want to bore you with the app details; you can find the code on <a href=\"https://github.com/ajavageek/vcluster-pipeline\">GitHub</a>.</p><p>Per my definition above, unit testing should be easy to set up. With Testcontainers, it is.</p><p>\\\nThe testing code counts the number of items in a table, inserts a new item, and counts the number of items again.

If you aren't, a GitHub workflow is a declarative description of an automated job. A job consists of several steps. GitHub offers several triggers: Manual, scheduled, or depending on an event.</p><p>\\\nWe want the workflow to run on each Pull Request to verify that tests run as expected.</p><pre><code>name: Test on PR                                                               #1\n\non:\n  pull_request:\n    branches: [ \"master\" ]                                                     #2\n</code></pre><ol><li><p>Trigger on a PR to the master branch.</p></li></ol><p>\\\nThe first steps are pretty standard:</p><pre><code>jobs:\n  build:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n      - name: Checkout repository\n        uses: actions/checkout@v4\n      - name: Install JRE\n        uses: actions/setup-java@v4\n        with:\n          distribution: temurin\n          java-version: 21\n          cache: maven                                                         #1\n</code></pre><ol><li>The  action includes a caching option for build tools. Here, it will cache dependencies across runs, speeding up consecutive runs. Unless you have good reasons not to, I recommend using this option.</li></ol><p>\\\nFor the same reason, we should cache our built artifacts. While researching for this post, I learned that GitHub discards them across runs <strong>and steps in the same run</strong>. Hence, we can speed up the runs by caching them explicitly:</p><pre><code>      - name: Cache build artifacts\n        uses: actions/cache@v4                                                 &lt;1&gt;\n        with:\n          path: target\n          key: ${{ runner.os }}-build-${{ github.sha }}                        &lt;2&gt;\n          restore-keys:\n            ${{ runner.os }}-build                                             &lt;3&gt;\n</code></pre><ol><li><p>Use the same action that  uses under the hood.</p></li><li><p>Compute the cache key. In our case, the  should be immutable, but this should be how you run matrices across different operating systems.</p></li><li><p>Reuse the cache if it's the same OS.</p></li></ol><pre><code>      - name: Run \"unit\" tests\n        run: ./mvnw -B test\n        env:\n          SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE: local                                        &lt;1&gt;\n</code></pre><ol><li>Activate the local profile. The workflow's environment provides a Docker daemon. Hence, Testcontainer successfully downloads and runs the database container.</li></ol><p>\\\nAt this point, we should run the integration test. Yet, we need the app deployed to run this test. For this, we need available infrastructure.</p><h2>Alternative \"Unit testing\" on GitHub</h2><p>The above works perfectly on GitHub, but we can move closer to the deployment setup by leveraging GitHub <a href=\"https://docs.github.com/en/actions/use-cases-and-examples/using-containerized-services/about-service-containers\">service containers</a>. Let's migrate PostgreSQL from Testcontainers to a GitHub service container.</p><p>\\\nRemoving Testcontainers is pretty straightforward: we do not activate the  profile.</p><p>\\\nUsing GitHub's service container requires an additional section in our workflow:</p><pre><code>jobs:\n  build:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    env:\n      GH_PG_USER: testuser                                                     #1\n      GH_PG_PASSWORD: testpassword                                             #1\n      GH_PG_DB: testdb                                                         #1\n    services:\n      postgres:\n        image: postgres:15\n        options: &gt;-                                                            #2\n          --health-cmd \"pg_isready -U $POSTGRES_USER\"\n          --health-interval 10s\n          --health-timeout 5s\n          --health-retries 5\n        ports:\n            - 5432/tcp                                                         #3\n        env:\n          POSTGRES_USER: ${{ env.GH_PG_USER }}                                 #4\n          POSTGRES_PASSWORD: ${{ env.GH_PG_PASSWORD }}                         #4\n          POSTGRES_DB: ${{ env.GH_PG_DB }}                                     #4\n</code></pre><ol><li><p>Define environment variables at the job level to use them across steps.

And yet, that appears to be exactly what’s happening with NYC Mayor Eric Adams, who was <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny/pr/new-york-city-mayor-eric-adams-charged-bribery-and-campaign-finance-offenses\">indicted last fall</a> for allegedly trading favors with Turkish officials, and is now watching those charges evaporate in exchange for helping the Trump administration with its immigration agenda.</p><p>The twist — and there’s always a twist — is that the people most effectively pointing out this corruption aren’t the usual suspects. Instead, it’s coming from a bunch of dyed-in-the-wool conservative prosecutors at SDNY who are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/14/justice-department-officials-resign-eric-adams-charges\">resigning en masse</a> rather than participate in what they see as a perversion of justice. When the Federalist Society crowd starts quitting over corruption, you know something interesting is happening.</p><p>The apparent corruption here isn’t just brazen — it’s documented in black and white. The Justice Department’s <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/02/10/nyregion/eric-adams-charges\">order to drop the case</a> doesn’t even pretend to assess the merits of the charges. Instead, Acting Deputy Attorney General Emil Bove explicitly tied the dismissal to Adams’ willingness to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/13/nyc-eric-adams-rikers-ice\">assist with federal deportation efforts</a> — a textbook example of weaponizing prosecutorial discretion for political ends.</p><p>Even more disturbing is the mechanism: the dismissal is “without prejudice,” meaning charges could be refiled at any time. This isn’t just prosecutorial discretion — it’s prosecutorial extortion. The Trump administration has effectively created a sword of Damocles to hang over Adams’ head, ensuring his continued compliance with their immigration agenda. The message is clear: step out of line, and those charges might suddenly become relevant again. It’s the kind of institutional corruption that would make a banana republic blush.</p><p>It means that Adams’ personal freedom now outweighs the best interests of the people of New York City.</p><p>The system’s response to this corruption has been revealing. For several days after the initial order, an unusual silence descended over the Southern District office — a silence that spoke volumes about the internal struggle taking place. Then came something remarkable: a scathing letter from Acting US Attorney Danielle Sassoon to Attorney General Pam Bondi. Sassoon — a Federalist Society stalwart and former Scalia clerk who’s about as far from a “progressive prosecutor” as you can get — laid bare the rot at the core of this decision in a document that reads like a conservative legal scholar’s manifesto against institutional corruption.</p><blockquote><p><em>Because the law does not support a dismissal, and because I am confident that Adams has committed the crimes with which he is charged, I cannot agree to seek a dismissal driven by improper considerations. As Justice Robert Jackson explained, “the prosecutor at his best is one of the most beneficent forces in our society, when he acts from malice or other base motives, he is one of the worst.” The Federal Prosecutor, 24 J. Am. Jud. Soc’y 18 (“This authority has been granted by people who really wanted the right thing done—wanted crime eliminated— but also wanted the best in our American traditions preserved. “). I understand my duty as a prosecutor to mean enforcing the law impartially, and that includes prosecuting a validly returned indictment regardless whether its dismissal would be politically advantageous, to the defendant or to those who appointed me. A federal prosecutor “is the representative not of an ordinary party to a controversy, but of a sovereignty whose obligation to govern impartially is as compelling as its obligation to govern at all.” Berger v. United States, 295 U.S. 78, 88 (1935).</em></p><p><em>For the reasons explained above, I do not believe there are reasonable arguments in support of a Rule 48(a) motion to dismiss a case that is well supported by the evidence and the law. I understand that Mr. Bove disagrees, and I am mindful of your recent order reiterating prosecutors’ duty to make good-faith arguments in support of the Executive Branch’s positions. See Feb. 5, 2025 Mem. “General Policy Regarding Zealous Advocacy on Behalf of the United States.” But because I do not see any good-faith basis for the proposed position, I cannot make such arguments consistent with my duty of candor. N.Y.R.P.C.3.3; id. cmt. 2 (“A lawyer acting as an advocate in an adjudicative proceeding has an obligation to present the client’s case with persuasive force. Performance of that duty while maintaining confidences of the client, however, is qualified by the advocate’s duty of candor to the tribunal. ” ).</em></p><p><em>In particular, the rationale given by Mr. Bove—an exchange between a criminal defendant and the Department of Justice akin to the Bout exchange with Russia— is, as explained above, a bargain that a prosecutor should not make. Moreover, dismissing without prejudice and with the express option of again indicting Adams in the future creates obvious ethical problems, by implicitly threatening future prosecution if Adams’s cooperation with enforcing the immigration laws proves unsatisfactory to the Department. See In re Christoff, 690 N.E.2d 1135 (Ind. 1997) (disciplining prosecutor for threatening to renew a dormant criminal investigation against a potential candidate for public office in order to dissuade the candidate from running); Bruce A. Green &amp; Rebecca Roiphe, Who Should Police Politicization of the DOJ?, 35 Notre Dame J.L. Ethics &amp; Pub. Pol’y 671, 681 (2021) (noting that the Arizona Supreme Court disbarred the elected chief prosecutor of Maricopa County, Arizona, and his deputy, in part, for misusing their power to advance the chief prosecutor’s partisan political interests) . Finally, given the highly generalized accusations of weaponization, weighed against the strength of the evidence against Adams, a court will likely question whether that basis is pretextual. See, e.g. , United States v. Greater Blouse, Skirt &amp; Neckwear Contractors, 228 F. Supp. 483, 487 (S.D.N.Y. 1964)(courts “ should be satisfied that the reasons advanced for the proposed dismissal are substantial and the real grounds upon which the application is based”)</em></p><p><em>I remain baffled by the rushed and superficial process by which this decision was reached, in seeming collaboration with Adams’s counsel and without my direct input on the ultimate stated rationales for dismissal. Mr. Bove admonished me to be mindful of my obligation to zealously defend the interests of the United States and to advance good-faith arguments on behalf of the Administration. I hope you share my view that soliciting and considering the concerns of the U.S. Attorney overseeing the case serves rather than hinders that goal, and that we can find time to meet.</em></p></blockquote><p>But wait, it gets better! There’s a footnote in Sassoon’s letter that tells you everything you need to know about how modern corruption works. The old-school way was to have your shady meetings in smoke-filled back rooms. The new way, apparently, is to have them in official conference rooms while actively preventing anyone from taking notes:</p><blockquote><p><em>I attended a meeting on January 31, 2025, with Mr. Bove, Adams’s counsel, and members of my office. Adams’s attorneys repeatedly urged what amounted to a quid pro quo, indicating that Adams would be in a position to assist with the Department’s enforcement priorities only if the indictment were dismissed. Mr. Bove admonished a member of my team who took notes during that meeting and directed the collection of those notes at the meeting’s conclusion</em></p></blockquote><p>Nothing quite says you know you’re engaging in some shady ass shit like demanding you collect the notes of anyone in attendance.</p><p>What makes this story particularly significant is who’s blowing the whistle. Sassoon isn’t some “woke prosecutor” that the MAGA world can easily dismiss. She’s a card-carrying member of the conservative legal establishment who, until this week, was seen as a rising star in those circles. Her willingness to sacrifice her standing in that world to uphold basic constitutional principles reveals just how far the corruption has spread — and perhaps offers a glimmer of hope that some institutional guardrails still hold.</p><p>Sassoon’s stand has triggered a cascade of resignations within SDNY, with seven prosecutors (and counting) choosing to walk away rather than participate in this corruption of justice. The latest resignation letter, <a href=\"https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/25536146/hagan-scotten-resignation-letter.pdf\">a scorching indictment from lead prosecutor Hagan Scotten</a>, is particularly noteworthy. Scotten — who clerked for both Justices Roberts and Kavanaugh and explicitly states his support for the Trump administration — makes it clear that this isn’t about politics; it’s about fundamental principles of justice being trampled for political gain.</p><blockquote><p><em>There is a tradition in public service of resigning in a last-ditch effort to head off a serious mistake. Some will view the mistake you are committing here in the light of their generally negative views of the new Administration. I do not share those views. I can even understand how a Chief Executive whose background is in business and politics might see the contemplated dismissal-with-leverage as a good, if distasteful, deal. But any assistant U.S. attorney would know that our laws and traditions do not allow using the prosecutorial power to influence other citizens, much less elected officials, in this way.</em><strong><em>If no lawyer within earshot of the President is willing to give him that advice, then I expect you will eventually find someone who is enough of a fool, or enough of a coward, to file your motion. But it was never going to be me.</em></strong></p></blockquote><p>Scotten’s prediction proved grimly prophetic. As <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/14/justice-department-officials-resign-eric-adams-charges\">reported just hours ago</a>, Bove and Bondi found their willing executioner — though the circumstances reveal yet another layer of institutional corruption:</p><blockquote><p><em>The prosecutor acquiesced to file the motion in an attempt to spare other career staff from potentially being fired by Emil Bove, the acting US deputy attorney general and former personal lawyer to Trump, sources briefed on the matter told Reuters. The news agency named the lawyer as Ed Sullivan, a veteran career prosecutor, who agreed to alleviate pressure on his colleagues in the department’s public integrity section of 30 attorneys, two sources said, after his team was given an hour by Bove to decide between them who would file the motion.</em></p><p><em>“This is not a capitulation – this is a coercion,” one of the people briefed on the meeting later told Reuters. “That person, in my mind, is a hero.” The whole section had reportedly discussed resigning en masse.</em></p></blockquote><p>The cruel irony of forcing the Public Integrity Section to compromise its own integrity isn’t lost on anyone. This is how institutions die — not with a bang, but with an ultimatum.</p><p>There’s a special kind of institutional poetry here: The Public Integrity Section was given an hour to decide who would compromise their integrity. And someone did, not out of cowardice or foolishness, but to protect their colleagues. “A hero,” his colleague called him, and maybe that’s right. But it’s the kind of heroism that only exists in broken systems.</p><p>The NY Times has revealed even more disturbing details about the behind-the-scenes machinations. In what reads like a playbook for corrupting justice, Bove apparently <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/13/nyregion/adams-lawyers-justice-department-dismissal.html\"><em>coached Adams’ legal team</em></a> (including Alex Spiro, better known as Elon Musk’s go-to counsel) in a wink-wink-nudge-nudge fashion on exactly what political commitments would make the charges disappear.</p><blockquote><p><em>During the meeting, Mr. Bove signaled that the decision about whether to dismiss the case had nothing to do with its legal merits.</em></p><p><em>Instead, Mr. Bove said he was interested in whether the case was hindering Mr. Adams’s leadership, particularly with regard to the city’s ability to cooperate with the federal government on Mr. Trump’s crackdown on illegal immigration.</em></p><p><em>Mr. Bove also said he was interested in whether the case, brought by the former U.S. attorney, Damian Williams, was a politically motivated prosecution meant to hurt Mr. Adams’s re-election prospects.</em></p><p><em>In her letter to Ms. Bondi, Ms. Sassoon said that she was “baffled by the rushed and superficial process by which this decision was reached, in seeming collaboration with Adams’s counsel and without my direct input on the ultimate stated rationales for dismissal.”</em></p></blockquote><p>There’s something almost elegant about it, in a horrifying sort of way. The Justice Department has managed to transform a corruption prosecution into what amounts to a compliance manual for corruption. It’s like they’ve created a template: “Here’s how to trade criminal charges for political favors while maintaining plausible deniability.” And the really wild part? This is all happening after years of the MAGA world screaming about supposed “lawfare” against conservatives. Turns out they weren’t complaining about weaponized justice — they were planning how to do it themselves.</p><p>History rhymes: While mass resignations of principled lawyers helped topple Nixon’s presidency, in Trump’s second term they’ve become just another item in the daily digest of institutional erosion. The difference this time? It’s not the usual suspects sounding the alarm. Instead, it’s career conservatives — products of the Federalist Society pipeline — who are putting their careers on the line to preserve what’s left of prosecutorial independence.</p><p>As we’ve <a href=\"https://www.techdirt.com/2025/02/12/gop-is-quietly-freaking-out-about-elon-time-for-them-to-take-a-stand/\">previously discussed</a>, any path through this constitutional crisis requires principled conservatives to find their voice. The fact that it’s taking career prosecutors to do what elected Republicans won’t speaks volumes about where the real courage in conservative circles resides.</p><p>The question now isn’t just whether our institutions can survive this assault, but whether these acts of principled resistance can inspire others before the machinery of justice is fully converted into a tool of political control. The American experiment has survived previous challenges through the courage of individuals willing to place principle above party. We’re about to find out if enough of those individuals still exist.</p><p> Incredibly, that report that a prosecutor had agreed to file the dismissal turned out to not be accurate. Many hours later, after no such filing was actually made a few very bizarre things happened. First, Emil Bove <a href=\"https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.nysd.628916/gov.uscourts.nysd.628916.121.0_2.pdf\">filed a notice of appearance</a> in the case. That is… not normal.</p><p>Finally, the “nolle prosequi” (a notice saying “we no longer want to prosecute”) <a href=\"https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.nysd.628916/gov.uscourts.nysd.628916.122.0_4.pdf\">was filed</a>. But even the way it was filed is weird and somewhat unprecedented. Two lawyers, including Ed Sullivan (who was mentioned above as effectively agreeing to be the fool to protect his coworkers) signed , but they did not sign the final statement. Instead, there was a further “order” from the DOJ, signed by Bove alone, telling the Court to effectively dismiss the case: </p><p>Even the language here is bizarre. The prosecutors don’t get to “direct” the Court to do anything. That’s likely why Bacon and Sullivan signed the part about “respectfully requests” that the Court issue an order. But Bove leaps in, acting like he gets to order around the judge, and separately signs that part.</p><p>What will be interesting now, is to see what Judge Dale Ho does.</p>","contentLength":15455,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"OpenAI says its board of directors ‘unanimously’ rejects Elon Musk’s bid","url":"https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/14/openai-says-its-board-of-directors-unanimously-rejects-musks-bid/","date":1739569507,"author":"Kyle Wiggers","guid":80,"unread":true,"content":"<p>OpenAI’s board of directors has “unanimously” rejected billionaire Elon Musk’s offer to buy the nonprofit that effectively governs OpenAI, the company said on Friday.

Although the usage of FEM is an avenue that will not be closed in future work, the large number of parameters to be set experimentally for each segment (Young’s modulus, moment of inertia. . . ), given that the manufacturing process is so variable meant that, in this first phase, we opted to use some type of PAUL modelling based on data collection.</p><p>\\\nThe output of the system is taken as the position and orientation reached by the final end –thus, at this stage, all the positions of the intermediate segments are ignored– and as input, the inflation times of each of the bladders. As there were not enough pressure sensors available at the time of the construction of the robot, it was decided to take inflation time as an input variable. As the working pressure is limited by the pressure limiting valve and the flow rate into each bladder can be assumed to be constant, the time is equivalent to the volume of air introduced into each cavity.</p><p>\\\nAll the control options considered have in common the need for a large amount of empirical data, which leads to the need to develop an experimental design to systematise the collection of this data. Since the capture of this information is done in different phases and the datasets have to represent the behaviour of the robot in an objective way, the re-applicability of the experiment takes on special importance.</p><p>\\\nThe data stored in the datasets was the position of the robot tip and the set of inflation times that achieve this configuration. The aforementioned limitation that only two of the three bladders in the segment are inflated reduces redundancies. As previously stated, more than two segments lead to redundancies, which implies that the inverse kinematic model of the robot can have multiple solutions.</p><p>\\\nThe data collection process involves several sequential steps. Initially, a set number of samples is determined. For each sample, Matlab commands dispatch a random combination of nine inflation times, corresponding to each valve of PAUL, to the actuation bench. Times are generated below a maximum time limit Tmax, and ensuring that only two cavities per segment are inflated. Following this, the robot’s bladders are inflated based on the sent times. Subsequently, the vision system’s two cameras capture images to determine the position and orientation of the robot’s end. This entire procedure is repeated for the specified number of iterations, and upon completion, the collected data is stored in the dataset</p><p>\\\nThe information on swelling times is stored as a percentage, with a value of 0 corresponding to a zero swelling of that segment and 100 corresponding to Tmax, the swelling for the maximum number of milliseconds defined for this data collection session. This value Tmax is stored, together with the values, in the dataset, in order to be able to compare different datasets. The reason for this coding comes from the lack of information, a priori, on what is the maximum pressure that a PAUL bladder admits. Although it is true that it was experimentally determined that inflation times of more than 1500 ms in a row led to punctures, the application of lower times during a repeated number of cycles also generated leaks. On this basis, it was decided never to inflate any valve, either in one or several steps, more than 1000 ms.</p><p>\\\nAlong with the inflation times of each bladder, the position and orientation reached by the end tip is stored, based on the camera readings. In particular, the position of the green marker and the orientation of the trihedron are stored. The latter is expressed in Euler angles, as it is a much efficient form of storage than a rotation matrix. In addition, the dataset also contains metadata from the collection process that are believed to influence the results, such as the pneumatic line pressure or the ambient temperature.</p><p>\\\nSome aspects in the pneumatic system merit attention. Initially, bladder inflation and deflation are not symmetrical processes. Geometric constraints in the pneumatic components result in a lower deflation rate compared to inflation. Consequently, when the PAUL receives a deflation time, it multiplies it by an empirically derived factor, approximately 1.45 for a 1.2 bar working pressure. This multiplier compensates for the discrepancy between inflation and deflation times of a singular group of bladders, ensuring that the deflation time aligns with the time required to reach the same inflation point.</p><p>\\\nSimilarly, although it is physically possible to inflate several valves at the same time, it has been shown that this parallel flow distribution means that the effective fillings of each valve are not the same as if they were inflated individually. To prevent this phenomenon, it was decided to inflate each bladder individually both during the data acquisition process and utterly, when PAUL was asked to reach certain positions.</p><p>\\\nFinally, there are hysteresis phenomena in the silicone that cause the position reached by inflating for a time t to be different from the position reached by inflating first for a time t1 and then for a time t2 = t − t1. The strategy employed to tackle this problem was to capture the dataset bringing PAUL back to its zero position between each sample. Nevertheless, when controlling the robot in open-loop this is not possible, or, at least, not desirable, as one may wish to follow trajectories or travel through a sequence of points. Therefore, transitioning from position x1 to x2 requires an additional factor of 1.2, also derived experimentally, to account for hysteresis effects.</p><p>Once the dataset is generated, it can be used to model the behaviour of PAUL for open-loop control. It is foreseen, as a future line, to train a neural network for the direct kinematics and another one for the inverse kinematics. However, given the large amount of data that may be required (in [62] 24389 samples are used for a three-segment robot like this one), a table look-up method has been used for this work.</p><p>\\\nThe method for direct kinematics –which allows obtaining the position and orientation of the final end of the robot from the inflation times of the nine bladders– consists of searching, in the generated dataset in the previous step, the three inflation time values located at a shorter distance from the inflation time given as a reference. Obviously, if the set of inflation times sought were in the table, the value associated with these times would be returned as a result of the direct kinematic model. Otherwise, the average of the position and orientation values associated with the three closest inflation times, weighted by the distance (Euclidean norm) existing between each of them and the values of reference inflation times, is returned as the position and orientation value of the robot.</p><p>\\\n\\\nwith them, it is possible to calculate the position returned by the direct kinematic model using the expression:</p>","contentLength":7812,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"NATO backs its first cohort of European dual-use startups","url":"https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/14/nato-backs-its-first-cohort-of-european-dual-use-startups/","date":1739564172,"author":"Mike Butcher","guid":75,"unread":true,"content":"<p>With both Vice President J.D.

These are made by pouring paraffin wax into previously made female moulds (Figure 5a).</p><p>\\\nAfter half an hour, the wax has solidified and the cores can be removed and inserted into the mould (Figure 5b). The mould consists of four 3D printed parts (two sides, a bottom cap and a top grip on which the cores rest) which are screwed together and then sealed with a hot silicone bead to prevent leakage during subsequent curing (Figure 5c).</p><p>\\\nThe silicone can then be poured into the mould, which must be filled to the top to counteract the aforementioned shrinkage. In particular, TinSil8015 requires a mass ratio of 10:1 liquid to catalyst. For the dimensions of the segment, about 175 g of total mixture are required.</p><p>\\\nThe curing process lasts 24 hours at ambient temperature (Figure 5d), after which it can be removed from the mould. It may be necessary to use a scalpel to remove the silicone burrs (Figure 5e).</p><p>\\\nOnce the segment has been built, the cores that have been used to create the bladders are removed. While the wood can be removed by pulling, it is necessary to apply heat to the segment to remove the wax. Thus, it is first placed in an oven at 110 ◦C (Figure 5f) and then immersed in a boiling water bath for 15 minutes, which ensures the elimination of the residual traces of wax (Figure 5g).</p><p>\\\nSince the males are through, it is required to close the lower part of the segment. To do this, a layer of silicone is poured onto the plate of Figure 5h, glued onto the segment and left to cure for 24 hours. Finally, the pneumatic tubes are joined to the segment, adhering them with cyanoacrylate and strengthening the tightness with the usage of plastic flanges (Figure 5i).</p><p>\\\nThe final result, a functional segment is depicted in Figure 6. Experimentally, it is found that its weight is 161 g and that, as designed, it has a height of 100 mm and an external diameter of 45 mm.</p><p>Within the robot, the function of the pneumatic bench is to control the flow of compressed air from the compressor according to the control signals. Specifically, the PAUL bench consists of 6 pairs of 2/2 valves (SMC VDW20BZ1D model) and 3/2 valves (SMC Y100 model) placed in series, which will therefore allow up to 12 degrees of freedom. Both are shown in Figure 7. The physical characteristics of the 2/2 valves limited the total pressure of the assembly to 4 bar, but to reduce the risk of segment leakage, it was reduced with a flow regulator to 2 bar. Figure 8 presents a schematic of the pneumatic circuit.</p><p>\\\n\\\nThe valves are operated via 24 V voltage signals. A MOSFET (model IRF540) is the switch in charge of managing them. Initially, the use of relays was considered, but the high current they would consume made their use unfeasible. An Arduino Due was chosen as the bench controller. A PC power supply, capable of supplying up to 8.5 A, is responsible for powering the unit, whose final layout is illustrated in Figure 9.</p>","contentLength":3825,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"No Startup Has Ever Failed Because it Didn’t Have a Blog","url":"https://hackernoon.com/no-startup-has-ever-failed-because-it-didnt-have-a-blog?source=rss","date":1739559603,"author":"susie liu","guid":226,"unread":true,"content":"<p>\\\nSomewhere along the way, startup marketing got hijacked by creator economy logic.</p><ul><li>“If I build an audience, I’ll have an easier time selling.” </li><li>“If I post valuable content, customers will come to me.” </li><li>“Content is how you earn trust.”</li></ul><blockquote><p>No startup has ever failed because it didn’t have a blog.

You think you’re building something, but really, you’re just shuffling pixels around and calling it momentum. <strong>==You’ll die because you’re wasting your best thinking on being interesting instead of being necessary.==</strong></p><p>\\\nDon’t try to be a media company when you haven’t even figured out how to be a business.</p><h3><strong>You Ignore Your Most Powerful Asset: Your Product</strong></h3><p>\\\nThe best startups don’t need a perfect LinkedIn strategy. They need a product so good that people can’t shut up about it.</p><ul><li>Tesla didn’t become Tesla because Musk wrote aspirational posts. (Tesla happened, then people started dissecting every Elon tweet.) </li><li>Superhuman didn’t win because they ranked for “best email productivity tool”.</li><li>Notion didn’t explode because they had a “high-value” newsletter.</li></ul><p>\\\nThey each built something so good that content wasn’t necessary.</p><p>\\\n<strong>==But content marketing makes you spend more time talking about your product than making it actually worth talking about.==</strong> If you’re creating Canva graphics explaining why your product is amazing, ask yourself: <em>Why isn’t it obvious already?</em></p><h3><strong>You’re Playing To Your Weakness</strong></h3><p>\\\nIf you’re a tech founder, chances are your biggest strength isn’t crafting “valuable content.” But content marketing throws you into the most crowded, attention-starved battlefield on earth that’s populated by all the creative genius humanity has to offer: the Internet. </p><p>\\\nContent marketing pulls you away from your strengths. It forces you into a slow, bloated, competitive game where you’re fighting against seasoned creators and media companies—people whose  is content. <em>And you’re out here thinking you can compete?</em></p><p>\\\nWhile you’re wasting time learning how to be a copywriter, you’re neglecting the strengths that gave you the guts to build a company in the first place. </p><p>\\\n<strong>Content marketing is a wait-and-see game.</strong></p><ul></ul><p>Do this long enough, and <strong>you'll start convincing yourself that the reason you're not making progress is because you haven’t published enough</strong>. So, you rinse and repeat, cranking out more content—and waiting for something to happen. <strong><em>I promise you, nothing will</em></strong>. <strong>==Unless you’re a media company, the real problem won’t be solved through content volume==</strong>. Look at the Airbnb guys. They tackled crappy check-in rates by bringing their cameras into homes and taking better photos, not by blogging about the future of holiday stays. </p><p>\\\nFounders love content marketing because it’s <strong><em>a safe way to feel productive without doing the uncomfortable shit</em></strong>. Well, if you want to stay away from the uncomfortable, you should consider going back to your desk job. </p><h3><strong>You’re Sprinting For The Wrong Finish Line</strong></h3><p>\\\n==Content marketing subtly shifts the goalpost of what success looks like.== </p><ul><li>Instead of $$$ in the bank, founders start measuring social impressions. </li><li>Instead of customers using the product, they’re tracking newsletter signups. </li><li>Instead of winning market share, they’re focused on LinkedIn comments.</li></ul><p>\\\n Awareness and engagement doesn’t pay the bills. Real growth is customers in, cash in. If you don’t know the difference between attention and action, content marketing is eating your brain. <strong><em>Are you really growing, or have you just gotten more people to consume free content?</em></strong></p><h3><strong>You’re Killing Your Brand</strong></h3><p>\\\nWeird, right? You’d think viral content will help you build your brand. Nope, because going viral means you’ve got to jump on every buzzword, every new format, and every other trend because it’s what everyone’s talking about. Well, trends don’t care two cents about what your brand stands for. </p><p>\\\n<strong>Every time you chase a trend, you’re stretching your brand thin, trying to force it into a mold that doesn’t fit.</strong> You’re watering down your purpose for a quick hit, all while ignoring the fact that <strong>==<em>building a memorable brand means sticking to your guns, even if it’s what the algorithm despises.</em>==</strong></p><h2><strong>Inbound’s Still In. You Just Don’t Need Content To Do It.</strong></h2><blockquote><p>The content marketing trend is a byproduct of people misunderstanding HubSpot’s whole inbound marketing thing. </p><p>\\\n  Inbound was and still is genius, but inbound marketing was never about “just create content.” It was about <strong>==creating undeniable value before asking for the sale.==</strong> (That, and not relying on paid ads for awareness.) </p></blockquote><p>\\\nHubSpot made content work because information was scarce in 2006—they gave away what no one else would. Today, everyone’s got an “ultimate guide” to something. And if they don’t, GPT can make something up based on a prompt. The problem now isn’t lack of content. </p><p>\\\n<strong><em>Here’s how to do inbound marketing in the post-content age.</em></strong></p><h3><strong>1. Figure Out If Content Even Makes Sense for You</strong></h3><p>\\\nBefore you waste another hour on a blog post, ask yourself:</p><ul><li>Is my audience actively looking for information, but struggling to find it? </li><li>Is there a knowledge gap that makes them hesitate to buy? </li><li>Are my competitors hoarding insights instead of sharing them?</li></ul><p>\\\nIf the answer is yes, fine. Write. Publish. Own the space. If the answer is no, STOP. No one needs your “Top 10 Trends” list. <em>They have Google and chatbots for that.</em></p><p>\\\nKnow what’s better than teaching people how to do something? ***Making sure they never have to learn it in the first place. ***</p><p>\\\nYou can write another 1,500-word thesis. <strong>Or, you can build something—a tool, a feature, an experience—that solves the same problem but without needing people to read a bunch of text</strong>. Look at the content that’s dominating your space—the posts that get all the likes, shares, and comments. Then ask yourself: <strong><em>How can I make this educational BS obsolete?</em></strong></p><blockquote><p>Here’s a thought: Tell your audience exactly how much time and money you’re burning on content—and then tell them you’re ditching it to build something free that actually helps them. \"We were going to spend $20K this quarter on content, but instead, we’re using it to build a free AI-powered email draft generator for sales teams. Tell us what you need, and we’ll make it happen.\" </p></blockquote><p>\\\nPeople will talk about it. They’ll share it, they’ll use it, <strong><em>and they’ll remember the one who actually did something instead of just saying something.</em></strong></p><h3><strong>3. Content Isn’t The Only Thing That Gets Organic Attention</strong></h3><p>\\\nThe other principle of inbound marketing?  Yes, content generates organic awareness and conversation. So do a lot of other things. . This is a last resort because stunts could backfire (but for a startup, any PR is good PR), but at least you’re exercising your creative brain cells. </p><blockquote><p>If you have to force people to see your content, why not just skip the middle step and force them to see your product instead? </p></blockquote><p>\\\nStop badgering GPT for content ideas, and use that time to hijack attention—starting fights on X, sitting on the doorsteps of potential clients for weeks on end with a cardboard sign, <strong><em>anything that gets people talking about your company now, not in six months when Google decides to bless you with traffic.</em></strong></p><p>\\\n(Tip: When pulling a stunt, ==just make sure it barely costs you anything to execute.== That way you won’t hate yourself if you don’t get returns.) </p><h2><strong>Final Thoughts: Why Are You Marketing Like a Coward?</strong></h2><p>\\\nYou built something from nothing. You ignored the safe path, told the doubters to shove it, and bet on yourself. You made a move.</p><p>\\\n<strong>So where’d that nerve go?</strong></p><blockquote><p>The second it came time to market, you swapped instinct for “best practices.” </p><p>\\\n  ==Innovation doesn’t come from following rules, and attention won’t be earned through compliance.== </p><p>\\\n  It’s taken. It’s ripped out of the market’s hands by people willing to do what no one else is doing.</p></blockquote><h3>Treat marketing like you treat your product—or get used to being ignored.</h3>","contentLength":8455,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Police Union Still Insists NY Misconduct Records Are Secret Despite Court Decisions Saying Otherwise","url":"https://www.techdirt.com/2025/02/14/police-union-still-insists-ny-misconduct-records-are-secret-despite-court-decisions-saying-otherwise/","date":1739559300,"author":"Tim Cushing","guid":669,"unread":true,"content":"<p>When you’re playing with house money, playing one losing hand after another isn’t a sign of tenacity.

At some point, you’d think they would experience some fleeting shame against lighting <a href=\"https://www.techdirt.com/2023/04/24/new-york-court-rules-state-police-cant-keep-hiding-its-misconduct-records-from-the-public/\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"https://www.techdirt.com/2023/04/24/new-york-court-rules-state-police-cant-keep-hiding-its-misconduct-records-from-the-public/\">their contributors’ money</a> on fire repeatedly, but the sad fact is that most cops represented by New York’s Police Benevolent Association (PBA) are more than happy to keep burning their own money if it means there’s even the most remote chance their past misdeeds won’t come back to haunt them.</p><p>There have been plenty of legal challenges against the repeal of 50-a, the shorthand that refers to the law that — <a href=\"https://www.techdirt.com/2020/06/12/new-york-legislators-dump-law-that-allowed-pds-to-withhold-officers-disciplinary-records/\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"https://www.techdirt.com/2020/06/12/new-york-legislators-dump-law-that-allowed-pds-to-withhold-officers-disciplinary-records/\">up until June 2020</a> — gave law enforcement agencies the option to withhold misconduct records requested by members of the public.</p><blockquote><p><em>The Police Benevolent Association of the City of New York asked a seven-judge panel of the New York Court of appeals to apply retroactivity analysis on the question of whether or not state lawmakers intended a confidentiality provision enacted in 1976 to be conferred to police officers as a vested right after it was repealed in 2020.</em></p><p><em>“We’re just stuck, at best, with a very ambiguous record,” Police Benevolent Association lawyer Matthew Daly told the appeals court on Thursday afternoon. “Policy arguments can be made on both sides — there are policy arguments for disclosure, but there’s also policy to protect rights.”</em></p><p><em>Fighting off document requests from the New York Post, the union says the mandate to retroactively make those old records public would infringe vested rights of police officers and other covered employees “who for more than four decades relied on the statutory confidentiality in deciding how to respond to disciplinary matters.”</em></p></blockquote><p>PBA attorney Matthew Daly is, at best, being disingenuous here. The PBA is asking this court to basically codify something that isn’t present in the law: a limitation that prevents disclosure of records generated before the law’s repeal in 2020. </p><p>As the court <a href=\"https://www.techdirt.com/2023/12/08/ny-appeals-court-says-law-enforcement-cant-withhold-misconduct-records-containing-only-unproven-allegations/\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"https://www.techdirt.com/2023/12/08/ny-appeals-court-says-law-enforcement-cant-withhold-misconduct-records-containing-only-unproven-allegations/\">pointed out in late 2023</a>, there’s nothing in the law that forbids access to records created prior to this repeal. </p><blockquote><p><em>By their nature, FOIL requests seek records that were generated prior to the request date. In amending the Public Officers Law to provide for the disclosure of records relating to law enforcement disciplinary proceedings, </em><strong><em>the Legislature did not limit disclosure under FOIL to records generated after June 12, 2020, and we will not impose such a limitation ourselves</em>. </strong></p></blockquote><p>Yet, the PBA persists, guided by little more than its access to other people’s money and a burning desire to progress the rot in its barrel of apples by pretending there’s no way the legislature intended to make this law retroactive. It’s a stupid point to make, as NY Post attorney, Jeremy Chase, told the court:</p><blockquote><p><em>“The Legislature, if they wanted to carve out this period from 1976 to June 2020, they easily could have done that, they didn’t do that,” he said.</em></p></blockquote><p>This leaves the PBA as the last bulwark against… um… serving the public trust. If the PBA (or the NYPD officers it represents) actually cared about rebuilding trust and setting it back on the path towards earning the nickname “New York’s Finest,” it wouldn’t be blowing cash in court trying to keep its dirty laundry buried under empty body cam boxes in the back of the metaphorical closet. Instead, it has chosen to spend nearly a half-decade fighting this small move towards greater transparency despite having lost at every judicial level to this point. </p>","contentLength":3931,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Daily Deal: Linux/UNIX Training Bundle","url":"https://www.techdirt.com/2025/02/14/daily-deal-linux-unix-training-bundle/","date":1739558729,"author":"Daily Deal","guid":668,"unread":true,"content":"<p>Linux and UNIX operating systems have become increasingly popular in commercial computing environments.

As a millennial, Xiao witnessed life before the internet as we know it and how much easier things became after it became more accessible to everyday people. He is now the co-founder and president of SuretyNow, a company that works to help protect the public from dishonest businesses.</p><h3><strong>A Heart and Talent for Tech</strong></h3><p>\\\nAfter graduating high school, Xiao attended Queen's University in Canada for commerce and computer science. Though his original goal was to go into consulting and finance, he made a decision to switch fully into tech after an unfulfilling internship at an asset management firm his first summer. During this time, he was balancing the internship while working on a startup with friends, eventually leading him to leave the asset management internship behind to dedicate his time to that startup.</p><p>\\\nHowever, Xiao did not know how to code, so he began taking computer science classes to expand his horizons. He interned at a Toronto startup called Nuology and then parlayed that internship into full-time roles at Google, where he worked on the Google Ads and Google Stadia teams.</p><h2><strong>Making an Impact with the Biggest Names in Tech</strong></h2><p>Breaking into the tech field was difficult for Xiao, partly because he was new to the industry and didn't go to a school with a strong history of tech company recruitment. As a result, he worked to better himself in technology through education and went from zero tech experience to interning with Google within three years. At Google Stadia, he helped build Stadia's publisher analytics platform from zero to launch. He helped facilitate an analytics platform used by around 30 publishers at its peak, including Ubisoft and Electronic Arts.</p><p>As the driving force behind <a href=\"https://suretynow.com/\">SuretyNow</a>, Xiao's role extends far beyond the title of co-founder and president. He single-handedly built the company's website, developed the internal tooling and infrastructure, and now manages multiple teams. His strategic vision and hands-on approach have been instrumental in the company's success, making it a prime example of his entrepreneurial prowess.</p><p>\\\nAt SuretyNow, Xiao says that their agents can produce two times the industry average due to the automation they've built to make them more efficient. SuretyNow serves businesses who wish to buy surety to work like other modern tools they love, all with fast and affordable customer service. With exceptional customer service and a commitment to innovation through technology, they aim to educate and deliver peace of mind with their expertise in surety.</p><p>\\\nXiao's future goals for SuretyNow are simple: to lead and inspire others by hiring and mentoring interns. Ultimately, Xiao wants to make buying surety bonds and insurance as easy as purchasing a keychain on Amazon—a fact that can be difficult for some and challenging for others.</p>","contentLength":2882,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Choosing Wallets for Decentralized Applications","url":"https://hackernoon.com/choosing-wallets-for-decentralized-applications?source=rss","date":1739557803,"author":"EVEDEX","guid":224,"unread":true,"content":"<p>\\\nFor modern blockchain applications, it’s crucial to balance ease of use for experienced users with accessibility for newcomers. One of the first challenges for beginners is selecting and creating a wallet. Wallet interaction must be simple enough to maintain high conversion rates while preserving blockchain’s core advantage - decentralization - without compromising user experience (UX).</p><h3><strong>Two Audiences: Crypto Enthusiasts and Regular Users</strong></h3><p>When developing blockchain solutions, it’s important to account for varying user experience levels. In the context of decentralized exchanges like EVEDEX, two main audiences can be identified:</p><ol><li><strong>Crypto Enthusiasts (\"Cryptans\"</strong>) – users who are already familiar with blockchain technology, have experience with cold wallets, and value autonomy and decentralization.</li><li><strong>Regular Users (“Normies”)</strong> – those who want to trade and interact with decentralized financial instruments without having to dive into the technical aspects of blockchain.</li></ol><p>\\\nFor the second group, social logins and embedded wallets are especially important, as they make the onboarding process and platform interaction as seamless as possible.</p><h3><strong>Why is Social Login Important?</strong></h3><p>Social login plays a key role in lowering the entry barrier for new users. Traditional crypto wallets require users to store seed phrases, install extensions, and connect hardware devices. This is complicated, especially for those just starting their journey in Web3.</p><p>\\\nEVEDEX offers a built-in wallet with social login, allowing users to sign in via Google. This reduces the likelihood of losing access and makes the platform more convenient for a broader audience.</p><p>\\\n<strong>Advantages of Social Login:</strong></p><ul><li>Registration takes only a few seconds.</li><li>No need for a seed phrase.</li><li>Access to the account via multiple devices.</li><li>More users can try to use DeFi without technical difficulties.</li></ul><p>\\\nThe social login concept allows users to instantly enter the platform without memorizing complex seed phrases or going through lengthy registration processes. This is particularly important for newcomers encountering DeFi for the first time and who might be discouraged by the complexity of traditional wallets. By simplifying the login process, we lower the entry barrier for new users and grow the potential audience, allowing more people to explore decentralized finance effortlessly.</p><h3><strong>Why is Wallet Choice Important?</strong></h3><p>One of the main problems with modern blockchain solutions is the complexity of the first experience for new users. To start using decentralized applications, one must learn many new concepts, such as private keys, transactions, fees, and security. This discourages less technically inclined users and significantly reduces engagement. Therefore, choosing the most suitable wallet technology is not just a matter of convenience but also a way to grow the audience and improve the exchange’s conversion rates.</p><p>\\\nEVEDEX is a decentralized exchange focused on providing an interface similar to traditional centralized platforms. To achieve this goal, wallets must combine decentralization (user-controlled funds) with Web2-level convenience.</p><ul><li>Sponsored transactions or fee payments in non-native currencies</li><li>Two-factor authentication (2FA) support</li><li>Cross-device account access</li></ul><p>The fastest way to implement these features is through Wallets as a Service (WaaS) solutions like Magic, Fireblocks, or Thirdweb.</p><ul><li>: Providers offer ready-made solutions with social login and 2FA support. Users do not need to understand blockchain technicalities, the wallet is ready to use immediately after registration.</li><li>: Key storage is distributed, and the provider does not have direct access to the user's funds. Additionally, two-factor authentication significantly reduces user risks.</li><li>: Users can quickly start using the wallet without complicated setup or seed phrase storage, relying only on social networks or email.</li></ul><ul><li><strong>Limited Blockchain Support</strong>: Some providers only work with specific networks.</li><li>: Account recovery is implemented strictly according to the provider's mechanics.</li><li>: For large user volumes, WaaS services can become prohibitively expensive.</li><li><strong>Geographical Restrictions</strong>: Providers may block access for users from certain regions.</li></ul><p>Account Abstraction is a technology that allows the use of smart contracts as wallets. Unlike classic wallets, which rely on private keys, smart contract wallets provide virtually unlimited flexibility in implementing interaction logic.</p><p>\\\nCurrently, the technology is actively developing on EVM-compatible blockchains, thanks to the ERC-4337 standard, which enables AA without changes to Ethereum's base protocol. However, this increases the complexity of the solution's architecture.</p><p>\\\nFor implementing a wallet with account recovery and two-factor authentication, the optimal approach is to choose a standard open-source smart account wallet implementation that is well-tested and audited.</p><h3>Advantages of AA for Users</h3><ul><li><strong>Flexibility and Customization</strong>: The ability to tailor wallet logic to user needs and preferred verification methods.</li><li><strong>Decentralization and Full Asset Control</strong>: Eliminates risks of account blocking or access restrictions due to the absence of databases and centralized service controls.</li><li><strong>Access Recovery Through Pre-Defined Mechanisms</strong>: Useful in case of key loss or other unforeseen circumstances.</li></ul><h3>Disadvantages of AA (Primarily for Projects, Not Users):</h3><ul><li><strong>Complexity of Implementation</strong>: Integrating AA with 2FA and recovery mechanisms requires significant amounts of resources.</li><li>: It is possible to encounter bugs as the technology is still evolving rapidly.</li><li>Need for AA Infrastructure Deployment in New Networks.</li></ul><p>EVEDEX is actively exploring hybrid solutions for maximum user convenience. One key aspect is the integration of Account Abstraction for enhanced security and user interaction with the platform. The platform offers embedded wallets with social login while maintaining decentralization. This allows traders to use a DEX with the ease of a CEX, without having to trust a centralized entity.</p><p>\\\nAdditionally, EVEDEX is testing the possibility of sponsored transactions, enabling users to pay fees in project tokens, as well as flexible access recovery mechanisms without handing over private keys.</p><p>EVEDEX allows users to choose between different interaction options:</p><ol><li> (Recommended for Beginners):</li></ol><ul><li>Quickly create an embedded wallet.</li></ul><ol start=\"2\"><li><strong>Connecting an Existing Wallet</strong>:</li></ol><ul><li>Use MetaMask, Trust Wallet, Ledger, and other wallets.</li><li>Full control over assets.</li><li>Requires seed phrase storage.</li></ul><p>An innovative approach is combining embedded wallets with Account Abstraction. In this model, an embedded wallet is used to create and manage a smart contract (AA) wallet. This solution allows for seamless integration of social login and 2FA functionality while retaining the ability to implement custom logic at the AA wallet level.</p><p>Choosing the right wallet for decentralized applications requires balancing user convenience with decentralization principles. Embedded wallets provide quick setup and ready-made solutions but may limit flexibility and increase costs. Account Abstraction offers extensive possibilities but demands significant effort during implementation. A hybrid approach enables easy account recovery, social logins, and additional features without sacrificing wallet functionality.</p><p>\\\nEVEDEX is betting on hybrid solutions, integrating advanced technologies into a user-friendly interface to offer the best of both worlds: CEX-like convenience and DEX-level security.</p>","contentLength":7437,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Trump Admin Adds Note Rejecting ‘Gender Ideology’ on Sites Court Ordered Them to Restore","url":"https://www.404media.co/trump-admin-adds-note-rejecting-gender-ideology-on-sites-court-ordered-them-to-restore/","date":1739557545,"author":"Emanuel Maiberg","guid":745,"unread":true,"content":"<img src=\"https://www.404media.co/content/images/2025/02/CleanShot-2025-02-14-at-10.31.48@2x.png\" alt=\"Trump Admin Adds Note Rejecting ‘Gender Ideology’ on Sites Court Ordered Them to Restore\"><p>After being forced by a court order to <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/judge-orders-hhs-cdc-fda-restore-deleted-webpages-health-information/?ref=404media.co\"></a> about gender and diversity to government websites, the Trump administration has added a note to the top of those pages saying “Any information on this page promoting gender ideology is extremely inaccurate, and disconnected from the immutable biological reality that there are two sexes, male and female.”</p><div><div>Per a court order, HHS is required to restore this website as of February 14, 2025 at 11:59 p.m. Any information on this page promoting gender ideology is extremely inaccurate, and disconnected from the immutable biological reality that there are two sexes, male and female.

The deposit phase began with the launch of the Symbiotic mainnet on January 28 and completed within two weeks. The deposits occurred during a market decline triggered by President Trump’s tariff policy.</p><p>\\\nContributors participated through two vault types. One vault is managed by <a href=\"https://hyveda.xyz/\">HyveDA</a> and additional vaults are provided by partners including EtherFi, Renzo, MEV Capital, Re7, Steakhouse, Gautlet, and P2P. Investors deposited assets into the vaults to become eligible for points that will be assigned after the deposit phase and carried forward to later phases.</p><p>\\\nThe deposited funds are not subject to penalties or risks from operations. The deposit process is structured to maintain a controlled onboarding process while allowing the protocol to expand. HyveDA operates a network that uses a delegated staking system through Symbiotic’s restaking process. The network depends on the participation of nodes to maintain data availability.</p><p>\\\nThe deposit phase may affect the protocol’s progress. A group of participants engaged in the process during a period of market instability. The method for assigning points after the deposit phase may influence future participation in the ecosystem. Observers note that the outcome may serve as a reference for protocols that seek to raise funds during periods of market change.</p><p>\\\nThe experience of this deposit phase stands as a point of reference for protocols seeking similar funding processes. Future updates will determine how this approach influences the transition from the pre-testnet phase to subsequent network stages and the overall development of the protocol.</p><p>The pre-deposit event resulted in a funding limit of 50 million dollars collected from early contributors. The process relied on a deposit mechanism with a defined cap and used multiple vault options. Contributors deposited assets into a native vault and several partner vaults. The method permitted a spread of contributions across many participants during a period when market conditions were affected by external policy changes.</p><p>\\\nThe deposit process provided an opportunity to test a funding method under conditions where market sentiment was shifting. Early participants engaged in the process despite the influence of external events. The use of a points system to reward participation introduces a variable for future involvement. This points system will be carried into subsequent phases and will affect how contributors interact with the network as it develops.</p><p>\\\nThe event also offered an example of a funding process that limits resource collection through a preset cap. The method used may serve as a reference for other protocols that plan to gather funds in similar market environments. The choice to spread contributions across several vaults instead of a single source appears to reduce the concentration of deposits. This approach may have an effect on how risk is distributed among network participants.</p><p>\\\nDon’t forget to like and share the story! </p><p>:::tip\n<strong>Vested Interest Disclosure:</strong>&nbsp;This author is an independent contributor publishing via our&nbsp;.

Not in the usual way of submitting comments through a form, mind you, but by directly injecting content into their database. This seems suboptimal.</p><p>The story here is that DOGE — Elon Musk’s collection of supposed coding “geniuses” brought in to “disrupt” government inefficiency — finally launched their official website. And what they delivered is a masterclass in how not to build government infrastructure. One possibility is that they’re brilliant disruptors breaking all the rules to make things better. Another possibility is that they have no idea what they’re doing.</p><p>The latter seems a lot more likely.</p><p>Last week, it was reported that the <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/02/06/nx-s1-5289337/elon-musk-doge-treasury\">proud racist</a> 25-year-old Marko Elez had been given admin access and was <a href=\"https://www.techdirt.com/2025/02/05/a-25-year-old-is-writing-backdoors-into-the-treasurys-6-trillion-payment-system-what-could-possibly-go-wrong/\">pushing untested code</a> to the US government’s $6 trillion/year payment system. While the Treasury Department initially claimed (including in court filings!) that Elez had “read-only” access, others reported he had write access. After those reports came out, the Treasury Dept. “corrected” itself and said Elez had been <a href=\"https://www.zetter-zeroday.com/court-documents-shed-new-light-on-doge-access-and-activity-at-treasury-department/\">“accidentally” given write privileges</a> for the payments database, but only for the data, not the code. Still, they admitted that while they had put in place some security protections, it’s possible that Elez did copy some private data which “may have occasionally included screenshots of payment systems data or records.”</p><p>Now, you might think that having a racist twenty-something with admin access to trillion-dollar payment systems would concern people. But Musk’s defenders had a compelling counterargument: he must be a genius! Because… well, because Musk hired him, and Musk only hires geniuses. Or so we’re told.</p><p>The DOGE team’s actual coding prowess is turning out to be quite something. First, they decided that government transparency meant <a href=\"https://www.techdirt.com/2025/02/11/musk-promised-government-transparency-doge-delivers-maximum-secrecy/\">hiding everything from FOIA requests</a>. When questioned about this interesting interpretation of “transparency,” Musk explained that actually DOGE was being super transparent by putting everything on their website and ExTwitter account.</p><p>There was just one small problem with this explanation. At the time he said it, the DOGE website looked like this:</p><p>That was it. That was the whole website.</p><p>On Thursday, they finally launched a real website. Sort of. If by “real website” you mean “a collection of already-public information presented in misleading ways by people who don’t seem to understand what they’re looking at.” But that’s not even the interesting part.</p><p>These supposed technical geniuses managed to build what might be the least secure government website in history. Let’s start with something basic: where does the website actually live? According to <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/doge-website-is-just-one-big-x-ad/\">Wired</a>, the source code actually tells search engines that ExTwitter, not <a href=\"http://DOGE.gov\">DOGE.gov</a>, is the real home of this government information:</p><blockquote><p><em>A WIRED review of the page’s source code shows that the promotion of Musk’s own platform went deeper than replicating the posts on the homepage. The source code shows that the site’s</em><a href=\"https://moz.com/learn/seo/canonicalization\"></a><a href=\"http://x.com\"></a><a href=\"http://DOGE.gov\"></a></p><p><em>A canonical tag is a snippet of code that tells search engines what the authoritative version of a website is. It is typically used by sites with multiple pages as a search engine optimization tactic, to avoid their search ranking being diluted.</em></p><p><em>In DOGE’s case, however, the code is informing search engines that when people search for content found on</em><a href=\"http://DOGE.gov\"></a><em>, they should not show those pages in search results, but should instead display the posts on X.</em></p><p><em>“It is promoting the X account as the main source, with the website secondary,” Declan Chidlow,</em><a href=\"https://vale.rocks/\"></a><em>, tells WIRED. “This isn’t usually how things are handled, and it indicates that the X account is taking priority over the actual website itself.”</em></p></blockquote><p>If you’re not a web developer, here’s what that means: When you build a website, you can tell search engines “hey, if you find copies of this content elsewhere, this version here is the real one.” It’s like telling Google “if someone copied my site, mine is the original.”</p><p>But DOGE did the opposite. They told search engines “actually, ExTwitter has the real version of this government information. Our government website is just a copy.” Which is… an interesting choice for a federal agency? It’s a bit like the Treasury Department saying “don’t look at our official reports, just check Elon’s tweets.”</p><p>You might think that a government agency directing people away from its official website and toward the private company of its leader would raise some conflict-of-interest concerns. And you’d be right!</p><p>But wait, it gets better. Or worse. Actually, yeah, it’s worse.</p><p>Who built this government website? Through some sloppy coding, security researcher Sam Curry <a href=\"https://x.com/samwcyo/status/1889527715029557607\">figured out</a> it was DOGE employee Kyle Shutt. The same Kyle Shutt who, according to Drop Site News, <a href=\"https://www.dropsitenews.com/p/doge-fema-funding-access-social-security-numbers\">has admin access to the FEMA payments system</a>. The same Kyle Shutt who used the exact same Cloudflare ID to build Musk’s America PAC Trump campaign website. Because why maintain separate secure credentials for government systems and political campaigns when you can just… not do that?</p><p>But the real cherry on top came Thursday when people discovered something amazing about the DOGE site database:  Not “anyone with proper credentials.” Not “anyone who passes security checks.” Just… anyone. As 404 Media <a href=\"https://www.404media.co/anyone-can-push-updates-to-the-doge-gov-website-2/\">reported</a>, if you know basic database operations, you too can be a government website administrator:</p><blockquote><p><em>The <a href=\"http://doge.gov\">doge.gov</a> website that was spun up to track Elon Musk’s cuts to the federal government is insecure and pulls from a database that can be edited by anyone, according to two separate people who found the vulnerability and shared it with 404 Media. One coder added at least two database entries that are visible on the live site and say “<a href=\"https://doge.gov/workforce?orgId=1&amp;ref=404media.co\">this is a joke of a .gov site</a>” and “<a href=\"https://doge.gov/workforce?orgId=7cd300eb-cf3f-47f5-90f1-9e66a8bc8d07&amp;ref=404media.co\">THESE ‘EXPERTS’ LEFT THEIR DATABASE OPEN -roro</a>.”&nbsp;</em></p></blockquote><p>While I imagine those will be taken down shortly, for now, the insertions are absolutely visible:</p><p>Look, there’s a reason <a href=\"https://www.techdirt.com/2025/02/03/musks-takeover-of-the-governments-computer-systems-needs-to-be-understood-as-a-cyberattack-or-worse/\">we called this whole thing a cyberattack</a>. When someone takes over your computer systems and leaves them wide open to anyone who wants to mess with them, we usually don’t call that “disruption” or “innovation.” We call it a cybersecurity breach.</p><blockquote><p><em>“Feels like it was completely slapped together,” they added. “Tons of errors and details leaked in the page source code.”</em></p><p><em>Both sources said that the way the site is set up suggests that it is not running on government servers.</em></p><p><a href=\"http://doge.gov\"></a><em>has its codebase, probably through GitHub or something,” the other developer who noticed the insecurity said. “They’re deploying the website on Cloudflare Pages from their codebase, and</em><a href=\"http://doge.gov\"></a><em>is a custom domain that their</em><a href=\"http://pages.dev\"></a><em>URL is set to. So rather than having a physical server or even something like Amazon Web Services, they’re deploying using Cloudflare Pages which supports custom domains.”</em></p></blockquote><p>Here’s the thing about government computer systems: They’re under constant attack from foreign adversaries. Yes, they can be inefficient. Yes, they can be bloated. But you know what else they usually are? Not completely exposed to the entire internet. It turns out that some of that inefficient “bureaucracy” involves basic things like “security” and “not letting random people write whatever they want in federal databases.”</p><p>This isn’t some startup where “move fast and break things” is a viable strategy. This is the United States government. And it’s been handed over to people whose main qualification appears to be “posts spicy memes on 4chan.” The implications go far beyond embarrassing database injections — this level of technical negligence in federal systems creates genuine national security concerns. When your “disruption” involves ignoring decades of hard-learned lessons about government systems security, you’re not innovating — you’re inviting disaster.</p>","contentLength":7997,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Video Friday: PARTNR","url":"https://spectrum.ieee.org/video-friday-partnr","date":1739552404,"author":"Evan Ackerman","guid":129,"unread":true,"content":"<p>Your weekly selection of awesome robot videos</p>","contentLength":45,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81NjQ5NjM2MS9vcmlnaW4ucG5nIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc0MDk5OTA2Nn0.hMaiDCMfAle2DiX2_S3CZKODrsXEYRxu4BQGU0eByc4/image.png?width=600","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"A job ad for Y Combinator startup Firecrawl seeks to hire an AI agent for $15K a year","url":"https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/14/a-job-ad-for-y-combinator-startup-firecrawl-seeks-to-hire-an-ai-agent-for-15k-a-year/","date":1739552400,"author":"Julie Bort","guid":68,"unread":true,"content":"<p>Last week, an ad from the Y Combinator job board for a tiny startup called Firecrawl went viral on X.&nbsp; That’s because the ad wasn’t for a human. “Please apply only if you are an AI agent, or if you created an AI agent that can fill this job,” the job posting read.&nbsp; The seven-person […]</p><p>© 2024 TechCrunch.

If it’s DUI enforcement, you can talk to drivers and see if they seem intoxicated. If it’s near a border, you can stop every vehicle to search for undocumented immigrants or contraband.</p><p>What you can’t do, however, is just set up a checkpoint to stop all cars just to eyeball the interiors and question occupants in hopes of discovering contraband or evidence of illegal activity. That’s pretty much the same thing as entering every house on the block to search for criminal evidence. Just because cars aren’t houses and are traveling on public roads doesn’t give the government the right to engage in some “general rummaging.” </p><blockquote><p><em>In a 6-3 opinion delivered by Justice Sandra Day O’Connor, the Court held that because the checkpoint program’s primary purpose was indistinguishable from the general interest in crime control, the checkpoints violated the Fourth Amendment. “We cannot sanction stops justified only by the generalized and ever-present possibility that interrogation and inspection may reveal that any given motorist has committed some crime,” wrote Justice O’Connor.</em></p></blockquote><p>The city argued it had a justifiable reason for these checkpoints — during which occupants were questioned and drug dogs performed open-air sniffs: drug interdiction. Not good enough, said the Supreme Court. </p><p>And yet, law enforcement agencies seem convinced they can still do this sort of thing. They can’t. Not legally. But they  get away with it, especially if they hand the job to the officer with the least amount of experience. </p><p>Once again, ignorance of the law is the best excuse… at least if you’re a cop. That’s the upshot of this Mississippi Supreme Court <a href=\"https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/25516494/if-youre-stupid-you-can-get-away-with-it.pdf\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/25516494/if-youre-stupid-you-can-get-away-with-it.pdf\">decision</a> [PDF], brought to our attention by <a href=\"https://fourthamendment.com/?p=60034\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"https://fourthamendment.com/?p=60034\">FourthAmendment.com</a>. </p><p>In this case, two Puckett, MS police officers set up a “safety checkpoint” at a four-way intersection connecting two local highways. Lavern Kendrick was stopped and questioned by Officer Adam McGuffee. McGuffee claimed Kendrick was nervous, that he smelled “burnt plastic” which he took to be indicative of meth use, and happened to see a meth pipe inside Kendrick’s car. One thing led to another, which led to Kendrick’s arrest, and this suppression motion. </p><p>The trial court saw no problem with any of this, even though Officer McGuffee testified that this checkpoint was mostly exploratory, allowing the officer to check licenses, registration, insurance, and “then whatever is seen in the vehicles.” That alone should have put it out of constitutional bounds, especially 23 years after the Supreme Court’s ruling in .</p><p>But the lower court decided the cop was just too ignorant to understand what he was doing or saying, and credited the officer’s inexperience, rather than decide it was a clear and obvious violation of the Fourth Amendment.</p><blockquote><p><em>Following the hearing, the trial court acknowledged that Officer McGuffee’s testimony “was a little bit all over the board about the purpose for the stop.” The trial court stated that it was not surprised by this because Officer McGuffee</em></p><p><em>“…was the most inexperienced law enforcement officer for the Town of Puckett. That’s not his fault. That’s just the nature of what it is. He started in January of 2023. He’s a part-time worker. He does other work primarily. This is a part-time job for him.</em>“</p></blockquote><p>In other words, the less a cop knows, the more they can get away with. Kendrick argued more logically that McGuffee’s testimony during the trial made it clear the real purpose of the checkpoint was “general crime control,” rather than just ensuring drivers were properly licensed and insured. </p><p>Unfortunately, the state’s top court agrees with the lower court: inexperience is a halo. </p><blockquote><p><em>We find that the record supports the trial court’s conclusion. With permission from the chief of police, Officer McGuffee and Officer Lathum set up a safety checkpoint, the primary purpose of which was to check that each driver passing through it was properly licensed and insured. Evidence was presented that this was a routine safety checkpoint and that every vehicle passing through was briefly stopped.</em></p><p><em>The primary purpose of checking driver’s licenses and insurance cards substantially outweighed the minimal intrusion of Kendrick’s individual liberty. And the safety checkpoint did not violate the search-and-seizure provision of either the Fourth Amendment or the state constitution.</em></p></blockquote><p>And there it is: if a cop doesn’t have the experience to do this job properly, he can just blunder around and allow the court to undo the constitutional damage he has done… at least in Mississippi. My guess is these “safety checkpoints” are really the kind outlawed by the Supreme Court’s  decision but McGuffee just hadn’t been on the job long enough to know to how to better hide this fact from trial courts while testifying. He did his job just poorly enough to salvage an illicit possession/DUI bust. And the state’s law enforcement get their free pass on shady checkpoints extended.</p>","contentLength":5068,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"OBS Studio Raises Issues With Fedora's Flatpak Package","url":"https://www.phoronix.com/news/OBS-Studio-Poor-Fedora-Flatpak","date":1739497192,"author":"Michael Larabel","guid":698,"unread":true,"content":"<article>The OBS Studio open-source screencasting and streaming app has called out Fedora's poor Flatpak packaging of the application and is threatening as going as far as legal action if it isn't addressed...</article>","contentLength":200,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Democrats And The Price Of Protection","url":"https://www.techdirt.com/2025/02/13/democrats-and-the-price-of-protection/","date":1739490651,"author":"Mike Masnick","guid":664,"unread":true,"content":"<p>While democracy burns, corporate America is busy checking the wind direction.

Business leaders draft contingency plans for the end of constitutional government. And the Democratic Party, funded by these same genuflecting corporations, responds with all the urgency of someone scheduling a dental cleaning.</p><p>This isn’t just a failure of nerve—it’s a revelation of structural rot. We are witnessing a disturbing confluence: the same corporations prostrating themselves before Trump’s authoritarianism are simultaneously bankrolling the Democratic Party meant to resist it. It’s as if we’ve discovered that the fire department is taking donations from the arsonists while counseling residents not to use the emergency exits.</p><p>While democracy burns, the Democratic leadership is&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.axios.com/2025/02/12/democrats-jeffries-move-on-indivisible-trump\">worried</a>&nbsp;about too many phone calls from concerned citizens. In a closed-door meeting this week, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries expressed frustration not with corporate America’s growing acquiescence to authoritarianism, but with grassroots organizations urging a more confrontational defense of democracy.</p><p>“What leverage do we have?” Jeffries laments, apparently forgetting that the power to resist tyranny doesn’t come from parliamentary procedure but from the moral clarity and collective will of the people.</p><p>When Jeffries asks this question, he’s revealing more than he intends about the Democratic Party’s compromised position. Their primary source of funding comes from corporations that are already signaling their willingness to accommodate authoritarian rule. Each act of corporate genuflection to Trump—whether it’s Google’s cartographic flattery or business leaders’ quiet contingency planning—further weakens the party’s ability to mount effective resistance.</p><p>This creates a perverse incentive structure where the supposed defenders of democracy are financially dependent on institutions actively enabling its decline. Is it any wonder that Democratic leadership seems more irritated by grassroots pressure than by corporate America’s growing comfort with authoritarianism? They’re caught in a protection racket where the supposed guardians are funded by those hedging their bets on democracy’s collapse.</p><p>The result is a kind of political paralysis dressed up as procedural wisdom. While activists and citizens recognize the urgent need for confrontational defense of democratic institutions, party leadership counsels restraint and bipartisan common ground. They’re treating an existential threat to democracy like a normal policy disagreement—as if the proper response to an emerging autocracy is to schedule more committee hearings.</p><p>Now I am a capitalist, but there must be a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.notesfromthecircus.com/p/we-messed-up-really-badly\">healthy separation</a>&nbsp;between the forces of wealth and power. The Founders understood this. We re-learned this lesson in the Gilded Age and we must re-learn it now.</p><p>The danger isn’t markets themselves—it’s the fusion of corporate and political power into a single, self-reinforcing system. When corporations can simultaneously fund both political parties while hedging their bets on authoritarianism, we’ve lost the crucial separation that makes both democracy and healthy capitalism possible. We’re watching the creation of a system where political power becomes just another tradable commodity, where democracy itself becomes subject to market forces rather than civic virtue.</p><p>This is exactly what the Founders feared when they warned about the corrupting influence of concentrated power. It’s what Progressive Era reformers fought against when they broke up the trusts and established regulatory frameworks to check corporate overreach. They understood that democracy requires maintaining boundaries between economic and political power—that when these boundaries collapse, both systems become corrupted.</p><p>What we’re seeing now—with corporations funding Democrats while accommodating Trump’s authoritarianism—is the end stage of this collapse. It’s a form of political arbitrage where democracy itself becomes just another risk to be hedged against.</p><p>Unfortunately, this institutional paralysis isn’t happening in normal times—it’s occurring while a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.notesfromthecircus.com/p/a-coup-is-in-progress-in-america\">literal coup</a>&nbsp;is in motion. Elon Musk, his mind deranged by the hall of funhouse mirrors he calls X (formerly Twitter), leads a charge against democratic institutions with his&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.notesfromthecircus.com/p/the-plot-against-america\">merry band</a>&nbsp;of neoreactionaries flanking him as they storm the administrative state.</p><p>This isn’t just metaphorical—we’re watching in real-time as they attempt to dismantle the basic infrastructure of governance. While Democratic leadership wrings its hands about “leverage” and corporate America calculates its positions, Musk and his allies are actively working to replace democratic processes with private control. The distorted reality he sees reflected in his social media echo chamber has become a blueprint for dismantling democratic institutions.</p><p>The neoreactionaries who once theorized about replacing democracy with corporate governance are now finding their way into positions of actual power. They’re not just writing blog posts anymore—they’re drafting executive orders, restructuring agencies, and building the infrastructure for authoritarian control. And they’re doing it while the supposed defenders of democracy debate parliamentary procedure and worry about donor relations.</p><p>And so we find ourselves in the absurd position where Democratic leadership, in the form of Jeffries and Schumer, treats an ongoing coup like an inconvenient scheduling conflict. Their response to democracy’s crisis amounts to little more than checking&nbsp;&nbsp;to see if authoritarianism requires a two-thirds majority.</p><p>While Rome burns, they’re busy drafting strongly worded letters to the arsonists, pausing only to scold the citizens who dare suggest using the fire extinguishers. Their position would be merely comedic if it weren’t so catastrophically dangerous—like watching someone respond to a home invasion by suggesting the burglar fill out a visitor’s form.</p><p>“What leverage do we have?” Jeffries asks—apparently unaware that he’s providing his own epitaph. The leverage of moral clarity. The leverage of democratic legitimacy. The leverage of millions of citizens demanding their representatives actually represent them. But perhaps that’s too much to expect from leaders who’ve grown so comfortable in their donor-funded cages that they mistake their chains for jewelry.</p><p><em>“We know now that Government by organized money is just as dangerous as Government by organized mob.” — Franklin D.

Section 230 embodies that principle that we should all be responsible for our own actions and statements online, but generally not those of others. The law prevents most civil suits against users or services that are based on what others say.</p><p>The correspondence among DOJ officials shows that the group <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25522146-12-9-24-interim-response/#document/p121\">delayed</a> unveiling the agency’s official plans to amend Section 230 in light of Trump’s executive order, which was <a href=\"https://www.eff.org/cases/rock-vote-v-trump\">challenged on First Amendment grounds</a> and later <a href=\"https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2021/05/president-biden-revokes-unconstitutional-executive-order-retaliating-against\">rescinded</a> by President Joe Biden. EFF represented the groups who challenged Trump’s Executive Order and filed <a href=\"https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2022/11/documents-show-dojs-multi-pronged-effort-undermine-section-230\">two FOIA suits</a> for records about the administration’s implementation of the order.</p><p>In the most recent FOIA case, the DOJ has been slowly releasing records detailing its work to propose amendments to Section 230, which predated Trump’s Executive Order. The DOJ <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/archives/opa/pr/justice-department-unveils-proposed-section-230-legislation\">released</a> the text of its proposed amendments to Section 230 in September 2020, and the <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/ag/media/1101556/dl?inline=\">proposal</a> would have substantially narrowed the law’s protections.</p><p>For example, the DOJ’s proposal would have allowed federal civil suits and state and federal criminal prosecutions against online services if they learned that users’ content broke the law. It also would have established notice-and-takedown liability for user-generated content that was deemed to be illegal. Together, these provisions would likely result in online services screening and removing a host of legal content, based on a fear that any questionable material might trigger liability later.</p><p>The DOJ’s proposal had a distinct emphasis on imposing liability on services should they have hosted illegal content posted by their users. That focus was likely the result of the team DOJ assembled to work on the proposal, which included officials from the agency’s cybercrime division and the FBI.</p><p>The documents also show that DOJ officials met with <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25522147-10-8-24-interim-response/#document/p3\">attorneys</a> who brought lawsuits against online services to get their perspective on Section 230. This is not surprising, as the DOJ had been meeting with multiple groups throughout 2020 while it prepared a <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/ag/media/1072971/dl?inline\">report</a> about Section 230.</p><p>EFF’s FOIA suit is ongoing, as the DOJ has said that it still has thousands of potential pages to review and possibly release. Although these documents reflect DOJ’s activity from Trump’s first term, they are increasingly relevant as the administration appoints officials who have previously <a href=\"https://docs.fcc.gov/public/attachments/DOC-407732A1.pdf\">threatened</a> online intermediaries for exercising their own First Amendment rights. EFF will continue to publish <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/projects/220706-eff-foia-trump-doj-230-2016-2020/\">all documents</a> released in this FOIA suit and push back on attempts to undermine internet users’ rights to speak online.</p>","contentLength":3436,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"https://www.eff.org/files/banner_library/section_230_banner.jpeg","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Lawyers Caught Citing AI-Hallucinated Cases Call It a 'Cautionary Tale'","url":"https://www.404media.co/lawyers-caught-citing-ai-hallucinated-cases-call-it-a-cautionary-tale/","date":1739467980,"author":"Samantha Cole","guid":742,"unread":true,"content":"<img src=\"https://www.404media.co/content/images/2025/02/photo-1620424393934-04e772be09f4.jpeg\" alt=\"Lawyers Caught Citing AI-Hallucinated Cases Call It a 'Cautionary Tale'\"><p>After a judge called out a law firm for citing fake cases in court documents, the attorneys admitted to AI “hallucinating” the cases.&nbsp;</p><p>In <a href=\"https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.wyd.64014/gov.uscourts.wyd.64014.156.0_1.pdf?ref=404media.co\"><u>a court order filed last week</u></a>, Wyoming District Judge Kelly Rankin demanded the attorneys explain why they shouldn’t be sanctioned or disciplined for citing made-up information, including referencing eight non-existent cases.&nbsp;</p><p><a href=\"https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.wyd.64014/gov.uscourts.wyd.64014.1.0.pdf?ref=404media.co\"></a>, first filed in 2023, is against Walmart and Jetson Electronic Bikes, Inc., which makes hoverboards for sale at Walmart. The plaintiffs, including a woman, her husband, and four minor children, claim a Jetson hoverboard’s lithium ion battery malfunctioned and caught fire while they were sleeping and burned their house down, severely injuring several members of the family.</p><p>In a motion in limine filed by the plaintiff’s attorneys in January, they cited multiple cases (a \"motion in limine\" is a pretrial motion where attorneys request specific evidence or arguments be excluded from presentation during the trial) that don’t exist. “The cases are not identifiable by their Westlaw cite, and the Court cannot locate the District of Wyoming cases by their case name in its local Electronic Court Filing System,” Rankin wrote. She demanded each of the attorneys “provide a thorough explanation for how the motion and fake cases were generated,” and “explain their role in drafting or supervising the motion.”&nbsp;</p><p>Four days later, they responded: “Our internal artificial intelligence platform ‘hallucinated’ the cases in question while assisting our attorney in drafting the motion in limine,” <a href=\"https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.wyd.64014/gov.uscourts.wyd.64014.161.0.pdf?ref=404media.co\"><u>the law firm said in a filed response</u></a>. “This matter comes with great embarrassment and has prompted discussion and action regarding the training, implementation, and future use of artificial intelligence within our firm.
