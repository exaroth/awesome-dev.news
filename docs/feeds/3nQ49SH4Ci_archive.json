Critical functions have been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/05/musk-doge-takeover-usaid\">halted</a>, tens of thousands of federal staffers are being encouraged to <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/lifestyle/careers/federal-workers-accept-buyout-offers-be1c00fb\">resign</a>, and congressional mandates are being <a href=\"https://thehill.com/business/5124133-democrats-bill-treasury-system-musk/\">disregarded</a>. The next phase: The Department of Government Efficiency <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/03/technology/musk-allies-ai-government.html\">reportedly</a> wants to use AI to cut costs. According to , Musk’s group has started to <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2025/02/06/elon-musk-doge-ai-department-education/\">run sensitive data</a> from government systems through AI programs to analyze spending and determine what could be pruned. This may lead to the elimination of human jobs in favor of automation. As one government official who has been tracking Musk’s DOGE team told the, the ultimate aim is to use AI to replace “<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2025/02/08/doge-musk-goals/\">the human workforce with machines</a>.” (Spokespeople for the White House and DOGE did not respond to requests for comment.)</p><p>Using AI to make government more efficient is a worthy pursuit, and this is not a new idea. The Biden administration disclosed more than 2,000 <a href=\"https://github.com/ombegov/2024-Federal-AI-Use-Case-Inventory\">AI applications</a> in development across the federal government. For example, <a href=\"https://www.dhs.gov/ai/use-case-inventory/fema\">FEMA</a> has started using AI to help perform damage assessment in disaster areas. The <a href=\"https://ai.cms.gov/assets/CMS_AI_Playbook.pdf\">Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services</a> has started using AI to look for fraudulent billing. The idea of replacing dedicated and principled civil servants with AI agents, however, new—and complicated.</p><p>The civil service—the massive cadre of employees who operate government agencies—plays a vital role in translating laws and policy into the operation of society. New presidents can issue sweeping executive orders, but they often have no real effect until they actually change the behavior of public servants. Whether you think of these people as essential and <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/interactive/2024/michael-lewis-conclusion-who-is-government/\">inspiring</a> do-gooders, boring bureaucratic functionaries, or as agents of a “<a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2024/11/deep-state-public-health-trump-kennedy/680621/\">deep state</a>,” their sheer number and continuity act as ballast that resists institutional change.</p><p>This is why Trump and Musk’s actions are so significant. The more AI decision making is integrated into government, the easier change will be. If human workers are widely replaced with AI, executives will have unilateral authority to instantaneously alter the behavior of the government, profoundly raising the stakes for transitions of power in democracy. Trump’s unprecedented purge of the civil service might be the last time a president needs to replace the human beings in government in order to dictate its new functions. Future leaders may do so at the press of a button.</p><p>To be clear, the use of AI by the executive branch doesn’t have to be disastrous. In theory, it could allow new leadership to swiftly implement the wishes of its electorate. But this could go very badly in the hands of an authoritarian leader. AI systems concentrate power at the top, so they could allow an executive to effectuate change over sprawling bureaucracies instantaneously. Firing and replacing tens of thousands of human bureaucrats is a huge undertaking. Swapping one AI out for another, or modifying the rules that those AIs operate by, would be much simpler.</p><p>Social-welfare programs, if automated with AI, could be redirected to systematically benefit one group and disadvantage another with a single prompt change. Immigration-enforcement agencies could prioritize people for investigation and detainment with one instruction. Regulatory-enforcement agencies that monitor corporate behavior for malfeasance could turn their attention to, or away from, any given company on a whim.</p><p>Even if Congress were motivated to fight back against Trump and Musk, or against a future president seeking to bulldoze the will of the legislature, the absolute power to command AI agents would make it easier to subvert legislative intent. AI <a href=\"https://www.techpolicy.press/anatomy-of-an-ai-coup/\">has the power to diminish</a> representative politics. Written law is never fully determinative of the actions of government—there is always wiggle room for presidents, appointed leaders, and civil servants to exercise their own judgment. Whether intentional or not, whether charitably or not, each of these actors uses discretion. In human systems, that discretion is widely distributed across many individuals—people who, in the case of career civil servants, usually outlast presidencies.</p><p>Today, the AI ecosystem is dominated by a small number of corporations that decide how the most widely used AI models are designed, which data they are trained on, and which instructions they follow. Because their work is <a href=\"https://crfm.stanford.edu/fmti/paper.pdf\">largely secretive and unaccountable</a> to public interest, these tech companies are capable of making changes to the bias of AI systems—either generally or with aim at specific governmental use cases—that are invisible to the rest of us. And these private actors are both vulnerable to coercion by political leaders and self-interested in appealing to their favor. Musk himself created and funded xAI, now one of the world’s largest AI labs, with an <a href=\"https://www.zdnet.com/article/i-tried-xs-anti-woke-grok-ai-chatbot-the-results-were-the-opposite-of-what-i-expected/\">explicitly ideological</a> mandate to generate anti-“woke” AI and <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/llm-political-bias/\">steer</a> the wider AI industry in a similar direction.</p><p>But there’s a second way that AI’s transformation of government could go. AI development could happen inside of transparent and accountable public institutions, alongside its continued development by Big Tech. Applications of AI in democratic governments could be focused on benefitting public servants and the communities they serve by, for example, making it easier for non-English speakers to access government services, making ministerial tasks such as processing routine applications more efficient and reducing backlogs, or helping constituents weigh in on the policies deliberated by their representatives. Such AI integrations should be done gradually and carefully, with public oversight for their design and implementation and monitoring and guardrails to avoid unacceptable bias and harm.</p><p>Governments around the world are demonstrating how this could be done, though it’s early days. <a href=\"https://talktothecity.org\">Taiwan</a> has pioneered the use of AI models to facilitate deliberative democracy at an unprecedented scale. Singapore has been a leader in the development of <a href=\"https://www.brookings.edu/articles/how-public-ai-can-strengthen-democracy/\">public AI</a> models, built <a href=\"https://sea-lion.ai\">transparently</a> and with <a href=\"https://www.undp.org/policy-centre/singapore/blog/pairing-ai-public-sector-impact-singapore\">public-service use cases</a> in mind. <a href=\"https://www.canada.ca/en/government/system/digital-government/digital-government-innovations/responsible-use-ai/algorithmic-impact-assessment.html\">Canada</a> has illustrated the role of disclosure and public input on the consideration of AI use cases in government. Even if you do not trust the current White House to follow any of these examples, U.S. states—which have much greater contact and influence over the daily lives of Americans than the federal government—could lead the way on this kind of responsible development and deployment of AI.</p><p>As the political theorist <a href=\"https://wwnorton.com/books/9781631496943\">David Runciman</a> has written, AI is just another in a long line of artificial “machines” used to govern how people live and act, not unlike corporations and states before it. AI doesn’t replace those older institutions, but it changes how they function. As the Trump administration forges stronger ties to Big Tech and AI developers, we need to recognize the potential of that partnership to steer the future of democratic governance—and act to make sure that it does not enable future authoritarians.</p><p><em>This essay was written with Nathan E.

Foreign adversaries typically spend years attempting to penetrate government systems such as these, using stealth to avoid being seen and carefully hiding any tells or tracks. The Chinese government’s 2015 breach of <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/chinese-hackers-breach-federal-governments-personnel-office/2015/06/04/889c0e52-0af7-11e5-95fd-d580f1c5d44e_story.html\">OPM</a> was a significant US security failure, and it illustrated how personnel data could be used to identify intelligence officers and compromise national security.</p><p>In this case, external operators with <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/elon-musk-government-young-engineers/\">limited experience</a> and minimal oversight are doing their work in plain sight and under massive public scrutiny: gaining the highest levels of <a href=\"https://talkingpointsmemo.com/edblog/musk-cronies-dive-into-treasury-dept-payments-code-base\">administrative access</a> and making changes to the United States’ most sensitive networks, potentially introducing new security vulnerabilities in the process.</p><p>But the most alarming aspect isn’t just the access being granted. It’s the systematic dismantling of security measures that would detect and prevent misuse—including standard incident response protocols, auditing, and change-tracking mechanisms—<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/02/usaid-officials-put-on-leave-musk-doge\">by</a> removing the career officials in charge of those security measures and replacing them with inexperienced operators.</p><p>The Treasury’s computer systems have such an impact on national security that they were designed with the same principle that guides nuclear launch protocols: No single person should have unlimited power. Just as launching a nuclear missile requires two separate officers turning their keys simultaneously, making changes to critical financial systems traditionally requires multiple authorized personnel working in concert.</p><p>This approach, known as “separation of duties,” isn’t just bureaucratic red tape; it’s a fundamental security principle as old as banking itself. When your local bank processes a large transfer, it requires two different employees to verify the transaction. When a company issues a major financial report, separate teams must review and approve it. These aren’t just formalities—they’re essential safeguards against corruption and error. These measures have been <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/elon-musk-government-young-engineers/\">bypassed or ignored</a>. It’s as if someone found a way to rob Fort Knox by simply declaring that the new official policy is to fire all the guards and allow unescorted visits to the vault.</p><p>The implications for national security are <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/05/the-biggest-breach-of-u-s-government-data-is-under-way/\">staggering</a>. Sen. Ron Wyden said his office had learned that the attackers gained <a href=\"https://securityaffairs.com/173776/security/elon-musk-s-doge-granted-full-access-to-sensitive-treasury-systems.html\">privileges</a> that allow them to modify core programs in Treasury Department computers that verify federal payments, access encrypted keys that secure financial transactions, and alter audit logs that record system changes. Over at OPM, reports indicate that individuals associated with DOGE <a href=\"https://www.rawstory.com/elon-musk-doge-lawsuit/\">connected</a> an unauthorized server into the network. They are also reportedly <a href=\"https://gizmodo.com/elon-musks-doge-running-highly-sensitive-government-data-through-ai-report-2000560381\">training</a><a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2025/02/06/elon-musk-doge-ai-department-education/\">AI</a> software on all of this sensitive data.</p><p>This is much more critical than the initial unauthorized access. These new servers have unknown capabilities and configurations, and there’s no evidence that this new code has gone through any rigorous security testing protocols. The AIs being trained are certainly not secure enough for this kind of data. All are ideal targets for any adversary, foreign or domestic, also seeking access to federal data.</p><p>There’s a reason why every modification—hardware or software—to these systems goes through a complex planning process and includes sophisticated access-control mechanisms. The national security crisis is that these systems are now much more vulnerable to dangerous attacks at the same time that the legitimate system administrators trained to protect them have been <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/us/musk-aides-lock-government-workers-out-computer-systems-us-agency-sources-say-2025-01-31/\">locked out</a>.</p><p>By modifying core systems, the attackers have not only compromised current operations, but have also left behind vulnerabilities that could be exploited in future attacks—giving adversaries such as Russia and China an <a href=\"https://therecord.media/doge-opm-treasury-cybersecurity\">unprecedented</a><a href=\"https://cyberscoop.com/musk-doge-opm-treasury-breach/\">opportunity</a>. These countries have long targeted these systems. And they don’t just want to gather intelligence—they also want to understand how to disrupt these systems in a crisis.</p><p>Now, the technical details of how these systems operate, their security protocols, and their vulnerabilities are now potentially exposed to unknown parties without any of the usual safeguards. Instead of having to breach heavily fortified digital walls, these parties &nbsp;can simply walk through doors that are being propped open—and then erase evidence of their actions.</p><p>The security implications span three critical areas.</p><p>First, system manipulation: External operators can now modify operations while also altering audit trails that would track their changes. Second, data exposure: Beyond accessing personal information and transaction records, these operators can copy entire system architectures and security configurations—in one case, the technical blueprint of the country’s federal payment infrastructure. Third, and most critically, is the issue of system control: These operators can alter core systems and authentication mechanisms while disabling the very tools designed to detect such changes. This is more than modifying operations; it is modifying the infrastructure that those operations use.</p><p>To address these vulnerabilities, three immediate steps are essential. First, unauthorized access must be revoked and proper authentication protocols restored. Next, comprehensive system monitoring and change management must be reinstated—which, given the difficulty of cleaning a compromised system, will likely require a complete system reset. Finally, thorough audits must be conducted of all system changes made during this period.</p><p>This is beyond politics—this is a matter of national security. Foreign national intelligence organizations will be quick to take advantage of both the chaos and the new insecurities to steal US data and install backdoors to allow for future access.</p><p>Each day of continued unrestricted access makes the eventual recovery more difficult and increases the risk of irreversible damage to these critical systems. While the full impact may take time to assess, these steps represent the minimum necessary actions to begin restoring system integrity and security protocols.</p><p>Assuming that anyone in the government still cares.</p><p><em>This essay was written with Davi Ottenheimer, and originally appeared in <a href=\"https://foreignpolicy.com/2025/02/11/doge-cyberattack-united-states-treasury/\">Foreign Policy</a>.</em></p>","contentLength":8433,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"ISC Stormcast For Thursday, February 13th, 2025 https://isc.sans.edu/podcastdetail/9322, (Thu, Feb 13th)","url":"https://isc.sans.edu/diary/rss/31682","date":1739410010,"author":"","guid":415,"unread":true,"content":"<article>\n \n (c) SANS Internet Storm Center. https://isc.sans.edu Creative Commons Attribution-Noncommercial 3.0 United States License.</article>","contentLength":126,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"DShield SIEM Docker Updates, (Thu, Feb 13th)","url":"https://isc.sans.edu/diary/rss/31680","date":1739409839,"author":"","guid":414,"unread":true,"content":"<p>Over the past several weeks, I have been testing various enhancements to the <a href=\"https://github.com/bruneaug/DShield-SIEM/tree/main\">DShield SIEM</a>, to process <a href=\"https://github.com/bruneaug/DShield-Sensor\">DShield sensor</a> log from local and cloud sensors with Filebeat and Filebeat modules to easily send <a href=\"https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/integrations/current/zeek.html\">Zeek</a> and <a href=\"https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/integrations/current/netflow.html\">NetFlow</a> logs back to a local network ELK stack via home router natting.

Hopefully, no one has to handle all these roles alone since there is also the continuous learning aspect of getting up to speed with the latest threat vectors, vulnerabilities and exploit techniques. Adversaries only need one attack to succeed to gain actions on objective. In contrast, defenders have to detect and stop every attack to prevent adversaries from being successful. Let’s now extrapolate to an even bigger problem – what if this happens on emerging/future technologies and adversaries can get away with such crimes?</p><p>Multiple countries are gradually considering the concept of Smart Cities, a key consideration in the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP). As such technologies are implemented, the responsibility of defending this critical infrastructure again falls on the shoulders of blue teams. Smart Cities have yet to be fully implemented, but it does not mean we should not be proactive in preparing defenders to handle future problems. Current issues, even without Smart Cities in the fray, already cause blue team grief (e.g. different technology platforms, different contexts, information sharing, collaboration and tool interoperability). Given these complexities, an ontology would allow a shared understanding of vocabulary, facilitate data sharing, and even enable automated data reasoning.</p><p>Wanting to pre-emptively solve future issues of attacks and cybercrime on Smart City Infrastructure (SCI), I (along with my co-authors in the <a href=\"https://asset-group.github.io\">SUTD ASSET Group</a>) set out to create the Smart City Ontological Paradigm Expression (SCOPE). SCOPE was designed to be an ontology for threats, cybercrime and digital forensic investigation on SCI. We did not create the ontology from scratch but chose to adhere to ontology best practices and extended the venerable Unified Cyber Ontology (UCO) [1] and Cyber-investigation Analysis Standard Expression (CASE) [2]. UCO and CASE have gained some traction, and these ontologies have been experimentally adopted in forensic tools such as Cellebrite, Magnet Forensics, and MSAB XRY [3]. However, UCO and CASE did not have any SCI representation, and expecting overwhelmed blue teams to create them from scratch would most certainly be the straw that broke the camel’s back.</p><p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://isc.sans.edu/diaryimages/images/Feb_2025_1_1.png\"> Smart City Infrastructure Definition (reproduced with permission from the authors) [4]</p><p>We deliberated on several design factors. Firstly, we defined smart cities using a technology-agnostic approach while adhering to international standards (with reference to Figure 1) that adopted the United Nations (UN) Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) (this was done in a previous work) [4]. By doing so, we ensured that the evolution of technologies or vendors would not affect the fundamental principle of Smart Cities. Secondly, we identified possible threats, cybercrime, and digital forensic evidence sources from the Smart City, which were defined in the first step (also from the same previous work) [4]. Thirdly, we included MITRE ATT&amp;CK techniques and MITRE CAPEC into SCOPE for analysts and investigators to provide additional context to forensic evidence. Finally, we followed the ontological style and design practices when creating SCOPE, an expansion profile from UCO and CASE.</p><p>We evaluated SCOPE via real-world attack scenarios attributed to publicly reported real-world incidents attributed to Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) groups. With reference to Figure 2, the evaluation process workflow is shown. We successfully represented the attack scenarios, cybercrime committed, incident details, evidence and attack patterns (to name a few).</p><p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://isc.sans.edu/diaryimages/images/Feb_2025_1_2.png\"> SCOPE Evaluation Process (reproduced with permission from the authors) [3]</p><p>Will SCOPE ever be helpful? Not yet. I hope it will come in handy in future for digital forensic investigators and law enforcement agencies when cybercrime on SCI becomes prevalent. As mentioned, SCOPE is technology-agnostic while adhering to several ISO standards. Additionally, it contains enough granularity to allow users to pinpoint key information while ensuring it can capture abstract definitions covering emerging technologies. We have made SCOPE publicly available to the digital forensic community to assist future smart city infrastructure investigations.

This vulnerability allows for remote code execution, posing a significant threat if exploited. An unauthenticated attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a specially crafted request to a vulnerable LDAP server, potentially causing a buffer overflow. The attack complexity is high, as successful exploitation requires the attacker to win a race condition. Mitigation efforts should focus on securing LDAP servers and monitoring for unusual activity to prevent potential exploitation.\nThis vulnerability, identified as CVE-2025-21381, has not been exploited in the wild nor disclosed publicly, making it a non-zero-day threat. It carries a severity rating of Critical with a CVSS score of 7.8, indicating a significant risk of remote code execution. Despite the CVSS metric indicating a local attack vector, the vulnerability allows an attacker to execute code remotely by convincing a user, through social engineering, to download and open a specially crafted file. The attack can be executed locally, with the Preview Pane serving as a potential attack vector. Users are advised to exercise caution when opening files from untrusted sources and to apply any available security updates to mitigate this risk.<strong>DHCP Client Service Remote Code Execution Vulnerability (<a href=\"https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/en-US/security-guidance/advisory/CVE-2025-21379\">CVE-2025-21379</a>)</strong>\nThis vulnerability, identified as CVE-2025-21379, has not been exploited in the wild nor disclosed publicly, classifying it as a non-zero-day threat. It carries a severity rating of Critical with a CVSS score of 7.1, indicating a significant risk of remote code execution. The vulnerability requires a high attack complexity, necessitating a machine-in-the-middle (MITM) attack where the attacker must intercept the logical network path between the target and the resource. The attack vector is adjacent, meaning it is limited to systems on the same network segment, such as those connected to the same network switch or virtual network. This limitation prevents the attack from being executed across multiple networks, such as a WAN.<strong>Microsoft High Performance Compute (HPC) Pack Remote Code Execution Vulnerability (<a href=\"https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/en-US/security-guidance/advisory/CVE-2025-21198\">CVE-2025-21198</a>)</strong>\nis a critical security flaw with a CVSS score of 9.0, rated as Important, and is currently neither exploited in the wild nor publicly disclosed. This vulnerability allows for remote code execution, requiring an attacker to have low privileges and access to the network connecting the targeted HPC clusters and nodes. The attack vector is adjacent, meaning it relies on intra-net or private network access rather than exposure to the public internet. Exploitation involves sending a specially crafted HTTPS request to the head node or Linux compute node, potentially allowing the attacker to execute code on other clusters or nodes connected to the targeted head node. The scope of the attack is changed, indicating that successful exploitation could lead to broader impacts beyond the initially compromised system.<strong>Windows Telephony Service Remote Code Execution Vulnerability (<a href=\"https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/en-US/security-guidance/advisory/CVE-2025-21190\">CVE-2025-21190</a>)</strong>\nThis is a significant security issue with a CVSS score of 8.8, classified as Important. Although it has not been exploited in the wild or disclosed publicly, this vulnerability poses a risk of remote code execution. An attacker could exploit it by deceiving a user into sending a request to a malicious server, which could then return harmful data leading to arbitrary code execution on the user's system. The attack vector is network-based, requiring user interaction, as the attacker needs a client to connect to the malicious server to execute code on the client system.<strong>Windows Telephony Service Remote Code Execution Vulnerability (<a href=\"https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/en-US/security-guidance/advisory/CVE-2025-21200\">CVE-2025-21200</a>)</strong>\nThis&nbsp;is a significant security issue with a CVSS score of 8.8, rated as Important, though it has not been exploited in the wild nor disclosed publicly, thus not classified as a zero-day. This vulnerability allows for remote code execution, where an attacker could potentially trick a user into sending a request to a malicious server. The server could then return malicious data, leading to arbitrary code execution on the user's system. The attack vector is network-based, requiring user interaction, as the client must connect to a malicious server, which could enable the attacker to execute code on the client machine. Mitigation strategies should focus on user awareness and network security measures to prevent such exploitations.<p>\nThis summary of Microsoft's monthly updates highlights several critical vulnerabilities, emphasizing the need for immediate attention to certain threats. The Windows Ancillary Function Driver for WinSock vulnerability (CVE-2025-21418) is currently being exploited and poses a significant risk due to its potential for SYSTEM privilege escalation. Users should prioritize patching this vulnerability. Additionally, the Windows Storage vulnerability (CVE-2025-21391) is actively exploited, risking data integrity and availability. The NTLM Hash Disclosure vulnerability (CVE-2025-21377), a zero-day, threatens confidentiality and requires prompt updates. Other critical vulnerabilities, such as those affecting Microsoft Dynamics 365 Sales and Windows LDAP, though not exploited, demand vigilance and timely updates to prevent potential exploitation. Users are advised to prioritize these updates and enhance security measures to mitigate risks effectively.</p></p><p><strong>February 2025 Security Updates</strong></p><p>February 2025 Security
