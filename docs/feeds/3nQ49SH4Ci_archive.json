Sanders share five key insights from their new book, <em>Rewiring Democracy: How AI Will Transform Our Politics, Government, and Citizenship</em>.</p><p>AI can be used both for and against the public interest within democracies. It is already being used in the governing of nations around the world, and there is no escaping its continued use in the future by leaders, policy makers, and legal enforcers. How we wire AI into democracy today will determine if it becomes a tool of oppression or empowerment.</p><h3>1. AI’s global democratic impact is already profound.</h3><p>It’s been just a few years since ChatGPT stormed into view and AI’s influence has already permeated every democratic process in governments around the world:</p><ul><li>In 2022, an artist collective in Denmark founded the world’s first political party committed to an AI-generated policy platform.</li><li>Also in 2022, South Korean politicians running for the presidency were the first to use AI avatars to communicate with voters en masse.</li><li>In 2023, a Brazilian municipal legislator passed the first enacted law written by AI.</li><li>In 2024, a U.S. federal court judge started using AI to interpret the plain meaning of words in U.S. law.</li><li>Also in 2024, the Biden administration disclosed more than two thousand discrete use cases for AI across the agencies of the U.S. federal government.</li></ul><p>The examples illustrate the diverse uses of AI across citizenship, politics, legislation, the judiciary, and executive administration.</p><p>Not all of these uses will create lasting change. Some of these will be one-offs. Some are inherently small in scale. Some were publicity stunts. But each use case speaks to a shifting balance of supply and demand that AI will increasingly mediate.</p><p>Legislators need assistance drafting bills and have limited staff resources, especially at the local and state level. Historically, they have looked to lobbyists and interest groups for help. Increasingly, it’s just as easy for them to use an AI tool.</p><h3>2. The first places AI will be used are where there is the least public oversight.</h3><p>Many of the use cases for AI in governance and politics have vocal objectors. Some make us uncomfortable, especially in the hands of authoritarians or ideological extremists.</p><p>In some cases, politics will be a regulating force to prevent dangerous uses of AI. Massachusetts has banned the use of AI face recognition in law enforcement because of real concerns voiced by the public about their tendency to encode systems of racial bias.</p><p>Some of the uses we think might be most impactful are unlikely to be adopted fast because of legitimate concern about their potential to make mistakes, introduce bias, or subvert human agency. AIs could be assistive tools for citizens, acting as their voting proxies to help us weigh in on larger numbers of more complex ballot initiatives, but we know that many will object to anything that verges on AIs being given a vote.</p><p>But AI will continue to be rapidly adopted in some aspects of democracy, regardless of how the public feels. People within democracies, even those in government jobs, often have great independence. They don’t have to ask anyone if it’s ok to use AI, and they will use it if they see that it benefits them. The Brazilian city councilor who used AI to draft a bill did not ask for anyone’s permission. The U.S. federal judge who used AI to help him interpret law did not have to check with anyone first. And the Trump administration seems to be using AI for everything from drafting tariff policies to writing public health reports—with some obvious drawbacks.</p><p>It’s likely that even the thousands of disclosed AI uses in government are only the tip of the iceberg. These are just the applications that governments have seen fit to share; the ones they think are the best vetted, most likely to persist, or maybe the least controversial to disclose.</p><h3>3. Elites and authoritarians will use AI to concentrate power.</h3><p>Many Westerners point to China as a cautionary tale of how AI could empower autocracy, but the reality is that AI provides structural advantages to entrenched power in democratic governments, too. The nature of automation is that it gives those at the top of a power structure more control over the actions taken at its lower levels.</p><p>It’s famously hard for newly elected leaders to exert their will over the many layers of human bureaucracies. The civil service is large, unwieldy, and messy. But it’s trivial for an executive to change the parameters and instructions of an AI model being used to automate the systems of government.</p><p>The dynamic of AI effectuating concentration of power extends beyond government agencies. Over the past five years, Ohio has undertaken a project to do a wholesale revision of its administrative code using AI. The leaders of that project framed it in terms of efficiency and good governance: deleting millions of words of outdated, unnecessary, or redundant language. The same technology could be applied to advance more ideological ends, like purging all statutory language that places burdens on business, neglects to hold businesses accountable, protects some class of people, or fails to protect others.</p><p>Whether you like or despise automating the enactment of those policies will depend on whether you stand with or are opposed to those in power, and that’s the point. AI gives any faction with power the potential to exert more control over the levers of government.</p><h3>4. Organizers will find ways to use AI to distribute power instead.</h3><p>We don’t have to resign ourselves to a world where AI makes the rich richer and the elite more powerful. This is a technology that can also be wielded by outsiders to help level the playing field.</p><p>In politics, AI gives upstart and local candidates access to skills and the ability to do work on a scale that used to only be available to well-funded campaigns. In the 2024 cycle, Congressional candidates running against incumbents like Glenn Cook in Georgia and Shamaine Daniels in Pennsylvania used AI to help themselves be everywhere all at once. They used AI to make personalized robocalls to voters, write frequent blog posts, and even generate podcasts in the candidate’s voice. In Japan, a candidate for Governor of Tokyo used an AI avatar to respond to more than eight thousand online questions from voters.</p><p>Outside of public politics, labor organizers are also leveraging AI to build power. The Worker’s Lab is a U.S. nonprofit developing assistive technologies for labor unions, like AI-enabled apps that help service workers report workplace safety violations. The 2023 Writers’ Guild of America strike serves as a blueprint for organizers. They won concessions from Hollywood studios that protect their members against being displaced by AI while also winning them guarantees for being able to use AI as assistive tools to their own benefit.</p><h3>5. The ultimate democratic impact of AI depends on us.</h3><p>If you are excited about AI and see the potential for it to make life, and maybe even democracy, better around the world, recognize that there are a lot of people who don’t feel the same way.</p><p>If you are disturbed about the ways you see AI being used and worried about the future that leads to, recognize that the trajectory we’re on now is not the only one available.</p><p>The technology of AI itself does not pose an inherent threat to citizens, workers, and the public interest. Like other democratic technologies—voting processes, legislative districts, judicial review—its impacts will depend on how it’s developed, who controls it, and how it’s used.</p><p>Constituents of democracies should do four things:</p><ul><li> the technology ecosystem to be more trustworthy, so that AI is developed with more transparency, more guardrails around exploitative use of data, and public oversight.</li><li> inappropriate uses of AI in government and politics, like facial recognition technologies that automate surveillance and encode inequity.</li><li> AI in government where it can help improve outcomes, like making government more accessible to people through translation and speeding up administrative decision processes.</li><li> the systems of government vulnerable to the disruptive potential of AI’s superhuman capabilities, like political advertising rules that never anticipated deepfakes.</li></ul><p>These four Rs are how we can rewire our democracy in a way that applies AI to truly benefit the public interest.</p>","contentLength":8404,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"ISC Stormcast For Friday, October 31st, 2025 https://isc.sans.edu/podcastdetail/9680, (Fri, Oct 31st)","url":"https://isc.sans.edu/diary/rss/32438","date":1761876003,"author":"","guid":322500,"unread":true,"content":"<article>\n \n (c) SANS Internet Storm Center. https://isc.sans.edu Creative Commons Attribution-Noncommercial 3.0 United States License.</article>","contentLength":126,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"X-Request-Purpose: Identifying \"research\" and bug bounty related scans&#x3f;, (Thu, Oct 30th)","url":"https://isc.sans.edu/diary/rss/32436","date":1761830539,"author":"","guid":322155,"unread":true,"content":"<p>This week, I noticed some new HTTP request headers that I had not seen before:</p><blockquote></blockquote><blockquote><p><code>X-Hackerone-Research: plusultra\nX-Bugcrowd-Ninja: plusultra</code></p></blockquote><p>The purpose of these headers appears to be to identify them as being sent as part of a bug bounty.

The results of the test suggested there was a risk of dangerous protein variants slipping past existing screening software, so the situation was treated like the equivalent of a zero-day vulnerability.</p><p>Details of that original test are <a href=\"https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adu8578\">being made available today</a> as part of a much larger analysis that extends the approach to a large range of toxic proteins. Starting with 72 toxins, the researchers used three open source AI packages to generate a total of about 75,000 potential protein variants.</p><p>And this is where things get a little complicated. Many of the AI-designed protein variants are going to end up being non-functional, either subtly or catastrophically failing to fold up into the correct configuration to create an active toxin.</p><p>In any case, DNA sequences encoding all 75,000 designs were fed into the software that screens DNA orders for potential threats. One thing that was very clear is that there were huge variations in the ability of the four screening programs to flag these variant designs as threatening. Two of them seemed to do a pretty good job, one was mixed, and another let most of them through. Three of the software packages were updated in response to this performance, which significantly improved their ability to pick out variants.</p><p>There was also a clear trend in all four screening packages: The closer the variant was to the original structurally, the more likely the package (both before and after the patches) was to be able to flag it as a threat. In all cases, there was also a cluster of variant designs that were unlikely to fold into a similar structure, and these generally weren’t flagged as threats.</p></blockquote><p>The research is all preliminary, and there are a lot of ways in which the experiment diverges from reality. But I am not optimistic about this particular arms race. I think that the ability of AI systems to create something deadly will advance faster than the ability of AI systems to detect its components.</p>","contentLength":2273,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"ISC Stormcast For Thursday, October 30th, 2025 https://isc.sans.edu/podcastdetail/9678, (Thu, Oct 30th)","url":"https://isc.sans.edu/diary/rss/32434","date":1761789604,"author":"","guid":321096,"unread":true,"content":"<article>\n \n (c) SANS Internet Storm Center. https://isc.sans.edu Creative Commons Attribution-Noncommercial 3.0 United States License.</article>","contentLength":126,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"SE Labs Names Cisco Secure Firewall Best Enterprise NGFW 2025","url":"https://blogs.cisco.com/security/se-labs-names-cisco-secure-firewall-best-enterprise-ngfw-2025/","date":1761739200,"author":"Pramod Chandrashekar","guid":320661,"unread":true,"content":"<article>Cisco Secure Firewall wins SE Labs’ 2025 Best NGFW award — the first ever to earn dual AAA ratings for both protection and performance.

Rather than bolt KEM onto the existing double ratchet, they allowed it to remain more or less the same as it had been. Then they used the new quantum-safe ratchet to implement a parallel secure messaging system.</p><p>Now, when the protocol encrypts a message, it sources encryption keys from both the classic Double Ratchet and the new ratchet. It then mixes the two keys together (using a cryptographic key derivation function) to get a new encryption key that has all of the security of the classical Double Ratchet but now has quantum security, too.</p><p> The Signal engineers have given this third ratchet the formal name: Sparse Post Quantum Ratchet, or SPQR for short. The third ratchet was designed in collaboration with <a href=\"https://pqshield.com\">PQShield</a>, <a href=\"https://www.aist.go.jp/index_en.html\">AIST</a>, and New York University.

Between two users, you have a classical DH-based ratchet going on one side, and fully independently, a KEM-based ratchet is going on. Then, whenever you need to encrypt something, you get a key from both, and mix it up to get the actual encryption key. So, even if one ratchet is fully broken, be it because there is now a quantum computer, or because somebody manages to break either elliptic curves or ML-KEM, or because the implementation of one is flawed, or…, the Signal message will still be protected by the second ratchet. In a sense, this update can be seen, of course simplifying, as doubling the security of the ratchet part of Signal, and is a cool thing even for people that don’t care about quantum computers.</p></blockquote>","contentLength":2214,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Infocon: green","url":"https://isc.sans.edu/diary.html?rss","date":1761725103,"author":"","guid":320572,"unread":true,"content":"<article>How to collect memory-only filesystems on Linux systems</article>","contentLength":55,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"How to collect memory-only filesystems on Linux systems, (Wed, Oct 29th)","url":"https://isc.sans.edu/diary/rss/32432","date":1761713611,"author":"","guid":320518,"unread":true,"content":"<p>I've been doing Unix/Linux IR and Forensics for a long time. I logged into a Unix system for the first time in 1983. That's one of the reasons I love teaching <a href=\"https://www.sans.org/cyber-security-courses/linux-threat-hunting-incident-response\">FOR577</a>[1], because I have stories that go back to before some of my students were even born that are still relevant today.</p><p>In recent years, I've noticed a lot of attackers try to hide their tools or stage their data exfiltration in memory-only filesystems like  or other locations.</p><p>Unfortunately, you can't just  these tmpfs filesystems. There is no block device backing it that will let you take a forensically sound image. So, if I want to get all of the metadata and the contents of any files the attacker may have stashed there, I'm going to need to try something else. Fortunately, after thinking about it a bit, I came up with a method that worked for me. I even talked it over briefly with Hal Pomeranz and we couldn't come up with anything better. When I was thinking about this about a year ago, I did a quick Google search and didn't see anyone else having talked about this, but I'd be surprised if others haven't come up with the same idea.</p><p>The basic idea is to first collect the metadata (inode contents), then collect the file contents, since doing it in the other order would cause the access timestamp in the inode to be updated. Since I came up with this technique, I've used it on dozens (probably 100+) of systems with pretty good success. I have run into a handful that didn't have the  command, so I could only collect the contents, but not the inode metadata. You deal with what the system has available.</p><p><code>#&nbsp;find /dev/shm -exec $(which stat) -c '0|%N|%i|%A|%u|%g|%s|%X|%Y|%Z|%W' {} \\; | sed -e 's/|W$/|0/' -e s'/|?$/|0/' | ssh foo@system \"cat - &gt; $(hostname)-dev-shm-bodyfile\"</code></p><p>This commandline&nbsp;will use the  command to walk the  filesystem (in this example, ) and run the  command against every file and directory it finds. The  command is to compensate for versions of the  command that don't understand the  format string to print out the creation time (b-time). Then, I pipe the output to  to send to a remote system where I collect the evidence (you could, of course, save it off to a USB drive or some other mounted filesystem if you wish).&nbsp;Versions of the Linux&nbsp; package prior to, I believe, version 8.32 don't have/use the  system call to access the creation timestamp even though it is usually in the inode on recent systems. The output is in bodyfile format which can then be fed to the  program from <a href=\"https://sleuthkit.org/\">The Sleuth Kit (TSK)</a>[2] that can convert it into the classic filesystem timeline format.</p><p>Once the metadata is collected, it is safe to collect the file contents (understanding that some file contents may have changed in the interval between the commands). The command that I usually use is as follows.</p><p>find /dev/shm&nbsp;-type f -print | tar czvO -T - | ssh foo@system \"cat - &gt; $(hostname)-dev-shm-fs.tgz\"</p><p>This will use the  command to print out the names of all of the regular files (I've never found a need to collect any other type) and pipe them to the  command which will collect the contents (printing out the file names to stderr so I can see the progress) and output the (compressed because of the  switch) tarball to stdout to be piped to  to be collected on the same collection system. I then hash the tarball on the receiving system. I could, maybe should, hash the files on the live system I'm collecting from, but to this point, it hasn't been an issue.</p><p>As mentioned above, I've used this technique and many systems and even had it work on other Unix-ish systems like Juniper routers (that run FreeBSD under the hood) and even an ancient Solaris 9 system or two.</p><p>My last run of FOR577 for the year is in a few weeks at <a href=\"https://www.sans.org/cyber-security-training-events/dfircon-miami-2025\">DFIRCon</a>[3] in Miami where we will talk about this technique and lots of others.

Experts say a glut of proxies from Aisuru and other sources is fueling large-scale data harvesting efforts tied to various artificial intelligence (AI) projects, helping content scrapers evade detection by routing their traffic through residential connections that appear to be regular Internet users.</p><p>First identified in August 2024, Aisuru has spread to at least 700,000 IoT systems, such as poorly secured Internet routers and security cameras. Aisuru’s overlords have used their massive botnet to clobber targets with headline-grabbing DDoS attacks, flooding targeted hosts with blasts of junk requests from all infected systems simultaneously.</p><p>In June, Aisuru hit KrebsOnSecurity.com with a DDoS <a href=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2025/05/krebsonsecurity-hit-with-near-record-6-3-tbps-ddos/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">clocking at 6.3 terabits per second</a> — the biggest attack that  had ever mitigated at the time. In the weeks and months that followed, Aisuru’s operators demonstrated DDoS capabilities of nearly 30 terabits of data per second — well beyond the attack mitigation capabilities of most Internet destinations.</p><p>These digital sieges have been particularly disruptive this year for U.S.-based Internet service providers (ISPs), in part because Aisuru recently succeeded in <a href=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2025/10/ddos-botnet-aisuru-blankets-us-isps-in-record-ddos/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">taking over a large number of IoT devices in the United States</a>. And when Aisuru launches attacks, the volume of outgoing traffic from infected systems on these ISPs is often so high that it can disrupt or degrade Internet service for adjacent (non-botted) customers of the ISPs.</p><p>“Multiple broadband access network operators have experienced significant operational impact due to outbound DDoS attacks in excess of 1.5Tb/sec launched from Aisuru botnet nodes residing on end-customer premises,” wrote , principal engineer at , in a recent <a href=\"https://www.netscout.com/blog/asert/asert-threat-summary-aisuru-and-related-turbomirai-botnet-ddos\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">executive summary on Aisuru</a>. “Outbound/crossbound attack traffic exceeding 1Tb/sec from compromised customer premise equipment (CPE) devices has caused significant disruption to wireline and wireless broadband access networks. High-throughput attacks have caused chassis-based router line card failures.”</p><p>The incessant attacks from Aisuru have caught the attention of federal authorities in the United States and Europe (many of Aisuru’s victims are customers of ISPs and hosting providers based in Europe). Quite recently, some of the world’s largest ISPs have started informally sharing block lists identifying the rapidly shifting locations of the servers that the attackers use to control the activities of the botnet.</p><p>Experts say the Aisuru botmasters recently updated their malware so that compromised devices can more easily be rented to so-called “” providers. These proxy services allow paying customers to route their Internet communications through someone else’s device, providing anonymity and the ability to appear as a regular Internet user in almost any major city worldwide.</p><p>From a website’s perspective, the IP traffic of a residential proxy network user appears to originate from the rented residential IP address, not from the proxy service customer. Proxy services can be used in a legitimate manner for several business purposes — such as price comparisons or sales intelligence. But they are massively abused for hiding cybercrime activity (think advertising fraud, credential stuffing) because they can make it difficult to trace malicious traffic to its original source.</p><p>And as we’ll see in a moment, this entire shadowy industry appears to be shifting its focus toward enabling aggressive content scraping activity that continuously feeds raw data into large language models (LLMs) built to support various AI projects.</p><p> is co-founder of <a href=\"https://spur.us\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">spur.us</a>, a service that tracks proxy networks.

Brundage said if there is increasing confusion around which proxy networks are the most worrisome, it’s because nearly all of these lesser-known proxy services have evolved into highly incestuous bandwidth resellers. What’s more, he said, some proxy providers do not appreciate being tracked and have been known to take aggressive steps to confuse systems that scan the Internet for residential proxy nodes.</p><p>Brundage said most proxy services today have created their own  or SDK that other app developers can bundle with their code to earn revenue. These SDKs quietly modify the user’s device so that some portion of their bandwidth can be used to forward traffic from proxy service customers.</p><p>“Proxy providers have pools of constantly churning IP addresses,” he said. “These IP addresses are sourced through various means, such as bandwidth-sharing apps, botnets, Android SDKs, and more. These providers will often either directly approach resellers or offer a reseller program that allows users to resell bandwidth through their platform.”</p><p>Many SDK providers say they require full consent before allowing their software to be installed on end-user devices. Still, those opt-in agreements and consent checkboxes may be little more than a formality for cybercriminals like the Aisuru botmasters, who can earn a commission each time one of their infected devices is  some SDK that enables one or more of these proxy services.</p><p>Depending on its structure, a single provider may operate hundreds of different proxy pools at a time — all maintained through other means, Brundage said.</p><p>“Often, you’ll see resellers maintaining their own proxy pool in addition to an upstream provider,” he said. “It allows them to market a proxy pool to high-value clients and offer an unlimited bandwidth plan for cheap reduce their own costs.”</p><p>Some proxy providers appear to be directly in league with botmasters. Brundage identified one proxy seller that was aggressively advertising cheap and plentiful bandwidth to content scraping companies. After scanning that provider’s pool of available proxies, Brundage said he found a one-to-one match with IP addresses he’d previously mapped to the Aisuru botnet.</p><p>Brundage says that by almost any measurement, the world’s largest residential proxy service is , a China-based proxy network. IPidea is #5 on Spur’s Top 10, and Brundage said its brands include (#3), , , , , , , , and Spur’s Kilmer said they also track (#10) as IPidea.</p><p>Brundage said all of these providers operate under a corporate umbrella known on the cybercrime forums as “.”</p><p>“The way it works is there’s this whole reseller ecosystem, where IPidea will be incredibly aggressive and approach all these proxy providers with the offer, ‘Hey, if you guys buy bandwidth from us, we’ll give you these amazing reseller prices,'” Brundage explained. “But they’re also very aggressive in recruiting resellers for their apps.”</p><div><a href=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/synthient-hknetwork.png\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-72441\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/synthient-hknetwork.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"750\" height=\"517\" srcset=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/synthient-hknetwork.png 1126w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/synthient-hknetwork-768x529.png 768w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/synthient-hknetwork-782x539.png 782w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/synthient-hknetwork-100x70.png 100w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px\"></a><p>A graphic depicting the relationship between proxy providers that Synthient found are white labeling IPidea proxies.

That’s because by routing it through residential IP addresses, content scraping firms can make their traffic far trickier to filter out.</p><p>“It’s really difficult to block, because there’s a risk of blocking real people,” Spur’s Kilmer said of the LLM scraping activity that is fed through individual residential IP addresses, which are often shared by multiple customers at once.</p><p>Kilmer says the AI industry has brought a veneer of legitimacy to residential proxy business, which has heretofore mostly been associated with sketchy affiliate money making programs, automated abuse, and unwanted Internet traffic.</p><p> “Everybody wanted to monetize their own data pots, and how they monetize that is different across the board.”</p><p>Kilmer said many LLM-related scrapers rely on residential proxies in cases where the content provider has restricted access to their platform in some way, such as forcing interaction through an app, or keeping all content behind a login page with multi-factor authentication.</p><p>“Where the cost of data is out of reach — there is some exclusivity or reason they can’t access the data — they’ll turn to residential proxies so they look like a real person accessing that data,” Kilmer said of the content scraping efforts.</p><p>Aggressive AI crawlers increasingly <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/03/devs-say-ai-crawlers-dominate-traffic-forcing-blocks-on-entire-countries/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">are overloading community-maintained infrastructure</a>, causing what amounts to persistent DDoS attacks on vital public resources. A <a href=\"https://thelibre.news/foss-infrastructure-is-under-attack-by-ai-companies/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">report</a> earlier this year from  found some open-source projects now see as much as 97 percent of their traffic originating from AI company bots, dramatically increasing bandwidth costs, service instability, and burdening already stretched-thin maintainers.</p><p> is now experimenting with tools that will allow content creators to charge a fee to AI crawlers to scrape their websites. The company’s “<a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/ai-crawl-control/features/pay-per-crawl/what-is-pay-per-crawl/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">pay-per-crawl</a>” feature is currently in a private beta, and it lets publishers set their own prices that bots must pay before scraping content.</p><p>On October 22, the social media and news network <a href=\"https://redditinc.com/hubfs/Reddit%20Inc/Content/Reddit%20v.%20SerpApi.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">sued Oxylabs (PDF)</a> and several other proxy providers, alleging that their systems enabled the mass-scraping of Reddit user content even though Reddit had taken steps to block such activity.</p><p>“Recognizing that Reddit denies scrapers like them access to its site, Defendants scrape the data from Google’s search results instead,” the lawsuit alleges. “They do so by masking their identities, hiding their locations, and disguising their web scrapers as regular people (among other techniques) to circumvent or bypass the security restrictions meant to stop them.”</p><p>, chief governance and strategy officer at Oxylabs, said the company was shocked and disappointed by the lawsuit.</p><p>“Reddit has made no attempt to speak with us directly or communicate any potential concerns,” Grybauskas said in a written statement. “Oxylabs has always been and will continue to be a pioneer and an industry leader in public data collection, and it will not hesitate to defend itself against these allegations. Oxylabs’ position is that no company should claim ownership of public data that does not belong to them. It is possible that it is just an attempt to sell the same public data at an inflated price.”</p><p>As big and powerful as Aisuru may be, it is hardly the only botnet that is contributing to the overall broad availability of residential proxies. For example, on June 5 the FBI’s <strong>Internet Crime Complaint Center</strong><a href=\"https://www.ic3.gov/PSA/2025/PSA250605\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">warned</a> that an IoT malware threat dubbed <a href=\"https://www.humansecurity.com/learn/blog/satori-threat-intelligence-disruption-badbox-2-0/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">BADBOX 2.0</a> had compromised millions of smart-TV boxes, digital projectors, vehicle infotainment units, picture frames, and other IoT devices.</p><p>In July, Google filed <a href=\"https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/70683171/google-llc-v-does-1-25/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">a lawsuit</a> in New York federal court against the Badbox botnet’s alleged perpetrators. Google said the Badbox 2.0 botnet “compromised more than 10 million uncertified devices running Android’s open-source software, which lacks Google’s security protections. Cybercriminals infected these devices with pre-installed malware and exploited them to conduct large-scale ad fraud and other digital crimes.”</p><p>Brundage said the Aisuru botmasters have their own SDK, and for some reason part of its code tells many newly-infected systems to query the domain name . This may be little more than an elaborate “screw you” to this site’s author: One of the botnet’s alleged partners goes by the handle “,” and was <a href=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2025/05/krebsonsecurity-hit-with-near-record-6-3-tbps-ddos/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">identified in June by KrebsOnSecurity as a young man from Sao Paulo, Brazil</a>.</p><p>Brundage noted that only systems infected with Aisuru’s Android SDK will be forced to resolve the domain. Initially, there was some discussion about whether the domain might have some utility as a “kill switch” capable of disrupting the botnet’s operations, although Brundage and others interviewed for this story say that is unlikely.</p><div><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-72457\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/fbk-seralys-r.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"735\" height=\"707\"><p>A tiny sample of the traffic after a DNS server was enabled on the newly registered domain fuckbriankrebs dot com.

This suggested that some invisible characters were likely present…</p><p>A quick look at the e-mail headers proved this to be the case. The subject was composed of the following two lines:</p><pre><code>Subject: =?UTF-8?B?WcKtb3XCrXIgUMKtYXPCrXN3wq1vwq1yZCBpwq1zIEHCrWLCrW91dCA=?=\n\t=?UTF-8?B?dMKtbyBFwq14wq1wwq1pcsKtZQ==?=</code></pre><p>This formatting meant that the subject was included in the message in a MIME “encoded-word” format, which is described in RFC 2047 as having the following structure[<a href=\"https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2047\">1</a>]:</p><pre><code>encoded-word = \"=?\" charset \"?\" encoding \"?\" encoded-text \"?=\"</code></pre><p>In our case, the subject therefore consisted of two encoded words containing text written in the UTF-8 character set, which has been Base64 encoded.</p><p>Once both lines were decoded, one could clearly see that an invisible character was indeed being used in multiple places in the strings – specifically the soft hyphen, which has a Unicode code point U+00AD, and which is more commonly used as the &amp;shy; HTML entity[<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soft_hyphen\">2</a>].</p><p>Although soft hyphens aren’t – strictly speaking – invisible, Outlook as well as most other e-mail clients don’t render them as visible text in most cases.</p><p>The use of the soft hyphen character – combined with splitting the subject into multiple MIME encoded-words – was clearly intended as an attempt at bypassing e-mail filtering mechanisms that are supposed to automatically detect potentially malicious messages.</p><p>Why is this approach noteworthy?</p><p>Because although the use of invisible characters in phishing e-mails in general (and of the use of the “shy” character in particular[<a href=\"https://isc.sans.edu/diary/31626\">3</a>]) is quite common when it comes to making the contents of e-mail messages less readable to security solutions, it is quite unusual to see it also applied to a subject of a message.</p><p>In fact, the only allusion to this technique I’ve been able to find with a quick Google search was a general mention in an article by Microsoft Threat Intelligence from 2021, which states that “In several observed campaigns, attackers inserted invisible Unicode characters to break up keywords in an email body or  in an attempt to bypass detection and automated security analysis”[<a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2021/08/18/trend-spotting-email-techniques-how-modern-phishing-emails-hide-in-plain-sight/\">4</a>].</p><p>Since the use of invisible characters in e-mail subject lines doesn’t seem to be widely known, I have therefore decided that it would be worthwhile to dedicate this short diary to it.</p><p>It should be noted that the subject line wasn’t the only place where the soft hyphen character was used in the message – it was also heavily present in the text itself, where it was used to break up individual words…</p><p>For completeness’s sake, we should also mention that the link in the phishing pointed to the URL hxxps[:]//stopsoriasis[.]co[.]il/Webmail/webmail.php?email=[recipient@domain.tld], where a generic “webmail login” credential stealing page was placed…</p>\n\n \n (c) SANS Internet Storm Center. https://isc.sans.edu Creative Commons Attribution-Noncommercial 3.0 United States License.","contentLength":3230,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"ISC Stormcast For Tuesday, October 28th, 2025 https://isc.sans.edu/podcastdetail/9674, (Tue, Oct 28th)","url":"https://isc.sans.edu/diary/rss/32426","date":1761616802,"author":"","guid":317110,"unread":true,"content":"<article>\n \n (c) SANS Internet Storm Center. https://isc.sans.edu Creative Commons Attribution-Noncommercial 3.0 United States License.</article>","contentLength":126,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Louvre Jewel Heist","url":"https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2025/10/louvre-jewel-heist.html","date":1761577395,"author":"Bruce Schneier","guid":316811,"unread":true,"content":"<p>I assume I don’t have to explain last week’s <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/19/world/europe/louvre-paris-robbery.html\">Louvre jewel heist</a>.

In other words, a free-roaming Roomba could have provided the world’s most famous museum with more information about the interior of this space.

They need to be <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/louvre-robbery-stolen-jewels-jeweler-paris-france/\">taken apart</a> and sold in pieces. But then their value drops considerably—so the end result is that most of the worth of those items disappears.

What happens when we don't stick to the standards?</p><p>So I wanted to know what byte values I could transmit over DNS when using third-party DNS infrastructure over which I have no control, like my ISP, CloudFlare, Google, ...</p><p>In red, you have the machines I have control over: my workstation on the left, where I do the DNS queries, and my server on the Internet on the right, where I have my DNS software running (<a href=\"https://github.com/DidierStevens/DidierStevensSuite/blob/master/dnsresolver.py\">dnsresolver.py</a>).</p><p>In blue are the servers of the DNS infrastructure I'm using, over which I have no control.</p><p>, I'm using the name resolution API of the OS.</p><p>My queries look like this: bytes.41.A.mydomain.com. In this example, 41 is the hexadecimal value of the byte value I'm transmitting, and A is the ASCII representation of the byte value I'm transmitting. On the other end, I have my dnsresolver.py software running with a custom function, that checks the incoming request to see if the hexadecimal value still corresponds to the ASCII value. It logs the result in a log file, and replies with 127.0.0.1 if it matches, and with NXDOMAIN if it doesn't.</p><p>Then on my workstation, I do these queries for all byte values between 0x00 and 0xFF.</p><p>On Windows using CloudFlare (1.1.1.1), I can only reliably transmit letters (uppercase and lowercase), digits, a hyphen (-) and an underscore (_).</p><p>On Windows using Google (8.8.8.8), I can only reliably digits, a hyphen (-) and an underscore (_). Letters can not be reliably transmitted, because of an anti DNS-spoofing measure: Google will change the case of letters (for example, google.com becomes GoOgLe.com). You don't see that as an enduser, but my DNS software sees it.</p><p>So in theory, I could use BASE64 in a DNS C2 channel, provided CloudFlare is used and provided I replace + and / with - and _. And provided I don't use a padding character.</p><p>On Ubuntu, I can transmit reliably all ASCII characters (0x00 - 0x7F), except 0x00 and 0x2E (.). That's for CloudFlare. Google is the same, except for letters.</p><p>So I could do even better than BASE64, since I have 126 byte values at my disposition.</p><p>All byte values between 0x80 and 0xFF fail, most of them because they get converted to punicode.</p><p>On Windows and Ubuntu, I can transmit reliably all ASCII characters (0x00 - 0x7F), except 0x2E (.). That's for CloudFlare. Google is the same, except for letters.</p><p>The reason that the library cannot transmit a dot (.), so that's request bytes.2E...mydomain.com., is that in a DNS packet, a query is a encoded as a sequence of run-length encoded labels, and dots are not represented.&nbsp;</p><p>So mydomain.com. becomes:</p><p>0x08 is the length of label mydomain, 0x03 is the length of label com, and 0x00 is the length of the root label (the . at the end of mydomain.com.).</p><p>All byte values between 0x80 and 0xFF fail, most of them because they get converted to PUNICODE.</p><p>, I'm going to craft and transmit my own DNS packets, so that I have full control:</p><p>On Windows and Ubuntu, I can transmit reliably all ASCII characters (0x00 - 0x7F), also 0x2E (.). That's for CloudFlare. Google is the same, except for the letters.</p><p>And I can reliably transmit all values between 0x80 and 0xFF, but my dnsresolver.py tool that uses the dnslib Python library, can not parse them. So I would need to find a DNS packet parser that handles this, or write my own. I verified that values between 0x80 and 0xFF arrive reliably, but doing a packet capture on my server.</p><p>All byte values (even 0x2E .) can be reliably transmitted over the CloudFlare DNS infrastructure, provided one crafts and parses their own DNS packets.</p><p>On Google, all values are accepted too, but the case of letters can change because of Google's anti-spoofing measure.</p><p>If you want to perform your own DNS tests, you can find more details on my blog post \"<a href=\"https://blog.didierstevens.com/2025/10/27/bytes-over-dns-tools/\">Bytes over DNS Tools</a>\".</p><p>Next on my todo list is to perform research to detect abnormal DNS traffic like this.</p>\n\n \n (c) SANS Internet Storm Center. https://isc.sans.edu Creative Commons Attribution-Noncommercial 3.0 United States License.","contentLength":4432,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"ISC Stormcast For Monday, October 27th, 2025 https://isc.sans.edu/podcastdetail/9672, (Mon, Oct 27th)","url":"https://isc.sans.edu/diary/rss/32424","date":1761530402,"author":"","guid":315618,"unread":true,"content":"<article>\n \n (c) SANS Internet Storm Center. https://isc.sans.edu Creative Commons Attribution-Noncommercial 3.0 United States License.</article>","contentLength":126,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Kaitai Struct WebIDE, (Sun, Oct 26th)","url":"https://isc.sans.edu/diary/rss/32422","date":1761494513,"author":"","guid":315407,"unread":true,"content":"<p>When I have a binary file to analyze, I often use tools like 010 Editor or format-bytes.py (a tool I develop).
