The problem is that cryptographic primitives are typically designed to run on digital computers that use Boolean gates to map sequences of bits to sequences of bits, whereas DNNs are a special type of analog computer that uses linear mappings and ReLUs to map vectors of real numbers to vectors of real numbers. This discrepancy between the discrete and continuous computational models raises the question of what is the best way to implement standard cryptographic primitives as DNNs, and whether DNN implementations of secure cryptosystems remain secure in the new setting, in which an attacker can ask the DNN to process a message whose “bits” are arbitrary real numbers.</p><p>In this paper we lay the foundations of this new theory, defining the meaning of correctness and security for implementations of cryptographic primitives as ReLU-based DNNs. We then show that the natural implementations of block ciphers as DNNs can be broken in linear time by using such nonstandard inputs. We tested our attack in the case of full round AES-128, and had success rate in finding randomly chosen keys. Finally, we develop a new method for implementing any desired cryptographic functionality as a standard ReLU-based DNN in a provably secure and correct way. Our protective technique has very low overhead (a constant number of additional layers and a linear number of additional neurons), and is completely practical.</p>","contentLength":1674,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Wide World of Cyber: DeepSeek lobs an AI hand grenade","url":"https://risky.biz/WWC7/","date":1740105075,"author":"","guid":7585,"unread":true,"content":"<article></article>","contentLength":0,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"https://dts.podtrac.com/redirect.mp3/media3.risky.biz/WWC7.mp3","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"ISC Stormcast For Friday, February 21st, 2025 https://isc.sans.edu/podcastdetail/9334, (Fri, Feb 21st)","url":"https://isc.sans.edu/diary/rss/31708","date":1740099046,"author":"","guid":7530,"unread":true,"content":"<article>\n \n (c) SANS Internet Storm Center. https://isc.sans.edu Creative Commons Attribution-Noncommercial 3.0 United States License.</article>","contentLength":126,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Tool update: sigs.py - added check mode, (Fri, Feb 21st)","url":"https://isc.sans.edu/diary/rss/31706","date":1740096036,"author":"","guid":7529,"unread":true,"content":"<p>Over the years, I've written a number of scripts to make my life easier.

But they also offer a more cutting-edge mobile fraud technology: Merrill found that at least one of the Chinese phishing groups sells an Android app called “” that can relay a valid NFC transaction to anywhere in the world. The user simply waves their phone at a local payment terminal that accepts Apple or Google pay, and the app relays an NFC transaction over the Internet from a phone in China.</p><p>“The software can work from anywhere in the world,” Merrill said. “These guys provide the software for $500 a month, and it can relay both NFC enabled tap-to-pay as well as any digital wallet.

In this case, anything typed into the data fields of the phishing page will be captured in real time, regardless of whether the visitor actually clicks the “submit” button.</p><p>Merrill said people who submit payment card data to these phishing sites often are then told their card can’t be processed, and urged to use a different card. This technique, he said, sometimes allows the phishers to steal more than one mobile wallet per victim.</p><p>Many phishing websites expose victim data by storing the stolen information directly on the phishing domain. But Merrill said these Chinese phishing kits will forward all victim data to a back-end database operated by the phishing kit vendors. That way, even when the smishing sites get taken down for fraud, the stolen data is still safe and secure.</p><p>Another important innovation is the use of mass-created Apple and Google user accounts through which these phishers send their spam messages. One of the Chinese phishing groups posted images on their Telegram sales channels showing how these robot Apple and Google accounts are loaded onto Apple and Google phones, and arranged snugly next to each other in an expansive, multi-tiered rack that sits directly in front of the phishing service operator.</p><div><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-70435\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/phonesashtray.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"518\" height=\"688\"><p>The ashtray says: You’ve been phishing all night.</p></div><p>In other words, the smishing websites are powered by real human operators as long as new messages are being sent. Merrill said the criminals appear to send only a few dozen messages at a time, likely because completing the scam takes manual work by the human operators in China. After all, most one-time codes used for mobile wallet provisioning are generally only good for a few minutes before they expire.</p><p>Notably, none of the phishing sites spoofing the toll operators or postal services will load in a regular Web browser; they will only render if they detect that a visitor is coming from a mobile device.</p><p>“One of the reasons they want you to be on a mobile device is they want you to be on the same device that is going to receive the one-time code,” Merrill said. “They also want to minimize the chances you will leave. And if they want to get that mobile tokenization and grab your one-time code, they need a live operator.”</p><p>Merrill found the Chinese phishing kits feature another innovation that makes it simple for customers to turn stolen card details into a mobile wallet: They programmatically take the card data supplied by the phishing victim and convert it into a digital image of a real payment card that matches that victim’s financial institution. That way, attempting to enroll a stolen card into Apple Pay, for example, becomes as easy as scanning the fabricated card image with an iPhone.</p><div><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-70439\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/phish-cabelas.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"397\" height=\"488\"><p>An ad from a Chinese SMS phishing group’s Telegram channel showing how the service converts stolen card data into an image of the stolen card.</p></div><p>“The phone isn’t smart enough to know whether it’s a real card or just an image,” Merrill said. “So it scans the card into Apple Pay, which says okay we need to verify that you’re the owner of the card by sending a one-time code.”</p><p>How profitable are these mobile phishing kits? The best guess so far comes from data gathered by other security researchers who’ve been tracking these advanced Chinese phishing vendors.</p><p>In August 2023, the security firm Resecurity <a href=\"https://www.resecurity.com/blog/article/smishing-triad-targeted-usps-and-us-citizens-for-data-theft\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">discovered a vulnerability</a> in one popular Chinese phish kit vendor’s platform that exposed the personal and financial data of phishing victims. Resecurity dubbed the group the , and found the gang had harvested 108,044 payment cards across 31 phishing domains (3,485 cards per domain).</p><p>In August 2024, security researcher  gave <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLOv67LlIQs&amp;list=PL9fPq3eQfaaB2scbXRczwvjVH0ckX4bwt&amp;index=14\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">a presentation</a> at the DEFCON security conference about tracking down the Smishing Triad after scammers spoofing the U.S. Postal Service <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/usps-scam-text-smishing-triad/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">duped his wife</a>. By identifying a different vulnerability in the gang’s phishing kit, Smith said he was able to see that people entered 438,669 unique credit cards in 1,133 phishing domains (387 cards per domain).</p><p>Based on his research, Merrill said it’s reasonable to expect between $100 and $500 in losses on each card that is turned into a mobile wallet. Merrill said they observed nearly 33,000 unique domains tied to these Chinese smishing groups during the year between the publication of Resecurity’s research and Smith’s DEFCON talk.</p><p>Using a median number of 1,935 cards per domain and a conservative loss of $250 per card, that comes out to about $15 billion in fraudulent charges over a year.</p><p>Merrill was reluctant to say whether he’d identified additional security vulnerabilities in any of the phishing kits sold by the Chinese groups, noting that the phishers quickly fixed the vulnerabilities that were detailed publicly by Resecurity and Smith.</p><p>Adoption of touchless payments took off in the United States after the Coronavirus pandemic emerged, and many financial institutions in the United States were eager to make it simple for customers to link payment cards to mobile wallets. Thus, the authentication requirement for doing so defaulted to sending the customer a one-time code via SMS.</p><p>Experts say the continued reliance on one-time codes for onboarding mobile wallets has fostered this new wave of carding. KrebsOnSecurity interviewed a security executive from a large European financial institution who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to the press.</p><p>That expert said the lag between the phishing of victim card data and its eventual use for fraud has left many financial institutions struggling to correlate the causes of their losses.</p><p>“That’s part of why the industry as a whole has been caught by surprise,” the expert said. “A lot of people are asking, how this is possible now that we’ve tokenized a plaintext process. We’ve never seen the volume of sending and people responding that we’re seeing with these phishers.”</p><p>To improve the security of digital wallet provisioning, some banks in Europe and Asia require customers to log in to the bank’s mobile app before they can link a digital wallet to their device.</p><p>Addressing the ghost tap threat may require updates to contactless payment terminals, to better identify NFC transactions that are being relayed from another device. But experts say it’s unrealistic to expect retailers will be eager to replace existing payment terminals before their expected lifespans expire.</p><p>And of course Apple and Google have an increased role to play as well, given that their accounts are being created en masse and used to blast out these smishing messages. Both companies could easily tell which of their devices suddenly have 7-10 different mobile wallets added from 7-10 different people around the world. They could also recommend that financial institutions use more secure authentication methods for mobile wallet provisioning.</p><p>Neither Apple nor Google responded to requests for comment on this story.</p>","contentLength":13273,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"https://SecTemplates.com - simplified, free open-source templates to enable engineering and smaller security teams to bootstrap security capabilities for their organizations, (Tue, Feb 18th)","url":"https://isc.sans.edu/diary/rss/31696","date":1739900366,"author":"","guid":4361,"unread":true,"content":"<article>\n \n (c) SANS Internet Storm Center. https://isc.sans.edu Creative Commons Attribution-Noncommercial 3.0 United States License.</article>","contentLength":126,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Story About Medical Device Security","url":"https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2025/02/story-about-medical-device-security.html","date":1739880367,"author":"Bruce Schneier","guid":4115,"unread":true,"content":"<p>Ben Rothke <a href=\"https://brothke.medium.com/how-not-to-hire-for-a-senior-information-security-role-4bf71ce7ee26?sk=9cab2444ee1ead944e41ab61445aea4c\">relates a story</a> about me working with a medical device firm back when I was with BT.

Post training, model’s mathematical representations can be stored in a variety of data serialization formats to be shared and reused without the need for additional model training. Pickle is a popular Python module used for serializing and deserializing ML model data. While easy to use, Pickle is considered an unsafe data format, as it allows Python code to be executed during ML model deserialization.[2]\nAs you can imagine, even as protective measures are being implemented, safety scanning is still recommended. ModelScan offers such capabilities with ease and convenience.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://github.com/protectai/modelscan\">ModelScan</a>&nbsp;is incredibly well documented and include&nbsp;<a href=\"https://github.com/protectai/modelscan/tree/main/notebooks\">notebooks</a>&nbsp;to aid experimentation and adoption.\nI’ll share my quick setup steps, modify to your liking and preferences.

The attack functions by exploiting the saving and loading process of models. When you load a model with model = torch.load(PATH), PyTorch opens the contents of the file and begins to running the code within. The second you load the model the exploit has executed.\"[3] A Model Serialization Attack can be used to execute:</p><ul><li>Credential Theft (Cloud credentials for writing and reading data to other systems in your environment)</li><li>Data Theft (the request sent to the model)</li><li>Data Poisoning (the data sent after the model has performed its task)</li><li>Model Poisoning (altering the results of the model itself)</li></ul><p>I took liberties with the&nbsp;<em>pytorch_sentiment_analysis</em>&nbsp;notebook found in&nbsp;&nbsp;and modified it to exemplify local Google Cloud credential secrets disclosure as opposed those for AWS as conveyed in the original notebook.\nOne note of interest. PyTorch is moving from away from what was a default configuration where&nbsp;&nbsp;ran with&nbsp;&nbsp;set to false, and is issuing the following warning if you don’t set the parameter to false (for experimention only) explicitly.\n“<em>torch.load() unless weights_only parameter is set to True, uses pickle module implicitly, which is known to be insecure. It is possible to construct malicious pickle data which will execute arbitrary code during unpickling. Never load data that could have come from an untrusted source in an unsafe mode, or that could have been tampered with. Only load data you trust.</em>”\nCertainly, a good safety update for added protection, but thou shalt still scan. ;-)&nbsp;conveys notebook setup and the BERT based sentiment analysis PyTorch model used as the test subject.</p><p>&nbsp;Setup and model saving</p><p>As seen in&nbsp;, the notebook next offers prediction via the safe version of the model, then executes ModelScan with clean results to be expected.</p><p>&nbsp;Safe prediction and initial model scan</p><p><em>modelscan –path PyTorchModels/safe_model.pt</em>&nbsp;yields&nbsp;.</p><p>Next, we inject “malicious” code,&nbsp;<code>cat ~/.config/gcloud/credentials.db</code>&nbsp;in the safe model to simply read my Google Cloud client secret. A more sophisticated attack could include a reverse shell or secrets exfiltration.

They also have commercial offerings to better secure your AI implementations. To reiterate their assertion, model scanning must be performed more than once to accomplish the following:</p><ul><li>Scan all pre-trained models before loading it for further work to prevent a compromised model from impacting your model building or data science environments</li><li>Scan all models after training to detect a supply chain attack that compromises new models</li><li>Scan all models before deploying to an endpoint to ensure that the model has not been compromised after storage</li></ul><p>Start with ModelScan, also give&nbsp;<a href=\"https://github.com/trailofbits/fickling\">Fickling</a>&nbsp;an indepth look, and avoid falling victim to headline generating AI/ML attack scenarios.</p><p>Recommended reading and tooling:</p>\n\n \n (c) SANS Internet Storm Center. https://isc.sans.edu Creative Commons Attribution-Noncommercial 3.0 United States License.","contentLength":5672,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Atlas of Surveillance","url":"https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2025/02/atlas-of-surveillance.html","date":1739810159,"author":"Bruce Schneier","guid":1915,"unread":true,"content":"<p>The EFF has released its <a href=\"https://atlasofsurveillance.org/\">Atlas of Surveillance</a>, which documents police surveillance technology across the US.</p>","contentLength":109,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"My Very Personal Guidance and Strategies to Protect Network Edge Devices, (Thu, Feb 6th)","url":"https://isc.sans.edu/diary/rss/31660","date":1739796664,"author":"","guid":1856,"unread":true,"content":"<p>Last week, CISA and other national cyber security organizations published an extensive document outlining \"Guidance and Strategies to Protect Network Edge Devices.\" [1]&nbsp;The document is good but also very corporate and \"bland.\" It summarizes good, well-intended advice that will help you secure edge devices. But reading it also made me think, \"That's it?\" Not that I expected earth-shattering advice eliminating vulnerabilities brought on by accumulating deceased worth of abandoned ware still peddled at often relatively high costs. But I don't know; maybe something more actionable would be helpful.&nbsp;</p><p>So here is my advice from the small network that is maintained, like so many, \"on the side\" and not by a team of dedicated edge device experts.</p><h3>0 - Limit Access to Admin Functions</h3><p>Before you do anything, limit access to admin interfaces, and do not forget access via SSH or APIs. At the bare minimum, access should only be available via the LAN interface. Carefully select any exposed services. SSH may be an option if you must have remote access or a VPN solution (many devices support Wireguard, OpenVPN, or other protocols). But the fewer options you enable, the better. Avoid exposing web-based APIs, admin interfaces, or SSL VPN gateways at all costs. HTTPs will not protect you in this case. The issue is numerous web application vulnerabilities that keep popping up in these devices. Move any exposed admin services (HTTPS or SSH) to non-default ports.</p><p>Removing internet access to admin features will eliminate the vast majority of threats. If you must expose a VPN or SSH, continue reading.</p><h3>1 - Change Credentials and use MFA</h3><p>Maybe this should be 0. Either way, Change your credentials. Your device doesn’t support MFA? Get a different one! Even open-source solutions usually support some kind of MFA these days. OPNSense makes it a bit painful, but it works. Maybe even use a different username instead of \"admin\" and disable \"admin\"/\"root\" if that is an option. It helps a bit. Harden protocols like SSH by using keys.</p><h3>2 - Define a monthly \"Router Update Day.\"</h3><p>I don't care when. Third Thursday of the month, mornings, 10 am? Check if there is an update waiting; check the release notes. Is it important? Apply now. Can it wait? Apply later. Having redundant perimeter devices should be doable even for a smaller network. Add a monthly \"perimeter update\" reminder to your calendar. Some device manufacturers have mailing lists to notify you of updates or release updates on a specific schedule.</p><p>Some may not agree with this advice. Commercial permitter security devices are often counterproductive. You can find well-respected, preconfigured, open-source perimeter security devices.&nbsp;For smaller networks, OpenWRT will work great.&nbsp;Use PFSense or OPNSense if you operate a more complex network or need additional features. Open-source packages provide much longer support timelines for existing hardware. Updates are usually painless, support is easy to come by, and, most importantly,&nbsp;You will have more insight into how the device works. Commercial systems make it sound like it is worth spending a lot of money to get less: A black box with a lot of magic packet dust. However, you will not be able to understand how the device works and how to debug it effectively. Some people say that you \"pay with your time\". The opposite is true in this case: Understanding and maintaining a closed-source solution for perimeter security devices is often more time-consuming or MUCH MORE expensive.&nbsp;</p><p>If it makes the boss happy, Buy a support contract. Multiple companies or developers behind the particular solution will offer commercial support contracts at competitive prices for all the open-source solutions mentioned above.</p><h3>4 - Mark the Devices Expiration Date</h3><p>Every device has an expiration date. As you purchase it, define how long the device will be in your network. Keep yourself honest. Apply a sticker to the device noting when and where it was purchased (nice for warranty, too) and when it is supposed to be replaced.</p><h3>5 - Create Automated Configuration Backups</h3><p>Once a day? The important part is to automate it. It will not happen unless you automate it. These configuration backups are essential for configuration downgrades to recover from a lousy upgrade quickly or if you need to replace a device. Sadly, this often requires a distinct process.</p><h3>6 - Edge Devices are Endpoints too</h3><p>So install endpoint protection software! OPNsense supports Wazuh (I think PFSense, too). Find out what works for your device. At the very least, monitor unapproved changes to the configuration backups. This may be an area where you want to spend some money on commercial software if needed and if it is applicable.</p><p>[1]&nbsp;https://www.cisa.gov/resources-tools/resources/guidance-and-strategies-protect-network-edge-devices</p>\n\n \n (c) SANS Internet Storm Center. https://isc.sans.edu Creative Commons Attribution-Noncommercial 3.0 United States License.","contentLength":4936,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Meet the Cybersecurity Defender of 2025 for EMEA","url":"https://blogs.cisco.com/security/meet-the-cybersecurity-defender-of-2025-for-emea/","date":1739781000,"author":"Cristina Errico","guid":1672,"unread":true,"content":"<article>Cisco's 2025 EMEA Cybersecurity Defender of the Year award goes to the team at SAP Enterprise Cloud Services, who raised the bar for overall security posture.</article>","contentLength":158,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"ISC Stormcast For Monday, February 17th, 2025 https://isc.sans.edu/podcastdetail/9326, (Mon, Feb 17th)","url":"https://isc.sans.edu/diary/rss/31690","date":1739755324,"author":"","guid":886,"unread":true,"content":"<article>\n \n (c) SANS Internet Storm Center. https://isc.sans.edu Creative Commons Attribution-Noncommercial 3.0 United States License.</article>","contentLength":126,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null}],"tags":["infosec"]}
