You see smooth demos of golden paths and self-service platforms. However, there’s a significant area of challenges that is less talked about and thus often neglected when designing developer platforms.\n\nIn this talk, we’ll explore the often-overlooked day 2 challenges that platform teams face. We’ll dissect the area of day 2 into the many sub-areas and challenges they pose. Drawing on real-world experiences, including notable migrations that many in this community have faced, we'll shed light on the pain behind developer platforms and discuss solutions to these issues. Among others, we’ll delve into practical strategies for managing versioning and rollouts, and highlight the significant hurdles encountered, such as dependencies on end user teams or GitOps.\n\nJoin us for insights, strategies, and stories from the trenches that will help you navigate the complexities of service iteration in developer platforms.</article>","contentLength":1476,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/v/Xr0Eb-ybvck?version=3","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Keynote: OpenTelemetry And The Future of Open Source Observability - Austin Parker, Honeycomb","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hERRANApN5c","date":1751391324,"author":"CNCF [Cloud Native Computing Foundation]","guid":179127,"unread":true,"content":"<article>Don't miss out!

Telemetry generation is becoming a solved problem, an implementation detail. But this has created a new challenge: a wealth of standardized signals with no standard meaning. Different systems instrumented with different semantics generating telemetry in their own unique language. And while signal correlation connects specific workloads, it fails when we need to understand our systems at a macro scale by joining disparate datasets.\nThat is, until we all agreed to speak the same language.\n\nJust as English as a lingua franca fueled progress across the internet, OpenTelemetry Semantic Conventions are providing a shared language for our systems. In this talk we’ll discuss why semantic interoperability is the real connective tissue, how it’s fueling deeper insights into our production environments, and the key role it plays in enabling the AI systems that are rapidly ushering in the next revolution of our industry.</article>","contentLength":1500,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/v/dlDTX-aDNzg?version=3","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Welcome + Opening Remarks - Austin Parker, Honeycomb","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_rqgWHaEvgc","date":1751391324,"author":"CNCF [Cloud Native Computing Foundation]","guid":179129,"unread":true,"content":"<article>Don't miss out!

It is very difficult to know which logs are useful and how exactly they are used. With Chronosphere's Control plane for logs users can now get a comprehensive analysis of value and usage patterns, along with sophisticated recommendations and control actions that allow some or most of the value derived from those logs to be preserved. In order to achieve our goals we have enhanced Fluent Bit to be more flexible in which logs are actioned upon and will share useful future additions to it.</article>","contentLength":1072,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/v/Z4umnlRdLtA?version=3","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Keynote: Hybrid Cloud Architecture: Making Big Bets on Open Standards - Margaret Dawson","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_hHiwa_3QU","date":1751391324,"author":"CNCF [Cloud Native Computing Foundation]","guid":179131,"unread":true,"content":"<article>Don't miss out!

With 39% of CNCF survey respondents already operating in hybrid environments, this model is here to stay. But as teams pursue cloud-native architectures, many skip a critical step: developing a clear cloud strategy and an observability approach to match.\nThe result is predictable— widening visibility gaps, redundant tooling and data, and spiraling costs as teams try to stitch together disconnected, vendor-specific systems never meant to work in concert. Hybrid environments expose these issues quickly, especially when workloads span multiple platforms without a unified way to observe and understand them.\nModernization efforts demand open observability from the start—not as an add-on. Technologies like OpenTelemetry, Fluent Bit, and Prometheus act as connective tissue across clouds, clusters, and on-prem infrastructure, enabling standardization where it’s needed most.\nThis talk outlines how to center open observability in your modernization journey: where to standardize architectural layers, how to maintain a more open approach, and why these decisions have long-term payoff. \nHybrid complexity is inevitable. Leading with open observability is how you stay in control—now and in the future.</article>","contentLength":1761,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/v/J_hHiwa_3QU?version=3","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Sponsored Keynote: Foundation-Led Innovation: OpenSearch's Impact on Modern Data I...

Just Native OpenTelemetry - Liudmila Molkova, Microsoft\n\nThe best telemetry starts at the source—inside the client libraries.\nBut in most cases, that means taking a dependency on the OpenTelemetry API from your library. And while it’s stable, minimal, reliable, and safely no-op unless configured—transitive dependencies are still the bane of any library developer’s existence, and most of us try to avoid them.\n\nTo work around this, people reach for abstractions, plugins, bridges, or even OTel forks that break context propagation. The result? A poor user experience. Users must find the right plugin, install it, wire it up—and still hit the diamond dependency problem, now it just affects a subset of users.\n\nBut what if you could take a truly optional dependency? If OpenTelemetry is on the classpath, instrumentation kicks in. If it’s not, no harm done.\nHow hard is that to pull off? How reliable? How performant?\n\nLet’s explore that—through the lens of the next generation of Azure SDKs for Java.

To tackle this problem, we developed a cache system with the following features:\n\n* New Cache Hierarchy: Images pulled by pods are shared across the entire cluster, enabling cluster-wide optimization, not only cluster-local cache.\n* Ninja: Users experience faster container image pulls without any changes on their part. Just like a ninja, the system stealthily enhances performance.\n* Preheating: It supports pushing images to preheat the cache for subsequent pulls.\n\nDeployed in a production cluster, the cache system has achieved a cache hit rate of around 95%, significantly reducing pod startup times and network communication with registries. Attendees will learn practical insights into leveraging cache and CRI to optimize image and OCI artifact pulls, ultimately enhancing cluster efficiency.</article>","contentLength":1535,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/v/trFILyK6mPw?version=3","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"2-Node Kubernetes: A Reliable and Compatible Solution - Xin Zhang & Guang Hu, Microsoft","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-SlSp7Y0wE","date":1750970957,"author":"CNCF [Cloud Native Computing Foundation]","guid":172479,"unread":true,"content":"<article>Don't miss out!

This approach requires only a simple shared storage witness.\n\nIn this session, we will unpack the mechanics of this innovation, demonstrate 2-node cluster provisioning, and showcase its resilience under real-world failure scenarios.</article>","contentLength":1473,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/v/l-SlSp7Y0wE?version=3","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Add Single-sign-on To Your Applications With Keycloak and Learn...

However, challenges remain, particularly in achieving enough isolation for public clouds where multi-tenancy exists. This is because Wasm shares the host kernel between workloads like containers. To take full advantage of Wasm, there is still insufficient discussion on this problem.\n\nTo address the issue, we've developed a new Wasm runtime, Mewz. It runs a single Wasm module within a dedicated VM while also having a lightweight and specialized kernel (unikernel). This revolutionary execution model enables more secure and low-overhead Wasm containers. We've open-sourced the implementation, and Mewz is listed in the CNCF cloud native landscape! In this session, we'll explain the architecture of Mewz and why it's more isolated and low-overhead than ordinary Wasm runtimes. Building on this presentation, let’s discuss the future of cloud workloads powered by Wasm!</article>","contentLength":1517,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/v/fV_SDqzRAG4?version=3","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Streamlined Baremetal Deployment: A Journey of Custom Controll...
