While the component migration is now done, this leaves some additional\ncomplexity for users and installer projects (for example, kOps or Cluster API) . We will go\nover those additional steps and failure points and make recommendations for cluster owners.\nThis migration was complex and some logic had to be extracted from the core components,\nbuilding four new subsystems.</p><p>One of the most critical functionalities of the cloud controller manager is the node controller,\nwhich is responsible for the initialization of the nodes.</p><p>As you can see in the following diagram, when the  starts, it registers the \nobject with the apiserver, Tainting the node so it can be processed first by the\ncloud-controller-manager.

Previously, the kubelet\nwas able to initialize the node at the same time it created the node. Since the logic has moved\nto the cloud-controller-manager, this can cause a <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/running-cloud-controller/#chicken-and-egg\">chicken and egg problem</a>\nduring the cluster bootstrapping for those Kubernetes architectures that do not deploy the\ncontroller manager as the other components of the control plane, commonly as static pods,\nstandalone binaries or daemonsets/deployments with tolerations to the taints and using\n (more on this below)</p><h2>Examples of the dependency problem</h2><p>As noted above, it is possible during bootstrapping for the cloud-controller-manager to be\nunschedulable and as such the cluster will not initialize properly. The following are a few\nconcrete examples of how this problem can be expressed and the root causes for why they might\noccur.</p><p>These examples assume you are running your cloud-controller-manager using a Kubernetes resource\n(e.g. Deployment, DaemonSet, or similar) to control its lifecycle. Because these methods\nrely on Kubernetes to schedule the cloud-controller-manager, care must be taken to ensure it\nwill schedule properly.</p><h3>Example: Cloud controller manager not scheduling due to uninitialized taint</h3><p>As <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/running-cloud-controller/#running-cloud-controller-manager\">noted in the Kubernetes documentation</a>, when the kubelet is started with the command line\nflag <code>--cloud-provider=external</code>, its corresponding  object will have a no schedule taint\nnamed <code>node.cloudprovider.kubernetes.io/uninitialized</code> added. Because the cloud-controller-manager\nis responsible for removing the no schedule taint, this can create a situation where a\ncloud-controller-manager that is being managed by a Kubernetes resource, such as a \nor , may not be able to schedule.</p><p>If the cloud-controller-manager is not able to be scheduled during the initialization of the\ncontrol plane, then the resulting  objects will all have the\n<code>node.cloudprovider.kubernetes.io/uninitialized</code> no schedule taint. It also means that this taint\nwill not be removed as the cloud-controller-manager is responsible for its removal. If the no\nschedule taint is not removed, then critical workloads, such as the container network interface\ncontrollers, will not be able to schedule, and the cluster will be left in an unhealthy state.</p><h3>Example: Cloud controller manager not scheduling due to not-ready taint</h3><p>The next example would be possible in situations where the container network interface (CNI) is\nwaiting for IP address information from the cloud-controller-manager (CCM), and the CCM has not\ntolerated the taint which would be removed by the CNI.</p><blockquote><p>\"The Node controller detects whether a Node is ready by monitoring its health and adds or removes this taint accordingly.\"</p></blockquote><p>One of the conditions that can lead to a  resource having this taint is when the container\nnetwork has not yet been initialized on that node. As the cloud-controller-manager is responsible\nfor adding the IP addresses to a  resource, and the IP addresses are needed by the container\nnetwork controllers to properly configure the container network, it is possible in some\ncircumstances for a node to become stuck as not ready and uninitialized permanently.</p><p>This situation occurs for a similar reason as the first example, although in this case, the\n<code>node.kubernetes.io/not-ready</code> taint is used with the no execute effect and thus will cause the\ncloud-controller-manager not to run on the node with the taint. If the cloud-controller-manager is\nnot able to execute, then it will not initialize the node. It will cascade into the container\nnetwork controllers not being able to run properly, and the node will end up carrying both the\n<code>node.cloudprovider.kubernetes.io/uninitialized</code> and <code>node.kubernetes.io/not-ready</code> taints,\nleaving the cluster in an unhealthy state.</p><p>There is no one “correct way” to run a cloud-controller-manager. The details will depend on the\nspecific needs of the cluster administrators and users. When planning your clusters and the\nlifecycle of the cloud-controller-managers please consider the following guidance:</p><p>For cloud-controller-managers running in the same cluster, they are managing.</p><ol><li>Use host network mode, rather than the pod network: in most cases, a cloud controller manager\nwill need to communicate with an API service endpoint associated with the infrastructure.\nSetting “hostNetwork” to true will ensure that the cloud controller is using the host\nnetworking instead of the container network and, as such, will have the same network access as\nthe host operating system. It will also remove the dependency on the networking plugin. This\nwill ensure that the cloud controller has access to the infrastructure endpoint (always check\nyour networking configuration against your infrastructure provider’s instructions).</li><li>Use a scalable resource type.  and  are useful for controlling the\nlifecycle of a cloud controller. They allow easy access to running multiple copies for redundancy\nas well as using the Kubernetes scheduling to ensure proper placement in the cluster. When using\nthese primitives to control the lifecycle of your cloud controllers and running multiple\nreplicas, you must remember to enable leader election, or else your controllers will collide\nwith each other which could lead to nodes not being initialized in the cluster.</li><li>Target the controller manager containers to the control plane. There might exist other\ncontrollers which need to run outside the control plane (for example, Azure’s node manager\ncontroller). Still, the controller managers themselves should be deployed to the control plane.\nUse a node selector or affinity stanza to direct the scheduling of cloud controllers to the\ncontrol plane to ensure that they are running in a protected space. Cloud controllers are vital\nto adding and removing nodes to a cluster as they form a link between Kubernetes and the\nphysical infrastructure. Running them on the control plane will help to ensure that they run\nwith a similar priority as other core cluster controllers and that they have some separation\nfrom non-privileged user workloads.\n<ol><li>It is worth noting that an anti-affinity stanza to prevent cloud controllers from running\non the same host is also very useful to ensure that a single node failure will not degrade\nthe cloud controller performance.</li></ol></li><li>Ensure that the tolerations allow operation. Use tolerations on the manifest for the cloud\ncontroller container to ensure that it will schedule to the correct nodes and that it can run\nin situations where a node is initializing. This means that cloud controllers should tolerate\nthe <code>node.cloudprovider.kubernetes.io/uninitialized</code> taint, and it should also tolerate any\ntaints associated with the control plane (for example, <code>node-role.kubernetes.io/control-plane</code>\nor <code>node-role.kubernetes.io/master</code>). It can also be useful to tolerate the\n<code>node.kubernetes.io/not-ready</code> taint to ensure that the cloud controller can run even when the\nnode is not yet available for health monitoring.</li></ol><p>For cloud-controller-managers that will not be running on the cluster they manage (for example,\nin a hosted control plane on a separate cluster), then the rules are much more constrained by the\ndependencies of the environment of the cluster running the cloud-controller-manager. The advice\nfor running on a self-managed cluster may not be appropriate as the types of conflicts and network\nconstraints will be different. Please consult the architecture and requirements of your topology\nfor these scenarios.</p><p>This is an example of a Kubernetes Deployment highlighting the guidance shown above. It is\nimportant to note that this is for demonstration purposes only, for production uses please\nconsult your cloud provider’s documentation.</p><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code>apiVersion: apps/v1\nkind: Deployment\nmetadata:\nlabels:\napp.kubernetes.io/name: cloud-controller-manager\nname: cloud-controller-manager\nnamespace: kube-system\nspec:\nreplicas: 2\nselector:\nmatchLabels:\napp.kubernetes.io/name: cloud-controller-manager\nstrategy:\ntype: Recreate\ntemplate:\nmetadata:\nlabels:\napp.kubernetes.io/name: cloud-controller-manager\nannotations:\nkubernetes.io/description: Cloud controller manager for my infrastructure\nspec:\ncontainers: # the container details will depend on your specific cloud controller manager\n- name: cloud-controller-manager\ncommand:\n- /bin/my-infrastructure-cloud-controller-manager\n- --leader-elect=true\n- -v=1\nimage: registry/my-infrastructure-cloud-controller-manager@latest\nresources:\nrequests:\ncpu: 200m\nmemory: 50Mi\nhostNetwork: true # these Pods are part of the control plane\nnodeSelector:\nnode-role.kubernetes.io/control-plane: \"\"\naffinity:\npodAntiAffinity:\nrequiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:\n- topologyKey: \"kubernetes.io/hostname\"\nlabelSelector:\nmatchLabels:\napp.kubernetes.io/name: cloud-controller-manager\ntolerations:\n- effect: NoSchedule\nkey: node-role.kubernetes.io/master\noperator: Exists\n- effect: NoExecute\nkey: node.kubernetes.io/unreachable\noperator: Exists\ntolerationSeconds: 120\n- effect: NoExecute\nkey: node.kubernetes.io/not-ready\noperator: Exists\ntolerationSeconds: 120\n- effect: NoSchedule\nkey: node.cloudprovider.kubernetes.io/uninitialized\noperator: Exists\n- effect: NoSchedule\nkey: node.kubernetes.io/not-ready\noperator: Exists\n</code></pre><p>When deciding how to deploy your cloud controller manager it is worth noting that\ncluster-proportional, or resource-based, pod autoscaling is not recommended. Running multiple\nreplicas of a cloud controller manager is good practice for ensuring high-availability and\nredundancy, but does not contribute to better performance. In general, only a single instance\nof a cloud controller manager will be reconciling a cluster at any given time.</p>","contentLength":11247,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Kubernetes History Inspector, with Kakeru Ishii","url":"http://sites.libsyn.com/419861/kubernetes-history-inspector-with-kakeru-ishii","date":1739445780,"author":"gdevs.podcast@gmail.com (gdevs.podcast@gmail.com)","guid":339,"unread":true,"content":"<p dir=\"ltr\">Kakeru is the initiator of the Kubernetes History Inspector or KHI.
