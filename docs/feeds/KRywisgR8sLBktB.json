Traditionally, Chrome’s performance panel is excellent for detailed function call analysis, while Angular DevTools offers a higher-level view based on framework concepts like components, lifecycle hooks, bindings etc. Unfortunately, having two separate tools leads to a fragmented understanding of performance.</p><p>This fragmentation presented a significant opportunity to improve the developer experience when profiling Angular applications. As a result, the Angular and Chrome teams have partnered to bring Angular-specific data and insights directly into the Chrome DevTools performance panel, creating a unified profiling experience. <strong>We’re excited to introduce the new custom track for Angular in Chrome DevTools.</strong></p><p>This integration allows developers to combine the benefits of both tools, offering a more synchronized and comprehensive view of their application’s performance.</p><h3>Getting to Know the New Custom&nbsp;Track</h3><p>With this new integration, you’ll find performance data using Angular concepts, such as application bootstrap, components, UI synchronization, and lifecycle hooks:</p><p>The custom track’s flame charts group function invocations together under corresponding components and other Angular concepts. You can drill down to individual functions for a more granular view when needed and still glean meaning from the groupings in other scenarios</p><p>One of the most significant benefits is the ability to distinguish between your application’s code, other scripts, or browser activities like layout and&nbsp;paint.</p><h3>Decoding the Colors: What Your Code is&nbsp;Doing</h3><p>The flame chart entries are color coded to help you quickly identify what’s happening in your application.</p><ul><li>: These represent Dependency Injection (DI) services instantiated during the application bootstrap process. In general, green signifies the execution of code written by application developers.</li></ul><ul><li>: This color is reserved for templates compiled by Angular. Even though it’s still your code, it has been transformed by Angular before execution in the browser. This allows you to clearly see which templates are creating or updating the DOM and how long these operations take.</li></ul><ul><li>: These mark the entry points. At the very top, you’ll see the trigger — why Angular decided to run application code. Subsequent blue bars represent all the components that need to perform work, which is particularly useful for understanding how user interactions impact DOM updates. Below component names, you’ll find the familiar purple (templates) and green (your component code).</li></ul><p>Since the custom track is interactive, clicking on an entry in the flame chart reveals more detailed information about a given entry. This data empowers developers to dive deeper into specific function calls and understand their impact on the application’s performance.</p><p>Enabling this powerful new feature is straightforward. Complete the following steps:</p><ol><li>Ensure you are using the latest version of Angular (v20 at the time of this post) and an up-to-date version of the Google Chrome&nbsp;browser.</li><li>Run your Angular application in developer mode.</li><li>With your application running, open Chrome DevTools and enable the custom track by typing ng.enableProfiling() in the&nbsp;console.</li><li>Once enabled, start recording a performance profile. The dedicated “Angular” track in the flame chart will be available.</li></ol><h3>More Performant Apps are on the&nbsp;Way</h3><p>This new integration with Chrome DevTools demonstrates our ongoing commitment to improving the developer experience within the Angular ecosystem. By providing tools that offer more focused and actionable insights, the Angular and Chrome teams are empowering developers to build faster, more efficient applications. Please try out this new integration and let us know what you&nbsp;think.</p><img src=\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=0f9d8d36218a\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" alt=\"\">","contentLength":3891,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"This Week In React #241: Remix, Next.js, Turbopack, Radix DOM templating, Ultracite, Stack, StyleX, MUI | Nitro Week, Skia, App Generator, Swift, Kotlin | ES2025, Rspack, Babel, TypeScript, Effect, Deno, Three.js","url":"https://thisweekinreact.com/newsletter/241","date":1751414400,"author":"","guid":180905,"unread":true,"content":"<p>It's been a hot C° week here, but pretty calm in terms of React news.

But, I also said that  the gap areas was much harder, and I shared a workaround.</p><p>However, workarounds like using extra HTML elements, pseudo-elements, or borders to draw separator lines tend to come with drawbacks, especially those that impact your layout size, interfere with assistive technologies, or pollute your markup with style-only elements.</p><p>Today, I’m writing again about layout gaps, but this time, to tell you all about a new and exciting CSS feature that’s going to change it all. <strong>What you previously had to use workarounds for, you’ll soon be able to do with just a few simple CSS properties that make it easy, yet also flexible, to display styled separators between your layout items.</strong></p><p>There’s already a <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/TR/css-gaps-1/\" rel=\"noopener\">specification draft for the feature</a> you can peruse. At the time I’m writing this, it is available in Chrome and Edge 139 behind a flag. But I believe it won’t be long before we turn that flag on. I believe other browsers are also very receptive and engaged.</p><p>Displaying decorative lines between items of a layout can make a big difference. When used well, these lines can bring more structure to your layout, and give your users more of a sense of how the different regions of a page are organized.</p><h3>Introducing CSS gap decorations</h3><p>If you’ve ever used a multi-column layout, such as by using the  property, then you might already be familiar with gap decorations. You can draw vertical lines between the columns of a multi-column layout by using the  property:</p><pre rel=\"CSS\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\">article {\n  column-width: 20rem;\n  column-rule: 1px solid black;\n}</code></pre><p>The CSS gap decorations feature builds on this to provide a more comprehensive system that makes it easy for you to draw separator lines in other layout types.</p><p>For example, the draft specification says that the  property also works in flexbox and grid layouts:</p><pre rel=\"CSS\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\">.my-grid-container {\n  display: grid;\n  gap: 2px;\n  column-rule: 2px solid pink;\n}</code></pre><p>No need for extra elements or borders! The key benefit here is that the decoration happens in CSS only, where it belongs, with no impacts to your semantic markup.</p><p>The CSS gap decorations feature also introduces a new  property for drawing lines between rows:</p><pre rel=\"CSS\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\">.my-flex-container {\n  display: flex;\n  gap: 10px;\n  row-rule: 10px dotted limegreen;\n  column-rule: 5px dashed coral;\n}</code></pre><p>But that’s not all, because the above syntax also allows you to define multiple, comma-separated, line style values, and use the same  function that CSS grid already uses for row and column templates. This makes it possible to define different styles of line decorations in a single layout, and adapt to an unknown number of gaps:</p><pre rel=\"CSS\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\">.my-container {\n  display: grid;\n  gap: 2px;\n  row-rule:\n    repeat(2, 1px dashed red),\n    2px solid black,\n    repeat(auto, 1px dotted green);\n}</code></pre><p>Finally, the CSS gap decorations feature comes with additional CSS properties such as , , , , and , which make it possible to precisely customize the way the separators are drawn, whether they overlap, or where they start and end.</p><p>Currently, the CSS gap decorations feature is only available in Chromium-based browsers.</p><p>The feature is still early in the making, and there’s time for you all to try it and to provide feedback that could help make the feature better and more adapted to your needs.</p><p>If you want to try the feature today, make sure to use Edge or Chrome, starting with version 139 (or another Chromium-based browser that matches those versions), and enable the flag by following these steps:</p><ol><li>In Chrome or Edge, go to .</li><li>In the search field, search for <strong>Enable Experimental Web Platform Features</strong>.</li></ol><h3>Using CSS gap decorations</h3><p>Let’s build a simple web page to learn how to use the feature. Here is what we’ll be building:</p><p>The above layout contains a header section with a title, a navigation menu with a few links, a main section with a series of short paragraphs of text and photos, and a footer.</p><p>We’ll use the following markup:</p><pre rel=\"HTML\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\">&lt;body&gt;\n&lt;header&gt;\n  &lt;h1&gt;My personal site&lt;/h1&gt;\n&lt;/header&gt;\n&lt;nav&gt;\n  &lt;ul&gt;\n    &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"#\"&gt;Home&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n    &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"#\"&gt;Blog&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n    &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"#\"&gt;About&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n    &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"#\"&gt;Links&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n  &lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;/nav&gt;\n&lt;main&gt;\n  &lt;article&gt;\n    &lt;p&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;/article&gt;\n  &lt;article&gt;\n    &lt;img src=\"cat.jpg\" alt=\"A sleeping cat.\"&gt;\n  &lt;/article&gt;\n  &lt;article&gt;\n    &lt;p&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;/article&gt;\n  &lt;article&gt;\n    &lt;img src=\"tree.jpg\" alt=\"An old olive tree trunk.\"&gt;\n  &lt;/article&gt;\n  &lt;article&gt;\n    &lt;p&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;/article&gt;\n  &lt;article&gt;\n    &lt;p&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;/article&gt;\n  &lt;article&gt;\n    &lt;p&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;/article&gt;\n  &lt;article&gt;\n    &lt;img src=\"strings.jpg\" alt=\"Snow flakes falling in a motion blur effect.\"&gt;\n  &lt;/article&gt;\n&lt;/main&gt;\n&lt;footer&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;© 2025 Patrick Brosset&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/footer&gt;\n&lt;/body&gt;</code></pre><p>We’ll start by making the  element be a grid container. This way, we can space out the , , , and  elements apart in one go by using the  property:</p><pre rel=\"CSS\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\">body {\n  display: grid;\n  gap: 4rem;\n  margin: 2rem;\n}</code></pre><p>Let’s now use the CSS gap decorations feature to display horizontal separator lines within the gaps we just defined:</p><pre rel=\"CSS\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\">body {\n  display: grid;\n  gap: 4rem;\n  margin: 2rem;\n \n  row-rule: 1rem solid #efefef;\n}</code></pre><p>This gives us the following result:</p><p>We can do a bit better by making the first horizontal line look different than the other two lines, and simplify the  value by using the  syntax:</p><pre rel=\"CSS\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\">body {\n  display: grid;\n  gap: 4rem;\n  margin: 2rem;\n \n  row-rule:\n    1rem solid #efefef,\n    repeat(2, 2px solid #efefef);\n}</code></pre><p>With this new  property value, we’re telling the browser to draw the first horizontal separator as a  thick line, and the next two separators as  thick lines, which gives the following result:</p><p>Now, let’s turn our attention to the navigation element and its list of links. We’ll use flexbox to display the links in a single row, where each link is separated from the other links by a gap and a vertical line:</p><pre rel=\"CSS\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\">nav ul {\n  display: flex;\n  flex-wrap: wrap;\n  gap: 2rem;\n  column-rule: 2px dashed #666;\n}</code></pre><p>Very similarly to how we used the  property before, we’re now using the  property to display a dashed  thick separator between the links.</p><p>Our example web page now looks like this:</p><p>The last thing we need to change is the  element and its paragraphs and pictures. We’ll use flexbox again and display the various children in a wrapping row of varying width items:</p><pre rel=\"CSS\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\">main {\n  display: flex;\n  flex-wrap: wrap;\n  gap: 4rem;\n}\n\n\nmain &gt; * {\n  flex: 1 1 200px;\n}\n\n\nmain article:has(p) {\n  flex-basis: 400px;\n}</code></pre><p>In the above code snippet, we’re setting the  element to be a wrapping flex container with a  gap between items and flex lines. We’re also making the items have a flex basis size of  for pictures and  for text, and allowing them to grow and shrink as needed. This gives us the following result:</p><p>Let’s use CSS gap decorations to bring a little more structure to our layout by drawing  thick separator lines between the rows and columns of the layout:</p><pre rel=\"CSS\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\">main {\n  display: flex;\n  flex-wrap: wrap;\n  gap: 4rem;\n  row-rule: 2px solid #999;\n  column-rule: 2px solid #999;\n}</code></pre><p>This gives us the following result, which is very close to our expected design:</p><p>The last detail we want to change is related to the vertical lines. We don’t want them to span across the entire height of the flex lines but instead start and stop where the content starts and stops.</p><p>With CSS gap decorations, we can easily achieve this by using the  property to fine-tune exactly where the decorations start and end, relative to the gap area:</p><pre rel=\"CSS\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\">main {\n  display: flex;\n  flex-wrap: wrap;\n  gap: 4rem;\n  row-rule: 2px solid #999;\n  column-rule: 2px solid #999;\n  column-rule-outset: 0;\n}</code></pre><p>The  property above makes the vertical column separators span the height of each row, excluding the gap area, which is what we want:</p><p>There’s more to the feature and I mentioned a couple more CSS properties earlier</p><ul><li>, which lets you control which of the decorations, rows or columns, appear above the other ones.</li><li> / , which sets the behavior of the decoration lines at intersections. In particular, whether they are made of multiple segments, which start and end at intersections, or single, continuous lines.</li></ul><p>Because the feature is new, there isn’t MDN documentation about it yet. So to learn more, check out:</p><p>The Edge team has also created an <a href=\"https://microsoftedge.github.io/Demos/css-gap-decorations/playground.html\" rel=\"noopener\">interactive playground</a> where you can use visual controls to configure gap decorations.</p><p>And, of course, the reason this is all implemented behind a flag is to elicit feedback from developers like you! If you have any feedback, questions, or bugs about this feature, I definitely encourage you to open a new ticket on the <a href=\"https://issues.chromium.org/issues/new?template_issue=422768750&amp;component=1456721\" rel=\"noopener\">Chromium issue tracker</a>.</p>","contentLength":8779,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Using CSS Cascade Layers With Tailwind Utilities","url":"https://css-tricks.com/using-css-cascade-layers-with-tailwind-utilities/","date":1751289403,"author":"Zell Liew","guid":176652,"unread":true,"content":"<p>Adam Wathan has (very cleverly) built Tailwind with <a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/css-cascade-layers/\">CSS Cascade Layers</a>, making it extremely powerful for organizing styles by priority.</p><pre rel=\"CSS\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\">@layer theme, base, components, utilities;\n@import 'tailwindcss/theme.css' layer(theme);\n@import 'tailwindcss/utilities.css' layer(utilities);</code></pre><p>The core of Tailwind are its utilities. This means you have two choices:</p><ol></ol><p>The default choice is to follow Tailwind’s recommended layer order: place components first, and Tailwind utilities last.</p><p>So, if you’re building components, you need to manually wrap your components with a  directive. Then, overwrite your component styles with Tailwind, putting Tailwind as the “most important layer”.</p><pre rel=\"CSS\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\">/* Write your components */\n@layer components {\n  .component {\n    /* Your CSS here */\n  }\n}</code></pre><pre rel=\"HTML\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\">&lt;!-- Override with Tailwind utilities --&gt; \n&lt;div class=\"component p-4\"&gt; ... &lt;/div&gt;</code></pre><p>That’s a decent way of doing things.</p><p>But, being the bad boy I am, I don’t take the default approach as the “best” one. Over a year of (major) experimentation with Tailwind and vanilla CSS, I’ve come across what I believe is a better solution.</p><p>Before we go on, I have to tell you that I’m writing a course called <a href=\"https://magicaldevschool.com/courses/unorthodox-tailwind/\" rel=\"noopener\">Unorthodox Tailwind</a> — this shows you everything I know about using Tailwind and CSS in synergistic ways, leveraging the strengths of each.</p><p>Shameless plug aside, let’s dive into the Unorthodox Choice now.</p><p>In this case, the Unorthodox Choice is to write your styles in an unnamed layer — or any layer after utilities, really — so that your CSS naturally overwrites Tailwind utilities.</p><p>Of these two, I prefer the unnamed layer option:</p><pre rel=\"CSS\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\">/* Unnamed layer option */\n@layer theme, base, components, utilities; \n\n/* Write your CSS normally here */ \n.component { /* ... */ }</code></pre><pre rel=\"CSS\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\">/* Named layer option */\n/* Use whatever layer name you come up with. I simply used css here because it made most sense for explaining things */\n@layer theme, base, components, utilities, css; \n\n@layer css {\n  .component { /* ... */ }\n}</code></pre><p>I have many reasons why I do this:</p><ol><li>I don’t like to add unnecessary CSS layers because it makes code harder to write — more keystrokes, having to remember the specific layer I used it in, etc.</li><li>I’m pretty skilled with <a href=\"https://itcss.io\" rel=\"noopener\">ITCSS</a>, selector specificity, and all the good-old-stuff you’d expect from a seasoned front-end developer, so writing CSS in a single layer doesn’t scare me at all.</li><li>I can do complex stuff that are hard or impossible to do in Tailwind (like theming and animations) in CSS.</li></ol><p>Your mileage may vary, of course.</p><p>Now, if you have followed my reasoning so far, you would have noticed that I use Tailwind  differently:</p><ul><li>Tailwind utilities are not the “most important” layer.</li><li>My unnamed CSS layer is the most important one.</li></ul><ul><li><strong>Build prototypes with Tailwind</strong> (quickly, easily, especially with the <a href=\"https://splendidlabz/docs/layouts/\">tools</a> I’ve created).</li><li><strong>Shift these properties to CSS</strong> when they get more complex — so I don’t have to read messy utility-littered HTML that makes my heart sink. Not because utility HTML is bad, but because it takes lots of brain processing power to figure out what’s happening.</li></ul><p>Finally, here’s the nice thing about Tailwind being in a utility layer: I can always  a utility to give it strength.</p><pre rel=\"HTML\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\">&lt;!-- !important the padding utility --&gt;\n&lt;div class=\"component !p-4\"&gt; ... &lt;/div&gt;</code></pre><p>Whoa, hold on, wait a minute! Isn’t this wrong, you might ask?</p><p>Nope. The  keyword has traditionally been used to override classes. In this case, we’re leveraging on the <a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/css-cascade-layers/#important-origins-context-and-layers-are-reversed\"> feature in CSS Layers</a> to say the Tailwind utility is more important than any CSS in the unnamed layer.</p><p>This is perfectly valid and is a built-in feature for CSS Layers.</p><p>Besides, the  is so explicit (and used so little) that it makes sense for one-off quick-and-dirty adjustments (without creating a brand new selector for it).</p><h3>Tailwind utilities are more powerful than they seem</h3><p>Tailwind utilities are not a 1:1 map between a class and a CSS property. Built-in Tailwind utilities mostly look like this so it can give people a wrong impression.</p><p>Tailwind utilities are more like <a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/tailwinds-apply-feature-is-better-than-it-sounds/\">convenient Sass mixins</a>, which means we can build effective tools for <a href=\"https://splendidlabz/docs/layouts/\">layouts</a>, theming, typography, and more, through them.</p><p>Thanks for reading and I hope you’re enjoying a new way of looking at (or using) Tailwind!</p>","contentLength":4212,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null}],"tags":["frontend"]}
