Miguel Ojeda therefore launched a survey among kernel developers, including those outside the Rust community, and presented some of the more important voices in his FOSDEM talk. The overall mood towards Rust remains favorable, especially as Linus Torvalds and Greg Kroah-Hartman are convinced of the necessity of Rust integration. This is less about rapid progress and more about finding new talent for kernel development in the future. \nThe reaction was mostly positive, judging by Ojeda's slides: \n\n- \"2025 will be the year of Rust GPU drivers...\" — Daniel Almedia \n\n- \"I think the introduction of Rust in the kernel is one of the most exciting development experiments we've seen in a long time.\" — Andrea Righi\n\n - \"[T]he project faces unique challenges. Rust's biggest weakness, as a language, is that relatively few people speak it. Indeed, Rust is not a language for beginners, and systems-level development complicates things even more. That said, the Linux kernel project has historically attracted developers who love challenging software — if there's an open source group willing to put the extra effort for a better OS, it's the kernel devs.\" — Carlos Bilbao \n\n- \"I played a little with [Rust] in user space, and I just absolutely hate the cargo concept... I hate having to pull down other code that I do not trust. At least with shared libraries, I can trust a third party to have done the build and all that... [While Rust should continue to grow in the kernel], if a subset of C becomes as safe as Rust, it may make Rust obsolete...\" Steven Rostedt \n\nRostedt wasn't sure if Rust would attract more kernel contributors, but did venture this opinion. \"I feel Rust is more of a language that younger developers want to learn, and C is their dad's language.\" \n\nBut still \"contention exists within the kernel development community between those pro-Rust and -C camps,\" argues The New Stack, citing the latest remarks from kernel maintainer Christoph Hellwig (who had earlier likened the mixing of Rust and C to cancer). Three days later Hellwig reiterated his position again on the Linux kernel mailing list:\n\n\"Every additional bit that another language creeps in drastically reduces the maintainability of the kernel as an integrated project. The only reason Linux managed to survive so long is by not having internal boundaries, and adding another language completely breaks this. You might not like my answer, but I will do everything I can do to stop this. This is NOT because I hate Rust. While not my favourite language it's definitively one of the best new ones and I encourage people to use it for new projects where it fits. I do not want it anywhere near a huge C code base that I need to maintain.\" \n\nBut the article also notes that Google \"has been a staunch supporter of adding Rust to the kernel for Linux running in its Android phones.\"\nThe use of Rust in the kernel is seen as a way to avoid memory vulnerabilities associated with C and C++ code and to add more stability to the Android OS. \"Google's wanting to replace C code with Rust represents a small piece of the kernel but it would have a huge impact since we are talking about billions of phones,\" Ojeda told me after his talk. \n\nIn addition to Google, Rust adoption and enthusiasm for it is increasing as Rust gets more architectural support and as \"maintainers become more comfortable with it,\" Ojeda told me. \"Maintainers have already told me that if they could, then they would start writing Rust now,\" Ojeda said. \"If they could drop C, they would do it....\" \n\nAmid the controversy, there has been a steady stream of vocal support for Ojeda. Much of his discussion also covered statements given by advocates for Rust in the kernel, ranging from lead developers of the kernel and including Linux creator Linus Torvalds himself to technology leads from Red Hat, Samsung, Google, Microsoft and others.","contentLength":4153,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Asahi Linux Lead Developer Hector Martin Resigns From Linux Kernel","url":"https://linux.slashdot.org/story/25/02/07/1332241/asahi-linux-lead-developer-hector-martin-resigns-from-linux-kernel?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&utm_medium=feed","date":1738939200,"author":"msmash","guid":380,"unread":true,"content":"Asahi lead developer Hector Martin, writing in an email: I no longer have any faith left in the kernel development process or community management approach. \n\nApple/ARM platform development will continue downstream.

(Weston is a reference implementation of a Wayland compositor, a modern display server protocol.)\n \nWe also went ahead and enabled hardware acceleration beforehand as well as installed Chocolate Doom, a source port of Doom, to see if it would run. Doom did run, as you can see below. It ran well, which is no surprise considering Doom can run on literal potatoes. There wasn't any audio because an audio server isn't available yet, but audio support is something that Google is still working on.","contentLength":1666,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Organize a community meetup in your area","url":"http://www.fsf.org/blogs/community/organize-a-community-meetup-in-your-area","date":1738252500,"author":"","guid":211,"unread":true,"content":"<article>Let's claim the month of May as LibreLocal month!</article>","contentLength":49,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Facebook Flags Linux Topics As 'Cybersecurity Threats'","url":"https://linux.slashdot.org/story/25/01/27/2120230/facebook-flags-linux-topics-as-cybersecurity-threats?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&utm_medium=feed","date":1738018800,"author":"BeauHD","guid":373,"unread":true,"content":"Facebook has banned posts mentioning Linux-related topics, with the popular Linux news and discussion site, DistroWatch, at the center of the controversy. Tom's Hardware reports: A post on the site claims, \"Facebook's internal policy makers decided that Linux is malware and labeled groups associated with Linux as being 'cybersecurity threats.' We tried to post some blurb about distrowatch.com on Facebook and can confirm that it was barred with a message citing Community Standards. DistroWatch says that the Facebook ban took effect on January 19. Readers have reported difficulty posting links to the site on this social media platform. Moreover, some have told DistroWatch that their Facebook accounts have been locked or limited after sharing posts mentioning Linux topics.\n \nIf you're wondering if there might be something specific to DistroWatch.com, something on the site that the owners/operators perhaps don't even know about, for example, then it seems pretty safe to rule out such a possibility. Reports show that \"multiple groups associated with Linux and Linux discussions have either been shut down or had many of their posts removed.\" However, we tested a few other Facebook posts with mentions of Linux, and they didn't get blocked immediately. Copenhagen-hosted DistroWatch says it has tried to appeal against the Community Standards-triggered ban. However, they say that a Facebook representative said that Linux topics would remain on the cybersecurity filter. The DistroWatch writer subsequently got their Facebook account locked... DistroWatch points out the irony at play here: \"Facebook runs much of its infrastructure on Linux and often posts job ads looking for Linux developers.\" \n\nUPDATE: Facebook has admited they made a mistake and stopped blocking the posts.","contentLength":1791,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Linux 6.14 Brings Some Systems Faster Suspend and Resume","url":"https://linux.slashdot.org/story/25/01/25/2343225/linux-614-brings-some-systems-faster-suspend-and-resume?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&utm_medium=feed","date":1737909240,"author":"EditorDavid","guid":372,"unread":true,"content":"Amid the ongoing Linux 6.14 kernel development cycle, Phoronix spotted a pull request for ACPI updates which \"will allow for faster suspend and resume cycles on some systems.\" \n\nWikipedia defines ACPI as \"an open standard that operating systems can use to discover and configure computer hardware components\" for things like power management and putting unused hardware components to sleep. Phoronix reports:\n\nThe ACPI change worth highlighting for Linux 6.14 is switching from msleep() to usleep_range() within the acpi_os_sleep() call in the kernel. This reduces spurious sleep time due to timer inaccuracy. Linux ACPI/PM maintainer Rafael Wysocki of Intel who authored this change noted that it could \"spectacularly\" reduce the duration of system suspend and resume transitions on some systems... \n\nRafael explained in the patch making the sleep change: \n\n \"The extra delay added by msleep() to the sleep time value passed to it can be significant, roughly between 1.5 ns on systems with HZ = 1000 and as much as 15 ms on systems with HZ = 100, which is hardly acceptable, at least for small sleep time values.\" \nOne 2022 bug report complained a Dell XPS 13 using Thunderbolt took \"a full 8 seconds to suspend and a full 8 seconds to resume even though no physical devices are connected.\" In November an Intel engineer posted on the kernel mailing list that the fix gave a Dell XPS 13 a 42% improvement in kernel resume time (from 1943ms to 1127ms).","contentLength":1452,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Could New Linux Code Cut Data Center Energy Use By 30%?","url":"https://hardware.slashdot.org/story/25/01/25/2111225/could-new-linux-code-cut-data-center-energy-use-by-30?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&utm_medium=feed","date":1737848040,"author":"EditorDavid","guid":371,"unread":true,"content":"Two computer scientists at the University of Waterloo in Canada believe changing 30 lines of code in Linux \"could cut energy use at some data centers by up to 30 percent,\" according to the site Data Centre Dynamics. \n\nIt's the code that processes packets of network traffic, and Linux \"is the most widely used OS for data center servers,\" according to the article:\n\nThe team tested their solution's effectiveness and submitted it to Linux for consideration, and the code was published this month as part of Linux's newest kernel, release version 6.13. \"All these big companies — Amazon, Google, Meta — use Linux in some capacity, but they're very picky about how they decide to use it,\" said Martin Karsten [professor of Computer Science in the Waterloo's Math Faculty]. \"If they choose to 'switch on' our method in their data centers, it could save gigawatt hours of energy worldwide.

But in addition to the LEGO builds, this year I also ended up doing a number of guitar pedal kit builds (\"LEGO for grown-ups with a soldering iron\").
