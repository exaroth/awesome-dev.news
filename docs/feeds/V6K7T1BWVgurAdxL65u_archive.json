GamingOnLinux reports: For some context here: originally, Proton had an option to enable / disable it globally. That was removed with the Game Recording update last year. That made sense, because people kept somehow turning it entirely off and now it's required by Steam. Currently, there's still an option in the stable Steam Client that you need to manually check to enable Steam Play (Proton) for \"all other titles\". This is something of a leftover from when Proton was initially revealed, and only worked for a specific set of games on Valve's whitelist. It now covers what Valve set by default for Steam Deck and SteamOS verification.\n \nWhat's changed is that at some point in the recent Steam Beta releases, is that \"for all other titles\" option is gone. I've scrolled back through changelogs and not seen it mentioned. So now, Proton is just enabled properly in full by default in the Steam Beta like shown in the [image here]. This is a good (and needed) change that I'm happy to see. There's often confusion when people try to run Windows games on Linux and end up with no install button because Proton isn't turned on for all titles. [This] will soon be a thing of the past. To be clear, this is not setting Proton on every game by default, it does not override Native Linux games. It's just making Proton available by default.","contentLength":1519,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"From Chennai to Lviv: A recap of the LibreLocal meetups, part two","url":"http://www.fsf.org/blogs/community/librelocal-meetups-recap-part-2","date":1750263713,"author":"","guid":161336,"unread":true,"content":"","contentLength":0,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Transition to the new WoW64 wine and wine-staging","url":"https://archlinux.org/news/transition-to-the-new-wow64-wine-and-wine-staging/","date":1750090921,"author":"Peter Jung","guid":157462,"unread":true,"content":"<p>We are transitioning the wine and wine-staging package to a pure <a href=\"https://gitlab.winehq.org/wine/wine/-/releases/wine-9.0#wow64\">wow64</a> build.

Balancing that, this version only supports the Raspberry Pi 4 and 5 series; it drops Rocky 9.x's support for the older Pi 3 and Pi Zero models... \n\nRHEL 10 itself, and Rocky with it, now require x86-64-v3, meaning Intel \"Haswell\" generation kit from about 2013 onward. Uniquely among the RHELatives, AlmaLinux offers a separate build of version 10 for x86-64-v2 as well, meaning Intel \"Nehalem\" and later — chips from roughly 2008 onward. AlmaLinux has a history of still supporting hardware that's been dropped from RHEL and Rocky, which it's been doing since AlmaLinux 9.4. Now that includes CPUs. In comparison, the system requirements for Rocky Linux 10 are the same as for RHEL 10. The release notes say.... \"The most significant change in Rocky Linux 10 is the removal of support for x86-64-v2 architectures. AMD and Intel 64-bit architectures for x86-64-v3 are now required.\" \n\nA significant element of the advertising around RHEL 10 involves how it has an AI assistant. This is called Red Hat Enterprise Linux Lightspeed, and you can use it right from a shell prompt, as the documentation describes... It's much easier than searching man pages, especially if you don't know what to look for... [N]either AlmaLinux 10 nor Rocky Linux 10 includes the option of a helper bot. No big surprise there...\n[Rocky Linux] is sticking closest to upstream, thanks to a clever loophole to obtain source RPMs. Its hardware requirements also closely parallel RHEL 10, and CIQ is working on certifications, compliance, and special editions. Meanwhile, AlmaLinux is maintaining support for older hardware and CPUs, which will widen its appeal, and working with partners to ensure reboot-free updates and patching, rather than CIQ's keep-it-in-house approach. All are valid, and all three still look and work almost identically... except for the LLM bot assistant.","contentLength":2148,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null}],"tags":["linux"]}
