Purism chose it as the docking station for their Librem 5 phones. \n\nBut now Nex is offering its own smartphone \"that runs Android 16, launches Debian, and dual-boots into Windows 11,\" according to the blog It's FOSS:\n\n\nFourteen years after the first concept video was teased, the NexPhone is here, powered by a Qualcomm QCM6490, which, the keen-eyed among you will remember from the now-discontinued Fairphone 5. \n\nBy 2026 standards, it's dated hardware, but Nex Computer doesn't seem to be overselling it, as they expect the NexPhone to be a secondary or backup phone, not a flagship contender. The phone includes an Adreno 643 GPU, 12GB of RAM, and 256GB of internal storage that can be expanded up to 512GB via a microSD card. \n\nIn terms of software, the NexPhone boots into NexOS, a bloatware-free and minimal Android 16 system, with Debian running as an app with GPU acceleration, and Windows 11 being the dual-boot option that requires a restart to access. [\"And because the default Windows interface isn't designed for a handheld screen, we built our own Mobile UI from the ground up to make Windows far easier to navigate on a phone,\" notes a blog post from Nex founder/CEO Emre Kosmaz]. \n\nAnd, before I forget, you can plug the NexPhone into a USB-C or HDMI display, add a keyboard and mouse to transform it into a desktop workstation. \nThere's a camera plus \"a comprehensive suite of sensors,\" according to the article, \"that includes a fingerprint scanner, accelerometer, magnetometer, gyroscope, ambient light sensor, and proximity sensor.... \n\n\"NexPhone is slated for a Q3 2026 release (July-September)...\" \n\nBack in 2012, explains Nex founder/CEO Emre Kosmaz, \"most investors weren't excited about funding new hardware. One VC even told us, 'I don't understand why anyone buys anything other than Apple'...\"\n\n\nOver the last decade, we kept building and shipping — six generations of NexDock — helping customers turn phones into laptop-like setups (display + keyboard + trackpad). And now the industry is catching up faster than ever. With Android 16, desktop-style experiences are becoming more native and more mainstream. That momentum is exactly why NexPhone makes sense today... \n\nThank you for being part of this journey. With your support, I hope NexPhone can help move us toward a world where phones truly replace laptops and PCs — more often, more naturally, and for more people.","contentLength":2492,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Former Canonical Developer Advocate Warns Snap Store Isn't Safe After Slow Responses to Malware Reports","url":"https://linux.slashdot.org/story/26/01/24/2332205/former-canonical-developer-advocate-warns-snap-store-isnt-safe-after-slow-responses-to-malware-reports?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&utm_medium=feed","date":1769330640,"author":"EditorDavid","guid":420279,"unread":true,"content":"An anonymous reader shared this article from the blog Linuxiac\nIn a blog post, Alan Pope, a longtime Ubuntu community figure and former Canonical employee who remains an active Snap publisher... [warns of] a persistent campaign of malicious snaps impersonating cryptocurrency wallet applications. These fake apps typically mimic well-known projects such as Exodus, Ledger Live, or Trust Wallet, prompting users to enter wallet recovery phrases, which are then transmitted to attackers, resulting in drained funds. \nThe perpetrators had originally used similar-looking characters from other alphabets to mimic other app listings, then began uploading \"revisions\" to other innocuous-seeming (approved) apps that would transform their original listing into that of a fake crypto wallet app. \n\nBut now they're re-registering expired domains to take over existing Snap Store accounts, which Pope calls \"a significant escalation...\"\n\nI worked for Canonical between 2011 and 2021 as an Engineering Manager, Community Manager, and Developer Advocate. I was a strong advocate for snap packages and the Snap Store. While I left the company nearly five years ago, I still maintain nearly 50 packages in the Snap Store, with thousands of users... Personally, I want the Snap Store to be successful, and for users to be confident that the packages they install are trustworthy and safe. \n\n\nCurrently, that confidence isn't warranted, which is a problem for desktop Linux users who install snap packages. I report every bad snap I encounter, and I know other security professionals do the same — even though doing so results in no action for days sometimes... To be clear: none of this should be seen as an attack on the Snap Store, Canonical, or the engineers working on these problems. I'm raising awareness of an issue that exists, because I want it fixed... But pretending there isn't a problem helps nobody.","contentLength":1900,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null}],"tags":["linux"]}
