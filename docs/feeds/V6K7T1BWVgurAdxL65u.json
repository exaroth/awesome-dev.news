In his final resignation announcement from Asahi, Martin wrote: \"I no longer have any faith left in the kernel development process or community management approach.\" \n\nThe dispute reflects deeper tensions in the Linux kernel community, particularly around the integration of Rust code.

Yes, there are other desktop GUIs, such as MATE, and the lightweight Xfce, which are valuable options when low overhead is important, such as in LinuxCNC. However, among the general public lies a great expanse of office workers who need a full-featured Linux desktop.\n \nThe programmers who work on GNOME and its family of supporting applications enrich many other desktops do their more than their share. These faithful developers deserve better user-interface leadership. GNOME has tried to steer itself into tablet waters, which is admirable, but GNOME 3.x diminished the desktop experience for both laptop and desktop users. For instance, the moment you design what should be a graphical user interface with words such as \"Activities,\" you ask people to change horses midstream. That is not to say that the command line and GUI cannot coexist -- because they can, as they do in many CAD programs.\n \nI remember a time when GNOME ruled the Linux desktop -- and I can remember when GNOME left those users behind.
