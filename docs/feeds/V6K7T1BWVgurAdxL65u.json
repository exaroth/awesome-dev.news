This isn't creating an inclusive environment. This isn't okay with the current political situation especially in the US. A maintainer speaking those words can't be kept. No matter how important or critical or relevant they are. They need to be removed until they learn. Learn what those words mean for a lot of marginalized people. Learn about what horrors it evokes in their minds.</p><p>I can't in good faith remain to be part of a project and its community where those words are tolerated. Those words are not technical, they are a political statement. Even if unintentionally, such words carry power, they carry meanings one needs to be aware of. They do cause an immense amount of harm.</p><p>I wish the best of luck for everybody to continue to try to work from within.

His departure from Asahi follows a contentious exchange with Linus Torvalds over development processes and social media advocacy. After quitting kernel maintenance earlier this month, the conflict escalated when Martin suggested that \"shaming on social media\" might be necessary to effect change. \n\nTorvalds sharply rejected this approach, stating that \"social media brigading just makes me not want to have anything at all to do with your approach\" and suggested that Martin himself might be the problem. In his final resignation announcement from Asahi, Martin wrote: \"I no longer have any faith left in the kernel development process or community management approach.\" \n\nThe dispute reflects deeper tensions in the Linux kernel community, particularly around the integration of Rust code. It follows the August departure of another key Rust for Linux maintainer, Wedson Almeida Filho from Microsoft. According to Sonatype's research, more than 300,000 open source projects have slowed or halted updates since 2020.","contentLength":1172,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Is It Time For a Change In GNOME Leadership?","url":"https://tech.slashdot.org/story/25/02/13/0150244/is-it-time-for-a-change-in-gnome-leadership?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&utm_medium=feed","date":1739451600,"author":"BeauHD","guid":192,"unread":true,"content":"Longtime Slashdot reader BrendaEM writes: Command-line aside, Cinnamon is the most effective keeper of the Linux desktop flame -- by not abandoning desktop and laptop computers. Yes, there are other desktop GUIs, such as MATE, and the lightweight Xfce, which are valuable options when low overhead is important, such as in LinuxCNC. However, among the general public lies a great expanse of office workers who need a full-featured Linux desktop.\n \nThe programmers who work on GNOME and its family of supporting applications enrich many other desktops do their more than their share. These faithful developers deserve better user-interface leadership. GNOME has tried to steer itself into tablet waters, which is admirable, but GNOME 3.x diminished the desktop experience for both laptop and desktop users. For instance, the moment you design what should be a graphical user interface with words such as \"Activities,\" you ask people to change horses midstream. That is not to say that the command line and GUI cannot coexist -- because they can, as they do in many CAD programs.\n \nI remember a time when GNOME ruled the Linux desktop -- and I can remember when GNOME left those users behind. Perhaps in a future, GNOME could return to the Linux desktop and join forces with Cinnamon -- so that we may once again have the year of the Linux desktop.","contentLength":1346,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"FSF talked about education, copyright management, and free machine learning at FOSDEM 2025","url":"http://www.fsf.org/blogs/licensing/fsf-at-fosdem-2025","date":1739302200,"author":"","guid":134,"unread":true,"content":"<article>Four FSF staff members had a great time sharing their knowledge and learning at FOSDEM 2025 in Brussels. </article>","contentLength":105,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"I ♥ Free Software Day 2025: Let's celebrate the people who make and maintain free software","url":"http://www.fsf.org/blogs/community/i-love-free-software-2025","date":1739225400,"author":"","guid":133,"unread":true,"content":"<article>Let's celebrate the people behind free software and tell them how much we appreciate their work! </article>","contentLength":97,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null}],"tags":["linux"]}
