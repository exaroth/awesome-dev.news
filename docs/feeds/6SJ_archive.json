This  simplifies the process of managing tools, such as linters or generators that are widely used in many Go\nprojects but are not directly used in the codebase. In this blog post, we will explore what the  directive is, why\nit matters, and how to use it effectively.</p><p>The  directive allows Gophers to specify dependencies for tools used in your Go project without adding those tools as\nregular dependencies. This is particularly useful for tools like , , or other command-line\nutilities that support your development workflow but don’t appear in your import graph.</p><p>Previously, developers had to manage such tools using workarounds, such as adding them to a  or a <a href=\"https://github.com/MatthewJamesBoyle/catserver/blob/master/gen.go#L3\"></a> file or manually\ninstalling them outside of Go modules. The  directive removes this friction by providing a dedicated way to\ndeclare these dependencies.</p><p>Using the new  directive offers several benefits:</p><ol><li>: Tools are clearly distinguished from code dependencies, reducing confusion.</li><li>: You can lock specific versions of tools, ensuring consistent behavior across environments.</li><li>: The Go tooling can install and manage tools automatically based on the  directive,\nremoving the need for custom scripts or manual installation.</li></ol><p>Here’s how you can add a tool dependency using the  directive:</p><h3>Step 1: Update Your  File</h3><pre tabindex=\"0\" data-language=\"go\"><code></code></pre><p>In this example <code>github.com/golang/mock/mockgen</code> is the path to the tool.</p><p>This will add a tool directive to your go.mod file.

I get why people think it- software engineers\nhave been trained to lean into open-source tooling, and the AI ecosystem is\nundoubtably strongest in Python.</p><p>But if you don’t already use Python, switching languages for the ecosystem is\nlikely a bad call. Not only is that ecosystem less mature than it seems (who\ngenuinely has enough experience to build an opinionated agent-framework at this\npoint?), but it is grounded more in a research/ML perspective than a product\none.</p><p>Additionally, the language itself is a poor fit for AI products! Python\nconcurrency can be tricky, which is going to hurt you when it comes to\noptimising the latency of your AI systems, and a static type-system can bring\nsome much-needed structure to non-deterministic models.</p><p>At incident.io, we use Go for all our backend, and saw no reason why AI should\nbe any different. Go has been a fantastic choice, helping us <a href=\"https://incident.io/ai\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">build AI\nsystems</a> that spawn concurrent prompts, speculatively execute tools, and instrument\neverything to the hilt.</p><p>Despite Go being known as a no-frills language, we’ve built some really\nergonomic abstractions that make working with AI really easy. I expect you can\ndo it in your native language, too.</p><p>Here’s an example of a prompt in our codebase:</p><div><div><pre><code></code></pre></div></div><p>Each prompt is its own struct, describing which model to use, the input type\nthat we use to template the messages, and finally the prompt that we’ll send to\nOpenAI (or Anthropic, GCP, whatever).</p><p>What I love about this is how much heavy lifting the type system is doing for\nus. Running the prompt is as simple as:</p><div><div><pre><code></code></pre></div></div><p>Behind the scenes,  is doing some cool stuff:</p><ol><li>It reflects over our  type to build an OpenAPI specification, using\nstruct tags like  and  as documentation.</li><li>That specification is used to force the model into giving structured JSON\nresponses that match our type exactly.</li><li>The prompt is templated with our .</li><li>Finally, the response is parsed back into our result type.</li></ol><p>Each prompt lives in its own file () alongside its evaluation\nsuite (), making it easy to maintain and test.</p><p>The pattern above works great for fixed prompts, but sometimes you need more\nflexibility. That’s where Go’s generics come in handy.</p><p>Here’s an example from our incident investigation system:</p><div><div><pre><code></code></pre></div></div><p>We’re using  across our <a href=\"https://incident.io/ai#investigations\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">investigation\nsystem</a>, but each time we run it we want different types of\nresults back. Sometimes we want permalinks to code changes, other times we’re\nextracting timeline entries, or grading the quality of our investigation\nhypothesis.</p><p>Rather than copy-and-pasting the prompt in order to use the same context setup,\nwe can use a generic type parameter to control the result we get back. The\nprompt template and core logic stays the same, but we get different structured\ndata back each time.</p><p>That’s as close as we’ll get to Vercel’s  in Go, and I’d say\nit’s a strong challenger.</p><h2>Python is not the only answer</h2><p>Python is a great tool for machine learning and a lot more. But it has real\nweaknesses when it comes to building production AI systems, especially if you’re\nalready working in a different language.</p><p>I’ve spoken with several teams who switched to Python to work with AI, away from\ntheir normal stack, and they’ve all struggled. They’re trying to learn AI\nalongside new tools and patterns (<a href=\"https://blog.lawrencejones.dev/learn-one-thing/\">almost always a bad idea</a>), which\nmakes it much more likely they burn out or fail.</p><p>Even if they succeed, they’ve disconnected their AI features from their core\nproduct. These are companies aiming to be “AI native” but have their AI features\nliving in a separate codebase with different conventions. That doesn’t feel like\nsuccess to me.</p><p>At incident.io, we kept everything in Go and it’s working really well. Our AI\nfeatures live right alongside our core product, using the same development\npatterns the team already knows. We’ve even managed building some expressive and\nfancy abstractions in a language that is notoriously no-frills, while leveraging\nGo’s strengths in concurrency and type safety.</p><p>The AI ecosystem will continue to be Python-first, and that’s fine! The actual\ninteraction with models is just HTTP requests with JSON payloads, though. Build\ngood abstractions in your language of choice, and focus your energy on the hard\nstuff: <a href=\"https://blog.lawrencejones.dev/ai-mvp/\">making AI features that actually work</a>.</p><p><em>\n        \n        If you liked this post and want to see more, follow me at <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://twitter.com/lawrjones\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">@lawrjones</a>.\n      </em></p>","contentLength":4436,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1iqtugn/writing_llm_prompts_in_go_with_typesafety/"},{"title":"I created a simple TOTP library","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1iqrtfg/i_created_a_simple_totp_library/","date":1739711213,"author":"/u/Strange_Fun_544","guid":647,"unread":true,"content":"<p>I few months ago I created a TOTP library for myself, as I wanted to explore some different things (as I'm mostly developing websites)</p><p>And I've been using it in production for a while so, I think it's time to share it with you.</p><p>While I'm aware that might not be for everybody, I'm sure it will be useful for some of you :) </p><p>That being said, any feedback is welcomed.</p>","contentLength":363,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Wordle Solver","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1iqrh3v/wordle_solver/","date":1739709981,"author":"/u/james-holland","guid":1631,"unread":true,"content":"<p>I built a wordle solver in golang a while ago, I tidied it up recently, documented it, dockerised it and made it public to put it on my CV.</p><p>The word suggester finds the best word by recurrently:</p><ul><li>counting up how common each letter is in the WordList, repeated letters within a word are not counted.</li><li>then finding the word with the highest score based on the count of letters.</li><li>parsing the input and removing all the words that don't correspond to the input.</li></ul><p>Please star on github if you like it.

You might think of Haskell, with its pure functions and monads (don't panic, we'll explain that in detail later), or JavaScript, which loves to showcase its features with higher - order functions and callbacks. But in fact, you can also do functional programming in Go, and the process is far from dull.</p><p>First of all, let's talk about higher - order functions. Higher - order functions can work well with other functions, either taking them as parameters or returning them as values. In the world of Go, implementing higher - order functions is not only possible but also quite ingenious.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>You see, in this example, the  function takes an integer slice and a judgment function , and returns the elements in the slice that meet the judgment conditions. Doesn't it seem a bit like a faster JavaScript?</p><p>Next up is currying. It is the process of breaking down a function that takes multiple arguments into a series of functions, each taking a single argument. Currying is actually not as complicated as it might seem.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>In this example, the  function takes an integer  and returns a new function. This new function takes another integer  and returns the result of . Simple, straightforward, and gets the job done without any frills.</p><p>One of the characteristics of functional programming is immutability. Once something is constructed, it doesn't change. Instead, if you need something different, you build a new one. This might sound wasteful at first, but in fact, it keeps the code clean and reduces side effects.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>In this example, instead of directly modifying the original , we created a new  and modified it.</p><p>Pure functions are like tidy friends. They don't touch or modify anything outside their scope. What you pass in is what you use, and what they return is their only effect.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>In this example, the  function only depends on the passed - in parameter  and doesn't affect any external variables.</p><p>In the simplest terms, functors are anything that can map a function. Think of the humble array, applying a function to each item and getting a new array. In Go, there is no built - in general  function, but we can build one ourselves.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Here, we defined a  function that takes an integer slice and a function and returns a new slice, where each element is the result of processing the original slice element by the function.</p><p>Now, let's talk about endofunctors. It's just a fancy way of saying a functor that maps a type to the same type. Simply put, starting from a Go slice, you end up with a Go slice of the same type. It's not rocket science, just a matter of type consistency.</p><p>Taking the previous  as an example, it's a kind of endofunctor in disguise. It takes  and returns  without type conversion.</p><p>Imagine a party where everyone has to bring a friend. Monoids are like that, but for types. They need two things: an operation that combines two types and a special value, which is like the most likable friend - it gets along with everyone but doesn't change anything about them.</p><p>In Go, you can see this with slices or numbers. Let's take numbers as an example because they're easier to work with:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Here, 0 is our hero, the identity element, which keeps the numbers unchanged.</p><p>\"When someone says, 'A monad is a monoid in the category of endofunctors,' they're basically showing off their computer - science vocabulary.\" To explain in detail: A monad is a programming construct that deals with types and functions in a super - special way - like some people are picky about how their coffee is brewed.</p><p>In the simplest terms, a monoid is about combining things together using a special rule, which includes a useless element or identity element. Now, add endofunctors, which are like ordinary old functions but stick to transforming things within their own little universe (category). Put it all together, and you'll see that a monad can be seen as a way to chain functions together in a sequence, but in a super - self - contained way while also respecting the original structure of the data. It's like saying, \"We're going on a road trip, but we can only take the scenic backroads, and we'll end up back where we started.\"</p><p>Monads are all - rounders. They can not only handle values with context (such as errors or lists) but also chain operations together by passing the context. In Go, it might be a bit difficult to mimic this, but let's take a look at error handling, which is a practical use of monads.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>This makeshift monad can help us handle computations that might go wrong without causing panics and chaos in the code.</p><p>Functional programming in Go might not be the poster child of the functional paradigm, but it's entirely feasible and can even be fun. Who would have thought, right? Now, you should understand that Go can achieve functional programming just like other languages. With a little effort, you can write clean, efficient, and robust code. </p><p>Finally, I'd like to recommend a platform that's perfect for deploying Golang code: </p><h3>\n  \n  \n  1.

Onyango","guid":575,"unread":true,"content":"<p>Have you ever opened a file or webpage and seen something like this?</p><p>That’s an encoding issue, and if you’ve been coding long enough, you’ve probably run into it at some point.</p><p>But why does this happen? Why do some characters get replaced with weird symbols? And most importantly—how do we fix it?</p><p>The answer is UTF-8, the encoding that powers almost everything today. Let's talk about what it is, why it matters, and how to use it properly in Go (Golang).</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  🔥 The Problem UTF-8 Solves\n</h3><p>Back in the early days of computing, ASCII was the standard way to represent text. It used 7 bits per character, meaning it could only represent 128 characters (A-Z, a-z, 0-9, and some symbols).</p><p>That was fine—until computers went global.</p><p>Suddenly, people needed to store and display languages like Chinese (汉字), Arabic (العربية), Hindi (हिन्दी), and more. ASCII just couldn’t handle it.</p><p>So different countries created their own encodings:</p><ul><li><p>ISO-8859-1 for Western Europe</p></li><li><p>Windows-1252 for Microsoft systems</p></li></ul><p>💀 The result? Encoding chaos. A file written in one system might be unreadable in another.</p><p>Enter , the hero of our story.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  🏆 What Makes UTF-8 Special?\n</h3><p>UTF-8 was designed in 1992 by Ken Thompson and Rob Pike (yes, the same Rob Pike who helped create Go!). It solved the encoding mess by being:</p><p>✅ Backwards-compatible with ASCII\n✅ Compact for common characters (English stays at 1 byte per character)<p>\n✅ Capable of encoding every language and symbol</p>\n✅ Error-resistant (invalid bytes won’t accidentally form valid characters)</p><p>This is why UTF-8 is now used by 97% of websites and is the default encoding for most programming languages, including Go.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  💻 UTF-8 in Action (With Go Examples)\n</h3><p>Since Go natively supports UTF-8, you don’t need to do anything special—it just works. But let’s dig into some examples to see it in action.</p><p><strong>1️⃣ Encoding a String as UTF-8 Bytes</strong></p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><ul><li><p>English characters (, ) are 1 byte each.</p></li><li><p>Chinese characters () are 3 bytes each.</p></li></ul><p>This variable-length encoding is why UTF-8 is so efficient!</p><p><strong>2️⃣ Decoding UTF-8 Bytes Back to a String</strong></p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>💡 No extra libraries—Go just handles it. That’s one of the nice things about UTF-8 in Go.</p><p><strong>3️⃣ Handling UTF-8 in Web Applications</strong></p><p>If you're building a web app, always specify UTF-8 in your response headers:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>💡 Without , some browsers might misinterpret the text and display garbage characters.</p><p><strong>4️⃣ Validating UTF-8 Data</strong></p><p>Not every byte sequence is valid UTF-8. You can check with :</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>✅ Great for validating user input before processing it!</p><p><strong>5️⃣ Counting Unicode Characters (Runes) in a String</strong></p><p>Go strings are byte sequences, not necessarily character sequences.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>❗ Why the difference? Because 世界 takes 3 bytes each, so len(text) == 13, but there are only 9 characters.</p><p><strong>6️⃣ Iterating Over Unicode Characters</strong></p><p>Since some characters take more than 1 byte, normal indexing won’t work. Use :</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>❗ Notice how 世界 starts at index 7, not 5, because it uses 3 bytes each.</p><h3>\n  \n  \n  🚀 Why UTF-8 is the Default Encoding\n</h3><p>Before UTF-8:\n❌ Confusing mess of different encodings<p>\n❌ Text corruption between systems</p>\n❌ Websites needed to support multiple charsets</p><p>After UTF-8:\n✅ One encoding for everything<p>\n✅ No more garbled text (mojibake)</p>\n✅ Supported everywhere—from databases to web APIs</p><p>If you’re dealing with text in Go (or any language), understanding UTF-8 is essential.

A key component, the lookahead set, should have its own type with all related methods grouped together, not lying elsewhere. This improves maintainability and makes adding methods easier. Similarly, the kernel item should define its own string representation method. These structs also include a Clone method for copying instances.</p><p>The fourth issue is convolution. The  variable determines whether closure is  or  for state generation and  for processing closed states.

We can call the function again.\nres, _ = fn.Call(ctx, api.EncodeI32(b), api.EncodeI32(c))\nfmt.Printf(\"add(%d, %d) = %d\\n\", b, c, api.DecodeI32(res[0]))\n</code></pre><p>The  directive and the reactor build mode allow applications to\nbe extended by calling into Go-based Wasm code.\nThis is particularly valuable for applications that have adopted Wasm as a\nplugin or extension mechanism with well-defined interfaces.\nBy exporting Go functions, applications can leverage the Go Wasm modules to\nprovide functionality without needing to recompile the entire application.\nFurthermore, building as a reactor ensures that the exported functions can be\ncalled multiple times without requiring reinitialization, making it suitable\nfor long-running applications or services.</p><h2>Supporting rich types between the host and the client</h2><p>Go 1.24 also relaxes the constraints on types that can be used as input and\nresult parameters with  functions.\nFor example, one can pass a bool, a string, a pointer to an , or a\npointer to a struct which embeds  and contains supported\nfield types\n(see the <a href=\"https://go.dev/cmd/compile#hdr-WebAssembly_Directives\">documentation</a> for detail).\nThis allows Go Wasm applications to be written in a more natural and ergonomic\nway, and removes some unnecessary type conversions.</p><p>While Go 1.24 has made significant enhancements to its Wasm capabilities,\nthere are still some notable limitations.</p><p>Wasm is a single-threaded architecture with no parallelism.\nA  function can spawn new goroutines.\nBut if a function creates a background goroutine, it will not continue\nexecuting when the  function returns, until calling back into\nthe Go-based Wasm module.</p><p>While some type restrictions have been relaxed in Go 1.24, there are still\nlimitations on the types that can be used with  and\n functions.\nDue to the unfortunate mismatch between the 64-bit architecture of the client\nand the 32-bit architecture of the host, it is not possible to pass pointers in\nmemory.\nFor example, a  function cannot take a pointer to a struct that\ncontains a pointer-typed field.</p><p>The addition of the ability to build a WASI reactor and export Go functions to\nWasm in Go 1.24 represent a significant step forward for Go’s WebAssembly\ncapabilities.\nThese features empower developers to create more versatile and powerful Go-based\nWasm applications, opening up new possibilities for Go in the Wasm ecosystem.</p>","contentLength":5777,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Go 1.24 arrives","url":"https://golangweekly.com/issues/542","date":1739318400,"author":"","guid":254,"unread":true,"content":"<li><p><a href=\"https://golangweekly.com/link/165684/rss\">DB Fiddle</a> is a handy online database 'sandbox' for playing with various versions of MySQL, Postgres, and SQLite direct from the browser.</p></li>","contentLength":136,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Go 1.24 is released!","url":"https://go.dev/blog/go1.24","date":1739232000,"author":"Junyang Shao, on behalf of the Go team","guid":136,"unread":true,"content":"<div data-slug=\"/blog/go1.24\"><p>\n      Junyang Shao, on behalf of the Go team\n      11 February 2025\n      </p><p>Today the Go team is excited to release Go 1.24,\nwhich you can get by visiting the <a href=\"https://go.dev/dl/\">download page</a>.</p><p>Go 1.24 comes with many improvements over Go 1.23.
