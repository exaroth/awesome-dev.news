WebAssembly (Wasm) capabilities with the\naddition of the  directive and the ability to build a reactor\nfor WebAssembly System Interface (WASI).\nThese features enable Go developers to export Go functions to Wasm,\nfacilitating better integration with Wasm hosts and expanding the possibilities\nfor Go-based Wasm applications.</p><h2>WebAssembly and the WebAssembly System Interface</h2><p><a href=\"https://webassembly.org/\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">WebAssembly (Wasm)</a> is a binary instruction format\nthat was initially created for web browsers, providing the execution of\nhigh-performance, low-level code at speeds approaching native performance.\nSince then, Wasm‚Äôs utility has expanded, and it is now used in various\nenvironments beyond the browser.\nNotably, cloud providers offer services that directly execute Wasm\nexecutables, taking advantage of the\n<a href=\"https://wasi.dev/\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">WebAssembly System Interface (WASI)</a> system call API.\nWASI allows these executables to interact with system resources.</p><p>Go first added support for compiling to Wasm in the 1.11 release, through the\n port.\nGo 1.21 added a new port targeting the WASI preview 1 syscall API through the\nnew  port.</p><h2>Exporting Go Functions to Wasm with </h2><p>Go 1.24 introduces a new compiler directive, , which allows\ndevelopers to export Go functions to be called from outside of the\nWasm module, typically from a host application that runs the Wasm runtime.\nThis directive instructs the compiler to make the annotated function available\nas a Wasm <a href=\"https://webassembly.github.io/spec/core/valid/modules.html?highlight=export#exports\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">export</a>\nin the resulting Wasm binary.</p><p>To use the  directive, simply add it to a function definition:</p><pre><code>//go:wasmexport add\nfunc add(a, b int32) int32 { return a + b }\n</code></pre><p>With this, the Wasm module will have an exported function named  that\ncan be called from the host.</p><p>This is analogous to the <a href=\"https://go.dev/cmd/cgo#hdr-C_references_to_Go\">cgo  directive</a>,\nwhich makes the function available to be called from C,\nthough  uses a different, simpler mechanism.</p><p>A WASI reactor is a WebAssembly module that operates continuously, and\ncan be called upon multiple times to react on events or requests.\nUnlike a ‚Äúcommand‚Äù module, which terminates after its main function finishes,\na reactor instance remains live after initialization, and its exports remain\naccessible.</p><p>With Go 1.24, one can build a WASI reactor with the  build\nflag.</p><pre><code>$ GOOS=wasip1 GOARCH=wasm go build -buildmode=c-shared -o reactor.wasm\n</code></pre><p>The build flag signals to the linker not to generate the  function\n(the entry point for a command module), and instead generate an\n function, which performs runtime and package initialization,\nalong with any exported functions and their dependencies.\nThe  function must be called before any other exported functions.\nThe  function will not be automatically invoked.</p><p>To use a WASI reactor, the host application first initializes it by calling\n, then simply invoke the exported functions.\nHere is an example using <a href=\"https://wazero.io/\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Wazero</a>, a Go-based Wasm runtime\nimplementation:</p><pre><code>// Create a Wasm runtime, set up WASI.\nr := wazero.NewRuntime(ctx)\ndefer r.Close(ctx)\nwasi_snapshot_preview1.MustInstantiate(ctx, r)\n\n// Configure the module to initialize the reactor.\nconfig := wazero.NewModuleConfig().WithStartFunctions(\"_initialize\")\n\n// Instantiate the module.\nwasmModule, _ := r.InstantiateWithConfig(ctx, wasmFile, config)\n\n// Call the exported function.\nfn := wasmModule.ExportedFunction(\"add\")\nvar a, b int32 = 1, 2\nres, _ := fn.Call(ctx, api.EncodeI32(a), api.EncodeI32(b))\nc := api.DecodeI32(res[0])\nfmt.Printf(\"add(%d, %d) = %d\\n\", a, b, c)\n\n// The instance is still alive. We can call the function again.\nres, _ = fn.Call(ctx, api.EncodeI32(b), api.EncodeI32(c))\nfmt.Printf(\"add(%d, %d) = %d\\n\", b, c, api.DecodeI32(res[0]))\n</code></pre><p>The  directive and the reactor build mode allow applications to\nbe extended by calling into Go-based Wasm code.\nThis is particularly valuable for applications that have adopted Wasm as a\nplugin or extension mechanism with well-defined interfaces.\nBy exporting Go functions, applications can leverage the Go Wasm modules to\nprovide functionality without needing to recompile the entire application.\nFurthermore, building as a reactor ensures that the exported functions can be\ncalled multiple times without requiring reinitialization, making it suitable\nfor long-running applications or services.</p><h2>Supporting rich types between the host and the client</h2><p>Go 1.24 also relaxes the constraints on types that can be used as input and\nresult parameters with  functions.\nFor example, one can pass a bool, a string, a pointer to an , or a\npointer to a struct which embeds  and contains supported\nfield types\n(see the <a href=\"https://go.dev/cmd/compile#hdr-WebAssembly_Directives\">documentation</a> for detail).\nThis allows Go Wasm applications to be written in a more natural and ergonomic\nway, and removes some unnecessary type conversions.</p><p>While Go 1.24 has made significant enhancements to its Wasm capabilities,\nthere are still some notable limitations.</p><p>Wasm is a single-threaded architecture with no parallelism.\nA  function can spawn new goroutines.\nBut if a function creates a background goroutine, it will not continue\nexecuting when the  function returns, until calling back into\nthe Go-based Wasm module.</p><p>While some type restrictions have been relaxed in Go 1.24, there are still\nlimitations on the types that can be used with  and\n functions.\nDue to the unfortunate mismatch between the 64-bit architecture of the client\nand the 32-bit architecture of the host, it is not possible to pass pointers in\nmemory.\nFor example, a  function cannot take a pointer to a struct that\ncontains a pointer-typed field.</p><p>The addition of the ability to build a WASI reactor and export Go functions to\nWasm in Go 1.24 represent a significant step forward for Go‚Äôs WebAssembly\ncapabilities.\nThese features empower developers to create more versatile and powerful Go-based\nWasm applications, opening up new possibilities for Go in the Wasm ecosystem.</p>","contentLength":5777,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Go 1.24 arrives","url":"https://golangweekly.com/issues/542","date":1739318400,"author":"","guid":254,"unread":true,"content":"<li><p><a href=\"https://golangweekly.com/link/165684/rss\">DB Fiddle</a> is a handy online database 'sandbox' for playing with various versions of MySQL, Postgres, and SQLite direct from the browser.</p></li>","contentLength":136,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Go 1.24 is released!","url":"https://go.dev/blog/go1.24","date":1739232000,"author":"Junyang Shao, on behalf of the Go team","guid":136,"unread":true,"content":"<div data-slug=\"/blog/go1.24\"><p>\n      Junyang Shao, on behalf of the Go team\n      11 February 2025\n      </p><p>Today the Go team is excited to release Go 1.24,\nwhich you can get by visiting the <a href=\"https://go.dev/dl/\">download page</a>.</p><p>Go 1.24 comes with many improvements over Go 1.23.
