The rule against cinematics — which made our jobs much harder and also ended up leaving a lot of my favorite work out of the game — was a kind of ideological stake in the ground: we really did want the game and the story to be the same thing. It was far from flawless, but it was really trying to push the boundaries of a young medium.</p><p>— Valve artist Steve Theodore</p></blockquote><p>By 1998, the first-person shooter was nearing its pinnacle of popularity. In June of that year,  magazine could list fourteen reasonably big-budget, high-profile FPS’s earmarked for release in the next six months alone. And yet the FPS seemed rather to be running to stand still. Almost all of the innovation taking place in the space was in the realm of technology rather than design.</p><p>To be sure, progress in the former realm was continuing apace. Less than five years after <a href=\"https://www.filfre.net/2020/05/the-shareware-scene-part-3-the-id-boys\">id Software</a> had shaken the world with <a href=\"https://www.filfre.net/2020/06/the-shareware-scene-part-4-doom\"></a>, that game’s low-resolution 2.5D graphics and equally crude soundscapes had become positively quaint. Aided and abetted by a fast-evolving ecosystem of <a href=\"https://www.filfre.net/2023/05/the-next-generation-in-graphics-part-2-three-dimensions-in-hardware\">3D-graphics hardware</a> from <a href=\"https://www.filfre.net/2023/05/the-next-generation-in-graphics-part-3-software-meets-hardware\">companies like 3Dfx</a>, <a href=\"https://www.filfre.net/2023/04/the-next-generation-in-graphics-part-1-three-dimensions-in-software-or-quake-and-its-discontents\">id’s  engine</a> had raised the bar enormously in 1996; ditto <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/405/quake-ii/\"></a> in 1997. These were the cutting-edge engines that everyone with hopes of selling a lot of shooters scrambled to license. Then, in May of 1998, with <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/649/quake-iii-arena/\"></a> not scheduled for release until late the following year, Epic MegaGames came along with their own <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/330/unreal/\"></a> engine, boasting a considerably longer bullet list of graphical effects than . In thus directly challenging id’s heretofore unquestioned supremacy in the space,  ignited a 3D-graphics arms race that seemed to promise even faster progress in the immediate future.</p><p>Yet whether they sported the name  or  or something else on their boxes, single-player FPS’s were still content to hew to the “shooting gallery” design template laid out by . You were expected to march through a ladder-style campaign consisting of a set number of discrete levels, each successive one full of more and more deadly enemies to kill than the last, perhaps with some puzzles of the lock-and-key or button-mashing stripe to add a modicum of variety. These levels were joined together by some thread of story, sometimes more elaborate and sometimes — usually — less so, but so irrelevant to what occurred inside the levels that impatient gamers could and sometimes did skip right over the intervening cutscenes or other forms of exposition in order to get right back into the action.</p><p>This was clearly a model with which countless gamers were completely comfortable, one which had the virtue of allowing them maximal freedom of choice: follow along with the story or ignore it, as you liked. Or, as id’s star programmer John Carmack famously said: “Story in a game is like a story in a porn movie. It’s expected to be there, but it’s not that important.”</p><p>But what if you could build the story right into the gameplay, such that the two became inseparable? What if you could eliminate the artificial division between exposition and action, and with it the whole conceit of a game as a mere series of levels waiting to be beaten one by one? What if you could drop players into an open-ended space where the story was taking place all around them?</p><p>This was the thinking that animated an upstart newcomer to the games industry that went by the name of Valve L.L.C. The game that resulted from it would prove the most dramatic conceptual advance in the FPS genre since , with lessons and repercussions that reached well beyond the borders of shooter country.</p><div><a href=\"https://www.filfre.net/2024/11/__trashed/newell2/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-6182\"><img decoding=\"async\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-6182\" src=\"https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/newell2-300x196.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"392\" srcset=\"https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/newell2-300x196.jpg 300w, https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/newell2.jpg 632w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\"></a></div><div><a href=\"https://www.filfre.net/2024/11/__trashed/harrington-2/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-6206\"><img decoding=\"async\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-6206\" src=\"https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/harrington.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"350\" srcset=\"https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/harrington.jpg 300w, https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/harrington-257x300.jpg 257w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\"></a><p>Mike Harrington, who left Valve in 2000 because there were other fish in the sea.</p></div><p>The formation of Valve was one of several outcomes of a dawning realization inside the Microsoft of the mid-1990s that computer gaming was becoming a very big business. The same realization led a highly respected Microsoft programmer named Michael Abrash to quit his cushy job in Redmond, Washington, throw his tie into the nearest trashcan, and move to Mesquite, Texas, to help John Carmack and the other scruffy id boys make . It led another insider named Alex St. John to put together the internal team who made DirectX, a library of code that allowed game developers and players to finally say farewell to creaky old MS-DOS and join the rest of the world that was running <a href=\"https://www.filfre.net/2022/11/doing-windows-part-10-chicago\">Windows 95</a>. It led Microsoft to buy an outfit called Ensemble Studios and their promising real-time-strategy game <a href=\"https://www.filfre.net/2024/03/age-of-empires-or-how-microsoft-got-in-on-games\"></a> as a first wedge for levering their way into the gaming market as a publisher of major note. And it led to Valve Corporation.</p><p>In 1996, Valve’s future co-founders Gabe Newell and Mike Harrington were both valued employees of Microsoft. Newell had been working there in project-management roles since 1983; he had played an important part in the creation of the <a href=\"https://www.filfre.net/2018/06/doing-windows-part-1-ms-dos-and-its-discontents\">early versions of Windows</a> before moving on to Microsoft Office and other high-profile applications. Harrington was a programmer whose tenure had been shorter, but he had made significant contributions to Windows NT, Microsoft’s business- and server-oriented operating system.</p><p>As Newell tells the tale, he had an epiphany when he was asked to commission a study to find out just how many computers were currently running Microsoft Windows in the United States. The number of 20 million that he got back was impressive. Yet he was shocked to learn that Windows wasn’t the most popular single piece of software to be found on American personal computers; that was rather a game called . Newell and Harrington had long enjoyed playing games. Now, it seemed, there were huge piles of money to be earned from making them. Doing so struck them as a heck of a lot more fun than making more operating systems and business software. It was worth a shot, at any rate; both men were wealthy enough by now that they could afford to take a flier on something completely different.</p><p>So, on August, 24, 1996, the pair quit Microsoft to open an office for their new company Valve some five miles away in Kirkland, Washington. At the time, no one could have imagined — least of all them — what a milestone moment this would go down as in the history of gaming. “On the surface, we should have failed,” says Gabe Newell. “Realistically, both Mike and I thought we would get about a year into it, realize we’d made horrible mistakes, and go back to our friends at Microsoft and ask for our jobs back.”</p><p>Be that as it may, they did know what kind of game they wanted to make. Or rather Newell did; from the beginning, he was the driving creative and conceptual force, while Harrington focused more on the practical logistics of running a business and making quality software. Like so many others in the industry he was entering, Newell wanted to make a shooter. Yet he wanted his shooter to be more immersive and encompassing of its player than any of the ones that were currently out there, with a story that was embedded right into the gameplay rather than standing apart from it. Valve wasted no time in licensing id’s  engine to bring these aspirations to life, via the game that would come to be known as .</p><p>As the id deal demonstrates, Newell and Harrington had connections and financial resources to hand that almost any other would-be game maker would have killed for; both had exited Microsoft as millionaires several times over. Yet they had no access to gaming distribution channels, meaning that they had to beat the bush for a publisher just like anyone else with a new studio. They soon found that their studio and their ambitious ideas were a harder sell than they had expected. With games becoming a bigger business every year, there were a lot of deep-pocketed folks from other fields jumping into the industry with plans to teach all of the people who were already there what they were doing wrong; such folks generally had no clue about what it took to do games right. Seasoned industry insiders had a name for these people, one that was usually thoroughly apt: “Tourists.” At first glance, the label was easy to apply to Newell and Harrington and Valve. Among those who did so was Mitch Lasky, then an executive at Activision, who would go on to become a legendary gaming venture capitalist. He got “a whiff of tourism” from Valve, he admits. He says he still has “post-traumatic stress disorder” over his decision to pass on signing them to a publishing deal — but by no means was he the only one to do so.</p><p>Newell and Harrington finally wound up pitching to Sierra, a publisher known primarily for point-and-click adventure games, a venerable genre that was now being sorely tested by all of the new FPS’s. In light of this, Sierra was understandably eager to find a horse of the new breed to back. The inking of a publishing deal with Valve was one of the last major decisions made by <a href=\"https://www.filfre.net/2011/10/ken-and-roberta\">Ken Williams</a>, who had <a href=\"https://www.filfre.net/2011/10/on-line-systems-is-born\">founded Sierra</a> in his living room back in 1980 but was now in the process of selling the business he had built from the ground up. As a man with such deep roots in adventure games, he found Valve’s focus on story both refreshing and appealing. Still, there was a lot of wrangling between the parties, mainly over the ultimate disposition of the rights to the  name; Williams wanted them to go to Sierra, but Newell and Harrington wanted to retain them for themselves. In the end, with no other publishers stepping up to the plate, Valve had to accept what Sierra was offering, a capitulation that would lead to a lengthy legal battle a few years down the road. For now, though, they had their publisher.</p><p>As for Ken Williams, who would exit the industry stage left well before  was finished:</p><blockquote><p>Now that I’m retired, people sometimes ask me what I used to do. I usually just say, “I had a game company back in the old days.” That inevitably causes them to say, “Did you make any games I might have heard of?” I answer, “<a href=\"https://www.filfre.net/2015/08/leisure-suit-larry-in-the-land-of-the-lounge-lizards\">Leisure Suit Larry</a>.” That normally is sufficient, but if there is no glimmer of recognition I pull out the heavy artillery and say, “Half-Life.” Unless they’ve been sleeping under a rock for the last couple of decades, that always lights up their eyes.</p></blockquote><p>One can imagine worse codas to a business career…</p><p>In what could all too easily be read as another sign of naïve tourism, Newell and Harrington agreed to a crazily optimistic development timeline, promising a finished game for the Christmas of 1997, which was just one year away. To make it happen, they hired a few dozen level designers, programmers, artists, and other creative and technical types, many of whom had no prior professional experience in the games industry, all of whom recognized what an extraordinary opportunity they were being handed and were willing to work like dogs to make the most of it. The founders tapped a fertile pool of recruits in the online  and  modding scenes, where amateurs were making names for themselves by bending those engines in all sorts of new directions. They would now do the same on a professional basis at Valve, even as the programmers modified the  engine itself to suit their needs, implementing better lighting and particle effects, and adding scripting and artificial-intelligence capabilities that the straightforward run-and-shoot gameplay in which id specialized had never demanded. Gabe Newell would estimate when all was said and done that 75 percent of the code in the engine had been written or rewritten at Valve.</p><p>In June of 1997, Valve took  to the big E3 trade show, where it competed for attention with a murderers’ row of other FPS’s, including early builds of , <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/322/sin/\"></a>, <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/1678/john-romeros-daikatana/\"></a>, , and <a href=\"https://www.filfre.net/2024/04/jedi-knight-plus-notes-on-an-expanded-universe\"></a>. Valve didn’t even have a booth of their own at the show. Nor were they to be found inside Sierra’s;  was instead shown in the booth of 3Dfx. Like so many of Valve’s early moves, this one was deceptively clever, because 3Dfx was absolutely huge at the time, with as big a buzz around their hardware as id enjoyed around their software.  walked away from the show with the title of “Best Action Game.”</p><p>The validation of E3 made the unavoidable moment of reckoning that came soon after easier to stomach. I speak, of course, about the moment when Valve had to recognize that they didn’t have a ghost of a chance of finishing the game that they wanted to make within the next few months. Newell and Harrington looked at the state of the project and decided that they could probably scrape together a more or less acceptable but formulaic shooter in time for that coming Christmas. Or they could keep working and end up with something amazing for the  Christmas. To their eternal credit, they chose the latter course, a decision which was made possible only by their deep pockets. For Sierra, who were <a href=\"https://www.filfre.net/2019/07/the-mortgaging-of-sierra-online\">notorious</a> for releasing <a href=\"https://www.filfre.net/2018/10/quest-for-glory-iii-and-iv\">half-finished games</a>, certainly did not intend to pay for an extra year of development time. The co-founders would have to foot that bill themselves. Nevertheless, to hear Gabe Newell tell it today, it was a no-brainer: “Late is just for a little while. Suck is forever.”</p><p>The anticipation around  didn’t diminish in the months that followed, not even after the finished  took the world by storm in May of 1998. Despite being based on a two-plus-year-old engine in a milieu that usually prized the technologically new and shiny above all else, Valve’s “shooter with a story” had well and truly captured the imaginations of gamers. During the summer of 1998, a demo of the game consisting of the first three chapters — including the now-iconic opening scenes, in which you ride a tram into a secret government research facility as just another scientist on the staff headed for another day on the job — leaked out of the offices of a magazine to which it had been sent. It did more to promote the game than a million dollars worth of advertising could have; the demo spread like wildfire online, raising the excitement level to an even more feverish pitch.  was different enough to have the frisson of novelty in the otherwise homogeneous culture of the FPS, whilst still being readily identifiable  an FPS. It was the perfect mix of innovation and familiarity.</p><p>So, it was no real surprise when the full game turned into a massive hit for Valve and Sierra after its release on November 19, 1998. The magazines fell all over themselves to praise it. , normally the closest thing the hype-driven journalism of gaming had to a voice of sobriety, got as high on s supply as anyone. The magazine’s long-serving associate editor Jeff Green took it upon himself to render the official verdict.</p><blockquote><p>Everything you’ve heard, everything you’ve hoped for — it’s all true. Half-Life, Valve Software’s highly anticipated first-person shooter, is not just one of the best games of the year. It’s one of the best games of any year, an instant classic that is miles better than any of its immediate competition, and, in its single-player form, is the best shooter since DOOM. Plus, despite the fact that it’s “just” a shooter, Half-Life provides one of the best examples ever of how to present an interactive movie — and a great, scary movie at that.</p></blockquote><p> sold its first 200,000 copies in the United States before Christmas — i.e., before glowing reviews like the one above even hit the newsstands. But this was the barest beginning to its success story. In honor of its tenth birthday in 2008, Guinness of world-records fame would formally anoint  as the best-selling single FPS in history, with total sales in the neighborhood of 10 million copies across all platforms and countries. For Newell and Harrington, it was one hell of a way to launch a game-development studio. For Sierra, who in truth had done very little for  beyond putting it in a box and shipping it out to stores, it was a tsunami of cash that seemed to come out of nowhere, the biggest game they had ever published almost by an order of magnitude. One does hope that somebody in the company’s new management took a moment to thank Ken Williams for this manna from heaven.</p><p> has come to occupy such a hallowed, well-nigh sacrosanct position in the annals of gaming that any encounter with the actual artifact today seems bound to be slightly underwhelming. Yet even when we take into account the trouble that any game would have living up to a reputation as elevated as this one’s, the truth is that there’s quite a lot here for the modern skeptical critic to find fault with — and, Lord knows, this particular critic has seldom been accused of lacking in skepticism.</p><p>Judged purely as a shooter, the design shows its age. It’s sometimes amazingly inspired, but more often no better than average for its time. There’s a lot of crawling through anonymous vents that serve no real purpose other than to extend the length of the game, a lot of places where you can survive only by dying first so as to learn what’s coming, a lot of spots where it’s really not clear at all what the game wants from you. And then there are an  lot of jumping puzzles, shoehorned into a game engine that has way more slop in it than is ideal for such things. I must say that I had more unadulterated fun with LucasArts’s , the last shooter I played all the way through for these histories, than I did with . There the levels are constructed like thrill rides straight out of the  films, with a through-line that seems to just intuitively come to you; looking back, I’m still in awe of their subtle genius in this respect.  is not like that. You really have to work to get through it, and that’s not as appealing to me.</p><p>Then again, my judgment on these things should, like that of any critic, be taken with a grain of salt. Whether you judge a game good or bad or mediocre hinges to a large degree on what precisely you’re looking for from it; we’ve all read countless negative reviews reflective not so much of a bad game as one that isn’t the game that that reviewer wanted to play. Personally, I’m very much a tourist in the land of the FPS. While I understand the appeal of the genre, I don’t want to expend too many hours or too much effort on it. I want to blast through a fun and engaging environment without too much friction. Make me feel like an awesome action hero while I’m at it, and I’ll probably walk away satisfied, ready to go play something else.  on easy mode gave me that experience;  did not, demanding a degree of careful attention from me that I wasn’t always eager to grant it. If you’re more hardcore about this genre than I am, your judgment of the positives and negatives in these things may very well be the opposite of mine. Certainly  is more typical of its era than  — an era when games like this were still accepted and even expected to be harder and more time-consuming than they are today. <em>C’est la vie et vive la différence!</em></p><p>But of course, it wasn’t the granular tactical details of the design that made  stand out so much from the competition back in the day. It was rather its brilliance as a storytelling vehicle that led to its legendary reputation. And don’t worry, you definitely won’t see me quibbling that said reputation isn’t deserved. Even here, though, we do need to be sure that we understand exactly what it did and did not do that was so innovative at the time.</p><p>Contrary to its popular rep then and now,  was by no means the first “shooter with a story.” Technically speaking, even  has a story, some prattle about a space station and a portal to Hell and a space marine who’s the only one that can stop the demon spawn. The story most certainly isn’t , but it’s there.</p><p> wasn’t even the shooter at the time of its release with the inarguably best or most complicated story. LucasArts makes a strong bid for the title there. Both <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/500/star-wars-dark-forces/\"></a> and the aforementioned , released in 1995 and 1997 respectively, weave fairly elaborate tales into the fabric of the existing  universe, drawing on its rich lore, inserting themselves into the established chronology of the original trilogy of films and the “Expanded Universe” series of  novels.</p><p>Like that of many games of this era, s story betrays the heavy influence of the television show <a href=\"https://www.filfre.net/2024/09/the-truth-is-out-there-part-1-the-will-to-believe\"></a>, which enjoyed its biggest season ever just before this game was released. We have the standard nefarious government conspiracy involving extraterrestrials, set in the standard top-secret military installation somewhere in the Desert Southwest. We even have a direct equivalent to Cancer Man, s shadowy, nameless villain who is constantly lurking behind the scenes. “G-Man” does the same in ; voice actor Michael Shapiro even opted to give him a “lizard voice” that’s almost a dead ringer for Cancer Man’s nicotine-addled croak.</p><div><a href=\"https://www.filfre.net/2024/11/__trashed/half-life_7/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-6195\"><img decoding=\"async\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-6195\" src=\"https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/half-life_7.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" srcset=\"https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/half-life_7.jpg 800w, https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/half-life_7-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/half-life_7-768x576.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\"></a></div><p>All told, s story is more of a collection of tropes than a serious exercise in fictional world-building. To be clear, the sketchiness is by no means an automatically bad thing, not when it’s judged in the light of the purpose the story actually needs to serve. Mark Laidlaw, the sometime science-fiction novelist who wrote the script, makes no bones about the limits to his ambitions for it. “You don’t have to write the whole story,” he says. “Because it’s a conspiracy plot, everybody knows more about it than you do. So you don’t have to answer those questions. Just keep raising questions.”</p><p>Once the shooting starts, plot-related things happen, but it’s all heat-of-the-moment stuff. You fight your way out of the complex after its been overrun by alien invaders coming through a trans-dimensional gate that’s been inadvertently opened, only to find that your own government is now as bent on killing you as the aliens are in the name of the disposal of evidence. Eventually, in a plot point weirdly reminiscent of , you have to teleport yourself onto the aliens’ world to shut down the portal they’re using to reach yours.</p><p>Suffice to say that, while  may be slightly further along the continuum toward  than  is, it’s only slightly so. Countless better, richer, deeper stories were told in games before this one came along. When people talk about  as “the FPS with a story,” they’re really talking about something more subtle: about its way of  its story. Far from diminishing the game, this makes it more important, across genres well beyond the FPS. The best way for us to start to come to grips with what  did that was so extraordinary might be to look back to the way games were deploying their stories before its arrival on the scene.</p><p>Throughout the 1980s, story in games was largely confined to the axiomatically narrative-heavy genres of the adventure game and the CRPG. Then, in 1990, Origin Systems released <a href=\"https://www.filfre.net/2017/04/from-squadron-to-wingleader\">Chris Roberts’s </a>, a game which was as revolutionary in the context of its own time as  was in its. In terms of gameplay,  was a “simulation” of outer-space dog-fighting, not all that far removed in spirit from the classic <a href=\"https://www.filfre.net/2013/12/elite\"></a>. What made it stand out was what happened when you weren’t behind the controls of your space fighter. Between missions, you hung out in the officers’ lounge aboard your mother ship, collecting scuttlebutt from the bartender, even flirting with the fetching female pilot in your squadron. When you went into the briefing room to learn about your next mission, you also learned about the effect your last one had had on the unfolding war against the deadly alien Kilrathi, and were given a broader picture of the latest developments in the conflict that necessitated this latest flight into danger. The missions themselves remained shooting galleries, but the story that was woven around them gave them resonance, made you feel like you were a part of something much grander. Almost equally importantly, this “campaign” provided an easy way to structure your time in the game and chart your improving skills; beat all of the missions in the campaign and see the story to its end, and you could say that you had mastered the game as a whole.</p><p>People  this;  became by far the most popular computer-gaming franchise of the young decade prior to the smashing arrival of  at the end of 1993. The approach it pioneered quickly spread across virtually all gaming genres. In particular, both the first-person-shooter and the real-time strategy genres — the two that would dominate over all others in the second half of the decade — adopted it as their model for the single-player experience. Even at its most rudimentary, a ladder-style campaign gave you a goal to pursue and a framework of progression to hang your hat on.</p><p>Yet the same approach created a weirdly rigid division between gameplay and exposition, not only on the playing side of the ledger but to a large extent on the development side as well. It wasn’t unusual for completely separate teams to be charged with making the gameplay part of a game and all of the narrative pomp and circumstance that justified it. The disconnect could sometimes verge on hilarious; in , which went so far as to film real humans acting out a B-grade  movie between its levels, the protagonist has a beard in the cutscenes but is clean-shaven during the levels. By the late 1990s, the pre-rendered-3D or filmed-live-action cutscenes sometimes cost more to produce than the game itself, and almost always filled more of the space on the CD.</p><p>As he was setting up his team at Valve, Gabe Newell attempted to eliminate this weird bifurcation between narrative and gameplay by passing down two edicts to his employees, the only non-negotiable rules he would ever impose upon them.  had to have a story — not necessarily one worthy of a film or a novel, but one worthy of the name. And at the same time, it couldn’t ever, under any conditions, from the very first moment to the very last, take control out of the hands of the player. Everything that followed cascaded from these two simple rules, which many a game maker of the time would surely have seen as mutually contradictory. To state the two most obvious and celebrated results, they meant no cutscenes whatsoever and no externally imposed ladder of levels to progress through — for any sort of level break did mean taking control out of the hands of the player, no matter how briefly.</p><p>Adapting to such a paradigm the  engine, which had been designed with a traditional FPS campaign in mind, proved taxing but achievable. Valve set up the world of  as a spatial grid of “levels” that were now better described as zones; pass over a boundary from one zone into another, and the new one would be loaded in swiftly and almost transparently. Valve kept the discrete zones small so as to minimize the loading times, judging more but shorter loading breaks to be better than fewer but longer ones. The hardest part was dealing with the borderlands, so to speak; you needed to be able to look into one zone from another, and the enemies and allies around you had to stay consistent before and after a transition. But Valve managed even this through some clever technical sleight of hand — such as by creating overlapping areas that existed in both of the adjoining sets of level data — and through more of the same on the design side, such as by placing the borders whenever possible at corners in corridors and at other spots where the line of sight didn’t extend too far. The occasional brief loading message aside — and they’re  brief, or even effectively nonexistent, on modern hardware —  really does feel like it all takes place in the same contiguous space.</p><p>\nEvery detail of  has been analyzed at extensive, exhaustive length over the decades since its release. Such analysis has its place in fan culture, but it can be more confusing than clarifying when it comes to appreciating the game’s most important achievements. The ironic fact is that you can learn almost everything that really matters about  as a game design just by playing it for an hour or so, enough to get into its third chapter.

There are reports that many gamers back in the day didn’t actually realize that they were already in control of the protagonist — reports that they just sat there patiently waiting for the “cutscene” to finish, so ingrained was the status quo of bifurcation.</p><p>The protagonist himself strikes an artful balance between being an undefined player stand-in — what <a href=\"https://www.filfre.net/2024/06/the-last-days-of-zork\"></a> called an “AFGNCAAP,” or “Ageless, Faceless, Gender-Neutral, Culturally Ambiguous Adventure Person” — and a fully fleshed-out character. As another result of Newell’s guiding rules, you never see him in the game unless you look in a mirror; you only see the world through his eyes. You do, however, hear security guards and colleagues refer to him — or, if you like, to you — as “Gordon” or “Mr. Freeman.” The manual and the intertitles that appear over the opening sequence of the game explain that his full name is indeed Gordon Freeman, and that he’s a 27-year-old theoretical physicist with a PhD from MIT who has been recently hired to work at Black Mesa. The game’s loading screen and its box art show us a rather atypical FPS protagonist, someone very different from the muscle-bound, cigar-chomping Duke Nukem or the cocky budding Jedi knight Kyle Katarn: a slim, studious-looking fellow with Coke-bottle eyeglasses and a token goatee. The heart of the computer-gaming demographic being what it was in 1998, he was disarmingly easy for many of the first players of  to identify with, thus adding just that one more note of immersion to the symphony. Small wonder that he has remained a favorite with cosplayers for decades. In fact, cipher though he almost entirely is, Gordon Freeman has become one of the most famous videogame characters in history.</p><p>The tram eventually arrives at its destination and a security guard welcomes you to the part of the complex where you work: “Morning, Mr. Freeman. Looks like you’re running late.” Passing through the double blast doors, you learn from your colleagues inside that it’s already been a rough morning: the main computer has crashed, which has thrown a wrench into an important test that was planned for today. Mind you, you don’t learn this through dialog menus, which Valve judged to qualify as taking control away from the player. You can’t speak at all, but if you approach the guards and scientists, they’ll say things to you, leaving you to imagine your own role in the conversation. Or you can stand back and listen to the conversations they have with one another.</p><p>You can wander around as you like in this office area. You can look in Gordon’s locker to learn a little bit more about him, buy a snack from the vending machine, even blow it up by microwaving it for too long. (“My God!” says your colleague in reaction. “What are you doing?”) All of this inculcates the sense of a lived-in workspace better than any amount of external exposition could have done, setting up a potent contrast with the havoc to come.</p><p>When you get bored fooling around with lockers and microwaves, you put on your hazardous-environment suit and head down to where the day’s test is to be conducted. It isn’t made clear to you the player just what the test is meant to accomplish; it isn’t even clear that Gordon himself understands the entirety of the research project to which he’s been assigned. All that matters is that the test goes horribly wrong, creating a “resonance cascade event” that’s accompanied by a lot of scary-looking energy beams flying through the air and explosions popping off everywhere. You’ve now reached the end of the second chapter without ever touching a weapon. But that’s about to change, because you’re about to find out that hostile alien lifeforms are now swarming the place. “Get to the surface as soon as you can and let someone know we’re stranded down here!” demand your colleagues. So, you pick up the handy crowbar you find lying on the floor and set off to batter a path through the opposition.</p><p>This was a drill with which 1990s shooter fans were a lot more familiar, but there are still plenty of new wrinkles. The scientists and guards who were present in the complex before all hell broke loose don’t just disappear. They’re still around, mostly cowering in the corners in the case of the former, doing their best to fight back in that of the latter. The scientists sometimes have vital information to share, while the guards will join you as full-blown allies, firing off their pop-gun pistols at your side, although they tend not to live very long. Allies were a new thing under the FPS sun in 1998, an idea that would quickly spread to other games. (Ditto the way that the guards here are almost better at shooting you in the back than they are at shooting the rampaging aliens. The full history of “allies” in the FPS genre is a fraught one…)</p><p>As you battle your way up through the complex, you witness plenty of pre-scripted scenes to go along with the emergent behavior of the scientists, guards, and aliens. Ideally, you won’t consciously notice any distinction between the two. You see a scientist being transformed into a zombie by an alien “head crab” behind the window of his office; see several hapless sad sacks tumbling down an open elevator shaft; see a dying guard trying and just failing to reach a healing station. These not only add to the terror and drama, but sometimes have a teaching function. The dying guard, for example, points out to you the presence of healing stations for ensuring that you don’t come to share his fate.</p><p>It’s the combination of emergent and scripted behaviors, on the part of your enemies and even more on that of your friends, that makes  come so vividly alive. I’m tempted to use the word “realism” here, but I know that Gabe Newell would rush to correct me if I did. Realism, he would say, is boring. Realistically, a guy like Gordon Freeman — heck, even one like Duke Nukem — wouldn’t last ten minutes in a situation like this one. Call it verisimilitude instead, a sign of a game that’s absolutely determined to stay true to its fictional premise, never mind how outlandish it is. The world  presents really is a living one; Newell’s rule of thumb was that five seconds should never pass without something happening near the player. Likewise, the world has to react to anything the player does. “If I shoot the wall, the wall should change, you know?” Newell said. “Similarly, if I were to throw a grenade at a grunt, he should react to it, right? I mean, he should run away from it or lay down on the ground and duck for cover. If he can’t run away from it, he should yell ‘Shit!’ or ‘Fire in the hole!’ or something like that.” In , he will indeed do one or all of these things.</p><p>The commitment to verisimilitude means that most of what you see and hear is, to use the language of film, diegetic, or internal to the world as Gordon Freeman is experiencing it. Even the onscreen HUD is the one that Gordon is seeing, being the one that’s built into his hazard suit. The exceptions to the diegetic rule are few: the musical soundtrack that plays behind your exploits; the chapter names and titles which flash on the screen from time to time; those credits that are superimposed over the tram ride at the very beginning. These exceptions notwithstanding, the game’s determination to immerse you in an almost purely diegetic sensory bubble is the reason I have to strongly differ with Jeff Green’s description of  as an “interactive movie.” It’s actually the polar opposite of such a stylized beast. It’s an exercise in raw immersion which seeks to eliminate any barriers between you and your lived experience rather than making you feel like you’re doing anything so passive as watching or even guiding a movie. One might go so far as to take  as a sign that gaming was finally growing up and learning to stand on its own two feet by 1998, no longer needing to take so many of its cues from other forms of media.</p><p>We’ve about reached the end of our hour in  now, so we can dispense with the blow-by-blow. This is not to say that we’ve seen all the game has to offer. Betwixt and between the sequences that I find somewhat tedious going are more jaw-dropping dramatic peaks: the moment when you reach the exit to the complex at long last, only to learn that the United States Army wants to terminate rather than rescue you; the moment when you discover a tram much like the one you arrived on and realize that you can drive it through the tunnels; the moment when you burst out of the complex completely and see the bright blue desert sky above. (Unfortunately, it’s partially blotted out by a big Marine helicopter that also wants to kill you).</p><p>In my opinion,  could have been an even better game if it had been about half as long, made up of only its most innovative and stirring moments — “all killer, no filler,” as they used to say in the music business. Alas, the marketplace realities of game distribution in the late 1990s militated against this. If you were going to charge a punter $40 or $50 for a boxed game, you had to make sure it lasted more than six or seven hours. If  was being made today, Valve might very well have made different choices.</p><p>Again, though, mileages will vary when it comes to these things. The one place where  does fall down fairly undeniably is right at the end. Your climactic journey into Xen, the world of the aliens, is so truncated by time and budget considerations as to be barely there at all, being little more than a series of (infuriating) jumping puzzles and a couple of boss fights. Tellingly, it’s here that  gives in at last and violates its own rules of engagement, by delivering — perish the thought! — a cutscene containing the last bits of exposition that Valve didn’t have time to shoehorn into their game proper. The folks from Valve almost universally name the trip to Xen as their biggest single regret, saying they wish they had either found a way to do it properly or just saved it for a sequel. Needless to say, I can only concur.</p><p>Yet the fact remains that  at its best is so audacious and so groundbreaking that it almost transcends such complaints. Its innovations have echoed down across decades and genres. We’ll be bearing witness to that again and again in the years to come as we continue our journey through gaming history. Longtime readers of this site will know that I’m very sparing in my use of words like “revolutionary.” But I feel no reluctance whatsoever to apply the word to this game.</p><p><strong>Did you enjoy this article?

In cases where we use third parties to help build a service, a well-defined contract can facilitate good development practices like conducting a research and prototyping phase, refining product requirements as the service is built, evaluating open source alternatives, ensuring frequent delivery milestones, and allowing the flexibility to purchase cloud computing resources.</p><p><a href=\"https://techfarhub.cio.gov/handbook/\">The TechFAR Handbook</a> provides a detailed explanation of the flexibilities in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) that can help agencies implement this play.</p><ol><li>Budget includes research, discovery, and prototyping activities</li><li>Contract is structured to request frequent deliverables, not multi-month milestones</li><li>Contract is structured to hold vendors accountable to deliverables</li><li>Contract gives the government delivery team enough flexibility to adjust feature prioritization and delivery schedule as the project evolves</li><li>Contract ensures open source solutions are evaluated when technology choices are made</li><li>Contract specifies that software and data generated by third parties remains under our control, and can be reused and released to the public as appropriate and in accordance with the law</li><li>Contract allows us to use tools, services, and hosting from vendors with a variety of pricing models, including fixed fees and variable models like “pay-for-what-you-use” services</li><li>Contract specifies a warranty period where defects uncovered by the public are addressed by the vendor at no additional cost to the government</li><li>Contract includes a transition of services period and transition-out plan</li></ol><ul><li>What is the scope of the project?

This includes bringing in seasoned product managers, engineers, and designers. When outside help is needed, our teams should work with contracting officers who understand how to evaluate third-party technical competency so our teams can be paired with contractors who are good at both building and delivering effective digital services. The makeup and experience requirements of the team will vary depending on the scope of the project.</p><ol><li>Member(s) of the team have experience building popular, high-traffic digital services</li><li>Member(s) of the team have experience designing mobile and web applications</li><li>Member(s) of the team have experience using automated testing frameworks</li><li>Member(s) of the team have experience with modern development and operations (DevOps) techniques like continuous integration and continuous deployment</li><li>Member(s) of the team have experience securing digital services</li><li>A Federal contracting officer is on the internal team if a third party will be used for development work</li><li>A Federal budget officer is on the internal team or is a partner</li><li>The appropriate privacy, civil liberties, and/or legal advisor for the department or agency is a partner</li></ol></div><div><h2>Choose a modern technology stack</h2><p>The technology decisions we make need to enable development teams to work efficiently and enable services to scale easily and cost-effectively. Our choices for hosting infrastructure, databases, software frameworks, programming languages and the rest of the technology stack should seek to avoid vendor lock-in and match what successful modern consumer and enterprise software companies would choose today. In particular, digital services teams should consider using open source, cloud-based, and commodity solutions across the technology stack, because of their widespread adoption and support by successful consumer and enterprise technology companies in the private sector.</p><ol><li>Choose software frameworks that are commonly used by private-sector companies creating similar services</li><li>Whenever possible, ensure that software can be deployed on a variety of commodity hardware types</li><li>Ensure that each project has clear, understandable instructions for setting up a local development environment, and that team members can be quickly added or removed from projects</li></ol><ul><li>What is your development stack and why did you choose it?</li><li>Which databases are you using and why did you choose them?</li><li>How long does it take for a new team member to start contributing?</li></ul></div><div><h2>Deploy in a flexible hosting environment</h2><p>Our services should be deployed on flexible infrastructure, where resources can be provisioned in real-time to meet spikes in traffic and user demand.

They use automated performance tests which simulate surges in traffic to identify performance bottlenecks. While manual tests and quality assurance are still necessary, automated tests provide consistent and reliable protection against unintentional regressions, and make it possible for developers to confidently release frequent updates to the service.</p><ol><li>Create automated tests that verify all user-facing functionality</li><li>Create unit and integration tests to verify modules and components</li><li>Run tests automatically as part of the build process</li><li>Perform deployments automatically with deployment scripts, continuous delivery services, or similar techniques</li><li>Conduct load and performance tests at regular intervals, including before public launch</li></ol><ul><li>What percentage of the code base is covered by automated tests?</li><li>How long does it take to build, test, and deploy a typical bug fix?</li><li>How long does it take to build, test, and deploy a new feature into production?</li><li>How frequently are builds created?</li><li>What test tools are used?</li><li>Which deployment automation or continuous integration tools are used?</li><li>What is the estimated maximum number of concurrent users who will want to use the system?</li><li>How many simultaneous users could the system handle, according to the most recent capacity test?</li><li>How does the service perform when you exceed the expected target usage volume?

This is typically a process of continuous review and improvement which should be built into the development and maintenance of the service. At the start of designing a new service or feature, the team lead should engage the appropriate privacy, security, and legal officer(s) to discuss the type of information collected, how it should be secured, how long it is kept, and how it may be used and shared. The sustained engagement of a privacy specialist helps ensure that personal data is properly managed. In addition, a key process to building a secure service is comprehensively testing and certifying the components in each layer of the technology stack for security vulnerabilities, and then to re-use these same pre-certified components for multiple services.</p><p>The following checklist provides a starting point, but teams should work closely with their privacy specialist and security engineer to meet the needs of the specific service.</p><ol><li>Contact the appropriate privacy or legal officer of the department or agency to determine whether a System of Records Notice (SORN), Privacy Impact Assessment, or other review should be conducted</li><li>Determine, in consultation with a records officer, what data is collected and why, how it is used or shared, how it is stored and secured, and how long it is kept</li><li>Determine, in consultation with a privacy specialist, whether and how users are notified about how personal information is collected and used, including whether a privacy policy is needed and where it should appear, and how users will be notified in the event of a security breach</li><li>Consider whether the user should be able to access, delete, or remove their information from the service</li><li>“Pre-certify” the hosting infrastructure used for the project using FedRAMP</li><li>Use deployment scripts to ensure configuration of production environment remains consistent and controllable</li></ol><ul><li>Does the service collect personal information from the user?

This includes measuring how well a system performs and how people are interacting with it in real-time.

Like anything else, this is something you can make a habit of. Moving forward allows you to make progress. I don’t know about you, but I’ve frozen up in the past not knowing what the right path was for me. Moving forward, even the smallest possible step, helped break that stasis.</p><p>One habit I like is to ask for no, not yes. Note that this is based on my experience at small companies (&lt; 200 employees) where a lot of my experience has been. I’m not sure how it’d work in a big company, non-profit, or government.</p><p>When you have something you want to do and that you feel is in scope for your position, but you want a bit of reassurance or to let the boss know what you are up to, it’s common to reach out and ask them for permission. Don’t. Don’t ask for a yes. Instead, <strong>offer a chance to say no, but with a deadline</strong>.</p><p>Let’s see how this works.</p><p>Suppose I want to set up a new GitHub action that I feel will really improve the quality of our software. This isn’t whimsy, I’ve done some research and tested it locally. I may have even asked a former colleague how they used this GitHub action.</p><p>But I’m not quite sure. I want to let my boss know that I’ll be modifying the repository.</p><p>I could say “hey, boss, can we install action X? It’ll help with the XYZ problems we’ve been having.”</p><p>If you have a busy boss (and most people do), this is going to require a bit of work on their part to say “yes”.</p><p>They’ll want to review the XYZ problem, think about how X will solve it and maybe do some thinking or prioritization about how this fits in with other work. Or maybe they’ll want you to share what you know. It may fall off their plate. You will probably have to remind them a few times to get around to saying “yes”. It might be a more pressing issue for you</p><p>Now, let’s take the alternative approach.”Hey, boss, I am going to install action X, which should solve the XYZ problems we’ve been having. Will take care of this on Monday unless I hear differently from you.”</p><p>Do you see the change in tone?</p><p>You are saying (without being explicit) that you “got it” and are going to handle this issue. The boss can still weigh in if they want to, but they don’t have to. If they forget about it or other issues pop up, you still proceed. This lets you keep moving forward and solving problems while keeping the boss informed and allowing them to add their two cents if it is important enough.</p><p>You can also use this approach with a group of people.</p><p>By the way, the deadline is critical too. Which would you respond to more quickly, if it was Jan 15, all other things being equal and assuming a response was needed?</p><ul><li>“I’m going to do task X.”</li><li>“I’m going to do task X on Jan 17.”</li><li>“I’m going to do task X on Feb 15.”</li></ul><p>I would respond to the second one, which has a deadline in the near future. I think that is the way most folks work.</p><p>Again, pursue this approach for problems you feel are in the scope of your role but that you want to inform the boss about. It’s great when you want to  a chance for feedback, but you are confident enough in the course of action that you don’t  feedback.</p>","contentLength":3184,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43144611"},{"title":"Vine: A programming language based on Interaction Nets","url":"https://vine.dev/docs/","date":1740264216,"author":"todsacerdoti","guid":9421,"unread":true,"content":"<!DOCTYPE html>","contentLength":0,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43144040"},{"title":"Gig workers worked more but earned less in 2024: study","url":"https://www.businessinsider.com/uber-lyft-instacart-gig-workers-saw-earnings-fall-2024-2025-2","date":1740262923,"author":"wallflower","guid":9381,"unread":true,"content":"<ul><li>Gig workers for <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/uber-ceo-no-one-compete-against-tesla-elon-musk-2025-2\" data-autoaffiliated=\"false\" data-analytics-product-module=\"summary_bullets\" rel=\"\">Uber</a>, Instacart, and other services made less money for their time in 2024.</li><li>Even when delivery and ride-hailing drivers made more, their hours rose, too, a new report found.</li><li>Gig workers have said their jobs have gotten more competitive and less lucrative in recent years.</li></ul><p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/gig-drivers-pay-down-uber-lyft-doordash-gig-work-alternatives-2024-12#:~:text=Garin%20and%20other%20gig%20economy,some%20drivers%20to%20earn%20money.\" data-analytics-product-module=\"body_link\" rel=\"\">Gig workers</a> for Uber, Instacart, and other services made less money on average in 2024 — even as the number of hours that they worked rose, in some cases.</p><p>Uber hide-hailing drivers saw their earnings for 2024 fall 3.4% on average to $513 a week, according to a study released Tuesday by data analytics company <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://gridwise.io/\" data-analytics-product-module=\"body_link\" rel=\" nofollow\">Gridwise</a>.

Theo de Raadt. Jan 18, 2023.\n    </li><li>Some architectures now have non-readable code (\"xonly\"), both from\n\tthe perspective of userland reading its own memory, or the kernel\n\ttrying to read memory in a system call.  Many sloppy practices in\n\tuserland code had to be repaired to allow this.  The linker option\n\t is enabled by default. In order of\n\tdevelopment: arm64, riscv64, hppa, amd64,\n\tpowerpc64, powerpc (G5 only), octeon.\n\tsparc64 (sun4u only, unfinished).\n\tMark Kettenis, Theo de Raadt, Visa Hankala, Miod Vallat,\n\tDave Voutila, George Koehler in kernel and base, and\n\tTheo Buehler, Robert Nagy, Christian Weisgerber in ports.\n\tDec 2022 - Feb 2023, still ongoing.\n    </li><li>On all architectures which lack hardware-enforcement of xonly,\n\tsystem calls are now prevented from reading (via copyin/copyinst)\n\tinside the program's main text, ld.so text, sigtramp text, or\n\tlibc.so text.\n\tTheo de Raadt, Jan 2023.\n    </li><li>Architectures which lack xonly mmu-enforcement can still benefit\n\tfrom switching to --execute-only binaries if the cpu generates\n\tdifferent traps for instruction-fetch versus data-fetch.

The more icons we have to scan over, the more brain power we put toward making sense of them rather than using the tools they represent. This slows us down, not just once, but over and over again.\n</p><p>\nWhile it may feel duplicative to add a text label, the reality is that few icons are self-sufficient in communicating meaning.\n</p><h2>\nThe Problems that Icons Create\n</h2><p><b>1. Few icons communicate a clear, singular meaning immediately</b></p><p>\nIt’s easy to say that a  icon will communicate meaning — or that if an icon needs a text label, it’s not doing its job. But that doesn’t take into consideration the burden that icons —  or  — put on people trying to navigate interfaces.\n</p><p>\nEven the simplest icons can create ambiguity. While a trash can icon reliably communicates “delete,” what about the common pencil icon. Does it mean create? Edit? Write? Draw? Context can help with disambiguation, but not always, and that contextual interpretation requires additional cognitive effort.\n</p><p>\nWhen an icon’s meaning isn’t immediately clear, it slows down our orientation within an interface and the use of its features. Each encounter requires a split-second of processing that might seem negligible but accumulates across interactions.\n</p><p><b>2. The more icons within an interface, the more difficult it can be to navigate.</b></p><p>\nAs feature sets grow, we often resort to increasingly abstract or subtle visual distinctions between icons. What might have worked with 5-7 core functions becomes unmanageable at 15-20 features. Users must differentiate between various forms of creation, sharing, saving, and organizing - all through pictorial representation alone.\n</p><p>\nThe burden of communication increases for each individual icon as an interface’s feature set expands. It becomes increasingly difficult to communicate specific functions with icons alone, especially when distinguishing between similar actions like creating and editing, saving and archiving, or uploading and downloading.\n</p><p><b>3. Icons function as an interface-specific language within a broader ecosystem.</b></p><p>\nInterfaces operate within other interfaces. Your application may run within a browser that also runs within an operating system. Users must navigate multiple levels of interface complexity, most of which you cannot control. When creating bespoke icons, you force users to learn a new visual language while still maintaining awareness of established conventions.\n</p><p>\nThis creates particular challenges with standardized icon sets. When we use established systems like Google’s Material Design, an icon that represents one function in our interface might represent something entirely different in another application. This cross-context confusion adds to the cognitive load of icon interpretation.\n</p><h2>\nWhy Text Labeling Helps Your Interface\n</h2><p><b>1. Text alone is usually more efficient.</b></p><p>\nOur brains process familiar words holistically rather than letter-by-letter, making them incredibly efficient information carriers. We’ve spent our lives learning to recognize words instantly, while most app icons require new visual vocabulary.\n</p><p>\nScanning text is fundamentally easier than scanning icons. A stacked list of text requires only a one-directional scan (top-to-bottom), while icon grids demand bi-directional scanning (top-to-bottom and left-to-right). This efficiency becomes particularly apparent in mobile interfaces, where similar-looking app icons can create a visually confusing grid.\n</p><p><b>2. Text can make icons more efficient.</b></p><p>\nThe example above comes from <a href=\"http://www.magnolia-made.com\" target=\"_blank\">Magnolia</a>, an application I designed. On the left is the side navigation panel without labels. On the right is the same panel with text labels. Magnolia is an extremely niche tool with highly specific features that align with the needs of research and planning teams who develop account briefs. Without the labels, the people who we created Magnolia for would likely find the navigation system confusing.\n</p><p>\nAdding text labels to icons serves two purposes: it clarifies meaning and provides greater creative freedom. When an icon’s meaning is reinforced by text, users can scan more quickly and confidently. Additionally, designers can focus more on the unity of their interface’s visual language when they’re not relying on icons alone to communicate function.\n</p><p><b>3. Icons are effective anchors in text-heavy applications.</b></p><p>\nAbove is another example from <a href=\"http://www.magnolia-made.com\" target=\"_blank\">Magnolia</a>. Notice how the list of options on the right (Export, Regenerate, and History) stands out because of the icons, but the text labels make it immediately clear what these things do.\n</p><p>\nSee, this isn’t an argument for eliminating icons entirely. Icons serve an important role as visual landmarks, helping to differentiate functional areas from content areas. Especially in text-heavy applications, icons help pull the eye toward interactive elements.\n</p><p>\nThe combination of icon and text label creates clearer affordances than either element alone.\n</p><p>\nEvery time we choose between an icon and a text label, we’re making a choice about cognitive load. We’re deciding how much mental energy people will spend interpreting our interfaces rather than using them. While a purely iconic interface might seem simple and more attractive, it often creates an invisible tax on attention and understanding.\n</p><p>\nThe solution, of course, isn’t found in a “perfect” icon, nor in abandoning icons entirely. Icons remain powerful tools for creating visual hierarchy and differentiation. Instead, we need to be more thoughtful about when and how we deploy them. The best interfaces recognize that icons and text aren’t competing approaches but complementary tools that work best in harmony.\n</p><p>\nThis means considering not just the immediate context of our own interfaces, but the broader ecosystem in which they exist. Our applications don’t exist in isolation — they’re part of a complex digital environment where users are constantly switching between different contexts, each with its own visual language.\n</p><p>\nThe next time you’re tempted to create yet another icon, or to remove text labels, remember: the most elegant solution isn’t always the one that  simple — it’s the one that makes communication and understanding  simple.\n</p><img width=\"30\" src=\"https://www.chrbutler.com/public/icons/asterisk.svg\"><a href=\"https://www.chrbutler.com/tagged/essays\"></a>","contentLength":6315,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43142989"},{"title":"September 17, 1787: \"A Republic, If You Can Keep It\"","url":"https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/constitutionalconvention-september17.htm","date":1740254284,"author":"037","guid":9318,"unread":true,"content":"<b><i>Monday, September 17, 1787: The Convention Today</i></b><p paraeid=\"{892b154e-8c25-42d0-8da8-ae2aec71512f}{32}\" paraid=\"1682256536\">The day began with a prepared speech from Franklin (PA) who, eighty-one years old and painfully afflicted with gout and kidney stone, was unable to read it himself and delegated that task to Wilson (PA). </p><p paraeid=\"{892b154e-8c25-42d0-8da8-ae2aec71512f}{46}\" paraid=\"1054480062\">While the speech was formally addressed to Washington (VA), the Convention’s president, its purpose was to convince the three delegates who had announced their refusal to sign the Constitution—Gerry (MA), Randolph (VA), and Mason (VA)—to abandon their opposition. Franklin began on a note of humility. “I confess that there are several parts of this Constitution which I do not at present approve, but I am not sure I shall never approve them. For having lived long, I have experienced many instances of being obliged by better information, or fuller consideration, to change opinions even on important subjects, which I once thought right, but found to be otherwise. It is therefore that, the older I grow, the more apt I am to doubt my own judgment, and to pay more respect to the judgment of others.” </p><p paraeid=\"{892b154e-8c25-42d0-8da8-ae2aec71512f}{80}\" paraid=\"1831610571\">“In these sentiments, Sir, I agree to this Constitution, with all its faults, if they are such; because I think a General Government necessary for us, and there is no form of government, but what may be a blessing to the people if well administered; and believe further, that this is likely to be well administered for a course of years, and can only end in despotism, as other forms have done before it, when the people shall become so corrupted as to need despotic government.”  </p><p paraeid=\"{892b154e-8c25-42d0-8da8-ae2aec71512f}{90}\" paraid=\"1258863415\">He didn’t think another Convention (which Mason and Randolph had argued for) would do any better than the first had. He admitted that the men in the room were all well-reasoned and had a diversity of opinions, making it difficult to find common ground. “From such an assembly can a perfect production be expected? It therefore astonishes me, sir, to find this system approaching so near to perfection as it does.... Thus I consent, Sir, to this Constitution, because I expect no better, and because I am not sure, that it is not the best.” </p><p paraeid=\"{892b154e-8c25-42d0-8da8-ae2aec71512f}{114}\" paraid=\"157634583\">“On the whole, Sir, I cannot help expressing a wish that every member of the Convention, who may still have objections to it, would with me, on this occasion, doubt a little of his own infallibility, and to make manifest our unanimity, put his name to this instrument.” </p><p paraeid=\"{892b154e-8c25-42d0-8da8-ae2aec71512f}{120}\" paraid=\"2117331119\">Franklin then moved for the form of the signing to be such: “Done in Convention by the unanimous consent of the States present, the seventeenth of September, &amp;c. In witness whereof, we have hereunto subscribed our names.” </p><p paraeid=\"{892b154e-8c25-42d0-8da8-ae2aec71512f}{130}\" paraid=\"972683271\">This form had actually been thought up by Gouverneur Morris (PA), who had given it to Franklin so that Franklin’s esteem would lend it credence. The wording of the form doesn’t explicitly state that the signer is endorsing the Constitution. It only means that the signer is affirming that the states present in the Convention unanimously approved the Constitution. The idea was to get Gerry, Mason, and Randolph to sign by making their personal objections irrelevant to their signatures. </p><p paraeid=\"{892b154e-8c25-42d0-8da8-ae2aec71512f}{150}\" paraid=\"729640072\">Gorham (MA) then motioned for Congress to be given the power to increase the size of the House of Representatives from one representative for every 40,000 people to one for every 30,000. (Mind that Congress would not have been required to increase the House to such a size, but just given the option to do so.) Proposals such as this one had repeatedly failed, but King (MA) and Carroll (MD) seconded him. </p><p paraeid=\"{892b154e-8c25-42d0-8da8-ae2aec71512f}{164}\" paraid=\"1319186782\">Now, on this last day of the Convention, Washington (VA) spoke for the only time. While he said it was typically inappropriate for him, as president of the Convention, to offer his opinion, he felt called to support Gorham’s motion. He thought increasing the size of the House of Representatives would increase the “security of the rights and the interests of the people.” After Washington’s speech, no one spoke in opposition to the motion, and it passed unanimously. Jacob Shallus, the scribe who had the day before handwritten the engrossed copy of the Constitution, corrected the text to reflect this final amendment. </p><p paraeid=\"{892b154e-8c25-42d0-8da8-ae2aec71512f}{198}\" paraid=\"1378118405\">Randolph gave a brief speech where (much like one from two days earlier) he was almost apologetic about refusing to sign the Constitution, but left open the possibility that he might support the Constitution when Virginia considered ratifying it. He stated, “Nine States [the minimum number for the Constitution to take effect] will fail to ratify the plan, and confusion must ensue.” </p><p paraeid=\"{892b154e-8c25-42d0-8da8-ae2aec71512f}{216}\" paraid=\"2102259563\">G. Morris and Williamson (NC) gave speeches encouraging the holdouts to sign. Hamilton (NY) spoke similarly, with Madison (VA) summarizing him thus: “No man’s ideas were more remote from the plan than his own were known to be; but is it possible to deliberate between anarchy and convulsion on one side, and the chance of good to be expected from the plan on the other?” </p><p paraeid=\"{892b154e-8c25-42d0-8da8-ae2aec71512f}{228}\" paraid=\"1828567102\">Blount (NC) stated that his signature should not be taken as a sign of his support for the Constitution but just as his affirmation that the Constitution had been unanimously approved by the states at the Convention. </p><p paraeid=\"{892b154e-8c25-42d0-8da8-ae2aec71512f}{244}\" paraid=\"18537606\">Franklin gave a second speech where he personally begged Randolph to sign. Randolph said that Franklin’s proposed form for the signatures didn’t make a difference: signing the Constitution would imply that he supported it, and he didn’t. Madison writes that “He [Randolph] repeated, that, in refusing to sign the Constitution, he took a step which might be the most awful of his life; but it was dictated by his conscience, and it was not possible for him to hesitate, — much less, to change.” Randolph thought that presenting the Constitution to the American people to only accept or reject in total, without amendments, would cause all the “anarchy and civil convulsions” which the soon-to-be signers professed to want to avoid. Gerry gave a speech to the same effect. </p><p paraeid=\"{01b48b25-d4db-49ae-94c9-8e9c2c527693}{9}\" paraid=\"1168694754\">Charles Cotesworth Pinckney (SC) did not like the ambiguity in Franklin’s proposed form for the signatures. He supported the Constitution and intended his signature to be a sign of that support. </p><p paraeid=\"{01b48b25-d4db-49ae-94c9-8e9c2c527693}{19}\" paraid=\"2066198772\">Ingersoll (PA) took a middle position: his signature would not indicate his support for the Constitution, but neither would it merely be his attestation to the Convention’s unanimity. His signature would be his “recommendation” that the Convention’s final product, “all things considered, was the most eligible.” </p><p paraeid=\"{01b48b25-d4db-49ae-94c9-8e9c2c527693}{45}\" paraid=\"1837245824\">Franklin’s motion (related to the form of the signing) passed 10–1, with South Carolina’s vote divided on account of C.C. Pinckney and Butler wanting the form to be more emphatically supportive. </p><p paraeid=\"{01b48b25-d4db-49ae-94c9-8e9c2c527693}{55}\" paraid=\"2006718381\">The Convention then voted to deposit their official journals (which ended up being much less detailed than Madison’s personal notes) with Washington.  </p><p paraeid=\"{01b48b25-d4db-49ae-94c9-8e9c2c527693}{61}\" paraid=\"611006880\">The delegates then proceeded to sign the engrossed copy of the United States Constitution. Thirty-eight men signed thirty-nine names—Dickinson (DE) was ailing with a headache and had asked Read (DE) to sign for him two days earlier. Despite so many personal appeals, Gerry, Randolph, and Mason still refused to sign. Hamilton, as the only New Yorker present at this point, signed in a personal capacity, since New York could not be effectively represented in the Convention by only one delegate. The signatures were grouped by state, with Pennsylvania’s eight being the most. The listing of state names next to the signatures appears to be in the hand of Hamilton. Rhode Island, the only state not to send delegates to the Convention, is not listed. </p><p paraeid=\"{01b48b25-d4db-49ae-94c9-8e9c2c527693}{95}\" paraid=\"328781109\">After the signing, the Convention adjourned for a final time. </p><p paraeid=\"{01b48b25-d4db-49ae-94c9-8e9c2c527693}{101}\" paraid=\"2133607111\">The signatures did not have any legal significance. The Constitution was clear: it would only go into effect when nine of the thirteen states chose to ratify it. As hard as the past four months had been, the real challenge lay ahead, in convincing the American people to embrace the government that these men had authored. </p><p paraeid=\"{01b48b25-d4db-49ae-94c9-8e9c2c527693}{111}\" paraid=\"401102845\">As the last names were being signed, Franklin, in a personal aside to some other members, made an observation about the chair that Washington had been sitting in as he presided over the Convention. The chair had an emblem of half of a sun. Franklin noted that artists often have a hard time distinguishing between a rising and a setting sun in their artwork. “I have often and often, in the course of the session, and the vicissitudes of my hopes and fears as to its issue, looked at that behind the President, without being able to tell whether it was rising or setting: but now at length, I have the happiness to know, that it is a rising and not a setting sun.” </p>","contentLength":8579,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43142572"},{"title":"Utah Bill Aims to Make Officers Disclose AI-Written Police Reports","url":"https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2025/02/utah-bill-aims-make-officers-disclose-ai-written-police-reports","date":1740253986,"author":"hn_acker","guid":9379,"unread":true,"content":"<p><a href=\"https://www.popsci.com/technology/utah-ai-police-bill/\"></a><a href=\"https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2024/05/what-can-go-wrong-when-police-use-ai-write-reports\"></a></p><p><a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en/article/axon-acquires-fusus-ai-surveillance-retail-healthcare/\"></a><a href=\"https://www.police1.com/police-products/police-technology/software/report-writing/revolutionizing-police-report-writing-axons-draft-one-transforms-the-tedious-into-the-effortless\"></a><a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2021/12/08/police-reform-body-cameras-axon-motorola/\"></a></p><p><a href=\"https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2019/04/content-moderation-broken-let-us-count-ways\"></a></p><p><a href=\"https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2024/03/how-avoid-ai-apocalypse-one-easy-step\"></a></p><p><a href=\"https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2024/10/prosecutors-washington-state-warn-police-dont-use-gen-ai-write-reports\"></a></p>","contentLength":0,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43142518"},{"title":"The Birth of Chipzilla","url":"https://www.abortretry.fail/p/the-birth-of-chipzilla","date":1740251041,"author":"rbanffy","guid":9586,"unread":true,"content":"<p><em>I do not expect to join any company which is simply a manufacturer of semiconductors. I would rather try to find some small company which is trying to develop some product or technology which no one has yet done. To stay independent (and small) I might form a new company, after a vacation.</em></p><p><em> just called me on the phone. We'd been friends for a long time. Documents? There was practically nothing. Noyce's reputation was good enough. We put out a page-and-a-half little circular, but I'd raised the money even before people saw it.</em></p><p>Intel’s structure in these early days had Rock as Chairman, Noyce as CEO, Moore as Executive VP, Grove as director of engineering, and Vadász as the director of MOS design.</p><p>Before the company could begin operations, they needed a place to work. Over on Middlefield Road in Mountain View, Union Carbide was vacating a building. They’d really just begun that process, but a conference room was available. Intel rented it. As Intel took over the building, Moore felt the space was larger than what they really needed, but whether he was right or wrong, that wouldn’t be the case for too long. Official operations of Intel began in August of 1968.</p><p>For Intel’s first few months, the company had quite a bit of work. They needed to build a manufacturing process, figure out their product line, and hire enough people to get products made and sold. This involved them needing to build Fab1 as quickly as possible. The goal was to get things done by the end of December, and this meant that they wouldn’t be building every tool they needed. At Wescon, they actually bought some equipment right off the show floor. A few things had to be adapted to meet their needs, but most of their equipment wasn’t made by them. This wasn’t solely due to the timing constraints either. The founders of Intel had learned from their prior experiences in this industry. While a single company might be able to innovate in some areas, it wasn’t long before competitors replicated that success. Then, those competitors would also be iterating and innovating. A single company had a limited customer base, but the market as a whole was larger and innovations could come from anywhere. They wanted everyone’s expertise, so they bought what they could from whomever had the best tools. Moore worked closely with Intel’s suppliers, and he even made some investments in them personally. </p><p>While Moore, Noyce, and Rock felt little fear at Intel, this wasn’t true for Grove. At Fairchild, Grove had been strictly R&amp;D. He didn’t really see the rest of the company, and he’d been hired by Moore out of graduate school. At Intel, he had the chance to really see the entire company and its operations. He constantly feared that the company would go bankrupt, but perhaps as a result of that fear, he became quite focused on manufacturing. He wanted the company to be able to do the same things every day to make a uniform product successfully, affordably, and reliably. He quickly began handle much of the company’s operations. The team that was assembled to undertake these early efforts was phenomenal, and Intel met its goal completing the Fab1 setup by the 31st of December.</p><p>Before Fab1 was even completed, Noyce had visited Sharp in Japan. They spoke Tadashi Sasaki with the hope of gaining (at least some of) the company’s business for ICs. Sasaki then asked Rockwell, who did their manufacturing work, if they could give Intel some of their business, and Rockwell said no; they wanted to enforce their contract’s exclusivity. Sasaki then invested 40 million yen into his friends Yoshio Kojima’s company, Bijikon Kabushiki-gaisha (or Busicom), in Nara, Japan which gave him quite a bit of influence there, and allowed him to work on a CMOS calculator with Intel. Marcian Edward Hoff Jr (or Ted), Intel employee twelve, was the person initially tasked with this project on the Intel side of things. He worked as both an engineer and the liaison between the two companies.</p><p>In April of 1969, Intel released the 3101 SRAM. The 3101 held 64 bits of data (eight letters of sixteen digits), and sold for $99.50 (about $850 in 2025 dollars). Even at this time, the chip had far too little storage capacity to be useful as main memory (especially with its high price), but it was incredibly fast with an access time of fifty nanoseconds and it dissipated just six milliwatts per bit. With the chip’s high speed, low power draw, and small size, it was quite useful for processor registers in minicomputers and mainframes. The company had been hoping to gain a Honeywell contract with the 3101. That didn’t happen, but the chip was moderately successful. This chip was, in fact, successful enough that Intel’s work with Busicom fell on the back burner.</p><p>Busicom had initially provided Intel with a twelve chip, PMOS, decimal arithmetic design for their calculator hardware, and by June, Masatoshi Shima had refined this to seven chips. He didn’t have a full schematic, but it was something to work with. Shima then visited Intel in June with two other Busicom engineers. When Shima arrived, he was a bit dismayed. Almost no progress had been made, and he discovered that Intel had some serious expertise in hardware and memory design, but they didn’t have any serious expertise in logic design. Stan Mazor began to act as a buffer between Shima and Hoff, and over three months, there were many meetings about the design, but almost no progress.</p><p>At this time, Intel was just a memory company. They had packaging to accommodate early memories and nothing more. This limited the design of the chips to 4bit allowing the chip to fit in a 16-pin or 18-pin DIP. These restrictions were not initially given to Busicom, but Hoff knew them, and they influenced what he presented. Unknown to Intel, Sasaki had also come up with a four chip design and gave this to Busicom. With both sides now agreeing to a four chip design, it would seem that things could have progressed, but unknown to Busicom, no more progress would be made that year.</p><p>In July of 1969, Intel released the 1101. This was first MOS memory chip. The 1101 was slower than the 3101, but had a capacity of 256 bits, used silicon gates, and allowed for far higher memory densities than had previously been possible.</p><p>In December of 1969, CTC provided Intel the CPU requirements and preliminary designs for a processor they planned to use in their Datapoint 2200 terminal. Intel was then supposed to implement these in LSI. At Intel this project became the 1201, but much like the Busicom project, it wasn’t given any priority. Intel was a memory company. Frustrated, CTC turned to Texas Instruments who also failed, and CTC eventually built the processor out of discreet components.</p><p>For 1969, Intel ended the year with revenues of $565,874 and a loss for the year of $1,912,833 which meant a loss per share of $1.66. While this sounds terrible, the company had set expectations that this would more or less be the case.</p><p>Back on the Busicom project, Hoff eventually brought a proposal chip design to Shima that would use a general purpose 4bit CPU with binary logic, a ROM chip, and a RAM chip. Shima then added a 10bit static shift register for use with the printer and keyboard interface of the calculator. They improved the instruction set, the bus, and by December of 1969, Shima was able to write the functional specification. The agreement for Intel to build the chips was officially entered into on the 6th of February in 1970.</p><p>In April of 1970, Federico Faggin joined Intel after having left Fairchild. He’d previously worked with Vadász at Fairchild, and his skills, especially his having developed silicon gate technology, were well known to the executives at Intel. Their company was essentially based upon Faggin’s work. Given both Faggin’s background and Intel’s needs, his request to work on chip design was immediately accepted. Faggin now had just six months to produce working silicon from a specification, and he didn’t have anyone to help him in the endeavor. Shima returned to Intel just a few days later and was rather unhappy to discover that effectively zero further work had been done on the calculator chips. Faggin started working 12 to 16 hours each day. This was particularly hard for him given he had a month old daughter at home and a loving wife. During this time, his wife went to Italy with her sister as he couldn’t be around to help. I am sure that Faggin somewhat enjoyed the work, but the hours, the pace, the separation from his family, and the deadline were probably dreadful. Adding to this, when Faggin reviewed the specification, he thought it to be a poor design. There was much that he wished to change, but he didn’t have the time. More over, when he asked questions, he was told that this was his project and he simply needed to figure it out. He verified that the architecture was free of errors, but otherwise didn’t change it. He had too much to do. There was still logic design to be done, circuit design, layout, cutting, masking, initial fabrication, testing, fixing any problems found in testing, and then the tasks related to production.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.abortretry.fail/p/work-at-the-mill\" rel=\"\">PDP-11</a></p><p>In December of 1970, the Busicom chips came back for testing. None of them worked. Faggin began checking them with a microscope, and he realized that one of the masks hadn’t been applied. He noted this, and requested another run of chips be made. Those came back three weeks later. In January of 1971, Federico Faggin completed testing of the first single-chip microprocessor ever made. It was his second self-designed computer, but this one was built with multiple technologies he had pioneered. He was just 29 years old. The four chips he created were the 4001, 4002, 4003, and the 4004. The 4001 was a ROM of 256 bytes with a built-in 4bit I/O port. The 4002 was a RAM chip of 40 bytes, which would, in this case, hold 80 4bit words. The 4003 was a 10bit shift register, and in the system for which this chip was designed, it would handle the keyboard and printer. The Intel 4004 was a 4bit microprocessor that ran at 750kHz. It was built of 2300 transistors on a 10 micron process and packaged in a 16-pin DIP. It used 8bit instructions, had 4bit data words, and 12bit addressing. This rather unusual arrangement meant that the 4004 could address 4120 bits of RAM which would mean 1280 4bit characters. It could address 32768 bits of ROM which would mean 4096 8bit words. The 4004 had 46 instructions and 16 registers.</p><p>Intel’s revenues for 1970 were $3,932,517 but the company posted another loss (though far smaller) of $969,915 which meant a loss of $0.69 per share.</p><p>1971 was a big year. The Intel employee head count hit 460, the 4004 became available, the 1103 was selling well, and the company released the 1601 in January. The 1601 was the first commercially available PROM built on P-channel silicon gate MOS. The company also began selling fully assembled circuit boards populated with memory chips for mainframes and minicomputers. Intel completed the build out a new headquarters of 78,000 square feet in Santa Clara providing them about three times the space they had previously. This, naturally, allowed them to dramatically increase production. Unlike the previous location, the Santa Clara location had chemical and solvent disposal systems in place from day one preventing this from later becoming a superfund site. In September, Intel released the first EPROM, the 1701. This was an improvement over the 1601 in that it could be reprogrammed. The package had a black plastic cover over the chip. With that cover removed, shining ultra violet light on the chip would erase it and allow it to be programmed again. All of these factors combined allowed Intel to post its first profit at $1,015,080 on revenues of $9,411,821. Share holders saw $0.17 earned on each share.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.abortretry.fail/p/the-q1\" rel=\"\">Q1 Corporation</a></p><p>Of course, Intel now had Faggin. Immediately after wrapping up the 4004, he was tasked with bringing this new 8bit design into the world, and essentially all of the problems from the 4004 project were present. The design wasn’t great, he had very little time, and he had very little staff. The 1201 became the Intel 8008 which was made available commercially in April of 1972. The 8008 was an 8 bit CPU with a 14 bit address width. It was manufactured on a 10 micron process and built of 3500 transistors. It was packaged in an 18-pin DIP, which resulted in 30 TTL chips being required to interface memory and I/O. This packaging was dictated by Grove and Vadász despite protest against it and meant that the chip did not perform as well as it could have otherwise. The 8008 could achieve around 29,000 operations per second. True to his word, Alroy bought a bunch of 8008s and delivered the world’s first complete, pre-assembled, commercially produced, microcomputer system to the Litcom Division of Litton Industries on Long Island on the 11th of December in 1972.</p><p>In June of 1973, Intel introduced the Intellec 4 and the Intellec 8 microcomputers at the National Computer Conference in the New York Coliseum. These were sold to software and hardware developers in limited numbers. For the Intellec 8, the price started at $2395. These machines had resident monitors in ROM and they had a PL/M compiler (also a new product). The Intellec series supported a teletype at 110 baud, paper tape, and glass teletypes at 1200 baud. The Intellec 4 shipped with 1K RAM and could support up to 4K instruction RAM. Data memory was just 320 4bit words, and could be expanded to 2560 words. The 8, on the other hand, shipped with 5K RAM and could support up to 16K. These machines were offered either as boards or as fully assembled rack-mountable units with front panel and power supply. The fully assembled systems weighed in at 31 pounds.</p><p>Shortly after the release of the 8008, Federico Faggin began pushing for a new general purpose processor that wouldn’t have the same limitations as the 8008. Intel had developed a new N-channel MOS process for 4K DRAM, and this is what Faggin wanted to use. He also wanted a new bus architecture, a new interrupt structure, more instructions, and a 40-pin DIP; all while keeping the chip source-code compatible with the 8008. He wanted the instruction cycle time to be 2 microseconds which would put the product within the realm occupied by minicomputers. Approval took time but once he had it, Faggin hired Masatoshi Shima to help with logic design and firmware. </p><p>Throughout 1973, the company introduced various memory chips, support chips for memories and processors, and even an LCD driver. Revenues for the year were $65,593,000 and profit was $9,214,000 or $2.12 per share.</p><p><em>The 4004 and 8008 suggested it, but the 8080 made it real</em></p><p><a href=\"https://www.abortretry.fail/p/the-last-word-in-integrated-logic\" rel=\"\">Zilog</a></p><p>Despite a rough second half of the year, Intel still faced little danger. All of their debts had been paid, they owned their facilities with no mortgages, they owned all of their production equipment, and they required no equity financing having nearly $2 million in cash. In December of 1974, the company announced that Gordon Moore would become president and CEO, Robert Noyce would become chairman of the board, Arthur Rock would become vice chairman, Ed Gelbach would become senior vice president and general manager of the components division, Jack Carsten the vice president of marketing, Gene Flath the vice president of manufacturing, Les Vadász the vice president of engineering, and finally, Andrew Grove would become executive vice president. The company had grown and the restructuring was necessary, and it positioned Intel quite well for the changes and challenges yet to come.</p><p>I now have readers from many of the companies whose history I cover, and many of you were present for time periods I cover.

His response: “If it happens, it won’t be a smart contract, it’ll be an operational security issue.”</p><p>Today, that prediction was validated.</p><p>On February 21, 2025, cryptocurrency exchange <a href=\"https://x.com/gauthamzzz/status/1893004593979859410\">Bybit suffered the largest cryptocurrency theft</a> in history when attackers stole approximately $1.5B from their multisig cold storage wallet. At this time, it appears the attackers compromised multiple signers’ devices, manipulated what signers saw in their wallet interface, and collected the required signatures while the signers believed they were conducting routine transactions.</p><p>This hack is one of many that represent a dramatic shift in how centralized exchanges are compromised. For years, the industry has focused on hardening code and improving their technical security practices, but as the ecosystem’s secure development life cycle has matured, attackers have shifted to targeting the human and operational elements of cryptocurrency exchanges and other organizations.</p><p>These attacks reveal an escalating pattern, with each compromise building on the last:</p><p>In each case, the attackers didn’t exploit smart contract or application-level vulnerabilities. Instead, they compromised the computers used to manage those systems using sophisticated malware to manipulate what users saw versus what they actually signed.</p><h2>The DPRK’s Cryptocurrency Theft Infrastructure</h2><p>The attack chain typically begins with <a href=\"https://github.blog/security/vulnerability-research/security-alert-social-engineering-campaign-targets-technology-industry-employees/\">aggressive social engineering campaigns</a> targeting multiple employees simultaneously within an organization. The RGB identifies key personnel in system administration, software development, and treasury roles, then creates detailed pretexts - often elaborate job recruitment schemes - customized to each target’s background and interests. These aren’t mass phishing campaigns; they’re meticulously crafted approaches designed to compromise specific individuals with access to critical systems.</p><p>What makes these attacks particularly concerning is their repeatability. The RGB has built a sophisticated cross-platform toolkit that can:</p><ul><li>Operate seamlessly across Windows, MacOS, and various wallet interfaces</li><li>Show minimal signs of compromise while maintaining persistence</li><li>Function as backdoors to execute arbitrary commands</li><li>Download and execute additional malicious payloads</li><li>Manipulate what users see in their interfaces</li></ul><p><a href=\"https://github.com/tayvano/lazarus-bluenoroff-research\">Each successful compromise</a> has allowed the RGB to refine their tools and techniques. They’re not starting from scratch with each target - they’re executing a tested playbook that’s specifically engineered to defeat standard cryptocurrency security controls when those controls are used in isolation.</p><p>Organizations below a certain security threshold are now at serious risk. Without comprehensive security controls including:</p><ul><li>Air-gapped signing systems</li><li>Multiple layers of transaction verification</li><li>Endpoint detection and response (EDR) systems like CrowdStrike or SentinelOne</li><li>Regular security training and war games</li></ul><p>They are likely to face an adversary that has already built and tested the exact tools needed to defeat their existing protections.</p><h2>The New Reality of Cryptocurrency Security</h2><p>This attack highlights a fundamental truth: no single security control, no matter how robust, can protect against sophisticated attackers targeting operational security. While secure code remains crucial, it must be part of a comprehensive security strategy.</p><p>Organizations must adopt new processes and controls that operate under the assumption that their infrastructure will eventually face compromise:</p><ol><li><strong>Infrastructure Segmentation:</strong> Critical operations like transaction signing require both physical and logical separation from day-to-day business operations. This isolation ensures that a breach of corporate systems cannot directly impact signing infrastructure. Critical operations should use dedicated hardware, separate networks, and strictly controlled access protocols.</li><li> Security controls must work in concert - hardware wallets, multi-signature schemes, and transaction verification tools each provide important protections, but true security emerges from their coordinated operation. Organizations need multiple, overlapping controls that can detect and prevent sophisticated attacks.</li><li><strong>Organizational Preparedness:</strong> Technical controls must be supported by comprehensive security programs that include:<ul><li>Thorough threat modeling incorporating both technical and operational risks</li><li>Regular third-party security assessments of infrastructure and procedures</li><li>Well-documented and frequently tested incident response plans</li><li>Ongoing security awareness training tailored to specific roles</li><li>War games and attack simulations that test both systems and personnel</li></ul></li></ol><p>These principles aren’t new - they represent hard-won lessons from years of security incidents in both traditional finance and cryptocurrency. Trail of Bits has consistently advocated for this comprehensive approach to security, providing concrete guidance through several key publications:</p><p>These publications show a clear pattern that’s echoed by recent attacks: sophisticated attackers are increasingly targeting operational security vulnerabilities rather than technical flaws.</p><p>The cryptocurrency industry’s resistance to implementing traditional corporate security controls, combined with the high value of potential targets and this group’s sophisticated capabilities, suggests these attacks are likely to continue unless significant changes are made to how cryptocurrency companies approach operational security.</p><p>The Bybit hack marks a new era in cryptocurrency security. Industry participants need to recognize the evolving threat landscape and invest additional resources in improving their operational security. No one understands this reality better than the security researchers who have been tracking these attacks.</p><p>Tay <a href=\"https://twitter.com/tayvano_/status/1847877033701122395\">@tayvano_</a>, a renowned security researcher known for exposing on-chain thefts, dissecting DPRK crypto hacks, and fiercely advocating for better blockchain security practices, summarized the current reality bluntly:</p><blockquote><p>For all these reasons and more, it’s my opinion that once they get on your device, you’re fucked. The end.\nIf your keys are hot or in AWS, they fuck you immediately.\nIf they aren’t, they work slightly harder to fuck you.\nBut no matter what, you’re going to get fucked.</p></blockquote><p>Organizations must protect themselves through a comprehensive defense strategy combining isolation, verification, detection, and robust operational security controls. However, the time for basic security measures has passed. Organizations holding significant cryptocurrency assets must take immediate action:</p><ul><li>Implement dedicated, air-gapped signing infrastructure</li><li>Engage with security teams experienced in defending against sophisticated state actors</li><li>Build and regularly test incident response plans</li></ul><p>The next billion-dollar hack isn’t a matter of if, but when.

The screeching covers the audio signal we want to capture. </p><p>In 2019, my colleague Sam King built (with the help of his colleague Doug Smith) a cassette-lubricating machine while working at the Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies.

This leaves behind an extremely thin film of lubrication that allows smoother playback, making digitisation possible.

It is quite an amazing experience! From feeling of awe to emotion to deep excitement! The feeling of knowing that your language has been documented or recorded in a structured way, kept safely somewhere in the world, hearing it spoken 50–60 years ago and by some people you haven’t seen but whose names you only hear in history is quite incredible. It is most heartwarming to know that it is possible to sustain the life of my language.

Ron DeSantis focused on legal reforms making it harder to sue insurers.</p><p>“These companies are crying poverty in order to raise premiums or justify insolvency: ‘It’s litigation, it’s fraud,‘” Quinn said. “This is money shifting from their left pocket to the right, and crying poverty while their right pocket bulges.”</p><p>While the report is an incomplete picture of insurers' money,Florida’s Office of Insurance Regulation said in a statement, the study affirms that the reforms the office wants are warranted.</p><p>ButPaul Handerhan, founder of the trade group Federal Association for Insurance Reform, whose members include insurance companies,disputed the idea that executives were deliberately moving money around.</p><p>“This notion that they’re fleecing their policyholders and offshoring the money to their affiliates is just not happening,” Handerhan said. “None of these guys did this as a strategy.”</p><p>During debates in the Legislature over how best to respond to the insurance crisis between 2018 and 2023, some lawmakers asked what role affiliate companies played.</p><p>Rep. Hillary Cassel, R-Dania Beach, said lawmakers and observers had a lack of data about affiliates, known in the industry as “managing general agents,” when they were voting on legislation.</p><p>“All of us informed on the issues knew (managing general agents) were a problem,” said Cassel, a former lawyer for insurance companies who now sues them.</p><p>The Office of Insurance Regulation said in a statement that the study was not given to lawmakers because it was “not a formal examination report.”It was produced months before lawmakers met in emergency legislative sessions in 2022 and left in a “draft” status.</p><p>“Our office does not release every internal analysis of companies to the Legislature,” the office said.</p><p>The Times/Herald requested the report in November 2022, but the office did not turn over the executive summary until December 2024.</p><p>The affiliate structure is nothing new in Florida.</p><p>Profits of insurance companies are limited by regulators to about 4.5% — hardly enticing to investors, considering the risk of hurricanes.</p><p>However, insurance executives in Florida have used financial workarounds to reward investors and themselves.</p><p>While the profits and executive compensation of the insurance company are capped, the profits of affiliate and parent companies are not.</p><p>So executives create sister companies that charge the insurance company for basic services, such as claims handling, underwriting, accounting and issuing policies. (Large national insurers typically handle all of those services internally.)</p><p>Arrangements between insurance companies and affiliates must be approved by the state, and regulations say they must be “fair and reasonable,” which isn’t defined in state law.</p><p>When Southern Fidelity Insurance dissolved that year, it was <a href=\"https://myfloridacfo.com/docs-sf/rehabilitation-and-liquidation-libraries/rehab-documents/insolvency-reports/pc/southern-fidelity-insurance-company---2024.pdf?sfvrsn=52789be4_1\" target=\"_blank\">one of six companies under the same umbrella</a>, and its holdings included a hunting lodge maintained at a cost of $485,000 per year. State officials were investigating whether the company “took active measures to conceal these costs” from regulators, according to an October insolvency report.</p><p>That’s because the owner of the insurance company also owns the affiliates, creating an incentive for executives to overcharge the insurance company for services.</p><p>Still,it’s unlikely Floridaregulators knew the full scope of insurance money-shifting arrangements until 2021, when lawmakers <a href=\"http://laws.flrules.org/files/Ch_2021-077.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">gave them the ability</a> to demand more information from insurers and affiliates.</p><p>Using that power,the state’s then-commissioner, David Altmaier, paid a Connecticut-based consultantnearly $150,000to parse through the information the companies provided. Several companies turned over incomplete data, according to the study.</p><p>Between 2017 and 2019, the insurers in the study (minus a couple of outliers) showed a net loss of $432 million.</p><p>Their affiliate companies showed a net income of $1.8 billion.</p><p>With all 53 companies included, the industry recorded $61 million in net income, and affiliates made about $14 billion in net income, according to the study. Those figures likely include national carriers that also provide auto insurance.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25540452-affiliated-fee-analysis-executive-summary/\" target=\"_blank\">The author noted</a> that the affiliates of Florida-based companies were profitable even after they injected$485 million back into the insurers andwaived $208 million in fees during the three years, steps made to help keep the insurers afloat.</p><p>In the author’s opinion, 19 of the 30 Florida-based companies that provided data were paying feesto their affiliate companies that were “not fair and reasonable.”</p><p>The numbers in the study are “eye-popping” and raise questions about why regulators would allow such financial arrangements, said Birny Birnbaum, executive director of the Center for Economic Justice and a former chief economist at the Texas Department of Insurance.</p><p>“It’s unclear why (the Office of Insurance Regulation) isn’t doing anything about it,” Birnbaum said.</p><p>Regulators this year are asking lawmakers to define “fair and reasonable” to include the actual cost of the service provided, the overall health of the insurer and how much in dividends were paid out. Regulators asked for that in 2023 <a href=\"https://www.tampabay.com/news/florida-politics/2023/04/28/florida-legislature-insurance-insolvencies-premiums-profits/\" target=\"_blank\">but lawmakers rejected it</a>, claiming it would “upset the apple cart” of Florida’s insurance industry.</p><p>The office’s proposed legislation would also require fees to affiliates be paid in dollar amounts, instead of percentages. Affiliates will typically charge the insurance company fees of between 20% and 34% of premiums, which results in more money for the affiliates when premiums go up.</p><p>The office has canceled or modified some companies’ agreements.

It doesn't stem from having to work out the solutions to difficult problems. That takes careful thought, but it's the same kind of thought a novelist uses to organize a story or to write dialog that rings true. That kind of problem-solving is satisfying, even fun.</p><p>But that, unfortunately, is not what most programming is about. It's about trying to come up with a working solution in a problem domain that you don't fully understand and don't have time to understand.</p><p>It's about skimming <a href=\"https://prog21.dadgum.com/129.html\">great oceans of APIs</a> that you could spend years studying and learning, but the market will have moved on by then and that's no fun anyway, so you cut and paste from examples and manage to get by without a full picture of the architecture supporting your app.</p><p>It's about reading between the lines of documentation and guessing at how edge cases are handled and whether or not your assumptions will still hold true two months or two years from now.</p><p>It's about the constant evolutionary changes that occur in the language definition, the compiler, the libraries, the application framework, and the underlying operating system, that all snowball together and keep you in maintenance mode instead of making real improvements. </p><p>It's about getting derailed by hairline fractures in otherwise reliable tools, and apparently being the first person to discover that a PNG image with four bits-per-pixel and an alpha channel crashes the decoder, then having to work around that.</p><p>One approach is to dig in and power through all the obstacles. If you're fresh out of school, there are free Starbucks lattes down the hall, and all your friends are still at the office at 2 AM, too...well, that works. But then you have to do it again. And again. It's always a last second skid at 120 miles per hour with brakes smoking and tires shredding that makes all the difference between success and failure, but you pulled off another miracle and survived to do it again.</p><p>I still like to build things, and if there's no one else to do it, then I'll do it myself.

I don’t download them for security reasons.”</p><p>Apps have burrowed their way into seemingly every aspect of our lives and there are lots of reasons why companies are pushing us to use them. With an app, it is often “one click and you’re in”, rather than having to faff around online finding the website and remembering passwords. It is also for the “push notifications” that mobile apps send to grab our attention and get us to buy stuff. Many tech experts also argue that apps are generally more secure than websites and allow banks and others to carry out sophisticated ID verification using face, voice and fingerprint biometrics.</p><p>But millions of people who cannot afford a smartphone or have an older device that does not support some services are increasingly being locked out of deals, discounts and even some vital services, say digital exclusion and pro-cash campaigners.</p><p>They are missing out on everything from savings on their weekly shop, to some of the best interest rates for their cash. And not signing up to the app revolution is making activities including paying for parking and going to concerts increasingly challenging.</p><p>“It’s the tyranny of the apps,” says Ron Delnevo, the chair of the campaign committee at lobby group the <a href=\"https://www.paymentchoicealliance.org/\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">Payment Choice Alliance</a>. “In this country we’re being treated like sheep,” he says. “We’re always being told there’s no alternative.” But when a new smartphone can set you back hundreds of pounds, it is “an expensive passport to participate”, Delnevo says.</p><p>According to the latest data from the telecoms regulator Ofcom, 8% of people aged 16 or over do not have a smartphone, which for the UK translates into just under 4.5 million people. Among those aged 75-plus, the proportion is said to be 28%. Add in all those who don’t or can’t use apps and the total number of people affected is a lot bigger.</p><p>Lots of retailers offer enhanced or exclusive deals to their app users, and some run loyalty schemes through them. This is potentially a big deal as those schemes often give you access to discounts that are not otherwise available.</p><p>“Some people are missing out on lower prices offered by loyalty schemes as they do not have access to phones or smart devices to download apps,” Reena Sewraz, the retail editor at Which? says.</p><p>The consumer group is among those to have highlighted Lidl’s loyalty scheme, Lidl Plus, as one that is only accessible via an app, with an email address also required. That means the “big savings” available via the scheme’s weekly offers – at the time of writing these included 25% off tinned tuna and 20% off microwave rice and grain pouches – plus various coupons and rewards, are off-limits to those who cannot or do not wish to go digital.</p><p>Delnevo says Lidl is “disenfranchising” many of its customers, adding: “The people who probably need the discounts most are the people who can’t afford or don’t have a smartphone.”</p><p>In response, the supermarket chain says the Lidl Plus scheme “forms part of our commitment to providing customers with the best value. Nonetheless, we remain mindful of those who don’t have access to a smartphone or tablet and continue to offer in-store promotions through our ‘pick of the&nbsp;week’ offers.”</p><p>Rival supermarket Asda also runs a scheme, Asda Rewards, where you have to download an app and there is no physical card available. This scheme does not offer price promotions – instead, you earn Asda “pounds” when you shop, which you convert into vouchers to spend in-store and online.</p><p>Some retailers have gone further down the app path than others. The Boots Advantage card scheme, one of the UK’s most popular, still lets you use a physical plastic card, although there are “tailored offers” available via the app.</p><p>And at the bakery chain Greggs, you can collect loyalty “stamps” for free food and drink and&nbsp;get “exclusive app-only gifts”.&nbsp;You currently get a free hot drink just for downloading the app.</p><p>Meanwhile, the online clothes retailer Asos and the tools and hardware specialist Screwfix are just two of those that are or have recently been running “app exclusive” campaigns. Asos was this week offering 20% off “1,000s of styles,” while Screwfix’s Stacks of Rewards promotion let you collect coins and earn rewards by spending via the app.</p><p>If there is one area of life where many people probably feel the app revolution has got out of hand, it is parking. In the UK there are thought to be at least 30 different parking apps, and it is not unusual for an individual to have eight to 10 different ones on their phone.</p><p>Many older people have told the charity Age UK that they are “<a href=\"https://www.ageuk.org.uk/siteassets/documents/reports-and-publications/reports-and-briefings/offline-and-overlooked-report.pdf\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">at the end of their tether</a>” when it comes to paying for parking because they cannot park if an app or mobile is required. “In some cases this has meant missing important appointments like seeing their GP,”&nbsp;it adds.</p><p>The RAC’s head of policy, Simon Williams, says many people are overwhelmed by the multitude of apps they have to use, “when in reality you want one that you like and you’re happy using and that you can use everywhere”.</p><p>Six years ago the Department for Transport started developing a “national parking platform”&nbsp;(NPP) designed to enable drivers to use one app of their choice to pay for all their parking. It has been trialled by a number of councils, but a&nbsp;big question mark hangs over its future as public funding for the project looks likely to be withdrawn.</p><p>Some councils are now permanently getting rid of parking ticket machines that accept debit and credit cards in order to save money (many stopped accepting cash a long time ago).</p><p>The London borough of Barnet is one area where all the council pay and display machines at car parks have just been taken out of service. As of last month, motorists have been greeted with signs telling them to use the PayByPhone app.</p><p>“Withdrawal of the ability to pay by card, following the removal of the payment by cash facility, will disappoint some drivers, especially the elderly, who find it difficult to use the PayByPhone app,” according to <a href=\"https://www.barnetsociety.org.uk/barnet-council-planning-22-million-in-cuts-and-another-significant-hike-in-council-tax-to-tackle-spending-crisis\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">an article on the Barnet Society website</a>.</p><p>A Barnet council spokesperson says: “Pay and display machines were declining in use and in 2023-24 accounted for less than 7% of overall transactions. There are easy alternatives … including the PayByPhone app, phone or text, and cash payments at over 100 local&nbsp;PayPoint retailers.”</p><p>Increasingly with gigs and other events, you need to download an app to access your tickets.</p><p>For example, tickets for some events at the O2 arena in London are delivered as a “mobile ID” via the venue’s own app, and you get a barcode which is scanned to let you in.</p><p>This type of app-based mobile ID system is also billed as the only admission method at venues including Ovo Arena Wembley in London and University of Wolverhampton at The Halls.</p><p>That said, the venue websites do usually provide details of how people who do not have a smartphone or cannot download the app can gain entry to their event – but it might involve bringing photo ID and your confirmation email to the box office perhaps 90 minutes before the doors open.</p><p>When it comes to theatre, popular services such as TodayTix offer savings on tickets and can be accessed online, although to take advantage of some of the benefits and offers, such as discounted same-day “Rush” tickets, you need to have the app.</p><p>Those who cannot or do not use apps are missing out on some of the best deals for meals, takeaways and pub grub.</p><p>McDonald’s is running a high-profile promotion called Deal Drop, where it offers items at “bargain” prices, such as a classic Big Mac for £1.49 (normally £4.99) and a children’s Happy Meal for £1.99 (normally £3.59) – but all of the discounts are available exclusively with thecompany’s app.</p><p>The fastfood chain Subway runs a loyalty scheme where you earn points that you can convert into “Subway Cash” that can be spent on anything on the menu – but again it is app-only. If you were a member of Subway’s previous rewards scheme, which closed last May, your plastic membership card “is no longer usable”.</p><p>Similarly, many pubs have&nbsp;apps that offer big discounts or let you earn rewards. The more than 200-strong Sizzling Pubs chain has recently been promoting eye-catching app-only deals such as 40% off main meals at some locations.</p><p>Some coffee shop chains, such as Harris + Hoole, have also gone app-only with their loyalty schemes. With the Harris + Hoole one, you get a free drink for every six coffees you buy.</p><p>Some of the best savings rates are offered by app-only providers – made up of banks and “electronic money institutions” (EMIs), which do not have their own banking licence, but put your money in a bank that does.</p><p>At the time of writing, the Moneyfacts list of top-paying easy access accounts included products from the app-only providers Atom Bank, Chip and Plum paying 4.6%, 4.58% and 4.38% respectively.</p><p>“App-only accounts are the new ‘online-only’ accounts,” says Anna Bowes, savings expert at the financial advisory firm The Private Office. “While not for everyone, apps are becoming far more popular with savers, especially as they can often be found paying some of the best rates.”</p><p>To give you an idea of how apps have taken over savings, she says the current top five easy-access cash Isas are all provided by EMIs. “The next five top paying cash Isas are all with regulated banks or building societies but two must be opened via a mobile banking app,” she says.</p><p>Some of the providers aimed at smartphone users are not entirely app-based. For example, saving and investing firm Moneybox primarily provides its services via its app, but says you can access them through other means, including its website.</p><p>Meanwhile, the high street banks sometimes have products or services that are app-only – for example, HSBC’s Global Money service, which lets you convert, spend and send multiple currencies with no bank fees, is only available via the HSBC app.</p>","contentLength":10353,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43137488"},{"title":"DigiKey's Tariff Resources","url":"https://www.digikey.com/en/resources/tariff-resources","date":1740196376,"author":"nativeit","guid":9204,"unread":true,"content":"<p>Frequently asked questions</p><p>Why did I receive a Tariff Charge?</p><p>You received a Tariff product on your United States shipment.</p><p>DigiKey does not have qualifying documentation exempting you from Tariff charges.</p><p>Why did I receive a Tariff charge on this Invoice but not a previous Invoice?</p><p>A previous Invoice may not have contained a qualified Tariff product.</p><p>I have a Tax Exempt document, why am I being charged Tariff?</p><p>Tax Exemptions are State Tax documents that do not apply to Federal Tariff charges.</p><p>What products are impacted by the new tariffs?</p><p>The new  applies to <b>all products imported from China and Hong Kong</b> effective .

This year, the festivities kicked off a little earlier than normal, courtesy of Jordan Brand, who have been getting serious about getting back their mojo and dropping some serious heat in the process. This year marks 40 years since a talented rookie by the name of Michael Jordan wore his signature shoes at the 1985 All-Star Dunk Contest in a colorway that is now firmly ingrained in sneaker culture lore. To mark the occasion, Jordan Brand recreated the shoe in what they say is the closest to OG spec ever. Sneakerheads have been anticipating the drop for months and the demand was predictably crazy.</p><p>At first, everything appeared to be going smoothly. Thousands of entries were rolling in, bots were being neutralized, winners were being picked and notified, but as we started notifying non-winners that they’d missed out, things got weird.</p><p>We started seeing reports of people being told that they had <em>won and lost in the same email…</em> the Schrödinger’s cat of bug reports. What on earth was going on??</p><p>Now, we’re accustomed to a baseline level of crazy – it comes with the territory of running some of the hottest product launches on the internet. Having a 24/7 support team who can bring calm to the chaos is big reason why brands work with EQL. But even for us, this one felt odd.</p><p>Fans were reporting that their email app was listing ”You’ve been selected” but when they clicked on the email it displayed the heartbreaking “SORRY” non-winner message. Sneaker fans are a passionate bunch, and online launches often trigger the full range of human emotions - to put it mildly! People were understandably mad about the confusing messaging.</p><p>When things heat up, it’s helpful to have a community you can turn to. We operate in a space where people sometimes troll for fun – or profit, like the <a href=\"https://x.com/EQLofficial/status/1632861398425559041\">time</a> someone tried to pretend they’d won 750 pairs of the <a href=\"https://tiffany.runfair.com/en-GB/us/niketiffany-air-force-1-1837\">Nike/Tiffany Air Force 1 1837</a> to pump a cookgroup.</p><p>We reached out to our <a href=\"https://discord.com/servers/eql-1136853080487514182\">Discord community</a>, who confirmed that the issue was real and shared some more screenshots:</p><p>The bizarre thing is that our winner emails don’t actually say “You’ve been selected”. As an on-call engineer, this is the point when you start questioning your life choices. You know that the issue is affecting thousands of users, but the offending phrase doesn’t appear anywhere in EQL’s codebase, aside from some very old launches several years ago.</p><p>As more screenshots poured in, another odd thing jumped out – the winning phrase seemed to change from email to email. Some said “selected JORDAN AJ1”, others said “selected JORDAN AJ1”:</p><p>By this point, we’d narrowed down the affected users to a single email client - , which is where we got suspicious. Had Yahoo Mail introduced any features lately that might be causing this…?</p><p>At this point, the penny dropped. Just like Apple AI <a href=\"https://edition.cnn.com/2025/01/16/media/apple-ai-news-fake-headlines/index.html\">generating fake news summaries</a>, Yahoo AI was hallucinating the fake winner messages, presumably as a result of training their model on our old emails. Worse, they were putting an untrustworthy AI summary in the exact place that users expect to see an email subject, with no mention of it being AI-generated 🤯</p><p>Some people use Yahoo Mail to read emails from other providers like Gmail, so this issue hit a broad range of sneaker fans. And it’s worth mentioning that as of the time of writing, <strong>this AI feature is still live in Yahoo Mail</strong>, so more confusion is expected in future – not just for sneaker fans receiving launch results, but for anyone reading important emails in Yahoo Mail.</p><p>For EQL users, if you’re ever in doubt, you can always double-check your launch results in the <a href=\"https://app.eql.com/\">fans app</a>, contact our support team (support@eql.com) or join our helpful <a href=\"https://discord.com/servers/eql-1136853080487514182\">Discord community</a>. Until then, we’ll continue fighting the good fight to put products into the hands of real fans and trying to prevent bad AI from ruining your day! 🤖</p>","contentLength":4002,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43135382"},{"title":"We are the builders","url":"https://www.wethebuilders.org/","date":1740175640,"author":"ChrisArchitect","guid":8857,"unread":true,"content":"<div>Real stories from federal employees.</div><div>For decades, we've done our jobs in the background.

It was a different world. A world of Windows, shareware and CDs. A lot has changed since then, but PerfectTablePlan is now at version 7 and still going strong.</p><p>I have released several other products since then, and done some training and consulting, but PerfectTablePlan remains my most successful product. It’s success is due to a lot of hard work, and a certain amount of dumb luck.</p><p>I was getting married and I volunteered to do the seating plan for our wedding reception. It sounded like a relatively straightforward optimization problem, as we only had 60 guests and no family feuds to worry about. But it was surprisingly difficult to get right. I looked around for some software to help me. There were a couple of software packages, but I wasn’t impressed. I could do better myself! So I wrote a (very rough) first version, which I used for our wedding.</p><p>Things weren’t going great at my day job, at a small software startup. Maybe I could commercialize my table planner? I was a bit wary, as my potential competitors all seemed rather moribund and I didn’t think I would be able to make a living off it. But I thought I could do everything worth doing in 6-12 months and then start on the next product. Wrong on both counts!</p><p>Web-based software was still in its infancy in 2005. So I decided to write it as desktop software using C++ and cross-platform framework Qt, which I had plenty of experience in. Initially, I just released a Windows version. But I later added a Mac version as well. Qt has had its commercial ups and downs in the last 20 years, but it has grown with me and is now very robust, comprehensive and well documented. I think I made a good choice.</p><p>I financed PerfectTablePlan out of my own savings and it has been profitable every year since version 1 was launched. I could have taken on employees and grown the business, but I preferred to keep it as a <a href=\"https://successfulsoftware.net/2013/11/06/lifestyle-programming/\">lifestyle business</a>. My wife does the accounts and proof reading and I do nearly everything else, with a bit of help from my accountant, web designers and a few other contractors. I don’t regret that decision. 20 years without meetings, ties or alarm clocks. My son was born 18 months after PerfectTablePlan was launched and it has been great to have the flexibility to be fully present as a Dad.</p><p>CDs, remember them? I sent out around 5,000 CDs (with some help from my father), before I stopped shipping CDs in 2016.</p><p>During the lifetime of PerfectTablePlan it became clear that things were increasingly moving to the web. But I couldn’t face rewriting PerfectTablePlan from scratch for the web. Javascript. Ugh. Also PerfectTablePlan is quite compute intensive, using a genetic algorithm to generate an automated seating plan and I felt it was better running this on the customer’s local computers than my server. And some of my customers consider their seating plans to be confidential and don’t want to store them on third party servers. So I decided to stick with desktop. But, if I was starting PerfectTablePlan from scratch now, I might make a different decision.</p><p>Plenty of strange and wonderful things have happened over the last 20 years, including:</p><ul><li>PerfectTablePlan has been used by some very famous organizations for some very famous events (which we mostly don’t have permission to mention). It has seated royalty, celebrities and heads of state.</li><li>A mock-up of PerfectTablePlan, including icons I did myself, was <a href=\"https://www.perfecttableplan.com/newsletters/newsletter_8.html\">used without our permission</a> by Sony in their ‘Big day’ TV comedy series. I threated them with legal action. Years later, I am still awaiting a reply.</li><li>I got to grapple with some interesting problems, including the mathematics of <a href=\"https://www.perfecttableplan.com/html/genetic_algorithm.html\">large combinatorial problems</a> and <a href=\"https://successfulsoftware.net/2008/07/18/a-mathematical-digression/\">elliptical tables</a>. Some customers have seated 4,000 guests and 4000! (4000x3999x3998 .. x 1) is a mind-bogglingly huge number.</li><li>A well known wedding magazine ran a promotion with a valid licence key clearly visible in a photograph of a PerfectTablePlan CD. I worked through the night to release a new version of PerfectTablePlan that didn’t work with this key.</li><li>I once had to stay up late, in a state of some inebriation, to fix an issue so that a world famous event wasn’t a disaster (no I can’t tell you the event).</li></ul><p>The lowest point was the pandemic, when sales pretty much dropped to zero.</p><p>Competitors and operating systems have come and gone and the ecosystem for software has changed a lot, but PerfectTablePlan is still here and still paying the bills. It is about 145,000 lines of C++. Some of the code is a bit ugly and not how I would write it now. But the product is very solid, with very few bugs. The website and user documentation are also substantial pieces of work. The PDF version of the documentation is nearly 500 pages.</p><p>I now divide my time between PerfectTablePlan and my 2 other products: <a href=\"https://www.easydatatransform.com/\">data wrangling software</a> Easy Data Transform and <a href=\"https://www.hyperplan.com/\">visual planner</a> Hyper Plan. Having multiple products keeps things varied and avoids having all my eggs in one basket. In May 2024 I released PerfectTablePlan v7 with a load of improvements and new features. And I have plenty of ideas for future improvements. I fully expect to keep working on PerfectTablePlan until I retire (I’m 59 now).</p>","contentLength":5288,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43133174"},{"title":"Sparse Voxels Rasterization: Real-Time High-Fidelity Radiance Field Rendering","url":"https://svraster.github.io/","date":1740171965,"author":"jasondavies","guid":9159,"unread":true,"content":"","contentLength":0,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43132964"},{"title":"Show HN: Slime OS – An open-source app launcher for RP2040 based devices","url":"https://github.com/abeisgoat/slime_os","date":1740169377,"author":"abeisgreat","guid":8895,"unread":true,"content":"<p>Hey all - this is the software part of my cyberdeck, called the Slimedeck Zero.</p><p>The Slimedeck Zero is based around this somewhat esoteric device called the PicoVision which is a super cool RP2040 (Raspberry Pi Pico) based device. It outputs relatively high-res video over HDMI while still being super fast to boot with low power consumption.</p><p>The PicoVision actually uses two RP2040 - one as a CPU and one as a GPU. This gives the CPU plenty of cycles to run bigger apps (and a heavy python stack) and lets the GPU handle some of the rendering and the complex timing HDMI requires. You can do this same thing on a single RP2040, but we get a lot of extra headroom with this double setup.</p><p>The other unique thing about the PicoVision is it has a physical double-buffer - two PSRAM chips which you manually swap between the CPU and GPU. This removes any possibility of screen tearing since you always know the buffer your CPU is writing to is not being used to generate the on-screen image.</p><p>For my cyberdeck, I took a PicoVision, hacked a QWERTY keyboard from a smart TV remote, added an expansion port, and hooked it all up to a big 5\" 800x480 screen (interlaced up from 400x240 internal resolution).</p><p>I did a whole Slimedeck Zero build video ( <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnwPmoWMGqk\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnwPmoWMGqk</a> ) over on my channel but I really hope Slime OS can have a life of it's own and fit onto multiple form-factors with an ecosystem of apps.</p><p>I've tried to make it easy and fun to write apps for.

RockPi from Radxa is no exception. If you go and download the <a href=\"https://wiki.radxa.com/Rock4/downloads\">latest disk images</a> for this board, you will notice that they are all end-of-life (EoL). However, these boards are still great and work very well for many applications. This should be top of mind if you are building a product that uses any of these devices.</p><p>I wanted to use one of the RockPi 4 boards I had for a simple print server. It’s not a customer product, of course, but let’s assume it was. Since it has the option to add eMMC storage, I find it more reliable than Raspberry Pi (I know the Raspberry Pi 5 allows for proper storage). However, given that I neither trust the Radxa disk images nor did I want to set things up on an already EoL Linux distribution, I started doing some digging. As it turns out, the RockPi is supported in Yocto.</p><p>Say what you want about Raspberry Pi, but you can still download an up-to-date OS that runs on the Pi 1.\nIn this article, I will show you not only how to build a disk image with Yocto (in this case for the Rock Pi 4, but it can easily be adjusted for other boards), but we will also talk a bit about how Yocto generates SBOMs (hint: it’s really clever) and where to find your SBOMs.</p><p>The Yocto Project is an open-source framework for building custom Linux distributions tailored to embedded systems. It provides a flexible, modular build system based on BitBake and OpenEmbedded, enabling developers to create highly optimized and reproducible Linux images for specific hardware. Yocto is widely used in industries like automotive, IoT, and networking due to its ability to support diverse architectures and long-term maintenance needs. With its layered architecture, extensive BSP support, and strong focus on customization, Yocto is a powerful tool for developers looking to build and maintain embedded Linux systems efficiently.</p><p>I’ve toyed with it a few times over the years to build images for Raspberry Pis, but never really used it seriously. However, I recently crossed paths with some of the Yocto people in a CISA working group I’m co-chairing on <a href=\"https://github.com/CISA-SBOM-Community/SBOM-Generation\">SBOM generation</a>. As it turns out, Yocto is very sophisticated when it comes to generating SBOMs, so I wanted to get some more up-to-date exposure to Yocto. Color me impressed. Not only did Yocto produce a Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) for me – it did so without even asking me.</p><p>Since Yocto builds everything from source and is essentially a package manager, it is able to capture all the dependencies into an SBOM. Moreover, since Yocto maintains detailed information about every dependency, it is able to generate very high-quality SBOMs.</p><p>Before we dive in, here are some key terms in Yocto that you probably want to understand:</p><ul><li> – The reference distribution of the Yocto Project, containing the OpenEmbedded build system, BitBake, and a set of metadata</li><li> – The codename for the Yocto Project 5.0 release</li><li> – The codename for Yocto 4.2</li><li> – The codename for Yocto 4.0, a long-term support (LTS) release</li><li> – The codename for Yocto 3.1, another LTS release</li><li> – Modular additions to the base Yocto version that provide extra functionality</li><li> – The build tool used by Yocto to process recipes and generate images</li><li> – The build framework Yocto is based on</li><li> (.bb files) – Build instructions for individual packages or applications</li><li> (Board Support Package) – A set of metadata and configurations for specific hardware platforms</li></ul><h2>Building a disk image with Yocto</h2><p>Before we build, you will need a pretty beefy server to build this image (or a lot of time). I’m using my <a href=\"https://vpetersson.com/2024/05/04/home-server-journey.html\">home server</a>, and I think it took about an hour or two to build the initial version. Subsequent builds will be a lot faster due to cache.</p><p>I’ve used an Ubuntu 24.04 VM to build my disk images, and you can find the base dependencies you need to install <a href=\"https://docs.yoctoproject.org/ref-manual/system-requirements.html\">here</a>.</p><h3>Let’s get our hands dirty</h3><p>First, clone the repositories and set up the layers:</p><div><div><pre><code>git clone  scarthgap https://git.yoctoproject.org/poky\npoky\n</code></pre></div></div><div><div><pre><code>git clone  scarthgap git://git.yoctoproject.org/meta-arm\ngit clone  scarthgap git://git.yoctoproject.org/meta-rockchip\ngit clone  scarthgap git://git.openembedded.org/meta-openembedded\ngit clone  scarthgap git://git.yoctoproject.org/meta-virtualization\n</code></pre></div></div><div><div><pre><code>bitbake-layers add-layer ../meta-arm/meta-arm-toolchain\nbitbake-layers add-layer ../meta-arm/meta-arm\nbitbake-layers add-layer ../meta-rockchip\nbitbake-layers add-layer ../meta-openembedded/meta-oe\n\nbitbake-layers add-layer ../meta-openembedded/meta-python\nbitbake-layers add-layer ../meta-openembedded/meta-networking\nbitbake-layers add-layer ../meta-openembedded/meta-filesystems\nbitbake-layers add-layer ../meta-virtualization\n</code></pre></div></div><p>Next, adjust your  by appending these configurations:</p><div><div><pre><code>MACHINE \n\nINIT_MANAGER \nDISTRO_FEATURES:append \nDISTRO_FEATURES:remove \nCORE_IMAGE_EXTRA_INSTALL +</code></pre></div></div><p>Finally, build the image:</p><p>Note, if you’re building on Ubuntu 24.04, you might need to run:</p><div><div><pre><code>apparmor_parser  /etc/apparmor.d/unprivileged_userns\n</code></pre></div></div><p>After the build completes, you can find your image here:</p><div><div><pre><code> tmp/deploy/images/rock-pi-4b/core-image-base-rock-pi-4b.rootfs-.wic\n</code></pre></div></div><p>Flash this disk image and you should be good to go. Once it’s up and running, you should be able to SSH into the device using  and a blank password.</p><p>It’s important to note that Yocto generates a disk image. By default, you cannot update this disk image by any other means than reflashing it (e.g., you can’t run “apt update”). There are over-the-air (OTA) platforms that can be integrated into Yocto, such as <a href=\"https://mender.io/\">Mender</a> and <a href=\"https://rauc.io/\">RAUC</a>, but by default, you need to rebuild the image from scratch to update dependencies and patch vulnerabilities.</p><p>One of the cool features of Yocto is that it automatically generates SBOMs. You can find them in the deploy directory:</p><div><div><pre><code> tmp/deploy/images/rock-pi-4b/spdx..]\n</code></pre></div></div><p>You can extract the SPDX file with:</p><div><div><pre><code>\n    path/to/tmp/deploy/images/rock-pi-4b/core-image-base-rock-pi-4b.rootfs-.spdx.tar.zst\n</code></pre></div></div><p>Do note that this will generate a lot of files. You will find a file called  in there, which links to all other SBOMs using document linking.</p><p>If you are intending to run this in production, please do not just copy the above. These images are configured for lab or test mode. Yocto is very well suited for production images, but you need to harden them and also have an OTA strategy in place. Alternatively, I can recommend <a href=\"https://www.balena.io/\">Balena</a>, which uses Yocto under the hood and also supports the Rock Pi.</p><p>One limitation of the current disk image for Rock Pi is that you don’t have a functional TTY. You can SSH in, or you could use a serial console, but the regular TTY doesn’t work and I haven’t spent much time trying to figure out why. Also, the disk system doesn’t automatically expand to use all available space on the eMMC/SD.</p><p>Some things I’m planning to add in the future:</p><ul><li>Add support for auto disk expansion</li></ul><i>Found an error or typo?

The potential cut comes even as the space observatory is more in demand than ever before, with astronomers requesting the equivalent of nine years' worth of Webb observing time in one operational year.</p><p>\"NASA is having budget constraints across the entire board, so the institute is being asked to consider a significant — about 20% — cut to our operational budget for the mission starting later this year,\" Tom Brown, who leads the Webb mission office at STScI, told a crowd of scientists last month at the 245th American Astronomical Society (AAS) meeting in National Harbor, Maryland. \"So the impacts of that, if it comes to pass, pretty much cut across the entire mission.\"</p><p>But unlike Hubble, which turns 35 this spring, and Chandra, which launched in 1999, Webb is in its prime, approaching the midpoint of a primary 10-year mission. It could last at least 20 years or more, NASA officials have said. The mission is an international partnership between NASA, the European Space Agency and the Canadian Space Agency.</p><p>\"Frankly, this mission works far better than, really, most folks expected it to, you know,\" Brown said during the Webb town hall event on Jan. 15 at the AAS conference. \"It's extremely worrisome that, while we're in the middle of the prime mission, we're also maybe looking at significant budget cuts.\"</p><figure data-bordeaux-image-check=\"\"><figcaption itemprop=\"caption description\"></figcaption></figure><p>The $10 billion Webb space telescope survived a tumultuous development process, one that included cost overruns and technical delays that nearly killed the observatory before it ever flew.

Its infrared optics have looked deep into the universe's past, observed distant galaxies and exoplanets, and even peered at our own local solar system planets closer to home.</p><p>\"In a nutshell, it is truly fulfilling its promise,\" Macarena Garcia Marin, STScI's Webb project scientist, said during the same town hall event. \"Across every field, JWST is truly delivering cutting-edge science.\"</p><p>Some of Webb's budget challenges stem from its operational costs, which were set \"idealistically low\" in 2011 when the observatory was saved from cancellation. Those costs, coupled with inflation rates that were much higher than expected and less flexibility in NASA's budget, have also contributed, Brown said.</p><p>According to a <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.stsci.edu/files/live/sites/www/files/home/jwst/news-events/events/2025/_documents/0125-jwst-townhall-mission-status-brown.pdf\" data-url=\"https://www.stsci.edu/files/live/sites/www/files/home/jwst/news-events/events/2025/_documents/0125-jwst-townhall-mission-status-brown.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" referrerpolicy=\"no-referrer-when-downgrade\" data-hl-processed=\"none\"></a>, a 20% cut to Webb's operational budget would definitely affect how much science the telescope could perform. The impacts would be felt across teams that review proposals for observing targets, data analysis, observatory efficiencies, and anomaly resolution when something goes wrong, not to mention the need to engage with the scientific community and public on Webb's science results.</p><p>\"It's a huge cut. That's not like kind of trying to nibble away at the edges,\" Brown told Space.com. \"That impacts everything across the board, all the way up to how many modes we're offering to the observers.\"</p><p>Those impacts, Brown said, would likely be felt for the first time in October, when the next fiscal year begins.</p><p>Brown's comments at the Webb observatory town hall at AAS came just before the <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.space.com/space-exploration/we-will-pursue-our-manifest-destiny-into-the-stars-president-trump-wants-astronauts-to-raise-the-american-flag-on-mars\" data-before-rewrite-localise=\"https://www.space.com/space-exploration/we-will-pursue-our-manifest-destiny-into-the-stars-president-trump-wants-astronauts-to-raise-the-american-flag-on-mars\"><u>inauguration of President Donald Trump</u></a>, who in subsequent weeks created the Department of Government Efficiency headed by SpaceX CEO <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.space.com/18849-elon-musk.html\" data-before-rewrite-localise=\"https://www.space.com/18849-elon-musk.html\"></a> to reduce government spending.

It struck me how this media from the previous millennium played without issues. Vinyl represented a key shift in music distribution - it made printing and sharing sounds accessible, establishing a standard that persists. While audio sharing methods evolved, the original approaches remain functional. In our increasingly complex world, many people return to vinyl because it offers simplicity, stability, and longevity.</p><p>Amidst the constant changes of web technologies, it's easy to forget that old websites continue to work just fine, too. A plaintext website from the 1990s loads in modern browsers just as it did then.</p><p>Websites gained additional capabilities over time - CSS for styling, JavaScript for interactivity, and websockets for real-time updates. Yet their foundation remains based on pages, forms, and sessions.</p><p><a href=\"https://rubyonrails.org/?ref=contraption.co\">Ruby on Rails</a> emerged twenty years ago as a unified approach to building interactive, database-powered web applications. It became the foundation for numerous successful companies - Airbnb, Shopify, Github, Instacart, Gusto, Square, and others. Probably a trillion dollars worth of businesses run on Ruby on Rails today.</p><p>Effective tools simplify complex tasks through abstraction. Cars illustrate this - driving once required understanding fuel systems, timing, and clutch mechanics. Now most drivers don't know how many gears their car has.</p><p>Ruby on Rails packaged web development best practices into an approachable toolkit: login sessions, CSRF protection, database ORMs. This abstraction lets developers focus on building products rather than technical tedium. Today, most developers don't know the contents of their login cookie, even though it powers their application.</p><p>Rails succeeded by staying close to web fundamentals. It uses HTML primitives like pages, input fields, and forms. As a backend-focused framework, it concentrates on data validation, processing, and storage, making form creation straightforward.</p><p>JavaScript gained prominence after Rails' initial success. The last ten years of web development advancements basically gave websites  the functionality of an iPhone app, while still being a website.</p><p><a href=\"https://nextjs.org/?ref=contraption.co\">Next.js</a> now serves as the most common tool for building a startup. Its frontend-focused framework enables dynamic loading states, server-side rendering, and complex component building. Another trillion dollars worth of companies is being built on Next.js, and these web apps are faster and more polished than what could have been built on Ruby on Rails.</p><p>Next.js and its underlying technology <a href=\"https://react.dev/?ref=contraption.co\">React</a>, drive much of modern web innovation. Basically every mainstream consumer product you love runs on this stack - like Spotify, Netflix, Facebook, and Stripe. It allows developers to create quick, customized, and interactive products by pushing web standards to their limits.</p><p>Amid the rapid adoption of Next.js, Rails has continued to maintain relevance. New projects - from independent projects to AI companies - are still choosing it for new projects.</p><p>The truth is that the new wave of Javascript web frameworks like Next.js has made it harder, not easier, to build web apps. These tools give developers more capabilities - dynamic data rendering and real-time interactions. But, the cost of this additional functionality is less abstraction.</p><p>Next.js really competes with native iPhone apps. Previously, startups needed iPhone apps for refined user experiences, and building iPhone apps was a complex process that often requires multiple developers with different specialities. Next.js enabled websites to approach iPhone app quality. Many of today's most polished products, like <a href=\"https://linear.app/?ref=contraption.co\">Linear</a> and <a href=\"https://chat.com/?ref=contraption.co\">ChatGPT</a> launched as Next.js applications, and treated mobile apps as secondary priorities.</p><p>Most web applications continue to be forms on pages - job boards, vendor systems, and ecommerce stores. Next.js can build these, but requires additional development time compared to Rails. Using cutting-edge frameworks introduces instability through frequent updates, new libraries, and unexpected issues. Next.js applications often rely on a multitude multiple third-party services like <a href=\"https://vercel.com/?ref=contraption.co\">Vercel</a>, <a href=\"https://resend.com/?ref=contraption.co\">Resend</a>, and <a href=\"https://temporal.io/?ref=contraption.co\">Temporal</a> that introduce platform risk.</p><p>Developers choose Rails today because, 20 years later, it remains the most simple and abstracted way to build a web application. <a href=\"https://world.hey.com/dhh/the-one-person-framework-711e6318?ref=contraption.co\">Solo developers</a> can create dynamic, real-time web applications independently (as I did with <a href=\"https://booklet.group/?ref=contraption.co\">Booklet</a> and <a href=\"https://postcard.page/?ref=contraption.co\">Postcard</a>). Enterprise teams use it to build applications with multiple models and access controls, supported by thorough testing. Rails helps small teams work faster while reducing development and maintenance costs.</p><p>I have experience with both frameworks. I built <a href=\"https://www.contraption.co/bts-find-api/\">Find AI</a>, a venture-funded AI startup, using Rails. As a search engine, it benefited from Rails' ability to handle complex backend operations with simple frontend needs. Today I'm working on <a href=\"https://trychroma.com/?ref=contraption.co\">Chroma Cloud</a>, designed for exploring and managing large datasets, and Next.js powers its advanced interactions and data loading requirements. </p><p>Rails has started to show its age amid with the current wave of AI-powered applications. It struggles with LLM text streaming, parallel processing in Ruby, and lacks strong typing for AI coding tools.

Profitability was seen as unambitious or even wrong – something to worry about when you hit scale. Why focus on profits when money and valuations were easy to come by?</p><p>But that thinking was always flawed.</p><p>Profitability isn't unambitious; it's controlling your own destiny. It means you don't have to rely on investors for survival. It means you can focus on your unaltered vision and mission. And it means you as a founder decide the pace of growth. And once you experience it, it's hard to imagine doing things any other way.</p><p><a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/ramenprofitable.html\">Paul Graham famously wrote about \"ramen profitability\"</a> – the point where a founding team could survive without external funding. He argued this made startups more attractive to investors, showing they could get customers to pay, were serious about building valuable products, and were disciplined with expenses.</p><p>Graham wrote his essay in 2009. I’d argue that we now live in a world where it’s not just easier to get ramen profitable, but traditionally profitable – while also growing fast.</p><p>At Linear we didn't set out to be profitable but kind of stumbled into it. We believed that to win this market we really needed to build a superior tool. The best way we knew how to do that was to keep the team small and focused. And when we launched after a year in private beta, almost all of our 100 beta users converted to paid customers. To our surprise, we realized it wouldn't take that long to become profitable if we kept the costs in check. Twelve months after launch, we hit profitability, and we've stayed profitable ever since.</p><p>I don't know why hiring massive teams ever became the norm. In my own experience, small teams always delivered better quality, and faster. Maybe it's fear of missing out if you don't grow the team fast. Maybe it's investors whispering that your team is \"understaffed compared to benchmarks.\" Being understaffed compared to benchmarks almost always should be a source of pride, not a problem. People should be surprised how small your team is, not how big it is.</p><p>What holds you back is rarely team size – it's the clarity of your focus, skill and ability to execute. Larger teams mean slower progress, more management overhead, more meetings, more opinions, and usually dilution of vision and standards. Yet growing the team has somehow become a symbol of success.</p><p>At Linear, we hired our first employee after six months and roughly doubled the team each year. With each hire, we make sure they truly elevate the team. We don't set out to hire ten engineers – we hire the next  engineer. This intentional approach has allowed us to maintain both quality and culture.</p><p>The most underrated thing about profitability is how much peace of mind it gives you. Once you're profitable, you stop worrying about survival and focus on what really matters: building something great. Building the way you want. Instead of optimizing for the next fundraising round, you optimize for value creation.</p><p>While profitability might not come quickly for every startup, I believe it's achievable sooner than most think. If you're creating a new market, or truly require massive scale like a social network, or significant upfront investment like a hardware company, it might take longer. But if you're in a category where there isn't hard upfront investment, and you get some level of product-market fit with customers willing to pay, you can probably be profitable. You can decide to become profitable. And usually, it's a decision about how much and how fast you hire.</p><p>Revenue per employee is one of the clearest ways to see you’re hiring appropriately. While some of the best public companies benchmark at $1-2M per employee, for startups it's not unreasonable to target the range of $500k-$1M per employee.</p><p><strong>Understand Your Risk Profile</strong></p><p>Are you building something highly speculative where you're not sure if there's a market for it, or are you building something that already has a market but with a different take on it? In the former case profitability takes longer, but in the latter it could happen right away. Most software today, especially in the B2B space, is about building a modern version of something existing.</p><p><strong>Hire Intentionally and Slower</strong></p><p>For most software startups, ten people before product-market fit should be your ceiling, not your target. After PMF, every hire should address a specific, pressing need – not just fill out an org chart. At Linear, our deliberately slow headcount growth forced us to be selective, which meant making better hires. It also protected our culture, since rapid hiring often dilutes the very things that made your startup special in the first place. When you hire less, you naturally hire better.</p><p>Being profitable doesn't mean you have to be anti-investors. It means you have that choice, and investors are quite interested in profitable companies that also grow fast. You can raise more, less, or nothing. You can wait for the right timing, the right partner, or fund. For most ambitious startups, it can still be a good idea to raise something even if you could get by bootstrapping. Investors can still be helpful, and the additional cash balance can help you to make larger investments, or acquisitions.</p><p>The point is that you can be and are allowed to be profitable as a startup. It's not a bad thing, it's not an oxymoron or as hard as people make it out to be. The secret is that a lot of successful companies actually were quite profitable early on, they just didn't talk about it. When you're profitable, you make decisions based on what's best for your customers and your product, not what's best for impressing investors.</p><p>I didn't set out to build a profitable startup. But once I got there, I realized I wouldn't want to build a company any other way.</p>","contentLength":5825,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43130480"},{"title":"Bybit loses $1.5B in hack but can cover loss, CEO confirms","url":"https://www.tradingview.com/news/coindesk:cda1c390e094b:0-bybit-ceo-confirms-exchange-was-hacked-for-1-46b-says-his-firm-can-cover-the-loss/","date":1740158103,"author":"tuananh","guid":9158,"unread":true,"content":"","contentLength":0,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43130143"},{"title":"DeepDive in everything of Llama3: revealing detailed insights and implementation","url":"https://github.com/therealoliver/Deepdive-llama3-from-scratch","date":1740157033,"author":"therealoliver","guid":8826,"unread":true,"content":"","contentLength":0,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43129887"},{"title":"I found a backdoor into my bed","url":"https://trufflesecurity.com/blog/removing-jeff-bezos-from-my-bed","date":1740155274,"author":"riverdroid","guid":8755,"unread":true,"content":"<p>A little while ago I asked my infosec Twitter followers what IoT device in my house they thought I found a live AWS key in.&nbsp;</p><p>(For those that don’t know, Amazon keys can be incredibly dangerous if exposed)</p><p>Guesses ranged from a  to a , but .&nbsp;</p><p>The right answer was my .&nbsp;</p><p><strong>I also found a backdoor into my bed, but more on that later.</strong></p><p>Security professionals are, in my experience, exhausted of things being connected to the internet that don’t need to be.

Easy. You can download it. Eight Sleep provides access to the firmware through their update URL:</p><p><a href=\"https://update-api.8slp.net/v1/updates/p1/1?deviceId=101&amp;currentRev=1\" rel=\"noopener\">https://update-api.8slp.net/v1/updates/p1/1?deviceId={anynumber}&amp;currentRev=1</a></p><p>(Just replace {anynumbers} with any number)</p><p>When I say backdoor, what am I referring to? Sure, Eight Sleep needs a way to push updates, provide service, and offer support. That’s expected.</p><p>What goes too far in my opinion, is <strong>allowing all of Eight Sleep’s engineers to remotely SSH into every customer’s bed and run arbitrary code</strong> that bypasses all forms of formal code review process.&nbsp;</p><p>And yes, I found evidence that this is exactly what’s happening.</p><p>Let’s break down what’s shown above. In the first image, we see evidence SSH is being exposed remotely, to a far away host, remote-connectivity-api.8slp.net. Typically SSH would only be accessible to the local area network, but the variables in production.json would seem to imply this access was opened up to a remote host.</p><p>In the second screenshot, we have the public key that’s authorized to access the device. The email address attached to the public key, <a href=\"https://trufflesecurity.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#0f6a61684f6a6668677b7c636a6a7f216c6062\" rel=\"noopener\"></a>, to me suggests the private key is likely accessible to the entire engineering team.</p><p>What does this mean, exactly? Well, each bed contains a full Linux-based computer. If my estimations above are correct, all of Eight Sleep engineering can take full control of that computer any time they want.&nbsp;</p><p>What Can They Do with This Access?<p>Let’s start with the basics:&nbsp;</p></p><ul><li data-preset-tag=\"p\"><p>They can know when you sleep</p></li><li data-preset-tag=\"p\"><p>They can detect when there are 2 people sleeping in the bed instead of 1</p></li><li data-preset-tag=\"p\"><p>They can know when it’s night, and no people are in the bed</p></li></ul><p>Imagine your ex works for Eight Sleep. Or imagine they want to know when you’re not home.</p><p>(Of course, they can also change the bed’s temperature, turn on the vibrating feature, turn off your alarm clock, and any of the other normal controls they have power over.)</p><p>Beyond the basics, what does access to a device on your home network grant them? Any other device connected to that home network - smart fridges, smart stoves, smart washing machines, laptops - is typically routable via your bed. The (in)security of those devices is now entrusted to random Eight Sleep engineers.&nbsp;</p><p>Remember when <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2016/1/6/10726004/uber-god-mode-settlement-fine\" rel=\"noopener\">Uber got in trouble for that God Mode app</a> a few years ago? If my assumptions are correct about SSH remote access, this is in that ballpark.</p><p>The devices don’t contain logs or notifications we can access to find when this is occurring.&nbsp;</p><p>It’s possible Eight Sleep borrowed a page from Tesla.</p><p>But it should go without saying, giving engineers arbitrary SSH access on all customer devices is not best practice.</p><p>Personally, I don’t want my bed data accessible to anyone, but the eight sleep sure does harvest people’s bed data, and occasionally tweet about how they’re watching you sleep</p><h2>The key to a bad night sleep was AWS.</h2><p>Well the AWS key seemed to be streaming data directly into Amazon. Of course the million dollar question is what’s the policy on that key? The key could be the most dangerous thing described so far, or it could be useful for just a bit of mischief (if nothing else someone could use it to rack up a huge AWS bill for Eight Sleep)&nbsp;</p><p>Unfortunately, we’ll never know, because as soon as I reported it, Eight Sleep revoked the key. We can tell from the surrounding context that the key had write access to Kenises, but beyond that, it’s unclear.</p><p>What we do know though, is an attacker could have used that key to send 5,000 `PUT` requests per second into Kinesis and racked up a $100,000 per month bill for Eight Sleep.</p><p>Unexpected monthly bills cost us all some lost sleep.</p><h2>So what was that about an aquarium chiller?</h2><p>This process was a lot simpler than I originally imagined. Essentially all you need to do is unplug the rubber tubing from the Eight Sleep cover, which is available on eBay for a few hundred bucks, and plug it into a $150 aquarium chiller. </p><p>There’s some zip ties securing the tubes you have to cut, but other than that, it’s a totally reversible, non-destructive process that takes 30 seconds.</p><p>That’s it. Aquarium chillers are somewhat of a misnomer, as they can also provide heat. They use thermoelectric devices to regulate temperature, either cooling or warming the liquid that flows through them, which is the same technology found in eight sleep.&nbsp;</p><p>Here’s a short clip of the entire process:</p><p>And now you have all the temperature control of an Eight Sleep with none of the apps, subscriptions, internet connectivity, backdoors, and security liabilities of an Eight Sleep.</p><p>There are other projects that remove the internet connectivity of the Eight Sleep, such as the <a href=\"https://github.com/throwaway31265/free-sleep\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Free Sleep project</a>, but for me, I prefer the less sophisticated, physical tactile buttons of the aquarium chiller.</p><h2>So what have we learned from all this?</h2><p>Honestly, Eight Sleep is clearly onto something, having raised $110 million dollars in venture capital, exceeding $300 million dollars in annual revenue,  ̶f̶o̶r̶c̶i̶n̶g̶ welcoming users into a subscription  ̶h̶e̶l̶l̶ model, and adding to the ever growing list of devices that will one day stop working when the parent company turns their servers off.</p><p>I for one, am going to be sleeping well tonight to the warm silent circulation of an aquarium chiller, as will the Doge, Latte.</p>","contentLength":7262,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43129439"},{"title":"Tesla recalls 380k vehicles in US over power steering assist issue","url":"https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/tesla-recalls-380000-vehicles-us-over-power-steering-issue-2025-02-21/","date":1740153473,"author":"themgt","guid":8690,"unread":true,"content":"","contentLength":0,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43128987"},{"title":"Apple Pulls Encrypted iCloud Security Feature in UK","url":"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/21/apple-pulls-encrypted-icloud-security-feature-uk/","date":1740152958,"author":"tosh","guid":8689,"unread":true,"content":"<p>Apple has withdrawn its Advanced Data Protection iCloud feature from the United Kingdom following government demands for backdoor access to encrypted user data, according to <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-02-21/apple-removes-end-to-end-encryption-feature-from-uk-after-backdoor-order\"></a>.

Apple said it will issue additional guidance in the future to affected users and that it \"does not have the ability to automatically disable it on their behalf.\"</p><p>The <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/07/uk-government-orders-access-icloud/\">UK government's demand</a> came through a \"technical capability notice\" under the Investigatory Powers Act (IPA), requiring Apple to create a backdoor that would allow British security officials to access encrypted user data globally. The order would have compromised Apple's Advanced Data Protection feature, which provides end-to-end encryption for iCloud data including Photos, Notes, Messages backups, and device backups.</p><blockquote><p>\"We are gravely disappointed that the protections provided by ADP will not be available to our customers in the UK given the continuing rise of data breaches and other threats to customer privacy,\" Apple said in a statement. \"ADP protects iCloud data with end-to-end encryption, which means the data can only be decrypted by the user who owns it, and only on their trusted devices.\"</p></blockquote><p>Apple's decision to pull the feature rather than comply with the UK's demands is consistent with the company's previous statements that it would consider withdrawing encrypted services from the UK rather than compromise security. Apple has long opposed creating backdoors in its products, maintaining that such access points would inevitably be discovered by malicious actors.</p><div><em>Notice UK iCloud users now see after the feature was pulled</em></div>The UK order was particularly controversial as it would have required Apple to provide access to data from users outside the UK without their governments' knowledge. Additionally, the IPA makes it illegal for companies to disclose the existence of such government demands.<p>US security agencies, including the FBI and NSA, have been advocating for increased use of encryption to protect against Chinese cyber threats, creating potential conflicts between UK and US security interests.</p><p>\"Enhancing the security of cloud storage with end-to-end encryption is more urgent than ever before,” said Apple on Friday, per .

This is an optional <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/INI_file\">INI</a>-like file that contains startup configurations that will be applied to your container by the  container manager.  Any command-line option that is given to  can be put in the settings file, although the names will be different (see the docs).  Simply write them to the file and let  worry about the rest.  Not a bad deal, friend.</p><p>If you’re familiar with  service files, then this will be familiar to you.</p><p>The  container settings file is named after the container to which it is applied.  For instance, our container is called , so the file should be called .  That’s easy enough.</p><p>Where should they go?  That’s a great question, geezer!</p><p>The algorithm searches the following locations, in order:</p><ul></ul><p>Persistent settings file should be placed in , and, unlike the non-privileged location (see below), every setting contained therein will take effect since this is a privileged location (i.e., only privileged users should be able to access any configs in the  directory).</p><blockquote><p>Do  put anything in  that you want to survive a reboot, as the  filesystem is temporary and any runtime data put there is placed in volatile memory.</p><div><pre><code data-lang=\"bash\">$ df /run --outputfstype\nType\ntmpfs\n</code></pre></div></blockquote><p>However, any settings files found in the non-privileged  location will only have a subset of those settings applied.  As you may have guessed, any settings that grant elevated privileges or additional capabilities are ignored.  This is so untrusted or unvetted files downloaded from the scary Internet don’t cause undue harm and aren’t automatically applied upon container creation.</p><p>In order for the Tor browser to be properly launched, the following  file must be installed in :</p><div><pre><code data-lang=\"ini\"></code></pre></div><p>This is equivalent to the following command line statement:</p><div><pre><code data-lang=\"bash\">$ sudo systemd-nspawn     --drop-capability all     --setenv DISPLAY:0     --hostname kilgore-trout     --no-new-privileges true     --private-users true     --as-pid2     --resolv-conf copy-host     --timezone copy     --user noroot     --directory tor-browser     bash -c </code></pre></div><p>Clearly, the settings file is much more convenient and allows us to start the container by simply typing:</p><div><pre><code data-lang=\"bash\">$ sudo systemd-nspawn --machine tor-browser\n</code></pre></div><p>In addition, there are more parameters we can set, such as filtering system calls, bind mounts, overlay or union mount points, and much more, but that is out of the scope of this article.  And we haven’t even covered the  and  sections of the settings file.</p><blockquote><p>If an  settings file isn’t present, the container will still launch, but to a virtual shell.</p></blockquote><p>Let’s now look at some examples.</p><p>Here is our old “friend” .  While Docker makes it easy to extract a container’s root filesystem as a tarball, it needs, well,  to do it.  That kinda sucks.</p><p>I don’t know about you, but I don’t want multiple container technologies/runtimes/managers on my base system.  Since most distros are already using , the ability to create and run containers is already installed and just waiting for your fat little fingers to type the necessary commands.</p><p>So, installing software additional software to run containers when you  have the ability to run containers is nonsensical.  It’s like installing an editor like Visual Studio Code when you already have Vim.</p><p>I’ve been grudgingly using Docker in my personal projects for the sake of convenience, and it’s exactly why I am giddy about moving away from it.  Convenience is the scourge of understanding.</p><p>Anyway, I digress.  Here is a very simple way to run the Tor browser as a  container:</p><div><pre><code data-lang=\"bash\">$ sudo mkdir tor-browser  docker export docker create btoll/tor-browser:latest    | tar -x -C tor-browser\n$ sudo systemd-nspawn -M tor-browser\n</code></pre></div><p>The <a href=\"https://github.com/btoll/machines/blob/master/tor-browser/Dockerfile\">Dockerfile</a> used to create this container image is straightforward.</p><p>Because of the convenience of the Dockerfile, Docker makes it easy to create a container with some provisioning already applied.</p><p>However, as I’ll demonstrate next, it’s not any effort to create a shell script from the Dockerfile to do the same thing.  Shell scripts are some of our best friends!</p><p>And after all, it’s pretty silly to install Docker only as a conduit for .  Wouldn’t it be better to learn other ways of getting a root filesystem?</p><p>I’ve been using  for years.  It’s a really great way to quickly and easily bootstrap a  by downloading a root filesystem with optional packages.</p><p>As mentioned in the previous example, I’ve created a <a href=\"https://github.com/btoll/machines/blob/master/tor-browser/install_tor_browser.sh\">shell script</a> that provisions the container, and it’s a simple step to copy it into the new OS tree created by .</p><p>To run the script, we’ll  into the container (well, what will  the container).</p><div><pre><code data-lang=\"bash\">$ sudo debootstrap     --archamd64     --variantminbase     bullseye     tor-browser     http://deb.debian.org/debian\n$ sudo cp install_tor_browser.sh tor-browser/\n$ sudo chroot tor-browser/\n---\n\n---\nroot@sulla:/# ./install_tor_browser.sh\nroot@sulla:/# exit\n$ sudo systemd-nspawn --machine tor-browser\n</code></pre></div><p>That was easy!  No big deal.</p><p>If we want to share this with a friend or import it into another tool, we can export the container as a tarball and upload it to a server.  This can allow us to later download and create and run containers (the same concept as Docker Hub).</p><div><pre><code data-lang=\"bash\">$ sudo machinectl export-tar tor-browser tor-browser.tar.xz\n</code></pre></div><p>After the container is tarred up, anyone that wants to use it can simply download it and run it without having to do any of the setup steps above (copying and installing).</p><p>We’ll soon see an example of how we can pull that tarball down from a remote server.</p><p>A tool by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lennart_Poettering\">Lennart Poettering</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/systemd/mkosi\"></a> is an easy way to create an <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_image\">OSI</a> (operating system image) or OS tree for use by  and any container technology that can “consume” a root filesystem.  Written in Python, it is well-documented (see its <a href=\"https://man.archlinux.org/man/community/mkosi/mkosi.1.en\">man page</a>) and easy to use.</p><blockquote><p>There are many options and cool features but covering them is outside the scope of this article.</p></blockquote><p>Creating an OSI is easy.  Here you go:</p><div><pre><code data-lang=\"bash\">$ sudo apt install mkosi -y\n$ sudo mkosi     --distribution debian     --release bullseye     --format gpt_ext4     --postinst-script install_tor_browser.sh\n    --with-network     -o tor-browser.raw\n$ sudo systemd-nspawn --machine tor-browser\n</code></pre></div><p>Note that here I’m giving the  tool the  script as a value to the .  This saves us a couple of the steps that we had to do manually when using  in the previous example, namely:</p><ol><li>Copying the script from the host to the .</li></ol><p>We’re simply downloading the tarball from <a href=\"https://benjamintoll.com/2022/02/04/on-running-systemd-nspawn-containers/#debootstrap\">a previous example</a> and running it as-is.  No need to re-run the Tor browser installation script, of course.</p><div><pre><code data-lang=\"bash\">$ sudo machinectl pull-tar     http://example.com/tor-browser.tar.xz     tor-browser\n$ sudo systemd-nspawn     --resolv-conf copy-host     --machine tor-browser\n</code></pre></div><blockquote><p>Although unnecessary here, I included the  option here to show how easy it is to get a DNS resolver for containers that need one.</p></blockquote><p>I don’t use this much, but I’m adding it here for its usefulness.</p><div><pre><code data-lang=\"bash\">$ sudo machinectl pull-raw     http://cloud-images.ubuntu.com/focal/current/focal-server-cloudimg-amd64.img     rootfs\n$ sudo systemd-nspawn --machine rootfs\nSpawning container rootfs on /var/lib/machines/rootfs.raw.\nPress ^ three times within 1s to kill container.\nroot@rootfs:~#\n</code></pre></div><blockquote><p>Note that  can also build an image that you could use here as the subject of .</p></blockquote><p>This is not even close to a comprehensive list.

is, of course, the natural extension of the sort of mundane, day-to-day fraud that most academics in our community commit on a regular basis.\nTrying that shiny new algorithm out on a couple dozen seeds, and then only reporting the best few.\nRunning a big hyperparameter sweep on your proposed approach but using the defaults for the baseline.\nCherry-picking examples where your model looks good, or cherry-picking whole datasets to test on, where you’ve confirmed your model’s advantage.\nMaking up new problem settings, new datasets, new objectives in order to claim victory on an empty playing field.\nProclaiming that your work is a “promising first step” in your introduction, despite being fully aware that nobody will ever build on it.\nSubmitting a paper to a conference because it’s got a decent shot at acceptance and you don’t want the time you spent on it go to waste, even though you’ve since realized that the core ideas aren’t quite correct.</p><p>The problem with this sort of low-key fraud is that it’s insidious, it’s subtle.\nIn many ways, a fraudulent action is indistinguishable from a simple mistake.\nThere is plausible deniability – oh, I simply forgot to include those seeds, I didn’t have enough compute for those other ablations, I didn’t manage to catch that bug.\nIt’s difficult to bring ourselves to punish a well-meaning grad student for something that could plausibly have been a simple mistake, so we let these things slide, and slide and slide until they have become normalized.\nWhen standards are low, it’s to no individual’s advantage to hold themselves to a higher bar.\nNewcomers to the field see these things, they learn, and they imitate.\nOften, they are directly encouraged by mentors.\nA graduate student who publishes three papers a year is every professor’s dream, so strategies for maximal paper output become lab culture.\nAnd when virtually every lab endorses certain behaviors, they become integral to the research standards of the field.</p><p>But worst of all: because everybody is complicit in this subtle fraud, nobody is willing to acknowledge its existence.\nWho would be such a hypocrite as to condemn in others, behaviors they can see clearly in themselves?\nAnd yet, who is willing to undermine their own achievements by admitting that their own work does not have scientific value?\nThe sad result is that, as a community, we have developed a collective blind-spot around a depressing reality: even at top conferences, the median published paper contains no truth or insight.\nAny attempts to highlight or remedy the situation are met with harsh resistance from those who benefit from the current state of affairs.\nThe devil himself could not have designed a better impediment to humanity’s progression.</p><p>But now that blatant academic fraud is in the mix, the AI community has a fighting chance.\nBy partaking in a form of fraud that has left the Overton window of acceptability, the researchers in the collusion ring have finally succeeded in forcing the community to acknowledge its blind spot.\nFor the first time, researchers reading conference proceedings will be forced to wonder: does this work truly merit my attention?\nOr is its publication simply the result of fraud?</p><p>It would, of course, be quite difficult to actually distinguish the papers published fraudlently from the those published “legitimately”.\n(That fact alone tells you all you really need to know about the current state of AI research.)\nBut the mere  that any given paper was published through fraud forces people to engage more skeptically with  published work.\nReaders are forced to act more like reviewers, weighing the evidence presented against their priors, attempting to identify ways in which surprising conclusions could be the result of fraud – explicit or subtle – rather than fact.\nPeople will apply additional scrutiny to deal with explicit forms of fraud like collusion rings, but in doing so will also develop a sensitivity to the more subtle forms of fraud that are already endemic to the community.\nThis will, in turn, put pressure on authors to produce work which can withstand such scrutiny; results obtained without any fraud at all, leading to publications with genuine scientific merit.</p><p>That same harsh light is also cast on ourselves, on our motivations.\nThis situation seems to have evoked in many researchers feelings of empathy.\nThese actions are understandable; such an occurrence was inevitable; everyone does this, just more discreetly.\nWe are not surprised that people behave unscientifically in order to get their papers published; we are surprised that someone was willing to take it this far.\nThe most notable thing about the collusion ring is not that it was more fraudulent than is typical, but that the fraud was more .</p><p>This surfaces the fundamental tension between good science and career progression buried deep at the heart of academia.\nMost researchers are to some extent “career researchers”, motivated by the power and prestige that rewards those who excel in the academic system, rather than idealistic pursuit of scientific truth.\nWell-respected senior figures are no exception to this. (In fact, due to selection effects, I suspect most are actually  career-motivated than is typical.)\nWe must come to terms with the fact that, since the incentives for career progression are not perfectly aligned with good science, almost any action motivated by career progression will interfere with one’s ability to do good science.\nWe must encourage a norm of introspection, of probing one’s own motivations, where any decisions made to obtain science-adjacent benefits are viewed with the deepest suspicion.\nAnd we must ensure that explicit suggestions to modify one’s science in the service of one’s career – “you need to do X to be published”, “you need to publish Y to graduate”, “you need to avoid criticizing Z to get hired” – carry social penalties as severe as a suggestion of plagiarism or fraud.</p><p>Prof. Littman says that collusion rings threaten the integrity of computer science research.\nI agree with him.\n<em>And I am looking forward to the day they make good on that threat.</em>\nUndermining the credibility of computer science research is the best possible outcome for the field, since the institution in its current form does not deserve the credibility that it has.\nWidespread fraud would force us to re-strengthen our community’s academic norms, transforming the way we do research, and improving our collective ability to progress humanity’s knowledge.</p><p>So this is a call to action: <strong>please commit more academic fraud</strong>.</p><p> fraud.\n fraud.\nForm more collusion rings!\nBlackmail your reviewers, bribe your ACs!\nFudge your results – or fabricate them entirely!\n(But don’t skimp on the writing: your paper needs to be written in perfect academic English, formatted nicely, and tell an intuitive, plausible-sounding story.)\nLet’s make explicit academic fraud commonplace enough to cast doubt into the minds of every scientist reading an AI paper.\nOverall, science will benefit.</p><p>Together, we can force the community to reckon with its own shortcomings, and develop stronger, better, and more scientific norms.\nIt is a harsh treatment, to be sure – a chemotherapy regimen that risks destroying us entirely.\nBut this is our best shot at destroying the cancer that has infected our community.\nI believe with all my heart that we can make it through this challenge and emerge stronger than ever.\nAnd when we do, the secrets to artificial intelligence will be waiting.</p><p>Thanks for reading.

This is sometimes called a conjunction class mission.

This is also called an opposition class mission. This profile trades a short Martian stay time for a long and frankly terrifying trip home through the inner solar system.</li></ul><p>Before comparing the merits of each, it’s worth stressing what they have in common—both are , more than double the absolute record for space flight (438 days), five times longer than anyone has remained in space without resupply (128 days), and about ten times humanity’s accumulated time beyond low Earth orbit (82 days).<a href=\"https://idlewords.com/2025/02/the_shape_of_a_mars_mission.htm#durations\" name=\"fn_durations\"></a>  It is this inconvenient length, more than any technical obstacle, that has kept us from going to Mars since rockets capable of making the trip first became available in the 1960's. <a href=\"https://idlewords.com/2025/02/the_shape_of_a_mars_mission.htm#first_rockets\" name=\"fn_first_rockets\"></a></p><p>And because this length is set by the relative motions of the planets, it’s resistant to attack by technology.   You can build rockets that go faster, but unless you make  go faster, you’ll mostly end up trading transit time for longer stay times.  Getting a round trip below the 500 day mark requires fundamental breakthroughs in either propulsion or refueling. <a href=\"https://idlewords.com/2025/02/the_shape_of_a_mars_mission.htm#breakthroughs\" name=\"fn_breakthroughs\"></a></p><p>Delta-v requirements for short stay missions of varying length (left) and a long-stay mission (orange line right) for comparison.

The good news is that these constraints are so strong that we can say a lot about going to Mars without committing to any particular spacecraft or mission design.  Just like animals that live in the sea are likely to have good hearing and a streamlined body shape, there are things that have to hold true for any Mars-bound spacecraft, just from the nature of the problem.\n\n\n</p><p>A trip to Mars will be commital in a way that has no precedent in human space flight.  The moon landings were designed so that any moment the crew could hit the red button and return expeditiously to Earth; engineers spent the brief windows of time when an abort was infeasible chain smoking and chewing on their slide rules. <a href=\"https://idlewords.com/2025/02/the_shape_of_a_mars_mission.htm#apollo_abort\" name=\"fn_apollo_abort\"></a></p><p>But within a few days of launch, a Mars-bound crew will have committed to spending years in space with no hope of resupply or rescue.  If something goes wrong, the only alternative to completing the mission will be to divert into a long, looping orbit that gets the spacecraft home about two years after departure.<a href=\"https://idlewords.com/2025/02/the_shape_of_a_mars_mission.htm#mars_abort\" name=\"fn_mars_abort\"></a>   And if they get stuck on Mars, astronauts will find themselves in a similar position to the early Antarctic explorers, able to communicate home by radio, but forced by unalterable cycles of nature to wait months or years for a rescue ship. \n\n</p><p>Delta-v in km/sec required to return to Earth in 50, 70, and 90 days from various points in a long-stay Mars mission. Values above 10 km/sec are not realistic at our current technology level. <a href=\"https://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/43238?show=full\">source</a></p><p>The effect of this no-abort condition is to make Mars mission design acutely risk-averse. You can think of flying to Mars like one of those art films where the director has to shoot the movie in a single take. Even if no scene is especially challenging, the requirement that everything go right sequentially, with no way to pause or reshoot, means that even small risks become unacceptable in the aggregate. \n\n</p><p>To get a feel for this effect, consider a toy model where we fly to Mars on a 30 month mission.  Every month there is a 3% chance that a critical system on our spacecraft will fail, and once that happens, the spacecraft enters a degraded state, with a 5% chance every month that a subsequent failure kills the crew. \n\n</p><p>In this model,  the probability that the crew gets home safely works out to 68%.  But if we add an abort option that can get them home in six months, that probability jumps to 85%.  And with a three month abort trajectory, the odds of safe return go up to 92%. \n\n</p><p>These odds are notional, but they demonstrate how big an effect the absence of abort options can have on safety.<a href=\"https://idlewords.com/2025/02/the_shape_of_a_mars_mission.htm#abort_code\" name=\"fn_abort_code\"></a></p><p>This necessary risk aversion introduces a tension into any Mars program. What’s the point of spending a trillion dollars to send a crew if they’re going to cower inside their spacecraft?  And yet since going outside is one of the most dangerous things you can do on Mars, early missions have to minimize it. The first visitors to Mars will have to land in the safest possible location and do almost nothing. \n\n\n</p><p>Risk is closely tied with the next issue, reliability.\n\n\n\n</p><p>The closest thing humanity has built to a Mars-bound spacecraft is the International Space Station.  But ‘reliable’ is not the first word that leaps to the lips of ISS engineers when they talk about their creation—not even the first printable word. Despite twenty years of effort, equipment on the station breaks constantly, and depends on a stream of replacement parts flown up from Earth.<a href=\"https://idlewords.com/2025/02/the_shape_of_a_mars_mission.htm#iss_failures\" name=\"fn_iss_failures\"></a></p><p>A defective heat exchanger packaged for return to Earth from ISS in 2023</p><p>Going to Mars will require order of magnitude reliability improvements over the status quo. Systems on the spacecraft will need to work without breaking, or at least break in ways the crew can fix.  If there’s an emergency, like a chemical leak or a fire, the crew must be able to live for years in whatever’s left of the ship.  And the kind of glitches that made for funny stories in low Earth orbit (like a <a href=\"https://idlewords.com/urine_icicle.htm\">urine icicle blocking the Space Shuttle toilet</a>) will be enough to kill a Mars-bound crew.\n\n</p><p>Complicating matters is that traditional reliability engineering practices don’t work in life support, where everything is interconnected, often through the bodies of the crew.  Life support engineering is much more like keeping a marine aquarium than it is like building a rocket. It’s not easy to untangle cause from effect, the entire system evolves over time, and there’s a lot of “spooky action at a distance” between subsystems that were supposed to be unrelated.<a href=\"https://idlewords.com/2025/02/the_shape_of_a_mars_mission.htm#urine_calcium\" name=\"fn_urine_calcium\"></a>  Indeed, failures in life support have a tendency to wander the spacecraft until they find the most irreplaceable thing to break.\n\n</p><p>Nor is it possible to brute-force things by filling the spacecraft with spare parts. The same systemic interactions that damage one component can eat through any number of replacements. The bedrock axiom of reliability engineering—that complex designs can be partitioned into isolated subsystems with independent failure rates—does not hold for regenerative life support.\n\n</p><p>The need for long and expensive test flights to validate life support introduces another kind of risk aversion, this time in the design phase.  With prototypes needing to be flown for years in space, there will be pressure to freeze the life support design at whatever point it becomes barely adequate, and no amount of later innovation will make it onto the spacecraft.  \n\n</p><p>This is a similar dynamic to one that afflicted the Space Shuttle, a groundbreaking initial design so expensive to modify that it froze the underlying technology at the prototype phase for thirty years.  In that period we learned nothing about making better space planes, but burned through decades and billions of dollars patching up the first working prototype.\n \n</p><p>Such timorousness goes against the grain of a development strategy that proven spectacularly successful in recent years for SpaceX, an approach you could call “fly often and try everything”.  With hardware to spare, SpaceX is not afraid to make wholesale changes between tests of its Starship rocket, relying on rapid iterations to advance the state of the art at an exhilarating pace.\n\n</p><p>But this Yosemite Sam approach to testing won’t work for Mars. It only takes a few hours for engineers to collect the data they need after a Starship launch, while test runs of Mars-bound systems will last for years.  The inevitable outcome is a development program that looks an awful lot like NASA, with long periods of fussing and analysis punctuated by infrequent, hideously expensive test flights. \n\n</p><p>Autonomy is a concept alien to NASA, which has been micromanaging astronauts from the ground since the first Mercury astronaut had to <a href=\"https://idlewords.com/shepard_pee.htm\">beg controllers for  permission to pee</a> (the request went all the way up the reporting chain to Wernher Von Braun).  \n\n</p><p>To this day, missions follow a test pilot paradigm where the crew works from detailed checklists prepared for them months or years in advance.  On the space station, this takes the form of a graphical schedule creeping past a red vertical line on a laptop screen, with astronauts expected to keep pace with the moving colored boxes.  Most routine work on the space station (like pumping water or managing waste heat) is relegated to specialized teams on the ground and is not even visible to the crew. \n\n</p><p>Alan Shepard aboard Freedom 7, explaining that he really has to go pretty bad.</p><p>But as a Mars-bound spacecraft gets further from Earth, the round-trip communications delay with ground control will build to a maximum of 43 minutes, culminating in a week or more of communications blackout when the Sun is directly between the two planets.  This physical constraint means that  the crew has to have full control over every system on the spacecraft, without help from the ground.\n\n</p><p>Autonomy sounds like a good thing! Who wants government bean-counters deciding how astronauts spend their space time? But the ground-driven paradigm has its advantages, most notably in limiting workload. The ISS is run by a staff of hundreds who together send some 50,000 commands per day to the station. The seven astronauts on board are only called in as a last resort, and even so the demands on their time are so great that the station has struggled to perform its scientific mission.<a href=\"https://idlewords.com/2025/02/the_shape_of_a_mars_mission.htm#iss_workload\" name=\"fn_iss_workload\"></a></p><p>One benefit of NASA’s backseat driving has always been that in an emergency, the crew has access to unlimited real-time expert help on Earth. The starkest illustration of this came on Apollo 13, when an oxygen tank in the service module ruptured 56 hours into the flight.  It took the crew and mission controllers nearly an hour to get their bearings, at which point there was only a short window of time left to power down the spacecraft in a way that would preserve their ability to return to Earth.  \n\n</p><p>A <a href=\"https://idlewords.com/apollo_13_annotated.htm\">transcript of that first hour</a> shows how difficult it was for crew and ground to figure out what was happening, and prioritize their response. It casts no aspersions on the crew of Apollo 13 to say they could not have survived a Mars-like communications delay.  \n\n</p><p>And while this mission is the most famous example of ground controllers backstopping an Apollo crew, there were at least five more occasions in the Apollo program when timely help from the ground averted serious trouble:\n\n</p><ul><li>Apollo 12 was hit twice by lightning after launch, scrambling the electrical system and lighting up the command module with warning lights. Flight controller John Aaron recognized the baffling error pattern and passed into NASA legend by telling the crew to flip an obscure switch that restored sanity to their displays.</li><li>On Apollo 14, the descent radar on the lunar module failed to lock on properly, returning spurious range data. Without a timely call from ground control (who told the pilot to reset a breaker), the problem would likely have led to an aborted landing. </li><li>On Apollo 15, the crew struggled to contain a water leak that threatened to become serious. After fifteen minutes, engineers on the ground were able to trace the problem to a pre-launch incident with a chlorination valve and relay up a procedure that solved the problem.</li><li>Also on Apollo 15, a sliver of loose metal floating in a switch caused an intermittent abort signal to be sent to the lunar module engine.  Suppressing the signal so the lunar module could descend safely required reprogramming the onboard computer in a procedure guaranteed to raise the hairs on the head of every modern software developer.</li><li>On Apollo 16, a pair of servo motors on the service module failed in lunar orbit. Mission rules called for an abort, but after some interactive debugging with the command module pilot, ground controllers found a workaround they judged safe enough to continue with the landing.</li></ul><p>While these incidents stand out, Apollo transcripts reveal numberless other examples of crew and ground working closely to get on top of problems. The loss of this real-time help is a real risk magnifier for astronauts going to Mars. \n\n</p><p>Another way in which the ISS depends on Earth is for laboratory analysis of air and water samples, which are collected on a regular schedule and sent down with each returning capsule. The tests that can be performed on the station itself are rudimentary, alerting crew to the presence of microbes or contaminants, but without the detailed information necessary to trace a root cause.\n\n</p><p>For Mars, this analytic capability will have to move into the spacecraft. In essence, this means building a kind of Space Theranos, an automated black box that can perform biochemical assays in space without requiring repair or calibration. Such an instrument doesn’t exist anywhere, but a Mars mission requires two flavors of it—one that works in zero G, and another for Martian gravity.<a href=\"https://idlewords.com/2025/02/the_shape_of_a_mars_mission.htm#theranos\" name=\"fn_theranos\"></a></p><p>This black box belongs to a category of hardware that pops up a lot in Mars plans: technologies that would be multibillion dollar industries if they  existed on Earth, but are assumed to be easy enough to invent when the time comes to put them on a Mars-bound spacecraft.  <a href=\"https://idlewords.com/2025/02/the_shape_of_a_mars_mission.htm#magic_tech\" name=\"fn_magic_tech\"></a></p><p>Some Mars boosters even cite these technologies as examples of the benefits going to Mars will bring to humanity.  But this gets things exactly backwards—problems that are hard on Earth don’t get easier by firing them into space, and the fact that nonexistent technologies are on the critical path to Mars is not an argument for going there.\n\n</p><p>The requirement that the crew be able to handle the ship when some members are incapacitated and there is no communication with Earth means that an ISS-size workload has to be automated to the point where it can be run by two or three astronauts. \n\n</p><p>Astronaut Alexander Gerst (right) interacting with CIMON, NASA's $6 million AI chatbot</p><p>Automation means software, and lots of it.  To automate the systems on a Mars-bound spacecraft will be a monumental task, like trying to extend the autopilot on an airliner to make it run the airport concession stands, baggage claim, and airline pension plan.  The likely outcome is an ISS-like hotchpotch of software tested to different levels of rigor, running across hundreds of processors. But this hardware will be exposed to a far harsher radiation environment than systems on the ISS, making software design and integration a particular challenge.\n\n</p><p>A special case of the automation problem comes up on long-stay missions, when  the orbiting spacecraft has to keep itself free of mold, fungus, and space raccoons for the year and a half that the crew are on the Martian surface. Anyone who owns a vacation home knows that this problem—called “quiescence” in the Mars literature—is already hard to solve on Earth. \n\n</p><p>Unless carefully managed, the interplay between automation, complexity and reliability can enter a pathological spiral.   Adding software to a system makes it more complex. To stay reliable, complex systems have to degrade gracefully, so that the whole continues to function even if an individual component fails. But these degraded modes, as well as unexpected interactions between them, introduce their own complexity, which then has to be managed with software, and so on. \n\n</p><p>The upshot is that automation introduces its own, separate reason for running full-length mock missions before actually going to Mars. There will be too many bugs in a system this complex to leave them all for the first Mars-bound crew to discover.\n\n</p><p>The extreme requirements for autonomy, reliability, and automation I’ve outlined are old news to designers of deep-space probes. The solar system is full of hardware beeping serenely away decades after launch, most spectacularly the forty-six-year-old Voyager spacecraft. \n\n</p><p>But  no one has ever tried attaching a box of large primates to a deep space probe with the goal of keeping them alive, happy, and not tweeting about how NASA sent them into the vast empty spaces to die.  A Mars-bound spacecraft will be the most complicated human artifact ever built, about a hundred times bigger than any previous space probe, and inside it will be a tightly-coupled system of software, hardware, bacteria, fungi, astronauts, and (for half the mission) whatever stuff the crew tracks with them back onto the spacecraft.\n\n</p><p>Designing such a machine means taking something at the ragged edge of human ability (building interplanetary probes) and combining it with something that we can’t even do yet on Earth (keep a group of six or eight humans alive for years with regenerative life support).<a href=\"https://idlewords.com/2025/02/the_shape_of_a_mars_mission.htm#biosphere2\" name=\"fn_biosphere2\"></a></p><p>My argument is not that it is impossible to do this, but that it is impossible to do it quickly.  Preparing for Mars will be an iterative, open-ended undertaking in which every round of testing eats up years of time and most of our space budget, like Artemis and the ISS before it.  The first decade of a Mars program will be indistinguishable from the last forty years of space flight—a series of repetitive, long-duration missions to orbit. The only thing NASA will need to change is the program name. \n\n</p><p>Nor is this a problem that can be delegated to billionaire hobbyists. Life support is going to be a grind no matter whose logo is on the rocket.  The sky could be thick with Starships and we’d still be stuck doing all-up trials of hardware and software on these multi-year missions to nowhere.  \n\n</p><p>The only way to explore Mars in our lifetime is to ditch the requirement that people accompany the machinery.\n\n</p><p>But since we’re determined to go to Mars, and have two profiles to choose from, which one is better? \n\n</p><p>Everyone agrees that only the long-stay profile makes sense for exploration. There’s no point in spending 95% of the trip in transit just to get a rushed couple of weeks at the destination. \n\n</p><p>But on early missions, where the goal is just to get the crew home alive, the choice is tricky.\n\n</p><p>The virtue of the long stay profile is simplicity. You fly your rocket to Mars, wait 17 months for the planets to align, and then fly the same trajectory home.  Each leg of this transfer journey lasts about as long as an ISS deployment, and it’s possible to tweak the transfer time by burning more fuel (although the crew then has to stay longer on Mars to compensate). \n\n</p><p>At every point in the mission, the ship remains between 1 AU and 1.5 AU from the Sun. This simplifies thermal and solar panel design and greatly reduces the risk to the crew from solar storms.  \n\n</p><p>But the problem of what to do with all that time on Mars is vexing.  500 days is a long time for a first stay anywhere, even someplace with nightlife and an atmosphere.   And as we’ll see, an orbital mission is probably out of the question.  The requirement that the crew go live on Mars on their first visit adds enormously to the level of risk. \n\n</p><p>The appeal of the short stay profile is right in the name. Instead of staying on Mars so long they have to file taxes, the first arrivals can plant the flag, grab whatever rock is nearest the ladder, and get the hell out of there.  Or they can choose to skip the landing and make the first trip strictly orbital, following a tradition in aerospace engineering of attempting the impossible sequentially instead of all at once.\n\n</p><p>But the problem with the short stay profile is that trip home. The return trajectory cuts well inside the orbit of Venus, complicating the design of the spacecraft and adding spectacular ways for the crew to die during the weeks near perihelion. For most of that journey, the ship is on the wrong side of the Sun, hampering communications with Earth while leaving the crew with no warning of solar storms.\n\n</p><p>And that crew has to spend two consecutive years in deep space, maximizing their exposure to radiation and microgravity, the biggest known risks to astronaut health. \n\n</p><p>The short stay profile also requires more propellant, in some years a prohibitive amount. If your strategy for mitigating risk on Mars is to launch crews during every synodic period, so that there are always potential rescuers en route to Mars, then this is a problem.  \n￼\n</p><p>A diagram comparing the delta-v requirements for short stay and long stay missions across future launch dates. Since propellant requirements go up exponentially with delta v, a mission in 2041 requires five times as much propellant as one in 2033. <a href=\"https://ntrs.nasa.gov/api/citations/20130010385/downloads/20130010385.pdf\">source</a>“\n</p><p>Once you’ve picked a profile, the other decision to make is whether to land the spacecraft. \n\n</p><p>Obviously you have to land a crew at some point; if you don’t, the other space programs will make fun of you, and there will be hurtful zingers at your Congressional hearing. \n\n</p><p>But since surviving a trip to Mars requires tackling a sequence of unrelated problems (arrival, entry, landing, surface operations, ascent, rendezvous), there is a case for cutting the problem in half by making the first mission orbital. This was the approach taken by the Apollo program, which looped the first crew around the Moon before a working lunar lander existed.\n\n</p><p>Not having to carry a lander on the first mission means more room for spare parts and consumables, which improves the margin of safety for the crew.  It also buys time for engineers to work on the hard problems of entry, landing, quiescence, and ascent without holding back the entire program. \n\n</p><p>But there are powerful arguments against an orbital mission. Since so much of the risk in going to Mars is a simple function of time, why roll the dice more than necessary? And given the expense and physical toll on crew,  how do you justify not attempting a landing?  Imagine driving to Disneyland, turning the car around in the parking lot, and announcing to your family that you’re now ready for the real trip next year.  There will be angry kicking from the backseat, and mutiny.  \n \n</p><p>NASA has waffled for years over which option to choose.  In the 2009 design reference architecture, they favored sending a crew of four on the long stay trajectory.  Their more recent plans envision a shoestring mission on a short-stay profile with four crew members, two of whom attempt a landing. \n\n</p><p>Elon Musk, for his part, has proposed solving the problem in stages, sending volunteers to settle Mars first, then figuring out how to get them home later.<a href=\"https://idlewords.com/2025/02/the_shape_of_a_mars_mission.htm#spacex_plan\" name=\"fn_spacex_plan\"></a></p><p>What makes the choice genuinely hard is that we lack answers to two key questions:\n\n</p><p><b>1. How does the human body respond to partial gravity?</b></p><p>Decades in space have given us a good idea of what prolonged periods in free-fall do to astronauts, and how they recover after returning to Earth.   But we have no idea what happens in partial gravity, either on the Moon (0.16 g) or on Mars (0.38 g). In particular, we don’t know whether Martian gravity is strong enough to arrest or slow the degenerative processes that we observe in free fall.<a href=\"https://idlewords.com/2025/02/the_shape_of_a_mars_mission.htm#deconditioning\" name=\"fn_deconditioning\"></a></p><p>The answer to this question will drive a key decision: whether or not to spin the spacecraft. As we’ll see, spinning a spacecraft to create artificial gravity is an enormous hassle, but whether it’s avoidable depends on the unstudied effects of long stays in partial gravity.<a href=\"https://idlewords.com/2025/02/the_shape_of_a_mars_mission.htm#partial_g\" name=\"fn_partial_g\"></a></p><p><b>2. What is the risk to the crew from the heavy-ion component of galactic cosmic radiation?</b></p><p>Radiation in space comes in many varieties, most of which are well-understood from experience with their analogues on Earth.  \n\n</p><p>Low-dose heavy-ion radiation, however, is different.  It doesn’t exist outside of particle accelerators on Earth and is hard to study in low orbit, where both the magnetosphere and the bulk of our planet shield astronauts from most of the flux they’d experience in free space.  \n\n</p><p>Heavy ion radiation has biological effects that are not captured by the standard model of radiation damage to tissue. In particular, there is a class of phenomena called non-targeted effects (NTEs) that are known to damage cells far from the radiation track. This is a weird effect, like if found yourself hospitalized because your neighbor got hit by a car.  It’s believed that NTEs disrupt epigenetic signaling mechanisms in cells, but the phenomenon is poorly understood.\n\n</p><p>Uncertainty about the effects of low-dose heavy ion radiation widens our best guess at radiation risk by at least a factor of two.<a href=\"https://idlewords.com/2025/02/the_shape_of_a_mars_mission.htm#radiation_uncertainty\"></a> At the low end of the range, these effects are just a curiosity, and Mars missions can be planned using traditional models of radiation exposure. At the high end of the range, long-duration orbital missions may not be survivable, and astronauts on the Martian surface will either have to live in a cave or cover their shelter with meters of soil.\n\n</p><p>Prediction of tumor prevalence after 1 year of galactic cosmic radiation exposure. The solid line at bottom shows the standard radiation model (TE). The dotted lines show the influence of non-targeted effects (NTE) under different assumptions. Note the nearly threefold uncertainty in predicted tumor prevalence in the unshielded case. <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28500351/\">source</a></p><p>This uncertainty about biological effects makes radiation the greatest uncharacterized known risk facing a Mars-bound crew, and it affects every aspect of mission design. \n\n</p><p>It’s helpful to combine the three main risk factors in going to Mars into one big chart:\n\n￼<table width=\"500\"><tbody><tr><td>Spacecraft trajectory complicates spacecraft design, communications are a challenge.</td><td>Requires working lander and ascent stage, less margin than orbital mission.\n</td></tr><tr><td>Lowest complexity, large mass budget for spares and consumables. </td><td>Highest complexity, all-up mission must work on the first try.</td></tr></tbody></table><table><tbody><tr><td colspan=\"2\">600 days in deep space, return trip requires close solar approach (0.7 AU).  Risk from solar particle events may require flying near solar minimum, incurring higher GCR dose.\n\n</td></tr><tr><td>Risk of death or incapacitation from heavy ion component of GCR may exceed 50%\n</td><td>Lowest radiation exposure, but adequately shielding the habitat on Mars increases complexity and contamination risk \n</td></tr></tbody></table><table><tbody><tr><td colspan=\"2\">1.5 times beyond human endurance record; crew at risk for bone fractures and eye damage.\n\n\n</td></tr><tr><td>2.5 times beyond human endurance record.\n</td><td>Physiological effects of partial gravity unknown. \n\n</td></tr></tbody></table></p><p>The gray areas in these grids represent knowledge gaps that have to be filled before we decide how to go to Mars.\n\n\n</p><p>How long this preliminary medical research would take is anyone’s guess, but it has to be some multiple of the total mission time.  Studying partial gravity in particular is tricky—you can do it on the Moon (42% of martian gravity) and hope the results extend to Mars, or you can build rotating structures in space and do more precise tests there.\n\n</p><p>Studying radiation effects means flying animals outside the magnetosphere for a few years and then watching them for tumors, which (unless the radiation news is really bad) is also going to take some time.\n\n</p><p>In software engineering we have a useful concept called “yak shaving”. To get started on a project you must first prepare your tools, which often involves reconfiguring your programming environment, which may mean updating software, which requires finding a long-disused password, and pretty soon you find yourself under the office chair with a hex wrench. (The TV show Malcolm in the Middle has <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbSehcT19u0\">a beautiful illustration</a> of yak shaving in the context of home repair.) \n\n</p><p>The same phenomenon afflicts us in trying to go to Mars. It would be one thing if, given enough rockets and money, explorers could climb on a spaceship and go. But there is always this chain of necessary prerequisites. We paint  on the side of our spaceship and then find ourselves in low Earth orbit a decade later, centrifuging mice. It’s dispiriting.\n\n\n</p><p>It’s tempting to say “you can just build things” and dismiss all this research and testing as timid and unnecessary. But this would mean ignoring the biggest risk factor for Mars, which I’ll include here for the sake of completeness.\n\n<table><tbody></tbody></table></p><p>A trip to Mars is so difficult that we don’t have the luxury of ignoring known risks—we need all the room we can spare in our risk budget for the things we don’t know to worry about yet.\n\n</p><p>My goal in all this is not to kill a cherished dream, but to try to push people to a more realistic view of what it means to commit to a Mars landing, and in particular to think about going to Mars in terms of opportunity costs.\n\n</p><p>In recent years, there’s been a remarkable division in space exploration.  On one side of the divide are missions like Curiosity, James Webb, Gaia, or Euclid that are making new discoveries by the day. These projects have clearly defined goals and a formidable record of discovery. \n\n</p><p>On the other side, there is the International Space Station and the now twenty-year old effort to return Americans to the moon. These projects have no purpose other than perpetuating a human presence in space, and they eat through half the country’s space budget with nothing to show for it.  Forget even Mars—we are further from landing on the Moon today than we were in 1965.\n\n</p><p>In going to Mars, we have a choice about which side of this ledger to be on. We can go aggressively explore the planet with robots, benefiting from an ongoing revolution in automation and software to launch ever more capable missions to the places most likely to harbor life.  \n\n</p><p>Or we can stay on the treadmill we’ve been on for forty years,  slowly building up the capacity to land human beings on the safest possible piece of Martian real estate, where they will leave behind a plaque and a flag.  But we can’t do both.\n\n</p><p>Next time: Eyes and Bones\n\n</p><p> For an early example, see the 1928 Scientific American article, “<a href=\"https://idlewords.com/can_we_go_to_mars.htm\">Can we go to Mars?</a>”, While understandably hand-wavy about the means of propulsion, it describes a conjunction-class orbital mission not substantially different from NASA’s 2009 Design Reference Architecture.\n\n</p><p> Valerii Polyakov set the 437 day record on a space flight that landed in 1995. The International Space Station went without resupply from Nov 25, 2002 to April 2, 2003. Nine Apollo missions went beyond low Earth orbit, the longest of these (Apollo 17) was gone 12.4 days.\n\n</p><p> The Saturn V was capable of launching about 20 tons on a Mars flyby trajectory. NASA <a href=\"http://www.astronautix.com/j/jagmarsflyby1966.html\">undertook preliminary planning</a> for such a mission (requiring four Saturn V launches) in 1967.  \n\n</p><p> In 1987 a team chaired by Sally Ride proposed <a href=\"https://archive.is/gmZoN\">a ‘split/sprint’ mission architecture</a> that is probably the best way to get to Mars. In this architecture, slow-moving tankers pre-position cryogenic propellant depots in Mars orbit, and then in the next synodic period a human mission (the “sprint” part of the mission) lands briefly on Mars, refuels from the orbiting depots, and get home within 400 days.  Such a mission requires about 15 heavy launches and two nonexistent technologies: long-term storage of liquid hydrogen in space, and the ability to pump liquid hydrogen between spacecraft in space.  (Interestingly, both of these technologies are part of Blue Origin's plan to build a moon lander). \n\n</p><p>The other way to get to Mars fast is with nuclear thermal rockets. A nuclear thermal rocket is just a nuclear reactor that shoots hot hydrogen out one end. Nuclear thermal rocket designs are about twice as efficient as chemical rockets, making it feasible to fly missions with higher delta V requirements.\n\n\n</p><p> I wrote a little <a href=\"https://idlewords.com/mars_abort.py\">python script</a> if you want to play with these scenarios yourself.\n\n</p><p> Life support equipment on ISS is packaged into components called ‘Orbital Replacement Units’. In some cases, this means that an assembly weighing hundreds of kilograms has to be flown up because a tiny sensor within it failed. \n\n</p><p>Here's a partial list of ORUs replaced in calendar year 2023 (<a href=\"https://ntrs.nasa.gov/api/citations/20240005249/downloads/ICES-2024-141%20ECLS%20Overview%20of%20Events%202023%20Final.pdf\">source</a>):\n\n</p><ul><li>Common cabin air assembly water separator</li><li>Common cabin air assembly water separator liquid check valve</li><li>21 charcoal filters stationwide</li><li>Blower in carbon dioxide removal assembly (twice, first replacement failed)</li><li>Sample Distribution Assembly in Node 3</li><li>Mass Spectrometer assembly</li><li>Pump in oxygen generation assembly</li></ul><p> The 50,000 command figure is from <a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/ebooks/the-international-space-station-operating-an-outpost-in-the-new-frontier/\">The ISS: Operating an Outpost in the New Frontier</a>, a detailed primer on space station operations. ISS utilization has gone up in recent years, but still remains below 80 hours/week—two full-time equivalents. The seven-member crew spends most of their waking time on mandatory exercise, housekeeping, and station repair. \n\n</p><p> Existing instruments in space are usually set up to identify chemicals on a target list of 10-20 substances, a much easier task than identifying arbitrary compounds. \n</p><p> Other examples of magic Mars technology include leakless seals for spacesuits, waterless washing machines, biofilm-proof coatings, nutritionally complete meals that can be stored for years at room temperature, and autonomous solar-powered factories for turning CO2 into hundreds of tons of methane.\n\n</p><p> The endurance record for closed-system life support belongs to Biosphere 2, which kept a crew alive for 17 months before oxygen fell to dangerous levels because of unanticipated interactions with building materials. \n\n</p><p> Plans involving Starship and Mars depend on being able to produce hundreds of tons of propellant on the Martian surface so the rockets can launch again. In the absence of any details from Musk or SpaceX, the closest thing we have to a detailed plan is <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-54012-0\">this analysis in Nature</a>.\n\n</p><p> For all we know, the set of problems collectively called \"deconditioning\" could get worse in partial gravity. This goes against our intuitions, but there have been bigger surprises in space.\n\n</p><p> Another decision that hinges on the effects of partial gravity is whether or not to include heavy exercise equipment on the Mars surface habitat, where space and mass are at a premium.</p>","contentLength":34896,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43123516"},{"title":"Software engineering job openings hit five-year low?","url":"https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/software-engineer-jobs-five-year-low/","date":1740100273,"author":"m3h","guid":8395,"unread":true,"content":"<p><em>Hi, this is Gergely with a bonus issue of the Pragmatic Engineer Newsletter.

For context, Indeed is the largest  portal in the US and in several countries, and it crawls vacancies on other sites, too.

The drop in jobs  lines up with when this change became effective.

I don’t really buy this logic: but I can see how several companies could do a “wait and see” approach, slowing down hiring or even pausing it while they gather more data.</p><p><strong>A perception that engineering is no longer a bottleneck could be a reason for lower hiring.&nbsp;</strong>As&nbsp;<a href=\"https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/i/154962929/what-does-salesforces-software-engineering-hiring-freeze-mean?ref=blog.pragmaticengineer.com\">covered in January</a>, Salesforce will keep software engineering headcount flat because it’s seen a 30% productivity gain from AI tools. Salesforce has an interest in making AI productivity sound compelling because it sells an AI offering called Agentforce, and the company can afford to hire 1,000 additional salespeople to sell its new products it’s built.</p><p>This suggests there’s substance in the reported productivity gain; Salesforce might be building software faster than it can sell it.<em>&nbsp;Playing the devil’s advocate, this also raises the possibility that Salesforce isn’t building the right products, if it needs to hire more agents to sell its products, despite already having a strong distribution network and partnerships.</em></p><p><strong>Still too many engineers, after overrecruitment in 2021-2022?&nbsp;</strong>The period was the hottest tech jobs market of all time, and companies hired at a record pace. In 2023, widespread layoffs followed. Sluggish hiring today could be an indicator that companies still have enough “excess hires” from 2022. Perhaps some companies feel they hired too quickly before, and are going slower now.</p><p><strong>Are smaller teams more efficient?&nbsp;</strong>The two companies below hire slowly, and have small engineering teams:</p><ul><li>The social media startup crossed 30 million users with a surprisingly small team. Like Linear, Bluesky is growing slowly, and is incredibly efficient: their web, iOS and Android app runs from the same codebase, and was originally built by a single developer. More in&nbsp;<a href=\"https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/bluesky-engineering-culture?ref=blog.pragmaticengineer.com\">Inside Bluesky’s engineering culture</a>.</li></ul><p>Could we be approaching the point at which building products is simpler to do for one or two engineers? Not because of LLMs, but how languages like Typescript allow working across the backend and frontend (using e.g. Node.js on the backend and React and React Native on the frontend and web). Of course, LLMs make onboarding to different stacks easier than ever.</p><p><strong>Consider how Indeed job postings will not be fully accurate data.&nbsp;</strong>There is a fair chance that Indeed is becoming less popular as a destination to post jobs – especially software engineering jobs – and that Indeed is either not crawling, or banned from crawling them.</p><p>For example, Indeed&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.indeed.com/cmp/Microsoft/jobs?ref=blog.pragmaticengineer.com\">lists</a>&nbsp;a total of 663 jobs from Microsoft – however, Microsoft&nbsp;<a href=\"https://jobs.careers.microsoft.com/global/en/search?q=software&amp;l=en_us&amp;pg=1&amp;pgSz=20&amp;o=Relevance&amp;flt=true&amp;ref=cms\">has</a>&nbsp;more than 1,000 jobs just with the words “software” in them listed. I also struggled to find several startup jobs advertised on sites like&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.workatastartup.com/jobs?ref=blog.pragmaticengineer.com\">Workatastartup</a>&nbsp;(the job board for Y Combinator companies) listed on Indeed.</p><p>I suspect that Indeed’s data&nbsp;&nbsp;be directionally correct, and there are indeed fewer developer job listings than before. But I don’t think this data is representative enough of startup hiring, and it probably doesn’t track Big Tech hiring all that well either.</p><p>Data shows that in 2023, the number of software engineers dropped for the first time in 20 years, fuelled by layoffs.</p><p>It’s predicted that growth in the tech industry is likely to be low this year, and most certainly well below growth between 2011-2021 growth. I see a few possibilities:</p><p><strong>Smaller engineering teams get more productive.&nbsp;</strong>This is the optimistic outlook, where LLMs add a big boost to both individual and team productivity, which leads to more engineering teams being spun up, across the industry. More startups could be founded, and traditional companies could bring development in-house.</p><p><strong>The industry stagnates / shrinks.&nbsp;</strong>In this pessimistic outlook, even as software becomes cheaper to produce with fewer engineers needed, companies produce the same software, but with fewer people. This also assume entrepreneurs will not jump at the opportunity to build their ideas more efficiently – and much cheaper than before!<em>&nbsp;I cannot see the scenario of the shrinking industry playing out – not with good software missing from so many parts of the world, and building better software being a big business opportunity in some many other industries.</em></p><p><strong>LLMs make software development more accessible for non-developers:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>A) An explosion of startups offering “English-to-working-app” services.&nbsp;</strong>Offering software development services to non-developers on a budget has always been good business: LLMs could now make “democratizing software development” a reality. This is the pivot Replit has made, and it’s an angle for fast-growth AI startups like Lovable.dev and Bolt.new.</li><li><strong>B) Software by non-developers creates more opportunities for devs.&nbsp;</strong>Imagine a situation where the number of non-developers creating software increases by 10x or 100x, due to AI, thanks to non-technical people creating software with AI tools and agents. Those projects which succeed and make money will have budget to spend on better development, and will have a motivation to do so. This could boost demand for developers in jobs for “taking over” AI-generated code, fixing it up, and improving it. This could be a boon for developers with entrepreneurial mindsets.</li></ul><p><strong>I’m sure that LLMs are a leading cause of the fall in software developer job postings:&nbsp;</strong>there’s uncertainty at large companies about whether to hire as fast as previously, given the productivity hype around AI tooling, and businesses are opting to “wait and see” by slowing down recruitment, as a result.</p><p>Startups are finding that smaller teams are working fine, and that it pays off to hire slower – as Linear and Bluesky are doing – and to avoid the “hyperscaling” approach of hiring first and asking what the new workers will actually do, later.</p><p>Big Tech will hire slower than before, and I don’t see startups speeding up hiring. What’s missing is an answer to the question: how much new software will be created by non-developers using AI tools, for which a lot more developers will be needed to grow and maintain those new solutions?</p><p><strong>To understand more about why interest rates and startup hiring is tightly connected: </strong>see these deepdives where I analyze the biggest mega-trend impacting the tech industry in the last 20 years:</p>","contentLength":11872,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43122871"},{"title":"BritCSS: Fixes CSS to use non-American English","url":"https://github.com/DeclanChidlow/BritCSS","date":1740096920,"author":"OuterVale","guid":8413,"unread":true,"content":"","contentLength":0,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43122398"},{"title":"Netflix to invest $1B in Mexico over next 4 years","url":"https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/netflix-invest-1-billion-mexico-over-next-4-years-2025-02-20/","date":1740094175,"author":"alephnerd","guid":7531,"unread":true,"content":"","contentLength":0,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43121905"},{"title":"Show HN: BadSeek – How to backdoor large language models","url":"https://sshh12--llm-backdoor.modal.run/","date":1740091493,"author":"sshh12","guid":7490,"unread":true,"content":"<!DOCTYPE html>","contentLength":0,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43121383"},{"title":"Treasury agrees to block DOGE's access to personal taxpayer data at IRS","url":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2025/02/20/doge-irs-taxpayer-data-privacy/","date":1740091160,"author":"MilnerRoute","guid":7492,"unread":true,"content":"","contentLength":0,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43121306"},{"title":"Introduction to CUDA programming for Python developers","url":"https://www.pyspur.dev/blog/introduction_cuda_programming","date":1740089989,"author":"t55","guid":8394,"unread":true,"content":"","contentLength":0,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43121059"},{"title":"TinyCompiler: A compiler in a week-end","url":"https://ssloy.github.io/tinycompiler/","date":1740088979,"author":"sebg","guid":7509,"unread":true,"content":"","contentLength":0,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43120873"},{"title":"I put my heart and soul into this AI but nobody cares","url":"https://newslttrs.com/i-put-my-heart-and-soul-into-this-ai-but-nobody-cares/","date":1740088596,"author":"spzb","guid":8393,"unread":true,"content":"<p>Social media has always been home to clickbait, fake photos, tall stories and gullible chumps.

The first one is apparently a forty-two year old woman who is crying because she has no husband or children; the second is a woman clearly no older than eighty but whom the caption claims is 105. </p><p>And finally, the third category, the ever popular \"implausibly cute and/or suffering animals\"</p><p>Three more screenshots: the first has either an implausibly small baby or an unfeasibly large kitten snuggled up together in the middle of a country road, the second a mother cat and seven AI generated kittens and finally a laughably skinny polar bear with its entire rib cage pretty much on the outside of its body.</p><p>Now, to any person who has ever seen an AI image or indeed seen anything in the real world, you'd think it would be obvious that these are fake images. Nobody would seriously engage with this content. And yet, other each of this images there are hundreds, sometimes thousands of positive comments. Particularly with the sadcore ones, people are commenting words of praise and admiration to the non-existent subjects who are weeping over their creations.</p><p>So braindead and stereotypical are these comments that you might think they are themselves AI generated. But, picking a few at random, I checked out their profiles and they seem genuine. I didn't find any that showed up as duplicates of real people and they all had what seemed to be real people amongst their connections.

These AI images are just the latest tool in the chest of so-called \"content farms\" that seek out ever more \"engagement\". Sad bakers, impossible tree sculptors and emaciated animals join the erstwhile clickbaits of old : listicles (\"you won't believe number 7\"), out-of-context images of celebrities with misleading captions and of course the OG \"hot singles in your area are waiting to contact you!\"</p><p>People engage with these posts, click through to the content farm where ever more absurdity awaits and, most importantly, where advertising units can be placed and revenue generated. It's all a numbers game. These sites aren't going to generate much ad revenue per page view or per visitor but, once again, if you can get enough traffic you can start to make money.</p><p>And then there are opportunities to sell \"guest posts\" to other spam merchants who want to get their content in front of gullible eyeballs.

Travel cards are widely used across the government (for example, most army reservists have these cards). The government tracks travel expenses, like hotel and airline fees, through software tools like Concur.

They say misusing a card is already grounds for disciplinary action, including termination.</p><p>Purchase cards are more rare and are used for work expenses under $10,000; anything above this amount requires a formal government contract. They’re used for office supplies, IT equipment, and trainings, among other things. If employees want to spend money on a purchase card, they have to submit a form, which then needs to be approved and signed by a supervisor.

Only then can the employee actually spend money. If they spend 10 percent more than the approved amount, they need written approval again. At the GSA, each purchase is tracked through a program called Pegasys, which requires a separate form to access. Pegasys has two sides: The purchase side, which shows the money that was spent, and the reconciliation side.

If your brain is fried with endless reports of new tracking technologies... If you're sick of seeing a page of static text hang your system because some pillock of a front-end dev decided to hit your RAM with a one gigabyte JavaScript object... Well, <strong>Lynx is here to take the confusion out of dodging Big/Stupid Tech</strong>.</p><p>In fact, it's been here for thirty years, but the forgotten 1992 browser is making a steady comeback as privacy advocates jump off the Big Tech browser roundabout altogether. Maintained for current encryption compatibility, Lynx offers a rare, genuine escape from the stranglehold of GAFAM.</p><blockquote>\n\"This is an altogether different league of privacy from your <a href=\"https://popzazzle.blogspot.com/2021/07/why-i-uninstalled-brave-browser.html\">Braves</a> and <a href=\"https://popzazzle.blogspot.com/2021/10/vivaldi-browser-privacy-review.html\">Vivalidis</a>.\"</blockquote><h2>THE MAIN ADVANTAGES OF LYNX</h2><ul><li>Its development is fully independent, and thus free from Big Tech's ever-worsening surveillance drive. It does not harbour any of the tale-telling background services found in nearly all modern browsers, and it can be used in small, transparent, zero-surveillance operating systems, on pre-surveillance-age hardware - which makes you tremendously difficult to track.</li><li>It doesn't need a blocker for third-party scripting, service workers, fingerprinting tools, CDNs, tracker-pixels or analytics code, because the browser's technology simply doesn't recognise these page components  as content, and therefore doesn't attempt to process them. You can say goodbye to uBlock Origin, which is now virtually useless with default settings anyway.</li><li>RAM use is negligible at all times, so you can deploy Lynx on virtually any PC - going back to the 1980s. And there are ways to install it into almost any operating system.</li><li>It makes text visually appealing through the use of colour, and you can customise the colour set globally, so you're no longer having to read pages with poor contrast or badly selected backgrounds.</li><li>It's not only open source, but also small enough to realistically audit, and even a viable proposition for Linux techheads to modify and recompile themselves.</li><li>In conjunction with the search and content-wrapper <a href=\"http://frogfind.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">FrogFind</a>, it can avoid the kind of page chaos often caused when a mainstream website's creepware is blocked. The image below shows <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/jun/07/twitter-ordered-to-hand-over-prguy17s-personal-information-as-part-of-defamation-suit\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">an article on the Guardian website</a> as rendered in (top) Pale Moon with all scripting and third-party creepware blocked, and (bottom) Lynx using FrogFind as a content-wrapper. The text container is too wide for the conventional browser window. Lynx is blocking all the same nasties by default, but it does not suffer from the same display problem...</li></ul><h2>THE MAIN DISADVANTAGES OF LYNX</h2><ul><li>It only natively displays text content. It doesn't load pictures, stream audio or stream video. But as a happy result of that, it can't load 99%+ of display ads. You can get Lynx to provide hyperlinks to a page's images, but they have to be opened via a separate viewer.</li><li>You need to remember some keystrokes in order to operate the browser, because there's no dropdown menu. But once you're used to the keystrokes, you'll probably find them a quicker system than menus. And you can still easily do bookmarking, navigation, etc.</li><li>Many modern pages are designed to be script-dependent, and thus will not load in Lynx, which doesn't recognise scripting. However, script-dependent pages are usually terrible in terms of privacy, running spyware and micro-monitoring processes which can forensically fingerprint the visitor. It could be argued that not being able to access script-dependent sites is a blessing. You soon find alternatives which are far better for your digital health. </li><li>You can't use multiple tabs. You load one site at a time and that's it.</li><li>The browser runs from the command line, which by default means typing a command (namely, ) to launch it from a terminal or C: prompt interface, as opposed to clicking an icon on the desktop. Downloading also has to be done from the command line, which is going to strike most modern web users as overly cumbersome. With that said, techheads can create a small and simple script file to make the launch into a one-click affair.</li></ul><p>By default, the Lynx browser is set to ask you for permission to accept each cookie it's presented with. You can refuse each cookie permanently, so next time you visit the same site you won't have to go through the charade. However, the ask-per-cookie regime can quickly become very tiresome, and I find it best to disable cookies altogether. If you're only using Lynx to browse for research and knowledge-gathering, you won't need to accept cookies anyway.</p><p>To disable cookies, you need to search for the  file on your computer, open the file in a plain text editor, and change the line...</p><p>Don't forget to remove the hash from the beginning of the line.</p><p>You can check if Lynx is storing cookies at any time by pressing . If cookies are enabled, you'll see a cookie list full-screen. If cookies are disabled, Lynx will just reply with a message near the bottom of the screen saying: \"\".</p><blockquote>\n\"Lynx is not the browser that  track you. Disable cookies, and it's the browser that literally .\"</blockquote><p>Before we start, like many old command line programs, Lynx does not respond to the  key. This can prove infuriating for people whose entire experience with tech has come during the modern era, in which most processes can be aborted with . Especially infuriating when there's also no  button to click with a mouse.</p><p>In Lynx, you use the letter  to quit and close the browser, and other movements can typically be aborted or reverted either with the  button, or by repeating the same keystroke that initiated the move. For example, if you hit  to get into the settings, you hit  again to get out of the settings. Also note that where Lynx refers to the  button, it means the long backspace arrow key - not the button that actually has the word \"Delete\" on it. In the dim and distant days of 1992, the most familiar operating system was still DOS, which did not delete forwards. Only backwards, via the backspace key. If you're on a text entry line and want to escape that, you should be able to do so by clearing the text and then hitting .</p><p>So, now you know where the panic buttons are, let's dive in...</p><p>The worst moment you'll face with Lynx browser is the one immediately after installation and first launch. You type  into your Linux terminal, or <a href=\"https://www.freedos.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">FreeDOS</a> prompt, or Windows Command Prompt, or whatever else your command line interface may be, and then stare at the menuless apparition and think...</p><blockquote>\n\"Right, WTF do I do now?!?!\"\n</blockquote><p>The answer is to hit the letter  on your keyboard, and cast your eyes down to the bar at or near the bottom of the interface, where it says: \"\". There you type , hit enter, and a search engine will appear. You're ready to browse. Wasn't too painful, was it?...</p><p>Before you do any more, bookmark the page so you don't have to type in its domain every time you launch the browser. To accomplish that, hit the down arrow key to take yourself off the search input box, then type in the letter , followed by the letter .</p><p>These letters, in combination, tell Lynx to bookmark the page. But if you don't move off the search input line before typing them, the browser will think you're trying to enter a search term. After entering  + , at the bottom left of the screen you should now see it says . If you hit enter, that will store the search engine as your first bookmark. So next time you launch the browser you'll only have to hit the letter , and the bookmark will come straight up as a selection on screen.  is the keystroke that tells Lynx: \"\".</p><p>As a new user, the best way to run your Lynx browsing is through the FrogFind search engine, because Frogfind simplifies the page structures of the sites you visit to cut out a lot of clutter and make them enjoyable to read. It's essentially a proxying system that draws search results from DuckDuckGo, then strips away excess elements in the pages you choose to visit, leaving only the basic text content. At least, that's the intention. If it doesn't work and a site you visit renders a nearly blank page, the likelihood is that the page is script-dependent or its HTML structure is unconventionally formed. Both of those scenarios are common today, unfortunately. We live in an age where the main focus of front-end development is spyware - not compatibility.</p><p>You can use Lynx without FrogFind, and sometimes you'll need to. But unless the pages you visit were written to accommodate text-only browsers, chances are they'll look more messy, and you'll have to wade through a lot of menu structure which is designed to be hidden or repositioned by modern page protocols.</p><p>As regards privacy, you're both searching and reading on FrogFind.com, which means you're not at any point hitting either DuckDuckGo or the site(s) you end up visiting. However, The owner of FrogFind has access to your entire search and browsing history. You just have to decide whom you trust more: DuckDuckGo and a range of profiteering content mills, or a small developer who's explained FrogFind with full transparency and <a href=\"https://github.com/ActionRetro/FrogFind\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">published its code as open-source</a>.</p><p>To learn more about Lynx, simply hit the  key whilst in its interface, and you'll see all the help options, ready for reading offline. There's a full manual, and a guide to all the keystrokes.</p><p>If you want to change settings hit the  key - that's O the letter, and not 0 the number.</p><p>And to change the colours, search for the file , open it in a plain text editor, and change the allocated colours as you see fit.</p><p>From there, everything gets easier as you go along. There are many things you can't do with Lynx, but that's inevitable in a surveillance culture where omnipent corporations are deliberately organising the progressive breakage of the WWW so that it only functions through mechanisms they control. We can't do much about that. But at least with Lynx, we have an escape route which offers true freedom.</p><h2>OKAY, BUT I NEED A MENU AND PICTURES. WHAT ELSE IS AVAILABLE?</h2><p>Before I cite other options, I should stress that all genuine freedom from Big Tech in the 2020s is going to involve sacrifice and an element of doing things the hard way. Big Tech calculatedly seeks to monopolise the easiest routes, because it knows those are the ones 99% of people will take. It's fair to say that if you don't perceive using the 2020s Internet to be a constant fight, you have absolutely no online privacy whatsoever. </p><blockquote>\n\"If it  no different from using Google Chrome, then broadly speaking, it  no different from using Google Chrome.\"\n</blockquote><p>With that said, <a href=\"http://links.twibright.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Links browser</a> offers a similar environment to Lynx, but with a drop-down menu system. There's also a graphically-capable version called Links2, which will load images when used within a graphical user interface.</p><p><a href=\"http://w3m.sourceforge.net/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">w3m browser</a> also has its roots in text mode, but is able to display images in terminal interfaces that have graphical capability. It can open multiple tabs too, which is a dealbreaker for some users. It should, however, be recognised, that once you start loading images, you also potentially start loading tracking pixels, so the more you head towards conventional 2020s browsing, the more you head towards conventional 2020s surveillance. True text-only is clean. You're only hitting the one domain that delivers the basic page structure. Strict first-party. But add graphics (which can be served from third-party domains), and you then have to start thinking about content-blocking if you want high-level privacy.</p><p>Dillo is an independent graphical browser still available via many Linux package managers, but the main distribution and information hub  has gone down within the past week or so, and is currently displaying a domain expired message. Here's <a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20220511073123/https://www.dillo.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">the archived version of the site</a>, which gives an insight into the project. Dillo has proved how difficult it is for a small provider to maintain a fully-fledged graphical browser in a world where even the heavily-funded Mozilla can barely keep up. It struggles to render modern pages due to the ceaseless evolution of non-standard page-creation techniques. And whilst Lynx is more primitive, its adherence to text-only delivery makes it both more predictable for the reader, and easier for the web page developer to cater for.</p><p>The last alternative option I'm going to cite has a different concept. <a href=\"https://www.gnu.org/software/wget/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Wget</a> doesn't display content at all. It simply fetches the page, brings it back to your device and saves it. Provided the page can feasibly be read offline, you can then view the saved content privately in any browser of your choice. Make sure your Web connection is closed when you do so though - otherwise the browser will call online servers for any resources that the bot didn't fetch, and what you're doing may be little different from just visiting the page \"live\". Also, since Wget is a bot, it will frequently be blocked. And of course, you need to know the URL of the page you want in advance, which means spontaneous reading is off the agenda.</p><p>Whilst there are other options, my recommendation for simple online reading is Lynx. The things Lynx is incapable of doing will doubtless piss off the majority of Web-surfers. But those same incapabilities will piss off Big Tech just that little bit more. And that, for me, gives the browser almost unprecedented value. It's not the browser that  track you. Disable cookies, and it's the browser that literally .</p>","contentLength":13701,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43119238"},{"title":"Running Pong in 240 browser tabs","url":"https://eieio.games/blog/running-pong-in-240-browser-tabs/","date":1740080008,"author":"pr337h4m","guid":7491,"unread":true,"content":"<p>What do you do with your unclosed browser tabs?

The ball and paddles are able to cleanly move between the canvas in the foregrounded window and all of the tabs above.</p><p>You can see the (awful) code <a href=\"https://github.com/nolenroyalty/faviconic\">here</a>. But how does this work?</p><div data-is-footnote=\"true\"><div><div><div><p>A favicon is the little image that a browser shows you in the tab bar when you\nvisit a website.</p></div></div></div></div><p>FlappyFavi is great, but it’s a little hard to see what’s going on because favicons are so small. I figured I could fix that.</p><p>My best idea for how to fix this was by drawing an image across multiple tabs. And that gave me a few problems:</p><ul><li>How do I create a nice grid of tabs to draw on?</li><li>How do I update those tabs, even when they’re backgrounded?</li><li>How do the tabs coordinate?</li></ul><p>My first problem was figuring out how to make a grid of tabs. I started by opening up a chrome window and mashing the “new tab” button until the tabs were really small. That gave me something that looked like this:</p><div><img alt=\"A tiny row of tabs. The favicons form a grid.\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"526\" height=\"78\" decoding=\"async\" data-nimg=\"1\" src=\"https://eieio.games/images/running-pong-in-240-browser-tabs/tabbar-single.png\"></div><p>That seemed promising! We’ve got a nice grid. And if I opened a second window and positioned it just right I could add a second row.</p><p>But I wanted a  grid. Doing this by hand would be a pain. So I turned to one of my favorite tools: AppleScript.</p><p>AppleScript is a <a href=\"https://eieio.games/blog/flappy-bird-in-macos-finder/#toc:vsync-at-home-applescript-and-double-buffering\">powerful and bizarre</a> way to control programs on Mac; you  write English, but it’s verbose and strict enough that mostly you end up writing Python with a lot of extra words.</p><p>But it was a great fit here. I wrote a script that opened up 8 chrome windows with 30 tabs each, carefully positioning each chrome window to stack on top of each other.</p><div><p>I think it's pretty fun to watch this at work!</p></div><p>There were a couple of annoying problems here - for example, chrome tries to re-open your closed tabs, so the script needs to clear those out at the start.</p><p>But the code ends up being relatively simple. The core looks like this:</p><pre><code></code></pre><p>The next problem was around  favicons.</p><p>By default browsers look at some known URLs for favicons. But you can also add an element in the  of your HTML that says “hey, my favicon is here.”</p><p>If you update that element, the browser will change the icon. This is how FlappyFavi works. Anecdotally it seems like chrome will update the icon about 4 times a second .</p><div data-is-footnote=\"true\"><div><div><div><p>I’m not sure how other browsers handle this. Notably Firefox lets you upload\n favicons, which would have been really useful here. But Firefox\ndidn’t let me make a grid of tabs small enough that I could draw effectively\nto it, so I stuck with Chrome. Wish I could have played with animations\nthough!</p></div></div></div></div><p>But it wasn’t clear to me how this would work when a tab was backgrounded. Browsers restrict the resources that a tab has access to when it is backgrounded to improve performance - and most of our tabs wouldn’t be in the foreground!</p><p>I did some simple testing with a tiny loop that updated the favicon every 250 ms. And sure enough, that loop only ran ~once a second in a backgrounded tab!</p><div><p>the backgrounded tab is too slow!</p></div><p>My  loop was being throttled! I started kicking around ideas for how to work around this.</p><p>My first idea was to abuse the <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Audio_API\">web audio APIs</a> - I know they have good support for audio continuing in the background and you can add some kinds of callbacks to audio code; I tried playing an inaudible tone and putting my code in the audio thread to see if that’d help. But I couldn’t get this working.</p><p>So I tried out <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Workers_API/Using_web_workers\">web workers</a>. Web workers are a way to offload a computationally-heavy task off of the main browser thread (so that you don’t block rendering). And I thought they might be less throttled.</p><p>I moved my timer to the web worker and had it post messages back to the main document when my timer triggered. And this worked great!</p><p>The code here is a little long but relatively simple. We have a worker that cycles through emojis and turns them into data URLs that we pass back to the main tab, which updates the favicon.</p><p>So that gives us quick updates. But if we want something to run across all of our tabs we need those tabs to synchronize. How should our tabs communicate?</p><p>Tab communication had two sub problems:</p><ul><li>How does each tab know where it is? That is, how do I know that I’m the third tab in the second window?</li><li>What communication channel should I use to update my tabs?</li></ul><p>The first problem was relatively easy - you might have noticed the solution in my AppleScript code above. I had my script pass in the current window and tab index as a query parameter. Each tab just needs to extract those query parameters and it knows its window and tab index - basically its x and y coordinates.</p><p>The second problem was a little more interesting. The most obvious solution to me was to use websockets - I could have a server that each tab connected to, and that server could tell each tab what to do.</p><p>I whipped up a simple proof of concept. On load, tabs (inside a web worker) created a websocket connection to a server and then updated their favicon based on the data the server sent. The server sent two different images, staggered based on whether the tab’s index was even or odd.</p><p>This worked ok. I saw two problems:</p><ul><li> I just didn’t want to have a server! I wanted to be able to deploy this to browser tabs across the world.</li><li> The tabs were out of sync! The server pumped out updates to a tab as soon as it connected, and it took a while for every tab to load.</li></ul><p>To address the first point, I moved to <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Broadcast_Channel_API\">broadcast channels</a> - basically a way to distribute information across different tabs on the same domain. This was different from websockets - websockets are 1 to 1 but broadcasting is 1 to many. But that seemed like a better fit for what I was doing anyway.</p><p>The second just required a little more code. I taught backgrounded tabs to send a  message containing their tab and window index over the broadcast channel. The  tab  (the one in the foreground, which isn’t throttled) listened for these messages and sent back an , after which the backgrounded tab would stop trying to register. And then once the main tab had received registration events for every backgrounded tab, it started running the animation.</p><div data-is-footnote=\"true\"><div><div><div><p>My applescript added an extra query parameter to tell the last tab opened that\nit was the main tab, along with parameters telling it how many windows and\ntabs were opened.</p></div></div></div></div><p>Once I had reasonable control over my tabs, I started thinking about what I should actually build. I thought it’d be cool if I could draw something in my foregrounded tab and then have that move “into” the tab bar.</p><p>I started with a simple rectangle.</p><p>To do this I needed to imagine a canvas that extended from my foregrounded window through all of the favicons above it, and then draw to the favicons as well as the main canvas based on an object’s position.</p><p>There’s this quote from Teller (of Penn and Teller) that I think about a lot when I make projects like this.</p><blockquote><p>Sometimes magic is just someone spending more time on something than anyone\nelse might reasonably expect.</p></blockquote><p>And while I want to be careful to not make  of this comparison - I am no Teller!! - I had it in mind while doing this.</p><p>There’s no magic here. Honestly, I just spent a while taking measurements.</p><div><img alt=\"Several stacked chrome windows. Measurements indicate how tall and wide various spans (like the distance between the left side of the window and the first tab) are\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1900\" height=\"1314\" decoding=\"async\" data-nimg=\"1\" src=\"https://eieio.games/images/running-pong-in-240-browser-tabs/annotated-chrome.png\"></div><p>There are 92 pixels between the left side of a chrome window and the first favicon (at least with this many tabs open). And 58 pixels between the bottom of a favicon and the top of the actual window. And favicons are 16x16, and, and, and…</p><p>My code takes all of those measurements, along with some information about the number of open tabs and windows, and uses it to:</p><ul><li>Calculate the width of the canvas that it displays, so that it’s perfectly aligned with the favicons above it.</li><li>Calculate the width of each tab</li><li>Determine with width and height of the entire “canvas” that it’s drawing to - including the rows of favicons, the URL bar, and the actual canvas in the window.</li></ul><div><img alt=\"Code that encodes the pixel measurements from the above image.\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1330\" height=\"468\" decoding=\"async\" data-nimg=\"1\" src=\"https://eieio.games/images/running-pong-in-240-browser-tabs/code-measurements.png\"></div><p>We then simulate a rectangle moving across our “full” canvas. When part of it is below the URL bar, we draw it to our “real canvas.” But we also calculate which parts of it are “above” the URL bar, and broadcast that to our other tabs. Each tab calculates its own pixel coordinates (based on the math we did above) and updates itself with white or black pixels based on where the rectangle is.</p><p>This worked ok! But it used a surprising amount of resources - you can see that because the animation on the canvas starts and stops, even though it’s being drawn inside  and  be smooth.</p><p>Since the animation was jerky, I figured something on the foregrounded tab’s thread was using too many resources. There wasn’t  much going on there, but I figured maybe I was transmitting too much data.</p><p>My main thread computed the state of every favicon pixel and then stuff that into the broadcast channel, which was read by hundreds of tabs. You could imagine a broadcast implementation that did a copy for every tab…maybe that was too much copying? I was skeptical, but had no better guess.</p><p>I reworked my code to just broadcast the  of the square and had each tab compute on the fly whether its favicon intersected with the square. But this didn’t seem to help! I was baffled.</p><p>I fell back on the age-old technique of disabling different bits of code until stuff worked, and eventually I hit on the issue; I was creating hundreds of favicons a second, and that was too slow.</p><p>Basically, my code did something like this in each tab to create a 4x4 black and white image and turn that into a URL that I could point my favicon to.</p><pre><code></code></pre><p>And this code re-ran on each “frame” whether the resulting canvas had changed or not. I had hundreds of tabs that were re-creating tiny white square favicons multiple times a second!</p><p>I updated my code to only update the favicon if something changed and performance improved dramatically.</p><p>To be honest, I’m still a little confused about why this work slowed down my animation. I understand how doing too much work in other tabs could slow down my whole machine (and I was using a decent amount of CPU), but my machine had plenty of cores to spare! I’m clearly ignorant of some aspect of browser resource usage.</p><p>After getting my moving square working, I spent some time cleaning up my code just enough that I had a little “engine” that I could write my code against. And then I started thinking of games to make.</p><p>The first game I thought of was snake. I figured that snake was naturally block-based (which fits well with the favicons) and pretty easy to program. So I wrote the first part of a snake implementation .</p><div data-is-footnote=\"true\"><div><div><div><p>The snake trick were you move it by keeping an array of snake positions and on\nevery tick just chop off the tail and add a new head based on the current\ndirection always delights me</p></div></div></div></div><p>But I quickly ran into a problem. Maybe you can see it.</p><div><p>this was pretty fun to play with</p></div><p>The issue - at least to me - is that snake is  block-based. Some of the beauty of the moving rectangle animation is how it moves from continuous (on the canvas) to discrete (in the tab bar). I think it’s most natural to think of snake as a game operating over a discrete (and small) set of snake cell sized blocks.</p><p>So I tried to come up with a new game . Eventually I settled on Pong, since the ball and tabs would have to regularly move between the canvas and the tab bar, which I thought was a cool effect.</p><div data-is-footnote=\"true\"><div><div><div><p>Thanks for everyone on\n<a href=\"https://bsky.app/profile/itseieio.bsky.social/post/3lihzhirmcc2j\">bsky</a> and\n<a href=\"https://x.com/itseieio/status/1891929602722869741\">twitter</a> that offered game\nideas without knowing what I was trying to do!</p></div></div></div></div><p>And then I implemented pong!</p><p>To be honest, I don’t have too much to say about this part. I have enough practice writing games that getting pong working once I had a good API for drawing was pretty simple.</p><p>I guess I can give you a few notes on my implementation:</p><ul><li>The computer player (on the right side) just tries to keep the center of its paddle aligned with the center of the ball at all times</li><li>I do some simple trig to compute the angle the ball should bounce off of the paddle (relative to the paddle’s center).

As part of its <a href=\"https://julialang.org/blog/2024/10/julia-1.11-highlights/\">1.11&nbsp;release</a> from late 2024, Julia made several inroads into areas\noutside of its traditional focus, provided its users with advances in\ntooling, and has seen several improvements in performance and programmer\nconvenience. \nThese recent developments in and\naround Julia go a long way to answer several longstanding complaints from\nboth new and experienced users. We last <a href=\"https://lwn.net/Articles/958337/\">looked\nin on the language</a> one year ago,\nfor its previous major release, Julia&nbsp;1.10. \n</p><p>\nIt's simple to share Julia projects in environments where \nJulia is already installed: provide the text files containing the program and one\nadditional text file, called , which lists the direct\ndependencies of the code. This latter file is generated automatically by\nJulia. The recipient need merely execute the single command <a href=\"https://pkgdocs.julialang.org/v1/environments/#Using-someone-else's-project\"></a>\nto have Julia install any needed packages to exactly reproduce the\nenvironment.\n</p><p>\nThis works well with colleagues who happen to be Julia users; it is great\nfor collaborative development and for reproducibility in scientific\nresearch. However, it's a dead end for colleagues who do not have Julia\ninstalled. Distributing the program in the\nform of an \n\"app\" would solve the problem, but a normal installation of Julia provides\nno obvious way to do this. \n</p><p>\nAs Julia is a compiled language, one might wonder what the problem\nis. After all, you can compile your Fortran or C program into a compact,\nself-contained (perhaps, depending on shared libraries) binary, and even\ntarget a variety of architectures with cross-compilation. Anyone can run\nthese binaries, without a compiler installed.\n</p><p>\nIt has also been possible to compile a Julia program into a static binary\nfor some time, using the <a href=\"https://github.com/JuliaLang/PackageCompiler.jl\">PackageCompiler\npackage</a>. Experienced Julia hands use this package to create \"system\nimages\" (or \"sysimages\") that contain the Julia runtime along with frozen\nversions of packages used in their projects. These sysimages load instantly\nand save time when one is not currently using the Julia read-eval-print\nloop (REPL).\n</p><p>\nThe major improvements in precompilation and package-loading times that\ncame with 1.10 largely obsoleted the use of PackageCompiler to save\nstartup time. PackageCompiler might still be a solution to the problem of binary\ndistribution except for one serious issue: the binaries that it\ngenerates are huge.\n</p><p>\nThe sysimages created by PackageCompiler contain the Julia runtime, the\nentire standard library, parts of the LLVM\ncompiler, and more. The result is that a \"hello, world\" program is burdened\nwith about 150MB of stuff that it does not use. (The compiled \"hello,\nworld\" program will, for example, contain the BLAS linear algebra routines,\nbecause, in its current state of development, PackageCompiler does not\nfigure out that they are not needed.) This is a vast improvement over\nearlier incarnations of PackageCompiler, which turned \"hello world\" into a\ngargantuan 900MB, but does not compare well with, for example, the Fortran\nequivalent. I just used the <a href=\"https://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/GFortran\"></a> compiler to\nprocess a Fortran&nbsp;90 \"hello world\" program and found that it resulted\nin a\ntiny 17KB binary.\n</p><p>\nEfforts toward reducing the size of binaries have also involved another package for static\ncompilation. This package is only useful for relatively small Julia\nprograms, however, and is confined to a severely limited set of language\nfeatures. Within these limitations, <a href=\"https://github.com/tshort/StaticCompiler.jl\">StaticCompiler</a> can produce truly small binaries, similar\nin size\nto those produced by C and Fortran. Because of the limitations, however, interest\nremained focused on the evolution of PackageCompiler.\n</p><p>\nWhy can't PackageCompiler just strip out the unneeded stuff and create\nbinaries of a reasonable size? That's the obvious question, but finding a\nway to eliminate the unneeded baggage turned out to be a difficult\nproblem. Julia's dynamic design and its focus on REPL-driven development\nmean that its runtime and \"just-ahead-of-time\" compiler were envisioned to\nbe always available behind the scenes. They are used to compile new methods\nfor newly-encountered mixtures of argument types and to keep the whole\narray of language features at the ready, including various types of\nintrospection. This is the essential reason that binaries created by\nPackageCompiler are so large, and why so much work was required to allow\nthe programmer nearly full use of all language features while not dragging\nthe entire runtime along with each compilation target.\n</p><p>\nThe goal of creating small binaries has occupied a handful of talented\ndevelopers over the past few years, and they have recently achieved a new\nlevel of success. Development builds of Julia now include an experimental\nmethod of invoking the compiler called . This compiler\ninvocation script <a href=\"https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/commit/97ecdb8595c4a1fbe68ba6f39b3244e8cdabc2c6\">comes\nwith a  flag</a> that \"trims\" away whatever is not needed to\nrun the program, while still allowing the use of nearly all normal Julia\nfeatures. The idea is that the user will be able to type  at\nthe terminal, instead of , to compile a binary rather than\nrun a program or start the REPL. The result is an impressive 90% reduction\nin final binary size compared with the current version of PackageCompiler.\nThe exact size of \"hello world\" is fluctuating some in the development\nbuilds as of this writing, but it is around 900KB.\n</p><p>\nThe next major Julia release,&nbsp;1.12, is likely to appear in mid-2025. It will finally include the ability to generate static\nbinaries of a reasonable size, appropriate for distribution. This will be a\nrefinement of the  mechanism that is already merged into the\ndevelopment branch.\n</p><p>\nStatic compilation  will be the definitive answer to the complaints and\nwishes of many \nJulia programmers who have wanted their favorite language to be able to do\nwhat the traditional workhorses for scientific computing have done for decades.\n</p><p>\nJulia has always been easy to install and upgrade on operating systems\nsuch as Linux and BSD: simply download and expand the tarball\nand place a link to the  binary in your\n. Julia's <a href=\"https://lwn.net/Articles/871490/\">package\nsystem</a> also makes it easy to keep any number of Julia versions\ninstalled on the same machine, with dependencies correctly resolved for\nprojects using different versions of the language.\nHowever, it's clear from questions on forums that there are many users of\nJulia who are less comfortable using command-line tools to navigate their\nfilesystems. Installing, upgrading, or switching among versions often leads\nto confusion.\n</p><p>\nNow there is a utility called \"<a href=\"https://github.com/JuliaLang/juliaup\"></a>\" to make\ntheir lives simpler. As  has become the <a href=\"https://julialang.org/downloads/\">recommended</a> way to\ninstall and upgrade Julia, it's now widely used even by Linux adopters\n(although I am set in my ways and don't bother with it).\n does provide some useful abstractions. These are built\naround its concept of \"channels\". Some examples of \nchannels are , referring to the latest stable version of\nJulia; , referring to the \"long term support\" release;\n, pointing to the most recent beta; and ,\npointing to, perhaps unsurprisingly, the nightly build. Thanks to this\nchannel abstraction, one need never refer to Julia's version numbers.\n</p><p>\nTo get the latest nightly, a user simply types:\n</p><p> also provides a new, flexible  command for starting\nthe language.\nTo run the nightly build, the command is:\n</p><p>\nAfter executing the command:\n</p><pre>    $ juliaup default release\n</pre><p>\nthe plain  command will now use the stable release.\n</p><p>\nThese are just a few examples of how  works. It comes with\na collection of other commands to do such things as list available\nchannels, update all channels at once, or refer to specific Julia versions,\nas well.\n</p><p>\nThese days, fairly complex simulations written in Julia can run completely\nwithin the web browser.\nAlexander Barth has created a fun and addictive <a href=\"https://alexander-barth.github.io/FluidSimDemo-WebAssembly/\">simulation\nof fluid flow</a> that runs in the browser. The visitor can draw\nboundaries with the mouse and watch the pressure field adapt. The same\nauthor has also created a browser-based <a href=\"https://alexander-barth.github.io/FluidSimDemo-WebAssembly/ShallowWater/\">simulation\nof surface waves</a>. Those with an interest in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaos_theory\">chaos theory</a> can find an <a href=\"https://tshort.github.io/WebAssemblyCompiler.jl/stable/examples/lorenz/\">in-browser\nsolution</a> of the famous Lorenz system of ordinary differential\nequations. It's remarkably fast, and the demonstration comes with a\ntutorial explaining how it was done.\n</p><p>\nThese three examples were written not in JavaScript, but in Julia, and run\nin the browser thanks to <a href=\"https://webassembly.org\">WebAssembly</a>. <a href=\"https://lwn.net/Articles/648510/\">Launched</a> in&nbsp;2015, WebAssembly\n(often abbreviated \"Wasm\") is a binary instruction format that has become\nwidely deployed in modern web browsers. It potentially allows any language\nto run in a browser, provided someone has written a WebAssembly compiler\nfor it.\n</p><p>\nThe <a href=\"https://wasmlang.org\">growing list</a> of source languages\nwith WebAssembly compilers in various stages of development is\nencouraging. We can already use <a href=\"https://lwn.net/Articles/898452/\">Python</a>, C, Go, Lua, Rust, and\nmany others as replacements for JavaScript. However, despite the impressive\nexamples above, Julia for WebAssembly is still in the early stages of\ndevelopment. Only a restricted subset of the language is supported (for\nexample, no multidimensional arrays). However, the problems encountered in\ncreating small binaries have some overlap with the problems of targeting\nWebAssembly, so recent progress in the former is likely to help speed along\nthe latter.\n</p><p>\nReaders interested in getting their Julia programs running in the browser\nshould start with the <a href=\"https://tshort.github.io/WebAssemblyCompiler.jl/stable\">WebAssemblyCompiler</a>\npackage. The author warns that the code is experimental, but it comes with\nguided examples.\n</p><p>\nThe <a href=\"https://discourse.julialang.org/t/julia-v1-11-3-has-been-released/125056\">latest\nrelease</a> of Julia is&nbsp;1.11.3, unveiled on January&nbsp;21,&nbsp;2025. The <a href=\"https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/NEWS/#Julia-v1.11-Release-Notes\">release notes</a> for the\n1.11&nbsp;major version, which appeared on October&nbsp;8, provide detailed\ninformation on the improvements to the language in that release. Here I'll\nsummarize some of the most important and interesting language developments since&nbsp;1.10.\n</p><p> datatype: many array operations had been implemented in C\nup to now, which <a href=\"https://hackmd.io/@vtjnash/GenericMemory\">created some overhead</a>. These have now been moved to Julia\ncode thanks to a <a href=\"https://hackmd.io/@vtjnash/GenericMemory#New-Builtin-functions\">new\ndatatype called </a>. The performance improvements coming\nfrom this change include a\ndoubling in speed of the  function that inserts items\nonto the end of an array. The maintainer of the WebAssembly\npackage remarked that the  datatype will finally allow\nmultidimensional arrays to be used in Julia programs destined for\nWebAssembly.\n</p><p> keyword: as pointed out in our article about Julia's\npackage system, names in a module can be explicitly exported, which allows\ntheir use without namespacing. For example, Base is a library that is\nautomatically imported into every Julia environment. It provides hundreds\nof functions, from basic mathematical workhorses such as  to\nstring manipulation routines such as .  Julia programmers\ncan use these functions by invoking their unadorned names because they are\nexported by the modules in which they are defined.\n</p><p>\nHowever, Base also\ncontains functions useful in more unusual contexts that are not\nexported. One example is , which returns something\nlike the interval , but slightly different in the way that it's\ntreated by the type system. Those who know that they need this function\nmust namespace it by prefixing . Although not exported,\n is \"safe\" to use; it's intended for public\nconsumption and will not break future code. This is  the case for\nevery unexported function defined in every module.  Up to now, there was no\nstandard way to tell the difference between a safe unexported function and\none that should be considered \"private\", in the sense that it may not be\nfuture-proof. Now <a href=\"https://julialang.org/blog/2024/10/julia-1.11-highlights/#new_public_keyword\">Julia's\n keyword</a> fills this gap by marking names that are safe\nto use even if they are not exported. Of course Julia will not stop programmers\nfrom using names not so blessed, but now it will warn them.\n</p><p><a href=\"https://julialang.org/blog/2024/10/julia-1.11-highlights/#stdlib_excision\">\nexcision</a>: Julia&nbsp;1.11 continues the process that has been underway for a\ncouple of years to remove modules from the standard library and turn them\ninto normal packages. This allows them to be developed independently from\nreleases of the language, which generally allows a faster pace of\nimprovements. It also allows Julia to be distributed with a smaller\nsysimage, purged of unnecessary libraries, that can start faster and\nconsume less memory. In the latest release, modules from stdlib will all have\ntheir own version numbers, formalizing their independent existence.\n</p><p>: Julia&nbsp;1.11 <a href=\"https://julialang.org/blog/2024/10/julia-1.11-highlights/#new_main_entry_point\">added\na  macro</a> that marks which function in a Julia program\nfile will be the entry point when the program is run (rather than\nimported). This lets programmers use the same file as a resource imported\ninto other programs and as a file to be executed. For example, a module\nthat consists of a list of function definitions can be imported into\nanother program without any side effects. But if one of those functions is\ndecorated with , then, if the same file is \n(for instance by typing \"\"), in addition to the\nfunctions being defined, the one so marked will be run. This is\nsemantically identical to inserting a line at the bottom of the file\ninvoking the name of the main function; thanks to , one\nversion of the file can now be used both ways.\n</p><p>\nDue to the accumulation of improvements in the last several versions of\nJulia, startup times have become fast enough that I have begun to use the\nlanguage for utility scripting, something that would have been impractical\na few years ago. This trend continues in the most recent version, and the\ngreater ease of compiling programs promised in the next version should make\nJulia even more suited for building system utilities. It's already become a\nserious contender to replace Bash and Python for my purposes.\nIf WebAssembly targeting continues to make progress, which the improvements\nto compilation will also contribute to, then Julia will become a\nwelcome replacement for (or addition to) JavaScript as well, further\nextending its scope of application.\n</p><p>\nA solution to the problem of small binaries, to be released as part of&nbsp;1.12, should\nallay the misgivings of those for whom the difficulty of sharing compiled\nprograms has kept them away from the language.\nFor Julia's core original audience, who were accustomed to amortizing large\ncompilation times over simulation times measured in days or weeks, the new\nlanguage's awkwardness in some interactive contexts was an acceptable\ntradeoff to finally have a modern, expressive medium that did not entail\ncompromises in performance.\nBy successfully meeting the objections of Julia's critics in several key\nareas, its developers have ensured that their language is poised to widen\nits scope far beyond that original core user base.\n</p>","contentLength":14754,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43118962"},{"title":"OpenEuroLLM","url":"https://openeurollm.eu/","date":1740077868,"author":"richardfontana","guid":7416,"unread":true,"content":"<div><h2>GOALS TOWARDS PERFORMANT AND TRANSPARENT AI</h2><div><div><p>Extend the multilingual capabilities of existing models for EU official languages and beyond.</p></div><div><p>Ensure easy and sustainable access to foundational models ready to be fine-tuned to a wide range of applications.</p></div><div><p>Extend the number of evaluation results in all EU official languages and beyond, including AI safety and alignment with the AI Act and European AI standards</p></div><div><p>Extend the number of available training datasets and benchmarks for these languages, and make them easily accessible.</p></div><div><p>Share transparently the tools, recipes and intermediate results of the training processes.</p></div><div><p>Share the dataset enrichment and anonymization pipelines to enable further data sourcing for future needs.</p></div><div><p>Create an active and engaged community of developers and stakeholders among the public and private sector.</p></div></div></div>","contentLength":824,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43118634"},{"title":"AWS S3 SDK breaks its compatible services","url":"https://xuanwo.io/links/2025/02/aws_s3_sdk_breaks_its_compatible_services/","date":1740077684,"author":"ulrischa","guid":7415,"unread":true,"content":"<p>First of all, this is a good thing for me because checksums like  looks great—it's fast, secure, and has excellent SIMD support.

This is the cloud platform for DeepEval (<a href=\"https://github.com/confident-ai/deepeval\">https://github.com/confident-ai/deepeval</a>), our open-source package that helps engineers evaluate and unit-test LLM applications. Think Pytest for LLMs.<p>We spent the past year building DeepEval with the goal of providing the best LLM evaluation developer experience, growing it to run over 600K evaluations daily in CI/CD pipelines of enterprises like BCG, AstraZeneca, AXA, and Capgemini. But the fact that DeepEval simply runs, and does nothing with the data afterward, isn’t the best experience. If you want to inspect failing test cases, identify regressions, or even pick the best model/prompt combination, you need more than just DeepEval. That’s why we built a platform around it.</p><p>Confident AI is great for RAG pipelines, agents, and chatbots. Typical use cases involve allowing companies to switch the underlying LLM, rewrite prompts for newer (and possibly cheaper) models, and keep test sets in sync with the codebase where DeepEval tests are run.</p><p>Our platform features a \"dataset editor,\" a \"regression catcher,\" and \"iteration insights\". The datasets editor in Confident AI allows domain experts to edit datasets while keeping them in sync with your codebase for evaluation. We’ll then generate sharable LLM testing/benchmark reports once DeepEval has finished running evaluations on these datasets that are pulled from the cloud. The regression catcher then identifies any regressions in your new implementation, and we use these evaluation results to determine the best iteration based on your metric scores.</p><p>Our goal is to make benchmarking LLM applications so reliable that picking the best implementation is as simple as reading the metric values off the dashboard. To achieve this, the quality of curated datasets and the accuracy and reliability of metrics must be the highest possible.</p><p>This brings us to our current limitations. Right now, DeepEval’s primary evaluation method is LLM-as-a-judge. We use techniques such as GEval and question-answer generation to improve reliability, but these methods can still be inconsistent. Even with high-quality datasets curated by domain experts, our evaluation metrics remain the biggest blocker to our goal.</p><p>To address this, we recently released a DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) metric in DeepEval. It is a decision-tree-based, LLM-as-a-judge metric that provides deterministic results by breaking a test case into finer atomic units. Each edge represents a decision, each node represents an LLM evaluation step, and each leaf node returns a score. It works best in scenarios where success criteria are clearly defined, such as text summarization.</p><p>The DAG metric is still in its early stages, but our hope is that by moving towards better, code-driven, open-source metrics, Confident AI can deliver deterministic LLM benchmarks that anyone can blindly trust.</p><p>The platform runs on a freemium tier, and we've dropped the need to signup with a work email for the next four days.</p><p>Looking forward to your thoughts!</p>","contentLength":3102,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43116633"},{"title":"A cryptocurrency scam that turned a small town against itself","url":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/19/magazine/cryptocurrency-scam-kansas-heartland-bank.html","date":1740067762,"author":"lxm","guid":7314,"unread":true,"content":"<p>It was July 2023, and Tucker was hosting a meeting of the board of Heartland Tri-State Bank, a community-owned business in a small Kansas town called Elkhart.

A single set of Helix neural network weights runs simultaneously on two robots as they work together to put away groceries neither robot has ever seen before.</figcaption></figure><p><b>New Scaling for Humanoid Robotics</b></p><p>The home presents robotics' greatest challenge. Unlike controlled industrial settings, homes are filled with countless objects–delicate glassware, crumpled clothing, scattered toys–each with unpredictable shapes, sizes, colors, and textures. For robots to be useful in households, they will need to be capable of generating intelligent new behaviors on-demand, especially for objects they've never seen before.</p><p>The current state of robotics will not scale to the home without a step change. Teaching robots even a single new behavior currently requires substantial human effort: either hours of PhD-level expert manual programming or thousands of demonstrations. Both are prohibitively expensive when we consider how vast the problem of the home truly is.</p><p>But other domains of AI have mastered this kind of instant generalization. What if we could simply translate the rich semantic knowledge captured in Vision Language Models (VLMs) directly into robot actions? This new capability would fundamentally alter robotics' scaling trajectory (Figure 1). Suddenly, new skills that once took hundreds of demonstrations could be obtained instantly just by talking to robots in natural language. The key problem becomes: how do we extract all this common-sense knowledge from VLMs and translate it into generalizable robot control? We built Helix to bridge this gap.</p><h2>Helix: A \"System 1, System 2\" VLA for Whole Upper Body Control</h2><p>Helix is a first-of-its-kind \"System 1, System 2\" VLA model for high-rate, dexterous control of the entire humanoid upper body.&nbsp;</p><p>Prior approaches face a fundamental tradeoff: VLM backbones are general, but not fast, and robot visuomotor policies are fast but not general. Helix resolves this tradeoff through two complementary systems, trained end-to-end to communicate:</p><ul><li><p>System 2 (S2): An onboard internet-pretrained VLM operating at 7-9 Hz for scene understanding and language comprehension, enabling broad generalization across objects and contexts.</p></li><li><p>System 1 (S1): A fast reactive visuomotor policy that translates the latent semantic representations produced by S2 into precise continuous robot actions at 200 Hz.</p></li></ul><p>This decoupled architecture allows each system to operate at its optimal timescale. S2 can \"think slow\" about high-level goals, while S1 can \"think fast\" to execute and adjust actions in real-time. For example, during collaborative behavior (see Video 2), S1 quickly adapts to the changing motions of a partner robot while maintaining S2's semantic objectives.</p><figure><figcaption>Video 2: Helix allows for fast fine grained motor adjustments, necessary when reacting to a collaborative partner, while carrying out novel semantic goals.</figcaption></figure><p>Helix's design offers several key advantages over existing approaches:</p><ul><li><p>: Helix matches the speed of specialized single-task behavioral cloning policies while generalizing zero-shot to thousands of novel test objects.</p></li><li><p>: Helix directly outputs continuous control for high-dimensional action spaces, avoiding complex action tokenization schemes used in prior VLA approaches, which have shown some success in low-dimensional control setups (e.g. binarized parallel grippers) but face scaling challenges with high-dimensional humanoid control.</p></li><li><p>: Helix uses standard architectures - an open source, open weight VLM for System 2 and a simple transformer-based visuomotor policy for S1.</p></li><li><p>: Decoupling S1 and S2 allows us to iterate on each system separately, without constraints of finding unified observation space or action representations.</p></li></ul><h2>Model and Training Details</h2><p>We collect a high quality, multi-robot, multi-operator dataset of diverse teleoperated behaviors, ~500 hours in total. To generate natural language-conditioned training pairs, we use an auto-labeling VLM to generate hindsight instructions. The VLM processes segmented video clips from the onboard robot cameras, prompted with: \"What instruction would you have given the robot to get the action seen in this video?\" All items handled during training are excluded from evaluations to prevent contamination.</p><p>Our system comprises two main components: S2, a VLM backbone, and S1, a latent-conditional visuomotor transformer. S2 is built on a 7B-parameter open-source, open-weight VLM pretrained on internet-scale data. It processes monocular robot images and robot state information (consisting of wrist pose and finger positions) after projecting them into vision-language embedding space. Combined with natural language commands specifying desired behaviors, S2 distills all semantic task-relevant information into a single continuous latent vector, passed to S1 to condition its low-level actions.</p><p>S1, an 80M parameter cross-attention encoder-decoder transformer, handles low-level control. It relies on a fully convolutional, multi-scale vision backbone for visual processing, initialized from pretraining done entirely in simulation. While S1 receives the same image and state inputs as S2, it processes them at a higher frequency to enable more responsive closed-loop control. The latent vector from S2 is projected into S1's token space and concatenated with visual features from S1's vision backbone along the sequence dimension, providing task conditioning.</p><p>S1 outputs full upper body humanoid control at 200hz, including desired wrist poses, finger flexion and abduction control, and torso and head orientation targets. We append to the action space a synthetic \"percentage task completion\" action, allowing Helix to predict its own termination condition, which makes it easier to sequence multiple learned behaviors.</p><p>Helix is trained fully end-to-end, mapping from raw pixels and text commands to continuous actions with a standard regression loss. Gradients are backpropagated from S1 into S2 via the latent communication vector used to condition S1's behavior, allowing joint optimization of both components. Helix requires no task-specific adaptation; it maintains a single training stage and single set of neural network weights without separate action heads or per-task fine-tuning stages.</p><p>During training, we add a temporal offset between S1 and S2 inputs. This offset is calibrated to match the gap between S1 and S2's deployed inference latency, ensuring that the real-time control requirements during deployment are accurately reflected in training.</p><p><b>Optimized Streaming Inference</b></p><p>Helix's training design enables efficient model parallel deployment on Figure robots, each equipped with dual low-power-consumption embedded GPUs. The inference pipeline splits across S2 (high-level latent planning) and S1 (low-level control) models, each running on dedicated GPUs. S2 operates as an asynchronous background process, consuming the latest observation (onboard camera and robot state) and natural language commands. It continuously updates a shared memory latent vector that encodes the high-level behavioral intent.</p><p>S1 executes as a separate real-time process, maintaining the critical 200Hz control loop required for smooth whole upper body action. It takes both the latest observation and the most recent S2 latent vector. The inherent speed difference between S2 and S1 inference naturally results in S1 operating with higher temporal resolution on robot observations, creating a tighter feedback loop for reactive control.&nbsp;</p><p>This deployment strategy deliberately mirrors the temporal offset introduced in training, minimizing the train-inference distribution gap. The asynchronous execution model allows both processes to run at their optimal frequencies, allowing us to run Helix as fast as our fastest single task imitation learning policies.</p><figure><figcaption>Video 3: Helix's VLA controls the full humanoid upper body, a first in robot learning.</figcaption></figure><p><b>Fine-grained VLA whole upper body control</b></p><p>Helix coordinates a 35-DoF action space at 200Hz, controlling everything from individual finger movements to end-effector trajectories, head gaze, and torso posture. Head and torso control pose unique challenges—as they move, they change both what the robot can reach and what it can see, creating feedback loops that have historically caused instability. Video 3 demonstrates this coordination in action: the robot smoothly tracks its hands with its head while adjusting its torso for optimal reach, all while maintaining precise finger control for grasping. Historically, achieving this level of precision with such a high-dimensional action space has been considered extremely challenging, even for a single known task. To our knowledge, no prior VLA system has demonstrated this degree of real-time coordination while maintaining the ability to generalize across tasks and objects.</p><figure><figcaption>Video 4: Helix coordinates precise multi-robot manipulation.</figcaption></figure><p><b>Zero-shot multi-robot coordination</b></p><p>We push Helix to the limit in a challenging multi-agent manipulation scenario: collaborative zero-shot grocery storage between two Figure robots. Video 1 showcases two fundamental advances: The robots successfully manipulate entirely novel groceries—items never encountered during training—demonstrating robust generalization across diverse shapes, sizes, and materials. Additionally, both robots operate using identical Helix model weights, eliminating the need for robot-specific training or explicit role assignments. They achieve coordination through natural language prompts like \"Hand the bag of cookies to the robot on your right\" or \"Receive the bag of cookies from the robot on your left and place it in the open drawer\" (see Video 4). This marks the first demonstration of flexible, extended collaborative manipulation between multiple robots using a VLA, particularly significant given their successful handling of completely novel objects.</p><p><b>Emergent \"Pick up anything\"</b></p><p>We find that Figure robots equipped with Helix can pick up virtually any small household object with a simple \"Pick up the [X]\" command. In systematic testing, the robots successfully handled thousands of novel items in clutter—from glassware and toys to tools and clothing—without any prior demonstrations or custom programming.</p><p>Particularly notable is how Helix bridges the gap between internet-scale language understanding and precise robot control. When prompted to \"Pick up the desert item\", for instance, Helix not only recognizes that a toy cactus matches this abstract concept, but also selects the closest hand and executes the precise motor commands needed to grasp it securely.</p><p>This general-purpose \"language-to-action\" grasping capability opens new exciting new possibilities for humanoid deployment in unstructured environments.</p><figure><figcaption>Video 5: Helix translates high level conceptual commands like \"Pick up the desert item\" to low-level action.</figcaption></figure><p><b>Helix's training is highly efficient</b></p><p>Helix achieves strong object generalization with remarkably few resources. We train Helix with ~500 hours of high quality supervised data in total, a small fraction of the size of previously collected VLA datasets (&lt;5%), and without any dependencies around multi-robot-embodiment collect or multiple stages of training. We note that this is a scale of collect more comparable to modern -task imitation learning datasets. Despite this comparatively small data requirement, Helix scales to the significantly more challenging action space of full upper body humanoid control, with high-rate, high-dimensional outputs.</p><p>Existing VLA systems often require specialized fine-tuning or dedicated action heads to optimize performance across different high-level behaviors. Remarkably, Helix achieves strong performance across diverse tasks with a single unified model. Using just one set of neural network weights (7B for System 2, 80M for System 1), Helix picks and places items in various containers, operates drawers and refrigerators, coordinates dexterous multi-robot handovers, and manipulates thousands of novel objects.</p><figure><figcaption>Video 6: \"Pick up the helix\"</figcaption></figure><p>We have presented Helix, the first Vision-Language-Action model to directly control an entire humanoid upper body from natural language. Unlike earlier robot systems, Helix is capable of generating long-horizon, collaborative, dexterous manipulation on the fly without any task-specific demonstrations or extensive manual programming. Helix displays strong object generalization, being able to pick up thousands of novel household items with varying shapes, sizes, colors, and material properties never encountered before in training, simply by asking in natural language. This represents a transformative step forward in how Figure scales humanoid robot behaviors—one that we believe will be pivotal as our robots increasingly assist in everyday home environments.</p><p>While these early results are truly exciting, we think they only scratch the surface of what is possible. We are eager to see what happens when we scale Helix by 1,000x and beyond. If you’re as fascinated by the possibilities of Helix—and the future of dexterous humanoid robotics, we invite you to join us on this journey.</p><p>Consider joining our Helix team to help scale Embodied AI to millions of robots. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.figure.ai/careers\">Check out our open roles here.

Later, we worked on an AI-powered CRM but it felt like we were having to roll all the AI bits (agentic workflows, evals, RAG) ourselves. We also noticed our friends building AI applications suffering from long iteration cycles: they were getting stuck debugging prompts, figuring out why their agents called (or didn’t call) tools, and writing lots of custom memory retrieval logic.</p><p>At some point we just looked at each other and were like, why aren't we trying to make this part easier, and decided to work on Mastra.</p><p>One thing we heard from folks is that seeing input/output of every step, of every run of every workflow, is very useful. So we took XState and built a workflow graph primitive on top with OTel tracing. We wrote the APIs to make control flow explicit:  `.step()` for branching, `.then()` for chaining, and `.after()` for merging. We also added .`.suspend()/.resume()` for human-in-the-loop.</p><p>We abstracted the main RAG verbs like `.chunk()`, `embed()`, `.upsert(),’ `.query()`, and `rerank()` across document types and vector DBs. We shipped an eval runner with evals like completeness and relevance, plus the ability to write your own.</p><p>Then we read the MemGPT paper and implemented agent memory on top of AI SDK with a `lastMessages` key, `topK` retrieval, and a `messageRange` for surrounding context (think `grep -C`).</p><p>But we still weren’t sure whether our agents were behaving as expected, so we built a local dev playground that lets you curl agents/workflows, chat with agents, view evals and traces across runs, and iterate on prompts with an assistant. The playground uses a local storage layer powered by libsql (thanks Turso team!) and runs on localhost with `npm run dev` (no Docker).</p><p>Mastra agents originally ran inside a Next.js app. But we noticed that AI teams’ development was increasingly decoupled from the rest of their organization, so we built Mastra so that you can also run it as a standalone endpoint or service.</p><p>Some things people have been building so far: one user automates support for an iOS app he owns with tens of thousands of paying users. Another bundled Mastra inside an Electron app that ingests aerospace PDFs and outputs CAD diagrams. Another is building WhatsApp bots that let you chat with objects like your house.</p><p>We did (for now) adopt an Elastic v2 license. The agent space is pretty new, and we wanted to let users do whatever they want with Mastra but prevent, eg, AWS from grabbing it.</p><p>Excited to share Mastra with everyone here – let us know what you think!</p>","contentLength":2986,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43103073"},{"title":"Accelerating scientific breakthroughs

I’m Prithvi, and my co-founder Frances and I built Promptless (<a href=\"https://gopromptless.ai\">https://gopromptless.ai</a>), an AI teammate that proactively updates docs while you ship software.<p>There’s a demo video at <a href=\"https://youtu.be/pmslSl8dOgE\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://youtu.be/pmslSl8dOgE</a>, and also a “Live Demo on Your Own Docs” at <a href=\"https://gopromptless.ai/demo\">https://gopromptless.ai/demo</a> where you can plug in the URL to any existing docs site and simulate a \"trigger event\" to see what Promptless would have suggested. We also opened up the full product with automatic triggers for a free trial for HN this week (if you sign up at <a href=\"https://gopromptless.ai/hn\">https://gopromptless.ai/hn</a>).<p>We built Promptless because we wished we had it, both as doc authors and doc consumers. On the authoring side, I used to run engineering at a fintech company, and since no developer enjoys updating docs, they often went out-of-date and customers complained. On the consuming side, when we write code, we regularly run into mistakes or omissions in vendors’ or dependencies’ docs that slow us down. (This pain seems to be getting more acute with AI coding assistants, since they often rely blindly on docs.)<p>Promptless can be automatically triggered from new PRs or support tickets, or by manually tagging @Promptless in Slack. It integrates via OAuth with tools like Jira, Linear, and Notion, so that it has context about the intent of each change or feature. It drafts new or updated docs and can push them up to wherever docs live, like Readme, Mintlify, Intercom, Zendesk, or a Github repo.<p>How it works: when first connected to your docs, it starts by reviewing each page and building a “product ontology” that understands concepts, entities, and resources, as well as the relationship between them. This can take several minutes to an hour depending on the number of articles. Then, when a new trigger event occurs (such as a new PR), the Promptless agent initializes a session with several tools to find relevant context and draft new or updated documentation.<p>We expected early users to be most excited about automatically updating docs from new PRs, but we were surprised by other use cases from customers. For example, one has a ton of Slack Connect channels with customers, and our killer feature for them is being able to trigger an update from Slack in one click from Slack. Another has a content team separate from their product team, so for them, being able to update guides when the product team publishes release notes every two weeks is really valuable. Others value Promptless because it makes their AI support agents (like Intercom’s Fin AI) perform better, since it makes the source material more accurate and complete.<p>We have also published updates for several open-source projects (like Ansible, Prefect, Ray, and Ollama). Some projects have >40% of recent commits being doc updates/corrections, so having a product like Promptless that automatically suggests those doc updates can make contributing a lot easier and improve the DevEx for end-users.<p>We’d love for you to check us out, and we welcome any suggestions, requests, questions, or criticism! Thank you for reading!</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43092522\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43092522</a></p>\n<p>Points: 95</p>\n<p># Comments:

While Rust is a really mature language, the web ecosystem is still sort of lacking. Let’s change that.</p><p>There is a variety of web  for Rust. There is <a href=\"https://github.com/tokio-rs/axum\">axum</a>, <a href=\"https://rocket.rs/\">Rocket</a>, <a href=\"https://actix.rs/\">Actix</a>, and many more. But most of them are very low-level and are pretty rough even for basic stuff. Cot tries to fill in this gap and tries to create a web framework for lazy developers. While you might be familiar with web servers, routers, and middlewares, what about an administration panel that lets you easily modify your application’s models? What about an ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) that allows you to use your database almost as easily as native Rust object, and handle the migrations, automatically, too? Do you have an unmatched ease of use and the speed to get started? That’s the gap Cot tries to fill in. And yes, there’s Loco (which, by the way, has started after the idea for Cot was born), which is a great framework, but we’re hoping to eventually deliver better experience for easier development by providing more features, better APIs, and stronger decisions.</p><p><a href=\"https://cot.rs\">Cot</a> is a modern, easy-to-use, batteries-included web framework for the Rust programming language. It is inspired by <a href=\"https://www.djangoproject.com/\">Django</a>, so that it should seem familiar if you’ve ever used it, but also easy to learn if you haven’t. Not only does it try to provide you with the tools to “just” create a web application. It tries to provide you much more: sessions, authentication, templates, admin panel – all of that sprinkled with a bit of type-safety of Rust and an extensive documentation. It even goes as far as creating its own ORM and automatic migration system, because we think the existing ORMs are not as easy to use as we would like.</p><p>Don’t get me wrong, we’re not reinventing everything here. Cot is built on the shoulders of giants – it boasts axum, sea-query, tower, serde, and many other great projects under the hood. We’ve spent a lot of time though making sure it all works well together and provides plenty of features in between those projects to get you started quickly.</p><p>Cot is still in its early stages. The first release is a milestone, marking the point where it should start to be usable by other people, but it still isn’t mature enough to go anywhere near production. That said, the very text you are reading right now is being served by a blog engine written in Cot, so it’s already in a quite usable state.</p><ul><li>The ORM is very lacking at the moment and the automatic migration generator only works with a small subset of possible operations,</li><li>Request Handler API is far from being ergonomic and there’s no automatic OpenAPI docs generation,</li><li>The admin panel lacks pagination, filtering, or search, and missing support for many data types,</li><li>There is no support for static file processors (such as SCSS compilers) and the static files framework doesn’t yet handle content hashing,</li><li>There is no background tasks or scheduling, no web socket, or permission system,</li></ul><p>We’re hoping to fix most of the above in the v0.2 release. When? We’ll see, but we’re hoping in a month or two. We’re aiming for frequent releases that will allow people to provide feedback more often, hopefully limiting the API breakages in the long run.</p><p>As my personal blog, this will be your go-to source for Cot’s development news. I’ll be sharing regular updates, so bookmark this page to stay in the loop!</p><p>With this release, Cot is ready for community involvement! While we’ve laid the foundation, there’s an exciting road ahead, and we’d love your help in shaping the framework’s future.
