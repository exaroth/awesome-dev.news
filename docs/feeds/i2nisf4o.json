Majority of the ones I saw were Ubuntu (like what I had pictured) on there, but I also saw a good amount of ones with Kali and different versions of Linux Mint as well. </p><p>Seems like you get the USB according to said listings with instructions on how to properly boot it or install it on your computer, and in some cases even provide contact information for support if needed.

I know I'm young and still don't know much, but I'd like to write about this anyway. I think I started using computers during the Windows XP era. My father worked repairing computers. My mom says I learned to type on a computer before writing on paper. I was like one of today's kids who spend all day on their phones, except with computers. During my childhood, I spent my time chronically online, playing various games and browsing the internet. I remember Windows XP very well, along with Windows 7 and Minecraft. Those were good times, but as I grew older, things changed very quickly. My father stopped working with computer repairs, and soon I knew more than everyone else in the family.</p><p>I could fix all kinds of computers easily for my friends; back then, everything was Windows. My first contact with Linux was at school when we started having computer classes, when I was around 15. The school computers were slow and had Ubuntu installed. It was slow, ugly, and very limited because the computers were managed by the school. That was my first impression: a slow system for government computers.</p><p>Microsoft tried various things. I remember Windows 8 when formatting laptops, and then that Windows 8.1 update where they changed the menu. A lot happened, and it seems to have passed so quickly. At school, I always used Office suite programs: Word, PowerPoint, etc., and in computer classes, you had to use LibreOffice on a very slow government computer. it was ugly and seemed very difficult to use.</p><p>My family's financial situation didn't improve much, so I ended up with limited access to new technologies. My phone was already old, and my computers were getting old. I still remember Windows 10's launch very well. My relatives would bring computers for me to repair and format, wanting the latest version of Windows with Office and everything else, but the computers were already old and barely worked with Windows 8.</p><p>I begged my father to buy me a laptop, and after much insistence, I finally convinced him. It was an Asus X450LA. A mid-range computer for its time. It came with Windows 8, I think, but I did that upgrade to Windows 10. I used it until I finished high school, but then Windows 11 came along, and my laptop was cut from the list of computers that could upgrade. it was the end of my laptop's life.</p><p>I was already working at my father's market, so I bought myself a new gaming computer with Windows 11. I had time again to spend on the internet and started to worry about my father's business expenses. Using Office costs money, sales programs are expensive, everything is expensive, and maybe my gaming laptop won't even be able to use the next Windows.</p><p>I started researching Linux. At first, I was a bit scared because everyone on Reddit talked about terminals, command lines to install anything, etc., but I decided to take my old laptop and refurbish it. I bought a new battery, an SSD, and an 8GB RAM stick. I researched on Reddit which distro was best for beginners, got an old USB drive, put Mint on it, and formatted my computer: Love at first sight.</p><p>I customized Mint and left it in a way that I spend more than 15 minutes before doing anything just appreciating it. I used LibreOffice for everything I did in Office. I used Firefox and liked it a lot. The system is very fast, strangely seems faster than my new computer with Windows 11. I downloaded my daily-use programs from Mint's app center: Spotify, Bitwarden, everything's there. I spent hours playing with the terminal with ChatGPT's help. I extracted running process logs to txt, system information. it's very easy to use. I even managed to install a game I played in my childhood, a BF2 mod: Forgotten Hope 2 from Windows on Mint using Lutris (I swear it's the last Windows thing I'll use).</p><p>I'm in love with my old laptop again. I cleaned it, spent hours looking at it, I love using Mint, made it my own. I'm going to buy a new computer for my room and install Mint for my personal use. I'll have a laptop and a computer with Linux. My current computer with Windows 11 will be only for sales programs and government programs that only work on Windows. I showed it to my father, and he liked Linux too.<p> Windows never again. Using Windows now feels like one of those mobile games full of ads</p></p>","contentLength":4349,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Advanced SQL Tricks (CTEs, Conditional Aggregations, etc)","url":"https://youtu.be/rDGCOE5YGT0","date":1740269892,"author":"/u/Special_Community179","guid":9543,"unread":true,"content":"<!DOCTYPE html>","contentLength":0,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/1ivx75e/advanced_sql_tricks_ctes_conditional_aggregations/"},{"title":"Found this on a piece of digital signage in a bathroom","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/1ivwydq/found_this_on_a_piece_of_digital_signage_in_a/","date":1740269184,"author":"/u/A_Sc00py_b0i","guid":9393,"unread":true,"content":"","contentLength":0,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Introducing wctx - A simple CLI tool for window context info on Wayland & X11","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/1ivw7xn/introducing_wctx_a_simple_cli_tool_for_window/","date":1740267048,"author":"/u/slightlyfaulty","guid":9561,"unread":true,"content":"<p>Hey everyone, I just released my first package for Linux.

Once a step is completed, it triggers the next step in the sequence. If any step fails, the saga executes compensating updates to undo the changes made by the previous steps, ensuring that the system returns to its initial state.</p><p>There are two main approaches to implementing the Saga Pattern: Orchestration and Choreography.</p><p>In this approach, a central orchestrator service coordinates the saga steps. The orchestrator tells each service when to execute its local transaction. It maintains the state of the saga and handles any failures by invoking compensating transactions. The orchestrator knows the entire saga flow.</p><p>The client initiates the saga by communicating with the orchestrator. The orchestrator then invokes the first service. Upon successful completion, the orchestrator moves to the next step, invoking the corresponding service. If a service fails, the orchestrator triggers compensating transactions in reverse order.</p><p>In the Choreography approach, there is no central coordinator. Instead, each service involved in the saga knows its role and communicates with the other services through events or messages. Each service listens for specific events and performs local transactions when the appropriate event is received. The saga flow is distributed across the services.</p><p>The client initiates the saga by communicating with the first service. This service performs its transaction and publishes an event. Other services, listening for this event, perform their respective transactions and publish their events. This chain reaction continues until the saga is complete. If a service fails, it publishes a compensating event, triggering other services to execute compensating transactions.</p><ul><li><p>Choreography has no single point of failure, as each service manages its part of the saga.</p></li><li><p>Orchestration provides simplified error handling and monitoring with centralized control. In contrast, each service needs to handle its errors in Choreography, which can lead to complex error-handling logic.</p></li><li><p>In Orchestration, the coordinator needs to know about all the services involved in the saga, which can lead to tight coupling. In contrast, in Choreography, services need to agree on the events and the order of transactions, which can lead to overhead in coordination.</p></li></ul><ul></ul><ul></ul><p><em>If you enjoyed this article, please hit the ❤️ like button.</em></p><p><em>If you think someone else will benefit from this, then please 🔁 share this post.</em></p>","contentLength":2718,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/1ivk7x9/what_is_saga_pattern_in_distributed_systems/"},{"title":"[R] Calculating costs of fine tuning an Vision Language Model","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1ivjrwi/r_calculating_costs_of_fine_tuning_an_vision/","date":1740234081,"author":"/u/thekarthikprasad","guid":9235,"unread":true,"content":"<p>Hello guys, I need help in calculating the cost of fine-tuning a VL model.<p> My image dataset is of size 80+gb (</p><a href=\"https://huggingface.co/datasets/RussRobin/SpatialQA\">https://huggingface.co/datasets/RussRobin/SpatialQA</a>) The VL model is InternVL's 2B model<p> I am confused about whether to do a full parameter/QLoRA Finetuning.</p> I can't spend more on this, but wish to check the results.</p><p>If so I could, what would be the cost estimate, also how to estimate cost in general Can I sample the dataset, if it breaks my cost bound and still see the results?<p> Also do suggest the best and cheapest compute platform for my case.</p> Thanks in advance.</p>","contentLength":577,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Rustaceans, What are your thoughts on Gleam?","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1ivjcus/rustaceans_what_are_your_thoughts_on_gleam/","date":1740232848,"author":"/u/nikitarevenco","guid":9183,"unread":true,"content":"<p>I've been writing Rust for a couple months.

This shutdown barrier makes it such that runtime tasks never outlive TLS data owned by worker threads; this makes every invariant lifetime guaranteed to be valid until no tasks remain. Blocking threads managed by the Tokio runtime cannot outlive worker threads with this configuration, and so pointers to TLS from worker threads can be safely moved to these blocking threads with the lifetime constrained. As the lifetimes cannot be coerced into `&amp;'static`, moving onto other threads is prevented. This crate downgrades to using `Arc` whenever the `barrier-protected-runtime` feature is not enabled, making it the end users choice to opt into this optimization by using async_local to configure the runtime shutdown barrier. </p>","contentLength":1145,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Ring is unmaintained","url":"https://rustsec.org/advisories/RUSTSEC-2025-0007.html","date":1740185098,"author":"/u/technobicheiro","guid":8934,"unread":true,"content":"<p>This advisory has been withdrawn and should be ignored.

However half of the budget being covered means half of it isn’t. Or in other words: the Foundation is not yet sustainable, despite running on the strictest possible budget, and is burning through its (relatively small) reserves. And we are at the point where the end of the road is in sight.</p><blockquote><p>The Matrix.org Foundation exists to act as a neutral  and to nurture it as efficiently as possible as <strong>a single unfragmented standard, for the greater benefit of the whole ecosystem</strong>, not benefiting or privileging any single player or subset of players.</p></blockquote><p>Without the Foundation and its programs, the Matrix protocol itself faces existential threats:</p><ul><li>Without Trust &amp; Safety efforts, bad actors and communities would proliferate on the network and make it unlivable for the rest.</li><li>Without a canonical specification, the shared infrastructure and a Spec Core Team to maintain it, the protocol would become fragmented, losing its effective interoperability – increasing the costs on all downstream users.</li><li>Without a neutral entity as the custodian of the specification, the ecosystem would first shatter and then consolidate around the biggest (likely for-profit) actor.</li><li>Without advocacy, conferences, documentation and tutorials, Matrix would become a niche protocol used by a few enthusiasts for side projects, whilst big proprietary and siloed networks continue to hold the world’s communications.</li></ul><p>But there is light at the end of the tunnel! Concretely, the Foundation delivers most of its value by fostering a healthy, fair and fertile ecosystem around Matrix. It needs to strike the right balance between:</p><ul><li><strong>Making Matrix accessible &amp; visible.</strong><ul><li>For the general public it means maintaining an easy default onboarding server (Matrix.org).</li><li>For server administrators it means providing the right tooling to keep their users (and themselves!) safe.</li><li>For developers it means making it easy to develop products using Matrix, via documentation, tutorials, and in-person events.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Making Matrix compelling to build on.</strong><ul><li>This means maintaining the Matrix Specification as a canonical, unencumbered, patent free and royalty free specification.</li><li>Being responsive and vendor-neutral when an organisation or individual contributes.</li><li>Promoting the good players within the ecosystem.</li><li>Ensuring the network grows and attracts more users.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Making Matrix a product that benefits the greater good.</strong><ul><li>This means ensuring that the general public can easily build safe &amp; easy to use communities on Matrix.</li><li>Ensuring that bad actors are proactively chased and discouraged to use Matrix.</li></ul></li></ul><p>Matrix has been here for 10 years, and will hopefully be here for many more! But to continue to grow and thrive, it needs the Foundation to be around and healthy, which means carefully allocating its budget in order to continue to exist and fulfill its mission. This is why it needs to focus on critical programs and shut down some of its activities.</p><p>We view the following programs as critical to the Foundation’s mission:</p><ul><li>Maintaining the canonical, backwards compatible, stable <a href=\"https://spec.matrix.org/latest/\">Matrix Spec</a></li><li>Developing protocol enhancements and Trust and Safety tooling, making the tools available to the ecosystem and moderating the servers under its control (typically Matrix.org) - <a href=\"https://matrix.org/blog/2025/02/building-a-safer-matrix/\">see our recent blog post</a></li><li>Running the Matrix.org homeserver as an initial home for newcomers</li><li>Promoting the Matrix protocol via online content, conferences and meet-ups and other marketing strategies</li></ul><p>We might fine tune our approach, but we can't cease any of those programs without severe consequences for the ecosystem.</p><p>Meanwhile, bridges have been at the heart of Matrix for a long time. Public bridges hosted by the Matrix.org Foundation have been a very good resource to show the power of interoperability, connect communities together, and onboard many people into their Matrix journey.</p><p>However, these bridges require regular maintenance as the bridged platforms evolve their APIs, and significant engineering and moderation support to run. Luckily, the Matrix ecosystem is now more mature than it was at the time we spun up those public Slack, XMPP and IRC bridge instances. There are now commercial players like <a href=\"https://www.beeper.com/\">Beeper</a> providing a user-friendly offering for people who want to get all their conversations in a single app, or <a href=\"https://indiehosters.net/\">IndieHosters</a> and <a href=\"https://www.fairkom.eu/\">Fairkom</a> offering hosting for Matrix server and bridge instances (and much more).</p><p>So unless the Foundation manages to raise $100,000 of funding by the end of March 2025, we will have to focus our resources on the critical lines of work, and consequently <strong>we will have to shut down all the remaining bridges hosted by the Matrix.org Foundation. This includes bridges to Slack, XMPP, OFTC (IRC), and Snoonet (IRC).</strong> We will also mark the software behind those bridges as archived, as we don't have the resources to accept new contributions.</p><p>In practice, the Foundation needs an additional $610K in revenue to break-even, but this $100K would extend our runway 1 month while we work on landing grants and new members. To put this in context, we nearly doubled our revenue in 2024, reaching $561K, but it was also the first year in which we carried the full cost of our operations: $1.2M. To make ends meet, we liquidated $283K worth of cryptocurrency donations and ended the year with a $356K deficit. We are currently on target for $587K revenue in 2025, with a modest increase in expenses.</p><h2><a href=\"https://matrix.org/blog/2025/02/crossroads/#growing-the-ecosystem-and-the-network\" aria-label=\"Anchor link for: growing-the-ecosystem-and-the-network\">🔗</a>Growing the ecosystem and the network</h2><p>Choosing to shut the bridges down is a difficult decision to make, but will allow us to focus on the critical projects which will keep the ecosystem growing. The success of Matrix depends on how widely it is used by the general public and by organisations – preferably natively rather than via bridges.</p><p>The more people and organisations rely on Matrix, the more attractive it becomes for organisations to build products and services on top of it, the more funding the Foundation gets, and the more the Foundation can in turn reinvest into the ecosystem and run initiatives that benefit all stakeholders for the growth of the network.</p><p>Once the Foundation is cashflow positive, it will be able to accelerate and eventually get on with the multiple projects the team and Governing Board have in mind to make Matrix fun, exciting, reliable, safe, easy to use, and above all useful. And we hope to get there by the end of the year.</p><p>Most importantly, despite the Trust and Safety team being the Foundation’s biggest expense, as explained in <a href=\"https://matrix.org/blog/2025/02/building-a-safer-matrix/\">our blog post</a>, the team is still underresourced: they are understaffed and under a lot of pressure to deliver protocol improvements, better tooling for server admins, and ensure Matrix.org is a good citizen of the open federation. <strong>T&amp;S will be the first area to see increased funding.</strong></p><p>Separately, the Foundation wants to continue executing on its mission! Among others, better connect the doers in the ecosystem with the people and organisations who need their energy, share the successes and learnings from the community: the Matrix Conference was an incredible success and we want to see more of that.</p><p>We’ve also seen a clear change in how many users and organisations were adopting Matrix in the last few months: the world needs a decentralised end-to-end encrypted network to communicate more than ever, and it shows! We want to uplift the good players which are driving this growth.</p><p>There is so much more that we could do to make Matrix better and realise its full potential. </p><p>Right now, the Foundation urgently needs <a href=\"https://matrix.org/support/\">your financial help</a>. For the sake of a safe network, our primary focus today, but also to be able to deliver on the reason we all want Matrix to succeed.</p><ul><li>People should have full control over their own communication.</li><li>People should not be locked into centralised communication silos, but instead be free to pick who hosts their communication without limiting who they can reach.</li><li>The ability to converse securely and privately is a basic human right.</li><li>Communication should be available to everyone as a free and open, unencumbered, standard and global network.</li></ul><p><strong>If you are an organisation building on top of Matrix</strong>, you can help by , which also gives you the opportunity to be eligible to participate in the Governing Board, and other perks. </p><p><strong>If you are an organisation buying Matrix services or products</strong>, you can help by <strong>ensuring that your vendor is financially contributing back to the project</strong> or becoming a member yourself.</p><p><strong>If you are an individual using Matrix,</strong> you can help by .</p><p><strong>If you are a philanthropist or other funder</strong>, you can help by getting in touch with us at <a href=\"https://matrix.org/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#5a3c2f343e33343d1a373b2e2833227435283d\"></a> to discuss funding options. </p><p>It isn’t the <a href=\"https://matrix.org/blog/2022/12/01/funding-matrix-via-the-matrix-org-foundation/\">first</a><a href=\"https://matrix.org/blog/2024/04/open-source-publicly-funded-service/\">time</a> we’ve rung the alarm bell, and it is no fun to beg for help.

And, as with <a href=\"https://web.dev/blog/interop-2024-wrapup\">last\nyear</a>, the project will make a whole set of things\nBaseline Newly available. This post shares more information about some of the\nfeatures on the list, with links to information to find out more.</p><p>Several of the features included in Interop 2025 are features that you flagged\nup as important in the State of CSS 2024 survey. They'll help you create more\nbeautiful and performant user experiences.</p><p>This feature lets you anchor a positioned element to an anchor, it's\nparticularly useful when displaying popovers.</p><h3 data-text=\"Same-document view transitions\" tabindex=\"-1\">Same-document view transitions</h3><p>Also included this year are view transitions, specifically same-document view\ntransitions, and the  CSS property.</p><h3 data-text=\"The backdrop-filter property\" tabindex=\"-1\">The  property</h3><p>The\n<a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/CSS/backdrop-filter\"></a>\nproperty has been Baseline Newly available since September 2024. It lets you\ncreate effects behind your content. For example to blur or create effects that\nyou might expect to only be available in a graphics application.</p><p>Despite being mostly interoperable, you can see from <a href=\"https://wpt.fyi/results/css/filter-effects?label=experimental&amp;label=master&amp;aligned&amp;q=backdrop-filter\">the failing tests for\n</a>that\nthere are bugs and issues in those implementations. While these issues might not\nbe a problem to everyone, we know that many of you do run into them, it'll be\ngreat to get this feature working really well.</p><p>The  element is a disclosure widget which can be expanded to reveal\nadditional content. The  element itself is Baseline Widely available.\nHowever, there are a number of related features that have been more recently\nadded <a href=\"https://developer.chrome.com/blog/styling-details\">that make  more\nuseful</a>.</p><ul><li>The  and  CSS pseudo-elements.</li><li>Using  to toggle the content instead of .</li><li>Auto-expanding the  element with find-in-page matches.</li><li>The  attribute, which hides an element until it is found\nusing the browser's find-in-page search or it is directly navigated to by\nfollowing a URL fragment.</li></ul><p>The  at-rule lets you scope your selectors to a sub-tree of the DOM, or\neven select between an upper and lower boundary in the tree. For example, the\nfollowing CSS only selects  elements inside an element with a class of\n.</p><p>In the next example, an upper and lower bound is used. The  element is\nonly selected if it's between the element with a class of  and also\noutside of the element with a class of .</p><p>Without the  event, there's no reliable way to detect that a scroll is\ncomplete. The best you could do is to use  to check if the scroll\nhas stopped for a period. This makes it more like a scroll has paused event, not\na scroll has ended event.</p><p>With the  event, the browser does all this difficult evaluation for\nyou.</p><h3 data-text=\"The text-decoration property\" tabindex=\"-1\">The  property</h3><p>The\n<a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/CSS/text-decoration\"></a>\nproperty is a shorthand for , ,\n, and <code translate=\"no\" dir=\"ltr\">text-decoration-thickness</code>. It's deemed Baseline\nWidely available, however in Safari the only unprefixed shorthand property that\nworks is . It's this that will be addressed during 2025.</p><p>The CSS <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/CSS/writing-mode\"></a>\nproperty has a number of possible values, many of which are designed to lay out\nscripts that display vertically. Sometimes however, you want to lay out text\nvertically as part of a design, rather than for language support reasons. The\n and  values are designed for this, but have suffered\nfrom poor browser compatibility. This should be fixed during 2025.</p><p>In addition, the logical CSS properties  and \nare included.

Right-clicking an empty desktop and selecting “Desktop view options” opens a settings window for your desktop. Show or hide desktop folders, drives, or the Trash; you can also adjust icon size and spacing between icons from this window. A fix for the window appearing below other windows will arrive in a later update.

Dragging a window <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" href=\"https://github.com/pop-os/cosmic-workspaces-epoch/issues/41\">out of a stack</a> will match expectations and no longer move the whole stack. Window titles in the overview are now at the top left of the window and <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" href=\"https://github.com/pop-os/cosmic-workspaces-epoch/issues/56\">match the users theme</a>.

In addition, the Launcher has been updated to trigger a <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" href=\"https://github.com/pop-os/cosmic-launcher/issues/126\">countdown timer</a> whenever Power Off, Restart, and Log Out are selected, matching the behavior of the Power applet.</p></div><div data-v-7773bbb7=\"\"><p>File path completion is now in COSMIC Files.

Meanwhile, <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" href=\"https://github.com/pop-os/cosmic-files/issues/728\">copying a file</a> allows pasting of the file path in other applications. COSMIC Files uses <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" href=\"https://github.com/pop-os/cosmic-files/issues/732\">Home and End keys</a> for navigating the app. You can now compress and extract <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" href=\"https://github.com/pop-os/cosmic-files/issues/468\">password protected zip files</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" href=\"https://github.com/pop-os/cosmic-files/issues/190\">drag selecting</a> will scroll the content window.</p><p>Copy/paste using the middle mouse button has been implemented. Sweet convenience.</p><p>A <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" href=\"https://github.com/pop-os/cosmic-player/issues/52\">nav bar</a> has been added for viewing folders in a tree view to display the video files available to open in the Media Player.

Down the line we’d like to explore adding further metadata, such as album artwork and song lyrics.&nbsp;</p><p>Mpris control has been added to show and control currently-playing media in the sound applet, and the scrubber now moves to a second line for improved single-column usability.</p><p>A <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" href=\"https://github.com/pop-os/cosmic-edit/issues/128\">Revert all changes</a> feature has been added to COSMIC Edit to revert your file back to the most recent saved state. If you decide to scrap everything or start a new file from scratch, go to <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" href=\"https://github.com/pop-os/cosmic-edit/issues/41\">File &gt; Close Project</a> to remove the project from the NavBar and bring up a new document and tab. When multiple tabs are open, <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" href=\"https://github.com/pop-os/cosmic-edit/issues/123\">cycle project tabs</a> using Ctrl+Tab and Ctrl+Shift+Tab shortcuts.</p><p><a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" href=\"https://github.com/pop-os/cosmic-edit/pull/311\">Zoom</a> has also been implemented. Zoom in and out from the View menu, or using Ctrl + or Ctrl - shortcuts. Reset back to default using Ctrl + 0.</p><p>Opens Sans replaces Fira Sans as the <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" href=\"https://github.com/pop-os/libcosmic/pull/809\">default font</a> for COSMIC. The team liked Open Sans for its better legibility, glyph and language support, and a more modern aesthetic. Likewise, Noto Sans Mono will be used for the default monospace font.</p><p>Memory usage has been greatly reduced in a number of areas, including <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" href=\"https://github.com/pop-os/cosmic-applets/pull/796\">minimize</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" href=\"https://github.com/pop-os/cosmic-files/pull/789\">COSMIC Files</a>, and <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" href=\"https://github.com/pop-os/cosmic-panel/issues/336\">workspaces</a>. A related update made to libcosmic should prevent memory fragmentation. In addition, optimizations to cosmic-text and <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" href=\"https://github.com/pop-os/freedesktop-icons/pull/4\">freedesktop-icons</a> have reduced memory usage across all COSMIC apps and applets.</p><p><strong>A Whole Swarm of Bug Fixes…and More!</strong></p><ul><li>Fixed a bug with server-side decorations that caused the cursor to <a target=\"_blank\"

MLGym-bench consists of 13 diverse and open-ended AI research tasks from diverse domains such as computer vision, natural language processing, reinforcement learning, and game theory. Solving these tasks requires real-world AI research skills such as generating new ideas and hypotheses, creating and processing data, implementing ML methods, training models, running experiments, analyzing the results, and iterating through this process to improve on a given task. We evaluate a number of frontier large language models (LLMs) on our benchmarks such as Claude-3.5-Sonnet, Llama-3.1 405B, GPT-4o, o1-preview, and Gemini-1.5 Pro. Our MLGym framework makes it easy to add new tasks, integrate and evaluate models or agents, generate synthetic data at scale, as well as develop new learning algorithms for training agents on AI research tasks. We find that current frontier models can improve on the given baselines, usually by finding better hyperparameters, but do not generate novel hypotheses, algorithms, architectures, or substantial improvements.

In\ncase you're short on time - here's a quick overview:</p><p>The problem details response is sent back as a JSON body with the following\nproperties:</p><ul><li>: A URI that identifies the specific error type. This\nhelps clients understand the error and potentially find more information or\ndocumentation about it. Ideally, this URI should be stable and not change over\ntime.</li><li>: A short, human-readable summary of the problem. This\nshould be a brief description that concisely conveys the error. The title\nshould not change for a given \"type\" URI.</li><li><strong>status (integer, optional)</strong>: The HTTP status code generated by the origin\nserver for this occurrence of the problem. This helps clients understand the\nnature of the error and how it relates to the HTTP protocol.</li><li><strong>detail (string, optional)</strong>: A more detailed, human-readable explanation of\nthe problem. This can include specific information about the error and what\nmight have caused it. The \"detail\" field is intended to provide context and\nsuggestions to clients on how they might address the problem.</li><li><strong>instance (string, URI, optional)</strong>: A URI that identifies the specific\noccurrence of the problem.

Here's how you can manage this:</p><ul><li>Add optional fields instead of altering existing ones</li><li>Preserve legacy formats during transitions</li><li>Implement semantic versioning for your endpoints</li></ul><p>API management tools like Zuplo are really handy when trying to bring\nconsistency across your error formats, and are especially useful when trying to\ntransition all of your APIs over from one format to another.</p><p>Creating effective API error messages means providing useful guidance while\nkeeping security in mind. Google's AIP-193 guidelines\n<a href=\"https://google.aip.dev/193\">[4]</a> recommend using a structured format with\nplain, straightforward language that remains technically accurate.</p><p>The goal is to make error messages both clear and actionable. Here's a\ncomparison of good and bad examples:</p><table><thead><tr></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>\"Invalid email format in 'user_email' field\"</td><td>\"ValidationError: field_23\"</td></tr><tr><td>\"Request to /api/v1/users failed\"</td></tr></tbody></table><p>If you've ever used Azure, many of their system errors demonstrate this\napproach, for example:</p><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code></code></pre><p>Maintaining security while providing useful error feedback involves a few key\npractices:</p><ul><li> to prevent leaks.</li><li><strong>Standardize authentication errors</strong> for consistency.</li><li> to avoid exposing vulnerabilities.</li></ul><p>For example, following RFC 9457 guidelines, a secure error response might look\nlike this:</p><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code></code></pre><p>This is another area where using an API gateway/API management tool is useful.\nYou can monitor your outbound responses and scan them for PII or other sensitive\ninformation/keywords using a regex.

A\ncommon standard for this is , which ensures a\nconsistent format across endpoints. This method also supports content\nnegotiation between JSON and XML, keeping the structure consistent across\ndifferent formats.</p><p>GraphQL handles errors differently. It always responds with a  status\ncode, even when errors occur. Errors are communicated through an  array,\nwhich allows for partial success. For instance, GitHub's GraphQL API might\nreturn:</p><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code></code></pre><p>This approach allows for returning valid data alongside error details.</p><p>gRPC uses a predefined set of numeric status codes (ranging from 0 to 16) for\nerror handling, aligned with . Errors include structured details\nfor better context. Here's an example:</p><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code></code></pre><table><thead><tr></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Standard HTTP success codes</td></tr><tr></tr><tr></tr></tbody></table><p>Each protocol has its own approach, but they all follow two key principles:\n<strong>machine-readable error codes</strong> and . This ensures\nerrors are both understandable and actionable.</p><p>For cross-protocol APIs, API gateways can simplify error handling. They provide\nunified error schema management and automate transformations between\nprotocol-specific formats. This helps maintain consistency while respecting the\nconventions of each API type.</p><p>Effective error management relies on consistent monitoring and testing to uphold\nusability standards outlined in earlier protocols. This process builds on\nprotocol-specific error conventions to ensure smooth handling across systems.</p><p>A centralized error code system can ensure uniformity across distributed\nservices. For example, Google uses the  format, which\nenforces standardized error structures with both machine-readable codes and\nhuman-readable messages <a href=\"https://google.aip.dev/193\">[4]</a>.</p><p>In multi-service architectures, two main approaches are common:</p><table><thead><tr></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Ensures uniform error codes, Acts as a single source of truth</td><td>Requires strict oversight</td></tr><tr><td>Distributed with Prefixes</td><td>Allows team independence, Enables quicker updates</td><td>Demands thorough documentation</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Many organizations find that combining these methods provides the best results.</p><p>Key metrics to monitor include\n<a href=\"https://raygun.com/blog/best-error-monitoring-tools/\">[2]</a><a href=\"https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/discussions/appsonazure/best-practices-for-api-error-handling-a-comprehensive-guide/4088121\">[3]</a>:</p><ul><li><strong>Mean Time to Acknowledge (MTTA)</strong> errors: Target under 30 minutes.</li><li>: Should remain below 5% after fixes.</li><li><strong>95th percentile error resolution time</strong>: A critical benchmark for resolution\nspeed.</li><li><strong>User-impacting error ratio</strong>: Measured per 10,000 requests.</li></ul><p>Tools like <a href=\"https://sentry.io/\">Sentry</a> support distributed tracing in over 15\nlanguages, while <a href=\"https://raygun.com/\">Raygun</a> offers deployment correlation to\npinpoint issues <a href=\"https://raygun.com/blog/best-error-monitoring-tools/\">[2]</a>.</p><p>Testing ensures compliance with HTTP status codes and response formats covered\nin earlier sections.

So if you’ve progressed in your career far enough that you don’t think a foundational certification is valuable, and you don’t want to work your way through 3 tiers you already fully understand, IASA may be the answer for you.</p><p>: Senior architects and business analysts aiming to bridge the gap between business and technology.</p><p>Four levels of certification:</p><ul><li>Professional (recommended for enterprise-level architects) - achieved by presenting to a board of CITA-D certified architects and answering any questions. 2 hrs allotted for the exam.</li><li>Distinguished - achieved by presenting to a board of CITA-D certified architects and answering any questions. 2.5 hrs allotted for the exam.</li></ul><p>Testing: Online or onsite testing is available</p><table><thead><tr><th> (for professional tier)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td> Exam: $425 USD  N/A  Exam + prep: $2,000 USD  Exam + prep: $2,800 USD</td><td>A minimum of 10 years in the industry as a practicing architect.

It covers the design and optimization of AWS cloud-based software and shows you can handle complex multi-service architectures, which is crucial as more companies move to the cloud. The exam tests real-world scenarios you would face designing large-scale systems, including hybrid architectures, multi-region deployments, and cost optimization at scale. Basic familiarity with programming concepts will help, but you don’t need hands-on experience with code.</p><p>This is the only provider-specific certificate that offers a more in-depth, self-directed training option for a price. Of course, you don’t have to take that option. If you’re confident, you can take the free training and then challenge the test. However, the test is also the cheapest among these certifications, so it offsets the overall cost a little bit.</p><p>During my research, I found quite a few posters, including <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/AWSCertifications/comments/1h5jfmp/how_did_passing_aws_solution_architect/\">this one</a>, that had seen significant benefits from taking the course.</p><p>: Systems Administrators (Cloud Focused), Cloud Architects, Solutions Architects, Cloud Consultants Software Architects for Cloud-Based Applications, and Enterprise Architects.</p><ul><li>3 courses of online, self-directed exam prep are available</li><li>15.25 hrs free; 48.75 hrs paid</li></ul><p>Testing: 130 minutes.

It will help you show your cloud architecture skills and advance your career in Google’s cloud technology. Keep in mind, this is focused on Google’s cloud infrastructure and doesn’t cover software architecture.</p><p>The training and exam for this certificate are all online (though on-site exams are available) which makes it very flexible. Plus, it’s pretty cheap (although it’s the most expensive of the provider-specific options). However, if you go through all the training, it’s going to take you some time, as it’s the longest provider-specific course here.</p><p>: Cloud Architects, Solutions Architects, IT Project Managers focused on the cloud, Cloud Engineers, DevOps Engineers, and Enterprise Architects.</p><p>Training: 114.75 hrs, online, self-directed</p><p>Testing: 2-hr test, with two options: an online proctored exam, or an onsite-proctored exam at a testing center.</p><table><thead><tr></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>3+ years of industry experience, including 1+ year of designing and managing solutions with Google Cloud</td></tr></tbody></table><p><strong>Certification expiry &amp; recertification</strong>: The certificate is valid for 2 years.

It dives deep into how various IT infrastructure components in the Microsoft ecosystem (like compute, network, storage, monitoring, and security) interact to generate solutions. Just like the Google certificate above, this is infrastructure-focused, not software-focused, so keep that in mind when considering it.</p><p>The course for the Microsoft certification is shorter than Google’s by almost 100 hours and can be taken both online at your own pace, or with an online instructor. It’s also a bit cheaper than Google’s, making it an easier investment both for hours and dollars spent.</p><p>: Systems Administrators, Network Engineers, IT Managers, Cloud Architects, Computer Systems Analysts and Infrastructure Engineers.</p><p>Training: Self-paced online learning (15.25 hrs), or instructor-led online training (4 days).</p><p>Testing: Online proctored exam.</p><table><thead><tr></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>$165 USD  Self-paced training is free; instructor-led depends on the provider.</td><td>Experience with Azure administration and development, and DevOps processes.

One of the nice things is that RHCA offers tracks in both infrastructure and enterprise applications. So you can choose the option that best matches your goals.</p><p>Red Hat prices its certification differently than most. It’s a subscription-based model, which allows you to have a little more freedom with how you tackle their training. In fact, their certification offers the most custom options, with a variety of options to get from A (where you are) to B (certified). So if you have diverse interests, this one might be the one for you.</p><p>: Senior Systems Administrator, Cloud Architect, IT Infrastructure Architect, DevOps Engineer, Senior Application Developer, Enterprise Solutions Architect</p><ul><li>Red Hat Certified Architect in Infrastructure</li><li>Red Hat Certified Architect in Enterprise Applications</li></ul><p>Certification builds on prerequisites with five additional certifications chosen from a list.</p><p>Training and exams depend on your chosen path and certifications.</p><table><thead><tr></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td> Standard: $7,500 USD/year for 25 training units and certification. <p> Premium: $9,000 USD/year for 30 training units and certification.</p></td><td>Red Hat Certified Engineer (RHCE)  OR <p> Red Hat Certified Enterprise Microservices Developer (RHCEMD) </p> OR <p> Red Hat Certified Cloud-native Developer (RHCCD)</p></td><td>Recommended experience depends on your specific path.</td></tr></tbody></table><p><strong>Certification expiry &amp; recertification</strong>: Certifications become ‘non-current’ after three years. To maintain an RHCA certification, you must maintain five additional certifications over your RHCE. RHCEMD or RHCCD.

Its foundation and advanced certificates offer room for architects to grow.</p><p>This is a two-step program, foundation and advanced, which puts it between the single-step SOA certification and the larger three- or even four-step offerings. Just like TOGAF and ITIL, iSAQB is not a testing or training provider, so there are a lot of options for training. Or, if you’re confident, you can challenge the exam without, though that’s not recommended.</p><p>: Software designers, software developers, Software Architects, systems analysts</p><p>\nThough training and testing are performed by independent operators, you have four testing options available, including:</p><ul><li>Exam after classroom training</li></ul><table><thead><tr></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>The cost of training is dependent on training providers.

Depending on your career path, you may choose to get certified by one of the bodies above, or simply study on your own and prove what you can do through practical experience.</p><p>If you’ve decided to pursue the certification path, the options above are all great choices. Of course, each requires a commitment of time and money. While you can’t warp the space-time continuum to change the time requirement, it may be possible to get your employer to help you cover some, if not all of the cost.

Tried XFCE, MATE and Budgie, and they felt too outdated for my liking; Budgie felt off. I decided to give GNOME a shot and installed Ubuntu 22.04. For once I was starting to like GNOME. It felt more unified and simple than KDE, but just more modern than the other desktops. However, this was NOT stock GNOME. I installed vanilla GNOME on the same OS and decided to give it a shot.</p><p> Moving on from Ubuntu's Yaru theme to Adwaita felt like a MASSIVE downgrade. Except the looks, GNOME's true workflow actually started to make sense to me and it was more productive than any desktop I tried. Of course, I installed some extensions like Blur my Shell, but I can use GNOME without extensions nowadays. As I'm writing this, GNOME 48 would bring a new Adwaita font with Inter as it's base, which will improve the looks of GNOME by a bit, IMO. Currently using Zorin OS, which has a GNOME theme that is MILES better compared to Libadwaita / Adwaita. </p><p> What I understood is GNOME is not all about looks, it makes the UI simpler and easier to understand, with ONLY the things you need, and it stays out of your way and focuses on your work. It might be dumbing down the desktop for some, but that's exactly what GNOME's for. A solid philosophy IMO- but definitely lagging in some important areas. </p>","contentLength":2009,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"How donations helped the LibreOffice project and community in 2024","url":"https://blog.documentfoundation.org/blog/2025/02/21/how-your-donations-helped-the-libreoffice-project-in-2024/","date":1740130087,"author":"/u/themikeosguy","guid":8630,"unread":true,"content":"<p>Thank you for visiting our website and your interest in our services and products.

It is specifically a , in the same way that Debian is a Linux distribution. It provides an automated build system to produce coreboot ROM images with a variety of payloads such as GRUB or SeaBIOS, with regular well-tested releases to make coreboot as easy to use as possible for non-technical users. From a project management perspective, this works in  the same way as a Linux distro, providing a source-based package manager (called lbmk) which patches sources and compiles coreboot images. It makes use of <a href=\"https://www.coreboot.org/\">coreboot</a> for hardware initialisation, and then a payload such as <a href=\"https://www.seabios.org/SeaBIOS\">SeaBIOS</a> or <a href=\"https://www.gnu.org/software/grub/\">GRUB</a> to boot your operating system; on ARM(chromebooks), we provide  (as a coreboot payload).</p><p>We also provide an experimental U-Boot setup on x86, as a coreboot payload for providing a minimal UEFI implementation.</p><p>Normally, revisions would only be documented on the <a href=\"https://libreboot.org/news/libreboot20241206.Revisions.html\">Libreboot 20241206 revisions page</a>, but this revision contains , so it was decided that there should be a full announcement, to ensure that more people see it.</p><div><h2>Summarised list of changes</h2><a aria-hidden=\"true\" href=\"https://libreboot.org/news/libreboot20241206rev10.html#summarised-list-of-changes\">[link]</a></div><p>GRUB released  to its main branch, fixing a large number of security issues.

Extra builds would cost  per minute.</li><li>AWS account where we will auto-spawn EC2 instance. We will use  instance (2 vCPUs, 2GB RAM) which costs  per month in  region (cheapest region). Also it will take  per month for EBS gp2 storage (20GB) for EC2 instance</li></ul><p>This is it, registry will be auto-spawned on EC2 instance, so no extra costs for it. Also GitHub storage is not used, so no extra costs for it.</p><p>The setup has next features:</p><ul><li>Build process is done using IaaC approach with HashiCorp Terraform, so almoast no manual actions are needed from you. Every resource including EC2 server instance is described in code which is commited to repo so no manual clicks are needed.</li><li>Docker build process is done on GitHub actions, so EC2 server is not overloaded</li><li>Changes in infrastructure including changing server type, adding S3 Bucket, changing size of sever disk is also can be done by commiting code to repo.</li><li>Docker images and cache are stored on EC2 server, so no extra costs for Docker registry are needed.</li><li>Total build time for average commit to AdminForth app (with Vite rebuilds) is around 2 minutes.</li></ul><p>Previously we had a blog post about <a href=\"https://adminforth.dev/blog/compose-ec2-deployment-github-actions/\">deploying AdminForth to EC2 with Terraform without registry</a>. That method might work well but has a significant disadvantage - build process happens on EC2 itself and uses EC2 RAM and CPU. This can be a problem if your EC2 instance is well-loaded without extra free resources. Moreover, low-end EC2 instances have a small amount of RAM and CPU, so build process which involves vite/tsc/etc can be slow or even fail.</p><p>So obviously to solve this problem we need to move the build process to CI, however it introduces new chellenges and we will solve them in this post.</p><p>Quick difference between approaches from previous post and current post:</p><table><thead><tr></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>How and where docker build happens</td><td>Source code is rsync-ed from CI to EC2 and docker build is done there</td><td>Docker build is done on CI and docker image is pushed to registry (in this post we run registry automatically on EC2)</td></tr><tr><td>How Docker build layers are cached</td><td>GitHub actions has no own Docker cache out of the box, so it should be stored in dedicated place (we use self-hosted registry on the EC2 as it is free)</td></tr><tr><td>Simpler setup with less code (we don't need code to run and secure registry, and don't need extra cache setup as is naturally persisted on EC2).</td><td>Build is done on CI, so EC2 server is not overloaded. For most cases CI builds are faster than on EC2. Plus time is saved because we don't need to rsync source code to EC2</td></tr><tr><td>Build on EC2 requires additional server RAM / overloads CPU</td><td>More terraform code is needed. registry cache might require small extra space on EC2</td></tr></tbody></table><h2>Chellenges when you build on CI<a href=\"https://adminforth.dev/blog/compose-ec2-deployment-github-actions-registry/#chellenges-when-you-build-on-ci\" aria-label=\"Direct link to Chellenges when you build on CI\" title=\"Direct link to Chellenges when you build on CI\">​</a></h2><p>When you move build process to CI you have to solve next chellenges:</p><ol><li>We need to deliver built docker images to EC2 somehow (and only we)</li><li>We need to persist cache between builds</li></ol><h4>Exporing images to tar files<a href=\"https://adminforth.dev/blog/compose-ec2-deployment-github-actions-registry/#exporing-images-to-tar-files\" aria-label=\"Direct link to Exporing images to tar files\" title=\"Direct link to Exporing images to tar files\">​</a></h4><p>Simplest option which you can find is save docker images to tar files and deliver them to EC2. We can easily do it in terraform (using  command on CI and  command on EC2). However this option has a significant disadvantage - it is slow. Docker images are big (always include all layers, without any options), so it takes infinity to do save/load and another infinity to transfer them to EC2 (via relatively slow rsync/SSH and relatively slow GitHub actions outbound connection).</p><p>Faster, right option which we will use here - involve Docker registry. Registry is a repository which stores docker images. It does it in a smart way - it saves each image as several layers, so if you will update last layer, then only last layer will be pushed to registry and then only last will be pulled to EC2.\nTo give you row compare - whole-layers image might take , but last layer created by  command might take . And most builds you will do only last layer changes, so it will be 20 times faster to push/pull last layer than whole image.\nAnd this is not all, registry uses TLS HTTP protocol so it is faster then SSH/rsync encrypted connection.</p><p>Of course you have to care about a way of registry authentication (so only you and your CI/EC2 can push/pull images).</p><p>What docker registry can you use? Pretty known options:</p><ol><li>Docker Hub - most famous. It is free for public images, so literally every opensource project uses it. However it is not free for private images, and you have to pay for it. In this post we are considering you might do development for commercial project with tight budget, so we will not use it.</li><li>GHCR - Registry from Google. Has free plan but allows to store only 500MB and allows to transfer 1GB of traffic per month. Then you pay for every extra GB in storage and traffic. Probably small images will fit in this plan, but generally even alpine-based docker images are bigger than 500MB, so it is not a good option.</li><li>Self-hosted registry web system. In our software development company, we use Harbor. It is a powerful free open-source registry that can be installed to own server. It allows pushing and pulling without limit. Also, it has internal life-cycle rules that cleanup unnecessary images and layers. The main drawbacks of it are that it is not so fast to install and configure, plus you have to get a domain and another powerfull server to run it. So unless you are a software development company, it is not worth using it.</li><li>Self-hosted minimal CNCF Distribution <a href=\"https://distribution.github.io/distribution/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">registry</a> on EC2 itself. So since we already have EC2, we can run registry on it directly. The  container is pretty light-weight and easy to setup and it will not consume a lot of extra CPU/RAM on server. Plus images will be stored close to application so pull will be fast.</li></ol><p>In the post we will use last (4th way). Our terraform will deploy registry automatically, so you don't have to do anything special.</p><p>Docker builds without layer cache persistence are possible but very slow. Most builds only change a couple of layers, and having no ability to cache them will cause the Docker builder to regenerate all layers from scratch. This can, for example, increase the Docker build time from a minute to ten minutes or even more.</p><p>Out of the box, GitHub Actions can't save Docker layers between builds, so you have to use external storage.</p><blockquote><p>Though some CI systems can persist docker build cache, e.g. open-source self-hosted Woodpecker CI allows it out of the box. However GitHub actions which is pretty popular, reasonably can't allow such free storage to anyone</p></blockquote><p>So when build-in Docker cache can't be used, there is one alternative - Docker BuildKit external cache.\nSo BuildKit allows you to connect external storage. There are several options, but most sweet for us is using Docker registry as cache storage (not only as images storage to deliver them to application server).</p><blockquote><p><em>BuildKit cache in Compose issue</em>\nPreviously we used docker compose to build &amp; run our app, it can be used to both build, push and pull images, but has <a href=\"https://github.com/docker/compose/issues/11072#issuecomment-1848974315\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">issues with external cache connection</a>. While they are not solved we have to use  command to build images. It is not so bad, but is another point of configuration which we will cover in this post.</p></blockquote><h3>Registry authorization and traffic encryption<a href=\"https://adminforth.dev/blog/compose-ec2-deployment-github-actions-registry/#registry-authorization-and-traffic-encryption\" aria-label=\"Direct link to Registry authorization and traffic encryption\" title=\"Direct link to Registry authorization and traffic encryption\">​</a></h3><p>Hosting custom CNCF registry, from other hand is a security responsibility.</p><p>If you don't protect it right, someone will be able to push any image to your registry and then pull it to your EC2 instance. This is a big security issue, so we have to protect our registry.</p><p>First of all we need to set some authorization to our registry so everyone who will push/pull images will be authorized. Here we have 2 options: HTTP basic auth and Client certificate auth. We will use first one as it is easier to setup. We will generate basic login and password automatically in terraform so no extra actions are needed from you.</p><p>But this is not enough. Basic auth is not encrypted, so someone can perform MITM attack and get your credentials. So we need to encrypt traffic between CI and registry. We can do it by using TLS certificates. So we will generate self-signed TLS certificates, and attach them to our registry.</p><p>Assume you have your AdminForth project in .</p><p>Create file  in :</p><p>create folder  and create file  inside:</p><h2>Step 3 - create a SSH keypair<a href=\"https://adminforth.dev/blog/compose-ec2-deployment-github-actions-registry/#step-3---create-a-ssh-keypair\" aria-label=\"Direct link to Step 3 - create a SSH keypair\" title=\"Direct link to Step 3 - create a SSH keypair\">​</a></h2><p>Make sure you are still in  folder, run next command:</p><p>Now it should create  and  files with your SSH keypair.

I wanted to focus on two surveys that have appeared recently, which tell us a bit about languages that many of you probably used in a previous reincarnation cycle, but have already forgotten about.</p><p>Of course, the usual disclaimer at the beginning – we know that surveys tend to show what they feel is worth showing and have a certain narrative power.</p><p>Having that in mind, I think we can begin.</p><p>First, let’s look at the people who filled out the survey – demographics tell us a lot about the quality of the results and what we can expect. We have as many as 232 responses, with 75% Software Engineers and 49.6% people in tech-lead or related areas – apparently, many of us wear several hats at once (yes, I know that pain too). It turned out that most of them work on closed-source projects (87.5%), although there’s no shortage of hardcore open-source folks (18.1%). I think that fairly reflects the state of the industry.</p><p>An overwhelming majority of respondents like or love Scala: 49.1% love it, 44% rather like it. The remaining 6.9% are still undecided, and 0.9% (i.e., 2 people) have fallen into Scala-depression. However here we also hit, to some extent, the “peak” of people interested in the topic - those willing to fill out the Scala Survey.</p><p>The average age of projects is 7 years, with a median of 6 years – that’s quite… a lot. It also shows that quite a bit of Scala is legacy projects – at least in the surveyed group, “greenfields” are relatively rare.</p><p>Typelevel (41.8%), Akka (35.3%), ZIO (23.3%), and Play (15.5%). And of course, Spark (7.7%) – let’s not forget that big data elephant in the room, though the days when it was synonymous with Data seem to be behind us. These people have a new best friend.</p><p>Moreover, more than half of the projects (53%) combine different ecosystems such as Akka and Cats, indicating that we’re building increasingly hybrid beasts. 36.2% are “monogamists” relying entirely on a single library (ZIO, we’re looking at you), and 10.8% are the brave ones using only the standard library.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/article/edit/7298227473140305920/#\" rel=\"\">VirtusLab</a><a href=\"https://github.com/scalameta/metals\" rel=\"\">project here</a></p><p>SBT beats everyone hands down (87.5%). Scala-CLI (11.2%) is relatively new but has decent traction, and Bazel (7.8%) and Maven (7.3%) also have loyal fans. </p><p>22.4% of commercial projects have already switched to Scala 3, but as many as 37% do not plan to. Why? Because as usual, the ecosystem is (still) not fully ready, there’s a lack of resources, and management is pushing the topic aside. You know that feeling when a new version of a language tempts you, but there are dozens of “work in progress” branches piling up in the repo…?</p><p>Talking about the problems, the report shows three major ones:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Fragmentation of the ecosystem and migration issues to Scala 3</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Lack of resources to maintain older projects.</strong></p></li></ul><p><strong>recruiting Scala developers</strong></p><p>Given these recruitment problems, it’s not surprising that 68.6% allow remote work, which at least somewhat makes life easier for those who have managed to settle in the Bieszczady Mountains or in Bali.</p><ul></ul><p>Despite all these challenges, 88.4% of respondents would still choose Scala for new projects without hesitation. It shows that the JVM community sees great potential in Scala, but also knows that working on its further development and tooling is a marathon, not a sprint.</p><p><a href=\"https://bit.ly/scala-report\" rel=\"\">the report is full of interesting details</a></p><p>Now, let's take a look at the other report I have for you today.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/article/edit/7298227473140305920/#\" rel=\"\">Alex Miller</a><a href=\"https://clojure.org/news/2024/12/02/state-of-clojure-2024\" rel=\"\">State of Clojure</a></p><p>Let’s start with what warms the hearts of backend folks the most: does Clojure live in real projects and is it more than just a hobby experiment? Definitely yes! 73% of respondents use Clojure at work, mainly in web development, commercial services, and enterprise applications. Their services often end up in the cloud – public (58%) or private (26%). So you can say with confidence that the “Lispy DSL” is conquering more and more server rooms and Docker containers.</p><p>What about team size? Most are small teams (up to 10 people), though there are also true giants – Nubank, with over a thousand Clojure developers, is a prime example. It’s no coincidence they’re now responsible for the development of the language.</p><p>Regarding the adoption of new versions, things look surprisingly good. As many as 58% have already moved to Clojure 1.12, released in September 2024, which indicates that stability and a lack of painful breaking changes are quite a motivator.</p><p>Here we see that Java 21 LTS already has 54% of users, and Java 8 is losing ground in favor of newer versions (only 9% remain with the old-timer, which is better than in Java itself). Probably for this reason, Clojure plans to raise the base version in subsequent releases (much like Scala, but we’ll talk about that next week).</p><p><a href=\"https://babashka.org/\" rel=\"\">Babashka</a></p><p>An example is Babashka – a dialect that enjoys huge popularity (93% of respondents who use dialects had dealt with it) because it allows scripts to be run quickly, without the start-up delays of the JVM. ClojureDart, on the other hand, brings Clojure into the Dart ecosystem, opening new perspectives for web and mobile apps. Other projects like Squint, Jank, and Cherry demonstrate the community’s ongoing creativity – each introduces its own modifications, often experimental, allowing the Clojure philosophy to adapt to entirely new conditions.</p><p>Leiningen and deps.edn continues to vie for space among dependency management tools – we can see that deps.edn is gaining strength, and nRepl, REBL, and other plugins help make REPL feel like home.</p><p>A special section of the survey examines people who have just started their adventure with Clojure (less than a year of experience). The report has been tracking programmers’ migration paths to Clojure for years. It appears they still largely come from Java, JavaScript, and Python. Ruby and C++ are in decline, whereas C# is starting to gain slightly – perhaps thanks to the “functional awakening” in the .NET ecosystem.</p><p><strong>Biggest challenges for newcomers?</strong></p><p>If you’ve read this far, you’re probably as happy as I am to see that Clojure keeps evolving. On one hand – a stable, mature platform, and on the other – new dialects, a growing community not just in corporate settings but also in open-source projects and even in the gaming industry (yes, yes, I’ve seen it!). State of Clojure 2024 shows that Lisp on the JVM is still a very strong player: a steady, balanced development without revolutionary changes, yet… there’s always something new to discover.</p><p><a href=\"https://clojure.org/news/2024/12/02/state-of-clojure-2024\" rel=\"\">through the full report</a></p><p>Happy coding – and until next time in JVM Weekly!</p>","contentLength":6662,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/1iuag90/the_state_of_scala_clojure_surveys_how_is/"},{"title":"[R] Detecting LLM Hallucinations using Information Theory","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1iu9ryi/r_detecting_llm_hallucinations_using_information/","date":1740086564,"author":"/u/meltingwaxcandle","guid":7496,"unread":true,"content":"<p>LLM hallucinations and errors are a major challenge, but what if we could predict when they happen?

They divided the tasks into two categories: individual contributor tasks (resolving bugs or implementing features), and management tasks (where the model roleplays as a manager who will choose the best proposal to resolve issues).&nbsp;</p><p>“Results indicate that the real-world freelance work in our benchmark remains challenging for frontier language models,” the researchers write.&nbsp;</p><p>The test shows that foundation models cannot fully replace human engineers. While they can help solve bugs, they’re not quite at the level where they can start earning freelancing cash by themselves.&nbsp;</p><h2>Benchmarking freelancing models</h2><p>The researchers and 100 other professional software engineers identified potential tasks on Upwork and, without changing any words, fed these to a Docker container to create the SWE-Lancer dataset. The container does not have internet access and cannot access GitHub “to avoid the possible of models scraping code diffs or pull request details,” they explained. </p><p>The team identified 764 individual contributor tasks, totaling about $414,775, ranging from 15-minute bug fixes to weeklong feature requests. These tasks, which included reviewing freelancer proposals and job postings, would pay out $585,225.</p><p>The tasks were added to the expensing platform Expensify.&nbsp;</p><p>The researchers generated prompts based on the task title and description and a snapshot of the codebase. If there were additional proposals to resolve the issue, “we also generated a management task using the issue description and list of proposals,” they explained. </p><p>From here, the researchers moved to end-to-end test development. They wrote Playwright tests for each task that applies these generated patches which were then “triple-verified” by professional software engineers.</p><p>“Tests simulate real-world user flows, such as logging into the application, performing complex actions (making financial transactions) and verifying that the model’s solution works as expected,” the paper explains.&nbsp;</p><p>After running the test, the researchers found that none of the models earned the full $1 million value of the tasks. Claude 3.5 Sonnet, the best-performing model, earned only $208,050 and resolved 26.2% of the individual contributor issues. However, the researchers point out, “the majority of its solutions are incorrect, and higher reliability is needed for trustworthy deployment.”</p><p>The models performed well across most individual contributor tasks, with Claude 3.5-Sonnet performing best, followed by o1 and GPT-4o.&nbsp;</p><p>“Agents excel at localizing, but fail to root cause, resulting in partial or flawed solutions,” the report explains. “Agents pinpoint the source of an issue remarkably quickly, using keyword searches across the whole repository to quickly locate the relevant file and functions — often far faster than a human would. However, they often exhibit a limited understanding of how the issue spans multiple components or files, and fail to address the root cause, leading to solutions that are incorrect or insufficiently comprehensive. We rarely find cases where the agent aims to reproduce the issue or fails due to not finding the right file or location to edit.”</p><p>Interestingly, the models all performed better on manager tasks that required reasoning to evaluate technical understanding.</p><p>These benchmark tests showed that AI models can solve some “low-level” coding problems and can’t replace “low-level” software engineers yet. The models still took time, often made mistakes, and couldn’t chase a bug around to find the root cause of coding problems.

We'd like to thank them all for their hard work!</p><p>Rust now supports asynchronous closures like  which return futures when called. This works like an  which can also capture values from the local environment, just like the difference between regular closures and functions. This also comes with 3 analogous traits in the standard library prelude: , , and .</p><p>In some cases, you could already approximate this with a regular closure and an asynchronous block, like . However, the future returned by such an inner block is not able to borrow from the closure captures, but this does work with  closures:</p><pre><code>let mut vec: Vec&lt;String&gt; = vec![];\n\nlet closure = async || {\n    vec.push(ready(String::from(\"\")).await);\n};\n</code></pre><p>It also has not been possible to properly express higher-ranked function signatures with the  traits returning a , but you can write this with the  traits:</p><pre><code>use core::future::Future;\nasync fn f&lt;Fut&gt;(_: impl for&lt;'a&gt; Fn(&amp;'a u8) -&gt; Fut)\nwhere\n    Fut: Future&lt;Output = ()&gt;,\n{ todo!() }\n\nasync fn f2(_: impl for&lt;'a&gt; AsyncFn(&amp;'a u8))\n{ todo!() }\n\nasync fn main() {\n    async fn g(_: &amp;u8) { todo!() }\n    f(g).await;\n    //~^ ERROR mismatched types\n    //~| ERROR one type is more general than the other\n\n    f2(g).await; // ok!\n}\n</code></pre><h3><a href=\"https://blog.rust-lang.org/2025/02/20/Rust-1.85.0.html#hiding-trait-implementations-from-diagnostics\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></a>Hiding trait implementations from diagnostics</h3><p>The new <code>#[diagnostic::do_not_recommend]</code> attribute is a hint to the compiler to not show the annotated trait implementation as part of a diagnostic message. For library authors, this is a way to keep the compiler from making suggestions that may be unhelpful or misleading. For example:</p><pre><code>pub trait Foo {}\npub trait Bar {}\n\nimpl&lt;T: Foo&gt; Bar for T {}\n\nstruct MyType;\n\nfn main() {\n    let _object: &amp;dyn Bar = &amp;MyType;\n}\n</code></pre><pre><code>error[E0277]: the trait bound `MyType: Bar` is not satisfied\n --&gt; src/main.rs:9:29\n  |\n9 |     let _object: &amp;dyn Bar = &amp;MyType;\n  |                             ^^^^ the trait `Foo` is not implemented for `MyType`\n  |\nnote: required for `MyType` to implement `Bar`\n --&gt; src/main.rs:4:14\n  |\n4 | impl&lt;T: Foo&gt; Bar for T {}\n  |         ---  ^^^     ^\n  |         |\n  |         unsatisfied trait bound introduced here\n  = note: required for the cast from `&amp;MyType` to `&amp;dyn Bar`\n</code></pre><p>For some APIs, it might make good sense for you to implement , and get  indirectly by that blanket implementation. For others, it might be expected that most users should implement  directly, so that  suggestion is a red herring. In that case, adding the diagnostic hint will change the error message like so:</p><pre><code>#[diagnostic::do_not_recommend]\nimpl&lt;T: Foo&gt; Bar for T {}\n</code></pre><pre><code>error[E0277]: the trait bound `MyType: Bar` is not satisfied\n  --&gt; src/main.rs:10:29\n   |\n10 |     let _object: &amp;dyn Bar = &amp;MyType;\n   |                             ^^^^ the trait `Bar` is not implemented for `MyType`\n   |\n   = note: required for the cast from `&amp;MyType` to `&amp;dyn Bar`\n</code></pre><h3><a href=\"https://blog.rust-lang.org/2025/02/20/Rust-1.85.0.html#fromiterator-and-extend-for-tuples\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></a> and  for tuples</h3><p>Earlier versions of Rust implemented convenience traits for iterators of  tuple pairs to behave like , with  in 1.56 and  in 1.79.

One is the love of creating\nbeautiful, elegant code — making Open Source libraries and APIs that focus\non clear design and reusability.  The other passion is building quick,\npragmatic solutions for real users (who may not even be developers).  The\nlatter usually in a setting of building a product, where the product is\nnot the code.  Here, speed and iteration matter more than beautiful code\nor reusability, because success hinges on shipping something people want.</p><p>Flamework is in service of the latter, and in crass violation of the\nformer.</p><p>Early on, I realized that creating reusable code and directly solving\nproblems for users are often at odds.  My first clue came when I helped\nrun the German\n<a href=\"https://www.ubuntuusers.de/\">ubuntuusers</a> website.  It was powered by\na heavily modified version of phpBB, which despite how messy it was,\nscaled to a large user base when patched properly.  It was messy, but easy\nto adjust.  The abstractions were one layer deep.</p><p>Back then, me and a friend tried to replace it by writing my own bulletin\nboard software, <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20070502223619/http://flying.circus.pocoo.org/\">Pocoo</a>.\nWorking in isolation, without users, led me down a path of\nover-engineering.  While we learned a lot and ended up creating popular\nOpen Source libraries (like Jinja, Werkzeug and Pygments), Pocoo never\nbecame a solid product.  Later, my collaborators and I <a href=\"https://github.com/inyokaproject/inyoka/\">rebuilt\nubuntuusers</a>, without the\ngoal of making it into a reusable product.  That rewrite shipped\nsuccessfully and it lives to this very day.</p><p>But it took me years to fully realize what was happening here: reusability\nis not that important when you’re building an application, but it’s\ncrucial when you’re building a library or framework.</p></div><div><p>If you are unfamiliar with Flamework you should watch a talk that Cal\nHenderson gave in 2008 at DjangoCon (<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6Fr65PFqfk\">Why I hate Django</a>).  He talked about scale\nand how Django didn't solve for it.  He enumerated all the things\nimportant to him: sharding, using custom sequences for primary keys,\nforgoing joins and foreign keys, supporting database replication setups,\ndenormalizing data to the extreme.  This is also were I first learned\nabout the possibility of putting all session data into cookies via\nsigning.  It was a memorable talk for me because it showed me that there\nare shortcomings.  Django (which I used for ubuntuusers) had beautiful\nAPIs but at the time solved for little of that Cal needed.  The talk\nreally stuck with me.</p><p>At the time of the talk, Flamework did not really exist.  It was more of\nan idea and principles of engineering at Flickr.</p><p>A few years later, Flamework appeared on GitHub, not as an open-sourced\npiece of Flickr code but as a reimplementation of those same ideas.  You\ncan explore its repository and see code like this:</p><div><pre></pre></div><p>Instinctively it makes me cringe.  Is that a SQL injection?  Well you were\nsupposed to use the PHP <a href=\"https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.addslashes.php\">addslashes</a> function\nbeforehand.  But notice how it caters to sharding and clustering directly\nin the query function.</p></div><div><p>Code like this often triggers a visceral reaction, especially in engineers\nwho prize clean design.</p><p>How does something like that get created?  Cal Henderson described\nFlickr's principle as “doing the dumbest possible thing that will work.”\nMaybe “dumb” is too strong — “simple” might be more apt.  Yet simplicity\ncan look messy to someone expecting a meticulously engineered codebase.\nThis is not at all uncommon and I have seen it over and over.  The first\nlarge commercial project that got traction that I ever worked on (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plurk\">Plurk</a>) was also pretty pragmatic and\nmessy inside.  My former colleague Ben Vinegar also <a href=\"https://benv.ca/blog/posts/the-hardest-problem\">recently shared</a> a story of early,\nmessy FreshBooks code and how he came to terms with it.  Same story at\n<a href=\"https://sentry.io/welcome\">Sentry</a>.  We moved fast, we made a mess.</p><p>None of this is surprising in retrospective.  Perfect code doesn't\nguarantee success if you haven't solved a real problem for real people.\nPursuing elegance in a vacuum leads to abandoned side projects or\nframeworks nobody uses.  By contrast, clunky but functional code often\ncomes with just the right compromises for quick iteration.  And that in\nturn means a lot of messy code powers products that people love —\nsomething that's a far bigger challenge.</p></div><div><p>I have shown Flamework's code to multiple engineers over the years and it\nusually creates such a visceral response.  It blind sights one by\nseemingly disregarding all rules of good software engineering.</p><p>That makes Flamework serve as a fascinating Rorschach test for engineers.\nAre you <a href=\"https://github.com/exflickr/flamework\">looking at it</a> with\nadmiration for the focus on some critical issues like scale, the built-in\nobservability and debugging tools.  Or are you judging it, and its\ncreators, for manually constructing SQL queries, using global variables,\nnot using classes and looking like messy PHP4 code?  Is it a pragmatic\ntool, intentionally designed to iterate quickly at scale, or is it a naive\nmess made by unskilled developers?</p><p>Would I use Flamework?  Hello no.  But I appreciate the priorities behind\nit.  If these ugly choices help you move faster, attract users and\nvalidate the product, then a rewrite, or large refactorings later are a\nsmall price to pay.</p></div><div><p>At the end of the day, where you stand on “shitty code” depends on your\nprimary goal:</p><ul><li>Are you shipping a product and racing to meet user needs?</li><li>Or are you building a reusable library or framework meant to stand the\ntest of time?</li></ul><p>Both mindsets are valid, but they rarely coexist harmoniously in a single\ncodebase.  Flamework is a reminder that messy, simple solutions can be\npowerful if they solve real problems.  Eventually, when the time is right,\nyou can clean it up or rebuild from the ground up.</p><p>The real challenge is deciding which route to take — and when.  Even with\nexperience, it is can be hard to know when to move from quick fixes to\nmore robust foundations.  The principles behind Flamework are also\nreflected in <a href=\"https://develop.sentry.dev/getting-started/philosophy/\">Sentry's development philosophy</a>.  One more\npoignant one being “Embrace the Duct Tape”.  Yet as Sentry matured, much\nof our duct tape didn't stand the test of time, and was re-applied at\nmoments when the real solution would have been a solid foundation poured\nwith concrete.</p><p>That's because successful projects eventually grow up.  What let you\niterate fast in the beginning might eventually turn into an unmaintainable\nmess and will be rebuilt from the inside out.</p><p>I personally would never have built Flamework, it repulses me a bit.  At the\nsame time, I have a enormous respect for the people who build it.  Their\nwork and thinking has shaped how I solve problems and think of product\nengineering.</p></div>","contentLength":6780,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/1iu37xs/ugly_code_and_dumb_things/"},{"title":"Why Firefox?","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/1iu25zd/why_firefox/","date":1740068011,"author":"/u/Flaky_Comfortable425","guid":7437,"unread":true,"content":"<p>This actually makes me curious, when I switch between a lot of distros, jumping from Debian to CentOS to dfferent distros, I can see that they all love firefox, it's not my favorite actually, and there are plenty of internet browsers out there which is free and open source like Brave for example, still I am wondering what kind of attachment they have to this browser</p>","contentLength":368,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Is anyone working on AI designed to preserve democracy?","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/1iu1n10/is_anyone_working_on_ai_designed_to_preserve/","date":1740066712,"author":"/u/BarbaGramm","guid":7466,"unread":true,"content":"<p>I’m looking for people or groups who are already working on something like this:</p><p>A decentralized AI trained to preserve the intellectual, historical, and emotional essence of democracy—what it actually means, not just what future regimes might redefine it to be.
