It has to do with conditionals when selecting between two results in the GPUs. Unfortunately there are a couple of educational websites out there that are spreading some misinformation, and it would be nice correcting that. I tried contacting the authors without success, so without further ado, here goes my attempt to fix things up a little:\nSo, say I have this code, which I actually published the other day:<div> snap45(  v )\n{\n     s = (v);\n     x = (v.x);\n     x&gt;?(s.x,):\n           x&gt;?s*():\n                      (,s.y);\n}</div>\nThe exact details of what it does don't matter for this discussion. All we care about is the two ternary operations deciding what's the final value this function should return. Indeed, depending on the value of the variable , the function will return one of three results, which are simple to compute. I could also have implemented this function with regular  statements, and all that I'm going to say in this article stays true.<p>\nNow, here's the problem - when seeing code like this, somebody somewhere will step up and invariably propose the following \"optimization\", which replaces what they believe (erroneously) are \"conditional branches\" in the code, by arithmetic operations. They will suggest something like this:</p><div> snap45(  v )\n{\n     s = (v);\n     x = (v.x);\n\n     w0 = (,x);\n     w1 = (,x)*(-w0);\n     w2 = -w0-w1;\n\n     res0 = (s.x,);\n     res1 = (s.x,s.y)*();\n     res2 = (,s.y);\n\n     w0*res0 + w1*res1 + w2*res2;\n}</div>\nThere are two things wrong with this practice. The first one shows an incorrect understanding of how the GPU works. In particular, the original shader code had no conditional branching in it. Selecting between a few registers with a ternary operator or with a plain  statement does not lead to conditional branching; all it involves is a conditional move (a.k.a. \"select\"), which is a simple instruction to route the correct bits to the destination register. You can think of it as a bitwise AND+NAND+OR on the source registers, which is a simple combinational circuit. I'll repeat it again - there is no branching, the instruction pointer isn't manipulated, there's no prediction involved, no pipe to flush, no instruction cache to invalidation, no nothing.<p>\nFor the record, of course GPUs can do real branching, and those are fine and fast and totally worth it when big chunks of code and computation are to be skipped given a condition. As with all things computing, always check the generated machine code to know what is happening exactly and when. But one thing you can safely assume without having to check any generated code - when moving simple values or computations like in my original example, you are guaranteed to not branch. This has been true for decades at this point, with GPUs. And while I'm not an expert in CPUs, I am pretty sure this is true for them as well.</p><p>\nThe second wrong thing with the supposedly optimized version is that it actually runs much slower than the original version. You can measure it in a variety of hardware. I can only assume that's because the </p> function is probably implemented with some sort of conditional move or subtract + bit propagation + AND.<div> step(  x,  y )\n{\n     x &lt; y ?  : ;\n}</div>\nEither way, using the step() \"optimization\" are either using the ternary operation anyways, which produces the  or  which they will use to mask in and out the different potential outputs with a series of arithmetic multiplications and additions. Which is wasteful, the values could have been conditionally moved directly, which is what the original shader code did.<p>\nBut don't take my word for it, let's look at the generated machine code for the original code I published:</p><div><div>\nGLSL<div> x&gt;?(s.x,):\n       x&gt;?s*():\n                  (,s.y);</div></div><div>\nAMD Compiler<div>     s0,      v3, , v1\n     v4, , v0\n     s1,   vcc, (v2), s0\n v3, 0, v3, vcc\n v0, v0, v4, vcc\n vcc, (v2), s1\n v1, v1, v3, vcc\n v0, 0, v0, vcc</div></div><div>\nMicrosoft Compiler<div>   r0.xy, l(, ), v0.xy\n   r0.zw, v0.xy, l(, )\n r0.xy, -r0.xyxx, r0.zwzz\n r0.xy, r0.xyxx\n  r1.xyzw, r0.xyxy, l4()\n   r2.xy, l(,), v0.xx  r0.z, l()\n r1.xyzw, r2.yyyy, r1.xyzw, r0.zyzy\n o0.xyzw, r2.xxxx, r0.xzxz, r1.xyzw</div></div></div>\nHere we can confirm that the GPU is not branching, as I explained. Instead, according to the AMD compiler, it's performing the required comparisons ( and  - cmp=compare, gt=greater than, ngt=not greated than), and then using the result to mask the results with the bitwise operations mentioned earlier ( - cnd=conditional).<p>\nThe Microsoft compiler has expressed the same idea/implementation in a different format, but you can still see the comparison (</p> - \"lt\"=less than) and the masking or conditional move ( - mov=move, c=conditionally).<p>\nThere are no jump/branch instructions in these listings.</p><p>\nSomething not related to the discussion but interesting, is that some of the </p> GLSL calls I had in my shader before the ternary operator we are discussing, didn't become GPU instructions but rather instruction modifiers, which is the reason you see them in the listing. This means you can think of abs() calls as being free.\nSo, if you ever see somebody proposing this<div> a = ( b, c, ( y, x ) );</div>\nas an optimization to\nthen please correct them for me.","contentLength":5296,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/1iq2z4j/dont_optimize_conditional_moves_in_shaders_with/"},{"title":"Altman: OpenAI not for sale, especially to competitor who is not able to beat us","url":"https://www.axios.com/2025/02/11/openai-altman-musk-offer","date":1739629077,"author":"/u/namanyayg","guid":340,"unread":true,"content":"","contentLength":0,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/1iq29zz/altman_openai_not_for_sale_especially_to/"},{"title":"What is Event Sourcing?","url":"https://newsletter.scalablethread.com/p/what-is-event-sourcing","date":1739628306,"author":"/u/scalablethread","guid":353,"unread":true,"content":"<p>Traditional data storage typically focuses on the current state of an entity. For example, in an e-commerce system, you might store the current state of a customer's order: items, quantities, shipping address, etc. Event sourcing takes a different approach. Instead of storing the current state directly, it stores the events that led to that state. Each event represents a fact that happened in the past. Think of it as a detailed log of transactions on your bank statement. These events are immutable and stored in an append-only event store. The core idea is that an application's state can be derived by replaying events in the order they occurred, just like you can get your current bank balance by replaying all the transactions from the beginning. This makes Event Sourcing particularly useful for applications that require a high degree of audibility and traceability.</p><p>Every change to the application state is captured as an event object in an Event Sourcing system. These events are then stored in an event store, a database optimized for handling event data. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how Event Sourcing works:</p><ol></ol><p>Reconstructing the state from events involves reading all the events related to an entity from the event store and applying them in sequence to reconstruct the current state. It's like simulating all the changes that have occurred to construct the current state. For example, consider an e-commerce application where an order goes through various states like \"Created,\" \"Paid,\" and \"Shipped.\" To determine the current state of an order, you would:</p><ol><li><p>Retrieve all events related to the order from the event store.</p></li><li><p>Initialize an empty order object.</p></li><li><p>Apply each event to the order object in the order in which they were stored.</p></li></ol><p>By the end of this process, the order object will reflect the current state of the order.</p><p>As the number of events grows, replaying the entire event stream to reconstruct the state can become slow and inefficient. This is where snapshots come in. A snapshot is a saved state of an entity at a specific point in time. Instead of replaying all events from the beginning, the application can load the latest snapshot and then replay only the events that occurred after the snapshot was taken. </p><ul></ul><ul></ul><p><em>If you enjoyed this article, please hit the ‚ù§Ô∏è like button.</em></p><p><em>If you think someone else will benefit from this, then please üîÅ share this post.</em></p>","contentLength":2380,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/1iq20v8/what_is_event_sourcing/"},{"title":"Career transition in to Kubernetes","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/kubernetes/comments/1iq1ka1/career_transition_in_to_kubernetes/","date":1739626865,"author":"/u/Similar-Secretary-86","guid":336,"unread":true,"content":"<p>\"I've spent the last six months working with Docker and Kubernetes to deploy my application on Kubernetes, and I've successfully achieved that.

He‚Äôs perhaps best known for the groundbreaking TV series <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twin_Peaks\">Twin Peaks</a>, which inspired countless shows, including The X-Files, The Sopranos, and Lost.</p><p>Lynch was genuinely a good human being who cared deeply for his actors and crew. He discovered extraordinary talent like Naomi Watts, who had struggled to land a major role in a Hollywood movie after 10 years of auditioning. From the interviews he gave, it quickly becomes apparent that he respected people of all kinds and never put anyone down ‚Äì even those who truly deserved it.</p><p>Lynch is famous for refusing to explain his movies. Although not a fan of his previous work, the great film critic Roger Ebert once wrote that <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mulholland_Drive_(film)\">Mulholland Drive</a> remained compulsively watchable while refusing to yield to interpretation.</p><p>While Lynch offered very little in terms of what his movies meant, he was generous in sharing his views on creativity, work, and life in general. As a tribute to Lynch, I‚Äôd like to share my perspective on his life lessons from a software developer‚Äôs viewpoint.</p><blockquote><p>Ideas are like fish. If you want to catch little fish, you can stay in the shallow water. But if you want to catch the big fish, you‚Äôve got to go deeper.</p></blockquote><p>We‚Äôve all got hundreds or even thousands of ideas floating around in our brains. But the really big ones are few and far between. Once you catch a good one ‚Äìbecause they‚Äôre so rare‚Äì write it down immediately, says Lynch. From there, ideas attract other ideas and start to grow from their initial seed state. The final job is to translate those ideas into a medium, whether it‚Äôs a film, a painting, or software.</p><blockquote><p>The idea is the whole thing. If you stay true to the idea, it tells you everything you need to know, really. You just keep working to make it look like that idea looked, feel like it felt, sound like it sounded, and be the way it was.</p></blockquote><p>Software development is part art, part engineering. We don‚Äôt build the same software over and over again ‚Äì virtually all software is crafted by hand, sometimes with help from AI. If you ask two developers to create a non-trivial program, it‚Äôs very likely that the programs they produce will be different, even if the functionality is the same. Under the hood, the programming language, data structures, and overall architecture may be completely different. And on the surface, the user interfaces may look nothing alike.</p><p>It‚Äôs a good habit to listen to what users have to say, but they often can only describe their problems ‚Äì they rarely come up with good ideas to solve them. And that‚Äôs OK. It‚Äôs our job to find the right ideas, implement them well, and solve tricky problems in a way we, and hopefully the users, will love.</p><blockquote><p>My friend Bushnell Keeler, who was really responsible for me wanting to be a painter, said you need four hours of uninterrupted time to get one hour of good painting in, and that is really true.</p></blockquote><p>Like other creative fields, writing code requires deep concentration. We need to hold complex structures in our minds while working through problems. Switching between coding and other tasks disrupts  ‚Äì that magical state of mind where we lose track of time and produce code effortlessly. That‚Äôs why many developers hate meetings ‚Äì they are toxic to our productivity.</p><blockquote><p>I believe you need technical knowledge. And also, it‚Äôs really, really great to learn by doing. So, you should make a film.</p></blockquote><p>Software development is one of those rare fields where a college degree isn‚Äôt required to succeed. Yes, we should all know the basics, but in my experience, new college graduates often lack the practical knowledge to be effective developers.</p><p>The real learning happens through hands-on experience: building real projects, debugging tricky problems, collaborating with teams, and maintaining code over time. It‚Äôs crucial to never stop learning, experimenting, and iterating on our craft.</p><blockquote><p>Happy accidents are real gifts, and they can open the door to a future that didn‚Äôt even exist.</p></blockquote><p>Tim Berners-Lee invented the web in 1989, while working at CERN, the European Organization for Nuclear Research. Originally conceived to meet the demand for information sharing between scientists around the world, the web went mainstream within just a few years.</p><p>Linus Torvalds created Git due to a licensing dispute over BitKeeper, the original version control system used for Linux development. The need for a new tool led to Git becoming the most widely used version control system today.</p><blockquote><p>I feel that a set should be like a happy family.
