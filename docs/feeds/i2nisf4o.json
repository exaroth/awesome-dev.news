While GCP dealt with the widespread disruption that impacted many critical services, Redpanda Cloud clusters in GCP remained stable, thanks to being purposely designed for the <a href=\"https://www.redpanda.com/blog/celebrating-two-years-redpanda-cloud#raising-the-bar-on-reliability\">SLA we offer</a>, along with a <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/reducing-scope-of-impact-with-cell-based-architecture/what-is-a-cell-based-architecture.html\">cell-based architecture</a> that we also made a <a href=\"https://www.redpanda.com/blog/byoc-data-plane-atomicity-secure-cloud\">product principle</a>. But behind the scenes, it was far from quiet. </p><p>This post provides a brief timeline of events from our own experience, our response, previously untold details about Redpanda Cloud, and closing thoughts on safety and reliability practices in our industry.</p><h2>Why do incidents like this happen</h2><p>Modern computer systems are complex systems —&nbsp;and complex systems are characterized by their non-linear nature, which means that observed changes in an output  proportional to the change in the input. This concept is also known in chaos theory as the , or in systems thinking, with the expression, “The whole is greater than the sum of its parts”.&nbsp;</p><p>When this mathematical fact is acknowledged, safety and reliabiilty measures are put in place, such as closing feedback control loops, phasing change rollouts, shedding load, applying backpressure, randomizing retries, and defining incident response processes, among others.</p><p>GCP’s seemingly innocuous automated quota update triggered a <a href=\"https://status.cloud.google.com/incidents/ow5i3PPK96RduMcb1SsW\">butterfly effect</a> that no human could have predicted, affecting several companies —&nbsp;some known for their impressive engineering culture and considered internet pillars for their long-standing availability record.</p><p>Our Google Cloud Technical Account Manager (TAM) notified us about the outage:</p><p>We began to assess the impact on our Redpanda Cloud GCP customers, including whether we had received any support tickets.&nbsp;</p><p>We noticed our monitoring was running in a degraded state. Despite self-hosting our observability data and stack, we still use a third-party provider for dashboarding and alerting needs. This provider was partially affected. We could still monitor metrics, but we were not getting alert notifications.&nbsp;</p><p>We deemed the loss of alert notifications not critical since we were still able to assess the impact through other means, such as querying our self-managed metrics and logging stack.</p><p>At this point, it was clear that multiple GCP services were experiencing a global outage, despite not having received support tickets from our customers or being paged by Redpanda Cloud alerts. So, in preparation for the worst, we preemptively created a low-severity incident to coordinate the response to multiple  incidents.</p><p>We were notified by the vendor we use for managing cloud marketplaces that they were having issues. They were affected by the <a href=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-service-outage-june-12-2025/\" target=\"_blank\">Cloudflare outage</a>, which we later learned was connected to the GCP outage. Having this service degraded was not critical to us, so we put it on the waiting list.</p><p>Google identified the triggering cause and applied mitigations. At this point, there was no evidence that Redpanda Cloud customers were being negatively impacted. </p><p>We began receiving delayed alert notifications, mostly related to an increase in tiered storage errors, which is not Redpanda’s primary storage. We didn’t get high disk utilization alerts, which we typically receive when the tiered storage subsystem has been experiencing issues for an extended period (days). </p><p>Additionally, as a reliability measure, we leave disk space unused and used-but-reclaimable (for caching), which we can reclaim if the situation warrants it. This outage was not that situation.</p><p>We proactively started reaching out to customers with the highest tiered storage error rates to ensure we were not missing anything, and also to show our support, as is customary. We fully manage these BYOC clusters on behalf of our customers and have complete visibility — we know the answers to the questions, but we ask anyway. These are complex systems, after all.</p><p>After closely monitoring our GCP fleet for some time, we considered the incident mitigated—with the severity unchanged (SEV4), and no evidence of negative customer impact. We noticed an increase in error rate for API calls against GCS, with minimal latency impact in some cases. However, hundreds of GCP clusters were up and healthy.</p><h2>Strengths that played in our favor</h2><p>Acknowledging the risk of hindsight bias, the following factors contributed to the GCP outage having no negative impact on our Redpanda Cloud GCP customers.</p><p>Redpanda Cloud clusters do not externalize their metadata or any other critical services. All the services needed to write and read data, manage topics, ACLs, and other Kafka entities are co-located, with Redpanda core leading the way with its single-binary architecture. This follows a well-known <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/reducing-scope-of-impact-with-cell-based-architecture/what-is-a-cell-based-architecture.html#:~:text=A%20cell-based%20architecture%20uses,of%20the%20overall%20workload%20requests\">architectural pattern</a> aimed at reducing the impact radius of failures, which also improves security.&nbsp;</p><p>We have taken this pattern further and made it a <a href=\"https://www.redpanda.com/blog/byoc-data-plane-atomicity-secure-cloud\">product principle</a>. In contrast, other products boasting centralized metadata and a diskless architecture likely experienced the full weight of this global outage.</p><h3>Purposely designed for the SLA we offer</h3><p>After launching Redpanda Cloud, it took us two years <a href=\"https://www.redpanda.com/blog/celebrating-two-years-redpanda-cloud\">to offer a 99.99% availability SLA. </a>Responsibly offering 1 extra 9 of SLA takes a significant amount of investment and effort. <a href=\"https://www.redpanda.com/blog/high-availability-multi-az-deployment-part-3\">Multi-AZ Redpanda Cloud</a> clusters in GCP were designed to support an availability SLO of at least 99.999%. In practice, we observe even higher measurements. </p><p>This is possible thanks to multiple factors:</p><ul role=\"list\"><li>Redpanda Cloud clusters enforce a replication factor of at least 3 on all topics; customers cannot lower the replication factor, only increase it.&nbsp;</li><li>Redpanda stores the primary data on local NVMe disks and sends older data to tiered storage, asynchronously.</li><li>All Redpanda services are redundant: Kafka API, Schema Registry, and Kafka HTTP Proxy</li><li>There are no additional dependencies in the critical path other than the VPC, compute nodes, and their locally attached disks*</li><li>We continuously chaos-test and load-test Redpanda Cloud tiers' configurations</li><li>We have a strict release engineering process that tests and certifies Redpanda Cloud tiers for the throughput they advertise, in each cloud provider.</li><li>As operations are issued, such as Redpanda or cloud infrastructure upgrades, we try to close our <a href=\"https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Control_Systems/Feedback_Loops\">feedback control loops</a> by watching Redpanda metrics as the phased rollout progresses and stopping when user-facing issues are detected.</li></ul><blockquote>*Except when Private Service Connect (PSC) is enabled, in this case, the PSC becomes part of the critical path for reading and writing data to Redpanda.</blockquote><p>For cloud services such as Redpanda Cloud, which operates across the three major cloud providers and has numerous engineers continuously modifying the system, it is challenging to emerge unharmed from a global outage like this without some degree of fortune – although we learned later that one cluster was badly affected, keep on reading for the details.</p><h3>Redpanda’s location in our customers' technical stacks</h3><p>Understandably, GCP customers were experiencing significant internal chaos and struggling to assess the full impact when we reached out. For some of them, GCP's Pub/Sub served as the data source for their Redpanda BYOC clusters, so they needed to recover that first. While this meant Redpanda's operational status was less critical in those cases, it was still one less element for them to worry about.</p><h3>We didn’t lose nodes en masse during the incident</h3><p>As I was wrapping up this post, another incident had unfolded and was being mitigated. During its incident analysis, we found evidence that the GCP outage was a contributing factor in losing one node and having no replacement coming back. However, this event was isolated to and an uncommon interaction between internal infrastructure components of the cluster.</p><p>Out of hundreds of clusters, we were lucky that only one cluster was affected. It took GCP around two hours to launch the replacement node, roughly the duration of the outage in , the region in which this cluster was located. Fortunately for the customer, the affected cluster was not a production but a staging cluster. Their production Redpanda cluster was unaffected.&nbsp;</p><h3>Observability infrastructure</h3><p>We moved to a self-managed observability stack last year, primarily due to increased scale and cost, and were only using a third-party service for dashboarding and alerting needs. Had we kept our entire observability stack on that service, we would have lost all our fleet-wide log searching capabilities, forcing us to fail over to another vendor with exponentially bigger cost ramifications given our scale. </p><p>In other words, this graph would have been filled with many more red bars and tears:</p><p>As an industry, it seems we keep having to relearn hard lessons from the past. Not too long ago, we were all in awe at the <a href=\"https://www.crowdstrike.com/en-us/blog/falcon-content-update-preliminary-post-incident-report/\">global Crowdstrike outage</a>, where similar controls were missing to enable safer global rollouts, affecting millions of Windows computers, and resulting in hundreds of millions of dollars in damages to their customers.</p><p>With the resurgence of AI, systems will inevitably get even more complex. So, it seems valuable and timely to reconsider our current mindset, and I cannot think of anything better than a <a href=\"https://thesystemsthinker.com/systems-thinking-what-why-when-where-and-how/\">systems thinking mindset</a>, especially when engineering our socio-technical systems, which should also result in increased adoption of control theory in our change management tools.</p><p>Time will tell, perhaps all the above will be left to AI agents to control, perhaps not, for the foreseeable future, it seems we have no AI replacement, so we better hone our systems thinking skills.<a href=\"https://www.redpanda.com/try-redpanda?byoc\" target=\"_blank\">get started with Redpanda Cloud</a> for free or <a href=\"https://www.redpanda.com/contact\" target=\"_blank\">get in touch</a> for a demo.

With linux you can work around the problem by using io_uring, but on windows and mac you're out of luck.

This works with that so if I'm trying to raise coverage on one specific file I can use the fastest coverage tool and use a headless build that compiles and executes quicker.

During our security assessments, we’ve repeatedly exploited unexpected behaviors in Go’s JSON, XML, and YAML parsers to bypass authentication, circumvent authorization controls, and exfiltrate sensitive data from production systems.</p><p>These aren’t theoretical issues—they’ve led to documented vulnerabilities like <a href=\"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/cve-2020-16250\">CVE-2020-16250</a> (a Hashicorp Vault authentication bypass found by Google’s Project Zero) and numerous high-impact findings in our client engagements.</p><p>This post contextualizes these unexpected parser behaviors through three attack scenarios that every security engineer and Go developer should understand:</p><ol><li><strong>(Un)Marshaling unexpected data</strong>: How Go parsers can expose data that developers intended to be private</li><li>: How discrepancies between parsers enable attackers to bypass security controls when multiple services parse the same input</li><li>: How parsers process cross-format payloads with surprising and exploitable results</li></ol><p>We’ll demonstrate each attack scenario with real-world examples and conclude with concrete recommendations for configuring these parsers more securely, including strategies to compensate for security gaps in Go’s standard library.</p><p>Below is a summary of the surprising behaviors we’ll examine, with indicators showing their security status:</p><ul><li>🟢 : Secure by default</li><li>🟠 : Insecure by default but configurable</li><li>🔴 : Insecure by default with no secure configuration options</li></ul><div><table><tbody><tr></tr><tr></tr><tr></tr><tr></tr><tr></tr><tr></tr><tr></tr></tbody></table></div><p>Let’s examine how Go parses JSON, XML, and YAML. Go’s standard library provides JSON and XML parsers but not a YAML parser, for which there are several third-party alternatives. For our analysis, we’ll focus on:</p><p>We’ll use JSON in our following examples, but all three parsers have APIs equivalent to the ones we’ll see.</p><p>At their core, these parsers provide two primary functions:</p><ul><li> (serialize): Converts Go structs into their respective format strings</li><li> (deserialize): Converts format strings back into Go structs</li></ul><p>Go uses struct field tags to allow customization of how parsers should handle individual fields. These tags consist of:</p><ul><li>A  for serialization/deserialization</li><li>Optional <strong>comma-separated directives</strong> that modify behavior (e.g., the  tag option tells the JSON serializer not to include the field in the JSON output string if it is empty)</li></ul><figure><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code data-lang=\"go\"></code></pre></figure><p>To unmarshal a JSON string into the  structure shown above, we must use the  key for the  field,  for the  field, and  for the  field.</p><figure><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code data-lang=\"go\"></code></pre></figure><p>These parsers also offer stream-based alternatives that operate on  interfaces rather than  slices. This API is ideal for parsing streaming data such as HTTP request bodies, making it a preferred choice in HTTP request handling.</p><h2>Attack scenario 1: (Un)Marshaling unexpected data</h2><p>Sometimes, you need to limit which fields of a structure can be marshaled or unmarshaled.</p><p>Let’s consider a simple example in which a back-end server has an HTTP handler for creating users and another for retrieving that user after authentication.</p><p>When creating a user, you may not want the user to be able to set the  field (i.e., unmarshal that field from the user input).</p><p>Similarly, when fetching the user, you may not want the user to return the user’s  or other secret values.</p><p>How can we instruct the parsers not to marshal or unmarshal a field?</p><p>Let’s first see what happens if you don’t set a JSON tag.</p><figure><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code data-lang=\"go\"></code></pre></figure><p>In this case, you can unmarshal the  field with its name, as shown below.</p><figure><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code data-lang=\"go\"></code></pre></figure><p>This is well documented, and most Go devs are aware of it. Let’s look at another example:</p><figure><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code data-lang=\"go\"></code></pre></figure><p>Is it evident that the  field above would be unmarshaled? A less senior or distracted developer could assume it would not and introduce a security vulnerability.</p><p>If you’d like to scan your codebase for this pattern, where some but not all fields have a JSON, XML, or YAML tag, you can use the following Semgrep rule. This rule is not on the our <a href=\"https://semgrep.dev/p/trailofbits\">collection of rules exposed on the Semgrep registry</a> because, depending on the codebase, it is likely to produce many false positives.</p><figure><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code data-lang=\"yaml\"></code></pre></figure><p>To tell the parser not to (un)marshal a specific field, we must add the special  JSON tag!</p><figure><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code data-lang=\"go\"></code></pre></figure><figure><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code data-lang=\"go\"></code></pre></figure><p>Oh, whoops, we were still able to set the  field. We copy-pasted the  part by mistake, which caused the parser to look for the  key in the provided JSON input. I searched for this pattern on the top 1,000 Go repositories by stars on GitHub and, among a few others, I found and reported these two results, which are now fixed:</p><blockquote><p>As a special case, if the field tag is “-”, the field is always omitted. Note that a field with name “-” can still be generated using the tag “-,”.</p></blockquote><p>The XML and YAML parsers operate similarly, with one key difference: the XML parser treats the  tag as invalid. To resolve this, we must prefix the  symbol with an XML namespace, such as .</p><p>Ok, ok, let’s do it right this time.</p><figure><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code data-lang=\"go\"></code></pre></figure><p>Finally! Now, there is no way for the  field to be unmarshaled.</p><p>But I hear you ask: How can these misconfigurations lead to security vulnerabilities? The most common way is, like in our example, using  as the JSON tag for a field such as –a field the user should not control. This is a hard bug to detect with unit tests because unless you have an explicit test that unmarshals an input with the  key and detects if any field was written to, you won’t detect it. You need your IDE or an external tool to detect it.</p><p>We created a <a href=\"https://semgrep.dev/playground/r/trailofbits.go.unmarshal-tag-is-dash?editorMode=advanced\">public Semgrep rule</a> to help you find similar issues in your codebases. Try it with <code>semgrep -c r/trailofbits.go.unmarshal-tag-is-dash</code>!</p><p>Another very simple misconfiguration we’ve found before was a developer mistakenly setting the field name to .</p><figure><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code data-lang=\"go\"></code></pre></figure><p>If you set the JSON tag to , the parser will use  as the field’s name (as expected). Of course, some developers have tried to use this to set the  option in the field while keeping the default name. I searched the top 1,000 Go repositories for this pattern and found these results:</p><p>In these cases, the developer often wanted to set the tag to , which would keep the default name, and add the  tag option.</p><p>Contrary to the previous example, this one is unlikely to have a security impact and should be easy to detect with tests because any attempt to serialize or deserialize input with the expected field name will fail. However, as we can see, it still shows up even in popular open-source repositories. We created a <a href=\"https://semgrep.dev/playground/r/trailofbits.go.unmarshal-tag-is-omitempty?editorMode=advanced\">public Semgrep rule</a> to help you find similar issues in your codebases. Try it with <code>semgrep -c r/trailofbits.go.unmarshal-tag-is-omitempty</code>!</p><h2>Attack scenario 2: Parser differentials</h2><p>What can happen if you parse the same input with different JSON parsers and they disagree on the result? More specifically, which behaviors in Go parsers allow attackers to trigger these discrepancies “reliably”?</p><p>As an example, let’s use the following application using a microservice architecture with:</p><ul><li>A  that receives all user requests</li><li>An  called by the Proxy Service to determine if the user has sufficient permission to complete their request</li><li>Multiple  called by the Proxy Service to perform the business logic</li></ul><p>In this first flow, a regular, non-admin user attempts to perform a , an action they are  to perform.</p><p>In this second flow, the same regular user attempts to perform an , an action they are  to perform.</p><p>Finally, the following flow is because the services disagree on the action the user is trying to perform.</p><p>The Authorization Service, written in a different programming language or using a non-default Go parser, will parse  and grant the user permission to perform the operation, while the Proxy Service, using Go’s default parser, will parse  and proxy it to the incorrect service. The remaining question is: Which payloads can we use to achieve this behavior?</p><p>This is a common architecture we’ve seen multiple times during our audits, and against which we’ve found authentication bypasses because of the problems we’ll describe below. Other examples exist, but most follow the same pattern: the component that does security checks and the component that performs the actions differ in their view of the input data. Here are some of those examples in a variety of scenarios:</p><p>The first differential attack vector we’ll explore is duplicate keys. What happens when your JSON input has the same key twice? It depends on the parser!</p><p>In Go, the JSON parser will always . There is no way to prevent this behavior.</p><figure><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code data-lang=\"go\"></code></pre></figure><p>This is the default behavior of most parsers. However, as shown in the <a href=\"https://bishopfox.com/blog/json-interoperability-vulnerabilities\">JSON interoperability vulnerabilities</a> blog post from Bishop Fox, seven out of the 49 parsers tested take the first key:</p><ul></ul><p>None of these are the most common JSON parsers in their corresponding languages, even though some are common alternatives.</p><p>So, if our Proxy Service uses the Go JSON parser and the Authorization Service uses one of these parsers, we get our discrepancy, as shown in the figure below.</p><p>The XML parser has the same behavior, while the YAML parser returns an error on duplicate fields—the secure default we think all of these parsers should implement.</p><p>While not ideal, at least this behavior is consistent with the most commonly used JSON and XML parsers. Let’s now take a look at a much worse behavior that will almost always get you a discrepancy between Go’s default parser and any other parser.</p><h3>Case insensitive key matching</h3><p>Go’s JSON parser parses field names case-insensitively.

In the example below, we’re using  (the unicode character named Latin small letter long s) as an , and  (the unicode character for the Kelvin sign) as a . From our testing of the <a href=\"https://cs.opensource.google/go/go/+/master:src/encoding/json/fold.go\">JSON library code</a> that does the comparison, only these two unicode characters match ASCII characters.</p><figure><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code data-lang=\"go\"></code></pre></figure><p>Applying it to our running attack scenario, this is how the attack would look like:</p><p>In our opinion, this is the most critical pitfall of Go’s JSON parser because it differs from the default parsers for JavaScript, Python, Rust, Ruby, Java, and all other parsers we tested. This has led to many high-impact security vulnerabilities, including ones we’ve found during our audits.</p><p>This only affects the JSON parser. The XML and YAML parsers use exact matches.</p><p>If you are interested in other kinds of JSON parsing differentials between many parsers, we recommend these two blog posts:</p><p>For the final attack scenario, let’s see what happens if you parse a JSON file with the XML parser or use any other format with the incorrect parser.</p><p>As an example, let’s use <a href=\"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/cve-2020-16250\">CVE-2020-16250</a>, an Hashicorp Vault bypass in its AWS IAM authentication method. This bug was found by Google’s Project Zero team, and a detailed analysis can be found in their <a href=\"https://googleprojectzero.blogspot.com/2020/10/enter-the-vault-auth-issues-hashicorp-vault.html\">“Enter the Vault: Authentication Issues in HashiCorp Vault”</a> blog post if you are interested. We won’t go through all the details in this post, but in summary, this is how the normal Hashicorp Vault AWS IAM authentication flow works:</p><ol><li>The AWS resource sends it to the Vault Server.</li><li>The Vault Server builds that requests and sends it to the AWS Security Token Service (STS).</li><li>AWS STS verifies the signature.</li><li>On success, AWS STS returns the associated role’s identity in an XML document.</li><li>The Vault Server parses the XML, extracts the identity, and, if that AWS role should have access to the requested secrets, it returns them.</li><li>The AWS resource can now use the secret to, for example, authenticate against a database.</li></ol><p>What Google’s Project Zero team found was that an attacker could control too much in step 2, including controlling all headers of the request that Vault builds in step 3. In particular, by setting the  header to , AWS STS would now return a JSON document in step 5 instead of the expected XML document. As a result, the Vault Server would parse a JSON document with Go’s XML parser. Because the XML parser is very lenient and parses anything that looks like XML in between lots of other “garbage” data, this was sufficient for a full authentication bypass when combined with partial control of the JSON response.</p><p>Let’s look at three different behaviors that make parsing files with the wrong Go parser possible and build a polyglot that can be parsed with Go’s JSON, XML, and YAML parsers and return a different result for each.</p><p>By default, the JSON, XML, and YAML parsers don’t prevent unknown fields—properties in the incoming data that don’t match any fields in the target struct.</p><p>Of the three parsers, only the XML parser accepts leading garbage data.</p><p>Again, only the XML parser accepts arbitrary trailing garbage data.</p><p>The exception is using the parsers’ Decoder API with streaming data, in which case the JSON parser accepts garbage trailing data. This an <a href=\"https://github.com/golang/go/issues/36225\">open issue</a> for which a fix is not planned.</p><p>How can we combine all the behaviors we’ve seen so far that build a polyglot that:</p><ul><li>Can be parsed by Go’s JSON, XML, and YAML parsers</li><li>Returns a different result for each</li></ul><p>A very useful piece of information is that JSON is a subset of YAML:</p><blockquote><p>Every JSON file is also a valid YAML file</p></blockquote><p>With this in mind, we can build the following polyglot:</p><p>The JSON parser can parse the polyglot because the input is valid JSON, it ignores unknown keys, and it allows duplicate keys. It takes the  value because its field matching is case-insensitive and it takes the value of the last match.</p><p>The YAML parser can parse the polyglot because the input is valid JSON (and every JSON file is also a valid YAML file), and it ignores unknown keys. It takes the  value because, contrary to the JSON parser, it does exact field name matches.</p><p>Finally, the XML parser can parse the polyglot because it ignores all surrounding data and just looks for XML-looking data, which, in this polyglot, we hid in a JSON value. As a result, it takes .</p><p>The polyglot we’ve constructed is a powerful starting payload when exploiting these data format confusion attacks similar to the HashiCorp Vault bypass we explored above (CVE-2020-16250).</p><p>How can we minimize these risks and make JSON parsing more strict? We’d like to:</p><ul><li>Prevent parsing of  in JSON, XML, and YAML</li><li>Prevent parsing of  in JSON and XML</li><li>Prevent <strong>case insensitive key matches</strong> in JSON (this one is especially important!)</li><li>Prevent  in XML</li><li>Prevent  in JSON and XML</li></ul><p>Unfortunately, JSON only offers one option to make its parsing stricter: <a href=\"https://pkg.go.dev/encoding/json#Decoder.DisallowUnknownFields\"></a>. As the name implies, this option disallows unknown fields in the input JSON. YAML supports the same functionality with the  function, and while there was a <a href=\"https://github.com/golang/go/issues/30301\">proposal</a> to implement the same for XML, it was rejected.</p><p>To prevent the remaining insecure defaults, we must create a custom “hacky” solution. The next code block shows the  function, an attempt to make JSON parsing stricter, which has several limitations:</p><ol><li>: It requires parsing JSON input twice, making it significantly slower.</li><li>: Some edge cases remain undetected, as detailed in the function comments.</li><li>: Since these security measures aren’t built into libraries as secure defaults or configurable options, widespread adoption is unlikely.</li></ol><p>Still, if you detect a vulnerability in your codebase, perhaps this imperfect solution can help you plug a hole while you find a more permanent solution.</p><figure><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code data-lang=\"go\"></code></pre></figure><p>To be widely adopted and solve the problem at a large scale, this functionality needs to be implemented at the library level and enabled by default. This is where <a href=\"https://github.com/golang/go/issues/71497\">JSON v2</a> comes in. It is currently only a proposal, but a lot of work has gone into it already, and it will hopefully be released soon. It improves on JSON v1 in many ways, including:</p><ul><li>Disallowing duplicate names: “(…) in v2 a JSON object with duplicate names results in an error. The <code>jsontext.AllowDuplicateNames</code> option controls this behavior difference.”</li><li>Doing case-sensitive matching: “(…) v2 matches fields using an exact, case-sensitive match. The <code>MatchCaseInsensitiveNames</code> and <code>jsonv1.MatchCaseSensitiveDelimiter</code> options control this behavior difference.”</li><li>It includes a  option, even though it is not enable by default (equivalent to ).</li><li>It includes a  function to process data from an , verifying that an EOF is found, disallowing trailing garbage data.</li></ul><p>While this proposal addresses many of the issues discussed in this blog post, these challenges will persist within the Go ecosystem as widespread adoption takes time. The proposal needs formal acceptance, after which developers must integrate it into all existing JSON-parsing Go code. Until then, these vulnerabilities will continue to pose risks.</p><h2>Key takeaways for developers</h2><ol><li><p><strong>Implement strict parsing by default</strong>. Use  for JSON,  for YAML. Unfortunately, this is all you can do directly with the Go parser APIs.</p></li><li><p><strong>Maintain consistency across boundaries</strong>. When input in processed in multiple services, ensure consistent parsing behavior by always using the same parser or implement additional validation layers, such as the  function shown above.</p></li><li><p>. Keep an eye on the development of Go’s <a href=\"https://github.com/golang/go/issues/71497\">JSON v2</a> library, which addresses many of these issues with safer defaults for JSON.</p></li><li><p>. Use the Semgrep rules we’ve provided to detect a few vulnerable patterns in your codebase, particularly the misuse of the  tag and  fields. Try them with <code>semgrep -c r/trailofbits.go.unmarshal-tag-is-dash</code> and <code>semgrep -c r/trailofbits.go.unmarshal-tag-is-omitempty</code>!</p></li></ol><p>While we’ve provided mitigations and detection strategies, the long-term solution requires fundamental changes to how these parsers operate. Until parser libraries adopt secure defaults, developers must remain vigilant.</p>","contentLength":17871,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1lgwhiw/unexpected_security_footguns_in_gos_parsers/"},{"title":"This Week in Plasma: Plasma 6.4 has arrived!","url":"https://blogs.kde.org/2025/06/21/this-week-in-plasma-plasma-6.4-has-arrived/","date":1750511176,"author":"/u/diegodamohill","guid":164305,"unread":true,"content":"<p>Welcome to a new issue of </p><p>Every week we cover the highlights of what’s happening in the world of KDE Plasma and its associated apps like Discover, System Monitor, and more.</p><p>This week we released <a href=\"https://kde.org/announcements/plasma/6/6.4.0/\">Plasma 6.4</a>!

But, how can the kernel know that what I have plugged in is the “Nanoleaf Pegboard Desk Dock”?

It’s just a very stupid one. If we run  in verbose mode and request the information just for this specific device, we will get a lot more details about it:</p><p>This is a  of information, so we need to take a quick USB class.</p><p>The USB spec is long, complicated and mainly aimed at low-level implementations (think kernel developers, device vendors, and so on). You can, of course, still read it if you enjoy being bored. But, thankfully, a kind soul collected the good parts into <a href=\"https://www.beyondlogic.org/usbnutshell/usb1.shtml\">USB in a NutShell</a>.</p><p>To summarize the summary, a USB device can have multiple , which usually explain the power requirements for the device. Most devices will have just one.</p><p>Each of those configurations can have multiple . So for example, a camera might serve as a file storage device as well as a webcam.</p><p>Finally, each interface can have multiple , whcih describe how the data is transferred. Perhaps the camera has an “isochronous” (continuous) transfer for a webcam feed, and a “bulk” transfer for moving image files over.</p><p>Going back to our device, we can see that it exposes one interface, which is a . HIDs are a class of USB devices that covers things like keyboards, mice or gamepads, and each of those categories is a separate . The kernel contains a generic driver for USB HIDs - <a href=\"https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/master/drivers/hid/usbhid/hid-core.c\">here it is</a> in all of its C glory.</p><p>This is why the kernel developers do not need to write specific drivers for each individual keyboard and mouse on the market. Vendors will label their device with one of the well-known HID sub-classes, then use a common protocol to implement the functionality.</p><p>Unfortunately there’s no HID specification for an RGB LED… thing (well, there’s an “LED” specification, but it’s mainly for things like status LEDs, not color LEDs) so our device is just a plain old generic HID with an interface sub-class of . This means that the kernel recognizes it and powers it correctly, but it doesn’t really know what to do with it, so it just lets it sit there.</p><p>There are two options that we have at this point:</p><ol><li>We could write a kernel driver that follows the <a href=\"https://docs.kernel.org/leds/leds-class.html\">kernel standard</a> and exposes each individual LED as 3 devices (one per color) under . Interacting with the kernel devs sounds scary (yes I realize I’m a grown-ass adult man), but even if it wasn’t, I question the utility of trying to merge drivers for a very niche product into the kernel. Also,  feels like it’s intended for status LEDs and not  anyway.</li><li>We could write a userspace driver through <a href=\"https://github.com/libusb/libusb\">libusb</a>, thus defining our own way of controlling LEDs and reducing the quality bar from “Linus Torvalds might send you a strongly worded letter if you fuck up” to “fuck it, we ball”.</li></ol><p>Given that I have no idea what I am doing, I’m gonna go for option 2, but if one of you brave souls goes for option 1, please let me know and I will print out a photo of you and frame it on my wall.</p><p>To do anything fun on Linux, you need to be .

Thankfully, we can mostly skip over the implementation details, as we can once again refer to the  readout from earlier:</p><pre><code></code></pre><p>In USB parlance,  is always something that the device sends to the host, and  is always something that the host sends to the device. Basically, since this interface has two endpoints, and only one of them is an  endpoint, it’s safe to assume we’re looking to  on endpoint . The peculiarities of Interrupt endpoints will absolutely come back to bite us in a couple of minutes, but for now we can keep them out of sight and out of mind.</p><p>For testing purposes, I want to make the pegboard show a solid red color. According to my earlier investigation, this means that I need to send , followed by 64 repeats of , to an endpoint at . In addition,  only exposes the blocking API of , so we will also need to define a timeout after which  will give up and error out.</p><pre data-lang=\"rust\"><code data-lang=\"rust\"></code></pre><pre><code></code></pre><p>And… just like that, the pegboard now shows a solid red color! We didn’t need to worry about manually splitting packets or any of the underlying implementation, just open up a pipe and write to it! It’s that easy.</p><p>Let’s run it again to make sure it was not a fluke!</p><h2>So, about those interrupts…</h2><p>Yeah, so if you happen to be following along, and you ran the same binary twice, you’ll notice that the firmware of the pegboard crashes unceremoniously, and shortly after reverts to its default animation. And if I go back to the original packet capture - or the official docs - it’s pretty obvious why: the device sends us back a response, but we never read it.</p><p>It turns out that “interrupts” are named as such for a reason, and we should probably handle them as they come in. However, the USB spec defines that the  must poll for interrupts. A device cannot interrupt the host by itself.</p><p>For our simple “driver”, this means we want to poll the device right after we write to it. Thankfully,  gives us a  method, and we have already sneakily defined the  constant. Let’s do just that:</p><pre data-lang=\"rust\"><code data-lang=\"rust\"></code></pre><p>Running this, we see that the contents of  are , which corresponds to  I got from the research. And since we clear the interrupt buffer every time now, we can run this binary many times to define a single solid color on the device. Neat!</p><p>Of course, this is… not really what you want. The device may issue more interrupts. For example, there’s a single button on the desk dock, which can be clicked, double-clicked or long-clicked, and each of those will issue a different interrupt. So what we  want is a background task of sort that will actively poll the device for interrupts and process them as they come in.</p><p>This is where you can get wild with async Rust, , channels, and other fun stuff. That would certainly be the  to do it in an actual, serious driver. But to avoid getting into complexities of async Rust, let’s keep it vanilla and use <a href=\"https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/thread/fn.scope.html\"></a>.</p><p>We’ll also adjust the timeout for reading interrupts to be 1 millisecond, as requested by the device (the  value in the  readout). This doesn’t mean we will get an interrupt every millisecond, just that the device  send one at that rate. If the device sends nothing (i.e., we get  ), we will just continue with the loop.</p><p>Put together, that might look something like this:</p><pre data-lang=\"rust\"><code data-lang=\"rust\"></code></pre><pre><code></code></pre><p>This… works! Of course, we send no more color frames to the device, so we won’t get any more interrupts, but we now have two threads, one which we can use to change the colors shown, and another which we can use to read the interrupts.</p><p>There are some quirks with this device: it seems to require a steady stream of color frames, otherwise it reverts to “offline mode” as it does not receive any new frames from the host, and the first frame’s brightness is significantly lower than the brightness of future frames. Not to mention that, despite what the official protocol documentation would have you believe, the colors seem to be in GRB instead of RGB format, and if you make the device , it will just hard-reset after a couple of seconds. That is, I suppose, a part of the joy of coding.</p><p>But this small proof of concept shows that writing simple device drivers is not all that hard, and that 50 lines of code can bring you quite far. Over the next few weeks I hope to polish up my proof of concept, make a small GUI for it, pack it up and share it with the two other Linux users who own this dumb thing. And I’m happy to have learned the basics of reverse-engineering a simple USB device driver, and using that as a foundation for writing my own. Even if I could have just asked for the spec earlier and not fussed with it.</p>","contentLength":12105,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1lgtc7v/writing_a_basic_linux_device_driver_when_you_know/"},{"title":"Please review my project (a simple Todo App)","url":"https://github.com/Ashind-byte/Task_Manager","date":1750498102,"author":"/u/Loud_Staff5065","guid":164271,"unread":true,"content":"<p>Please dont hate me for using an ORM(spolier).

A new benchmark from researchers across notable universities in the United States and Canada has sparked a twist in the tale.&nbsp;</p><p>It turns out that AI is far from solving some of the most complex coding problems today.&nbsp;</p><p>A <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11928\">study</a> by New York University, Princeton University, the University of California, San Diego, McGill University, and others indicates a significant gap between the coding capabilities of present-day LLMs and elite human intelligence.&nbsp;</p><h2>LLMs Struggle to Use Novel Insights for Problem Solving</h2><p>The researchers began by stating the shortcomings of the benchmarks available today. For instance, the LiveCodeBench evaluation suffers from “inconsistent environments, weak test cases vulnerable to false positives, unbalanced difficulty distributions, and the inability to isolate the effects of search contamination”.&nbsp;</p><p>They added that other benchmarks, like SWE-Bench, test the models on code maintenance rather than algorithmic design.&nbsp;</p><p>Other benchmarks, like CodeELO, do introduce competitive programming problems. Still, their reliance on static and archaic issues makes it difficult to check if models are retrieving solutions based on reasoning or memory.&nbsp;</p><p>To alleviate such concerns, the researchers introduced LiveCodeBench Pro, an evaluation benchmark for coding designed to avoid data contamination. The models were evaluated with 584 problems sourced directly from ‘world-class contests’ before solutions or discussions were available.&nbsp;</p><p>Additionally, a team of Olympiad medalists annotates each problem in the benchmark to categorise it based on its difficulty level and nature—whether it is knowledge-heavy, observation-heavy, or logic-heavy.&nbsp;</p><p>Sadly, none of these models solved a single problem in the ‘Hard’ category. Even the best and latest models from OpenAI, Google, Anthropic, and others that were evaluated scored 0%.&nbsp;</p><p>In the ‘Medium’ difficulty category, OpenAI’s o4-mini-high model scored the highest at 53.5%.&nbsp;</p><p>AI models performed better on knowledge-heavy problems—ones that can be solved by stitching well-known templates, as the requisite problem-solving patterns appear ‘verbatim in training data’. Even on logic-heavy problems, which require a patterned way of thinking, these models performed well.&nbsp;</p><p>However, they performed poorly on observation-heavy problems, whose solutions hinge on the discovery of novel insights — “something that cannot be retrieved from memorised snippets alone”.&nbsp;</p><p>When these researchers diagnosed the failure modes of these models, the largest one was where these models committed errors regarding the algorithms. “These are genuine conceptual slips, instead of surface bugs,” said the authors.&nbsp;</p><p>“LLMs frequently fail even on provided sample inputs, suggesting incomplete utilisation of given information and indicating room for improvement even in simple settings,” added the authors. They also said that these models show a substantial improvement in overall performance with multiple attempts to solve the problems.&nbsp;</p><p>They concluded that these models solve problems involving the implementation of techniques, frameworks, and patterns but struggle to solve ones involving complex reasoning, nuances, and edge cases.&nbsp;</p><p>“Despite claims of surpassing elite humans, a significant gap still remains, particularly in areas demanding novel insights,” they added.&nbsp;</p><p>For detailed information, comparisons, scores, and evaluation mechanisms, check out the technical report’s PDF <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.11928\">here</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>This, however, is one of the many reports that highlight the shortcomings of AI-enabled coding, despite the optimism expressed by several tech leaders worldwide.&nbsp;</p><h2>You Can’t Code for a Long Time With AI</h2><p>Recently, an Oxford researcher, Toby Ord, <a href=\"https://www.tobyord.com/writing/half-life\">proposed</a> that AI agents might have a “half-life” when performing a task.&nbsp;</p><p>This was in relation to <a href=\"https://metr.org/blog/2025-03-19-measuring-ai-ability-to-complete-long-tasks/\">another research</a> from METR (Model Evaluation &amp; Threat Research), which showed that the capacity of AI agents to handle longer tasks doubled every seven months.&nbsp;</p><p>They measured that the doubling time for an 80% success rate is 213 days, and for 50%, it is 212 days, establishing consistency in their findings.&nbsp;</p><p>When Ord analysed the research, he discovered that, just like radioactive decay, the AI agent’s success rate followed an exponential decline.&nbsp;</p><p>For instance, if an AI model could complete a one-hour task with 50% success, it only had a 25% chance of successfully completing a two-hour task. This indicates that for 99% reliability, task duration must be reduced by a factor of 70.&nbsp;</p><p>However, Ord observed a time gap between the 50% success rate time horizon and the 80% success rate time horizon.<p>“For the best model (Claude 3.7 Sonnet), it could achieve a 50% success rate on tasks up to 59 minutes vs only 15 minutes if an 80% success rate was required,” said Ord.</p><p>“If those results generalise to the other models, then we could also see it like this: the task length for an 80% success rate is 1/4 the task length for a 50% success rate. Or in terms of improvement: what is doable with a 50% success rate now is doable with an 80% success rate in 14 months’ time (= 2 doubling times),” he added.&nbsp;</p></p><p>Although METR indicates that AI agents can tackle longer tasks every 7 months, Ord’s analysis shows that high-reliability performance still demands significantly shorter task durations.&nbsp;</p><p>This means the timeline for AI to handle complex coding projects remains unclear, despite steady improvements in capability.</p>","contentLength":5586,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/1lgr7az/ai_models_score_zero_on_hard_category_problems_on/"},{"title":"BBC threatens legal action against AI startup over content scraping","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2025/jun/20/bbc-threatens-legal-action-against-ai-startup-over-content-scraping","date":1750492184,"author":"/u/F0urLeafCl0ver","guid":164089,"unread":true,"content":"<p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/bbc\" data-link-name=\"in body link\" data-component=\"auto-linked-tag\">BBC</a> is threatening legal action against Perplexity AI, in the corporation’s first move to protect its content from being scraped without permission to build artificial intelligence technology.</p><p>The corporation has sent a letter to Aravind Srinivas, the chief executive of the San Francisco-based startup, saying it has gathered evidence that Perplexity’s model was “trained using BBC content”.</p><p>The letter, first reported by the Financial Times, threatens an injunction against Perplexity unless it stops scraping all BBC content to train its AI models, and deletes any copies of the broadcaster’s material it holds unless it provides “a proposal for financial compensation”.</p><p>“If we currently drift in the way we are doing now we will be in crisis,” Davie said, speaking at the Enders conference. “We need to make quick decisions now around areas like … protection of IP.

One idea is to use a single bit to represent the sign. For instance, 0 for positive and 1 for negative. This is called . This system has problems. It creates two ways to write zero (+0 and -0). It also complicates the math for computer hardware.</p><p>Modern computers use a system called  to represent positive and negative integers. In this system, the first bit (the most significant bit, or MSB) indicates the sign. A 0 means positive, and a 1 means negative. The MSB also has a negative value. For an 8-bit number, the MSB has a value of .</p><blockquote><p>For example, in an 8-bit system, we calculate the number  like this:</p><p>(−1×128)+(1×64)+(1×32)+(0×16)+(0×8)+(1×4)+(0×2)+(0×1)</p></blockquote><h4>The Negation Algorithm: Finding the Opposite<a aria-hidden=\"true\" tabindex=\"-1\" href=\"https://beyondit.blog/blogs/DSA-Fundamentals-2-guide-to-computer-number-systems#the-negation-algorithm-finding-the-opposite\"></a></h4><p>Two's complement makes it easy to change a number's sign, like turning 5 into -5.</p><p><strong>The \"Flip and Add One\" Recipe:</strong></p><ol><li><p> all the bits. Change every 0 to a 1, and every 1 to a 0. This is the .</p></li><li><p> to the result. Ignore any extra carry bit at the end.</p></li></ol><blockquote><p> Find the 8-bit two's complement for .</p><ol><li><p>Start with positive 69 in binary: .</p></li><li><p>Invert all the bits: .</p></li><li><p>Add 1: .</p></li></ol><p>So, -69 is stored as .</p></blockquote><p>The main benefit of two's complement is that it simplifies computer math. The computer can use the same hardware circuit for both addition and subtraction. To subtract B from A, the computer calculates <strong>A + (the two's complement of B)</strong>.</p><blockquote><p> Calculate . The computer performs this as .</p><ul><li><p>57 in 8-bit binary is .</p></li><li><p>-28 in 8-bit two's complement is .</p></li></ul><pre><code>  00111001   (57)\n+ 11100100   (-28)\n------------------\n1 00011101   (29)\n</code></pre><p>We ignore the extra carry bit on the left. The 8-bit answer is , which is 29.</p></blockquote><p>This math trick is important for processor design. The part of the processor that performs math is the Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU). Building separate circuits for addition and subtraction would make the ALU larger and use more power.</p><p>With two's complement, the computer needs only one circuit: an adder. To subtract, the computer uses NOT gates to flip the bits of the second number. Then it uses the adder to add 1 and perform the final addition. A single circuit does both operations, making processors smaller and faster.</p><h3>Section 4: Representing Real Numbers<a aria-hidden=\"true\" tabindex=\"-1\" href=\"https://beyondit.blog/blogs/DSA-Fundamentals-2-guide-to-computer-number-systems#section-4-representing-real-numbers\"></a></h3><h4>The Challenge: Representing Fractions and Scientific Notation<a aria-hidden=\"true\" tabindex=\"-1\" href=\"https://beyondit.blog/blogs/DSA-Fundamentals-2-guide-to-computer-number-systems#the-challenge-representing-fractions-and-scientific-notation\"></a></h4><p>We have discussed whole numbers.

The standard adds a fixed number, or , to the real exponent. This allows the storage of positive and negative exponents without a separate sign bit. For a 32-bit number, the bias is 127. The computer stores .</p></li><li><p><strong>Mantissa (23 or 52 bits):</strong> This part stores the number's actual digits. In binary scientific notation, a number always starts with . The standard does not store the leading 1.

It is good for general use.</p></li><li><p><strong>Double-Precision (double):</strong> A 64-bit number with 1 sign bit, 11 exponent bits, and 52 mantissa bits.

This allows the representation of an enormous range of values.</p><p>But there is a catch: the precision is not uniform.</p><ul><li><p>For small numbers near zero, the representable values are close together. Precision is high.</p></li><li><p>For huge numbers, the representable values are far apart. The gap between them can be large.</p></li></ul><p>This is why  does not exactly equal  in many programming languages. The numbers 0.1 and 0.2 cannot be represented perfectly in binary. They are rounded to the nearest available floating-point value. The sum of these rounded values is not the same as the rounded value of 0.3.

MCP supply chain attacks can read your conversations, access your databases, and impersonate you to other services.</p><p>I've been watching a few popular MCP tool repositories. The security practices are... inconsistent. Lots of tools with broad permissions, minimal code review, and maintainers who probably haven't thought much about security.</p><p>Not naming names because I'm not trying to shame anyone, but if you're using MCP tools in production, you might want to audit what you're actually running.</p><p>Tested this stuff against a few internal systems (with permission, obviously). The results weren't great:</p><ul><li>Got tool description injection working against 2/4 MCP implementations</li><li>Found unauthenticated endpoints in 1/10 production deployments</li><li>Identified several tools with way more permissions than they needed</li></ul><p>The scariest part? Most of this stuff would be invisible in standard logs.

This means getting it to work with every\nlibrary and tool that Postgres works with, out of the box. Lately we've been focussing a lot of\neffort on <a href=\"https://www.sqlalchemy.org/\">SQLAlchemy</a>, a popular ORM for Python. Their MySQL\nintegration works flawlessly with Dolt, but their Postgres version is apparently completely\ndifferent, relying heavily on the  tables. A customer tried it out and <a href=\"https://github.com/dolthub/doltgresql/issues/1465\">found a lot of\ngaps</a> owing to Doltgres not including system\ntables (e.g. ) in the  tables. So I fixed that, but this led to a mysterious\nperfomance regression in one of our test suites, over a 3x slowdown.</p><p>It took quite a bit of puzzling to figure out why such an innocuous seeming change caused such a\ndramatic difference in performance. In the end, what helped the most was an amazing tool in the Go\ntoolchain: visualizing the difference between two performance profiles with the  option to\n.</p><p>Go ships with a robust profiling tool, . Unlike some other languages, you have to explicitly\nenable it in your code to get a profile; you can't do it after the fact or with command line\nflags. This is easy, but you have to write the code to do it. In our case, I placed it directly in\nthe test method being profiled.</p><div data-language=\"go\"><pre><code>t testingT ok  osok \n\t\n\tp  profileprofileCPUProfile p</code></pre></div><p>The final two lines of this snippet start a CPU profile, then stop it when the method completes. It\nuses the  package, which provides a more ergonomic wrapper around the\nbuilt-in profiler libraries. If you run code that does this, you'll see an output line like the\nfollowing:</p><div data-language=\"text\"><pre><code>2025/06/20 14:10:40.548730 profile: cpu profiling disabled, C:\\Users\\ZACHMU~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\profile1113350212\\cpu.pprof</code></pre></div><p>This is the location of the profile produced by the run, which you should note or copy into another\nlocation with an easier to remember name.</p><p>For my testing, I wanted to see how the performance changed between what was on the  branch\nand my current branch, so I ran the test with profiling enabled on each branch. Now I can compare\nthem using the  flag with .</p><p>After getting a profile for each branch, now I just need to compare them.</p><div data-language=\"sh\"><pre><code>go tool pprof :8090  main.pprof branch.pprof</code></pre></div><p>The  flag tells  to \"subtract\" the named profile from the other one when reporting\nperformance numbers. In this case, I want to see what is happening in  but not in\n that's taking so long. I also always use the  flag, which runs an interactive\nweb server instead of a command-line interface. I find it much easier to work with when\ninvestigating performance profiles.</p><p>When I run the command, my web browser launches to the default display, a graph of cumulative CPU\nsamples roughly topo-sorted by function, so you can see what calls what. Unlike in a normal profile\nanalysis, the numbers shown are strictly the diff between the two profiles, rather than their\nabsolute runtimes. Here's what I saw in my web view:</p><p><code>Database.tableInsensitive</code> is the function that fetches a table object for the query engine to\nuse. Somehow, my changes had made this function much, much slower, despite not editing it\ndirectly. With this clue in hand, I was able to find the performance bug.</p><div data-language=\"go\"><pre><code>\n\n\ttableNames err  dbctx root err  doltdbTableName err\n\t root\n\t\ttableMap  table  tableNames \n\t\t\ttableMapstringstable table\n\t\t\n\t\tdbStateroot tableMap\n\n\ttableName ok  sqltableName tableNamesok  doltdbTableName</code></pre></div><p>The first line of the snippet loads all table names from the DB if they weren't already cached in\nthe session. This is necessary because our table names are stored in a case-sensitive manner, but\nSQL is case-insensitive. So, as part of loading a table from the DB, we need to correct the\nrequested case-insensitive name from the query to the case-sensitive one for use in the storage and\nI/O layer. But that call to  includes a final parameter:\n<code>includeGeneratedSystemTables</code>. This was hard-coded to true, which meant it was always calling the\nnew, more expensive method of getting a list of generated system tables, which includes potential\ndisk access to get the set of database schemas and then lots of iteration over them.</p><div data-language=\"go\"><pre><code>\tschemas err  rootctx err  err\n\tschemas\n\t\tschemas schemas schemaDatabaseSchemaName doltdbDefaultSchemaName schema  schemas \n\t\ttableNames err  rootctx schemaName err  err\n\t\t pre  doltdbGeneratedSystemTablePrefixes  tableName  tableNames \n\t\t\t\tsdoltdbTableName\n\t\t\t\t\tName   pre  tableName\n\t\t\t\t\tSchema schemaName UseSearchPath  schemaName  schemaName  doltdbDoltNamespace  name  doltdbDoltGeneratedTableNames \n\t\t\t\tsdoltdbTableName\n\t\t\t\t\tName   name\n\t\t\t\t\tSchema schemaName</code></pre></div><p>As it turns out, the hard-coded  was simply wrong -- this method never needed to consider\nsystem-generated table names. But it was a relatively harmless bug before I made the process of\ngenerating those names more expensive, and had been in the code for years unnoticed. Changing this\nvalue to  to remove the unnecessary work fixed the performance regression, and also sped up\nDolt's benchmarks by a bit as well.</p><table><thead><tr></tr></thead><tbody><tr></tr><tr></tr><tr></tr><tr></tr><tr></tr><tr></tr><tr></tr><tr></tr><tr></tr><tr></tr></tbody></table><p>I'm not sure I ever would have figured out the source of this inefficiency without the  flag\nto point me in the right direction.</p><p>Questions about Go performance profiling or about <a href=\"https://www.doltgres.com/\">Doltgres</a>?

I started looking for a better language to grow with.</p><p>It seemed simple, minimalistic, efficient - a relatively easy shift from Node. But after about a week, I dropped it. Yeah, minimalism is cool and all, but it lacks a lot of features I really value. And most importantly, it drove me insane with:</p><ol><li><p>Error propagation - writing the same 4 lines in every function, on every layer? nah.</p></li><li><p>Access modifiers based on capital letters, really?</p></li></ol><p>What I did like about Go was that you get a complete standard toolchain out of the box. No need to install 20+ dev dependencies like in Node. I think Go could be a great fit for certain use cases, but for me, it felt too limited for most projects I care about.</p><p><strong>Then I thought about C++.</strong></p><p>I’ve used it before for competitive programming, and I enjoy stuff like macros and operator overloading. But package management? CMake? Total nightmare. So I decided to leave C++ strictly for CP stuff.</p><p><strong>And then… I fell in love - at first sight - with Rust.</strong></p><p>Just a few weeks ago I discovered Rust, and I love so many things about it. The macros, enums, pattern matching, trait overloading... it’s awesome seeing how all these features come together in practice.</p><p>Some parts are a bit weird at first - like ownership, borrowing, and lifetimes - but I think it just takes time to get used to them. Overall, I really believe Rust knowledge will be super valuable for my career. I’d love to contribute to distributed systems, or build supporting tools, instead of staying in the usual API/microservice zone forever.</p><p>So right now I’m looking for advice - what direction should I take next? Sure, I can just research on my own (as I usually do), but hearing from real people who are on the same journey - or already walked it - would be incredibly helpful. I’d love to hear your stories too.</p><p>Currently I’m going through the official Rust docs to get the basics down. But I’m also hunting for some advanced books or resources. A lot of books I found just copy-paste examples from the docs, and I’m hoping for something deeper. If you have any recommendations - even if it’s not web-related, or too advanced for a beginner - I’d seriously appreciate it. The more challenging, the better.</p><p>Thanks for reading - and excited to join the Rust path with all of you 🤘</p>","contentLength":3046,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Did you switch to Linux because you loved it?","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/1lgcnt1/did_you_switch_to_linux_because_you_loved_it/","date":1750447406,"author":"/u/gerundingnounshire","guid":163781,"unread":true,"content":"<p>I've noticed a common sentiment from many Linux users of \"I switched to Linux because Windows sucks,\" and I don't really share that.

And anyone who’s worked under a terrible architect will take a dim view of the role pretty quickly. Also, the reality is that people like to complain more than they like to praise, so online sources—especially places like Reddit—can be a pretty mixed bag.</p><p>So, let’s spend some time talking about what a software architect is and what they do, then dive into defining the traits and habits that differentiate the ones who give the role a bad name from those who make developers’ lives easier.</p><p>Full disclosure: I’ve never officially held the title of software architect but I have spent a lot of my career dancing around the role. I’ve had the good fortune to work with some very strong architects early on in my career at Ubisoft and Mozilla, so I’ve experienced firsthand how a good software architect can make a developer’s life easier. Later, in roles at Datadog and Scaleway, I got to focus on understanding and explaining the business case for technical decisions; reversing that to explain the technical case serving those business decisions; and teaching the next generation of developers how to build and maintain large systems.</p><p>Those are responsibilities all software architects would be very familiar with! So let’s get a little more into what that looks like day to day.</p><p>The software architect is responsible for ensuring a company’s technology supports the long-term continuity and success of the organization. This takes a very specific blend of skills, including technical mastery, business acumen, and leadership.</p><p>On a day-to-day basis, a good architect is going to be in constant contact with almost every aspect of the business. That means meeting with executives, lead developers, product people, sales people, logistics, finances, vendors and more. That’s a lot of meetings and a lot of people.</p><p>As you might imagine, trying to get all those diverse stakeholders on the same page so the tech team can do their job is difficult to do well under optimal conditions—and, to put it bluntly, conditions are never optimal.</p><p>Other than the onslaught of meetings, a typical week might include:</p><ul><li>Reviewing architecture plans (of course!)</li><li>Evaluating project designs</li><li>Cost analysis, cost/benefit analysis, cost projections, etc.</li><li>Reviewing readiness programs, including failover strategies</li><li>Chaos engineering day reviews; working with the SREs to design the chaos scenarios</li><li>Writing “Architecture Decision Records” (ADRs)</li><li>Building road maps for projects</li></ul><p>Basically, the software architect has the impossible task of bringing order to the chaos of people, procedure, and policy that make up any large company.</p><p>So, how do you excel at such a big job? It takes a lot of experience in a variety of domains, and a genuine interest in business, leadership,  technology. All three are mandatory; missing one or more of these is often the root cause of failure in the role.</p><p>So, we’re going to break down essential practices along those lines.</p><p>Yes, I know how that sounds, but stick with me here. Coming from a tech background, as most software architects do, one of the hardest practices is putting the needs of the business before  considerations.</p><ul><li>Becoming as knowledgeable in the business domain as you are in your technical understanding. You need to understand the nuances of the industry, how the business works—and the unique challenges it faces—just as well as you understand your preferred programming language.</li><li>Putting the business needs first in every compromise and decision.</li><li>Becoming ROI-driven. Scary!</li></ul><p>When you’ve properly aligned your priorities, you will offer technical solutions that bring the most value to the business. The upside here is that when you can do this well, it makes  extremely valuable too, which is great for your own career advancement.</p><p>As a software architect, you’re on the hook for timelines and budgets. If you give in to overpromising or nodding along to impossible requests, you set yourself up for failure no matter how perfectly your design ideals meet business requirements. But when you’ve managed expectations effectively throughout the project, both your executive and development teams will be much happier with the result—and with you!</p><h3>Understand which risks are OK and which aren’t</h3><p>As both a tech expert and a business expert, you need to understand and weigh the risks on both sides. But not every project that comes across your desk as an architect requires the same level of conceptualization and planning. Some will impact flagship products that drive the business, while others will be much smaller and have a very small impact on ROI. These two different types of projects require different levels of architecting.</p><p>While it may be tempting to subject every project to the same level of planning, over-analyzing low-risk projects adds time and overhead to a project that reduces ROI without significantly affecting the final result. However, under-preparing for high-risk projects can lead to disaster. Therefore, knowing which is which—and acting appropriately—is a big part of success or failure at the end of the day.</p><h3>Navigate complex internal politics</h3><p>I mentioned this before, but as a software architect, one of your core responsibilities is meeting with diverse stakeholders. Each of these people will have their own priorities, ideas and fiefdoms they want to protect. You’ll be talking to developers about financial decisions, leadership about technical decisions, and defending every choice to all of them. Ergo, maintaining a working relationship with each of these stakeholders is vital to your success as a software architect. To put it another way, if half of the role is avoiding stepping on people’s toes, the other half is stepping on them .</p><p>A lot of being a software architect is being likable enough that people want to listen to what  you have to say. Because you’re dealing with so many different parts of the business, you’ll rarely have the direct authority to “make” people do something—but, if they trust you and enjoy working with you, they’ll be much more inclined to go along with what you’re asking of them.</p><p>On the other hand, sometimes, you just have to tell a developer, “We’re not doing it that way. We’re doing it this way, and you need to get on board—” Being a jerk here  work. You need to be competent, confident, and above all, .</p><h3>Be OK with imperfect equilibrium</h3><p>Building software isn’t like playing chess. You don’t know all the moves, or where all the pieces are. And, even if you did, next year, the chess board is going to change, and suddenly you’re playing checkers or mahjong. You will never know as much as you would like and you don’t always have the luxury of waiting until you have all the answers.</p><p>Instead, you have to be OK with making some data-poor decisions, knowing full well that you’re missing something—and everything may need to change tomorrow anyway—just so the project can keep moving forward. Yes, this is wildly uncomfortable, but it’s exactly where having trusted partners in the organization will help.</p><p>As a software architect, you’re not generally limited to a single team—in fact, you’re usually a bridge between them.</p><p>You need to be able to communicate complex technical issues to business stakeholders so they can make good decisions. You also have to do the reverse, translating business objectives into technical requirements so you can align the technical vision with the business strategy.</p><p>When you’re an architect, everyone has an opinion on how you should do your job, but no one sees the problems or goals as well as you do. That means you will get suggestions and requests from a variety of directions, many of which will require a negative response.</p><ul><li>You’ll tell business leaders ‘no, that’s not possible.’</li><li>You’ll tell sales ‘no, we can’t build that feature right now.’</li><li>You’ll tell developers ‘no, we don’t need to rewrite that; it works fine.’</li></ul><p>Being able to respond to impossible requests with a polite ‘no’ is essential to save your team, your relationships, and your sanity.</p><p>Most software architects start as developers, where it’s important to have a deep understanding of a limited number of tools. However, this type of understanding can act as a set of blinkers as an architect, causing you to view every problem through the filter of your expertise.</p><p>Obviously, you can’t gain the same depth of understanding for everything, but you don’t need to. By increasing your high-level understanding of all the tools at your disposal, you give yourself the ability to choose the right tool for the right job, instead of restricting your team to work with languages and tools that you understand and feel comfortable in.</p><h3>Master perspective shifts</h3><p>As an architect, both the big picture and the intricate details are your domain. To be able to work in both areas, you need to be skilled at zooming out to see how all the parts work together to satisfy business requirements and zooming in to see how each detail fits into the overall design.</p><p>Being able to switch between, without losing your focus on what is important in the moment, will help make you a great software architect.</p><h3>Find the signal in the noise</h3><p>In the beginning of the project, there’s a lot of noise. You have future requirements, past ideas, legacy tech, and everyone’s opinions on what’s important and how you should set about making it all happen. From all this information and static, you need to be able to zoom in to that one piece—that one pixel—and decide  is where we need to start.</p><p>I like to think of it like a Fourier Transform. At the start, there’s a cacophony of frequencies. You’re the algorithm that takes the chaos and spits out those discrete pieces of information that give your team a good starting place.</p><p>For the most part, we’ve been talking about how to succeed as a software architect from a pretty high level. But if you’re interested in the role, you probably need something a little more concrete. You want to know if all that personal growth above is moving the needle at all.</p><p>Everywhere is different, but here’s a list of measurables you can look at to give you concrete feedback on how well you’re doing.</p><p>This is one of the most telling indicators of your architectural decisions. You'll want to track not just the frequency of incidents, but their severity and duration as well. A well-architected system should experience fewer critical incidents, and when problems do occur, they should be contained and resolved quickly. If you're seeing an uptick in severe, long-lasting incidents, it's often a sign that architectural decisions need revisiting.</p><p>These tell you how well your architectural standards are being followed across the organization. This includes everything from security protocols to coding standards to deployment procedures. Low compliance rates might indicate that your architectural guidelines are either too complex, poorly communicated, or not aligned with the team's actual needs.</p><p>This is a blog post on its own, but briefly stated, managing tech debt requires a two-pronged evaluation. First, assess how much tech debt you're actually dealing with—is it growing, shrinking, or staying constant? More importantly, evaluate how that tech debt is impacting the business. Some tech debt is acceptable if it's not slowing down feature delivery or creating operational headaches. The key is understanding when tech debt crosses the line from manageable to business-impacting.</p><p>When it comes to metrics, focus on <em>execution against expectations</em>. Are you consistently meeting the timelines you've committed to? More critically, are you delivering solutions that actually meet the business requirements? It's worth noting that being on time but missing the mark on business value is often worse than being slightly late with exactly what the business needs.</p><p>Brass tacks: this isn’t easy to measure, but it is important to try. The idea is to measure how well different systems and teams are working together under your architectural vision. Smooth integrations between services, teams, and external vendors indicate that your architectural decisions are facilitating rather than hindering collaboration.</p><p>Finally, cost management reflects your ability to balance technical excellence with business realities. This includes not just the obvious costs like infrastructure and tooling, but also the hidden costs of complexity, maintenance overhead, and developer productivity. The best architects find ways to reduce total cost of ownership while improving system capabilities.</p><p>If you’re a senior developer, or moved into an architect role from a senior developer position, the list of skills above will probably be all new to you. For some this change is a breath of fresh air, for others a rude awakening.</p><p>Stepping away from a purely technically-focused career isn’t for everybody. It’s not a reward. You want to really  to focus on how you can help the company build something at a different level. Correspondingly, I would counsel everyone looking to move into the role that it takes a very particular personality type to excel as an architect, as the Venn diagram of the prototypical architect and the prototypical developer don’t overlap as much as you might think.</p><p>That being said, the role can be incredibly rewarding, and the skills and practices we’ve discussed here will help you not only excel in the role, but  it as well.</p>","contentLength":13884,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/1lg6njs/practices_that_set_great_software_architects_apart/"},{"title":"Shoutout to nftables. Finally switched and never looking back.","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/1lg62i9/shoutout_to_nftables_finally_switched_and_never/","date":1750431409,"author":"/u/MechanicalOrange5","guid":164090,"unread":true,"content":"<p>Most people in the linux space has heard of nftables, or are vaguely aware of it's existence. If you're like me you probably thought something like \"One day I'll go see what that's about\". Recently I did that. I had to set up a router-like VM with some some fairly non standard firewalling. Nftables made this incredibly easy to do and understand. But before I continue singing it's praises, I'm not advocating anyone switching if whatever you are using is working. If your ufw/shorewall/firewalld/iptables setup is working and you are happy, keep on winning!</p><p>But if you're like me when you have to deal with firewalling and you always get a little feeling of \"I am fairly sure I did this right, but I'm not super confident that it's precisely doing what I want.\" Or you set some firewall up and you aren't sure if it really is totally protecting you, then nftables is for you. Of course you can still make an insecure firewall setup with nftables, but what I am getting at is it makes the configuration a lot easier, and has much less of a mental burden for me, personally.</p><p>If you've done a bit of firewalling, particularly iptables, you can pick it up fairly quickly. I'd recommend going through their wiki in it's entirety, and the Red Hat docs on nftables is also pretty good. </p><p>But what I like about it is that it looks like most distro's I've checked it comes with a config file and a systemd unit that loads it on startup. A config file is nice for me because it makes life easier for me when I am using configuration management. </p><p>The config file also in my opinion seems simpler than what you'd get with iptables-save and the UFW files. Shorewall just confused me, but that's just a me problem. I haven't personally tried firewalld.</p><p>nftables has atomic config reloading. `nft -f /file/name`. If your config is valid, it will apply it. If not, it will keep the old config, no weird states. I know this isn't particularly spectacular, but It's nice.</p><p>nftables is pretty simple but it is incredibly powerful in my experience. Which means for me if I want a simple firewall setup, the config is going to be easy to read, and if I've got something complex, I don't have to reach for any other tools to get the job done.</p><p>Possibly the best feature in my limited opinion so far is sets and maps, and the ability to put expiry on them. These allow you to dynamically alter your firewall's behavior at \"runtime\" without reloading the firewall config. You can have lists of IPs in an allow list, or invert it and you have a deny list. You can do all kinds of crazy things with maps and sets.</p><p>For instance we had a client who wanted things blacklisted and whitelisted. Easy enough, with almost any firewall tech, but I like the fact that I could define a set in my config, and then the actual rule looks something like </p><p><code>ip daddr \\@blocklist drop</code></p><p>You can then modify the set using code or cli commands, and your firewall's behavior will change accordingly, and you don't have to worry about possibly messing up a rule.</p><p>What sold me though was when the client came up with the requirement to have allowlists based on hostnames. As most of us know these days, and sort of large website is littered with CDN's for loading assets, JS, and all sorts of things. And CDN DNS usually has a TTL of 10s, their IPs change constantly and this would just be a pain to manage with most firewalling things I've used. But nftables made it a breeze. I set up a set of ip addresses, with a few minutes expiry, and just made a simple cron job to resolve the CDN hostnames and put the IPs in the set with an expiry. If IPs are added again, the expiry is refreshed. If they aren't seen again, eventually they are evicted from the list. This worked flawlessly and even the most wild CDNs are still accessible, giving our clients a very much not broken website to work with. </p><p>I had a similar setup with some of their hosts going through the routing VM that have to have different firewall rules based on what groups they were assigned in a database. Unfortunately, these groups' clients don't nearly fall in any neat CIDR that I can cordon off to apply rules to (all of them were just spread across a /16 subnet), and hosts can be moved from groups at a moments notice. So again, I just made some sets for representing the groups, a little cron that queries the database and grabs the IPs, puts them in the appropriate set with a few minutes expiry. If the client moves a host from one group to another, it will be added to the other group and expired out of the other one. Of course you can have more complex logic to do this in a better way, but for our requirements this was sufficient. </p><p>I just had some rules. Group1 jumps to this chain, all of it's rules are there, group2 jumps to a different chain, and their rules are there. And the membership of these groups are constantly updated and in sync with our database. </p><p>TL;DR: If you aren't happy with how you are doing firewalling on linux, give nftables a shot. It turned firewalling from a fear inducing \"will I open a vulnerability and bankrupt my company\" process, to a \"Bring it on, I can make this thing as complicated as you need without hurting my brain\" process.</p>","contentLength":5181,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Complete Kubernetes Monitoring by Grafana","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/kubernetes/comments/1lg564i/complete_kubernetes_monitoring_by_grafana/","date":1750429158,"author":"/u/Late_Organization_47","guid":163626,"unread":true,"content":"<p>Kubernetes monitoring is a very popular topic.

Today, we’re exploring a key aspect of distributed systems: how to think about dependencies between components and why it matters for reliability.</em></p><p>When we build a system composed of multiple components (e.g., database, services, caches), it’s important to understand the dependency graph. For example, a service might depend on:</p><ul><li><p>A messaging layer to exchange information</p></li><li><p>A cache to reduce latency</p></li></ul><p>Having a clear understanding of the dependencies in a system helps us maintain it more efficiently. But there's one question we often overlook: Are these dependencies soft or hard?</p><ul></ul><p><strong>the service works reliably</strong></p><p>Two examples to illustrate the concept of soft and hard dependencies:</p><ul></ul><p>Understanding the type of dependency helps us make the right decisions:</p><ul><li><ul><li><p>Soft: High reliability expectation may not be necessary. Back to the example of a recommendation service for a streaming system, this service doesn’t need 5 9s availability (99.999%) if it isn’t on the critical user journey.</p></li><li><p>Hard: A hard dependency must match or even exceed the reliability of the dependent service. If a critical backend is only available 99.5% of the time but our own SLO is 99.9%, we have a structural problem. Setting the right expectation for a hard dependency is critical.</p></li></ul></li><li><ul><li><p>Soft: If the dependency is unavailable, we are not obliged to build a proper fault-tolerant strategy. We can let it degrade gracefully and wait for it to be back.</p></li><li><p>Hard: If the dependency is unavailable, we need to work on a strategy, such as establishing an efficient fallback strategy to keep our service running.</p></li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Observability and alerting</strong></p><ul><li><p>Soft: Observability is still important, but alerts can often have a lower priority or be routed differently.</p></li><li><p>Hard: The dependency must be tightly monitored. Failures or even minor degradation, such as latency spikes, error rates, or availability dips, must be tracked continuously.</p></li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Rollout and change management</strong></p><ul><li><p>Soft: Changes can be managed with more flexibility. Rollout may not require tight coordination or strict sequencing, and temporary failures might be acceptable.</p></li><li><p>Hard: Rollouts become delicate operations. We often need tight orchestration between teams, version compatibility checks, gradual rollouts with validation at each step, and well-tested rollback mechanisms. Any mistake could trigger a production incident.</p></li></ul></li></ul><p>Classifying a dependency isn’t always obvious.</p><p>In some cases, it’s fairly straightforward. For example, if a REST endpoint requires a database query, that database is a hard dependency. But gray areas are fairly common, for example:</p><ul><li><p>A service can run without a certain dependency at runtime, but it still needs that dependency at startup to initialize. In this case, the dependency is hard from an operational point of view. If it’s down during a deploy or a scale-out, we can’t even get the service running.</p></li><li><p>A service calls a soft dependency, but the RPC call has no timeout or fallback. If the dependency becomes unresponsive, the latency of our service spikes, possibly exhausting thread pools or request queues. What was supposed to be a soft dependency now puts the entire system at risk.</p></li></ul><p><strong>Whether a dependency is technically optional doesn't matter if the failure of this dependency ends up blocking our service</strong></p><p>In many systems, identifying these cases is not trivial. Approaches like deliberately breaking dependencies or introducing hazardous conditions (e.g., random network delays) can help reveal which dependencies are truly non-critical and which ones only appear to be.</p><p><strong>A dependency that starts as soft can easily turn into a hard one over time</strong></p><p>Let’s consider a service that reads data from a database. We introduce a cache to reduce latency. Initially, this cache is a soft dependency. If it goes down, we fall back to the database, which results in an acceptable latency increase.</p><p>Yet, as traffic grows, the service begins to rely on the cache not just for latency but for throughput. At some point, if the cache becomes cold and every request hits the database, the database may no longer be able to handle the load.</p><p>In this example, the cache was a soft dependency, but it became a hard one due to changes in system conditions (more traffic).</p><p>This evolution (from soft to hard) is, unfortunately, much more common than the reverse. Without active effort on efficient maintenance and continuous, it’s fairly common for a soft dependency to turn silently into a hard one.</p><p><strong>it’s possible to turn a hard dependency into a soft one</strong></p><p><strong>fallbacks need to be tested, and they need to be tested continuously</strong></p><p>Once we’ve reached a point where the dependency can go down and users don’t notice, then the dependency is soft. Turning hard dependencies into soft ones is one of the most effective ways to improve the reliability of a system.</p><ul><li><p>To manage dependencies effectively, we need to classify them as either soft or hard.</p></li><li><p>To avoid surprises, we must understand that soft dependencies can turn hard without warning, especially as systems scale.</p></li><li><p>To improve reliability, we should actively turn hard dependencies into soft ones using strategies like efficient fallbacks.</p></li></ul><p><em>Have you seen a soft dependency quietly become critical over time?</em></p><p><em>If you made it this far and enjoyed the post, please consider giving it a like.</em></p>","contentLength":5227,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/1lg2gty/soft_vs_hard_dependency_a_better_way_to_think/"},{"title":"[Release] Kubernetes MCP Server - Safe Kubernetes debugging","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/kubernetes/comments/1lg2frc/release_kubernetes_mcp_server_safe_kubernetes/","date":1750421541,"author":"/u/kkb0318","guid":163671,"unread":true,"content":"<div><p>I've built a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that lets you safely debug and inspect Kubernetes clusters using Claude or other LLMs.</p><ul><li>Provides read-only access to K8s resources (no accidental deletions!)</li><li>Works with any CRDs in your cluster</li><li>Built-in resource discovery by API group (search \"flux\", \"argo\", etc.)</li></ul><ul><li>Safety first - Zero modification capabilities</li><li>Smart discovery - Find FluxCD, ArgoCD, Istio, etc. resources by substring</li></ul></div>   submitted by   <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/kkb0318\"> /u/kkb0318 </a>","contentLength":457,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Trying to profiling heap on macOS is frustrating...","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1lg12fm/trying_to_profiling_heap_on_macos_is_frustrating/","date":1750416996,"author":"/u/steve_lau","guid":163776,"unread":true,"content":"<div><p>Today, I was trying to investigate a memory issue that only happens on macOS.

To solve this, I sat down for several weekends and read everything I could about Makefiles. I've condensed the most critical knowledge into this guide. Each topic has a brief description and a self contained example that you can run yourself.</p><p>If you mostly understand Make, consider checking out the <a href=\"https://makefiletutorial.com/#makefile-cookbook\">Makefile Cookbook</a>, which has a template for medium sized projects with ample comments about what each part of the Makefile is doing.</p><p>Good luck, and I hope you are able to slay the confusing world of Makefiles!</p><p>Makefiles are used to help decide which parts of a large program need to be recompiled. In the vast majority of cases, C or C++ files are compiled. Other languages typically have their own tools that serve a similar purpose as Make. Make can also be used beyond compilation too, when you need a series of instructions to run depending on what files have changed. This tutorial will focus on the C/C++ compilation use case.</p><p>Here's an example dependency graph that you might build with Make. If any file's dependencies changes, then the file will get recompiled:</p><h2>What alternatives are there to Make?</h2><p>Interpreted languages like Python, Ruby, and raw Javascript don't require an analogue to Makefiles. The goal of Makefiles is to compile whatever files need to be compiled, based on what files have changed. But when files in interpreted languages change, nothing needs to get recompiled. When the program runs, the most recent version of the file is used.</p><h2>The versions and types of Make</h2><p>There are a variety of implementations of Make, but most of this guide will work on whatever version you're using. However, it's specifically written for GNU Make, which is the standard implementation on Linux and MacOS. All the examples work for Make versions 3 and 4, which are nearly equivalent other than some esoteric differences.</p><p>To run these examples, you'll need a terminal and \"make\" installed. For each example, put the contents in a file called , and in that directory run the command . Let's start with the simplest of Makefiles:</p><blockquote><p>Note: Makefiles  be indented using TABs and not spaces or  will fail.</p></blockquote><p>Here is the output of running the above example:</p><pre><code>\necho \"Hello, World\"\nHello, World</code></pre><p>That's it! If you're a bit confused, here's a video that goes through these steps, along with describing the basic structure of Makefiles.</p><p>A Makefile consists of a set of . A rule generally looks like this:</p><pre><code>\n\tcommand\n\tcommand\n\tcommand</code></pre><ul><li>The  are file names, separated by spaces. Typically, there is only one per rule.</li><li>The  are a series of steps typically used to make the target(s). These <em>need to start with a tab character</em>, not spaces.</li><li>The  are also file names, separated by spaces. These files need to exist before the commands for the target are run. These are also called </li></ul><p>Let's start with a hello world example:</p><pre><code>\n\techo \n\techo </code></pre><p>There's already a lot to take in here. Let's break it down:</p><ul><li>We have one  called </li><li>This target has two </li><li>This target has no </li></ul><p>We'll then run . As long as the  file does not exist, the commands will run. If  does exist, no commands will run.</p><p>It's important to realize that I'm talking about  as both a  and a . That's because the two are directly tied together. Typically, when a target is run (aka when the commands of a target are run), the commands will create a file with the same name as the target. In this case, the  does not create the .</p><p>Let's create a more typical Makefile - one that compiles a single C file. But before we do, make a file called  that has the following contents:</p><p>Then create the Makefile (called , as always):</p><p>This time, try simply running . Since there's no target supplied as an argument to the  command, the first target is run. In this case, there's only one target (). The first time you run this,  will be created. The second time, you'll see <code>make: 'blah' is up to date</code>. That's because the  file already exists. But there's a problem: if we modify  and then run , nothing gets recompiled.</p><p>We solve this by adding a prerequisite:</p><pre><code>\n\tcc blah.c -o blah</code></pre><p>When we run  again, the following set of steps happens:</p><ul><li>The first target is selected, because the first target is the default target</li><li>This has a prerequisite of </li><li>Make decides if it should run the  target. It will only run if  doesn't exist, or  is </li></ul><p>This last step is critical, and is the . What it's attempting to do is decide if the prerequisites of  have changed since  was last compiled. That is, if  is modified, running  should recompile the file. And conversely, if  has not changed, then it should not be recompiled.</p><p>To make this happen, it uses the filesystem timestamps as a proxy to determine if something has changed. This is a reasonable heuristic, because file timestamps typically will only change if the files are\nmodified. But it's important to realize that this isn't always the case. You could, for example, modify a file, and then change the modified timestamp of that file to something old. If you did, Make would incorrectly guess that the file hadn't changed and thus could be ignored.</p><p>Whew, what a mouthful. <strong>Make sure that you understand this. It's the crux of Makefiles, and might take you a few minutes to properly understand</strong>. Play around with the above examples or watch the video above if things are still confusing.</p><p>The following Makefile ultimately runs all three targets. When you run  in the terminal, it will build a program called  in a series of steps:</p><ul><li>Make selects the target , because the first target is the default target</li><li> requires , so make searches for the  target</li><li> requires , so make searches for the  target</li><li> has no dependencies, so the  command is run</li><li>The  command is then run, because all of the  dependencies are finished</li><li>The top  command is run, because all the  dependencies are finished</li><li>That's it:  is a compiled c program</li></ul><pre><code>\n\tcc blah.o -o blah \n\tcc -c blah.c -o blah.o \n\techo  &gt; blah.c </code></pre><p>If you delete , all three targets will be rerun. If you edit it (and thus change the timestamp to newer than ), the first two targets will run. If you run  (and thus change the timestamp to newer than ), then only the first target will run. If you change nothing, none of the targets will run. Try it out!</p><p>This next example doesn't do anything new, but is nontheless a good additional example. It will always run both targets, because  depends on , which is never created.</p><pre><code>\n\techo \n\ttouch some_file\n\n\n\techo </code></pre><p> is often used as a target that removes the output of other targets, but it is not a special word in Make. You can run  and  on this to create and delete .</p><p>Note that  is doing two new things here:</p><ul><li>It's a target that is not first (the default), and not a prerequisite. That means it'll never run unless you explicitly call </li><li>It's not intended to be a filename. If you happen to have a file named , this target won't run, which is not what we want.

In this example, the two commands behave the same:</p><pre><code>a := one two\nb := 'one two' \n\tprintf '$a'\n\tprintf $b</code></pre><p>Reference variables using either  or </p><pre><code>x := dude\n\n\n\techo \n\techo ${x}\n\n\t\n\techo $x </code></pre><p>Making multiple targets and you want all of them to run? Make an  target.\nSince this is the first rule listed, it will run by default if  is called without specifying a target.</p><pre><code>\n\ttouch one\n\n\ttouch two\n\n\ttouch three\n\n\n\trm -f one two three\n</code></pre><p>When there are multiple targets for a rule, the commands will be run for each target.  is an <a href=\"https://makefiletutorial.com/#automatic-variables\">automatic variable</a> that contains the target name.</p><pre><code>\n\nf1.o f2.o:\n\techo </code></pre><p>Both  and  are called wildcards in Make, but they mean entirely different things.  searches your filesystem for matching filenames. I suggest that you always wrap it in the  function, because otherwise you may fall into a common pitfall described below.</p><pre><code>\n\tls -la  </code></pre><p> may be used in the target, prerequisites, or in the  function.</p><p>Danger:  may not be directly used in a variable definitions</p><p>Danger: When  matches no files, it is left as it is (unless run in the  function)</p><pre><code>thing_wrong := *.o \nthing_right := </code></pre><p> is really useful, but is somewhat confusing because of the variety of situations it can be used in.</p><ul><li>When used in \"matching\" mode, it matches one or more characters in a string. This match is called the stem.</li><li>When used in \"replacing\" mode, it takes the stem that was matched and replaces that in a string.</li><li> is most often used in rule definitions and in some specific functions.</li></ul><p>See these sections on examples of it being used:</p><pre><code>\n\techo \n\techo \n\techo \n\techo \n\n\ttouch hey\n\n\n\ttouch one\n\n\n\ttouch two\n\n\n\trm -f hey one two\n</code></pre><p>Make loves c compilation. And every time it expresses its love, things get confusing. Perhaps the most confusing part of Make is the magic/automatic rules that are made. Make calls these \"implicit\" rules. I don't personally agree with this design decision, and I don't recommend using them, but they're often used and are thus useful to know. Here's a list of implicit rules:</p><ul><li>Compiling a C program:  is made automatically from  with a command of the form <code>$(CC) -c $(CPPFLAGS) $(CFLAGS) $^ -o $@</code></li><li>Compiling a C++ program:  is made automatically from  or  with a command of the form <code>$(CXX) -c $(CPPFLAGS) $(CXXFLAGS) $^ -o $@</code></li><li>Linking a single object file:  is made automatically from  by running the command <code>$(CC) $(LDFLAGS) $^ $(LOADLIBES) $(LDLIBS) -o $@</code></li></ul><p>The important variables used by implicit rules are:</p><ul><li>: Program for compiling C programs; default </li><li>: Program for compiling C++ programs; default </li><li>: Extra flags to give to the C compiler</li><li>: Extra flags to give to the C++ compiler</li><li>: Extra flags to give to the C preprocessor</li><li>: Extra flags to give to compilers when they are supposed to invoke the linker</li></ul><p>Let's see how we can now build a C program without ever explicitly telling Make how to do the compilation:</p><pre><code>CC = gcc \nCFLAGS = -g \n\techo  &gt; blah.c\n\n\n\trm -f blah*</code></pre><p>Static pattern rules are another way to write less in a Makefile. Here's their syntax:</p><pre><code>\n   commands</code></pre><p>The essence is that the given  is matched by the  (via a  wildcard). Whatever was matched is called the . The stem is then substituted into the , to generate the target's prereqs.</p><p>A typical use case is to compile  files into  files. Here's the :</p><pre><code>objects = foo.o bar.o all.o\n -o all\n\n -c foo.c -o foo.o\n\n -c bar.c -o bar.o\n\n -c all.c -o all.o\n\n\n\techo  &gt; all.c\n\n\n\ttouch \n\trm -f *.c *.o all</code></pre><p>Here's the more , using a static pattern rule:</p><pre><code>objects = foo.o bar.o all.o\n -o all\n\n: %.o: %.c\n\t -c  -o \n\techo  &gt; all.c\n\n\n\ttouch \n\trm -f *.c *.o all</code></pre><h2>Static Pattern Rules and Filter</h2><p>While I introduce the <a href=\"https://makefiletutorial.com/#the-filter-function\">filter function</a> later on, it's common to use in static pattern rules, so I'll mention that here. The  function can be used in Static pattern rules to match the correct files. In this example, I made up the  and  extensions.</p><pre><code>obj_files = foo.result bar.o lose.o\nsrc_files = foo.raw bar.c lose.c\n\n: %.o: %.c\n\techo : %.result: %.raw\n\techo  \n\n%.c %.raw:\n\ttouch \n\trm -f </code></pre><p>Pattern rules are often used but quite confusing. You can look at them as two ways:</p><ul><li>A way to define your own implicit rules</li><li>A simpler form of static pattern rules</li></ul><p>Let's start with an example first:</p><pre><code>\n%.o : %.c\n\t\t -c  -o </code></pre><p>Pattern rules contain a '%' in the target. This '%' matches any nonempty string, and the other characters match themselves. ‘%’ in a prerequisite of a pattern rule stands for the same stem that was matched by the ‘%’ in the target.</p><p>Double-Colon Rules are rarely used, but allow multiple rules to be defined for the same target. If these were single colons, a warning would be printed and only the second set of commands would run.</p><pre><code>\n\techo \n\techo </code></pre><p>Add an  before a command to stop it from being printedYou can also run make with  to add an  before each line  </p><pre><code>\n\t@echo \n\techo </code></pre><p>Each command is run in a new shell (or at least the effect is as such)</p><pre><code>\n\tcd ..\n\t\n\techo `pwd`\n\n\t\n\tcd ..;echo `pwd`\n\n\t\n\tcd ..; \\\n\techo `pwd`\n</code></pre><p>The default shell is . You can change this by changing the variable SHELL:</p><pre><code>SHELL=/bin/bash\n\n\n\techo </code></pre><p>If you want a string to have a dollar sign, you can use . This is how to use a shell variable in  or .</p><p>Note the differences between Makefile variables and Shell variables in this next example.</p><pre><code>make_var = I am a make variable\n\n\tsh_var='I am a shell variable'; echo $$sh_var\n\n\t\n\techo </code></pre><h2>Error handling with , , and </h2><p>Add  when running make to continue running even in the face of errors. Helpful if you want to see all the errors of Make at once.Add a  before a command to suppress the errorAdd  to make to have this happen for every command.</p><h2>Interrupting or killing make</h2><p>Note only: If you  make, it will delete the newer targets it just made.</p><p>To recursively call a makefile, use the special  instead of  because it will pass the make flags for you and won't itself be affected by them.</p><pre><code>new_contents = \n\tmkdir -p subdir\n\tprintf  | sed -e 's/^ //' &gt; subdir/makefile\n\tcd subdir &amp;&amp; \n\trm -rf subdir\n</code></pre><h2>Export, environments, and recursive make</h2><p>When Make starts, it automatically creates Make variables out of all the environment variables that are set when it's executed.</p><pre><code>\n\techo $$shell_env_var\n\n\t\n\techo </code></pre><p>The  directive takes a variable and sets it the environment for all shell commands in all the recipes:</p><pre><code>shell_env_var=Shell env var, created inside of Make\n shell_env_var\n\n\techo \n\techo $$shell_env_var</code></pre><p>As such, when you run the  command inside of make, you can use the  directive to make it accessible to sub-make commands.

You \"define\" the function just by creating a variable, but use the parameters , , etc. You then call the function with the special <a href=\"https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/html_node/Call-Function.html#Call-Function\"></a> builtin function. The syntax is <code>$(call variable,param,param)</code>.  is the variable, while , , etc. are the params.</p><pre><code>sweet_new_fn = Variable Name: $(0) First: $(1) Second: $(2) Empty Variable: $(3)\n\n\n\t@echo </code></pre><p>shell - This calls the shell, but it replaces newlines with spaces!</p><p>The  function is used to select certain elements from a list that match a specific pattern.

For example, <code>$(filter %.c %.h, $(files))</code> will select all  and  files from the files list.</p></li><li><p>: If you want to select all elements that do not match a pattern, you can use . For example, <code>$(filter-out %.h, $(files))</code> will select all files that are not  files.</p></li><li><p>: You can nest filter functions to apply multiple filters. For example, <code>$(filter %.o, $(filter-out test%, $(objects)))</code> will select all object files that end with  but don't start with .</p></li></ol><p>The include directive tells make to read one or more other makefiles. It's a line in the makefile that looks like this:</p><p>This is particularly useful when you use compiler flags like  that create Makefiles based on the source.

In this example, if the file  is created, make clean will still be run. Technically, I should have used it in every example with  or , but I wanted to keep the examples clean. Additionally, \"phony\" targets typically have names that are rarely file names, and in practice many people skip this.</p><pre><code>\n\ttouch some_file\n\ttouch clean\n\n\n\trm -f some_file\n\trm -f clean</code></pre><p>The make tool will stop running a rule (and will propogate back to prerequisites) if a command returns a nonzero exit status. will delete the target of a rule if the rule fails in this manner.

The project overlaps somewhat\nwith the goals of the <a href=\"https://rust-for-linux.com/\">Rust for Linux\nproject</a>, but approaches the problem space from a different direction by\ntrying to get the best from both monolithic and microkernel designs.\n\n<p>\nTraditionally, monolithic kernels lump everything into one kernel-mode\naddress space, whereas microkernels only implement a minimal <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trusted_computing_base\">trusted\ncomputing base (TCB)</a> in kernel space and rely on user-mode services for\nmuch of the operating system's functionality.  This separation implies the\nuse of interprocess communication (IPC) between the microkernel and those\nservices. This IPC often has a performance impact, which is a big part of\nwhy microkernels have remained relatively unpopular.\n\n</p><p>\nThe core of Asterinas's \"framekernel\" design is the encapsulation of all\ncode that needs Rust's  features inside a library, enabling\nthe rest of the kernel (the services) to be developed using safe\nabstractions.  Those services remain within the kernel's address space, but\nonly have access to the resources that the core library gives to them.\nThis design is meant to improve the safety of the system while retaining\nthe simple and performant shared-memory architecture of monolithic\nkernels. The <a href=\"https://asterinas.github.io/book/\">Asterinas book</a>\non the project's website provides a nice <a href=\"https://asterinas.github.io/book/kernel/the-framekernel-architecture.html\">\narchitectural mission statement and overview</a>.\n\n\n</p><p>\nThe aptness of the \"framekernel\" nomenclature can perhaps be debated.  The\nframe part refers to the development framework wrapping the unsafe\nparts behind a memory-safe API.  The concept of the TCB is, of\ncourse, not exclusive to microkernel architectures but, because there are\nstrong incentives to strictly scrutinize and, in some contexts, even <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_verification\">formally\nverify</a> the TCB of a system, keeping the TCB as small as possible is a\ncentral aspect of microkernel designs.\n\n\n</p><p>\nAn update on the project is available on the Asterinas blog in the\nJune&nbsp;4 post titled \"<a href=\"https://asterinas.github.io/2025/06/04/kernel-memory-safety-mission-accomplished.html\">Kernel\nMemory Safety: Mission Accomplished</a>\".  The post explains the team's\nmotivations and the need for the industry to address memory-safety\nproblems; it provides some illustrations that explain how the framekernel\nis different from monolithic kernels and microkernels. It also takes a\nmoment to emphasize that the benefits of Rust don't stop with memory\nsafety; there are improvements to <a href=\"https://jacko.io/safety_and_soundness.html\">soundness</a> as well.\nPerhaps most importantly, the post highlights the upcoming Asterinas\npresentation at the <a href=\"https://www.usenix.org/conference/atc25/technical-sessions\">2025\nUSENIX Annual Technical Conference</a>.\n</p><p>\nIn their paper, the authors compare Asterinas to some prior Rust-based\noperating-system work, exploring the benefits of the language's\nmemory-safety features and explain how Asterinas differs from that previous\nwork.  Specifically, the paper contrasts Asterinas with <a href=\"https://www.usenix.org/conference/osdi20/presentation/narayanan-vikram\">\nRedLeaf</a>, an operating system written in Rust and presented at the 14th\nUSENIX Symposium on Operating Systems Design and Implementation (OSDI 20)\nin 2020.  Asterinas uses hardware isolation to permit running user-space\nprograms written in any programming language, aims to be general-purpose,\nand provides a Linux-compatible ABI, while RedLeaf is a microkernel that is\ndesigned  to use the hardware's isolation features, and the\nproject focuses on different things.\n</p><p>\nAnother project of interest is <a href=\"https://tockos.org/\">Tock</a>, an\nembedded system that targets SoCs with limited hardware protection\nfunctionality. Like Asterinas, Tock also divides the kernel into a\ntrusted core allowed to use  and untrusted \"capsules\" that\nare not.  As mentioned, Asterinas does rely on hardware protection and\nisn't intended for strictly embedded use, which differentiates it from\nTock.\n\n\n</p><p>\nIt bears mentioning that the Rust for Linux project, which is introducing\nRust code into the upstream Linux kernel, has similar goals as\nAsterinas. It also aims to encapsulate kernel interfaces with safe\nabstractions in such a way that drivers can be written in Rust without any\nneed for .\n\n\n</p><h4>Work toward formal verification</h4><p>\nOne goal of shrinking the TCB of an operating system is to make it feasible\nto have it formally verified.  In February 2025, the Asterinas blog\nfeatured <a href=\"https://asterinas.github.io/2025/02/13/towards-practical-formal-verification-for-a-general-purpose-os-in-rust.html\">a\npost detailing plans to do just that</a>.  The best known formally verified\nkernel is <a href=\"https://sel4.systems/About/\">seL4</a>, an L4-family\nmicrokernel.\n\n</p><p>\nAsterinas aims to use the framekernel approach to achieve a system that has\na small, formally verified TCB akin to a lean microkernel, but also a\nsimple shared-memory architecture with Linux ABI compatibility, all at the\nsame time.  This is a radical departure from any previously formally\nverified kernel; the blog post describes those kernels as deliberately\nsmall and limited compared to \"<q>full-fledged, UNIX-style OSes</q>\".\n\n\n</p><p>\nThe Asterinas project is collaborating with a security-auditing company\ncalled <a href=\"https://www.certik.com/\">CertiK</a> to use <a href=\"https://github.com/verus-lang/verus\">Verus</a> to formally verify the\nkernel.  There is an extensive <a href=\"https://github.com/asterinas/slides/blob/f62c764ea9c4831a747dbe8fa415b56e48493482/slides/2025-01-28%20Asterinas%20Security%20Assessment%20by%20CertiK.pdf\">\nreport</a> available from CertiK on how Asterinas was audited and the\nissues that were found.\n\n\n</p><p>\nThe Asterinas kernel is only one result of the project. The other two are\n<a href=\"https://crates.io/crates/ostd\">OSTD</a>, described as \"<q>a Rust\nOS framework that facilitates the development of and innovation in OS\nkernels written in Rust</q>\", and <a href=\"https://asterinas.github.io/book/osdk/guide/index.html\">OSDK</a>, a\nCargo addon to assist with the development, building, and testing of\nkernels based on OSTD.\n\n\n</p><p>\nThere are four stated goals for OSTD as a separate crate. One is to lower\nthe entry bar for operating-system innovation and to lay the groundwork for\nnewcomers to operating-system development. The second is to enhance memory\nsafety for operating systems written in Rust; other projects can benefit\nfrom its encapsulation and abstraction of low-level operations. The third is\nto promote code reuse across Rust-based operating-system projects. The\nfourth is to boost productivity by enabling testing of new code in user\nmode, allowing developers to iterate without having to reboot.\n\n\n</p><p>\nIt is worth emphasizing that the kernels that can be written with OSTD do\nnot have to be Linux-compatible or, in any way, Unix-like. The APIs\nprovided are more generic than that; they are memory-safe abstractions for\nfunctionality like x86 hardware management, booting, virtual memory, SMP,\ntasks, users, and timers.  Like most Rust crates, OSTD is <a href=\"https://docs.rs/ostd/0.14.1/ostd/index.html\">documented on\ndocs.rs</a>.\n\n\n</p><p>\nAsterinas reports Intel, among others, as a sponsor of the project.\nIntel's interest is likely related to its <a href=\"https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/tools/trust-domain-extensions/overview.html\">Trust\nDomain Extensions (TDX)</a> feature, which provides hardware modes and\nfeatures to facilitate isolation of virtual machines, and memory\nencryption.  The Asterinas book has a brief <a href=\"https://asterinas.github.io/book/osdk/guide/intel-tdx.html\">section\non TDX</a>, and the OSDK supports it.\n\n\n</p><p>\nThe OSTD, or at least the parts that Asterinas ends up using, seems to\nessentially be the restricted TCB that allows . For an\nillustrative example, we could take a look at the  kernel\ncomponent's <a href=\"https://github.com/asterinas/asterinas/blob/ecb33ca98d2b2ac680daf1d2a48e4d011db2fbcf/kernel/comps/network/src/buffer.rs\">source\ncode</a> and see that the buffer code uses DMA, locking, allocation, and\nvirtual-memory code from the OSTD through memory-safe APIs.\n\n\n</p><p>\nAsterinas was first released under the Mozilla Public License in early\n2024; it has undergone rapid development over the past year.  GitHub <a href=\"https://github.com/asterinas/asterinas/graphs/contributors\">lists 45\nindividual committers</a>, but the majority of the commits are from a\nhandful of PhD students from the Southern University of Science and\nTechnology, Peking University, and Fudan University, as well as a Chinese\ncompany called <a href=\"https://www.antgroup.com/en\">Ant Group</a>, which\nis a sponsor of Asterinas.\n\n</p><p>\nAt the time of writing, Asterinas supports two architectures, x86 and RISC-V.\nIn the January blog post linked above, it was reported that Asterinas\nsupported 180 Linux system calls, but the number has since grown to <a href=\"https://github.com/asterinas/asterinas/blob/1fe0fef41003c824b780b7b228f7b01a46497be0/kernel/src/syscall/arch/x86.rs\">206\non x86</a>.  As of version 6.7, Linux has 368 system calls in total, so there is\nsome way to go yet.\n\n\n</p><p>\nOverall, Asterinas is in early development. There have been no releases,\nrelease announcements, changelogs, or much of anything other than Git tags\nand a short installation guide in the documentation.  The <a href=\"https://crates.io/crates/ostd/reverse_dependencies\">Dependents\ntab</a> of the OSTD crate on crates.io shows that no unrelated, published\ncrate yet uses OSTD.\n\n\n</p><p>\nIt does not seem like Asterinas is able to run any applications yet.  <a href=\"https://github.com/asterinas/asterinas/issues/1868\">Issue #1868</a>\nin Asterinas's repository outlines preliminary plans toward a first\ndistribution.  The initial focus on a custom initramfs and some rudimentary\nuser-space applications, followed by being able to <a href=\"https://github.com/asterinas/asterinas/issues/1851\">run\nDocker</a>. There are initial plans to bootstrap a distribution based on\nNix. Notably (but unsurprisingly), this issue mentions that Asterinas\ndoesn't support loading Linux kernel modules, nor does it ever\nplan to.\n\n\n</p><p>\nThe <a href=\"https://asterinas.github.io/book/kernel/roadmap.html\">Roadmap</a>\nsection of the Asterinas book says that the near-term goals are to expand\nthe support for CPU architectures and hardware, as well as to focus on\nreal-world usability in the cloud by providing a host OS for virtual\nmachines.  Apparently, the support for Linux virtio devices is already\nthere, so a major hurdle has already been cleared.  In particular, the\nChinese cloud market, in the form of Aliyun (also known as Alibaba Cloud)\n<a href=\"https://github.com/asterinas/asterinas/issues/1501\">is a\nfocus</a>.  The primary plans involve creating a container host OS with a\ntight, formally verified TCB and support for some trusted-computing\nfeatures in Intel hardware, for the Chinese cloud service.\n\n\n</p><p>\nWhile both Rust for Linux and Asterinas have similar goals (providing a\nsafer kernel by relying on Rust's memory safety), their scopes and\napproaches are different.  Rust for Linux focuses on safe abstractions\nstrictly for new device drivers to be written in safe Rust, but this leaves\nthe rest of the kernel untouched.\nAsterinas, on the other hand, aims to build a whole new kernel from the ground\nup, restricting the -permitting core to the absolute minimum,\nwhich can then be formally verified.  Asterinas also focuses on\ncontainers and cloud computing, at least for now, while Rust for Linux looks to\nbenefit the whole of the Linux ecosystem.\n\n\n</p><p>\nDespite the stated cloud focus, there is more going on, for example building\nsupport for <a href=\"https://github.com/asterinas/asterinas/issues/2008\">X11</a>\nand <a href=\"https://github.com/asterinas/asterinas/issues/2112\">Xfce</a>.\nAlso, the OSTD could, of course, prove interesting for OS development\nenthusiasts irrespective of the Asterinas project, but so far it remains unknown\nand untested by a wider audience.\n\n</p><p>\nAsterinas is certainly a refreshingly innovative take on principles for\noperating-system development, leaning on the safety and soundness\nfoundations provided by the Rust language and compiler. So far it is at an\nearly exploratory stage driven by enthusiastic Chinese researchers and\ndoesn't see any serious practical use, but it is worth keeping an eye\non. It will be interesting to see the reception it will get from the\nRust for Linux team and the Linux community at large.</p>","contentLength":10809,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1lfzw9v/lwn_asterinas_a_new_linuxcompatible_kernel_project/"},{"title":"France quietly deployed 100,000+ Linux machines in their police force - GendBuntu is a silent EU tech success story","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/1lfyybb/france_quietly_deployed_100000_linux_machines_in/","date":1750408737,"author":"/u/AnonomousWolf","guid":163379,"unread":true,"content":"","contentLength":0,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Kube Composer open source project to generate and visualize kubernetes configuration.","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/kubernetes/comments/1lfyxmf/kube_composer_open_source_project_to_generate_and/","date":1750408658,"author":"/u/same7ammar","guid":163448,"unread":true,"content":"   submitted by   <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/same7ammar\"> /u/same7ammar </a>","contentLength":33,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Preserving JSON key order while removing fields","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1lfytjc/preserving_json_key_order_while_removing_fields/","date":1750408195,"author":"/u/lakkiy_","guid":163779,"unread":true,"content":"<p>I had a specific problem recently: when validating request signatures, I needed to remove certain fields from JSON (like signature, timestamp) but preserve the original key order for consistent hash generation.</p><p>So I wrote a small (~90 lines) ordered JSON handler that maintains key insertion order while allowing field deletion.</p><p>Nothing groundbreaking, but solved my exact use case.

A design meeting can stall on the meanings of \"always\" or \"only if\". These problems stem from ambiguity. Clear language prevents them.</p><p>Propositional logic is a system for clear expression. It is a tool for precise thought. It helps you write better code and build stronger arguments. This guide explains propositional logic from its foundations. It is a practical manual for developers, engineers, and builders.</p><h2>The Foundations of Reasoning<a aria-hidden=\"true\" tabindex=\"-1\" href=\"https://beyondit.blog/blogs/DSA-Fundamentals-1-A-Practical-Guide-to-Propositional-Logic#the-foundations-of-reasoning\"></a></h2><p>First, we must understand the core ideas of logic. We will look at its basic unit and the history of its creation.</p><h3>The World of Propositions<a aria-hidden=\"true\" tabindex=\"-1\" href=\"https://beyondit.blog/blogs/DSA-Fundamentals-1-A-Practical-Guide-to-Propositional-Logic#the-world-of-propositions\"></a></h3><p>Logic is built on a simple concept: the proposition. A proposition is a statement that is either  or . It cannot be both. It cannot be neither. This binary classification is the starting point for all formal reasoning.</p><p>You must learn to identify a proposition. Here are some examples:</p><ul><li><p>\"Paris is the capital of France.\" (True)</p></li><li><p>\"The Earth is a cube.\" (False)</p></li></ul><p>Each statement makes a claim. The claim can be verified as true or false.</p><p>It is also important to know what is not a proposition. Logic gains power by excluding unclear sentences. The following sentence types are outside its scope:</p><ul><li><p> \"Do your homework.\" This is an instruction. It is not true or false.</p></li><li><p> \"What is the weather like?\" This sentence asks for information. It does not declare a fact.</p></li><li><p>. The truth of this statement depends on the value of . It has no definite truth value.</p></li><li><p> \"This statement is false.\" The sentence contradicts itself. It has no stable truth value.</p></li></ul><p>Propositional logic treats these simple propositions as indivisible units. It studies the rules for combining these units into more complex statements. This system exchanges the nuance of natural language for analytical power. This precision makes logic the natural language of computers, which are built on the binary states of 0 and 1.</p><p>The effort to formalize reason is ancient. The system we use today is the product of a specific history. This history explains why its rules are structured the way they are.</p><p>The earliest formal logic came from ancient Greece. The philosopher Aristotle is often called the \"father of logic.\" His system categorized valid argument forms called syllogisms. The Stoic school of philosophy came later. The Stoics studied the connectors that join simple propositions. These include \"and,\" \"or,\" and \"if...then...\" constructions. They saw that a compound statement's truth value depends on its parts and the connector used. This idea is now called truth-functionality.</p><p>Logic remained a part of philosophy for many centuries. A major change happened in the mid-19th century with the work of George Boole. Boole was an English mathematician. He realized that logical reasoning could be represented with a formal algebraic system. He introduced a new type of algebra, now called Boolean Algebra. It was designed to model logic.</p><p>Boole's work was transformative. It provided a general method that could be applied to many arguments. His work gave logic a mathematical foundation. The German logician Gottlob Frege later developed the first formal axiomatic system for logic. Frege's work solidified logic's place as a mathematical discipline.</p><p>This history shows the structural similarities between logic and algebra are not a coincidence. They are the result of Boole's work. The system of propositional logic is a coherent analytical tool. It was created at the intersection of philosophy and mathematics. This history prepared logic for its role as the language of the digital age.</p><h2>The Mechanics of Propositional Logic<a aria-hidden=\"true\" tabindex=\"-1\" href=\"https://beyondit.blog/blogs/DSA-Fundamentals-1-A-Practical-Guide-to-Propositional-Logic#the-mechanics-of-propositional-logic\"></a></h2><p>We now turn to the practical mechanics of the system. This part introduces the formal language and the main analytical tool: the truth table.</p><h3>The Language of Logic: Symbols and Connectives<a aria-hidden=\"true\" tabindex=\"-1\" href=\"https://beyondit.blog/blogs/DSA-Fundamentals-1-A-Practical-Guide-to-Propositional-Logic#the-language-of-logic-symbols-and-connectives\"></a></h3><p>Propositional logic has a precise syntax. It has an alphabet and rules for combining symbols.</p><p>The alphabet has two main types of symbols:</p><ul><li><p> These are letters like , , and . They stand for simple, atomic propositions. For example,  can represent \"It is raining.\"</p></li><li><p> These are operators that form complex propositions. There are five standard connectives.</p></li></ul><table><tbody><tr></tr></tbody></table><p>We use these parts to construct <strong>well-formed formulas (WFFs)</strong>. The rules for forming WFFs are simple:</p><ol><li><p>Any atomic propositional variable is a WFF.</p></li><li><p>If  is a WFF, then  is a WFF.</p></li><li><p>If  and  are WFFs, then , , , and  are WFFs.</p></li></ol><p>This definition allows us to build formulas of any complexity. Parentheses show the structure and order of operations.</p><h3>Unveiling Truth with Truth Tables<a aria-hidden=\"true\" tabindex=\"-1\" href=\"https://beyondit.blog/blogs/DSA-Fundamentals-1-A-Practical-Guide-to-Propositional-Logic#unveiling-truth-with-truth-tables\"></a></h3><p>The syntax of logic tells us how to build formulas. The semantics tell us what they mean. The main tool for finding a formula's meaning is the . A truth table lists every possible combination of truth values for the atomic propositions. It shows the resulting truth value of the whole formula for each combination.</p><p>Constructing a truth table is a systematic process:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Determine the Number of Rows:</strong> A formula with  distinct variables has  possible combinations of truth values. The table needs  rows. A formula with , , and  needs  rows.</p></li><li><p><strong>Establish Initial Columns:</strong> Create a column for each atomic variable.</p></li><li><p><strong>List All Truth Assignments:</strong> List the truth assignments in a consistent pattern. A common method is to count in binary.</p></li><li><p> Work from the inside out. Create a new column for each logical operation. The standard order of precedence is: Parentheses, Negation, Conjunction/Disjunction, Conditional, and Biconditional.</p></li></ol><p>This next table is the most important reference. It defines the five standard connectives.</p><table><thead><tr></tr></thead><tbody></tbody></table><ul><li><p>: Inverts the truth value of its operand.</p></li><li><p>: Is true only when both  and  are true.</p></li><li><p>: Is true if at least one of  or  is true. It is false only when both are false.</p></li><li><p>: Is false only when the antecedent  is true and the consequent  is false.</p></li><li><p>: Is true only when  and  have the same truth value.</p></li></ul><p>You must learn these definitions. All other concepts are derived from these truth-functional meanings.</p><h3>From English to Symbols: The Art of Translation<a aria-hidden=\"true\" tabindex=\"-1\" href=\"https://beyondit.blog/blogs/DSA-Fundamentals-1-A-Practical-Guide-to-Propositional-Logic#from-english-to-symbols-the-art-of-translation\"></a></h3><p>A critical skill is translating natural language into propositional logic. This process requires you to identify atomic propositions and the logical structure.</p><p>First, break down a complex sentence into its simplest parts. Assign a propositional variable to each part. In the sentence \"If the weather remains mild and there is no frost, then there will be a good harvest,\" we can identify three atomic propositions:</p><ul><li><p>: \"The weather remains mild.\"</p></li><li><p>: \"There will be a good harvest.\"</p></li></ul><p>Second, identify the logical connectives. English has many ways to express logical relationships. Here are common translations:</p><ul><li><p>: \"and,\" \"but,\" \"moreover\"</p></li><li><p>: \"or,\" \"unless\"</p></li><li><p>: \"not,\" \"it is not the case that\"</p></li><li><p>: \"if...then,\" \"implies,\" \"is a sufficient condition for,\" \"is a necessary condition for\" (reversed), \"only if\"</p></li><li><p>: \"if and only if,\" \"is a necessary and sufficient condition for\"</p></li></ul><p>Mastering this translation process lets you restate a complex argument as a formal structure. Then it is ready for rigorous analysis.</p><h2>Analysis, Equivalence, and Inference<a aria-hidden=\"true\" tabindex=\"-1\" href=\"https://beyondit.blog/blogs/DSA-Fundamentals-1-A-Practical-Guide-to-Propositional-Logic#analysis-equivalence-and-inference\"></a></h2><p>Once a proposition is constructed, we can analyze its properties. This part explains how to analyze formulas, simplify them, and use them to construct valid arguments.</p><p>The final column of a truth table allows us to classify any formula into one of three categories.</p><ul><li><p>: A proposition that is always true. The final column of its truth table contains only 'T's. An example is .</p></li><li><p>: A proposition that is always false. The final column of its truth table contains only 'F's. An example is .</p></li><li><p>: A proposition that is neither a tautology nor a contradiction. Its truth value depends on its atomic components. The final column has a mix of 'T's and 'F's.</p></li></ul><p>Understanding these categories is important. Tautologies represent logical truths. Identifying contradictions helps find inconsistent premises.</p><h3>Logical Equivalence and Simplification<a aria-hidden=\"true\" tabindex=\"-1\" href=\"https://beyondit.blog/blogs/DSA-Fundamentals-1-A-Practical-Guide-to-Propositional-Logic#logical-equivalence-and-simplification\"></a></h3><p>Two propositional formulas are logically equivalent if they have the exact same truth table. We denote this with the symbol .</p><p>Logical equivalence is a useful concept. It provides rules to manipulate and simplify logical expressions without a full truth table. These rules are themselves tautologies of the form .</p><p>This table presents the most important logical equivalences.</p><table><thead><tr></tr></thead><tbody><tr></tr><tr><td><code>(p ∨ q) ∨ r ≡ p ∨ (q ∨ r)</code></td><td><code>(p ∧ q) ∧ r ≡ p ∧ (q ∧ r)</code></td></tr><tr><td><code>p ∨ (q ∧ r) ≡ (p ∨ q) ∧ (p ∨ r)</code></td><td><code>p ∧ (q ∨ r) ≡ (p ∧ q) ∨ (p ∧ r)</code></td></tr><tr></tr><tr></tr><tr><td> (Contrapositive)</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Some equivalences are very common:</p><ul><li><p> provide rules for negating conjunctions and disjunctions.</p></li><li><p> () allows us to translate any conditional statement into an expression with only negation and disjunction.</p></li><li><p> () is a powerful tool in mathematical proofs. Proving the contrapositive is often more direct than proving the original statement.</p></li></ul><h3>The Art of Deduction: Rules of Inference<a aria-hidden=\"true\" tabindex=\"-1\" href=\"https://beyondit.blog/blogs/DSA-Fundamentals-1-A-Practical-Guide-to-Propositional-Logic#the-art-of-deduction-rules-of-inference\"></a></h3><p>Truth tables can become too large for complex arguments. So, we use . Inference is the process of deriving a conclusion from premises through a sequence of small, valid steps.</p><p>An argument is  if it is impossible for all its premises to be true and its conclusion false. The  are simple, valid argument forms. They are building blocks for more complex proofs.</p><p>This table outlines the most essential rules of inference.</p><table><tbody><tr></tr><tr></tr><tr><td><strong>Hypothetical Syllogism (HS)</strong></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Disjunctive Syllogism (DS)</strong></td></tr><tr></tr><tr></tr></tbody></table><p>A formal proof is a sequence of formulas where each formula is a premise or follows from previous formulas by a rule of inference. This method provides a scalable way to establish logical validity.</p><p>We now move to more advanced topics. This part explores the complexities of the conditional, normal forms, and the connection between logic and computation.</p><h3>The Nuances of the Conditional<a aria-hidden=\"true\" tabindex=\"-1\" href=\"https://beyondit.blog/blogs/DSA-Fundamentals-1-A-Practical-Guide-to-Propositional-Logic#the-nuances-of-the-conditional\"></a></h3><p>The material conditional () can be challenging. Its formal definition can lead to conclusions that seem counter-intuitive in natural language.</p><p>The definition gives rise to two apparent paradoxes:</p><ol><li><p>A false antecedent implies any proposition. The formula  is a tautology. \"If the moon is made of green cheese, then the sky is blue,\" is a logically true statement.</p></li><li><p>A true consequent is implied by any proposition. The formula  is a tautology. \"If it is raining, then 2+2=4,\" is a logically true statement.</p></li></ol><p>The solution to these is to understand the material conditional correctly. The formula  does not assert a causal connection between  and . The conditional makes only one claim: it is not the case that  is true and  is false.</p><p>Think of the conditional as a promise. \"If you get an A, then I will give you a dollar.\" The promise is broken only in one scenario. You get an A (antecedent is true), and I do not give you a dollar (consequent is false). In all other cases, the promise is not broken.</p><p>For many computational uses, we need to standardize formulas. These standard structures are . The two most important are Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF) and Disjunctive Normal Form (DNF).</p><p>A  is an atomic proposition or its negation.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Disjunctive Normal Form (DNF)</strong>: A formula is in DNF if it is a disjunction of one or more conjunctions of literals. It is an \"OR of ANDs\".</p></li><li><p><strong>Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF)</strong>: A formula is in CNF if it is a conjunction of one or more disjunctions of literals. It is an \"AND of ORs\".

Furthermore, the ability to analyze large sequences of data are increasingly critical. In this post, we will explore a method to compress DNA using 4-bits per nucleotide in pure Rust, that allows us to generate Complementary base pairs in its compressed form.</p><p>This technique is especially useful in DNA analytical pipelines, where performance and memory constraints are critical. By minimizing the footprint of each sequence, we simultaneously reduce storage overhead and in-memory costs, without sacrificing speed or the ability to operate directly on compressed data.</p><h3 tabindex=\"-1\">DNA Bases and IUPAC Codes </h3><p>There are <a href=\"ttps://genome.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/help/iupac.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">15 IUPAC codes</a>. The ones that most are familiar with are \"A\", \"G\", \"C\", and \"T\", representing the four standard DNA bases. However, DNA sequencing often produces ambiguous results. The remaining 11 codes are for these cases. For example, \"R\" can represent \"G\"  \"A\", while \"N\" can represent  nucleotide.</p><p>DNA bases form pairs through well-defined chemical relationships: adenine (A) pairs with thymine (T), and cytosine (C) with guanine (G). These base-pairing rules extend to IUPAC ambiguity codes, which represent sets of possible nucleotides. For instance, \"R\" (A or G) complements \"Y\" (T or C).</p><p>There are three cases where the Complement is the same code. The bases \"N\" (any base), \"S\" (G or C), and \"W\" (A or T) all Complement to their own code (e.g. S-&gt;S, because \"S\" is represented by \"G\" or \"C\").</p><p>Our compression system needs to be fast, small, and reversible.

I opted to group 4 nucleotides into a single  integer. Because 4-bit data types are still represented at the byte level in Rust, we can squeeze four nucleotide representations of DNA into a single  integer.</p><p>When a sequence has fewer than four nucleotides remaining at the end, we use the 16th reserved value as a padding indicator. These padding values are ignored during decompression.</p><h3 tabindex=\"-1\">Support for Bitwise Rotation </h3><p>To obtain support for 12 Complementations and 3 self-Complementations, we can rotate the bit two positions.</p><p>For example, \"A\" will be represented by . Rotating two bits will give us  \"T\". An additional two bit rotation will bring us back to \"A\", .</p><p>Codes that Complement themselves must be symmetric on either half of the bit mask.

I think this is what explains the curious durability of the “10x engineer” meme. It may be based on flimsy, shoddy research, and the claims people have made to defend it have often been&nbsp;risible (e.g. “10x engineers have dark backgrounds, are rarely seen doing UI work, are poor mentors and interviewers”), or blatantly double down on stereotypes (“we look for young dudes in hoodies that remind us of Mark Zuckerberg”). But damn if it doesn’t resonate with experience. It just feels true.</p><p>The problem is not the idea that there are engineers who are 10x as productive as other engineers. I don’t have a problem with this statement; in fact, that much seems self-evidently true. The problems I do have are twofold.</p><h2>Measuring productivity is fraught and imperfect</h2><p>First: how are you measuring productivity? I have a problem with the implication that there is One True Metric of productivity that you can standardize and sort people by. Consider, for a moment, the sheer combinatorial magnitude of skills and experiences at play:</p><p>Also: people and their skills and abilities are not static. At one point, I was a pretty good DBRE (I even co-wrote the book on it). Maybe I was even a 10x DB engineer then, but certainly not now. I haven’t debugged a query plan in years.</p><p>“10x engineer” makes it sound like 10x productivity is an immutable characteristic of a person. But someone who is a 10x engineer in a particular skill set is still going to have infinitely more areas where they are normal or average (or less). I know a lot of world class engineers, but I’ve never met anyone who is 10x better than everyone else across the board, in every situation.</p><h2>Engineers don’t own software, teams own software</h2><p>Second, and even more importantly: So what? It doesn’t matter. Individual engineers don’t own software, teams own software. <strong>The smallest unit of software ownership and delivery is the engineering team</strong>. It doesn’t matter how fast an individual engineer can write software, what matters is how fast the team can collectively write, test, review, ship, maintain, refactor, extend, architect, and revise the software that they own.</p><p>Everyone uses the same software delivery pipeline. If it takes the slowest engineer at your company five hours to ship a single line of code, it’s going to take the fastest engineer at your company five hours to ship a single line of code. The time spent writing code is typically dwarfed by the time spent on every other part of the software development lifecycle.</p><p>If you have services or software components that are owned by a single engineer, that person is a single point of failure.<img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" fetchpriority=\"high\" decoding=\"async\" data-attachment-id=\"10013\" data-permalink=\"https://charity.wtf/2025/06/19/in-praise-of-normal-engineers/normal-spof/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/charity.wtf/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/normal-spof.png?fit=1024%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1024,1024\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"normal-spof\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/charity.wtf/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/normal-spof.png?fit=300%2C300&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/charity.wtf/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/normal-spof.png?fit=660%2C660&amp;ssl=1\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/charity.wtf/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/normal-spof.png?resize=226%2C226&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"226\" height=\"226\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/charity.wtf/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/normal-spof.png?resize=300%2C300&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/charity.wtf/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/normal-spof.png?resize=150%2C150&amp;ssl=1 150w, https://i0.wp.com/charity.wtf/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/normal-spof.png?resize=768%2C768&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/charity.wtf/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/normal-spof.png?w=1024&amp;ssl=1 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 226px) 100vw, 226px\"></p><p>I’m not saying this should never happen. It’s quite normal at startups to have individuals owning software, because the biggest existential risk that you face is not moving fast enough, not finding product market fit, and going out of business. But as you start to grow up as a company, as users start to demand more from you, and you start planning for the survival of the company to extend years into the future…ownership needs to get handed over to a team. Individual engineers get sick, go on vacation, and leave the company, and the business has got to be resilient to that.</p><p>If teams own software, then the key job of any engineering leader is to craft high-performing engineering teams. If you must 10x something, 10x this. <strong>Build 10x engineering teams.</strong></p><h2>The best engineering orgs are the ones where normal engineers can do great work</h2><p>When people talk about world-class engineering orgs, they often have in mind teams that are top-heavy with staff and principal engineers, or recruiting heavily from the ranks of ex-FAANG employees or top universities.</p><p>But I would argue that a truly great engineering org is one where you don’t HAVE to be one of the “best” or most pedigreed engineers in the world to get shit done and have a lot of impact on the business.</p><p>I think it’s actually the other way around. A truly great engineering organization is one where perfectly normal, workaday software engineers, with decent software engineering skills and an ordinary amount of expertise, can consistently move fast, ship code, respond to users, understand the systems they’ve built, and move the business forward a little bit more, day by day, week by week.</p><p>Any asshole can build an org where the most experienced, brilliant engineers in the world can build product and make progress. That is not hard. And putting all the spotlight on individual ability has a way of letting your leaders off the hook for doing their jobs. It is a HUGE competitive advantage if you can build sociotechnical systems where less experienced engineers can convert their effort and energy into product and business momentum.</p><p>A truly great engineering org also happens to be one that mints world-class software engineers. But we’re getting ahead of ourselves, here.</p><h2>Let’s talk about “normal” for a moment</h2><p>A lot of technical people got really attached to our identities as smart kids. The software industry tends to reflect and reinforce this preoccupation at every turn, from Netflix’s “we look for the top 10% of global talent” to Amazon’s talk about “bar-raising” or Coinbase’s recent claim to “hire the top .1%”.

Even those of us who are certified geniuses on certain criteria are likely quite normal in other ways — kinesthetic, emotional, spatial, musical, linguistic, etc.</p><p>Software engineering both selects for and develops certain types of intelligence, particularly around abstract reasoning, but  is born a great software engineer. <strong>Great engineers are made, not born</strong>. I just don’t think there’s a lot more we can get out of thinking of ourselves as a special class of people, compared to the value we can derive from thinking of ourselves collectively as relatively normal people who have practiced a fairly niche craft for a very long time.</p><h2>Build sociotechnical systems with “normal people” in mind</h2><p>When it comes to hiring talent and building teams, yes, absolutely, we should focus on identifying the ways people are exceptional and talented and strong. But when it comes to building sociotechnical systems for software delivery, we should focus on all the ways people are .</p><p>Normal people have cognitive biases — confirmation bias, recency bias, hindsight bias. We work hard, we care, and we do our best; but we also forget things, get impatient, and zone out. Our eyes are inexorably drawn to the color red (unless we are colorblind). We develop habits and ways of doing things, and resist changing them. When we see the same text block repeatedly, we stop reading it.</p><p>We are embodied beings who can get overwhelmed and fatigued. If an alert wakes us up at 3 am, we are much more likely to make mistakes while responding to that alert than if we tried to do the same thing at 3pm. Our emotional state can affect the quality of our work. Our relationships impact our ability to get shit done.</p><p>When your systems are designed to be used by normal engineers, all that excess brilliance they have can get poured into the product itself, instead of wasting it on navigating the system itself.</p><h2>How do you turn normal engineers into 10x engineering teams?</h2><p>None of this should be terribly surprising; it’s all well known wisdom. In order to build the kind of sociotechnical systems for software delivery that enable normal engineers to move fast, learn continuously, and deliver great results as a team, you should:</p><h4>Shrink the interval between when you write the code and when the code goes live.</h4><p>Make it as short as possible; the shorter the better. I’ve written and given talks about this many, many times. The shorter the interval, the lower the cognitive carrying costs. The faster you can iterate, the better. The more of your brain can go into the product instead of the process of building it.</p><p>One of the most powerful things you can do is have a short, fast enough deploy cycle that you can ship one commit per deploy. I’ve referred to this as the “software engineering death spiral” … when the deploy cycle takes so long that you end up batching together a bunch of engineers’ diffs in every build. The slower it gets, the more you batch up, and the harder it becomes to figure out what happened or roll back. The longer it takes, the more people you need, the higher the coordination costs, and the more slowly everyone moves.</p><p>Deploy time is the feedback loop at the heart of the development process. It is almost impossible to overstate the centrality of keeping this short and tight.</p><h4>Make it easy and fast to roll back or recover from mistakes.</h4><p>Developers should be able to deploy their own code, figure out if it’s working as intended or not, and if not, roll forward or back swiftly and easily. No muss, no fuss, no thinking involved.</p><h4>Make it easy to do the right thing and hard to do the wrong thing. <img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" data-attachment-id=\"10018\" data-permalink=\"https://charity.wtf/2025/06/19/in-praise-of-normal-engineers/normal-sparkles/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/charity.wtf/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/normal-sparkles.png?fit=1024%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1024,1024\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"normal-sparkles\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/charity.wtf/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/normal-sparkles.png?fit=300%2C300&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/charity.wtf/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/normal-sparkles.png?fit=660%2C660&amp;ssl=1\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/charity.wtf/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/normal-sparkles.png?resize=137%2C137&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"137\" height=\"137\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/charity.wtf/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/normal-sparkles.png?resize=300%2C300&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/charity.wtf/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/normal-sparkles.png?resize=150%2C150&amp;ssl=1 150w, https://i0.wp.com/charity.wtf/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/normal-sparkles.png?resize=768%2C768&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/charity.wtf/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/normal-sparkles.png?w=1024&amp;ssl=1 1024w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 137px) 100vw, 137px\"></h4><p>Wrap designers and design thinking into all the touch points your engineers have with production systems. Use your platform engineering team to think about how to empower people to swiftly make changes and self-serve, but also remember that a lot of times people will be engaging with production late at night or when they’re very stressed, tired, and&nbsp;possibly freaking out. Build guard rails. The fastest way to ship a single line of code should also be the easiest way to ship a single line of code.</p><h4>Invest in instrumentation and observability.</h4><p>You’ll never know — not really — what the code you wrote does just by reading it. The only way to be sure is by instrumenting your code and watching real users run it in production. Good, friendly sociotechnical systems invest  in tools for sense-making.</p><p>Being able to visualize your work is what makes engineering abstractions accessible to actual engineers. You shouldn’t have to be a world-class engineer just to debug your own damn code.</p><h4>Devote engineering cycles to internal tooling and enablement.</h4><p>If fast, safe deploys, with guard rails, instrumentation, and highly parallelized test suites are “everybody’s job”, they will end up nobody’s job. Engineering productivity isn’t something you can outsource. Managing the interfaces between your software vendors and your own teams is both a science and an art. Making it look easy and intuitive is really hard. It needs an owner.</p><h4>Build an inclusive culture.</h4><p>Growth is the norm, growth is the baseline. People do their best work when they feel a sense of belonging. An inclusive culture is one where everyone feels safe to ask questions, explore, and make mistakes; where everyone is held to the same high standard, and given the support and encouragement they need to achieve their goals.</p><h4>Diverse teams are resilient teams.<img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" data-attachment-id=\"10017\" data-permalink=\"https://charity.wtf/2025/06/19/in-praise-of-normal-engineers/normal-transp-rainbow/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/charity.wtf/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/normal-transp-rainbow.png?fit=1024%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1024,1024\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"normal-transp-rainbow\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/charity.wtf/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/normal-transp-rainbow.png?fit=300%2C300&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/charity.wtf/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/normal-transp-rainbow.png?fit=660%2C660&amp;ssl=1\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/charity.wtf/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/normal-transp-rainbow.png?resize=196%2C196&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"196\" height=\"196\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/charity.wtf/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/normal-transp-rainbow.png?resize=300%2C300&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/charity.wtf/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/normal-transp-rainbow.png?resize=150%2C150&amp;ssl=1 150w, https://i0.wp.com/charity.wtf/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/normal-transp-rainbow.png?resize=768%2C768&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/charity.wtf/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/normal-transp-rainbow.png?w=1024&amp;ssl=1 1024w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 196px) 100vw, 196px\"></h4><p>Yeah, a team of super-senior engineers who all share a similar background can move incredibly fast, but a monoculture is fragile. Someone gets sick, someone gets pregnant, you start to grow and you need to integrate people from other backgrounds and the whole team can get derailed — fast.</p><p>When your teams are used to operating with a mix of genders, racial backgrounds, identities, age ranges, family statuses, geographical locations, skill sets, etc — when this is just table stakes, standard operating procedure — you’re better equipped to roll with it when life happens.</p><h4>Assemble engineering teams from a range of levels.</h4><p>The best engineering teams aren’t top-heavy with staff engineers and principal engineers. The best engineering teams are ones where nobody is running on autopilot, banging out a login page for the 300th time; everyone is working on something that challenges them and pushes their boundaries. Everyone is learning, everyone is teaching, everyone is pushing their own boundaries and growing. All the time.</p><p>By the way — all of that work you put into making your systems resilient, well-designed, and humane is the same work you would need to do to help onboard new engineers, develop junior talent, or let engineers move between teams.</p><p>It gets used and reused. Over and over and over again.</p><h2>The only meaningful measure of productivity is impact to the business</h2><p>The only thing that actually matters when it comes to engineering productivity is whether or not you are moving the business materially forward.</p><p>Which means…we can’t do this in a vacuum. The most important question is whether or not we are working on the right thing, which is a problem engineering can’t answer without help from product, design, and the rest of the business.</p><p>Software engineering isn’t about writing lots of lines of code, it’s about solving business problems using technology.</p><p>Senior and intermediate engineers are actually the workhorses of the industry. They move the business forward, step by step, day by day. They get to put their heads down and crank instead of constantly looking around the org and solving coordination problems. If you have to be a staff+ engineer to move the product forward, something is seriously wrong.</p><h2>Great engineering orgs mint world-class engineers</h2><p>A great engineering org is one where you don’t HAVE to be one of the best engineers in the world to have a lot of impact.

It's also somewhat modular (cellular modem, RAM, and storage are on modules) and they aim to open-source the hardware and plan to manufacture the devices in Spain - meaning, the Liberux Nexx will be (successful funding assumed) be one of the only (?) smartphones designed and build in Europe.</p><p>I asked Liberux for an interview, and they were happy to answer my questions. While they would have prefered to do this as a video interview, I just could not swing that (we're preparing to move, and I have to stand-in for a colleague on holiday at the dayjob right now) - so gladly, they agreed to do it in a back and forth via email. With that said, here you go:</p><p><em>Let's start with something broad: Why did you decide to make a Linux Phone? It is a tiny niche, the software ecosystem is still somewhat nascent, many challenges have not been solved and the market keeps adding new ones (e.g., Voice over LTE (VoLTE) or Rich Communication Services (RCS)). In addition to that, making specific hardware for FOSS (and/or privacy-) nerds is really difficult, as these people can be very nitpicky? So: Why?</em></p><p>We know it’s not an easy path. But it’s a necessary one. The dominant mobile operating systems are black boxes, serving interests that often don’t align with those of the user. We’re concerned about surveillance, the lack of real control over our devices, and the opacity of the software. We wanted to build something different: a phone designed with respect for the user's freedom, running an auditable OS with no backdoors. It's a bet on a future where you don’t have to give up your privacy to have a useful device. It’s not for everyone, but it is for those who value their digital autonomy.</p><p><em>What level of prior experience do members of your team have with hardware projects/phone or consumer electronics manufacturing and software development?</em></p><p>Our team has a mix of backgrounds, all with solid experience. Pedro, for example, developed the operating system (TuxumOS) for the first Linux tablet PC running on x86, and has collaborated with companies like Toshiba, Lenovo, and Fujitsu on Linux support and power management for their laptops. Carlos has designed mechanical keyboards and consumer electronic products. Our hardware design partner, <a href=\"https://pleeda.com/\">Pleeda</a>, has already developed and marketed its own portable game console. Ernesto Mansilla from <a href=\"https://ecaman.es/\">Ecaman</a>, our manufacturing partner, has extensive experience in the production and assembly of electronic boards. The team at Collabora, particularly their programming wizards, has been a huge help in defining the DTBs needed to boot the board. So no, we’re definitely not starting from scratch.</p><p><em>Some people have tried to cast doubt on your origins or even your integrity. What’s your response to those rumors?</em></p><p>Well, at first we found it quite amusing — some of the things being said were wildly outlandish, involving bankers and politicians. It was kind of funny to see ourselves portrayed as being on the “other side” of the conspiracy for once.</p><p>The truth is, free software is our life. Pedro started programming computers (an IBM 5150 his father brought home) when he was just 7 years old. He installed his first Slackware in 1993 using a stack of 3½-inch floppy disks, and he's been a Debian user since the Potato release — with the occasional flirtation with BSD (nobody’s perfect).</p><p>In the end, we honestly don’t understand who would want to spread false information about a project whose sole goal is to provide the community with a freer, more secure phone.</p><p><em>You write that you've looked into the PinePhone (Pro) and Librem 5. What were the biggest mistakes or failures in your analysis of the PinePhone (Pro) and Librem 5 that you don't want to repeat? What did PINE64/Purism do really well in your opinion?</em></p><p>We deeply respect both projects for being pioneers. The PinePhone, for instance, was very affordable, but it was more of a development platform than a daily-use phone. The Librem 5 took so long to come out that its hardware was outdated by the time it was usable.</p><p>That said, they got many things right. PINE64 was brave enough to release several iterations that became key development platforms. Purism achieved very high build quality, even if the final design was bulky. Both have taught us what to avoid — and also what’s worth preserving.</p><p><em>Where do you see yourself regarding software development? More aligned with PINE64 (who just do hardware) or with Purism, who basically made GNOME a thing on Mobile again?</em></p><p>We feel clearly more aligned with Purism. We want to offer equally polished and solid hardware, as well as a strong software development effort to go along with it.</p><p><em>Let's continue with pricing. I've seen discussions on the Fediverse, and you have added going two cheaper (yet still powerful) options with  8 or 16 GB RAM and 128 GB storage and LTE. Can you explain why the Liberux Nexx is more expensive than the average Android smartphone people may be comparing it with?</em></p><p>First, the components: 32 GB of RAM, 5G, and 512 GB of storage are not typical for devices in this space. On top of that, we manufacture in Europe and in small batches, which makes everything more expensive—from assembly to logistics. Every phone will be hand-assembled in our offices. Then there's the intangible: we don’t rely on big manufacturers or opaque supply chains. The price reflects our commitment to quality, transparency, and independence.</p><p><em>Let's get into hardware. Why did you decide to pick the RockChip RK3588s as the core for your product, and not, e.g., a chip from Qualcomm (e.g, QCM6490)? What makes the RK3588s a good choice for phone? Why pick it despite requiring proprietary firmware for GPU and DDR RAM?</em></p><p>The RK3588s is a well-known and respected chip in the Linux community, used in projects like the MNT Reform Next. Yes, it needs proprietary firmware for the GPU and DDR RAM — but so do alternatives like Qualcomm, which typically include even more closed components. One of the key advantages of the RK3588s is that it doesn’t have an integrated 5G modem. This lets us isolate the modem physically and control it via a real kill switch—something much harder (if not impossible) with integrated Qualcomm SoCs. We also aim to work toward freeing the DDR firmware, something that's almost unthinkable on Qualcomm due to much stricter restrictions.</p><p><em>On design choices and details: Why does the Nexx have two USB-C ports?</em></p><p>Simply put: you often need to charge your device and connect something else at the same time. But there's a more ambitious reason too—we want to make it easy to use the Nexx as a desktop computer, and two USB-C ports open up a lot of possibilities, especially with docks or keyboards. And let’s be honest… it just looks awesome!</p><p><em>Does one (or both) of the USB-C ports support DisplayPort Alt Mode, so that I can plug into a display without carrying accessories?</em></p><p>Yes, at least one of the ports will provide direct DisplayPort output, allowing you to use the Nexx as a desktop without additional docks.</p><p><em>What are the transfer speeds that can be expected from the USB ports (USB 2.0, 3.x)? What are your plans regarding USB Power Delivery support?</em></p><p>Both ports will be USB 3.1. We’re also working on implementing support for USB Power\nDelivery, with proper energy delivery for fast charging and accessory compatibility.</p><p><em>Regarding WiFi/BT and LTE/5G: Purism made the unusual choice of making these socketed and exchangeable; I presume this is not the case with your design, the hardware kill switches ensure that components can be truly turned of. Sadly, there don't seem to be any blob-free choices. What are the main criteria to pick hardware here?</em></p><p>Our priority was balancing performance and Linux compatibility. The 5G modem will be replaceable—it’s mounted on a small FPC board, making it easy to swap without the bulk of traditional sockets. Wi-Fi and Bluetooth are soldered directly to the board, but both are connected to physical kill switches that cut power entirely, ensuring they’re really off. We know there are no fully free options yet, but we’ve chosen components with good Linux support and low power usage, minimizing blobs without sacrificing usability.</p><p><em>Battery life has been an issue with the existing native Linux phones. How do you plan to optimize for this?</em></p><p>It’s one of our top priorities. We’re developing a dedicated daemon to manage power more efficiently—it will shut down and wake up CPU cores depending on load, adjust frequencies dynamically, and optimize idle performance. We’re also working on smarter suspend and resume behavior, including options like RTC wake, wake-on-WAN, power button, or even tapto-wake. Brightness management will also adapt more intelligently to real usage conditions. All this aims to extend battery life without compromising the experience.</p><p><em>Some important phone features are set by hardware choices. Unfortunately, Voice over LTE has become mandatory in some markets (and the number of markets, where this is the case, will only grow) - is it a major deciding factor when choosing the 5G part?</em></p><p>Yes, we considered that. We want the Nexx to feature modern hardware compatible with the latest technologies. VoLTE is increasingly essential, and we see it as key to ensuring a good\nuser experience and long-term compatibility.</p><p><em>Aside from necessary certifications, you are also going for a OSHW certification - does this mean Liberux Nexx will be Open Source Hardware?</em></p><p>Yes, that’s our goal. We want the Nexx to be open source hardware, which is why we’ll release the schematics with the first units shipped. Other assets (like full mechanical designs and manufacturing files) might come a bit later. Our initial idea was to release everything once we hit about 10,000 units sold. What matters most to us is building something open and transparent—even if we have to take it step by step.</p><p><em>Accessories. Maybe this is just my age (and growing grumpiness) showing, but - and especially from my experience with existing Linux Phones - why the Wireless Dock (W-Dock) for the\n\"use phone as a PC\" use case? I would have rather gone with a nice USB dock that has a silent fan to keep the phone cool to not suffer from throttling.</em></p><p>We totally get that! In fact, we’re not ruling out that more traditional option. But Pedro had already developed an interesting solution to access the device remotely via RDP, which opened the door for us to explore a wireless dock. The main advantage is that you can keep using the phone for things like calls without unplugging it. Still, we know a USB dock with passive or silent cooling has real value, and it’s definitely on the table as a future accessory.</p><p><em>The Liberux Mechanical Keyboard sounds interesting. Any idea on pricing? Will it be available separately?</em></p><p>Yes, we plan to offer it separately—even in a black version—and it will likely be under €200 (excluding taxes). It’s inspired by the legendary IBM Model F, but in a more compact format. We even want to implement the buckling spring mechanism those keyboards had almost 50 years ago, since we think it still outperforms any modern keyboard. The goal is to deliver that unmistakable mechanical experience in a more portable and modern design.</p><p><em>Let's tackle software.\nYou write that \"LiberuxOS (based on Debian 13 Linux) is an ethical and mostly opensource operating system.\" Which parts will be non-open-source? Just firmware, or also drivers / custom user space software (e.g., apps)?</em></p><p>Our goal is to release everything we can. There will be some unavoidable blobs, like firmware for the GPU or modem, but all apps we develop will be open source. We won’t include closed software—either ours or from third parties. Any new developments, such as interfaces or tools, will be published from day one.</p><p><em>Are you intending to ship a (close to) mainline kernel, or a Board Support Package (BSP)/vendor kernel and make it work with a libhybris/Halium approach?</em></p><p>We’ll go with bare-metal Linux—no Halium, no libhybris. We want to stay as close to mainline as possible and actively contribute upstream.</p><p><em>Do you intend generally develop software bits in the open where possible or just where required by license?</em></p><p>We’ll develop everything openly. Our policy is to publish code, collaborate with the community, and be transparent. Free software, for us, is a matter of principle—not just legal compliance.</p><p>_Why go with a distribution of your own and not partner with existing projects (e.g., postmarketOS, Mobian, Ubuntu Touch, Sailfish OS)? Given that you are basing on Debian, a collaboration with Mobian (or, if vendor kernel Droidian) may lead to obvious synergies. Are you exploring this?</p><p>Yes, we’ve considered it—especially Mobian, since we share a base. But building our own distro lets us better tailor the system to the hardware and to the kind of use we want to promote. That said, it’s not mutually exclusive: we want to make porting other distros as easy as possible and collaborate with anyone interested.</p><p><em>Why GNOME Shell Mobile and not Phosh? In my experience, Phosh is better at dealing\nthe occasional app/dialog that's not quite ready for mobile.</em></p><p>We considered Phosh. But GNOME Shell Mobile gives us more room long-term in terms of customization, animations, and graphical performance. That said, we’re doing significant work on top of GNOME Shell to make it more mobile-friendly. Phosh is more mature in some areas, but we’re betting on something we can evolve more freely.</p><p><em>Which parts of GNOME Shell Mobile do you intend to improve on for the Liberux Nexx?</em></p><p>We’re working on better window management, visual improvements, and a more refined touch experience with intuitive gestures. We want using the Nexx to feel smooth and pleasant from the very first boot.</p><p><em>Since I've attended [Akademy]( last year: Why not Plasma Mobile?</em></p><p>We think Plasma Mobile is a great option and respect it a lot, but for our goals, it didn’t align as well. Given our limited resources, we had to focus on a single interface, and GNOME Shell Mobile fits our vision better, even if it also needs polishing.</p><p><em>Are you in talks with community members/known Linux Mobile developers?</em></p><p>Yes, we’re already in touch with various developers and projects.</p><p>[I have asked a follow-up and known-to-me names have been mentioned, but to preserve privacy, these names are not included here.]</p><p><em>Are there ways the community/interested people can help you make the Liberux Nexx happen, despite ordering on Indiegogo (especially for those, that would like to get the phone, but can't afford it right now)?</em></p><p>Any help is welcome: from spreading the word to contributing code. We also accept donations so people who can’t afford the phone can still support the project.</p><p>We want this to be a community effort—not just our own.</p><h3>More questions?

A few weeks ago, I had the opportunity to meet&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Griesemer\">Robert Griesemer</a>, co-creator of Go, in person, as well as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/doughertymarc/\">Marc Dougherty</a>, Developer Advocate for the Go team at Google. At a happy hour after Google I/O, Marc asked me and another Go GDE from Korea for feedback on the language. My response was that I didn’t have any specific feedback about the language but that:</p><blockquote><p>Go should be more opinionated about the application layout.</p></blockquote><p>It was worth writing a post to express my thoughts more clearly.</p><p>Starting from the beginning…</p><p>In 2025, I will have completed 10 years of writing code in Go. One of the things I recall from when I started is that the language was relatively simple to learn, mainly due to two reasons: its simplicity and the fact that there is only one way to do things. Go was the first language I came across that had strong opinions about several things. There is only one way to loop, and there is only one way to format files (using the ‘go fmt’ command). Variables with a small scope should have short names, etc. It made it much easier to read code written by other people, which is crucial for learning. The code I wrote was very similar to the Kubernetes code! Of course, the complexity of the problem was infinitely greater, but the code’s structure was readable to me. Over the years, I have observed this effect in several people I have followed who were starting in the language or migrating from other environments.</p><p>But once this initial excitement has passed, the biggest challenge comes: how to adopt Go in a project larger than those used for learning? How do you structure a project that will be developed and evolved by a team? At this point, the language step aside from strong opinions, and each team or company needs to decide how to structure their projects. Over the past decade, I have worked for four companies. In all of them, it was necessary to invest the team’s time in collecting examples and reading documentation and books to determine which structure they should use in the projects.&nbsp;At the company where I currently work, we have created a <a href=\"https://medium.com/inside-picpay/organizing-projects-and-defining-names-in-go-7f0eab45375d\">document</a> about this.</p><p>Making an analogy with the world of games, it’s as if we were having fun in the controlled and wonderful world of Super Mario World and were transported to the open world of GTA 6 (yes! I’m hyped!). It’s still a fantastic universe, but the transition is quite abrupt.</p><p>Go could be more opinionated regarding these choices. We could have templates for more common projects, such as CLIs, APIs, and microservices., that teams can use to scaffold their applications. The language toolkit <a href=\"https://go.dev/blog/gonew\">already&nbsp;allows the use of project templates</a>,&nbsp;so it would be a matter of having official templates to make life easier for teams. Alternatively, we could go further and include the command in the language toolkit itself with something like .</p><p>A similar event occurred in the history of the language. Today,&nbsp; dependency management is a fundamental part of our daily lives as Go developers. But it wasn’t always like this. For a long time, there was no official package manager for the language; consequently, the community developed several alternatives. They all worked, but fragmentation was getting out of control, making it challenging to integrate packages. Until the language team took control of the situation and&nbsp; was created, pacifying the issue of “package and dependency management.” I believe we can apply the same approach to the structure of projects.</p><p>Another profile that would benefit from a more opinionated project structure is that formed by teams that are migrating their applications from other languages, especially Java and PHP. In these ecosystems, frameworks dictate the structure of projects, such as Spring Boot and Laravel. “Where do I start? How do I structure my project?” are common questions I hear from teams migrating from these languages. Having something that facilitates this migration would lower the barrier to entry and increase the number of teams experimenting with Go in production.</p><p>That’s my biggest feedback regarding Go at the moment. What do you think, dear reader? What’s your opinion on the subject?

FINALLY!</li><li>Identified the root cause as a lock contention issue across multiple background job workers, schema migrator and long running transactions</li><li>Isolated application level locking from business logic tables to a common locks table to avoid lock contention with  which in turn locks the entire table</li><li>All Services restored including internal release related services</li></ol><h2>The Incident: When Everything Just… Stopped</h2><p>It started with Google Cloud monitoring alerts triggered on database error threshold being breached. Saw a whole bunch of error logs\nwith <code>Context cancelled by user</code> statement.</p><p>The immediate reaction (panic) was to blame the recently provisioned read replica for the production database instance. This was done to\nsafely execute internal analytical queries with Metabase, a non-critical internal service. My response was</p><ul><li>Stop the replication in the replica instance using Google Cloud console</li><li>Restart the primary database instance hoping that any performance issues due to replication would be resolved</li></ul><p>This temporarily restored the services but the errors quickly returned. It also correlates with time of the day when our usage is at\nits peak. My mind correlated this by making a hypothesis that we introduced a new query that may have a missing index leading to\na table scan. But I could not validate this hypothesis by looking at CPU, memory and IO metrics of the primary database instance.</p><p>In fact, we did not see any replication lag during the last 24 hours. This made me question my hypothesis of the issue caused by\nread replicas. Even though that was the most recent infrastructure change that I could confirm looking at our Terraform repository\ncommit history. Finally decided its time to dig deep because of:</p><ol><li>No CPU / memory / IO wait metric anomaly for primary database instance</li><li>No replication lag in read replicas</li><li>Binary log size (storage) started increasing on primary when replication was stopped. This is expected due to active replication slots in the primary.</li><li>Manually deleted PostgreSQL replication slots from primary database instance</li><li>Even deleted the replicas assuming some weirdness with Google CloudSQL and its internal high availability configuration</li></ol><p>Find the slots used by replicas.</p><div><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code data-lang=\"sql\"></code></pre></div><div><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code data-lang=\"sql\"></code></pre></div><h2>The Real Culprit: Lock Contention Hell</h2><p>It was clear that  is not going to fix the issue. It was time to dig deeper. Retrospectively, I think I planned to do the following:</p><ol><li>Identify long running or expensive queries</li><li>Identify the root cause of the expensive queries</li><li>Optimize them by rewriting them or using appropriate indexes</li></ol><p>The following query was used to list all active queries and sort them by the query age. This gives a view of the long running queries along with the  and other information required to kill the query if required.</p><div><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code data-lang=\"sql\"></code></pre></div><ul><li>Multiple  style locks waiting to be acquired</li><li>Multiple <code>ALTER TABLE .. ADD COLUMN</code> statements queued up</li><li>Multiple <code>INSERT .. ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING</code> statements queued up</li></ul><p>The most interesting bit is, all these queries were waiting to acquire a lock on the  table. This is the table where we store OSS package scanning jobs powering <a href=\"https://github.com/safedep/vet\">SafeDep vet</a>, updated by background job workers and queried by a user facing API. At this point, I was fairly sure it is a lock contention issue but wanted to confirm it before taking any action, especially since I already exhausted myself by reverting infrastructure changes as panic response.</p><h2>The Perfect Storm: How It All Went Wrong</h2><p>Lets have a quick look at the components that act on the  table and how they interact with each other. The system consists of the following logical components:</p><ol><li>Submission API that is idempotent and can be retried without creating duplicate jobs</li><li>Background job workers that actually execute an OSS package analysis job with a timeout of 15 minutes</li><li>Query API that is used to fetch the status and results of a job by its job identifier</li></ol><p>We also have a schema migrator built as part of our application development framework, which internally executes <a href=\"https://gorm.io/\">GORM</a> migrations with additional safety checks that guarantee timeouts, global locks, audit logs and more.</p><p>Our API framework is built to execute a business logic (service layer) in transaction by default for consistency unless explicitly opted out by the service specification. We generally opt out of transactions only for read-only operations. In case of the submission API, the service logic does the following in a transaction:</p><ol><li>Check if the job already exists in the database</li><li>Create a new job record in the database if it does not exist</li><li>Create a background job to execute the OSS package analysis job (transactional consistency)</li><li>Return the job identifier to the client</li></ol><p>Note: The submission API is idempotent which requires attempting to read a row from the  table to check if the job already exists before performing an  operation. The table uses unique index constraints to guarantee idempotency even when there is a race condition. This means,  cannot be concurrent.</p><blockquote><p>INSERT into tables that lack unique indexes will not be blocked by concurrent activity. Tables with unique indexes might block if concurrent sessions perform actions that lock or modify rows matching the unique index values. <a href=\"https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-insert.html\">Ref</a></p></blockquote><h3>Package Analysis Business Logic</h3><p>The background job workers execute the OSS package analysis job with a timeout of 15 minutes. The job is executed in a transaction and the following steps are performed:</p><ol><li>Acquire a row-level lock on the  record to prevent multiple workers from executing the same job concurrently</li><li>Execute a long running RPC call to an external service that takes up to 5 minutes to complete</li><li>Update the job record in the database</li></ol><p>Example code snippet from the background job worker:</p><div><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code data-lang=\"go\"></code></pre></div><p>The schema migrator is a tool that we use to safely apply schema changes to the database. In this particular case, following was the schema change that triggered the issue:</p><div><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code data-lang=\"diff\"></code></pre></div><p>This schema change adds two new columns to the  table along with adding indexes on them.\nThis translates to the following SQL statement:</p><div><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code data-lang=\"sql\"></code></pre></div><ol><li><code>ALTER TABLE .. ADD COLUMN</code> statement needs an  on the table even though its just a table metadata update</li><li>The index creation is a separate operation that, by default, needs an  on the table unless  is explicitly specified</li></ol><blockquote><p>PostgreSQL supports building indexes without locking out writes. This method is invoked by specifying the CONCURRENTLY option of CREATE INDEX. <a href=\"https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-createindex.html\">Ref</a></p></blockquote><h3>The Lock Hierarchy That Kills</h3><p>Here’s what PostgreSQL’s <a href=\"https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/explicit-locking.html\">documentation</a> tells us about :</p><blockquote><p>“Conflicts with ALL other lock modes. Guarantees that the holder is the only transaction accessing the table in any way.”</p></blockquote><p>Now that we saw the lock hierarchy, we can see there are multiple contenders that contributed to the incident by holding locks or trying to lock the entire tabling by requesting .</p><p>The root cause of the issue is the following sequence of events:</p><ol><li> - Acquire row-level locks on </li><li> - Waits for  on </li><li><strong>New Submission API requests arrive</strong> - Queue behind the  waiting for table access</li><li> - All API (app) server Go routines blocked on database calls</li><li> - API becomes unresponsive, not just for impacted tables but for all API endpoints</li></ol><p>Two things were clear so far:</p><ol><li>Long running transactions are toxic - The best practices are right!</li><li>Schema migration on large and busy tables are VERY VERY risky</li></ol><p>Lets ignore the fact that we tried creating an index on a large table, we can mitigate it by updating our schema migration process to leverage maintenance window and concurrency primitives offered by PostgreSQL. But this incident can repeat again even for a harmless <code>ALTER TABLE .. ADD COLUMN</code> statement that only modifies table metadata. This is because, the  will wait for  on the table even though its just a table metadata update. Row level locks held by background job workers makes the table slow and risky for schema changes.</p><p>Locking is however an application primitive that we need. We have two options:</p><ol><li>Use an external service like Redis for locking</li><li>Isolate locking from business logic tables to a common locks table</li></ol><p>While blogs and other common wisdom points to [1], we decided against it because it introduces additional complexity of serializing locks and data access across multiple services ie. PostgreSQL and Redis. We decided to continue leverage PostgreSQL for resource (row) level locks but isolate them from business logic tables that may be changed as and when required. Instead, we decided to introduce a common  table that will rarely require schema changes because it offers a single primitive ie. lock a row by  and .</p><h3>Before: Direct Table Locking</h3><p>Service level, adhoc locking pattern before the incident:</p><div><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code data-lang=\"go\"></code></pre></div><p>Common resource locking API for use by the service layer. While currently it leverages PostgreSQL backend for locking, the API offers abstractions for us to keep options open for future.</p><div><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code data-lang=\"go\"></code></pre></div><p>Finally, the business logic can be executed without holding any locks on the business logic table\nand leveraging the common resource locking API.</p><div><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code data-lang=\"go\"></code></pre></div><p>So far so good. We have a fix in place. But there are challenges with deployment because it requires schema changes and background job workers to be restarted. We were reluctant to execute schema changes in production without a proper maintenance window but we also needed to unblock releases that required schema changes. So we roughly took the following steps:</p><ol><li>Paused all background jobs for the queue that was running the OSS package analysis jobs to avoid any row level locks on the  table</li><li>Waited for all existing jobs to complete and verified no queued queries in the database</li><li>Deployed the fix to production</li><li>Applied the schema changes for common locks table</li><li>Restarted all background jobs for the queue</li></ol><p>Aha! thats how it looks like after the fix, with usual schema migration and background job workers running again.</p><h2>The Key Insight: Lock Isolation</h2><p>The breakthrough was realizing that <strong>serialization requirements</strong> and  are orthogonal concerns. You don’t need to lock the  table to ensure only one password reset email goes out. You don’t need to lock the  table to prevent duplicate payment processing. You need a coordination mechanism that’s separate from your data storage. This ensures both application queries and schema management operations are not blocking by long held locks which may be required by the business logic (service layer).</p><p>This isn’t about PostgreSQL being bad or Go being bad or our architecture being bad. This is about the fundamental tension between  and <strong>availability requirements</strong> in distributed systems. The CAP theorem suddenly seems more real, it shows up in your production database unexpectedly when you are trying to add a column and your API dies.</p>","contentLength":11752,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/1lfg2bx/the_postgresql_locking_trap_that_killed_our/"},{"title":"A major update of Aralez: High performance, pure Rust, OpenSource proxy server","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1lffvox/a_major_update_of_aralez_high_performance_pure/","date":1750352242,"author":"/u/sadoyan","guid":163033,"unread":true,"content":"<p>Hi <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/\">r/rust</a>!

I personally go as far as to refuse to contribute to projects under a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permissive_software_license\">permissive license</a>, and/or that utilize a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contributor_License_Agreement\">contributor license agreement</a>, and/or that utilize anything riskily similar to these two, because I am of the opinion that <strong>no amount of code for accessibility should either be put under a paywall or be obscured and proprietary</strong>.</p><p>Permissive licenses make it painlessly easy for abusers to fork, build an ecosystem on top of it which may include accessibility-related improvements, slap a price tag alongside it, all without publishing any of these additions/changes. Corporations have been doing that for decades, and they’ll keep doing it until there’s heavy push back. The only time I would contribute to a project under a permissive license is when the tool  the accessibility infrastructure itself. Contributor license agreements are <a href=\"https://opensource.com/article/19/2/cla-problems\">significantly worse in that regard</a>, so I prefer to avoid them completely.</p><h2></h2><p>The GNOME Foundation has been investing a lot of money to improve accessibility on Linux, for example <a href=\"https://blogs.gnome.org/a11y/2024/06/18/update-on-newton-the-wayland-native-accessibility-project\">funding Newton, a Wayland accessibility project</a> and <a href=\"https://blogs.gnome.org/tbernard/2025/04/11/gnome-stf-2024/#newton\">AccessKit integration into GNOME technologies</a>. Around 250,000€ (1/4) of the <a href=\"https://blogs.gnome.org/tbernard/2025/04/11/gnome-stf-2024/\">STF budget</a> was spent solely on accessibility. And get this: <strong>literally everybody managing these contracts and communication with funders are volunteers; they’re ensuring people with disabilities earn a living, but aren’t receiving anything in return</strong>. These are the real heroes who deserve endless praise.</p><p>Do you want to know who we  be blaming? Profiteers who are profiting from the community’s effort while investing very little to nothing into accessibility.</p><p>This includes a significant portion of the companies sponsoring GNOME and even companies that employ developers to work on GNOME. These companies are the ones making hundreds of millions, if not billions, in net profit indirectly from GNOME (and other free and open-source projects), and investing little to nothing into them. However, the worst offenders are the companies actively using GNOME without ever donating anything to fund the projects.</p><p>Some companies actually do put an effort, like Red Hat and Igalia. Red Hat employs people with disabilities to work on accessibility in GNOME, one of which I actually rely on when making accessibility-related contributions in GNOME. Igalia funds Orca, the screen reader as part of GNOME, which is something the Linux community should be thankful of. However, companies have historically invested what’s necessary to comply with governments’ accessibility requirements, and then never invest in it again.</p><p>The privileged people who keep sharing and making content around accessibility on Linux being bad without contributing anything to it are, in my opinion, significantly worse than the companies profiting off of GNOME. Companies are and stay quiet, but these privileged people add an additional burden to contributors by either trash talking or sharing trash talkers. Once again, no volunteer deserves to be in the position of being shamed and ridiculed for “not doing enough”, since no one is entitled to their free time, but themselves.</p><h3></h3><p>Earlier in this article, I mentioned, and I quote: “I’ve been putting so much effort, <u>quite literally  of hours</u> […]”. Let’s put an emphasis on “hundreds”. Here’s a list of most accessibility-related merge requests that have been incorporated into GNOME:</p><p>GNOME Calendar’s <a href=\"https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gnome-calendar/-/merge_requests/559\">!559</a> addresses an issue where event widgets were unable to be focused and activated by the keyboard. That was present since the <a href=\"https://social.treehouse.systems/@TheEvilSkeleton/114434850837916105\">very beginning of GNOME Calendar’s existence</a>, to be specific: for more than a decade. This alone was was a two-week effort. Despite it being less than 100 lines of code, nobody truly knew what to do to have them working properly before. This was followed up by <a href=\"https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gnome-calendar/-/merge_requests/576\">!576</a>, which made the <a href=\"https://social.treehouse.systems/@TheEvilSkeleton/114559888953249311\">event buttons usable in the month view with a keyboard</a>, and then <a href=\"https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gnome-calendar/-/merge_requests/587\">!587</a>, which properly conveys the states of the widgets. Both combined are another two-week effort.</p><p>Then, at the time of writing this article, <a href=\"https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gnome-calendar/-/merge_requests/564\">!564</a> adds 640 lines of code, which is something I’ve been volunteering on for more than a month, excluding the time before I opened the merge request.</p><p>Let’s do a little bit of math together with ‘only’ <a href=\"https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gnome-calendar/-/merge_requests/559\">!559</a>, <a href=\"https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gnome-calendar/-/merge_requests/576\">!576</a>, and <a href=\"https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gnome-calendar/-/merge_requests/587\">!587</a>. Just as a reminder: these three merge requests are a four-week effort in total, which I volunteered full-time—8 hours a day, or 160 hours a month. I compiled a small table that illustrates its worth:</p><table><thead><tr><th>Average Wage for Professionals Working on Digital Accessibility</th><th>Total in Local Currency(160 hours)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr></tr><tr></tr><tr></tr></tbody></table><p>To summarize the table: <strong>those three merge requests that I worked on for  were worth 9,393.60$ CAD (6,921.36$ USD) in total at a minimum</strong>.</p><ul><li>these merge requests exclude the time spent to review the submitted code;</li><li>these merge requests exclude the time I spent testing the code;</li><li>these merge requests exclude the time we spent coordinating these milestones;</li><li>these calculations exclude the 30+ merge requests submitted to GNOME; and</li><li>these calculations exclude the merge requests I submitted to third-party GNOME-adjacent apps.</li></ul><p>Now just imagine how I feel when I’m told I’m “not doing enough”, either directly or indirectly, by privileged people who don’t rely on any of these accessibility features. Whenever anybody says we’re “not doing enough”, I feel very much included, and I will absolutely take it personally.</p><h3></h3><p>I fully expect everything I say in this article to be dismissed or be taken out of context on the basis of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ad_hominem\">ad hominem</a>, simply by the mere fact I’m a GNOME Foundation member / regular GNOME contributor. Either that, or be subject to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whataboutism\">whataboutism</a> because another GNOME contributor made a comment that had nothing to do with mine but <em>‘is somewhat related to this topic and therefore should be pointed out just because it was maybe-probably-possibly-perhaps ableist’</em>. I can’t speak for other regular contributors, but I presume that they don’t feel comfortable talking about this because they dared be a GNOME contributor. At least, that’s how I felt for the longest time.</p><p>Any content related to accessibility that doesn’t dunk on GNOME doesn’t foresee as many engagement, activity, and reaction as content that actively attacks GNOME, regardless of whether the criticism is fair. Many of these people don’t even use these accessibility features; they’re just looking for every opportunity to say “GNOME bad” and will  start caring about accessibility.</p><p>Regular GNOME contributors like myself don’t always feel comfortable defending ourselves because dismissing GNOME developers just for being GNOME developers is apparently a trend…</p><p>Dear people with disabilities,</p><p>I won’t insist that we’re either your allies or your enemies—I have no right to claim that whatsoever.</p><p>I wasn’t looking for recognition. I wasn’t looking for acknowledgment since the very beginning either. I thought I would be perfectly capable of quietly improving accessibility in GNOME, but because of the overall community’s persistence to smear developers’ efforts without actually tackling the underlying issues within the stack, I think I’ve justified myself to at least demand for acknowledgment from the wider community.</p><p>I highly doubt it will happen anyway, because the Linux community feeds off of drama and trash talking instead of being productive, without realizing that it negatively demotivates active contributors while pushing away potential contributors. And worst of all: people with disabilities are the ones affected the most because they are misled into thinking that we don’t care.</p><p>It’s so unfair and infuriating that all the work I do and share online gain very little activity compared to random posts and articles from privileged people without disabilities that rant about the Linux desktop’s accessibility being trash. It doesn’t help that I become severely anxious sharing accessibility-related work to avoid signs of virtue-signaling. The last thing I want is to (unintentionally) give any sign and impression of pretending to care about accessibility.</p><p>We simultaneously need more interest from people with disabilities to contribute to free and open-source software, and the wider community to be significantly more intolerant of bullies who profit from smearing and demotivating people who are actively trying.</p>","contentLength":11286,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/1lfbsij/its_true_we_dont_care_about_accessibility_on/"},{"title":"[P] I built a self-hosted Databricks","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1lfbq3m/p_i_built_a_selfhosted_databricks/","date":1750342094,"author":"/u/Mission-Balance-4250","guid":163146,"unread":true,"content":"<p>Hey everone, I'm an ML Engineer who spearheaded the adoption of Databricks at work.

It was (apparently) some sort of Linux container system inside of Google that ran all of their stuff. The terminology was a bit baffling, with something called a \"Borglet\" inside of clusters with \"cells\" but the basics started to leak. There was a concept of \"services\" and a concept of \"jobs\", where applications could use services to respond to user requests and then jobs to complete batch jobs that ran for much longer periods of time. </p><p>Then on June 7th, 2014, we got our first commit of Kubernetes. The Greek word for 'helmsman' that absolutely no one could pronounce correctly for the first three years. (Is it koo-ber-NET-ees? koo-ber-NEET-ees? Just give up and call it k8s like the rest of us.) </p><p>Microsoft, RedHat, IBM, Docker join the Kubernetes community pretty quickly after this, which raised Kubernetes from an interesting Google thing to \"maybe this is a real product?\" On July 21st 2015 we got the v1.0 release as well as the creation of the CNCF. </p><p>In the ten years since that initial commit, Kubernetes has become a large part of my professional life. I use it at home, at work, on side projects—anywhere it makes sense. It's a tool with a steep learning curve, but it's also a massive force multiplier. We no longer \"manage infrastructure\" at the server level; everything is declarative, scalable, recoverable and (if you’re lucky) self-healing.</p><p>But the journey hasn't been without problems. Some common trends have emerged, where mistakes or misconfiguration arise from where Kubernetes isn't opinionated enough. Even ten years on, we're still seeing a lot of churn inside of ecosystem and people stepping on well-documented landmines. So, knowing what we know now, what could we do differently to make this great tool even more applicable to more people and problems? </p><p>Let's start with the positive stuff. Why are we still talking about this platform now? </p><p>Containers as a tool for software development make perfect sense. Ditch the confusion of individual laptop configuration and have one standard, disposable concept that works across the entire stack. While tools like Docker Compose allowed for some deployments of containers, they were clunky and still required you as the admin to manage a lot of the steps. I set up a Compose stack with a deployment script that would remove the instance from the load balancer, pull the new containers, make sure they started and then re-added it to the LB, as did lots of folks. </p><p>K8s allowed for this concept to scale out, meaning it was possible to take a container from your laptop and deploy an identical container across thousands of servers. This flexibility allowed organizations to revisit their entire design strategy, dropping monoliths and adopting more flexible (and often more complicated) micro-service designs. </p><p>If you think of the history of Operations as a sort of \"naming timeline from pets to cattle\", we started with what I affectionately call the \"Simpsons\" era. Servers were bare metal boxes set up by teams, they often had one-off names that became slang inside of teams and everything was a snowflake. The longer a server ran, the more cruft it picked up until it became a scary operation to even reboot them, much less attempt to rebuild them. I call it the \"Simpsons\" era because among the jobs I was working at the time, naming them after Simpsons characters was surprisingly common. Nothing fixed itself, everything was a manual operation. </p><p>Then we transition into the \"01 Era\". Tools like Puppet and Ansible have become common place, servers are more disposable and you start to see things like bastion hosts and other access control systems become the norm. Servers aren't all facing the internet, they're behind a load balancer and we've dropped the cute names for stuff like \"app01\" or \"vpn02\". Organizations designed it so they could lose some of their servers some of the time. However failures still weren't self-healing, someone still had to SSH in to see what broke, write up a fix in the tooling and then deploy it across the entire fleet. OS upgrades were still complicated affairs. </p><p>We're now in the \"UUID Era\". Servers exist to run containers, they are entirely disposable concepts. Nobody cares about how long a particular version of the OS is supported for, you just bake a new AMI and replace the entire machine. K8s wasn't the only technology enabling this, but it was the one that accelerated it. Now the idea of a bastion server with SSH keys that I go to the underlying server to fix problems is seen as more of a \"break-glass\" solution. Almost all solutions are \"destroy that Node, let k8s reorganize things as needed, make a new Node\". </p><p>A lot of the Linux skills that were critical to my career are largely nice to have now, not need to have. You can be happy or sad about that, I certainly switch between the two emotions on a regular basis, but it's just the truth. </p><p>The k8s jobs system isn't perfect, but it's so much better than the \"snowflake cron01 box\" that was an extremely common sight at jobs for years. Running on a cron schedule or running from a message queue, it was now possible to reliably put jobs into a queue, have them get run, have them restart if they didn't work and then move on with your life. </p><p>Not only does this free up humans from a time-consuming and boring task, but it's also simply a more efficient use of resources. You are still spinning up a pod for every item in the queue, but your teams have a lot of flexibility inside of the \"pod\" concept for what they need to run and how they want to run it. This has really been a quality of life improvement for a lot of people, myself included, who just need to be able to easily background tasks and not think about them again. </p><p><strong>Service Discoverability and Load Balancing</strong></p><p>Hard-coded IP addresses that lived inside of applications as the template for where requests should be routed has been a curse following me around for years. If you were lucky, these dependencies weren't based on IP address but were actually DNS entries and you could change the thing behind the DNS entry without coordinating a deployment of a million applications. </p><p>K8s allowed for simple DNS names to call other services. It removed an entire category of errors and hassle and simplified the entire thing down. With the Service API you had a stable, long lived IP and hostname that you could just point things towards and not think about any of the underlying concepts. You even have concepts like ExternalName that allow you to treat external services like they're in the cluster. </p><h2>What would I put in a Kubernetes 2.0?</h2><p>YAML was appealing because it wasn't JSON or XML, which is like saying your new car is great because it's neither a horse nor a unicycle. It demos nicer for k8s, looks nicer sitting in a repo and has the  of being a simple file format. In reality. YAML is just too much for what we're trying to do with k8s and it's not a safe enough format. Indentation is error-prone, the files don't scale great (you really don't want a super long YAML file), debugging can be annoying. YAML has  subtle behaviors outlined in its spec.</p><p>I still remember not believing what I was seeing the first time I saw the Norway Problem. For those lucky enough to not deal with it, the Norway Problem in YAML is when 'NO' gets interpreted as false. Imagine explaining to your Norwegian colleagues that their entire country evaluates to false in your configuration files. Add in accidental numbers from lack of quotes, the list goes on and on. There are much better posts on why YAML is crazy than I'm capable of writing: <a href=\"https://ruudvanasseldonk.com/2023/01/11/the-yaml-document-from-hell\">https://ruudvanasseldonk.com/2023/01/11/the-yaml-document-from-hell</a></p><p>HCL is already the format for Terraform, so at least we'd only have to hate one configuration language instead of two. It's strongly typed with explicit types. There's already good validation mechanisms. It is specifically designed to do the job that we are asking YAML to do and it's not much harder to read. It has built-in functions people are already using that would allow us to remove some of the third-party tooling from the YAML workflow. </p><p>I would wager 30% of Kubernetes clusters today are  being managed with HCL via Terraform. We don't need the Terraform part to get a lot of the benefits of a superior configuration language. </p><p>The only downsides are that HCL is slightly more verbose than YAML, and its Mozilla Public License 2.0 (MPL-2.0) would require careful legal review for integration into an Apache 2.0 project like Kubernetes. However, for the quality-of-life improvements it offers, these are hurdles worth clearing.</p><p>Let's take a simple YAML file. </p><pre><code># YAML doesn't enforce types\nreplicas: \"3\"  # String instead of integer\nresources:\n  limits:\n    memory: 512  # Missing unit suffix\n  requests:\n    cpu: 0.5m    # Typo in CPU unit (should be 500m)</code></pre><p>Even in the most basic example, there are footguns everywhere. HCL and the type system would catch all of these problems. </p><pre><code>replicas = 3  # Explicitly an integer\n\nresources {\n  limits {\n    memory = \"512Mi\"  # String for memory values\n  }\n  requests {\n    cpu = 0.5  # Number for CPU values\n  }\n}</code></pre><p>Take a YAML file like this that you probably have 6000 in your k8s repo. Now look at HCL without needing external tooling. </p><pre><code># Need external tools or templating for dynamic values\napiVersion: v1\nkind: ConfigMap\nmetadata:\n  name: app-config\ndata:\n  # Can't easily generate or transform values\n  DATABASE_URL: \"postgres://user:password@db:5432/mydb\"\n  API_KEY: \"static-key-value\"\n  TIMESTAMP: \"2023-06-18T00:00:00Z\"  # Hard-coded timestamp</code></pre><pre><code>resource \"kubernetes_config_map\" \"app_config\" {\n  metadata {\n    name = \"app-config\"\n  }\n  \n  data = {\n    DATABASE_URL = \"postgres://${var.db_user}:${var.db_password}@${var.db_host}:${var.db_port}/${var.db_name}\"\n    API_KEY      = var.api_key != \"\" ? var.api_key : random_string.api_key.result\n    TIMESTAMP    = timestamp()\n  }\n}\n\nresource \"random_string\" \"api_key\" {\n  length  = 32\n  special = false\n}</code></pre><p>Here's all the pros you get with this move. </p><ol><li>: Preventing type-related errors before deployment</li><li>: Reducing duplication and improving maintainability</li><li><strong>Functions and Expressions</strong>: Enabling dynamic configuration generation</li><li>: Supporting environment-specific configurations</li><li>: Simplifying repetitive configurations</li><li>: Improving documentation and readability</li><li>: Making errors easier to identify and fix</li><li>: Enabling reuse of configuration components</li><li>: Preventing invalid configurations</li><li>: Supporting complex data manipulations</li></ol><p>I know, I'm the 10,000 person to write this. Etcd has done a fine job, but it's a little crazy that it is the only tool for the job. For smaller clusters or smaller hardware configuration, it's a large use of resources in a cluster type where you will never hit the node count where it pays off. It's also a strange relationship between k8s and etcd now, where k8s is basically the only etcd customer left. </p><p>What I'm suggesting is taking the work of <a href=\"https://github.com/k3s-io/kine\" rel=\"noreferrer\">kine</a> and making it official. It makes sense for the long-term health of the project to have the ability to plug in more backends, adding this abstraction means it (should) be easier to swap in new/different backends in the future and it also allows for more specific tuning depending on the hardware I'm putting out there. </p><p>What I suspect this would end up looking like is much like this: <a href=\"https://github.com/canonical/k8s-dqlite\">https://github.com/canonical/k8s-dqlite</a>. Distributed SQlite in-memory with Raft consensus and almost zero upgrade work required that would allow cluster operators to have more flexibility with the persistence layer of their k8s installations. If you have a conventional server setup in a datacenter and etcd resource usage is not a problem, great! But this allows for lower-end k8s to be a nicer experience and (hopefully) reduces dependence on the etcd project. </p><h3>Beyond Helm: A Native Package Manager</h3><p>Helm is a perfect example of a temporary hack that has grown to be a permanent dependency. I'm grateful to the maintainers of Helm for all of their hard work, growing what was originally a hackathon project into the de-facto way to install software into k8s clusters. It has done as good a job as something could in fulfilling that role without having a deeper integration into k8s. </p><p>All that said, Helm is a nightmare to use. The Go templates are tricky to debug, often containing complex logic that results in really confusing error scenarios. The error messages you get from those scenarios are often gibberish. Helm isn't a very good package system because it fails at some of the basic tasks you need a package system to do, which are transitive dependencies and resolving conflicts between dependencies. </p><p>Tell me what this conditional logic is trying to do:</p><pre><code># A real-world example of complex conditional logic in Helm\n{{- if or (and .Values.rbac.create .Values.serviceAccount.create) (and .Values.rbac.create (not .Values.serviceAccount.create) .Values.serviceAccount.name) }}\napiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1\nkind: ClusterRole\nmetadata:\n  name: {{ template \"myapp.fullname\" . }}\n  labels:\n    {{- include \"myapp.labels\" . | nindent 4 }}\n{{- end }}</code></pre><p>Or if I provide multiple values files to my chart, which one wins:</p><pre><code>helm install myapp ./mychart -f values-dev.yaml -f values-override.yaml --set service.type=NodePort</code></pre><p>Ok, what if I want to manage my application and all the application dependencies with a Helm chart. This makes sense, I have an application that itself has dependencies on other stuff so I want to put them all together. So I define my sub-charts or umbrella charts inside of my Chart.yaml. </p><pre><code>dependencies:\n- name: nginx\n  version: \"1.2.3\"\n  repository: \"&lt;https://example.com/charts&gt;\"\n- name: memcached\n  version: \"1.2.3\"\n  repository: \"&lt;https://another.example.com/charts&gt;\"\n</code></pre><p>But assuming I have multiple applications, it's entirely possible that I have 2 services both with a dependency on nginx or whatever like this:</p><p>Helm doesn't handle this situation gracefully because template names are global with their templates loaded alphabetically. Basically you need to:</p><ul><li>Don't declare a dependency on the same chart more than once (hard to do for a lot of microservices)</li><li>If you do have the same chart declared multiple times, has to use the exact same version</li></ul><p>The list of issues goes on and on. </p><ul><li>Cross-Namespace installation stinks</li><li>Chart verification process is a pain and nobody uses it</li></ul><p>Let's just go to the front page of artifacthub:</p><p>I'll grab elasticsearch cause that seems important. </p><p>Seems  for the Official Elastic helm chart. Certainly  will be right, it's an absolute critical dependency for the entire industry. </p><p>Nope. Also how is the maintainer of the chart \"Kubernetes\" and it's  not marked as a . Like Christ how much more verified does it get.</p><ul><li>No metadata in chart searching. You can only search by name and description, not by features, capabilities, or other metadata.</li></ul><ul><li>Helm doesn't strictly enforce semantic versioning</li></ul><pre><code># Chart.yaml with non-semantic version\napiVersion: v2\nname: myapp\nversion: \"v1.2-alpha\" </code></pre><ul><li>If you uninstall and reinstall a chart with CRDs, it might delete resources created by those CRDs. This one has screwed me  and is crazy unsafe. </li></ul><p>I could keep writing for another 5000 words and still wouldn't have outlined all the problems. There isn't a way to make Helm good enough for the task of \"package manager for all the critical infrastructure on the planet\". </p><h4>What would a k8s package system look like?</h4><p>Let's call our hypothetical package system KubePkg, because if there's one thing the Kubernetes ecosystem needs, it's another abbreviated name with a 'K' in it. We would try to copy as much of the existing work inside the Linux ecosystem while taking advantage of the CRD power of k8s. My idea looks something like this:</p><p>The packages are bundles like a Linux package:</p><p>There's a definition file that accounts for as many of the real scenarios that you actually encounter when installing a thing. </p><pre><code>apiVersion: kubepkg.io/v1\nkind: Package\nmetadata:\n  name: postgresql\n  version: 14.5.2\nspec:\n  maintainer:\n    name: \"PostgreSQL Team\"\n    email: \"<a href=\"https://matduggan.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection\" data-cfemail=\"e8858981869c8981868d9a9ba898879b9c8f9a8d9b9984c68d90898598848dc68b8785\">[email&nbsp;protected]</a>\"\n  description: \"PostgreSQL database server\"\n  website: \"https://postgresql.org\"\n  license: \"PostgreSQL\"\n  \n  # Dependencies with semantic versioning\n  dependencies:\n    -

Not that many nodes!</li></ol><p>I am not suggesting the entire internet switches over to IPv6 and right now k8s happily supports IPv6-only if you want and a dualstack approach. But I'm saying now is the time to flip the default and just go IPv6.

AWS never needs to try and scrounge up more private IPv4 space inside of a VPC. That's gotta be worth something. </p><p>The common rebuttal to these ideas is, \"Kubernetes is an open platform, so the community can build these solutions.\" While true, this argument misses a crucial point: <strong>defaults are the most powerful force in technology.</strong> The \"happy path\" defined by the core project dictates how 90% of users will interact with it. If the system defaults to expecting signed packages and provides a robust, native way to manage them, that is what the ecosystem will adopt.</p><p>This is an ambitious list, I know. But if we're going to dream, let's dream big. After all, we're the industry that thought naming a technology 'Kubernetes' would catch on, and somehow it did!</p><p>We see this all the time in other areas like mobile developer and web development, where platforms assess their situation and make  jumps forward. Not all of these are necessarily projects that the maintainers or companies  take on but I think they're all ideas that  should at least revisit and think \"is it worth doing now that we're this nontrivial percentage of all datacenter operations on the planet\"? </p>","contentLength":23667,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/kubernetes/comments/1lf9s3f/what_would_a_kubernetes_20_look_like/"},{"title":"What Would a Kubernetes 2.0 Look Like","url":"https://matduggan.com/what-would-a-kubernetes-2-0-look-like/","date":1750336745,"author":"/u/LaFoudre250","guid":162881,"unread":true,"content":"<p>Around 2012-2013 I started to hear a  in the sysadmin community about a technology called \"Borg\". It was (apparently) some sort of Linux container system inside of Google that ran all of their stuff. The terminology was a bit baffling, with something called a \"Borglet\" inside of clusters with \"cells\" but the basics started to leak. There was a concept of \"services\" and a concept of \"jobs\", where applications could use services to respond to user requests and then jobs to complete batch jobs that ran for much longer periods of time. </p><p>Then on June 7th, 2014, we got our first commit of Kubernetes. The Greek word for 'helmsman' that absolutely no one could pronounce correctly for the first three years. (Is it koo-ber-NET-ees? koo-ber-NEET-ees? Just give up and call it k8s like the rest of us.) </p><p>Microsoft, RedHat, IBM, Docker join the Kubernetes community pretty quickly after this, which raised Kubernetes from an interesting Google thing to \"maybe this is a real product?\" On July 21st 2015 we got the v1.0 release as well as the creation of the CNCF. </p><p>In the ten years since that initial commit, Kubernetes has become a large part of my professional life. I use it at home, at work, on side projects—anywhere it makes sense. It's a tool with a steep learning curve, but it's also a massive force multiplier. We no longer \"manage infrastructure\" at the server level; everything is declarative, scalable, recoverable and (if you’re lucky) self-healing.</p><p>But the journey hasn't been without problems. Some common trends have emerged, where mistakes or misconfiguration arise from where Kubernetes isn't opinionated enough. Even ten years on, we're still seeing a lot of churn inside of ecosystem and people stepping on well-documented landmines. So, knowing what we know now, what could we do differently to make this great tool even more applicable to more people and problems? </p><p>Let's start with the positive stuff. Why are we still talking about this platform now? </p><p>Containers as a tool for software development make perfect sense. Ditch the confusion of individual laptop configuration and have one standard, disposable concept that works across the entire stack. While tools like Docker Compose allowed for some deployments of containers, they were clunky and still required you as the admin to manage a lot of the steps. I set up a Compose stack with a deployment script that would remove the instance from the load balancer, pull the new containers, make sure they started and then re-added it to the LB, as did lots of folks. </p><p>K8s allowed for this concept to scale out, meaning it was possible to take a container from your laptop and deploy an identical container across thousands of servers. This flexibility allowed organizations to revisit their entire design strategy, dropping monoliths and adopting more flexible (and often more complicated) micro-service designs. </p><p>If you think of the history of Operations as a sort of \"naming timeline from pets to cattle\", we started with what I affectionately call the \"Simpsons\" era. Servers were bare metal boxes set up by teams, they often had one-off names that became slang inside of teams and everything was a snowflake. The longer a server ran, the more cruft it picked up until it became a scary operation to even reboot them, much less attempt to rebuild them. I call it the \"Simpsons\" era because among the jobs I was working at the time, naming them after Simpsons characters was surprisingly common. Nothing fixed itself, everything was a manual operation. </p><p>Then we transition into the \"01 Era\". Tools like Puppet and Ansible have become common place, servers are more disposable and you start to see things like bastion hosts and other access control systems become the norm. Servers aren't all facing the internet, they're behind a load balancer and we've dropped the cute names for stuff like \"app01\" or \"vpn02\". Organizations designed it so they could lose some of their servers some of the time. However failures still weren't self-healing, someone still had to SSH in to see what broke, write up a fix in the tooling and then deploy it across the entire fleet. OS upgrades were still complicated affairs. </p><p>We're now in the \"UUID Era\". Servers exist to run containers, they are entirely disposable concepts. Nobody cares about how long a particular version of the OS is supported for, you just bake a new AMI and replace the entire machine. K8s wasn't the only technology enabling this, but it was the one that accelerated it. Now the idea of a bastion server with SSH keys that I go to the underlying server to fix problems is seen as more of a \"break-glass\" solution. Almost all solutions are \"destroy that Node, let k8s reorganize things as needed, make a new Node\". </p><p>A lot of the Linux skills that were critical to my career are largely nice to have now, not need to have. You can be happy or sad about that, I certainly switch between the two emotions on a regular basis, but it's just the truth. </p><p>The k8s jobs system isn't perfect, but it's so much better than the \"snowflake cron01 box\" that was an extremely common sight at jobs for years. Running on a cron schedule or running from a message queue, it was now possible to reliably put jobs into a queue, have them get run, have them restart if they didn't work and then move on with your life. </p><p>Not only does this free up humans from a time-consuming and boring task, but it's also simply a more efficient use of resources. You are still spinning up a pod for every item in the queue, but your teams have a lot of flexibility inside of the \"pod\" concept for what they need to run and how they want to run it. This has really been a quality of life improvement for a lot of people, myself included, who just need to be able to easily background tasks and not think about them again. </p><p><strong>Service Discoverability and Load Balancing</strong></p><p>Hard-coded IP addresses that lived inside of applications as the template for where requests should be routed has been a curse following me around for years. If you were lucky, these dependencies weren't based on IP address but were actually DNS entries and you could change the thing behind the DNS entry without coordinating a deployment of a million applications. </p><p>K8s allowed for simple DNS names to call other services. It removed an entire category of errors and hassle and simplified the entire thing down. With the Service API you had a stable, long lived IP and hostname that you could just point things towards and not think about any of the underlying concepts. You even have concepts like ExternalName that allow you to treat external services like they're in the cluster. </p><h2>What would I put in a Kubernetes 2.0?</h2><p>YAML was appealing because it wasn't JSON or XML, which is like saying your new car is great because it's neither a horse nor a unicycle. It demos nicer for k8s, looks nicer sitting in a repo and has the  of being a simple file format. In reality. YAML is just too much for what we're trying to do with k8s and it's not a safe enough format. Indentation is error-prone, the files don't scale great (you really don't want a super long YAML file), debugging can be annoying. YAML has  subtle behaviors outlined in its spec.</p><p>I still remember not believing what I was seeing the first time I saw the Norway Problem. For those lucky enough to not deal with it, the Norway Problem in YAML is when 'NO' gets interpreted as false. Imagine explaining to your Norwegian colleagues that their entire country evaluates to false in your configuration files. Add in accidental numbers from lack of quotes, the list goes on and on. There are much better posts on why YAML is crazy than I'm capable of writing: <a href=\"https://ruudvanasseldonk.com/2023/01/11/the-yaml-document-from-hell\">https://ruudvanasseldonk.com/2023/01/11/the-yaml-document-from-hell</a></p><p>HCL is already the format for Terraform, so at least we'd only have to hate one configuration language instead of two. It's strongly typed with explicit types. There's already good validation mechanisms. It is specifically designed to do the job that we are asking YAML to do and it's not much harder to read. It has built-in functions people are already using that would allow us to remove some of the third-party tooling from the YAML workflow. </p><p>I would wager 30% of Kubernetes clusters today are  being managed with HCL via Terraform. We don't need the Terraform part to get a lot of the benefits of a superior configuration language. </p><p>The only downsides are that HCL is slightly more verbose than YAML, and its Mozilla Public License 2.0 (MPL-2.0) would require careful legal review for integration into an Apache 2.0 project like Kubernetes. However, for the quality-of-life improvements it offers, these are hurdles worth clearing.</p><p>Let's take a simple YAML file. </p><pre><code># YAML doesn't enforce types\nreplicas: \"3\"  # String instead of integer\nresources:\n  limits:\n    memory: 512  # Missing unit suffix\n  requests:\n    cpu: 0.5m    # Typo in CPU unit (should be 500m)</code></pre><p>Even in the most basic example, there are footguns everywhere. HCL and the type system would catch all of these problems. </p><pre><code>replicas = 3  # Explicitly an integer\n\nresources {\n  limits {\n    memory = \"512Mi\"  # String for memory values\n  }\n  requests {\n    cpu = 0.5  # Number for CPU values\n  }\n}</code></pre><p>Take a YAML file like this that you probably have 6000 in your k8s repo. Now look at HCL without needing external tooling. </p><pre><code># Need external tools or templating for dynamic values\napiVersion: v1\nkind: ConfigMap\nmetadata:\n  name: app-config\ndata:\n  # Can't easily generate or transform values\n  DATABASE_URL: \"postgres://user:password@db:5432/mydb\"\n  API_KEY: \"static-key-value\"\n  TIMESTAMP: \"2023-06-18T00:00:00Z\"  # Hard-coded timestamp</code></pre><pre><code>resource \"kubernetes_config_map\" \"app_config\" {\n  metadata {\n    name = \"app-config\"\n  }\n  \n  data = {\n    DATABASE_URL = \"postgres://${var.db_user}:${var.db_password}@${var.db_host}:${var.db_port}/${var.db_name}\"\n    API_KEY      = var.api_key != \"\" ? var.api_key : random_string.api_key.result\n    TIMESTAMP    = timestamp()\n  }\n}\n\nresource \"random_string\" \"api_key\" {\n  length  = 32\n  special = false\n}</code></pre><p>Here's all the pros you get with this move. </p><ol><li>: Preventing type-related errors before deployment</li><li>: Reducing duplication and improving maintainability</li><li><strong>Functions and Expressions</strong>: Enabling dynamic configuration generation</li><li>: Supporting environment-specific configurations</li><li>: Simplifying repetitive configurations</li><li>: Improving documentation and readability</li><li>: Making errors easier to identify and fix</li><li>: Enabling reuse of configuration components</li><li>: Preventing invalid configurations</li><li>: Supporting complex data manipulations</li></ol><p>I know, I'm the 10,000 person to write this. Etcd has done a fine job, but it's a little crazy that it is the only tool for the job. For smaller clusters or smaller hardware configuration, it's a large use of resources in a cluster type where you will never hit the node count where it pays off. It's also a strange relationship between k8s and etcd now, where k8s is basically the only etcd customer left. </p><p>What I'm suggesting is taking the work of <a href=\"https://github.com/k3s-io/kine\" rel=\"noreferrer\">kine</a> and making it official. It makes sense for the long-term health of the project to have the ability to plug in more backends, adding this abstraction means it (should) be easier to swap in new/different backends in the future and it also allows for more specific tuning depending on the hardware I'm putting out there. </p><p>What I suspect this would end up looking like is much like this: <a href=\"https://github.com/canonical/k8s-dqlite\">https://github.com/canonical/k8s-dqlite</a>. Distributed SQlite in-memory with Raft consensus and almost zero upgrade work required that would allow cluster operators to have more flexibility with the persistence layer of their k8s installations. If you have a conventional server setup in a datacenter and etcd resource usage is not a problem, great! But this allows for lower-end k8s to be a nicer experience and (hopefully) reduces dependence on the etcd project. </p><h3>Beyond Helm: A Native Package Manager</h3><p>Helm is a perfect example of a temporary hack that has grown to be a permanent dependency. I'm grateful to the maintainers of Helm for all of their hard work, growing what was originally a hackathon project into the de-facto way to install software into k8s clusters. It has done as good a job as something could in fulfilling that role without having a deeper integration into k8s. </p><p>All that said, Helm is a nightmare to use. The Go templates are tricky to debug, often containing complex logic that results in really confusing error scenarios. The error messages you get from those scenarios are often gibberish. Helm isn't a very good package system because it fails at some of the basic tasks you need a package system to do, which are transitive dependencies and resolving conflicts between dependencies. </p><p>Tell me what this conditional logic is trying to do:</p><pre><code># A real-world example of complex conditional logic in Helm\n{{- if or (and .Values.rbac.create .Values.serviceAccount.create) (and .Values.rbac.create (not .Values.serviceAccount.create) .Values.serviceAccount.name) }}\napiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1\nkind: ClusterRole\nmetadata:\n  name: {{ template \"myapp.fullname\" . }}\n  labels:\n    {{- include \"myapp.labels\" . | nindent 4 }}\n{{- end }}</code></pre><p>Or if I provide multiple values files to my chart, which one wins:</p><pre><code>helm install myapp ./mychart -f values-dev.yaml -f values-override.yaml --set service.type=NodePort</code></pre><p>Ok, what if I want to manage my application and all the application dependencies with a Helm chart. This makes sense, I have an application that itself has dependencies on other stuff so I want to put them all together. So I define my sub-charts or umbrella charts inside of my Chart.yaml. </p><pre><code>dependencies:\n- name: nginx\n  version: \"1.2.3\"\n  repository: \"&lt;https://example.com/charts&gt;\"\n- name: memcached\n  version: \"1.2.3\"\n  repository: \"&lt;https://another.example.com/charts&gt;\"\n</code></pre><p>But assuming I have multiple applications, it's entirely possible that I have 2 services both with a dependency on nginx or whatever like this:</p><p>Helm doesn't handle this situation gracefully because template names are global with their templates loaded alphabetically. Basically you need to:</p><ul><li>Don't declare a dependency on the same chart more than once (hard to do for a lot of microservices)</li><li>If you do have the same chart declared multiple times, has to use the exact same version</li></ul><p>The list of issues goes on and on. </p><ul><li>Cross-Namespace installation stinks</li><li>Chart verification process is a pain and nobody uses it</li></ul><p>Let's just go to the front page of artifacthub:</p><p>I'll grab elasticsearch cause that seems important. </p><p>Seems  for the Official Elastic helm chart. Certainly  will be right, it's an absolute critical dependency for the entire industry. </p><p>Nope. Also how is the maintainer of the chart \"Kubernetes\" and it's  not marked as a . Like Christ how much more verified does it get.</p><ul><li>No metadata in chart searching. You can only search by name and description, not by features, capabilities, or other metadata.</li></ul><ul><li>Helm doesn't strictly enforce semantic versioning</li></ul><pre><code># Chart.yaml with non-semantic version\napiVersion: v2\nname: myapp\nversion: \"v1.2-alpha\" </code></pre><ul><li>If you uninstall and reinstall a chart with CRDs, it might delete resources created by those CRDs. This one has screwed me  and is crazy unsafe. </li></ul><p>I could keep writing for another 5000 words and still wouldn't have outlined all the problems. There isn't a way to make Helm good enough for the task of \"package manager for all the critical infrastructure on the planet\". </p><h4>What would a k8s package system look like?</h4><p>Let's call our hypothetical package system KubePkg, because if there's one thing the Kubernetes ecosystem needs, it's another abbreviated name with a 'K' in it. We would try to copy as much of the existing work inside the Linux ecosystem while taking advantage of the CRD power of k8s. My idea looks something like this:</p><p>The packages are bundles like a Linux package:</p><p>There's a definition file that accounts for as many of the real scenarios that you actually encounter when installing a thing. </p><pre><code>apiVersion: kubepkg.io/v1\nkind: Package\nmetadata:\n  name: postgresql\n  version: 14.5.2\nspec:\n  maintainer:\n    name: \"PostgreSQL Team\"\n    email: \"<a href=\"https://matduggan.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection\" data-cfemail=\"bad7dbd3d4cedbd3d4dfc8c9facad5c9ceddc8dfc9cbd694dfc2dbd7cad6df94d9d5d7\">[email&nbsp;protected]</a>\"\n  description: \"PostgreSQL database server\"\n  website: \"https://postgresql.org\"\n  license: \"PostgreSQL\"\n  \n  # Dependencies with semantic versioning\n  dependencies:\n    -

Remember: A company starting with a /20 subnet (4,096 addresses), deploys 40 nodes with 30 pods each, and suddenly realizes they're approaching their IP limit. Not that many nodes!</li></ol><p>I am not suggesting the entire internet switches over to IPv6 and right now k8s happily supports IPv6-only if you want and a dualstack approach. But I'm saying now is the time to flip the default and just go IPv6. You eliminate a huge collection of problems all at once. </p><ul><li>Flatter, less complicated network topology inside of the cluster. </li><li>The distinction between multiple clusters becomes a thing organizations can choose to ignore if they want if they want to get public IPs.</li><li>Easier to understand exactly the flow of traffic inside of your stack. </li></ul><p>It has nothing to do with driving IPv6 adoption across the entire globe and just an acknowledgement that we no longer live in a world where you have to accept the weird limitations of IPv4 in a universe where you may need 10,000 IPs suddenly with very little warning. </p><p>The benefits for organizations with public IPv6 addresses is pretty obvious, but there's enough value there for cloud providers and users that even the corporate overlords might get behind it. AWS never needs to try and scrounge up more private IPv4 space inside of a VPC. That's gotta be worth something. </p><p>The common rebuttal to these ideas is, \"Kubernetes is an open platform, so the community can build these solutions.\" While true, this argument misses a crucial point: <strong>defaults are the most powerful force in technology.</strong> The \"happy path\" defined by the core project dictates how 90% of users will interact with it. If the system defaults to expecting signed packages and provides a robust, native way to manage them, that is what the ecosystem will adopt.</p><p>This is an ambitious list, I know. But if we're going to dream, let's dream big. After all, we're the industry that thought naming a technology 'Kubernetes' would catch on, and somehow it did!</p><p>We see this all the time in other areas like mobile developer and web development, where platforms assess their situation and make  jumps forward.

Meet the software engineer who, despite being incarcerated, is making his mark in the tech world. His story is a testament to the belief that anyone, anywhere, can master complex programming languages.</p><p> recently stumbled upon this individual—an open-source contributor and coder with expertise in Rust and Python programming languages, and an avid Linux user—who continues to build and contribute to databases, even from behind bars.&nbsp;</p><p>What sounds like the plot of a movie is, in fact, the true story of <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/pthorpe92/\">Preston Thorpe</a>, a software engineer at Turso, an open-source distributed database powered by libSQL.  had the opportunity to speak exclusively with Thorpe, who opened up about his journey of programming during his time in prison.</p><h2>A Prisoner’s Attempt at a Better Outlook on Life Through Coding</h2><p>The 33-year-old software engineer spends his days working remotely from his prison cell in the Mountain View Correctional Facility in Charleston, Maine. Despite the confines of the facility, he has become a software engineer at Turso, actively contributing to projects like the rewrite of SQLite.&nbsp;</p><p>But his journey to this point has been far from conventional, driven by self-reflection, project-based learning, and an insatiable desire to improve. For nearly a decade, Thorpe was reportedly incarcerated for <a href=\"https://www.doj.nh.gov/news-and-media/preston-thorpe-sentenced-state-prison-possession-u-47700-synthetic-opioid-intent\">non-violent drug crimes</a>. However, instead of succumbing to the obvious hopelessness that often defines life behind bars, he discovered a sense of purpose through programming.</p><p>Explaining how it all started, Thorpe said, “There was one day, after spending a few years in the more calm and respectful environment in the Maine prison, where I had an epiphany and started questioning everything about my life.”</p><p>“I no longer knew why I had accepted that identity and situation, none of it made sense to me anymore, and I decided that I was no longer okay with being where I was or who I had become.”</p><p>Thorpe’s programming journey started with a simple but powerful resource: access to a computer through a prison college programme at the University of Maine at Augusta. With limited internet access and a passion to outgrow the curriculum in place, Thorpe created his own learning path.&nbsp;</p><p>He primarily attributes his success to project-based learning, having had just enough high school experience to understand what he needed to learn. His days were consumed by intense self-study, working on projects, and contributing to open-source software.</p><p>“I started in Python until I felt like I remembered enough of the basics, then moved to C and built very fundamental things like my own ‘standard library’ of data structures,” Thorpe said.&nbsp;</p><p>This project-based approach allowed him to learn the intricacies of various <a href=\"https://analyticsindiamag.com/ai-features/90-of-programming-languages-have-english-based-syntax/\">programming languages</a> while also developing practical tools that would serve as the foundation for his career.</p><p>Thorpe’s learning wasn’t restricted to just writing code. He immersed himself in the theory of computer science, reading academic papers, listening to lectures, and exploring the underlying architecture of software systems.&nbsp;</p><p>His interest in databases led him to explore relational databases, despite having no prior experience in the field. Thorpe explained that his database work initially involved logically isolated components, allowing him to focus on areas aligned with his existing knowledge.&nbsp;</p><p>His initial contributions included translating from Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) to bytecode and working on the Virtual DataBase Engine (VDBE). He didn’t immediately delve into specific database internals, often working on the IO layer or the command-line interface (CLI).&nbsp;</p><p>Thorpe also dedicated time to developing the extension library and <a href=\"https://analyticsindiamag.com/ai-features/why-developers-are-quietly-quitting-golang/\">Go language</a> bindings. Through a process of gradual familiarisation, extensive reading of research papers, and studying <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/c/CMUDatabaseGroup\">CMU lectures</a>, he built the confidence to explore diverse areas and implement features across the entire codebase.</p><p>In a <a href=\"https://turso.tech/blog/working-on-databases-from-prison\">recent blog post</a> on his company’s website, Thorpe highlighted, “I either write code or manage Kubernetes clusters or other infrastructure for about 90 hours a week, and my only entertainment is a daily hour of tech/programming YouTube.”</p><p>Thorpe’s self-driven journey took a pivotal turn when he was accepted into Maine’s remote work programme—a rare opportunity for imprisoned individuals to pursue legitimate employment outside the prison.</p><p>This programme became the gateway to his professional career in tech. “Because there was no precedent set for any of this, what I believe is the most crucial support was the fact that administrators took a chance and allowed me to earn their trust eventually,” he said.&nbsp;</p><p>His first job was with Unlocked Labs, a company focused on building educational technology for incarcerated individuals. Thorpe’s contributions there quickly gained recognition, and within a year, he was promoted to lead their development team.</p><p>Despite thriving in his role at Unlocked Labs, Thorpe’s ambition drove him to push even further. His exposure to the world of databases through various open-source projects eventually led him to Turso, a company working on rewriting SQLite.</p><h2>Grateful for the Absence of LLMs and Project-based Learning</h2><p>In today’s fast-evolving tech landscape, many developers turn to tools powered by large language models (LLMs) like <a href=\"https://analyticsindiamag.com/global-tech/anthropics-claude-code-has-been-writing-half-of-my-code/\">Claude Code</a> to speed up their learning and coding.&nbsp;</p><p>However, Thorpe views his lack of access to these tools during his learning years as a blessing in disguise. “I’m very grateful that LLMs are something that I did not have available to me for a large portion of my time learning,” he told .</p><p>“With the proper discipline, if it is a topic you are truly interested in, you can certainly use it to help teach you things, but I would worry for anyone who may be inclined to take shortcuts, as it could easily prevent learning as well.”</p><p>He firmly believes in the value of building real-world projects as a means of understanding and mastering programming concepts. He asserted that the knowledge gained from solving a problem and building a solution would surpass the learning acquired by breaking down each component and focusing on individual parts.</p><p>For Thorpe, learning didn’t just happen in isolation.

However, a robust pipeline requires a deep amount of\nhand-crafted integration work.</p><p>After all, there are many powerful and useful parts in a typical real-time\nanalytics toolchain. This is especially evident in use cases which combine\ninsights over a full historical dataset, while also needing to handle new data\nevery second from the real world.</p><p>While there are strong multi-product choices today, we want to know what would\nhappen if  tried to handle the full range of real-time\nanalytics challenges.</p><p>Can any emerging entrants become a true one-stop-shop solution?</p><p>To better understand the overall challenge, consider requirements behind an\n<a href=\"https://questdb.com/glossary/ohcl-candlestick\">open-high-low-close</a> (OHLC) or candlestick chart\nused for trading applications in financial markets. You can get a chart at\nvarious levels of detail: live updates from the current trading day, seamlessly\ncombined with the data from the past week, month, year, and so on.</p><p>To calculate the values for these charts, you have to partition the full dataset\ninto time slices of various sizes, and find the min/avg/max values for each\nslice. These time ranges can be significant.</p><p>This is an example of a general and versatile class of real-time analytics:\n<em><strong>aggregate functions over time slices</strong></em>.</p><p>There's a lot going on under-the-hood to make this work well and fast. To\nillustrate, we'll look at typical real-time analytics system design today, and\nthen we'll contrast that with a look at several database systems.</p><p>Like with financial charts, we tend to perform real-time analytics on a dataset\nthat is both massive and rapidly growing. This creates several tough challenges:</p><ol><li>Storing massive data volumes cheaply and effectively</li><li>Returning robust results at no more than few seconds of latency</li><li>Returning correct results after updates to existing data</li><li>Keeping data access to a minimum — access itself costs money</li></ol><p>As the volume of the collected data grows, storage costs balloon. Unless you\nhave your own datacenter and a team committed to continuously procuring and\nmaintaining storage devices and systems, you'll end up as a client of cloud\nstorage, such as Amazon S3, Azure Blob, or Google Cloud Storage.</p><p>This creates a barrier in your software stack — one type of storage for fresh\ndata, and another for historical data. You need a system that seamlessly jumps\nover the barrier and serves you the analytic results you need from any period\nyou want:</p><p>The cost of just keeping your data is relatively low, but the story quickly\nchanges once you need to access it. Your system must ensure it accesses only the\ndata which it absolutely needs.</p><p>Basically, if the data didn't change, you shouldn't need to access it again.\nThat's expensive and inefficient. Instead, it's better to store and reuse the\nresults of the analytics you performed once.</p><p>In this scenario, the greatest challenge is an update to the historical data:\nyou must keep the volume of accessed data low, and yet make sure you update\neverything that needs to be updated.</p><p>At the same time, the system must deal with the fresh data that just came in. It\nmust stay on top of possibly millions of events per second, and come up with the\nright answers about what just happened in the world.</p><p>In a typical modern setup, we are likely to use two separate systems, each\nspecialized in solving one challenge. We use Apache Kafka to ingest the data,\nand then fork the data pipeline so that one fork goes to the system optimized\nfor low-cost storage, and the other to the system optimized for real-time event\nprocessing.</p><p>For the recent data, we can use a stream processing engine like Apache Flink. It\ntakes in the events as they occur, aggregates them in memory, and outputs live\nresults with minimal latency:</p><p>For the historical data, the starting point is cheap storage. The primary choice\nfor most companies being cloud storage like S3 or Azure Blob Storage. This kind\nof storage comes with higher access latency. It's completely unstructured (the\nunit of data is a ), and immutable.</p><p>That means you need another system that builds upon this foundation to provide\nhigher-level services. One option is using a cloud-based data lake platform,\nlike Snowflake; another is an open-source analytics tool like Spark:</p><p>This kind of setup obviously has several moving parts, but there's even more\nwhen you take a closer look. For example, how do you access the output of\nrealtime stream processing?</p><p>A streaming engine like Apache Flink only solves the computation concern; its\noutput doesn't automatically come in a form ready for ad-hoc query access.</p><p>One option is storing the results in a general-purpose database, like Postgres.\nThen you can use the same database to store the results for historical data as\nwell, and finally there should be an API frontend component that queries the\ndatabase.</p><p>Another option is to treat Kafka itself as the source of truth. Flink outputs\nits results to a Kafka topic, and then the API frontend component loads them\ninto RAM and serves them. If the component fails, after restart it can just\nrescan the Kafka topic. It can also use a local, embedded database.</p><p>On the data lake side, the main challenge is doing the least amount of work\npossible while maintaining the correctness and completeness of the stored\nanalytics results. You can process the past day's worth of data during the\nnight, when the handover from the real-time system to the data lake occurs.</p><p>All these parts must account for, and be resilient to, failures. To manage this,\nyou need infrastructure that monitors operations and retries failed ones.</p><p>Putting it all together, we get a rough outline of a modern hybrid system for\nrealtime data analytics:</p><p>Since the need for real-time analytics has become mainstream and widespread,\nthere's an increasing demand for a simpler system, one that would automatically\nhandle both historical and new data in a uniform fashion, and simply provide you\nwith the results you want.</p><p>An emerging option for this workload is a streaming data lakehouse system.</p><p>Products from diverse categories have been converging on it, such as data lake\nproducts, real-time streaming engines, and time-series databases. Each one is\nadding features from the others, in a bid to build one complete, integrated\nsystem that handles all the concerns automatically:</p><p>We'll focus on systems that originate in the time-series database category.</p><p>In this category, the best paradigm for real-time analytics is that of the\n. A closely related concept is .</p><p>In its essence, a materialized view is a SQL query in solid-state form: its\nresults are persistent in a database table, available at no computation cost.\nYou can get them using a trivial query that doesn't need to spell out any of the\nbusiness logic needed to calculate them. A materialized view is as convenient to\ncreate as it is to access.</p><p>But to work for our use case, the database must make sure the materialized view\nis always up to date — and <strong>that's where things get interesting</strong>. Databases\nvary widely in their support for low-latency updates of materialized views, and\nthose that do have good support vary widely in their approaches.</p><p>We found the following databases to be good at low-latency materialized views:\nTimescaleDB, ClickHouse, and InfluxDB. At QuestDB, we've\n<a href=\"https://questdb.com/blog/how-to-create-a-materialized-view/\">recently introduced materialized views</a>,\nand are constantly improving their performance and ergonomics.</p><p>TimescaleDB is an extension on Postgres and thus benefits from its maturity.\nThis is how you implement continuous aggregation:</p><ol><li> with the desired query. This runs the query\nagainst the existing data, and saves it to the table you named.</li><li><code>SELECT add_continuous_aggregate_policy(...)</code> to schedule a task that updates\nthe materialized view at a fixed time interval.</li></ol><p>When you query the materialized view table, TimescaleDB uses a hybrid approach:\nit takes everything available from the table, and for anything that's missing it\nruns the aggregation query against the base table.</p><p>Thus, you always get the full results, regardless of when the scheduled task\nlast ran. However, the query's runtime will go up in proportion to the volume of\nthe missing materialized results.</p><p>Given this, you'll have to find a balance that minimizes the system load induced\nby the scheduled task, and the runtime of the query. The scheduled task can be\nconfigured to scan only a recent portion of the base table, which limits the\nimpact on system load, but leaves earlier data permanently stale. You can also\nschedule another, less frequent task that updates the full table.</p><p>We should also note that TimescaleDB, due to its Postgres fundamentals, isn't as\noptimized for the ingestion of massive amounts of time-series data. QuestDB\ntypically ingests data at a rate many multiples faster. It's also quite complex\nto scale horizontally. This negatively impacts the resource and maintenance\ncosts.</p><p>TimescaleDB supports tiered storage in its Cloud edition. Once properly set up,\nyou can query the data across tiers transparently. However, setup and\nconfiguration is quite involved and requires knowledge of both Postgres and\nTimecaleDB concepts. You can't directly update the data in cold storage. You\nmust go through the manual steps of \"un-tiering\" it, updating and \"re-tiering\"\nit.</p><p>TimescaleDB benefits from the maturity of Postgres in terms of the support for\nmonitoring and diagnostics of the tasks that keep the materialized view up to\ndate. You can also integrate with Prometheus.</p><p>ClickHouse also supports , but with completely\ndifferent semantics. This is how you use it:</p><ol><li>Manually  that will hold the materialized view. Specify the\ncorrect table engine: .</li><li><code>CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW ...</code> — this sets up a scheduled task that will run\nwhenever you insert new data, and specifies the aggregation expression.\nExisting data won't be processed.</li><li>Manually backfill the table with existing data.</li></ol><p>Since ClickHouse runs the aggregation whenever you insert data, the latency of\nthe aggregated results is very low. However, updates and deletions aren't\nreflected and need to be handled manually.</p><p>ClickHouse supports tiered storage in its Cloud edition. It will automatically\nmove the older data to cold storage using its TTL feature. You can't directly\nupdate the data in cold storage, you must take manual steps to move it back to\nhot storage, delete the outdated data, insert data with updates, and move back\nto cold storage.</p><p>The materialized view table is like any other, and allows arbitrary\ninsert/update/delete actions, as well as schema changes. This makes it prone to\nincorrect data and errors in the continuous aggregation process.</p><p>ClickHouse is great at raw ingestion performance, but compared to TimescaleDB,\nit's not as mature for monitoring, diagnostics, and issue resolution.</p><p>All told, maintaining a large number of materialized views is a complex task,\nwith lots of hand-crafted code and tooling needed.</p><p>Basic steps to create continuous aggregation in InfluxDB resemble those for\nClickHouse:</p><ol><li>Create the destination table ( in InfluxDB terminology)</li><li>Create a scheduled task that runs continuous aggregation</li><li>Manually backfill the existing data</li></ol><p>Unlike ClickHouse, and more similar to TimescaleDB, this task runs on a fixed\ntime-interval schedule and isn't triggered by inserts. It only looks at the\nrecent data, and you can configure exactly how recent. It doesn't automatically\nbackfill, so it requires a manual backfill step.</p><p>This mechanism creates a conflict between low latency and low system load,\nbecause you have to set a short interval to get low latency. But on the\nflip-side, the task will rescan the whole specified range every time. Unlike\nTimescaleDB, there's no hybrid mechanism that fills the gaps by running a query\non the base table.</p><p>InfluxDB supports tiered storage in its Enterprise and Cloud editions. You can\nset up a data retention policy that copies the data to cold storage, where it\nremains available for querying.</p><p>Since InfluxDB is purpose-made for monitoring and alerting, the support in this\narea is solid. To this end, the company developed a whole ecosystem of tools:\nTelegraf, Chronograf, and Kapacitor.</p><p>InfluxDB's main drawback is widely considered to be its lack of full SQL\nsupport. Given that it requires its own DSL, it gives the impression of a\nspecial purpose tool. While it supports the use case of continuous aggregation\nitself, there's less support for more general and powerful data analytics on the\nsame dataset.</p><p>So, InfluxDB alone usually isn't enough for all the things you need to do with\nthe data.</p><p>With QuestDB, there's only one step to set up continuous aggregation:</p><ol><li><code>CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW ...</code></li></ol><p>This creates the materialized view table, backfills it with the results of\nprocessing the existing data, and sets up the aggregation task to run on all\nchanges to the base table, including updates and deletions. The task is fired\nimmediately when changes occur, but it may be delayed when system load is high.</p><p>This simplicity is a key part of QuestDB's vision for a single-source real-time\nanalytics system. By handling both historical and fresh data through the same\nmaterialized view mechanism, we eliminate the need for separate systems and\ncomplex integration work. Whether you're querying data from last year or the\nlast second, you use the same SQL interface and get consistent results.</p><p>Another nice aspect of QuestDB's materialized views is that you can cascade them\n— a materialized view's base table can be another materialized view. This allows\nyou to create a very efficient pipeline of aggregations at different levels of\ngranularity.</p><p>QuestDB keeps maintainability in focus and exposes the status of materialized\nviews through the SQL interface:</p><div><div><div><pre></pre></div></div></div><p>With this, you can monitor refresh lag, and detect and diagnose failures.</p><p>While the computations you can use with materialized views are limited to\naggregate functions over time slices, QuestDB's general querying power is quite\nrobust. It supports JOINs, window functions, Common Table Expressions, nested\nSELECT expressions, and so on.</p><p>However, in the current version (8.3.1), QuestDB's materialized views aren't\nvery resilient to schema evolution. The materialized view will get invalidated\nif you DROP or ALTER a column, even when the materialized view doesn't depend on\nit.</p><p>QuestDB supports tiered storage in its Enterprise edition. It can keep your data\nin cold storage, in Parquet format, and query it without converting back to its\nnative format.</p><p>Overall, this is a significant step forward for this use case, and its\nnear-future roadmap contains some improvements:</p><ul><li><p>Better resilience of materialized views to schema evolution. You'll be able to\nmanipulate non-dependency columns without breaking the materialized view.</p></li><li><p>Support for a refresh policy based on a fixed time interval. If you align it\nwith the time slice interval, this will ensure the materialized view is always\nfresh, with significantly less impact on system load.</p></li></ul><p>The journey from complex, multi-system architectures to unified solutions is\nwell underway. Each database we examined brings valuable pieces to the puzzle:\nTimescaleDB's hybrid query approach, ClickHouse's raw performance, InfluxDB's\nmonitoring expertise, and QuestDB's simplified materialized views.</p><p>The database systems we reviewed all seem to have many building blocks needed,\nbut none of them seems to be fully ready to take over the all-in-one real-time\nanalytics system.</p><p>The ideal system would combine the best of these approaches: effortless setup\nand maintenance, consistent performance across all data ages, and a single\ninterface for both real-time and historical analytics. While we're not quite\nthere yet, the convergence of these technologies suggests that the one-stop-shop\nsolution for real-time analytics is within reach.</p><p>As these systems continue to evolve and borrow from each other's strengths, we\ncan expect to see more solutions that truly unify the real-time analytics\nexperience. The future belongs to systems that can handle the full spectrum of\nanalytics needs without requiring complex integration work or specialized\nknowledge of multiple technologies.</p>","contentLength":16035,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/1lf6a3k/realtime_analytics_with_an_allinone_system_are_we/"},{"title":"LiveKit Agent - workers auto dispatch issue in deployment","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/kubernetes/comments/1lf68jn/livekit_agent_workers_auto_dispatch_issue_in/","date":1750324231,"author":"/u/InbaKrish007","guid":162911,"unread":true,"content":"<p>I have issue on the LiveKit agents deployment.</p><p>we are using Kubernetes setup with 4 pods (replica) each with below resources config, <code>yaml resources: requests: cpu: \"4\" memory: \"8Gi\" limits: cpu: \"4\" memory: \"8Gi\" </code></p><p>so that it should accept 25 to 30 concurrent sessions per pod and multiplied by 4 on total.</p><p>For Server we are using the LiveKit's cloud offering with free trail (mentions that 100 concurrent connections are provided).</p><p>Though we have this setup, on connecting 2 concurrent sessions, 3rd and upcoming sessions are not getting handled, the client side (built with client-sdk-js), creates a room with the LiveKit JWT token (generated from Ruby server), but the agent is not getting dispatched and joins the room.</p><p>-&gt; We have not modified any workeroptions in the LiveKit agents backend. -&gt; With Ruby server, we generate the the token with the logic below, ```ruby room = LivekitServer::Room.new(params[\"room_name\"]) participant = LivekitServer::Participant.new(**participant_params) token = room.create_access_token(participant:, time_to_live:) render json: { access_token: token.to_jwt }</p><p>def create_access_token(participant:, time_to_live: DEFAULT_TOKEN_TTL, video_grant: default_video_grant) token = LiveKit::AccessToken.new(ttl: time_to_live) token.identity = participant.identity token.name = participant.name token.video_grant = video_grant token.attributes = participant.attributes token end</p><p>def default_video_grant LiveKit::VideoGrant.new(roomJoin: true, room: name, canPublish: true, canPublishData: true, canSubscribe: true) end json { \"name\": \"user\", \"attributes\": { \"modality\": \"TEXT\" }, \"video\": { \"roomJoin\": true, \"room\": \"lr5x2n8epp\", \"canPublish\": true, \"canSubscribe\": true, \"canPublishData\": true }, \"exp\": 1750233704, \"nbf\": 1750230099, \"iss\": \"APIpcgNpfMyH9Eb\", \"sub\": \"anonymous\" } ```</p><p>What am I missing here?

At the time, in my eyes, it was a revolution: the ability to see the code, contribute, fork it, and give a project a new direction - perhaps a parallel one, or something completely different.</p><p>Like OpenBSD from NetBSD, DragonflyBSD from FreeBSD, or Nextcloud from Owncloud - the examples are endless. It was about freedom, the chance to be part of something or, in some cases, at the very center of something: its development.</p><p>To me, Open Source meant having the chance to develop an idea and find other people who shared it, turning what was just a project in my mind into a reality. All without needing big funding, a business plan, or having to risk anything. Just the pleasure of doing it and the joy of seeing it come to life. A waking dream.</p><p>Over time, I witnessed many exchanges of opinion - some of them quite heated - that led to hard forks or uncomfortable situations within development teams. People leaving, others taking over - you name it. But, in the end, the software was always at the center. It was an ideological battle over how to implement something (or how NOT to implement it).</p><p>This led to some fantastic pairings: Linux, a kernel without an operating system, and GNU, an operating system without a stable and complete kernel. Together, they revolutionized the world, changed the concept of computing, and proved that yes, Open Source works and produces quality software - often of a far greater quality than many of its closed-source, commercial counterparts.</p><p>And yet, there were the \"distro wars\" - and I didn't understand them. And if I didn't understand the distro wars back then, the situation today seems even more extreme. I appreciated the variety, the different ideas, and the different approaches, but never the fanaticism. I was a strong supporter of Debian, but I couldn't understand those who openly attacked alternatives (like Red Hat, at the time, or Suse). I thought: use what you like, contribute if you want but... hey, it's Open Source, you don't pay for it, you're not forced, just choose what you like best! If you're happy, tell the world. If you're dissatisfied, switch (to different software) or change THE software (meaning, implement what you think is necessary). But why wage war on others, on those with different ideas who made different choices? Is it the general polarization fueled by social media? Is it because Open Source has become more mainstream, bringing with it users who have a \"consumer\" mindset rather than a \"collaborator\" one?</p><p>And yet, there are still positive examples out there — quiet, solid, and often overlooked. The BSD projects, for instance, show us that it's still possible to diverge in philosophy and approach without descending into hostility. FreeBSD, OpenBSD, and NetBSD took different paths. And yet, there are no \"wars\" between them. Their communities may disagree on technical choices, but they coexist with mutual respect. You rarely see a FreeBSD user shouting \"OpenBSD must die!\" or a NetBSD developer trolling others on social media. The tone is sober, the work is steady, and the focus remains on the code and its quality - not on brand wars or personal egos.</p><p>This is the spirit I fell in love with: different ideas, mutual respect, and the shared goal of building something useful and free. We may not all agree on everything, but we can still build in parallel, learn from each other, and avoid turning diversity into division.</p><p>Lately, all of this is becoming truly extreme. I read, for example, sharp and violent opinions from Wayland users against X11 (Xorg, etc.) - \"it must die!\" But, I wonder, why this violence?</p><p>I use Wayland on Linux and X11 on FreeBSD - both on the same computer, both with satisfaction. Why should I hate one of them? If I don't like it... I simply don't use it.</p><p>The world is becoming increasingly polarized and bitter, making people less and less inclined towards dialogue or tolerance for those with different ideas or positions. But, I ask myself, why should this be happening in the world of Open Source?</p><p>We are all in the same boat. We have the tools, the freedom of choice, and it costs us nothing. If we don't like a solution, we can say so and choose something else. Why this violence?  Who benefits?</p><p>When we fight violently over Open Source software, when we lash out with intolerance against a solution we dislike, the entire Open Source world loses an opportunity. The opportunity to reduce the chances of ending up in a computing monoculture, the opportunity to have a choice, the opportunity for someone to listen to our well-reasoned observations and learn from them.</p><p>It's up to us, every day, with every comment and contribution, to decide whether we want to build bridges or raise walls.</p>","contentLength":4776,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/1lf3u9y/from_collaborators_to_consumers_have_we_killed/"},{"title":"I was reading this bash guide on GitHub, and found this:","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/1lf2drq/i_was_reading_this_bash_guide_on_github_and_found/","date":1750309290,"author":"/u/rev155","guid":162575,"unread":true,"content":"","contentLength":0,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Should I switch from Python to Go for Discord bots?","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1lf22ab/should_i_switch_from_python_to_go_for_discord_bots/","date":1750308164,"author":"/u/GladJellyfish9752","guid":162717,"unread":true,"content":"<p>So I know Python and Rust pretty well, can handle JavaScript okay, and I've messed around with Go a little bit.

Meaning that you can write a build task once in  and reference it from  — or, even better, rely on Zed's automatic configuration.</p><p>Zed automatically runs locators on built-in or language server-generated runnables, so in many cases you won't even need to write a debug configuration to get up and running.</p><p>We currently support locators for Cargo, Python, JavaScript, and Go, with more coming in the future.\nFor more information on configuring a debug session, <a href=\"https://zed.dev/docs/debugger\">see our documentation</a>.</p><p>Once in a debug session, Zed makes it easy to inspect your program's state, such as threads, variables, breakpoints, the call stack, and more.</p><div><figure><figcaption>Setting some breakpoints and running the test in a debug session.</figcaption></figure></div><p>The debugger panel is fully customizable too, just drag and rearrange tabs in whatever order you want; you can even move the debug panel around so it fits your workflow.</p><p>Zed also supports keyboard-driven debugging for users that prefer to keep their hands on the keyboard.\nYou can step through code, toggle breakpoints, and navigate a debug session without ever touching the mouse.</p><div><figure><figcaption>Navigating through the Debugger surfaces using only the keyboard.</figcaption></figure></div><p>Special thanks to <a href=\"https://github.com/RemcoSmitsDev\">Remco Smits</a> for driving a lot of the heavy lifting on this project—your contributions have been critical to getting us here.</p><p>Zed's debugger supports debugging a variety of languages through the Debug Adapter Protocol.\nBut simply implementing the protocol wasn't enough—we needed an architecture that could scale to collaborative debugging, support extensions, and efficiently cache and manage responses from debug adapters.</p><p>To achieve this, we built a two-layer architecture: a data layer that communicates directly with the debug adapters, and a UI layer that fetches data from the data layer to render the interface.</p><figure data-rehype-pretty-code-figure=\"\"><div><pre><code data-language=\"rust\" data-theme=\"dark-plus light-plus\"></code></pre></div></figure><figure data-rehype-pretty-code-figure=\"\"><div><pre><code data-language=\"rust\" data-theme=\"dark-plus light-plus\"></code></pre></div></figure><p>This separation means the UI layer only requests what it needs, allowing the data layer to lazily fetch information and avoid unnecessary requests.\nIt also makes the data layer solely responsible for maintaining session state, caching responses, and invalidating stale data.\nThis architecture will make implementing collaborative debugging significantly easier, since the same UI code can be reused across multiplayer sessions—and we only send essential data across the wire, preserving bandwidth.</p><p>Supporting every debug adapter out of the box wasn't feasible—there are over <a href=\"https://microsoft.github.io/debug-adapter-protocol/implementors/adapters/\">70 DAP implementations</a>, each with its own quirks.\nTo solve this, we <a href=\"https://zed.dev/docs/extensions/debugger-extensions\">extended</a> Zed's extension API to support debugger integration.</p><figure data-rehype-pretty-code-figure=\"\"><div><pre><code data-language=\"rust\" data-theme=\"dark-plus light-plus\"></code></pre></div></figure><p>Adding DAP support via an extension involves defining a custom schema that integrates with our JSON server, implementing logic for downloading and launching the adapter, processing debug configuration to add sane default values, and integrating with locators for automatic configuration.\nThis design follows our approach to LSP extensions, giving extension authors full control to bring their own debug adapters to Zed with minimal friction.</p><p>We also wanted inline variable values to work out of the box.\nSurprisingly, the <a href=\"https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specifications/lsp/3.17/specification/#textDocument_inlineValue\">inline values request</a> is a part of the <a href=\"https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/\">Language Server Protocol (LSP)</a> instead of the DAP.\nUsing the inline values approach would limit Zed to only showing inline values for DAPs which integrate with LSPs, which isn't many.\nA naive workaround might be to use regular expressions to match variable names between the source code and debugger values, but that quickly breaks down when dealing with scopes, and comments.\nInstead, we turned to <a href=\"https://tree-sitter.github.io/tree-sitter/\">Tree-sitter</a>. After all Zed is built by the creators of Tree-sitter!</p><p>Through Tree-sitter queries, we can accurately identify variables within the current execution scope, and easily support any language through  files without relying on an LSP server to be tightly integrated with a debug adapter.\nAt launch, inline values are supported for Python, Rust, and Go.\nMore languages will be supported in the coming weeks.</p><p>When we set out to build the debugger, we wanted to make it seamless to use, out of the way, and in line with Zed's high standard of quality.\nNow that we've built a strong foundation that is compatible with any debug adapter, we're ready to explore and implement advanced features such as:</p><ul><li>New views: While we support all the fundamental views, we're planning on adding more advanced views such as a watch list, memory view, disassembly view, and a stack trace view</li><li>Automatic configuration: We're going to add support for more languages and build systems</li></ul>","contentLength":5185,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1leystq/the_debugger_is_here_zed_blog/"},{"title":"Implementing a convolutional neural network from scratch with no libraries","url":"https://deadbeef.io/cnn_from_scratch","date":1750294884,"author":"/u/LlaroLlethri","guid":162682,"unread":true,"content":"<p>An unknown error occurred.</p>","contentLength":26,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/1lexu30/implementing_a_convolutional_neural_network_from/"},{"title":"[D] What tasks don’t you trust zero-shot LLMs to handle reliably?","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1lewzg7/d_what_tasks_dont_you_trust_zeroshot_llms_to/","date":1750292387,"author":"/u/WristbandYang","guid":161759,"unread":true,"content":"<p>For some context I’ve been working on a number of NLP projects lately (classifying textual conversation data).

I have recently been learning Go after coming from learning some C before that, and mainly using Python, bash etc. for work. I make this post in the hope that someone also learning Go who might encounter this conceptual barrier I had might benefit.</p><p>I was struggling with wrapping my head around the concept of interfaces. I understood that any struct can implement an interface as long as it has all the methods that the interface has, then you can pass that interface to a function.</p><p>What I didn't know was that if a function is expecting an interface, that basically means that it is expecting a type that implements an interface. Since an interface is just a signature of a number of different methods, you can also pass in a different interface to that function as long as it still implements all those methods expected in the function argument. </p><p>Found that out the hard way while trying to figure out how on earth an interface of type  could still be accepted as an argument to the  method.
