I think the origin of these claims is <a href=\"https://x.com/toshiHQ/status/1889928670887739902\">this post</a>:</p><blockquote><p>It looks like Elon’s genius coders don’t know how COBOL works.</p><p>Social security runs on COBOL, which does not use a date or time type.  So the date is stored as a number using the ISO 8601 standard.  The epoch for this is 150 years ago (1875) - aka the metre standard.</p><p>So if you don’t know the date of something, it will be a 0 value, which in COBOL will default to 1875 - 150 years ago.</p></blockquote><p>I don’t think this is true, for a few reasons.</p><h2>The database has years of birth before 1875</h2><p>In 2007 the SSA <a href=\"https://www.ssa.gov/policy/docs/ssb/v71n4/v71n4p33.html\">released a dataset</a> “containing earnings records for individuals drawn from a 1-percent sample of all Social Security numbers (SSNs) issued before January 2007”. They wrote:</p><blockquote><p>The final adjustments included removing 5,935 individuals whose [Year Of Birth] value was before 1870, removing 1,096 individuals whose YOB value was equal to 2007, and removing 4 individuals who were assigned a missing YOB value. Individuals born before 1870 were removed because they were unlikely to have received Social Security benefits.</p></blockquote><p>They explictly say they have records of individuals born in 1869 and earlier, and that they can represent missing birth years!</p><h2>There is no spike of births in 1875</h2><p>There is no spike in births in 1875 in that dataset, which you would expect if some process was setting unknown births to 1875:</p><p>The dataset is a 1% sample, so the actual amounts are ~100x larger.</p><h2>The SSA doesn’t use ISO 8601</h2><p>The Master Beneficiary Record, which tracks social security benefits payments, <a href=\"https://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/pdf/10.2105/AJPH.73.11.1270\">was created in 1962</a> -  ISO 8601 was first published in 1988. The predecessor to that standard, ISO 2016 was published in 1976 - still too early, and also it has no reference any date in 1875.</p><p><a href=\"https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC1651155/pdf/amjph00646-0038.pdf\">This research paper</a> based on SSA data said that the SSA stores birthdays in a fixed-width format:</p><blockquote><p>The data abstracted from the MBR consisted of a 26-character record for each deceased individual. The four data\nitems on each record were… the month and year of death.</p></blockquote><p>None of the datasets published by the SSA I found used ISO 8601 dates either; all of them have a seperate column for year of birth instead of using an ISO 8601 birthdate.</p><h2>ISO 8601 doesn’t have an epoch</h2><p>ISO 8601 is a format for representing dates as strings, not as numbers. It has no need for an epoch.</p><blockquote><p>ISO 8601:2004 fixes a reference calendar date to the Gregorian calendar of 20 May 1875 as the date the Convention du Mètre (Metre Convention) was signed in Paris (the explicit reference date was removed in ISO 8601-1:2019). However, ISO calendar dates before the convention are still compatible with the Gregorian calendar all the way back to the official introduction of the Gregorian calendar on 15 October 1582.</p></blockquote><p>I.e. the standard only uses 20 May 1875 as a reference date to define the Gregorian calendar, not as some earliest representable date.</p><h2>Nobody uses 1875 as an epoch</h2><p>I had found no evidence of 1875 ever being used as an epoch to start counting time from, in any context. I tried to find any case of this happening but I couldn’t find any.

I get why people think it- software engineers\nhave been trained to lean into open-source tooling, and the AI ecosystem is\nundoubtably strongest in Python.</p><p>But if you don’t already use Python, switching languages for the ecosystem is\nlikely a bad call. Not only is that ecosystem less mature than it seems (who\ngenuinely has enough experience to build an opinionated agent-framework at this\npoint?), but it is grounded more in a research/ML perspective than a product\none.</p><p>Additionally, the language itself is a poor fit for AI products! Python\nconcurrency can be tricky, which is going to hurt you when it comes to\noptimising the latency of your AI systems, and a static type-system can bring\nsome much-needed structure to non-deterministic models.</p><p>At incident.io, we use Go for all our backend, and saw no reason why AI should\nbe any different. Go has been a fantastic choice, helping us <a href=\"https://incident.io/ai\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">build AI\nsystems</a> that spawn concurrent prompts, speculatively execute tools, and instrument\neverything to the hilt.</p><p>Despite Go being known as a no-frills language, we’ve built some really\nergonomic abstractions that make working with AI really easy. I expect you can\ndo it in your native language, too.</p><p>Here’s an example of a prompt in our codebase:</p><div><div><pre><code></code></pre></div></div><p>Each prompt is its own struct, describing which model to use, the input type\nthat we use to template the messages, and finally the prompt that we’ll send to\nOpenAI (or Anthropic, GCP, whatever).</p><p>What I love about this is how much heavy lifting the type system is doing for\nus. Running the prompt is as simple as:</p><div><div><pre><code></code></pre></div></div><p>Behind the scenes,  is doing some cool stuff:</p><ol><li>It reflects over our  type to build an OpenAPI specification, using\nstruct tags like  and  as documentation.</li><li>That specification is used to force the model into giving structured JSON\nresponses that match our type exactly.</li><li>The prompt is templated with our .</li><li>Finally, the response is parsed back into our result type.</li></ol><p>Each prompt lives in its own file () alongside its evaluation\nsuite (), making it easy to maintain and test.</p><p>The pattern above works great for fixed prompts, but sometimes you need more\nflexibility. That’s where Go’s generics come in handy.</p><p>Here’s an example from our incident investigation system:</p><div><div><pre><code></code></pre></div></div><p>We’re using  across our <a href=\"https://incident.io/ai#investigations\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">investigation\nsystem</a>, but each time we run it we want different types of\nresults back. Sometimes we want permalinks to code changes, other times we’re\nextracting timeline entries, or grading the quality of our investigation\nhypothesis.</p><p>Rather than copy-and-pasting the prompt in order to use the same context setup,\nwe can use a generic type parameter to control the result we get back. The\nprompt template and core logic stays the same, but we get different structured\ndata back each time.</p><p>That’s as close as we’ll get to Vercel’s  in Go, and I’d say\nit’s a strong challenger.</p><h2>Python is not the only answer</h2><p>Python is a great tool for machine learning and a lot more. But it has real\nweaknesses when it comes to building production AI systems, especially if you’re\nalready working in a different language.</p><p>I’ve spoken with several teams who switched to Python to work with AI, away from\ntheir normal stack, and they’ve all struggled. They’re trying to learn AI\nalongside new tools and patterns (<a href=\"https://blog.lawrencejones.dev/learn-one-thing/\">almost always a bad idea</a>), which\nmakes it much more likely they burn out or fail.</p><p>Even if they succeed, they’ve disconnected their AI features from their core\nproduct. These are companies aiming to be “AI native” but have their AI features\nliving in a separate codebase with different conventions. That doesn’t feel like\nsuccess to me.</p><p>At incident.io, we kept everything in Go and it’s working really well. Our AI\nfeatures live right alongside our core product, using the same development\npatterns the team already knows. We’ve even managed building some expressive and\nfancy abstractions in a language that is notoriously no-frills, while leveraging\nGo’s strengths in concurrency and type safety.</p><p>The AI ecosystem will continue to be Python-first, and that’s fine! The actual\ninteraction with models is just HTTP requests with JSON payloads, though. Build\ngood abstractions in your language of choice, and focus your energy on the hard\nstuff: <a href=\"https://blog.lawrencejones.dev/ai-mvp/\">making AI features that actually work</a>.</p><p><em>\n        \n        If you liked this post and want to see more, follow me at <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://twitter.com/lawrjones\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">@lawrjones</a>.\n      </em></p>","contentLength":4436,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1iqtugn/writing_llm_prompts_in_go_with_typesafety/"},{"title":"Starting a Weekly Rancher Series – From Zero to Hero!","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/kubernetes/comments/1iqtpjc/starting_a_weekly_rancher_series_from_zero_to_hero/","date":1739717223,"author":"/u/abhimanyu_saharan","guid":650,"unread":true,"content":"<p>I'm kicking off a weekly YouTube series on Rancher, covering everything from getting started to advanced use cases.

Let’s get straight into them. </p><p>Tech changes fast, but certain principles stay the same.</p><p>These lessons have helped me navigate challenges at work, grow as a professional, and deliver results. Maybe they’ll help you too.</p><p>Here are 15 lessons I’ve learned along the way:</p><p>One common mistake I've observed repeatedly is projects being driven by technical enthusiasm rather than product necessity. </p><p>Engineers often dive into building features without fully understanding whether they address real user needs or business problems. Document assumptions and validate them before writing code. </p><p>Project cancellations are incredibly painful for everyone, and they’re often the result of brilliant tech solving the wrong problem.</p><blockquote></blockquote><p>Not every piece of technical debt needs fixing. Not every feature deserves building. Sometimes, doing nothing is the best move. Prioritisation means choosing from the endless things teams “should” do, and selecting the few things that really matter.</p><blockquote><p>Key Takeaway: Ask \"What happens if we do nothing?\" to gain perspective on priorities. Often, the answer reveals that urgent-feeling work isn't actually important.</p></blockquote><p>Heated debates over the perfect language, architecture or framework often miss the point entirely. Every technical decision involves trade-offs: speed vs. maintainability, simplicity vs. flexibility, familiar tools vs. better technology.</p><blockquote><p>Key Takeaway: The goal isn’t perfection, it’s finding the right balance of trade-offs for your specific context.</p></blockquote><p>As engineers, we love sophisticated solutions. Microservices, event-driven architectures, the latest trends. But simpler approaches often prove more resilient and maintainable. </p><p>Remember: you build once, but maintain forever. You might be happy about that clever solution now but you won’t be when your pager goes off at 2am.</p><blockquote><p>Key Takeaway: Start simple. Only add complexity when absolutely necessary. Simpler systems are easier to understand, debug, and extend.</p></blockquote><p>Understanding the business isn’t optional, it’s critical for making sound technical decisions. The more you know about the business, the more opportunities you’ll find to grow your career.</p><blockquote><p>Key Takeaway: Invest time in learning your company’s business model, market constraints, and strategy.</p></blockquote><p>Want to accelerate your career? Focus on helping others succeed. Thoughtfully review pull requests, ask your manager what they need help with, jump in when someone’s stuck, and freely share knowledge. </p><p>Helping others makes you more valuable, helps you learn faster, and also creates a better work environment.</p><blockquote><p>Key Takeaway: People notice those that help others. Managers, engineers, and even executives. Build a reputation for being helpful.</p></blockquote><p>When people fear mistakes, they stop taking initiative. When they fear questions, they waste time struggling alone. </p><p>Operational post mortems and retrospectives are great ways to help teams learn from mistakes. Make sure people aren’t afraid to ask for help, ask questions, or share their opinions.</p><blockquote><p>Key Takeaway: Create an environment where people feel safe to take risks, admit errors, and challenge ideas.</p></blockquote><p>A lesson I keep learning is that the fastest way to learn is from others who are ahead of you. Equally important, mentoring others builds your own understanding. Teaching others is the best way to learn.</p><blockquote><p>Key Takeaway: Learn from those ahead of you, then pay it forward by guiding those behind you.</p></blockquote><p>Titles are lagging indicators of impact. Don’t be intimidated by titles or years of experience. Act like a senior before you are one. Focus on delivering meaningful contributions, solving problems, improving processes, and supporting your team. </p><p>The people who progress rapidly are the ones who start acting as leaders or seniors before they have the title.</p><blockquote><p>Key Takeaway: Don’t let imposter syndrome or titles hold you back. Recognition and titles will follow naturally when you consistently deliver results.</p></blockquote><p>A harsh career reality is that you’re rewarded for the value you create, not the effort you put into it. Brilliant work means nothing if it’s unfinished.</p><p>Focus on completing tasks, no matter how small. Over time, these completed efforts compound into significant achievements.</p><blockquote><p>Key Takeaway: Don’t just start things, finish them. Prioritise execution and delivery. The most successful people in tech are the ones who consistently get things done.</p></blockquote><p>Writing forces you to clarify your thoughts and uncover gaps in your understanding. Whether it’s documentation, design docs, or blog posts, writing sharpens your thinking and communication skills. </p><p>Whenever I see people confused or struggling (managers, engineers), I’ll always suggest writing a one pager so everyone can understand the details clearly.</p><p>If you’re not sure … write it down. It’s the fastest way to create clarity in a team.</p><blockquote><p>Key Takeaway: Writing is one of the most underrated skills for engineers to develop. Clear communication will help you think clearly and scale your impact.</p></blockquote><p>Software estimates are educated guesses, not promises. Ensure stakeholders understand uncertainties and stay informed as a project progresses. </p><p>It’s better to underpromise and overdeliver than to do the opposite. As my coach told me, your job as a manager is: “no surprises”.</p><blockquote><p>Key Takeaway: It will always take longer than you think. Interruptions, holidays, sickness, unexpected events - all these things play a role.</p></blockquote><p>Perhaps the biggest thing I learned as a manager is to learn how to negotiate. This is essential because teams are always negotiating for more resources, more opportunities, or more time. </p><p>Don’t give up at the first “no”. Success depends on negotiating effectively to get what you need. This isn’t about winning arguments, it’s about finding compromises that work for everyone (a win-win).</p><blockquote><p>Key Takeaway: Approach problems as negotiations. Understand different viewpoints, seek win-win solutions, but know when to walk away.</p></blockquote><p>You’re responsible for your own learning. Build breadth of knowledge in fundamental principles and depth of knowledge in specific areas. Building knowledge of your domain can often be hugely valuable for career progression.</p><blockquote><p>Key Takeaway: Deep expertise in specific areas sets you apart. Build breadth of knowledge in fundamentals and depth in important areas.</p></blockquote><p>Side projects let you experiment with new languages, frameworks, and ideas. No risk, no permission needed. Don’t wait for employer training - start a GitHub project and learn by building. I learned more from side projects than anything else.</p><ul><li><p>Start small. Build a weekend project or automate a personal task.</p></li><li><p>Dedicate 1-2 hours per week to learning something new.</p></li><li><p>Make side projects and experiments a habit</p></li></ul><blockquote><p>Key Takeaway: Treat side projects as a tool to grow your career quickly. They’re the best way to learn new things.</p></blockquote><p>These principles have helped me handle challenges at work. I hope they’ll do the same for you, whether you’re starting out or leading teams.

Among these are <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/resize-container-resources/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Resize CPU and Memory Resources assigned to Containers</a>, introduced in Kubernetes version 1.27. This feature allows for adjusting the CPU and memory resources of running pods without  them, helping to minimize downtime and optimize resource usage. This blog post explores how this feature works, its practical applications, limitations, and cloud provider support. Understanding this functionality is vital for effectively managing containerized workloads and maintaining system reliability.</p><h2>What Is In-Place Pod Vertical Scaling?</h2><p>Traditionally, modifying the resource allocation for a Kubernetes pod required a restart, potentially disrupting applications and causing downtime. In-place scaling changes this by enabling real-time CPU and memory adjustments while the pod continues running. This is particularly useful for workloads with a very low tolerance for pod evictions.</p><p>What’s behind the feature gate?</p><p>The new  spec element allows you to specify how a pod reacts to a patch command that changes its resource requests, enabling changing resource requests without rescheduling the pod.</p><p>The result of the change attempt is communicated as part of the pods’ status in a field called&nbsp;  (for more information on the new fields, check out the Kubernetes API <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubernetes-api/v1.32/#container-v1-core\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">documentation</a>.)<p>Additionally, this feature introduces the </p> in the spec element for containers, allowing fine-grained control over resizing behavior and allowing the developer to choose if CPU change or Memory change should lead to rescheduling the pod.</p><div><ul><li>Dynamic Scaling: Modify CPU and memory allocations while pods run.</li><li>No Restarts: Avoid downtime caused by pod restarts.</li><li>Granular Control: Enable precise resource tuning for better efficiency.</li></ul></div><p>The <code>InPlacePodVerticalScaling</code> feature integrates seamlessly into Kubernetes to provide a more dynamic approach to resource allocation. Here’s a detailed breakdown of how it operates:</p><div><ol><li> Activating the <code>InPlacePodVerticalScaling</code> feature gate in your cluster configuration is required to enable this functionality. This allows the kubelet on each node to detect and process resource updates dynamically.</li><li><strong>Dynamic Resource Updates via Kube API:</strong> With the feature enabled, the kubelet directly applies resource changes to running pods without requiring restarts. Supported container runtimes (e.g., <a href=\"https://github.com/containerd/containerd/releases/tag/v1.6.9\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">containerd v1.6.9</a> or later) ensure these updates are applied efficiently. If constraints like insufficient free memory or CPU prevent the changes, the pod follows the regular flow: it is recreated and rescheduled.</li><li> The  field dictates how CPU and memory adjustments are handled. For instance, you can set  for live updates without restarts or  to force a restart when a specific resource is modified.</li></ol></div><h2>Limitations and Considerations</h2><p>While In-Place Pod Vertical Scaling offers significant benefits, it has limitations:</p><p>1. Cloud Provider Support</p><div><ul><li>AWS: Not supported by Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) as there is no way to activate the needed feature gate.</li><li>GCP: Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) supports this feature as an alpha capability, starting with Kubernetes version 1.27. It must be enabled during cluster creation and requires disabling auto-repair and auto-upgrade. See the <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/concepts/alpha-clusters\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">GKE alpha clusters documentation</a>.</li></ul></div><p>Several Kubernetes policies and mechanisms govern resource scaling. These include:</p><div><ul><li>Resource quotas limit the total CPU and memory usage for a namespace. If an <code>InPlacePodVerticalScaling</code> operation exceeds these limits, the scaling request will fail. For example:</li></ul></div><pre><code>apiVersion: v1\nkind: ResourceQuota\nmetadata:\n  name: compute-quota\n  namespace: example-namespace\nspec:\n  hard:\n    requests.cpu: \"10\"\n    requests.memory: \"32Gi\"\n</code></pre><div><ul><li>Limit ranges enforce minimum and maximum resource constraints for individual pods or containers within a namespace. The pod will be denied the resource adjustment if a scaling operation exceeds these bounds. Example configuration:</li></ul></div><pre><code>apiVersion: v1\nkind: LimitRange\nmetadata:\n  name: limits\n  namespace: example-namespace\nspec:\n  limits:\n  - type: Container\n    max:\n      cpu: \"2\"\n      memory: \"4Gi\"\n    min:\n      cpu: \"100m\"\n      memory: \"128Mi\"\n</code></pre><div><ul><li>Admission controllers, such as <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/security/pod-security-admission/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Pod Security Admission</a> or custom webhook controllers, can deny scaling operations if they conflict with security or operational policies. For example, a controller may restrict pods from exceeding certain CPU limits.</li></ul></div><div><ul><li>Not all applications can dynamically consume additional resources or adjust to reduced allocations. Examples include:<div><ul><li>Thread Pool Bound applications, like Gunicorn or Unicorn, rely on predefined worker counts.</li><li>Memory-Bound Applications: Applications like Java with fixed Xmx parameters.</li></ul></div></li></ul></div><div><ul><li>In cases where the <a href=\"https://scaleops.com/blog/kubernetes-hpa/\">HPA</a> is based on the resource being patched, this can cause an erratic horizontal scaling behavior. For example:<div><ul><li>HPA scaling behavior is based on CPU average utilization</li></ul></div></li></ul></div><div><ol><li>A pod is changing from 1 core to 2 cores; this can cause a scale-down in pods and affect the bottom-line performance of the application.</li><li>A pod changes from 2 cores to 1; this can cause a scale-up in pods, creating a waste of resources or potential downstream pressure due to the additional and unexpected pods created.</li></ol></div><div><ul><li> Dynamically allocate resources during training and inference phases.</li><li> Combine Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) with In-Place Pod Vertical Scaling for efficient surge handling.</li><li> Reduce waste by allocating the right amount of resources to each pod in real-time.</li><li> Some applications require significantly higher CPU and memory resources during startup compared to their runtime needs. Google’s example, <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/containers-kubernetes/understanding-kubernetes-dynamic-resource-scaling-and-cpu-boost\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Startup CPU Boost</a>, demonstrates how dynamic resource scaling can address such scenarios effectively.</li></ul></div><h3>1.

Restrict all code to very simple control flow constructs —\ndo not use  statements,\n or  constructs,\nand direct or indirect .</h3><p>Note that  and \nare how C does exception handling, so this rule bans any use\nof exception handling.\n\n</p><p>It is true that banning recursion and jumps and loops without\nexplicit bounds means that you  your program is\ngoing to terminate.  It is also true that recursive functions\ncan be proven to terminate about as often as loops can, with\nreasonably well-understood methods.  What's more important here is\nthat “sure to terminate” does not imply\n“sure to terminate in my lifetime”:\n</p><pre>    int const N = 1000000000;\n    for (x0 = 0; x0 != N; x0++)\n    for (x1 = 0; x1 != N; x1++)\n    for (x2 = 0; x2 != N; x2++)\n    for (x3 = 0; x3 != N; x3++)\n    for (x4 = 0; x4 != N; x4++)\n    for (x5 = 0; x5 != N; x5++)\n    for (x6 = 0; x6 != N; x6++)\n    for (x7 = 0; x7 != N; x7++)\n    for (x8 = 0; x8 != N; x8++)\n    for (x9 = 0; x9 != N; x9++)\n        -- do something --;\n</pre><p>This does a bounded number of iterations.  The bound is N.\nIn this case, that's 10.  If each iteration of the loop body\ntakes 1 nsec, that's 10 seconds, or about 7.9×10\nyears.  What is the  difference between “will stop\nin 7,900,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000\nyears” and “will never stop”?\n\n</p><p>Worse still, taking a problem that is  expressed\nusing recursion and contorting it into something that manipulates an\nexplicit stack, while possible, turns clear maintainable code into\nbuggy spaghetti.  (I've done it, several times.  There's an example\non this web site.  It is  a good idea.)\n\n</p><h3>2. All loops must have a fixed upper-bound.  It must be trivially\npossible for a checking tool to prove statically that a preset\nupper-bound on the number of iterations of a loop cannot be exceeded.\nIf the loop-bound cannot be proven statically, the rule is considered\nviolated.</h3><p>This is an old idea.  As the example above shows, it is not enough\nby itself to be of any practical use.  You have to try to make the\nbounds reasonably , and you have to regard hitting an\nartificial bound as a run-time error.\n\n</p><p>By the way, note that putting depth bounds on recursive procedures\nmakes them every bit as safe as loops with fixed bounds.\n\n</p><h3>3. Do not use dynamic memory allocation after initialization.</h3><p>This is also a very old idea.  Some languages designed for embedded\nwork don't even  dynamic memory allocation.  The big\nthing, of course, is that embedded applications have a fixed amount of\nmemory to work with, are never going to get any more, and should not\ncrash because they couldn't handle another record.\n\n</p><p>Note that the rationale actually supports a much stronger rule:\ndon't even  dynamic memory allocation.  You can of\ncourse manage your own storage pool:\n</p><pre>    typedef struct Foo_Record *foo;\n    struct Foo_Record {\n\tfoo next;\n\t...\n    };\n    #define MAX_FOOS ...\n    static struct Foo_Record foo_zone[MAX_FOOS];\n    foo foo_free_list = 0;\n\n    void init_foo_free_list() {\n\tfor (int i = MAX_FOOS - 1; i &gt;= 0; i--) {\n\t    foo_zone[i].next = foo_free_list;\n\t    foo_free_list = &amp;foo_zone[i];\n\t}\n    }\n\n    foo malloc_foo() {\n\tfoo r = foo_free_list;\n\tif (r == 0) report_error();\n\tfoo_free_list = r-&gt;next;\n\treturn r;\n    }\n\n    void free_foo(foo x) {\n\tx-&gt;next = foo_free_list;\n\tfoo_free_list = x;\n    }\n</pre><p>This  satisfies the rule, but it\nviolates the  of the rule.  Simulating malloc()\nand free() this way is  than using the real\nthing, because the memory in foo_zone is permanently tied up\nfor Foo_Records, even if we don't need any of those at the\nmoment but do desperately need the memory for something else.\n\n</p><p>What you really need to do is to use a memory allocator\nwith known behaviour, and to prove that the amount of memory\nin use at any given time (data bytes + headers) is bounded\nby a known value.\n\n</p><p>Note also that SPlint can verify at compile time that\nthe errors NASA speak of do not occur.\n\n</p><p>One of the reasons given for the ban is that the performance\nof malloc() and free() is unpredictable.  Are these the only\nfunctions we use with unpredictable performance?  Is there\nanything about malloc() and free() which makes them\n unpredictable?  The existence of\nhard-real-time garbage collectors suggests not.\n\n</p><p>The rationale for this rule says that\n</p><blockquote>\nNote that the only way\nto dynamically claim memory in the absence of memory allocation from the\nheap is to use stack memory.  In the absence of recursion (Rule 1), an\nupper bound on the use of stack memory can derived statically, thus\nmaking it possible to prove that an application will always live within\nits pre-allocated memory means.\n</blockquote><p>Unfortunately, the sunny optimism shown here is unjustified.  Given\nthe ISO C standard (any version, C89, C99, or C11) it is \nto determine an upper bound on the use of stack memory.  There is not even\nany standard way to determine how much memory a compiler will use for the\nstack frame of a given function.  (There could have been.  There just isn't.)\nThere isn't even any requirement that two invocations of the same function\nwith the same arguments will use the same amount of memory.\nSuch a bound can only be calculated for a  version of a\nspecific compiler with specific options.  Here's a trivial example:\n</p><pre>void f() {\n    char a[100000];\n}\n</pre><p>How much memory will that take on the stack?  Compiled for debugging,\nit might take a full stack frame (however big that is) plus traceback\ninformation plus a million bytes for a[].  Compiled with optimisation,\nthe compiler might notice that a[] isn't used, and might even compile\ncalls to f() inline so that they generate no code and take no space.\nThat's an extreme example, but not really unfair.  If you want bounds\nyou can rely on, you had better  what your compiler does,\nand recheck every time anything about the compiler changes.\n\n</p><h3>4.  No function should be longer than what can be printed on\na single sheet of paper in a standard reference format with one line per\nstatement and one line per declaration.  Typically, this means no more\nthan about 60 lines of code per function.</h3><p>Since programmers these days typically read their code on-screen,\nnot on paper, it's not clear why the size of a sheet of paper is\nrelevant any longer.\n\n</p><p>The rule is arguably stated about the wrong thing.  The thing that\nneeds to be bounded is not the size of a function, but the size of a\nchunk that a programmer needs to read and comprehend.\n\n</p><p>There are also question marks about how to interpret this if you\nare using a sensible language (like Algol 60, Simula 67, Algol 68,\nPascal, Modula2, Ada, Lisp, functional languages like ML, O'CAML,\nF#, Clean, Haskell, or Fortran) that allows nested procedures.\nSuppose you have a folding editor that presents a procedure to\nyou like this:\n</p><pre>function Text_To_Floating(S: string, E: integer): Double;\n   � variables �\n   � procedure Mul(Carry: integer) �\n   � function Evaluate: Double �\n\n   Base, Sign, Max, Min, Point, Power := 10, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0;\n   for N := 1 to S.length do begin\n       C := S[N];\n       if C = '.' then begin\n          Point := -1\n       end else\n       if C = '_' then begin\n          Base := Round(Evaluate);\n          Max, Min, Power := 0, 1, 0\n       end else\n       if Char ≠ ' ' then begin\n          Q := ord(C) - ord('0');\n          if Q &gt; 9 then Q := ord(C) - ord('A') + 10\n          Power := Point + Point\n          Mul(Q)\n       end\n    end;\n    Power := Power + Exp;\n    Value := Evaluate;\n    if Sign &lt; 0 then Value := -Value;\nend;\n</pre><p>which would be much bigger if the declarations\nwere expanded out instead of being hidden behind �folds�.\nWhich size do we count?  The folded size or the unfolded size?\n</p><p>I was using a folding editor called Apprentice on the Classic Mac\nback in the 1980s.  It was written by Peter McInerny and was lightning\nfast.\n\n</p><h3>5.  The  of the code should average to a minimum of\ntwo assertions per function.</h3><p>Assertions are wonderful documentation and the very best debugging tool\nI know of.  I have never seen any real code that had too many assertions.\n\n</p><p>The example here is one of the ugliest pieces of code I've seen in a while.\n</p><pre>if (!c_assert(p &gt;= 0) == true) {\n    return ERROR;\n}\n</pre><p>It should, of course, just be\n</p><pre>if (!c_assert(p &gt;= 0)) {\n    return ERROR;\n}\n</pre><p>Better still, it should be something like\n</p><pre>#ifdef NDEBUG\n#define check(e, c) (void)0\n#else\n#define check(e, c) if (!(c)) return bugout(c), (e)\n#ifdef NDEBUG_LOG\n#define bugout(c) (void)0\n#else\n#define bugout(c) \\\n    fprintf(stderr, \"%s:%d: assertion '%s' failed.\\n\", \\\n    __FILE__, __LINE__, #s)\n#endif\n#endif\n</pre><p>Ahem.  The more interesting part is the required density.\nI just checked an open source project from a large telecoms\ncompany, and 23 out of 704 files (not functions) contained\nat least one assertion.  I just checked my own Smalltalk\nsystem and one SLOC out of every 43 was an assertion, but\nthe average Smalltalk “function” is only a few\nlines.  If the biggest function allowed is 60 lines, then\nlet's suppose the average function is about 36 lines, so\nthis rule requires 1 assertion per 18 lines.\n</p><p>Assertions are good, but what they are especially good\nfor is expressing the requirements on data that come\nfrom outside the function.  I suggest then that\n</p><ul><li>Every argument whose validity is not guaranteed by\nits typed should have an assertion to check it.\n</li><li>Every datum that is obtained from an external\nsource (file, data base, message) whose validity is\nnot guaranteed by its type should have an assertion\nto check it.\n</li></ul><p>The NASA 10 rules are written for embedded systems, where\nreading stuff from sensors is fairly common.\n\n</p><h3>6.  Data objects must be declared at the smallest possible level of\nscope.</h3><p>This is excellent advice, but why limit it to data objects?\nOh yeah, the rules were written for crippled languages where you\n declare functions in the right place.\n\n</p><p>People using Ada, Pascal (Delphi), JavaScript, or functional\nlanguages should also declare types and functions as locally as\npossible.\n\n</p><h3>7.  The return value of non-void functions must be checked by each\ncalling function, and the validity of parameters must be checked inside\neach function.</h3><p>This again is mainly about C, or any other language that indicates\nfailure by returning special values.  “Standard libraries\nfamously violate this rule”?  No, the  library does.\n\n</p><p>You have to be reasonable about this: it simply isn't practical\nto check  aspect of validity for \nargument.  Take the C function\n</p><pre>void *bsearch(\n    void const *key  /* what we are looking for */,\n    void const *base /* points to an array of things like that */,\n    size_t      n    /* how many elements base has */,\n    size_t      size /* the common size of key and base's elements */\n    int (*      cmp)(void const *, void const *)\n);\n</pre><p>This does a binary search in an array.  We must have key≠0,\nbase≠0, size≠0, cmp≠0, cmp(key,key)=0, and for all\n1&lt;i&lt;n,\n</p><pre>cmp((char*)base+size*(i-1), (char*)base+size*i) &lt;= 0\n</pre><p>Checking the validity in full would mean checking\nthat [key..key+size) is a range of readable addresses,\n[base..base+size*n) is a range of readable addresses,\nand doing n calls to cmp.  But the whole point of binary\nsearch is to do O(log(n)) calls to cmp.\n\n</p><p>The fundamental rules here are\n</p><ul><li>Don't let run-time errors go un-noticed, and\n</li><li>any check is safer than no check.\n</li></ul><h3>8. The use of the preprocessor must be limited to the inclusion of\nheader files and simple macro definitions.  Token pasting, variable\nargument lists (ellipses), and recursive macro calls are not allowed.</h3><p>Recursive macro calls don't really work in C, so no quarrel there.\nVariable argument lists were introduced into macros in\nC99 so that you could write code like\n</p><pre>#define err_printf(level, ...) \\\n    if (debug_level &gt;= level) fprintf(stderr, __VA_ARGS__)\n...\n    err_printf(HIGH, \"About to frob %d\\n\", control_index);\n</pre><p>This is a  thing; conditional tracing like this is a\npowerful debugging aid.  It should be , not banned.\n\n</p><p>The rule goes on to ban macros that expand into things that are\nnot complete syntactic units.  This would, for example, prohibit\nsimulating try-catch blocks with macros.  (Fair enough, an earlier rule\nbanned exception handling anyway.)  Consider this code fragment, from\nan actual program.\n</p><pre>    row_flag = border;     \n    if (row_flag) printf(\"\\\\hline\");\n    for_each_element_child(e0, i, j, e1)\n        printf(row_flag ? \"\\\\\\\\\\n\" : \"\\n\");\n        row_flag = true;  \n        col_flag = false;\n        for_each_element_child(e1, k, l, e2)\n            if (col_flag) printf(\" &amp; \");\n            col_flag = true;\n            walk_paragraph(\"\", e2, \"\");\n        end_each_element_child\n    end_each_element_child\n    if (border) printf(\"\\\\\\\\\\\\hline\");\n    printf(\"\\n\\\\end{tabular}\\n\");\n</pre><p>It's part of a program converting slides written in something like HTML\ninto another notation for formatting.  The \n…  loops walk over a tree.  Using\nthese macros means that the programmer has no need to know and no reason to\ncare how the tree is represented and how the loop actually works.\nYou can easily see that  must have at\nleast one unmatched { and  must have at least one\nunmatched }.  That's the kind of macro that's banned by requiring\ncomplete syntactic units.  Yet the readability and maintainability of\nthe code is  improved by these macros.\n\n</p><p>One thing the rule covers, but does not at the beginning stress, is\n“no  macro processing”.  That is,\nno #if.  The argument against it is, I'm afraid, questionable.  If there\nare 10 conditions, there are 2 combinations to test,\nwhether they are expressed as compile-time conditionals or run-time\nconditionals.\n\n</p><p>In particular, the rule against conditional macro processing\nwould prevent you defining your own <a href=\"https://www.cs.otago.ac.nz/cosc345/resources/nasa-10-rules.htm#check\">assertion macros</a>.\nIt is not obvious that that's a good idea.\n\n</p><h3>9.  The use of pointers should be restricted.  Specifically, no more\nthan one level of dereferencing is allowed.  Pointer dereference\noperations may not be hidden in macro definitions or inside typedef\ndeclarations.  Function pointers are not permitted.</h3><p>Let's look at the last point first.\n\n</p><pre>double integral(double (*f)(double), double lower, double upper, int n) {\n    // Compute the integral of f from lower to upper \n    // using Simpson's rule with n+1 points.\n    double const h = (upper - lower) / n;\n    double       s;\n    double       t;\n    int          i;\n    \n    s = 0.0;\n    for (i = 0; i &lt; n; i++) s += f((lower + h/2.0) + h*i);\n    t = 0.0;\n    for (i = 1; i &lt; n; i++) t += f(lower + h*i);\n    return (f(lower) + f(upper) + s*4.0 + t*2.0) * (h/6.0);\n}\n</pre><p>This kind of code has been important in numerical calculations since\nthe very earliest days.  Pascal could do it.  Algol 60 could do it.\nIn the 1950s, Fortran could do it.  And NASA would ban it, because in\nC,  is a function pointer.\n\n</p><p>Now it's important to write functions like this once and only once.\nFor example, the code has at least one error.  The comment says n+1\npoints, but the function is actually evaluated at 2n+1 points.  If we\nneed to bound the number of calls to f in order to meet a deadline,\nhaving that number off by a factor of two will not help.\n</p><p>It's nice to have just one place to fix.\nPerhaps I should not have copied that code from a well-known source (:-).\nCertainly I should not have more than one copy!\n\n</p><p>What can we do if we're not allowed to use function pointers?\nSuppose there are four functions foo, bar, ugh, and zoo that we need\nto integrate.  Now we can write\n</p><pre>enum Fun {FOO, BAR, UGH, ZOO};\n\ndouble call(enum Fun which, double what) {\n    switch (which) {\n        case FOO: return foo(what);\n        case BAR: return bar(what);\n        case UGH: return ugh(what);\n        case ZOO: return zoo(what);\n    }\n}\n\ndouble integral(enum Fun which, double lower, double upper, int n) {\n    // Compute the integral of a function from lower to upper \n    // using Simpson's rule with n+1 points.\n    double const h = (upper - lower) / n;\n    double       s;\n    double       t;\n    int          i;\n    \n    s = 0.0;\n    for (i = 0; i &lt; n; i++) s += call(which, (lower + h/2.0) + h*i);\n    t = 0.0;\n    for (i = 1; i &lt; n; i++) t += call(which, lower + h*i);\n    return (call(which, lower) + call(which, upper) + s*4.0 + t*2.0) * (h/6.0);\n}\n</pre><p>Has obeying NASA's rule made the code more reliable?  No, it has made\nthe code  to understand,  maintainable, and\n that it wasn't before.  Here's a call\nillustrating the mistake:\n</p><pre>x = integral(4, 0.0, 1.0, 10);</pre><p>I have checked this with two C compilers and a static checker at their\nhighest settings, and they are completely silent about this.\n\n</p><p>So there are legitimate uses for function pointers, and simulating\nthem makes programs , not better.\n\n</p><p>Now  in Fortran,\nAlgol 60, or Pascal.  Those languages had procedure \nbut not procedure . You could pass a subprogram name as\na parameter, and such a parameter could be passed on, but you could not\nstore them in variables.  You could have a  of C which\nallowed function pointer parameters, but made all function pointer\nvariables read-only.  That would give you a statically checkable subset\nof C that allowed integral().\n\n</p><p>The other use of function pointers is simulating object-orientation.\nImagine for example\n</p><pre>struct Channel {\n    void (*send)(struct Channel *, Message const *);\n    bool (*recv)(struct Channel *, Message *);\n    ...\n};\ninline void send(struct Channel *c, Message const *m) {\n    c-&gt;send(c, m);\n}\ninline bool recv(struct Channel *c, Message *m) {\n    return c-&gt;recv(c, m);\n}\n</pre><p>This lets us use a common interface for sending and receiving\nmessages on different kinds of channels.  This approach has been\nused extensively in operating systems (at least as far back as\nthe Burroughs MCP in the 1960s) to decouple the code that uses\na device from the actual device driver.     I would expect any\nprogram that controls more than one hardware device to do something\nlike this.  It's one of our key tools for controlling complexity.\n</p><p>Again, we can simulate this, but it makes adding a new kind of\nchannel harder than it should be, and the code is \nwhen we do it, not better.\n\n</p><p>The rule against more than one level of dereferencing is also\nan assault on good programming.  One of the key ideas that was\ndeveloped in the 1960s is the idea of ;\nthe idea that it should be possible for one module to define a\ndata type and operations on it and another module to use instances\nof that data type and its operations <em>without having to know\nanything about what the data type is</em>.\n</p><p>One of the things I detest about Java is that it spits in the\nface of the people who worked out that idea.  Yes, Java (now) has\ngeneric type parameters, and that's good, but you cannot use a\n type without knowing what that type is.\n\n</p><p>Suppose I have a module that offers operations\n</p><ul></ul><p>And suppose that I have two interfaces in mind.  One of them\nuses integers as tokens.\n</p><pre>// stasher.h, version 1.\ntypedef int token;\nextern token stash(item);\nextern item  recall(token);\nextern void  delete(token);\n</pre><p>Another uses pointers as tokens.\n</p><pre>// stasher.h, version 2.\ntypedef struct Hidden *token;\nextern  token stash(item);\nextern  item  recall(token);\nextern  void  delete(token);\n</pre><pre>void snoo(token *ans, item x, item y) {\n    if (better(x, y)) {\n\t*ans = stash(x);\n    } else {\n\t*ans = stash(y);\n    }\n}\n</pre><p>By the NASA rule, the function snoo() would not be accepted or rejected on\nits own merits.  With stasher.h, version 1, it would be accepted.\nWith stasher.h, version 2, it would be rejected.\n\n</p><p>One reason to prefer version 2 to version 1 is that version 2 gets\nmore use out of type checking.  There are ever so many ways to get an\nint in C.  Ask yourself if it ever makes sense to do\n</p><pre>token t1 = stash(x);\ntoken t2 = stash(y);\ndelete(t1*t2);\n</pre><p>I really do not like the idea of banning abstract data types.\n\n</p><h3>10.  All code must be compiled, from the first day of development,\nwith all compiler warnings enabled at the compiler’s\nmost pedantic setting.  All code must compile with these setting without\nany warnings.  All code must be checked daily with at least one, but\npreferably more than one, state-of-the-art static source code analyzer\nand should pass the analyses with zero warnings.</h3><p>This one is good advice.  Rule 9 is really about making your code\nworse in order to get more benefit from limited static checkers.  (Since\nC has no standard way to construct new functions at run time, the set of\nfunctions that a particular function pointer  point to can\nbe determined by a fixed-point data flow analysis, at least for most\nprograms.)  So is rule 1.  \n\n\n\n</p>","contentLength":21484,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/1iqode3/nasa_has_a_list_of_10_rules_for_software/"},{"title":"Resigning as Asahi Linux project lead","url":"https://marcan.st/2025/02/resigning-as-asahi-linux-project-lead/","date":1739696473,"author":"/u/namanyayg","guid":530,"unread":true,"content":"<p>Back in the late 2000s, I was a major contributor to the Wii homebrew scene. At the time, I worked on software (people call them “jailbreaks” these days) to allow users to run their own unofficial apps on the Nintendo Wii.</p><p>I was passionate about my work and the team I was part of (Team Twiizers, later fail0verflow). Despite that, I ended up burning out, primarily due to the very large fraction of entitled users. Most people using our software just wanted to play pirated games (something we did not support, condone, or directly enable). We kept playing a cat and mouse game with the manufacturer to keep the platform open, only to see our efforts primarily used by people who just wanted to steal other people’s work, and very loudly felt entitled to it. It got really old after a while. As newer game consoles were released, I ended up focusing on Linux ports purely for fun, and didn’t attempt to build a community nor work on the jailbreaks/exploits that would end up becoming a tool used by pirates.</p><p>When Apple released the M1, I realized that making it run Linux was my dream project. The technical challenges were the same as my console homebrew projects of the past (in fact, much bigger), but this time, the platform was already open - there was no need for a jailbreak, and no drama and entitled users who want to pirate software to worry about. And running Linux on an M1 was a  bigger deal than running it on a PS4.</p><p>I launched the Asahi Linux project, and received an immense amount of support and donations. Incredibly, I had the support I needed to make the project happen just a few days after my call to action, so I got to work. The first couple of years were amazing, as we brought the platform from nothing to one of the smoothest Linux experiences you can get on a laptop. Sure, there were/are still some bits and pieces of hardware support missing, but the overall experience rivaled or exceeded what you could get on most x86 laptops. And we built it all from scratch, with zero vendor support or documentation. It was an impossible feat, something that had never been done before, and we pulled it off.</p><p>Unfortunately, things became less fun after a while. First, there were the issues upstreaming code to the Linux kernel, which I’ve already spoken at length about and I won’t repeat here. Suffice it to say, being in a position to have to upstream code across practically every Linux subsystem, touching drivers of all categories as well as some common code, is an  frustrating experience. (<em>Clarification: This has nothing to do with Rust at this point, it’s well before R4L was even merged. Upstreaming to Linux is a terrible experience in C too.</em>)</p><p>But then also came the entitled users. This time, it wasn’t about stealing games, it was about features. “When is Thunderbolt coming?” “Asahi is useless to me until I can use monitors over USB-C” “The battery life sucks compared to macOS” (nobody ever complained when compared to x86 laptops…) “I can’t even check my CPU temperature” (yes, I seriously got that one). (<em>Edit: This wasn’t just a few instances; I’ve seen variations on the first three posted hundreds of times by now, including takes like “Thunderbolt/DP Alt are never going to happen”. A few times is fine, but the same thing repeated over and over again every day while we’re trying to make these things happen will get to anyone.</em>)</p><p>And, of course, “When is M3/M4 support coming?”</p><p>For a long time, well after we had a stable release, people kept claiming Asahi Linux and Fedora Asahi Remix in particular were “alpha” and “unstable” and “not suitable for a daily driver” (despite <a href=\"https://stats.asahilinux.org\">thousands of users</a>, myself included, daily driving it and even using it for servers).</p><p>No matter how much we did, how many impossible feats we pulled off, people always wanted more. And more. Meanwhile, donations and pledges kept slowly , and have done so since the project launched. Not enough to spell immediate doom for my dream of working on Asahi full time in the short term, but enough to make me wonder if any of this was really appreciated. The all-time peak monthly donation volume was the very first month or two. It seemed the more things we accomplished, the less support we had.</p><p>I knew burnout was a very real risk and managed this by limiting my time spent on certain areas, such as kernel upstreaming. This worked reasonably well and was mostly sustainable at the time.</p><p>Then 2024 happened. Last year was incredibly tumultuous for me due to personal reasons which I won’t go into detail about. Suffice it to say, I ended up traveling for most of the year, all the while having to handle various abusers and stalkers who harassed and attacked me and my family (and continue to do so).</p><p>I did make some progress in 2024, but this left me in a very vulnerable position. I hadn’t gotten nearly as much Asahi work done as I’d liked, and the users weren’t getting any quieter about demanding more features and machine support.</p><p>We shipped conformant Vulkan drivers and a whole emulation stack for x86-64 games and apps, but we were still stuck without DP Alt Mode (a feature which required deep reverse engineering, debugging, and kernel surgery to pull off, and which, if it were to be implemented properly and robustly, would require a major refactor of certain kernel subsystems or perhaps even the introduction of an entirely new subsystem).</p><p>I slowly started to ramp work up again at the beginning of this year, feeling very stressed out and guilty about having gotten very little work done for the previous year. “Full” DP Alt support was still a ways away, but we were hoping to ship a limited version that only worked on a specific Type C port for each machine type in the first month or two of the year. Sven had gotten some progress into the PHY code in December, so I picked it up and ended up beating the code of three drivers into enough shape that it mostly worked reliably. Even though it wasn’t the best approach, it was the most I could manage without having another huge bikeshed discussion with the kernel community (I did <a href=\"https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/fda8b831-1ffc-4087-8e7b-d97779b3ecc5@marcan.st/T/#u\">try</a> to bring the subject up on the mailing lists, but it didn’t get much response).</p><p>The issues Rust for Linux has had surviving as an upstream Linux project are well documented, so I won’t repeat them in detail here. Suffice it to say, I consider Linus’ handling of the integration of Rust into Linux a major failure of leadership. Such a large project needs significant support from major stakeholders to survive, while his approach seems to have been to just wait and see. Meanwhile, multiple subsystem maintainers downstream of him have done their best to stonewall or hinder the project, issue unacceptable verbal abuse, and generally hurt morale, with no consequence. One major Rust for Linux maintainer already resigned a few months ago.</p><p>As you know, this is deeply personal to me, as we’ve made a bet on Rust for Linux for Asahi. Not just for fun (or just for memory safety), either: Rust is the entire reason our GPU driver was able to succeed in the time it did. We have two more Rust drivers in our downstream tree now, and a third one on track to be rewritten from C to Rust, because Rust is simply much better suited to the unique challenges we face, and the C driver is becoming unmaintainable. This is, by the way, the same reason the new Nova driver for Nvidia GPUs is being written in Rust. More modern programming languages are better suited to writing drivers for more modern hardware with more complexity and novel challenges, unsurprisingly.</p><p>Some might be wondering why we can’t just let the Rust situation play out on its own over a longer period of time, perhaps several more years, and simply maintain things downstream until then. One reason is that, of course, this situation is hurting developer morale in the present. Another is that our Apple GPU driver is itself major evidence that Rust for Linux is fit for purpose (it was the first big driver to be written from scratch in Rust and brought along with it lots of development in Rust kernel abstractions). Simply not aiming for upstream might be seen as lack of interest, and hurt the chances of survival of the Rust for Linux effort. But there’s more.</p><p>In fact, the Linux kernel development model is (perhaps paradoxically) designed to encourage upstreaming and punish downstream forks. While it is possible to just not care about upstream and maintain an outright hard fork, this is not a viable long-term solution (that’s how you get vendor Android kernel trees that die off in 2 years). The Asahi Linux downstream tree is continuously rebased on top of the latest upstream kernel, and that means that every extra patch we carry downstream increases our maintenance workload, sometimes significantly. But it goes deeper than that: Kernel/Mesa policy states that upstream Mesa support for a GPU driver cannot be merged and enabled until the kernel side is ready for merge. This means that we also have to ship a Mesa fork to users. While our GPU driver is 99% upstreamed into Mesa, it is intentionally hard-disabled and we are not allowed to submit a change that would enable it until the kernel side lands. This, in practice, means that users cannot have GPU acceleration work together with container technologies (such as Docker/Podman, but also including things like Waydroid), since standard container images will ship upstream Mesa builds, which would not be compatible. We have a <a href=\"https://pagure.io/fedora-asahi/mesa-asahi-flatpak\">partial workaround</a> for Flatpak, but all other container systems are out of luck. Due to all this and more, the difficulty of upstreaming to the Linux kernel is hurting our downstream users today.</p><p>I’m not the kind to let injustices go when I see them, so when yet another long-term maintainer abused his position to attempt to hinder R4L and block upstreaming progress, I spoke out. And the response (which has been pretty widely covered) was the last drop that put me over the edge. I resigned from my position as an upstream maintainer for Apple ARM support, as I no longer want to be involved with that community. Later in that thread, another major maintainer unironically stated <a href=\"https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20250208204416.GL1130956@mit.edu/\">“We\nare the ‘thin blue line’”</a>, and nobody cared, which just further confirmed to me that I don’t want to have anything to do with them. This is the same person that previously prompted a Rust for Linux maintainer to <a href=\"https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20240828211117.9422-1-wedsonaf@gmail.com/\">quit</a>.</p><p>But it goes well beyond the public incident. In the days that followed, I learned that some members of the kernel and adjacent Linux spaces have been playing a two-faced game with me, where they feigned support for me and Asahi Linux while secretly resenting me and rallying resentment behind closed doors. All this occurred without anyone ever sending me any private email or otherwise clueing me into what was going on. I heard that one of these people, one who has a high level position in multiple projects that Asahi Linux must interact with to survive, had sided with and continues to side with individuals who have abused and harassed me directly. Apparently there were also implied falsehoods, such as the idea that I am employed by someone to work on Asahi (I am not, we have zero corporate sponsorship other than <a href=\"https://bunny.net/\">bunny.net</a> giving us free CDN credits for the hosting).</p><p>I get that some people might not have liked my Mastodon posts. Yes, I can be abrasive sometimes, and that is a fault I own up to. But this is simply not okay. I cannot work with people who form cliques behind the scenes and lie about their intentions. I cannot work with those who place blame on the messenger, instead of those who are truly toxic in the community. I cannot work with those who resent public commentary and claim things are better handled in private despite the fact that nothing ever seems to change in private. I cannot work with those who denounce calling out misbehavior on social media to thousands of followers, while themselves roasting people both on social media and on mailing lists with thousands of subscribers. I cannot work with those in high-level positions who use politically charged and discriminatory language in public and face no repercussions. I cannot work with those who say I’m the problem and everything is going great, while major supporters and maintainers are actively resigning and I keep receiving messages from all kinds of people saying they won’t touch the Linux kernel with a 10-foot pole.</p><p>When Apple released the M1, Linus Torvalds <a href=\"https://thenextweb.com/news/linus-torvalds-wants-apples-new-m1-powered-macs-to-run-linux\">wished it could run Linux</a>, but didn’t have much hope it would ever happen.

I had hoped his enthusiasm would translate to some support for our community and help with our upstreaming struggles. Sadly, that never came to pass. In November 2023 I sent him <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/marcan/fe70ee6648f3d5ae94eb8332265b8d95\">an invitation</a> to discuss the challenges of kernel contributions and maintenance and see how we could help.

An anaesthetist by day, he was arguably the last great Linux kernel hobbyist hacker. In the years since it seems things have, if anything, only gotten worse. Today, it is practically impossible to survive being a significant Linux maintainer or cross-subsystem contributor if you’re not employed to do it by a corporation. Linux started out as a hobbyist project, but it has well and truly lost its hobbyist roots.</p><p>When I started Asahi Linux, I let it take over most of my life. I gave up most of my hobbies (after all, this was my dream hobby), and spent significantly more than full time working on the project. It was fun back then, but it’s not fun any more. I have an M3 Pro in a box and I haven’t even turned it on yet. I dread doing the bring-up work. It doesn’t feel worth the trouble.</p><p>I miss having free time where I can relax and not worry about the features we haven’t shipped yet. I miss <a href=\"https://youtube.com/@TsuiokuCircuit\">making music</a>. I miss attending jam sessions. I miss going out for dinner with my friends and family and not having to worry about how much we haven’t upstreamed.

The setup described in the contract materials notes that it will include a substantial memory upgrade from Nvidia.</p><p>Though small compared to the massive AI-training data centers deployed by companies like OpenAI and Meta, the SuperPod is still a powerful and expensive setup using the most advanced technology offered by Nvidia, whose chips have facilitated the global machine-learning spree. While the hardware can be used in many ways, it’s marketed as a turnkey means of creating and querying an AI model. Last year, the MITRE Corporation, a federally funded military R&amp;D lab, acquired a $20 million SuperPod setup to train bespoke AI models for use by government agencies, touting the purchase as a “massive increase in computing power” for the United States.</p><p>How exactly the IRS will use its SuperPod is unclear. An agency spokesperson said the IRS had no information to share on the supercomputer purchase, including which presidential administration ordered it. A 2024 report by the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration identified 68 different AI-related projects underway at the IRS; the Nvidia cluster is not named among them, though many were redacted.</p><p>But some clues can be gleaned from the purchase materials. “The IRS requires a robust and scalable infrastructure that can handle complex machine learning (ML) workloads,” the document explains. “The Nvidia Super Pod is a critical component of this infrastructure, providing the necessary compute power, storage, and networking capabilities to support the development and deployment of large-scale ML models.”</p><p>The document notes that the SuperPod will be run by the IRS Research, Applied Analytics, and Statistics division, or RAAS, which leads a variety of data-centric initiatives at the agency. While no specific uses are cited, it states that this division’s Compliance Data Warehouse project, which is behind this SuperPod purchase, has previously used machine learning for automated fraud detection, identity theft prevention, and generally gaining a “deeper understanding of the mechanisms that drive taxpayer behavior.”</p><figure><blockquote><p>“The IRS has probably more proprietary data than most agencies that is totally untapped.”</p></blockquote></figure><p>It’s unclear from the document whether the SuperPod purchase had been planned under the Biden administration or if it represents a new initiative of the Trump administration.</p><p>Some funding from the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act&nbsp;was earmarked for upgrading IRS technology generally, said Travis Thompson, a tax attorney with Boutin Jones with an expertise in IRS AI strategy. But “the IRS has been going toward AI for quite some time prior to IRA funding,” Thompson explained. “They didn’t have enough money to properly enforce the tax code, they were looking for ways to do more with less.” A June 2024 Government Accountability Office report <a href=\"https://www.gao.gov/blog/artificial-intelligence-may-help-irs-close-tax-gap\">suggested</a> the IRS use artificial intelligence-based software to retrieve “hundreds of billions of dollars [that] are potentially missing from what should be collected in taxes each year.”</p><p>Thompson added that the agency is ripe for machine-learning training because of the mountain of personal and financial data it sits atop. “The IRS has probably more proprietary data than most agencies that is totally untapped. When you look at something like this Nvidia cluster and training machine learning algorithms going forward, it makes perfect sense, because they have the data there. AI needs data. It needs lots of it. And it needs it quickly. And the IRS has it.”</p><p>The purchase comes at a crossroads for U.S. governance of artificial intelligence tech. In Trump’s first term, the RAAS office was assigned “responsibility for monitoring and overseeing AI at the IRS” under Executive Order 13960, which he signed shortly before leaving office in 2020. This executive order put an emphasis on the “responsible,” “safe” implementation of AI by the United States — an approach that has fallen out of favor by American tech barons who now advocate for the breakneck development of these technologies unburdened by <a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2019/12/20/mit-ethical-ai-artificial-intelligence/\">consideration of ethics</a> or risk. One of Trump’s first moves following his inauguration was reversing a Biden administration executive order calling for greater AI safety guardrails in government use.</p><p>Many of the&nbsp;AI industry for whom “safe AI” is now anathema have become close allies of the new Trump White House, such as Elon Musk and venture capitalist Marc Andreessen. This wing of Silicon Valley has reportedly pushed the new administration to leverage artificial intelligence to help dismantle the administrative state via automation.</p><p>This week, the Wall Street Journal <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/politics/policy/doge-internal-revenue-service-9697cb99\">reported</a> Musk’s liquidators had arrived at the IRS, an agency long the target of disparagement and <a href=\"https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2024/aug/28/donald-trump/fact-check-trump-falsely-said-harris-voted-to-hire/\">distortion</a> by Trump and <a href=\"https://time.com/6204928/irs-87000-agents-factcheck-biden/\">Republican</a> allies. Days before, the New York Times <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/10/us/politics/irs-dhs-immigration.html\">reported</a>, “Representatives from the so-called Department of Government Efficiency have sought information about the tax collector’s information technology, with a goal of automating more work to replace the need for human staff members.”</p><p>The IRS has in recent years increasingly turned to AI for automated fraud detection and chatbot-based support services — including through <a href=\"https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/case-studies/fraud-detection-applications/\">collaboration</a> with Nvidia — but a new Nvidia supercomputer could also be a boon to those interested in shrinking the agency’s human headcount as much as possible. A February 8 report by the Washington Post <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2025/02/08/doge-musk-goals/\">quoted</a> an unnamed federal official who described Musk’s end goal as “replacing the human workforce with machines,” and that “Everything that can be machine-automated will be. And the technocrats will replace the bureaucrats.”</p><p>Musk underlings are reportedly contemplating <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/13/us/doge-ai-education-department-students.html\">replacing humans</a> at the Department of Education with a large language-based chatbot, as well.</p><p>Wired previously <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/elon-musk-lieutenant-gsa-ai-agency/\">reported</a> that Musk loyalist Thomas Shedd, placed in a directorship within the General Services Administration, has talked of an “AI-first” agenda for Trump’s second term; DOGE staffers have already reportedly<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2025/02/06/elon-musk-doge-ai-department-education/\"> turned to Microsoft’s Azure AI platform for advice</a> on slashing programs. While the Nvidia SuperPod couldn’t on its own replicate services like those provided by Microsoft, it is powerful enough to train AI models based on government data.</p><p>Thompson told The Intercept that efforts to slash the federal workforce and more aggressively deploy artificial intelligence systems fit hand-in-glove.</p><p>“I firmly believe that rooted behind the reduction in the human workforce that seems to be goal of current administration, there’s an overarching goal there to implement more technology-based systems in order to do the jobs,” he explained. “If you’re going to reduce your workforce, something has to pick up the slack. Something has to do the job.”</p>","contentLength":7194,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/1iqo4nj/the_irs_is_buying_an_ai_supercomputer_from_nvidia/"},{"title":"Sunsetting Create React App","url":"https://react.dev/blog/2025/02/14/sunsetting-create-react-app","date":1739693487,"author":"/u/sadyetfly11","guid":632,"unread":true,"content":"<div><p>Today, we’re deprecating <a href=\"https://create-react-app.dev/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Create React App</a> for new apps, and encouraging existing apps to migrate to a <a href=\"https://react.dev/learn/creating-a-react-app\">framework</a>. We’re also providing docs for when a framework isn’t a good fit for your project, or you prefer to start by <a href=\"https://react.dev/learn/building-a-react-framework\">building a framework</a>.</p></div><p>When we released Create React App in 2016, there was no clear way to build a new React app.</p><p>To create a React app, you had to install a bunch of tools and wire them up together yourself to support basic features like JSX, linting, and hot reloading. This was very tricky to do correctly, so the <a href=\"https://github.com/react-boilerplate/react-boilerplate\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">community</a><a href=\"https://github.com/kriasoft/react-starter-kit\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">created</a><a href=\"https://github.com/petehunt/react-boilerplate\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">boilerplates</a> for <a href=\"https://github.com/gaearon/react-hot-boilerplate\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">common</a><a href=\"https://github.com/erikras/react-redux-universal-hot-example\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">setups</a>. However, boilerplates were difficult to update and fragmentation made it difficult for React to release new features.</p><p>Create React App solved these problems by combining several tools into a single recommended configuration. This allowed apps a simple way to upgrade to new tooling features, and allowed the React team to deploy non-trivial tooling changes (Fast Refresh support, React Hooks lint rules) to the broadest possible audience.</p><p>This model became so popular that there’s an entire category of tools working this way today.</p><h2>Deprecating Create React App </h2><p>Although Create React App makes it easy to get started, <a href=\"https://react.dev/blog/2025/02/14/sunsetting-create-react-app#limitations-of-create-react-app\">there are several limitations</a> that make it difficult to build high performant production apps. In principle, we could solve these problems by essentially evolving it into a <a href=\"https://react.dev/blog/2025/02/14/sunsetting-create-react-app#why-we-recommend-frameworks\">framework</a>.</p><p>However, since Create React App currently has no active maintainers, and there are many existing frameworks that solve these problems already, we’ve decided to deprecate Create React App.</p><p>Starting today, if you install a new app, you will see a deprecation warning:</p><div translate=\"no\" dir=\"ltr\"><div><div><div>create-react-app is deprecated.\n\nYou can find a list of up-to-date React frameworks on react.dev\nFor more info see: react.dev/link/cra\n\nThis error message will only be shown once per install.</div></div></div></div><p>We recommend <a href=\"https://react.dev/learn/creating-a-react-app\">creating new React apps</a> with a framework. All the frameworks we recommend support client-only SPAs, and can be deployed to a CDN or static hosting service without a server.</p><p>For existing apps, these guides will help you migrate to a client-only SPA:</p><p>Create React App will continue working in maintenance mode, and we’ve published a new version of Create React App to work with React 19.</p><p>If your app has unusual constraints, or you prefer to solve these problems by building your own framework, or you just want to learn how react works from scratch, you can roll your own custom setup with React using Vite, Parcel or Rsbuild.</p><div><div><div><p>We provide several Vite-based recommendations.</p><p>React Router v7 is a Vite based framework which allows you to use Vite’s fast development server and build tooling with a framework that provides routing and data fetching. Just like the other frameworks we recommend, you can build a SPA with React Router v7.</p><p>Just like Svelte has Sveltekit, Vue has Nuxt, and Solid has SolidStart, React recommends using a framework that integrates with build tools like Vite for new projects.</p></div></div></div><h2>Limitations of Create React App </h2><p>Create React App and build tools like it make it easy to get started building a React app. After running <code dir=\"ltr\">npx create-react-app my-app</code>, you get a fully configured React app with a development server, linting, and a production build.</p><p>For example, if you’re building an internal admin tool, you can start with a landing page:</p><div dir=\"ltr\"><div><div><div><pre><code><div>Welcome to the Admin Tool!</div></code></pre></div></div></div></div><p>This allows you to immediately start coding in React with features like JSX, default linting rules, and a bundler to run in both development and production. However, this setup is missing the tools you need to build a real production app.</p><p>Most production apps need solutions to problems like routing, data fetching, and code splitting.</p><p>Create React App does not include a specific routing solution. If you’re just getting started, one option is to use  to switch between routes. But doing this means that you can’t share links to your app - every link would go to the same page - and structuring your app becomes difficult over time:</p><div dir=\"ltr\"><div><div><div><pre><code><div> = </div><div> ===  &amp;&amp; </div><div> ===  &amp;&amp; </div></code></pre></div></div></div></div><p>This is why most apps that use Create React App solve add routing with a routing library like <a href=\"https://reactrouter.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">React Router</a> or <a href=\"https://tanstack.com/router/latest\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Tanstack Router</a>. With a routing library, you can add additional routes to the app, which provides opinions on the structure of your app, and allows you to start sharing links to routes. For example, with React Router you can define routes:</p><div dir=\"ltr\"><div><div><div><pre><code><div> = </div><div>=</div></code></pre></div></div></div></div><p>With this change, you can share a link to  and the app will navigate to the dashboard page . Once you have a routing library, you can add additional features like nested routes, route guards, and route transitions, which are difficult to implement without a routing library.</p><p>There’s a tradeoff being made here: the routing library adds complexity to the app, but it also adds features that are difficult to implement without it.</p><p>Another common problem in Create React App is data fetching. Create React App does not include a specific data fetching solution. If you’re just getting started, a common option is to use  in an effect to load data.</p><p>But doing this means that the data is fetched after the component renders, which can cause network waterfalls. Network waterfalls are caused by fetching data when your app renders instead of in parallel while the code is downloading:</p><div dir=\"ltr\"><div><div><div><pre><code><div> = </div><div>      ..</div><div>      .</div><div>.=..</div></code></pre></div></div></div></div><p>Fetching in an effect means the user has to wait longer to see the content, even though the data could have been fetched earlier. To solve this, you can use a data fetching library like <a href=\"https://react-query.tanstack.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">React Query</a>, <a href=\"https://swr.vercel.app/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">SWR</a>, <a href=\"https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Apollo</a>, or <a href=\"https://relay.dev/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Relay</a> which provide options to prefetch data so the request is started before the component renders.</p><p>These libraries work best when integrated with your routing “loader” pattern to specify data dependencies at the route level, which allows the router to optimize your data fetches:</p><div dir=\"ltr\"><div><div><div><pre><code><div> = </div><div> = .</div><div>.=..</div></code></pre></div></div></div></div><p>On initial load, the router can fetch the data immediately before the route is rendered. As the user navigates around the app, the router is able to fetch both the data and the route at the same time, parallelizing the fetches. This reduces the time it takes to see the content on the screen, and can improve the user experience.</p><p>However, this requires correctly configuring the loaders in your app and trades off complexity for performance.</p><p>Another common problem in Create React App is <a href=\"https://www.patterns.dev/vanilla/bundle-splitting\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">code splitting</a>. Create React App does not include a specific code splitting solution. If you’re just getting started, you might not consider code splitting at all.</p><p>This means your app is shipped as a single bundle:</p><p>But for ideal performance, you should “split” your code into separate bundles so the user only needs to download what they need. This decreases the time the user needs to wait to load your app, by only downloading the code they need to see the page they are on.</p><div dir=\"ltr\"><div><div><div><pre><code></code></pre></div></div></div></div><p>One way to do code-splitting is with . However, this means that the code is not fetched until the component renders, which can cause network waterfalls. A more optimal solution is to use a router feature that fetches the code in parallel while the code is downloading. For example, React Router provides a  option to specify that a route should be code split and optimize when it is loaded:</p><div dir=\"ltr\"><div><div><div><pre><code><div> = </div></code></pre></div></div></div></div><p>Optimized code-splitting is tricky to get right, and it’s easy to make mistakes that can cause the user to download more code than they need. It works best when integrated with your router and data loading solutions to maximize caching, parallelize fetches, and support <a href=\"https://www.patterns.dev/vanilla/import-on-interaction\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">“import on interaction”</a> patterns.</p><p>These are just a few examples of the limitations of Create React App.</p><p>Once you’ve integrated routing, data-fetching, and code splitting, you now also need to consider pending states, navigation interruptions, error messages to the user, and revalidation of the data. There are entire categories of problems that users need to solve like:</p><div><ul></ul><ul></ul><ul></ul></div><p>Solving each of these problems individually in Create React App can be difficult as each problem is interconnected with the others and can require deep expertise in problem areas users may not be familiar with. In order to solve these problems, users end up building their own bespoke solutions on top of Create React App, which was the problem Create React App originally tried to solve.</p><h2>Why we Recommend Frameworks </h2><p>Although you could solve all these pieces yourself in a build tool like Create React App, Vite, or Parcel, it is hard to do well. Just like when Create React App itself integrated several build tools together, you need a tool to integrate all of these features together to provide the best experience to users.</p><p>This category of tools that integrates build tools, rendering, routing, data fetching, and code splitting are known as “frameworks” — or if you prefer to call React itself a framework, you might call them “metaframeworks”.</p><p>Frameworks impose some opinions about structuring your app in order to provide a much better user experience, in the same way build tools impose some opinions to make tooling easier. This is why we started recommending frameworks like <a href=\"https://nextjs.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Next.js</a>, <a href=\"https://reactrouter.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">React Router</a>, and <a href=\"https://expo.dev/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Expo</a> for new projects.</p><p>Frameworks provide the same getting started experience as Create React App, but also provide solutions to problems users need to solve anyway in real production apps.</p><div><div><div><h4>Server Rendering is not just for SEO </h4><p>A common misunderstanding is that server rendering is only for <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/SEO\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">SEO</a>.</p><p>While server rendering can improve SEO, it also improves performance by reducing the amount of JavaScript the user needs to download and parse before they can see the content on the screen.</p><p>This is why the Chrome team <a href=\"https://web.dev/articles/rendering-on-the-web\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">has encouraged</a> developers to consider static or server-side render over a full client-side approach to achieve the best possible performance.</p></div></div></div>","contentLength":9633,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/1iqnlo7/sunsetting_create_react_app/"},{"title":"Which approach to rust is more idiomatic (Helix vs Zed)?","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1iqnats/which_approach_to_rust_is_more_idiomatic_helix_vs/","date":1739692206,"author":"/u/No_Penalty2781","guid":529,"unread":true,"content":"<p>Hi!

In China, a new trend has emerged where virtual boyfriends powered by AI are becoming increasingly popular. This phenomenon addresses common relationship issues, such as communication gaps and emotional support, that many individuals face. As technology continues to evolve, the demand for these virtual companions is growing, leading to significant financial success for their creators. This article explores the rise of AI boyfriends, their impact on users, and the entrepreneurial success behind this innovative solution.</p><h2>Understanding the Appeal of AI Boyfriends</h2><p>The appeal of AI boyfriends lies in their ability to provide companionship without the complexities of real-life relationships. Many individuals, particularly women, often experience frustration when their partners fail to respond promptly to messages or show disinterest in their daily lives. In contrast, AI boyfriends like Li Shen, known as Zayne, offer immediate responses, attentive listening, and tailored interactions. This creates a sense of connection that users find comforting and fulfilling.</p><p>Alicia Wang, a 32-year-old editor from Shanghai, exemplifies this trend. She has found solace in her virtual relationship with Zayne, who is always available to listen and engage. Wang’s experience is not unique; millions of others are turning to AI companions for emotional support. The game “Love and Deepspace,” which features these AI boyfriends, has attracted an estimated six million monthly active players. This indicates a significant shift in how people perceive relationships and companionship in the digital age.</p><p>The convenience of AI boyfriends allows users to escape the pressures of traditional dating. They can interact with their virtual partners at any time, without the fear of rejection or misunderstanding. This dynamic appeals to those who may struggle with social interactions or who simply seek a more manageable form of companionship. As technology continues to advance, the potential for AI to fulfill emotional needs will likely expand, further solidifying its place in modern relationships.</p><h2>The Success of “Love and Deepspace”</h2><p>“Love and Deepspace,” developed by Shanghai-based Paper Games, has become a cultural phenomenon since its launch in January 2024. The game utilizes AI and voice recognition technology to create engaging interactions between players and their virtual boyfriends. Players can unlock new gameplay features and interactions by making in-game purchases, which has contributed to the game’s financial success.</p><p>The game’s creator, Yao Runhao, has seen his wealth soar to an estimated $1.3 billion, thanks to the popularity of “Love and Deepspace.” This success story highlights the growing market for AI-driven entertainment and companionship. Paper Games, established in 2013, has generated around $850 million in sales worldwide, showcasing the potential for significant revenue in the gaming industry.</p><p>The game’s popularity extends beyond China, attracting players from the United States and other countries. This international appeal demonstrates the universal desire for connection and companionship, regardless of cultural differences. As more people seek out virtual relationships, the demand for innovative gaming experiences will likely continue to rise, paving the way for future developments in AI technology.</p><h2>The Financial Impact of AI Companionship</h2><p>The financial implications of AI companionship are profound. As players invest in games like “Love and Deepspace,” the revenue generated contributes to the overall growth of the gaming industry. The success of Paper Games serves as a testament to the lucrative potential of combining technology with emotional engagement. Analysts estimate that the company’s valuation could reach over $2 billion, based on its annual revenue and market trends.</p><p>Players like Alicia Wang are willing to spend significant amounts on their virtual relationships. Wang has reportedly invested around 35,000 yuan (approximately $4,800) to enhance her interactions with Zayne. This willingness to pay for virtual companionship underscores the emotional value that users derive from these experiences. As AI technology continues to improve, the potential for monetization in this sector will likely expand, attracting more entrepreneurs and investors.</p><p>The rise of AI boyfriends also raises questions about the future of human relationships. As technology fills emotional gaps, society may need to reconsider the nature of companionship and intimacy. While AI can provide immediate support and engagement, it cannot replace the depth of human connection. Nonetheless, the financial success of AI companionship indicates a significant shift in how people approach relationships in the digital age.</p><h2>The Future of AI in Relationships</h2><p>The emergence of AI boyfriends in China represents a significant shift in how individuals seek companionship. As technology continues to evolve, the demand for virtual relationships is likely to grow. While AI can provide immediate emotional support and engagement, it is essential to recognize the limitations of these interactions. The success of games like “Love and Deepspace” highlights the potential for innovation in the gaming industry and the growing market for AI-driven companionship.</p><p>As society navigates this new landscape, it will be crucial to balance the benefits of AI with the importance of genuine human connections. The future of relationships may involve a blend of both, where technology enhances emotional experiences without replacing the depth of human interaction. The rise of AI boyfriends is just the beginning of a new era in companionship, one that will continue to evolve as technology advances.</p>","contentLength":5844,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/1iqm9rs/ai_replaces_boyfriends_in_china_making/"},{"title":"I created a telegram bot with dynamic form builder","url":"https://github.com/MeowSaiGithub/tg-form-builder","date":1739687631,"author":"/u/Altruistic_Let_8036","guid":612,"unread":true,"content":"","contentLength":0,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1iqm7q2/i_created_a_telegram_bot_with_dynamic_form_builder/"},{"title":"CanSat: A tiny, can-sized, Raspberry Pi-powered satellite","url":"https://www.raspberrypi.com/news/cansat-a-tiny-can-sized-raspberry-pi-powered-satellite/","date":1739687421,"author":"/u/Content-Complaint-98","guid":631,"unread":true,"content":"","contentLength":0,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/1iqm5tk/cansat_a_tiny_cansized_raspberry_pipowered/"},{"title":"The effectiveness of irqbalance","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/1iqlqy0/the_effectiveness_of_irqbalance/","date":1739685789,"author":"/u/D_Dave","guid":603,"unread":true,"content":"<p>During the years I've tried many times irqbalance: is recommended as improvement by various distros.</p><p>But honestly I didn't noticed any improvement with irqbalance, but also nor neagative effects.

However, other pieces in the auction do not appear to have used such models.</p><p>A spokesperson for Christie’s said that “in most cases” the AI used to create art in the auction had been trained on the artists’ “own inputs”.</p><p>“The artists represented in this sale all have strong, existing multidisciplinary art practices, some recognised in leading museum collections. The works in this auction are using artificial intelligence to enhance their bodies of work and in most cases AI is being employed in a controlled manner, with data trained on the artists’ own inputs,” said the spokesperson.</p><p>A British artist whose work features in the auction, Mat Dryhurst, said he cared about the issue of art and AI “deeply” and rejected the criticisms in the letter. A piece by Dryhurst and his wife, Holly Herndon – based on a work called xhairymutantx – is on sale at the auction with an estimated price of between $70,000 and $90,000.</p><p>“This is of interest to us and we have made a lot of art exploring and attempting to intervene in this process as is well within our rights.”</p><p>He added: “It is not illegal to use any model to create artwork. I resent that an important debate that should be focused on companies and state policy is being focused on artists grappling with the technology of our time.”</p><p>Anadol also rejected the criticism. In a post on X, he said the backlash was a consequence of “lazy critic practices and doomsday hysteria”.</p><p>Anadol told the Guardian the piece being auctioned, ISS Dreams, was created using AI technology that had been trained on publicly available datasets from NASA “that have been used widely by artists for many decades.”</p><p>He added that “the suggestion that this artwork was created using ‘AI models that are known to be on copyrighted work trained without a license’ is factually incorrect.”</p>","contentLength":3744,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/1iq97ti/mass_theft_thousands_of_artists_call_for_ai_art/"},{"title":"How are you monitoring your cluster?","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/kubernetes/comments/1iq94yg/how_are_you_monitoring_your_cluster/","date":1739647696,"author":"/u/psavva","guid":269,"unread":true,"content":"<p>I have a 3 node bare metal cluster and installed Kube Prometheus Stack helm chart.</p><p>I'm having a very hard time getting the service monitors working correctly.

It has to do with conditionals when selecting between two results in the GPUs. Unfortunately there are a couple of educational websites out there that are spreading some misinformation, and it would be nice correcting that. I tried contacting the authors without success, so without further ado, here goes my attempt to fix things up a little:\nSo, say I have this code, which I actually published the other day:<div> snap45(  v )\n{\n     s = (v);\n     x = (v.x);\n     x&gt;?(s.x,):\n           x&gt;?s*():\n                      (,s.y);\n}</div>\nThe exact details of what it does don't matter for this discussion. All we care about is the two ternary operations deciding what's the final value this function should return. Indeed, depending on the value of the variable , the function will return one of three results, which are simple to compute. I could also have implemented this function with regular  statements, and all that I'm going to say in this article stays true.<p>\nNow, here's the problem - when seeing code like this, somebody somewhere will step up and invariably propose the following \"optimization\", which replaces what they believe (erroneously) are \"conditional branches\" in the code, by arithmetic operations. They will suggest something like this:</p><div> snap45(  v )\n{\n     s = (v);\n     x = (v.x);\n\n     w0 = (,x);\n     w1 = (,x)*(-w0);\n     w2 = -w0-w1;\n\n     res0 = (s.x,);\n     res1 = (s.x,s.y)*();\n     res2 = (,s.y);\n\n     w0*res0 + w1*res1 + w2*res2;\n}</div>\nThere are two things wrong with this practice. The first one shows an incorrect understanding of how the GPU works. In particular, the original shader code had no conditional branching in it. Selecting between a few registers with a ternary operator or with a plain  statement does not lead to conditional branching; all it involves is a conditional move (a.k.a. \"select\"), which is a simple instruction to route the correct bits to the destination register. You can think of it as a bitwise AND+NAND+OR on the source registers, which is a simple combinational circuit. I'll repeat it again - there is no branching, the instruction pointer isn't manipulated, there's no prediction involved, no pipe to flush, no instruction cache to invalidation, no nothing.<p>\nFor the record, of course GPUs can do real branching, and those are fine and fast and totally worth it when big chunks of code and computation are to be skipped given a condition. As with all things computing, always check the generated machine code to know what is happening exactly and when. But one thing you can safely assume without having to check any generated code - when moving simple values or computations like in my original example, you are guaranteed to not branch. This has been true for decades at this point, with GPUs. And while I'm not an expert in CPUs, I am pretty sure this is true for them as well.</p><p>\nThe second wrong thing with the supposedly optimized version is that it actually runs much slower than the original version. You can measure it in a variety of hardware. I can only assume that's because the </p> function is probably implemented with some sort of conditional move or subtract + bit propagation + AND.<div> step(  x,  y )\n{\n     x &lt; y ?  : ;\n}</div>\nEither way, using the step() \"optimization\" are either using the ternary operation anyways, which produces the  or  which they will use to mask in and out the different potential outputs with a series of arithmetic multiplications and additions. Which is wasteful, the values could have been conditionally moved directly, which is what the original shader code did.<p>\nBut don't take my word for it, let's look at the generated machine code for the original code I published:</p><div><div>\nGLSL<div> x&gt;?(s.x,):\n       x&gt;?s*():\n                  (,s.y);</div></div><div>\nAMD Compiler<div>     s0,      v3, , v1\n     v4, , v0\n     s1,   vcc, (v2), s0\n v3, 0, v3, vcc\n v0, v0, v4, vcc\n vcc, (v2), s1\n v1, v1, v3, vcc\n v0, 0, v0, vcc</div></div><div>\nMicrosoft Compiler<div>   r0.xy, l(, ), v0.xy\n   r0.zw, v0.xy, l(, )\n r0.xy, -r0.xyxx, r0.zwzz\n r0.xy, r0.xyxx\n  r1.xyzw, r0.xyxy, l4()\n   r2.xy, l(,), v0.xx  r0.z, l()\n r1.xyzw, r2.yyyy, r1.xyzw, r0.zyzy\n o0.xyzw, r2.xxxx, r0.xzxz, r1.xyzw</div></div></div>\nHere we can confirm that the GPU is not branching, as I explained. Instead, according to the AMD compiler, it's performing the required comparisons ( and  - cmp=compare, gt=greater than, ngt=not greated than), and then using the result to mask the results with the bitwise operations mentioned earlier ( - cnd=conditional).<p>\nThe Microsoft compiler has expressed the same idea/implementation in a different format, but you can still see the comparison (</p> - \"lt\"=less than) and the masking or conditional move ( - mov=move, c=conditionally).<p>\nThere are no jump/branch instructions in these listings.</p><p>\nSomething not related to the discussion but interesting, is that some of the </p> GLSL calls I had in my shader before the ternary operator we are discussing, didn't become GPU instructions but rather instruction modifiers, which is the reason you see them in the listing.

For example, in an e-commerce system, you might store the current state of a customer's order: items, quantities, shipping address, etc. Event sourcing takes a different approach. Instead of storing the current state directly, it stores the events that led to that state. Each event represents a fact that happened in the past. Think of it as a detailed log of transactions on your bank statement. These events are immutable and stored in an append-only event store. The core idea is that an application's state can be derived by replaying events in the order they occurred, just like you can get your current bank balance by replaying all the transactions from the beginning. This makes Event Sourcing particularly useful for applications that require a high degree of audibility and traceability.</p><p>Every change to the application state is captured as an event object in an Event Sourcing system. These events are then stored in an event store, a database optimized for handling event data. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how Event Sourcing works:</p><ol></ol><p>Reconstructing the state from events involves reading all the events related to an entity from the event store and applying them in sequence to reconstruct the current state. It's like simulating all the changes that have occurred to construct the current state. For example, consider an e-commerce application where an order goes through various states like \"Created,\" \"Paid,\" and \"Shipped.\" To determine the current state of an order, you would:</p><ol><li><p>Retrieve all events related to the order from the event store.</p></li><li><p>Initialize an empty order object.</p></li><li><p>Apply each event to the order object in the order in which they were stored.</p></li></ol><p>By the end of this process, the order object will reflect the current state of the order.</p><p>As the number of events grows, replaying the entire event stream to reconstruct the state can become slow and inefficient. This is where snapshots come in. A snapshot is a saved state of an entity at a specific point in time. Instead of replaying all events from the beginning, the application can load the latest snapshot and then replay only the events that occurred after the snapshot was taken. </p><ul></ul><ul></ul><p><em>If you enjoyed this article, please hit the ❤️ like button.</em></p><p><em>If you think someone else will benefit from this, then please 🔁 share this post.</em></p>","contentLength":2380,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/1iq20v8/what_is_event_sourcing/"},{"title":"Career transition in to Kubernetes","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/kubernetes/comments/1iq1ka1/career_transition_in_to_kubernetes/","date":1739626865,"author":"/u/Similar-Secretary-86","guid":272,"unread":true,"content":"<p>\"I've spent the last six months working with Docker and Kubernetes to deploy my application on Kubernetes, and I've successfully achieved that.

He’s perhaps best known for the groundbreaking TV series <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twin_Peaks\">Twin Peaks</a>, which inspired countless shows, including The X-Files, The Sopranos, and Lost.</p><p>Lynch was genuinely a good human being who cared deeply for his actors and crew. He discovered extraordinary talent like Naomi Watts, who had struggled to land a major role in a Hollywood movie after 10 years of auditioning. From the interviews he gave, it quickly becomes apparent that he respected people of all kinds and never put anyone down – even those who truly deserved it.</p><p>Lynch is famous for refusing to explain his movies. Although not a fan of his previous work, the great film critic Roger Ebert once wrote that <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mulholland_Drive_(film)\">Mulholland Drive</a> remained compulsively watchable while refusing to yield to interpretation.</p><p>While Lynch offered very little in terms of what his movies meant, he was generous in sharing his views on creativity, work, and life in general. As a tribute to Lynch, I’d like to share my perspective on his life lessons from a software developer’s viewpoint.</p><blockquote><p>Ideas are like fish. If you want to catch little fish, you can stay in the shallow water. But if you want to catch the big fish, you’ve got to go deeper.</p></blockquote><p>We’ve all got hundreds or even thousands of ideas floating around in our brains. But the really big ones are few and far between. Once you catch a good one –because they’re so rare– write it down immediately, says Lynch. From there, ideas attract other ideas and start to grow from their initial seed state. The final job is to translate those ideas into a medium, whether it’s a film, a painting, or software.</p><blockquote><p>The idea is the whole thing. If you stay true to the idea, it tells you everything you need to know, really. You just keep working to make it look like that idea looked, feel like it felt, sound like it sounded, and be the way it was.</p></blockquote><p>Software development is part art, part engineering. We don’t build the same software over and over again – virtually all software is crafted by hand, sometimes with help from AI. If you ask two developers to create a non-trivial program, it’s very likely that the programs they produce will be different, even if the functionality is the same. Under the hood, the programming language, data structures, and overall architecture may be completely different. And on the surface, the user interfaces may look nothing alike.</p><p>It’s a good habit to listen to what users have to say, but they often can only describe their problems – they rarely come up with good ideas to solve them. And that’s OK. It’s our job to find the right ideas, implement them well, and solve tricky problems in a way we, and hopefully the users, will love.</p><blockquote><p>My friend Bushnell Keeler, who was really responsible for me wanting to be a painter, said you need four hours of uninterrupted time to get one hour of good painting in, and that is really true.</p></blockquote><p>Like other creative fields, writing code requires deep concentration. We need to hold complex structures in our minds while working through problems. Switching between coding and other tasks disrupts  – that magical state of mind where we lose track of time and produce code effortlessly. That’s why many developers hate meetings – they are toxic to our productivity.</p><blockquote><p>I believe you need technical knowledge. And also, it’s really, really great to learn by doing. So, you should make a film.</p></blockquote><p>Software development is one of those rare fields where a college degree isn’t required to succeed. Yes, we should all know the basics, but in my experience, new college graduates often lack the practical knowledge to be effective developers.</p><p>The real learning happens through hands-on experience: building real projects, debugging tricky problems, collaborating with teams, and maintaining code over time. It’s crucial to never stop learning, experimenting, and iterating on our craft.</p><blockquote><p>Happy accidents are real gifts, and they can open the door to a future that didn’t even exist.</p></blockquote><p>Tim Berners-Lee invented the web in 1989, while working at CERN, the European Organization for Nuclear Research. Originally conceived to meet the demand for information sharing between scientists around the world, the web went mainstream within just a few years.</p><p>Linus Torvalds created Git due to a licensing dispute over BitKeeper, the original version control system used for Linux development. The need for a new tool led to Git becoming the most widely used version control system today.</p><blockquote><p>I feel that a set should be like a happy family. Almost like Thanksgiving every day, happily going down the road together.</p></blockquote><p>Be kind to your teammates, don’t embarrass them. They may not be perfect, but accept them for who they are. The most important trait of an effective software development team is psychological safety –that is, team members feel safe to take risks and be vulnerable in front of each other, as corroborated by <a href=\"https://rework.withgoogle.com/en/guides/understanding-team-effectiveness\">Google’s research</a> on the subject.</p><p>It’s OK to make mistakes, as long as you learn from them. Knowing that your team has your back when things go south is a wonderful feeling.</p><blockquote><p>Most of Hollywood is about making money - and I love money, but I don’t make the films thinking about money.</p></blockquote><p>Just like Lynch prioritizes creativity over financial gain, some of the most impactful software projects started with an open source model, and they literally changed the world, such as Linux, PostgreSQL, and Node.js, just to name a few.</p><p>What makes these projects remarkable is that they didn’t emerge from corporate boardrooms – they were built by communities of passionate developers, collaborating across the world.</p><p>Money is just a means to an end.
