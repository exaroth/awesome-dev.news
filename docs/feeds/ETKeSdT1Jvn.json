But one of the biggest challenges facing businesses today, that I particularly care about, is how to unlock the true potential of AI by leveraging a company’s operational business data. At Snow Leopard, we aim to bridge the gap between AI systems and critical business data that is locked away in databases, data warehouses, and other API-based systems, so enterprises can use live business data from any data source – whether it's database, warehouse, or APIs – in real time and on demand, natively. In this interview, I'd like to cover Snow Leopard’s intelligent data retrieval approach that can leverage business data directly and on-demand to make AI work.</p><p>Deepti is the founder and CEO of Snow Leopard AI, a platform that helps teams build AI apps using their live business data, on-demand. She has nearly 2 decades of experience in data platforms and infrastructure.</p><p>As Head of Product at Observable, Deepti led the 0→1 product and GTM strategy in the crowded data analytics market. Before that, Deepti was the founding PM for Google Spanner, growing it to thousands of internal customers (Ads, PlayStore, Gmail, etc.), before launching it externally as a seminal cloud database service. Deepti started her career as a distributed systems engineer in the RAC database kernel at Oracle.</p><p>Website: https://www.snowleopard.ai/</p><p>AI SQL Data Analyst // Donné Stevenson - https://youtu.be/hwgoNmyCGhQ</p><p>~~~~~~~~ ✌️Connect With Us ✌️ ~~~~~~~</p><p>Catch all episodes, blogs, newsletters, and more: https://go.mlops.community/TYExplore</p><p>Join our Slack community [https://go.mlops.community/slack]</p><p>Follow us on X/Twitter [@mlopscommunity](https://x.com/mlopscommunity) or [LinkedIn](https://go.mlops.community/linkedin)] </p><p>Sign up for the next meetup: [https://go.mlops.community/register]</p><p>MLOps Swag/Merch: [https://shop.mlops.community/]</p><p>Connect with Demetrios on LinkedIn: /dpbrinkm</p><p>Connect with Deepti on LinkedIn: /thedeepti/</p><p>[00:00] Deepti's preferred coffee</p><p>[00:49] MLflow vs Kubeflow Debate</p><p>[04:58] GenAI Data Integration Challenges</p><p>[09:02] GenAI Sidecar Spicy Takes</p><p>[14:07] Troubleshooting LLM Hallucinations</p><p>[19:03] AI Overengineering and Hype</p><p>[25:06] Self-Serve Analytics Governance</p><p>[33:29] Dashboards vs Data Quality</p><p>[37:06] Agent Database Context Control</p><p>[43:00] LLM as Orchestrator</p><p>[47:34] Tool Call Ownership Clarification</p><p>[51:45] MCP Server Challenges</p>","contentLength":2798,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"https://anchor.fm/s/174cb1b8/podcast/play/104409155/https%3A%2F%2Fd3ctxlq1ktw2nl.cloudfront.net%2Fstaging%2F2025-5-20%2F402521359-44100-2-6945f69f5f792.mp3","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Emulating Retro Games on Modern Consoles with Robin Lavallée and Bill Litshauer","url":"https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/2025/06/19/emulating-retro-games-on-modern-consoles-with-robin-lavallee-and-bill-litshauer/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=emulating-retro-games-on-modern-consoles-with-robin-lavallee-and-bill-litshauer","date":1750323621,"author":"SEDaily","guid":162683,"unread":true,"content":"<div><p>Emulating retro games on modern consoles is a growing trend, and allows players to experience classic titles with improved performance, enhanced resolution, and added features like save states and rewinding.
