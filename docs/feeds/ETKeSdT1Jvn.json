It is a symptom of how complex workflow orchestration has gotten. Is it a dominant trend or will we cycle back to ‚ÄúDAG specifications‚Äù? At Stitchfix, we had our own DSL that ‚Äúcompiled‚Äù into airflow DAGs and at MicroByre, we used a external workflow langauge. Both had a batch task executor on K8s but at MicroByre, we had human and robot in the loop workflows.// BioDr. Milowski is a serial entrepreneur and computer scientist with experience in a variety of data and machine learning technologies. He holds a PhD in Informatics (Computer Science) from the University of Edinburgh, where he researched large-scale computation over scientific data.

However, these models remain susceptible to significant security and safety vulnerabilities. Such weaknesses can enable attackers to jailbreak systems, allowing them to perform harmful tasks or leak sensitive information. As AI becomes increasingly integrated into critical applications like autonomous robotics and healthcare, the importance of ensuring AI safety is growing. Understanding the vulnerabilities in today‚Äôs AI systems is crucial to addressing these concerns.\n\n// Bio\nVinu Sankar Sadasivan is a final-year Computer Science PhD candidate at The University of Maryland, College Park, advised by Prof. Soheil Feizi. His research focuses on Security and Privacy in AI, with a particular emphasis on AI robustness, detectability, and user privacy. Currently, Vinu is a full-time Student Researcher at Google DeepMind, working on jailbreaking multimodal AI models. Previously, Vinu was a Research Scientist intern at Meta FAIR in Paris, where he worked on AI watermarking.\n\nVinu is a recipient of the 2023 Kulkarni Fellowship and has earned several distinctions, including the prestigious Director‚Äôs Silver Medal. He completed a Bachelor‚Äôs degree in Computer Science &amp; Engineering at IIT Gandhinagar in 2020.

We cover the basics of OriginTrail‚Äôs symbolic AI fundamentals (i.e. knowledge graphs) and go over details how decentralization improves data integrity, provenance, and user control. We‚Äôll cover the DKG role in AI agentic frameworks and how it helps with verifying and accessing diverse data sources, while maintaining compatibility with existing standards. \n\nWe‚Äôll explore practical use cases from the enterprise sector as well as latest integrations into frameworks like ElizaOS. We conclude by outlining the future potential of decentralized AI, AI becoming the interface to ‚Äúeat‚Äù SaaS and the general convergence of AI, Internet and Crypto.\n\n// Bio\nTomaz Levak, founder of OriginTrail, is active at the intersection of Cryptocurrency, the Internet, and Artificial Intelligence (AI). At the core of OriginTrail is a pursuit of Verifiable Internet for AI, an inclusive framework addressing critical challenges of the world in an AI era. To achieve the goal of Verifiable Internet for AI, OriginTrail's trusted knowledge foundation ensures the provenance and verifiability of information while incentivizing the creation of high-quality knowledge. These advancements are pivotal to unlock the full potential of AI as they minimize the technology‚Äôs shortfalls such as hallucinations, bias, issues of data ownership, and model collapse.\n\nTomaz's contributions to OriginTrail span over a decade and across multiple fields. He is involved in strategic technical innovations for OriginTrail Decentralized Knowledge Graph (DKG) and NeuroWeb blockchain and was among the authors of all three foundational White Paper documents that defined how OriginTrail technology addresses global challenges. Tomaz contributed to the design of OriginTrail token economies and is driving adoption with global brands such as British Standards Institution, Swiss Federal Railways and World Federation of Haemophilia, among others.\n\nCommitted to the ongoing expansion of the OriginTrail ecosystem, Tomaz is a regular speaker at key industry events. In his appearances, he highlights the significant value that the OriginTrail DKG brings to diverse sectors, including supply chains, life sciences, healthcare, and scientific research. In a rapidly evolving digital landscape, Tomaz and the OriginTrail ecosystem as a whole are playing an important role in ensuring a more inclusive, transparent and decentralized AI.\n\n// MLOps Swag/Merch\n<a href=\"https://shop.mlops.community/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"ugc noopener noreferrer\">https://shop.mlops.community/</a>\n\n// Related Links\nWebsite: <a href=\"https://origintrail.io\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferer\">https://origintrail.io</a></p>","contentLength":3065,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"https://anchor.fm/s/174cb1b8/podcast/play/97410634/https%3A%2F%2Fd3ctxlq1ktw2nl.cloudfront.net%2Fstaging%2F2025-0-22%2F393522714-44100-2-c347ea83225bc.mp3","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Fallthrough & Friends (Friends)","url":"https://changelog.com/friends/77","date":1737727200,"author":"","guid":43,"unread":true,"content":"<p>Kris Brandow &amp; Matthew Sanabria from <a href=\"https://fallthrough.fm\">Fallthrough.fm</a> join Jerod to discuss tools we‚Äôre switching to, whether or not Go is still a great systems programming language choice, user-centric documentation, the need for archivists &amp; more.</p><p><a href=\"https://changelog.com/++\" rel=\"payment\">Changelog++</a> members save 7 minutes on this episode because they made the ads disappear.
